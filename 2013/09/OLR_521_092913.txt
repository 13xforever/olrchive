Orange Lounge Radio
Loserhosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
Tonight, Valve's 3 announcements have come and gone. What did they reveal that didn't have 3 in its name?
Wii Lamento were LucasArts games lost at the studio's closure, Nintendo announces the newest entry to the Smash Bros. Roster, and this week I don't reference Mighty No. 9
Oops

Hi there everybody, out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
We are live here on September the 29th of 2013 with the 521st episode of our show
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, etc, etc, with my co-host, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers
You mean Empress Sakura of Normandy
Empress Sakura of Normandy
Yes
So just a 3 hour DarkSakura lovefest
Yes, because I'm Empress Sakura of Normandy
Maybe in your little Animal Crossing town you are, but here you ain't shit
Hey, I'd like to make an announcement
Okay
Wasps are the assholes of the insect kingdom
Assholes
You got stung by one, didn't you?
Yes I did, in my car
Well, why did you invite the wasp in your car?
I didn't invite it in my car, the little asshole, he just barged on in, I'm gonna hang out in your car
Asshole
And I'm super allergic, not like EpiPen allergic, but pretty allergic
And so, thankfully I was at my friend's house and I was like, Benadryl
So you're here and you're not having an allergic reaction, so if you just spontaneously pass out
No, I won't spontaneously pass out, but I've got a headache ever since
Alright
Fucking assholes
Also say hello to Techmaster Loki
Hello
Hi, Loki, how are you?
I'm fine
Have you had any run-ins with insects lately?
No
Glad to hear it
We are live, of course, Wednesday, or excuse me, not Wednesday, Sunday
It is Sunday, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
We do tape live every Sunday night after the Bobby Black Wolf show
At the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com
And of course, if you are listening live, you can join our chat room
Live.vognetwork.com
And you can participate along with our show
And whatever games we might be talking about tonight
Although, oddly, we were kind of looking things before the show
It was a slower of news weeks. I know we have some big announcements
Especially in the PC universe and so on
And you guys all probably know what I'm talking about
We'll get to those here before too long
But otherwise, it's kind of a relatively quiet week
Is that just because everybody's too busy playing Grand Theft Auto 5 still?
What is it? A billion?
Eleventy billion dollars that game's made? Loki?
It's over a billion, so
I don't know what the exact numbers are right now
It's crazy
A lot
I got to tell you, I almost caved and bought it
That's not good enough
It was all the chatter about the online stuff
And joining the VOD crew
Why are you going to miss out? It's starting in a couple days
I know, I kind of want to do it
But then I'm like, Rob, it's $60
You're going to be pissed when it comes out for PlayStation 4
So
I resisted
And I continued playing the games that I already have that I need to finish
Well, according to the VG charts
The top global seller is obviously being Grand Theft Auto 5
It sold a total of about 17 million copies already
Wow
And that's as of the 21st
And that's worldwide, right?
Worldwide
Has there been a release besides America? Is it out in Europe or Japan yet?
Yeah, it's out everywhere
Here's the thing, though
That's the 21st
That's over a week ago
It's only been selling a ton since then
Gosh, alright
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
Let's see
Where was it?
Oh, Dungeon Buster in chat says Grand Theft Billions
That's pretty much what it is right now
Grand Theft Billions
Have we seen the fallout in the media yet about
Grand Theft Auto makes killers and all this stuff?
There was one kid that stole a car or something
And shot some people and they said
Oh, it's because he's playing Grand Theft Auto
Right, right
I mean, they'll try to tie it with him
No, that's because he's stupid
They'll blame it on anything
I mean, it's just like there was another one
Another one of those
Kid brings a gun to school or something like that
And they blamed it on Minecraft
So, seriously, it'll be anything
Wasn't there that horrible tragedy happened in DC
There was a gunman that did a shooting
And I want to say it was either this week or last week
And didn't they peg that on?
He played video games, sure enough
Oh, well that explains everything
He played Call of Duty, so therefore, you know
That's right
It's just dumb because they're willing to like, you know
Think that's okay to say that
Yet, at the same time, they could say
You could just easily draw the conclusion
Well, he ate food
Food made him kill people
I mean, because all of these murders
I tell you what
All of the murders that have ever happened
Tied the food
Because people eat
Food causes murder
You know what
If video games really, you know
Caused a particular action
Then I should be going out trying to ride ostriches
And wearing cat ears all the time
And throwing books at people
If video games caused
I would throw blue shells at people on the freeway if that worked
If Grand Theft Auto is causing people to murder
Well, we're in for the apocalypse
Because there's 17 million people out there now
That are murderers
So it's only a matter of time before everybody's dead
If any food drives people to murder
It's probably mayonnaise
And that's why I avoid it
Mayonnaise is awesome
You shut your whore mouth
You murderous woman
Yeah, I'll murder some eggs to make more mayonnaise
Barf
Barf
Somebody call the cops
Because somebody's got to get killed over mayonnaise
Mayonnaise is really good for your hair
Yeah
Why would you
Something that's good for your hair
Why would you eat it
Do you eat shampoo?
No
Beer is good for your hair
I drink lots of beer
Okay, well I take a bath in beer
Would you take a bath in beer?
As long as I could, no
No, because then that would be alcohol abuse
And I just want to put my head in and drink it
I saw that on Family Guy today actually
Did you now?
Yes
You know what, actually last night while I was playing Final Fantasy
I was, I had one bottle left of Newton's Folly
Which is like some of the best apple cider ever
And I was like, well I'm getting dizzy
And then I kept trying to go to bed
And then I kept doing more quests
And I was like, wait, I was supposed to go to bed
I was having a very classy weekend
Friday night, Alan and I
We wanted to go to this new restaurant in town
But it was way too crowded
So we went to one of our favorites, Pita Kitchen
Which, you know, you know that place
We love that place
Pita Kitchen
And then we went by Safeway
It's like right by there, right?
So we went by Safeway
And we got a bottle of barefoot wine
And some Ben and Jerry's
And I brought it home
And I played Final Fantasy XIV all night long
With my bottle of wine and Ben and Jerry's
And I was like, I am a classy dude tonight
By the way
You know what's sitting in my fridge at home?
I have a bottle of apple wine
From the Boa Vista Orchard at Apple Hill
Delicious
I need people to help me drink it
Because I will drink the whole damn thing by myself
Help you drink liquor, I can do that
Alright, look
Moving from our classy weekends
To a little bit of a kickoff topic
And then we'll get into our gaming weeks
But Loki, I wanted to give you an opportunity
To talk about this latest hacking project of yours
Because you've talked about it on the show
A little bit in passing
But it's one thing to kind of talk about it
But it's another to see it
So here in studio tonight you brought it
And I apologize to listeners because they can't see it
It's not anything yet
But it's just the monitor that I'm using
Yeah, you have like a flat screen monitor
But not like
Like it is literally just the screen part
There's no base
There's nothing
Well, there's no like
What brand is this?
This is an on lap
It's an on lap
I forget what they call it
But here I'll show you how nice it looks
It's pretty sexy looking actually
That's a pretty big big looking monitor
It's a 13 inch monitor
Normally if I didn't get such a great deal on it
I wouldn't probably be using that
So what exactly are you doing with this?
I'm basically building almost like a
Wii U tablet
But for
Like PlayStation 3 and
Xbox 360
You're not talking about like an emulator type of thing
Or anything like that are you?
No, it's basically gonna be a wireless HDMI
And it will sync up with
You know
Whatever
I hook up HDMI
Or whatever I hook up the transmitter
I'm still a little lost
Tell me like an application
How this would work with a game
Like as you say
Like okay
So basically I would hook up
I would use this
And whatever console I wanna play on
Say like an Xbox 360
You know
I'm gonna have controls
Like you know
Like you would see on the Wii U
Gamepad
Or like the 360 and stuff
And
So that's still something you're gonna attach to
Yeah it's something I'm gonna attach to
I'm gonna build a whole new case for it
Okay that's interesting
And then
What was I gonna say
So there's that
And then on top of that
There's gonna be
This like switch
I can switch between PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360
And so it's gonna have a wireless transmitter
That's HDMI
That you plug into whatever console you wanna do
And then it wirelessly transmits to the receiver
Which is gonna be built into the unit
So you have wireless video and audio
Up to like 30 feet away
And then the controllers are obviously wireless
Although I'm still running into a slight problem
With the PlayStation 3 one
It's gonna be a little bit more challenging
Because when you plug that in
To charge it off
Or run it off USB power
It shuts off the wireless radio I believe
So this doesn't sound so much like a second screen controller
As it does like you're building like a portable
360 that works in your house somewhere
Well it's a second screen
Because it's basically just pulling
Whatever signal
I can hook it up to my PC if I wanted to
I can hook it up to
Well I can't hook it up to an OUYA anymore
Because that's sold
But if I had another OUYA
I could hook it up to that
So basically anything that has an HDMI out
That's compatible with a PlayStation 3
Or Xbox 360 controller
What's the why on this
Like I know for one
You just like to have these projects
And do it because you can
It's because my wife watches the TV a lot
And right now I'm sitting there
On my computer monitor
And playing games
Which is fine
But it would be more comfortable
If I could sit on the couch
And just kind of kick back
Yes so this is something like
You could play Grand Theft Auto 5
In private with that thing in your lap
And not have your kid be able to see you
Shooting hookers on the television
Yeah he'd be asleep
But yeah basically
Okay but it's still like a way
Or okay so the wife can watch
You know Scandal
And you can
Whatever it is she watches
Yeah
And you can do that
Okay
There you go
I was gonna show you real quick
Let's see
This is not a great example
But here's my computer monitor
Okay
I mean so the
You know it'll do
Okay so since this is radio
Basically Loki is holding up this
This flat
Like basically because it's a flat
Picture time
Yeah you can do a picture
I'll put it on my tumblers
I know not all
Yeah it doesn't weigh
Like hardly anything
It's just like maybe a pound
Yeah not all our listeners
Are gonna
Are gonna go look it up
So let me describe it
It's
It kind of like because it's just
That very flat part of a computer monitor
It's almost like a tablet
And function
And you're literally looking at
A Windows 7 screen
With Firefox open
On this like little tablet
So is that a touch screen too?
No
No
So it's literally just the monitor
Yeah
Because it's just
It's a USB powered monitor
That's important
Because the whole thing is gonna
Run off a battery
Because it's gonna be wireless
Otherwise I'd have to plug it in
So yeah
It's USB powered
Which is pretty awesome
And I've actually tried it out
With an Xbox 360
I have another cable that's not
Hooked up to this that
It converts it to
It splits out the audio
From the HDMI
Because
You know
I don't have any speakers on this thing
So I have to build that
Let's see
Brad from Pod Culture in our chatroom
Says
Wouldn't it just be easier to buy another TV?
I have another TV
But I just
The problem is
You know setting up systems
And moving them around and stuff
It's just a lot easier for
I don't know
I just want to build this
Yeah
You have to understand Brad
This is the very manly man side of Loki
That now it's a thing
And once it's become a thing
He will stop at nothing to achieve
Said thing
Unless
There might be like that one little thing
That just derails the whole thing
And they'll be like
Ah forget it
Like what happened to the building
An arcade machine for $100
Or whatever that was
Um
I just lost interest
See
See
It
I didn't need another arcade machine
I had two I wasn't using
So why build a third
And also it didn't help that the PC
That I got for that
Was defective
So
You can't really
So you get what you pay for
Pretty much
It just wouldn't power up
You know go fake
Um
So yeah
I just
I ended up
Well I didn't even really part of the PC
I just threw it away
Because it was just not working
So
Um
Yeah
I just
I lost interest in that
Um
But
Now that I'm gonna be playing Grand Theft Auto 5
You know
So I'm
Definitely interested in having a screen
I can play that on
Alright
Fair enough
Especially with the online component
Of Grand Theft Auto 5
Starting soon
Ah it's next week
And I'm sure it's gonna be absolutely
You know
Disastrous as far as
You know
Being able to connect to it
Uh
Quick plug for the VOG Network crew
How many people are in that now
Like 20 at least
Um
There's quite a few
Yeah
Um
So yeah
So
Um
Uh
You can go to our forums
And check out
We have a thread on it
Otherwise you can go to
Socialclub.rockstargames.com
Slash
Crew
Slash
VOG Network
And check it out
And
We're seeing right now
How many people we have in there
20 members
Yeah
There you go
So
And I even promoted Bobby
So
Well there you go
Bobby is now promoted to
Commissioner
Commissioner Bobby
Commissioner Bobby
Nice
I appreciate that
If I know how it's gonna work
I wonder like
I'm gonna be playing both
Playstation 3 and Xbox 360
Like all my co-workers
Have the PS3 version
And they want me to play on that
I just hope that my progress
moves with both
Like it's in the cloud
Well they say it's in the cloud
And stuff
And they say that like you can
When the Playstation 4 version
Comes along that your
You know
Multiplayer information
Goes along with that
But
I just don't know how exactly
That works
Like you know
Cause they have special editions
Of stuff you could've gotten
For one or
The other system
They add different perks
For your characters
But I don't think I can like
Save my character on
Playstation 3
And then transfer it over
It may just do my stats
And that's about it
But
I don't know
We'll check it out I guess
Alright well
Good luck with this
New project of yours
How long do you think it's
Gonna take you to finish?
Well I'm just testing everything
As I go along
So I'm getting the
Wireless HDMI stuff
On Wednesday
And then
The hardest part
Is gonna be
Making the case for it
Cause
Yeah how do you do that
And then also
I have to get a battery
To run everything
Which I figured out
I need a 12 volt battery
Then I'm gonna use a
Step down to
Drop it to 5
Volts so that I can get
More amps out of it
Cause
It's basically gonna be powering
About
4 or 5 USB powered
Things you know
The two controllers
Cause there's gonna be
The internals for
You know
DualShock 3
And then also
You know
The monitor
And then
The wireless HDMI
So
It's four things
And
I think there's something else
I'm forgetting
Speakers
We believe in you
We believe in you
You'll get it
Well I'll see
At the very least
This monitor's pretty cool
So
It is a nice little thing
It looks like a tablet
Looks expensive
Alright
$35
Wow
That's how much of a steal
I got that for
Normally they go for about
$250
Where at?
eBay
Nice
I bid snipe
How much
Speaking of eBay
Before we get into
How was your gaming week
How much did your
Ouya go for on eBay?
$80
Well that's good
That's really good
That's not bad
Considering you paid what
$90 for it?
Yeah
$99
And $80
That's not bad
And also
Funny enough
Actually Saints Row 4
I sold my
Xbox 360 copy of that
Cause I have it on PC
And I don't really play
The 360 version
That went for $14
So I was
I would have bought that
For more
Yeah exactly
There's so much
Counterfeit shit on eBay
Of new games
You gotta be really careful
Remember a couple years ago
When Alan got me that
Child of Eden
That came from China
And it wasn't even
Like we opened it
And the box was
Like Assassin's Creed
And it was very clearly
A burned disc
And it was
A piece of garbage
And he had to go
The whole thing
Where you file the complaint
With eBay
And wait
Oh god
What a mess
Well you just gotta
Go watch
I've got
The
It's some big box set
For
The Guild
On DVD
So
But it hasn't
Streeted yet
So I can't put it up there
Lowkey's eBay shop
Alright
I love the Guild
Alright
Let's talk about
Our gaming weeks
The types of video games
That we have been playing
This week
So Dark Soccer
Wanna start us off
What have you been playing?
Salad
Salad the game
Princess Tomato in the
Salad kingdom
No
I'm actually legit
Eating a salad
I've been playing
I've been playing
Final Fantasy 14
And
Um
I got really irritated
Because I couldn't do
The next
A story quest
Until I
And I thought that I was
Ahead levels
And then
No you have to be 27
So I'm running around
Doing just shit
And I'm in this one place
As a
I'm a quarry mill
For anyone who's playing
And everybody there
Like you can just follow
Hoards of people
From blue dot
To blue dot
It's hilarious
Yeah it's uh
Fate parties
If you actually shout out
And say
You guys all like
Any contributions
Are pooled
So you get more
Golds that way
It's a trick people use
In leveling
I just ignore everybody
Yeah
That works too
They don't exist
In my mental universe
You can do enough
Side quests
And other things
To you know
Level
Um
So I mean I hit it
Obviously
While I'm drinking
So I was like
Okay
And um
I uh
What else did I play
Animal Crossing
Of course
I haven't really been
Um
So I asked
Bejeweled
I don't know why
It's just fun
It's a nice little
Time waster
And I've actually
Gotten pretty good
At the diamond mine
It's a good potty game
It actually is
A really good potty game
My iPhone has changed
The way I use the bathroom
Rob
There's a shirt
That says that
And I want it
Um
And uh
Dan had
Beat GTA 5
Mm-hmm
So
I've now been
You know
Randomly going in there
And hearing you know
It's been pretty funny
But you're not really
Interested in playing yourself
No
I don't
You know what
I don't care how good
A game is
I have no tolerance
For misogyny
You have to have also like
Just some interest in it
You know
I have zero interest in it
Now if it was you know
I want to do like
A lady Grand Theft Auto
Where it's just this
Hardcore
You know
Woman
Tearing down the patriarchy
Play Saints Row
Because you can kind of do it
Saints Row 2
Saints Row 2
Not the other ones
No
But you
But it's
I really have no interest in
I hate to say
I have no interest in the culture
Because clearly I have an interest
In various aspects of culture
But it's not something
That appeals to me
So
I don't really care about it
Fair enough
Alright
I'll go in and watch Dan play
For a little bit
And I'm like
I'll just roll my eyes
And go
Really?
Because
Oh my god
I have to tell you
What happened the other day
I was pumping gas
And this guy comes up
And says
You know
One of the
Can we do your windshield thing
Fluid you know
So that they're trying
To sell you something
And I said
That's okay
I'm not interested
He's like
Oh well I hope you have
A better rest of your day
I got so mad
I said
Would you have asked me that
If I was a man?
And he's like
I thought not
But you know
It was like
God I hate people
But yeah
I don't know
I've been a little bit
Hypersensitive
What in the hell
Does that have to do with games?
Because
I'm just saying
That I've been so hypersensitive
Lately
And just really pissed off
At everything
Especially after talking
With my mother
That I think
I would vomit all over
GTA V
At this point
In a feminist rage
You're missing the point
I mean honestly
If you're gonna vomit
All over GTA V
It's a story
It has guys in it
I mean
So what
There's not a fucking female lead
Boo
Hoo
Get over it
Seriously
Everybody needs to get over it
I can see where
Well here's the thing about Grand Theft Auto
I don't care that it has it
I just don't have to play it
It pushes the envelope
As art does
Right
Video games are art right
And Grand Theft Auto
Definitely pushes the envelope
In a lot of ways
But for me
Grand Theft Auto
And everything that's in it
Again
I don't put
A game like Grand Theft Auto
On any different platform
Than I put movies
And Grand Theft Auto to me
Is just one of those like
Brosy action movies
Exactly
That are out there and exist
You know
And there's definitely
An audience for it
A lot of those movies
Really do well
But there's some people
That just aren't really
Interested in it
Just like
I bet Loki
Wouldn't be caught dead
Watching The Notebook
You know
I've already seen it
I haven't seen it
And I don't care to see it
Well I mean
It's just
It's a genre that
I am not into
I mean
If it had more things
That I think
Would appeal to me
As a player
You know
Then I might give it a chance
Like I tried Saints Row
Saints Row 3
Or the third
Or whatever the fuck it was
It wasn't very fun
So what exactly
About Mass Effect 3
Made for a good game
Versus Grand Theft Auto 5
Well first of all
It actually told
A very solid story
There was very little
Misogyny in it
Which
But you haven't played
Grand Theft Auto 5
So you have no fucking clue
What the story is like
Um
I've actually sat
There's a great story
In fact
Three stories
Throughout the entire
Campaign of it
There's
I just don't understand
How people can get off
Saying that there's
Not a good story in that
I mean
The whole game is compelling
I'm not saying the story
Isn't good
I'm just saying
It doesn't appeal to me
Yeah but you're
Blaming it saying
You're saying that
It doesn't have a good story
And Mass Effect 3
Has a great story
I didn't say
It didn't have a good story
I said
It doesn't appeal to me
There is a difference
Between something
And not being
Something that I'm into
You know
For example
Okay
Misogyn
The play
Great story
I don't really care
For the play
Um
Chicago
Great movie
Great story
I hate everybody in it
I don't
I've seen it once
I don't care
To see it again
Breaking Bad
Just won an Emmy
And I think
We're going up
Against the finale tonight
And I'm sure
It's a great show
And I hate that show
Okay
And I'm sure it's a good show
But I just
I'd rather
Do other stuff right now
But I mean
Anything
That's kind of where I see it
Is that it's like
Alright
So Breaking Bad's
Winning all these awards
And I'm sure it's a great show
I'm not gonna
Sit here
Yeah
I'm not gonna sit here
Not the show
But it's just like
Ain't nobody got time
For that right now
For me
Here's another
Here's another example
Okay
I have a bajillion friends
That are into Buffy
And I love Joss
Because he can tell
I have a few episodes
That I like to watch
I really don't care
For the series as a whole
The end
You know
It's the same thing
Something can be good
On its own merits
But if it's not your thing
You don't have to watch it
Or like mayonnaise
Again
I really hate mayonnaise
What?
Actually it is like mayonnaise
Mayonnaise has
Very good culinary applications
But if you're not into it
You're not into it
You know
Alright
I like boobs
Some girls don't like boobs
Another thing
Self hating women
I guess we'll leave it at that
If that's it for your gaming week
Loki how was your gaming week?
My gaming week was Grand Theft Auto 5
And I played a ton of it
And even had the time to
Shoot some video for a funny little
Montage thing
That's set to
The music from the movie Rad
Because it's
I haven't seen your video yet
It's just weird
For me
The movie Rad
Because I was looking
I don't remember what I was doing
I was browsing
YouTube
And you know how I make recommendations
For you and stuff
And I think I watched
What was it
I played the navigator on there one time
And so I recommended Rad and stuff
So
That movie is really fucking cheesy
If you've ever seen it
It is super cheeseball
They have like
A scene at a dance
Where they're riding BMX bikes
To like
Send me an angel
It's just like
What the hell is going on
So I was like ok that's really funny
And so I had Trevor in the game
Doing all those bikes
Running from the police
Hitting people with his bike
Firing a shotgun and stuff
And I thought the juxtaposition of that
With the music from the movie
Was fantastic and hilarious
So I decided to
Make a short YouTube video
Called Breaking Rad
Cause you know
He's a meth dealer
So
Fixed
And uh
Are you gonna try and go viral
Like Bobby's article did this week
Oh no
It's not gonna go viral
It's just
It's just a funny video
So that's all
But yeah
So I played through that
And I'm actually
At the very end of the game
So
I'm trying to finish
The single player campaign
Before
Online starts
Cause I do wanna do online
I think I am gonna have a few days
Though because I know
You know online launches
On Tuesday
But
Come on
They even admitted to it
They're like
So listen
We know how online
You know
Multiplayer launches have been
And
Trust us
You know
We're gonna try to make sure
That that's not gonna be the same way
But
It's probably gonna
It'll break
It's gonna
You know
It's gonna be broken
It's gonna be
You know
Bumpy
But
You know
Just give us some time
You know
Cause that's
Seriously with the
Rockstar Social Club stuff
This week
So they
It's been tough
And they've been trying to
You know
Deal with 17 million people
Wanting to try this stuff out
So
You know
17 million people
You know
Or even like
Half that
Hitting up a server
Trying to play online
What was the strategy
I apologize if you've covered this
On the show before
But you know
Now that it's coming up this week
I'm thinking about it now
What was the strategy
Behind delaying it
And not having it
When the game launches
Did they just
They purposely wanted people
To spend some time
With single player mode
They wanted people
To rush to get into
The multiplayer portion
And they wanted you to enjoy
The single player portion
Of the game first
And they wanted to make sure
That everything worked properly
So
Um
I mean
There's a lot of stuff
In the world
So I can understand how
You need to make sure
Everything's
You know
Tested
And you know
Catch any flaws
You may have
With your servers
And that kind of stuff
Especially since they've had
Trouble with the Social Club stuff
Going to our chatroom
At live.vognetwork.com
Dungeon Buster said
Social Club was pretty rough
The game had issues
Connecting to it
Uh
SEG is in our chatroom
And says I'm glad they
Separated out the release
Yeah
So I could play the single player
And get a little bit of
A handle of like
You know
The map
And also kind of like
How you do heists
And just all that stuff
I'm gonna totally 180
The topic on you here
But this conversation's
Making me think about this
And it's not in our show
Roll tonight
And it is pretty big news
The uh
New Batman game
That's coming out
Uh
This uh
Fall in
A month or two
And this
The Wii U version
Will not have multiplayer
Oh shocking
They've said that before
The Nintendo
You know
Online component
Just isn't
They don't think
There's enough people there
And it's honestly
Probably not an untrue thing
But
Because of it
This is the news that came out
This week
The Wii U version's
Going to be ten dollars cheaper
Uh
Whereas the other versions
Will be sixty dollars
Because the
Wii U's missing the multiplayer
They're gonna knock ten dollars
Off the price
Some people are saying
God
I wish they would do that
For 360 as well
Or I wish
This is an offering
We could have for games
Where
Knock ten dollars
Off the price
For multiplayer
Which is kind of funny
To me
Cause isn't this like
The inverse
But in a more consumer
Friendly way
Of the online pass
Cause
The online pass
Was ten dollars right
Cause I'm thinking like
If
What I'm reading is correct
If games were ten dollars
Cheaper to begin with
We wouldn't have a problem
With online passes
Here's what it really
That's the way I read it
I think they're just
It's marketing spin
Is gonna be ten dollars
Cheaper
Wasn't a decision
That they made
When they
Put it out
I think what it is
Is that
The Wii U's stuff
Doesn't sell as well
And so they have to
Lower the price
To make it more attractive
To people
Buying games
That's really the true
Story of it
And the fact that it
Just doesn't have multiplayer
I don't think it
Would have mattered
They would have
Still put it out
At sixty bucks
Anyways
If they thought
They could get away with it
But that's really
What it comes down to
You know
Market down ten bucks
To try to see
If we can move
A few more copies
It's not
But see
Now they've gotten
A lot of PR spin
Out of it
You know
So it's very positive
And you know
That helps them out
As well
But it's not
It's not specifically
Because multiplayer is missing
Trust me
Because
Shit
They omit stuff
From all different
You know games
Across platforms
And there's never
A price break
Because of that
It's always because
It's a pretty sweet
Deal
Seeing
It also has
Gamepad support
I gotta be honest
I'm interested
In the new Batman game
I don't know how
I feel about multiplayer
Part of me says
Eh get it on
PlayStation 3
But even
Arkham City
Armored Edition
Was kind of lame
As far as the
Gamepad support
It was pretty much
What you had
With the PS3
I don't
Let that
Effect my opinion
Of the new Batman game
Because
Well A
I haven't played
Disc there

And
And
And
Are they starting to do away with the
Are they starting to put ducks in a row where that's a possibility?
I don't think so, because
We're gonna have a w-
Mario Kart 8, etc. etc.
But
Could this idiot be on to something?
Weeee
Without the gamepad
You think
Then why not just get a Wii
Cause it's not HD
Well why not get a
Why not get a 3DS then
I'm happier with my 3DS
Alright, anyhow, I'm just
Anyway, alright
For the love of God, just do what you're gonna
You know that's gonna happen eventually
Just put 3DS games on the goddamn Wii U
It's gonna happen
Or even regular DS games, like Clubhouse games
Anything, it's gonna happen
But, I just wish
We keep dragging this segment out, but I just wish
If they were to do that
Why can't I play a
DS game across the internet now
That should be something
I should be able to do, feasibly
Why can't I fucking do that
Like, the technology is there
If you're gonna sell DS games on
The Wii U, let me play Clubhouse
games with friends on the other coast
Instead of having to be in the same room
Because, I mean, I'm just going back to the
One 3DS game I have, Animal Crossing
I
Go to the International Island and chat
With people in Japan
And do the stupid
Club Tortimer games with them
And, you know, and usually
I don't have too much of a problem communicating
Because either there's a chance that
Between the Japanese I know and the English they know
We can get a point across
But, I mean, if they're letting you play with people
You know, across the ocean in a game
Like Animal Crossing, why can't you play other games
And actually
Now that I think about it, that may have actually been
The game I called out, Clubhouse games, you may have actually
Been able to play that across the internet on the DS
Did have some internet enabled games, like I think Prime Hunters
You could do online, right?
But, you know, there were
A lot of games you could only do in the same room
And it would be really cool if you could open that up
And, you know, shit, the Wii U's got a
Camera in it, why can't we
Be able to see friends while we're playing?
Or see dick while we're playing
Or boobies
Alright, anyhow, let's shift gears here
This is a huge kind of topic change here
This is going back to a story
From a long time ago
But we talked about this extensively
On OLR when it first happened
Because it had a local connection
And this goes all the way back to the year
I think it was 2007
When this all happened
No, or would it have been 2006?
I think it, no, it was 2007
When did the Wii come out? Nintendo Wii
Was it 2006?
I'm trying to remember when I waited in line in the cold
Well, here's the thing
Here locally, in California
There was a radio station
In Sacramento, specifically, where our show is based
Which is The End
And they had a contest called
Hold Your Wii for a Wii
You guys remember this now?
The unfortunate situation is
That the prize being given away
Was the video game
And the fact that it had the silly name
Kind of lent itself to this contest
And unfortunately
Jennifer Strange
Who is a resident of Rancho Cordova
Passed away after she held her Wii
She didn't even win the competition
Unfortunately
But she went home and she died
Because these radio hosts
And the radio station didn't realize
That yes, a person can die from drinking
Too much water and then not allowing themselves
To go to the bathroom
And people warned them during and before the contest
And it was really
Just a hugely ignorant thing
Unfortunately, they were ignorant of the fact
That a fraternity guy in Chico
Had passed away from the same thing
Not that long before
Somebody called into the radio station
Even saying, like, you guys shouldn't be doing this
And they kind of laughed it off
And that was the really damning thing
In this whole thing
Because they laughed that person off
And that clip really came back to haunt
All those people that got fired
So The Morning Rave
Was the name of this show at the time
$2.5 million in damages
Awarded against the station
In a lawsuit
But there were no further ramifications in place
Well, why do I bring this up today all these years later?
Because
Media watchdog group, the Sacramento Media Group
And Media Action Center
Bringing legal action to the Federal
Communications Commission, the FCC
To block the renewal
Of the license for K-DND
So because of this
Incident that happened over a Wii
Six or seven years ago
It's going to court
Where 1079 The End
May not get its license
And just to
Kind of give you the local connection, living here
I can tell you that radio station's huge
In this area, I think it's one of the top
Stations in the area, it's the top 40
Music station
Isn't it the last one that still have physical DJs?
Yeah, it's one of the few that still have physical DJs
I personally don't listen to it
Because it's like the Justin Bieber
One Direction
It's more like a teeny kid's station
So no great loss
But that shit's really popular
There's still people that work at those stations
Well, right
I would hate for those people to lose their jobs over other people's idiocy
Right
And so it's very interesting that all this time later
But they kind of bring up a good point
I guess there was even a documentary
Sue Wilson in 2009
Who was the founder of the Media Action Center
And who was a vocal critic of K-DND
In a documentary called Broadcast Blues
And says quote
In that contest, a woman died
But the Federal Communications Commission
Has not acted in any way
And you kind of look at that and go
Well, she has a point
But then there's another part of me that goes
It's been six years
And all those ignorant people
That were involved with this
Have nothing to do with the station anymore
I mean
Yes, it was horrific at the time
If it were me
I would make it more difficult
I mean, for example
To do maybe a complete
Investigation into their current practices
To see that they have indeed
Learned from their mistake
And are staying within proper
Health and safety compliance
Before approving it
Maybe give them extra requirements
Since they had this
History of events
Keep in mind for this
It takes seven years to come off of your
Your report, right?
We're looking kind of around the same
Time frame, you know
If your financial
You know
What's the word I'm trying to think of
If your financial ability
Is judged in terms of seven years
Then that should be
Clearly enough time to give a company
Seven years to clean up its act
Especially with hordes of lawyers
And officials
I think it's plenty of time
I just think that they need to prove that yes
We have learned the errors
Of our ways
So there you have it
All these years later
The silly name of the Nintendo Wii
Still
Still kind of causing these legal
Fallouts all these years later
Very interesting
Well maybe it stuck with the revolution
They'd be spinning in office chairs
And I do
Funny
Well I do have to say
I hate you and I really appreciate you all
At the same time
I do have to say that had the FCC
Stepped in when the event happened
That would have been appropriate
But it has been a little late
And yeah I do
I would more say that I'd want the FCC
Held accountable for their lack of action
But
Right now it would be too late
It would just be almost spiteful
And it's like you see all these years
All these years later do you know what I still
Hear about in regards to the FCC
Is when Janet Jackson
Everybody saw her titty at the Super Bowl
You still hear about that today
Because like just recently
There was like an appeal of an appeal
Where the CBS stations themselves
Would not be fine because
Oh my god people
Oh my god it was a titty
It was a titty
When you've got people stringing
Most people
Already seen her titties
With hands on them too
Right?
It was her album cover
Oh no it was Rolling Stone
Oh yeah okay it was Rolling Stone
Miley Cyrus has a video where you can see her titty
Yes
Well I mean speaking of her
She made a point not too long ago
That I had to roll my eyes at my mom and her husband
For being stupid over
But I mean she was saying
You've got shows where you see all of this gratuitous
Violence but someone says fuck
Or someone shows a boob
And people lose their shit
I agree we need more nudity in shows
Seriously
Like it is such a double standard
You know it's like oh my god
Oh there's a nipple
And like they even have it where they're pretty much
Topless but they've got pasties
But for some reason that nipple man
You've crossed the line
Why is the chat room going off about titty
Sprinkles
Stop giggling
SG100 Matt says
FCC is still going after
MIA for last year's
Super Bowl halftime show Middle Finger
Was that even last year or was that two years ago?
I don't know
Fucking sports ball
Yes but it was Madonna
Madonna
But Beyonce was this year
Was Madonna just last year or was that two years ago?
What's Madonna going to do to one up Miley
She made out with Britney Spears or whatever
Or there was a kiss or some garbage
Now she needs to one up
Madonna will have to literally
Pull something out of her
She will need to have sex with somebody on stage
In the middle of her song
Something is going to have to happen
You know what?
I have to say that Adam
What's-his-face that was on American Idol
Lambert
My mom's a big fan
Rob I love Adam
Lambert
As my friend Susan calls
He should have won Rob
Why do they let 12 year old girls vote on Idol Rob
They should ban little girls from voting on Idol
Because Adam Lambert was Rob
Because the other guy was cuter
But the 30 year olds won with David Cook
Just saying
And you know Susan
She calls him Madame Lambert
But he went out
On some of his performances
Being basically
As
I'd probably say overtly sexual
As some women feel
That they need to do
And he illustrated a very good point
Why should women be expected to do this
But men be lambasted for it
And at the same time if a woman goes out
And is classy
She still has a particular standard
That men aren't particularly held to
And you know
I think that the big fault
Just has to do with
Basically the
The expectations that society
Itself is forced
To have
By what's presented to us in the media
I think that
People losing their shit
Over a boob is how they are
Conditioned to react
You know
I don't know how we got from the Nintendo Wii
To this but here you go
Alright
Well you know
Actually the same will go for violent video games
Alright
Let's, sorry I gotta wrap up
The hot coffee thing
We gotta move on cause we're an hour and a half into the show
And not even halfway through our show roll for party
You know what I will flip off everybody for fucking free
If you wanna you know
Pay me at one point
Well I guess they're charging 1.5 million dollars
I'll charge 1.5 million dollars to flip people off
I'll do it too
I can talk to you about bedazzling boobs now
Just
I hate to say this but Jamie
Let's go to the next story
Actually I do have to point out to Raginator
That they have such a thing as bedazzling
Think it over
Is exactly what you think it is
No thanks
So um
A lot of us love our LucasArts
And a lot of people love Maniac Mansion
And Day of the Tentacle was pretty much
Like the
One of the best LucasArts games
Well another reason to be
Pissed off at Disney
They got rid of LucasArts
They also got rid of the game that was 80% complete
Hadn't yet been greenlit but it was sort of a dream project
For a lot of people
And it was a Day of the Tentacle
HD remake
And we've had a lot of HD remakes come in
And you know especially DuckTales
And the Mickey Mouse Castle of Illusion
This one I think would have made a lot of people
Piss themselves
But um
With the fall of LucasArts
This was one of the games to suffer
You know and on top of that too
Was they had a Star Wars
Smuggler game
They had a Death Star Ios game
A lot of stuff that was in
In process including
A Star Wars First Assault
So
Sad face
But I think Day of the Tentacle would be what I would be most
Now if I found out there was a Loom game
I would have gone out
On a rampage
I really wish they could have
Just like transitioned this or sold it
To somebody to finish or something
This is really heartbreaking
And it's 80% done
So just really really sad
There was a big
Just bringing Gearbox to finish the other 20%
What could possibly go wrong
There was a big expose on Kotaku about it
And so that's where they got the information from
Shame on you for bringing up that website on the show
Shame on you
Sorry but the article actually was legit
Fair enough
But I mean that being said
You know
It makes me think
About
When we have stuff like this
Oh god I hate this stupid program
When we have
You know developers working
On games and then just to have
It stop oh you're defunded
Oh we're closing down your division
Imagine the people that are working on this one
And they are totally into what they're making
Their heart goes into it
Imagine just that level of disappointment
I'm surprised it didn't leak to the internet
Even if it was only 80% done
I'm kind of surprised
Well keep in mind remember
What was it
Robotech Crystal Dreams
Well
One of the developers
Put a little bit more time and effort in it to link the
Levels
And released it
A lot of Atari 5200 prototypes
Dan and I have gone out and bought
They all have fished out the prototypes
Made them playable and put them on
A repurposed cartridge and sold them
I have a ton of
There's a
NES games, SNES games
Basically all these prototypes out
Oh here's an example
Space Fantasy Zone
Complete game
Didn't release because of the Sega license
But
I've got a copy
People will find a way to get out what they love
So I would actually
Be completely
Completely happy if someone
Decided to be sneaky
With code and get that out
Alright let's travel around the world
And check out some games that will be coming out a lot
Sooner than that will leak to the internet
Starting with the US release dates

There is SPEC
Spec Can is the game
That's coming out on the 3DS this week
And I'm trying to figure out what kind of game this is
It's labeled as an adventure game and it kinda looks like
I like the graphics cause it's like an old school
PC game in parts kinda mixed
With like a newer thing that's mixed with photography
I don't know if it's like a crime solving game or something
But uh maybe like a
CSI kinda game but that is uh one of the
Lone releases this week is on the 3DS

By the way uh chatters are telling me that my
Mic is cutting in and out sorry I
Can't see that live when I'm doing talking
Uh so I'm gonna try and hold
This thing together which is really unfortunate
Because this is a newer mic and was donated
So I don't know Well it's looking a little bit more stable
According to the recording
Yeah I tried to uh
Unhook and re-hook and I'm just gonna try to hold it
Really nice and steady and hope it doesn't cut out again
Alright
Steady steady as she goes
If it flails too bad though
I'll have to figure something out live
Sorry that's the
Downside of live radio is that I can't
You know say oh hold on guys we're gonna stop
While I go fix this
Alright uh let's move on Loki
Uh Valve has started the
Beta for the Steam Family
Sharing program so the first
Thousand people that
I guess were uh invited
Were sent invites this week
Um through email or
Hopefully through the actual
Messaging through Steam because if
It's through email I didn't fucking
Get that because I get so much spam
It's ridiculous
Thousand messages today um
So yes and then of course you know
Uh the Steam Sharing
Program allowed you to share your
Library with up to ten people and of course
Only one person can use it at a time
And it's a fun way to try out
Games so um
Yeah so once I get
Mine going because I am playing a lot of
Uh a lot
A lot of uh
I will probably have to
Add people to my Steam sharing
Things so that maybe Bobby can play
The legit copy of Saints Row 4 and get
Those achievements
Yeah I'm waiting for mine to come into
Play Saints Row 4 I'm waiting for mine
To get enabled too so I can uh
Do some of that sharing and test that out and be fun
So alright well
Moving on one more story for you guys for the classic
Game of the week and this is about uh one of the
Few animes I used to watch years and
Years ago oh your favorite Rob
Pokemon that's right
Yay you know as much as I razz the
Series and give Shane a hard time for being such a
Fan of the series um you know on Horde House
And so forth I actually like legit used
To love the old school Pokemon anime
Uh uh this is way
Back when I was in college I mean this thing is like years
Old right? Do you remember when I brought my VCD
Of the Japanese version of the movie over?
I do I do that was great I remember going
To see the first movie in the theater
I went with you
You saw a later one with me because I
Now I went and saw the very first movie with my friend
Amanda little old Amanda
It's too bad Seg's not listening he knows her very well
But Amanda and I went to
This this movie the first
Movie we were the only people in the largest
Auditorium in the theater so what
Did we do we were screaming our heads
Off mimicking all the Pokemon we
Had the we had the best time ever
It was so fun but anyway
Um the important thing to talk about news
Wise is that Pokemon
Origins is coming to
The west uh this was an anime
That is a whopping four episodes long
But it will launch on
November 15th in the Pokemon
TV mobile application
This tells the stories of the very
First Pokemon games Pokemon red
And blue I thought that looked like red
From the original uh 96 game boy
Or excuse yeah 96 game boy
Um the protagonist
Named red will travel
Through the Kanto region and uh
Get into trouble with team rocket
Battle his rival and challenge
The Pokemon league also Pokemon
The movie Genesect and the legend
Awakened will air later this month my
God how many Pokemon movies have there been at this point
They only ever did what like
Four of them in theaters I only cared about the
First one I know right like well
The second movie was also
Great because if for nothing else
For the line where Jesse and
James from team rocket Jesse goes
The opposite sex is nothing but trouble
And then James goes that's why I stay out of
That kind of trouble and
Laughed my head off and that happened
It's on YouTube somewhere go check it out
There you go Pokemon origins
I'm kinda I'm kinda thinking
I might have to try it we'll see
See how much it costs for the record I like
Digimon better
Okay alright
I would say let's travel back to a time when
Pokemon wasn't around but
There were plenty of Pokemans around for this
Yeah thanks to the uh
Rule change invoked by dark soccer
Last week ten years ago
There was still plenty of Pokemans
And plenty of classic
Classic video games that are as
Old as this show Old as balls
Are you saying this show is old as balls?
Probably
Well here it is the classic game of the week
Dark Sakura
Now that you can rip open the
The PlayStation 2 era
Even though it was pointed out to me on Twitter you already did
When you picked the mosquito game
Yes I did I've done other
But whatever whatever
I've done newer games than this too now that I think about it
But here it is the classic game of the week
Dark Sakura what did you pick?
I'm going with Kingdom Hearts
Well thank you I appreciate that
And everybody else who bought the HD version
Even though I go wait a minute like when this game
Came out
I remember playing this when it was new
And I think we were doing OLR
Yes
This game came out eleven years ago
Oh god
I was still in my twenties
Because
Fuck a bunch of that
I love this music by the way
It's the Trevor's Tale music
I freaking love it
So anyway it was
Kingdom Hearts
And as we know it's an action role playing
Game put out by Square at the time
Now Squeenix
It came out on PS2 in 2002
And it was
A collaboration between Squeenix
And Walt Disney
Because we have lots of Squeenix characters around
And lots of Disney characters around
It's like the two universes had
A very cute baby
A very cute kind of fucked up baby
Um
And so this one for Square
To have done so many
Regular RPGs you know their standard
JRPG format
This was a little bit of a departure
To be a lot more
Action oriented
And in my case it was a lot more
Oh my god Donald
Knock the fuck off I don't need healing
Just saying that was the common
Thing you would hear at my house
The really great thing about it too
Is that a lot of
The character designs were done
I'm sorry the
Director of the game was Tetsuya Nomura
Who had done a lot of the character
Design in Square games
Had a fantastic
Voice cast I mean
Even though at the time I think it was
Like right at the height of the Haley
Joel love
And what actually has impressed
Me is that he's still voicing Sora
He can still make himself sound that young
He's you know
Aged a bit still kind of a cute
Cute dude but
I like the fact that he is that
Talented as a voice actor that he can
Still sound so young
Um it had lots of
Fun cut scenes I mean you had
Your Final Fantasy 8
Characters hanging around you had
The Sephiroth
Thing was pretty fun you had
Your
Squall hanging out or I'm sorry
Lillian Hart
And you would get little nods
I wouldn't necessarily call them Easter eggs
But you get little nods um
To other Square games and to
Different Disney franchises
And it was pretty fun
You know and I'm not even going to go much into
Kingdom Hearts 2 because you know that of course
Like is newer
It had the Tron level which was amazing
But
This game was just awesome except for the
Gummy ship which was like my least favorite part
I hated navigating the gummy ship
And I kept saying why is it a gummy ship
When there's no gummy bears
I mean hello
So as far as
You know your characters you've got
The main character Sora you have his buddy
Riku and uh Kairi
And
And for the record
At depth I knew how to set up Donald and he was
Still a ship
So basically you
Team up with Donald and Goofy
To find King Mickey
And uh your main character
Is the main uh
Antagonist as Ansem and the Heartless
So
This game has spawned so much wank
So much wank
But other characters that show up in there I mean
You've got um
You know 101 Dalmatians characters for a side quest
You have um
You know major Disney villains in the game
You've got you can summon different
Characters too like you have the genie
You have Tinkerbell you have Simba from the Lion King
Other characters that you ran into
From square games you have Tidus and Waka
And Selphie and you have
Like I said Squall you have Aerith
What the fuck was she doing in the game?
Cid and Yuffie um
Not dying much to your dismay
I know. Riku from Final Fantasy
Uh 10 was supposed to show up
But was replaced by Yuffie
Um you have the Cloud and Sephiroth
Uh showdown in the Olympus Coliseum
So much really good stuff
And the story itself is so rich
That they seem to really
Plan on there being more than one
You know they were really looking ahead
But um
I just I can't say enough good about this game
It was really amazing
And basically
The way that this came about
Was that there was a discussion
Between Shinji Hashimoto
And um Sakaguchi
About Mario 64
Where they wanted to do like a three
Dimensional movement
Um but they said they could only
The only way to rival a Mario game would be
To have Disney behind it
And Nomura overheard the conversation
And actually
Uh led the way to start
Building the game and then there was
A meeting between Hashimoto and a
Disney executive
In an elevator
Where they were in the same building in Japan
And magic was made
So they brought it together
It's got fantastic
Music, fantastic voice cast
Both and I have to say
Both the um the English voice cast
And the Japanese voice cast
Were top notch after
Hearing them in both
And then getting Utada Hikaru to do
Um the uh main song
Both in uh Japanese and English
Although honestly I think the Japanese version is
Better I think there was a lot more production value
Um
And like there's some of the voice cast that they
Couldn't get for the American one like um
They couldn't get Robin Williams
They had um
I can never pronounce this guys name properly
Dan Castellaneta
Uh he's Homer Simpson yeah
Yeah I can never pronounce this
Castaneda or something like that
Billy Zane and David Bourne
Well they got the guy who plays
A really down on himself
Guy to play another really down on himself guy
I think though that isn't he also the voice
Though in like the second and third movies
He was in the TV show
Because after Robin Williams had the falling out
With uh Disney over
Aladdin uh he stepped
In and did the voice uh Robin Williams
Came back and did the third movie though
When they all kissed and made up
At any rate you know
They got really
Really top level voice talent
I mean sometimes when you get an RPG
In Japan
They'll have top notch voice actors
Behind it there but we won't
Get as big names there this is
Probably one of the first to have really
Significant talent
Put into a game you know
I mean of course with Disney and Square behind it
You'd expect them to put in that kind of
Uh production value
And I don't think anybody
Was disappointed by this game if anybody
Was then they're wrong
I can see though when you put it next
To Kingdom Hearts 2
Kingdom Hearts 2 was you know fixed a lot of
Problems with the first one with the camera
And so forth
And this was um stated
As um the runner up
For the PS2 um
Best game of 2002 reader's choice award
Let's see what the first one was
Um
Gamepro said that the battle system
Was like the N64 Zelda games which
Honestly I thought was really good
And then there were actually
Plenty of comments um compliments
For the AI with Donald and
Goofy and it really was very
Customizable I would just always get irritated
Because sometimes Donald would do shit
The wrong time it doesn't get any better in the HD
Version just letting you know
Donald's still his stupid head but there's um
The final mix that came out that had
Um a little bit
More stuff thrown in and there was also another
Side another story the deep dive
That had uh
Bonus stuff that you would get um
There's a manga around it
There you know like you said there was the uh
The uh HD version
And there's all kinds
Of side games that have spawned
From this that are all a rich
Part of this world that's been created
Around the game so
I really like
When you have something
Big come out and then
Have it be a success
And then have such a really
Beautiful story around the whole thing
And there's still a lot we don't know
Like you remember how everyone went oh shit
When everyone saw you know
Riku blindfolded in the
Organization outfit and everyone was like ahh
And then the little ending for
Two where everyone was in the whole
Keyblade graveyard
I saw an amazing Google doc
That was like 50 pages long that was trying to
Explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts
And I was like and it's for kids
But it spawned that much
Fan involvement and when you've got
When you can build
A dedicated fan base like that
You know you've really got something important
And special so
Kingdom Hearts is really I think one of the
First games that
Spot several different levels of fandom
Together and I think
That's a pretty monumental event too because
Usually fandoms are like bitch please
Alright
Well there it is guys your classic game of the week
Kingdom Hearts
On the Playstation 2 but of course as we all
Know now on the Playstation 3
With the whole HD version which
In our chat room ShadowNextGen points
Out Rob I heard they fixed the
Camera for Kingdom Hearts 1 in the HD
Remix on Playstation 3
It's better but I still get frustrated with it
To be honest but I gotta
Admit Kingdom Hearts has really been on the back burner
Since I've been grinding in Final Fantasy 14
Now that I finally hit end game and maybe that'll
Calm down a little bit I'm hoping to go
Back and play more Kingdom Hearts
And another good thing is that I have to
Say that it gave Utada Hikaru
Some really really good exposure
Here in the US
She's had several albums now in the US
Two
Well I think she had two and then an EP
I don't think so I think it was just the
One that Timbaland produced and then
The comeback to me
Her best of from Japan is on the US store
Ah that might be what it is
But at any rate I freaking love her voice
Alright there you go the classic game of the week
We're running long tonight so we're gonna
Go right into our break don't go anywhere guys
Though we'll be back with plenty more of
Orange Lounge Radio right after this
Welcome back everybody to
Orange Lounge Radio
Live on this Sunday night
September the 29th of 2013
The 521st
Episode of our show already in
Progress and unfortunately
Those of you that listen on the podcast don't get to
Hear the music that we play during the break while we
Get up and stretch and refill our drinks
And so forth during the break but we had
A fun little background medley from
Kid Icarus that played in the break there and it just
Reminded me how much I love the music
In Kid Icarus and how it puts me in such a good mood
Even though that game is fucking hard
It is fucking hard but I still
Like to go back and play it once now
I may not be able to play it from start to finish all in one
Sitting but I can at least get through the
First world terror danger horror
You picked up Uprising right?
I did
You know and that game like hurt my hand
So much to play I never really made
A lot of progress in that I enjoyed it
But I kind of wish they would do it on Wii U
That would be a great game that they could put out on Wii U
Didn't they say they originally had
A console version
Yeah they had a Wii U version
Alright
Well anyway let's get into some rapid
Fire gaming news and talk about some
Things that will be happening unlike
Kid Icarus on Wii U
So there was an ARG
That was tied with Surgeon Simulator
That has now finally been cracked
It was a secret code that you would put
In the zero gravity surgery
Mission
And you would get sucked outside of your
Ship and now you have
A brand new set
Of surgeries you could do on an alien
In zero gravity with alien
Tools and they have you do all
Sorts of like weird
Sorts of like gobble shaft
Transplant and you're like what the fuck's a gobble
Shaft
It's pretty funny
So check that out if you have Surgeon Simulator
There's actually videos out there that show you what the access code
Is and you can do all that
So yeah and then of course
There's the second season
Of Mortal Kombat Legacy
Ten episodes
I guess they were all released at one time
It's being hosted by Machinima
If you may remember it was that live action
Series that came out around the time that
The last Mortal Kombat game came out
And so yeah if you want to check it out
It's on YouTube, Machinima
And ten episodes for
Your digestion
And last but not least
Rockstar put out some information about
Grand Theft Auto Online which launches this
Tuesday on the first
Well bumpy launching on the first
May or may not launch on the first
Launching in an MMO sense
Will be stable by mid-October
Yeah um okay so
Basically they were talking about some of the stuff
And answered some of the rumors that were going around
Confirming that there will be
Not really microtransactions but there will be
Some sort of online transactions to purchase
In-game money so they have that
However they prefaced
That with you will be able to play
The game and it's been balanced for
People playing you know the game
Regularly and you won't actually have to buy money
If you don't want to but if you want to just
Get ahead you know buy your fast
Cars and better weapons and
Crib or whatever
By all means go ahead and do that
Some of the stuff that they announced that
They're going to be doing with that
They're going to be
Including some different
I guess activities
Jobs they have
Sports you can do you know tennis
And all that kind of stuff that's normally in the game
Also
They're going to be putting out some free
Content at launch
The content creators for deathmatches and races
Also a beach bum pack
Which is going to have 300 items
Like you know
Customization items for your
Characters as well as
I guess
Weapons
Capture the flag is going to be coming back
And they're also going to have a content creator
For that and they'll be
Introducing heists
So that's going to be pretty sweet
And 700 missions
I think is what they teased before
Are going to be available online
Compare that to 69
That are in the single player game
That's pretty significant
And
People have actually dug through the files
And a couple things that have been confirmed
Of course they have
Drug dealing you'll be able to do in the game as well
As betting on horses at the track
So
Hurray do you get to whip the horses though
Like you do in derby owners club
I don't know about that
That's a game I haven't played in forever
I miss that game
Seriously I mentioned again
We do have the vog network crew
That you can join
You can go check out the forums
We have the link to that
Otherwise I believe it's
socialclub.rockstargames.com
Slash
Crews slash vog network
Alright sounds like if you search for
Vog network you'll find
You'll probably find yeah
Vog network or the
I don't know if you can search by the
The four letter initials we have
Vog N
Sounds good
Traveling around to some other news
In kind of the WTF department
There's a really weird promotion
Between the developers flying wild hog
And volition
Because of I guess the publishers devolver
Digital and deep silver
But there's a cross promotion between
Shadow warrior and saints row 4
What is said promotion
Why I'm so glad you asked
Because in shadow warrior
You will be able to unlock
If you own saints row 4
And you own shadow warrior on steam
You'll unlock the penetrator weapon
In shadow warrior
That's right the purple dildo bat will be yours
To slaughter the enemies
I love that it has balls
In the ancient japan setting
That is shadow warrior
You play a character named wang
So I mean it's fitting
I know it's just silly
But you know anything involving
Saints row usually is
I'm just completely
Unused that it has balls
Do you want me to bring up the balls again
So you can giggle some more
I'll have you know though
It only had balls
Over here in this region
And in europe
It did not have balls in japan
Where I believe it was censored
And it didn't have the wiggle physics
In japan either
So silly what they have to change
From region to region
Almost everyone try a game like
Rocksmith 2014 which of course
Is the newest rocksmith game
More of a cult level music game
Because it's not pushing
Plastic buttons to instruments
Well I guess it is in a way
But you're actually learning to play
The actual guitars
It's kind of what sets rocksmith apart
So it definitely has it's following
If you weren't already aware
There is a new version coming this year
It's rocksmith 2014
There is a guitarcade
Which was also in the first rocksmith game
But you play games
That are retro inspired
For example there is a game like ducks redo
Which is basically galaga
But it can't actually be galaga
Because Ubisoft didn't make galaga
So you know there is all those issues there
Some of the other guitarcade items
Excuse me games that are available for playing
Scale racers
And gone wailing
In scale racers you will master scales
Avoiding traffic in a police car chase
And gone wailing will
Make you play louder or quieter
To elevate characters
And collect coins
And lastly there is return to castle
Core dead
Which is a first person shooter
Where you strum chords to kill enemies
Cute I like that
That's very similar to this
Not very popular game that came out
For the guitar hero controller
It was rock of the dead
I saw that the last E3 I went to
Anyway
I like that they use cute little arcade
Games as kind of like a way to
Make the game a little more
Gamey I guess as opposed to
A tutorial or what have you
That's pretty cool
It almost does make me want to learn to play guitar
Just a little bit
I know I have room in my house
For this and I will probably pick this up
At some point
It's Ubisoft's Just Dance 2014
The song list is out for the game
For Just Dance 2014
You have a lot of newer favorites
Like Applause by Lady Gaga
Pound the Alarm by Nicki Minaj
Gentlemen by Psy
That's a good song
Let's see even Ricky Martin's back
With Maria, Where Have You Been?
By Rihanna
Oh god that horrible
Blurred line song by Robin Thicke
That song needs to be removed from everything ever
He needs to be removed from everything ever
It's just a bad song
In better news, Flash Dance
What a Feelin' by The Girly Team
Sadly it's a cover
YMCA is there
Attention Beliebers
The Will.I.Am song
That Power, which features Justin Bieber
Is in there too
Gamebooey.org will be happy to know
Kesha is in the game with Come On
I do love Kesha
Kesha is so fun
In such a guilty pleasure way
For those of you that like more basic singers
Katy Perry is in the game with
I Kissed a Girl
And if you like your musicals
Prince Ali from Disney's Aladdin is in the game
What the fuck? That's random
How random is that?
Like a holdover from Just Dance Disney
I have no idea
And one of the songs
of the summer, Get Lucky
by Daft Punk
Everybody likes that song
I like this song, David Guetta with
Wolf falling to pieces
But you know what? All of these songs
All of them, shit
They are trumped
They are just nothing
With the inclusion of this song
Gimme, gimme, gimme
A Man After Midnight by ABBA
It's all you need, fuck the rest of it
Fuck the rest of it
End quote
I still want to boycott any game that has that asshole in it
Nope
I can't
Unfortunately, Dark Sakura, ABBA
Trumps that song
I have to, sorry
Think about it
If you think about it, Dark Sakura
I don't think ABBA could even
Now Rob, Rob
What?
Did you ever pick up ABBA, You Could Dance for the Wii?
I did
You should have seen Rob
do freaking ballerina spins
I wish I had
I wish I had been recording it
Because Rob's like, I've got the ABBA game
You need to come over
And I'm sitting back in this chair
That no one can see me point to
Except for us in this room
Thankfully this was before game streaming was a thing
Like that was a couple years ago
And Rob's like, look what I got
And I did the winner takes it all
For Jamie
I don't want to talk
Oh and remember you bringing
Singstar ABBA over to my house when
Tiara was over?
There right next to Singstar Queen
That is like the best shelf in my entire house
Rob you're so cute
I'm just saying
But remember it was
You, me and Tiara playing
Singstar ABBA
And you made me sing
I miss her
She's in Arlington now
Well I still miss her
Yeah it's really hard to hit that far away
Alright also
Just going to throw this out there
Another quick little thing for Just Dance 2014
Which apparently also includes One Direction
But anyway
That's not what I wanted to say
What I want to say is that the 2014 bundle for the Wii U
Will come packaged with a Wii Remote Plus
Which is interesting
Because you know
It's the Wii U
Yet it's a Wii peripheral
But if you think about the way Just Dance works
It's not like you're going to be sitting there with a game pad
Dancing to Gimme Gimme Gimme
Also because if you buy a Wii U
System you technically
Could get away with not having a Wii Remote
Because you might be playing games with a game pad
I don't have a Wii Remote Plus
I never
And the game does require it
I'm going to get shit for this but I never played Skyward Sword
So I didn't have one
Neither have I
And the game does require it so yeah that's why
Exactly
So you can get that for 70 bucks
The bundle that has all of that
You can get the game separately for $40
If you have
Wow they significantly reduced the price
Oh wait no they didn't
It's actually a full price controller so fuck them
Just buy a used one seriously
Oh you, alright
Dark Soccer what do you have for us?
Not Abba
Well
For the Super Smash Brothers
Roster we have a new addition
We have Wind Waker Link
And all of his adorable cuteness
And I believe he's
Going to be on both versions
Also with his adult incarnation
As well
So fun
Mighty No. 9 is also coming out
For the Vita and the 3DS
It basically reached the goals
For those so you know what
If I get it I'll get it on 3DS
I don't think it's reached those goals yet
Well no
When it reached 3.5 million
But it's pretty close I think
I don't know they've only got two days left
They might not hit it
I still haven't put in money yet though
I'm still pretty sure it'll be on there
And in other news
Mega Man X is getting a compilation soundtrack
It's coming
There's a listing for
The
Let's see, Rockman X
Soundbox on Rakuten
So it looks like it's gonna
Be out for wow it's expensive
12,600 yen so basically
27 bucks
A lot of money. Someone get that for me and rip it
No
Yes
Actually I have a game on my list Rob
That I need to have
Shut up phone
Rob is playing with his phone
During the show everybody
There's like a lot of people out there
That still don't realize I do a show
On Sunday nights
My mom knows I do a show on
Sunday
Anyway
Moving on let's go to the FUGL question of the week
Every week we go to our Facebook
Community and our Google Plus community
And if you slam those words together you get
FUGL and it's the
FUGL question of the week
Except I don't have my music
Where's my music?
Dark Soccer you took my music
No
That's not good
I didn't take your, I did not, Rob
Rob Rob Rob
I'm so prepared. See getting these messages
On the phone and everything just like
Threw me off
I didn't do shit
You don't know shit
You know what we need to sit down and watch showgirls
With a bunch of crap food
We do. Good times
Anyhow, here we go
Did you find it yet? Yes I found my bumper. Here we go
Here it is
The FUGL question of the week
We went with the obvious this week
With a lot of folks talking about the steam machine
And all the related stuff
What do you think about Valve's announcements this week?
Steam OS, Steam Machine and the Steam Controller
Let's start with Andy R
Who says the controller looks like it'd be stupid
But I do want to try it
And I'm pretty happy with my current PC
I'm not sure if any of the machines will appeal to me
I'll wait until we have more concrete details
Machine specs, prices and so on
Until I pass further judgement
Signed up for the beta thingy though
At least a passing interest
Tigerclaw says I think Steam OS is perfect
For those that like to build a home theater
And PC in a small form factor
With a good graphics card
And play their Steam games on the HDTV
That presents a lot of opportunities
And there are those that want to play those Steam games
But don't want to cough up so much money to build a gaming rig
The Steam Machine will be perfect for first time PC gamers
It'll be interesting to see what they can do
With the Steam Controller
The fact that it has no thumbsticks
But uses touchpad technology
That the controls are given the tech is the kind
You'd find in laptops
Which is often not very responsive
Excuse me, responsive to touch
Katsuhiko J says
The controller is something different for a change
I need to try it before I pass judgement
Who knows, it could be the next best thing
Valve made a bold move this past week
I'm interested in their OS
Chris C says
I think spec wise
The hardware of the Steam Console would have to be on par
If not more powerful
Than current consoles to pique my interest
I like consoles because
Games are tailored to the specific console
And no major tweaks have to be made
To get a seamless experience
If the specs beat out the Playstation 4's
I might be sold
Red The Haze left us with this too long didn't read version
But you can read his full answer on Facebook
It says
It will unify hardware manufacturers and software devs
To make similar specs
Which will mean better products for the consumers
Hmm, I like that perspective
Ciel says
The Steam OS has my interest
I'm not much of a controller
I'm not much of a controller, I think I'm a controller person
But I'd like to give it a shot
The one thing I didn't see that I wanted was prices
The Steam Machines may have multiple price models
The OS is free
But surely they have an ideal on the controllers
I can't shut up and give you my money Gabe
If you don't tell me how much you desire
It's like the third person I've seen say
We need a price
Unfolded Raptor said
I'm not being involved with the Steam Machine
Nor was I told about the song being integrated into the OS
So no sell for me
Yet
Ragenator says
It's kind of difficult for me to comment so early in the game
Given that I don't know too much on the stuff
I did see a picture of the controller
My initial reaction was that it looked like an unwieldy turd
But hey, if I can get my hands on one with the Steam Box
And give it a try
I may end up liking it
Andrew G says
That's actually 23rd Magus
Working
Well, he needs to work his way on over here
To a Sunday night show
The Gabe Cube
The Gabe Cube looks promising
For those who would rather not self build
But that's a niche already filled by traditional consoles
Time will tell
Some of the answers here from PeegerJunior92 says
I think it's a logical step forward for Valve
And they seem to have a number of the important points
That users were hoping for
The controller is definitely a new concept
And something that people will have to get their hands on
To really understand how it will work
My biggest qualm is that there was no reason
For this to be a drawn out three stage announcement
It would have been a great all in one announcement
And people would have been happy
CodeMan says
Honestly, it's nothing that a well put together PC can't do
And yes, it would probably be cheaper than a beefy gaming PC
But I'm not sold yet
I just feel like Valve is just a bit too late to the tea party
And Eddie K says
If Half Life 3 isn't a launch title for this new console
I'm not buying one
And let's see
Going to Google Plus
We have actually a few answers on Google Plus this week
We usually don't have this many
Let me start with Travis H who says
Speechless with excitement
Flaco Jones says
I think SteamOS is cool but as for the Steam Machine itself
There was nothing to convince me I should buy that
Instead of just running SteamOS on my PC
As a partition or however it would work
The controller looks like it would not work for me
Just seems like I would have to tweak it for every individual game I play
ActDef says
Anyone who didn't see this coming after the living room announcement page
And the family sharing option
Well, need to use logic more
Alright, hold on ActDef
That is so easy to say in retrospect
But why didn't you call the 1, 2, 3 last week then, huh?
I could see at least the SteamBox
And maybe the SteamOS
Yeah, I kind of thought that the SteamBox announcement
Would have been kind of combined with
Actually, like they said before
It pretty much could have been all one announcement
You didn't really need to separate
Yeah, like the guy on Facebook said
It could have just been all one
But anyway, my opinion about the whole thing
Is that Valve and Steam are aiming high with this
They're making the Steam Machine pretty much an entertainment console
Like the Xbox One and the Playstation 4
And since they're developing their own OS for it
And yeah, I know it's Linux based
But still, it'll be able to do lots of stuff
And cost effective too
Not to mention being able to stream all your library
In case your game doesn't support Linux
Going over to Evel, E3VL says
From what I see, the SteamOS
Is basically countering Windows
As in the future, Windows will most likely become a closed system
Like Apple's App Store
SteamOS is essentially an open system
Like Google Android
Very interesting comparison
Let's face it, with tablets and smartphones going where they are now
No one needs PC laptops in the future
Aside for gaming
SteamOS is basically the Trojan horse of gaming PCs
In the future
The problem with the SteamOS I think is availability
Current PC gamers may adopt it
But Steam is lending out the OS for third party vendors
To create Steam Machines
It might be a problem and quite possibly a huge gamble
Depending on how their hardware is marketed
And priced relative to consoles
It's a really interesting comparison
The other thing I worry about loaning out the SteamOS
To third party developers
Like you get those companies like Alienware
And stuff that add all of their apps and stuff in there
You get the junk programs with a brand new PC that you buy
I don't even know if they still have the AOL trials
And stuff like that
I used to have all that
But with Dell
You get that a lot
Even with my ACES
There's a lot of ACES programs in there
I'm just worried I'm going to get all of that bogged down
In the SteamOS
And it's just going to be like a Windows PC again
And lastly, Retertainment says
The SteamOS seems to be tailored for people who have
Or want to have a PC that is only used for gaming
Problem is most people don't use their PC like that
Most people have PCs
They use for work, music, movies, games
And general dicking around on the internet
Also porn
If people want a device that is only for video games
They buy a console
I didn't really look at this
No not really
Alienware has made a whole market around gaming PCs
Hold on
Porn
Advanced Haptic Feedback
That they have with that
Advanced Haptic Feedback
And lastly, Retertainment says
The rest of his answer here
I didn't really look at the Steam Machine or the Steam Controller
As I do not plan to make any major purchases
Until I accomplish Project Buy-A-House
And in fact
It has a little touch screen on there
You could probably stream porn to that
While you play Team Fortress 2 or something
You can watch porn and play Team Fortress 2
First thing I do when I'm getting my Oculus Rift someday
Porn
Alright
Moving on
Let's get back into some longer news here
And we'll get to the Skype line here
Hopefully before too long
1877 Game OLR
Or a username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio
But first, Loki
Alright, so there was an announcement this week
That first leaked out
And then they kind of made their own announcement
Something coming to Xbox One
Is Xbox Fitness
Which is an app that uses Kinect
And what's kind of cool about it though
Is it has a bunch of different fitness programs in there
Including Insanity
And I want to say P90X
Is one of the other ones that's in there
But all sorts of different trainers
It is kind of interesting though
Because I guess
The app will be free for Gold members
Through December 2014
Although it says there's some additional content
That you can purchase for it
And I guess in 2015
Unlimited access will also require
A separate Xbox Fitness subscription fee
As well as Xbox Gold
But
For those people that are really into fitness and stuff
And you know
I want to say it because I had co-workers that
Did the Insanity stuff
That DVD says fucking expensive
So if they've got that built in there
That's pretty cool
Especially if you're kind of a fitness
You know, enthusiast I guess
Health junkie
Yes, and it's probably a little better
Than was it that
Xbox
The Nike one that they had last year
That was kind of lame
This looks a little bit along the lines of
Kind of what they were trying to do with that
Because they were showing you it measures your heart rate
And all those features that they were touting before
But
Might be cool
Some of the trainers to be noted
Jillian Michaels, Tracy Anderson, Tony Horton
Sean T
Kind of cool I guess
Not really my thing because
You know
I eat hamburgers
Yes
No no no not today, you had chicken nuggets
That's true
Here's the thing though about
Xbox Fitness, don't we already have
A million fucking fitness games on the Xbox
I mean I know this is for the new one
But doesn't the Kinect
Need to get out of this rut of dance
And fitness games, like show me something
New
Technically yeah, I mean there's about one or two every year
I mean there's Zumba, there's a new Zumba game this year
But there's only really about
One maybe
Two fitness games a year for
The Xbox 360
And Kinect
Actually I think it's been about one a year
So it's not a ton
But yeah I mean
Those are really the only games
That kind of effectively use the Kinect
Everything else that's tried to use the Kinect
Has been kind of crap
So I don't know
But yeah they're saying
Different workouts I guess
I guess from ten minutes to
One hour
They're going to have little routines that you can do
And stuff, I'm assuming this is tracked across
All the different
Ones you have, metamorphosis
They've got that in there as well
Ripton 30 from Jillian Michaels
So I don't know if you've got a
Fitness program that you're really into
But see once again though like Insanity
Unless you're one of those people that just borrowed
That set or something
Like if you already have it
You've probably already paid like a couple hundred bucks
For it
You're probably not going to need this
I don't know
S2100Matt in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
Has a good point
The fitness things sell really well
They won't stray too far from a cash cow
And if you think about it though
You're probably paying for gold to play
Online multiplayer so
Why not? Check it out
Might be cool
Alright well moving on to other
Features on the Xbox One
The game DVR will work on Xbox Live
At launch but YouTube and Facebook
Sharing won't be enabled until 2014
So here's what game DVR
Does
Game DVR will save the previous five minutes
Of gameplay if you use a voice command
Xbox record
You can edit the piece in the upload studio
And then share it which would be
The YouTube Facebook thing later
These clips are saved in 720p
At 30 frames a second
Game DVR will only work if you
Have Xbox Live gold
So there you have it that's how it's going to work
That sounds dumb
Because it's saying that you have to do
Xbox record and then it records something
Whereas I like the PlayStation 4 one where
Well no because it says previous five minutes of gameplay
If you say Xbox record so my thought is
If something funny happens and you say
That you can go back and edit it in the studio
That's my thought so like if something
Really funny happens you have a chance to react and say
Xbox record and that way it'll save it
So you know if you are
Playing an online game and hilarity ensues
Or whatever or I'm playing
Slenderman and I have a really scary
Ah moment although that's not on Xbox
Five minutes is not fair I don't know whatever
For a first person shooter it's enough
But like if I'm recording an online match or something
It might be ten minutes long I mean
And then this isn't the solution
That's why I have my
External one I guess
Yeah there still will be a value in that
So there you go Dark Sakura
Sorry I'm critiquing that
Image
Okay first of all they have it like it's levitating
But it's at the wrong angle for the
Level of shadow that they have
The Xbox one picture that was on the article
You were just reading
Whoever does their press materials needs to like
Go back and relearn Photoshop or something
Levitating consoles are so
Like Playstation 3 I mean
It was the evil baby that made the console
Levitate or the levitating
Console that made the evil baby I don't know
So EA Sports
Has put out a statement saying
That they are no longer making college
Games
Basically the general manager Cam Weber
Um and
I'm sorry of American uh
Who
Basically the one in charge of all the American football games
Basically is saying that
The college sports games are going away
That's meaning the NCAA games
Um they're also
Which they themselves put out an announcement
That they're letting their license expire
In 2014
And EA is not pursuing it
So they are not going to be doing
Any more college football
As in American football and not the real football
That you actually play with your feet
Um and they
Are not doing any other
College games that basically
They're letting it go
Bye
And the rest of us are like
Whoopty shit
You know I'm surprised though because that does kind of suck
Because it was a pretty big
Revenue stream for them even though
There was a lot of
You know you have to remember
Like for me I'm always like
Okay but college football is
Like a way bigger deal in other places than it is here
Exactly and in July
It really is pretty much the biggest game
Only big game coming out
Now it's going to be this big dead area
Which hopefully will be filled with something else
I'm from Alabama
And the biggest thing in the universe there
Is the rivalry between the University of Alabama
And Auburn University
And I know people who will probably be
Well I want my game this year
You know
And um
There's all there is to do
In Alabama is college football
And eat crawdads
Just saying
So maybe they could
I don't know
Go to church
It's kind of disappointing but at first I remember
I thought they were just going to put out a college football game
And be like EA Sports college football drop the NCAA
Thing and just do whatever
You would think that they would do something like that
Where they just make a game anyway but
I think they have to go through the NCAA
Yeah
Well I don't know they
For example they didn't ever
You know
License the
You know look and
You know names of the players and now they're in this big lawsuit
Which for example
They just settle for 40 million dollars
So
I'll settle for 40 million
That's probably why you know they're not doing a college game
Because you know they got into trouble
And there was a whole lawsuit against them for
Using the likenesses of these different players
Without actually giving them any sort of compensation
For it
So now of course you know
40 million dollars how exactly it's going to be
Split up who knows but
Probably a big reason why they're not doing a college game
Uh yeah
I mean it sucks for the fans you know even though I
Say like well that isn't really a big deal around these
Parts I understand there are some and I don't even
Really play these football games to begin with if it's not
Like tech mobile but I understand
Where people would be upset
About this and it sucks for you know
That group that looks forward to these games
Every year I wasn't happy
When DDR died
Well all they would have to do is just
Give up some of their profits I would think
Couldn't they have just licensed the actual player
Licenses and
You know paid the extra money
Or you know that would be too
Uh honest and so they can't do that
How much would they have to have paid
For all of those individual players
Versus what they paid out in
Uh fees for
The settlement they do it for Madden
So I don't understand why they can't do it for NCAA
Or even NBA Live
They do it for all their other sports games
SSG100Matt in our chat room says they could do
Something like what 2K did to get football back
I'm sure they'll have something after all remember
They did they tried to do NFL Blitz
So they could have another type of football
Game hell they even
They even experimented a little with rugby
A while back but
Arena football even so I don't know
They could do some more
A Puppy Bowl game
Huh? There was already
Jerry Rice and Nitus
Dog football so that's right
On the Wii I forgot about that well
Because it was on the Wii
It just kind of fell in the fries clearance bin
With all the other late Wii games
Puppy Bowl party I can see Puppy Bowl
Nintendo get on that
Mhmm
These are uh yeah now that they have this team
Freed up they could make a Wii U game
Huh?
Haha
Yeah alright
Uh moving on uh here's a game
That uh I'm actually legit
Like really excited to play this game
South Park the Stick of Truth
Oh it looks awesome
Comes out on December 10th
For Xbox 360
PlayStation 3 and PC
And uh the pre-order bonuses
Uh the Ultimate Fellowship Pack
Four exclusive costumes
With special abilities Necromancer Sorcerer
Rogue Assassin Ranger Elf and Holy Defender
Uh December 10th
Will also see the release of
The Grand Wizard Edition
Which will be 80 dollars
That comes with the game
A figurine of Cartman as the Grand Wizard
A map of the Kingdom of South Park
And the Ultimate Fellowship Pack
So there you go the uh South Park
Stick of Truth game
Dark Soccer do you have any interest in this?
Huh?
It's gonna be awesome
Definitely gonna pick it up
I haven't thought South Park was remotely hilarious
Since ages ago
They I don't know they have their moments
Here sometimes yeah I have to admit though I haven't
Watched this trailer so can we take a moment
To look at this trailer? I guess
Is the audio gonna come through here at all?
Apparently
When evil rises
Don't let the brave prince's keys
There is only one
The new kid the new kid has a power
We have yet to understand
Who can save us
Step forward now
And fulfill your
And fulfill your
The audio on this is low sorry
You have some incredible ability
To make friends quickly new kid
I want you to go out into the neighborhood and find my
Oh
Oh yay Mr. Slaves in there
Mr. Slave has a finishing move
Where he jumps on one of the enemies
And it sucks them into his ass
Yeah it's a pain but
This is the kind of stuff you put up with
Living in a remote little mountain town
At least we don't have to deal with traffic
I don't know
Here's why okay here's why I'm looking forward
To the Stick of Truth because like
There really should have been another South Park movie
I don't think I have ever laughed harder
In the theater in my life
Imaginary fun land or whatever
That was like a three episode arc
Of the show
And it wasn't as nearly as fun
And it wasn't as nearly as good as the movie
So I kind of feel like this is like
The next closest thing we're getting
To like a new movie
And that was all in game
And it looks just like the actual
The actual show so
It'll be pretty sweet
Alright well
We would be usually moving on
To the mailbag at this point
Except we got Jack and Shit
And Jack left town
So let us use
This music as a little opportunity
To remind y'all that it is the show
Where every gamer has a voice
As long as you use it
Yes but if we can't hear you
Then you don't get one
I promise I will
At least pick one that I don't critique the grammar on
Okay? One
Mailbag all one word
That's M-A-I-L
B-A-G
At
OrangeSongsRadio.com
Word
Well the dot separates the Orange Songs Radio
And the com
Shut up
Alright
Bitch you didn't even
Love you mean it
Hearts
Alright so that's it then
No emails this week for us to read
Oh well
This next segment will just have to be doubled
To make up for the time
This is bad
Here is justice
Here is punishment
Here
This is fucked up
FUs of the week time
Okay I have a couple
FU to the asshole wasp
Which all wasps are assholes
But this one was extra
Asshole by inviting himself into my car
And poking his butt in my finger
That was really rude
And I'm really allergic
Thankfully I was at my friend's house and had access to them
So
Fuck you wasp
Fuck all wasps
The only good thing they do is eat plant destroying caterpillars
That's it
And there's other bugs that will do that too and birds
So fuck them
They're
Also
An FU to having certain illusions of
Mind shattered because I like to think
Better of my relatives
And then every so often they'll just
Say something that's completely dickish
And rude and
Racist and homophobic
And I'm like how did I
Turn out to be
Miss liberal socialist
Free thinker in California
Coming from that environment
Really how does that happen?
Or is it just that I was so overwhelmed with
The bullshit that I was like I need
To go and flew out of
Alabama with fire
Out of my ass or something I don't know
I just am completely baffled
How did this happen?
And also FU to
The bitch that wouldn't let me over
Even though I signaled for like
Ages and then every time
I'd speed up she'd speed up
The three people weaving in and out of
Traffic and the cop that didn't pull any
Of them over fuck all of them
Fuck them all and even though it's not
A fuck you because I'm PMS
Today so I'm just completely taking over this whole
Segment I would like to say
I was quite disappointed that the man selling the duck
Eggs was not at
What are you doing?
Just keep going
Okay well there's a guy who sells duck
Eggs at this farmer's market and I wanted
To buy duck eggs and
He wasn't there and I was disappointed
But Rachel bought a rabbit
A dead rabbit A wascley wabbit
A frozen dead rabbit Poor rabbit
Mmm rabbit's delicious So it was
Rabbit season and not duck season
Yes
Yes
It was rabbit season
Okay sorry this is what I was trying to cue up
Since you're having an extra angsty week Dark
Sakura
Yoo hoo
It's the PMS
March
Well I am legit
PMS-ing so F you
Two cramps TMI
You know what I don't care
Okay guys in the universe
Women get cramps
We get bitchy
Fucking deal with it
Don't use it as an excuse for every time we get bitchy
My brain has a cramp now
Good
Good
Now you know a degree of my suffering
My job has been done
Alright Loki
Uh F you too
Thanks to YouTube's content ID service
Which is so fantastic
That they- Hey did you know that you're using
Licensed music in your stuff
Accept this copyright claim
Or deny it
Or contest it I will choose option 3
Do nothing is what I will do
But it's great though because on one of the
Videos I did get that on
Or that flag on
Was one of the ones I used an audio swap
Thanks to YouTube You know YouTube allows you to
Audio swap it with some licensed music that they approve
Yeah I know it's licensed music because
You told me to use that music
Instead of the licensed music
They had in that before
Our pal Travis from understation live
Unfortunately deals with this a lot
Like if he
Even uses like a little bit of a song
In his like hour and a half long
Understation live that goes up on YouTube
They flag it that's why he had to change the intro
Of the show and I'm like come on
It's ridiculous
It's ridiculous and they scam that
So what would they do? They scan all these videos
And they just send it to these music people
So that they can just complain out
What they should do is just have a service that
You know if these lawyers
Or whoever find these videos that infringe
Upon it then yes they can do a copyright thing
The thing is I don't believe the copyright
That
Content ID thing is actually
A copyright claim by them
But it does sometimes block it
From mobile apps and stuff like I tried watching
My video on a mobile app and
You can't see it
There's a lawyer that's suing YouTube over that
Because YouTube pulled one of his videos
Where he was using a copyrighted thing
But it was under fair use
And he's like I'm a copyright lawyer
This was fair for me to do
So he's suing YouTube
It's a real pain in the ass
Seriously
Why should we keep catering to these media companies
And stuff I mean the stuff that people are doing
On YouTube for the most part is pretty harmless
And they're just making it fucking difficult
For everybody
That's it that's all I've got
So I don't know
Also
I'm a pretty sure F you for
Trying to figure out how to make this case for my
Controller thing because it's going to be fucking hard
And I'm thinking I may need to do
Vacuum forming plastic which is
Going to be dangerous because I have to build a rig
To cook it basically
I have to build an oven and then
Some sort of thing that I have to vacuum form stuff so
Alright that's all I got
My F you of the week just goes to the
Fact that there's a show in two weeks
Even though it'll be great I'm just like
Stress
Ah
But you know that'll pass like things
Usually do
Alright let's go back to
A few more news stories for you guys
Before we open up the Skype line
Loki
Alright so
We know that Sony is preparing their Gaikai
Service for the Playstation 4 to
Stream older Playstation
Games to the console since they don't
Have any sort of backwards compatibility
That's hardware based
But they're saying that hey you know what
We can actually use this to stream these games
To other consoles or other
Devices like PCs
TVs, Blu-ray players, smartphones
Tablets so
You know their ultimate goal
Is to be able to stream those
Things to other devices
It'd be kind of funny if you could play a
Playstation 4 game with an Xbox One
If they had some sort of website or something
You can go to the stream this stuff
That would just be
Ridiculous
Although you could hook up your Playstation 4 through
The Xbox One's HDMI
In
Create some sort of black hole of death
With that
I don't know
It'll be neat but once again we'll have to see
How this Gaikai service works once it
Does launch next year for at least
America
We can cross our fingers and hope it's worthy
Indeed
Indeed
Alright one more story for you guys and we'll open up the
Skyline and this is about actually I think
Loki kind of checked this earlier in the show but that's alright
I'll recap it for y'all
Anyway this is of course
Out of Orlando, Florida
Only in Florida people
Only in Florida
A nine year old boy made a court appearance
On school weapon charges
And was sentenced to home confinement
Officials said that the boy
Brought multiple weapons to the school
At Hunter's Creek Wednesday
And of course this is
Going to tie into video games eventually folks
Bear with me here
Officer searched the bag and found the handgun
Six bullets, a steak knife and a sledge hammer
The guns all came from the father's home
And the boy is ordered to
Home confinement and said the parents
Need to keep any and all weapons away from him
The boy's father
Said he was playing a character
He learned from a video game
Of course he was
Let's see
The nine year old boy told three friends before school
That he had the weapons
Those three reported the information to a school resource officer
Who found the student and isolated him
School officials said
Protocols were followed and authorities were called
In to investigate
Now nowhere in this original story does it say what the game
Actually was that he was trying to emulate
But it was Minecraft
Yes
Minecraft
Not Grand Theft Auto people
Minecraft
Which most people consider a pretty safe kind of game
And there really is no story to Minecraft
Aside from there's a guy named Steve
And there's zombies
I mean so
Yeah I don't know
It's
It's dumb
And there's no guns even in that
And I like how the boy's father
Oh he's just
He's just pretending
He's pretending to be in the game
Not oh why do I have all these guns available
So my nine year old can pick up a gun
You know and bring it to school
Yeah PacDeft in the chat room says
Irresponsible parents
We're not to blame it's the video game that teaches them
All the bad stuff
Yeah
And even so
Even if
They've allowed their child exposure to the game
They've also allowed their child exposure to the weapons
I want to know why CPS isn't involved
Okay
Um let's see
SSJ100Matt says please please
Someone hijack a horse and blame it on
Barbie's horse adventure
I'll do it
Or imagine horses
Amazing
I'll blame it on Derby Owners Club
And I'll name it Politary
And beat her
It's stupid though
It's like why do we even allow these excuses to
You know that's about as valid
Excuses like the voices in my head
Told me to do it
I mean come on if someone said that you're gonna be like okay that's ridiculous
But if like you know
Oh the video game told them to do it
Oh well that makes sense
Seriously what is wrong with people
He was a witch
Okay must be
Alright
That is it for our stories tonight
Please go to the skype line and open it up
1877 game OLR or our username on skype
Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to give us a call
And you can bring up anything we've talked about tonight
Or maybe there's something we missed
That you would like to bring up
Ikuma-san said blame it on the rain
That is
I think the most recent Milli Vanilli
Reference I have seen
In the last
I know the first reference to them I've seen
In maybe the last five years
Ever since that guy passed away probably
So there you go
Not even from this country
We do have a couple tweets
Not a whole lot of them but we do have a few
From I thought we had some earlier in the week
I can't remember
Alright sorry if I missed yours
Cause it was too early in the week
But we do have a couple from Tigerclaw tonight
One of them is that China will be ending
A decade long ban on game consoles
I had no idea that they have this ban in place
Cause I thought there were like knock off consoles
And stuff that they sold in Japan
Wasn't the V
Wasn't the V something they sold in China?
It was some sort of weird TV
Console things
I don't know what the restrictions were exactly
Well that in Hong Kong was
Not under Chinese authority
For the longest time
And why was the ban in place in China?
Communism!
Well there was concern for the effects that games
Might have on young people
But the group was persuaded
Because gaming on computers
And internet cafes has taken off across
China or whatever so
There will soon be consoles sold
As part of new rules in a free trade
Zone in Shanghai
Don't know when the consoles will go on sale
But there you go so
I don't know if that means
Xbox and Playstation 3
Necessarily but probably some
Like local gaming devices
There
They're talking about something called
Something based on the Xbox
But not called the best pad
That again from a tweet that
Tigerclaw sent us
And one other tweet here while we wait for some phone calls
At 1877 Game OLR
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio
One other article here from Tigerclaw
Says Nintendo teaming up with
Tesco for a Wii U
Fightback
Ah so
Let's see, Nintendo said
In an interview with MCV that too many people
Are unaware that the Wii U is a new
Console and they're going to do a
Giant campaign to educate people
Including Wii owners about this console
They've booked in-store space at
Tesco which is in the UK
Sending out a 5 page leaflet
To 300,000 Tesco customers
That have bought a Wii but haven't bought another
Console and give vouchers away
That will allow money off of games
There will also be TV ads for Mario
Donkey Kong and Zelda
Which will run continuously from half term
Until Christmas
I think they know, I just think they don't care
Yeah I don't think they really see
That must have game, but then there's
Mario and... I'm still irritated at
Tesco for selling fresh and easy
Yeah isn't that crazy?
I'm still getting the stupid emails from them even though I unsubscribed
So mad
Aren't they all closed now though?
No I think certain ones
Alright well that's... The one here is gone
That's it for Twitter topics, again I'll put
One more call out there for calls
1877 Game OLR
Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call
Loki do we have any last minute stories?
There's just a quick mod
That someone's working on
Right now for Team Fortress 2
That you can actually play Star Fox multiplayer
That sounds kind of fun
Yeah it's called Star Fortress
And it's in pre-alpha
And if you want to check it out
It's...
I think Greyman Gaming
Is the Steam community
Group that they have
With man of course two ends
Like Team Fortress game
So
That's it
That's it huh? Slow news week
Um
No calls coming in either
I don't know
What do we do guys?
Let's have a poker party
We're in the show
Yay forgot... You know what? You know what?
Pinkberry
I gotta go get Alan after work
Someone call
One more
One more holler out there
1877 Game OLR
Orange Lounge Radio
You know if you're one of those people that doesn't listen to the show live
You listen to us on like Stitcher
Or through iTunes podcast or something else
Don't forget you still can't interact with the show
We do want to hear from you
So don't forget to send us emails
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
Or Twitter tweets help as well
Looks like someone's going to be trying
I can't think of anything else video game related
Except
Blah
Hey look
Oh there it is it's lighting up
Let's go to the phones
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?
It is Ron but the one who has come to save the day
Apparently what's up with that?
Well what's on your mind Rama?
Oh you don't want to know
But um
Here's a question I've been meaning to call about
Let me get your opinions on this
Now we see how Nintendo makes all these remakes
And reboots and stuff like that
But this is something they haven't done
Why is it they haven't taken
Wario and Waluigi
And put them in a game and call it
Super Wario Brothers
I'm also surprised that hasn't happened
But wouldn't that just be like Wario's Woods or something?
Well they have that Wario Land shake it
Which was a hand drawn game that looked fantastic
And it was pretty fun
But no one bought it and it was on the Wii
Kind of along the lines of Rayman Legends almost
Who wants to play the bad guy?
Exactly you know
Me!
I want to be the villain
And if you think about Wario and Waluigi
Their abilities are different
So the game mechanics would be slightly different
But a little bit more fun to play
You know what actually on that token
If they really wanted to introduce
A Wario and Waluigi into a good platformer game
Why don't they do another one like
What we got a Super Mario 2
With Mario, Luigi, Wario and Waluigi
I like the sound of that
Nintendo call me
We'll talk
Your people can call me and pay me
What other dream Nintendo games do you have
Rama?
That was the only one
I don't know it just popped in my head
They have
Wario series of games
I guess at the time I was thinking about
One of my favorite Game Boy games
Which was Super Mario Land 3
And I'm like
Why haven't he done that?
You know what I think you just need your own
Mario is missing game except
In the sequel Luigi is like I know
Exactly
And also I really think they should
Put the Wii U out without the gamepad
Because honestly
Maybe three out of the four games
That are out on the Wii U doesn't even use
The gamepad
Some of them use it really well though
Zombie U is a great example of a game
That's really enhanced for that gamepad
So
I like the gamepad but
Honest to god
For me the gamepad
And all that thing that's less of a concern
Than I still feel there's a lot of
Clunky shit on Nintendo's online
And although I like
Miiverse I don't think it's
Particularly convenient it's kind of
Slow and the internet on Nintendo's system
Can still be clunky
I just still feel like where Nintendo
Is going online isn't really
Like where they need to be
And I just you know I still remain really
Irritated that Virtual Console
Isn't
What we ought to see on a modern gaming
Console you know what I mean
Exactly
So but those are just you know
What do I know I still have a Wii U
And you know there are the games I do have on it
I enjoy and I know I will like the
New Mario game and I know I'll love the new
Mario Kart and you know what whatever they continue
To do in 2014 that will you know
Justify owning the system but
It is a little frustrating to see all the third parties
Abandoning ship I just I think a lot of them
Are being dicks
You know you're
Right cause even though the Wii U isn't
As powerful I mean
You can get somebody else to take like a top tier
Title and shove it into that
Little hardware and somehow make it work
They make shitty little
Computers for kids that will play
Games and I see ports of games
From big companies that end
Up on these things so
LeapFrog is just a little device
That's powered by
Flash that's a Shockwave
Flash Console
Alrighty well Rama if that's it
I'm gonna let you go and see if anybody else wants to call
Awesome. Alright have a good one buddy
You too. Alright bye bye now
Alright
We'll leave it open for a little bit longer just in case anyone else
Wants to call in 1877 Game OLR
Or username on Skype
OrangeLoungeRadio
I just I just considered something
During that phone call so I was asking
Ikuma-san if he'd clear it up for me
Yeah
Waluigi I wonder if it would be
If it's supposed to be the name as a pun
For Warui which is bad
Probably
Probably
I would think that the wa part and Wario
And Waluigi definitely would
Have to do with things being bad
There's a lot of little puns that don't always
Necessarily transfer over
But anyway let's go to the phones
Cause we got another call coming in. Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio
Who's this?
Obi Wan Jibroni calling from the
United Kingdom
Oh my gosh
You are up late sir
I love your icon
Thank you very much
Also I want to say numero uno
On the leaderboard
Look at you yeah
You and Tigerclaw fighting to the death
On the VOG network leaderboards
Well you know what Sky I heard Tigerclaw
Likes being on top and that's okay
I think that was a little bit
That was a little bit of shade throwing here live
At OrangeLoungeRadio
All I can say is that Bobby and I are also tossing around
Some ideas to make the VOG game
Just a little bit sweeter in the future
But that's all I'll say for now
Awesome
Yeah my max has told me it's five
Hours
So what's on your mind buddy?
Well you know
There's been a lot of free to play
Games out there lately
There's been more free to play games than
They've fucked you know
So
I think this is a great thing because I'm 35 years old
Old gamer
Not that old
You're not that old
I'm older
You're a young lady
Oh I love you
I love you too
So
As we get older
As older gamers
I think we become more cheap
I mean
The 2DS
That's cool to me because
It's going to be cheap
It kind of looks kind of shitty
But I mean
The price
I think is going to appeal to a lot of older people
For cheap people
Like myself
I've got a 3DS at the minute
The original one
I've got a lot of friends
Who would be into that
The 2DS
Just because they don't want to spend the money
On the regular 3DS
But
I went off on a tangent
But yeah
Free to play is what I was going to mention
Sorry
This is my first time calling you guys
And as they say your first time is
That's alright
We'll go easy on you on your first time
The first time is a little rough
It wouldn't be OLR if there wasn't a gigantic tangent train
We're just all sitting here listening to your accent
So by all means talk away
And for the record I have several friends who've
Expressed interest in a 2DS for the same reason
Especially one of them that has problems with 3D
So just saying
Yeah exactly
And if anyone's out there
If I've been to my accent and whatever
Feel free to let me know on Twitter
Or the comments on VOG
So free to play games
Do you play any of them?
Oh yeah
I've been pimping the shit
Out of Tekken Revolution
That's right
That was your comment that got me to play that game
Yeah I've been pimping the crap out of it
And yeah I love it
And I don't know if you've played
The latest one
Of course
Is it Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate
Call of Fighters or some shit
I saw that but I haven't played it
But I'm looking forward to the Soul Calibur one
Yeah yeah
Because I'm a huge fighting game fan
But the Dead or Alive one is kind of cool
It's free gigs I will say that
But it doesn't have
The token system
So you can play how much you want
It's one of those games where
If you want the story part of it
You've got to pay for it
So it's kind of like one of those games where
It unlocks
Pay to unlock is what I mean
Yeah but it's cool
I mean you can play online too
So that's kind of fun
You don't have to pay to unlock
Booby mechanics though do you
Because it is Dead or Alive
I'm not sure
Tekken Revolution's
Kind of been taking over
I think
Pay to unlock is better
When you have the expectation that it's going to be
Pay to unlock
Instead of just
Oh well we have this DLC
No you just gave us a code
Yeah at least it's not double dipping
Yeah when you know that you've got to unlock it
Pay a little bit more then I think it lessens the blow
Yeah
And I think the story portion
Of that Dead or Alive is kind of expensive
So you might as well just go out
And buy the full game
Also I wanted to mention
That Ridge Racer game
Ridge Racer Driftopia or whatever
That's kind of
It's okay but like
I said in one of the comments before
I said when you crash
On the game it's like it's not game over
But you can keep carrying on playing
It's okay
But you know with that game
Every time I put it up now
It says server error
And I know you guys love this word
It's a beta
Or a beta wherever you live
We say beta obviously
I've heard beta
Yeah
This is okay it's not traditional Ridge Racer
In my opinion so I can't hear it
But it does have trophies
I keep forgetting there really are
A ton of free to play options on PlayStation
Right now
You mentioned one last week Rob called
You played a pinball free to play
That was called pinball stick
I was shouting at my pinball stick
I mentioned it again earlier tonight
Pinball is stick or something like that
Yeah I mentioned it again tonight
It's free
Hey
Yeah free is good
I mean you know
You gotta pay for handjobs or whatever these days
But I mean free
Free is good love it
I wish tech and stuff
On the Dead or Alive game was on
Xbox
But probably not gonna happen
But PS3 is okay I like the controller
I'm the minority who
Likes the PS3 controller
I love the PS3 controller
Need I remind everyone that Yaris
Was also free
Brad from
PodCulture also yelling out DC Universe
Is the best free to play on PS3
He's our DC fanboy
As far as MMOs go
It's way better than that free realms
Marvel Heroes is pretty good for
Steam
But it's Marvel and there's Jessica Jones in it
And I'm happy
I did try DC Universe
Took forever to download
My PS3 is on wireless
It took
Just like three days
It was a terrible experience
It took up so much space
I mean
The PS3 is a great system
But there's annoyances
It's really ridiculous
I can't just plug in a USB drive and copy
Some of my files over to that
I can copy save games
But I'm not getting any space by copying
Save games to my drive
Or send over
Some of these really large games
To play off the drive
Anyway Obi-Wan, Jabroni
It's so good to hear from you
That icon you have
That Dark Soccer loves
I just want to make sure all the listeners hear this
It says keep calm and defeat Psycho Mantis
With a PlayStation 1 console
Well thank you for pleasuring us all with your voice
Yes
It's a PlayStation 1 console
Plugged into the port 2
If anyone gets that reference
Also can I say one quick thing
Before I go
Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection
Bye bye bye
For everyone
Because I'm a huge MGS fan
Everyone knows I follow me on Twitter
Basically
Please stay super exclusive
But holy shit, value for money
It's awesome
One more thing if that's ok before I go
Queen Elizabeth
Can suck my motherfucking nuts
Because that's why
Everything is so fucking expensive
That's why I'm paying $429
For an Xbox One
We need to all just move to our own island
And call it fuck everyone else
We are the island nation of awesome
Fuck the rest of you
This is probably the only
Internet video gaming show where people will call in
To tell off the Queen of England
Alright
Have a good one my friend
Bye
That was a great call
I love hearing from the overseas people
It's great
You are up way early or late
I have a feeling he's up early
Because he missed me talking about the pinball game
He's 8 hours ahead of us
I'm going to close up
Skype
I know Act F was trying to ring in
But I think he was just trying to be nice
I'm going to shut it down so we can wrap up the show
I'm out of here for the night
But I do want to say before we go around and get everybody's final thoughts
I just want to say once again

You know what? I'm going to make my
Dedication to Final Fantasy XIV tonight
I'm installing WoW
Oh my gosh
You know what reminded me that I still had
WoW installed?
First
You're starting to sound like Gimmet
Which we'll hear about on Wednesdays Hoard House
Plug, plug, plug
It's already replaced WoW in my heart
And besides that I watched the fuckery that was
The end of the Orgrimmar thing
And fuck that I'm glad I quit
Alright
That is it
We're done
Thank you guys so much for tuning in
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night
