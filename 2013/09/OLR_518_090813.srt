2
00:00:31,553 --> 00:00:36,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,196 --> 00:00:38,917
[SPEAKER_08]: It is the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:44,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we are, episode number 518 for this September the 8th, 2013.

5
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,122
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you guys all had a good week off, Labor Day week.

6
00:00:47,162 --> 00:00:50,043
[SPEAKER_08]: We weren't here last week, but we're back to do it all again tonight.

7
00:00:50,403 --> 00:00:53,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Talk about video games and gaming culture and have some laughs.

8
00:00:53,925 --> 00:00:57,167
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

9
00:00:57,367 --> 00:01:00,249
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

10
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:02,010
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in your town raiding your fruits.

11
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:02,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, you are.

12
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,212
[SPEAKER_08]: You are definitely helping out with Animal Crossing.

13
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:11,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you impressed though that I actually, I went in when I was flying to Atlanta and cleaned up the whole town.

14
00:01:12,157 --> 00:01:14,378
[SPEAKER_08]: I found that Animal Crossing is a great flight game.

15
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:15,319
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

16
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:23,064
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also a great, I have nothing to do so I'm going to play Animal Crossing for three hours type of game and the cat won't get off of me.

17
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:24,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to play Animal Crossing.

18
00:01:24,807 --> 00:01:25,528
[SPEAKER_08]: DragonCon, DragonCon, DragonCon

19
00:01:46,104 --> 00:01:47,105
[SPEAKER_08]: TechMasterLoki

20
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:02,927
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, I got nothing.

21
00:02:03,047 --> 00:02:05,107
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so after-school inspirational of you.

22
00:02:05,528 --> 00:02:06,508
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a little bit, isn't it?

23
00:02:06,568 --> 00:02:07,148
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you, Loki?

24
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:08,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fine.

25
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:10,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Counting down the days until Grand Theft Auto?

26
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Sort of.

27
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess.

28
00:02:15,111 --> 00:02:16,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Just waiting for the leak.

29
00:02:17,812 --> 00:02:19,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Which I'm sure it will soon enough.

30
00:02:21,313 --> 00:02:23,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Rockstar's not shipping anything out.

31
00:02:23,054 --> 00:02:27,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're not shipping anything out to distribution until Friday, so...

32
00:02:29,907 --> 00:02:32,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably next weekend, I'm sure.

33
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:40,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't know if I'll be getting mine early because the powers that be above me are kind of being anal.

34
00:02:42,494 --> 00:02:44,515
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still going to do it, but we'll see.

35
00:02:44,535 --> 00:02:47,156
[SPEAKER_06]: I may get slapped on the wrist for that.

36
00:02:47,597 --> 00:02:51,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it like the guy who put up the YouTube today of the Xbox One and...

37
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:53,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, see, I'm not that dumb.

38
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:57,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they worried about early leaks and things like that?

39
00:02:57,123 --> 00:03:07,331
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just worried about like because they're requiring manifests of like the orders that go out and stuff just to make sure that no one's getting their product on Friday or whatever.

40
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:08,632
[SPEAKER_06]: No stores.

41
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,733
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm not a store.

42
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:10,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to.

43
00:03:11,935 --> 00:03:17,261
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought I already saw on Reddit or one of those sites that somebody's got the game and the disc.

44
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:21,626
[SPEAKER_06]: You saw Photoshop and it was from... Well, that was a good Photoshop.

45
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Gamertag Radio posted that on Twitter.

46
00:03:23,868 --> 00:03:24,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

47
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:26,531
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it was a Photoshop of somebody.

48
00:03:26,992 --> 00:03:27,492
[SPEAKER_06]: They did that.

49
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:30,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's no actual copies of the game out there yet.

50
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:31,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

51
00:03:31,236 --> 00:03:31,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

52
00:03:32,137 --> 00:03:51,123
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah no there there are there are shippers that are out there like full palette shippers but um those are like intended for i think target walmart and stuff okay so those are out there and someone did break in the one of those to take a picture on i saw that on reddit but aside from that i don't think any copies have mysteriously vanished from those yet

53
00:03:52,924 --> 00:03:57,427
[SPEAKER_08]: So the retail release though is the Tuesday after this Tuesday, right?

54
00:03:57,567 --> 00:03:58,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Next Tuesday?

55
00:03:59,369 --> 00:03:59,589
[SPEAKER_06]: 17th?

56
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:00,089
[SPEAKER_08]: 17th.

57
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,671
[SPEAKER_08]: This week is Kingdom Hearts HD.

58
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:04,252
[SPEAKER_08]: I just got my pre-order in for that today.

59
00:04:04,873 --> 00:04:07,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Kingdom Hearts and Puppeteer and NHL.

60
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:10,074
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're getting into that time of year.

61
00:04:10,294 --> 00:04:13,435
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to start ramping up with Kingdom Hearts and Grand Theft Auto.

62
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:17,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are definitely two big things to kick off this season, right?

63
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:21,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and Kingdom Hearts is just an HD compilation.

64
00:04:21,317 --> 00:04:30,319
[SPEAKER_08]: But Kingdom Hearts is like, I don't know, like I'm really liking this whole square going back to some of the PS2 games and kind of making bigger and better and all that.

65
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:31,339
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that idea.

66
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:38,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's kind of cool and all, but I think it's going to be more interesting to see Kingdom Hearts 3 and Final Fantasy XV.

67
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:44,528
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I want to talk about... Gosh, there's a lot to catch up on since we were gone last week.

68
00:04:46,109 --> 00:04:47,189
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know where to begin.

69
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,712
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sick a little bit again, which kind of sucks.

70
00:04:50,812 --> 00:04:54,094
[SPEAKER_08]: I got Com Plague yet again from DragonCon.

71
00:04:54,134 --> 00:04:56,356
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know how that happens, but there you go.

72
00:04:57,077 --> 00:05:03,608
[SPEAKER_08]: We should probably talk about some of the things that happened last week in gaming news because it's only a three hour show so we don't have time to talk all about last week and this week.

73
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:07,615
[SPEAKER_08]: So we want to do a segment we call Last Week's News Set to Holic.

74
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:10,966
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.

75
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,122
[SPEAKER_08]: or the Nintendo Toast is kind of what it looks like.

76
00:05:41,463 --> 00:05:44,526
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is definitely targeted towards the younger set.

77
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:48,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously missed opportunity with that, I think.

78
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,153
[SPEAKER_08]: It does not fold and it only displays images in 2D.

79
00:05:51,213 --> 00:05:56,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently it uses one screen that's separated by the plastic in order to pull it off.

80
00:05:56,198 --> 00:05:59,922
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is aimed at 5 and 6 year olds per Reggie.

81
00:06:01,179 --> 00:06:26,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Zelda Link Between Worlds got a release date, November 22nd is the big day Wonderful 101, sales figures, not as good as it had hoped But I think it might be a little early to tell with that That's because it's on the Wii U It also hasn't released over here yet, it comes out on the 15th, one week from today But that is the news out of Japan, so there you go Let's see, I guess something else we could talk about there Um...

82
00:06:27,578 --> 00:06:33,423
[SPEAKER_08]: How about WayForward's Kickstarter of Shantate Half Genie Hero for Wii U?

83
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,425
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a thing that's happening on Kickstarter from WayForward.

84
00:06:36,665 --> 00:06:36,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

85
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:37,586
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

86
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:39,247
[SPEAKER_08]: That's last week's news set to Holic.

87
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:41,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of the big stuff obviously around Nintendo.

88
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, did you want to elaborate on the 2DS real quick?

89
00:06:44,431 --> 00:06:58,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the thing, you know, you mentioned that it's one screen with a piece of plastic in between, and I saw some people, you know, on Ars Technica and stuff, they were showing, like, here's what we think that this should have looked like instead, being, like, a whole tablet.

90
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:13,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, basically, just remove that plastic and leave just, like, kind of a barrier there, and have it where maybe you can have some new software that's supported by the 2DS, you know, have 2DS software that supports the whole, like, almost like a whole tablet instead of two screens.

91
00:07:13,386 --> 00:07:13,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

92
00:07:13,877 --> 00:07:15,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know.

93
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:18,881
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just trying not to overthink this because you'll notice it was very intentional.

94
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:20,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo did not roll this out at E3.

95
00:07:20,863 --> 00:07:22,604
[SPEAKER_08]: They did not even do a direct for it.

96
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:23,925
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a big deal.

97
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:38,877
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the thing is the thought is that this is where it's going to go for the next handheld system that will be a tablet with one screen because this is what they did with the Game Boy Advance SP where you had that hinge in the foldable screen and then that later showed up in the Nintendo DS.

98
00:07:39,757 --> 00:07:41,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I might be reading into it a lot.

99
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:41,879
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about that.

100
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:54,693
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is also Nintendo trying to... If you think about it, Nintendo the last time they did something really crazy with their hardware, aside from the 3DS being in 3D, was the Wii.

101
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,697
[SPEAKER_06]: And since then they haven't really done too much

102
00:07:58,537 --> 00:08:02,939
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's kind of, once again, the 2DS is confusing, I think, to consumers.

103
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:12,942
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, the name itself is going to confuse people because they're going to be like, well, 2DS, so I don't see any 2DS games I can buy for this.

104
00:08:13,722 --> 00:08:15,102
[SPEAKER_06]: I only see 3DS games.

105
00:08:16,643 --> 00:08:18,363
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't think they're going to get it.

106
00:08:18,383 --> 00:08:25,906
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, you're saying that there's a market out there of people that have 5 and 6 year olds that actually read the small little print that's on those boxes?

107
00:08:25,926 --> 00:08:26,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

108
00:08:26,326 --> 00:08:27,267
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

109
00:08:45,504 --> 00:08:46,544
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I like that.

110
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:49,085
[SPEAKER_06]: And the print that's larger, fuck that, can't read it.

111
00:08:49,306 --> 00:08:54,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, small print that's, you know, something that doesn't really possibly affect my, you know, kids' eyes.

112
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:57,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll read that and be scared of it.

113
00:08:57,289 --> 00:09:01,430
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think the 2DS is kind of a non-factor as far as we're all concerned.

114
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:07,152
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's like that Wii that they released in Canada that didn't even have any internet functionality or what have you.

115
00:09:07,273 --> 00:09:07,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, remember that?

116
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:09,854
[SPEAKER_06]: It was released with a little fanfare.

117
00:09:09,874 --> 00:09:11,234
[SPEAKER_06]: They did that with the PSP as well.

118
00:09:11,274 --> 00:09:13,555
[SPEAKER_06]: They had one with no Wi-Fi and stuff or something.

119
00:09:13,795 --> 00:09:41,476
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever yeah it's no big deal but I just think it's kind of weird you know why would you invest money well actually I'm glad you know if Nintendo is doing this new thing every year I'm glad that this system is a step backwards in some ways and not a step forward because I'd be I'd be kind of irritated if I had a new 3DS I'd want to buy you know so I'm kind of glad we have a year off from all this you know stuff and maybe there'll be a 3DS Uber or who knows what 2DS XL I doubt it I doubt it

120
00:09:41,676 --> 00:09:52,846
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, our chat room is lighting up, and I do want to acknowledge our live chatters because we do tape live every Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

121
00:09:53,146 --> 00:09:54,207
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you... Excuse me.

122
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:59,511
[SPEAKER_08]: I still have hiccups and other horrible radio things from being sick from the con plague.

123
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:00,232
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a Dragon Con.

124
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:04,956
[SPEAKER_08]: If you do join us live for a live show, don't forget to join our chat room live...

125
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:08,051
[SPEAKER_08]: dot VOG Network dot com.

126
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:09,071
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope I make it through the show.

127
00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:14,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Where we have comments like Tiger Claw says that 2DS is going to screw up a lot of kids Christmas.

128
00:10:15,217 --> 00:10:16,618
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I see the logic in that.

129
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:18,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would that screw up a kid's Christmas?

130
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:22,683
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually perfect because I was Julian has started to read.

131
00:10:23,484 --> 00:10:24,184
[SPEAKER_02]: He's six years old.

132
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:24,805
[SPEAKER_02]: He's in first grade.

133
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:25,265
[SPEAKER_02]: He's reading.

134
00:10:25,545 --> 00:10:29,609
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been reading me play Animal Crossing which I've been trying not to get him to repeat Pork Sword.

135
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:32,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to Queen Simia and Jet for that.

136
00:10:33,712 --> 00:10:35,374
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

137
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:53,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and there's no hinges to break on the 2DS.

138
00:10:54,126 --> 00:10:58,069
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's also too big to fit in the pockets, but I think that actually might be a good thing.

139
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:01,172
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't want a six-year-old fitting that stuff in their pockets and taking it to school.

140
00:11:02,473 --> 00:11:02,834
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

141
00:11:02,914 --> 00:11:05,977
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't want those portable systems to be portable?

142
00:11:06,117 --> 00:11:15,145
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm worried I'm going to get accused of being a Nintendo defendist or whatever, but I just don't think this system is as big of a deal as Twitter made it seem to be this week.

143
00:11:15,165 --> 00:11:17,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm glad that they decided that, you know, fuck it.

144
00:11:18,006 --> 00:11:20,727
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't create a hinge that actually won't break very easily.

145
00:11:20,807 --> 00:11:25,448
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're just going to make a system that's super weird looking.

146
00:11:27,168 --> 00:11:27,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

147
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:32,510
[SPEAKER_08]: DC Nate in chat says, iPads don't fit in pockets either and they sell just fine.

148
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:38,373
[SPEAKER_08]: So talking about that maybe that type of affordability isn't necessarily a deal breaker.

149
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:42,456
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that, but who's having their kids bring iPads to fucking school?

150
00:11:43,817 --> 00:11:45,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's huge in college.

151
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, yeah, that's college.

152
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:52,422
[SPEAKER_06]: But five and six-year-olds where this is actually targeted, are you really going to spend that kind of money on it?

153
00:11:52,502 --> 00:11:55,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Dan's 12-year-old cousin, not Dan's...

154
00:11:56,785 --> 00:12:02,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was like when Becky or Chris's relatives got a 12 year old iPhone 5.

155
00:12:04,147 --> 00:12:05,048
[SPEAKER_02]: What 12 year old needs that?

156
00:12:05,388 --> 00:12:06,388
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's a 12 year old.

157
00:12:06,468 --> 00:12:10,770
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about a little kid that has a goddamn iPad.

158
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:14,211
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, here's the thing.

159
00:12:14,511 --> 00:12:25,421
[SPEAKER_06]: You're talking to kids again, and once again, the main thing was 3D, they don't really like the 3D because parents are concerned that they don't understand how to use a Switch, which is ridiculous.

160
00:12:25,441 --> 00:12:28,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and you can actually turn off 3D and parental settings on the 3DS today.

161
00:12:28,484 --> 00:12:28,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

162
00:12:29,305 --> 00:12:30,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh, parental settings.

163
00:12:30,926 --> 00:12:33,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they'll read the small print there, but they won't read the manual, so whatever.

164
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:36,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so they're confused by the Switch and stuff, and...

165
00:12:37,052 --> 00:12:38,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that hinge is going to break.

166
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:42,018
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think is going to happen to the 2DS?

167
00:12:42,358 --> 00:12:43,539
[SPEAKER_06]: The kid's going to drop on the ground.

168
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, look, both of those fucking screens are scratched now.

169
00:12:47,323 --> 00:12:47,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations.

170
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:54,551
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think if you don't like it, don't buy it, and this isn't going to break Nintendo's bank if this thing flops because I really don't think they're making that many of them.

171
00:12:54,631 --> 00:12:56,894
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess they don't care if another system flops now, don't they?

172
00:12:57,034 --> 00:13:04,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's... Again, they did not have the fanfare with E3 or even a Nintendo Direct or anything.

173
00:13:04,176 --> 00:13:05,856
[SPEAKER_08]: This was on a press release under the radar.

174
00:13:05,956 --> 00:13:09,057
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they have an expectation for this release.

175
00:13:09,077 --> 00:13:17,860
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just trying to put out another system to drive some more sales because Pokemans is coming out right around the corner and they have to make up for the losses of the Wii U. Because the Wii U, let's be honest...

176
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Wind Waker HD, I love Wind Waker, it's not going to fucking pull that system out.

177
00:13:23,443 --> 00:13:36,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Mario Kart 8 is really, I know there's the Mario game as well, but I think the combo of that and Mario Kart 8 is going to be, that's going to be, and if another price drop can squeeze in when Mario Kart 8 comes out, that will really seal the deal.

178
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,012
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm talking, even if they can drop it just like 20 bucks, I think that would be huge.

179
00:13:41,193 --> 00:13:41,593
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

180
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:42,534
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we got a ways.

181
00:13:43,175 --> 00:13:44,075
[SPEAKER_08]: So, all right.

182
00:13:44,135 --> 00:13:45,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, last week's news.

183
00:13:46,237 --> 00:13:46,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Done.

184
00:13:46,638 --> 00:13:46,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Over with.

185
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:47,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it.

186
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:49,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Kabuki needs to move to my town.

187
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:51,543
[SPEAKER_08]: One of your villagers moved to my town.

188
00:13:51,703 --> 00:13:53,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I went by and saw Butch, that traitor.

189
00:13:54,886 --> 00:13:55,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to steal Kabuki.

190
00:13:56,087 --> 00:14:01,232
[SPEAKER_08]: I was really surprised because I was like, oh, he came from Normandy.

191
00:14:01,312 --> 00:14:02,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's Jamie's town.

192
00:14:02,173 --> 00:14:04,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, she's going to be pissed because this isn't the one she was trying to lose.

193
00:14:05,174 --> 00:14:05,514
[SPEAKER_02]: DragonCon

194
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:56,193
[SPEAKER_08]: I got pulled onto a panel Monday morning at the last minute about streaming media and I got to talk about the live 365 days and everything from that to the modern Twitch TV and I had a lot of fun so I just want to say hey to anybody who I might have met doing that or the VOG Network Super Show panel which sadly didn't have the greatest turnout live but what's interesting is that apparently it had a great turnout online and we're getting good download numbers for it so I guess just a lot of you couldn't make it to DragonCon in person but I hope you enjoyed that show

195
00:14:56,633 --> 00:14:57,714
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a lot of fun doing it.

196
00:14:58,736 --> 00:15:00,998
[SPEAKER_08]: And it sounds like we're gonna be doing it again next year.

197
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:03,461
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm making my plans to go to DragonCon 2014.

198
00:15:03,962 --> 00:15:06,565
[SPEAKER_08]: But I had a wonderful time at DragonCon.

199
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:07,967
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna be honest, the first couple days...

200
00:15:09,195 --> 00:15:10,056
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

201
00:15:36,151 --> 00:15:37,372
[SPEAKER_08]: It's... Well, I've never been to AX.

202
00:15:37,392 --> 00:15:40,194
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of AX was spread across a convention center and three hotels.

203
00:15:40,294 --> 00:15:40,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it?

204
00:15:40,855 --> 00:15:41,815
[SPEAKER_02]: At least it was last time I went.

205
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:53,044
[SPEAKER_08]: But like, oh my gosh, just like the main floor of the Marriott, just wall-to-wall people, and then you go downstairs, there's like multi-level, and there's these different ballrooms, or there's Artist Alley, and...

206
00:15:53,564 --> 00:16:10,514
[SPEAKER_08]: were a room where you can walk up and meet celebrities and a board game room in the basement I think that was at the Hilton had a board game area in the basement that was huge and that's the one that had the mech systems that Bobby's talked about on his show before and you could lose track of time in there easy no windows to the outside because it's in the basement

207
00:16:11,195 --> 00:16:25,271
[SPEAKER_08]: and I can see how people can get stuck in there playing the wolf game or werewolf or whatever you call it till 8 in the morning which by the way was the first time I ever saw that being played live I'd played it online on DDR Freak back in the day but getting to see that playing live was a lot of fun

208
00:16:25,891 --> 00:16:27,912
[SPEAKER_08]: So, lots of panels.

209
00:16:28,193 --> 00:16:30,954
[SPEAKER_08]: I really like how DragonCon separates things into tracks.

210
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:38,179
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, okay, Hilton 203 is going to be nothing but podcasts, unless we get a really, really big thing that might be one of the other rooms.

211
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:40,980
[SPEAKER_08]: And they had an MMO track and a video game track.

212
00:16:41,461 --> 00:16:45,183
[SPEAKER_08]: The one thing I was a little less impressed with was the digital gaming room.

213
00:16:45,343 --> 00:16:48,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I know some people work hard to put that on, but...

214
00:16:48,625 --> 00:17:13,914
[SPEAKER_08]: just it's not I mean to be fair Dragon Con is not a video game expo it's not PAX it's not a video game show so that wasn't supposed to be their main draw but barely any console stuff to be seen it was very PC and you know there was a Smash Brothers tournament going on but that was about it like if it wasn't a tournament or some PC play that's really about it but lots of 3DS street passing to be had that's for sure

215
00:17:15,094 --> 00:17:42,706
[SPEAKER_08]: so yeah I don't know what else to say about DragonCon I had a great time it was great to just meet people that I've worked with for many years finally getting to meet Brad from PodCulture and some of his cohorts and they were very generous in getting me very drunk very quickly so thank you for that and meeting some of Bobby's friends these are people like I've heard about but haven't really met and one of his friends Sue and I hit it off really well I just love her to bits and she was giving out vodka soaked gummy bears all weekend so love her

216
00:17:43,266 --> 00:17:44,207
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna go next year, Rob

217
00:18:08,627 --> 00:18:09,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting to see Travis.

218
00:18:09,587 --> 00:18:12,048
[SPEAKER_08]: You realize it's been like 10 years since I've seen Travis.

219
00:18:12,628 --> 00:18:15,149
[SPEAKER_08]: So getting to be there with him when he was doing his cosplay.

220
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,791
[SPEAKER_08]: He did an amazing job as Commander Shepard.

221
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:25,014
[SPEAKER_08]: If you guys haven't heard, him and his wife Jenna, Mark Meir, the voice of Mail Shep, renewed their vows one of the mornings.

222
00:18:25,214 --> 00:18:27,775
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very pressed because it was a surprise.

223
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:29,436
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wasn't told it was going to happen.

224
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:30,096
[SPEAKER_08]: So I didn't go.

225
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:31,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you all the clumped for not going?

226
00:18:32,257 --> 00:18:33,918
[SPEAKER_08]: I was a little bit like, you did what?

227
00:18:34,858 --> 00:18:35,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Why wasn't I told?

228
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:36,320
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have got up.

229
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,662
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have forced myself out of bed.

230
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:38,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh well.

231
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:40,746
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a great time.

232
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I'm already planning to go back next year.

233
00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:47,730
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel bad for PAX Prime.

234
00:18:49,151 --> 00:18:52,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently there was plenty of fuckery that happened in one of the panels.

235
00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:57,797
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really want to get into that controversial issue right now because I'm sure you've all read about it.

236
00:18:57,817 --> 00:18:58,858
[SPEAKER_06]: I love fuckery panels.

237
00:18:58,878 --> 00:18:59,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the best to watch.

238
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:08,284
[SPEAKER_08]: All I'm saying is that Penny Arcade Expo, I love the vibe of Penny Arcade Expo and I still do kind of want to go to Penny Arcade East.

239
00:19:10,986 --> 00:19:14,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people there really need some PR help big time.

240
00:19:14,328 --> 00:19:17,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people there need to get their foot out of their mouth.

241
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:20,892
[SPEAKER_08]: And it seems to be perpetual is the problem I'm starting to have.

242
00:19:20,932 --> 00:19:25,695
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like every time you think they're on the right path, it's just whoop, foot goes right back in mouth.

243
00:19:25,755 --> 00:19:26,236
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like...

244
00:19:28,317 --> 00:19:42,100
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are... There's a lot of good things that those guys do, but then it's like, you know, how long are we going to sit here and just, like, kind of turn the other way when there's... One of them won't stop with this running his mouth.

245
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

246
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,521
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, next year, if I can make it to DragonCon, by the way, we need to cosplay.

247
00:19:48,581 --> 00:19:53,162
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm already talking about cosplay with Travis, too, but I would be down... I mean, there's, like, four days of cons, so that's four cosplays.

248
00:19:53,782 --> 00:19:58,405
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually already been working on my costume for one of the SAC anime next year.

249
00:20:00,427 --> 00:20:02,148
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to consider going to PAX East.

250
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:03,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Just throwing that out there.

251
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:05,690
[SPEAKER_08]: I still would like to try and make that happen.

252
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:06,510
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

253
00:20:06,711 --> 00:20:08,732
[SPEAKER_08]: It's money at this point, you guys.

254
00:20:08,752 --> 00:20:09,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Cons be expensive.

255
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:12,835
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they just announced GamerX2 is going to be earlier next year.

256
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,296
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be Alan's birthday weekend in mid-July.

257
00:20:15,396 --> 00:20:17,598
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's that con to look forward to as well.

258
00:20:18,898 --> 00:20:20,259
[SPEAKER_08]: What else did I want to say about DragonCon?

259
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:21,820
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

260
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:28,443
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I said, do you guys have questions or anybody in chat at live.vognetwork.com?

261
00:20:29,283 --> 00:20:33,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you notice any of the sci-fi or fantasy writers who were guests that year?

262
00:20:33,725 --> 00:20:34,285
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see.

263
00:20:35,106 --> 00:20:36,826
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't really do celebrity sightings.

264
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:40,027
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't even go to see Kathy and Jimmy, which was the one celebrity I really wanted to see.

265
00:20:40,068 --> 00:20:40,948
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of just skipped all that.

266
00:20:41,168 --> 00:20:43,729
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Travis ran into George Takei, the lucky fucker.

267
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:48,771
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have totally wanted to see was it the guys from Mythbusters are over there.

268
00:20:48,851 --> 00:20:51,713
[SPEAKER_08]: They did a whole special show at the Fox Theater one night.

269
00:20:52,113 --> 00:20:54,595
[SPEAKER_08]: They did a special live show, and then they did a panel.

270
00:20:54,615 --> 00:20:55,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was a good time.

271
00:20:56,516 --> 00:21:00,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Bobby's mentioning the Parsec Awards.

272
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:01,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that was a lot of fun.

273
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:05,522
[SPEAKER_08]: We got to present at this prestigious award they do for speculative fiction casts.

274
00:21:05,922 --> 00:21:07,444
[SPEAKER_08]: DragonCon DragonCon DragonCon DragonCon

275
00:21:28,763 --> 00:21:30,444
[SPEAKER_08]: VOG got to present that award.

276
00:21:30,484 --> 00:21:33,506
[SPEAKER_08]: So we had a whole little spiel we made up like 30 minutes before the thing.

277
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:34,746
[SPEAKER_08]: And that went pretty well.

278
00:21:35,247 --> 00:21:39,049
[SPEAKER_08]: I had an Oprah moment up on stage and pretended to be... I was not really drunk.

279
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:39,929
[SPEAKER_02]: You gave everyone bees?

280
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:40,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh?

281
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:41,590
[SPEAKER_02]: You gave everyone bees?

282
00:21:42,391 --> 00:21:47,814
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I said something along the lines of, I wish everybody could have an award because all the indie podcasters work so hard.

283
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:50,215
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I were Oprah, I'd say, you get an award and you get an award.

284
00:21:50,675 --> 00:21:51,996
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think I actually danced.

285
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:54,778
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can see me all jiggling up there on stage.

286
00:21:55,018 --> 00:21:55,138
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

287
00:21:55,788 --> 00:21:56,829
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm leaving your village now.

288
00:21:57,489 --> 00:21:57,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye.

289
00:21:57,929 --> 00:21:58,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already looted it.

290
00:21:59,070 --> 00:21:59,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Get out.

291
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:00,771
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

292
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:07,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I think that's all I want to say on DragonCon because I know we have a lot of gaming news and other stuff we want to get into, but good time.

293
00:22:07,374 --> 00:22:08,214
[SPEAKER_08]: WoodCon again.

294
00:22:09,035 --> 00:22:09,055
[SPEAKER_08]: A++.

295
00:22:11,385 --> 00:22:16,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get into our gaming weeks, I suppose it's time for.

296
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,229
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a little off after having a week off.

297
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:19,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about our gaming weeks.

298
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,531
[SPEAKER_08]: What have you been playing this week, DarkSakura?

299
00:22:21,691 --> 00:22:33,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Animal Crossing, and I wanted to play Final Fantasy XIV, but apparently my account was rendered inactive, so when I went to go register my collector's edition code, it created another account.

300
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:58,362
[SPEAKER_02]: so now I have two accounts one of them with no characters and the other one with my characters on it that I can't access so I've opened a ticket I'm calling Square tomorrow hopefully get everything fixed but man they don't have their phone number anywhere on their site and I had to go look at that locate customer service website so I've got that um I played some more uh Fractal I'm super addicted to that game um I actually started DuckTales um

301
00:23:00,497 --> 00:23:13,600
[SPEAKER_02]: and uh yeah that's about it I mean I've really had a lot on my plate I had a job interview and oh no I played something else um I don't remember what it is so it's not important your turn

302
00:23:14,577 --> 00:23:17,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, this week I didn't play a whole ton.

303
00:23:17,838 --> 00:23:19,518
[SPEAKER_06]: I did a little bit of catching up.

304
00:23:19,658 --> 00:23:22,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is even kind of including last week a little bit.

305
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:28,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Saints Row 4, so I finished playing that kind of... I mean, I'm still... What was it?

306
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:35,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Last night I spent a good while modding the files in there to try to unlock DLC without paying for it.

307
00:23:36,242 --> 00:23:42,624
[SPEAKER_06]: But that didn't work, so I was trying to then unlock weapons that were...

308
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:50,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really weapons that you can use, but they're weapons that are in the game, kind of like some of the enemies have in some of the flashback missions and stuff.

309
00:23:50,611 --> 00:23:53,353
[SPEAKER_06]: But I didn't get that to work.

310
00:23:53,453 --> 00:24:07,006
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I was playing a little bit of Grand Theft Auto 4 just because I'd watch somebody do or attempt to do this kind of six-star run from one side of the map to the other.

311
00:24:07,826 --> 00:24:07,967
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

312
00:24:08,607 --> 00:24:09,187
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

313
00:24:26,753 --> 00:24:27,774
[SPEAKER_06]: That just didn't work.

314
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:29,396
[SPEAKER_06]: And plus, the AI is really cheap.

315
00:24:29,536 --> 00:24:36,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you jump into the water, there's no boats, and then like two seconds later, all of a sudden there's five boats, and they've run over you multiple times.

316
00:24:36,763 --> 00:24:39,626
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, where did those boats just teleport from?

317
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:41,148
[SPEAKER_06]: They weren't here a second ago.

318
00:24:41,788 --> 00:24:42,049
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

319
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I didn't really end up doing that.

320
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:55,412
[SPEAKER_06]: So I ended up instead filming some of my... I don't know if I want to call it parkour, but like free climbing, I guess.

321
00:24:55,452 --> 00:25:02,414
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something I used to do in multiplayer because I got tired of beating everybody so badly in our multiplayer games at work.

322
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:07,695
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I used to climb buildings and still kill them.

323
00:25:08,656 --> 00:25:14,105
[SPEAKER_06]: So I filmed some of those buildings and things that I used to climb on and I thought that'd be fun.

324
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:17,571
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to edit it together and do some more stuff, but

325
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,991
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

326
00:25:45,069 --> 00:25:47,536
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what happens when they lay off all your friends, you know.

327
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:50,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Bummer, wow.

328
00:25:50,184 --> 00:25:51,387
[SPEAKER_06]: All the people that I used to play with.

329
00:25:52,611 --> 00:25:53,233
[SPEAKER_06]: So what are you going to do?

330
00:25:54,949 --> 00:25:55,229
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

331
00:25:55,589 --> 00:25:56,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Stock them.

332
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:57,130
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

333
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,570
[SPEAKER_08]: My gaming week.

334
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:05,972
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, because I was at a con for several days, I didn't get to play a lot of new stuff at the con, except for one thing I'll talk about at the end.

335
00:26:07,152 --> 00:26:09,053
[SPEAKER_08]: But I did come home.

336
00:26:09,093 --> 00:26:16,555
[SPEAKER_08]: I played quite an obscene amount of Final Fantasy XIV, but I know we've talked about it to death on this show, and there's really not a lot more I can say.

337
00:26:16,755 --> 00:26:18,856
[SPEAKER_08]: I got White Mage.

338
00:26:19,636 --> 00:26:22,117
[SPEAKER_08]: I did play a couple new games on PlayStation 3.

339
00:26:23,277 --> 00:26:27,602
[SPEAKER_08]: I played Castle of Illusion, the HD remake or whatever that came out.

340
00:26:28,643 --> 00:26:31,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Did they change a lot in that game or is it just me?

341
00:26:31,305 --> 00:26:32,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there's like things in it.

342
00:26:32,787 --> 00:26:34,349
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, wait a minute, this wasn't here before.

343
00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:46,521
[SPEAKER_02]: They were saying, I was watching an interview with the creator and also the original designer and the new people and they were talking about how they actually did make some changes to make it more of a Disney film-like.

344
00:26:46,701 --> 00:26:50,124
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if you enjoyed the Genesis version enough, you probably already bought this.

345
00:27:11,843 --> 00:27:15,565
[SPEAKER_08]: One game I spent a little more time playing was a music game on PlayStation 3 called Kickbeat.

346
00:27:15,585 --> 00:27:17,006
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you guys have heard of this.

347
00:27:17,086 --> 00:27:24,971
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a music game, which I haven't got to play a lot of those lately, although I also played the demo for Hatsune Miku Project Diva F, and I won it.

348
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:26,052
[SPEAKER_08]: That was actually a lot of fun.

349
00:27:26,092 --> 00:27:27,973
[SPEAKER_08]: It reminded me of a PlayStation 2 music game.

350
00:27:28,474 --> 00:27:30,695
[SPEAKER_08]: The price is what's scaring me on that game.

351
00:27:30,755 --> 00:27:33,397
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, $50 for Hatsune Miku?

352
00:27:33,517 --> 00:27:33,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

353
00:27:34,678 --> 00:27:35,619
[SPEAKER_08]: That's too much money.

354
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,880
[SPEAKER_08]: But Kickbeat is more like $10 or $15.

355
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,161
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was $15 as a download title.

356
00:27:41,343 --> 00:27:57,843
[SPEAKER_08]: and essentially it's set up like it's a little karate thing but your buttons like X and square and circle are all laid out as up, down, left and right as they are on the pad and these little ninja dudes will come out onto the spot and that's when you kick them

357
00:27:58,323 --> 00:28:21,862
[SPEAKER_08]: and so like you'll be you know playing along to the music and you know you'll see a little ninja come out and you hit the button and it kills them but you have a little bit of warning so it's just like a different way of reading instead of notes scrolling down the screen it's little ninjas setting themselves into position and depending on the shirts they wear tell you kind of like when the beats are so like if it's a yellow it's on the on the beat if it's blue then you're gonna have half beats or third beats or

358
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:22,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Does he duck turn?

359
00:28:38,638 --> 00:28:40,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Not quite.

360
00:28:40,561 --> 00:28:42,643
[SPEAKER_08]: He's not as fabulous as Parappa was.

361
00:28:42,663 --> 00:28:45,106
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to tell you what else isn't as fabulous as Parappa was.

362
00:28:45,526 --> 00:28:49,892
[SPEAKER_08]: This is completely a matter of opinion and some of you are going to disagree with me strongly on this.

363
00:28:50,492 --> 00:28:52,094
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like the song list in the game at all.

364
00:28:52,635 --> 00:28:54,297
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot of hard rock music.

365
00:28:55,077 --> 00:28:59,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of you would like Pendulum, and those were the songs that bothered me the least, probably, in the game.

366
00:28:59,901 --> 00:29:05,805
[SPEAKER_08]: But one of them's a remix, and one of them... They're not like... What were the huge Pendulum songs?

367
00:29:06,005 --> 00:29:07,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Colors, was that their song?

368
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:08,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Colors, yeah.

369
00:29:08,387 --> 00:29:09,107
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not in there.

370
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:10,768
[SPEAKER_08]: It's other stuff.

371
00:29:10,828 --> 00:29:16,112
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably Slam, or... I'm trying to think of the other one.

372
00:29:16,192 --> 00:29:20,255
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's just stuff I don't really listen to in my normal life, you know?

373
00:29:20,948 --> 00:29:46,270
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked my techno DDR stuff and all that you know so but but there are people that like that music that will be very excited about this game that it incorporates that into it and apparently if you beat the game once you can import your own music into it I'm not sure how well that's going to work because it doesn't always work very well those algorithms but I'd like to try it I'm trying to play through the game one time so I can at least try it but um

374
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:47,671
[SPEAKER_08]: AkumaJP is sexy and I know it in there.

375
00:29:47,691 --> 00:29:48,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Very much no.

376
00:29:48,072 --> 00:29:49,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless you play it as your own mp3.

377
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Marilyn Manson's The Beautiful People is in it.

378
00:30:08,572 --> 00:30:10,514
[SPEAKER_08]: That was one song I recognized.

379
00:30:10,574 --> 00:30:10,855
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?

380
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:12,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Boom!

381
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:15,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't ask me to sing these songs.

382
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,201
[SPEAKER_08]: It's terrible.

383
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,182
[SPEAKER_08]: What is that band?

384
00:30:17,222 --> 00:30:17,762
[SPEAKER_08]: P.O.D.?

385
00:30:17,822 --> 00:30:18,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that their name?

386
00:30:18,743 --> 00:30:19,524
[SPEAKER_08]: That song's in there.

387
00:30:21,807 --> 00:30:25,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that song, a remix of that song was in Amplitude.

388
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:26,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's true.

389
00:30:26,631 --> 00:30:26,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

390
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:27,432
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

391
00:30:28,072 --> 00:30:28,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, anyway.

392
00:30:29,292 --> 00:30:29,993
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's Kickbeat.

393
00:30:30,753 --> 00:30:35,175
[SPEAKER_08]: And between that and Final Fantasy, that's pretty much all I did, you know, because I was gone for a week.

394
00:30:35,815 --> 00:30:41,177
[SPEAKER_08]: However, at DragonCon, Bobby was good enough to bring his Oculus Rift, after all.

395
00:30:41,217 --> 00:30:44,098
[SPEAKER_08]: He threatened not to bring it because we were all going to be too drunk to play it.

396
00:30:44,698 --> 00:30:46,139
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the perfect time to play it!

397
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I can understand, because it's a very expensive piece of hardware, and, you know, he doesn't want to fling it around.

398
00:30:51,381 --> 00:30:52,281
[SPEAKER_08]: It's over your eyes, not your mouth.

399
00:30:52,321 --> 00:30:53,682
[SPEAKER_08]: If you vomit, it's going to miss it.

400
00:30:55,296 --> 00:30:58,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, he didn't bring Slenderman either, so I didn't get to do the scary game.

401
00:30:58,879 --> 00:31:02,021
[SPEAKER_08]: But from what I understand, Slenderman's on injection drivers.

402
00:31:02,221 --> 00:31:03,142
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more of a hack anyway.

403
00:31:04,043 --> 00:31:14,010
[SPEAKER_08]: He did YouTube me playing it for the first time, some type of roller coaster demo that we were doing where the roller coaster, like the track, just ends up missing at one part, so your car goes flying.

404
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,571
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say this.

405
00:31:15,931 --> 00:31:16,072
[SPEAKER_08]: It's...

406
00:31:17,172 --> 00:31:18,974
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an impressive piece of technology.

407
00:31:19,435 --> 00:31:20,636
[SPEAKER_08]: I was very impressed with it.

408
00:31:21,056 --> 00:31:23,158
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is exactly what you think it is.

409
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,661
[SPEAKER_08]: If you haven't heard of Oculus Rift, it's a headset.

410
00:31:26,922 --> 00:31:27,862
[SPEAKER_08]: You put it on your head.

411
00:31:28,123 --> 00:31:29,484
[SPEAKER_08]: It ties to the PC right now.

412
00:31:30,425 --> 00:31:36,671
[SPEAKER_08]: And what you see is you see full 3D out the goggles, but as you turn your head, your field of vision moves.

413
00:31:36,991 --> 00:31:37,752
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you look up,

414
00:31:38,112 --> 00:31:39,732
[SPEAKER_08]: You look up, when you look down, you look down

415
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:19,957
[SPEAKER_08]: and you can go in these rooms and you can flip the stage upside down so you kind of have that sensation of flipping upside down while you're doing it and that was a really cool little demo to do now Bobby did do some injection drivers so we could do some fun stuff like he had a Super Nintendo emulator thing so we could play Mario Kart

416
00:32:20,217 --> 00:32:21,498
[SPEAKER_08]: GameCube Emulator with F-Zero GX

417
00:32:46,778 --> 00:32:52,603
[SPEAKER_08]: So I got to play F-Zero GX on the Rift, and I'll tell you, the first time I went around a loop, that was quite the sensation.

418
00:32:53,143 --> 00:32:54,284
[SPEAKER_08]: That was something else.

419
00:32:54,464 --> 00:32:58,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, imagine you put this thing on, you have headphones on, it's a trip.

420
00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:02,971
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, it's something you have to experience.

421
00:33:03,091 --> 00:33:07,314
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't explain it to you, but I will tell you, it's a pretty impressive piece of technology.

422
00:33:07,674 --> 00:33:08,195
[SPEAKER_08]: It works.

423
00:33:08,715 --> 00:33:13,919
[SPEAKER_08]: The one thing I could say about it is that it's low resolution, but it's supposed to be because it's a dev kit.

424
00:33:13,939 --> 00:33:14,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, yeah.

425
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, right now it's a dev kit.

426
00:33:16,381 --> 00:33:24,930
[SPEAKER_08]: and if I looked really closely I could actually see like the little pieces of glass or whatever that make up the RGB or whatever it is.

427
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:31,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you know how like if you sit up really close to an old television you could see the little pieces of color that make up the big picture?

428
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:33,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you can kind of see that in the rift a little bit.

429
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the RGB artificing, right?

430
00:33:36,762 --> 00:33:37,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, yeah.

431
00:33:37,523 --> 00:33:39,264
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, I'm being like super nitpicky.

432
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:44,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the sensation of being able to look around and having it move with you in real time is pretty cool.

433
00:33:44,669 --> 00:33:45,970
[SPEAKER_08]: And the 3D is done very well.

434
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:52,196
[SPEAKER_06]: The last time I played a VR game, it was at Santa Cruz, the boardwalk.

435
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,016
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

436
00:33:54,378 --> 00:34:02,604
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Quake 1 and I think Duke Nukem 3D, but we played two deathmatches in that.

437
00:34:03,825 --> 00:34:08,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was kind of derpy because it's Quake.

438
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:13,453
[SPEAKER_06]: You can imagine those screens were very low resolution.

439
00:34:13,713 --> 00:34:16,355
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like having two TVs in front of your eyes, but it was fun.

440
00:34:16,876 --> 00:34:17,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

441
00:34:17,396 --> 00:34:41,832
[SPEAKER_08]: well apparently on the PC while you have the headset on Bobby could see what I was doing because it shows you on the PC it just splits the screen and left and right like what's going on in the left eye and what's going on in the right eye so he could see everything I was doing in the rift so which is cool let's see Black Wolf is in chat right now our good pal Bobby Black Wolf who tapes before us at Voices Geeks Network says the gallery air world demo was the name of the missed thing I was playing that was pretty cool

442
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:46,276
[SPEAKER_08]: There was another demo that involved a house, but all you did was watch it.

443
00:34:46,556 --> 00:34:47,817
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what it really reminded me of?

444
00:34:47,857 --> 00:34:53,423
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the modern version of, remember all those old virtual reality demos back in the mid-90s?

445
00:34:54,124 --> 00:34:56,366
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember there was this old one where you walked around the neighborhood with a car.

446
00:34:56,386 --> 00:35:00,270
[SPEAKER_07]: They should totally have that for the Oculus Rift, like the old 90s virtual reality demos.

447
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,491
[SPEAKER_07]: They probably do.

448
00:35:01,611 --> 00:35:02,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby didn't show me everything.

449
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:03,493
[SPEAKER_08]: He didn't have time.

450
00:35:03,553 --> 00:35:06,556
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what just keeps popping into my head over and over with Oculus Rift?

451
00:35:06,676 --> 00:35:07,476
[SPEAKER_08]: The Lawnmower Man.

452
00:35:07,536 --> 00:35:07,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

453
00:35:07,977 --> 00:35:08,817
[SPEAKER_08]: I was thinking of, yes.

454
00:35:09,037 --> 00:35:11,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the movie, the book had nothing to do with it.

455
00:35:11,438 --> 00:35:14,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Now is the time to bring back the Lawnmower Man game or something.

456
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:14,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

457
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,500
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be kind of fun.

458
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:19,382
[SPEAKER_08]: So, again, Oculus Rift is one of those things you just have to try it for yourself.

459
00:35:19,422 --> 00:35:25,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I can't, not even a TV show could explain it to you because you have to have it on your head and try it yourself.

460
00:35:26,365 --> 00:35:27,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say this, too.

461
00:35:27,106 --> 00:35:27,426
[SPEAKER_08]: One other thing.

462
00:35:27,446 --> 00:35:28,546
[SPEAKER_01]: That means you have to give it head.

463
00:35:28,786 --> 00:35:30,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here's the thing, Dark Sakura.

464
00:35:30,767 --> 00:35:31,248
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd hate it.

465
00:35:32,128 --> 00:35:34,732
[SPEAKER_08]: I was getting motion sick playing Borderlands 2 I can't possibly see

466
00:35:48,289 --> 00:35:52,172
[SPEAKER_08]: How somebody can have, like, a two-hour marathon gaming session with this thing.

467
00:35:52,633 --> 00:36:00,218
[SPEAKER_08]: You might get used to it or something, but I just... I really worry about the effect it may have on people.

468
00:36:00,338 --> 00:36:03,861
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, here we are talking about, earlier in the show, Nintendo putting out a 2D system.

469
00:36:03,881 --> 00:36:04,522
[SPEAKER_07]: He had porn.

470
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,323
[SPEAKER_07]: He did not share porn with you.

471
00:36:06,483 --> 00:36:07,524
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't show me the porn!

472
00:36:08,144 --> 00:36:08,284
[SPEAKER_07]: What?! !

473
00:36:09,505 --> 00:36:11,706
[SPEAKER_08]: That is not... He's making me come back next year.

474
00:36:11,746 --> 00:36:12,347
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it is.

475
00:36:12,407 --> 00:36:14,248
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a big ploy to get me to come back next year.

476
00:36:14,268 --> 00:36:16,689
[SPEAKER_06]: That is just downright... I could have seen boobies on Oculus Rift.

477
00:36:16,709 --> 00:36:20,791
[SPEAKER_06]: That is very rude that you don't share porn with your guests.

478
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:21,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Very rude.

479
00:36:22,312 --> 00:36:22,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby.

480
00:36:23,372 --> 00:36:23,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

481
00:36:24,693 --> 00:36:27,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, anyway, I guess it gives me a reason to go back next year.

482
00:36:27,555 --> 00:36:30,837
[SPEAKER_08]: But the sickness thing, though, that's a legit concern I would have.

483
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:35,840
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really curious to see, like, what are the long-term effects this thing has?

484
00:36:36,201 --> 00:36:38,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, what do the warnings on this thing look like?

485
00:36:38,122 --> 00:36:39,463
[SPEAKER_08]: What do doctors think about it?

486
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:40,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they are legitimate concerns.

487
00:36:40,724 --> 00:36:42,345
[SPEAKER_01]: There's bound to be epilepsy concerns.

488
00:36:42,465 --> 00:36:54,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Long-term effects, you may be immersed into the 3D world and may become a cybernetic being that will then try to take over the whole electric infrastructure and internet.

489
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:56,054
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the start of the Matrix.

490
00:36:56,274 --> 00:36:57,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, right.

491
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:58,154
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the start of the Matrix.

492
00:36:58,294 --> 00:36:59,295
[SPEAKER_08]: A la Lawnmower Man.

493
00:36:59,615 --> 00:37:01,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, when you're... I mean, it is.

494
00:37:01,516 --> 00:37:06,697
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, remember when you get killed in the Matrix, you get killed in real life just because of the sensations or whatever?

495
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:10,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, when you are going over this loop...

496
00:37:10,879 --> 00:37:11,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobbie!

497
00:37:34,138 --> 00:37:39,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby Blackwolf is defending his choices in chat saying Rob wanted to go drink before I got to the porn.

498
00:37:40,048 --> 00:37:41,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that is probably accurate.

499
00:37:41,169 --> 00:37:44,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I think booze over porn is... To be fair, that is probably accurate.

500
00:37:45,016 --> 00:37:46,899
[SPEAKER_02]: And besides that, porn is just really bad comedy.

501
00:37:48,939 --> 00:37:51,421
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so yes, try the Oculus Rift, people.

502
00:37:51,521 --> 00:38:03,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that I'm going to say you have that kind of money to buy one, but I'm sure these demos are going to start to get out there more and more at other expos and so forth.

503
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,011
[SPEAKER_08]: It was something you have to experience for yourself.

504
00:38:05,872 --> 00:38:10,195
[SPEAKER_08]: It very well could be the future of gaming, as we'll get into in gaming news here in a minute.

505
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:13,656
[SPEAKER_08]: But first, some quick housekeeping before we get into tonight's gaming news.

506
00:38:14,197 --> 00:38:16,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Please follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

507
00:38:16,798 --> 00:38:19,999
[SPEAKER_08]: You can also follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

508
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:23,181
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have a quick housekeeping note here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

509
00:38:23,681 --> 00:38:30,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Something that we did announce at our DragonCon panel on Saturday was that a new show is joining the Voice of Geeks Network Radio.

510
00:38:30,544 --> 00:38:31,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

511
00:38:31,824 --> 00:38:34,986
[SPEAKER_08]: And very happy to have this show on board with us.

512
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:40,088
[SPEAKER_08]: The show is Electric Sisterhood and it's going to be debuting Tuesdays at 5pm

513
00:38:40,668 --> 00:38:41,609
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm always getting screwed up by time.

514
00:38:41,969 --> 00:38:50,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Tuesdays at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern and this is really cool because it's going to lead right into Anime Jam Sessions pre-show and their live show.

515
00:38:50,676 --> 00:38:51,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we have a Tuesday block.

516
00:38:51,717 --> 00:38:55,540
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a Monday block, a Wednesday block, and a Tuesday block now instead of just one show on Tuesdays.

517
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,221
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's pretty nice.

518
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:57,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Have we gone up a level?

519
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,180
[SPEAKER_08]: We have leveled up.

520
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:05,002
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really like that Electric Sisterhood is very much a girl power show.

521
00:39:05,362 --> 00:39:08,003
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fronted by two sisters who live out of Boston.

522
00:39:08,483 --> 00:39:12,585
[SPEAKER_08]: And I love – obviously they have guys that they work with too.

523
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:15,766
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the Boston Bastard Brigade, some of them that we met at E3 and so forth.

524
00:39:15,806 --> 00:39:18,626
[SPEAKER_08]: And they do a lot with EGM now and so forth.

525
00:39:18,706 --> 00:39:19,987
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just –

526
00:39:20,547 --> 00:39:22,489
[SPEAKER_08]: I am loving what we're doing here at VOG

527
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,042
[SPEAKER_02]: We embrace diversity.

528
00:39:44,262 --> 00:39:44,823
[SPEAKER_08]: That is right.

529
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:49,888
[SPEAKER_02]: We play Genesis and Super Nintendo and TurboGrafx.

530
00:39:49,928 --> 00:39:55,975
[SPEAKER_08]: And once in a while, you may catch us off the air listening to Sonic US and Japanese soundtracks.

531
00:39:56,015 --> 00:39:56,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Just saying.

532
00:39:56,616 --> 00:39:57,797
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

533
00:39:57,837 --> 00:39:57,957
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

534
00:39:58,337 --> 00:39:58,958
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't happen.

535
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,481
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

536
00:40:02,221 --> 00:40:02,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma's in chat.

537
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:04,404
[SPEAKER_02]: That only happens when I hook up the Sega CD.

538
00:40:04,824 --> 00:40:08,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma's in chat very excited saying, East Coast run Tuesday nights on VOG Network.

539
00:40:08,747 --> 00:40:09,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I guess that is true.

540
00:40:09,627 --> 00:40:12,329
[SPEAKER_08]: It is an East Coast night Tuesday nights here at the Voice Geeks Network.

541
00:40:13,169 --> 00:40:21,515
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have a geek-centered show or you know someone that produces a geek-centered show that you think would be a good fit for the Voice Geeks Network, we are looking to add to our family even more.

542
00:40:21,775 --> 00:40:23,436
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get in touch with me, Rob, at

543
00:40:23,476 --> 00:40:24,756
[SPEAKER_08]: at vognetwork.com.

544
00:40:25,096 --> 00:40:35,459
[SPEAKER_08]: All we ask is that it be an established show because we want to make sure that the people are dedicated to their craft because so many podcasts do fizzle in the first few weeks, unfortunately.

545
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:38,219
[SPEAKER_08]: So we want to make sure that it's already established that the folks are dedicated.

546
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,200
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are a little filled up on video game shows at this point.

547
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:46,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Electric Sisterhood also focuses on video games, although they also do tech and anime.

548
00:40:46,781 --> 00:40:47,522
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're a little bit that.

549
00:40:47,562 --> 00:40:48,882
[SPEAKER_08]: So if your show is...

550
00:40:49,662 --> 00:41:14,586
[SPEAKER_08]: primarily video games that might be a bit too much for the network right now but we have big time openings for board games as a show I want real bad we don't have anything on comics and I'd love to get a comic based show I've been trying to talk to a couple people well where is that pilot madam well you know what I need to hear from a certain somebody who lives in the Bay Area why'd you make my accent come back but you get the idea so you can contact me again rob at vog network dot com

551
00:41:16,826 --> 00:41:22,789
[SPEAKER_04]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase SPOON.

552
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, enough promotion.

553
00:41:24,811 --> 00:41:26,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get into video game news.

554
00:41:26,432 --> 00:41:27,452
[SPEAKER_08]: It's what you guys are here for.

555
00:41:27,912 --> 00:41:28,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki!

556
00:41:28,873 --> 00:41:30,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so let's talk about promotion.

557
00:41:32,035 --> 00:41:36,677
[SPEAKER_06]: The Xbox One, they finally announced that their launch date will be the 22nd.

558
00:41:37,018 --> 00:41:44,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Also a Friday, also eight years after the Xbox 360 launch, and one week past the PlayStation 4 launch date.

559
00:41:44,742 --> 00:41:49,244
[SPEAKER_08]: and also one week before Black Friday, which is when you expect consoles are going to come out.

560
00:41:49,565 --> 00:41:50,745
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know.

561
00:41:50,805 --> 00:41:55,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Why were people so dead set on, oh, Xbox One's going to be the first to market and it has to be the first?

562
00:41:56,525 --> 00:41:58,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I still think it's coming out too early.

563
00:41:58,286 --> 00:41:59,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that they're not going to have enough...

564
00:42:17,413 --> 00:42:18,954
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost wanted to respond back.

565
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, it's not that impressive.

566
00:42:20,715 --> 00:42:21,915
[SPEAKER_06]: That's only two systems, buddy.

567
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:27,018
[SPEAKER_06]: That would have been rude of me, and I did not do that.

568
00:42:27,258 --> 00:42:31,460
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thought that in my head, laughed to myself, and went back to working.

569
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,961
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, so that is coming out there.

570
00:42:34,121 --> 00:42:36,022
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be launching in 13 markets.

571
00:42:37,003 --> 00:42:39,964
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, cool.

572
00:42:39,984 --> 00:42:41,805
[SPEAKER_06]: 500 bucks, all that fun stuff.

573
00:42:42,885 --> 00:42:46,088
[SPEAKER_06]: On top of that, though, there's going to be some minor tweaks.

574
00:42:46,448 --> 00:42:52,031
[SPEAKER_06]: One, they made the announcement that they're going to be upping the processor speed a little bit.

575
00:42:52,111 --> 00:43:02,538
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that they tested the system runs cool enough, and so now they can kick up the processor speed to 1.75 gigahertz instead of 1.6 gigahertz.

576
00:43:02,918 --> 00:43:08,562
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, the CPU got boosted early in August from, was it...

577
00:43:09,542 --> 00:43:11,604
[SPEAKER_06]: From 800 to 853 MHz.

578
00:43:12,505 --> 00:43:15,288
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of difference that's going to make, I don't think it's going to be night and day, but whatever.

579
00:43:16,429 --> 00:43:19,211
[SPEAKER_06]: So, cool, better specs.

580
00:43:19,311 --> 00:43:28,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, in Europe, you're going to be getting FIFA 14 with your Xbox One Day One Edition consoles.

581
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:32,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, there were a few retailers in case you didn't want the FIFA.

582
00:43:34,401 --> 00:43:36,382
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also get Forza 5.

583
00:43:36,542 --> 00:43:38,103
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I believe that's separate.

584
00:43:38,523 --> 00:43:41,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing like that announced yet for the U.S.

585
00:43:41,184 --> 00:43:42,044
[SPEAKER_06]: or North America.

586
00:43:43,825 --> 00:43:45,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Not sure if they're going to do anything like that.

587
00:43:45,886 --> 00:43:47,906
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I don't know.

588
00:43:48,006 --> 00:43:48,687
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be interesting.

589
00:43:50,087 --> 00:43:54,669
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also, there was... And this is like a bunch of bullet points from different things.

590
00:43:55,189 --> 00:44:21,936
[SPEAKER_06]: so the Xbox One can support up to 8 controllers at once remember the Playstation 3 can support up to 7 and I believe there was like NBA 2K used that and I don't know maybe FIFA and that's about it and then of course Playstation 4 only 4 so you know right there people are going there you go Xbox One is going to win this generation because they support 8 controllers when have you ever had that many people over playing one video game

591
00:44:22,376 --> 00:44:23,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I shouldn't say that.

592
00:44:23,698 --> 00:44:28,724
[SPEAKER_08]: There are parties and I've seen rock band nights and so forth, but that's so few and far between.

593
00:44:28,744 --> 00:44:30,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Implementation is going to be very limited.

594
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:40,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like I said, there is only a couple, like, I swear, less than five games that probably use that seven controller configuration because they're just not going to do that.

595
00:44:40,459 --> 00:44:58,164
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, sure, Microsoft would like you to believe that there's going to be a lot of situations that require that so you have to buy those extra controllers but I don't think that there's actually going to be you know, there's probably going to be four players like most games are going to be four players I don't think you're going to have eight people and definitely not split screen because that would be just fucking stupid

596
00:44:58,884 --> 00:44:59,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get me wrong.

597
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:00,826
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's cool.

598
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:08,673
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not knocking Xbox One for having that, but I'm just saying it's not the deal-maker or breaker that some people on the internet are making out to be.

599
00:45:08,713 --> 00:45:10,635
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, okay, neat.

600
00:45:10,775 --> 00:45:12,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see what games are going to do with that.

601
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:13,237
[SPEAKER_08]: What are games going to do with that?

602
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:15,880
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

603
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,582
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be better if you could hook up 8Kinects.

604
00:45:19,303 --> 00:45:19,783
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it would not.

605
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:21,004
[SPEAKER_06]: TV, TV, TV, TV, TV.

606
00:45:23,976 --> 00:45:29,782
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, and then also external storage will not be supported at launch.

607
00:45:29,922 --> 00:45:43,056
[SPEAKER_06]: So the 500 gigabyte hard drive that comes in there, well, that's going to have to be enough for a while because that's all you can do with it because you're not going to be able to store stuff using the USB ports yet.

608
00:45:45,298 --> 00:45:46,760
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hope those games aren't that big.

609
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I want the goose that lays the golden eggs.

610
00:46:06,132 --> 00:46:17,888
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that they think that the price point is still too high and that they keep trying to lure more people into buying the system Europe pays more for their systems though in games in general though, don't they?

611
00:46:17,968 --> 00:46:19,911
[SPEAKER_08]: When you convert dollars to euros and all that?

612
00:46:20,649 --> 00:46:21,530
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't fucking care about Madden.

613
00:46:41,425 --> 00:46:43,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but a lot of fucking people care about Madden.

614
00:46:43,747 --> 00:46:44,348
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that.

615
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:46,190
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a pretty big deal if they do get that.

616
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:57,441
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, as much as I'm sitting here saying I don't think people should have an expectation about it, if they do come out and say Madden's coming out free with the Xbox One, there's going to be a lot of people that are like, oh dude, but if you get Xbox One, you get Madden.

617
00:46:57,742 --> 00:47:01,185
[SPEAKER_08]: But I still think that price difference is going to be a little like, but it's also $100 more, dude.

618
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:28,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what they could do is like maybe some free live maybe or free something else yeah you know that doesn't really cost them anything like you know free like digital stuff you know maybe like a free you know you get well a killer instinct I don't know maybe that would be kind of you get killer instinct well you are getting that but then again you know it's free to play you know essentially at first demos free to play um

619
00:47:29,328 --> 00:47:29,608
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

620
00:47:29,628 --> 00:47:36,113
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it seems like you get more value with the PlayStation 4 as far as PlayStation Plus because you're getting some free games with that.

621
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:44,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe if they offer some free games with gold because they're doing that games with gold thing right now with Xbox 360.

622
00:47:45,761 --> 00:47:49,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they offer something like that for the Xbox One, like one of the games.

623
00:47:51,165 --> 00:47:51,465
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

624
00:47:51,485 --> 00:47:55,568
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's necessary, but I think that might be something they need to do when...

625
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,373
[SPEAKER_06]: and maybe that close to Black Friday.

626
00:48:00,393 --> 00:48:06,540
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to have some retailers doing that already.

627
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:07,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on.

628
00:48:07,761 --> 00:48:12,867
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't necessarily console-based, at least for now, but it looks like it might end up there.

629
00:48:12,987 --> 00:48:14,869
[SPEAKER_08]: This was some huge news that came out.

630
00:48:14,949 --> 00:48:16,611
[SPEAKER_08]: It technically was the week we were off

631
00:48:17,051 --> 00:48:17,671
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

632
00:48:44,464 --> 00:48:52,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it's not... I'm not... You're not supposed to say that because, you know, oh, well, there are some differences in the way things are... It's fucking Mega Man.

633
00:48:52,673 --> 00:48:53,214
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fucking Mega Man.

634
00:48:53,234 --> 00:48:54,235
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fucking Mega Man.

635
00:48:54,956 --> 00:48:59,361
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the game people want that Capcom, for whatever reason, figured would fail.

636
00:48:59,982 --> 00:49:05,107
[SPEAKER_08]: And now Capcom's having to eat a little crow with this because this Kickstarter currently... It was funded...

637
00:49:06,108 --> 00:49:07,969
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say within the first day.

638
00:49:07,989 --> 00:49:09,390
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple hours.

639
00:49:09,751 --> 00:49:10,511
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a couple hours.

640
00:49:10,551 --> 00:49:11,672
[SPEAKER_08]: And where is it at right now?

641
00:49:12,332 --> 00:49:13,833
[SPEAKER_08]: 1.8 million.

642
00:49:14,354 --> 00:49:14,854
[SPEAKER_08]: 1.8 million.

643
00:49:15,815 --> 00:49:17,636
[SPEAKER_08]: 32,000 backers with 22 days to go.

644
00:49:17,676 --> 00:49:20,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Which means now we get a Linux version, a Mac version.

645
00:49:20,317 --> 00:49:20,778
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

646
00:49:21,218 --> 00:49:24,060
[SPEAKER_08]: A making of documentary, New Game Plus, and Turbo Mode.

647
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost console versions.

648
00:49:25,761 --> 00:49:26,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Almost console versions.

649
00:49:26,961 --> 00:49:32,663
[SPEAKER_08]: If they hit 2.2 million, which they will, they're going to get PS3, 360, and Wii U versions of this game.

650
00:49:32,683 --> 00:49:36,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just upset that it uses Amazon Payments, which for some reason for me is not working.

651
00:49:36,605 --> 00:49:37,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, for Kickstarter?

652
00:49:37,285 --> 00:49:39,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this was going to take my Kickstarter virginity.

653
00:49:39,366 --> 00:49:39,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it?

654
00:49:39,886 --> 00:49:40,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Just hold out.

655
00:49:40,586 --> 00:49:40,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.

656
00:49:40,767 --> 00:49:42,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to... My body was ready.

657
00:49:42,927 --> 00:49:43,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

658
00:49:44,128 --> 00:49:45,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Because freaking Mega Man.

659
00:49:46,329 --> 00:49:46,629
Fuck!

660
00:49:48,314 --> 00:49:48,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough.

661
00:49:48,794 --> 00:49:50,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that need an explanation?

662
00:49:50,835 --> 00:49:52,015
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not Mega Man.

663
00:49:52,335 --> 00:49:53,496
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Mighty No.

664
00:49:53,516 --> 00:49:53,496
9.

665
00:49:54,016 --> 00:49:54,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not care.

666
00:49:54,796 --> 00:49:55,856
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be Mega Man in my heart.

667
00:49:55,876 --> 00:49:58,057
[SPEAKER_08]: The art is only similar because it's the same guy.

668
00:49:58,077 --> 00:49:59,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not care.

669
00:49:59,477 --> 00:50:00,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing.

670
00:50:00,518 --> 00:50:01,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not backing it.

671
00:50:01,418 --> 00:50:04,019
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not because I don't like it, but because...

672
00:50:04,999 --> 00:50:06,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I've kind of learned with Kickstarter stuff now.

673
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:11,744
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like I put money down now and the game doesn't come out until like late next year or something.

674
00:50:11,784 --> 00:50:13,185
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, no thanks.

675
00:50:13,365 --> 00:50:17,708
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just keep my money now and I'll buy it when it comes out because it's going to be probably about the same price anyways.

676
00:50:17,768 --> 00:50:19,469
[SPEAKER_06]: It's $10, $15 and you put down $10 or $15 for the game now.

677
00:50:19,529 --> 00:50:20,270
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like...

678
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:25,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

679
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:26,281
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

680
00:50:26,701 --> 00:50:31,503
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been very conservative with Kickstarter stuff, except for Video Game High School, of course.

681
00:50:31,803 --> 00:50:32,803
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll back anything they put out.

682
00:50:33,123 --> 00:50:36,165
[SPEAKER_08]: I found it very interesting in that video.

683
00:50:36,185 --> 00:50:37,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you guys watch the Kickstarter video?

684
00:50:37,685 --> 00:50:41,007
[SPEAKER_08]: The little five-minute, well-produced thing that had the pitch in it?

685
00:50:41,647 --> 00:50:50,891
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a very quick line, but something that really caught my attention was something about, he said, when the game he wanted to make or the game that he was making was canceled, he was devastated.

686
00:50:51,471 --> 00:51:18,989
[SPEAKER_08]: and this and I was kind of like wow so this whole like Mega Man universe thing really burned him to the point where he's gonna he's gonna make it anyway well you know it's not Mega Man but you know like this this is just so crazy to me how Capcom really just said you know what this franchise just isn't it was worth investing in anymore and now you've got 32,000 people in climbing saying yes it is

687
00:51:20,322 --> 00:51:25,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you had 100,000 people that joined that Facebook group, and then more.

688
00:51:25,305 --> 00:51:27,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but it's important to put your money where your mouth is.

689
00:51:27,426 --> 00:51:28,627
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what Kickstarter's all about, right?

690
00:51:28,647 --> 00:51:31,389
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that a lot of those people are going to put their money where their mouth is.

691
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:32,490
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they will, too.

692
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:37,813
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there are quite a few people like you that just don't want to participate in Kickstarter that will wait for the game to come out.

693
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:46,959
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of reasons why, especially that there's a lot of... We'll get into some of that stuff later on, but there's a lot of shady stuff that goes on with Kickstarter that some of these projects aren't worth backing.

694
00:51:46,999 --> 00:51:48,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to say that this one is one of those, but...

695
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,282
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just kind of... Is it the Ouya burn?

696
00:51:52,662 --> 00:51:53,562
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not the Ouya.

697
00:51:53,703 --> 00:51:57,465
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, like, there's other projects out there.

698
00:51:57,605 --> 00:52:01,727
[SPEAKER_06]: I've gotten into some of that stuff before, but you don't have to get so far off topic.

699
00:52:01,787 --> 00:52:06,870
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, I don't really want to... I've been very, you know, much... I'm going to put money down.

700
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:10,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I did that for Shadowrun and, like, Shadowrun Online and stuff.

701
00:52:10,652 --> 00:52:14,635
[SPEAKER_06]: And Shadowrun's awesome, and I haven't played that game since I got it.

702
00:52:15,075 --> 00:52:18,537
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I got the game, and I'm like, cool, I have the game.

703
00:52:18,806 --> 00:52:20,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I'm going to go off and do something else now.

704
00:52:20,547 --> 00:52:21,488
[SPEAKER_06]: And like Shadowrun Online.

705
00:52:21,528 --> 00:52:21,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool!

706
00:52:22,008 --> 00:52:23,349
[SPEAKER_06]: I pledged for that.

707
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:25,511
[SPEAKER_06]: And I haven't played that yet.

708
00:52:25,531 --> 00:52:28,734
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's still a few more games that I have back that haven't even come out yet.

709
00:52:29,454 --> 00:52:32,817
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just don't play them once I've paid for them.

710
00:52:33,766 --> 00:52:41,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's how Beck, the hero of Mega Man, which I think, isn't there supposed to be a female companion called Call?

711
00:52:41,847 --> 00:52:44,668
[SPEAKER_08]: So instead of Rock and Roll, we get Beck and Call, right?

712
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:46,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so here's how Beck is different.

713
00:52:47,168 --> 00:53:00,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Beck takes the abilities of the enemy robots he defeats, but he uses those abilities further, transforming parts of his body, like his limbs might become giant magnets, enabling him to walk up walls or rip away enemy shields.

714
00:53:00,871 --> 00:53:01,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

715
00:53:21,462 --> 00:53:23,403
[SPEAKER_08]: I was really concerned once they called the main character Beck

716
00:53:44,979 --> 00:53:48,027
[SPEAKER_08]: But once Call came to my attention, I was totally okay with it.

717
00:53:48,568 --> 00:53:50,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally fucking hate that band Beck.

718
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:52,799
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a band, it's a person.

719
00:53:52,819 --> 00:53:53,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

720
00:53:55,825 --> 00:53:57,806
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have two turntables and a microphone, you're banned.

721
00:53:57,826 --> 00:53:59,668
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like Alan's favorite musician.

722
00:53:59,688 --> 00:54:02,290
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Ghetto Chip Malfunction EP was really good.

723
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:03,250
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really good.

724
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:04,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Beck should do music for that.

725
00:54:04,731 --> 00:54:12,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, no, he shouldn't because they actually have the original lady that did the Mega Man 1 music is doing the music for this.

726
00:54:12,277 --> 00:54:14,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides that, Beck did a lot of the music for Scott Pilgrim.

727
00:54:14,558 --> 00:54:17,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me pull up the... Yes, I do.

728
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,101
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was great.

729
00:54:18,141 --> 00:54:23,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me pull up the Kickstarter real quick because... Sorry, live radio.

730
00:54:23,684 --> 00:54:24,165
[SPEAKER_08]: What can you do?

731
00:54:24,805 --> 00:54:28,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to actually play a little bit of this because they actually have it on the Kickstarter page.

732
00:54:28,868 --> 00:54:36,814
[SPEAKER_08]: They have some of the It's Not Mega Man, Mega Man number nine theme song by scrolling down here.

733
00:54:37,134 --> 00:54:40,236
[SPEAKER_08]: God, Lord, there's so much content on this page already.

734
00:54:43,219 --> 00:54:44,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this is terrible radio.

735
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:44,960
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very sorry, you guys.

736
00:54:46,141 --> 00:54:52,328
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like how he's the number nine because there were eight other bosses that he's gonna have to fight.

737
00:54:52,448 --> 00:55:01,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Manami Matsume did the soundtrack of the original Mega Man and the iconic soundtracks and she is going to be doing this game and already has the theme song out there.

738
00:55:08,395 --> 00:55:11,941
[SPEAKER_08]: You can just see the camera panning up the tall story building to this music.

739
00:55:12,482 --> 00:55:14,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I think they did that in the Kickstarter video.

740
00:55:14,827 --> 00:55:15,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't they?

741
00:55:15,989 --> 00:55:16,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they did.

742
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:18,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me fast forward a little bit so you get more of that vibe.

743
00:55:31,246 --> 00:55:32,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally not Mega Man.

744
00:55:32,647 --> 00:55:34,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally a new thing.

745
00:55:34,088 --> 00:55:34,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally.

746
00:55:35,088 --> 00:55:42,212
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta admit, though, the music, the vibe with the music between the first Rockman and second one had a completely different play vibe.

747
00:55:42,292 --> 00:55:48,035
[SPEAKER_08]: It did, and I gotta be honest, my favorite music was the first Mega Man game, like the Lechman stage and Gutsman.

748
00:55:48,075 --> 00:55:49,176
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, those are iconic to me.

749
00:55:49,196 --> 00:55:51,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually a really big fan of Fireman's music.

750
00:55:51,257 --> 00:55:55,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that two was bad, because you had things like Bubble Man, but one was great.

751
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:59,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally love those new characters that instead of having construction helmets, they have construction cones on their head.

752
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:05,688
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also the robotic dog that looks nothing like Rush, but is Rush.

753
00:56:07,229 --> 00:56:12,495
[SPEAKER_08]: So it does look like we're totally going to see this... It's not a bad thing, but dude, it's Mega Man.

754
00:56:12,695 --> 00:56:14,256
[SPEAKER_08]: No, and I'm excited about this.

755
00:56:14,336 --> 00:56:21,163
[SPEAKER_08]: And I like the art style they're going with it, because what I like about it is that... You remember how Mega Man 9 and 10 purposefully went retro?

756
00:56:21,724 --> 00:56:23,585
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

757
00:56:43,192 --> 00:56:45,173
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom brings up a good point.

758
00:56:46,273 --> 00:56:55,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Manami Matsume also did some of the soundtrack for Shovel Knight, which isn't Mega Man per se, but it was very... And that Kickstarter did crazy good too.

759
00:56:55,696 --> 00:56:56,636
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I backed that one.

760
00:56:56,656 --> 00:56:57,416
[SPEAKER_08]: I did back that one.

761
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:57,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I?

762
00:56:58,076 --> 00:56:59,577
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think I just missed it, unfortunately.

763
00:56:59,597 --> 00:57:00,057
[SPEAKER_08]: I backed it.

764
00:57:00,317 --> 00:57:00,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

765
00:57:01,097 --> 00:57:04,258
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll probably get it later when the game comes out, but...

766
00:57:05,658 --> 00:57:05,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

767
00:57:06,538 --> 00:57:14,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, I could talk about this further, but this game's happening, folks, and it'll at least be on Steam, but I'm hard-pressed to imagine it's not going to make it to PlayStation 3.

768
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:19,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we going to get a sidekick that's going to have a sword, too, and his name will be Minus?

769
00:57:19,641 --> 00:57:20,801
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that'll be a Mighty No.

770
00:57:20,821 --> 00:57:20,801
10.

771
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:21,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Mighty No.

772
00:57:21,661 --> 00:57:21,641
10.

773
00:57:22,821 --> 00:57:23,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Or whatever.

774
00:57:23,721 --> 00:57:25,102
[SPEAKER_08]: How will they call the sequels to this?

775
00:57:25,482 --> 00:57:30,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Because this isn't true, not Mega Man, unless you have Mighty No.

776
00:57:30,543 --> 00:57:31,463
[SPEAKER_08]: 9 Part 2, Mighty No.

777
00:57:31,483 --> 00:57:31,583
[SPEAKER_08]: 9 Part 3.

778
00:57:33,544 --> 00:57:35,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they'll do letters instead, that'll be how it differs.

779
00:57:35,787 --> 00:57:36,307
[SPEAKER_08]: MM9?

780
00:57:36,388 --> 00:57:38,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, Mighty No.

781
00:57:38,651 --> 00:57:40,173
[SPEAKER_08]: 9B, Mighty No.

782
00:57:40,293 --> 00:57:43,517
[SPEAKER_08]: 9C, I don't know, whatever.

783
00:57:44,619 --> 00:57:45,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

784
00:57:46,721 --> 00:57:47,001
[SPEAKER_02]: PS4, PS5, PS6

785
00:58:12,623 --> 00:58:19,368
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like they're trying to get past the move aspect and really lean toward the rift.

786
00:58:20,208 --> 00:58:21,289
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it seems like to me.

787
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:30,676
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I wonder if the PS4 is going to have games that are compatible with either or both or if they're going to insist on using just their headsets.

788
00:58:31,377 --> 00:58:36,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there is even a rumor still going around that Microsoft's going to go the same route.

789
00:58:36,103 --> 00:58:41,670
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, with their leaked... Remember their whole leaked game plan or whatever you want to call it?

790
00:58:44,092 --> 00:58:47,953
[SPEAKER_06]: with Kinect and stuff and this crazy VR shit with that.

791
00:58:49,353 --> 00:58:53,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Even with the Xbox One and the tagline for it and everything, it was all accurate.

792
00:58:53,494 --> 00:58:58,975
[SPEAKER_06]: So next year we're supposed to see some of this weird shit unless it gets pushed a little bit.

793
00:58:59,295 --> 00:59:06,257
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say next year to early 2015 we'll be hearing something about this, but I think it's the way it's going to go.

794
00:59:06,477 --> 00:59:14,038
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm telling you if a Sony executive or a Microsoft executive played the Oculus Rift, that's why they're trying to get a slice of it.

795
00:59:14,861 --> 00:59:20,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, and it seems like it's really just gaining a lot more speed for people developing for that kind of technology.

796
00:59:20,502 --> 00:59:22,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, look who they're getting, supporting it.

797
00:59:23,563 --> 00:59:25,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo, this is your chance.

798
00:59:25,723 --> 00:59:27,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo On, remember?

799
00:59:27,344 --> 00:59:28,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember that whole concept video?

800
00:59:29,844 --> 00:59:39,826
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no shame in going back and saying, hey, we saw that April Fool's joke or whatever you want, pre-E3 joke, and we're going to make it happen anyways.

801
00:59:39,926 --> 00:59:40,486
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

802
00:59:41,287 --> 00:59:43,227
[SPEAKER_02]: We could be seeing the return of the Virtual Boy.

803
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,355
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's so different.

804
00:59:46,555 --> 00:59:50,396
[SPEAKER_08]: The Virtual Boy was silly and the 3D didn't work very well and it was all one color.

805
00:59:50,456 --> 00:59:52,017
[SPEAKER_08]: The Oculus Rift is awesome.

806
00:59:52,197 --> 00:59:54,037
[SPEAKER_02]: But now the technology is there to make it work.

807
00:59:54,598 --> 01:00:07,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, imagine if you had something like, say, for your DS that would play the upper screen stuff through a virtual environment or even hook up your Wii to do a virtual Wii.

808
01:00:09,229 --> 01:00:10,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the thing about this.

809
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:16,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I'm excited for it, I would like to see something like this happen, especially if they can make it economical.

810
01:00:16,453 --> 01:00:18,494
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want all of gaming to go down this route.

811
01:00:19,254 --> 01:00:22,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I just don't want to see the entire industry hop on this.

812
01:00:23,096 --> 01:00:24,837
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all about the VR headsets.

813
01:00:24,877 --> 01:00:26,237
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just like motion gaming.

814
01:00:26,257 --> 01:00:26,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like 3D?

815
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:31,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's kind of like I don't want everybody to go there.

816
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:36,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Part of that has to do with the fact, again, I don't think you can play it for as long periods of time.

817
01:00:36,623 --> 01:00:39,505
[SPEAKER_08]: You have some serious accessibility issues with a VR headset.

818
01:00:39,905 --> 01:00:43,988
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know, Jamie, can you imagine if all your games were on a VR headset?

819
01:00:44,008 --> 01:00:48,331
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd probably be pissed because it's like... Well, I wouldn't buy them if they were all on a VR headset.

820
01:00:48,391 --> 01:00:50,172
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the final thing.

821
01:00:50,692 --> 01:00:58,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to have something that I can play that, number one, wouldn't make me want to barf all over the house and I could use a mouse.

822
01:00:58,978 --> 01:00:59,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

823
01:00:59,375 --> 01:01:00,976
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll always have indies.

824
01:01:01,196 --> 01:01:05,679
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if nothing else, we always have, you know, there'll always be people that don't want to develop for this kind of stuff.

825
01:01:05,699 --> 01:01:12,504
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm just saying, I like this as an enhancement, not as a, this is the rest of the industry forever.

826
01:01:12,784 --> 01:01:18,248
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I really do want to say that Nintendo really did give us the big idea.

827
01:01:18,268 --> 01:01:22,430
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to say was one of the first inspirations for this type of thing.

828
01:01:22,851 --> 01:01:29,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, we had those little virtual environment things before, like at QZAR, you know, where you could get in, it gave me a rotten headache.

829
01:01:30,116 --> 01:01:35,363
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Virtual Boy was the first attempt, I think, of bringing a gaming experience in a virtual environment home.

830
01:01:35,543 --> 01:01:41,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't it funny that Gunpei Yokoi got so much shit over that system, but yet maybe he was just really ahead of his time?

831
01:01:41,744 --> 01:01:43,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the problem with any wise invention.

832
01:01:44,686 --> 01:02:00,055
[SPEAKER_02]: How many great technologies come out that are basically shot down because of either the technology is not caught up to it, the concept is too advanced, or people are not used... Well, in the Virtual Boys case, it was that the technology wasn't truly there.

833
01:02:00,175 --> 01:02:01,936
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the red was the problem.

834
01:02:01,956 --> 01:02:04,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but the concept of that type of thing...

835
01:02:05,618 --> 01:02:13,842
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen different types of techs come out that are basically poo-pooed because they're not commercially viable.

836
01:02:14,702 --> 01:02:16,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Just look at our energy issues right now.

837
01:02:16,763 --> 01:02:22,366
[SPEAKER_02]: We could be running on very clean energy right now if it wasn't that petroleum was so marketable.

838
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:30,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, hell, Betamax was far superior to VHS, yet look what went out.

839
01:02:30,612 --> 01:02:32,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, because porn went VHS for one.

840
01:02:33,193 --> 01:02:35,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't VHS the cheaper option too?

841
01:02:35,073 --> 01:02:37,874
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little cheaper, but the better quality was the Betamax.

842
01:02:37,914 --> 01:02:42,896
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people are avoiding the better items because of market scare.

843
01:02:44,296 --> 01:02:45,636
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, yeah, you're right.

844
01:02:45,776 --> 01:02:50,518
[SPEAKER_02]: The technology wasn't there for the Virtual Boy, but it was a very advanced concept for its time.

845
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:56,561
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if it had waited another two years, it could have been something really great.

846
01:02:56,701 --> 01:02:58,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Or until the point that they could get full color on it.

847
01:02:58,723 --> 01:02:59,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Or until they could have done Mode 7.

848
01:03:00,183 --> 01:03:00,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy.

849
01:03:02,065 --> 01:03:02,305
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

850
01:03:02,365 --> 01:03:02,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow.

851
01:03:04,606 --> 01:03:05,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Up next, Loki.

852
01:03:06,067 --> 01:03:06,467
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

853
01:03:06,667 --> 01:03:13,992
[SPEAKER_06]: So there may be a slight delay in getting the Gaikai service for PlayStation 4 to roll out in Europe.

854
01:03:14,212 --> 01:03:17,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently the problem is to issues with...

855
01:03:17,734 --> 01:03:20,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Broadband Internet Availability in Europe

856
01:03:44,788 --> 01:03:49,990
[SPEAKER_06]: And now, I guess they touched upon issues in broadband in Europe.

857
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:57,873
[SPEAKER_06]: And during the presentation, they said that Europe is of course part of the roadmap, but the service will be deployed at some point in the future.

858
01:03:59,373 --> 01:04:03,395
[SPEAKER_06]: And for reasons outside of their control, it's been delayed.

859
01:04:03,955 --> 01:04:04,135
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

860
01:04:04,835 --> 01:04:12,998
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it kind of makes me wonder, you know, at the same time, remember all those features they were trying to push originally with the Xbox One and stuff and having to be always connected and having broadband internet?

861
01:04:13,018 --> 01:04:25,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, that would have been a real big clusterfuck in Europe because if they're having issues with, you know, some decent broadband in that area, I mean, what would have made people think, you know, this other cloud stuff's going to work?

862
01:04:25,422 --> 01:04:26,723
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

863
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:32,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, or as you brought up when all the fuckery with Final Fantasy XIV was happening a couple weeks ago.

864
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:34,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God, yeah.

865
01:04:34,723 --> 01:04:35,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that fixed now?

866
01:04:35,823 --> 01:04:37,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's a lot better now.

867
01:04:37,544 --> 01:04:49,588
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, obviously, there's still issues like what DarkSakura was talking about earlier that she's having and all these other weird, isolated things, but it's not on the large scale like we were having it, but there's still pain points, if that makes sense.

868
01:04:49,828 --> 01:04:50,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

869
01:04:51,649 --> 01:04:55,871
[SPEAKER_08]: But there is a good percentage of people who are playing like it is a normal video game at this point.

870
01:04:57,295 --> 01:05:01,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still going to document what my experience with their customer service is like tomorrow.

871
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:04,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, good luck getting through.

872
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,601
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard some nightmare stories about customer service.

873
01:05:06,641 --> 01:05:12,785
[SPEAKER_02]: But it seems that that's the only way people are getting anything to happen because they have so many tickets open and people keep reopening their ticket.

874
01:05:15,226 --> 01:05:16,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, anyhow, let's move on.

875
01:05:16,847 --> 01:05:21,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Something that is supposed to help you with your Xbox One experience is Smart Glass.

876
01:05:21,189 --> 01:05:27,633
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, Smart Glass, which I kind of was thinking Microsoft might have abandoned at one point because it came out for the 360 and then...

877
01:05:29,614 --> 01:05:30,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's it.

878
01:05:30,995 --> 01:05:42,542
[SPEAKER_08]: But Smart Glass is happening on Xbox One, and there was some more information this week in an interview with Xbox Wire from Microsoft General Manager Ron Pestner, who talked about that the app will be more responsive for one.

879
01:05:43,203 --> 01:05:45,824
[SPEAKER_08]: This app will connect to the Xbox One within four seconds.

880
01:05:46,285 --> 01:05:48,386
[SPEAKER_08]: That's much faster than the 360 connects today.

881
01:05:49,247 --> 01:05:53,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Up to 16 Smart Glass devices are supposed to connect with a single Xbox One console.

882
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:54,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

883
01:05:55,331 --> 01:06:15,589
[SPEAKER_08]: 8 controllers and 2 phones a person sounds plausible well no the smart glass devices would be like tablets so why would you need 16 fucking tablets or phones well I will put it I will give it this if it's supposed to be interactive with movies and second screen with that then people don't have to share one like each person could have one

884
01:06:16,189 --> 01:06:29,831
[SPEAKER_06]: or maybe it's like, you know, that somebody can be registered with the console and maybe you're talking family members too maybe, I don't know but smart glasses on phones, I think that having the 16 devices around if you have the people is not that hard to get

885
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:39,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, there could be the use for game controllers with this, but I don't think that's where they're actually going.

886
01:06:39,683 --> 01:06:42,023
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you can kind of use game control.

887
01:06:42,143 --> 01:06:46,685
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, not game control, but you can console control with smart glass today, but it's a little eh.

888
01:06:46,925 --> 01:06:48,305
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be fantastic.

889
01:06:48,405 --> 01:06:49,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, cool.

890
01:06:49,126 --> 01:06:54,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I can use on-screen digital game pads.

891
01:06:54,267 --> 01:06:56,268
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I still have that smart glass app on my phone.

892
01:06:56,829 --> 01:06:57,309
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't used it

893
01:07:17,407 --> 01:07:21,069
[SPEAKER_08]: That will aid players either in-game or through smart glass.

894
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:26,413
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can actually say Xbox Help, and then the help thing will appear in the console.

895
01:07:26,633 --> 01:07:33,157
[SPEAKER_08]: But you can also do it in smart glass, where you click on the help icon, and it will show you exactly whatever it is that you want to see there.

896
01:07:33,957 --> 01:07:42,783
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be noted, though, when you do say Xbox Help, you'll see a poof of smoke, and then out from the shadows, Clippy will arrive.

897
01:07:42,803 --> 01:07:42,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

898
01:07:45,507 --> 01:07:46,567
[SPEAKER_08]: You summon me?

899
01:07:47,248 --> 01:07:49,848
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like you're trying to access Killer Instinct.

900
01:07:50,708 --> 01:07:52,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Choose one of these three options.

901
01:07:52,289 --> 01:07:52,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God.

902
01:07:53,649 --> 01:07:55,329
[SPEAKER_08]: I can only imagine what that's going to look like.

903
01:07:56,129 --> 01:08:04,311
[SPEAKER_08]: But, yeah, I mean, I'm just curious, like, okay, well, how is this second screen experience going to really be enhanced?

904
01:08:05,312 --> 01:08:08,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Because smart glass as it is right now is kind of, eh?

905
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:09,332
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

906
01:08:10,193 --> 01:08:11,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, that's it.

907
01:08:13,014 --> 01:08:14,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Smart Glass on Xbox One.

908
01:08:14,876 --> 01:08:18,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully it will be something that doesn't fade away in a few months.

909
01:08:20,001 --> 01:08:20,901
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura?

910
01:08:21,282 --> 01:08:26,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there is actually some stuff going on for Microsoft in Europe right now.

911
01:08:29,304 --> 01:08:37,731
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's going on is that they have this Xbox Live Rewards thing that's going to be going on where basically you get rewards for playing new games.

912
01:08:38,411 --> 01:08:48,219
[SPEAKER_02]: As it works is that if you play a new game for more than 10 hours, a disc-based release on top of that, you get 1,000 credits every time you play a game.

913
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:53,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in the UK, that would be 67 pence.

914
01:08:53,823 --> 01:08:56,145
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a soda, I think.

915
01:08:56,665 --> 01:09:00,087
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically, in North America, I think it's 1,000 credits equals a dollar.

916
01:09:00,387 --> 01:09:00,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

917
01:09:01,648 --> 01:09:08,352
[SPEAKER_02]: So, at any rate, of course, you know, the more games you play, the more rewards you get, the more points you get.

918
01:09:08,973 --> 01:09:13,836
[SPEAKER_02]: And, like, if you get up between 3,000 to 9,999, you get Contender.

919
01:09:14,936 --> 01:09:21,640
[SPEAKER_02]: And the lowest is where you just get 50 credits back on every little bit that you spend.

920
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:23,501
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be the equivalent of 800 Microsoft points.

921
01:09:24,082 --> 01:09:24,222
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

922
01:09:26,169 --> 01:09:27,570
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

923
01:09:45,046 --> 01:09:46,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's how you earn credits in this.

924
01:09:46,747 --> 01:09:54,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, you can complete an apps punch card, which I think you have to buy so many apps or something or use the apps for so long.

925
01:09:54,472 --> 01:09:56,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that like how when I buy 10 pink berries, I get a free one?

926
01:09:57,154 --> 01:09:57,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Something like that.

927
01:09:58,654 --> 01:09:59,195
[SPEAKER_06]: That's weird.

928
01:09:59,335 --> 01:10:02,257
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a complete My Map Pack punch card.

929
01:10:02,297 --> 01:10:05,459
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you buy so many map packs, you get 5,000 credits.

930
01:10:06,759 --> 01:10:09,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Make your first Xbox store purchase 1,250 credits.

931
01:10:11,162 --> 01:10:14,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Complete My Movies and TV Punch Card, 3,000 credits.

932
01:10:15,004 --> 01:10:16,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Take a Survey, 250 credits.

933
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:23,309
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also see Play a New Game for 10 Hours is 1,000 credits.

934
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:25,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Refer a Friend, 1,000 credits.

935
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:27,172
[SPEAKER_08]: This sounds like how to get a badge in Steam.

936
01:10:27,452 --> 01:10:28,152
[SPEAKER_08]: One of those badges.

937
01:10:28,192 --> 01:10:29,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Renew membership.

938
01:10:29,753 --> 01:10:32,855
[SPEAKER_06]: What I want to know is how many fucking credits do I get on my birthday?

939
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:34,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it used to be 25 cents.

940
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:36,817
[SPEAKER_06]: So is that any better now?

941
01:10:36,877 --> 01:10:39,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I get 25 cents still?

942
01:10:39,558 --> 01:10:42,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is it like, you know, 50 cents?

943
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:45,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, inflation and interest and all that.

944
01:10:47,172 --> 01:10:48,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a little bribery.

945
01:10:48,554 --> 01:10:52,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, I think the playing 10 hours thing is a little excessive.

946
01:10:53,279 --> 01:10:55,201
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it can't be 10 hours at a time.

947
01:10:55,221 --> 01:10:58,024
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be something that you're going to play for a couple of days and then you get your thing.

948
01:10:58,105 --> 01:10:58,865
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's during the month.

949
01:10:58,885 --> 01:11:00,567
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's within a month of it releasing.

950
01:11:00,727 --> 01:11:03,811
[SPEAKER_08]: If I was getting Kingdom Hearts HD on 360, that might be happening.

951
01:11:04,150 --> 01:11:04,930
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

952
01:11:27,742 --> 01:11:32,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, and I easily sunk 100 hours into Mass Effect across three months.

953
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:34,225
[SPEAKER_08]: I should be ashamed to say.

954
01:11:34,285 --> 01:11:37,727
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would have hit this 10 hours easy when Mass Effect first came out.

955
01:11:37,807 --> 01:11:39,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I did do that in one day.

956
01:11:40,408 --> 01:11:42,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to think 10 hours isn't that ridiculous.

957
01:11:43,989 --> 01:11:45,030
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a cap, though.

958
01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:46,210
[SPEAKER_06]: I know what you can get a month.

959
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:48,651
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as it wasn't 10 hours over and over and over and over and over again.

960
01:11:48,832 --> 01:11:51,673
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, 10 hours is not too hard to meet.

961
01:11:52,813 --> 01:11:54,034
[SPEAKER_08]: I know people that watch that much TV.

962
01:11:55,353 --> 01:12:23,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the other thing though with having that 10 hour limitation is that they basically also discourage any return time I know that like and I only know GameStops because Dan managed one their return policy was like a full refund in 7 days and not, I don't know how many people are going to get 10 hours of gameplay say it's like the average student okay, you got school all day, you have homework, you come home and then are you really going to have a lot of time to play, most of the playing is going to be done on the weekends

963
01:12:24,408 --> 01:12:27,310
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to cut out some of that return time right there.

964
01:12:27,470 --> 01:12:33,013
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I see the 10 hours coming in, but at the same time, I think it's a little underhanded.

965
01:12:33,253 --> 01:12:34,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's only really 20 minutes a day.

966
01:12:34,654 --> 01:12:36,675
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's true.

967
01:12:37,075 --> 01:12:41,237
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's 20 minutes you could be exercising or you could play some Mass Effect.

968
01:12:41,417 --> 01:12:42,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Exercise your fingers.

969
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:48,961
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's travel around the world and check out what games you can sink 10 hours into this month as we look at some release dates.

970
01:12:51,772 --> 01:12:58,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, so this week we've got NHL 14 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

971
01:12:59,755 --> 01:13:03,496
[SPEAKER_06]: On PC, the Elder Scrolls Anthology.

972
01:13:03,596 --> 01:13:08,538
[SPEAKER_06]: If you just learned about this Elder Scrolls series, you can pick up all of those games.

973
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:11,219
[SPEAKER_08]: All the cool kids are playing this Elder Scrolls.

974
01:13:11,239 --> 01:13:12,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly, Elder Scrolls.

975
01:13:12,739 --> 01:13:14,720
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like games for old people.

976
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:22,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Kingdom Hearts HD, uh, or 1.5 HD Remix on PlayStation 3 this week.

977
01:13:23,305 --> 01:13:25,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Puppeteer on PlayStation 3.

978
01:13:25,626 --> 01:13:32,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, The Sims 3 has a, an expansion pack coming out, Sims 3 Movie Stuff.

979
01:13:33,831 --> 01:13:35,332
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's coming out this week as well.

980
01:13:36,153 --> 01:13:37,654
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, on Vita...

981
01:13:38,434 --> 01:13:46,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully, and actually a good first person shooter now on the Vita, Killzone Mercenary coming out this week as well.

982
01:13:49,227 --> 01:13:51,469
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that's it, I think.

983
01:13:51,589 --> 01:13:55,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me quickly glance over this real quick.

984
01:13:55,854 --> 01:13:57,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't forget anything.

985
01:13:57,736 --> 01:13:58,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, that would be it.

986
01:13:59,355 --> 01:14:01,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's something that I was looking at the other day.

987
01:14:29,218 --> 01:14:51,188
[SPEAKER_08]: was it here's here's what it looks like isn't this uh no it's like a girly band never mind that's yeah this is like girly band karaoke pretty swimsuit photos yeah that's not what I think it is I was thinking of uh something else why is this labeled adventure is this like the spice world game or something who knows I don't know wait a minute that was the limited edition let me look at the regular one

988
01:14:52,068 --> 01:14:54,049
[SPEAKER_08]: The regular one, are there screenshots?

989
01:14:54,269 --> 01:14:55,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope, just the box art.

990
01:14:56,430 --> 01:15:00,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty Japanese girls, some playing the guitar, some are getting married, whatever.

991
01:15:01,093 --> 01:15:03,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering if that was like an AKB48 thing.

992
01:15:03,474 --> 01:15:03,594
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

993
01:15:04,654 --> 01:15:09,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Max Payne 3, it goes into the classics, so that means a price reduction this week in Japan on September the 12th.

994
01:15:10,717 --> 01:15:17,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Going over to the Xbox 360, Just Air Conflicts Vietnam is the only release that is also on the 360 this week.

995
01:15:18,401 --> 01:15:19,142
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

996
01:15:38,594 --> 01:16:01,705
[SPEAKER_08]: on the 14th there's quite a few games because uh old Monster Hunter 4 is being released on the 3ds which is kind of a big deal uh there's a shit ton of peripherals that go with that for Monster Hunter 4 such as like you know you want a new stand for it or a sticker or pouches or what have you that is huge uh there's also a special 3ds ll coming out for Monster Hunter 4 there's a

997
01:16:02,405 --> 01:16:04,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Black version and a white version.

998
01:16:04,066 --> 01:16:05,866
[SPEAKER_08]: There's special packs that come with the game.

999
01:16:06,246 --> 01:16:07,427
[SPEAKER_08]: That is on the 14th.

1000
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:17,330
[SPEAKER_08]: So I imagine that's Japan's big release and the one that actually some people over here would probably be importing because I know some people are really into their Monster Hunter.

1001
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:21,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony PSP, not to be left out in the cold.

1002
01:16:22,272 --> 01:16:29,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, PSP, not V. Brothers Conflict Brilliant Blue in regular and limited edition this week on the PSP.

1003
01:16:30,814 --> 01:16:32,295
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1004
01:16:49,664 --> 01:16:52,505
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 12th, we have Arma 3 and NHL 14.

1005
01:16:53,285 --> 01:17:03,788
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the 13th, we have I Am Alive on PC, King of Fighters 13 Steam Edition, Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix, and Rayman Legends on the Vita.

1006
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:06,569
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1007
01:17:07,529 --> 01:17:11,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week, Loki.

1008
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:16,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so Steam is adding some more stuff to their trading system.

1009
01:17:17,421 --> 01:17:21,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Now they have this Steam Trade Offers program.

1010
01:17:21,843 --> 01:17:33,106
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess what it allows you to do is allows, I guess, friends to suggest trade deals for inventory items, which you can accept, counter, or decline.

1011
01:17:34,466 --> 01:17:37,367
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess it's a way to negotiate deals.

1012
01:17:38,047 --> 01:17:39,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Cards, maybe?

1013
01:17:39,247 --> 01:17:39,648
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1014
01:17:39,768 --> 01:17:42,889
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be nice if I could trade my games that I have that I don't use.

1015
01:17:44,850 --> 01:17:46,050
[SPEAKER_06]: But, uh, yeah.

1016
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:47,571
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's what they have right now.

1017
01:17:48,311 --> 01:17:54,593
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess you can check out other people's inventories and so, like, if they have a card that you want or something, you can be like, hey, can I have that card?

1018
01:17:55,233 --> 01:17:56,594
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll trade you my other card.

1019
01:18:02,009 --> 01:18:04,933
[SPEAKER_08]: More stuff on Steam to waste your time and money.

1020
01:18:06,135 --> 01:18:06,936
[SPEAKER_08]: I was very disappointed.

1021
01:18:06,976 --> 01:18:09,359
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't get a single booster pack while I was at DragonCon.

1022
01:18:09,659 --> 01:18:12,764
[SPEAKER_08]: But I bet the card trading died down because the summer sale is over.

1023
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:15,394
[SPEAKER_06]: So how do you get booster packs?

1024
01:18:15,754 --> 01:18:23,780
[SPEAKER_08]: I play a lot of... Once you've got the most... Let's say a game has six cards available.

1025
01:18:24,341 --> 01:18:26,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Three of them will drop as you play the game.

1026
01:18:26,623 --> 01:18:28,924
[SPEAKER_08]: For every 20 minutes you play the game, you get a card.

1027
01:18:29,285 --> 01:18:31,666
[SPEAKER_08]: But up to half the most that's in the set.

1028
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:36,991
[SPEAKER_08]: After you've got all those drops, you're eligible for a booster pack.

1029
01:18:37,411 --> 01:18:42,054
[SPEAKER_08]: So when someone else crafts a badge, somebody in the community at random will get a booster pack.

1030
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:44,316
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's how it keeps going.

1031
01:18:44,476 --> 01:18:47,118
[SPEAKER_08]: So the more people craft, the more booster packs that go out.

1032
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:48,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1033
01:18:48,879 --> 01:18:52,041
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I got all mine in Saints Row 4 because I have four cards.

1034
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:55,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it say that you have any left to earn?

1035
01:18:57,325 --> 01:18:59,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't see how in Saints Row 4.

1036
01:18:59,126 --> 01:19:00,267
[SPEAKER_08]: You've probably played that to death.

1037
01:19:01,639 --> 01:19:03,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't have any more to earn.

1038
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:05,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I have duplicates even, thank God.

1039
01:19:06,263 --> 01:19:09,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so you'll be eligible for booster packs for Saints Row 4.

1040
01:19:09,366 --> 01:19:13,870
[SPEAKER_08]: But to be honest, some people trade them, but I just got to the point where I got lazy.

1041
01:19:14,031 --> 01:19:18,435
[SPEAKER_08]: I sold all my duplicates in the marketplace and then bought what I wanted to make badges.

1042
01:19:19,116 --> 01:19:19,536
[SPEAKER_08]: It worked.

1043
01:19:20,757 --> 01:19:21,178
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.

1044
01:19:21,978 --> 01:19:24,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft saying, I got a Team Fortress 2 booster pack yesterday.

1045
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:27,301
[SPEAKER_08]: So some people are getting them.

1046
01:19:28,561 --> 01:19:28,801
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1047
01:19:29,662 --> 01:19:33,304
[SPEAKER_08]: I got some music game news for you guys before we get into the classic game of the week.

1048
01:19:33,344 --> 01:19:36,725
[SPEAKER_08]: And the first game I want to talk about is a game called Cross Beats.

1049
01:19:37,405 --> 01:19:45,909
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Cross X Beats, which makes me think this game is called Cross Cross Beats, which actually would make sense because guess who's making Cross Cross Beats?

1050
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:46,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Guess who the producer is?

1051
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:52,092
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Naoki Midea is actually producing this game for Capcom.

1052
01:19:52,493 --> 01:19:55,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh.

1053
01:19:55,234 --> 01:19:56,555
[SPEAKER_08]: He no longer works at Konami.

1054
01:19:56,655 --> 01:19:58,396
[SPEAKER_08]: He left Konami a year ago.

1055
01:19:58,416 --> 01:20:00,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably when they stopped making DDR.

1056
01:20:00,357 --> 01:20:02,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if you... Well, no, they're still making DDR.

1057
01:20:02,698 --> 01:20:03,278
[SPEAKER_06]: In the US.

1058
01:20:03,558 --> 01:20:04,439
[SPEAKER_08]: It's different producers.

1059
01:20:04,579 --> 01:20:05,039
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway...

1060
01:20:05,599 --> 01:20:30,687
[SPEAKER_08]: um if you don't know who Naoki is you know we used to talk a lot about DDR back in the day and Naoki used to be the producer of DDR he did a lot of songs that were very famous that were in the game he had all these different pseudonyms that he created songs under you know he was a big driving force behind the music in the game so it goes without saying that a lot of these fans of Bamani projects in the past Naoki was still a Konami for a very long time I mean he did Dance Masters he did the um

1061
01:20:32,047 --> 01:20:37,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Dance Dance Party or whatever that game was that wasn't so bad on the 360 arcade.

1062
01:20:38,448 --> 01:20:39,288
[SPEAKER_08]: That was all Naoki.

1063
01:20:40,149 --> 01:20:44,289
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's left Konami now and with Capcom he's going to do Cross Cross Beats.

1064
01:20:44,729 --> 01:20:45,710
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an iOS game.

1065
01:20:45,770 --> 01:20:47,110
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a rhythm game on iOS.

1066
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:49,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a lot known about the game.

1067
01:20:49,570 --> 01:20:50,710
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know when it's coming out.

1068
01:20:50,851 --> 01:20:53,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Rumor is it could show up at Tokyo Game Show.

1069
01:20:53,171 --> 01:20:54,211
[SPEAKER_08]: That would certainly make sense.

1070
01:20:54,851 --> 01:20:58,052
[SPEAKER_08]: But it looks like the game is played with tapping, swiping, flicking...

1071
01:20:59,252 --> 01:21:06,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably, considering it's on a touchscreen, it'll probably get some easy similarities to Elite Beat Agents and Technica and that style of play.

1072
01:21:06,474 --> 01:21:11,375
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm sure there'll be unique things that differentiate it, such as the music.

1073
01:21:12,715 --> 01:21:18,236
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've been playing Monty Games for a while, you might recognize Totch is also doing some of the songs.

1074
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:24,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Void, Simon, who some think are DJ Simon, and all those guys appeared in Beatmania 2DX and the like.

1075
01:21:24,458 --> 01:21:25,058
[SPEAKER_01]: That's happy news.

1076
01:21:25,098 --> 01:21:25,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Over the years.

1077
01:21:27,058 --> 01:21:48,643
[SPEAKER_08]: um also speaking of music games uh Theatrhythm apparently set to get a sequel Theatrhythm the Final Fantasy music game on 3DS I guess did well enough to necessitate a sequel called Final Fantasy Curtain Call no idea what this could be um but but my thought is could it maybe be that this is the fully packaged game with all the DLC um

1078
01:21:50,124 --> 01:22:16,805
[SPEAKER_08]: so I wouldn't necessarily think it's a full sequel but certainly Square has enough music in their archive especially if you were to throw like Chrono Trigger and you know other Square games into the mix The Secret of Mana and Evermore and all those games you know I'm sure there would be enough music to fill up a second game but I'm wondering if Curtain Call wouldn't just be like a you know end of the year edition that packages everything and maybe a couple bonus tracks to try and sell this game all over again

1079
01:22:17,691 --> 01:22:18,111
[SPEAKER_08]: SquareLikesMoney

1080
01:22:45,735 --> 01:22:46,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Who doesn't like money?

1081
01:22:47,258 --> 01:22:49,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's go to the classic game of the week.

1082
01:22:50,002 --> 01:22:53,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Back when games were very expensive, no matter what it was you were buying.

1083
01:22:54,549 --> 01:22:55,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they were all in cartridges.

1084
01:22:57,449 --> 01:23:01,512
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura is going to go into the vault and find a game that she thinks that you kids should be playing this week.

1085
01:23:02,233 --> 01:23:05,235
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, what is the expensive cartridge classic game of the week?

1086
01:23:05,255 --> 01:23:08,838
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Miracle Warriors, Seal of the Dark Lord for the Sega Master System.

1087
01:23:09,139 --> 01:23:11,841
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, I'm sorry that I couldn't find a longer music sample.

1088
01:23:11,961 --> 01:23:14,303
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the Let's Plays had freaking people talking over it.

1089
01:23:14,623 --> 01:23:15,324
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking annoying.

1090
01:23:15,524 --> 01:23:18,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't listen to the stupid thing to hear your voice.

1091
01:23:18,887 --> 01:23:19,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear it.

1092
01:23:19,647 --> 01:23:21,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I watch it to watch the game.

1093
01:23:21,669 --> 01:23:21,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1094
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:26,473
[SPEAKER_02]: In Japan, it was known as Hajan no Fuin, which is Seal of the Dark Lord.

1095
01:23:27,033 --> 01:23:30,734
[SPEAKER_02]: and it came out on the PC-88 and then was ported to other systems.

1096
01:23:31,154 --> 01:23:33,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, we got it on the Master System over here.

1097
01:23:33,835 --> 01:23:35,615
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very similar to Phantasy Star.

1098
01:23:35,935 --> 01:23:42,577
[SPEAKER_02]: It has this grid-type map to show you where parts of interest are in the game.

1099
01:23:43,577 --> 01:23:47,258
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also has this sort of traveling feature, it looks like.

1100
01:23:47,338 --> 01:23:55,240
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, in this game, you play the hero and you have different parts of your screen that indicate what you do in the game.

1101
01:23:56,500 --> 01:24:04,402
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to collect all these mystical weapons and the armor and defeat the bad guy named Terrarine and seal the Dark Lord around.

1102
01:24:05,182 --> 01:24:09,703
[SPEAKER_02]: So each of the areas on the screen, there's four parts.

1103
01:24:10,263 --> 01:24:15,204
[SPEAKER_02]: You have your stats on the lower left that also lists all your party stats.

1104
01:24:15,905 --> 01:24:21,306
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the right you have your money, your weapon, that type of thing.

1105
01:24:22,507 --> 01:24:28,416
[SPEAKER_02]: You also have a kind of maze map on top that's more grid shape that shows you where you are laid out.

1106
01:24:28,856 --> 01:24:31,901
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have sort of a walking section, the upper left one.

1107
01:24:32,321 --> 01:24:35,946
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll either show you the world you're walking in or the cave that you're walking in and your surroundings.

1108
01:24:36,367 --> 01:24:37,609
[SPEAKER_02]: In battle it shows you your foes.

1109
01:24:38,910 --> 01:24:42,212
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it is built on a grid format.

1110
01:24:42,272 --> 01:24:45,173
[SPEAKER_02]: You can move around and you visit other places.

1111
01:24:45,853 --> 01:24:48,975
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows you where you need to be based on white squares that are there.

1112
01:24:49,215 --> 01:24:53,277
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a pretty classic RPG.

1113
01:24:53,357 --> 01:24:57,779
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is one of the, I'd have to say, one of the top ones for the Master System.

1114
01:24:58,799 --> 01:25:06,462
[SPEAKER_02]: You also have different types of things that happen to you in the game.

1115
01:25:07,103 --> 01:25:10,604
[SPEAKER_02]: There's flame spells that you can be attacked with, sleep spells, the usual ones.

1116
01:25:11,345 --> 01:25:16,587
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time you're put to sleep, you take damage, which I think is a little bit different than a lot of RPGs.

1117
01:25:18,788 --> 01:25:18,988
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

1118
01:25:21,801 --> 01:25:25,182
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all kinds of different strategies that you have to use to make it through the game.

1119
01:25:25,282 --> 01:25:28,123
[SPEAKER_02]: And the world itself has three continents.

1120
01:25:28,743 --> 01:25:30,124
[SPEAKER_02]: There's different types of land.

1121
01:25:30,164 --> 01:25:31,944
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the plain, forest, mountains, and desert.

1122
01:25:32,624 --> 01:25:37,646
[SPEAKER_02]: And each place, of course, has its own type of enemies that are indigenous to such land.

1123
01:25:38,326 --> 01:25:39,267
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got your talents too.

1124
01:25:39,307 --> 01:25:44,549
[SPEAKER_02]: You have smiths who can repair your weapons and healers and different shops.

1125
01:25:44,689 --> 01:25:48,371
[SPEAKER_02]: It's typical RPG fare, but it is one of the early ones.

1126
01:25:50,512 --> 01:25:52,933
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is Miracle Warriors, Seal of the Dark Lord.

1127
01:25:53,554 --> 01:25:55,194
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have it, why not?

1128
01:25:56,035 --> 01:25:58,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably because not many people have a master system anymore.

1129
01:25:58,716 --> 01:25:59,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, not anymore.

1130
01:25:59,456 --> 01:26:01,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Find yourself a power-based converter.

1131
01:26:01,958 --> 01:26:03,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Hook it into your Genesis.

1132
01:26:03,498 --> 01:26:04,019
[SPEAKER_02]: You're good to go.

1133
01:26:05,046 --> 01:26:08,449
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is, your classic game of the week for the Sega Master System, Miracle Warriors.

1134
01:26:09,890 --> 01:26:11,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice obscure pick, DarkSakura.

1135
01:26:11,851 --> 01:26:16,755
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of one I had to look into it a little more and I did watch some of those Let's Plays with the people talking and I was like, oh, okay.

1136
01:26:17,215 --> 01:26:18,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Dungeon Buster's actually funny.

1137
01:26:18,496 --> 01:26:21,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Terror in the Dark Lord who is a half-naked demoness at the end of the game.

1138
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:26,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you have this game on Sega Master System or was this just something you... I think I have two copies of this game.

1139
01:26:26,162 --> 01:26:26,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.

1140
01:26:26,743 --> 01:26:28,284
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, or is this something you came across later?

1141
01:26:28,804 --> 01:26:34,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, Dan already had some of his games, and he came into a box of Master System games for dirt cheap.

1142
01:26:34,929 --> 01:26:41,234
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we will be doing... Actually, I was going to say, we are going to be starting to sell off some of the collection.

1143
01:26:42,597 --> 01:26:45,518
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to give VOG listeners first chance.

1144
01:26:46,118 --> 01:26:50,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever we put up an auction, I'm giving VOG listeners first go at it.

1145
01:26:51,879 --> 01:26:52,259
[SPEAKER_02]: We will post it.

1146
01:26:52,279 --> 01:26:53,499
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you going to do that?

1147
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:54,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter, Tumblr?

1148
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:55,020
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, forums.

1149
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:55,380
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1150
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:57,680
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just had Ninja Gaiden.

1151
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:02,161
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually still have Ninja Gaiden Trilogy up on eBay right now if you've got $300.

1152
01:27:03,442 --> 01:27:05,282
[SPEAKER_02]: In the box, manual, mint condition.

1153
01:27:05,542 --> 01:27:06,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Super rare game.

1154
01:27:06,462 --> 01:27:07,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Super rare game.

1155
01:27:08,063 --> 01:27:08,763
[SPEAKER_08]: But great game.

1156
01:27:09,023 --> 01:27:09,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1157
01:27:10,507 --> 01:27:16,431
[SPEAKER_08]: If I knew it was going to go for that, I would have stolen the copy that I rented from my local store when I was younger.

1158
01:27:16,451 --> 01:27:18,733
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have Final Fight Guy, which is probably going up soon.

1159
01:27:18,973 --> 01:27:22,776
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to take a quick break, but we've got plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

1160
01:27:22,816 --> 01:27:38,067
[SPEAKER_08]: The Fugle Question of the Week, some news on a new MOBA that's based off a familiar franchise, a fan-made movie, which I'm sure will get shut down in a matter of time, Rapid Fire News, and your calls and tweets and so forth when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1161
01:27:44,131 --> 01:27:53,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this Sunday evening, September 8th, 2013 with the 518th episode of our program.

1162
01:27:53,678 --> 01:28:03,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we get back into some gaming news with Rapid Fire News, I did want to mention and thank here on the program our good buddy Jason, or VXJasonXV if you will.

1163
01:28:03,485 --> 01:28:03,565
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1164
01:28:21,670 --> 01:28:23,752
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1165
01:28:42,049 --> 01:28:42,769
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki,

1166
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:03,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1167
01:29:20,567 --> 01:29:23,649
[SPEAKER_08]: So, big thanks to MidiHead.

1168
01:29:24,190 --> 01:29:25,591
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't plug him enough.

1169
01:29:25,691 --> 01:29:27,452
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's still going at MidiHead.com.

1170
01:29:27,492 --> 01:29:33,857
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe he does a lot of sounds and incidental stuff for actually for use for podcasting and so forth.

1171
01:29:33,897 --> 01:29:38,160
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you like our intro, maybe MidiHead can do something for you for a small fee.

1172
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:45,485
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's get back into some gaming news with Rapid Fire News and a lot of stuff tonight.

1173
01:29:45,525 --> 01:29:45,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

1174
01:29:46,325 --> 01:29:48,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so let's see.

1175
01:29:49,488 --> 01:29:59,595
[SPEAKER_06]: As I was talking about with Rob and Jimmy earlier, there was a Mass Effect texture pack for the Minecraft Xbox 360 version.

1176
01:29:59,955 --> 01:30:07,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, not only does it kind of reskin everything, it also includes a level based off of the Mars facility.

1177
01:30:08,661 --> 01:30:09,482
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of cool.

1178
01:30:09,742 --> 01:30:16,927
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you also get character skins along with that so you can play as your characters and create your own worlds and do all that fun stuff.

1179
01:30:17,067 --> 01:30:18,828
[SPEAKER_06]: So check it out.

1180
01:30:18,888 --> 01:30:22,631
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only $2, or I'm sorry, $4 is what that's available for.

1181
01:30:23,651 --> 01:30:25,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally forgot to check that out, and I need to.

1182
01:30:26,073 --> 01:30:27,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1183
01:30:27,674 --> 01:30:28,514
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course...

1184
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,001
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1185
01:30:55,875 --> 01:30:59,859
[SPEAKER_06]: and a wireless HDMI adapter built inside of it.

1186
01:30:59,939 --> 01:31:05,204
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also these, you know, basically the same layout as the Wii U game pad.

1187
01:31:05,625 --> 01:31:11,550
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's got these cartridges that plug in the top that map the signal for whatever you're playing.

1188
01:31:11,590 --> 01:31:16,094
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, if you have an Xbox 360 version, you know, you have that.

1189
01:31:16,175 --> 01:31:19,618
[SPEAKER_06]: You can play with the Xbox 360 or using your PC, I guess, with that.

1190
01:31:20,818 --> 01:31:49,433
[SPEAKER_06]: and then they have a Playstation 3 one which you can sync up with the Playstation 3 or with an Ouya so they've got those and they're seeking $350,000 to begin production if you want to back one of these it would cost you $300 or $350 to actually get one of the crossplay devices which should be available I think sometime next year which for me is way too damn long for me to wait to buy something like that so I kind of wanted to make one of my own but

1191
01:31:49,873 --> 01:31:55,320
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard to find a cheap and good wireless HDMI extender.

1192
01:31:55,841 --> 01:31:58,404
[SPEAKER_06]: They do exist, but it's hard to find them.

1193
01:31:58,704 --> 01:32:07,235
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to peek in their video to see what they were using because I can see it, but they moved the camera too fast so I couldn't read what it was.

1194
01:32:08,902 --> 01:32:10,843
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks cool though, so that's on Kickstarter.

1195
01:32:12,904 --> 01:32:22,990
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, if you happen to like free games, there's a free remake of Ultima 4, the Commodore 64 version, that's on iOS.

1196
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:28,013
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can actually, it has a little keyboard on it and everything, and you can play the full game.

1197
01:32:28,153 --> 01:32:29,294
[SPEAKER_06]: It's near 100% replica of the game.

1198
01:32:29,314 --> 01:32:29,374
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

1199
01:32:35,297 --> 01:32:35,717
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks neat.

1200
01:32:58,277 --> 01:33:02,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I've seen C64 emulators on iPhone already.

1201
01:33:03,099 --> 01:33:04,239
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it still exists.

1202
01:33:04,419 --> 01:33:08,981
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so, because I think it uses a lot of free-to-play games and things that they have the rights to.

1203
01:33:09,061 --> 01:33:13,443
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, who am I to say no to a Commodore 64 experience in my pocket?

1204
01:33:13,923 --> 01:33:14,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1205
01:33:15,044 --> 01:33:21,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of in your pocket, there's a rumor going around that Infamous will be coming to the Vita, which shouldn't be a big surprise.

1206
01:33:21,550 --> 01:33:22,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Infamous is huge for Sony.

1207
01:33:23,231 --> 01:33:34,380
[SPEAKER_08]: We know that Second Son is going on right now, but this is because of a recent Q&A that happened where there was a Dual Shockers interview with the folks behind Infamous Second Son.

1208
01:33:34,421 --> 01:33:37,863
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the director, Nate Fox, specifically, that I guess...

1209
01:33:39,064 --> 01:33:46,327
[SPEAKER_08]: I got asked some question, but kind of gave a misinterpreted answer, but he said, quote, Right now we're only talking about the PS4 game.

1210
01:33:46,668 --> 01:33:50,789
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to talk to you about any Vita-related titles when or if the time comes.

1211
01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:56,712
[SPEAKER_08]: That still seems a little bit noncommittal to me, but the reality is Infamous is a huge franchise for Sony.

1212
01:33:56,752 --> 01:33:58,893
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of thinking, of course, there's going to be something for the Vita.

1213
01:33:59,053 --> 01:34:01,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, even if it's not necessarily the same studio.

1214
01:34:02,035 --> 01:34:03,655
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's what they did with Uncharted, right?

1215
01:34:04,076 --> 01:34:08,578
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that they'll have an infamous game, and I can see it coming out around the same time as Second Son, too.

1216
01:34:10,759 --> 01:34:12,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because it would be a good tie-in.

1217
01:34:12,620 --> 01:34:17,663
[SPEAKER_06]: You could, like, have, like, you take your PlayStation 4 character to, you know, that game or vice versa.

1218
01:34:17,683 --> 01:34:20,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I would also think they would try to do, like, the remote play or something.

1219
01:34:20,505 --> 01:34:22,326
[SPEAKER_08]: They would try to tie that feature in as well.

1220
01:34:23,146 --> 01:34:27,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you hear that Final Fantasy XIV is supposed to be getting something like that on PlayStation 4?

1221
01:34:27,607 --> 01:34:30,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to do too tangenty, but this sounded really awesome.

1222
01:34:30,568 --> 01:34:33,749
[SPEAKER_08]: They're talking about doing a remote play for the PlayStation 4 version.

1223
01:34:33,809 --> 01:34:36,530
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be limited, but it would allow you to do things like crafting and stuff.

1224
01:34:37,050 --> 01:34:37,550
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty cool.

1225
01:34:37,870 --> 01:34:39,631
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see why you couldn't play the game.

1226
01:34:39,831 --> 01:34:42,311
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, aside from being able to text chat and stuff.

1227
01:34:42,391 --> 01:34:45,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the text chat and some of the other stuff is a resource hog.

1228
01:34:46,292 --> 01:34:46,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't text chat.

1229
01:34:47,033 --> 01:34:47,853
[SPEAKER_06]: I never text chatted.

1230
01:34:48,922 --> 01:34:51,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I liked having the ability to chat from my phone on WoW.

1231
01:34:52,563 --> 01:34:52,783
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

1232
01:34:52,803 --> 01:34:53,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing stuff like that.

1233
01:34:53,523 --> 01:34:54,163
[SPEAKER_02]: You still can, yeah.

1234
01:34:54,343 --> 01:34:55,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.

1235
01:34:55,203 --> 01:34:57,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, even though I don't have a subscription anymore.

1236
01:34:58,364 --> 01:35:06,885
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, I think that having more remote options for doing other stuff in the game, especially for things that you're trying to kill time with, I think that's actually pretty good.

1237
01:35:08,445 --> 01:35:16,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting rumors coming out of Microsoft with the whole, you know, their DRM features that originally rolled out and then they were just kidding.

1238
01:35:16,367 --> 01:35:18,107
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are really mad, so we're not going to do that.

1239
01:35:18,587 --> 01:35:30,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, according to Xbox director Albert Pinello, this ability to trade and loan digital games, which is going to be a part of this whole DRM restriction, it could return at some point.

1240
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:32,902
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not talking about the 24-hour check-ins and all this.

1241
01:35:33,062 --> 01:35:34,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the quote in an interview from GameSpot.

1242
01:35:35,184 --> 01:35:35,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Quote,

1243
01:35:41,130 --> 01:35:45,392
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe in retrospect that people have calmed down and gone back and actually looked at what we said.

1244
01:35:45,752 --> 01:35:51,894
[SPEAKER_08]: People are starting to understand, wow, they did want to actually allow me to loan and trade, which other digital ecosystems don't want to do.

1245
01:35:52,234 --> 01:35:54,195
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, yeah, I think we need to do that.

1246
01:35:55,095 --> 01:35:58,116
[SPEAKER_08]: I get a lot of mail saying, God, please bring back the family sharing.

1247
01:35:58,396 --> 01:35:59,917
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd love to figure out how to bring that back.

1248
01:36:00,117 --> 01:36:01,457
[SPEAKER_08]: I still think it was a good idea.

1249
01:36:01,858 --> 01:36:08,420
[SPEAKER_08]: So kind of clinging to that idea that maybe something could come back, but I'm assuming that would not include the 24-hour check-ins, although...

1250
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:23,247
[SPEAKER_08]: as I was saying plenty of times before when this whole mess happened in the first place why not just have a separate digital license does this stuff and the disc license does this stuff done because that would make sense so silly

1251
01:36:25,148 --> 01:36:27,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter Molyneux has his new game coming called Godus.

1252
01:36:28,190 --> 01:36:30,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to be confused with the show at the Stardust in a famous movie.

1253
01:36:30,791 --> 01:36:32,331
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's G-O-D-U-S.

1254
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:34,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Godus is the game.

1255
01:36:34,112 --> 01:36:34,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's Godus.

1256
01:36:35,113 --> 01:36:35,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Godus.

1257
01:36:35,773 --> 01:36:36,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I like that.

1258
01:36:36,313 --> 01:36:36,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Godus.

1259
01:36:37,914 --> 01:36:44,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Godus, he was talking about the royalties because the guy who opened the box, the curiosity box, gets some royalties from the game.

1260
01:36:44,757 --> 01:36:45,798
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not going to be much.

1261
01:36:45,978 --> 01:36:46,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Between 1% and 5%.

1262
01:36:47,378 --> 01:36:48,799
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't say exactly what it is.

1263
01:36:49,840 --> 01:37:06,176
[SPEAKER_08]: GADUS will have offline play available and in his ever so eloquent style Peter Molyneux speaking with RPS Rock Paper Shotgun mentioned that if he did come out and say that the game would always be online quote this red dot would appear on my forehead and I'd be sniped to death

1264
01:37:07,932 --> 01:37:17,039
[SPEAKER_08]: He does say, though, that playing online will allow for these other charming moments, such as syncing with a villager's social feed.

1265
01:37:17,599 --> 01:37:19,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that what happens in Tiny Tower?

1266
01:37:19,461 --> 01:37:20,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of sounds like that.

1267
01:37:20,702 --> 01:37:21,302
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, quote,

1268
01:37:32,148 --> 01:37:42,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Gadus will be out on Steam September 13th and there will be an iPad version at the end of October and Android version soon after that and you can smoke some of the crack that Peter Molyneux is smoking himself.

1269
01:37:43,255 --> 01:37:47,637
[SPEAKER_08]: No, in all reality, I do kind of want to check it out because I did like Black and White.

1270
01:37:47,797 --> 01:37:53,361
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked Populous from back in the day, so I feel like I should check it out.

1271
01:37:53,441 --> 01:37:55,082
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as that kind of game would be up your alley.

1272
01:37:55,430 --> 01:37:56,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it is.

1273
01:37:56,471 --> 01:37:59,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially when I like Civ so much and the original SimCity.

1274
01:37:59,195 --> 01:38:01,978
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I do feel like I need to check it out.

1275
01:38:02,479 --> 01:38:02,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Gadus!

1276
01:38:03,380 --> 01:38:03,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Gadus.

1277
01:38:04,841 --> 01:38:05,222
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.

1278
01:38:06,327 --> 01:38:09,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have some Assassin's Creed news.

1279
01:38:09,969 --> 01:38:18,593
[SPEAKER_02]: They basically have, for the Vita, Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation is supposed to be re-released on other systems.

1280
01:38:18,633 --> 01:38:25,057
[SPEAKER_02]: They're looking like PC, PSN, and Xbox Live launches, probably likely.

1281
01:38:25,877 --> 01:38:28,418
[SPEAKER_02]: And also on the list was Assassin's Creed Pirates.

1282
01:38:29,459 --> 01:38:29,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.

1283
01:38:30,359 --> 01:38:35,502
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Ubisoft was also going to have another tie-in for Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag.

1284
01:38:36,963 --> 01:38:39,884
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's for Assassin's Creed fans.

1285
01:38:39,944 --> 01:38:40,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Good news.

1286
01:38:40,885 --> 01:38:44,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, EA has six to eight new IPs going on.

1287
01:38:45,587 --> 01:38:49,109
[SPEAKER_02]: They are going to definitely do more sequels for The Sims.

1288
01:38:49,169 --> 01:38:51,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I was watching some of the stuff on Sims 4 stuff.

1289
01:38:51,710 --> 01:39:19,829
[SPEAKER_02]: as long as they fix that memory issue I might be down for that because I like some Sims Need for Speed, Battlefield, FIFA Titanfall was the only new name but they were also indicating that there's new Star Wars and Mirror's Edge 2 they are basically working on trying to take the IPs that people like and give them new life still nothing on another Mass Effect

1290
01:39:20,174 --> 01:39:24,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, but the team behind the original Mass Effect is doing one of those new IPs, don't forget.

1291
01:39:24,576 --> 01:39:24,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1292
01:39:25,096 --> 01:39:25,937
[SPEAKER_02]: That means it won't suck.

1293
01:39:27,277 --> 01:39:27,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

1294
01:39:28,238 --> 01:39:28,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Depends on the writing.

1295
01:39:29,958 --> 01:39:41,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, and also for fans of Monster Hunter 4, in the direct that came out, there are going to be outfits available in the game for Mario, Link, and Luigi.

1296
01:39:42,264 --> 01:39:47,246
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you like running around looking like other Nintendo characters, you can do it in the new Monster Hunter.

1297
01:39:49,993 --> 01:40:02,378
[SPEAKER_02]: and they actually said that it appeared that in the video that they showed that the Mario and Luigi outfits were for the Mario and Luigi Dream Team outfits.

1298
01:40:02,959 --> 01:40:10,682
[SPEAKER_02]: They have hammers and that the Link outfit has the Master Sword and the bow from Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess.

1299
01:40:12,344 --> 01:40:20,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you can download the Mario and Luigi costumes at 7-Elevens in Japan, but 7-Elevens in America are not cool enough to do it.

1300
01:40:22,210 --> 01:40:22,470
[SPEAKER_02]: The end.

1301
01:40:24,071 --> 01:40:26,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, are we even getting Monster Hunter 4 here?

1302
01:40:26,252 --> 01:40:26,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think so.

1303
01:40:26,953 --> 01:40:27,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Not yet.

1304
01:40:27,753 --> 01:40:28,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Not yet?

1305
01:40:28,594 --> 01:40:29,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Be a little while?

1306
01:40:29,454 --> 01:40:30,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably next year.

1307
01:40:30,535 --> 01:40:32,016
[SPEAKER_08]: How did the Wii U Monster Hunter sell?

1308
01:40:32,036 --> 01:40:32,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't it do alright?

1309
01:40:32,676 --> 01:40:33,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Not good, I don't think.

1310
01:40:35,418 --> 01:40:36,058
[SPEAKER_06]: That's too bad.

1311
01:40:37,239 --> 01:40:40,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think any Wii U titles sold well already, I mean.

1312
01:40:42,676 --> 01:40:45,037
[SPEAKER_06]: But, yeah, probably not good.

1313
01:40:45,657 --> 01:40:47,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we're going to get to the Fugo question of the week.

1314
01:40:47,478 --> 01:40:51,459
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to address real quickly, though, because some people in chat were asking if I'm okay.

1315
01:40:51,479 --> 01:40:54,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm recovering from Con Crud, the sequel.

1316
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:01,102
[SPEAKER_08]: When I got back from Dragon Con, I felt fine for a couple days, but probably around Thursday it really started to hit me.

1317
01:41:02,062 --> 01:41:05,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Unlike the Con Crud I got at GamerX, this one didn't come with a fever.

1318
01:41:05,503 --> 01:41:09,304
[SPEAKER_08]: So I haven't had high temperatures, but definitely the coughing, the snifflies, and

1319
01:41:10,124 --> 01:41:21,851
[SPEAKER_08]: all that crap so if I'm sounding a little under out of it tonight that is why so I apologize that kind of stuff is really not a radio guy's best friend but what can you do let's go to the fugal question of the week

1320
01:41:29,758 --> 01:41:33,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Take Facebook, take Google+, smoosh them together, you get FOOGLE!

1321
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:37,001
[SPEAKER_08]: And tonight's FOOGLE question of the week is about the Mighty No.

1322
01:41:37,201 --> 01:41:37,802
[SPEAKER_08]: 9 Kickstarter.

1323
01:41:38,142 --> 01:41:38,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't call it Mega Man.

1324
01:41:39,302 --> 01:41:42,164
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked about it earlier in the show, and here's the question we asked.

1325
01:41:42,224 --> 01:41:47,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Quite plainly, tell us if you backed the Kickstarter, or plan to, or not, and why.

1326
01:41:48,266 --> 01:41:51,648
[SPEAKER_08]: We just kind of wanted to know where you guys' heads were at with this.

1327
01:41:52,328 --> 01:41:57,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Red Entertainment responded on Google+, and said, "...no, due to my pursuit of Project Buy a House."

1328
01:41:58,351 --> 01:42:01,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft said, I'm definitely backing this Kickstarter when I get the money.

1329
01:42:02,132 --> 01:42:04,912
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to do $175 for the plushie tier.

1330
01:42:05,693 --> 01:42:09,553
[SPEAKER_08]: And well, Inafune wants to give what Mega Man fans want, and I support that.

1331
01:42:09,873 --> 01:42:12,994
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's an all-star team behind it, so I do have high hopes for it.

1332
01:42:13,594 --> 01:42:15,915
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a yes and a no from Google+.

1333
01:42:16,535 --> 01:42:18,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go over to Fugle.

1334
01:42:19,476 --> 01:42:20,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me, Facebook.

1335
01:42:20,856 --> 01:42:21,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Part of Fugle.

1336
01:42:22,796 --> 01:42:24,257
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize for the Facebook noises.

1337
01:42:24,297 --> 01:42:25,477
[SPEAKER_08]: I really thought I turned those off.

1338
01:42:27,218 --> 01:42:28,579
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.com.

1339
01:42:46,933 --> 01:42:52,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Elliot B says, considering the talent involved, I reckon this particular Kickstarter is more likely to bear fruit than most.

1340
01:42:53,161 --> 01:42:58,048
[SPEAKER_08]: That said, I never really got quite the appeal of Mega Man, so I guess I'll pass.

1341
01:42:58,608 --> 01:42:59,630
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of surprising.

1342
01:43:00,834 --> 01:43:02,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, I shouldn't say it that way.

1343
01:43:02,435 --> 01:43:05,757
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, some people just don't like certain games that may be popular otherwise.

1344
01:43:05,837 --> 01:43:10,179
[SPEAKER_08]: But I find that interesting that he's like, yeah, it's a bunch of talented people, but not my type of game.

1345
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:15,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Mason D said, HD 2D art, the track record of the people involved.

1346
01:43:15,482 --> 01:43:16,363
[SPEAKER_08]: It seemed like a no brainer.

1347
01:43:17,304 --> 01:43:20,905
[SPEAKER_08]: BumbleD said, I'm going to pre-order the digital copy of the game this weekend.

1348
01:43:21,186 --> 01:43:25,187
[SPEAKER_08]: It reminded me how much time I killed playing Mega Man 1 through 6 back in the NES days.

1349
01:43:25,567 --> 01:43:29,469
[SPEAKER_08]: I recently bought the Mega Man X collection just to resharpen my skills for when this comes out.

1350
01:43:30,649 --> 01:43:35,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Burr replied on Facebook and said, I didn't back this Kickstarter because I knew it would succeed anyway.

1351
01:43:36,031 --> 01:43:38,892
[SPEAKER_08]: I try to back things that need the push over the finish line.

1352
01:43:39,252 --> 01:43:42,874
[SPEAKER_08]: In this case, I can sit back and wait to see the reviews before taking the plunge.

1353
01:43:43,394 --> 01:43:44,134
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1354
01:44:00,436 --> 01:44:00,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

1355
01:44:02,417 --> 01:44:06,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Critical Myth says, No, but I prefer to get opinions on the final product first.

1356
01:44:06,999 --> 01:44:11,542
[SPEAKER_08]: There have been plenty of great ideas that wound up having poor execution or unforeseen roadblocks.

1357
01:44:12,182 --> 01:44:14,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Ragenator says, Nope, just because.

1358
01:44:15,684 --> 01:44:18,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Daniel S replied and said, I haven't heard of this until just now.

1359
01:44:19,205 --> 01:44:21,226
[SPEAKER_08]: And then said, Dude, this looks amazeballs.

1360
01:44:21,587 --> 01:44:23,968
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit Mega Man and a little bit Metabots?

1361
01:44:24,268 --> 01:44:24,648
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in.

1362
01:44:24,888 --> 01:44:28,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, screw Capcom for not letting Inafune make Mega Man games.

1363
01:44:29,585 --> 01:44:32,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's something to think about, though, just to kind of go off of that point a little bit.

1364
01:44:34,247 --> 01:44:41,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Since you're really excited about how it looks, something to consider is, if he had been able to make a new Mega Man game, would we have got this?

1365
01:44:42,429 --> 01:44:43,970
[SPEAKER_08]: And could this be better?

1366
01:44:44,994 --> 01:44:45,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Just something to think about.

1367
01:44:46,516 --> 01:44:54,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Monty Boggs replied on Facebook and said, Yes, he backed it because I wanted to see the Mega Man games evolve and I want them to achieve the stretch goal and put it on consoles.

1368
01:44:55,204 --> 01:44:59,368
[SPEAKER_08]: This should also show Capcom that people want these games and they've been dropping the ball.

1369
01:44:59,488 --> 01:45:01,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, this Kickstarter wouldn't exist or succeed.

1370
01:45:02,572 --> 01:45:07,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Ryan B replied and said, No, he didn't back it, though I do want to because I'm poor.

1371
01:45:08,605 --> 01:45:13,393
[SPEAKER_08]: HitStun replied and said, this could be the project that finally gets me to create a Kickstarter account.

1372
01:45:13,793 --> 01:45:16,818
[SPEAKER_08]: I want the game to be good, but I'm on the fence about throwing money at it.

1373
01:45:17,158 --> 01:45:20,463
[SPEAKER_08]: I typically don't buy a game until I see the finished product in motion.

1374
01:45:20,864 --> 01:45:23,608
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's the answers from Facebook and Google+.

1375
01:45:24,569 --> 01:45:50,327
[SPEAKER_08]: and I think you pretty much heard what we had to say about it earlier but it was I thought we would see a lot more of yes I was throwing my money at it I was rubbing my credit card at the screen but I found that there's a lot more of you out there that are like kind of like yeah we'll wait and see when the finished game's out I'll wait for the reviews I'll check it out then they don't need my money right now I'll give it to them later so I was kind of surprised by that but in a good way so there you go our fugal question of the week

1376
01:45:51,212 --> 01:45:53,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on with some more gaming news.

1377
01:46:06,483 --> 01:46:07,344
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1378
01:46:25,554 --> 01:46:30,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Who has an HD projector attached to the ceiling and an extra Kinect sensor attached to that.

1379
01:46:31,077 --> 01:46:33,098
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just not going to work.

1380
01:46:33,918 --> 01:46:42,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, they said, it's very, very cool tech, but for a consumer, it requires a projector and things.

1381
01:46:43,282 --> 01:46:47,544
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really super neat if you're in the lab and you've got Microsoft money and you can set this up.

1382
01:46:48,104 --> 01:47:05,295
[SPEAKER_06]: but we looked at it for an average consumer it's like thousands of dollars so unfortunately it's not going to go beyond proof of concept I say right now but I think later on maybe when that technology comes down in price a lot maybe like in three four years we might see something like that

1383
01:47:05,475 --> 01:47:06,355
[SPEAKER_08]: XBOX 37 You'll buy them all in a row

1384
01:47:35,122 --> 01:47:53,758
[SPEAKER_08]: They stack up in a row to create a giant Voltron Alright, well for those of you that are upgrading to a new Xbox Maybe you'll be happy about these programs And we touched on this a little bit in the last show But now some more details coming out about Who is going to allow you to upgrade to your Xbox One games cheaply

1385
01:47:54,198 --> 01:47:59,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Best Buy is going to be rolling out a program that will offer $10 next-gen upgrades.

1386
01:48:00,065 --> 01:48:02,507
[SPEAKER_08]: GameStop and Amazon already had these programs in place.

1387
01:48:03,268 --> 01:48:10,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Eligible games include FIFA 14, Assassin's Creed 4, Black Flag, Call of Duty, Ghosts, Battlefield 4, and Watch Dogs.

1388
01:48:11,117 --> 01:48:12,038
[SPEAKER_08]: This is interesting, though.

1389
01:48:13,248 --> 01:48:21,738
[SPEAKER_08]: What you have to do, if you purchase one of the games within a set period after its release, you'll be given a $10 coupon to put towards the Xbox One incarnation.

1390
01:48:22,299 --> 01:48:30,789
[SPEAKER_08]: When you want to upgrade, you do the coupon and the game, and then Best Buy gives you $40 credit, reducing the final cost of the Xbox One game to $10.

1391
01:48:32,050 --> 01:48:33,312
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's this whole...

1392
01:48:34,133 --> 01:48:34,913
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems weird.

1393
01:48:34,954 --> 01:48:36,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I suppose you could do it that way.

1394
01:48:36,195 --> 01:48:36,455
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1395
01:48:36,475 --> 01:48:37,356
[SPEAKER_08]: That just seems confusing.

1396
01:48:51,161 --> 01:48:53,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, but then it says towards the game's Xbox One incarnation.

1397
01:48:53,963 --> 01:48:54,303
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1398
01:48:54,363 --> 01:48:54,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

1399
01:48:54,684 --> 01:48:59,027
[SPEAKER_06]: What if I'm upgrading from, say, like... How many people is this really going to affect?

1400
01:48:59,247 --> 01:49:04,551
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if it's only for a certain period of time, either you're buying the one this year or you're not.

1401
01:49:04,871 --> 01:49:14,999
[SPEAKER_06]: What if I wanted to upgrade from, say, like, you know, I don't know, Disney Planes to, like, say, Rise.

1402
01:49:15,219 --> 01:49:17,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that an upgrade that I can do?

1403
01:49:17,581 --> 01:49:18,761
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think you can do that, Loki.

1404
01:49:18,781 --> 01:49:19,342
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry to say.

1405
01:49:19,702 --> 01:49:25,186
[SPEAKER_06]: What about like, you know, I don't know, Ben 10 Galactic Racing to Forza 5?

1406
01:49:25,266 --> 01:49:26,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's technically an upgrade.

1407
01:49:26,987 --> 01:49:27,908
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still driving.

1408
01:49:28,148 --> 01:49:32,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, look, I just wanted to add that the Microsoft store is doing this deal as well.

1409
01:49:32,191 --> 01:49:35,993
[SPEAKER_08]: They will also be doing Xbox One games for $10 when you trade in 360 copies.

1410
01:49:37,594 --> 01:50:03,635
[SPEAKER_08]: The titles include NFL Madden 25, Battlefield 4, Need for Speed Rivals, Call of Duty Ghosts, NBA 2K14, FIFA 14, and Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag All you have to do for this one, you bring the game to a Microsoft store and you get the Xbox One copy for $10 Just throwing it out there, Watch Dogs, not apparently on the list for the Microsoft store So if you're going to be participating in these programs for whatever reason, you better look at what games what stores are taking

1411
01:50:04,475 --> 01:50:07,118
[SPEAKER_08]: But now you have, what, three, four options?

1412
01:50:07,479 --> 01:50:09,661
[SPEAKER_08]: GameStop, Best Buy, Amazon, Microsoft Store.

1413
01:50:09,781 --> 01:50:11,023
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one word for the whole thing.

1414
01:50:11,163 --> 01:50:11,383
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1415
01:50:11,724 --> 01:50:13,125
Blah.

1416
01:50:13,546 --> 01:50:17,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, my whole thing is like either you're getting the one this year or you're not.

1417
01:50:17,070 --> 01:50:20,714
[SPEAKER_08]: If this program continues into next year, all right, well, then I get it.

1418
01:50:20,874 --> 01:50:27,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but if it's such a small window, just maybe, I don't know, here's a thought, wait a little bit.

1419
01:50:27,443 --> 01:50:34,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, for example, if Grand Theft Auto V, okay, no, that's a bad example, because I wouldn't be able to wait for Grand Theft Auto V.

1420
01:50:35,020 --> 01:50:35,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1421
01:50:55,308 --> 01:50:59,671
[SPEAKER_06]: It's even worse when they're talking about Assassin's Creed that's literally coming out a month before.

1422
01:51:00,431 --> 01:51:08,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wait and just pay the same amount of money that you would have bought the current gen version for.

1423
01:51:09,396 --> 01:51:12,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's move on with some new game news.

1424
01:51:12,257 --> 01:51:12,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, DarkSakura?

1425
01:51:13,778 --> 01:51:15,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we do have some new game news.

1426
01:51:15,499 --> 01:51:21,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, DungeonBuster just said actually in chat that Shamestop dropped the price for Xenoblade down to $65.00.

1427
01:51:23,419 --> 01:51:24,621
[SPEAKER_06]: What a deal!

1428
01:51:24,641 --> 01:51:33,452
[SPEAKER_08]: $65, that's still... You're telling me nobody was buying it for $90 because they were just all downloading it from the internet?

1429
01:51:33,592 --> 01:51:33,833
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

1430
01:51:36,450 --> 01:51:40,953
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a new Battle Arena game online and it's King of Fighters.

1431
01:51:42,434 --> 01:51:42,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Very weird.

1432
01:51:43,755 --> 01:51:48,658
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually in a closed beta in Thailand and I hate Destructoid.

1433
01:51:49,098 --> 01:51:49,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1434
01:51:50,139 --> 01:51:50,719
[SPEAKER_02]: On my tablet.

1435
01:51:50,759 --> 01:51:51,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate it on my tablet.

1436
01:51:51,820 --> 01:51:52,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the site.

1437
01:51:52,541 --> 01:51:53,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate it on my tablet.

1438
01:51:53,521 --> 01:51:55,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Fix your tablet version.

1439
01:51:55,723 --> 01:51:56,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

1440
01:51:57,024 --> 01:51:58,785
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's a MOBA.

1441
01:51:59,454 --> 01:52:01,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Kyo Iori, Joe Griffin, and Terry Dragonfly

1442
01:52:19,645 --> 01:52:26,369
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of cute in a way because, you know, you look at a game like League of Legends, it's all about the heroes, and you have to select one of the heroes, right?

1443
01:52:26,429 --> 01:52:27,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the stupid Marvel game.

1444
01:52:27,690 --> 01:52:30,011
[SPEAKER_08]: A fighting game lends itself very well to that.

1445
01:52:30,271 --> 01:52:30,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1446
01:52:30,451 --> 01:52:34,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the Marvel game's more like a Diablo dungeon crawler than it is a MOBA.

1447
01:52:35,314 --> 01:53:02,789
[SPEAKER_08]: it's not all that fun MOBA is a very kind of growing genre of games though you know you have League of Legends then you have Dota is the other big one and now you've seen some more pop up like the Heroes of New Earth is one and you know there's more and more so because League of Legends does very well lots and lots of people play in that game or have played it at some point as long as they've changed their passwords now remember they were going after old data so the password could be used other places that is very true be careful

1448
01:53:04,350 --> 01:53:21,644
[SPEAKER_08]: So wow, I wish I could try this out at least, but just have to wait for it to float its way over here from Thailand Oh well Through the inner tubes, through unofficial translation patches The same way the rest of us played Ragnarok back in the day Who would be your hero in a King of Fighters MOBA?

1449
01:53:22,065 --> 01:53:25,628
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be Leona That's who I play every time I play the damn game

1450
01:53:26,229 --> 01:53:30,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine would have to be Kim Capuan, because that's who I loved in the game.

1451
01:53:30,612 --> 01:53:31,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, of course, Mai.

1452
01:53:31,632 --> 01:53:32,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what is your dream team?

1453
01:53:32,573 --> 01:53:33,353
[SPEAKER_08]: That was always my team.

1454
01:53:34,114 --> 01:53:34,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Of three?

1455
01:53:34,734 --> 01:53:35,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1456
01:53:35,855 --> 01:53:36,375
[SPEAKER_02]: And a striker.

1457
01:53:36,975 --> 01:53:42,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Kim Capuan, Mai, and Joe Higashi.

1458
01:53:42,238 --> 01:53:42,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Who would be your striker?

1459
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:45,780
[SPEAKER_08]: I forget.

1460
01:53:45,820 --> 01:53:46,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Who are the strikers?

1461
01:53:47,401 --> 01:53:49,062
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pick any character as a striker.

1462
01:53:50,283 --> 01:53:51,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're a call-in person.

1463
01:53:53,265 --> 01:53:53,825
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking...

1464
01:53:59,375 --> 01:53:59,756
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1465
01:54:00,657 --> 01:54:02,719
[SPEAKER_08]: I always think about... Answer hazy.

1466
01:54:02,739 --> 01:54:03,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Try again later.

1467
01:54:03,720 --> 01:54:05,822
[SPEAKER_08]: I always go back to CVS and think about that.

1468
01:54:09,105 --> 01:54:09,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Shit, I don't know.

1469
01:54:09,806 --> 01:54:10,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Andy Bogard.

1470
01:54:11,247 --> 01:54:11,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked Andy.

1471
01:54:12,068 --> 01:54:17,253
[SPEAKER_02]: My team was always Leona, Mai, and Athena.

1472
01:54:18,014 --> 01:54:19,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, a girl power team.

1473
01:54:19,804 --> 01:54:22,165
[SPEAKER_02]: or Yuri with one of them, the other ones being a striker.

1474
01:54:22,706 --> 01:54:25,968
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would go between, because Yuri had the flying butt attack.

1475
01:54:26,368 --> 01:54:27,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Was King in King of Fighters?

1476
01:54:27,829 --> 01:54:29,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, King was in King of Fighters.

1477
01:54:29,130 --> 01:54:29,870
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be my striker.

1478
01:54:29,890 --> 01:54:30,430
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked King.

1479
01:54:30,671 --> 01:54:31,351
[SPEAKER_02]: King was awesome.

1480
01:54:31,511 --> 01:54:31,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1481
01:54:34,553 --> 01:54:34,853
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1482
01:54:34,873 --> 01:54:35,493
[SPEAKER_02]: What about you, Loki?

1483
01:54:36,054 --> 01:54:36,654
[SPEAKER_08]: I never played the game.

1484
01:54:37,154 --> 01:54:37,315
[SPEAKER_02]: See?

1485
01:54:37,475 --> 01:54:37,655
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1486
01:54:38,275 --> 01:54:40,597
[SPEAKER_08]: It was free on PlayStation Plus, one of the newer ones.

1487
01:54:41,217 --> 01:54:42,398
[SPEAKER_08]: So I checked it out a while back.

1488
01:54:42,838 --> 01:54:43,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

1489
01:54:45,459 --> 01:54:46,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what do you got for us?

1490
01:54:46,846 --> 01:54:51,629
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so I've got some Kickstarter information.

1491
01:54:52,190 --> 01:54:55,992
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a combination of Kickstarter and Ouya.

1492
01:54:56,953 --> 01:55:02,957
[SPEAKER_06]: So Ouya's got this, I don't know what you'd call it, campaign that they're doing right now called the Free the Games campaign.

1493
01:55:03,397 --> 01:55:14,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, they're offering a million dollars, or they have this million dollar fund that they are matching Kickstarter, or Kickstarted games for the Ouya.

1494
01:55:15,763 --> 01:55:17,144
[SPEAKER_06]: They're matching them up to, I think, $50,000.

1495
01:55:17,264 --> 01:55:20,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Might be more than that.

1496
01:55:21,526 --> 01:55:22,747
[SPEAKER_06]: But basically, the...

1497
01:55:23,647 --> 01:55:27,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Stipulations are that the game has to be exclusively for the Ouya.

1498
01:55:27,650 --> 01:55:29,511
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to have a minimum goal of $50,000.

1499
01:55:29,631 --> 01:55:34,274
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that... I want to say that $50,000 might have been the...

1500
01:55:40,487 --> 01:55:41,748
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it actually goes up from there.

1501
01:55:41,768 --> 01:55:45,289
[SPEAKER_06]: I think $50,000 is not the cap on that.

1502
01:55:45,329 --> 01:55:47,009
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, so they're going to match funding.

1503
01:55:47,570 --> 01:55:51,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, two games so far have reached their funding targets.

1504
01:55:51,791 --> 01:55:56,953
[SPEAKER_06]: This game called Gridiron Thunder and Elementary My Dear Homes.

1505
01:55:57,713 --> 01:55:59,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's a little bit of a problem with that.

1506
01:56:00,734 --> 01:56:03,035
[SPEAKER_06]: The two games, as a lot of people were kind of looking at...

1507
01:56:03,735 --> 01:56:04,115
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

1508
01:56:26,773 --> 01:56:27,394
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1509
01:56:44,455 --> 01:56:49,779
[SPEAKER_06]: They earned $40,000 or something on it, and that was a little fishy.

1510
01:56:50,139 --> 01:57:00,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, the thought is, okay, so there's a guy who creates a Kickstarter, has people back it or whatever, OUYA matches that, and then they take the money and run.

1511
01:57:01,506 --> 01:57:03,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's even gone further.

1512
01:57:03,468 --> 01:57:13,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Elementary, my dear homes, had a bunch of fake, or I should say, made-up people that were one-time backers that were backing this project,

1513
01:57:14,796 --> 01:57:23,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Made up characters, celebrities, a person that's been kidnapped, and just all sorts of weird stuff.

1514
01:57:23,608 --> 01:57:30,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that interference from people related to the game, or is that like a 4chan prank?

1515
01:57:31,158 --> 01:57:31,378
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it.

1516
01:57:49,983 --> 01:57:50,723
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1517
01:58:09,993 --> 01:58:15,118
[SPEAKER_06]: So, however, the Elementary My Dear Homes has been suspended.

1518
01:58:15,859 --> 01:58:25,869
[SPEAKER_06]: It hit its funding goal of $50,000 and it was currently at $58,770 and it's been suspended because of suspicious accounts.

1519
01:58:27,371 --> 01:58:27,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1520
01:58:29,150 --> 01:58:50,349
[SPEAKER_06]: so yeah so it sounds like you know they were trying to scam it and there's a lot of conspiracy theories about it they're saying well it's I'm not so sure about the elementary my dear homes one but the other one that we is actually kicking money in there because they want to make it look like these games are being successful and stuff and I don't know it's weird but

1521
01:58:51,621 --> 01:58:52,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, speaking of internet scams...

1522
01:59:16,078 --> 01:59:17,499
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1523
01:59:34,668 --> 01:59:35,749
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1524
01:59:54,788 --> 02:00:02,410
[SPEAKER_06]: The date that that game was supposed to be released came and gone and no real updates and they've kind of all disappeared.

1525
02:00:02,871 --> 02:00:05,431
[SPEAKER_06]: So once again, people called it a scam.

1526
02:00:05,451 --> 02:00:06,572
[SPEAKER_06]: They got called out.

1527
02:00:07,032 --> 02:00:08,412
[SPEAKER_06]: The creators called them trolls.

1528
02:00:08,972 --> 02:00:21,136
[SPEAKER_06]: All the internet people that ran it, Kotaku and some other ones, defended the Kickstarter people and said, oh yeah, all those people that are ganging up against that nine-year-old, they're just trolling them and stuff like that.

1529
02:00:21,556 --> 02:00:24,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, are they out here now to say that

1530
02:00:25,097 --> 02:00:27,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe they were right because they didn't come up with anything.

1531
02:00:29,139 --> 02:00:30,779
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because it failing isn't newsworthy.

1532
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:32,460
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it didn't fail.

1533
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:33,280
[SPEAKER_06]: They succeeded.

1534
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:36,981
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, sorry, it failing to produce isn't newsworthy.

1535
02:00:37,061 --> 02:00:41,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so basically she got $28,000 for doing nothing.

1536
02:00:44,804 --> 02:00:45,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1537
02:00:46,325 --> 02:00:50,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hope it pays for college and not for trips to Tahiti.

1538
02:00:51,827 --> 02:00:53,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I want someone to pay for my college.

1539
02:00:53,609 --> 02:00:54,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't that be nice?

1540
02:00:54,289 --> 02:00:54,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, really.

1541
02:00:54,890 --> 02:00:58,693
[SPEAKER_08]: I want someone to pay for me to get additional classes in my profession.

1542
02:00:58,713 --> 02:00:59,174
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be nice.

1543
02:00:59,754 --> 02:01:00,015
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1544
02:01:00,835 --> 02:01:02,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on with another story.

1545
02:01:02,156 --> 02:01:08,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, somebody's going to be getting a lot of money, and I wouldn't mind having $15 million in damages.

1546
02:01:08,842 --> 02:01:13,367
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is a lawsuit with Microsoft versus Motorola Mobility.

1547
02:01:13,687 --> 02:01:17,010
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a long-running lawsuit surrounding patent infringement.

1548
02:01:17,370 --> 02:01:19,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Jury ruled in favor of Microsoft.

1549
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:48,718
[SPEAKER_08]: because Motorola was not providing the patent licenses for fair and reasonable terms.

1550
02:01:49,078 --> 02:01:51,219
[SPEAKER_08]: This is why Microsoft got the damages.

1551
02:01:51,839 --> 02:01:55,140
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't imagine that this is going to be over by any stretch of the imagination.

1552
02:01:55,180 --> 02:01:56,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this shit going to go to the Supreme Court?

1553
02:01:56,920 --> 02:01:57,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what's going to happen?

1554
02:01:58,721 --> 02:02:00,283
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really surprised the two didn't settle.

1555
02:02:00,544 --> 02:02:01,885
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what always happens in this shit.

1556
02:02:01,905 --> 02:02:02,806
[SPEAKER_08]: There's always a settlement.

1557
02:02:02,846 --> 02:02:11,417
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I went to jury and the jury awarded it to Microsoft saying that nope, it's Motorola's fault because they weren't allowing Microsoft to have it reasonably.

1558
02:02:12,559 --> 02:02:14,061
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure this is not the last of it.

1559
02:02:14,995 --> 02:02:15,936
[SPEAKER_02]: No, probably not.

1560
02:02:15,956 --> 02:02:22,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, in some cases, trying to push things through to an actual jury trial is a way to set a precedent.

1561
02:02:23,121 --> 02:02:23,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1562
02:02:23,662 --> 02:02:23,862
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

1563
02:02:24,763 --> 02:02:25,023
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1564
02:02:25,463 --> 02:02:30,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we're going to allow you to set some precedents on our show right now with the emails that you send us.

1565
02:02:30,527 --> 02:02:36,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Every week you guys send us mailbags, or not, to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1566
02:02:36,452 --> 02:02:37,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Bags of mails?

1567
02:02:37,633 --> 02:02:38,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, no.

1568
02:02:38,493 --> 02:02:43,017
[SPEAKER_08]: So DarkSakura's going to jump in the mailbag and see the flood of email awaiting us tonight.

1569
02:02:43,277 --> 02:02:47,219
[SPEAKER_02]: More like the drippy one.

1570
02:02:47,319 --> 02:02:48,759
[SPEAKER_08]: In the two weeks we were off.

1571
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:51,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we got one email.

1572
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:56,462
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm saying drippy not because of the person, but because it's like drip, drip, drip.

1573
02:02:57,002 --> 02:03:00,744
[SPEAKER_08]: You opened the bag to dump it out and one little email came floating down.

1574
02:03:01,684 --> 02:03:03,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, everyone at OLR.

1575
02:03:03,124 --> 02:03:03,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

1576
02:03:06,226 --> 02:03:06,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

1577
02:03:06,846 --> 02:03:06,986
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1578
02:03:07,026 --> 02:03:08,807
[SPEAKER_08]: The listeners say hi, I gotta say hi back.

1579
02:03:08,827 --> 02:03:11,908
[SPEAKER_02]: So you paraphrase Final Fantasy 7 since you love it so much?

1580
02:03:12,890 --> 02:03:15,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Sit your ass down in that chair and eat your goddamn Ricola.

1581
02:03:17,557 --> 02:03:18,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Hearts, hearts.

1582
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:21,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually came with like a bucket of Ricolas.

1583
02:03:22,283 --> 02:03:23,365
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually very thankful.

1584
02:03:25,086 --> 02:03:26,707
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your favorite person in the whole world.

1585
02:03:27,728 --> 02:03:28,869
[SPEAKER_02]: He did a face.

1586
02:03:29,749 --> 02:03:30,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Ragenator.

1587
02:03:31,230 --> 02:03:38,856
[SPEAKER_02]: As you probably remember, Sony officially retired the PS2 earlier this year after a 12-year... Well, he said ear run, but I think he means ear.

1588
02:03:40,237 --> 02:03:50,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's safe to say that in terms of last-gen systems, the PS2 was a leading favorite and most people had it, either as a primary console or a secondary or even just as a DVD player that just so happened to play games.

1589
02:03:51,505 --> 02:03:55,706
[SPEAKER_02]: All that being said, I'd like to pose a question to the three of you and to the chat room as well.

1590
02:03:56,067 --> 02:04:00,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Those of you who had a PS2, do you have any fond memories revolving around the PS2?

1591
02:04:00,248 --> 02:04:01,308
[SPEAKER_02]: And if so, what were they?

1592
02:04:01,688 --> 02:04:04,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting my JPS2 and playing the hell out of Beatmania 2DX?

1593
02:04:04,309 --> 02:04:05,470
[SPEAKER_08]: You stole my damn answer.

1594
02:04:05,510 --> 02:04:11,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say getting the Japanese PlayStation 2, which I owned before a US PlayStation 2, and playing the shit out of Beatmania 2DX.

1595
02:04:12,972 --> 02:04:13,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Bam.

1596
02:04:13,472 --> 02:04:13,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Fist bump.

1597
02:04:14,112 --> 02:04:14,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

1598
02:04:15,193 --> 02:04:16,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, PlayStation 2 memories?

1599
02:04:18,414 --> 02:04:18,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh...

1600
02:04:20,579 --> 02:04:27,564
[SPEAKER_06]: My HD loader in the... Actually, I'd say... When was the first thing I got on PlayStation 2?

1601
02:04:28,185 --> 02:04:29,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I got Armored Core.

1602
02:04:29,305 --> 02:04:30,866
[SPEAKER_06]: It was one of my first games on there.

1603
02:04:30,906 --> 02:04:37,131
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say probably like... Grand Theft Auto... Well, that was PlayStation 1.

1604
02:04:37,991 --> 02:04:39,132
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that was PlayStation 2.

1605
02:04:39,372 --> 02:04:40,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Grand Theft Auto 3?

1606
02:04:40,373 --> 02:04:42,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Vice City and all that was PlayStation 2.

1607
02:04:43,015 --> 02:04:43,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1608
02:04:43,255 --> 02:04:44,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1609
02:04:46,366 --> 02:04:46,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't die.

1610
02:04:47,127 --> 02:04:51,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, playing music games online with DDR and Amplitude was good times.

1611
02:04:51,730 --> 02:04:52,671
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I did like?

1612
02:04:53,331 --> 02:04:59,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Not having to do the button trick every time I wanted to put in that pen CD for Beatmania.

1613
02:05:00,597 --> 02:05:03,860
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was actually a way to play my old 5-key Beatmania stuff.

1614
02:05:06,261 --> 02:05:11,124
[SPEAKER_02]: I also just had, well, you know how many import PlayStation 1 games I had.

1615
02:05:11,545 --> 02:05:13,766
[SPEAKER_02]: It was nice not having to rely on a separate device.

1616
02:05:13,806 --> 02:05:16,388
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd just have to change the plugs and bam, there it was, you know.

1617
02:05:17,409 --> 02:05:27,756
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, I really have to say I had a lot, even though I still laugh my ass off to this day with the Dreamcast vs. PS2 video that was online.

1618
02:05:29,036 --> 02:05:30,277
[SPEAKER_02]: What a disappointment video.

1619
02:05:30,717 --> 02:05:31,338
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember that one?

1620
02:05:31,438 --> 02:05:31,698
[SPEAKER_08]: I do.

1621
02:05:31,778 --> 02:05:34,060
[SPEAKER_08]: You've done just a cookie here on the show before, yeah.

1622
02:05:35,260 --> 02:05:36,580
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, moving on.

1623
02:05:37,541 --> 02:05:41,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as a secondary closing topic, I'd like to get some information from you three, if possible.

1624
02:05:42,221 --> 02:05:43,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what we do a show for.

1625
02:05:43,442 --> 02:05:43,882
[SPEAKER_02]: We charge.

1626
02:05:44,882 --> 02:05:45,562
[SPEAKER_02]: By the hour.

1627
02:05:45,862 --> 02:05:58,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I've been mulling over some notion of starting my own business, specifically an arcade that primarily focuses on games, spanning from the late 1970s to the early 2000s, with a few music games like DDR thrown in for good measure.

1628
02:05:58,584 --> 02:06:03,585
[SPEAKER_02]: For a good ten years now, the main hurdle is that I know virtually nothing about the subject of starting up and running a business.

1629
02:06:04,245 --> 02:06:18,159
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there are some basics like having to lease retail space, pay for utilities, needing to incorporate the business, possibly filing for either loans and or grants, buying necessities for the business in case of PC for business purposes, and of course the arcade games.

1630
02:06:18,659 --> 02:06:20,101
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the extent of what I know.

1631
02:06:20,261 --> 02:06:23,124
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said, what advice can you give regarding this?

1632
02:06:23,644 --> 02:06:28,066
[SPEAKER_02]: and yes, I know that arcades are pretty much dead but I'm confident that I can make this work.

1633
02:06:28,146 --> 02:06:32,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Any info that you have would be provided would be greatly appreciated and thank you in advance.

1634
02:06:32,728 --> 02:06:34,969
[SPEAKER_02]: This email is brought to you by Mr. Hanky the Christmas Pooh.

1635
02:06:35,089 --> 02:06:36,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Howdy ho!

1636
02:06:37,384 --> 02:06:40,345
[SPEAKER_08]: I will give some very blunt, frank advice with the whole business.

1637
02:06:40,505 --> 02:06:44,026
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never started a business, so I honestly couldn't tell you like some insider secret.

1638
02:06:44,386 --> 02:06:44,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh?

1639
02:06:44,647 --> 02:06:45,067
[SPEAKER_02]: We've run one.

1640
02:06:45,607 --> 02:06:46,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan and I have.

1641
02:06:46,227 --> 02:06:47,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is my advice.

1642
02:06:47,868 --> 02:06:49,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you will agree or you won't agree.

1643
02:06:49,788 --> 02:06:54,230
[SPEAKER_08]: My advice is you need to take a class or read a book on starting your own business.

1644
02:06:54,350 --> 02:06:58,491
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you don't have the time to do that or the money to do that, then you don't have the time or the money to start your own business.

1645
02:06:58,671 --> 02:06:59,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1646
02:06:59,692 --> 02:07:00,292
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said...

1647
02:07:02,524 --> 02:07:18,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan went into business with the lady that used to be one of the owners of Video Game Swappers locally here and so in that case there was already the space, there was already the inventory we put up a lot of our own games too all of our Dragon Ball Z figures, my old manga we sold a lot of our own stuff

1648
02:07:19,823 --> 02:07:29,231
[SPEAKER_02]: The big thing is that if you've got the space and the stuff and that you need to get the business license and before you need the business license, you need to look up what the local laws are.

1649
02:07:29,491 --> 02:07:33,554
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to make sure that you don't have to have just a county business license.

1650
02:07:33,855 --> 02:07:36,857
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have to have a city license.

1651
02:07:37,638 --> 02:07:41,081
[SPEAKER_02]: For me as a massage therapist, I had to have a county and city license.

1652
02:07:41,721 --> 02:07:43,363
[SPEAKER_02]: In some cases, you need a state license.

1653
02:07:43,983 --> 02:07:46,404
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like I said, I've been on multiple sides of this.

1654
02:07:47,584 --> 02:07:48,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with Rob.

1655
02:07:48,364 --> 02:07:49,745
[SPEAKER_02]: You should really take a business class.

1656
02:07:49,905 --> 02:07:52,746
[SPEAKER_02]: In some cases, a lot of it is fairly common sense.

1657
02:07:53,386 --> 02:07:56,887
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can figure it out if you've got that kind of logical mind.

1658
02:07:57,847 --> 02:08:04,489
[SPEAKER_02]: But you really do need to know the legalities of it before you remotely put down any money, before you remotely look for any sponsors.

1659
02:08:04,509 --> 02:08:11,031
[SPEAKER_08]: We're still trying to start VOG as a legitimate business so we can do some of these things like sell t-shirts and some of the other things you guys have been asking for.

1660
02:08:11,071 --> 02:08:12,392
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not easy.

1661
02:08:12,412 --> 02:08:12,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1662
02:08:13,533 --> 02:08:14,654
[SPEAKER_02]: to make sure we do it right.

1663
02:08:14,834 --> 02:08:19,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially in our case, we're looking at a multinational type of thing.

1664
02:08:21,122 --> 02:08:22,303
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of stuff that goes into it.

1665
02:08:22,984 --> 02:08:28,270
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're going to have to have your fictitious name for your business.

1666
02:08:29,071 --> 02:08:32,655
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the name that goes on your business license and then it is registered to you.

1667
02:08:33,576 --> 02:08:49,664
[SPEAKER_02]: from that point on any of your accounts are going to be registered in that fictitious name being your bank account being any savings associated with it being paying your taxes you're going to need an accountant that's for damn sure it's a lot of money that goes into running a business and I don't suggest doing it by yourself

1668
02:08:51,080 --> 02:08:52,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's great advice too.

1669
02:08:52,421 --> 02:08:53,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Find a business partner.

1670
02:08:54,322 --> 02:08:56,324
[SPEAKER_08]: And just be careful with that idea.

1671
02:08:56,344 --> 02:08:58,205
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people lose a lot of money on that.

1672
02:08:58,345 --> 02:09:00,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Arcades are dying and you're not going to save them alone.

1673
02:09:01,067 --> 02:09:03,929
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you have a good idea, you never know what might happen.

1674
02:09:05,130 --> 02:09:08,152
[SPEAKER_08]: What's going to be the thing that draws people to your arcade when they can play games at home?

1675
02:09:08,352 --> 02:09:10,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that going to be that you do kick-ass birthday parties?

1676
02:09:10,633 --> 02:09:11,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you sell booze?

1677
02:09:12,515 --> 02:09:14,036
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what Dave and Buster's do.

1678
02:09:14,056 --> 02:09:16,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's what a lot of these retro arcades do.

1679
02:09:16,357 --> 02:09:25,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the other thing to also, and this just occurred to me too, is that especially in regards to... I forgot what I was going to say.

1680
02:09:26,009 --> 02:09:35,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know it's a big thing too, is you need to make sure that not only do you check with the legality behind it, you also check with...

1681
02:09:36,181 --> 02:09:43,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just the legality behind getting the license, but the legalities around how you handle your money with the place.

1682
02:09:43,885 --> 02:09:51,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind that I think the rule of thumb is that any business is expected to lose money in its first five years before it turns a profit.

1683
02:09:52,249 --> 02:10:09,769
[SPEAKER_02]: also check with your local you know wherever you have to register through there are first time business startup plans that can help you with this a lot of places have a complete checklist on their you know be it county be it city website that's going to show you what to do so you've got the information out there but I think

1684
02:10:11,610 --> 02:10:29,854
[SPEAKER_02]: you've done a lot of research clearly I think the best thing for you to do is look at everything that you need make yourself an outline and make yourself a timeline and make sure that you have that if there's any cost associated with whatever is coming up on your timeline that you have that money by then and that you've got some extra

1685
02:10:30,782 --> 02:10:35,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, fifth dream in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, there's a novel idea, Arcade and Strippers.

1686
02:10:36,368 --> 02:10:37,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, that's something that hasn't been done.

1687
02:10:38,910 --> 02:10:42,774
[SPEAKER_08]: But then again, a whole other set of laws that come when you have titties out in the open.

1688
02:10:42,994 --> 02:10:43,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I will tell you this.

1689
02:10:43,875 --> 02:10:45,256
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredibly stupid.

1690
02:10:45,356 --> 02:10:45,557
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1691
02:10:45,997 --> 02:10:51,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that in San Francisco, if I was going to be a massage therapist there, I would actually have to have an adult entertainment license.

1692
02:10:51,823 --> 02:10:52,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

1693
02:10:53,104 --> 02:10:54,005
[SPEAKER_02]: To do massage.

1694
02:10:54,125 --> 02:10:55,346
[SPEAKER_08]: So you could do topless massage.

1695
02:10:55,506 --> 02:10:55,746
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1696
02:10:56,607 --> 02:10:58,548
[SPEAKER_02]: This is so stupid.

1697
02:10:58,568 --> 02:11:03,812
[SPEAKER_02]: They treat the massage and holistic health industry as adult entertainment.

1698
02:11:04,713 --> 02:11:05,614
[SPEAKER_02]: So fucking stupid.

1699
02:11:07,635 --> 02:11:10,498
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like there's any shortage of adult entertainment in San Francisco.

1700
02:11:10,618 --> 02:11:13,742
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the whole happy ending thing that's ruined it for all of us.

1701
02:11:14,262 --> 02:11:16,365
[SPEAKER_02]: They talked about that day one in massage school.

1702
02:11:16,485 --> 02:11:17,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't do it anymore because of my hand.

1703
02:11:19,348 --> 02:11:19,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy ending?

1704
02:11:21,029 --> 02:11:21,370
[SPEAKER_08]: No!

1705
02:11:23,252 --> 02:11:23,852
[SPEAKER_08]: You're so mean.

1706
02:11:24,113 --> 02:11:25,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that it for the email?

1707
02:11:25,995 --> 02:11:28,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the video where the happy ending is just parties and clapping.

1708
02:11:28,737 --> 02:11:29,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, me too.

1709
02:11:30,900 --> 02:11:35,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to give Jamie some work for a future week.

1710
02:11:36,004 --> 02:11:39,947
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, though, it's time for the FUs of the week.

1711
02:11:40,748 --> 02:11:41,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1712
02:11:41,168 --> 02:11:42,329
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1713
02:11:58,194 --> 02:12:07,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a big F you to the person who was driving the not-so-fresh El Camino in the rain the other day on my street, zipped around the corner, and nearly ran into Dan's car.

1714
02:12:09,059 --> 02:12:13,081
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, don't speed on the damn road when it's raining.

1715
02:12:13,121 --> 02:12:14,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't speed through a neighborhood.

1716
02:12:15,742 --> 02:12:16,783
[SPEAKER_02]: You are the lowest of low.

1717
02:12:16,803 --> 02:12:19,684
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a special place in hell for you if I believed in hell.

1718
02:12:20,745 --> 02:12:21,185
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

1719
02:12:21,305 --> 02:12:24,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I might just believe in hell for the vague reason that you might go there.

1720
02:12:25,247 --> 02:12:26,327
[SPEAKER_08]: You're gonna make an exception.

1721
02:12:26,708 --> 02:12:27,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make an exception.

1722
02:12:29,926 --> 02:12:35,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, FU to having to coordinate shipping Grand Theft Auto 5.

1723
02:12:35,570 --> 02:12:39,753
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as I can't wait to play the game, it's gonna be a fucking nightmare.

1724
02:12:39,793 --> 02:12:43,176
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Call of Duty 2 times this year instead of once.

1725
02:12:46,222 --> 02:12:50,283
[SPEAKER_08]: My a few of the week goes to being sick again from a convention.

1726
02:12:50,983 --> 02:12:55,805
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like I don't wash my hands and drink vitamin C and all the things you're supposed to do.

1727
02:12:56,085 --> 02:12:57,165
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all the other people that don't.

1728
02:12:57,245 --> 02:12:58,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's all the other people.

1729
02:12:58,465 --> 02:12:59,085
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it is.

1730
02:12:59,145 --> 02:13:00,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Other people's fault.

1731
02:13:00,126 --> 02:13:00,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Never my fault.

1732
02:13:01,046 --> 02:13:01,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

1733
02:13:01,486 --> 02:13:01,726
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1734
02:13:02,266 --> 02:13:08,428
[SPEAKER_02]: You do know the theory goes that doing all of those extra preventative measures might actually weaken your immune system to fighting off colds?

1735
02:13:09,318 --> 02:13:11,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Weren't you the one telling me to take zinc when I went?

1736
02:13:12,042 --> 02:13:13,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I was telling you to take zinc.

1737
02:13:13,844 --> 02:13:19,972
[SPEAKER_02]: But regardless of that, you know, people rely on that stuff too much instead of making themselves stronger.

1738
02:13:19,992 --> 02:13:21,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to say an F you to being sick.

1739
02:13:21,795 --> 02:13:23,036
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awfully inconvenient.

1740
02:13:23,057 --> 02:13:26,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of washing your hands when you get done at the con, you just lick them clean.

1741
02:13:27,402 --> 02:13:29,282
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you'll feel much better later on.

1742
02:13:29,302 --> 02:13:31,523
[SPEAKER_08]: You're such an asshole.

1743
02:13:31,563 --> 02:13:32,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm serious.

1744
02:13:32,403 --> 02:13:33,523
[SPEAKER_08]: This is really draining me.

1745
02:13:33,543 --> 02:13:35,484
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really having to push to finish the show tonight.

1746
02:13:35,524 --> 02:13:40,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank God we only have two more stories and then we get into Twitter topics and calls and then we're done.

1747
02:13:41,505 --> 02:13:42,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get me wrong.

1748
02:13:42,205 --> 02:13:44,986
[SPEAKER_08]: I love doing this show and I love all you guys that turn out to listen.

1749
02:13:45,006 --> 02:13:46,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have brought you some soup, Rob.

1750
02:13:46,426 --> 02:13:47,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1751
02:13:47,526 --> 02:13:47,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.

1752
02:13:48,306 --> 02:13:50,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would you apologize for not buying me something?

1753
02:13:50,767 --> 02:13:50,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Because.

1754
02:13:51,087 --> 02:13:59,696
[SPEAKER_08]: because I do nice stuff for people and I feel bad when it occurs to me after the fact you know what I'm going to do right now I'm going to go fix myself an emergency while Loki does this next story

1755
02:14:02,083 --> 02:14:08,728
[SPEAKER_06]: So that oft rumor that, hey, there's going to be another TimeSplitters game is finally true.

1756
02:14:09,068 --> 02:14:10,669
[SPEAKER_06]: There is going to be another TimeSplitters game.

1757
02:14:10,809 --> 02:14:12,590
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to be new necessarily.

1758
02:14:12,910 --> 02:14:14,131
[SPEAKER_06]: It's TimeSplitters Rewind.

1759
02:14:14,191 --> 02:14:22,457
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically a, I guess they're saying it's a ragtag team of fans constructing the game.

1760
02:14:22,977 --> 02:14:27,120
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're going to start on developing a PlayStation 4 version of the game.

1761
02:14:27,880 --> 02:14:34,147
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he said, you know, we actually are going to go ahead and start development of TimeSplitters Rewind on PlayStation 4.

1762
02:14:34,807 --> 02:14:47,240
[SPEAKER_06]: We're pretty confident Crytek's going to say go ahead and do it, but we don't want them saying go ahead and do it when we're caught with our pants down, like we're halfway through development and start...

1763
02:14:47,780 --> 02:14:54,185
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Crytek, I guess they've approved the PC version of the game.

1764
02:14:55,506 --> 02:14:58,128
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess that's going through some testing right now as well.

1765
02:14:59,089 --> 02:15:03,613
[SPEAKER_06]: But not really approved, I guess, the PlayStation 4 version yet.

1766
02:15:03,693 --> 02:15:05,294
[SPEAKER_06]: But, hey, I don't care.

1767
02:15:05,374 --> 02:15:07,516
[SPEAKER_06]: PC version's good enough for me.

1768
02:15:09,537 --> 02:15:10,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Kids like PCs.

1769
02:15:10,891 --> 02:15:11,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1770
02:15:11,752 --> 02:15:14,073
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know.

1771
02:15:14,654 --> 02:15:20,639
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, TimeSplitters, kind of HD, I guess, with all the crazy stuff in there.

1772
02:15:21,839 --> 02:15:23,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I could dig that.

1773
02:15:25,522 --> 02:15:25,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, thank you.

1774
02:15:26,223 --> 02:15:27,924
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura's giving me more Ricola.

1775
02:15:28,124 --> 02:15:29,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saving one for my ride home.

1776
02:15:29,325 --> 02:15:30,606
[SPEAKER_08]: You're taking pity on me.

1777
02:15:30,726 --> 02:15:34,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me, I buy huge, massive bags of Ricolas.

1778
02:15:34,522 --> 02:15:35,143
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1779
02:15:51,363 --> 02:15:54,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy 7 is 17 years old as of yesterday, right?

1780
02:16:10,620 --> 02:16:13,664
[SPEAKER_08]: For an amateur film, it's pretty well made.

1781
02:16:13,905 --> 02:16:17,109
[SPEAKER_08]: It's amazing what people can do with their phones and HD cameras.

1782
02:16:17,169 --> 02:16:18,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think anyone needs filming out their phones.

1783
02:16:18,771 --> 02:16:24,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know what I mean though, but I'm just saying in general, you have HD cameras on your phone, just spend another...

1784
02:16:25,619 --> 02:16:29,020
[SPEAKER_08]: and you get these fancy cameras that are capable of a lot.

1785
02:16:29,840 --> 02:16:35,302
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, the group that's producing it is Bad Pixel and there's actually a trailer that's out there that you can see.

1786
02:16:36,082 --> 02:16:41,584
[SPEAKER_08]: They are actually pitching the idea to Square Enix to try to get permission to proceed with development.

1787
02:16:42,124 --> 02:16:47,045
[SPEAKER_08]: If that is successful, they're going to turn to Kickstarter to raise the funds to actually make the film.

1788
02:16:48,426 --> 02:16:50,746
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a whole part about Square Enix screen lighting it though.

1789
02:16:51,066 --> 02:16:52,627
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that's going to happen in a million years.

1790
02:16:52,927 --> 02:17:00,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, at least they're going the correct route instead of let's go ahead and do it on Kickstarter and wait for it to get shut down.

1791
02:17:00,530 --> 02:17:00,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1792
02:17:00,970 --> 02:17:04,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Rather than, you know, let's ask permission first and then... Right.

1793
02:17:06,211 --> 02:17:08,812
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, at least they're going about it that way.

1794
02:17:08,892 --> 02:17:15,574
[SPEAKER_08]: But, yeah, I just... You know, when they shut down that Chrono Trigger remake project and, you know, they're very protective of their IPs.

1795
02:17:15,634 --> 02:17:17,095
[SPEAKER_08]: I just kind of don't see this happening.

1796
02:17:17,575 --> 02:17:21,397
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they want to do... They have, what, Advent Children.

1797
02:17:21,477 --> 02:17:22,878
[SPEAKER_08]: They had The Spirits Within.

1798
02:17:22,918 --> 02:17:24,839
[SPEAKER_08]: They kind of want to make their movies animated.

1799
02:17:25,379 --> 02:17:25,719
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1800
02:17:25,739 --> 02:17:34,643
[SPEAKER_08]: They just... Final Fantasy VI is a pretty precious franchise, and I think it's still due for a remake at some point, isn't it?

1801
02:17:34,823 --> 02:17:36,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Because V got its remake on iOS.

1802
02:17:36,884 --> 02:17:38,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Shouldn't VI get something?

1803
02:17:39,706 --> 02:17:41,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they're saving it for something big.

1804
02:17:41,166 --> 02:17:41,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

1805
02:17:42,307 --> 02:17:42,447
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

1806
02:17:44,733 --> 02:17:45,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Good luck to these guys.

1807
02:17:45,894 --> 02:17:51,778
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying I don't want to see it happen, but I just, I don't know, I just kind of think Square Enix isn't going to give it permission.

1808
02:17:51,838 --> 02:17:54,920
[SPEAKER_08]: But props to you guys for creating the impressive trailer that you did.

1809
02:17:56,075 --> 02:17:57,076
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1810
02:18:23,194 --> 02:18:23,875
[SPEAKER_08]: We will get to that.

1811
02:18:24,255 --> 02:18:26,358
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, last minute stories.

1812
02:18:26,618 --> 02:18:27,660
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if we have anything, Loki?

1813
02:18:28,220 --> 02:18:28,901
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have anything.

1814
02:18:29,502 --> 02:18:29,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1815
02:18:29,782 --> 02:18:30,583
[SPEAKER_08]: At least not yet.

1816
02:18:31,044 --> 02:18:33,307
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we covered a lot of stuff during the show.

1817
02:18:34,386 --> 02:18:38,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's just not a whole ton of new stuff right now.

1818
02:18:39,868 --> 02:18:44,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially, like, no stories about, like, Grand Theft Auto V leaking out there on the internet, unfortunately.

1819
02:18:45,310 --> 02:18:46,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, has it leaked?

1820
02:18:46,370 --> 02:18:47,630
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I said it has not.

1821
02:18:47,951 --> 02:18:48,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1822
02:18:48,271 --> 02:18:49,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, it has not, yeah, so.

1823
02:18:51,012 --> 02:18:52,172
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, I do have a few.

1824
02:18:52,392 --> 02:18:54,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we have a call coming in, so let's go to it.

1825
02:18:56,175 --> 02:18:57,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1826
02:18:57,255 --> 02:18:57,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

1827
02:18:58,256 --> 02:18:59,016
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Ranma.

1828
02:18:59,036 --> 02:19:02,317
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to make sure the Skype line does not crap out on anybody tonight.

1829
02:19:02,477 --> 02:19:03,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hope.

1830
02:19:03,097 --> 02:19:04,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Hang up after two seconds.

1831
02:19:04,717 --> 02:19:07,898
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to last 20 seconds to beat your call into Bobby's show.

1832
02:19:07,938 --> 02:19:08,298
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?

1833
02:19:09,079 --> 02:19:09,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Not much.

1834
02:19:09,479 --> 02:19:18,381
[SPEAKER_05]: I have my stopwatch ready, but Rob, as somebody who's been going to cons for about 15 years, I'm going to give you a basic homemade remedy that should fix things up for you.

1835
02:19:18,521 --> 02:19:18,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1836
02:19:20,622 --> 02:19:21,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Black tea.

1837
02:19:21,162 --> 02:19:23,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Two shoots of honey.

1838
02:19:23,302 --> 02:19:25,043
[SPEAKER_05]: A bit of lemon.

1839
02:19:26,047 --> 02:19:30,733
[SPEAKER_05]: A little shot of vodka, half a shot, and two tablespoons of tussin.

1840
02:19:30,913 --> 02:19:31,414
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll be fine.

1841
02:19:32,515 --> 02:19:33,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Ugh, tussin, ugh.

1842
02:19:34,111 --> 02:19:36,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, just raw honey is really, really good for all that.

1843
02:19:37,073 --> 02:19:37,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Raw honey.

1844
02:19:37,914 --> 02:19:47,080
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been trying to drink tea, so, yeah, no, I don't... Man, it's just weird that it's happening after every convention that I go to, so I just, yeah, irritating.

1845
02:19:47,100 --> 02:19:55,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the more conventions you go to, your complex immunity builds up, so... Yeah, I guess that's true.

1846
02:19:55,906 --> 02:20:02,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, congrats, you made it a full minute, so apparently it was your connection with Bobby that was not appreciated by Skype.

1847
02:20:02,590 --> 02:20:03,531
[SPEAKER_08]: What else is on your mind, buddy?

1848
02:20:04,451 --> 02:20:09,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I want to go back to about two weeks ago when I called you out by accident about DuckTales.

1849
02:20:10,233 --> 02:20:10,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1850
02:20:11,213 --> 02:20:11,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1851
02:20:12,193 --> 02:20:16,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I understand your issues with the game, with the sound and the cutscenes and so forth.

1852
02:20:17,015 --> 02:20:27,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, personally, I guess because I bought it for, I got it for PS3, I didn't have any issues with the sound, the voices, but with the cinematic sequence, just, I really enjoyed it.

1853
02:20:27,498 --> 02:20:33,460
[SPEAKER_05]: It felt like as if I was just watching like a five-part miniseries just as I'm going through every stage.

1854
02:20:34,522 --> 02:20:38,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, I think at the end of the day, I did recommend the game.

1855
02:20:38,444 --> 02:20:43,626
[SPEAKER_08]: I just kind of thought there wasn't enough action before those sequences would consistently break things up.

1856
02:20:44,147 --> 02:20:46,168
[SPEAKER_08]: That was one thing that kind of irritated me.

1857
02:20:46,228 --> 02:20:49,209
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess in some regards, that is true of the NES version.

1858
02:20:49,229 --> 02:20:50,410
[SPEAKER_08]: It had some of that too.

1859
02:20:51,290 --> 02:20:51,910
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know.

1860
02:20:52,310 --> 02:20:55,672
[SPEAKER_08]: It just felt like the action kept being interrupted on the newer one.

1861
02:20:55,692 --> 02:20:57,413
[SPEAKER_08]: That was just what really bugged me.

1862
02:20:58,308 --> 02:20:59,309
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1863
02:21:17,105 --> 02:21:19,466
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1864
02:21:41,004 --> 02:21:46,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, my only issue is the fact that I had to go to Shamestop to pick up the collector's edition.

1865
02:21:46,426 --> 02:21:49,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Come to find out that certain Target locations had it.

1866
02:21:49,727 --> 02:21:49,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

1867
02:21:51,007 --> 02:21:51,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

1868
02:21:51,488 --> 02:21:52,548
[SPEAKER_08]: But at least you got the pin.

1869
02:21:53,248 --> 02:21:55,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I did, and it's sitting on my shelf in the case.

1870
02:21:55,689 --> 02:21:57,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Next time you go to a Disney park, you can wear it.

1871
02:21:58,150 --> 02:21:58,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn right.

1872
02:21:58,730 --> 02:21:59,190
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1873
02:21:59,971 --> 02:22:03,612
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, Ranma Buddy, any other comments or questions for us tonight?

1874
02:22:04,585 --> 02:22:05,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Quick funny thing.

1875
02:22:05,345 --> 02:22:09,067
[SPEAKER_05]: This was at my old job, and my supervisor was a big DuckTales fan.

1876
02:22:09,147 --> 02:22:15,270
[SPEAKER_05]: And he would repeat this line from one of the episodes where Scrooge was losing his mind about a sea monster ate his ice cream.

1877
02:22:15,350 --> 02:22:21,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I turned around and looked at him and goes, that was not his... It's just along the lines of, that was a sea monster.

1878
02:22:21,032 --> 02:22:22,153
[SPEAKER_05]: That was half his fortune.

1879
02:22:22,313 --> 02:22:23,193
[SPEAKER_05]: He looked at me crazy.

1880
02:22:23,233 --> 02:22:24,534
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, go to YouTube.

1881
02:22:24,734 --> 02:22:27,815
[SPEAKER_05]: He pulled up that episode, and that was the follow-up line to it.

1882
02:22:27,835 --> 02:22:29,536
[SPEAKER_05]: And he just gave me this look of, how do you know that?

1883
02:22:29,576 --> 02:22:29,956
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like...

1884
02:22:30,456 --> 02:22:34,657
[SPEAKER_05]: I have this odd tendency for odd pop culture cartoons and references like that.

1885
02:22:34,757 --> 02:22:39,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, I'm sure they screen DuckTales at 3am at some anime conventions.

1886
02:22:39,558 --> 02:22:40,938
[SPEAKER_08]: You get high and watch some.

1887
02:22:41,018 --> 02:22:41,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

1888
02:22:42,338 --> 02:22:42,838
[SPEAKER_08]: No!

1889
02:22:43,159 --> 02:22:54,061
[SPEAKER_05]: The only time you get high at anime conventions is somebody's doing Anime Hell Night or something like that and you just sit there and you just lose your effing mind and you chant for blue screen over and over.

1890
02:22:54,081 --> 02:22:54,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh.

1891
02:22:56,461 --> 02:22:57,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, there are stories.

1892
02:22:58,122 --> 02:23:00,623
[SPEAKER_08]: We will have to talk offline, but I have some stories for you.

1893
02:23:00,864 --> 02:23:01,224
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure.

1894
02:23:01,284 --> 02:23:05,146
[SPEAKER_08]: And the listeners can hear some of those stories on Anime Jam Session.

1895
02:23:05,767 --> 02:23:10,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and we're getting ready for our very first 21-plus anime convention this weekend.

1896
02:23:10,550 --> 02:23:11,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, that sounds like it might be fun.

1897
02:23:12,592 --> 02:23:20,037
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been told it's okay to walk around bottomless, topless, alcohol without alcohol, because we have our own private beach.

1898
02:23:20,077 --> 02:23:21,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Where the hell is this being held?

1899
02:23:21,478 --> 02:23:21,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Nevada?

1900
02:23:22,698 --> 02:23:24,820
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Provincetown, Massachusetts.

1901
02:23:25,134 --> 02:23:26,035
[SPEAKER_08]: DragonCon 2014 I'm busy bro

1902
02:23:54,656 --> 02:23:56,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, don't even get me started on PAX East.

1903
02:23:56,837 --> 02:24:08,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I am ready with... My staff knows as soon as they hear about the hotels, you call, text, tweet, whatever, so I can jump to a computer and shank somebody for two rooms at the Westin.

1904
02:24:08,384 --> 02:24:17,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm praying that at least one of the VOG guys is able to get a room and I can piggyback on that, because I'm pretty sure Travis and Bobby and Brad will all be hammering the phones the day those open up, so...

1905
02:24:19,230 --> 02:24:20,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, I'm also Team VOG.

1906
02:24:20,430 --> 02:24:20,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I got you.

1907
02:24:21,071 --> 02:24:22,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember.

1908
02:24:22,651 --> 02:24:23,191
[SPEAKER_05]: It comes to us.

1909
02:24:23,231 --> 02:24:26,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I was talking about DragonCon, but yes, PAX East.

1910
02:24:26,652 --> 02:24:27,593
[SPEAKER_08]: I will look you up, buddy.

1911
02:24:28,333 --> 02:24:29,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell yeah, man.

1912
02:24:29,433 --> 02:24:37,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I should let you go to get more calls, but take care and everybody check out Anime Jam Session now, immediately following Electric Sisterhood, Tuesdays at VOG.

1913
02:24:38,776 --> 02:24:39,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, take care, buddy.

1914
02:24:39,916 --> 02:24:40,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, later.

1915
02:24:40,517 --> 02:24:40,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

1916
02:24:42,657 --> 02:24:46,599
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1917
02:24:48,120 --> 02:24:49,060
[SPEAKER_08]: And give us a call.

1918
02:24:49,860 --> 02:24:51,521
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple tweets I'm getting here.

1919
02:24:52,421 --> 02:24:52,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

1920
02:24:53,142 --> 02:24:54,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Some tweets from Tigerclaw tonight.

1921
02:24:55,483 --> 02:24:58,164
[SPEAKER_08]: EA to close Battleforge next month.

1922
02:24:59,504 --> 02:25:03,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Battleforge is one of EA's studios, and they are sadly going to be closed.

1923
02:25:03,506 --> 02:25:05,807
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to bring up the story to see what they made.

1924
02:25:06,367 --> 02:25:08,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, they were a play for free.

1925
02:25:08,988 --> 02:25:09,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Who are these guys?

1926
02:25:11,189 --> 02:25:11,809
[SPEAKER_08]: That's too bad.

1927
02:25:11,829 --> 02:25:14,971
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to see what games they made, but I don't see anything in the list here.

1928
02:25:14,991 --> 02:25:16,552
[SPEAKER_08]: But they are closing at the end of October.

1929
02:25:17,332 --> 02:25:21,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Never good to hear about people losing their jobs, so our thoughts go out to them.

1930
02:25:22,695 --> 02:25:28,658
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw sends us one more tweet about the Halo designer calling out Hideo Kojima over the sexy comments.

1931
02:25:29,759 --> 02:25:30,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God.

1932
02:25:30,259 --> 02:25:31,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you hear about Kojima's sexy comments?

1933
02:25:31,860 --> 02:25:33,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it was creating quite the stir.

1934
02:25:34,261 --> 02:25:41,243
[SPEAKER_08]: about Metal Gear Solid 5 and how Quiet needed to be more erotic so more people would cosplay her for Tokyo Game Show.

1935
02:25:41,843 --> 02:25:42,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1936
02:25:42,603 --> 02:25:45,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he kind of put his foot in his mouth with that comment.

1937
02:25:50,324 --> 02:25:54,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Kojima clarified with Polygon later he meant to say sexy, not erotic.

1938
02:25:57,106 --> 02:25:57,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1939
02:25:58,723 --> 02:26:01,624
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think it was a bad word choice all around.

1940
02:26:02,085 --> 02:26:03,545
[SPEAKER_08]: I started to give him the benefit of the doubt.

1941
02:26:03,565 --> 02:26:07,107
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, is it maybe one of those things that's lost in translation or something?

1942
02:26:09,728 --> 02:26:13,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, yeah, in this article, the Tiger Claw linked us.

1943
02:26:14,491 --> 02:26:15,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, who is this?

1944
02:26:17,612 --> 02:26:24,615
[SPEAKER_08]: David Ellis, Halo designer, said, eccentricity is a cute cover word for objectification and sexism.

1945
02:26:26,256 --> 02:26:27,297
[SPEAKER_08]: We got another call coming in.

1946
02:26:27,337 --> 02:26:27,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to it.

1947
02:26:29,073 --> 02:26:30,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge.

1948
02:26:30,775 --> 02:26:31,556
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still connecting there.

1949
02:26:31,576 --> 02:26:32,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1950
02:26:32,457 --> 02:26:32,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

1951
02:26:34,599 --> 02:26:35,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Boom!

1952
02:26:35,159 --> 02:26:36,140
It's Jim Sally.

1953
02:26:36,380 --> 02:26:37,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Jim Sally.

1954
02:26:37,061 --> 02:26:38,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Jim Sally, you're sideways.

1955
02:26:38,422 --> 02:26:39,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you're sideways today.

1956
02:26:39,584 --> 02:26:39,964
[SPEAKER_08]: That's okay.

1957
02:26:40,004 --> 02:26:41,305
[SPEAKER_08]: We will turn our... Oh, there you go.

1958
02:26:41,405 --> 02:26:43,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you're... He's in MTV cam.

1959
02:26:43,648 --> 02:26:45,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim Sally's tech support with a smile.

1960
02:26:47,111 --> 02:26:48,513
[SPEAKER_08]: You have very nice teeth, Jim Sally.

1961
02:26:49,113 --> 02:26:49,694
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, don't I?

1962
02:26:49,714 --> 02:26:50,755
[SPEAKER_00]: I brush every day, man.

1963
02:26:50,775 --> 02:26:51,716
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good, that's good.

1964
02:26:51,876 --> 02:26:52,156
[SPEAKER_08]: You should.

1965
02:26:52,176 --> 02:26:53,438
[SPEAKER_00]: I had that big gap right there, though.

1966
02:26:53,458 --> 02:26:53,958
[SPEAKER_08]: That's okay.

1967
02:26:54,058 --> 02:26:55,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Madonna gets away with it, so do you.

1968
02:26:56,501 --> 02:26:57,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.

1969
02:26:57,282 --> 02:26:58,883
[SPEAKER_00]: I look just as cute as she does, I think.

1970
02:26:59,264 --> 02:27:01,026
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to start calling you the Material Boy.

1971
02:27:01,046 --> 02:27:03,088
[SPEAKER_00]: Material Boy, nice.

1972
02:27:03,869 --> 02:27:04,870
[SPEAKER_08]: So what's up, Jim Sally?

1973
02:27:05,871 --> 02:27:09,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, a little sidetrack for the last caller.

1974
02:27:09,294 --> 02:27:11,256
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to Providence Town, man, many a time.

1975
02:27:11,276 --> 02:27:11,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, really?

1976
02:27:11,637 --> 02:27:11,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

1977
02:27:12,588 --> 02:27:18,210
[SPEAKER_00]: My family, we're from Canada, but we vacationed in Cape Cod in this little town called Falmouth, and we used to always go to Providence Town.

1978
02:27:18,830 --> 02:27:19,550
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

1979
02:27:19,570 --> 02:27:20,691
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be honest with you.

1980
02:27:20,711 --> 02:27:30,534
[SPEAKER_00]: It had the cleanest beaches, nice places to walk, and it's definitely a different place when you go there compared to the rest of America.

1981
02:27:31,734 --> 02:27:33,915
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to hear a funny story that happened to me when I went there?

1982
02:27:33,975 --> 02:27:34,215
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

1983
02:27:34,535 --> 02:27:35,796
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell me if you think this.

1984
02:27:35,876 --> 02:27:38,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby doesn't think my stories are real, by the way, but this is real, Robert.

1985
02:27:38,857 --> 02:27:39,357
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you.

1986
02:27:39,657 --> 02:27:40,317
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe you.

1987
02:27:40,858 --> 02:27:41,318
[SPEAKER_00]: I was about 12, 13.

1988
02:27:43,724 --> 02:27:46,745
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just starting to get into baseball and I thought it was pretty cool.

1989
02:27:47,145 --> 02:27:49,166
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought I was going to be the best backcatcher ever.

1990
02:27:49,906 --> 02:27:53,707
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went to Providence and I was buying a lot of Red Sox gear and stuff there, right?

1991
02:27:53,747 --> 02:27:54,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Boston's close by.

1992
02:27:54,748 --> 02:27:57,928
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went to this one place that was selling t-shirts.

1993
02:27:58,349 --> 02:28:00,169
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had Boston Red Sox, everything else.

1994
02:28:00,769 --> 02:28:02,390
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they had novelty t-shirts.

1995
02:28:03,010 --> 02:28:05,911
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was one that I thought was backcatching related, so I got it.

1996
02:28:05,931 --> 02:28:06,731
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom let me buy it.

1997
02:28:06,771 --> 02:28:07,951
[SPEAKER_00]: She's Portuguese, she doesn't know any better.

1998
02:28:08,472 --> 02:28:09,732
[SPEAKER_00]: And the t-shirt said...

1999
02:28:10,755 --> 02:28:14,316
[SPEAKER_00]: You Pitchin', I'm Catchin' Oh no!

2000
02:28:14,336 --> 02:28:17,797
[SPEAKER_00]: I was good at it though, right?

2001
02:28:17,857 --> 02:28:19,277
[SPEAKER_00]: It was tight on my arms and stuff.

2002
02:28:19,317 --> 02:28:22,078
[SPEAKER_00]: I had little 12-year-old pipes back then too.

2003
02:28:23,018 --> 02:28:31,120
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of pictures of me 12 years old on that vacation wearing a t-shirt that says, You Pitchin', I'm Catchin' Did you wear it to baseball practice when you got home?

2004
02:28:31,140 --> 02:28:33,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm sure all the other kids just ate you alive.

2005
02:28:34,840 --> 02:28:37,181
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, yeah, that's where I found notable what that shirt really meant.

2006
02:28:40,433 --> 02:28:41,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.

2007
02:28:43,276 --> 02:28:46,499
[SPEAKER_08]: But you just wanted to be a catcher in baseball.

2008
02:28:46,960 --> 02:28:47,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Literally in baseball.

2009
02:28:49,082 --> 02:28:51,444
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, Jim Sully throws with his cannon.

2010
02:28:55,028 --> 02:28:56,609
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, you should vacation there, man.

2011
02:28:56,629 --> 02:28:57,891
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take my daughter there next year.

2012
02:28:59,362 --> 02:29:26,305
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to visit there I have seriously entertained the idea and I don't know when I'm going to have the time or the money to do this but I've really entertained the idea of just going out to the east coast and flying in there into a cheap airport and renting a car and just driving around the northeast to all the places I wanted to go because I want to see people in New York City although the idea of driving in New York City terrifies me I want to go to the Fun Spot Arcade that's out there I'd love to go to P-Town and there's just tons of stuff I'd love to do out there

2013
02:29:28,194 --> 02:29:32,238
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of arcades, we had someone talking a while ago about wanting to start their own arcade.

2014
02:29:32,278 --> 02:29:33,239
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was in the email.

2015
02:29:33,339 --> 02:29:34,080
[SPEAKER_08]: It was in the email.

2016
02:29:34,780 --> 02:29:39,005
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was 17, I managed an arcade in Kitchener for about three months.

2017
02:29:39,185 --> 02:29:40,446
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

2018
02:29:40,526 --> 02:29:43,269
[SPEAKER_00]: A little word of advice from me to that guy.

2019
02:29:43,969 --> 02:29:49,154
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a lot of stuff on consignment where the guys that own the machines just put them in your store.

2020
02:29:49,174 --> 02:29:51,036
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to pay anything for them, but you have to give them a cut.

2021
02:29:51,056 --> 02:29:51,697
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?

2022
02:29:51,717 --> 02:29:51,797
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

2023
02:29:52,225 --> 02:29:54,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything at one quarter, you get another quarter sort of a deal.

2024
02:29:54,647 --> 02:29:59,311
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can build up a lot of inventory that way without having to shell out a lot of cash, right?

2025
02:29:59,331 --> 02:29:59,632
[SPEAKER_00]: Who?

2026
02:29:59,652 --> 02:29:59,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

2027
02:29:59,792 --> 02:29:59,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2028
02:30:14,997 --> 02:30:19,319
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a great way too because those local owners can't, they don't have the facility to make any money.

2029
02:30:19,399 --> 02:30:22,261
[SPEAKER_00]: So for them, it's free money if you want to take the machine for a while.

2030
02:30:22,361 --> 02:30:24,282
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, especially at Disneyland of all places.

2031
02:30:24,342 --> 02:30:26,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, those machines got used heavily.

2032
02:30:27,024 --> 02:30:29,765
[SPEAKER_08]: And in fact, they finally did.

2033
02:30:29,805 --> 02:30:31,666
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like they read Disneyland fans' mind.

2034
02:30:31,686 --> 02:30:40,171
[SPEAKER_08]: They kind of did this mishmash of Flynn's Arcade and Wreck-It Ralph and they put it in the arcade that's right next to the exit at Space Mountain.

2035
02:30:40,291 --> 02:30:41,611
[SPEAKER_08]: So it kind of lives on a little bit.

2036
02:30:41,731 --> 02:30:42,772
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of cool stuff in there.

2037
02:30:43,672 --> 02:30:44,093
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cool.

2038
02:30:44,333 --> 02:30:44,533
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

2039
02:30:45,902 --> 02:30:46,742
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm walking around my house.

2040
02:30:46,762 --> 02:30:47,702
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for my dog.

2041
02:30:47,742 --> 02:30:48,763
[SPEAKER_00]: My dog ran outside.

2042
02:30:48,803 --> 02:30:49,003
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

2043
02:30:49,023 --> 02:30:51,583
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that we're getting the tour of Jim Sally's house.

2044
02:30:51,943 --> 02:30:54,124
[SPEAKER_08]: So quickly, Jim Sally, what else is on your mind tonight?

2045
02:30:56,324 --> 02:30:58,245
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a little delay in the podcast.

2046
02:30:58,285 --> 02:31:01,025
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened to my first one and it was a little too macho.

2047
02:31:01,585 --> 02:31:02,625
[SPEAKER_00]: I toned down the macho-ness.

2048
02:31:03,326 --> 02:31:07,126
[SPEAKER_00]: But I decided I'm going to start a new one called Jim Sally's Review Review.

2049
02:31:07,666 --> 02:31:09,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim Sally's Review Review.

2050
02:31:09,887 --> 02:31:12,287
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim Sally's Review Review.

2051
02:31:12,487 --> 02:31:13,388
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to sing the theme song?

2052
02:31:15,461 --> 02:31:17,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I review other people's reviews.

2053
02:31:17,303 --> 02:31:18,323
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much how it goes.

2054
02:31:19,865 --> 02:31:21,446
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to review other people's reviews.

2055
02:31:23,027 --> 02:31:24,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, I love it.

2056
02:31:24,329 --> 02:31:25,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you get that, DarkSakura?

2057
02:31:25,750 --> 02:31:27,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Jim Salley's Review Review.

2058
02:31:28,232 --> 02:31:29,833
[SPEAKER_08]: He's going to review other people's reviews.

2059
02:31:30,434 --> 02:31:30,914
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it.

2060
02:31:31,695 --> 02:31:32,796
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's sort of like a critique.

2061
02:31:33,176 --> 02:31:34,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, in a way.

2062
02:31:34,117 --> 02:31:37,259
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a critique of other people's critiques, because some people's critiques need critiquing.

2063
02:31:37,660 --> 02:31:38,240
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?

2064
02:31:38,280 --> 02:31:39,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

2065
02:31:40,319 --> 02:31:42,780
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an amazing idea, Jim.

2066
02:31:43,700 --> 02:31:45,121
[SPEAKER_08]: I look forward to hearing the first episode.

2067
02:31:45,141 --> 02:31:50,043
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so excited to hear that you are taking the podcasting idea to heart and really giving it a try.

2068
02:31:50,063 --> 02:31:53,324
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure Bobby would like a quick review of my review of Saints Row 4.

2069
02:31:54,945 --> 02:31:56,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's a good idea.

2070
02:31:56,706 --> 02:31:59,247
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to give you a piece of advice.

2071
02:31:59,327 --> 02:32:01,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Stay away from the articles written on VOG.

2072
02:32:01,368 --> 02:32:01,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't review those.

2073
02:32:02,848 --> 02:32:04,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's reviews coming, Robert.

2074
02:32:07,057 --> 02:32:07,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-oh.

2075
02:32:07,897 --> 02:32:08,277
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2076
02:32:08,757 --> 02:32:11,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Jim, Sally, before I let you go, any last thoughts?

2077
02:32:13,138 --> 02:32:15,319
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I just wanted to say hi to everybody today.

2078
02:32:15,379 --> 02:32:16,719
[SPEAKER_00]: I really missed you guys last week.

2079
02:32:16,759 --> 02:32:17,639
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have called me.

2080
02:32:18,139 --> 02:32:18,539
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

2081
02:32:18,599 --> 02:32:18,959
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

2082
02:32:19,019 --> 02:32:20,380
[SPEAKER_08]: I was having so much fun at DragonCon.

2083
02:32:20,640 --> 02:32:21,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Jim, Sally, I was so drunk.

2084
02:32:22,520 --> 02:32:24,120
[SPEAKER_08]: I was so drunk.

2085
02:32:26,141 --> 02:32:31,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Brad from PodCulture had me drink things I never thought I'd drink in my life, and it was marvelous.

2086
02:32:31,502 --> 02:32:31,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Ew.

2087
02:32:33,616 --> 02:32:34,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Liquor!

2088
02:32:34,257 --> 02:32:36,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, stop being ridiculous.

2089
02:32:36,758 --> 02:32:36,978
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

2090
02:32:37,779 --> 02:32:39,280
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you take your band with you?

2091
02:32:39,320 --> 02:32:40,181
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember his name now.

2092
02:32:40,281 --> 02:32:40,541
[SPEAKER_00]: Alan?

2093
02:32:40,561 --> 02:32:41,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you take Alan with you?

2094
02:32:41,501 --> 02:32:44,844
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Alan was not able to come because Alan, it's kind of expensive.

2095
02:32:44,864 --> 02:32:46,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan hung out with me.

2096
02:32:46,225 --> 02:32:46,685
[SPEAKER_08]: He had to work.

2097
02:32:46,705 --> 02:32:48,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Alan and DarkSakura hung out.

2098
02:32:48,446 --> 02:32:52,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan hung out with me and he helped me with my Skyrim and my Dragon Age stuff.

2099
02:32:53,049 --> 02:32:54,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that's two other games I did play.

2100
02:32:54,510 --> 02:32:55,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Skyrim and Dragon Age.

2101
02:32:55,311 --> 02:32:56,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they had a girls night.

2102
02:32:58,953 --> 02:32:59,774
[SPEAKER_02]: More like an actor.

2103
02:32:59,834 --> 02:33:02,355
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I drank mimosas all night and played rock band.

2104
02:33:02,476 --> 02:33:02,956
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

2105
02:33:03,256 --> 02:33:03,896
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a party.

2106
02:33:04,397 --> 02:33:04,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2107
02:33:05,637 --> 02:33:09,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Jim, I'm going to let you go so we can try to fit in one more call, but thank you as always.

2108
02:33:10,821 --> 02:33:11,621
[SPEAKER_08]: You macho man.

2109
02:33:12,762 --> 02:33:13,582
[SPEAKER_00]: You catcher.

2110
02:33:15,203 --> 02:33:16,024
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, bye buddy.

2111
02:33:17,285 --> 02:33:17,985
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you, Jamie.

2112
02:33:18,025 --> 02:33:19,046
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still my number one.

2113
02:33:20,962 --> 02:33:21,783
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you are.

2114
02:33:23,384 --> 02:33:25,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making hearts, but you can't see it.

2115
02:33:26,426 --> 02:33:28,127
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like he's going to poke me in the eye.

2116
02:33:28,147 --> 02:33:28,387
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2117
02:33:28,688 --> 02:33:30,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye, Jim Sally.

2118
02:33:30,089 --> 02:33:30,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

2119
02:33:33,511 --> 02:33:34,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

2120
02:33:34,592 --> 02:33:35,012
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it.

2121
02:33:35,993 --> 02:33:36,873
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2122
02:33:36,893 --> 02:33:39,855
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2123
02:33:39,875 --> 02:33:41,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like he just poked me in the eye.

2124
02:33:42,697 --> 02:33:43,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel dirty.

2125
02:33:43,857 --> 02:33:44,397
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit.

2126
02:33:44,417 --> 02:33:45,057
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit.

2127
02:33:45,077 --> 02:33:45,637
[SPEAKER_02]: A little dirty.

2128
02:33:45,817 --> 02:33:46,358
[SPEAKER_08]: A little dirty.

2129
02:33:46,698 --> 02:33:47,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of like it.

2130
02:33:48,578 --> 02:33:48,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my.

2131
02:33:50,438 --> 02:33:51,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to Twitter.

2132
02:33:51,519 --> 02:33:53,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to see if there's other stuff here on the Twitter.

2133
02:33:54,299 --> 02:33:55,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I do see a tweet from Bobby Blackwolf.

2134
02:33:55,939 --> 02:33:58,140
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to see if it's a troll.

2135
02:33:58,660 --> 02:33:59,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, it's not.

2136
02:33:59,980 --> 02:34:00,780
[SPEAKER_08]: This is legit.

2137
02:34:00,840 --> 02:34:04,001
[SPEAKER_08]: What he's sending us here from the website Road to VR.

2138
02:34:04,781 --> 02:34:08,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Oculus Rift support confirmed coming to Slender The Arrival.

2139
02:34:09,102 --> 02:34:10,363
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2140
02:34:38,682 --> 02:35:01,552
[SPEAKER_08]: I watched it though SSJ100Matt, again, one more plug for the phones to see if we get any calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio a tweet from SSJ100Matt tweeting us about that is apparently another Arcade War documentary a la King of Kong on its way out, it's called Man vs. Snake and it's about the game Nibbler

2141
02:35:02,898 --> 02:35:03,238
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2142
02:35:03,779 --> 02:35:10,886
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm kind of thinking to myself, I'm like, is that the game that's like Snake on the old school cellular phones?

2143
02:35:10,946 --> 02:35:12,247
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess Nibbler was like that.

2144
02:35:12,327 --> 02:35:13,809
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember Nibbler in the arcades.

2145
02:35:13,829 --> 02:35:17,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, remember they had Nibbles, which was on Basic.

2146
02:35:17,092 --> 02:35:21,816
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was the first game that had a high score table that could handle one billion plus points.

2147
02:35:22,577 --> 02:35:22,857
[SPEAKER_08]: And so...

2148
02:35:24,719 --> 02:35:25,881
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just ridiculous.

2149
02:35:26,422 --> 02:35:26,863
[SPEAKER_06]: One billion?

2150
02:35:27,123 --> 02:35:28,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, a lot.

2151
02:35:28,446 --> 02:35:33,454
[SPEAKER_08]: So Man vs. Snake is running a Kickstarter campaign, which, you know, isn't that what they're all doing?

2152
02:35:34,195 --> 02:35:35,297
[SPEAKER_08]: To try and get funded.

2153
02:35:35,898 --> 02:35:37,201
[SPEAKER_08]: So it can be in a theater near you.

2154
02:35:37,221 --> 02:35:38,443
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

2155
02:35:39,676 --> 02:35:44,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, one more call for calls and then we'll end it if nobody else wants to call.

2156
02:35:44,260 --> 02:35:47,723
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or use name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2157
02:35:47,803 --> 02:35:54,729
[SPEAKER_06]: She'll also pimp out my independent documentary about whacking days, also called Man vs. Snake.

2158
02:35:57,531 --> 02:35:58,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the sad trombone, Rob?

2159
02:35:59,893 --> 02:36:01,214
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not playing it after that.

2160
02:36:01,254 --> 02:36:01,755
[SPEAKER_08]: That was funny.

2161
02:36:02,075 --> 02:36:03,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Womp, womp.

2162
02:36:05,789 --> 02:36:09,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Man vs. Snake And there's our dick joke of the night

2163
02:36:24,025 --> 02:36:24,505
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

2164
02:36:48,681 --> 02:36:49,241
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not true.

2165
02:36:49,582 --> 02:36:51,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because she may have missed that up.

2166
02:36:52,003 --> 02:36:55,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I do hold the title of biggest perv on the show.

2167
02:36:56,246 --> 02:36:57,226
[SPEAKER_08]: We won't challenge you for that.

2168
02:36:57,346 --> 02:37:00,468
[SPEAKER_08]: That's only because your wife isn't here because then she would be the biggest perv on the show.

2169
02:37:01,509 --> 02:37:03,270
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about that.

2170
02:37:04,170 --> 02:37:06,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Nellie is just the queen of the off-color remark.

2171
02:37:07,192 --> 02:37:07,832
[SPEAKER_08]: She's great, though.

2172
02:37:07,872 --> 02:37:09,053
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to get her on the show sometime.

2173
02:37:09,073 --> 02:37:09,754
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to have Nellie on the show.

2174
02:37:09,774 --> 02:37:11,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though I know she hates the show, we've got to get her on it sometime.

2175
02:37:12,415 --> 02:37:12,695
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2176
02:37:13,516 --> 02:37:15,438
[SPEAKER_08]: That does it for another episode of Orange Sound Radio.

2177
02:37:15,478 --> 02:37:20,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys so much for joining us and inviting us into your life after our week off.

2178
02:37:20,844 --> 02:37:21,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Hope we entertained you tonight.

2179
02:37:22,185 --> 02:37:24,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry I was sick for most of it, but blame DragonCon.

2180
02:37:27,270 --> 02:37:28,872
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back to do it all again next week.

2181
02:37:29,032 --> 02:37:32,075
[SPEAKER_08]: If you like what you heard, remember, we don't ask for your money to do this show.

2182
02:37:32,715 --> 02:37:57,511
[SPEAKER_08]: so just help us spread the word tell a friend or two or five about the show we really appreciate all the thumbs up on Stitcher the five star reviews on iTunes we haven't got any in a long time so if you haven't left us a five star review on iTunes we really appreciate it and helping to spread the word what more can we say thanks for the support and it motivates us to get our family to grow and get more input and do more shows for you guys

2183
02:37:58,231 --> 02:38:01,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we say goodnight, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

2184
02:38:02,355 --> 02:38:09,081
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is Alan really needs to charge his Kindle because this thing has been sitting on the dead battery screen for like two weeks.

2185
02:38:09,401 --> 02:38:13,084
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm impressed at how long this thing can sit on a dead battery screen with no battery.

2186
02:38:14,826 --> 02:38:15,927
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2187
02:38:23,007 --> 02:38:23,467
[SPEAKER_08]: and Loki.

2188
02:38:23,527 --> 02:38:24,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Last but not least, your final thought.

2189
02:38:28,290 --> 02:38:29,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully Grand Theft Auto this week.

2190
02:38:30,572 --> 02:38:31,072
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

2191
02:38:32,073 --> 02:38:34,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Could we get an early review of Grand Theft Auto 5 next week?

2192
02:38:34,935 --> 02:38:35,575
[SPEAKER_08]: We will see.

2193
02:38:36,216 --> 02:38:36,236
[SPEAKER_08]: A+.

2194
02:38:39,858 --> 02:38:42,221
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, Bobby's giving a C+.

2195
02:38:43,763 --> 02:38:45,205
[SPEAKER_08]: No one's bitter, I guess.

2196
02:38:45,585 --> 02:38:47,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, tune in to find out.

2197
02:38:47,828 --> 02:38:49,670
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back in seven days to do it all again.

2198
02:38:49,751 --> 02:38:50,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a great week, everybody.

2199
02:38:50,732 --> 02:38:51,012
