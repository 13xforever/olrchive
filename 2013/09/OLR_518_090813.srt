Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, one of Mega Man's creators successfully kickstarts a spiritual successor, a classic fighting game becomes a MOBA, now he announces a new rhythm game with Capcom, and could Sony release a VR headset for the PS4?

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, it is the show where every gamer has a voice, here we are, episode number 518 for this September the 8th 2013, I hope you guys all had a good week off, Labor Day week, we weren't here last week, but we're back to do it all again tonight, talk about video games and gaming culture and have some laughs

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts, first off the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm in your town raiding your fruits

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes you are, you are definitely helping out with Animal Crossing, are you impressed though that I actually, I went in when I was flying to Atlanta and cleaned up the whole town, I found that Animal Crossing is a great flight game

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It is, it's also a great, I have nothing to do so I'm going to play Animal Crossing for 3 hours type of game and the cat won't get off of me, I'm going to play Animal Crossing

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah usually while I'm here at home I'll end up getting sucked into an MMO or kind of sitting on the chair, I mean my 3DS is really the on the go system, that's when I play it the most, but yeah having the flight this week there and back to Dragon Con got a lot of Animal Crossing in among other things

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Well you also were my 10th Wii person, or me, that popped up on my thing so you got me an achievement

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Woohoo, or what do they call them on Nintendo, accomplishments, trophies?

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
They're called what the hell ever I call them

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Whatever they want to be

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
They're called stuff and things

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Alright and also joining us tonight being whoever he wants to be, say hello to Techmaster Loki

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't know I got nothing

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's so after school inspirational of you

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It is a little bit isn't it, how are you Loki?

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm fine

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Counting down the days until Grand Theft Auto?

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Sort of, yeah I guess, just waiting for the leak

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Which I'm sure it will soon enough

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Well Rockstar's not shipping anything out, well they're not shipping anything out to distribution until Friday so probably next weekend I'm sure

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't know if I'll be getting mine early because the powers that be above me are kind of being anal

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm still going to do it but we'll see, I may be slapped on the wrist for that

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Is it like the guy who put up the YouTube today of the Xbox One

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Well see I'm not that dumb

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Are they worried about early leaks and things like that?

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:06,000
They're just worried about like because they're requiring manifests of like the orders that go out and stuff just to make sure that no one's getting their product on Friday or whatever

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No stores, I mean I'm not a store, I'm not going to resell but I understand

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I thought I already saw on Reddit or one of those sites that somebody's got the game and the disc

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You saw Photoshop and it was from

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Well that was a good Photoshop

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Gamertag Radio posted that on Twitter

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But yeah it was a Photoshop of somebody they did that

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah there's no actual copies of the game out there yet

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I mean yeah no there are, there are shippers that are out there, like full pallet shippers

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But those are like intended for like think Target, Walmart and stuff

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So those are out there and someone did break in the one of those to take a picture on, I saw that on Reddit

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But aside from that I don't think any copies have mysteriously vanished from those yet

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So the retail release though is the Tuesday after this Tuesday right? Next Tuesday? 17th?

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
17th yeah

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This week is Kingdom Hearts HD, I just got my pre-order in for that today so

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Kingdom Hearts and Puppeteer and NHL

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So we're getting into that time of year, it's going to start ramping up with Kingdom Hearts and Grand Theft Auto

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Those are definitely two big things to kick off this season right?

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah and Kingdom Hearts is just an HD compilation

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Well but Kingdom Hearts is like, I don't know like I'm really liking this whole square going back to some of the PS2 games

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And kind of making bigger and better and all that, I like that idea

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I mean it's kind of cool and all but I think it's going to be more interesting to see in Kingdom Hearts 3 and Final Fantasy 15

52
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So I want to talk, gosh there's a lot to catch up on since we were gone last week

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't even know where to begin

54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm sick a little bit again which kind of sucks, I got Complague yet again from Dragon Con

55
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't even know how that happens but there you go

56
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
We should probably talk about some of the things that happened last week in gaming news

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Because it's only a three hour show so we don't have time to talk all about last week and this week

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So we want to do a segment we call Last Week's News Set to Holic

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Lots of Nintendo news in the week that we were gone

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The Wii U Deluxe finally got that price drop a lot of people have been talking about

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Down to $2.99 for the Wii U Deluxe which is what the Wii U Basic costs right now

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Also out of Nintendo

63
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Wii U Basic isn't being sold anymore by the way

64
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah so kind of interesting that they just basically are giving away Nintendo Land and some extra plastic for free

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The Nintendo 2DS was announced which had a lot of people have some very strong opinions about the 2DS one way or another

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Or the Nintendo Toast is kind of what it looks like but it is definitely targeted towards the younger set

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Seriously missed opportunity with that I think

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It does not fold and it only displays images in 2D apparently it uses one screen that's separated by the plastic in order to pull it off

69
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But it is aimed at five and six year olds per Reggie

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Zelda Link Between Worlds got a release date November 22nd is the big day

71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Wonderful 101 sales figures not as good as it had hoped but I think it might be a little early to tell with that

72
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's because it's on the Wii U

73
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It also hasn't released over here yet

74
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It comes out on the 15th one week from today

75
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But that is the news out of Japan so there you go

76
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Let's see I guess something else we could talk about there

77
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
How about WayForward's Kickstarter of Shantate Half Genie Hero for Wii U

78
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's the thing that's happening on Kickstarter from WayForward

79
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's last week's news set to Holic

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Most of the big stuff obviously around Nintendo

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Loki did you want to elaborate on the 2DS real quick?

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Well the thing you know you mentioned that it's one screen with a piece of plastic in between

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And I saw some people you know on Ars Technica and stuff they were showing like

84
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Here's what we think that this should have looked like instead being like a whole tablet

85
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Like basically just remove that plastic and leave just like kind of a barrier there

86
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And have it where maybe you can have some new software that's supported by the 2DS

87
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You know have 2DS software that supports the whole like almost like a whole tablet instead of two screens

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Well I don't know I'm just trying not to overthink this because you'll notice it was very intentional

89
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Nintendo did not roll this out at E3 they did not even do a direct for it

90
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's not a big deal

91
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But here's the thing is the thought is that this is where it's going to go for the next handheld system

92
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That it will be a tablet with one screen because this is what they did with the Game Boy Advance SP

93
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Where you have that hinge in the foldable screen and then that later showed up in the Nintendo DS

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That might be reading into it a lot I don't know about that

95
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And this is also Nintendo like trying to I mean if you think about it

96
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Nintendo the last time they did something really crazy with their hardware aside from the 3DS

97
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Being in 3D was the Wii and since then they haven't really done too much

98
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I think it's kind of once again the 2DS is confusing I think to consumers

99
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's just the name itself is going to confuse people because they're going to be like well

100
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
2DS so I don't see any 2DS games I can buy for this you know I only see 3DS games

101
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I just don't think they're going to get it and also you're saying that there's a market out there

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Of people that have 5 and 6 year olds that actually read the small little print that's on those boxes

103
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Saying that they don't recommend 3D for

104
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Because I don't think it necessarily is only 5 and 6 year olds I think it's other young children

105
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Where the parents are like oh this is a little too close

106
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You know like even though it's for 7 and up

107
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But they'll read that small print but they won't read the ESRB ratings on the back of the boxes of these games

108
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So I like that and the print that's larger fuck that can't read it

109
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Oh small print that's you know something that doesn't really possibly affect my kids eyes

110
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Well we'll read that and be scared of it

111
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I just think the 2DS is kind of a non-factor as far as we're all concerned

112
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You know it's like that Wii that they released in Canada that didn't even have any internet functionality or what have you

113
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Like remember that? It was released with little fanfare

114
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
They did that with the PSP as well they had one with no Wi-Fi and stuff or something

115
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Whatever

116
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's no big deal but I just think it's kind of weird you know why would you invest money into such a narrow demographic?

117
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Well actually I'm glad you know if Nintendo is doing this new thing every year

118
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm glad that this system is a step backwards in some ways and not a step forward

119
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Because I'd be kind of irritated if I had a new 3DS I'd want to buy

120
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You know so I'm kind of glad we have a year off from all this stuff and maybe there'll be a 3DS Uber or who knows what

121
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
2DS has Excel

122
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I doubt it I doubt it

123
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Alright well our chat room is lighting up and I do want to acknowledge our live chatters because we do tape live every Sunday night

124
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network

125
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
vognetwork.com and if you, excuse me, I still have hiccups and other horrible radio things from being sick from the comm plague I got at Dragon Con

126
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
If you do join us live for a live show don't forget to join our chat room live.vognetwork.com

127
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I hope I make it through the show

128
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Where we have comments like Tiger Claw says that 2DS is going to screw up a lot of kids Christmas

129
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't know if I see the logic in that why would that screw up a kids Christmas?

130
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That's actually perfect because I was, Julian has started to read

131
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He's six years old he's in first grade he's reading

132
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
He's been reading me play Animal Crossing which I've been trying not to get him to repeat Pork Sword

133
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Thank you to Queen Semia in chat for that

134
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah his mom was slightly amused by that but anyway he actually is reading the game with me when I play it when I'm over there

135
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And he was talking about wanting a 3DS so he could play Animal Crossing himself

136
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And actually I think that the 2DS is actually a good idea for him because I've seen how he destroys his stuff

137
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah and there's no hinges to break on the 2DS but it's also too big to fit in the pockets but I think that actually might be a good thing

138
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You don't want a six year old fitting that stuff in their pockets and taking it to school

139
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You don't want those portable systems to be portable

140
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm worried I'm going to get accused of being a Nintendo defendist or whatever but I just don't think this system is as big of a deal as Twitter made it seem to be this week

141
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Well I'm glad that they decided that fuck it we can't create a hinge that actually won't break very easily so we're just going to make a system that's super weird looking

142
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Let's see DC Nate in chat says iPads don't fit in pockets either and they sell just fine

143
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So talking about that maybe that type of affordability isn't necessarily a deal breaker

144
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I understand that but who's having their kids bring iPads to fucking school?

145
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Well it's huge in college

146
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Okay yeah that's college but five and six year olds where this is actually targeted are you really going to spend that kind of money on it?

147
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Well Dan's 12 year old cousin not Dan's I think it was like one of Becky or Chris's relatives got a 12 year old iPhone 5

148
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What 12 year old needs that?

149
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But it's a 12 year old I'm talking about a little kid that has a goddamn iPad

150
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I mean here's the thing is you're talking to kids again and once again the main thing was 3D they don't really like the 3D because parents are concerned that they don't understand how to use a switch which is ridiculous

151
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Well and you can actually turn off 3D and parental settings on the 3DS today

152
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Exactly parental settings well they'll read the small print there but they won't read the manual so whatever okay so they're confused by the switch and stuff and oh that hinge is gonna break

153
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What do you think the 2DS is gonna what do you think is gonna happen the 2DS the kids gonna drop on the ground and oh look both of those fucking screens are scratched now

154
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Congratulations

155
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I just think this is if you don't like it don't buy it and this isn't gonna break Nintendo's bank if this thing flops because I really don't think they're making that many of them

156
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Well I guess they don't care if another system flops now don't they?

157
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Well it's again they did not have the fanfare with E3 or even a Nintendo Direct or anything this was on a press release under the radar I don't think they have an expectation

158
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Here's what it is they're just trying to put out another system to drive some more sales because Pokemans is coming out right around the corner and they have to make up for the losses of the Wii U

159
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Because the Wii U let's be honest Wind Waker HD I love Wind Waker it's not gonna fucking pull that system out

160
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Mario Kart 8 is really I know there's the Mario game as well but I think the combo of that and Mario Kart 8 is gonna be that's gonna be and if another price drop can squeeze in when Mario Kart 8 comes out that will really seal the deal

161
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And I'm talking even if they can drop it just like 20 bucks I think that would be huge we'll see I mean we got a ways so alright anyhow last weeks news done over with

162
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Damn it Kabuki needs to move to my town

163
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
One of your villagers moved to my town

164
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah I went by and saw a butch that traitor I'm gonna steal Kabuki

165
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I was really surprised because I was like oh he came from Normandy oh that's Jamie's town oh she's gonna be pissed because this isn't the one she was trying to lose

166
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
No I want to lose Ed and I'm glad I'm not the only one that has to share the pain that Ed is

167
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
There she is playing her Nintendo system compulsively during the show

168
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Hey you're the one that said you'd open your village

169
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Alright anyhow I want to talk quickly about Dragon Con because I had a great time at Dragon Con I want to say hi to anybody new listening to the show who I might have networked with at Dragon Con

170
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I got pulled onto a panel Monday morning at the last minute about streaming media and I got to talk kind of about the live 365 days and everything from that to like the modern Twitch TV

171
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And I had a lot of fun so I just want to say hey to anybody who I might have met doing that or the VOG Network Super Show panel which sadly didn't have the greatest turnout live

172
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But what's interesting is that apparently it had a great turnout online and we're getting good download numbers for it so it's I guess just a lot of you couldn't make it to Dragon Con in person

173
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:03,000
But I hope you enjoyed that show we had a lot of fun doing it and it sounds like we're going to be doing it again next year so I'm making my plans to go to Dragon Con 2014

174
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But I had a wonderful time at Dragon Con I'm going to be honest the first couple days I was a little bit overwhelmed lots of people tried to get used to it I was jet lagged so I was a little crabby

175
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But by the time Saturday night Sunday Monday I was really into it and the amount of talent I saw with the cosplay just really blew my mind and there's something special about Dragon Con because it doesn't really take place in a convention center

176
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Well I mean like the dealer hall is there but it's across like five downtown hotels so just these

177
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Sounds very AX

178
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Well I've never been AX

179
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
A lot of AX shows spread across a convention center and three hotels

180
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
At least it was last time I went

181
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:57,000
But like oh my gosh just like the main floor of the Marriott just wall to wall people and then you go downstairs there's like multi level and there's these different ballrooms where there's artist alley and a room where you can walk up and meet celebrities and a board game room in the basement

182
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I think that was at the Hilton had a board game area in the basement that was huge and that's the one that had the mech systems that Bobby's talked about on his show before

183
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And you could lose track of time in there easy no windows to the outside because it's in the basement

184
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And I can see how people can get stuck in there playing the wolf game or werewolf or whatever you call it till eight in the morning

185
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Which by the way was the first time I ever saw that being played live

186
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I played it online on DDR Freak back in the day but getting to see that playing live was a lot of fun

187
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:37,000
So lots of panels I really like how Dragon Con separates things into tracks and it's like okay Hilton 203 is going to be nothing but podcasts unless we get a really really big thing that might be one of the other rooms

188
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And they had an MMO track and a video game track the one thing I was a little less impressed with was the digital gaming room sorry I know some people work hard to put that on

189
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But just it's not I mean to be fair Dragon Con is not a video game expo it's not PAX it's not a video game show so that wasn't supposed to be their main draw

190
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But barely any console stuff to be seen it was very PC and you know there was a Smash Brothers tournament going on but that was about it

191
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Like if it wasn't a tournament or some PC play that's really about it but lots of 3DS street passing to be had that's for sure

192
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So yeah I don't know what else to say about Dragon Con I had a great time it was great to just meet people that I've worked with for many years

193
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Finally getting to meet Brad from Pod Culture and some of his cohorts and they were very generous in getting me very drunk very quickly so thank you for that

194
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And meeting some of Bobby's friends these are people like I've heard about but haven't really met and one of his friends Sue and I hit it off really well I just love her to bits

195
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And she was giving out vodka soaked gummy bears all weekend so love her

196
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I want to go next year Rob

197
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You really should and some folks in the chat room are talking about there should be a vod con seriously and SSG100Matt says Dragon Con might be the closest thing to vod con

198
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I mean honestly in a way kinda because putting on a con is really hard piggy backing on someone else's con is much easier

199
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Especially a huge con like Dragon Con just be prepared for tons and tons of people

200
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Getting to see Travis you realize it's been like 10 years since I've seen Travis so getting to be there with him when he was doing his cosplay

201
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:24,000
He did an amazing job as Commander Shepard and if you guys haven't heard him and his wife Jenna Mark Meir the voice of Mael Shep renewed their vows one of the mornings

202
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm very pressed because it was a surprise so I wasn't told it was going to happen so I didn't go

203
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Were you all the clumps for not going?

204
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I was a little bit like you did what? Why wasn't I told I would have got up I would have forced myself out of bed

205
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Oh well I had a great time

206
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yeah so I'm already planning to go back next year and I feel bad for PAX Prime

207
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Apparently there was plenty of fuckery that happened in one of the panels I don't really want to get into that controversial issue right now because I'm sure you've all read about it

208
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I love fuckery panels those are the best to watch

209
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Well all I'm saying is that you know Penny Arcade Expo I love the vibe of Penny Arcade Expo and I still do kind of want to go to Penny Arcade East but

210
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Some people there really need some PR help big time and just

211
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Some people there need to get their foot out of their mouth

212
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And it seems to be perpetual is the problem I'm starting to have it's like every time you think they're doing they're on the right path it's just whoop foot goes right back and mouth

213
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And it's like you guys are there's a lot of good things that those guys do but then it's like you know how long are we going to sit here and just like kind of turn the other way

214
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
When there's one of them won't stop with this running his mouth anyway

215
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Rob next year if I can make it to DragonCon by the way we need to cosplay

216
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm already talking about cosplay with Travis too but I would be down I mean there's like four days of cons that's four cosplays

217
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I've actually already been working on my costume for one of the SAC anime next year so

218
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I would like to consider going to PAX East just throwing that out there I still would like to try and make that happen we'll see I just it's money at this point you guys cons be expensive

219
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And then they just announced gamer X2 is going to be earlier next year it's going to be Alan's birthday weekend in mid July so there's that con to look forward to as well

220
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:26,000
What else did I want to say about DragonCon? I don't know I think I said do you guys have questions or anybody in chat?

221
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Who did you notice any of the sci-fi or fantasy writers who were guests that year? I didn't see

222
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I didn't really do celebrity sightings I didn't even go to see Kathy Najimy which was the one celebrity I really wanted to see I kind of just skipped all that

223
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I know Travis ran into George Takei the lucky fucker

224
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I would have totally wanted to see was it the guys from Mythbusters are over there

225
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,000
They did a whole special show at the Fox Theater one night they did like a special live show and then they did like a panel yeah it was a good time

226
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Oh Bobby's mentioning the Parsec Awards yes that was a lot of fun we got to present at this prestigious award they do for speculative fiction casts at DragonCon

227
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And you can actually see the YouTube online and myself, Bobby and Travis presenting at the awards and Brad is in it too he did an award earlier in the presentation so lots of VOG

228
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:24,000
But what's funny is that because of a schedule shuffle where Sylvester McCoy the seventh doctor was supposed to present the last award well he had to do the first award instead

229
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So guess who got to do the very last award of the evening? VOG got to present that award so we had a whole little spiel we made up like 30 minutes before the thing

230
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And that went pretty well I had an Oprah moment up on stage and pretended to be drunk I was not really drunk

231
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You gave everyone B's? Huh? You gave everyone B's? No I said something along the lines of I wish everybody could have an award because all the indie podcasters worked so hard

232
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And if I were Oprah I'd say you get an award and you get an award and I think I actually danced so you can see me all jiggling up there on stage

233
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm leaving your village now. Bye bye. I've already looted it. Get out. Alright I think that's all I want to say on DragonCon because I know we have a lot of gaming news and other stuff we want to get into

234
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Good time, WoodCon again. A++. Let's get into our gaming weeks I suppose it's time for. I'm a little off after having a week off. Let's talk about our gaming weeks. What have you been playing this week? Dark Sakura?

235
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Animal Crossing. And I wanted to play Final Fantasy 14 but apparently my account was rendered inactive so when I went to go register my collector's edition code it created another account

236
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So now I have two accounts. One of them with no characters and the other one with my characters on it that I can't access. So I've opened a ticket. I'm calling Square tomorrow. Hopefully get everything fixed

237
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:51,000
But man they don't have their phone number anywhere on their site and I had to go look at that locate customer service website so I've got that

238
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I played some more Fractal. I'm super addicted to that game. I actually started DuckTales. And yeah that's about it. I mean I've really had a lot on my plate. I had a job interview.

239
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Oh no I played something else. I don't remember what it is so it's not important. Your turn.

240
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Alright well this week I didn't play a whole ton. I did a little bit of catching up. Well this is even kind of including last week a little bit. Saints Row IV so I finished playing that kind of

241
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I mean I'm still, what was it? Last night I spent a good while modding the files in there to try to unlock DLC without paying for it. But that didn't work.

242
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So I was trying to then unlock weapons that were not really weapons that you can use but they're weapons that are in the game kind of like some of the enemies have in some of the flashback missions and stuff

243
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But I didn't get that to work. And then I was playing a little bit of Grand Theft Auto IV just because I'd watch somebody do or attempt to do this like kind of six star run from one side of the map to the other.

244
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And I probably could do it but I could probably only do it in multiplayer because in single player you have limited sprinting. You don't have unlimited sprint and your characters run about as good as I do.

245
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And just they run out of steam just after a few feet of sprinting so that just didn't work. Plus the AI is really cheap. I mean you jump into the water there's no boats and then like two seconds later all of a sudden there's five boats and they've run over you.

246
00:24:36,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Multiple times like where those boats just teleport from. They weren't here a second ago. So yeah I didn't really end up doing that. So I ended up instead filming some of my I don't know if I want to call parkour but like like free climbing I guess it's something I used to do in multiplayer because I got tired of beating everybody so badly in our multiplayer games at work.

247
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And so I used to climb buildings and still kill them. So I filmed some of those buildings and things that you know I used to climb on and I thought it'd be fun to edit it together and do some more stuff.

248
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So I did that and then a little bit of Call of Duty at work but I'm getting really bored with it because I've handicapped myself quite a bit and I still keep winning so I just I don't know what I can.

249
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And we can't really play live anymore because our Internet connection is just shit. So yeah. And then also it's just my boss. I'm usually is playing my boss and pot sometimes our IT guy but it's just getting so boring.

250
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It's what happens when they lay off all your friends you know. So bummer. Wow. All the people they used to play with. So what are you gonna do. That's it. Stock them.

251
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:06,000
All right. My gaming week. You know because I was at a con for several days I didn't get to play a lot of new stuff at the con but except for one thing I'll talk about at the end.

252
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:16,000
But I did come home I played quite an obscene amount of Final Fantasy 14. But I know we've talked about it to death on this show and there's really not a lot more I can say.

253
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I got White Mage. I did play a couple new games on PlayStation 3. I played Castle of Illusion the HD remake or whatever that came out. Did they change a lot in that game or is it just me because there's like things in it.

254
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm like wait a minute. This wasn't here before. They were saying and I was watching an interview with the creator and also the original designer and the new people and they're talking about how they actually did make some changes to make it more of a Disney film like.

255
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:56,000
OK. So well then there's like a very Mario 64 vibe in the beginning with the castle and everything I'm like I don't remember. It's been so long. It's been so long. It's just an illusion that it's different. Shut up.

256
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:10,000
But I haven't really played enough of it to give you a really firm opinion on it but definitely you know has that feel of the Genesis classic and you know I think if you enjoyed the Genesis version of you probably already bought this.

257
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:20,000
One game I spent a little more time playing was a music game on PlayStation 3 called Kickbeat. I don't know if you guys have heard of this. It's a music game which I haven't got to play a lot of those lately.

258
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Although I also played the demo for Hatsune Miku Project Diva F and I won it. Like that was actually a lot of fun. It reminded me of a PlayStation 2 music game. The price is what's scaring me on that game. I'm like $50 for Hatsune Miku really.

259
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:53,000
That's too much money. But Kickbeat is more like $10 or $15. I think it was $15 as a download title. And essentially it's set up like it's a little karate thing but your buttons like X and square and circle are all laid out as up down left and right as they are on the pad.

260
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And these little ninja dudes will come out onto the spot and that's when you kick them. And so like you'll be playing along to the music and you know you'll see a little ninja come out and you hit the button and it kills them.

261
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:12,000
But you have a little bit of warning. So it's just like a different way of reading instead of notes scrolling down the screen. It's little ninjas sending themselves into position.

262
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And depending on the shirts they wear tell you kind of like when the beats are. So like if it's a yellow it's on the beat. If it's blue then you're going to have half beats or third beats.

263
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
But sometimes you have red ones which means it's two buttons at the same time. And sometimes you have like I think it's like orangey where it's like a hold.

264
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It's a very different way of doing a music game and it's pretty cool to watch your guy like do all the karate moves as he's doing it.

265
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Does he duck turn?

266
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:49,000
He's not as fabulous as Parappa was. I'm going to tell you what else is as fabulous as Parappa was. This is completely a matter of opinion and some of you are going to disagree with me strongly on this.

267
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I don't like the song list in the game at all. It's a lot of hard rock music. Some of you would like Pendulum and you know those were the songs that bothered me the least probably in the game.

268
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:06,000
But like one of them is a remix. What were the huge Pendulum songs? Colors? Was that their song?

269
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Colors yeah.

270
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
That's not in there. It's other stuff.

271
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It's probably Slam or I'm trying to think of the other one.

272
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:24,000
But it's just stuff I don't really listen to in my normal life. I liked my techno DDR stuff and all that.

273
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:31,000
But there are people that like that music that will be very excited about this game that it incorporates that into it.

274
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And apparently if you beat the game once you can import your own music into it. I'm not sure how well that's going to work because it doesn't always work very well those algorithms.

275
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
But I'd like to try it. I'm trying to play through the game one time so I can at least try it.

276
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But you know for 15 bucks you could do a lot worse. If you like music games especially if you like hard rock, metal and things like that you'd probably get a kick out of it.

277
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
So check it out.

278
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Akuma JP in chat says is sexy and I know it in there. Very much no. Unless you play it as your own mp3.

279
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Marilyn Manson's The Beautiful People is in it. That was one song I recognized.

280
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:19,000
What's that? Boom. Don't ask me to sing these songs. It's terrible. What is that band P.O.D. Is that their name? That song's in there.

281
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Well you know that actually that song a remix of that song was in Amplitude.

282
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Oh that's true. That is true. Alright well anyway so that's kick beat.

283
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And between that and Final Fantasy is pretty much all I did you know because I was gone for a week.

284
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:44,000
However at Dragon Con Bobby was good enough to bring his Oculus Rift after all. He threatened not to bring it because we were all going to be too drunk to play it.

285
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
That's the perfect time to play it.

286
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Well I can understand because it's a very expensive piece of hardware and you know he doesn't want us flinging around.

287
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It's over your eyes not your mouth. If you vomit it's going to miss it.

288
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Well he didn't bring Slender Man either so I didn't get to do the scary game. From what I understand Slender Man's on injection drivers. It's more of a hack anyway.

289
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:13,000
He did YouTube me playing it for the first time. Some type of roller coaster demo that we were doing where the roller coaster like the track just ends up missing at one part so your car goes flying.

290
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I will say this. It's an impressive piece of technology. I was very impressed with it.

291
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And it is exactly what you think it is. If you haven't heard of Oculus Rift it's a headset. You put it on your head. It ties to the PC right now.

292
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And what you see is you see full 3D out the goggles but as you turn your head your field of vision moves.

293
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,000
So when you look up, you look up. When you look down, you look down. So as you imagine the games have to kind of support this technology.

294
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
So right now it's a lot of demos and concept things and that's really what I looked at.

295
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And one of the things I looked at was a very Myst style type of game where you were walking around these different ramps.

296
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And you can use an Xbox 360 controller to walk. That's how you move forward and things like that. The looking is different.

297
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And you can go in these rooms and you can flip the stage upside down so you kind of have that sensation of flipping upside down while you're doing it.

298
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And that was a really cool little demo to do. Now Bobby did do some injection drivers so we could do some fun stuff.

299
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Like he had a Super Nintendo emulator thing so we could play Mario Kart with the Oculus Rift which basically looked like this big theater.

300
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:30,000
But as you looked, it was really detailed. Like if you look down, you see a little shadow holding a controller playing the game.

301
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
If you look up, you see a projector on the ceiling that actually is projecting the actual image you see in front of you.

302
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
So I thought that was a very immersive cool thing. But here was the really cool one.

303
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:52,000
He had a GameCube emulator with F-Zero GX. So I got to play F-Zero GX on the Rift and I'll tell you the first time I went around a loop, that was quite the sensation.

304
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
That was something else. Because you know, imagine you put this thing on, you have headphones on, it's a trip.

305
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,000
So yeah, it's something you have to experience. I can't explain it to you but I will tell you it's a pretty impressive piece of technology.

306
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It works. The one thing I could say about it is that it's low resolution but it's supposed to be because it's a dev kit.

307
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Right now it's a dev kit. And if I looked really closely, I could actually see the little pieces of glass or whatever that make up the RGB or whatever it is.

308
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,000
You know how if you sit up really close to an old television, you can see the little pieces of color that make up the big picture?

309
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
You can kind of see that in the Rift a little bit.

310
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Like the RGB artificing, right?

311
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Exactly, yeah. But again, I'm being super nitpicky. The sensation of being able to look around and having it move with you in real time is pretty cool.

312
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And the 3D is done very well.

313
00:33:47,000 --> 00:34:00,000
The last time I played a VR game, it was at Santa Cruz the Boardwalk and it was Quake 1 and I think Duke Nukem 3D.

314
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:08,000
But we played two deathmatches in that game. Yeah, that was kind of derpy because it's Quake.

315
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:16,000
You can imagine those screens were very low resolution. It's like having two TVs in front of your eyes. But it was fun.

316
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Well, apparently on the PC while you have the headset on, Bobby could see what I was doing because it shows you on the PC it just splits the screen in left and right.

317
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Like what's going on in the left eye and what's going on in the right eye. So he could see everything I was doing in the Rift, which is cool.

318
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Let's see, Black Wolf is in chat right now. Our good pal Bobby Black Wolf who tapes before us at Voice of the Geeks Network says,

319
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
The Gallery Airworld demo was the name of the Myst thing I was playing. It was pretty cool.

320
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So there was another demo that involved a house, but there was like all you did is you walked in.

321
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:53,000
You know what it really reminded me of? It was the modern version of, remember all those old virtual reality demos back in the mid 90s?

322
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I remember there was this old one where you walked around the neighborhood with a car.

323
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
They should totally have that for the Oculus Rift. Like the old 90s virtual reality demos.

324
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
They probably do. Bobby didn't show me everything. He didn't have time.

325
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You know what? It just keeps popping into my head over and over with Oculus Rift.

326
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
The Lawnmower Man? Yes! I was thinking of, yes.

327
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Well the movie, the book had nothing to do with it.

328
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Now is the time to bring back the Lawnmower Man game or something. It would be kind of fun.

329
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
So again, Oculus Rift is one of those things you just have to try it for yourself.

330
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Not even a TV show could explain it to you because you have to have it on your head and try it yourself.

331
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I will say this too. One other thing.

332
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
That means you have to give it head?

333
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Well here's the thing DarkSakura. You'd hate it because your motion sickness, I couldn't play it for more than 20 minutes before I was like, okay I need to take this thing off.

334
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I was getting motion sick playing Borderlands 2.

335
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And that's this device's biggest weakness. I can't possibly see how somebody can have a two hour marathon gaming session with this thing.

336
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You might get used to it or something, but I just, I really worry about the effect it may have on people.

337
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I mean, here we are talking about earlier in the show Nintendo putting out a TV system.

338
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
He had porn. He did not share porn with you.

339
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
He didn't show me the porn!

340
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
That is not. That is not.

341
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
He's making me come back next year. That's what it is. It's a big ploy to get me to come back next year.

342
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
That is just downright.

343
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I could have seen boobies on Oculus Rift.

344
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
That is very rude that you don't share porn with your guests.

345
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Very rude. Bobby. Alright. Well anyway, I guess it gives me a reason to go back next year.

346
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
But anyway, the sickness thing though, that's a legit concern I would have.

347
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I'm really curious to see like what are the long term effects this thing has?

348
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Like what do the warnings on this thing look like? What do doctors think about it?

349
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Because they are legitimate concerns.

350
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
There's bound to be epilepsy concerns.

351
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Long term effects, you may be immersed into the 3D world and may become a cybernetic being that will then try to take over the whole electric infrastructure and internet.

352
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
This is the start of the Matrix.

353
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
This is the start of the Matrix.

354
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
A la Lawn Mower Man.

355
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
It is. Remember when you get killed in the Matrix, you get killed in real life just because of the sensations or whatever?

356
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:15,000
When you are going over this loop in F-Zero, I felt it a little bit. It wasn't the same as riding a roller coaster.

357
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
There was. I don't know if Bobby has seen it yet. I'm sure he has. I think you may have seen it from him.

358
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:30,000
But they have a, it was a game made in unity, a Tron light cycle demo with the Oculus Rift.

359
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Bobby. Bobby Black Wolf is defending his choices in chat saying Rob wanted to go drink before I got to the porn.

360
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Well that is probably accurate.

361
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I think Booze Over Porn is.

362
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
To be fair that is probably accurate.

363
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
And besides that, porn is just really bad comedy.

364
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Alright so yes, I tried the Oculus Rift people. Not that I'm going to say you have that kind of money to buy one.

365
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
But I'm sure these demos are going to start to get out there more and more, add other expos and so forth.

366
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It was something you have to experience for yourself.

367
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
It very well could be the future of gaming as we'll get into in gaming news here in a minute.

368
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
But first, some quick housekeeping before we get into tonight's gaming news.

369
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Please follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r. You can also follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

370
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
We do have a quick housekeeping note here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

371
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Something that we did announce at our DragonCon panel on Saturday was that a new show is joining the Voice of Geeks Network Radio.

372
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Yay! And very happy to have this show on board with us.

373
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,000
The show is Electric Sistahood and it's going to be debuting Tuesdays at, I always get screwed up by time zones.

374
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Tuesdays at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern.

375
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
And this is really cool because it's going to lead right into Anime Jam Sessions pre-show and their live shows.

376
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Now we have a Tuesday block. We have a Monday block, a Wednesday block, and a Tuesday block now.

377
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Instead of just one show on Tuesdays. So it's pretty nice.

378
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Have we gone up a level?

379
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
We have leveled up. And I really like that Electric Sistahood is very much a girl power show.

380
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
You know, it's fronted by two sisters who live out of Boston.

381
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And I love, you know, obviously they have guys that they work with too.

382
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
There's the Boston Bastard Brigade, some of them that we met at E3 and so forth.

383
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And they do a lot with EGM now and so forth.

384
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
But I just, I love that we are diversifying things more here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

385
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I mean we already had a great female fronted show in Girls Gone Wow.

386
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And lots of strong women voices on the network with you and Christina and Jessica and Patty and, you know, everybody.

387
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
So, sorry if I'm, I know I'm leaving people out.

388
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
But yeah, I am loving what we're doing here at VOG.

389
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
We embrace diversity.

390
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
That is right.

391
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
We play Genesis and Super Nintendo and Turbo Graphics.

392
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And once in a while you may catch us off the air listening to Sonic US and Japanese soundtracks.

393
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
No. No. That doesn't happen.

394
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Alright. Rama's in chat.

395
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
That only happens when I hook up the Sega CD.

396
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Rama's in chat very excited saying East Coast run Tuesday nights on VOG Network.

397
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Yes, I guess that is true. It is an East Coast night Tuesday nights here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

398
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:19,000
If you have a geek-centered show or you know someone that produces a geek-centered show that you think would be a good fit for the Voice of Geeks Network,

399
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
we are looking to add to our family even more.

400
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
You can get in touch with me, Rob, at VOGNetwork.com.

401
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:31,000
All we ask is that it be an established show because we want to make sure that the people are dedicated to their craft

402
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
because so many podcasts do fizzle in the first few weeks, unfortunately.

403
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So we want to make sure that it's already established that the folks are dedicated.

404
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And we are a little filled up on video game shows at this point.

405
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Electric Sisterhood also focuses on video games, although they also do tech and anime, so they're a little bit that.

406
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
So if your show is primarily video games, that might be a bit too much for the network right now.

407
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
But we have big-time openings for board games as a show I want real bad.

408
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
We don't have anything on comics, and I'd love to get a comic-based show.

409
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I've been trying to talk to a couple people.

410
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Well, where is that pilot, madam?

411
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Well, you know what? I need to hear from a certain somebody who lives in the Bay Area.

412
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
God, why'd you make my accent come back?

413
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
But you get the idea. So you can contact me again, Rob, at VOGNetwork.com.

414
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VOGNetwork.com,

415
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
use the passphrase, SPOON.

416
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Alright, enough promotion. Let's get into video game news. It's what you guys are here for. Loki!

417
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Alright, so let's talk about promotion.

418
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
The Xbox One, they finally announced that their launch date will be the 22nd.

419
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Also Friday, also eight years after the Xbox 360 launch, and one week past the PlayStation 4 launch.

420
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And also one week before Black Friday, which is when you expect consoles are going to come out.

421
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Why were people so dead set on, oh, Xbox One's going to be the first to market, and it has to be the first?

422
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Honestly, I still think it's coming out too early. I think that they're not going to have enough.

423
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Well, they're releasing in a very few regions, and I think they're going to...

424
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I remember Major Nelson, he's like, okay, look, here's the first case of boxes, or the systems, off the assembly line.

425
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And he tweeted that, I'm like, I almost wanted to respond back, I'm like, it's not that impressive, that's only two systems, buddy.

426
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:31,000
You know, that would have been rude of me, and I did not do that. So, I thought that in my head, laughed to myself, and went back to working.

427
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:41,000
But, yeah, so that is coming out there. It's going to be launching 13 markets, and, you know, cool. 500 bucks, all that fun stuff.

428
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:51,000
On top of that, though, there's going to be some minor tweaks. One, they made the announcement that they're going to be upping the processor speed a little bit.

429
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I guess that they tested the system runs cool enough, and so now they can kick up the processor speed to 1.75 gigahertz instead of 1.6 gigahertz.

430
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:11,000
And then, of course, the CPU got boosted early in August from, was it, from 800 to 853 megahertz.

431
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
What kind of difference that's going to make, I don't think it's going to be night and day, but whatever.

432
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:28,000
So, cool, better specs. Also, in Europe, you're going to be getting FIFA 14 with your Xbox One Day One Edition consoles.

433
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Also, there were a few retailers in case you didn't want the FIFA. You can also get a Forza 5, so I believe that's separate.

434
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Nothing like that announced yet for the US or North America. Not sure if they're going to do anything like that, but I don't know. It'd be interesting.

435
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:57,000
And then, also, there was, this is like a bunch of bullet points from different things. So, the Xbox One can support up to eight controllers at once.

436
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Remember, the PlayStation 3 can support up to seven. I believe there was like NBA 2K used that, and I don't know, maybe FIFA, and that's about it.

437
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And then, of course, PlayStation 4 only four. So, you know, right there, people are going, there you go, Xbox One's going to win this generation because they support eight controllers.

438
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:28,000
When have you ever had that many people over playing one video game? Well, I shouldn't say that. There are parties, and I've seen Rock Band Nights and so forth, but that's so few and far between.

439
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Its implementation is going to be very limited. I mean, like I said, there is only a couple, like, I swear, less than five games that probably use that seven controller configuration because they're just not going to do that.

440
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I mean, sure, Microsoft would like you to believe that there's going to be a lot of situations that require that, so you have to buy those extra controllers, but I don't think that there's actually going to be, you know, there's probably going to be four players, like, you know, like most games are going to be four players.

441
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I don't think you're going to have eight people, and definitely not split screen because that'd be just fucking stupid.

442
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Don't get me wrong. I think it's cool that, and like, I'm not knocking Xbox One for having that, but I'm just saying it's not the deal maker or breaker that some people on the internet are making out to be.

443
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It's like, okay, neat. Let's see what games are going to do with that. What are games going to do with that? We'll see.

444
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
It'd be better if you could hook up eight Kinects.

445
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
No, it would not.

446
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
TV, TV, TV, TV, TV.

447
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Alright, and then, also, external storage will not be supported at launch, so the 500 gigabyte hard drive that comes in there, well, that's going to have to be enough for a while because that's all you can do with it, because you're not going to be able to store stuff using the USB ports yet.

448
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
So, I hope those games aren't that big.

449
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
There's not that many games coming out. I mean, 500 gigabytes is quite a bit.

450
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Why is there an expectation here that we're going to get a free game just because Europe is?

451
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I think because people think that they want, it's not fair, Rob. It's not fair. Honestly, I think it's because the price point's too high.

452
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
But, Daddy, I want the goose that lays the golden eggs.

453
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I think that they think that the price point's still too high and that they keep trying to lure more people into buying the system.

454
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Europe pays more for their systems, though, in games in general, though, don't they, when you convert dollars to Euros and all that?

455
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I understand that, but it would still be the same, you know, so you're going to have a more sensitive game.

456
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
And Sony's traditionally had the advantage in Europe, right?

457
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I don't know.

458
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I get it.

459
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I don't think that they will, but, I mean, people would like to think that, I guess. I would be kind of annoyed if it was Madden, you know, like, I don't fucking care about Madden.

460
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Yeah, but a lot of fucking people care about Madden.

461
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I understand that.

462
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:55,000
That is a pretty big deal if they do get that. I mean, as much as I'm sitting here saying I don't think people should have an expectation about it, if they do come out and say Madden's coming out free with the Xbox One, there's going to be a lot of people that are like,

463
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:01,000
oh dude, but if you get Xbox One, you get Madden. But I still think that price difference is going to be a little like, but it's also $100 more, dude.

464
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I think what they could do is like maybe some free live, maybe, or free something else, you know, that doesn't really cost them anything, like, you know, free, like digital stuff, you know, maybe like a free, you know, you get, well, Killer Instinct, I don't know, maybe that would be kind of, you get Killer Instinct.

465
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
You are getting that.

466
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:45,000
But then again, you know, it's free to play, you know, essentially for demos, free to play. Um, I don't know, I think it seems like you get more value with the PlayStation 4 as far as like PlayStation Plus, you know, because you're getting some free games with that, but you don't really get any, I mean, maybe they offer like some free games with gold, you know, because they're doing that games of gold thing right now with, you know, Xbox 360.

467
00:47:45,000 --> 00:48:03,000
You know, maybe they offer something like that for the Xbox One, like one of the games, but I don't know, I don't think it's necessary, but I think that there might be something they need to do when, you know, and maybe that close to Black Friday's, you know, they're going to have some retailers doing that already.

468
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Okay. All right. Well, let's move on, talking about, this isn't necessarily console-based, at least for now, but it looks like it might end up there, and this was some huge news that came out. It technically was the week we were off, but this is such huge news that we have to talk about it tonight, and it is about a Kickstarter, which usually, you know, whatever, these things are turning out to be a dime a dozen, but this one is, this one is shaping up to be a game changer.

469
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:44,000
It is Kiji Inafune's new Kickstarter. If you don't know that name, he is the creator of Mega Man, and he was formerly a Capcom producer. He has turned to Kickstarter to fund a game called Mighty No. 9, and it's Mega Man.

470
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Like, it's not, I'm not, you're not supposed to say that because, you know, oh, well, there's, there, there are some differences in the way things are, it's fucking Mega Man.

471
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
It's fucking Mega Man.

472
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:08,000
It's fucking Mega Man. It's, it's the game people want that Capcom, for whatever reason, figured would fail, and now Capcom's having to eat a little crow with this because this Kickstarter currently, it was funded, I want to say, within the first day.

473
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Of course, a couple hours.

474
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:17,000
It was a couple hours, and where's it at right now? 1.8 million, 1.8 million, 32,000 backers with 22 days to go.

475
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Which means now we get a Linux version, a Mac version.

476
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
That's right, a Making of Documentary, New Game Plus, and Turbo Mode, two bonus stages.

477
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
And almost console versions.

478
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Almost console versions. If they hit 2.2 million, which they will, they're gonna get PS3, 360, and Wii U versions of this game.

479
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I'm just upset that it uses Amazon payments, which for some reason, for me, is not working.

480
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Oh, for Kickstarter?

481
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Because this was going to take my Kickstarter virginity.

482
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Was it?

483
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Just, just hold out.

484
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Oh yes, I was going to, my body was ready.

485
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Why?

486
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Because freaking Mega Man. Fuck.

487
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Fair enough.

488
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Does that need an explanation?

489
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
But it's not Mega Man. This is Mighty No. 9.

490
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Do not care. Do not care. It will be Mega Man in my heart.

491
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
The art is only similar because it's the same guy.

492
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Do. Not. Care.

493
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
And it's not because I don't like it, but because, you know, I've kind of learned the Kickstarter stuff now.

494
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
It's like, I put money down now, and the game doesn't come out until, like, late next year or something.

495
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
It's like, no thanks, I'll just keep my money now and I'll buy it when it comes out.

496
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Because it's gonna be probably about the same price anyways.

497
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,000
You know, 10, 15 dollars, and you put down 10 or 15 dollars for the game now.

498
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
It's like, whatever. That's it.

499
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I've been very conservative with Kickstarter stuff.

500
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Except for Video Game High School, of course.

501
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I'll buy anything they put out.

502
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I found it very interesting in that video.

503
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Did you guys watch the Kickstarter video? The little 5 minute, well produced thing that had the pitch in it?

504
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
There was a very quick line, but something that really caught my attention was something about, he said,

505
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
when the game he wanted to make, or the game that he was making, was cancelled, he was devastated.

506
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
And I was kinda like, wow.

507
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:01,000
So this whole Mega Man universe thing really burned him to the point where he's gonna make it anyway.

508
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Well, you know, it's not Mega Man, but this is just so crazy to me how Capcom really just said,

509
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
you know what, this franchise just isn't worth investing in anymore.

510
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
And now you've got 32,000 people climbing saying yes it is.

511
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Well, you had 100,000 people that joined that Facebook group and then more.

512
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Yeah, but it's important to put your money where your mouth is.

513
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I think that a lot of those people are gonna put their money where their mouth is.

514
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I think they will, too.

515
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I think there are quite a few people like you that just don't want to participate in Kickstarter

516
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
that will wait for the game to come out.

517
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
There's a lot of reasons why, especially there's a lot of, we'll get into some of that stuff later on,

518
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
but there's a lot of shady stuff that goes on with Kickstarter that some of these projects aren't worth backing.

519
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Not to say that this one is one of those, but it's just kind of...

520
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Is it the Ouya Burn?

521
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
No, it's not the Ouya.

522
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
It's just like there's other projects out there.

523
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I've gotten into some of that stuff before, but not to get so far off topic.

524
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:07,000
It's just I don't really want to, I've been very much, I'm gonna put money down.

525
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I did that for Shadowrun and Shadowrun Online and stuff, and Shadowrun's awesome,

526
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
and I haven't played that game since I got it.

527
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I got the game, and I'm like, cool, I have the game.

528
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Alright, I'm gonna go off and do something else now.

529
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
And Shadowrun Online, cool, I pledged for that, and I haven't played that yet.

530
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
And there's still a few more games that I have back that haven't even come out yet,

531
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
and I just don't play them once I've paid for them.

532
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Here's how Beck, the hero of Mega Man, which isn't there supposed to be a female command called Call?

533
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
So instead of Rock and Roll, we get Beck and Call, right?

534
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Okay, so here's how Beck is different.

535
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Beck takes the abilities of the enemy robots he defeats,

536
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
but he uses those abilities further, transforming parts of his body,

537
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,000
like his limbs might become giant magnets, enabling him to walk up walls or rip away enemy shields.

538
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
That sounds really awesome, but it's fucking Mega Man.

539
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Not that that's bad, that's not a bad thing, I'm just saying this is hilarious,

540
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
because it is fucking Mega Man that we are backing.

541
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And the other games may just change the color palette a little bit and just give him a different weapon.

542
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:19,000
We're changing his design a little bit, and his color palette, and he's fucking Mega Man.

543
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
It's like another Mega Man series, Mega Man Y or something.

544
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
It's like if the creators of DDR came out and said,

545
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
hey, you know what, we're going to make In the Groove,

546
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
but we're just going to change things just enough so we don't get sued,

547
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
because we don't have the rights to DDR anymore.

548
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
And that's what we have.

549
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Bochi Kawa in chat at live.vog.network.com says,

550
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I was really concerned once they called the main character Beck,

551
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
but once Call came to my attention, I was totally okay with it.

552
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I totally fucking hate that band, Beck.

553
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
It's not a band, it's a person.

554
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Whatever.

555
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
If you have two turntables and a microphone, you're banned.

556
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
That's like Alan's favorite musician.

557
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
But the Ghetto Chip malfunction EP was really good.

558
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
It was really good. Beck should do music for them.

559
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Actually, no, he shouldn't, because they actually have the original lady

560
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
that did the Mega Man 1 music is doing the music for this.

561
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Besides that, Beck did a lot of the music for Scott Pilgrim.

562
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Let me pull up the...

563
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Remember?

564
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Yes, I do, and that was great.

565
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Let me pull up the Kickstarter real quick, because...

566
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Sorry, live radio, what can you do?

567
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I want to actually play a little bit of this,

568
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
because they actually have it on the Kickstarter page.

569
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
They have some of the, it's not Mega Man,

570
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Mega Man number 9 theme song by...

571
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Scrolling down here, where...

572
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
God, lord, there's so much content on this page already.

573
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Oh, this is terrible radio, I'm very sorry, you guys.

574
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,000
And I like how he's the number 9, because there are eight other bosses

575
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
that he's gonna have to fight.

576
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Manami Matsumae did the soundtrack of the original Mega Man

577
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
and the iconic soundtracks, and she is going to be doing this game,

578
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
and already has the theme song out there.

579
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Like, you can just see the camera panning up the tall story building to this music.

580
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Actually, I think they did that in the Kickstarter video, didn't they?

581
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I think they did.

582
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Let me fast forward a little bit, so you get more of that vibe.

583
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Totally not Mega Man, totally a new thing, totally.

584
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
You gotta admit, though, the music, the vibe with the music

585
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
between the first Rock Man and the second one,

586
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
had a completely different play vibe.

587
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
It did, and I gotta be honest, my favorite music was the first Mega Man game.

588
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Like, Elec Man's stage, and Guts Man, I mean, those are iconic to me.

589
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I was actually a really big fan of Fire Man's music.

590
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Not that two was bad, because you had things like Bubble Man,

591
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
but one was great.

592
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I totally love those new characters that, instead of having Construction Homeless,

593
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
they have construction cones on their head.

594
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:06,000
And then, also, the robotic dog that looks nothing like Rush, but is Rush.

595
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
So, it does look like we're totally gonna see this...

596
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
It's not a bad thing, but, dude, it's Mega Man.

597
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
No, and I'm excited about this.

598
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
And I like the art style they're going with it,

599
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
because what I like about it is that,

600
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
you remember how Mega Man 9 and 10, like, purposefully went retro?

601
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
And, like, that was cool, don't get me wrong,

602
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
but I kind of like that this is 2D in the new generation.

603
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Does that make sense?

604
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Like, you know, kind of what a lot of us just want to see in a frickin' game.

605
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
So, I'm glad that he's getting to do the game the way he wants to do it,

606
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
and there it is.

607
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I think Rama puts it best.

608
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Mighty No. 9 is a Mega Man in another parallel universe.

609
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
S.S.G.A. 100 Matt in our chatroom brings up a good point.

610
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Manami Matsumae also did some of the soundtrack for Shovel Knight,

611
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
which isn't Mega Man per se, but it was very, you know,

612
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
and that Kickstarter did crazy good, too.

613
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I think I backed that one.

614
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I did back that one.

615
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Did I? No, I think I just missed it, unfortunately.

616
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I backed it.

617
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Yeah. I'll probably get it later, when the game comes out, but, yeah.

618
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Anyhow, I could talk about this further,

619
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
but this game's happening, folks, and it'll at least be on Steam,

620
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
but I'm hard-pressed to imagine it's not going to make it to PlayStation 3.

621
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Are we going to get a sidekick that's going to have a sword, too,

622
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
and his name will be Minus?

623
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
No, that'll be in Mighty No. 10.

624
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Mighty No. 10.

625
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Or whatever.

626
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
How will they call the sequels to this?

627
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Because this isn't true, not Mega Man, unless you have Mighty No. 9, Part 2,

628
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Mighty No. 9, Part 3.

629
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Maybe they'll do letters instead.

630
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
That'll be how it differs.

631
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
MM9?

632
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Yeah, no, Mighty No. 9B, Mighty No. 9C.

633
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I don't know. Whatever.

634
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
All right, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

635
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I have some stuff and things, but mostly about VR stuff.

636
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I mentioned Oculus Rift earlier because of experiences with Bobby's crazy headset.

637
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Well, it looks like Sony's got a similar plan going on.

638
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:05,000
They have a VR set for the PS4 that should be announced at the Tokyo Game Show,

639
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:11,000
and they already reported to Eurogamer that the device would be coming out sometime in 2014.

640
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:20,000
So it's like they're trying to get past the move aspect and really lean toward the Rift.

641
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
That's what it seems like to me.

642
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I wonder if the PS4 is going to have games that are compatible with either or both,

643
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
or if they're going to insist on using just their headset.

644
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Well, even a rumor is still going around that Microsoft's going to go the same route.

645
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Remember their whole leaked game plan or whatever you want to call it with Kinect and stuff

646
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
and this crazy VR shit with that?

647
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Even with the Xbox One and the tagline for it and everything, it was all accurate.

648
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:59,000
So next year we're supposed to see some of this weird shit unless it gets pushed a little bit.

649
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I'd say next year to early 2015 we'll be hearing something about this,

650
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
but I think it's the way it's going to go.

651
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I'm telling you, if a Sony executive or a Microsoft executive played the Oculus Rift,

652
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
that's why they're trying to get a slice of it.

653
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:20,000
And it seems like it's really just gaining a lot more speed for people developing for that kind of technology.

654
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I mean, look who they're supporting it.

655
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Nintendo, this is your chance.

656
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Nintendo on, remember? Remember that whole concept video?

657
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:36,000
There is no shame in going back and saying, hey, we saw that April Fool's joke or whatever you want,

658
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
pre-E3 joke, and we're going to make it happen anyways.

659
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
You know what? We could be seeing the return of the Virtual Boy.

660
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:50,000
But it's so different. The Virtual Boy was silly and the 3D didn't work very well and it was all one color.

661
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
The Oculus Rift is awesome.

662
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
But now the technology is there to make it work.

663
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:03,000
I mean, imagine if you had something like, say, for your DS that would play the upper screen stuff through a virtual environment,

664
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,000
or even hook up your Wii to do a virtual Wii.

665
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Here's the thing about this, although I'm excited for it, I would like to see something like this happen,

666
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
especially if they can make it economical.

667
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I don't want all of gaming to go down this route.

668
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I just don't want to see the entire industry cop on this.

669
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
It's all about the VR headsets. That's just like motion gaming.

670
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Just like 3D?

671
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Yeah, it's kind of like I don't want everybody to go there.

672
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:36,000
And part of that has to do with the fact, again, I don't think you can play it for as long periods of time.

673
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
You have some serious accessibility issues with a VR headset.

674
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I mean, you know, Jamie, can you imagine if all your games were on a VR headset?

675
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
You'd probably be pissed because it's like...

676
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Well, I wouldn't buy them if they were all on a VR headset. That's the final thing.

677
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I would have to have something that I can play that, number one, would make me want to barf all over the house,

678
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
and I could use a mouse.

679
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:05,000
And we'll always have indies. I mean, if nothing else, there'll always be people that don't want to develop for this kind of stuff.

680
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:12,000
But I'm just saying, I like this as an enhancement, not as a, this is the rest of the industry forever.

681
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:18,000
But, you know, I really do want to say that Nintendo really did give us the big idea.

682
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I would have to say was one of the first inspirations for this type of thing.

683
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I mean, yeah, we had those little virtual environment things before, like at Q's are, you know, where you could get in.

684
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
It gave me a rotten headache.

685
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:35,000
But the Virtual Boy was the first attempt, I think, of bringing a gaming experience in a virtual environment home.

686
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Isn't it funny that Gunpei Okoye got so much shit over that system, but yet maybe he was just really ahead of his time?

687
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I think that's the problem with any wise invention.

688
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:56,000
You know, how many great technologies come out that are basically shot down because of either the technology is not caught up to it, the concept is too advanced, or people are not used to...

689
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Well, in the Virtual Boy's case, it was that the technology wasn't truly there.

690
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Or the red was the problem.

691
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Yeah, but the concept of that type of thing, I mean, we've seen different types of techs come out that are basically poo-pooed because they're not commercially viable.

692
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:23,000
You know, we could be running, just look at our energy issues right now, we could be running on very clean energy right now if it wasn't that petroleum was so, you know, marketable.

693
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I mean, hell, Betamax was far superior to VHS, yet look what went out.

694
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Oh, because porn went VHS for one. Wasn't VHS the cheaper option too?

695
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
It was a little cheaper, but the better quality was the Betamax.

696
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I mean, people are avoiding the better items because of market scare, but I mean, the technology wasn't there for the Virtual Boy, but it was a very advanced concept for its time.

697
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:57,000
And I think if it had waited another two years, it could have been something really great.

698
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Or until the point that they could get full color on it.

699
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Or until they could have done Mode 7. Boy.

700
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Alright, anyhow. Up next, Loki.

701
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Alright, so there may be a slight delay in getting the Gaikai service for PlayStation 4 to roll out in Europe.

702
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Apparently the problem is to issues with broadband internet availability in Europe.

703
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:27,000
And basically they're just saying they don't have a timeline for it right now because those services aren't available.

704
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:34,000
So the plan is to begin with North America next year, and the plan is to provide a streaming service that will allow PlayStation 3 content initially to be streamed.

705
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Firstly, PlayStation 4, then the Vita, then PlayStation 3.

706
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:44,000
And so that will happen in 2004 in North America, initially.

707
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:51,000
And now, I guess they touched upon issues in broadband in Europe and during the presentation.

708
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:58,000
And they said that Europe is of course part of the roadmap, but the service will be deployed at some point in the future.

709
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
And for reasons outside of their control, it's been delayed.

710
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:10,000
And it kind of makes me wonder, at the same time, remember all those features they were trying to push originally with the Xbox One stuff?

711
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
And having to be always connected and having broadband internet?

712
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Man, that would have been a real big clusterfuck in Europe because they're having issues with some decent broadband.

713
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:26,000
And the area, I mean, what would have made people think, you know, this other cloud stuff's gonna work?

714
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I don't know.

715
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Well, or as you brought up when all the fuckery with Final Fantasy XIV was happening a couple weeks ago, you know.

716
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Oh God, yeah.

717
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Who's-

718
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Is that fixed now?

719
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Yeah, it's a lot better now.

720
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I mean, obviously there's still issues like what Dark Soccer was talking about earlier that she's having and all these other like weird isolated things.

721
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:49,000
But it's not on the large scale like we were having it, but there's still like pain points, if that makes sense.

722
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Yeah.

723
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:56,000
But there is a good percentage of people who are playing like it is a normal video game at this point.

724
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I'm still gonna document what my experience was with their customer service is like tomorrow.

725
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Yeah, good luck getting through. I've heard some nightmare stories about customer service.

726
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:12,000
But it seems that that's the only way people are getting anything to happen because they have so many tickets open and people keep reopening their ticket.

727
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Ugh, yuck.

728
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Well, anyhow, let's move on. Something that is supposed to help you with your Xbox One experience is Smart Glass, that's right.

729
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Smart Glass, which I kind of was thinking Microsoft might have abandoned at one point because it came out for the 360 and then, well, that's it.

730
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:38,000
But Smart Glass is happening on Xbox One and there was some more information this week in an interview with Xbox Wire from Microsoft General Manager Ron Pessner,

731
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:46,000
who talked about that the app will be more responsive for one. This app will connect to the Xbox One within four seconds.

732
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:54,000
That's much faster than the 360 connects today. Up to 16 Smart Glass devices are supposed to connect with a single Xbox One console.

733
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Why?

734
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Eight controllers and two phones a person. Sounds plausible.

735
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Well, no. The Smart Glass devices would be like tablets. So why would you need 16 fucking tablets or phones?

736
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Well, I will put it, I will give it this. If it's supposed to be interactive with movies and second screen with that, then people don't have to share one.

737
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Like, each person could have one.

738
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Or maybe it's like, you know, that somebody can be registered with a console and maybe you're talking family members too.

739
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Maybe. No, no.

740
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:30,000
But Smart Glass is on phones. I think that having the 16 devices around, if you have the people, is not that hard to get.

741
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Anyhow, there could be the use for game controllers with this, but I don't think that's where they're actually going.

742
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:45,000
It's just, I mean, you can kind of use game control. I mean, not game control, but you can console control with Smart Glass today.

743
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
But it's a little eh.

744
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:54,000
That would be fantastic. Hey, cool. I can use on screen digital, you know, game pads.

745
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
You know, I still have that Smart Glass app on my phone.

746
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Oh, yeah. Well, I have it too, but I just don't use it.

747
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:08,000
When away from the console, Smart Glass will still allow you to communicate with friends, check achievements, watch game DVR videos, and, of course, go shopping in the store.

748
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:13,000
One thing, though, that Smart Glass on Xbox One will have is game help.

749
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:21,000
When publishing a game, you must submit a help manual that will aid players either in-game or through Smart Glass.

750
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
And you can actually say Xbox Help, and then the help thing will appear in the console.

751
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:33,000
But you can also do it in Smart Glass, where you click on the help icon, and it will show you exactly whatever it is that you want to see there.

752
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:43,000
It should be noted, though, when you do say Xbox Help, you'll see a poof of smoke, and then, out from a shadows, Clippy will arrive.

753
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
It looks like you're trying to...

754
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
You summon me?

755
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
It looks like you're trying to access Killer Instinct.

756
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Choose one of these three options. Oh, God. I can only imagine what that's going to look like.

757
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:04,000
But, yeah, I mean, I'm just curious, like, okay, well, how is this second screen experience going to really be enhanced?

758
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Because Smart Glass, as it is right now, is kind of, eh? So, I don't know.

759
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Anyhow, that's it. Smart Glass on Xbox One.

760
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Hopefully, it will be something that doesn't fade away in a few months.

761
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Dark Sakura?

762
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Well, there is actually some stuff going on for Microsoft in Europe right now.

763
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:38,000
So, what's going on is that they have this Xbox Live Rewards thing that's going to be going on, where basically you get rewards for playing new games.

764
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:48,000
As it works is that if you play a new game for more than ten hours, a disc-based release on top of that, you get a thousand credits every time you play a game.

765
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Well, in the UK, that would be 67 pence. That's like a soda, I think.

766
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
It's basically, in North America, I think it's a thousand credits equals a dollar.

767
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Yeah. So, at any rate, of course, you know, the more games you play, the more rewards you get, the more points you get.

768
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:21,000
And, like, if you get up between $3,000 to $9,999, you get Contender, and the lowest is where you just get 50 credits back on every little bit that you spend.

769
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
That would be the equivalent of 800 Microsoft points.

770
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:31,000
So, it's supposed to be deposited every 15th and 30th of each month once you hit 5,000 credits.

771
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:44,000
So, I don't know how this is going to work. Like, right now, I know that when I switched all of my stuff over from my points to money, it gave me a dollar. I bought a song.

772
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Here's how you earn credits in this. Basically, you can complete an apps punch card, which I think you have to buy so many apps or something, or use the apps for so long.

773
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Was that like how when I buy ten pink berries, I get a free one?

774
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Something like that.

775
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
That's weird.

776
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:05,000
They have a complete My Map Pack punch card, so if you buy, like, so many map packs, you get 5,000 credits.

777
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Make your first Xbox store purchase 1,250 credits.

778
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Complete My Movies and TV punch card, 3,000 credits.

779
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Take a survey, 250 credits.

780
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:25,000
And then, also, see, play a new game for ten hours is 1,000 credits. Refer a friend, 1,000 credits.

781
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
This sounds like how to get a badge in Steam. One of those badges.

782
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Renew my membership. What I want to know is how many fucking credits do I get on my birthday because it used to be 25 cents.

783
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:42,000
So, is that any better now? Do I get 25 cents still? Or is it like, you know, 50 cents?

784
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Ooh. Well, inflation and interest and all that.

785
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I think it's a little bribery. Plus, I think the playing ten hours thing is a little excessive.

786
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,000
I mean, it can't be ten hours at a time. It has to be something that you're going to play for a couple of days and then you get your thing.

787
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I think it's during the month. I think it's within a month of it releasing.

788
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
If I was getting Kingdom Hearts HD on 360, that might be happening.

789
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Yeah, but I haven't sat down to play a game like that. Well, I have on my PC. I take that back. So...

790
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Well, I don't think it's at a time. It's just...

791
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Well, I know it's not at a time, but there's sometimes... You know, people have busy lives. Some people only play on the weekends for a few hours at a time.

792
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Really? You couldn't squeak out ten hours of Mass Effect in the month that it came out?

793
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
While I'm unemployed, yes.

794
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Actually, and I easily sunk a hundred hours into Mass Effect across three months, I should be ashamed to say.

795
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
So I would have hit this ten hours easy when Mass Effect first came out.

796
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Well, I did do that in one day.

797
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I don't want to think ten hours isn't that ridiculous. There is a cap, though, I know what you can get a month...

798
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:52,000
As long as it wasn't ten hours over and over and over and over again, but yeah, ten hours is not too hard to meet.

799
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I know people that watch that much TV.

800
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:01,000
I think the other thing, though, with having that ten hour limitation is that they basically also discourage any return time.

801
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Because I know that, like, and I only know Game Stops because Dan managed one, their return policy was like a full refund in seven days.

802
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:16,000
And not, I don't know how many people are going to get ten hours of gameplay in, like, say it's like the average student, okay?

803
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:22,000
You got school all day, you have homework, you come home, and then are you really going to have a lot of time to play?

804
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Most of the play is going to be done on the weekends.

805
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
So that's going to cut out some of that return time right there.

806
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:33,000
That's where I see the ten hours coming in, but at the same time, I think it's a little underhanded.

807
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Well, it's only really twenty minutes a day.

808
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I guess that's true.

809
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I mean, it's twenty minutes you could be exercising or you could play some Mass Effect.

810
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Exercise your fingers.

811
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out what games you can sink ten hours into this month as we look at some release dates.

812
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Let's see, so this week we've got NHL 14 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

813
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,000
On PC, the Elder Scrolls Anthology.

814
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:09,000
If you just learned about this Elder Scrolls series, you know, you can pick up all of those games on PC.

815
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
All the cool kids are playing this Elder Scrolls.

816
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Exactly, Elder Scrolls, that sounds like games for old people.

817
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Kingdom Hearts HD, or 1.5 HD Remix on PlayStation 3 this week.

818
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Puppeteer on PlayStation 3.

819
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
The Sims 3 has an expansion pack coming out.

820
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Sims 3 movie stuff, so that's coming out this week as well.

821
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:43,000
And on Vita, hopefully, hopefully and actually a good first person shooter now on the Vita.

822
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Killzone Mercenary coming out this week as well.

823
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I believe that's it, I think.

824
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Let me quickly glance over this real quick.

825
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Didn't forget anything.

826
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Nope, that would be it.

827
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Alright, let's travel to Japan then and check out the releases over there.

828
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Oh, I did, I did.

829
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
God damn it, Loki.

830
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
One week from today, I forgot. One week from today, Wonderful 101.

831
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
A Sunday release as Nintendo releases tend to be.

832
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Alright, let's go to Japan and check out PlayStation 3 releases.

833
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Air Conflicts Vietnam on September 12th, along with AKB1 149 Renee So Senkyou comes out in regular and limited edition.

834
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
What?

835
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,000
No, I think that's something that I was looking at the other day.

836
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Was it? Here's what it looks like. Isn't this like a girly band?

837
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Never mind, that's, yeah.

838
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:40,000
This is like girly band karaoke, pretty swimsuit photos, I don't know.

839
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Yeah, that's not what I think it is. I was thinking of something else.

840
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,000
What is this labeled adventure? Is this like the Spice World game or something? Who knows?

841
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I don't know.

842
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Wait a minute, that was the limited edition. Let me look at the regular one.

843
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
The regular one, are there screenshots? Nope, just the box art.

844
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Pretty Japanese girls, some playing the guitar, some are getting married, whatever.

845
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I was wondering if that was like an AKB48 thing.

846
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
No.

847
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Max Payne 3, it goes into the classics, so that means a price reduction this week in Japan on September 12th.

848
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Going over to the Xbox 360, just Air Conflicts Vietnam is the only release that is also on the 360 this week.

849
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Going to the PlayStation Vita, nothing until the 19th, this week looks pretty empty.

850
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:29,000
But if we look at the Wii U and the 3DS, the Wii U doesn't really get anything until September 26th.

851
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:35,000
That's when Epic Mickey 2 finally gets its Japanese release on the 26th, but that'll be a ways out.

852
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Looking at the 3DS, however, on the 14th there's quite a few games because old Monster Hunter 4 is being released on the 3DS, which is kind of a big deal.

853
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:56,000
There's a shit ton of peripherals that go with that for Monster Hunter 4, such as like you want a new stand for it or a sticker or pouches or what have you.

854
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
That is huge.

855
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
There's also a special 3DS-LL coming out for Monster Hunter 4.

856
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,000
There's a black version and a white version.

857
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
There's special packs that come with the game.

858
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
That is on the 14th.

859
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:18,000
So, I imagine that's Japan's big release and the one that actually some people over here would probably be importing because I know some people are really into their Monster Hunter.

860
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Sony PSP, not to be left out in the cold.

861
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Yes, PSP, not V.

862
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Brothers Conflict Brilliant Blue in regular and limited edition this week on the PSP.

863
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
There you go. That's it for Japanese releases.

864
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Well, we have a few things coming out in the UK.

865
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:43,000
On the 10th we have Amnesia, A Machine for Pigs on PC and Metro Last Night on Mac.

866
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:49,000
For the 11th we have DuckTales Remastered coming out on Xbox 360 and Puppeteer on PlayStation 3.

867
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,000
On the 12th we have Arma 3 and NHL 14.

868
01:16:53,000 --> 01:17:04,000
And on the 13th we have I Am Alive on PC, King of Fighters 13 Steam Edition, Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix and Rayman Legends on the Vita.

869
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
That's it.

870
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week. Loki.

871
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Yes, so Steam is adding some more stuff to their trading system.

872
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Now they have this Steam Trade Offers program.

873
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:30,000
And I guess what it allows you to do is it allows, I guess, friends to suggest trade deals for inventory items.

874
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Which you can accept, counter, or decline.

875
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:39,000
And I guess it's a way to negotiate cards maybe?

876
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,000
I don't know. It would be nice if I could trade my games that I have that I don't use.

877
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,000
But yeah, so that's what they have right now.

878
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:53,000
I guess you can check out other people's inventories and so if they have a card that you want or something you can be like,

879
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Hey, can I have that card? I'll trade you my other card.

880
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,000
More stuff on Steam to waste your time and money.

881
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I was very disappointed. I didn't get a single booster pack while I was at Dragon Con.

882
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,000
But I bet the card trading has died down because the summer sale is over.

883
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
So how do you get booster packs in games? I play a lot of...

884
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Once you've got the most...

885
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Let's say a game has six cards available. Three of them will drop as you play the game.

886
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
For like every twenty minutes you play the game you get a card.

887
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
But up to half the most that's in the set.

888
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:37,000
After you've got all those drops you're eligible for a booster pack.

889
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:42,000
So when someone else crafts a badge, somebody in the community at random will get a booster pack.

890
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:47,000
That's how it keeps going. So the more people craft the more booster packs that go out.

891
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Okay, I guess I got all mine in Saints Row IV because I have four cards.

892
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Does it say that you have any left to earn?

893
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,000
I can't see how in Saints Row IV. You've probably played that to death.

894
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Yeah, I don't have any more to earn. I have duplicates even.

895
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Okay, yeah, so you'll be eligible for booster packs for Saints Row IV.

896
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:14,000
But to be honest, some people trade them, but I just got to the point where I got lazy.

897
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:19,000
I sold all my duplicates in the marketplace and then bought what I wanted to make badges.

898
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
It worked! So there you go.

899
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:27,000
ActDef saying, I got a Team Fortress 2 booster pack yesterday, so some people are getting them.

900
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Alright, I got some music game news for you guys before we get into the classic game of the week.

901
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,000
And the first game I want to talk about is a game called Cross Beats.

902
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:43,000
It's Cross X Beats, which makes me think this game is called Cross Cross Beats, which actually would make sense.

903
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Because guess who's making Cross Cross Beats? Guess who the producer is?

904
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:52,000
It's Naoki Madaya is actually producing this game for Capcom.

905
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:57,000
He no longer works at Konami.

906
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
He left Konami a year ago if you weren't aware.

907
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Well, no, they're still making DDR. It's different producers.

908
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:10,000
But anyway, if you don't know who Naoki is, we used to talk a lot about DDR back in the day,

909
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:15,000
and Naoki used to be the producer of DDR. He did a lot of songs that were very famous that were in the game.

910
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
He had all these different pseudonyms that he created songs under.

911
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
He was a big driving force behind the music in the game.

912
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:26,000
So it goes without saying that a lot of these fans of Bamani projects in the past,

913
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Naoki was still at Konami for a very long time.

914
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:37,000
He did the Dance Dance Party or whatever that game was that wasn't so bad on the 360 arcade.

915
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
That was all Naoki.

916
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:45,000
So he's left Konami now, and with Capcom he's going to do Cross Cross Beats.

917
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
It's an IOS game. It's a rhythm game on IOS.

918
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Not a lot known about the game. We don't know when it's coming out.

919
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Rumor is it could show up at Tokyo Game Show. That would certainly make sense.

920
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
It looks like the game is played with tapping, swiping, flicking.

921
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Probably, considering it's on a touch screen, it'll probably get some easy similarities to Elite Beat Agents and Technica and that style of play.

922
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:11,000
But I'm sure there will be unique things that differentiate it, such as the music.

923
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:18,000
If you've been playing Bamani games for a while, you might recognize Tatch is also doing some of the songs.

924
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Void, Simon, Who's Some Thinker, DJ Simon, and all those guys appeared in media 2DX and the like.

925
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
That's happy news.

926
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Over the years.

927
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Also speaking of music games, Theatrhythm apparently set to get a sequel.

928
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Theatrhythm, the Final Fantasy music game on 3DS, I guess did well enough to necessitate a sequel called Final Fantasy Curtain Call.

929
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
No idea what this could be.

930
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:48,000
But my thought is, could it maybe be that this is the fully packaged game with all the DLC?

931
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:55,000
So I wouldn't necessarily think it's a full sequel, but certainly Square has enough music in their archive.

932
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Especially if you were to throw Chrono Trigger and other Square games into the mix.

933
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
The Secret of Mana and Evermore and all those games.

934
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,000
I'm sure there would be enough music to fill up a second game.

935
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:17,000
But I'm wondering if Curtain Call wouldn't just be an end of the year edition that packages everything and maybe a couple bonus tracks to try and sell this game all over again.

936
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
We'll see.

937
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
But there you go for music game news.

938
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
I liked Theatrhythm when I played it.

939
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
I did too.

940
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:31,000
My only problem with Theatrhythm was that, I don't know, it was a bit expensive for me.

941
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,000
But at least the iOS version, you could do a little more piecemeal.

942
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Anyhow, if Curtain Call really is even more songs, that'll help justify the price tag.

943
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Square likes money.

944
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Who doesn't like money?

945
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Alright, let's go to the classic game of the week.

946
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Back when games were very expensive, no matter what it was you were buying.

947
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Because they were all in cartridges.

948
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Dark Sakura is going to go into the vault and find a game that she thinks that you kids should be playing this week.

949
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Dark Sakura, what is the expensive cartridge classic game of the week?

950
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
It's Miracle Warriors, Seal of the Dark Lord for the Sega Master System.

951
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
And also, I'm sorry that I could not find a longer music sample.

952
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
All of the Let's Plays have freaking people talking over it.

953
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
It's fucking annoying.

954
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,000
I don't listen to the stupid thing to hear your voice.

955
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
I hear it. I watch it to watch the game.

956
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Anyway, in Japan it was known as Hajanofuin, which is Seal of the Dark Lord.

957
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,000
And it came out on the PC-88 and then was ported to other systems.

958
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Like I said, we got it on the Master System over here.

959
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
It's very similar to Phantasy Star.

960
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:42,000
It has this grid type map to show you where parts of interest are in the game.

961
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,000
And it also has this sort of traveling feature it looks like.

962
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,000
So basically in this game, you play the hero and you have different screens.

963
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Well, different parts of your screen that indicate what you do in the game.

964
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:04,000
So you have to collect all these mystical weapons in the armor and defeat the bad guy named Tararim and Seal of the Dark Lord around.

965
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:09,000
So each of the areas on the screen, there's four parts.

966
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:15,000
You have your stats on the lower left and that also lists all your party stats.

967
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:21,000
And then on the right you have your money, your weapon, that type of thing.

968
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:28,000
You also have a kind of maze map on top that's more grid shaped that shows you where you are laid out.

969
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,000
And then you have sort of a walking section, the upper left one.

970
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,000
It'll either show you the world you're walking in or the cave that you're walking in and your surroundings.

971
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
In battle it shows you your foes.

972
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
So it is built on a grid format.

973
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
You can move around and visit other places.

974
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:49,000
It shows you where you need to be based on white squares that are there.

975
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,000
And it's a pretty classic RPG.

976
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I mean this is one of the, I'd have to say one of the top ones for the Master System.

977
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:05,000
You also have different types of things that happen to you in the game.

978
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:10,000
There's flame spells that you can be attacked with, sleep spells, you know the usual ones.

979
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:16,000
And every time you're put to sleep you take damage which I think is a little bit different than a lot of RPGs.

980
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,000
It's all kinds of different strategies that you have to use to make it through the game.

981
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
And the world itself has three continents.

982
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
There's different types of land.

983
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
You have the plain, forest, mountains, and desert.

984
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:38,000
And each place of course has its own type of enemies that are indigenous to such land.

985
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:44,000
So you've got your towns too, you have smiths who can repair your weapons and healers and different shops.

986
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:49,000
And I mean it's typical RPG fare but it is one of the early ones.

987
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,000
So the game is Miracle Warriors Seal of the Dark Lord.

988
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,000
If you don't have it, why not?

989
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Probably because not many people have a Master System anymore.

990
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Yeah not anymore.

991
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Find yourself a power-based converter, hook it into your Genesis, you're good to go.

992
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:09,000
There it is, your classic game of the week for the Sega Master System, Miracle Warriors.

993
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Nice obscure pick, Dark Sakura.

994
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,000
That's kind of one I had to look into it a little more and I did watch some of those let's plays with the people talking and I was like, oh okay.

995
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Dungeon Buster is actually funny.

996
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Terror in the Dark Lord who is a half-naked demoness at the end of the game.

997
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Did you have this game on Sega Master System?

998
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
I think I had two copies of this game.

999
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Oh my gosh, is this something you came across later?

1000
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Keep in mind, Dan already had some of his games and he came into a box of Master System games for dirt cheap.

1001
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:41,000
That's why we have, we will be doing, actually I was going to say we are going to be starting to sell off some of the collection.

1002
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:51,000
So I'm going to give VOG listeners first chance whenever we put up an auction, I'm giving VOG listeners first go at it.

1003
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
We will post it.

1004
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
How are you going to do that? Twitter, Tumblr?

1005
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Forums.

1006
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:02,000
So we just had a Ninja Gaiden, we actually still have Ninja Gaiden Trilogy up on eBay right now if you've got 300 bucks.

1007
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
In the box manual mint condition.

1008
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Super rare game.

1009
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Super rare game.

1010
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
But great game.

1011
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Yes.

1012
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:14,000
If I knew it was going to go for that I would have stolen the copy that I rented from my local store when I was younger.

1013
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Well we also have Final Fight Guy which is probably going up soon.

1014
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Nice.

1015
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Alright we're going to take a quick break but we've got plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

1016
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
The Frugal Question of the Week.

1017
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Some news on a new MOBA that's based off a familiar franchise.

1018
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,000
A fan made movie which I'm sure will get shut down in a matter of time.

1019
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Rapid Fire News and your calls and tweets and so forth when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1020
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this Sunday evening September 8th 2013 with the 518th episode of our program.

1021
01:27:53,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Before we get back into some gaming news with Rapid Fire News I did want to mention and thank here on the program our good buddy Jason or VX JasonXV if you will.

1022
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I don't know if you guys noticed but there was a new voice in the intro tonight and you'll hear him in the outro as well.

1023
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Decided to be our voiceover guy because he was doing some of the VOG bumpers anyway so it made sense and I don't know if you know but before it was me kind of processed through Audition with an echo and slowed down.

1024
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
What? It wasn't a real robot voiceover person.

1025
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Magic. It's magic so I always you know it was always a little bit silly so I'm trying something a little new so hopefully you guys like Jason's intro because I will say that takes commitment to do that because he basically has to kind of guess what we're going to talk about.

1026
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Guess what we're going to talk about and have it recorded by Saturday or Sunday and change it if I don't like it.

1027
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:53,000
No but he's pretty good about being able to know what we're going to talk about on the show so big thanks to Jason and I should also thank because we really don't thank him enough and we've used this song for what freaking like eight years.

1028
01:28:53,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Midi Head did the intro the actual music that you hear in the background and the other announcer here at the top of the show.

1029
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Midi Head you know we had him on the show way back in the day because he was well known he did some of the songs that were in the DDR Xbox games.

1030
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:15,000
So we'd had him back on the show back when we were all about DDR and I think he ended up having a song in 2DX as well if I remember correctly.

1031
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:20,000
One of his remixes the In My Eyes remix or one of them was Jelly Kiss was in 2DX I think.

1032
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:33,000
So big thanks to Midi Head and I don't plug him enough and he's still going to midihead.com I believe he does a lot of sounds and incidental stuff for actually for use for podcasting and so forth.

1033
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:38,000
So if you like our intro maybe Midi Head can do something for you for a small fee.

1034
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Alright let's get back into some gaming news with rapid fire news and a lot of stuff tonight. Loki.

1035
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Yes so let's see as I was talking about with Rob and Jimmy earlier there was a Mass Effect texture pack for the Minecraft Xbox 360 version.

1036
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Now not only does it kind of reskin everything it also includes a level based off of the Mars facility.

1037
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:17,000
So that's kind of cool and then you also get character skins along with that so you can play as your characters and create your own worlds and do all that fun stuff.

1038
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:23,000
So check it out it's only $2 or I'm sorry $4 is what that's available for.

1039
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Totally forgot to check that out and I need to.

1040
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:38,000
And then of course there's this cool device and actually kind of inspired I want to make something very similar I was actually researching how much it would cost to do something like this.

1041
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:49,000
But it's called the cross plane kind of think of the Wii U's gamepad but you can use it with pretty much any game console.

1042
01:30:49,000 --> 01:31:00,000
So what it's going to have is basically the second screen it's got a small LCD screen that's HD and a wireless HDMI adapter built inside of it.

1043
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:12,000
And then also these you know basically the same layout as the Wii U gamepad and it's got these cartridges that plug in the top that map the signal for whatever you're playing.

1044
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:20,000
You know if you have an Xbox 360 version you know you have that you can play with the Xbox 360 or using your PC I guess with that.

1045
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:28,000
And then they have a PlayStation 3 one which you could sync up with the PlayStation 3 or with an Ouya so they've got those.

1046
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:41,000
And they're seeking $350,000 to begin production if you want to back one of these it would cost you $300 or $350 to actually get one of the cross play devices which should be available.

1047
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:47,000
I think sometime next year which for me is way too damn long for me to wait to make you know buy something like that.

1048
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:55,000
So I kind of want to make one my own but it's hard to finding a cheap and good wireless HDMI extender.

1049
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:07,000
They do exist but it's hard to find them and I was trying to peek in their video to see what what they were using because I can see it but they move the camera too fast so I couldn't read what it was.

1050
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
It looks cool though so that's on Kickstarter.

1051
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:23,000
And then if you happen to like free games there's a free remake of Ultima 4 the Commodore 64 version that's on iOS.

1052
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:28,000
And you can actually it has a little keyboard on it and everything and you can play the full game.

1053
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,000
It's near 100% replica of the game.

1054
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:39,000
And I guess it's free to download Ultima 4 C64.

1055
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
So go check it out.

1056
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Downloading As We Speak.

1057
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Which is great because the Ultima game that they put out on iOS EA actually did one like a free to play game.

1058
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
I didn't like it at all.

1059
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,000
I couldn't get very far through it at all I just really didn't like it.

1060
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Looks neat.

1061
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Yeah I've seen a C64 emulators on iPhone already.

1062
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
I don't know if it still exists.

1063
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:09,000
I think so because I think it uses a lot of free to play games and things that they have the rights to.

1064
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:13,000
But you know who am I to say no to a Commodore 64 experience in my pocket.

1065
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Yes.

1066
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Speaking of in your pocket there's a rumor going around that Infamous will be coming to the Vita.

1067
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Which you know shouldn't be a big surprise.

1068
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Infamous is huge for Sony.

1069
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
We know that Second Son is going on right now.

1070
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,000
But this is because of a recent Q&A that happened.

1071
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Where there was a Dual Shockers interview with the folks behind Infamous Second Son.

1072
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:40,000
It was the director Nate Fox specifically that I guess got asked some question.

1073
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
But kind of gave a misinterpreted answer.

1074
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:46,000
But he said quote right now we're only talking about the PS4 game.

1075
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:51,000
I would love to talk to you about any Vita related titles when or if the time comes.

1076
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
That still seems a little bit non-committal to me.

1077
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,000
But the reality is Infamous is a huge franchise for Sony.

1078
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
I'm kind of thinking of course there's going to be something for the Vita.

1079
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Of course.

1080
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Even if it's not necessarily the same studio.

1081
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
I mean that's what they did with Uncharted right?

1082
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
I think that they'll have an Infamous game.

1083
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,000
And I can see it coming out around the same time as Second Son too.

1084
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Just because it would be a good tie in.

1085
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:18,000
You could like have like you take your PlayStation 4 character to you know that game or vice versa.

1086
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
I would also think they would try to do like the remote play or something.

1087
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
They would try to tie that feature in as well.

1088
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Did you hear the Final Fantasy XIV is supposed to be getting something like that on PlayStation 4.

1089
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Not to do too tangity but this sounded really awesome.

1090
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,000
That they're talking about doing a remote play for the PlayStation 4 version.

1091
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,000
It would be limited but it would allow you to do things like crafting and stuff.

1092
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
It's pretty cool.

1093
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
I don't see why you couldn't play the game.

1094
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
I mean aside from being able to text chat and stuff.

1095
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
I think it's just a resource.

1096
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Yeah the text chat and some of the other stuff is a resource hog so.

1097
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Just don't text chat. I never text chatted.

1098
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Well I liked having the ability to chat from my phone and wow.

1099
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
True.

1100
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Doing stuff like that.

1101
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
You still can yeah.

1102
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Well yeah but even though I don't have a subscription anymore.

1103
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,000
But I mean I think that having more remote options for doing other stuff in the game.

1104
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Especially you know for things that you're trying to kill time with.

1105
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
I think that's actually pretty good.

1106
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Very interesting rumors coming out of Microsoft with the whole you know their DRM features.

1107
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
That originally rolled out and then they were just kidding.

1108
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
You guys are really mad so we're not going to do that.

1109
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Well according to Xbox director Albert Piniello.

1110
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,000
This ability to trade and loan digital games.

1111
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Which is going to be a part of this whole DRM restriction.

1112
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
It could return at some point.

1113
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,000
I'm not talking about the 24 hour check ins and all this.

1114
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Here's the quote in an interview from GameSpot.

1115
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Quote we were trying to implement the ability to trade and loan digital games with your friends.

1116
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Which is something that no one else was doing.

1117
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:45,000
I believe in retrospect that people have calmed down and gone back and actually looked at what we said.

1118
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:49,000
People are starting to understand wow they did want to actually allow me to loan and trade.

1119
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Which other digital ecosystems don't want to do.

1120
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
And so yeah I think we need to do that.

1121
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:58,000
I get a lot of mails saying God please bring back the family sharing.

1122
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
We'd love to figure out how to bring that back.

1123
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
I still think it was a good idea.

1124
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:05,000
So kind of clinging to that idea that maybe something could come back.

1125
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,000
But I'm assuming that would not include the 24 hour check ins.

1126
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Although as I was saying plenty of times before when this whole mess happened in the first place.

1127
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Why not just have a separate digital license does this stuff and the disc license does this stuff.

1128
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Done!

1129
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Because that would make sense.

1130
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
So silly.

1131
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Peter Molyneux has his new game coming called Godus.

1132
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Not to be confused with the show at the Stardust in a famous movie.

1133
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,000
But that's G-O-D-U-S. Godus is the game.

1134
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Maybe it's Godus.

1135
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Godus. Oh I like that. Godus.

1136
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Godus he was talking about the royalties because the guy who opened the box.

1137
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,000
The curiosity box gets some royalties from the game.

1138
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
But it's not going to be much.

1139
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
It's between 1 and 5 percent.

1140
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
They don't say exactly what it is.

1141
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:53,000
But Godus will have offline play available.

1142
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:58,000
And in his ever so eloquent style Peter Molyneux speaking with RPS Rock Paper Shotgun.

1143
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Mentioned that if he did come out and say that the game would always be online quote.

1144
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,000
This red dot would appear on my forehead and I'd be sniped to death.

1145
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:13,000
He does say though that playing online will allow for these other charming moments.

1146
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Such as syncing with a villagers social feed.

1147
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Isn't that what happens in Tiny Tower?

1148
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Kind of sounds like that.

1149
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,000
He said quote my wife tweets and it comes up in the world.

1150
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
It's a stupid feature. It's just a piece of text.

1151
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:30,000
But you end up caring for your little people because they love you so much.

1152
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Godus will be out on Steam September 13th.

1153
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:39,000
And there will be an iPad version at the end of October and Android version soon after that.

1154
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:43,000
And you can smoke some of the crack that Peter Molyneux is smoking himself.

1155
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:47,000
No in all reality I do kind of want to check it out because I did like black and white.

1156
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I liked Populous from back in the day.

1157
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
So I feel like I should check it out.

1158
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
As soon as that kind of game would be up your alley.

1159
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Yeah it is.

1160
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Especially when I liked Civ so much in the original Sim City.

1161
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:02,000
I mean I do feel like I need to check it out.

1162
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Godus.

1163
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Godus.

1164
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Dark Saga.

1165
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Well we have some Assassin's Creed news.

1166
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:18,000
They basically have for the Vita Assassin's Creed 3 liberation is supposed to be re-released on other systems.

1167
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:23,000
They're looking like PC, PSN and Xbox Live launches.

1168
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Probably likely.

1169
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,000
And also on the list was Assassin's Creed Pirates.

1170
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Excuse me.

1171
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:35,000
And then Ubisoft was also going to have another tie in for Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag.

1172
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,000
So that's for Assassin's Creed fans.

1173
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Good news.

1174
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Also EA has six to eight new IPs going on.

1175
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:49,000
They are going to definitely do more sequels for The Sims.

1176
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
I was watching some of the stuff on Sims 4 stuff.

1177
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:55,000
As long as they fixed that memory issue I might be down for that because I liked some Sims.

1178
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Need for Speed, Battlefield, FIFA.

1179
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Titanfall was the only new name.

1180
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:06,000
But they were also indicating that there's new Star Wars and Mirror's Edge 2.

1181
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:14,000
They are basically working on trying to take the IPs that people like and give them new life.

1182
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Still nothing on another Mass Effect.

1183
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Well, but the team behind the original Mass Effect is doing one of those new IPs. Don't forget.

1184
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,000
I know. That means it won't suck.

1185
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Maybe. Depends on the writing.

1186
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Anyway, and also for fans of Monster Hunter 4, in the direct that came out there are going to be outfits available in the game for Mario, Link and Luigi.

1187
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:48,000
So if you like running around looking like other Nintendo characters you can do it in the new Monster Hunter.

1188
01:39:49,000 --> 01:40:02,000
And they actually said that it appeared in the video that they showed that the Mario and Luigi outfits were for the Mario and Luigi Dream Team outfits.

1189
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:11,000
They have hammers and that the Link outfit has the Master Sword and the bow from Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess.

1190
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Also, you can download the Mario and Luigi costumes at 7-Elevens in Japan, but 7-Elevens in America are not cool enough to do it.

1191
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
The end.

1192
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Well, are we even getting Monster Hunter 4 here? I don't think so.

1193
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Not yet.

1194
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Not yet? Be a little while?

1195
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Probably next year.

1196
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
How did the Wii U Monster Hunter sell? Didn't it do alright?

1197
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Not good, I don't think.

1198
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
That's too bad.

1199
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:41,000
I don't think any Wii U titles sold well already, I mean.

1200
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:45,000
But, yeah, probably not good.

1201
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Alright, we're going to get to the Fugu question of the week. I just want to address real quickly though, because some people in chat were asking if I'm okay.

1202
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Yeah, I'm recovering from Con Crud the sequel.

1203
01:40:54,000 --> 01:41:01,000
When I got back from Dragon Con I felt fine for a couple days, but probably around Thursday it really started to hit me.

1204
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Unlike the Con Crud I got at GamerX, this one didn't come with a fever.

1205
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:11,000
So I haven't had high temperatures, but definitely the coughing, the snifflies, and all that crap.

1206
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:16,000
So if I'm sounding a little out of it tonight, that is why, so I apologize.

1207
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,000
That kind of stuff is really not a Radio Guy's best friend.

1208
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,000
But what can you do? Let's go to the Fugu question of the week.

1209
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Take Facebook, take Google+, smoosh them together, you get Fugu.

1210
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:39,000
And tonight's Fugu question of the week is about the Mighty No. 9 Kickstarter. Don't call it Mega Man.

1211
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:43,000
We talked about it earlier in the show, and here's the question we asked quite plainly.

1212
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Tell us if you back the Kickstarter, or plan to, or not, and why.

1213
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:52,000
We just kind of wanted to know where you guys' heads were at with this.

1214
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Redertainment responded on Google+, and said no, due to my pursuit of Project Buy a House.

1215
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Act Def said, I'm definitely backing this Kickstarter when I get the money.

1216
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,000
I want to do $175 US dollars for the plushie tier.

1217
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:10,000
And well, Inafune wants to give what Mega Man fans want, and I support that.

1218
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,000
And there's an all-star team behind it, so I do have high hopes for it.

1219
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
There's a yes and a no from Google+.

1220
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Let's go over to Fugu, excuse me, Facebook, part of Fugu.

1221
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:26,000
I apologize for the Facebook noises, I really thought I turned those off.

1222
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Going to a comment from Rene, over from Cooper Club.

1223
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:38,000
He says, I didn't back this Kickstarter because I didn't find out about it until just after it met its Kickstarter goal.

1224
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
But now I really want to.

1225
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:46,000
They still got the stretch goals, and for what, another 22 days, you can still basically pre-order the game.

1226
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Elliot B says, considering the talent involved, I reckon this particular Kickstarter is more likely to bear fruit than most.

1227
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:58,000
That said, I never really got quite the appeal of Mega Man, so I guess I'll pass.

1228
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
That's kind of surprising.

1229
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Well, I mean, I shouldn't say it that way.

1230
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:07,000
I mean, some people just don't like certain games that may be popular otherwise, but I find it interesting that he's like,

1231
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,000
yeah, it's a bunch of talented people, but eh, not my type of game.

1232
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Mason D said, HD2D art, the track record of the people involved, it seemed like a no-brainer.

1233
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Bumble D said, I'm going to pre-order the digital copy of the game this weekend.

1234
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:25,000
It reminded me how much time I killed playing Mega Man 1 through 6 back in the NES days.

1235
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:29,000
I recently bought the Mega Man X collection just to re-sharpen my skills for when this comes out.

1236
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Burr replied on Facebook and said, I didn't back this Kickstarter because I knew it would succeed anyway.

1237
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,000
I try to back things that need the push over the finish line.

1238
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:43,000
In this case, I can sit back and wait to see the reviews before taking the plunge.

1239
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:47,000
I'm also a bit apprehensive about supporting something so similar to an existing IP

1240
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:52,000
and wish people would have given attention to a more original idea like Ravensdale.

1241
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:57,000
That's a very interesting perspective where he's kind of saying, or at least what I'm getting out of this is,

1242
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:00,000
these guys didn't need the money.

1243
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Interesting.

1244
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Critical Myth says, no, but I prefer to get opinions on the final product first.

1245
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:12,000
There have been plenty of great ideas that wound up having poor execution or unforeseen roadblocks.

1246
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Raginator says, nope, just because.

1247
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Daniel S. replied and said, I haven't heard of this until just now.

1248
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
And then said, dude, this looks amaze balls.

1249
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,000
A little bit Mega Man and a little bit Meta Bots, I'm in.

1250
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Also, screw Capcom for not letting Inafune make Mega Man games.

1251
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Here's something to think about, though, just to kind of go off of that point a little bit.

1252
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Since you're really excited about how it looks, something to consider is,

1253
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:42,000
if he had been able to make a new Mega Man game, would we have got this?

1254
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
And could this be better?

1255
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Just something to think about.

1256
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Monty Boggs replied on Facebook and said, yes, he backed it,

1257
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:52,000
because I wanted to see the Mega Man games evolve

1258
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:55,000
and I want them to achieve the stretch goal and put it on consoles.

1259
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,000
This should also show Capcom that people want these games

1260
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:02,000
and they've been dropping the ball, otherwise this Kickstarter wouldn't exist or succeed.

1261
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Ryan B. replied and said, no, he didn't back it, though I do want to, because I'm poor.

1262
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Hitstun replied and said, this could be the project that finally gets me to create a Kickstarter account.

1263
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:17,000
I want the game to be good, but I'm on the fence about throwing money at it.

1264
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:21,000
I typically don't buy a game until I see the finished product in motion.

1265
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:24,000
So there's the answers from Facebook and Google Plus.

1266
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,000
And I think you pretty much heard what we had to say about it earlier,

1267
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:33,000
but I thought we would see a lot more of, yes, I was throwing my money at it,

1268
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
I was rubbing my credit card at the screen,

1269
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,000
but I found that there's a lot more of you out there that are kind of like,

1270
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,000
yeah, we'll wait and see when the finished game's out.

1271
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
I'll wait for the reviews. I'll check it out then.

1272
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
They don't need my money right now. I'll give it to them later.

1273
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:48,000
So I was kind of surprised by that, but in a good way.

1274
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,000
So there you go, our FUGL question of the week.

1275
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Let's move on with some more gaming news. Loki.

1276
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:59,000
All right. So let's talk a little bit about disappointment.

1277
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:04,000
And the disappointment I have that such an awesome concept as the Aluma Room is not going to happen.

1278
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:08,000
And it kind of makes sense because I was like, wow, that looks really cool,

1279
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:12,000
but how the hell are they going to pull that off without it being incredibly expensive?

1280
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Well, the problem is they never figured out a way to do that.

1281
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:21,000
So it would cost thousands of dollars at implement because it does require a nice HD projector

1282
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:28,000
and a really specific setup because who has an HD projector attached to the ceiling

1283
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:33,000
and an extra connect sensor attached to that and just not going to work.

1284
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:38,000
So unfortunately, they said, you know, hey, it was a very it's it's very, very cool tech,

1285
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:43,000
but it's like for a consumer, it will requires a projector and things.

1286
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:48,000
It's really super neat if you're in the lab and you've got Microsoft money and you can set this up.

1287
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
But we looked at it for an average consumer. It's like thousands of dollars.

1288
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:55,000
So unfortunately, it's not going to go beyond proof of concept.

1289
01:46:55,000 --> 01:47:01,000
I say right now, but I think later on, maybe when that technology comes down in price a lot,

1290
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:05,000
maybe like in three, four years, we might see something like that.

1291
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:09,000
That's kind of where my head's at, because all technology comes down in price eventually.

1292
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Yes. So it might be thousands of dollars now.

1293
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:17,000
But this is something maybe this is technology we're looking at for the Xbox two or whatever is.

1294
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:21,000
God, I can't believe we're here. We are already talking about the next Xbox.

1295
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:26,000
The new one's not even out yet. But, you know, this could be something that happens with whatever Xbox.

1296
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Just pick a random number to be like Xbox fifty seven or something like that.

1297
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Xbox thirty seven. You'll buy them all in a row.

1298
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:39,000
They stack up in a row to create a giant Voltron.

1299
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:45,000
All right. Well, for those of you that are upgrading to a new Xbox, maybe you'll be happy about these programs.

1300
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:48,000
And we touched on this a little bit in the last show,

1301
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:53,000
but now some more details coming out about who is going to allow you to upgrade to your Xbox one games.

1302
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Cheap Best Buy is one of them.

1303
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Best Buy is going to be rolling out a program that will offer ten dollar next gen upgrades.

1304
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,000
GameStop and Amazon already had these programs in place.

1305
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Eligible games include FIFA 14, Assassin's Creed 4, Black Flag, Call of Duty, Ghost, Battlefield 4 and Watch Dogs.

1306
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,000
This is interesting, though, what you have to do.

1307
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,000
If you purchase one of the games within a set period after its release,

1308
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:21,000
you'll be given a ten dollar coupon to put towards the Xbox one incarnation.

1309
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:28,000
When you want to upgrade, you do the coupon and the game and then Best Buy gives you forty dollar credit,

1310
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,000
reducing the final cost of the Xbox one game to ten dollars.

1311
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
So it's this whole...

1312
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
It seems weird.

1313
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:39,000
It is a little bit weird, but it's like you get the coupon and then you get the value of the trade game and then you...

1314
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:46,000
So if you don't use the coupon, then you get ten dollars off another game later on? Is that how that works?

1315
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,000
I suppose you could do it that way. I don't know.

1316
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
That just seems confusing.

1317
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Well, but then it says towards the game's Xbox one incarnation. I don't know, whatever.

1318
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,000
What if I'm upgrading from say, like, uh...

1319
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
How many people is this really going to affect?

1320
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:04,000
I mean, if it's only for a certain period of time, either you're buying the one this year or you're not.

1321
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:15,000
What if I wanted to upgrade from say, like, you know, I don't know, Disney Planes to like, say, Rise.

1322
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Is that an upgrade that I can do?

1323
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
I don't think you can do that, Loki. I'm sorry to say.

1324
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:25,000
What about like, you know, I don't know, Ben 10 Galactic Racing to Forza 5?

1325
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Because that's technically an upgrade. It's still driving.

1326
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Alright, look, I just wanted to add that the Microsoft store is doing this deal as well.

1327
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:36,000
They will also be doing Xbox One games for $10 when you trade in 360 copies.

1328
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:47,000
The titles include NFL Madden 25, Battlefield 4 Need for Speed Rivals, Call of Duty Ghosts, NBA 2K14, FIFA 14, and Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag.

1329
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:52,000
All you have to do for this one, you bring the game to a Microsoft store and you get the Xbox One copy for $10.

1330
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Just throwing it out there, Watch Dogs not apparently on the list for the Microsoft store.

1331
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:04,000
So if you're going to be participating in these programs for whatever reason, you better look at what games what stores are taking.

1332
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:10,000
So, but now you have, what, three, four options? GameStop, Best Buy, Amazon, Microsoft Store.

1333
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,000
I have one word for the whole thing.

1334
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,000
What?

1335
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Blah!

1336
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Well, yeah, my whole thing is like, either you're getting the one this year or you're not.

1337
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:21,000
If this program continues into next year, alright, well then I get it.

1338
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Yeah, but if it's such that, such a small window, just maybe, I don't know, here's a thought.

1339
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Wait a little bit.

1340
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Like, for example, like, if Grand Theft Auto 5, well, okay, no, that's a bad example because I wouldn't be able to wait for Grand Theft Auto 5.

1341
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:39,000
But let's just say like Saints Row 4 was coming out on the PlayStation 4 or something.

1342
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,000
It'd be like a really super awesome upgraded version or something.

1343
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:50,000
I probably wouldn't have bought the game, you know, on PlayStation, well, I definitely didn't buy it on PlayStation 3.

1344
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:54,000
So why would I, you know, buy one version of the game?

1345
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Or, I mean, it's even worse when they're talking about, like, Assassin's Creed that's literally coming out a month before.

1346
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Just wait and just pay, you know, pay the same amount of money that you would have bought, you know, the current gen version for.

1347
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Alright, let's move on with some new game news, right, DarkSakura?

1348
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Yes, we do have some new game news.

1349
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:23,000
A, DungeonMuster just said, actually in chat, that ShameStop dropped the price for Xenoblade down to 65 bucks.

1350
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,000
What a deal!

1351
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
$65, that's still...

1352
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Could that, you're telling me nobody was buying it for 90 because they were just all downloading it from the internet?

1353
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,000
I mean, just saying.

1354
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:41,000
There's a new battle arena game online and it's King of Fighters.

1355
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Hmm.

1356
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Very weird.

1357
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:51,000
It's actually in a closed beta in Thailand and I hate Destructoid, sorry, on my tablet, I hate it on my tablet.

1358
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
I like this site, I hate it on my tablet.

1359
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Fix your tablet version, seriously.

1360
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,000
And yeah, it's a MOBA.

1361
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:02,000
They've done some weird stuff with, you know, King of Fighters.

1362
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Remember that they had a SHMUP game that was with King of Fighters?

1363
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Yes, that was awesome though.

1364
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
It's weird though, I mean...

1365
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Well, so far the characters that are revealed have been Kyo, Iori, Joe, Griffin, and Terry.

1366
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
So, and it's being developed by Dragonfly.

1367
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:26,000
It's kind of cute in a way because, you know, you look at a game like League of Legends, it's all about the heroes, and you have to select one of the heroes, right?

1368
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Or the stupid Marvel game.

1369
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,000
A fighting game lends itself very well to that.

1370
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Yeah.

1371
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Well, the Marvel game's more like a Diablo dungeon crawler than it is a MOBA.

1372
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,000
It's not all that fun.

1373
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,000
MOBA's a very kind of growing genre of games though.

1374
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:48,000
You know, you have League of Legends, then you have DOTA is the other big one, and now you've seen some more pop up, like the heroes in New Earth is one.

1375
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
You know, there's more and more, so...

1376
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Because League of Legends does very well.

1377
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Lots and lots of people play in that game or have played it at some point, so...

1378
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Yeah, as long as they've changed their passwords now.

1379
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Remember, they were going after old data, so the password could be used other places.

1380
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
That is very true, be careful.

1381
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:10,000
So, wow, I wish I could try this out at least, but just have to wait for it to float its way over here from Thailand.

1382
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Oh well.

1383
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Through the inner tubes, through unofficial translation patches.

1384
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,000
The same way the rest of us played Ragnarok back in the day.

1385
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Who would be your hero in a King of Fighter MOBA?

1386
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
It'd be Leona.

1387
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
That's who I play every time I play the damn game.

1388
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Mine would have to be Kim Kap Wan, because that's who I loved in the game, or of course Mai.

1389
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Yeah, what is your dream team?

1390
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,000
That was always my team.

1391
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Of three?

1392
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Yeah.

1393
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,000
And a striker.

1394
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Kim Kap Wan, Mai, and Joe Higashi.

1395
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Who would be your striker?

1396
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:47,000
I forget, who are the strikers?

1397
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:52,000
You can pick any character as a striker, because you're a call-in person.

1398
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
I'm thinking...

1399
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:02,000
I don't know, come back, I always think about, I always go back to CVS.

1400
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Answer hazy, try again later.

1401
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
I always go back to CVS and think about that.

1402
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Shit, I don't know, Andy Bogard.

1403
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,000
I liked Andy.

1404
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:17,000
My team was always Leona, Mai, and Athena.

1405
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Of course, a girl power team.

1406
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Or Yuri, with one of them being a striker.

1407
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:26,000
So I would go between, because Yuri had the fine butt attack.

1408
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Was King in King of Fighters?

1409
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Yes, King was in King of Fighters.

1410
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,000
That would be my striker, I liked King.

1411
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,000
King was awesome.

1412
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Alright.

1413
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,000
What about you, Loki?

1414
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,000
I never played the game.

1415
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,000
See?

1416
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,000
What?

1417
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
It was free on PlayStation Plus, one of the newer ones.

1418
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Yeah, so I checked it out a while back.

1419
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Anyway.

1420
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Loki, what do you got for us?

1421
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Alright, so I've got some Kickstarter information.

1422
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:56,000
It's kind of a combination of Kickstarter and Ouya.

1423
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:01,000
So Ouya's got this, I don't know what you'd call it, campaign that they're doing right now,

1424
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
called the Free the Games campaign.

1425
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Basically, they're offering a million dollars, or they have this million dollar fund,

1426
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:15,000
that they are matching Kickstarter, or Kickstarted games for the Ouya.

1427
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:19,000
They're matching them up to, I think, $50,000.

1428
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Might be more than that.

1429
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:27,000
But basically, the stipulations are that the game has to be exclusively for the Ouya.

1430
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:31,000
It has to have a minimum goal of $50,000.

1431
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:41,000
And I think that, I want to say that $50,000 might have been the, I think it actually goes up from there.

1432
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:45,000
I think $50,000 is not the cap on that.

1433
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
But anyway, so they're going to match funding.

1434
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Well, two games so far have reached their funding targets.

1435
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:57,000
This game called Gridiron Thunder and Elementary My Dear Homes.

1436
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Well, there's a little bit of a problem with that.

1437
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:06,000
The two games, as a lot of people were kind of looking at, had some fishy information regarding them.

1438
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:14,000
For example, Gridiron Thunder, which is a football game, had several backers.

1439
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:25,000
They had basically less backers than were on, like for example, less backers than there were, the money funded.

1440
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:33,000
So it would have basically averaged out to about $626 per backer, would have been the average price.

1441
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:39,000
So there was backers on there that were pledging tens of thousands of dollars at a time.

1442
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:47,000
And you could see it, even if you look at Kick Track, you can see these spike days that they like earned $40,000 or something on it.

1443
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:52,000
And that was a little fishy, being that, you know, basically the thought is,

1444
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:57,000
okay, so there's a guy who creates a Kickstarter, you know, has people back it or whatever.

1445
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Who matches that and then they take the money and run, kind of thing.

1446
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Well, it's even gone further. Elementary My Dear Homes had a bunch of fake, or I should say,

1447
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:17,000
made up people that were one time backers that were backing this project, including made up characters, celebrities,

1448
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:23,000
a person that's been kidnapped, and just all sorts of weird stuff.

1449
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Is that interference from people related to the game, or is that like a 4chan prank?

1450
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:37,000
I think it's people that are related to the game that are backing their own projects so that they put basically,

1451
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:46,000
okay, the project's $50,000, I put in $50,000 of my own money, I get 10% of that taken out or whatever from Kickstarter and Amazon.

1452
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:49,000
And I get another $50,000 from Ouya.

1453
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Oh, this is one of those, I gotta make sure I meet my goals. Well, then go Indiegogo.

1454
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Well, here's the thing though, it's not that, it's they're getting money matched from Ouya.

1455
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:05,000
And what they're gonna do basically is they're getting free money and then they're going to either create a really shoddy game,

1456
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:10,000
you know, or they're just gonna take the money and leave, you know, type thing.

1457
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:15,000
So, however, the Elementary My Dear Homes has been suspended.

1458
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:26,000
It hit its funding goal of $50,000 and it was currently at $58,770 and it's been suspended because of suspicious accounts.

1459
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:32,000
So yeah, so it sounds like, you know, they were trying to scam it.

1460
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:35,000
And there's a lot of conspiracy theories about it.

1461
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:39,000
They're saying, well, it's, I'm not so sure about the Elementary My Dear Homes one,

1462
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:47,000
but the other one that Ouya is actually kicking money in there because they want to make it look like these games are being successful and stuff.

1463
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:55,000
And I don't know, it's weird, but yeah, Kickstarter, there's a lot of shady stuff that goes on there.

1464
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,000
You don't say.

1465
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Yeah, and speaking of-

1466
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:00,000
When there's a way to make money on the internet, shady things happen, get out.

1467
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Yeah, I know. Speaking of which, remember how I talked about, it was months ago, about that nine-year-old-

1468
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:06,000
I have to say this real quick.

1469
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,000
sj100mattinchat at live.vognetwork.com says,

1470
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:14,000
heaven help us if the Nigerian internet scammers make it to Kickstarter unless they're already there.

1471
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Well, speaking of internet scams.

1472
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Yes, speaking of scams, there was, remember that nine-year-old, there was a Kickstarter,

1473
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:26,000
it was that nine-year-old wants to make her first RPG because her brother said that she can't do this and this whole STEM thing.

1474
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:32,000
I went into detail about it, about how she didn't really need the money because her mom's like a millionaire,

1475
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:37,000
and that's beside the point, but she said originally it was to go to this RPG camp,

1476
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:42,000
and then the camp was canceled, so she was going to MIT or something.

1477
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Oh, now the money's for a laptop.

1478
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Oh, well, then she got a laptop gifted to her from Alienware and Dell.

1479
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Oh, well, now the money's for something, and it was an RPG Maker game.

1480
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Well, guess what? The date that that game was supposed to be released came and gone,

1481
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:02,000
and no real updates, and they've kind of all disappeared.

1482
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,000
So, once again, people called it a scam.

1483
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:08,000
They got called out, the creators called them trolls.

1484
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:12,000
All the internet people that ran it, Kotaku and some other ones,

1485
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:18,000
defended the Kickstarter people and said, oh, yeah, all those people that are ganging up against that nine-year-old,

1486
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:21,000
they're just trolling them and stuff like that.

1487
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Well, are they out here now to say that, well, maybe they were right because they didn't come up with anything.

1488
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:31,000
No, because it failing isn't newsworthy.

1489
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:34,000
No, it didn't fail. They succeeded.

1490
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,000
I mean, sorry, it failing to produce isn't newsworthy.

1491
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Yes, so basically she got $28,000 for doing nothing.

1492
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
So, yeah.

1493
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Wow. Well, hope it pays for college and not for, you know, trips to Headey.

1494
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
I want someone to pay for my college.

1495
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Wouldn't that be nice?

1496
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Yeah, really.

1497
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:59,000
I want someone to pay for me to get additional classes in my profession. That would be nice.

1498
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:02,000
All right, let's move on with another story.

1499
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Well, somebody's going to be getting a lot of money, and that's, I wouldn't mind having $15 million in damages,

1500
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:13,000
and that is a lawsuit with Microsoft versus Motorola Mobility.

1501
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:17,000
This is a long-running lawsuit surrounding patent infringement.

1502
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Jury ruled in favor of Microsoft.

1503
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Microsoft gets $15 million because the Xbox 360 console, it was ruled last year,

1504
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:30,000
it infringed on four of Motorola's patents surrounding video decoding, Wi-Fi technology.

1505
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:36,000
But earlier this year, that decision was overturned, and the same judge cleared Microsoft of the infringement.

1506
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Now, a district court jury decided that it was Motorola that breached its agreements with Microsoft.

1507
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Because Motorola was not providing the patent licenses for fair and reasonable terms, this is why Microsoft got the damages.

1508
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:55,000
I can't imagine that this is going to be over by any stretch of the imagination.

1509
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Is this shit going to go to the Supreme Court? Is that what's going to happen?

1510
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
I'm really surprised the two didn't settle.

1511
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
That's what always happens in this shit. There's always a settlement.

1512
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Yeah, I went to jury, and the jury awarded it to Microsoft, saying that, nope, it's Motorola's fault because they weren't allowing Microsoft to have it reasonably.

1513
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:14,000
I'm sure this is not the last of it.

1514
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:22,000
No, probably not. I think, in some cases, trying to push things through to an actual jury trial is a way to set a precedent.

1515
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Yeah.

1516
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Alright. Well, we're going to allow you to set some precedents on our show right now with the emails that you send us.

1517
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Every week you guys send us mailbags, or not, to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1518
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Bags of mails? Ooh.

1519
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:43,000
So Dark Soccer's going to jump in the mailbag and see the flood of email awaiting us tonight.

1520
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:47,000
More like the drippy one.

1521
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
In the two weeks we were off...

1522
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Yeah, we got one email.

1523
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:56,000
And I'm saying drippy not because of the person, but because it's like, drip, drip, drip.

1524
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:01,000
You open the bag to dump it out and one little email came floating down.

1525
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Hi everyone at OLR.

1526
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Hi.

1527
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Rob.

1528
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
What? The listeners say hi, I gotta say hi back.

1529
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Do you paraphrase Final Fantasy VII since you love it so much?

1530
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Sit your ass down in that chair and eat your goddamn Ricola.

1531
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Hearts, hearts.

1532
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:22,000
I actually came with like a bucket of Ricolas and...

1533
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
I'm actually very thankful.

1534
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
It's your favorite person in the whole world.

1535
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
He did a face.

1536
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Raginator.

1537
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:36,000
As you probably remember, Sony officially retired the PS2 earlier this year after a 12 year...

1538
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Well, he said ear run, but I think he means ear.

1539
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:45,000
I think it's safe to say that in terms of the last gen systems, the PS2 was the leading favorite and most people had it.

1540
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:51,000
Either as a primary console or a secondary, or even just as a DVD player that just so happened to play games.

1541
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:56,000
All that being said, I'd like to pose a question to the three of you and to the chat room as well.

1542
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Those of you who had a PS2, do you have any fond memories revolving around the PS2 and if so, what were they?

1543
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Getting my JPS2 and playing the hell out of Beatmania 2DX?

1544
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:12,000
You stole my damn answer. I would say getting the Japanese PlayStation 2, which I owned before a US PlayStation 2, and playing the shit out of Beatmania 2DX.

1545
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Bam.

1546
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Fist bump.

1547
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Yep.

1548
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Loki, PlayStation 2 memories?

1549
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Uh...

1550
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:23,000
I'm my HD loader in the...

1551
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Actually, I'd say... when was the first thing I got on PlayStation 2?

1552
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:31,000
Well, I got Armored Core was one of the first games in there.

1553
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
I'd say probably like, uh...

1554
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Grand Theft Auto... well, that was PlayStation 1.

1555
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:41,000
No, no, that was PlayStation 2. Grand Theft Auto 3?

1556
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Yeah, Vice City and all that was PlayStation 2.

1557
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Yeah.

1558
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Goddammit.

1559
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Don't die.

1560
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Also, playing music games online with DDR and Amplitude was good times.

1561
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
You know what I did like?

1562
02:04:53,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Not having to do the button trick every time I wanted to put in that pen CD for Beatmania.

1563
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:04,000
So it was actually a way to play my old 5-key Beatmania stuff.

1564
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:11,000
I also just had... well, you know how many import PlayStation 1 games I had.

1565
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
It was nice not having to rely on a separate device.

1566
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:16,000
We'd just have to change the plugs and bam, there it was, you know.

1567
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:18,000
But, um...

1568
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Yeah, I really... I really have to say I had a lot...

1569
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Even though I still laugh my ass off to this day with the Dreamcast vs. PS2 video that was online.

1570
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
What a disappointment video.

1571
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,000
You remember that one?

1572
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:34,000
I do. You've done it as a cookie here on the shelves before, yeah.

1573
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:35,000
That was great.

1574
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
So, um... moving on.

1575
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Now, as a secondary closing topic, I'd like to get some information from you three if possible.

1576
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,000
Well, that's what we do a show for.

1577
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:44,000
We charge.

1578
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
By the hour.

1579
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:49,000
I've been mulling over some notion of starting my own business,

1580
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:55,000
specifically an arcade that primarily focuses on games spanning from the late 1970s to the early 2000s,

1581
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:59,000
with a few music games like DDR thrown in for good measure for a good 10 years now.

1582
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:04,000
The main hurdle is that I know virtually nothing about the subject of starting up and running a business.

1583
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:08,000
I know that there are some basics, like having to lease retail space, pay for utilities,

1584
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:13,000
needing to incorporate the business, possibly filing for either loans and or grants,

1585
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:18,000
buying necessities for the business in case of PC for business purposes, and of course the arcade games.

1586
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
But that's the extent of what I know.

1587
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:23,000
That being said, what advice can you give regarding this?

1588
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:28,000
And yes, I know that arcades are pretty much dead, but I'm confident that I can make this work.

1589
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Any info that you have would be provided would be greatly appreciated, and thank you in advance.

1590
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:36,000
This email is brought to you by Mr. Hanky the Christmas Poo. Hey!

1591
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:40,000
I will give some very blunt, frank advice with the whole business.

1592
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:44,000
I've never started a business, so I honestly couldn't tell you like some insider secret.

1593
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
We've run one. Dan and I have.

1594
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Well, this is my advice. Maybe you will agree or you won't agree.

1595
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:54,000
My advice is you need to take a class or read a book on starting your own business,

1596
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:58,000
and if you don't have the time to do that or the money to do that, then you don't have the time or the money to start your own business.

1597
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Exactly. That being said, Dan went into business with the lady that used to be one of the owners of video game swappers locally here.

1598
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:12,000
And so in that case, there was already the space. There was already the inventory.

1599
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:17,000
We put up a lot of our own games, too. All of our Dragon Ball Z figures, my old manga.

1600
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
We sold a lot of our own stuff.

1601
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:25,000
The big thing is that if you've got the space and the stuff in that you need to get the business license,

1602
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:29,000
and before you need the business license, you need to look up what the local laws are.

1603
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:33,000
You need to make sure that you don't have to have just a county business license.

1604
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:37,000
You may have to have a city license.

1605
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:41,000
For me as a massage therapist, I had to have a county and city license.

1606
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
In some cases, you need a state license.

1607
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:46,000
So like I said, I've been on multiple sides of this.

1608
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:49,000
I agree with Rob. You should really take a business class.

1609
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:52,000
In some cases, a lot of it is fairly common sense.

1610
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:56,000
You can figure it out if you've got that kind of logical mind,

1611
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:01,000
but you really do need to know the legalities of it before you remotely put down any money,

1612
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
before you remotely look for any sponsors.

1613
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:06,000
We're still trying to start VOG as a legitimate business

1614
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
so we can do some of these things like sell t-shirts

1615
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
and some of the other things you guys have been asking for,

1616
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:13,000
and it's not easy to make sure we do it right.

1617
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Especially in our case, we're looking at a multinational type of thing.

1618
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:22,000
There's a lot of stuff that goes into it,

1619
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:28,000
but you're going to have to have your fictitious name for your business.

1620
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:33,000
It's the name that goes on your business license, and then it is registered to you.

1621
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:38,000
From that point on, any of your accounts are going to be registered in that fictitious name,

1622
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:43,000
being your bank account, being any savings associated with it, paying your taxes.

1623
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:46,000
You're going to need an accountant, that's for damn sure.

1624
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:50,000
It's a lot of money that goes into running a business, and I don't suggest doing it by yourself.

1625
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Yeah, that's great advice too. Find a business partner.

1626
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:58,000
Just be careful with that idea. A lot of people lose a lot of money on that.

1627
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Arcades are dying, and you're not going to save them alone.

1628
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:04,000
But if you have a good idea, you never know what might happen.

1629
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:08,000
What's going to be the thing that draws people to your arcade when they can play games at home?

1630
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Is that going to be that you do kick-ass birthday parties?

1631
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Do you sell booze?

1632
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
That's what Dave & Buster's is doing.

1633
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Well, that's what a lot of these retro arcades do.

1634
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Well, the other thing to also, and this just occurred to me too, is that especially in regards to...

1635
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
God, I forgot what I was going to say.

1636
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Because I know it's a big thing too, is you need to make sure that not only do you check with the legality behind it,

1637
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:39,000
you also check with not just the legality behind getting the license,

1638
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:43,000
but the legalities around how you handle your money with the place.

1639
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Keep in mind that any, I think the rule of thumb is that any business is expected to lose money in its first five years before it turns a profit.

1640
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:55,000
Also check with your local, you know, wherever you have to register through.

1641
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:59,000
There are first-time business startup plans that can help you with this.

1642
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:06,000
A lot of places have a complete checklist on their, you know, be it county, be it city website, that's going to show you what to do.

1643
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:13,000
So you've got the information out there, but I think you've done a lot of research clearly.

1644
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:21,000
I think the best thing for you to do is look at everything that you need, make yourself an outline, and make yourself a timeline.

1645
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:27,000
And make sure that you have, that if there's any cost associated with whatever is coming up on your timeline,

1646
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:30,000
that you have that money by then, and that you've got some extra.

1647
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Now fifth dream in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, there's a novel idea, arcade and strippers.

1648
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Now that's something that hasn't been done, that could have, but then again, a whole other set of laws that come when you have titties out in the open.

1649
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
I will tell you this, you know, it's incredibly stupid.

1650
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:46,000
What?

1651
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Is that in San Francisco, if I was going to be a massage therapist there, I would actually have to have an adult entertainment license.

1652
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
To do massage.

1653
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:55,000
So you could do topless massage?

1654
02:10:55,000 --> 02:11:04,000
No. They treat, this is so stupid, they treat the massage, the massage and holistic health industry as adult entertainment.

1655
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
So fucking stupid.

1656
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:10,000
It's not like there's any shortage of adult entertainment in San Francisco.

1657
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:14,000
It's the whole happy ending thing that's ruined it for all of us.

1658
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:18,000
They talked about that day one in massage school. I can't do it anymore because of my hand.

1659
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Aww, happy ending?

1660
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
No!

1661
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
You're so mean. Alright, is that it for the email?

1662
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:28,000
I like the video where the happy ending is just parties and clapping.

1663
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Yes, me too.

1664
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:30,000
That was funny.

1665
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:35,000
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to give Jamie some work for a future week.

1666
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:40,000
In the meantime though, it's time for the FUs of the Week.

1667
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Why? I don't know.

1668
02:11:52,000 --> 02:12:08,000
I have a big FU to the person who was driving the not so fresh El Camino in the rain the other day on my street, zipped around the corner and nearly ran into Dan's car.

1669
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:15,000
So yeah, don't speed on the damn road when it's raining. Don't speed through a neighborhood.

1670
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:20,000
You are the lowest of low. There's a special place in hell for you if I believed in hell.

1671
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:25,000
And you know what? I might just believe in hell for the vague reason that you might go there.

1672
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
You're gonna make an exception.

1673
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
I'll make an exception.

1674
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:35,000
Uh, FU to having to coordinate shipping Grand Theft Auto V.

1675
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:45,000
As much as I can't wait to play the game, it's gonna be a fucking nightmare. It's like Call of Duty two times this year instead of once.

1676
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:56,000
My FU of the Week goes to being sick again from a convention. It's not like I don't wash my hands and drink vitamin C and all the things you're supposed to do.

1677
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:57,000
It's all the other people that don't.

1678
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Yeah, it's all the other people. That's what it is. Other people's fault. Never my fault.

1679
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Rob. What?

1680
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:09,000
You do know the theory goes that doing all of those extra preventative measures might actually weaken your immune system to fighting off colds?

1681
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Weren't you the one telling me to take zinc when I went?

1682
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:20,000
I was telling you to take zinc, but regardless of that, you know, people rely on that stuff too much instead of making themselves stronger.

1683
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:23,000
I just wouldn't say an FU to being sick. It's awfully inconvenient.

1684
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:29,000
Instead of washing your hands when you get done at the con, you just lick them clean. And then you'll feel much better later on.

1685
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
You're such an asshole.

1686
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:35,000
I'm serious. This is really draining me. I'm really having to push to finish the show tonight.

1687
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:41,000
Thank God we only have two more stories and then we get into Twitter topics and calls and then we're done.

1688
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Don't get me wrong. I love doing this show and I love all you guys that turn out to listen.

1689
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
I should have brought you some soup, Rob. I'm sorry.

1690
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Oh no. Why would you apologize for not buying me something?

1691
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Because I do nice stuff for people and I feel bad when it occurs to me after the fact.

1692
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:00,000
You know what I'm going to do right now? I'm going to go fix myself an emergency while Loki does this next story.

1693
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Okay.

1694
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:09,000
So that oft rumor that, hey, there's going to be another TimeSplitters game is finally true.

1695
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:14,000
There is going to be another TimeSplitters game. It's not going to be new necessarily. It's TimeSplitters Rewind.

1696
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:22,000
It's basically a, I guess they're saying the ragtag team of fans constructing the game.

1697
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:27,000
And they're going to start on developing a PlayStation 4 version of the game.

1698
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:34,000
And they said, you know, we actually are going to go ahead and start development of TimeSplitters Rewind on PlayStation 4.

1699
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:38,000
We're pretty confident Crytek's going to say go ahead and do it.

1700
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:45,000
But we don't want them saying go ahead and do it when we're caught with our pants down.

1701
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Like we're halfway through development.

1702
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:54,000
So Crytek, I guess they've approved the PC version of the game.

1703
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:58,000
And I guess that's going through some testing right now as well.

1704
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:04,000
But not really approved, I guess, the PlayStation 4 version yet.

1705
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:08,000
But hey, I don't care. PC version's good enough for me.

1706
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
Kids like PCs.

1707
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:14,000
Exactly. So, I don't know.

1708
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:21,000
You know, TimeSplitters kind of HD, I guess, with all the crazy stuff in there.

1709
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
I could dig that.

1710
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Oh, thank you. DarkSakura's giving me more Ricola.

1711
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
I'm saving away from my ride home.

1712
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:30,000
You're taking pity on me.

1713
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:34,000
Trust me, I buy huge, massive bags of Ricolas.

1714
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
I would feel guilty if I got one of you guys sick, though.

1715
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:39,000
But I've got to be past that point. I never really had a fever.

1716
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:44,000
But anyhow, Final Fantasy VI.

1717
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:47,000
I know we talked earlier about Final Fantasy VII being the anniversary.

1718
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Oh, actually, sorry. We did that during the music break, so the podcasters didn't hear that.

1719
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:54,000
But Final Fantasy VII is 17 years old as of yesterday, right?

1720
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:58,000
But one game that's still near and dear to people's hearts is Final Fantasy VI.

1721
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:05,000
And what's interesting is that there's a fan-made Final Fantasy VI movie being made.

1722
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:08,000
It's called Final Fantasy Terra.

1723
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:13,000
And it's being made, you know, for an amateur film, it's pretty well-made, you know?

1724
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:17,000
It's amazing what people can do with their phones and HD cameras.

1725
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
I don't think anyone needs filming that with their phones.

1726
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:23,000
You know what I mean, though? But I'm just saying in general, you have HD cameras on your phone,

1727
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:29,000
you know, just spend another thousand or two dollars and you get these fancy cameras that are capable of a lot.

1728
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:35,000
So anyway, the group that's producing it is Bad Pixel, and there's actually a trailer that's out there that you can see.

1729
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:42,000
They are actually pitching the idea to Square Enix to try to get permission to proceed with development.

1730
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:47,000
If that is successful, they're going to turn to Kickstarter to raise the funds to actually make the film.

1731
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:53,000
There's a whole part about Square Enix screenlining it, though. I don't think that's going to happen in a million years. Sorry.

1732
02:16:53,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Well, at least they're going the correct route instead of let's go ahead and do it on Kickstarter and wait for it to get shut down.

1733
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:01,000
Right.

1734
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Rather than, you know, let's ask permission first and then...

1735
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Right. So, yeah, at least they're going about it that way.

1736
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:15,000
But, yeah, I just, you know, when they shut down that Chrono Trigger remake project and, you know, they're very protective of their IPs.

1737
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:21,000
I just kind of don't see this happening. You know, they want to do...they have, what, Advent Children.

1738
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:26,000
They have the spirits within. They kind of want to make their movies animated, and I don't know, they just...

1739
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Final Fantasy VI is a pretty precious franchise, and I think it's still due for a remake at some point, isn't it?

1740
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:41,000
Because V got its remake on iOS. Shouldn't VI get something? Maybe they're saving it for something big. Who knows?

1741
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:49,000
But, good luck to these guys. I'm not saying I don't want to see it happen, but I just...I don't know.

1742
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:55,000
I just kind of think Square Enix isn't going to give it permission, but props to you guys for creating the impressive trailer that you did.

1743
02:17:55,000 --> 02:18:04,000
That is our last story for tonight, so that's the point where we're going to open up our Skype line and see if we get any calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

1744
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Again, that's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, on Skype.

1745
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:17,000
We do still have the 800 number as well. 1-877-GAME-OLR, or of course, again, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

1746
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:24,000
So that is open now for your calls. If you want to talk to us about anything we've talked about tonight, or possibly a different topic, we will get to that.

1747
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:28,000
In the meantime, last minute stories. I don't know if we have anything, Loki?

1748
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Nah, I don't have anything.

1749
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Really?

1750
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:31,000
At least not yet.

1751
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:34,000
I think we covered a lot of stuff during the show.

1752
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Yeah, there's just not a whole ton of new stuff right now.

1753
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:45,000
Especially no stories about Grand Theft Auto 5 leaking out there on the internet, unfortunately.

1754
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Oh, has it leaked?

1755
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:50,000
No, I said it has not. Unfortunately it has not, yeah.

1756
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:55,000
Alright, well I do have a few, oh, we have a call coming in, so let's go to it.

1757
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:58,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1758
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:02,000
This is Ron Moon. We're going to make sure the Skype line does not crap out on anybody tonight.

1759
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Let's hope.

1760
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Hang up after a few seconds.

1761
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:08,000
I know, you gotta last 20 seconds to beat your call into Bobby's show. What's up?

1762
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Not much. I have my stopwatch ready, but Rob, as someone who's been going to cons for about 15 years,

1763
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:18,000
I'm going to give you a basic homemade remedy that should fix things up for you.

1764
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:19,000
Okay.

1765
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:31,000
Black tea, two shots of honey, a bit of lemon, a little shot of vodka, half a shot, and two tablespoons of tussin. You'll be fine.

1766
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Ugh, tussin, ugh.

1767
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Actually, just raw honey is really, really good for all that. Raw honey.

1768
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:47,000
I've been trying to drink tea, so yeah, no, I don't, man, it's just weird that it's happening after every convention that I go to, so I just, yeah, irritating.

1769
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Well, the more conventions you go to, your comp plague immunity builds up, so.

1770
02:19:54,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Yeah, I guess that's true. Well, congrats, you made it a full minute, so apparently it was your connection with Bobby

1771
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:04,000
that was not appreciated by Skype. What else is on your mind, buddy?

1772
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:10,000
I want to go back to about two weeks ago when I called you out by accident about DuckTales.

1773
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Yeah.

1774
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:17,000
Okay. I mean, I understand your issues with the game, with the sound and the cutscenes and so forth.

1775
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:26,000
I mean, personally, I guess because I bought it for, I got it for PS3, I didn't have any issues with the sound, the voices, but with the cinematic sequences,

1776
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:34,000
I really enjoyed it. It felt like as if I was just watching, like, a five-part miniseries just as I'm going through every stage.

1777
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Yeah, I mean, I didn't, I think at the end of the day, I did recommend the game. I just kind of thought, like, there wasn't enough action before those sequences would consistently break things up.

1778
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:51,000
That was one thing that kind of irritated me, and I guess in some regards, that is true, the NES version had some of that too,

1779
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:58,000
but I don't know, it just felt like the action kept being interrupted on the newer one. That was just what really bugged me.

1780
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:04,000
I guess, but I do remember from the original NES game, there were maybe about two or three cutscenes.

1781
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:10,000
All the cutscenes just turned into, like, a brand-new movie or something, and as I'm playing through the game, I'm like,

1782
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:15,000
I remember this area, that area, I know what's over there, this, this, this, this, and that,

1783
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:20,000
and I noticed, like, the extra perks that they threw in and stuff like that make the game awesome.

1784
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:27,000
Sound production issues aside, it is a great love letter to the cartoon that many people grew up on,

1785
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:35,000
so I can see why people that really loved DuckTales growing up, which, by the way, was a cartoon I didn't watch as much of as some of my peers,

1786
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:40,000
I can see why you've got to play this game at least once.

1787
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Yeah, my only issue is the fact that I had to go to Shame Stop to pick up the Collector's Edition.

1788
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Come to find out that certain target locations had it.

1789
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Oh.

1790
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Mm-hmm.

1791
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
But at least you got the pin.

1792
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
Yes, I did, and it's sitting on my shelf in the case.

1793
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Next time you go to a Disney park, you can wear it.

1794
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:58,000
Damn right.

1795
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:59,000
There you go.

1796
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:04,000
All right, well, Rama, buddy, any other comments or questions for us tonight?

1797
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:09,000
Quick funny thing, this was at my old job, and my supervisor was a big DuckTales fan,

1798
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:15,000
and he would repeat this line from one of the episodes where Scrooge was losing his mind about a sea monster ate his ice cream.

1799
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:19,000
I turned around and looked at him and was, that was not his, this is along the lines of,

1800
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:22,000
that was a sea monster, that was half his fortune.

1801
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
He looked at me crazy, I'm like, go to YouTube.

1802
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:29,000
He pulled up that episode, and that was the follow-up line to it, and he just gave me this look of how do you know that,

1803
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:34,000
and I'm like, I have this odd tendency for odd pop culture cartoons and references like that.

1804
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:41,000
Come on, I'm sure they screen DuckTales at 3 a.m. at some anime conventions, you get high and watch some, come on.

1805
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:48,000
No, the only time you get high at anime conventions is somebody's doing Anime Hell Knight or something like that,

1806
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:54,000
and you just sit there and you just lose your effing mind, and you chant for blue screen over and over.

1807
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Oh my gosh.

1808
02:22:55,000 --> 02:23:00,000
Rob, there are stories. We will have to talk offline, but I have some stories for you.

1809
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:05,000
I'm sure, and they can, the listeners can hear some of those stories on Anime Jam Session.

1810
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Yes, and we're getting ready for our very first 21-plus anime convention this weekend.

1811
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Ooh, that sounds like it might be fun.

1812
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:20,000
I have been told it's okay to walk around, um, bottomless, topless, alcohol without alcohol, because we have our own private beach.

1813
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Where the hell is this being held, Nevada?

1814
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:25,000
No, uh, Provincetown, Massachusetts.

1815
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Oh, yeah, alright, yeah, makes sense. P-Town.

1816
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
I get told that too.

1817
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Yeah, let me put it this way, I've never even been there, but I want to go.

1818
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
I've heard a lot about it.

1819
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Alice, you join us next year.

1820
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:54,000
We'll see, oh my god, my con budget, I'm like, between PAX East, uh, the Gamer X2, E3 hopefully, and Dragon Con 2014, I'm busy, bro.

1821
02:23:54,000 --> 02:24:08,000
Dude, don't even get me started on PAX East. I am ready with, my staff knows as soon as they hear about the hotels, you call, text, tweet, whatever, so I can jump to a computer and shank somebody for two rooms at the Westin.

1822
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:18,000
Well, I'm praying that at least one of the VoG guys is able to get a room, and I can piggyback on that, because I'm pretty sure Travis and Bobby and Brad will all be hammering the phones the day those open up, so.

1823
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:21,000
Remember, I'm also Team VoG, I got you, remember.

1824
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:22,000
Alright.

1825
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:23,000
I get the rooms, it comes to us first.

1826
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:28,000
Oh, sorry, I was talking about Dragon Con, but yes, PAX East, PAX East, I will look you up, buddy.

1827
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Hell yeah, man.

1828
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Alright, I should let you go to get more calls, but take care, and everybody check out Anime Jam Session now, immediately following Electric Sisterhood, Tuesdays at VoG.

1829
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:39,000
Alright, take care, buddy.

1830
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:40,000
Alright, later.

1831
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:41,000
Bye.

1832
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:47,000
1877 Game OLR, or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1833
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
And give us a call.

1834
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
A couple tweets I'm getting here.

1835
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Let's see, some tweets from Tigerclaw tonight.

1836
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:58,000
EA to close Battleforge next month.

1837
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:03,000
Battleforge is one of EA's studios, and they are sadly going to be closed.

1838
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
I'm trying to bring up the story to see what they made.

1839
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Oh, they were Play for Free.

1840
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
Where are these guys?

1841
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:11,000
That's too bad.

1842
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:16,000
I'm trying to see what games they made, but I don't see anything in the list here, but they are closing at the end of October.

1843
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:21,000
Never good to hear about people losing their jobs, so our thoughts go out to them.

1844
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Tigerclaw sends us one more tweet about the Halo designer calling out Hideo Kojima over the sexy comments.

1845
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Oh god, did you hear about Kojima's sexy comments?

1846
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
Because it was creating quite the stir.

1847
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:41,000
About Metal Gear Solid 5 and how Quiet needed to be more erotic so more people would cosplay her for Tokyo Game Show.

1848
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Really?

1849
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:45,000
Yeah, he kind of put his foot in his mouth with that comment.

1850
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:54,000
Kojima clarified with Polygon later he meant to say sexy, not erotic.

1851
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
Well, okay.

1852
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:01,000
I just think it was bad word choice all around.

1853
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
I started to give him the benefit of the doubt.

1854
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:07,000
I was like, is it maybe one of those things that's lost in translation or something?

1855
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:15,000
Anyhow, in this article that Tigerclaw linked us, let's see, who is this?

1856
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:24,000
David Ellis, Halo designer, said, eccentricity is a cute cover word for objectification and sexism.

1857
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:27,000
We got another call coming in, let's go to it.

1858
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, it's still connecting there.

1859
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1860
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:36,000
Boom, it's Jim Sally.

1861
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:37,000
Hey Jim Sally!

1862
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:38,000
Jim Sally, you're sideways.

1863
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:39,000
Yeah, you're sideways today.

1864
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:40,000
That's okay, we will turn our...

1865
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:41,000
Oh, there you go.

1866
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Now you're...

1867
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:43,000
He's in MTV camp.

1868
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
Jim Sally's tech support with a smile.

1869
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
You have very nice teeth, Jim Sally.

1870
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
I do, don't I? I brush every day, man.

1871
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:51,000
That's good, that's good.

1872
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:52,000
You should.

1873
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:53,000
You have that big gap right there, though.

1874
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
That's okay, Madonna gets away with it, so do you.

1875
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:58,000
I look, yeah, exactly. I look just as cute as she does, I think.

1876
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:01,000
We're gonna start calling you the material boy.

1877
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
Material boy, nice.

1878
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
So what's up, Jim Sally?

1879
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:09,000
Well, actually, a little sidetrack for the last caller.

1880
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
I've been to Providence town, man, many a time.

1881
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:12,000
Oh, really?

1882
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:16,000
My family, we're from Canada, but we vacationed in Cape Cod in this little town called Falmouth,

1883
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:19,000
and we used to always go to Providence town to...

1884
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:23,000
You know what, I'm gonna be honest with you, I had the cleanest beaches, nice places to walk.

1885
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:30,000
And it's definitely a different place when you go there compared to the rest of America.

1886
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Yeah.

1887
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
You wanna hear a funny story that happened to me when I went there?

1888
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Sure.

1889
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:35,000
You could tell me if you think this...

1890
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:39,000
Bobby doesn't think my stories are real, by the way, but this is real, Robert, I'm telling you.

1891
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:40,000
I believe you.

1892
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:47,000
I was about 12, 13, I was just starting to get into baseball, and I thought it was pretty cool,

1893
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
and I thought I was gonna be the best back catcher ever.

1894
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:55,000
So we went to Providence, and I was buying a lot of Red Sox gear and stuff there, right, because Boston's close by.

1895
02:27:55,000 --> 02:28:00,000
And I went to this one place that was selling T-shirts, and they had Boston Red Sox, there they go.

1896
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:06,000
And then they had novelty T-shirts, and there was one that I thought was back catching related, so I got it.

1897
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:10,000
My mom let me buy it, she's portraiting, she doesn't know any better, and the T-shirt said,

1898
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:13,000
You Pigeon, I'm Catching.

1899
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
Oh, no.

1900
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:19,000
I was like, wow. I looked good in it, though, right? Like, it was tight on my arms and stuff.

1901
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:22,000
Like, I had little 12-year-old pipes back then, too.

1902
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:27,000
So, yeah, I have a lot of pictures of me, like, 12 years old on that vacation wearing a T-shirt that says,

1903
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
You Pigeon, I'm Catching.

1904
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
Did you wear it to baseball practice when you got home?

1905
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Because I'm sure all the other kids just ate you alive.

1906
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Dude, yeah, that's where I found out about what that shirt really meant.

1907
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
Oh, my God.

1908
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:43,000
Can you believe that, man?

1909
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:48,000
But you just wanted to be a catcher in baseball. In baseball. Literally in baseball.

1910
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Yeah, otherwise, Jim Salley throws with his cannon.

1911
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:58,000
That means that you should vacation there, man. I'm gonna take my daughter there next year.

1912
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
I would love to visit there.

1913
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:04,000
I have seriously entertained the idea, and I don't know when I'm gonna have the time or the money to do this,

1914
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:10,000
but I've really entertained the idea of just going out to the East Coast and flying in there into a cheap airport

1915
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:14,000
and renting a car and just driving around the Northeast to all the places I wanted to go,

1916
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:19,000
because I want to see people in New York City, although the idea of driving in New York City terrifies me.

1917
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:23,000
I want to go to the Fun Spot Arcade that's out there. I'd love to go to P-Town.

1918
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:26,000
And there's just tons of stuff I'd love to do out there.

1919
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:32,000
Speaking of arcades, we had someone talking a while ago about wanting to start throwing an arcade.

1920
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:33,000
I believe it was in the email.

1921
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:34,000
It was in the email.

1922
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:39,000
When I was 17, I managed an arcade in Kitchener for about three months.

1923
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:43,000
A little word of advice from me to that guy.

1924
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:49,000
You can get a lot of stuff on consignment where the guys that own the machines, just put them in your store.

1925
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
You don't have to pay anything for them, but you have to give them a cut.

1926
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:52,000
You know what I'm saying?

1927
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
They get one quarter, you get another quarter, sort of a deal.

1928
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:59,000
You can build up a lot of inventory that way without having to shell out a lot of cash, right?

1929
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:04,000
Jim Salley, do you know who actually ran a very successful arcade on consignment like that?

1930
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:05,000
Disneyland.

1931
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:06,000
Disneyland.

1932
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:07,000
Really?

1933
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Yeah, when they had the Electronica event that was going on with Tron.

1934
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:14,000
A lot of those machines that were in there were from local owners.

1935
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:19,000
Yeah, it's a great way too, because those local owners don't have the facility to make any money.

1936
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:22,000
So for them, it's free money if you want to take the machine for a while.

1937
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
That's right, especially at Disneyland of all places.

1938
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
Hello, those machines got used heavily.

1939
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:29,000
And in fact, they finally did.

1940
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
It's like they read Disneyland fans' mind.

1941
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:36,000
They kind of did this mishmash of Flynn's Arcade and Wreck-It Ralph.

1942
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:40,000
And they put it in the arcade that's right next to the exit at Space Mountain.

1943
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:41,000
So it kind of lives on a little bit.

1944
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
There's a lot of cool stuff in there.

1945
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:44,000
That's cool.

1946
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:45,000
Yeah.

1947
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:46,000
I'm walking around the house.

1948
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:47,000
I'm looking for my dog.

1949
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:48,000
My dog ran outside.

1950
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:51,000
I know, I love that we're getting the tour of Jim Salley's house.

1951
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:54,000
So quickly, Jim Salley, what else on your mind tonight?

1952
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:58,000
I have a little delay in the podcast.

1953
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:01,000
I listened to my first one and it was a little too macho.

1954
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:02,000
I toned down the machoness.

1955
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:07,000
But I decided I'm going to start a new one called Jim Salley's Review Review.

1956
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
Jim Salley's Review Review.

1957
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:12,000
Jim Salley's Reviewing Your Review.

1958
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
Are you going to sing the theme song?

1959
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:17,000
Yeah, I review other people's reviews.

1960
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:18,000
That's pretty much how they do it.

1961
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
I'm going to review other people's reviews.

1962
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:24,000
Oh my God, I love it.

1963
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:25,000
Did you get that, Narsagra?

1964
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Jim Salley's Review Review.

1965
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:29,000
He's going to review other people's reviews.

1966
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:30,000
I love it.

1967
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
So it's sort of like a critique.

1968
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:33,000
Yes, in a way.

1969
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
It's a critique of other people's critiques.

1970
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Because some people's critiques need critiquing.

1971
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:38,000
You know what I'm saying?

1972
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:42,000
That's an amazing idea, Jim.

1973
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
I look forward to hearing the first episode.

1974
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:50,000
I'm so excited to hear that you are taking the podcasting idea to heart and really giving it a try.

1975
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:54,000
I'm sure Bobby would like a quick review of my review of Saints Row IV.

1976
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:57,000
He's probably recommending giving it a try.

1977
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
I'm going to give you a piece of advice.

1978
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
Stay away from the articles written on VoG.

1979
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:02,000
Don't review those.

1980
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:05,000
Oh, well there's reviews that come in Robert.

1981
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:08,000
Uh oh.

1982
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Alright, Jim Salley, before I let you go, any last thoughts?

1983
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:15,000
No, I just wanted to say hi to everybody today.

1984
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:16,000
I really missed you guys last week.

1985
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:17,000
You should have called me.

1986
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:18,000
I know.

1987
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:19,000
I'm sorry.

1988
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:20,000
I was having so much fun at Dragon Con.

1989
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
Jim Salley, I was so drunk.

1990
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:23,000
Dude.

1991
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:24,000
I was so drunk.

1992
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:25,000
Dude.

1993
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Brad from Pod Culture had me drink things I never thought I'd drink in my life.

1994
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:31,000
And it was marvelous.

1995
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:32,000
Ewww.

1996
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:33,000
Liquor?

1997
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:34,000
Oh my god.

1998
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Stop being ridiculous.

1999
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Did you take your man with you?

2000
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:40,000
I can't remember his name though.

2001
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:41,000
Alan?

2002
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Did you take Alan with you?

2003
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:45,000
No, Alan was not able to come because Alan, it's kind of expensive.

2004
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Alan hung out with me.

2005
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:47,000
He had to work.

2006
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:48,000
Yeah, Alan and Dark Sakura hung out.

2007
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:52,000
Alan hung out with me and he helped me with my Skyrim and my Dragon Age stuff.

2008
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
Oh yeah, that's two other games I did play.

2009
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:55,000
Skyrim and Dragon Age.

2010
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:56,000
Yeah, they had a girls' night.

2011
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:00,000
More like an after.

2012
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
And then I drank mimosas all night and played rock band.

2013
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:03,000
There you go.

2014
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:04,000
That's a party.

2015
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:09,000
Alright, Jim Salley, I'm going to let you go so we can try to fit in one more call,

2016
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:10,000
but thank you as always.

2017
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:11,000
You macho man.

2018
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:12,000
You catcher.

2019
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:13,000
I'm gonna love you.

2020
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:14,000
Alright, bye buddy.

2021
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:15,000
I love you Jamie, you're still my number one.

2022
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:16,000
You know you are.

2023
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:17,000
You know.

2024
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Touching you.

2025
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:19,000
I'm making hearts but you can't see it.

2026
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:20,000
Touching you.

2027
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:21,000
Ah, he's gonna poke me in the eye.

2028
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:22,000
Alright, bye Jim Salley, bye.

2029
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:23,000
Oh my god.

2030
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:24,000
I love it.

2031
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:25,000
Alright, 1877 Game O-L-R, our username on Skype.

2032
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:26,000
O-L-R.

2033
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:27,000
O-L-R.

2034
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:28,000
O-L-R.

2035
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:29,000
O-L-R.

2036
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:30,000
O-L-R.

2037
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:31,000

2041
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:35,000
O-L-R.

2042
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:39,000
Alright, 1877 Game O-L-R, our username on Skype.

2043
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:40,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

2044
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
I feel like he just poked me in the eye.

2045
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:43,000
I feel dirty.

2046
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:44,000
A little bit.

2047
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:45,000
A little bit.

2048
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:46,000
A little dirty.

2049
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:47,000
A little dirty.

2050
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:48,000
I kinda like it.

2051
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
Oh my.

2052
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Ah, going to Twitter.

2053
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:54,000
I'm trying to see if there's other stuff here on the Twitter.

2054
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
I do see a tweet from Bobby Blackwolf.

2055
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
I'm trying to see if it's a troll.

2056
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Oh no, it's not.

2057
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:01,000
This is legit.

2058
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:04,000
What he's sending us here from the website Road to VR.

2059
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:10,000
Oculus Rift support confirmed coming to Slender The Arrival, which is the sequel to Slenderman,

2060
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:16,000
the eight pages, which Shane got me to play that on Let's Play, and now Slender is spreading

2061
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
throughout the World of Warcraft community.

2062
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:21,000
Because Gemet and Syl started playing, it's like the new thing.

2063
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:25,000
You know how you watch a video or something like that on YouTube, and it could be just

2064
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:30,000
a random video of something, and they'll recommend other videos based on usually what you've

2065
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:31,000
watched.

2066
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:36,000
I had one that was a, it was a Slender game with Teletubbies in it.

2067
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
It was weird.

2068
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
I watched it though.

2069
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:43,000
SSJ100Matt, again, one more plug for the phones to see if we get any calls.

2070
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:47,000
1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2071
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:54,000
A tweet from SSJ100Matt tweeting us about that is apparently another arcade war documentary,

2072
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
a la King of Kong, on its way out.

2073
02:34:56,000 --> 02:35:01,000
It's called Man vs. Snake, and it's about the game Nibbler.

2074
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
What?

2075
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:08,000
And I'm kind of thinking to myself, I'm like, is that the game that's like Snake on the,

2076
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
you know, old school cellular phones?

2077
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
And I guess Nibbler was like that.

2078
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
I don't remember Nibbler in the arcades.

2079
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:17,000
I remember they had Nibbles, which was on Basic.

2080
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:22,000
It was the first game that had a high score table that could handle one billion plus points.

2081
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:26,000
That's just ridiculous.

2082
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
One billion?

2083
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
Yeah, a lot.

2084
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:34,000
So Man vs. Snake is running a Kickstarter campaign, which, you know, isn't that what they're all doing?

2085
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
To try and get funded.

2086
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
So it can be in a theater near you.

2087
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
There you go.

2088
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:44,000
Alright, one more call for calls, and then we'll end it if nobody else wants to call.

2089
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:48,000
1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2090
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:55,000
I should also pimp out my independent documentary about Whacking Days, also called Man vs. Snake.

2091
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
Where's the sad trombone, Rob?

2092
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
I'm not playing it after that. That was funny.

2093
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
I like that. Man vs. Snake.

2094
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
That should be the sequel.

2095
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
It's more co-op, though.

2096
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:16,000
That should be the sequel to, like, you know, Snakes on a Plane, you know, like Man vs. Snake.

2097
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
I got nothing.

2098
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
Alright, I guess nobody's calling in. How sad.

2099
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
And there's our dick joke of the night.

2100
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:29,000
That's alright, because my voice is starting to give out, so I think it's in all of our best interests that we wrap up the show.

2101
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:32,000
No, it wasn't a dick joke. You thought that was a dick joke?

2102
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:35,000
It's not a dick joke. It's a reference to The Simpsons.

2103
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:40,000
Whacking Days, it's a day where they go around with sticks and they beat up snakes.

2104
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:43,000
You dirty birdie. You dirty birdie.

2105
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:47,000
Confirmed dark soccer is the biggest perv on the show.

2106
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:51,000
That's not true, just because she may have missed that up.

2107
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:55,000
I do hold the title of biggest perv on the show.

2108
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
Alright, we won't challenge you for that.

2109
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:00,000
That's only because your wife isn't here, because then she would be the biggest perv on the show.

2110
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:06,000
Nellie is just the queen of the off-color remark.

2111
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:09,000
She's great, though. We gotta get her on the show sometime.

2112
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:12,000
Even though I know she hates the show, we gotta get her on it sometime.

2113
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:15,000
Alright, that does it for another episode of Orange On Radio.

2114
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:20,000
Thank you guys so much for joining us and inviting us into your life after our week off.

2115
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Hope we entertained you tonight. Sorry I was sick for most of it, but blame Dragon Con.

2116
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:28,000
We'll be back to do it all again next week.

2117
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:34,000
If you like what you heard, remember we don't ask for your money to do this show, so just help us spread the word.

2118
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
Tell a friend or two or five about the show.

2119
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:42,000
We really appreciate all the thumbs up on Stitcher, the five-star reviews on iTunes.

2120
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:47,000
We haven't got any in a long time, so if you haven't left us a five-star review on iTunes, we really appreciate it.

2121
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:51,000
And helping to spread the word. What more can we say? Thanks for the support.

2122
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:58,000
And it motivates us to get our family to grow and get more input and do more shows for you guys.

2123
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Before we say goodnight, we're gonna go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

2124
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:09,000
My final thought is Alan really needs to charge his Kindle, because this thing has been sitting on the dead battery screen for like two weeks.

2125
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:13,000
But I'm impressed at how long this thing can sit on a dead battery screen with no battery.

2126
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:16,000
Dark Soccer, your final thought?

2127
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:23,000
Um... meh. That's it.

2128
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
And Loki, last but not least, your final thought?

2129
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:30,000
Um... hopefully Grand Theft Auto this week.

2130
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:36,000
We'll see. Could we get an early review of Grand Theft Auto 5 next week? We will see.

2131
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:39,000
A+.

2132
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
It's not rigged at all.

2133
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:45,000
I know, Bobby's giving a C+. That's fine. No one's bitter, I guess.

2134
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Alright, tune in to find out. We'll be back in seven days to do it all again. Have a great week, everybody. Goodnight.

2135
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:21,000
The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.

2136
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
See you next week.

2137
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Thanks for watching!
