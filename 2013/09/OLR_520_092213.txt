Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, Mighty No.
9 surpasses its stretch goals and will try heading to consoles.
Diablo 3 will lose its auction house next year, more of Imani heads to iOS, and the tributes and memorials to Hiroshi Yamauchi begin.
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this September the 22nd of 2013 with the 520th episode of our show.
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here to talk about video games with you guys out there in internet land and my co-hosts here in studio.
Say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
Work.
Work.
Work.
Work.
Tonight's presentation of OLR will be presented in the language of Chocobo.
That was the sound of like 500 people unsubscribing from the show all at once.
You mean we have that many?
The facts are completely made up on tonight's OLR as well.
How you doing, DarkSakura?
Seriously.
Caffeinated, thank you.
No, seriously.
How are you?
It's a bummer it's a radio show because if y'all could see the look she was giving me right now.
I think I was giving him the girl face.
Or how dare you cut me off.
But you're caffeinated.
Do you have your coffee?
I'm caffeinated.
I have had healthy food today.
And I still have chocolate-covered mints for later.
Ooh, yummy.
And I've brought delicious snacks.
Which I keep eating.
In the form of my special trail mix made of raw almonds and raw cashews and roasted coconut.
But the coconut's the best part.
It totally is.
All right.
Say hello to our coconut here on the show, or just nut.
Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
Hi.
How are you, Loki?
I'm fine.
Yeah?
Well, throat's a little sore, but I'm fine.
Oh, sorry to hear it.
I caught it from my son, so... Don't get me sick.
Yeah, don't get us sick.
I'm being rude.
Don't get me sick.
It's just...
It's just the throat thing.
It could very well be also allergies because I always get like scratchy throat whenever the weather goes wet and then dry again.
Well, the seasons changed yesterday.
I don't know if you noticed, but it rained.
Yeah.
So that means summer's over and here's winter because we don't have a fall here.
There's no transition.
It's just like boom, done.
That's right.
Boom goes the dynamite.
That's it.
So yeah, it rained here yesterday.
So thank...
Thank gosh it rained yesterday and not two days ago because I went to an outdoor concert two days ago and that would have been really terrible if it was raining.
So, yeah.
Anyway, you guys are there in our chat room.
We always like to say hello to the fourth guest on the show, our chatters.
Live.vognetwork.com is the place to be because we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at VOG Network.
Except in October where we record dead.
Yeah.
The Voice of Geeks Network, VOG Network dot com.
And again, that's Sunday nights, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
And those of you that were listening live, I'm sure we're aware of this.
But if you're listening on the podcast, you may not be aware.
Our pal Bobby hit 400 episodes tonight.
So claps and congratulations for Bobby.
That's a great milestone.
and in true Bobby form, he had walked through the door 20 minutes before to set up in a frenzy because he was working on something else for the show.
Because he was 15 minutes late with Starbucks.
No, that's our excuse, DarkSakura.
Bobby's always hard at work.
So, all right.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Hiroshi Yamauchi died this week at age 85.
If you don't know that name, he was basically the head of Nintendo, the Nintendo president for many years.
That's the position that Satoru Iwata holds now, and many of you know him for sure.
But Yamauchi ran Nintendo for 53 years.
So the NES, the Super NES, all the stuff that led into NES, because they didn't start with that.
They were doing the watch games, and even before that it was cards and the more mechanical stuff.
That's how he met Gunpei Yokoi, if I'm not mistaken.
It wasn't about games at all.
I think you have a mechanical...
But Hiroshi Yamauchi, he was a very interesting guy because he was a businessman in every sense of the word.
The man hardly played video games at all.
In fact, I believe rumor has it the first video game he ever played was when Tetris went to the Game Boy, which, to be fair, was a lot of people's interest.
I was about to say.
Yeah.
But yeah, he just knew how to make business decisions.
And a lot of people, of course, also know him because he owned the Seattle Mariners for quite some time.
And it was very controversial at the time because he was in Japan, the team was here, he didn't really have plans to come see the team.
He never came to see a game.
Now, he watched them on TV and things like that, but he never came over to actually see a game.
So it was kind of controversial in that sense.
But again, businessman.
DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Yes So just kind of funny how that all kind of goes together Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com Some kind words and some reminiscing about Hiroshi Yamauchi in chat Dungeon Buster says he was an uncanny judge of character and trends WhatUpG says hiring Miyamoto, one of his best moves ever True says TMZ even showed a bit of love to Hiroshi Yamauchi, lol
Yeah, you know, the news even kind of, you know, cut through to the mainstream because, you know, not only was he the Nintendo guy, which, you know, obviously he made a boatload of money from his share of Nintendo stock when it surged thanks to the Wii and all that.
I mean, the man had a boatload of money.
Many people knew that he did not accept his pension when he retired from Nintendo.
He said, no, Nintendo needs the money.
And so I believe he donated a huge amount to cancer charities as well.
So the man did a lot of good, which should be recognized.
And he also, you think he probably had well enough in savings to live off of.
I wish that CEOs over here would do that.
Yeah, it was a very humble sort of thing to do.
And it made a lot of mainstream coverage.
I heard not all of it was necessarily tasteful.
I want to say I heard that Arsenio Hall...
Who I didn't even realize was back on TV with a late night show I was like, how 1992 is that?
But he's back on TV with a late night show And there was some type of joke in the monologue or something Where, you know, Hiroshi Yamauchi died today And it sounded something like this And they played the Pac-Man
Really?
I don't know.
I'm paraphrasing the joke.
I don't remember the exact words, but I know it was the Pac-Man noise because it made me think, well, if you want to get technical, sir, even though your joke is in incredibly poor taste, Pac-Man was a Namco character, and I think a lot of people would recognize the Mario death noise, so if you had to go there, but you know what?
Then I'm writing people's disgusting jokes for them, so whatever.
You know how I found out about it, actually?
Mm-hmm.
Oddly enough, I saw his picture on the Nikkei site.
And then later on I saw someone had translated from the business news that he died.
And that's how I found out.
So obviously a lot of gaming in general...
is to thank to this this man and his guidance even if he wasn't necessarily a gamer himself his business guidance led Nintendo to greatness um I thought maybe we could just take a minute I mean obviously I think it goes without saying we want to you know kind of dedicate our show tonight to his memory and everything he's done for us but I thought it might be a good time to kind of just share some Nintendo memories and maybe some early Nintendo memories so I want to go around the room here
I'm not playing my 3DS right now, am I?
Not current Nintendo memories because your 3DS is so close to the mic they can actually hear your Animal Crossing going.
Hey, that's actually good background music to have the island music.
I suppose it is somewhat appropriate.
But in all seriousness, DarkSakura, what's your first memory of the Nintendo Entertainment System?
When did you become an NES fangirl?
Now, I know you were Sega.
No, I wasn't.
Dan was Sega.
I was pretty damn loyal to Nintendo when I was a kid.
I went over to my friend's house and played Metroid.
I would go hang out over at my friend's house and she had Super Mario Bros.
and Metroid and...
Legend of Zelda and for that god-awful game Clue Clue fucking Land.
Oh my god.
I kind of like that game.
I kind of too but I hate it too.
It's one of those like it's so niche and it's so stupid like it's kind of cool like if you if you know how to play Clue Clue Land that kind of makes you a gaming hipster.
Yeah well I would also go over to now at the time and I have to give a little background my friend Catherine.
Who would just go by Catherine?
Her mother was a Cathy.
My mother was a Cathy.
They were both Cathleens.
And I have an Aunt Cathy and a bunch of people.
So we would always joke, which Cathy am I hanging with?
But anyway, her brother was like super into Metroid.
So we would, you know, Metroid and Metal Gear.
So it was a lot of playing that around over at her house.
And then my dad finally got me mine and he got me his favorite game, which was Sky Shark.
I was playing shooting games in 1941 and 1942.
My papa, when he was alive, my dad's dad, we would play Jackal on his big screen TV where you could see every damn pixel.
And he'd say, now Maury, because he called me Maury.
My middle name is Maury.
He didn't like my first name for some reason.
I'd say Maury.
Maury.
I want you to throw that grenade over the wall, and then I'm going to come around and shoot him.
I'd be like, okay, Papa, and then playing Abadox.
Because for some reason, he liked Abadox.
Your Papa likes some really strange NES games.
I know!
That's cool, though.
But he was totally into the war games and Tecmo Bowl.
And my little sister, for some reason, liked that stupid game MagMax.
I beat the shit out of that game I couldn't do it now but I was pretty good at it then so yeah
I can't really pin it on one thing it's just lots of good things and that and having a friend set his on fire I don't know if you thought I was joking about it before but I really was serious he threw it down a flight of stairs and set it on fire and it still worked
That's back when they built consoles.
They were built tough.
That's right.
There was none of this red ring or yellow light shit.
Yeah.
You'd throw them down a flight of stairs and set them on fire and they still worked.
It still worked.
Although I don't think it would have worked had he flushed it down the toilet like he wanted to.
That disgusting brown color that most Super Nintendos are these days is a badge of honor.
And that meant your mom was a chain smoker.
That's what it meant in my house.
Loki, what were some early NES memories for you?
Well, I got my first NES.
My parents surprised me with Breakthrough, Zelda, and Bubble Bobble.
So I played the crap out of that.
That and my friend's house.
Because everyone had an NES, so we played different games.
That's about it.
What was it about the NES that made you love it so much?
I don't know, I just like video games anyways.
I had a ColecoVision before that, so... I did too!
So it was just slightly better, you know?
Better graphics?
Yeah, better graphics, better controller, because, you know, the ColecoVision is like a numpad with a little joystick on top.
At least it wasn't as bad as the Atari 5200 controller, though.
That was pretty bad.
What would you say is your favorite NES game ever?
probably like let's see Legend of Zelda or Blaster Master Metroid's good too it's one of my favorites too I don't know I mean there was I know there was some NES games I had that I played the crap out of but I can't really remember which ones they were Mega Man 2 maybe yeah
um my earliest NES memory was that um I I wanted a Nintendo real bad for kind of the same reason Loki did is that I liked video games anyway we had an Atari 2600 so of course when I saw that there was a Nintendo out there and I got to play it at the store I really wanted them
I think I played it at a friend's house too.
And I finally was rewarded with one for getting straight A's in the fourth grade.
I got my Nintendo Entertainment System.
We went to Sears and bought the NES that came with Super Mario Brothers and Duck Hunt.
And I just played the crap out of that.
I played so much Mario Brothers.
It was insane.
GreyGunEra
I want to play Legend of Zelda.
I want a Nintendo.
Thanks for watching!
My favorite NES game, see, I would have to kind of jack some of the early answers, and I would say probably The Guardian Legend is honestly my favorite NES game of all time as well, just because of the hybrid of it.
Outside of that, honestly, I know it's really cliche, but I kind of think Super Mario Bros. 2...
is one of my favorite NES games just because I just have so many memories with that.
I remember renting that game on New Year's Eve or something, and I played the crap out of that game one New Year's and played it from start to finish.
And God, I love that game so much.
It was...
Magic of Scheherazade
I did.
Yes.
Not very much of it.
I rented it, but it was like during exams or something.
It was like a hybrid of Zelda and Final Fantasy, and it was kind of rad.
Now, because it kind of tried to do too much, it kind of had some flaws.
But when you're like 10 years old, you overlook those flaws and you're like, this game's awesome.
It has everything.
So there you go.
some folks in chat GameGuru in chat says as for favorites Super Mario Brothers 3 bar none that was one of my all-time favorites too and I think for a lot of us I remember going to one of my best friends back in the day his name was Devin I went to his house and we played we stayed up until like 4 in the morning playing Super Mario Brothers 3 and we were doing the whole like two player like who doesn't remember playing that with another person and you would always fight the other person oh my sister and I were just complete bitches to each other over that game mm-hmm
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
I have to freaking replant one of my stupid perfect pears.
Because the fucking trees die.
You've got real problems, young lady.
I do have real problems.
I have mental problems.
Like Reginald in Nedroid, which is still my favorite webcomic.
Anyway.
I've been playing Animal Crossing.
I might open my village during the show.
I'm still thinking about it.
If enough people show interest, I will open my village.
Damn, I got bit by a mosquito.
Um...
So, I've also been playing Final Fantasy XIV, and I have finally joined the Twin Adders.
Because, first of all, the flaming people suck.
I hate their stupid, privileged 1% country.
And I refuse to be a part of their whole...
In the beta, I was with that nation, but I changed it when the full game came out.
Screw the Sultana, okay?
That little bitch does not get any of my money.
I'm gonna give it to the hippies because Occupy just so people just so people kind of understand for Final Fantasy 14 you know a lot of MMOs historically have had factions and you know a lot of people break it down to good and evil but it's not always that way for instance World of Warcraft has the Alliance and the Horde although the Horde is not necessarily evil or whatever it's just you know those are the two factions they're just assholes
Final Fantasy XIV is a faction-free game.
Everybody can talk to each other.
Because usually in WoW, if you play Horde but your friend plays Alliance, you can't talk to each other.
Unless you're through a real idea or whatever.
But in Final Fantasy, that doesn't stop you.
But you will join one of three nations throughout the story.
And you don't even have to.
Yeah, technically you don't have to.
And you can switch whenever you want.
I think those allegiances will come into PvP later on, but for right now it only has minor impacts on the story.
But I hate PvP, so that will never happen.
Right.
Well, there's not even PvP in the game yet.
Well, I still hate it.
So, I...
I've been playing that, I've been playing Warfractal, and I have actually picked up an older game on my phone, and I've been playing it stupidly obsessively for some stupid reason, because you know me and puzzle games.
I've been playing Bejeweled.
Like, not even Bejeweled Blitz, I haven't played that yet.
I am playing old school Bejeweled.
I've been in Diamond Mine mode for like... It helps me get sleepy at night, as I have a lot of trouble sleeping, so I play Bejeweled at night.
And, um...
Yeah, I know I played something else, but for the life of me, I can't remember
You'll think of it later and then shout it out randomly in the middle of a sentence.
Yes, I will.
All right.
Loki, do I even have to ask how many hours you sunk into Grand Theft Auto V this week?
I don't remember how many hours I sunk in, but I think it's at least 16, at least.
I don't know.
I'm almost at the end of the campaign, and it's great.
I love every second of it.
So I even got my son to play a little bit of it.
He's been driving.
Wait!
Wait a minute!
What?
Wait a minute!
He likes driving the car.
But you're letting your three-year-old son play Grand Theft Auto V?
He's not killing people.
He's driving back and forth on a beach.
Three-year-olds have no moral compass.
It does not matter.
No, I just... Loki can do what he wants, and I know he's not showing the bad parts of the game.
He's just driving a car.
You have to admit, the initial sentence of you saying, yeah, I'm letting my son play Grand Theft Auto V is kind of funny.
Well, he doesn't really know how to play.
All he can really do is just press the gas.
So I have to kind of steer for him, and he just presses the gas and laughs when he hits stuff.
Like people.
No, like fences, not people.
And the people are all fine.
They just go to the hospital, and they come out just fine.
It's like when he asks, he's all... And he even asks, he's all, stop hitting that man.
Why did we take that guy's car?
Yeah.
So someday, Loki, when your son gets busted for street racing all Fast and Furious style in daddy's car, I'm gonna say, do you know why this happened?
Well, so I drove my uncle's Trans Am when I was six.
I do have a video.
Do I street race?
I have lots of video, actually.
My brother tried to make me drive his car when I was like 10 and I cried.
When I was six, no, he had a Thunderbird.
It was great, though.
Okay, so I was trying to get some video of him yesterday because he did it yesterday, too.
He was driving over these hills in the middle of the desert and was like, I'm going camping.
Or we're going to Trader Joe's.
Or I'm driving to Safeway.
Why does the middle of the desert make your son think about Trader Joe's?
No, that was camping.
Outro Music
or Bus.
He thinks it's funny when you can push the Y button to get the guy in and out of the car.
He thought that was hilarious.
And then he's like, look, it's turning the wheels.
WhatUpG in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com asks, Has Loki let him fly a plane yet?
Oh, God, no.
Because the reason why is he doesn't know how to even drive the car.
So flying a plane, it would just be over really fast.
And he gets frustrated.
If he hits the wall and he can't figure out how to get around it, he just gets frustrated almost immediately.
He has no patience.
So, yeah, a plane just...
I thought that'd be fun.
I wanted to give him a boat because, you know, it's the ocean.
He's not going to run into anything out there.
But he just wanted to drive a car, so let him drive a car.
Well, away from the stories about your son playing the game for a minute and back to you playing the game, what is it about the game that makes it so great that you come through the door of the OLR studios and go, Rob, when are you getting Grand Theft Auto V?
Well, first off, you like the sandbox games where you can pretty much do whatever you want, and that's this game.
And there's a lot of realism to it, or I should say immersion to it.
Like, for example, if I run over some dude or something in the mountains, like some hiker, if I just plow over my car.
Later on, I may be driving, and I'll hear a news report on the radio saying that a hiker has gone missing.
And then they try to get you back because they know what you did that summer.
and and there's all sorts of crazy stuff there is a whole thing that has to do with like some hidden letters that you have to collect and there's actually a ghost up in the mountains and stuff and you know there's you know all sorts of crazy acid trips that these guys can go on and is it really funny though because I will say I do like sandbox games but part of the reason why I love Saints Row is that it's so over the top like I don't think I've laughed harder at a video game than I did the opening to Saints Row 3
Saints Row is just kind of like, and even playing both, I think the best analogy I've seen was someone said Grand Theft Auto is a parody of reality and Saints Row is a parody of Grand Theft Auto.
You can tell that they went into incredible detail with every single thing in this game as far as the immersion with the
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I don't know.
I just like all the detail in the game and the writing is really good.
The story is really interesting.
The characters are very interesting.
Especially Trevor is just nuts.
And just seeing all the things that go kind of awkward and stuff in the game and all the different conflicts that are there.
It's a really interesting storyline.
So that's kind of what the draw is, I think.
What's next for Grand Theft Auto with the online component?
We were talking a little bit about this on Bobby's show, but just to kind of retouch on it a little bit, what do people have to look forward to in a couple weeks when the online part opens up?
Well, first off, they said I think there's supposed to be about 700 missions in the game, so you're going to be able to pull heists and do, you know, robberies and all sorts of stuff on top of normal deathmatches and races and that kind of thing.
Plus, there's going to be editors in the game to make your own custom content, so you can make custom deathmatch maps, you can make custom races...
and that's just the beginning they're eventually going to get it to where you can do custom missions and all other game types and then on top of that they've built the game in a way that it's just going to keep expanding beyond Grand Theft Auto 5 you're not just going to be stuck in San Andreas they're going to have it where you can they can basically increase the size of the map and add new cities and areas as time goes on so it's just going to keep building from there and it sounds exciting
Plus getting to play with people again.
It's hard to find people for Grand Theft Auto 4 nowadays.
And you're on both 360 and PlayStation 3.
Yeah, and I'm kind of hoping that they both tie together.
Do you have one of those little squads?
I see people advertising on Twitter.
I do have a crew available.
I will link it in the chat room.
It's the VOG Network crew.
The first thing you probably want to do is get a membership, if you don't have it already, to the Rockstar Social Club.
and so on.
Awesome.
Yeah, so I'm actually trying to see real quick here.
I can probably link it.
I'll link it on... I had it linked on Twitter at one time, but I'll link it again so we can add everybody before it launches.
and I'm sure if it's anything like it has been with the social club stuff so far it may be a little downsy by the time it launches because they've been having little server issues as with anything Any other games besides Grand Theft Auto you want to talk about?
Nope
Alright, the My Gaming Week.
Pretty similar to Loki, I've been focused on mainly one game, and that game is Final Fantasy XIV, which I've talked about ad nauseum in previous weeks, so I won't really get into too much detail.
I will just say I'm a level 45 white mage, so I'm getting a little closer to endgame and all the AK runs and Ifrit hard mode and all that.
I do love how they wound the story into this game, though.
I will say that much.
The story really kind of keeps you going, and it's
Final Fantasy Cutscenes
Fenerus' voice coming out of the Eleven guy.
I haven't heard a lot of the voice acting because I'm on Skype a lot when I play the game with friends.
So we're just chatting through it.
I'll have to do some more live stream of it later.
It's just my frame rate really suffers unless I can get on the PlayStation 3 and get one of those boxes that streams or something.
Anyhow, I will say outside of Final Fantasy XIV, I sort of discovered a renaissance this week for pinball games.
And I think a lot of that is because PlayStation Plus right now is giving away Star Wars pinball with the Plus.
So I downloaded that and I was checking out those tables.
And I really like the Episode 5 table in particular.
Thank you for watching!
All of it did because, you know, they had that whole cross thing.
So I actually had a reason to play my Vita and I was playing Zen Pinball on the Vita.
And I got to say, love, love, love that you can rotate the Vita so that it's a vertical screen.
And so you have the vertical play field like you expect a pinball game to be, right?
That's nothing new.
And you use the touch screen.
I know it's not new.
The WonderSwan did that.
I know it's not new, but okay, how long ago was the WonderSwan and do we ever have it in America?
You know I'm giving you crap.
I know they did, but the PSP wasn't giving me these games free either.
But, well, and...
Thanks for watching!
And I did find the link for the crew thing.
It is just VOG Network.
So socialclub.rockstargames.com slash crew slash VOG Network.
And that's how you get to it.
We already have nine people.
And once we get more people, I'll start divvying up where people are because you can actually have a hierarchy of players and stuff.
Well, I will briefly mention where a lot of the VOG people are playing Final Fantasy XIV, since I know you've got your game and I've got mine.
We are on the Midgarcimer server, and our free company is called End of Line.
We have 45 characters in our thing right now.
To be fair, a lot of it is like friends of friends.
It's not just exclusively people that listen to VOG stuff, but it's a good group of people.
And yeah, you can check that out.
All the information is at vognetwork.com in the
Horde House forums because technically Horde House is my show about online games so everything you need to know is in the Horde House forums at vognetwork.com and you should probably post the Grand Theft Auto stuff to the OLR forum that would be great yeah I was going to at some point I need to create a logo so you know okay once I do that well you know you have a graphic designer right here well no they have a little like app thing so I have to create a logo you have to use their stuff like I just have haven't done it yet fair enough fair enough
Alright, well I think that's enough of our gaming week.
Housekeeping, I'll just quickly say, don't forget we're on Twitter, twitter.com.com.com and we are on Facebook, facebook.com.com.com Alright, enough talk.
We've done a lot of reminiscing about old gaming and new gaming.
Let's get into gaming news and what is going on in the industry this week.
Loki.
Val's going to announce something tomorrow.
It's probably going to have something to do with the Steam Box.
Gabe was teasing something about a Linux Steam Box last week.
I think that's what it is.
And it's going to be announced 10 a.m.
Pacific time tomorrow.
Which is sad because by the time most people hear this, because obviously we have our live audience, but the podcast people will already know what this news is.
At least the first of the three announcements.
Yes, there's three announcements.
There's Circle, Circle in brackets, and Circle plus Circle.
So...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I never really thought of that.
It's kind of funny.
It actually does look like a stick figure holding up a crowbar.
So speculation, just rampant wank speculation on what these announcements could be.
I think more information on the Steam box is a given.
And I'm going to repeat some of the things I said on the Call on Bobby show because it's my guess and that hasn't changed in 15 minutes or however long it's been.
I think Half-Life 3 is not the announcement.
I think Left 4 Dead 3 is going to be the announcement.
I think that's, you know, they will be hyping up towards a third game in a series, but it's going to be Left 4 Dead 3, which is not bad news.
You know, it's been a few years since Left 4 Dead 2.
I can see them doing, you know, Steam Box, Left 4 Dead 3 troll announcement, and then, you know, hey, Half-Life 3.
No, I kind of think the other announcement, you know, Dota 2 is so huge for Valve right now, especially internationally.
I kind of think one of the big three announcements has to be about Dota.
And I would think maybe if they announce the Steam Box, maybe there's some way that Dota interface, like, I think they're going to try to get Dota 2 in your living room.
So maybe like controller support for Dota or something along those lines?
That's cool, but at the same time, the announcement of Half-Life 3 could really throw a monkey wrench into next-gen consoles and stuff like that, and the people's needs for that stuff.
I'm interested in a Steam box, depending on what the specs are and what it's able to run, because I do have my laptop, so...
I don't necessarily need another gaming PC although my first gaming PC has kind of fallen apart so maybe I do need a new gaming PC.
TigerClaw in our chatroom says, Rob Roberts, what if Portal 3 is the announcement?
You know, I just... Because Valve is so allergic to the number 3, I don't want to say I'd be disappointed if Portal 3 is the announcement.
Quite no, but I would be kind of surprised that that's the game they're so quick to go back and visit again.
I just would be a little bit surprised.
What if it's Left 4 Dead 3, Portal 3, and Half-Life 3?
I think a lot of the internet would probably poop their pants.
and rightfully so I think that would be a lot of great news three things about three you know there's also the possibility though that Valve is doing something we haven't heard of yet a completely new IP and I think that would be okay too so yes circle or bracket circle and bracket circle and bracket plus bracket circle plus circle
Well, Circle plus Circle.
That sounds like Portal to me.
Gosh, you're talking about Hollywood squares all of a sudden.
Circle gets the square.
All right.
Portal 3, it would have to be a different test subject.
See, now my brain is thinking around all of that.
Well, you know, I will say this.
Speaking of Dota, which I brought up a minute ago, there's a video circulating where they're going to have a, or it might be out now, the GLaDOS announcer pack for Dota 2.
And it's hilarious.
I know I linked it on my Twitter earlier this week.
It's Oda, the DS silent.
They had some hilarious... Oh, God, what was one of the lines?
I should try to find it on my Twitter real quick because one of the whole, like, welcome to Dota things was so funny.
Oh, gosh, I'm going to try and find this real quick.
Anything else you want to say about Portal 3, DarkSakura, while I try to dig this up?
No, other than it was pretty cool hearing her in Pacific Rim.
Welcome to Dota.
Don't forget your little plastic sword and all your chins.
A little bit of shade from GLaDOS there.
I love that.
Play it again.
Play it again?
Yeah, play it again.
I love her.
She's such a sassy bitch.
Don't forget your plastic sword and all your chins.
Hold on.
Here we go.
One more time.
Welcome to Dota.
Don't forget your little plastic sword and all your chins.
This video is like 21 minutes of GLaDOS.
There's more.
And your giant flagon of gravy.
Welcome to Medieval Times.
How many in your party tonight?
I love it.
That would make me play the game.
Doesn't that make you want to play Dota 2?
Yes, just for that sassy bitch.
By the way, I have to sort of derail a little bit.
Did you see the person cosplaying GLaDOS?
There was video and pictures up of this girl.
A lot of people cosplay GLaDOS, but yes.
No, no, not doing the whole anthropomorphic version.
Hanging from a harness.
With the mask and everything.
And moving around and everything and doing the voice and all that.
That was cool.
Some folks in chat are, as far as the threes go, I see GameGuru says Team Fortress 3 could be a possibility.
But Actdeft follows that up saying, Guru, I don't see Valve making a Team Fortress 3 anytime soon.
It does seem like they are still adding every day to Team Fortress 2.
It would seem a little soon for a three.
More hats, more tie-ins to other products, more like.
All right, well, moving on to another company, I want to talk a little bit about what Microsoft talked about this week.
They were at Tokyo Game Show, believe it or not, showing off some things going on there.
One of the things that was talked about, though, that unfortunately yet another perceived negative for Microsoft's system was in a quote from Albert Piniello, who's the Senior Director of Product Management.
Quote,
We don't support vertical orientation.
Do it at your own risk.
It wouldn't be a cooling problem.
We just didn't design the drive for vertical.
Because it's a slot loading drive, we just didn't design it for both.
I don't think this is a big deal whatsoever.
I only bring it up because I saw it all over Twitter and Facebook.
So people are talking about this, but I'm going to be honest.
I kind of think if you're out there going oh my god Microsoft fucks up again you can't have your thing vertical kind of think you're looking for a reason to dump on Microsoft at this point I don't think it's that big a deal it's not going to throw off the feng shui of your living room cabinet or something
Well, it's the size of a cable box anyways.
I mean, you'll stack your cable box.
But I'm just saying, you know, and who cares?
So it doesn't stand up or whatever.
The whole thing is because idiots before kept knocking it over and they had a whole issue with that.
Blaming it on the slot-loading disk drive is kind of dumb.
I would just say it's because you guys are fucking idiots and you keep knocking that shit over.
I mean, look at the 360.
You guys...
Doesn't the Wii have a slot drive and most people put that vertically?
The Wii has a slot drive, the PlayStation 4 has a slot drive.
But the Wii also has that little cradle so it's a little harder to knock it over.
Yeah, but you know, plastic's expensive.
I know.
And I think that thing probably weighs a metric ton, so you know.
But I just, I don't, I don't know.
I mean, there are some people that are legitimately like, I like to have my consoles vertical, blah, blah, blah.
The Xbox One is about the size of an original Xbox Duke controller, so it's...
I can see why.
But yeah, come on.
It looks like it'd be very unstable standing up sideways.
If you want to stand it up sideways, assuming that it still would work that way, I'm sure that there would be a third-party solution to brace that thing up so that it doesn't fall over.
They just don't want you to knock it off your shelf.
Remember, cats are evil.
They will knock that shit over.
No, they'll throw up on your rug.
Well, both.
They will do both.
They will knock it over, then they'll throw up on it and on your rug.
Well, another interesting quote from Mr. Piniello.
Quote, we found, interestingly enough, that 80% of people, believe it or not,
have their Xbox 360 horizontally.
I will have you know that I'm not part of the 80%.
I have vertical all the way, unless it's near my cat, in which case it's horizontal.
I have my 360 horizontal.
Most of my consoles go horizontal.
The only one that didn't was the Wii, and that's because I sort of got the perception that that was designed to go vertical.
But Wii U doesn't go vertical, if I remember right, right?
It's like rounded on the edges.
You can't stand that thing.
That sounds like a challenge.
Yes, you can.
Well, okay.
With putty.
You really shouldn't stand it up.
You can make a stand.
Alright, now you're making it a challenge.
Well, I'm sure it's like they're saying here about the Xbox One.
Do it at your own risk.
Throw your Wii U down a flight of stairs and set it on fire for all we care.
You know what?
Mine's actually horizontal.
Just because of how... You've seen the shelves in my house.
That's how they... And then the cat sits on it.
All right.
Ziba in chat says, mine is vertical too.
So let's see.
Tiger Claw says, I remember when the PlayStation 1 had trouble reading discs and the only fix, putting it upside down.
That's right.
I remember that too.
Oh, yes.
And then, no, no, no, no.
There was the other fix.
Sideways.
When you did have to hold that thing vertically.
I remember people would use paper clips or something to hold the door open, basically.
That was for the swap trick.
Oh, my bad.
Yeah.
Back in the day.
Oh, boy.
Spring.
Oh, no, no.
We did it old school.
We had the paperclip.
We figured out the right way to bend the paperclip so that we could just go thump.
I remember when you got me that little cartridge that plugged into the back of the PlayStation 1.
Yes, we ordered like, what, 50 of them?
Not 50, but we ordered a bunch of them.
Those things were awesome, and I never had a problem playing import games after that.
Yeah, those things were awesome.
Anyhow, moving on.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But Blizzard is going to be closing down Diablo 3's auction house and that's going to happen on March 18th next year.
Their actual statement saying that, and I'm quoting, it became increasingly clear that despite the benefits of the auction house system and the fact that many players around the world use it, it ultimately undermines Diablo's core gameplay, kill monsters and get cool loot.
With that in mind, we want to let everyone know that we've decided to remove the gold and real money auction house system from Diablo 3.
So that means it's... Does that still need to be connected online?
Because, you know... People are jumping to that conclusion that that will be the next thing that happens, but we don't know for sure.
But that was the crutch that they were... That was why it had to be online, was to preserve the integrity of the auction house.
So now we just don't know.
But it would be logical that in a later patch, they're going to say, you know, we're going to patch out the Always Online requirement.
That would be great.
Then I'd play it again.
I wonder if that wouldn't be a quiet thing.
Or maybe they'll do it under LAN play.
I think that would be huge if they were to do a patch that not only removes the auction house, but then does LAN play without Battle.net.
I mean, that would be huge.
But I don't know.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
They're also saying something else, too.
I'm going to read this quote.
We feel that this move, along with the Loot 2.0 system being developed concurrently with Reaper of Souls, will result in much more rewarding game experience for our players.
So I think that they're looking to change quite a few things about the way it plays.
There's definitely kind of a soft reboot of the game happening here.
It might be enough to make me play it again.
Diablo 3, Diablo 3, Diablo 3
It's weird for me because I did play Diablo 3 like the whole way through.
I beat it.
I played enough of it.
It's really weird to go from clicky fest to like aiming because like you don't have a mouse.
So you aim.
and it locks on to monsters.
It's just a different way of playing the same game.
It's really weird.
But I liked it.
But it is just really different.
And the inventory system is completely different too.
I mean, they really had to change everything to support the controller.
Now, what if they had a controller version for the PC?
Like, would you still keep playing on PC if you could do it with a controller?
Um, no, at this point I prefer the mouse because that's just the way I played the game and I think it is a different balance between controller and mouse.
I don't see them mixing those.
I don't think they're going to mix the console version with the PC version, but, um,
I am interested enough in the console version.
My problem is that $60 price tag when I already have the game on PC, no matter if I got it for free or what have you.
You're not quite the target audience since you already own the PC version.
You're right.
I'm not the target audience.
But I will say this.
I'm very interested in PlayStation 4 version.
and hopefully the inevitable price cut three months after it's out version.
How does it look visually compared to the PC version considering that they're going to have a PlayStation 4 version?
I can't imagine that you'd be able to improve.
The resolution's not quite as crisp to me as it is on PC.
I even see that in Final Fantasy XIV a little bit and I think a lot of that just depends on what video card you're packing.
I saw it a lot in Final Fantasy XIV looking at the videos.
Because I found some high-res playthrough videos from the PS3.
But I have my maxed all the way.
And it looks amazing.
It doesn't look bad by any means.
You have to get really nitpicky, but I would see where they could probably make some graphical improvements on PlayStation 4.
I'll be checking that out later, but I'm happy to hear about the removal of the Auction House.
I don't think that many people were using it, to be honest.
No, I'm totally with that.
All right, let's move on.
Loki.
All right.
So let's talk a little bit about Blizzard again.
And this kind of ties in with, I think we were talking about it a few weeks ago, where they were, Vividi was trying to kind of separate themselves from Activision Blizzard and kind of drum up some money, I guess, by selling their shares and that kind of stuff.
Um, however, that's been kind of halted because there's a lawsuit taking place in Delaware.
Apparently, I guess one of the, some of the shareholders didn't like the idea.
I think they said basically the shareholder has sued the company to prevent this from happening, claiming that it's a huge waste and
and meant to cover a power grab and so because of that the court actually halted it right now and basically in order for it to continue they have to appeal and get a majority vote from the non-Vivendi stockholders so interesting that that kind of happened now I'm not really sure what as far as like a power like power grab thing supposed to be I don't understand their angle there with that
I'm not sure I see it either, and I kind of don't think this is going to go much of anywhere.
It is interesting to bring this up immediately after that previous story, because some are speculating, tinfoil hat, that the removal of the Diablo 3 auction house is directly tied to the fact they're not with Vivendi anymore.
Now that they're a little more independent, per se, that they dropped it, even though they are still part of Activision, but maybe Vivendi was the real problem.
Yeah, see, that's what I thought with, like, you know, the kind of go completely different game, different company, with Deep Silver, or I should say THQ and Saints Row.
That's what I thought with all the DLC whoring, that, oh, it was THQ making the, you know, Volition do that kind of shit.
And then Saints Row 4 came out, and they whored the DLC just as much, so...
I was proven wrong there, so who knows.
Although you have to admit, that free GAT5 DLC on Tuesday was brilliant.
It's not brilliant.
It seriously is not.
No, I understand the joke.
I understand the joke.
Yeah, haha, it's funny.
It's GAT5, and we're going to confuse people with the hashtag, and oh, it's going to be hilarious and stuff, and then...
and then the game sells 800 million dollars worth and then they kind of quiet and go into a corner because you know it's just cool yeah cool it's fun to poke fun at Grand Theft Auto you know because your game started off as kind of a clone of it and um
The problem is they have these little DLC packs and I understand it's free for a day.
And I did download it because it's free.
I'm not going to pass up some of them for free.
It's just $2.99 here, $2.99 there, $2.99 there for all stuff that's already in the game.
It's just being unlocked.
Come on.
I mean, and I'm really waiting to see what the first DLC pack was because if it's anything as far as like sparse and content like it was with the third, I'm just, I may be done with the series just because I don't like that kind of practice where it's just, we're just not, we're going to totally just drop the ball and not give a shit and push stuff out really fast and try to make a quick buck because it shows.
Alright, well moving on, let's go to another story, you know, Grand Theft Auto 5 and Saints Row 4 will not be on this console, but maybe later, we'll see, and the PlayStation 4, of course, is out in a couple weeks, and some live streamers
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
have the PlayStation 4 through HDMI, their capture box, but there was a concern that would not work because on the PlayStation 3, you can't do that right now.
You can't capture through HDMI unless you do some nefarious HDMI.
It's component to HDMI.
Yeah, a lot of folks do component cables instead and capture that way and stream that way.
Yeah, because that's what I have to do with my Elgato.
They have a special adapter that you plug in.
Well, live streamers around the world, I'm sure happy to hear this week.
Brad Douglas, who's the head of third-party relations at Sony, said the PlayStation 4 will support video capture via HDMI.
Now, my question is...
I always thought it was the Blu-ray's fault that a lot of this was blocked on the PlayStation 3.
So have they figured out a way on the PlayStation 4 to enable the encoding when it's in Blu-ray mode?
Because I would think that's a given.
I would think that even though this news is out there, they've got to not allow you to put the Blu-rays up.
It's too easy.
They probably found a way to turn on and off the HD encryption thing.
So my real question, building on that, and yes, I'm being tinfoil hat again, but if they can turn it on and off at will, what's to say this is going to be any different from the built-in Twitch streaming at the end of the day?
What do you mean?
If they can turn it off and on, won't they be able to turn it off when they want?
Let's say a developer doesn't want the ending of the game broadcast, can't they shut it off?
Hmm, maybe.
I guess it's possible.
Also important to put out there, one of the big reasons why people want to do their own HDMI grabs, it's for, I guess I shouldn't really say it's the Twitch TV people, but a lot of the YouTube people who want to record a gigantic amount of footage and then edit through it later on, that's the real thing.
and DarkSakura.
DarkSakura,
I mean, they're not going to do that.
It's a fucking HDMI in.
That's like saying, hey, I just learned that I can plug my PlayStation 4 into the wall.
Yes, actually, if you put a PlayStation 4 in the Xbox One, Nedry will come up on the screen and go, ah, ah, ah, you didn't say the magic word.
Ah, ah, ah.
That reference straight out of 1994, y'all.
Look it up.
Hey, to be fair, they did a 3D re-release not too long ago, so it is somewhat rare.
Fair enough.
And there's going to be a fourth movie.
As long as we don't have any fucking gymnastic people in that.
It should be all good.
I wanna see them go a little ridiculous with that.
I want, like, you know, raptors in trench coats and stuff, and they're like, oh, clever girl.
Okay, obviously we're talking about Jurassic Park, so obviously we blew the cover on that.
I gotta say, though, Jurassic Park 4, I wanted to either be, like, really good like the first one was, which is, I enjoyed the first movie, say what you will, but at the time, you know, when I was in high school and that came out, that movie was awesome, right?
Or I wanted to be, like, over-the-top showgirls bad.
Yeah.
but you know what?
I'm thinking with the technology today, we can have it both and you know why?
It's because you have Jurassic Park 4 and say that'll be a great movie or something, let's just hope that it is a great movie and then you have Asylum putting out like Cretaceous Park 5 or something like that and that'll be fucking terrible Okay, good point Or the sci-fi movie Dinosaur Hurricane I don't know
Actdeft in chat, piggybacking on this whole, not the Jurassic Park part, but the whole Sony PlayStation 4 on an Xbox One.
Actdeft in chat says, what's next?
Sony making computers with Windows in them?
Oh my gosh.
Oh my gosh.
Or Sony developing apps for Microsoft Windows?
No.
Shame.
All right, let's move on.
DarkSakura, you got a story and then release dates.
I might.
I hate mobile sites so much.
I'm telling you, Chrome.
You can do the desktop sites on Chrome.
Yeah, but I'm opening the links out of email.
Well, that's your problem.
Well, it's going to be everyone's problem because the stupid thing doesn't want to load.
Can't you change it to default browser?
Oh, wait.
I'm sorry.
It's iOS.
I think you can in the new one, can't you?
I could be wrong.
I don't know.
There we go.
Have you played with iOS 7, Loki?
Fuck no, I haven't updated.
My iPod is seriously like... I don't even know if iOS 7 supports my iPod.
I have an iPod Touch 4.
No, it won't.
I think they said, Ah, fuck you!
Ah, fuck you!
Sorry, Jamie.
I was trying to buy you time.
Thank you.
Well, we did tease this at the start of the show.
And we've talked about before about the state of Atlas that they filed for bankruptcy.
Their debt was 2.45 billion yen, which is quite a bit of money.
And so...
The company that's come out on top for the purchase is Sega Sammy.
Or, I just like to say Sega.
Because we all know who's wearing the pants in that relationship.
Or as we all like to say growing up, Sega!
Pretty good that they bought somebody because they don't have anything fucking coming out.
Nothing.
Sagan needs to buy their building back in San Francisco.
They're the one company that sends me updates to their release calendar every week on Friday.
Every week.
And there's always, no changes have been made.
No changes have been made.
Nothing is coming out.
Well, at any rate, it came out on Nikkei that they are going to be acquiring the whole thing for 14 billion yen, which is roughly 141 million dollars to purchase the company.
So, this probably means that we might see them continuing with the Shin Megami Tensei games.
That's a given.
Yeah.
But I can't wait for the crossovers with other Sega games.
You know, when there's the inevitable Sega racing with Danica Patrick in the cast of Persona 5.
That would be so weird.
So...
Technus in chat says Sega Atlas, and Fifth Dream says Atlas Sega.
But anyway, the company itself hasn't made the announcement on it yet, but it is public on Nikkei, so take it for what you will.
Some folks disappointed, I don't know how to really use that word in this context, but some folks were disappointed slash surprised slash I don't know that it wasn't Nintendo that
Who bought Atlus?
Thinking that Nintendo might want to grab Persona as an exclusive for the Wii U and DS and so forth would have been a pretty big thing.
So any thoughts on that?
Why maybe Nintendo didn't decide to do it?
I think Nintendo's got their own thing going on.
If they're going to purchase a company, my thought is that they would purchase one that has a little bit more that would work with them.
And given that Nintendo's already been working with Sega, it doesn't mean that we're going to see any fewer Atlus games come out on...
Brain Fart, and Nintendo Systems.
I think also it's just that they don't sell a lot of copies.
People recognize it and it's definitely a series that a lot of hardcore gamers are into.
They have a lot of series that hardcore gamers are into but their best selling game is just kind of moderate selling for any other company.
That's the thing.
I think to buy the company for a lot of money doesn't make any sense because you're not going to make your money back very fast.
so that's probably why and I mean if you think about it it's not going to make anything really exclusive because most of the games come out on 3DS and stuff anyways PlayStation 3 occasionally but I don't think I don't know maybe it would you know coax them into making more games for the Wii U or a game for the Wii U because they don't have any so I don't know alright well let's travel around the world and check out some release dates
Okay, so in the U.S., there's a few games coming out.
They have this Batman Arkham bundle, which is the last two Batman Arkham games, Arkham City and Arkham Asylum.
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 on DS and 3DS.
Did that movie necessitate a sequel?
Apparently from a small company called GameMill.
Yes, it did.
Okay.
Movie tie-in games do well in 3DS.
Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and of course not to be left out.
FIFA 14 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and Vita, well technically it's FIFA 12 but they've re-skinned it a few times.
So, FIFA 14.
Totally brand new edition.
Armored Core Verdict Day on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
Scribblenauts Unmasked, a DC Comics adventure on Wii U and 3DS.
And last but not least, if you are looking to pick up a 3DS XL system, there is one for Pokemon X and Y. Or, I should say two.
One blue and one red.
Those are coming out on the 27th, which is Friday.
All right.
Shall we travel to Japan together and look at some release dates there?
I wish.
There's a lot coming out on the 26th.
I hope you all are ready.
There's a heck of a lot of games on September 26th.
So here we go on the PlayStation 3.
Arcadius no Ikashuhime, Armored Core Verdict Day and Regular and Collector's Edition.
Ayu Densetsu Sen no Kiseke comes out in regular and limited edition.
Iu Sen Hime comes out in regular and limited edition.
Musou Orochi 2 Ultimate in regular and premium box.
And Ore no Emoto ga Kona ni Kawaii Waka no Nai.
Oh, I can't believe my sister's that cute.
That was a funny anime.
So that, well, if you want, there's the HD Complete Box version of that, which I imagine the anime included.
The anime is basically this guy whose little sister likes to play dating sims.
But the ones in particular that she likes are Big Brother Little Sister Dating Sims.
That sounds awkward.
It is, but it is hilarious.
I'm also quite, like, I'm just, like, blown away for a minute by the fact that, like, you understood me speaking Japanese.
Like, I'm getting a little, like, wow.
Like, I always thought it was the big joke that I can't pronounce any of these names, but... Well, it was certain things, certain parts of the... Well, when I heard... The moment you said Ore no Emoto, I was like, oh, God, is he going to say... And then the moment you said Kawaii, I was like, oh, yeah, that's it.
Fair enough.
Yeah.
All right, Painkiller Hell and Damnation...
That sounds like a Loki kind of game there on PlayStation.
These are all still PlayStation 3 and all on September 26th.
Ruha Tomo Wo Yobu in regular and limited and Shutsu Geki Otometashi no Senjo 2.
That's a price reduction, however, so don't get too excited about that.
To register for participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VOGnetwork.com, use the passphrase TOWER.
On the Xbox 360, far less to look forward to.
Armored Core Verdict Day and Painkiller Hell and Damnation come out there.
I'm trying to see if Painkiller is a riff on a franchise we have here.
I don't recognize this.
No, Painkiller is a game that came out a while ago on PC.
Painkiller Hell and Damnation also came out as well.
It's a really hard game, like, first-person shooter in hell.
And you have, like, all sorts of crazy weapons and stuff.
But, yeah, it's also out here on PlayStation 3 at some point as well.
All right, we'll go into the PlayStation Vita.
DJ Max Technica Toon gets a price reduction in Japan.
That's the Japanese version.
Those of you interested in importing it, though, might want to take the opportunity.
Musou Orochi 2 Ultimate in regular and premium.
Ruha Tomo Wo Yobu.
comes out as well, and Io Densetsu Sin no Kiseke comes out, and there's a bunch of little things, like the stickers for the Vita and those types of things, to celebrate the release of that game.
On the Wii U this week, Dragon Quest X has a new version, like a new price version out this week.
Epic Mickey 2 Futsatsu no Shikara, that's their version of Epic Mickey 2, but of course localized for Japan, is out there, and then The Legend of Zelda 2,
Kazeno Takuto HD, which of course is... Anybody?
Wind... Wind Waker?
Wind Waker.
I just knew wind.
And on the Nintendo 3DS, again, a lot of games this week in Japan.
We've gone through like three weeks of a dry spell, though.
Epic Mickey on the 3DS, Gardening Mama on the 3DS, Makai Oji Dario no Hiho comes out in regular and limited edition, and...
some Puyo Puyo stickers.
There's no game, just stickers.
Thought you'd enjoy that.
How about Tokimeki Memorial Girls Side Triple Pack?
It has all three Tokimeki Memorial games on the 3DS all in one.
All the girls side games.
That's it.
How about the UK, Loki?
Loki?
I'm sorry, DarkSakura.
I don't look like her, I'm sorry.
Jeez, Rob.
I just wanted to hear about more shooters in hell.
Sorry.
Well, on the 24th, we have Alien Rage.
And on the 26th, there's Shadow Warrior on PC and Train Simulator 2014.
On the 27th, Armored Core Verdict Today, FIFA 14, and Inazuma 11-3 Lightning Bolt slash Bomb Blast.
That's it.
WeSports in HD
Let me pause for a second and let that sink in because I don't really see how Ichi is going to improve this.
But sure, why not?
Anyways, so they're going to have Wii Sports, which is not a bad thing because people play Nintendo for Wii Sports nowadays.
And it's coming to the eShop on November 7th.
And they're going to start with a few games.
And so they're going to start with Boxing.
WeSportsResort.com
and online multiplayer versus mode.
Okay, that's pretty cool.
Nintendo's going online with something.
That's always exciting because it never fucking happens.
It says it'll allow players to register and create state or regional clubs.
It says people will be able to play casually against members of their own club or take on rival clubs.
and then Wii Sports Club I guess they have this weird thing that you can do as well if you don't want to buy the games outright they can 24 hour period to trial or try the games that are available after the trial there's a day pass available for $1.99 or permanent purchase for $10 per individual sport it's a little high if you ask me well it's what five games
Yeah, I mean, when you consider that no one plays baseball and no one really plays... Well, I kind of like that, that, you know, let's be real.
I only want the tennis and the bowling, as I'm sure a lot... There's a few people who want the others, but I only want the tennis and the bowling.
And those are the ones I want to play online.
So that's kind of nice that I can only buy those.
And it's really fascinating to me that they are basically opening up the idea of...
and DarkSakura.com.
Here's something else they're testing.
Wii Fit U. So Wii Fit U is going to be available November 1st as a download.
And then later on, December 13th, they'll be coming out as a bundle.
And so November 1st, you will have one month to demo the game.
And that's if you have a Wii Balance board.
And then if you decide and you like the game, then you need to purchase a Fit Meter, which is their little pedometer thing that's going to tie into it.
and then I guess the fit meter is priced at 20 bucks and that's also coming out on November 1st and then once you have that if you want to buy the package you know that's going to be coming I guess December 13th and then the full game download is coming February 1st it's a little different I guess
So how's your Wii Fit board holding up?
Yeah, my Wii Fit balance board right now, true story, is propping up the television you see over there because you'll notice it has to be propped up a bit to get over the sound board.
We didn't have anything that was just the right height except the Wii balance board.
Thanks for watching!
Well, and it's kind of fascinating to me that it's like, all right, so here's the deal, yo.
If you had Wii Fit before, you get it on this day, and it's like free for a month, but then if you want to keep it, you've got to buy this thing.
But if you don't have any of it, we'll have it all out on this day, and then you can download it on this.
I'm like, I've gone cross-eyed from how weird.
They're trying to get return customers.
well yeah and I don't like I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad idea but it's the whole thing is just very like it's not what I expect out of Nintendo at all I guess that's a good thing though because if you think about it that means if I was a supporter of Wii Fit I can get this upgrade for 20 bucks and let's be real it's probably not going to be much different than the Wii versions it will be an upgrade that incorporates the pedometer or what have you so it's
It's kind of refreshing that I can get that for $20, assuming my stinking balance board will still work after having a TV sitting on it for two years.
Didn't I try to borrow it once and it didn't work?
Hey, here's a fantastic idea.
I mean, it's just so out there and crazy.
Why don't they fucking have it tie in with the 3DS that has a goddamn pedometer built into it?
Oh, but that would be too fucking difficult for them now, would it?
I would imagine what they're really going after are those like the, what are they called?
The Fitbits?
The things that people can wear on their hands like the bracelets?
That's what they're going after, right?
That makes me think of, what was the thing they used to have?
The monitor?
Oh hell, I don't remember.
The Genki monitor or something?
Yeah, something like that.
Yankee Monitor?
I don't know.
I know what you're talking about, but there was another game that came with two little pedometers and you plugged it into your DS or something and it said, you walked 500 steps today.
Let's upload it to the internet and see how far the world has walked to the moon.
Would you walk 500 miles?
It was like a non-game game.
You know what that makes me think of?
Oh my God.
It makes me think of Noby Noby Boy on my phone.
Kind of.
Because you have to make him grow and then he has to reach girl or it's how long it takes girl to reach earth or some shit.
DarkTetsuya says, walk it out.
That was the one that was the Konami game, I believe.
And then VXChaseXV says, I want Pokemon Pikachu pedometer integration.
That was a thing too.
I forgot about that.
One of the Pokemon games had that thing too.
I miss my Pikachu.
Alright, anyhow, let's talk about this as long as we're on Nintendo because this news gets me very excited.
I want this version of the game to happen and it's Soul Calibur 2 HD on the Wii U. Sit down, it's not confirmed yet.
But what is being talked about is that GamesRadar talked to Namco Bandai at a pre-Tokyo Game Show event, I believe, to see if the development team would consider bringing Soul Calibur 2 HD to the Wii U. Because as you know right now, the game is only coming out on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.
But I think many of us remember the GameCube version as being the definitive version because it had Link.
Remember?
So even though it's cool that, you know, Spawn and Heihachi are going to be in the other ones...
We want Link!
And we want it on Nintendo.
So GamesRadar was told that if the game does well, it's a possibility.
They even encouraged people to spam the producers' Twitter if they're interested.
It doesn't have anything to do with the fucking popularity of the game.
It has to fucking do with the fact that there's not a lot of console sales.
And I'm betting that Tekken Tag Tournament 2 probably fucking bombed on the Wii U. That's why it's not coming to the goddamn Wii U. It's not because they just...
Yeah, but if they're writing it for 360, how hard... I thought the Wii U was supposed to be built so that it could take 360 ports really easy.
I understand it could take ports really easy, but the thing is, why spend the money to port a game if you're only going to make X amount of sales?
It costs money to do a port, regardless of how easy it is.
It's still... And my thought is, you're saying that it has to sell well in order to do the port, and I'm like, well, I don't want to buy the game twice.
So if I buy it on PlayStation, that's it.
I'm not going to buy it again.
It's free to play.
No, you're thinking of a different Soul Calibur game.
Soul Calibur HD is not.
You're thinking of the one we talked about last week.
I thought that was the free to play one.
Not Soul Calibur HD.
Soul Calibur HD is... That was...
That was some new game in the series.
It's on PlayStation 3.
It's not... No, you're crossing your Soul Calibur wires.
You're forging a new destiny for the game.
I was thinking about the Soul Calibur 2 HD.
That's one of the three import GameCube games I have, was Soul Calibur 2, just so we could have Link, so we could have it early.
Mm-hmm.
SSJ100Matt says, ugh, I hate it when they pull that shit.
Quote, if it makes enough money.
Such a cock tease.
Do it or don't do it.
Stop stringing people along.
Amen.
Just do it.
Talking about fitness and all this stuff.
It's just probably people asking them about it.
That's all.
It's not that they came out and said, we have an idea for a game we're going to make, but only if it sells well.
Only if it sells well, so everybody go buy it.
I mean, they're not Konami or something.
We have no intention of ever making it.
I'm sorry, we're not going to put that game out unless you pre-order X amount of copies.
Alright, that definitely does it for that story.
Let's go back to a time when, you know, it was a whole lot easier than this.
And there was really only two consoles.
I also have an announcement after this too, about the segment.
DarkSakura.com
Mischief Makers.
Get it?
Okay.
Anyway.
It is a game developed by Treasure and published by Amix in Japan and published by Nintendo in the U.S.
It was on the Nintendo 64.
It came out in 1997 as one of the first 2D side-scrollers on the Nintendo 64.
And so your main character is the ultra-intergalactic cybot J. Marina Lightyears, or as she's also known, Marina, who is a robotic maid.
so you go through the game and it's pretty average side-scrolling thing except it's a treasure game so you know weirdness is going to ensue so she can pick up her enemies, objects, weapons and even some energy projectiles and they can be thrown or shaken depending on whatever the object is and crystals can come out and whenever some other objects are shaken there may be another effect that happens
And then you have another character named Teron who's able to play in other levels and has punches and kicks and blocks and he can hang from the ceiling and he can jump three times consecutively.
There's a golden gem in every level and what it does... God, I don't know what is up with OS.
Anyway...
Um, so if you have, um, the gems, they're used in the final cutscene of the game by, um, adding, uh, one to three seconds to the ending.
So the extended ending has, uh, extra, uh, character development for the villains and other secrets that happen.
So the way that you get the gold gem, it differs from stage to stage, so I suggest finding a walkthrough if you're going to play it.
So you have other gems in the game, they're red, blue, green, and like I said, the gold one.
And some of them give health for Marina, red giving the lowest, gold being the highest.
And then each stage is numbered like a Super Mario Bros.
level, like a 1-1, 2-1, 2, etc.,
and the worlds have different elements like world 1 is grasslands world 3 is snow and you have different cutscenes you also get a thing called a clancer ball where Marina can throw herself out of it and aim toward another ball and these pots store different items in it so if you get the right items you can make very interesting things happen so like I said it was done by Anex and Treasure and Treasure is like
Treasure did Gunstar Heroes, okay?
They did, um, uh, Silhouette Mirage.
You know, if you want your, uh, you know, bizarre games.
and I think that it was also one of the last titles they did in a cartridge format because it was one of their early ones that did not come out on a Sega system as well they thought that Nintendo 64 was going to be the best choice for their projects of course we know how well that happened you know
It's like I said, Treasure has a track record for doing quality games with very interesting elements of gameplay in it.
The game got kind of mixed reviews.
I mean, it's definitely geared toward the Treasure fans.
But not many people were too into it because of the limitations of the Nintendo 64 in terms of graphics and the way that the game looked.
It was just like a very glorified SNES game with 3D in it.
However, I know I keep saying it, but it is a treasure game.
So if you like treasure games, this will definitely be up your alley.
And it's got really fun animation and really adorable artwork.
It's one of my favorites.
It's one of the Nintendo 64 games that I still own.
So that is my game of the week is Mischief Makers or UK UK Troublemakers.
UK UK means go go.
Now you just love to do these treasure games.
Is there any treasure games you haven't done yet?
I'm not saying it's a bad thing.
I'm sure there's treasure games I haven't done.
Alright.
I mean, what I've only done... Did I do Bungaio?
Treasure did Bungaio, didn't they?
I'm trying to think if you did that.
I think you did at some point.
All right.
Well, there it is.
And I know I've done Gunstar Heroes.
There it is, your classic game of the week, Mischief Makers by Treasure for the Nintendo 64.
So now DarkSakura would like to make an announcement.
I feel like saying parquet.
So I have a little crown like the 80s commercials.
So many of our listeners will not understand that.
That is so lost on so many.
That's always what pops into my head every time you play the stupid little fanfare.
It's some kid with the crown.
That's the Imperial.
No, I know.
Parquet was the little thing that would top Parquet.
Parquet.
Parquet.
Oh my God.
This show has dissolved into butter commercials.
DarkSakura, what's your damn announcement?
It's not butter.
My announcement is that I have, and I decided this on the way here, that I am reevaluating what I do in terms of systems for the games, and I am now going to be doing it with a year cut off.
So starting with October, I'm going to be doing games that came up through 2003.
so that I'm keeping a consistent 10-year gap.
So that's going to start bringing in, I think, later PS1 games, GameCube games, the end of the Dreamcast cycle, and I believe PS2.
We're going to start seeing PS2 games come in for classic games.
I seem to remember about a year ago you did an early PlayStation 2 game and a lot of people were like, that's not classic.
No, y'all, we're getting older because these games are 10 years old.
I think that's fair.
On top of that, I have to say that
No, I'm not doing Halo.
Chatters.
Chatters are trolling.
What started the thought in my head, and it took a while to develop the entire drive here.
I was looking back at my shelves going, oh my god, some of this is crap.
Yeah.
we do we do have a lot of shit games I mean for all of the you know 300 plus worth dollar games that we own we have some shit and I have some games that are kind of shit that I have just because I fucking wanted them like Gatchaman the shooting I got it because it was Gatchaman game shut up I have Kitty the cool which I got so I could burn you a copy if you will remember that
Somebody bought me the Hello Kitty GameCube game and it's not that great.
You know what's funny?
With you setting your 10-year limit, I want to really explain to you what this means.
What?
Because you are doing games that are 10 years or older.
You could feasibly be doing games that we talked about their launch on this program.
I was thinking about that and maybe I should put it at our launch date and earlier but I think 10 years is a good limit and it opens up I'm just thinking like oh my god I love you SSJ100 Matt for linking the Parquet commercial
Granted, we didn't expand from the music games only to all games until about, what, 2004, 2005?
So we still have a few years to go before you really hit that mark where, yes, we talked about these games when they first came out, but this is funny.
But the whole thing I'm thinking of is that now we talk about some of these games and they are classic.
We're seeing HD remakes because they are classic.
Oh, God, Rob.
Sorry.
This is linked by SSJ100Matt in chat.
Finish your thought and then I'll play this.
Okay.
But by now they are classic.
And, you know, we have to stay.
And it doesn't mean I'm going to be doing only games from 10 years ago.
I still have a shit ton of Clicovision games and Intellivision games.
to be fair you've been doing this segment since episode I mean this segment has evolved since the early days of the show because it used to be what it used to be your advice column you had your link and then the website of the yeah so now you have your classic so you've only been doing classic games since what episode 250 yeah but but that's still 270 games but that's that you've covered
Exactly.
It's not even at a halfway point anymore that I started doing this.
And for the record, I do kind of miss the website of the week just because the guy from Weeble and Bob messaged us.
That was pretty cool.
That was like a nerdgasm in my book.
Okay.
Now if I get, you know, a shout out from, you know,
from Homestuck People or from the person that does Nedroid Diary, I would be even happier.
Because those are my favorites.
But yeah, I figured by now it's time.
It's time to grow up.
It's time to acknowledge that some... I don't want to grow up.
I'm an OLR kid.
There's a million games of OLR that I can play with.
Oh, Lord.
But I'm thinking at this point enough of our listeners...
Who might have been a little too young for us back in the day.
Yes, yes.
Might appreciate something that's a little bit more in their realm of experience from time to time.
Fair enough, fair enough.
Blackwolf is trying.
He says in our chat room, Halo Classic Game of the Week, let's make it happen.
Bobby, it will happen if you send me a $25 gift card to California Pizza Kitchen.
You too can bribe DarkSakura for the classic game of the week.
Okay, so for you youngins that didn't catch DarkSakura's reference earlier, here you go, courtesy of SSJ100 Matt.
Oh my god, that font!
That came through really quiet, so sorry to the live... Atari commercials!
I will have to bump that in post-production to make it actual volume for the podcast listeners.
Yeah, that did not come through very well for live.
Sorry about that.
It's very, very quiet.
The Imperial commercials where the kids would take a bite of their toast with their Imperial butter on it, and they'd get a little crown and go, do-do-do-do!
So...
All right.
I'm old.
Shut up.
By the way, I want to point out in chat room, SHJ100Matt says, I'm putting in five bucks.
Brad says, I'm putting in five bucks.
Dude, if you guys totally buy me CPK, I'll fucking do it two weeks in a row.
Using this show for your own nefarious purposes.
Boy, oh boy.
All right.
You know what?
Hmm.
I've been doing this for a long time
Tune in and give her a dollar.
Someone sent me a dollar.
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
Oh, dude, are you guys serious?
Fuck.
I love you guys.
I have OTB.
That must be outside the box.
I have the intro for that.
I don't know if I have the... I probably have it somewhere.
But, you know, it started off with the, you know, Leonard Cohen singing Everybody Knows and then it had Loki speaking...
DDR Freak Radio Bumpers
Loki has an excuse to talk more Grand Theft Auto 5, but for a good reason.
It's always a good reason.
We'll talk about another game we've been talking about for a few weeks.
Also a good reason to talk about Mighty No.
9 and what's going on with that.
So plenty more to come when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
and DarkSakura.
I know for live tonight we're going up against what the Emmys are tonight although I mean I don't know why these award shows are such a big deal but maybe I'm just jaded from doing this on Sunday night for so long but I know the Breaking Bad finale is tonight too and I'm sure a lot of people are excited about that but that's why they have DVR
That's why you tape it.
I'll watch it later.
That's what Hulu Plus is for.
Speaking of recording and watching it later, I know a lot of people listen to us on the podcast feed, be it through Stitcher or iTunes or whatever.
I mean, there's a lot of ways to know.
Some people might still be rocking this on the PSP, which does remind me to also say olrpsp.com has closed.
I think it was this week that it finally was turned back over to GoDaddy, who I'm sure has a spam site up in its place.
um so that is no longer accessible at that website but if you do have a PSP and you badly you're like oh what was I missing at olrpsp.com even though it's so out of date uh I don't even think it it still tries to access the stream in our old network but not even their current stream like an old stream at the old network uh you can still visit the graphics Loki did do a bang-up job on the site orangeloungeradio.com slash PSP you just have to do it the long way
And I'm pretty sure the All Games radio streamer does not work anymore.
I'm pretty sure it goes to their old feed.
Because I think it had been broke at one point when they switched servers.
And everybody was like, Loki, update it, Loki, update it.
And you were like, no.
I haven't updated it in seven years.
I'm not going to start now.
DarkTetsuya points out there's also a bit.ly.
So bit.ly slash O-L-R-P-S-P will also get you there.
So there you go.
Anyhow, thanks again to all you guys who listen and participate with the show.
Speaking of live participators, it was brought to our attention during the release date segment that we go over that we missed one big release that's coming out this week, probably because it's in the download space, but some of our chatters, namely AlanAlchemy and Actdeft, very excited about Pac-Man Championship Edition Deluxe Plus, which is on PC.
I know they've been whoring it on Steam Wednesday, September 25th.
and then also the DLC pack for consoles will be the same day because I believe it's new to PC I don't think it's been out on PC yet so it'll be on Steam 9.25 and then the DLC upgrade will hit consoles on September 25th so that's it sounds like they're adding a lot to it like they probably could have done a third game out of it but they're not so just wanted to throw that out there because after all they could have done a third game but they didn't they could have not unlike another company we know right yes
Half-Life 2 DLC episode confirmed.
They need to talk to Capcom and learn about counting to three.
Pretty much the third game for Pac-Man 3 on Steam.
Half-Life 3 confirmed.
Maybe that's one of the big announcements.
Who knows?
All right.
Let us get into some rapid-fire news, some quick news.
It's funny.
Some of you guys in chat are like, I'm surprised they haven't mentioned this yet.
Well, stay tuned in this rapid-fire news.
Give us a chance.
Yeah.
Jeez, people.
Hurry up and wait, Loki.
so Disney Infinity is getting some free toy boxes as part of DLC and the first one or I should say one of them is going to be the Tron Highway so yes you're going to finally be able to get your Tron stuff in the toy box mode which is pretty fantastic heck yes
And I guess it's going to offer some cool stuff.
Racing, I guess, along tracks and stuff.
Some of the other ones are coming out too.
Sugar Mania.
So there you go.
There's your Sugar Rush stuff right there.
Monster Rally and Cosmic Platformer.
And I like this one.
It's a Trap is one that's also being released.
Because, you know, Disney owns Lucas now.
Wow.
Funny.
Star Wars Star Wars Star Wars
It's kind of cool.
Hey, you know what?
You may be able to just pick up Disney Infinity because I may be selling them on eBay soon.
Yes, because I don't have time to play it.
Granted, I'll be taking it up my entire life.
Gravity Rush is getting a sequel.
And I believe that's still coming to the Vita.
And they teased it with a trailer that came out of... What was it?
Uh...
What the fuck was this weekend?
Or this week?
Tokyo Game Show.
Hello, thank you.
So yeah, so far confirmed for the Vita, but no word yet on when, if that's going to be other systems, PlayStation 4, that kind of stuff.
I would think keep it on the Vita.
It was a pretty good Vita-exclusive game.
Although, I mean, they still give it away.
Well, if you have PlayStation Plus, you have to be on board with that.
Yeah, so that's pretty cool.
It's worth your time, though.
Yeah, and...
and the Warden one that's coming out.
And then last but not least, one of the cool pieces of integration for Grand Theft Auto 5 is this iFruit companion app that you can get on iOS.
Very disappointed that it's not on Android yet, but with it you can do a bunch of cool stuff, including customizing your car.
You can customize the license plates that are on your car, and they actually appear in-game as well.
Oh, that's kind of cool.
You can even raise Chop, which is the dog that Franklin ends up getting.
and you can train him and stuff and walk him just like you can with Nintendogs except with a little bit of a twist including he'll fetch grenades and severed hands and stuff like that and they're going to be adding apps to it as well so it's pretty cool and it's free so if you have an iOS device then pick it up if you have an Android device don't download any of the ones that are out there because they're all scam apps they're all scam right now
DarkSakura,
Kind of neat.
I like seeing the whole tie-in there.
Now that's second screen, right?
Sort of, yeah.
Speaking of second screen, something on the Wii U popped up.
A message mentioning that Mario and Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Winter Games will be available on the eShop on November 8th.
All controversy about the Winter Games and where it's being held aside, these Mario and Sonic games have done very, very well.
A lot of you guys probably really, I mean, because they're not really for hardcore gamers, they're really geared for casual gamers and kids, but these games do insanely well.
Like, it's one of the biggest properties on the Wii.
So, this is a pretty big deal.
This is happening on the Wii U.
There was a reveal trailer, if you think back to the Nintendo Direct.
Then there was another trailer that said there will be 16 events in the game.
Wii Motion Plus, Wii U GamePad, both being used.
Some will use both.
The Biathlon uses the Wii Remote for skiing and then the GamePad for the sniping.
So, there you go.
That will all be out November 8th.
No Wii Balance Board support, I see.
No, probably a little soon for that.
I don't know.
So, there you go.
As much as I don't want to get too political on this show, obviously you all know I have some strong opinions on certain subjects, and so obviously I can't condone some of these laws that we've heard about in Russia that are just back in the Stone Age.
So is Birdo not going to be allowed to play in these games?
Thanks for watching!
Twitch TV integration.
Well, it's something that's bundled with all the Ubisoft games.
So if you have it on Steam, you still have to log into your fucking Uplay bullshit.
Oh, wow.
I must not own any Ubisoft games on PC.
Far Cry 3.
I have a couple just dance games.
And Blood Dragon.
I don't remember if Far Cry 2 did.
But yeah.
Well, there you go.
Uplay will also be available on the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 when those consoles make their retail debuts.
Hooray.
But I don't know.
I imagine those consoles are already streaming anyway, so whatever.
And then last but not least, for all two of you at Orange Lounge Radio that will care about this news, La Mulana 2.
It is out there, folks.
No, all kidding aside, this is an indie game that gets a lot of attention, partially for its throwback to the retro days, partially because of how difficult it is.
But La Mulana 2, apparently not available on PC until next year, but it was spotted at Tokyo Game Show 2013.
And there's even like a little logo out there, La Mulana 2, the zeroth body, the ninth spirit.
I don't know how else to read that, the zeroth body.
Sounds right.
There it is.
and you will probably die many more times than Zero playing La Mulana 2.
I think D'Artesia needs new underwear now.
He might.
So in other news, and this is speaking of people who need new underwear, I'm thinking of my husband now.
Strider HD.
This is, did you watch the trailer Rob?
Yes, I did.
It is hot.
It's supposed to be a Metroidvania type game, which people are a little bit sort of back and forth on.
But for the most part, it's gotten some really positive reviews.
And so I'm looking forward to it coming out.
But I just wanted to mention that it is getting really good reviews.
Previews, I guess would be really, yeah.
But I think that everyone owes it to themselves to dedicate themselves to the religion of Hiryu.
And definitely check out the... You know, think about it.
Think about it this way.
Loki hasn't shut up about Grand Theft Auto V. I haven't shut up about Final Fantasy XIV.
DarkSakura will have her day when this game comes out.
I need a moment.
I need a moment.
I'm a little warm.
Do I need to get some paper towels?
This is getting gross.
Someone fetch a towel!
Also, now this is a cool game and I was watching a little bit of the play on this.
It was one of the fastest greenlit games ever.
And it went in five days.
A game by Polish developer Blue Brick called Superhot.
and basically what it is, it's basically your characters are like sort of black outlines against, you know, all white but normally shaded, you know, environment with lots and lots of red blood.
The thing about this is that time only moves when you move.
So if someone shoots at you, you can stop walking and the bullets stop.
And you can dodge them.
So it just seemed like a really neat concept.
And we've seen something like this done with Bullet Time and Max Payne, but nothing to the extent of actually having it stop.
So the only way to win is not to play the game?
Yes.
You definitely have a goal within the game, but you can move around the things that are in your way.
Loki, you just lost the game.
And last but never least, and I'm looking forward to this as well, Bayonetta actually is having a theatrical release, an animated theatrical release that will be out in November in Japan.
And I will have to talk to people who live there to tell me how it is.
Krista, go watch the movie for me.
It's named Bayonetta Bloody Fate and it will be out on November 23rd.
You know it's going to be out over here.
And people will fansub it.
Of course.
Fansubbers gonna sub.
Alright, are we ready to get to the foogle question of the week?
I sure hope so because if not, you're going to check out for a minute, I guess.
We love to hear from listeners.
So every week we ask a question at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and our Google Plus page available when you search for Orange Lounge Radio.
A lot of comments this week.
I'm not going to be able to read them all.
I'm so sorry.
But a lot of great feedback on the question this week.
Let me tell you what the question is.
It was announced this week that Wii Sports would become the latest game to get an HD version or remaster, if you will.
This is an addition to other HD remakes we've seen this year.
Kingdom Hearts, for example, and even previously with God of War and so forth.
So what's your opinion on HD remakes?
Do you enjoy them or do you think it's not a good use of developer resources?
Redertainment on Google Plus says, an HD remaster or remake might be good if the game is a revered classic, but Wii Sports?
Come on, what's next?
Golf for the NES?
Wait, I've played Golf for the NES.
It's the Grand Theft Auto V minigame.
E3VL says,
Personally, I'll pay for the game again if they add new content along with the updated visuals like the Wind Waker HD with its gameplay tweaks and the gamepad support or have additional bonus content, all DLC in the Resident Evil HD games which would cost more if obtained separately.
Good thoughts.
You know, though, if somebody is really going to ignore a classic game because of graphics, though, I really think they're missing out.
I mean, there's just some classic games you can't really HD, like Kaboom on the Atari 2600.
That is a classic game.
Kicks.
Yeah.
They tried.
Tetris, right?
The only thing that did kicks right was Miss New World.
And to be fair, the Tetris on the Game Boy, or I think the DS Tetris was amazing.
That was a great version of Tetris.
And let's not forget Galspanic is awesome.
Of course, of course.
So those are some of the answers from Google+.
Let's get to some of the answers from Facebook.
Andrew S. says, I wouldn't mind a Tony Hawk Underground, or as my friend and I refer to it as Thug Remaster.
It would bring...
It would bring it out of PS2 graphics.
Renee, our buddy from Koopa Club says, To HD or not to HD?
That is the question.
Whether tis nobler the developer to suffer the slings and arrows of outraged reviewers for not offering new and instead recycling the same game format and content, or to take arms against a sea of troubles from development, programming, and marketing, and by providing new content...
I see what you did there, and you get a slow clap.
It is a tough question that they have to ask.
RedTheHaze says, I like HD remakes as it lets people try out older games they may have missed with updated graphics and performance.
As much as I think Wii Sports HD is a good idea for new Wii owners to try out Wii Sports, it just feels icky for them to try something like this for what was a free pack-in title, especially with the lack of unified account system on with Nintendo consoles.
Other than that, HD remakes are great.
Degenerate Johnny says The fact of the matter is that many of us gamers cling to the memories and experiences of the games we've played earlier in our lives An HD remake offers the chance for us to relive those memories with a fresher feel to it That's part of the answer I'm gonna cut the rest of it for time
ForTheFallenDreams13 says, I enjoy HD remakes of games because it's just about making a game I was already in love with bigger, brighter, and more aesthetically pleasing.
Given the developer does it justice.
Also, not everyone's older consoles still work.
That's an answer I personally agree with.
unless you're me DarkCharger says as someone who is invested in a lot of HD remakes I feel they sound cooler than they actually end up being the nostalgia is often fleeting with few exceptions Scott W says I enjoy HD remakes as long as they bring something extra like Final Fantasy X HD with the international content included Kingdom Hearts looks great too
Ziba says I enjoy the HD remakes.
It's definitely the nostalgia feeling that's best.
It's even better when they add some special things to keep interest going.
Eddie K says it's a lazy but effective way to make money.
Nostalgia sells huge in the video game industry.
Virtual Phil says
also from Koopa Club says I guess if you have the money to burn then it's cool but like DuckTales HD was fun for 10 seconds and now everyone is all over the next HD remake they tend to be a bit gimmicky and that was followed by the colon X face you know what Dan is still playing that game because he's achievement hunting on it
TigerClaw says an HD remake of a game would be worth it if they add some new content to it the problem is they tend to be a shot for shot remake of the original game where you know where all the items are located and how to beat the levels I'm down for an HD version of Wii Sports as long as they add online multiplayer to it
and lastly Gamer Girl says don't know if this counts but I am really loving DuckTales Remastered I think they should come out with more because a lot of the younger generation doesn't even know the mind blown that they're missing out on again some of the answers I'm so sorry I had to cut some of those for time but facebook.com slash orange launch radio if you want to read all of the answers in their entirety a big thank you to all of you that took the time to answer that I did read them all so what are you guys thoughts quickly on HD remasters I'm
I think they're great I agree with the guy that said you know what the old consoles don't always work I like the stuff like trophy support and so on and it's just icing on the cake when they go back and make it a little bit better I'm kind of uh
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'm not getting the Final Fantasy X set because I already have X, X-2, and I have X International.
No, I have X-2 International.
So sort of like, what's the point?
I actually have the Japanese version of X. I'm a sheep.
I'm totally getting X. I want it really bad.
But that being said, I kind of want the HD Kingdom Hearts, but I'm probably just going to wait and play yours.
An effective solution.
Because I'm unemployed.
So I have to measure frugality and realism versus needs versus wants.
Final Fantasy XIV, I bought the collector's edition.
That was my anniversary present.
Grand Theft Auto V is my anniversary present to my husband because I am an awesome wife.
So we make it for occasion.
So if it came out
and DarkSakura.com
Well, he didn't say that aloud, but I have a feeling that my ability to beat Strider was one of the requirements of marriage.
And what did he have to do for you?
Fair is fair, right?
What did he have to do for me?
Not irritate me.
I don't know.
He kept me supplied in video games for the last 15 years, so I feel good about that.
Fair enough.
He hasn't kicked me out for being a shiftless layabout for the last two years.
It's not my fault I'm not employed, but still.
Fair enough.
All right, let's talk about some other gaming news and what else is going on in the industry.
Loki, why don't you start us off?
Okay, so let's talk some more Grand Theft Auto.
It sold $1 billion worth of copies in the first three days.
And that's a record.
In fact, it broke a record for day one sales, too.
$800 million.
The previous landmark, I think, was Call of Duty Black Ops 2, which only did, I want to say, $450 million.
and also it hit a billion dollars faster in Call of Duty Black Ops 2 as well.
They hit a billion dollars in 15 days instead of three.
So yes, it's the largest entertainment launch in history.
Not bad.
Fun fact, in the history of films, only 17 movies have grossed a billion dollars worldwide.
And that's total.
17 movies, total.
Now, the oldest one of the 17 is 1993.
This is like the Jurassic Park episode because that is the movie.
It's the oldest one on the list there because it costs more to see a movie these days than it used to.
If you were to change for inflation, something like Gone with the Wind or something would probably be up there.
Yeah, only 17 movies have ever done a billion dollars worth of business.
And that was over the course of being in the theater for what?
Titanic, the number two grossing movie of all time, $2 billion done.
But that was what?
That was in theaters for like six months.
And then re-released in the whole IMAX thing, right?
So, I mean, this is huge that a video game did that practically overnight.
No movie's done it overnight.
Or three days.
Still, still.
Even...
Can some folks guess some of the other movies?
The top 17 on the list?
Just for fun?
Well, I know the top grossing movie for 24 hours was Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2.
It's number four on the all-time list.
It was $91 million in 24 hours.
That was the movie record for top grossing 24 hours.
I can tell you what the top two were.
No fair peeking.
Well, I haven't because my glasses.
Because I remember the news passed when Avatar surpassed Titanic.
Avatar is the number one movie of all time, correct?
And Titanic would be number two.
Titanic would be number two, correct.
Just quickly, Marvel's The Avengers, number three.
Because of Joss!
Iron Man 3, number 5.
Transformers, Dark of the Moon, number 6.
That surprised me.
Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King, number 7.
Skyfall, number 8.
The Dark Knight Rises, number 9.
That surprised me too, because I always thought The Dark Knight did better, but I guess with the year difference.
And then lastly, number 10.
I won't read the whole list, but Pirates of the Caribbean, Dead Man's Chest is number 10.
Just kind of a fun little comparison.
Those are the movies that have raked a billion dollars.
So...
And they're just getting started.
Alright, well moving on to a game that will sadly probably not break a billion dollars because we're just not sure if the game is ever going to come out here or not.
It was spotted on Steam Greenlight this week, Ghosts and Goblins Online.
You know how they can get that to break a billion dollars?
Charge one dollar for every life.
Good work.
Dead.
Ghosts and Goblins Online, this has a long history.
You want to talk about an old game.
It was originally supposed to be a multi-platform release in 2003, but then development stopped before it was completed.
Then there was a second attempt that was also canned.
Seed9 did the whole Steam Greenlight campaign, and they were bringing back Ghosts and Goblins Online with co-op platforming, PvP combat, and frequent updates that do new items and upgrades.
I say was because then it got pulled.
Capcom actually had this pulled and we're not totally sure on what it was but their statement was quote the Steam Greenlight page for Ghosts and Goblins Online that went live yesterday was wrongly posted by the game's Korean developer Seed9 and the page has now been removed.
Ghosts and Goblins was released last year in Korea, China, and Taiwan and I seem to remember that now that there was the Ghosts and Goblins because I remember we talked about it on the show and we were like oh of course we don't get it here but they get it over there.
And there are no plans for the title to be released in Europe or North America.
Hmm, it's very strange that that showed up on Steam Greenlight.
I mean, that's more than just one person pushing a button accidentally, you know what I mean?
That's very strange to me.
Honestly, the game itself looks very different than what you guys remember from the classic days of gaming when that was on the early consoles and the arcades and so forth.
I kind of think as much as this sounds great on paper, it's probably not a game to really look forward to big time.
Alright, let's move on.
DarkSakura.
Do I gotta?
Of course I do.
Well, this is something that we've seen the Kickstarter on it was Mighty No.
9.
Well, guess what?
It is heading to the Wii U. It reached its goal of 2.2 million on Kickstarter, which also means that it's going to be on PS3, Xbox 360, as well as Wii U.
Um, there's still 14 days left on it, and if they hit 2.4 million by October 1st, it's gonna have a challenge mode.
I wanna see it on PC.
That'd be nice.
But you know what?
Fuck it.
I want this game.
Who doesn't?
Well, I guess we found out in the Fugle question the other week.
Not everybody does, I suppose.
If it wasn't that $20 could buy me probably a week of food...
I'd probably put the money on the game.
Just saying.
I thought they were releasing it on PC.
I mean, I don't know why.
They are now, and they're doing that... Oh, no, yeah, I'm sorry.
PC was the original.
Sorry.
PC was the original, and then the console was added, which was the 360, the Wii U. We were doing it through Steam.
That was it.
But now... Right, yeah.
But now the PlayStation 4 is the stretch goal.
Or did they hit that, too?
See, that just says PS3.
I don't know why I said PC.
PC.
They just said PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii U. The next goal is challenge mode.
They are up to 2.4 million, so they just hit Challenge Mode.
They just hit that today.
Oh, they did?
Okay, sweet.
They just hit it today.
End Stage Boss.
End Stage Boss is the next one they have to hit.
If they can get all the way to 3.3 million, there'll be a PlayStation 4 and Xbox One version.
It could happen.
Well, they've got eight days to go, so it's got to happen pretty quick.
I kind of don't think it's going to make the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
I think we'll be lucky if we get to this beck and call online club.
However...
If it still sells enough copies of it outside of their Kickstarter, it could happen anyway.
I mean, it's coming out next year.
It just might happen.
It might.
We'll see.
All right, well, let's move on.
Loki, a few more stories here and then the mailbag.
All right, so with all this talk about next-gen stuff, we've talked a little bit about this whole upgrade program that they're supposed to have for Xbox One and PlayStation 4.
Well, here's how it's going to work a little bit on the PlayStation 4.
To play a digital PlayStation 4 version of an eligible retail PlayStation 3 game, you have to redeem a code that comes with the game.
If you buy it on the PlayStation Store, so if you buy a digital copy of Battlefield or something like that, it will automatically unlock the game on PlayStation 4 when you play it.
um if you happen to use that code to download I think the digital version it will require you to still have the disc and the drive and they're saying that on the next gen versions of the games um will appear for like 10 bucks I guess if you have that code as well um
and then one game though that isn't going to require an additional fee to upgrade it is Final Fantasy XIV you will get a free transfer from PlayStation 3 to PlayStation 4 however it is a one time transfer so once you've done it you lose rights to your PlayStation 3 game unless of course you buy another copy
That part was weird to me because I don't understand.
You know, in Final Fantasy XI, you had all of it.
If you had, like, a 360 disc, you could sign on with your PC account.
I mean, granted, you had to... Most people still got a code because they bought the game on 360 or whatever, but it was just... I don't know.
It's kind of like you could do all of it.
But, yeah.
That square's a little backwards like that sometimes.
Well, I'm still excited at least that, you know, I'll have the PlayStation 4 version because I plan on getting a PlayStation 4 and it'll be nice to have Final Fantasy XIV on it, so...
Why play it on PlayStation 3 when I have the PlayStation 4 and that'll be... I don't understand why they... I mean, it's not like you can play the game, you know, for free or something.
Like you can play on two systems at the same time or something.
We're running out of space on this TV to hook in a new console.
So if we plug in a new console, something's getting moved to the bedroom.
and so the thought is that obviously like oh we're getting the PlayStation 4 let's put the PlayStation 3 and well technically we already Alan has both consoles they're on the bedroom TV but we'll move the PS3 with all our save files on it to the bedroom but I'm actually kind of thinking the 360 might be the one to get exiled to the bedroom
So we'll see.
I don't know.
What about the Wii U?
I mean, the Wii U, you don't need that screen.
You can play second screen.
That's true.
You technically don't even need it hooked up to anything.
Honestly, though, I'm playing more Wii U than I'm playing Xbox 360 these days.
Truth.
System selector.
Is that true facts?
True facts.
That reminds me.
I need to get on Virtual Console and get Super Mario Brothers for a dollar.
Or whatever they're charging for it.
You know what?
I probably have like five copies of Super Mario Brothers.
But not on two screens at the same time.
You know what, Rob?
You're spoiled.
She does if she has a DS copy of the game or a 3DS copy of the game.
That's true, which I think I do.
I don't know what I have.
Since we were talking about NES memories, and I know I've told this story on the show many times, but I don't care.
I'm telling it again.
One of my earliest memories of DarkSakura was when I went to her house that she had with Dan out in a seedier part of town.
Oh, the hood house.
I walked in the house, and Dan had all these guys over.
All his guy friends were over, and there were TVs all...
All over the house.
Every single person was playing.
I believe it was The Legend of Zelda.
It was.
Everybody was playing Zelda with Nintendo TVs.
And I was like, Jamie, you've got like 10 copies of The Legend of Zelda all going at the same time.
What the hell's going on here?
And she said, it's our LAN party.
It's our local area Nintendo party.
Yes.
They all started Zelda at the same time.
And they're trying to see who's going to beat it first.
And Dan's currently in the lead.
That's why I married him.
You know they still do that, right?
Or no, you hadn't married him yet, but that's why he's my man.
It took us a while to get married, but he still does stuff like that.
Or he'll have Jeff over, and they'll take turns playing through a game just to see how they can speedrun it together.
Now that is Nintendo gaming on two screens at once, or in that case.
God, literally, there's a TV on the dining room table, a TV in the living room, a TV in the back room, any place they could put a fucking TV...
with Nintendo.
It was in that house.
I'm like, your electric bill must be scary.
That was back when we were happy to have our 60 megahertz processor computer.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
POP in Music
You might have seen this.
It sometimes shows up in Japanese arcades.
There's a very famous scene in Lost in Translation, that movie with Bill Murray, that had poppin' music in it.
I did that a couple weeks ago.
So, yeah, poppin' music's out there, and it is coming to iOS.
That is the news.
Konami has announced an iOS version of poppin' music.
We don't know much more than that.
We're all just kind of crossing our fingers and our toes that it's not based off the Nintendo Wii U version, and that it is far better.
I want poppin' music, I want poppin' music
Hey, shut up, I like Gatchaman I remember, there was a pop-up music machine that was all anime music And they used to have it on Arcade Infinity And then I was playing Cat's Eye
Yeah, nice.
That's right.
I forgot that there were licensed songs in poppin' music at one point.
Yeah, it was really fun.
I had a good... And, oh, the Yamato theme song.
Mm-hmm.
The old... Well, it came out over here, Starblazers.
Wasn't the Star Trek theme in there randomly, too?
I think it was.
It's like everything's been in that game.
It was the old school one, yeah.
Everything's been in that game, but I freaking love poppin' music.
Oh, just going back, just traveling back through the past and so forth.
All right.
I could do poppin' music as a classic.
You could.
Yeah, I could.
But will I?
I don't know.
I did DDR.
Wait till we get to episode 573.
Maybe.
Hold off a little bit.
Maybe.
Maybe.
All right.
Let's go.
Let's see if our emailers take us to memory lane this week.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Again, that's Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails.
And every week, DarkSakura will dive into the mailbag headfirst and pull out some emails that hopefully do not have anthrax in them.
Or are written in Mandarin.
Oh, those freaking spam emails.
We need to... Hurt you all.
No, I know.
I'm gonna cut all those bitches.
Somebody was helping me get set up with that and all that, too.
I just... Priorities.
Priorities.
DarkSakura.
Can I still cut a bitch?
Mailbag at OrangeZonesRadio.com
No.
Okay.
But it's not like you hate Disneyland.
No, I don't hate Disneyland.
I'm talking, of course, about Disneyland.
I am thinking of taking my girlfriend to Disneyland for our anniversary in late November.
Do it!
I was wondering if you guys had any recommendation for how many days we should spend one or two.
And whether or not we should get a park cop or pass or just go in one of the parks.
Get to...
Get your park hopper, trust me.
Because, yeah, get it.
And which park is better, in your opinion, is quote, better?
The main park, if you have to pick one.
But California Adventure has tons of fun stuff.
And the good thing is that when one side is busier, usually the other side is a lot less busy.
And you can drink in California Adventure.
Which sometimes you need to get through the other park.
Yeah.
My honest advice, if your girlfriend's never been to Disneyland, did I catch that in the email?
That the girlfriend had never been or hadn't been in a long time?
It doesn't say.
If either of you have not been to Disneyland in a very long time or you've never been, take the two days to go so that way you can spend one day in each park type of thing.
Disney does have a deal.
It's not a park hopper per se, but it's one day, one park for like two days.
I think the park hoppers are a little better for what Jamie said.
You can literally hop from one park to the other.
But don't forget the California Adventure.
Ever since they finished their remodel with Cars Land and redoing some of the rides, it's not a joke anymore.
It's a premier park.
It's a fun place to go.
You can spend an entire day there easy.
The next thing in the email takes me to that point.
We are from San Francisco, so the draw of an authentic Northern California experience from Disney's California Adventure is not a factor for us.
The Whoopi Goldberg Movie is Gone
But definitely go see the Aladdin thing.
Trust me.
Go see the Aladdin thing.
The thing's awesome.
See you, lad.
I do like the Toy Story roller coaster shooter, Midway Madness.
That's super fun.
Just make sure to bring Advil because your arm will hurt when you're done.
Not if you're a guy.
No, you should be used to that back and forward motion.
Just maybe not.
No, it is kind of low, isn't it?
Let's keep going with the email.
La, la, la, la, la.
And I like the one roller coaster that's in the dark and stuff.
Oh, there's a lot of dark rides.
That's an easy way to practice, I mean.
You know what?
Anyway, I'd like to hear the host's thoughts and recommendation.
Tell your girlfriend she might need to practice.
Only if she's into reach arounds.
Stand across the room.
This poor emailer was not anticipating this.
Anyway, I'd like to hear the host's thoughts and recommendations so I can start budgeting and planning this.
Thanks and keep up the great work.
Yours truly, AZHP.
Yes.
Actually, I took Dan to see Aladdin.
And I saw Bobby saying that you took him to see.
I did when we went after E3.
I took Dan.
Dan and I went to see Aladdin and we sat next to an Australian guy and his son.
And his son was so adorable but we kept chatting with the guy and told him places to eat and that type of thing.
See, Bobby and I did both parks in one day, but he's been before, and there's a lot of things that Bobby's like, I don't need to do that.
I don't need to do that.
Bobby didn't want to do the upside-down roller coaster.
There's certain things on his list.
There wasn't an upside-down one.
At California Adventure, there is.
Oh, yeah.
But it's not even that bad.
It's so smooth.
My other suggestion would be if you and your girlfriend can put out a list and you find that there's some rides we don't really want to do, maybe you can do them both in a day.
But I would say take the time to take it slow.
If you want to make it really romantic, dude, get some reservations at Carthay Circle or Blue Bayou.
Do Blue Bayou.
I think Carthay Circle's really good.
The food's really good.
But Blue Bayou is the classic.
Blue Bayou is the classic.
You have to kind of decide.
If you really want to get laid, do both.
Well, you know, I typically do Blue Bayou when I'm there for my birthday.
And lunch is cheaper and still romantic.
Yeah, and you get free desserts if it's your birthday.
At any rate, actually this is what you should do.
Get dessert reservations for Fantasmic.
Have you ever done that?
All right, we could have a Disneyland podcast, but we better move on to the next email.
Just talk to us later, trust me.
SSJ100 Matt in chat says, OLR, helping you get laid for 520 episodes and counting.
Last email.
Greetings, Orange Lodge Radio.
I decided to send you guys an email since you have been getting very few recently.
I'm a long-time listener and a second-time emailer.
Thanks for watching!
and it's €199 with the one with the 12 gigabyte and flash storage.
But I am not sure if this is a wise purchase.
With the new consoles coming out, the system is dying and money is tight as I'm saving up for a new PC for work.
Do you think it is worth waiting for the PC version of Grand Theft Auto V?
Is there any indication that this time around there won't be a PC version?
They've already seen coding for the PC.
I think there's going to be a PC version.
It's just it's not going to be right now.
And on top of that, you won't have to worry about graphics since you're saving up for a new PC, right?
It would be interesting to hear your thoughts on the purchase of a console near the end of its life cycle, but with new machines on the horizon.
Is it still worth it because it is a Blu-ray player and does Netflix and all that?
I mean, yeah, it's fairly cheap.
I mean, it depends on what your needs are.
You know, you can build a PC that has a Blu-ray player in it too and does Netflix.
We have a PC hooked up to our TV right now at my house.
The only thing that we do not do on that thing is watch Blu-rays, which we use our PS3 for.
So it's just a matter... You might even find system refurbs that are even cheaper.
So you'd have to check.
I'm not sure that you've got Craigslist, but I'm sure that you've got thrift stores and the equivalent of flea markets.
You know...
DarkSakura.com
I would say, too, don't forget that this generation of consoles will not be backwards compatible with the upcoming... You know what I mean.
The PS4 will not play PS3 games, and the Xbox One will not play 360 games.
I know there's the Gaikai rumblings out there and so forth, but we haven't really seen that gel together yet.
We don't know what that's going to look like right now.
Something to consider.
If there are a lot of console games you do want to play out of this generation, then go ahead and take the plunge and get one of the consoles.
because this is your chance.
Although PC, certainly there's a lot of the stuff on PC.
I think you really have to evaluate where are the games I want to play, and I think it's okay to assume in that case I will be able to play Grand Theft Auto V on PC in a year.
Can you wait an entire year?
I'm almost certain it's going to be less than that, but we'll see.
I don't think so.
We'll see.
I guess it does come down to, in the end, how badly do you want it and how quickly can you recover the money that you spend on it.
Me, personally, if something was coming out, well, you know what, I'm not actually going to say that I've done it.
I got a 3DS because I wanted to fucking play Animal Crossing.
And what did I do?
I asked around on the internet if anyone was selling their 3DS and lo and behold, Slidekick was.
And so I bought his for two... Shout out for Gamebuoy.org.
Two network cards.
And then we went right out and bought Animal Crossing.
And then Dan picked up the last Fire Emblem for the Wii.
So...
I'm not one to talk.
Freaking buy it.
You really do have to weigh out how badly do you want it.
And I'll tell you this, I've played Animal Crossing every day since I bought it.
Which is saying something for me playing a game every day.
So if you're going to play Grand Theft Auto V every day, then it's probably a worthwhile purchase.
and yeah, you do get the benefit of a Blu-ray player.
It's probably still a cheaper Blu-ray player.
I think when Becky bought hers, my best friend, when she bought her actual dedicated Blu-ray player, it cost her about maybe $150 something dollars, which would probably be less in euros, but it only plays Blu-rays and you're getting a game system out of it that does Netflix and does all this other stuff.
And like Rob said, there's no backwards compatibility.
Way that and decide what you will.
So to continue with the end of this email, I love listening to the show on my commute to work.
Keep it up.
Thank you.
Thank you.
This email is brought to you by Belgium, the fairytale land of waffles, chocolate, and beer.
Martin.
P.S.
You should have Jim Sally as a regular guest on the show.
He is hilarious.
Grin.
He's welcome anytime.
And you know how to sell your country, sir.
Waffles and beer and chocolate.
I want to go to Belgium.
I want to go to Belgium, too.
You know what else we could do, though, if we were in Belgium, Rob?
Broadcast live from that emailer's house?
Besides that, we could actually cheaply travel and meet all of our friends that live in Europe.
That would be awesome.
We could go talk to our official Swede.
We could go hang out with Syl.
We haven't heard from Ake Ripper in forever.
I would love to do an OLR episode with Syl.
It would be amazing.
And then we can go find Mr. Kidman.
Didn't they used to have those contests for MTV or whatever back in the day where MTV would broadcast at your house if you won a contest?
We need to have an OLR comes to your house contest.
Whoever pays the most wins.
I'll be a fun Kickstarter thing.
I want to go to Europe.
Let's do a GoFundMe.
OLR goes to Europe.
Alright.
If that's it for emails...
All two of them!
I will tell you to send more next time.
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com And if we don't get enough emails, this next segment will only get angstier.
FUs of the Week!
I'm fairly pissy, Rob.
Why?
Because of stuff.
Okay.
So I have a list.
Fuck you to my air conditioner.
Because when I turn on the air conditioner, I don't want a face full of the inferno.
I want a face full of cold.
Thankfully, it's cool enough outside.
FU, I'm not going to say FU because the rain made today a lot nicer, but it rained for Sacramento for this time of year.
And we're going into our rainy season, but it freaking rained and I was at Apple Hill.
I was trying to enjoy myself.
Instead, I'm having to schlog up a red, muddy hill.
And then I thought I was taking a picture of a pig's cute little tail.
No, I took a picture of a pig taking a piss.
It's on my Tumblr for anyone who wants to see it.
Also, F you to guys who want their woman to take care of them and not do anything to contribute.
Of course, F you to the other way around.
It takes an equal fucking partnership.
It takes two to make a thing go right.
Well, true.
If you are in a relationship, don't expect a free ride.
Do your fucking part.
Loki!
It takes two to make it out of sight.
just F you to my throat hurting or being sore I hate that, it's annoying that's it my F you of the week goes to the casino my F you of the week goes to Thunder Valley Casino in Lincoln, California fuck them they took $20 out of my pocket and one of their machines ate it whole but here was the best part I took my mother to go see Kathy Griffin at Thunder Valley Casino because my mom loves Kathy Griffin
By the way, F you to Kathy Griffin.
Sorry, honey.
You just weren't that funny.
Like, you're funnier in your Bravo specials.
I could tell we were being workshopped.
Sorry, hon.
Just wasn't working for me.
You know, the one time I saw George Carlin was on one of his workshops, too.
Yeah.
You gotta be careful.
I've seen Margaret Cho on a workshop tour, and it was like half and half, you know?
But anyway, so where was I?
Let's see.
Oh, yes, my mom loves Kathy Griffin, right?
So I want to take my mom out to something she enjoys.
And she gave me $20 because she's like, I want to help pay for the ticket, even though the ticket was like $70.
So I want to help pay for the ticket.
I'm like, okay.
So I took her $20, put it in a slot machine right in front of her.
And I was like, your $20 is gone, Mom.
She's like, Rob, that's why you don't gamble.
Rob, you should know better than to gamble.
You know what, though?
I'm very sad that the buffet wasn't open for you guys.
It was open, it was just very crowded.
The buffet there?
And for me, who's not a huge buffet fan, their buffet is fucking good.
But the coffee shop was good, too.
That's good.
Alan took a picture of that burger and put it on Twitter.
And you know they do have Fat Burger there.
But my mom didn't want to go to Fat Burger.
My mom wanted to go and, you know, Rob.
I don't want to eat at the buffet, Rob.
People just cough and sneeze on everything.
That's how you get sick.
Buffets give you diarrhea, Rob.
I adore your mom, you know.
And your impersonation is hilarious.
Did you see the Vine I posted of my mom?
I had to delete the tweet because my mom... Rob!
I didn't say you could put that on the internet.
Rob!
Put it on Tumblr.
She didn't say I couldn't play it on my show, though.
I'll have to bring that up.
I'll bring that up later.
Let's do a news story and then I'll come back to this topic.
Alright, let's talk about the ever continuing saga in the Ouya Free-to-Games program.
Well, Ouya has removed one of the games from the Free-to-Games program and that would have been the one that was Dungeons...
The Eye of Draconis, you know, the one that they blatantly admitted that their family paid for, you know, the backing of that Kickstarter.
So they have been removed.
And, you know, they, of course, saying, oh, it appears we were thrown under the Free to Games bus.
We get their fall guy and Gridiron keeps their money.
But the thing was, though, Gridiron, I don't believe...
I believe they dropped out of the whole 3D games thing.
They said they cancelled the Kickstarter project.
They have no plans to develop on the OUYA or something like that.
I remember they said they got a ton of backers as it was so they didn't need to develop exclusively on the Ouya anymore.
And also, on top of this, the whole free games fund has been tweaked.
Now no longer will the games have to be Ouya exclusive.
Instead, they are saying for every $10,000 in rewards issued by Ouya...
Matching crowdfunding efforts, developers will need to agree in one month of exclusivity.
But they could still publish on PC at the same time.
So they don't have to just launch on the OUYA.
and then also they're saying that instead of $50,000 as a minimum the requirement is now $10,000.
So $10,000 and then for every $10,000 raised after that they will be backed another $10,000 I guess.
And they also have to have a minimum of 100 backers to be eligible.
Is this going to fix the problem that this thing has been having or is this too little too late?
I think it's too little too late, and at the same time, I still think people will try to game it.
I mean, because, you know, the Gridiron Thunder thing, I don't think the whole reason that they're saying, oh, we need funding to finish this game, but the game is literally coming out in like two weeks after it's done.
I'm sorry, I just don't buy for, you know, oh, we need $100,000 to finish the game in two weeks.
I could see a game that's coming out a year from now or something.
Okay, then you need the funding.
But if a game that's already pretty much done and they're just putting it out two weeks later, I think it was just to make up some money.
Okay, we have this really shitty game we made.
It's going to be exclusive to OUYA, but who gives a shit because we made our money back anyways from them matching our funding.
So I think that's what the scam was there.
And I still think you can see that where...
Someone has a game that's ready to go.
And why not?
Let's put it on Kickstarter.
Put the goal at $10,000.
And if they can hit it, they make another $10,000 on top of it.
And it could be a good game.
At the same time, I think it could help indie guys.
But it's been exploited three times already.
So, you know, I don't know.
I noticed that you are selling your Ouya on eBay at this point.
And do you want to give a quick plug how somebody can get a hold of that?
I just... You can follow me on Twitter.
It's just on eBay.
I mean, $32 right now.
Yeah, BlackWolf points that out in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
Loki's Ouya is only $32 on eBay right now.
And $32 with a... There's still the unused code.
Remember they did that stupid thing, the...
You're our elite, you Kickstarter backers, and we're going to give you $13.37 store credit on the OUYA shop.
Well, I haven't used that store credit, so that code is in there.
So really, you can subtract about $13 off that, and so it's still a pretty good deal.
and it works I mean it's just once again just like why maybe getting rid of Disney Infinity next week just I don't have time for all this stuff and I need to slim down you know because you know money money is tight of course for with everybody it happens especially this time of year
Alright, can we go back to stories about my mom?
Yeah, sure.
Alright.
Alright, so we're at the Kathy Griffin concert and they're playing pop music and my mom doesn't listen to pop music, right?
So she hears this song by Will.i.am and Britney Spears.
Have you heard this song?
This is what's playing.
Do I listen to crap?
My mom hears this.
When you hear this in the club, you're gonna turn this shit up.
You're gonna turn this shit up.
Oh, shit.
Shit.
Live radio.
Just play them hard.
This part, here we go.
And when that came up, my mom looked at me and goes, Rah, did Britney Spears just call herself a bitch?
I think that was Britney comma bitch.
If it quacks like a duck.
Right?
So I decided, so what do you do?
You have to capture the moment live.
So I whip out my cell phone and I make a vine.
What do you think of this song?
I think Britney Spears is a skank.
What?
What's Vine?
Oh, you don't know Vine?
It's like Twitter, but with videos.
You can only do six-second videos, and they loop, and they loop.
So that's the Vine I made is my mom's opinion on Will.i.am and Britney, bitch.
What do you think of this song?
I think Britney Spears is a scam.
Like Britney follows you Like Britney follows my ma And I even said, I'm like, Britney doesn't follow you on Twitter Well, one of her friends might tell her I think that she's been called worse Right?
And let's be real, she is kind of a skank Alright, we love her But she is entitled to be a skank if she chooses that That's right, that is her choice It is her choice as a woman to be a skank To be free with her love She's also a mother
And that's what feminism is all about, the right to make choices.
And not be judged by the man.
Or whatever.
I wish I could show my mom all the love she's getting in chat right now.
Actdeft says, love Rob's mom.
GamerGirl says, ha ha ha, oh my god, Rob's mom rocks.
She does rock, and I hope maybe we can get her on the show in the future.
I adore your mom, but I don't think that your mom and my mom should ever be in the same room.
No, they should not.
That would be frightening.
No, they should not.
especially when my mom's on one of her pissy rants
I remember them in Super Mario Galaxy.
As if the game wasn't scary enough, now you can immerse yourself in the world and become best friends with the fence like I did in Slender The Arrival.
Oh, good luck with that.
So all I'm hoping is that maybe Bobby, maybe in a year's time, Bobby will be a little more willing to subject his Oculus Rift to some other things.
So before I have the gummy bears, maybe I can play a little Slenderman and Oculus Rift.
I'm still waiting.
He got a YouTube of me playing the Oculus Rift, and I'm sure it's funny.
5th Dream Tattles on Rob Roberts to my BFF It wasn't me, it was my mom Yeah, but you made it where Brittany can see it, Rob Not anymore, I had to delete the tweet We need to get my mom on the show It's still out there if you know where to look
All right.
So there it is.
Slenderman on Oculus Rift.
I know a lot of folks here on OLR don't know my friend Gemet, which if you listen to Horde House, I'm sure you've heard him.
He's contributed to the show a number of times.
He hosts his own show, except it is also live on Sunday night.
So unfortunately, we're up against each other.
But Gemet does some amazing live streams of Oculus Rift.
If you think I scream like crazy, you should see Gemet.
I'm just going to give him some props and a shout out.
So...
All right, that's it.
That's it for stories.
It's time to go to Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and more importantly, the Skype line.
I love Twitter, too, but I like the live calls a lot.
So Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, all one word, or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
While I bring up those tweets, Loki, did you have any last-minute stories for us tonight?
No, but I'm working on researching vacuum forming for a custom case mod.
Wow.
Okay.
Remember I told you I was going to make like a... Remember that thing that is the cross plane or whatever?
Yeah.
It's funny enough, actually, the website that I was looking up the method for doing some vacuum forming stuff is actually the guy that is doing the cross plane.
I didn't realize because I immediately clicked his other links and stuff.
And then I'm like, oh, hey, scroll down a little bit.
Oh, there's a whole bunch of stuff with the cross plane here.
Oh, it's his device.
Okay.
Alright, again, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
Let me get to some tweets while we wait for the calls to come in.
JMO1986 sent a tweet that said, Currently at Tokyo Game Show 2013, telling people I meet in line about OLR and VOG Network and spreading the word.
You sir get a fast clap.
We ask at the end of every show, if you like what you hear, tell a friend or two about the show.
You are doing that.
You are a good man.
You get love and a gold star.
Yes, you do.
You get the official OLR gold star tweet of the week.
We just made that up, but you get it.
Let's see.
Actdeft sends us a tweet.
Developer WayForward wants to make a My Little Pony game and rallies bronies to tell Hasbro to make it a reality.
WayForward, of course, made DuckTales, what, they made Contra 4.
Some of their games have been a little hit and miss, but more so probably hits than misses.
Talk to Activision, because I think they're the one that has a Hasbro license.
Do they?
At least they do for Transformers, and they, no.
Wasn't Skullgirls able to get some My Little Pony stuff, or was that, no, no, it was like characters made by the same person.
Yeah, that was, it wasn't Skullgirls, it was that, um, the Fighting is Magic thing, where they, now it's something different, but, um...
yeah I don't remember who has like the family party games now because it used to be I thought it was Activision then it was or EA and now it's Ubisoft maybe I don't know that keeps getting tossed around wow I've never seen quite a more polarizing tweet in our chat room BlackWolf says don't do it way forward spend your time on better projects and Ranma says fuck yes way forward it will happen mark my words and ActDev says Gameloft has the MLB game
You know what?
If they can make Mick kids, they can make a fucking My Little Pony game.
I don't even care.
I don't care.
There's been a My Little Pony game, and I think it was on the Nintendo back in the day.
And it was the good My Little Pony.
The kind I grew up with.
If they can make Sneak King...
you go ahead with your bad self and make my where the fuck are my goddamn new 360 connect games for Burger King seriously that was promised to me like five years no not five years ago but like a few years ago I'm very disappointed that there's not a follow-up to Snake King because that was a fucking brilliant shit right there all right uh Tiger Claw says it's an interesting tweet uh Lucasfilm will combine video games and movies to act the post-production process
Video game engines will be used in filmmaking with the two disciplines combining to eliminate the movie post-production process.
well this actually kind of makes sense you know video games are getting so realistic these days that I'm sure they can probably mix in you know some of the stuff they do in movies like in the engines really kind of ramp up the process with making some of this that'd be fun if like you can move characters around in the movie and stuff interactive movies it's like using the force for real Tiger Claw also sends his tweet the PlayStation 4 exclusive Deep Down set to be free to play
Or wouldn't it be even funnier if you could reskin the characters that are in the movie or something like that?
Anything's possible.
I want Jar Jar to look stupider.
Or stupid.
Quickly, before I go to the phones, Capcom announced at Tokyo Game Show 2013 that the PlayStation 4 exclusive Deep Down will be free to play.
You might remember this had come out at, what was it, E3 or something?
They were showing that off, so that's kind of surprising.
Yeah.
So, very cool.
More on that in a minute, but first we're going to go to the phone lines and take a call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, this is Actdeft.
Hey, Actdeft, how you doing?
Pretty good, despite people hating on the MLP game, but okay.
It's tough to be a brony.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, I'm not going to talk about that.
I want to talk about another thing.
All right, something a little less controversial.
That's fine.
What's up, Actdeft?
Kind of controversial, but still.
People selling humble bundle games.
Fuck those people!
Fuck them!
Oh, that annoys me so bad!
Especially when it's... Sorry, Actdeft, I know it's your call, but you got me going.
Especially when it's... Oh, man, when it was all charity, like that EA bundle was all charity, those people that were buying the codes and selling them on eBay, scum.
And then what?
When they got confronted, it was just like, well, you know, the demand's out there, so, you know, we're just... People don't have to buy them.
Blah.
Yeah, I really hate those people.
There's a Facebook group I follow.
It's a local group that resells games and anime stuff and all that.
And there was one person that sold the Origin Bundle.
and like maybe four times the price he paid for all the games and I was like dude seriously those games were sold like for a fraction of the price you paid and they were especially they were all for charity so it's like what the fuck and now the same thing happened with another person
Actdeft
and I've called out other podcasts, not by name, but I've called out shows, podcasts, websites, blogs that give away bundle codes that are piecemealed from somebody else's bundle, the games they didn't want and it's one thing when it's between friends and so forth, but let's not forget
A lot of this money goes to charity and it goes to the developers.
When you piecemeal it like that, you're kind of taking it away from them.
And it's like these bundles are such a great deal.
Like it's just – I don't know.
I get really bothered by it.
I play devil's advocate though.
I mean sometimes like especially with Humble Bundle 9, I know I have some extra games I need to give away.
I already have those games.
And like I'm buying the bundle and I'm getting it anyways.
And I can't redeem it twice.
I mean –
Again, it's one thing if you're giving it to a friend or, you know, somebody like even somebody like a Twitter follower that you know for a long time.
I mean, that's kind of one thing.
But it's just like another to like use it to profit yourself and your own brand.
If that makes sense what I'm saying because I'm still like – Like follow this website and get a chance to blah, blah, blah.
You might still be like, oh, okay, I'm unloading my free codes.
But if you think about it,
Why doesn't your friend that wants to take the code just pay $5 to the site and have the $4 go to charity or whatever?
I don't see a problem if it's already over, like that bundle is already done.
Yeah, yeah.
It's not as bad.
Let me just put it this way.
I don't mean to be all like, if you do this, I hate you.
I'm not saying that at all.
I'm just saying, you know, think about it.
Shouldn't we be encouraging people to go buy the bundle themselves?
Because eventually the money does go to charity, right?
and especially in the case of the EA bundle I mean one can argue like you know and I think Actdeft you had a funny story about this like you know I bought a bundle but I don't fucking want Fez I am staying 100 miles away from Fez it's that's kind of a different set than what I'm talking about you know what I mean
The irony part of that is that I gave money to the developers and forgot to take out the part of the fest.
Oh well.
No well.
I don't think you can piecemeal it that way.
I do get what you're saying because I did it with my...
I gave it to people that maybe wanted the game and I didn't profit from it.
I didn't want more followers.
I didn't want more people to follow me on Twitter or Facebook.
I just, hey, who wants a code for this game and this game?
Oh, yeah, I want one.
And some were close friends, so...
I don't mind that.
But yeah, like you said, like, oh, follow me and get a code or something like that.
Yeah, that's pretty shit.
I don't mean to be like calling people out or whatever.
Maybe a little bit.
But because Bobby's in chat going, I shouldn't give away my bastion code on the show.
Rob hates me.
And I'm like, no, that's not what it is.
I don't hate you.
I'm just saying, think about it this way.
Think about it this way.
Shouldn't we really be encouraging people to go buy the bundles and give the money to charity and so forth?
And then maybe after the fact, you know, a long time when that's no longer an option, maybe give away the bastion code or whatever it is.
That, I think, is acceptable.
Yeah.
You know, I've probably got duplicate codes for some games because I bought multiple bundles.
And I don't mind if it's a friend of mine giving away a code.
Yeah, me neither.
I usually just give them to Dan.
There you go.
So anyway, sorry Actdeft.
I just wanted to clarify before the hate mail started rolling in.
Oh, well, that's pretty much it.
Like I said, even then, I don't mind people giving away the codes.
It's selling them for a profit.
Yeah, that's the really bad stuff.
If you're selling these on eBay, if you're flipping this on eBay, then I hate you.
Then it's okay to say that Rob hates you.
I would absolutely hate you if you flip these on eBay for a profit.
So...
definitely alright, Actdeft, thank you for the call that was a great topic to bring up and got me all revved up for a rant good for you well, thanks take care buddy you too
Alright, uh, 1877 GameOLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
We certainly have time to take one or two more calls.
Meanwhile, I wanted to kind of get back into this deep down going free-to-play.
The Capcom's role-playing game should be arriving as an open beta near the launch of the PlayStation 4 in Japan.
That would be like February 2014.
And it will have procedurally generated dungeons and runs on the new Panta Ray engine.
That's a Capcom engine, so...
The Panty Raid Engine Hi, this is For The Fallen Dreams, can you hear me?
Greetings!
Hi, yeah, it's been a while since I've called in.
I'm normally a podcast listener because I'm East Coast.
I'm in South Carolina.
So that's all I really have time for is the podcast.
But I thought I'd call in and give you guys a shout.
Happy midnight.
Yeah, I appreciate you staying up late.
I appreciate you staying up late to listen tonight.
Yeah, it's about midnight now.
So it's been a while since I've listened live.
But yeah, I just wanted to give you guys a shout on
I've been listening for about, I would say, six, seven years now.
Wow.
I think the reason why I remember is because just one podcast I listened to, and I don't know why I remember this, but it was like y'all's fourth birthday.
And I think at a certain point, DarkSakura had said, like, we're this many.
And they held up a certain amount of fingers, and you were just like, yeah, that's great radio.
Yeah.
That sounds like our show.
That's been us forever.
She does that every year too.
She couldn't do it this year because she'd have to put up a toe as well.
I stick my nose in the air.
That's just how I keep tabs on how long I've been listening.
It's great to finally call in this time.
I've gone under different
Game of Thrones Game of Thrones Game of Thrones
So, you know, we really appreciate everybody who tunes in and listens.
So, well, I don't want to just have this call be you saying nice things about us, although I really appreciate that.
Tell us what games you've been playing lately.
What kind of video games are you into right now?
As of recently, obviously, Grand Theft Auto V is occupying a lot of my time.
Got it on PS3 since I've kind of chosen to boycott any type of...
Xbox related, not Microsoft, but Xbox related products.
But yeah, other than that, Grand Theft Auto 5, Borderlands 2, I know is not as of recent, but a lot of PS3.
Are you looking forward to PlayStation 4?
Are you going to give it a little while before you pick one up?
I may give it some time.
I am really stoked about The Division.
Tom Clancy's The Division.
That looks amazing.
But just the one game isn't enough for me to drop coin on a $400 system.
So I'm going to wait until a couple other games come out and then I'll merge.
Fair enough.
Fair enough.
Well, for The Fallen Dreams, I appreciate you calling the show and giving us a shout out.
And it's always nice to hear from all of our listeners.
And thanks again for staying up late with the show.
Not a problem.
I hope to hear from you guys soon.
All right.
Take care, buddy.
Take care.
All right.
Night.
Bye-bye.
Good night.
Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
I'm fantasizing right now, Rob.
Huh?
What?
Over CPK.
I haven't had California Pizza Kitchen in like forever.
Do you want to go to CPK sometime this weekend or something?
I do.
I just have to have a good week and then I can go.
All right.
We'll figure something out.
Because honestly, I'm in love with a pair of Gorgonzola pizza.
I like, um, I like the barbecue chicken pizza, but you can kind of get that at the grocery store.
I know it's not the same thing.
The Jamaican jerk is pretty good.
Yeah.
But, but I'd say when I'm feeling extra treif, it's the shrimp scampi pizza with extra garlic.
We're this many!
I put it on the table.
They can't see you.
So?
Unless I take a picture and then you'll get mad at me for taking a picture.
No, then I'll channel your mom.
Ah, but it won't get on the internet.
Britney Spears might see it.
I don't want Britney's friends to post it.
As if Britney Spears gives two shits about Orange Lingerie.
You know, I had a friend that went to high school with Britney Spears.
Really?
He said she was a total bitch.
Alright, I got a few more tweets here.
SSGO100Matt sent us a tweet about this.
I want to get your thoughts on these all-in-one classic gaming machines like the Retro N5.
Gaming purist friendly?
Question mark.
I've seen reviews of some of those the key word is purist and I'm going to say if the word is purist then no they're not gaming purist friendly because pretty much these things are emulators in a box and so they are going to have the slightest things wrong with them but if you just want shit tons of games in a box to play on the TV 99.9% of people don't really care and so whatever go for it
with the big problem with some of those by the way in reviews that I've watched because Dan and I watch reviews for a number of those things typically it's sound because keep in mind especially with the Super Nintendo it had that Sony sound processor you're not going to get the same quality it'll come out sounding it'll miss sounds or something you'll be wrong with it
Just so you guys know, on the Retron 5, if you hadn't heard of this, it has five cartridge slots.
Look at that.
The NES, the Super Nintendo and Super Famicom, the Genesis and Mega Drive, the Famicom, so you can play not only NES games but Famicom games, and then they have a GBA, GBC, GB slot that plays all those games, so Game Boy games on that as well, and you can hook that up to the telly and play those games.
HDMI output, that's pretty cool.

and had like this series to have it run off of one power supply and one hookup cable so they got I think one successfully working version of it but it ended up being some prohibitively expensive thing but it legit runs on the actual hardware
Alan Alchemy in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, if you're really a purist, you'll play your original game carts on a 300-pound, 22-inch CRT TV from 1993.
You know what, though?
Alan brings up a good point with that, and that is the one plus side about these systems is that it plays through HDMI port.
Let's be real.
A lot of modern TVs, you can't hook up classic game consoles to them.
You cannot hook up an Atari 2600.

For the Fallen Dreams is in our chat room as well and says, remember when Channel 3 and 4 was the game input channel?
Pepperidge Farm remembers.
I remember.
I remember well because in Sacramento you had to use Channel 4 because Channel 3 is a legit channel here.
It's NBC here.
So you have to use Channel 4 because you could never get a signal on Channel 3.
It's noisy because of the KCRA.
Three was a used channel in Mobile, but I would still use it because it would actually be clearer for my screen signal.
Yes, it's true.
There's a channel four in the Bay Area, but the signal's very weak here in Sacramento.
But I would always get pissed off because my brothers would try to steal the remote, and they were little brats.
Well, they're still brats, but they're older brats.
I will never forget being young and trying to get the channels from San Francisco I don't remember why I was doing this but one time there was something I really wanted to watch that the CBS channel here wasn't airing and so I had to try and get the antenna just right if you held it just right I could get channel 12 out of Chico just right
Don't let go of it or I won't be able to see the Charlie Brown special or whatever stupid thing Channel 12 was airing.
I had a fun day when I was sick and staying home.
Now keep in mind, the town I was born in is Dothan, Alabama.
Right.
Which is a good four hours away if you drive through Alabama.
It's like three and a half if you go through Florida.
So I was sitting going through the static channels because I would do that for fun.
Don't ask, I was weird.
Born.
No, I was eight.
it doesn't matter and so one day I managed the Dothan channel came through and I was sitting watching WG that was the Chicago station that would get through cable but it was like whatever the Dothan station that I used to watch soaps with my granny I was watching TV all day on the staticky ass Dothan channel and then figured out that if you put tinfoil on your rabbit ears you can get a really good signal
Okay, for real, this is the last call for calls.
1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
I just wanted to say this real quick about the whole TV channels.
I just lost my train of thought.
Damn it.
Radio guys, worst enemy.
Oh, I know where I get the whole thing from.
Because I'm still totally a nerd.
At night, I like to see what AM radio stations I can get in the car.
Because late at night, you can get stations from all over.
Because at night, they're allowed to increase the power.
So you get stations from all the way to the Midwest.
I think we can get stations.
I know we get them from Colorado, Seattle.
We can get them on AM.
and I know where I get that from is my dad because I remember growing up my dad had one of those um it wasn't it was like a radio that did like the shortwave yeah yeah and he he used to listen to stations out of like the Netherlands and things like that and he just like not that he could understand we have internet radio for that a lot of stations well remember when OLR started on live 365
and we went to that award ceremony when they were kind enough to nominate us that one year and then forget to read our name a lot of the people we met in that community were all guys that used to do and girls that used to do like ham radio and that type of like I never realized until that day how many people from the ham radio shortwave radio kind of just naturally fell into internet broadcasting
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I listen to that because sometimes it's pretty fun and you can hear odd things going on in the background.
Or the ones that give the weird frequencies.
Those are the ones that I'm interested in.
And every so often you can pick those up on shortwave as well.
All right.
Well, that's going to do it.
Nobody else is giving us a call, and we are through all of our tweets tonight, so I want to thank both our callers tonight.
And if somebody else had something to say, be it live or podcast, don't forget you can always email us, mailbag at orangelaundradio.com, or you can tweet us like some of our listeners did tonight at Twitter.com slash OLR.
It is definitely time to wrap up the show here.
I don't listen to the radio anymore in my car.
I still do.
I still listen to AM.
I miss DJs.
I think AM is still a good way to get traffic.
I know we have it on iPhones and all that but I still like on the phones all you can see is it's red and it's not always accurate because I think a lot of them are running off Caltrans reports but when you listen to traffic on AM radio like they'll tell you we're flying over the bridge and it is backed up all the way to this point.
Like I like being able to hear that.
So when we drive to the Bay Area... You better break out the Travel Connect 4.
You're going to be here a while.
Yeah.
Alan and I listen to 740 a lot when driving to the Bay Area to get their traffic updates.
And Actdeft, I use my cell phone to listen to music for the most part because I have an iPhone.
Yeah, I love Stitcher and all that stuff and podcasts in the car.
I just play my own stuff.
I actually have a playlist called Random Mix that's video game music, anime, J-pop, and all the other weird, crazy stuff I listen to.
Well, you know, they are saying, it's funny we bring up AM radio, they're saying that AM radio, I saw a story on this this week or last on one of the big websites like Google or Yahoo, that AM radio is kind of dying.
It's a dying art form because so many people have switched to internet and iPod and running that in their cars and so forth, which is great news for us and what we do, but...
It's the same thing that I run into, you know, being that when I, you know, picked my major, my focus was print media as far as design for print.
When it's all, when really now print design is the more of a special field now.
You know, it's dying too.
It's just sad.
Because nothing smells as good as a print shop.
Alright, we need to wrap up.
We could reminisce all freaking night, and some of you might like that, but I think it is time to wrap up the show.
Thank you guys again for downloading Orange Lounge Radio and checking out our show.
We really appreciate it, and you know what we say.
If you like the show, please tell a friend or two or five about the show.
Talk about us in a convention line like somebody on Twitter did there this week.
Help spread the word because that's all we've got.
We don't have an AM radio station backing us and putting ads out there or anything like that.
So word of mouth is all we've got.
Thank you guys, as always, for your support of the show.
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts tonight.
Loki, we'll start with you.
Your final thoughts tonight.
My final thought is I'm going to play more Grand Theft Auto.
That's a good final thought.
DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
I hate Dreamweaver.
And my final thought tonight is that if you are in the Sacramento area, you need to make plans on October 12th to come see the Rocky Horror Picture Show at the Colonial starring yours truly.
Well, co-starring me, but I will be in it.
So there you go.
That's it.
We're done.
We're out of here.
We'll see you next week, right?
I sure hope so.
Have a great week, everybody.
Happy gaming, and we'll be back in seven days to do it all again.
Good night.
Thank you for watching.
See you next week
