Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:28.000
Hot on the heels of the Playstation 4, Microsoft releases the Xbox One Million. No, Xbox releases the Microsoft One. I mean, millionaires buy one Xbox. You know what I mean. And if you don't, just stay tuned. This, Nintendo, and all your comments begin right now.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:45.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Episode number 528 for this November the 24th of 2013.

00:45.000 --> 01:04.000
You're here and we're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle. And it's me, Rob Roberts, and my co-hosts not here tonight, unfortunately, the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers. She has the night off. You know, we are getting into that busy holiday period. She had some family stuff going on tonight she had to attend.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
But, he is joining us in the studio. Say hello to Tech Master, Loki!

01:08.000 --> 01:24.000
Hi. How you doing, Loki? I'm back playing cookie clicker again, I guess. I thought you swore that off last week. I did, but then I realized you could prestige in it. So you get, you know, I guess you get some heavenly chips or some bullshit. You got sucked right back in.

01:24.000 --> 01:42.000
Yeah, it's just because I had nothing better to do right now. Are you an achievement whore? Is that what this is about? No, it's because I had nothing better to do while we were playing or waiting for the show to start. Because I was going to start Fallout New Vegas and I have that installed. I just haven't got a chance to play it yet. So, you know, I don't have time to start New Vegas right now. So, you know.

01:43.000 --> 01:59.000
So, why not click some cookies? Yep. Then you'll find a new time waster game after that, who knows. Alright, joining us here tonight, helping to fill in for host since we are down Dark Sakura tonight. You guys should be familiar with this guy by now. After all, he is the voice of the show. Say hello to Jason!

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
I may not be the happiest bunny on the farm, but I certainly am the gassiest.

02:03.000 --> 02:15.000
Ew. No. We haven't referred to Dark Sakura as the happiest bunny on the farm since like episode 31 or something. I don't know. Don't you usually intermingle that every once in a while? I swear to God. Not for the past like seven years. Maybe. I don't know.

02:15.000 --> 02:29.000
She used to be obsessed with that little happy bunny, but then happy bunny is all over like Hot Topic and everywhere. Like, you know, it was kind of like Hipster. She was more hipster with happy bunny and then like she liked it before it was cool. But I will back her up on that. She really did.

02:29.000 --> 02:39.000
But now it's everywhere, so we don't really do that anymore. But how are you, Gassy Bunny? You better watch out or you'll get that nickname. How are you?

02:39.000 --> 02:50.000
I'm quite exhausted. It's been a surprisingly non-gamey but still kind of gamey but also lots of movement in the literal sense this week.

02:51.000 --> 03:06.000
Oh yeah, you've been traveling around everywhere, right? Lots of travel. My employer, coworkers of mine participate in a corporate league and the opponents did not come up with enough players to play this week.

03:06.000 --> 03:15.000
And everybody still had all their gear and dressed up and they wanted to play soccer anyways, so I went out to the field to scrimmage with them and subsequently ached for like three days.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
Are we allowed to say where you work on air? Because it's a pretty cool company. It's a pretty cool company a lot of people have heard of, I'm sure.

03:21.000 --> 03:33.000
I work for GitHub down there in San Francisco, which is my excuse for coming into town constantly and it doesn't hurt that it's on their dime. So, you know, why not come out to Sacramento too?

03:33.000 --> 03:41.000
We don't mind at all. We don't mind at all. Now, GitHub, I don't know a lot about it, but I also don't program. And my understanding of the site, and feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
My understanding of the site is it's kind of like for people like open source code type of things, like websites.

03:47.000 --> 03:59.000
Predominantly. And even if things aren't open source and you're doing the active development in private, GitHub still applies because it's the entire suite of collaboration.

03:59.000 --> 04:08.000
And even people that are not developers, issues, managers, people that just need to go in for reviews and need to be a part of the process, it's all applicable to them as well.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
So, open source, public, private, whatever, it all works out. It is the active development and collaboration.

04:14.000 --> 04:22.000
Sometimes I do learn things from reading source code, even though I don't totally understand it. Like, you know, at work, there's a lot of Visual Basic tied into Microsoft Office, like macros and things like that.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
We actually did talk about this before, and you made that exact point, that any macros or anything Visual Basic based could...

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
Well, you know, after 520 episodes, some topics repeat themselves once in a while.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
A hundred episodes ago, you know.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
Well, okay, I don't know if I've talked about this, but I will use this as an opportunity to give a cheap plug to my YouTube channel.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
Because I've been using that more and more, right? My Rob Roberts plays and do my Let's Remember videos.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
One of the games I did this week, Dragon Fire on the Atari 2600. Did you ever play this game?

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
I did not.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Run across the bridge, run through the...

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Practically all of the Atari.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
You're probably too young. But anyway, the Atari...

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
Okay, so the reason why I bring that game up specifically is that the guy actually released the source code.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
And you can go to Atariage.com and check out the source code for Dragon Fire.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
And I find those Atari 2600 source codes amazing.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
I don't understand it whatsoever, but it's like...

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
The cool thing about Dragon Fire in particular is that it's all commented.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
Like, here is the code that shows the sprite for the chalice, you know, something like that.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
And so you can actually kind of see, like, wow, this is...

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
Like, when they have to cram all this crap into 4K.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
4 kilobytes! Or 8 kilobytes.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
We're like the average Atari 2600 size, if you think about it.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
4 kilobytes! That's nothing.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
We have a...

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
I write Word documents that are like 200 kilobytes. Easy. Easy!

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
That's because there's more background data in a Word document than there is actual text that you type into it.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
True.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
But there is a similar feat, as a matter of fact, for the classic game of the week.

05:47.000 --> 05:53.000
A similar feat of how in the hell did they do this back in the day with such restricted file sizes and everything else.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.000
Well, very cool. Sorry, we digressed a little bit there, but I find the source code stuff really fascinating.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
I also want to introduce our chat room, of course.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
We always have our live chatters with us.

06:03.000 --> 06:10.000
We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
vognetwork.com

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
And you can join us, if you are listening live, in our chat room.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
live.vognetwork.com

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
Our good buddy, Bobby Black Wolf, in fact, starts us off tonight, because I love this comment here.

06:20.000 --> 06:28.000
He says, the source code to Pac-Man on Atari 2600 is a piece of art, even though everyone considers it a terrible game to play.

06:28.000 --> 06:37.000
Well, yes, Pac-Man on the Atari 2600 was really garbage, but if you think about the time constraints the guy had to work with, it's really astonishing.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
You know, like, yeah, it does some weird shit, like the fact that the ghost can only draw one, like it has to cycle.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
That's why the ghosts blink, because it can't, like the Atari 2600 literally cannot draw all of them at once.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
So it draws these two in one frame, these two in, or maybe one each frame, I don't remember what it does.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
But it's crazy shit that, to get it to work, and he had to do it in mere months.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
And that's what fucked up a lot of those Atari 2600 games, is that they had no time.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
E.T., same story.

07:02.000 --> 07:10.000
Well, there were maybe some other decisions along with E.T. as well, but not to digress yet again on another detail, though.

07:10.000 --> 07:19.000
I could talk about old shit all day long, and considering that I have not bought the Xbox One or the PlayStation 4 yet, I'd prefer to focus on the old.

07:19.000 --> 07:28.000
It was the seventh guest in the eleventh hour that are in a really similar state, that because they were made in that Windows 95, DOS, transitional kind of world,

07:28.000 --> 07:36.000
where, you know, the modern, what are the words that I'm even looking for, the modern conveniences in libraries and DirectX didn't exist yet,

07:36.000 --> 07:47.000
and in order to be widely compatible with all the hardware that was blossoming in the Windows era, they had to, the developer had to do these really, really, really nasty, low-level, like, assembly tricks

07:47.000 --> 07:57.000
to just eke out that last bit of performance for all of the visuals and the smooth video and everything that that game employed, alongside Myst and Riven as well,

07:57.000 --> 08:04.000
just to take something that is still images with depth and the transitions and everything else.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
Yeah, human ingenuity and what computers have done for the last decade is unreal.

08:09.000 --> 08:16.000
Well, you know, there is a way to kind of tie all this talk into what's going on with the new consoles, because we were listening to Bobby's show here in studio,

08:16.000 --> 08:24.000
and just the general talk as well out there on the internet, I know one of the topics that came up on Bobby's show tonight was the fact that some of the launch games that you have right now

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
kind of look like they could be done on current consoles, and that could be done for a variety of reasons.

08:29.000 --> 08:36.000
For example, I would argue a game like Assassin's Creed 4, well, that game was always planned to be on the current and the new consoles,

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
so of course you're not going to see much of an upgrade there. But then you hear talks about a game like Dead Rising 3.

08:41.000 --> 08:49.000
You know, Dead Rising 3, some people say, kind of looks like a 360 game, even though more sprites, more things they're doing.

08:49.000 --> 08:58.000
But Dead Rising, I think the problem is, you know, people have the expectation, because last gen, well, even before last gen began, or this gen, getting confused which gen we're on now,

08:58.000 --> 09:07.000
you know, this gen I guess, they were talking about, oh yeah, 1080p, you know, it's going to be 60 frames per second and stuff,

09:07.000 --> 09:13.000
and then the next gen, okay, that's how we're going to differentiate ourselves, it's going to be higher resolutions, better frame rates and stuff like that,

09:13.000 --> 09:23.000
and then you have Dead Rising 3 come out, that's 720p running at 30 frames per second, and it chugs, and there's like long ass load screens.

09:23.000 --> 09:31.000
It's like, dude, what the hell, I mean, you could have done this shit on Xbox 360 and had the same kind of results.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
I mean, why are there games out now that have higher frame rates, look better, and you can't pull this shit off on the next gen?

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
Well, because, and to tie it into what Jason was just talking about, it's learning the tricks,

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
and I think there's still a lot of tricks that the developers are going to have to learn with these consoles,

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
and we'll see it in about, you know, a year, where these games start to look better and better.

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
Like, you even see it with the current gen stuff, like a game like, what's like a really good looking game that came out in the past year?

09:58.000 --> 10:05.000
Something like Tomb Raider, let's say, looks frickin' phenomenal, and you put that side by side with Cameo.

10:05.000 --> 10:15.000
You know, Cameo didn't really, I mean, sure it was HD, but it was kind of a glorified PS2 game.

10:15.000 --> 10:21.000
Well, there was a lot of games that came out even at the launch of the Xbox 360 that, you know, definitely looked like Xbox games and stuff,

10:21.000 --> 10:30.000
but I am still bugged at the fact that, you know, and this I guess is even the same situation with, you know, the Xbox 360 when it launched,

10:30.000 --> 10:37.000
that they want people to spend money on these systems and they haven't really shown what's different about these systems.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
Okay, cool, so the Xbox One can display more zombies on screen, but the game still runs like shit.

10:42.000 --> 10:51.000
I mean, you know, why don't you, I don't know, instead of pumping out a thousand zombies on the screen, maybe do 500, and then the frame rate's better.

10:51.000 --> 10:59.000
You know, yes, I understand that you can run all these, but obviously at some sort of expense because, you know, you're not running at 60 frames per second.

10:59.000 --> 11:07.000
You know, the graphics aren't 1080p, so maybe it's just not really worth it. It's almost like a gimmick, like this is the bullet point.

11:07.000 --> 11:13.000
Yeah, it's the most zombies ever, but, you know, it's just not very good. That's the thing.

11:13.000 --> 11:23.000
I don't know. I mean, I never had a problem with there being too few zombies in Dead Rising games, to be honest, so I don't really know why it's an issue.

11:23.000 --> 11:32.000
Are you being a little harsh? Because DKB in the chatroom says, runs like shit, really? And even I have to go, isn't that a little harsh?

11:32.000 --> 11:46.000
It's 30 frames per second. 30 frames per second. Once again, I have an expectation. If they want me to spend $500 on a new console, then I better see a fucking difference between this gen and next gen.

11:46.000 --> 11:57.000
Like, I wanna see, they have to wow me, they have to sell it to me. And honestly, they're showing me a game that looks like Dead Rising 2, but oh, the map's slightly bigger this time, and oh, there's some more zombies.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
I don't fucking care, I'm not buying that system.

11:59.000 --> 12:09.000
To be fair, and to be devil's advocate a little bit here, didn't we kinda know that going into this round of consoles, that they weren't gonna be pushing the graphical envelope and all this as much?

12:09.000 --> 12:17.000
Because there's not a lot more you can do with the current TVs, and Intel 4K TVs are the standard, which we don't even know if that will be.

12:17.000 --> 12:33.000
You know, there's not a lot else to do visually. When we were talking PlayStation 2 to PlayStation 3, the entire world was in the process, well, at least this country, and probably most of the rest of the world, was transitioning between SDTV and HDTV. I mean, that was a huge jump.

12:33.000 --> 12:47.000
Okay, I understand that, but we've had a whole generation of games that have been running at 720p and now with hardware that's definitely a lot better than this current generation systems, and they can't fucking pull out 1080p native?

12:47.000 --> 13:10.000
I mean, and a decent frame rate? I mean, shit, Rise runs at 30 frames per second, if you're lucky, it's locked in there, or it even did dumbass shit with Need for Speed Rivals, where even on PC it's fucking locked at 30 frames per second, you try to unlock it and the game goes crazy because it's just the way they did their physics or something in the game, it's just all messed up.

13:11.000 --> 13:24.000
That's my problem, though, is that they are, once again, there's no, and I think this is gonna be a problem with these consoles, there's no hook, there's no hook to get me in there, whereas like, you know, with the Wii, it took off because it was like a new way to play games.

13:24.000 --> 13:38.000
You know, Microsoft's trying to sell it, hey, Kinect is important, but it doesn't really do a whole ton. Once again, it's like these fucking promises that they made when Kinect originally came out, and we're seeing the same shit not quite work right again.

13:39.000 --> 13:54.000
And it's like, well, we're gonna patch it, it's gonna get better. No, it didn't fucking get better with the original Kinect, and same with smart glass stuff, I haven't seen how they've really implemented these second screen things other than, ooh, you can call it an airstrike by hitting a button on your tablet or something.

13:55.000 --> 14:07.000
Why does that need to be on a tablet? Why do we need a separate app to do that on a tablet when you can hit start, pull up a pause menu or some shit like that, and do it on that? I don't understand why they have to overcomplicate everything.

14:07.000 --> 14:15.000
Okay, I'm trying to figure out where your head's at right now with these new consoles, because you're coming off to me right now like more negative than I kind of thought you were at.

14:15.000 --> 14:30.000
Like, I kind of thought you were in a similar place that I was at where, okay, you might not be on board with Xbox One and PlayStation 4 right now because the games aren't really there to substantiate the several hundred dollars purchase, but I kind of thought you'd be jumping on board a year or two from now. Am I wrong?

14:31.000 --> 14:42.000
I mean, maybe if there's some better games coming out that actually show off the hardware, but right now there's not really anything coming out that's going to be like that.

14:42.000 --> 14:51.000
I mean, it just all seems like promises right now, that we're getting a lot of promised things, and that's it. It's just promises.

14:51.000 --> 15:01.000
I mean, even like, look at these launches. It's pathetic, the amount of features that are in there that are going to be patched in later on. It just screams rushed. The whole thing screams rushed.

15:01.000 --> 15:13.000
It really, these consoles should have come out six months from now, and not now. I don't know why bother rushing everything. I guess because they have to react to the other, you know...

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Well, the holidays too.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
So what? It doesn't matter. The holidays don't matter. If the console comes out...

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Well, hold on now. Hold on now.

15:21.000 --> 15:35.000
No, the holidays don't matter as far as selling these consoles. You'll sell a million consoles regardless of the... Are these people really saving them for the holidays? I mean, maybe a small percentage of them, but put it out six months from now and people would still be buying them.

15:35.000 --> 15:47.000
Oh, fiscal year performance is important too, and you and I both know you're going to sell more consoles, way more consoles between October and December than you're going to sell between January and March, which is the end of the fiscal year. So...

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
I mean, in that sense it's logical, right?

15:51.000 --> 16:07.000
Well, for their investors, I guess they have to do whatever they can to please them and spin whatever they can PR-wise. But I'm just saying, for me, it's... Unless I get one for free, in which case I'm not turning down free.

16:07.000 --> 16:25.000
You know, I'm not picking one up anytime soon because there's no games on there that I'm really interested in, and so far everything they've shown, they haven't really changed anything. It's all the same shit that they're pulling right now on the current gen consoles, and to be honest, there's more games coming out in current gen anyways.

16:25.000 --> 16:46.000
I want to see some significant differences between Assassin's Creed IV on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3, or hell, even when Titanfall comes out, I kind of want to see what they're going to do as far as the Xbox 360 version. Let's see how different that is compared to the Xbox One version.

16:46.000 --> 16:58.000
I just... I need to see what these vast differences are in order for me to justify me purchasing, because, to be honest, might as well just dump that $500 into a PC, because at least those games are going to be running at a higher resolution than 720p.

16:58.000 --> 17:08.000
Alright, I don't know. I think you might be being a little too harsh, but I also understand the frustrations. I get it.

17:08.000 --> 17:22.000
Alright, live.vognetware.com. It is the show where every gamer has a voice. Bobby Blackwolf, wanting to challenge you on one of these points here, saying they rush it because gamers don't want to wait. How much did you complain when Grand Theft Auto 5 was delayed?

17:22.000 --> 17:34.000
It was worth it. It was worth it. And let me be honest, let me be honest with Grand Theft Auto 5. Grand Theft Auto 5 has a lot more content than some of these other fucking next-gen games coming out.

17:34.000 --> 17:44.000
I would be a horrible, irresponsible person if I did not ask this question. Could you be sitting here, a year from now, going, it was worth it for Xbox One?

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
When that Grand Theft Auto 6 or whatever happens.

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
I can't predict the future, and it's going to be Grand Theft Auto 5 again on next-gen is what it's going to be.

17:53.000 --> 18:07.000
No, I can't predict the future. I mean, I would like for them, I'd like to be wrong on these consoles. I mean, honestly I would, but as we're going to get into later on, there's some things that we've complained about, like,

18:07.000 --> 18:14.000
Dude, it's a fucking $60 game and you're treating it like a free-to-play game, and shit's not going away. It's only getting worse.

18:14.000 --> 18:25.000
And so why should I buy into these brand new consoles if they're just going to turn them into some sort of sieve for me to basically take more money from me?

18:26.000 --> 18:39.000
They need to have something to really sell me on it. Like, Kinect 2.0 is supposed to be so integral to the Xbox experience, and aside from voice commands and shit, I don't really fucking care about voice commands, okay?

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Yeah, that's cool and all, but...

18:41.000 --> 18:49.000
I hear, I mean, I don't know. Again, there's a lot of mixed opinions out there, but I'm hearing that people really are enjoying the interface once they finally get down in there and use it.

18:49.000 --> 18:54.000
That the whole, like, you know, screen and screen stuff and all that kind of works pretty good.

18:55.000 --> 19:14.000
I still don't, for me, the screen and screen stuff, once again, you're telling me that it's important for me to have, like, a tablet so I can do the second screen stuff, so why do I need a little tiny sliver of my screen when I can do the same shit on my tablet that's right in front of me because you're having me, you know, use this tablet to play the games as well.

19:15.000 --> 19:27.000
Alright, alright. Bobby making another good point, so I just want to get this out there. Bobby says the Xbox One had to come out now because there are investors wanting to close the Xbox division, so it had to come out to try to make some money so they didn't get shut down.

19:27.000 --> 19:37.000
You have your fans too, Loki. MM2K says Loki is absolutely right. Right now, plug money into a PC. Best games are multi-platform anyway and will be on Steam.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Except for Grand Theft Auto 5.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Eventually, eventually.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
It is coming. They already have PC documentation inside.

19:45.000 --> 19:59.000
Alright, we got into a kickoff topic anyway. I originally wanted to talk about the Xbox One's launch. I wanted to talk about those sales figures. I don't know, Loki, do you want to kind of go over the sales figures because, as Bobby said, they're trying to make some money. Sounds like they did after all, right, Loki?

20:00.000 --> 20:09.000
Yeah, they did pretty well. They sold, you know, both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One sold a million units, or they say they're phrasing it as over a million units.

20:09.000 --> 20:16.000
So, of course, I'm trying not to sound biased here, but I really fucking hate PR speak.

20:16.000 --> 20:24.000
And I got back, you know, I got down on Activision about Call of Duty and their one million units shipped, you know, bullshit and stuff.

20:24.000 --> 20:32.000
Yes, they sold a million units worldwide versus one million units North America for the PlayStation 4.

20:32.000 --> 20:40.000
But, hey, you know what? No one's knocking a million units. A million units of a console, you know, within 24 hours is fantastic.

20:40.000 --> 20:49.000
Sorry, I have to say this. I'm sorry, Loki, it's kind of interrupting, but Tech2030 in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, fuck this, let's just not buy any of them and only play Cookie Clicker.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
And 66% of the room is.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
I'm multitasking.

20:58.000 --> 21:05.000
Hey, and I have my phone off, Jason, because mine will produce cookies while it's not on. All right, anyway, all joking aside.

21:05.000 --> 21:13.000
So, one million on both consoles, but, okay, I have to go there and I'm not trying to knock Xbox because I'm going to be real with you guys.

21:13.000 --> 21:20.000
Based on all that internet stuff and all the rabble rabble angry mobs we saw six months ago, I wasn't expecting Xbox One to do that well.

21:20.000 --> 21:30.000
So, yay for them. I think competition is healthy across the board. However, it is worth pointing out, Xbox One might have sold a million, but they did it in, what, 13 countries?

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Whereas PlayStation 4 was only US and Canada, right?

21:32.000 --> 21:39.000
I still think it's very skewed as far as, you know, it's good for day one. Don't get me wrong, it's good for day one.

21:39.000 --> 21:49.000
But if you're going to play the console wars here, you have to understand that we're talking, you know, a couple countries versus basically all their launch territories at once.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
But it's not like doom and gloom for Xbox. Far from it.

21:52.000 --> 22:02.000
Not at all. But at the end of the day, once they do finally launch in all their countries or whatever, I think you're going to see a significant number of more PlayStation 4s than you are in the Xbox One.

22:02.000 --> 22:07.000
Because I don't think they still recovered completely from, you know, all the bullshit.

22:07.000 --> 22:13.000
I think it's just the price. I think at the end of the day, for a lot of people, I mean, not the ones listening to this podcast or participating.

22:13.000 --> 22:19.000
I think the folks, you know, active gamers participating in this kind of thing have a lot more issues to juggle.

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
But I think for a lot of people, for a lot of parents sitting there going, what do I buy for my teenage son or daughter?

22:24.000 --> 22:29.000
Oh, this one's cheaper, I'm going to get that. I think for a lot of people that's what it's going to come down to.

22:29.000 --> 22:36.000
If there's not already one of the previous gen consoles in the house, or if they have both, then they'll start with the cheaper one.

22:36.000 --> 22:43.000
Plus, it's a little different now than when we were growing up and our parents, most of our parents didn't know anything about video games.

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
Now, the parents, a lot of them did play video games. A lot of people listening to this show are parents.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
So it is, you know, it is a little different. I might not be being fair either.

22:52.000 --> 22:58.000
But it's certainly applicable in the broader sense. There's still massive legions of people that, parents that aren't into gaming,

22:59.000 --> 23:06.000
and they do add up to that majority of the people that would have gotten the console for their child, teen, anything along those lines.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
And when it comes to the parents, I don't think you can totally count out Wii U either.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
No, not at all. I mean, they have some good games on there.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
I mean, if you like Nintendo games, they're good. Wii U is going to be great.

23:17.000 --> 23:24.000
If you're looking for other games from other companies, you may be having some issues.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
We'll come back to this later.

23:26.000 --> 23:31.000
But I'm just saying, as far as Nintendo games go, yeah, it's fantastic.

23:31.000 --> 23:36.000
Because a lot of people look forward to Nintendo games on those consoles.

23:36.000 --> 23:43.000
But it's just... I don't know. They're kind of in their own thing.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
They don't even want to compete in this next gen.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
And that's why I always kind of laugh when they show, okay, the next generation is starting.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
They show the Wii U. I'm like, ha ha ha. Yeah, okay, whatever.

23:51.000 --> 23:57.000
But it's just... I don't know. It'll be interesting to see what happens with all these consoles and stuff.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
But it's just... it's a rocky start, I think.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
Doomplague in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

24:04.000 --> 24:09.000
Wii U currently has better games than either new console, just probably not for long.

24:09.000 --> 24:14.000
I think that's a very good, yes, I agree with you point.

24:14.000 --> 24:19.000
Because I would agree. I think Wii U right now has better games than either one of those consoles.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
But are we going to be able to say the same a year from now? I don't know.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
Because you're going to get some heavy, heavy hitters next year.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
I imagine, you know, we already know there's going to be Destiny, Titanfall.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
I imagine Microsoft's going to push out their new Halo for next holiday.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Or at least, you know, you're going to see a lot on that.

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
Sony, I don't know what their... they'll probably have a new LittleBigPlanet or something.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
They've got plenty of stuff they can rely on.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
All of those games that they had to delay into first or second quarter.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Well, they have an Uncharted 4.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Right.

24:48.000 --> 24:55.000
And then so Nintendo's challenge is going to really be how are they going to stay afloat without all the third party support.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
But they will throw out a new Zelda on Wii U next year.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
I think we're all anticipating that.

25:01.000 --> 25:08.000
If they don't, honestly, if they don't do a Zelda on Wii U next year, there's going to be a lot of people that are disappointed.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
That's the reality of where we're at right now.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
And Smash Brothers.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
Nintendo has a big 2014 for its namesake titles.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
As does the roll out of the Xbox One and PS4.

25:19.000 --> 25:25.000
Even Smash Bros though, I was kind of excited about it for the Wii and stuff, but the new one just doesn't really...

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
It's kind of like, hey, look, it's the same characters we had last time.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
Don't knock it till you see it a little more in motion.

25:31.000 --> 25:37.000
I don't think we've really seen... I mean, yes, we've had some teasers, but you haven't seen the game really in motion.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Getting your hands on it and all that.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
And I think there's a lot to come with that.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
I think back to the Wii one when it was in development, you know?

25:44.000 --> 25:49.000
There was a big difference between the early, early stages and hearing about the characters and then really getting to play that thing.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
Those Smash Bros games have a lot of depth to them.

25:53.000 --> 25:58.000
And there's so much in regards to the unlockables, collectables, and all that stuff.

25:58.000 --> 26:04.000
I really hope they don't rush this Wii U one, but it's been in development a hell of a long time.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
So I would think we're going to be ready in 2014, but we'll see.

26:07.000 --> 26:13.000
Alright, anyhow, I think that's enough of our kickoff topic of Xbox One and everything else going on.

26:13.000 --> 26:19.000
Let's talk a little more specifically about what you yourself have been doing in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week?

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
I would usually let ladies go first, but we don't have any tonight.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
But Jason, since you are sitting in Jamie's chair, go for it. How was your gaming week?

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
I have been playing a lot of real life the game.

26:28.000 --> 26:34.000
It's an epic training simulator and workout simulator and driving simulator and walking simulator.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
You even sound like Jamie with that gaming week.

26:37.000 --> 26:46.000
It's been a really light couple of weeks because I, as I'm sure many people remember, I was here a couple episodes ago.

26:46.000 --> 26:51.000
I've been to Arizona and back in that time I was training a new coworker this week.

26:51.000 --> 27:00.000
Incredibly busy times. I'm basically just grinding a little bit more, by which I mean getting completely obliterated on FTL.

27:00.000 --> 27:09.000
And then a couple new upgrades in Rogue Legacy and just trying to progress that game further so I can actually get into the third and fourth regions a little bit more consistently.

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
And Rogue Legacy now has the Steam trading cards, which is even more incentive to play that crap.

27:13.000 --> 27:18.000
I got some time ago, I'm sure.

27:18.000 --> 27:23.000
They didn't just come out last week, but I noticed within the past month or so, since the last time you were on it.

27:24.000 --> 27:35.000
Just casual grinding of games with a very defined start and end and are also very friendly to just stop what I'm doing wherever I am with no penalty to speak of.

27:35.000 --> 27:41.000
Yeah, that's honestly really about all I've had time for this past week.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Fair enough. At least you dabbled in a couple things.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?

27:45.000 --> 27:53.000
It was pretty pathetic. I haven't really played anything this week other than Call of Duty, actually. I played a little bit of that at work.

27:53.000 --> 28:02.000
I didn't even play any Grand Theft Auto this week. I meant to play some other things with it. I started Dexter, so I've been watching TV.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
More TV than games right now.

28:04.000 --> 28:11.000
I was just trying to take a break from Grand Theft Auto for a little bit. I'm going to go back into it, obviously, really soon.

28:12.000 --> 28:22.000
I'm trying to start. Once again, I know the new Steam sale is coming up soon, and I'm like, man, there's a lot of games I haven't played yet that I've bought.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
Winter is coming. Brace yourselves for the Steam sale.

28:25.000 --> 28:31.000
I'm like, oh, shit, man, there's a lot of games I haven't played. Even with the Humble Bundles, they had some Warner games won.

28:31.000 --> 28:37.000
I'm just like, maybe I should buy that, even though they have no interest in the Batman games.

28:37.000 --> 28:42.000
Speaking of Humble Bundle, did you see the pinball collection that's on the Humble Bundle?

28:42.000 --> 28:49.000
Which one is it? Zen Pinball. It's not the actual Humble Bundle, it's the weekly sale.

28:49.000 --> 28:58.000
Oh, sorry, yeah, yeah. You can get all that. I picked that up, I haven't played it yet, but I was very excited to see that in there.

28:58.000 --> 29:04.000
I don't recall all the details, but I stumbled across something the other day. It was basically a make-your-own Humble Bundle.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Well, they launched the store now.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
There's a lot of different websites that have that kind of stuff.

29:08.000 --> 29:16.000
Yeah, I've seen the improvements that Humble Bundle has been rolling out in that regard, but I thought it was something unique. Damn.

29:16.000 --> 29:24.000
No, I came across it, I was like, I don't have time, and I don't have money, buy in, so I didn't take in enough of the details.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
Sorry, Loki.

29:25.000 --> 29:32.000
No, there's a bunch of different Humble Bundle-esque sites that, you know, there's one of them that does that, I don't know.

29:32.000 --> 29:40.000
But yeah, so that's pretty much that, and I've just been messing around with Clicker today, just because, I don't know, I'm just bored.

29:40.000 --> 29:48.000
I can't start Fallout right now, because it's in the middle of the show, and this doesn't take any intelligence at all, other than clicking a mouse.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
So yeah, that's pretty much where I've been.

29:52.000 --> 29:57.000
Alright, well, I've been very busy with a couple new games. I've been playing the usual stuff as well,

29:58.000 --> 30:03.000
helping Alan and stuff. But this Friday, obviously, was the release of the Xbox One.

30:03.000 --> 30:08.000
I feel the same way about the One that I do about the PlayStation 4. The games aren't there for me right now.

30:08.000 --> 30:17.000
Next year, I'm probably going to have to pick up both, because you're going to have things like Final Fantasy XIV and Destiny on PlayStation 4, things that I definitely want over there.

30:17.000 --> 30:22.000
And then on Xbox One, I'm sure they'll announce Forza Horizon 2, which will be enough for me to get an Xbox One.

30:22.000 --> 30:32.000
So I'll get those in 2014, but for now, being a Wii U owner, I was very excited about the release of Super Mario 3D World on the Nintendo Wii.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Wii U.

30:34.000 --> 30:42.000
Thank you, yes, Wii U. And I will tell you this, the game delivers. It's outstanding. I love it.

30:42.000 --> 30:51.000
It's what you would kind of expect. I don't think it really, to me it feels a lot different than 3D Land on the 3DS did,

30:51.000 --> 30:58.000
because obviously, for one, it's not really in 3D, but for two, I think just the larger screen, the more diverse characters,

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
I feel like there's kind of more going on in each stage because of it.

31:02.000 --> 31:10.000
I'm going to tell you the thing I like most about Mario 3D World is the attention to detail, and it's the little things that really make that game.

31:10.000 --> 31:18.000
The things from you get really close to a Goomba, and the Goomba spots you and makes angry Goomba face and starts charging at you.

31:18.000 --> 31:25.000
Or when you step on a turtle, and there's that literal moment you can actually see the little Koopa of the whole, like, where'd my pants go?

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
type of thing, and running over to try to get the shell as fast as they can.

31:29.000 --> 31:35.000
To the little sound when you walk on a glass, you hear the clink, clink, clink, clink when you're actually walking on glass pipes.

31:35.000 --> 31:42.000
To when you're underwater, the background music actually changes completely to when you come back above the water, it goes back to where it was at.

31:42.000 --> 31:49.000
To when you're kitty Mario, which really is the best thing ever, that was a great power-up, love it.

31:49.000 --> 31:54.000
When you're climbing up a wall, and you go as far as you can, because you can't just climb the wall infinitely,

31:54.000 --> 32:00.000
finally you get to a certain point where you can't climb anymore, and they just claw onto the wall and they start slipping,

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
and they leave little claw marks behind as they're falling and look really sad.

32:04.000 --> 32:11.000
It's those little details that really do it for me, and yeah, the level design obviously is great.

32:11.000 --> 32:18.000
There's things to collect in every level, so just because you beat it once doesn't mean you're going to collect all three green stars and the stamp and everything.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
The social elements are very interesting.

32:21.000 --> 32:31.000
I know we give Nintendo a hard time about not understanding online, but the way they've integrated Miiverse into this and the ghost Miis and everything is interesting.

32:31.000 --> 32:37.000
I think in some ways it's kind of give or take, but just to kind of give you an example,

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
while you're walking around the world map, you'll see these random Miis on the map,

32:41.000 --> 32:46.000
and if you walk up to them, they'll have a little picture of something they wrote on Miiverse about that world.

32:46.000 --> 32:57.000
When you beat a stage, you'll actually see scrolling across the top of the screen, Miiverse posts from people who also played that stage and posted something about it on Miiverse.

32:57.000 --> 33:04.000
I'll give you an example of how this can work. I was playing a level in World 3 not long ago.

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
It's a water level, and we all love water levels, but they're a necessary part of any Mario game, right?

33:08.000 --> 33:13.000
I couldn't find two of the stars in the level. I could find the last one, but I couldn't find the first two.

33:13.000 --> 33:18.000
So when I beat the level, it shows me all the Miiverse posts, and one of the first ones that comes up is,

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
Where are the first and second stars?

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
I'm like, thank god it's not just me. That was literally my reaction, right?

33:25.000 --> 33:32.000
So that was kind of, I don't know, that was a neat reaction I can't think of that I get in any other game right now.

33:32.000 --> 33:37.000
And I'm not saying it's like a huge deal or a game changer, or OMG Nintendo is pushing the envelope,

33:37.000 --> 33:44.000
but I will say that was a unique reaction, that immediate instant feedback that I can't say I get anywhere else right now.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
That instant attachment to another individual somewhere out there in the universe.

33:47.000 --> 33:53.000
Yes, like the whole, like, me too, me too, stranger danger 10357 or whatever your name is, right?

33:53.000 --> 33:59.000
You know, there was that instance where I did kind of feel like, oh okay, so I'm not the only crazy one.

33:59.000 --> 34:03.000
Yeah, it's a very interesting, it's a very interesting case to think about the fact that,

34:03.000 --> 34:13.000
yeah, Nintendo is not necessarily getting the always-on, multi-world, MMO, universe-style network services,

34:13.000 --> 34:19.000
but they're pushing a really damn good community, and as long as they keep up the moderator action,

34:19.000 --> 34:25.000
It's moderated, it's a moderated community, and that works and it doesn't work,

34:25.000 --> 34:30.000
because again, you know, we criticized Nintendo last week about the whole swap note thing,

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
which I think was completely valid, I think it was ridiculous the way they threw the baby out with the bathwater with that,

34:34.000 --> 34:40.000
but, I mean, there's a difference between these type of public communications you have in a game like Mario,

34:40.000 --> 34:45.000
you know, Super Mario 3D World, and the private communications where essentially if, you know,

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
me and a friend are both over the age of 18, we should be able to send whatever we want,

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
because we could do it on an email anyway, you know, so.

34:52.000 --> 34:59.000
These emotions and expressions that they're capturing in the public eye is quite unique and very worthy, very fun to see.

34:59.000 --> 35:03.000
Level design, again, have I mentioned how great the level design is in the game?

35:03.000 --> 35:09.000
Because I will tell you what, also in World 3, there's a level, and this might be a minor spoiler,

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
so mute for about 60 seconds if you don't want to hear it, I don't think it's a big deal,

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
some people are nutso about spoilers, so mute it if you don't want to hear it,

35:15.000 --> 35:22.000
there's a level in the third world that invokes Mario Kart, like right on down to the level actually looks like a Mario circuit track,

35:22.000 --> 35:26.000
and you're running over these little dash squares, that was so much fun to play,

35:26.000 --> 35:32.000
and I didn't even play it in multiplayer, which, can you imagine, I've only played this game in single player,

35:32.000 --> 35:38.000
but the whole thing is designed for four people to play, and I can only imagine what a riot some of these games are in multiplayer,

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
and some of these levels and so forth.

35:40.000 --> 35:45.000
One of the things that I hear about the game is that whoever does the best in a level,

35:45.000 --> 35:51.000
wears a little crown in the next level, so you know people are going to be trying to steal that crown,

35:51.000 --> 35:58.000
and pick on the player who has the crown, and I'm sure it makes for amazing multiplayer experiences,

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
but I have yet to do those, so.

36:00.000 --> 36:06.000
Anyway, Mario 3D World, if you are a Wii U owner, I don't know why you don't have this game yet,

36:06.000 --> 36:12.000
you need to make it a priority to get your hands on this game, because it is the best Wii U game available now.

36:12.000 --> 36:18.000
I already thought the one they released last year was pretty good, but this one blows it out of the water, it really does.

36:18.000 --> 36:23.000
This is great. So Mario 3D World is a must have if you're a Wii U owner.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Is it a system seller?

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
If you like Nintendo systems, yeah.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
It's getting there. It's definitely getting there.

36:31.000 --> 36:37.000
It's yet another game now where it's like, alright, now Wii U is starting to really build up that library.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
If I drop the money on a Wii U, now I have two solid Mario games.

36:41.000 --> 36:46.000
Zombie U, Nintendo Land, you know, maybe Wonderful 101 if you're into that, or Pikmin.

36:46.000 --> 36:53.000
You know, it is strengthening Nintendo's library, but is it going to be a system seller?

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
It really depends on what type of games you're into.

36:55.000 --> 37:02.000
It's a real bummer Mario Kart 8 didn't make it this year, because I think, and I'm all for take the time to get it right,

37:02.000 --> 37:09.000
and also that's part of how they're going to make 2014 not feel like the desert that 2013 was.

37:09.000 --> 37:16.000
But I think if Mario Kart 8 had come out and it was solid and they were able to deliver that 1-2 punch on the Wii U,

37:16.000 --> 37:22.000
I would be like, you gotta buy a Wii U, because there's all these games now.

37:22.000 --> 37:27.000
But with only the one huge, great game, it's a little harder to say.

37:27.000 --> 37:32.000
Because I think you really have to say, like, how much do I want to play Mario 3D World?

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
But I'm telling you, it's really good.

37:34.000 --> 37:42.000
So, the other Nintendo game I happened to pick up this week, I actually went and bought a 3DS XL,

37:42.000 --> 37:50.000
because I'm that big of a whore for 2D Zelda, and I love Link to the Past, so of course I was all over Link Between Worlds.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
And yes, I've seen the stories about how it's really 3D and all this stuff.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
You know what I mean, it still plays like Link to the Past and all that.

37:56.000 --> 38:02.000
So I bought a new Zelda 3DS XL, which has the Triforce, the high rule and low rule Triforces on it,

38:02.000 --> 38:09.000
and I've been playing the game, and I, again, it's outstanding.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
It's an outstanding game.

38:11.000 --> 38:19.000
It's, like, for somebody who loves Link to the Past as much as I do, I was so giddy the way they've pulled it off.

38:20.000 --> 38:26.000
Here's the thing, it's not a remake, but it invokes so much of the old series.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
It's like going back and visiting an old friend.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
Hi, how you doing? And here's what's changed.

38:31.000 --> 38:36.000
And it's not that, again, it's not telling the same story, but it's using a really similar map,

38:36.000 --> 38:42.000
and it's telling an all new story, and it feels like you're discovering all these places over again,

38:42.000 --> 38:47.000
because obviously the graphic upgrades from a Super Nintendo to a 3DS are huge,

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
and the music's great, and so on and so on.

38:50.000 --> 38:55.000
I also have to hand it to the team that created this.

38:55.000 --> 39:03.000
The 3D effects are great, and considering a lot of us thought Nintendo was abandoning 3D when they released the 2DS,

39:03.000 --> 39:09.000
it was quite pleasing to see a 3D game that really benefits from having the 3D switch on,

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
if you are into viewing the 3D and everything.

39:12.000 --> 39:17.000
Like just from the little creatures jumping, the little... what were their names?

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
The Octoroks shoot the rocks, right? What are the little jumping spider things called?

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Tektites, were those Tektites? I don't know.

39:22.000 --> 39:26.000
Those guys that jump up and you actually kind of see that in 3D is great.

39:26.000 --> 39:31.000
When you jump off a cliff, you see that little 3D kind of enhancement.

39:31.000 --> 39:37.000
You definitely see it in dungeons when you're on a level, but there's an upstairs and a downstairs within the same level.

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
You definitely get a sense of that 3D effect, and it's done tastefully.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
Yeah, it's great.

39:43.000 --> 39:49.000
And I've heard a lot of talk about how, well, it's really weird that you can kind of rent everything from the shop in the beginning.

39:49.000 --> 39:53.000
It's just a different way of doing it. It didn't really change things for me.

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
There's still definitely points and things that you get in the dungeons,

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
and there will be ways that you will want to play things in a certain order.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
I wasn't really bothered by the rental system at all.

40:03.000 --> 40:09.000
You know what? It also helps differentiate it from Link to the Past and make it its own game,

40:09.000 --> 40:14.000
which is one of the better Zelda games that will be out there in the franchise, for sure.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
Rama says,

40:16.000 --> 40:20.000
Zelda A Link Between Worlds is essentially a Link to the Past second quest.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Don't agree with you.

40:22.000 --> 40:31.000
I think they've changed enough where, especially once you get that ability where you can actually kind of glue yourself to walls and walk around and all that,

40:31.000 --> 40:37.000
it really changes a lot of the puzzles and so forth, and just such the graphical upgrade and everything.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
I don't know if I would call it a second quest.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
I don't know. It's like I said earlier. It's like revisiting an old friend.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Are there elements of Link to the Past? Absolutely.

40:46.000 --> 40:51.000
But it is definitely its own game, and it is worth the price that they're asking for it.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
The $40 or whatever. I don't know, because I bought the bundle.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
But I think it's what? $40 retail, Loki?

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Yeah.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
It's worth it.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
There it goes.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
Let's see. I'm trying to look at our chat room. Sorry, I was talking so much.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
I have been falling behind on our chat room.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
He was fanboying.

41:07.000 --> 41:13.000
Yeah, a little bit. A little bit. Which, you know, it's funny, because I've been accused of the whole Nintendo fanboy thing, which, whatever.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
You know, I'm gonna like what I like.

41:15.000 --> 41:19.000
But I'd like to think I'm also critical of Nintendo when they need it too.

41:19.000 --> 41:28.000
So, and, you know, the whole online thing last week, and the fact that, you know, yes, Super Mario World, Super Mario 3D World is great,

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
but is it gonna be enough to really push the Wii U's this year?

41:32.000 --> 41:37.000
I don't know. I don't know. I think Nintendo really needed that one other game, but we'll see. We'll see.

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
I'm rooting for them though, but I'm rooting for Microsoft and Sony as well.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Is that so wrong?

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
Aren't I allowed to like all the games?

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Is that, is something wrong with me?

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Everything. So says the internet.

41:52.000 --> 41:57.000
Yes, I'll complain about things that need complaining about, but I'm gonna cheer on the things that need cheering of.

41:57.000 --> 42:04.000
And these Mario and Zelda games are accomplishments that are worthy of the cheering. Absolutely.

42:05.000 --> 42:10.000
Alright, let's see. Live.vognetwork.com. Tigerclaw says,

42:10.000 --> 42:15.000
Zelda becomes shorter if you have the guide for it. Try playing without one. You'll spend hours trying to figure stuff out.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Well, I mean, couldn't that be said about any game?

42:17.000 --> 42:21.000
I mean, if you use the guide, you're gonna have all the puzzles answered for you.

42:22.000 --> 42:28.000
Zelda does have an interesting system in it where you can use the play coins that you get from walking around on the 3DS.

42:28.000 --> 42:35.000
You can use those to buy hints from a ghost. Like, you get these little glasses in the beginning, hint glasses, and you can use them to buy hints.

42:35.000 --> 42:39.000
So, up to you if you want to use them or not. I think that's interesting.

42:39.000 --> 42:43.000
Some people will probably get really turned off by that, but then I just say, don't equip them.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
And then they won't be there.

42:45.000 --> 42:52.000
Let's see. Also looking for some more chats at live.vognetwork.com.

42:52.000 --> 42:58.000
ActDeaf says, I'm forgetting Zelda Wind Waker HD, Rayman Legends, and some other games.

42:58.000 --> 43:03.000
You're right. I probably am forgetting those games, but let's also not kid ourselves.

43:03.000 --> 43:08.000
Both those games you mentioned are available on other consoles, especially in the case of Rayman Legends.

43:09.000 --> 43:16.000
I know the game was developed for Wii U, and it's probably best on Wii U, but the reality is it's not exclusive to Wii U anymore.

43:16.000 --> 43:22.000
Zelda Wind Waker HD, I haven't played that yet. I'm very much looking forward to it.

43:22.000 --> 43:34.000
But even if the game is outstanding, which I'm sure it's great, it's really hard to call a reimagining of a GameCube game something that's gonna really sell a lot of consoles.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
Although maybe it did for some people. I don't know. Maybe I'm being too hard on it.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
It was the earlier Zelda release on the Wii U.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
Yeah, you did.

43:42.000 --> 43:48.000
Taste tester before... or it's the only Wii U release. What am I saying? Link Between Worlds is 3DS.

43:48.000 --> 43:53.000
Right, right. It was also extremely quickly put together. And I'm not saying that in a bad way.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
From what I understand, everybody that I know that's played it really loves it.

43:56.000 --> 44:01.000
But they essentially threw it together, and I'm not sure how to take that.

44:01.000 --> 44:07.000
I mean, I guess that's a good thing that you can put out a quality product so fast, but they did have to reimagine an old game to do it.

44:07.000 --> 44:13.000
But you're right. I shouldn't totally count out when Waker HD is something that is available.

44:13.000 --> 44:19.000
There are gonna be... you know, the game is ten years old. There are gonna be a lot of people out there, especially in their teens, that probably never touched the first game.

44:19.000 --> 44:26.000
Anyway. Alright. I've gushed enough about New Mario and New Zelda, but I'm telling you, they're great.

44:26.000 --> 44:34.000
And honestly, is there an Xbox One or PlayStation 4 launch game as good as Mario 3D World?

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
No.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
I highly, highly doubt it.

44:39.000 --> 44:44.000
Now, a year from now, will we be able to say the same thing? Probably not.

44:44.000 --> 44:48.000
You know, Wii U also came out a year ago. They had a year to make this game, or more.

44:48.000 --> 44:56.000
So I'm sure a year from now it'll be a different story, but I'm telling you, this really makes this whole next-gen console war...

44:56.000 --> 45:05.000
I'm using my little quotey fingers... console war that much more interesting when I would argue the best game that came out for the holiday season

45:05.000 --> 45:12.000
is on the Wii U. Although, to be fair, there's still a lot of games that came out earlier that are also really good, like I know...

45:12.000 --> 45:17.000
I like to consider the holiday season starting on September 17th, but you know, that's just me.

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
Yeah, I have to mention, of course, Grand Theft Auto 5...

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Which you haven't played yet.

45:23.000 --> 45:28.000
But I recognize that a lot of people are gonna call that the game of the year, and that's...

45:28.000 --> 45:38.000
I don't think it's in the show world tonight, but those Spike TV award things that they announce a lot of games at, which I think are irrelevant, but a lot of people seem to care...

45:38.000 --> 45:42.000
They did announce their game of the year picks, right? And I know both those games we just made.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Mario 3D World's in there, and Grand Theft Auto's in there.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Yeah, Last of Us, and some other stuff.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.000
Which, again... Oh, Bioshock Infinite, all the way back in February.

45:50.000 --> 45:57.000
So, is Mario 3D World a better game than that? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
It's a popularity contest.

45:58.000 --> 46:07.000
It is a little bit. And then I saw Tomb Raider in there too, which was a pleasant surprise. I think Tomb Raider's great, and a good kick in the butt for the franchise, so I was happy to see that in there.

46:07.000 --> 46:12.000
Did anybody else remember what else was in there? Maybe our chatters do. Live.vognetwork.com.

46:12.000 --> 46:16.000
They're supposed to have a trailer for Fallout 4, that's the rumor.

46:16.000 --> 46:26.000
It'll be interesting to see what trailers do come out. We got some big game reveals at these awards, even though I'm kind of in whatever on the Spike Awards.

46:26.000 --> 46:34.000
I always like to look at YouTube the next day, because there's a lot of trailers. Skyrim was announced at one of those. I remember that. That was a pretty big deal.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Little did we know.

46:37.000 --> 46:47.000
Oh my god, there's so many. That's kind of one of the reasons I'm like, do I really want to start Fallout New Vegas? Because Skyrim, holy shit, did that take off a lot of my time.

46:47.000 --> 47:01.000
Speaking of those games, Loki, when they inevitably announce Elder Scrolls VI for next generation consoles, will you be on board? Oh no, you'll be like, eh, it's on PC. I can mod it on PC.

47:02.000 --> 47:06.000
Yeah, I might actually... I don't blame you. I don't blame you.

47:06.000 --> 47:17.000
I mean, they have a lot of games that are coming out that are comparing them to that, like The Witcher 3. I don't know if Thief has so much open world, but there's a lot of sandbox games like that.

47:17.000 --> 47:22.000
But, it's hard.

47:22.000 --> 47:31.000
Tigerclaw having that same thought at live.vognetwork.com. What if they announce Elder Scrolls VI for next gen? Not before the next Fallout, because it kind of seems like they're going in that pattern.

47:31.000 --> 47:38.000
Elder Scrolls VI is not coming for another couple years at least. Because they have also online, which is at some point.

47:38.000 --> 47:49.000
Which I think is good news, because I think they need some time to, you know, again, the games that came out right during the launch window, little bit not the full potential of the system.

47:49.000 --> 47:57.000
I think the more time that Elder Scrolls VI has to incubate a little bit, I think that's actually a good thing. We don't want it right away. Trust me, it's a good thing.

47:57.000 --> 48:10.000
So, there is that part of me, and here is where I run into Best Buy or Target and throw myself on the counter to get a Playstation 4 or Xbox One.

48:10.000 --> 48:16.000
Anyone know the big announcement trailer to get me to throw myself on the counter? Mass Effect 4.

48:17.000 --> 48:23.000
Because you know it's just a matter of time before the details start coming out on that, and that is...

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
What if it's current gen too?

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
Mass Effect 4?

48:26.000 --> 48:31.000
Yeah, what if it's current gen? Because there's a good chance that will be current gen as well.

48:31.000 --> 48:39.000
Although it is stupid EA, and they will try to, you know, try to do that. Because it works so well for an NBA Live 14.

48:39.000 --> 48:51.000
That's a very good question. I don't think it will. But you're right, it could happen, and I think we also need to consider the fact that there's tons of people who play those games on PCs and are perfectly happy.

48:51.000 --> 48:57.000
I play Mass Effect 3 multiplayer on PC myself, and it's great. So I could just keep the PC.

48:58.000 --> 49:08.000
I think for me though, having that graphic... My first experience with Mass Effect was on the Xbox 360, so I still associate in my mind with consoles.

49:08.000 --> 49:14.000
I just kind of think for me Mass Effect 4 is only going to sweeten the pot for the next gen consoles.

49:14.000 --> 49:22.000
It's not really going to be the reason I get a Playstation 4 or Xbox One or whatever, but I'm just going to add that to the list of why.

49:22.000 --> 49:27.000
Just put that in all caps there in the Pro column. Mass Effect 4 right there.

49:27.000 --> 49:38.000
I'm saying Mass Effect 4, but whatever they end up calling it, because obviously the Shepard series is over. You all know what I meant.

49:38.000 --> 49:47.000
Let's see, going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com. BlackWolf says, I just don't want to see Sky on a table. Well then don't come to the mall with me.

49:48.000 --> 49:54.000
Alright, let's get into some housekeeping and then we'll do gaming news of course.

49:54.000 --> 49:58.000
Just real quick, don't forget you can follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

49:58.000 --> 50:07.000
We are also available on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google Plus. Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
We finally got one of those short URLs like a lot of people are getting now.

50:10.000 --> 50:14.000
Also, I think this is something we're going to do starting this week.

50:14.000 --> 50:19.000
Finally, thanks to Jason's help, I was able to get the keys to the YouTube channel back.

50:19.000 --> 50:23.000
So we are going to look at posting episodes of Orange Lounge Radio on YouTube.

50:23.000 --> 50:29.000
We're not Orange Lounge Video all of a sudden, so that is not something that's going to be there.

50:29.000 --> 50:39.000
It will just be the audio with a static picture. Maybe at a later date we could, if we talk about screenshots we can enhance the videos of that or something.

50:39.000 --> 50:47.000
It depends how well received the YouTube thing is. This is just a crazy experiment we have to try to get the show out to more people.

50:47.000 --> 50:51.000
Because YouTube does have a very big audience, I think the show can get more exposure.

50:51.000 --> 50:55.000
So hello to all you YouTubers and thanks for checking out the show.

50:55.000 --> 51:02.000
Depending on how well the show is received on YouTube we might see what else we can kind of do to enhance the show that way.

51:02.000 --> 51:06.000
But yeah, right now it's just about trying to get the show out there.

51:06.000 --> 51:13.000
And plus the news that YouTube is coming to things like the 3DS, YouTube is available on the Vita.

51:13.000 --> 51:18.000
Anything that is another way that people can easily listen to OLR we want to get in on that.

51:18.000 --> 51:25.000
So that is coming, I think starting this week. I think this very episode will go up on YouTube if everything goes in my favor.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
So there we go.

51:26.000 --> 51:30.000
Alright, let's move on.

51:30.000 --> 51:35.000
Tigerclaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, you ever played around with Google Hangout? Yes.

51:35.000 --> 51:40.000
Perhaps you can try doing OLR with it. It would archive to YouTube. No.

51:40.000 --> 51:48.000
I'm going to be honest, and maybe I'm just being a stickler with this. This isn't interesting to watch.

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
We're all just sitting around a table with our microphones in hand.

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
No, I'm not interested in watching any of this.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
It's really not that interesting to watch.

51:58.000 --> 52:05.000
And I would need a director to sit here with us if we were to push video to its full potential.

52:05.000 --> 52:11.000
I guess my point I'm trying to get at is, if we make that jump to video, I kind of don't want it to be half-assed.

52:11.000 --> 52:16.000
I want somebody to actually be able to, if we talk about a game, throw up the b-roll footage of the game.

52:16.000 --> 52:21.000
Be able to show that there. And that's just kind of too much for us to be able to put out right now.

52:21.000 --> 52:28.000
I think, and I've been on this show for many, I think this show is best consumed, listen to it in the background,

52:28.000 --> 52:33.000
while you play video games, or while you chat in our chat room, or while you're at work doing whatever,

52:33.000 --> 52:37.000
you know, data entry or writing or whatever it is you do that doesn't require you to be listening at work right now.

52:37.000 --> 52:44.000
I think our show is best consumed that way. I think if you were to sit here and watch Talking Heads for three hours,

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
talk about video games, that would be the most boring thing in the world to me.

52:47.000 --> 52:52.000
But that's just my thought. Convince me I'm wrong, and maybe I am just being stubborn,

52:52.000 --> 52:58.000
and keep in mind I've done radio for the past ten plus years, so this just might be my old fuddy-duddy way of thought.

52:58.000 --> 53:03.000
Convince me I'm wrong, I'm all ears. I've been wrong before, lord knows.

53:03.000 --> 53:12.000
So, alright. Let's get into gaming news tonight, now that that's all out of the way.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
One hour in.

53:15.000 --> 53:21.000
Here's the thing, and now I'm worried about this, I've probably offended some people who do do the Talking Heads thing,

53:21.000 --> 53:26.000
and it's like, I'm not trying to offend people, it's just the whole thing where it's like,

53:26.000 --> 53:32.000
I just, for me, and the show we're trying to produce, I just don't think that's particularly interesting. For me.

53:32.000 --> 53:36.000
For us. For this show. Other people pulled off eloquently.

53:36.000 --> 53:41.000
You do what works for you, and I will say this, Google Hangout is a great way to produce a podcast.

53:41.000 --> 53:48.000
Super easy. Super easy. And I am all for more voices getting out there, and more people being heard.

53:48.000 --> 53:52.000
So if Google Hangouts the way you do that, go for it. Absolutely.

53:52.000 --> 54:00.000
So, I will brace myself for the angry emails I'm sure to incur from all that, but know that I am trying to be well-intentioned.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Alright, Loki.

54:02.000 --> 54:10.000
Alright, so, like with any console launch, there's a little bit of hiccups usually with, well, usually with console launches,

54:10.000 --> 54:18.000
and that was definitely the case with the PlayStation 4, with the random blinking blue light of Doom, or whatever you want to call it.

54:18.000 --> 54:24.000
Well, now the Xbox One is also running the similar issues, except no blinking lights this time around.

54:24.000 --> 54:32.000
Instead, it's the Soundra. Yes, much like the Xbox 360, except at least it's not actually, you know,

54:32.000 --> 54:40.000
carving a nice ring into your disc this time. It's just making a grinding noise, and not reading discs.

54:40.000 --> 54:51.000
And so people are running into those quite a bit, and it's kind of interesting because, you know, the reports seem to be all over the place,

54:51.000 --> 54:59.000
and a lot of people are talking about it, and even, you know, there's some articles saying that they've received, you know, hundreds of tips regarding it.

54:59.000 --> 55:08.000
So, I don't know. Once again, I mean, the console's only been out a few days, so it's hard to say how widespread anything is,

55:08.000 --> 55:15.000
but I think it's important for Microsoft at this point to do kind of some damage control.

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
I think, you know, because I saw their response, which is basically, you know,

55:19.000 --> 55:25.000
hey, if you have an issue with your system, call the customer support, blah, blah, blah, blah.

55:25.000 --> 55:38.000
OK, that's very, I don't know, that's very scripted of you to say that, and instead of dressing, you know, how many units might be affected,

55:38.000 --> 55:48.000
versus, you know, last week when the similar situation was happening where different systems were, you know, breaking or DOA from Sony,

55:48.000 --> 55:55.000
you heard, you know, the top Sony execs come out and say, hey, listen, OK, we've received, you know, reports from people,

55:55.000 --> 56:02.000
you know, saying that their systems are bad, you know, based on what we've shipped out so far, it's affecting less than 1% of our systems,

56:02.000 --> 56:08.000
and, you know, just to let you know that we are replacing those systems immediately and expediting them to customers.

56:08.000 --> 56:16.000
I think right there that's addressing everything instead of, you know, not commenting on it and letting everyone speculate how bad the issue is,

56:16.000 --> 56:24.000
and I'm worried that, I mean, and I don't want to sound doom and gloom, but I'm worried that it may be a little bit more widespread than it seems.

56:24.000 --> 56:33.000
Hopefully it's not, because I would hope that, you know, they would test their hardware, you know, well and figure out that these problems,

56:33.000 --> 56:43.000
hopefully, you know, some sort of bad run on these disk drives or something, but be wary at console launches that you're going to run into issues.

56:44.000 --> 56:51.000
Kind of a fair warning for any console launch that there's going to be speed bumps.

56:51.000 --> 56:55.000
But we don't think this is as bad as the Red Ring of Death yet.

56:55.000 --> 57:00.000
So far, yeah, not as big of an issue, but we'll see. Time will tell.

57:00.000 --> 57:07.000
You know, and really, once again, you know, it's, see how they respond to it, how, you know, how they,

57:07.000 --> 57:12.000
I think it would be nice if they came out and, you know, said something similar to what Sony said, where it's like,

57:12.000 --> 57:19.000
hey, listen, it's only this, it's not a widespread thing. We've only received, you know, you know, it's 0.04% or whatever,

57:19.000 --> 57:24.000
you know, compared to the system, you know, it's within standards. This is what, you know, we were expecting.

57:24.000 --> 57:29.000
I just wish there was more coming from them other than very scripted, you know.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
To be fair, this is what we were expecting.

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
Well, no.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Is it going to work if I'm one of those people?

57:34.000 --> 57:40.000
Not what we're expecting, but it's within regular electronics yields as far as defectives go.

57:40.000 --> 57:45.000
I mean, it's such a low percentage that, you know, it's with...

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
It sounds like they're making it easy, at least, on the Microsoft side. I don't know about Sony's side,

57:48.000 --> 57:53.000
but on the Microsoft side, they just kind of, they just ship you a new one, and then you have to ship the old one back in two weeks,

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
or you get charged.

57:54.000 --> 57:55.000
That's what they're doing, yeah.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
They make it easy, yeah.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
That's easier than the 360 replacement was, to be honest.

57:58.000 --> 58:02.000
Yeah, and that's great. I'm glad that they're doing that, and I think that's what they need to do,

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
but at the same time, I think that they need to...

58:04.000 --> 58:10.000
Especially, come on, Microsoft, you need to know, like, after all of the fallout and stuff from...

58:10.000 --> 58:17.000
Even when you're announcing the Xbox One stuff, I think you need to talk more to your customers more directly,

58:17.000 --> 58:21.000
and not sound like it's some scripted PR thing. Make it more candid, I guess.

58:21.000 --> 58:25.000
Interesting, kind of two good comments in the chat room, but a little different.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Gene at Live.vognetware.com says,

58:28.000 --> 58:32.000
Damage control will freak out and make it a bigger deal, though.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
It could have that effect where...

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
It didn't seem like that was the effect, though.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
The media would pick up on that.

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
Tao says,

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
But they're just not... I mean, all they're doing is just saying,

58:46.000 --> 58:49.000
hey, you have a defective system, contact customer support.

58:49.000 --> 58:53.000
I could have figured that out without reading anything from them.

58:53.000 --> 58:56.000
It's not like, oh, well, shit, I don't know what to do with this console.

58:56.000 --> 59:01.000
I mean, come on, if you buy an Xbox console, you know what to do with your console if it's gonna be broken.

59:01.000 --> 59:06.000
I'm just saying, because, you know, especially if you bought it launched last year.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Or, not last year, last time around.

59:08.000 --> 59:12.000
All right, well, to be fair, you know, we were talking about Xbox One problems,

59:12.000 --> 59:15.000
but PlayStation 4 also had problems, so let's talk about those.

59:15.000 --> 59:21.000
And Sony talked about, in an interview with Engadget this week, exactly where those numbers are at,

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
which Loki referred to a minute ago.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
So that's almost exactly what you were saying, Loki.

59:37.000 --> 59:40.000
We understand the frustration of consumers that have had a problem,

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
and are working with them and our retail partners to help troubleshoot issues,

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
and ensure affected units are exchanged.

59:45.000 --> 59:51.000
So, you know, I really don't know how they can give you a better answer than that.

59:51.000 --> 59:55.000
Although, again, if I'm one of those 1%, I'm still not gonna be happy.

59:55.000 --> 59:59.000
But, I mean, I guess, what else can they do? If there's a problem, there's a problem.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I mean, who's actually happy about defective electronics? Nobody.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000
But, you know, I think about it, you know, it's really not just video game consoles.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000
I mean, iPhones are kind of notorious for having a lot of problems, too.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Like, the frickin' switches, like, on my first iPhone 5, that little switch.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Or what was it? Something broke. Oh, my sleep button, that's what it was.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
The sleep button stopped clicking.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:26.000
You know, those things start breaking pretty easy, and I wasn't using my phone for anything too strenuous.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000
So, you know, it's not like only game consoles are broken all the time,

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:37.000
but it's still irritating. Luckily, Apple had a pretty good program where I called, went to the Apple store.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Guy looked at my thing and said, yep, we're gonna give you a new one.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Gave me a new one, and boop, just switched it right out. Pretty painless.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
So, we detected water damage on that. We're not gonna...

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Well, luckily, I didn't have that problem. They were pretty cool about it.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.000
So, I usually find that if you're nice to them, they're nice to you, but I guess it really depends on who you get. I don't know.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Jason's gonna be doing some stories for us tonight, since Jamie's not here.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:08.000
I am, and easily, per the organization, you don't even have to change the initial, because Jason and Jamie start with the same letter.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Perhaps a relic of back when the Xbox was still a check-in every 24 hours if the system is offline,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:25.000
achievements will not unlock if you're playing a game while it's offline, presumably also if your internet connection's down, anything along those lines.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:34.000
The common consensus is just that this is simply a holdover for achievement verification on the web, and not some kind of...

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.000
It'd be nice if this were some kind of, like, a buying achievement deterrent or something of the sort,

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000
but it's more likely just that it fell within the same expectations of the system always being online.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
One of the really fun things with this article is that...

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:56.000
So this was an article, this was an announcement posted on Xbox 360 achievements that when they realized that I was playing one game,

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.000
I got achievements for another one, because apparently their internet connection had died for some period of time.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:08.000
And so they linked to a help article on support.xbox.com, and I thought this was...

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.000
I guess I've always known that we've been headed in this direction, but it makes me laugh and cry equal amounts.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:20.000
If you get no gamer score earned from app achievements, the prescribed resolution says,

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:28.000
you can earn app achievements for basic use of an app, such as watching a movie on Netflix, at the app developer's discretion.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.000
App achievements do not affect gamer score, though they may bring other in-app awards.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Emphasis more on the award and less the score, but the whole...

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Games have parodied this with a press start achievement.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Well, this stuff is starting to go into things that don't have anything to do with gaming at all.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I'm going to give you a great example. Target, the store, has a brand new app on iPhone,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
probably on Android too, I can't imagine why it wouldn't be. It's called Cartwheel.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
It's like their new little coupon thing, right?

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:05.000
And you go into this big Target database that they have of all these coupons, and you add them to your barcode.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
You have to have a Facebook, I think, to sign up for it.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
And you put all the little coupons on your thing, right?

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000
And then you have your barcode, and they scan your phone at the store, and you get money back with it.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:23.000
But here's the thing. You get achievements, little achievements in Cartwheel that give you more slots to put more coupons on.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I shit you not. So you link up with a Facebook friend, ka-ching! Achievement unlocked, and you get one more coupon slot.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000
So all I'm saying with that is that this whole thing, gaming achievements and everything, the app achievements,

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:43.000
it is now something Grandma uses to save money at Target. That's what achievements have become.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:52.000
I mean, I get it, and Foursquare very largely pioneered a lot of this with its badges, and just the continued increase of them.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:04:01.000
And there was also a camera app, not terribly unlike Instagram in 2009, that when Game Center and Custom Achievement integration first hit,

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:12.000
they would give you achievements and scores for filterless and filtered photos and all of these other snazzy framing and other things that you can do with the app.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:20.000
I get it, and on a game console, if there's actually a merit to the reward, sure, but I... I don't know.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:26.000
The generation's here. It's finally starting. Whatever. Just made me laugh and also cry.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:33.000
All right. Some people in chat are asking questions here. Let's see. Tigerclaw says,

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Yeah, that does sound weird. What if they give you achievement for watching certain movies?

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.000
What if you unlock an achievement of a movie you didn't want people to know you... which cause?

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000
I don't know where the grammar went there. One is a guilty pleasure and afraid to tell anyone.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.000
My assumption is certain things could be private by default, or in the case of the cartwheel thing,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I was just scanning through what the deepest discounts were, so I was looking at everything, and one of the things that came up was panties.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:07.000
So I could save on panties if I want, but it was marked with a little padlock, and I was like, what does that mean? Oh, it's private.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:14.000
So if I'm buying women's panties, I'm not going to have to answer that question with my friends who see that I'm using the app to save money.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Rob, why are you buying women's panties?

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000
You watched Jersey Shore behind the scenes. A hundred points for your lost sanity.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000
So I would imagine certain things would be private, or you could lock away, or what have you, so there you go.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat wants to remind you, VOG gives achievements. That's right, our lovely network, vognetwork.com.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Gamified with the achievements, it's true. And now, in case you haven't heard me pimp this enough,

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:47.000
that whole gamification is turning into prizes. If you haven't checked that out, the raffle at vognetwork.com.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000
We're giving away cards against humanity this month. Next month we're giving away. Tune in next week to find out.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.000
I finally got my first comment-based achievement on VOG Network the other day.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Did you?

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Yeah, I don't comment too terribly much, but I was posting addendums and explaining things on a previous episode,

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000
and I got enough cumulative likes that I'm finally starting to get some loot for the task.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Blackwolf in chat says, the app achievements are general. They're like, watch ten videos about your favorite team in the NFL app, not watch ten videos about the Jacksonville Jaguars.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Good.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I think I saw a little shade there. Alright, anyway, so achievements, you have to get them online and all that.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000
I think there's some people out there that might be making a bigger deal out of this than it needs to be, because my thought is,

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:40.000
well, aren't achievements mostly an online thing anyway? I mean, I realize some people might be like-

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:48.000
No, I wouldn't say so. Like, for games that have an expansive multiplayer experience, more so than any other, sure,

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:56.000
but the majority of the games that I play that have single-player career, NHL, a good- maybe not so much NHL, I take that one back,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:01.000
but most everything else that I've played, a good 70%, 80% of them are local.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:07.000
But if you want to show off those achievements to anybody, you're going to have to connect online eventually, so it can talk to the server.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
360 and Playstation 3 both do that today.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Sure.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
So, I mean, I think-

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:24.000
It's the same group of people that complain, that were complaining about the 24-hour requirement because shoddy internet, internet instability, you know, not having broadband, yeah.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:31.000
All right. So, looking at- Bobby really wants me to read this. He sent me a private message.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Please note, the Xbox One achievements seem to be a combination of achievements and rewards on the 360.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:46.000
The rewards bring avatar items on the 360. On Xbox One, some of those zero-point achievements bring in-game badges and titles.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:52.000
So, yeah, I mean, and that's kind of like the whole, you know, like I was talking about Cartwheel a minute ago.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000
You're not playing anything, but you're still getting those rewards for using it.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000
And I imagine even things like Twitch and so- because Twitch sent an email out.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000
They blasted all their broadcasters and said, hey, you can get achievements in our new app.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:16.000
And maybe- and I'm making shit up here, but it would not be outside the realm of possibility that Twitch could be like, and if you were in these achievements, you can archive X more hours of video.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Or your videos will be saved for X many more hours. Or your YouTubes will export this much faster.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Or whatever they want to do. You can chat in this color. You know, they could- whatever little achievements they wanted to get, they could do.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000
And it wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility for their power users, quote unquote.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:40.000
So, all right. Let's move on. Loki. Speaking of Twitch, right?

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Yes. Speaking of Twitch, I mean-

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:58.000
It's- I just have to say, before you get into this, it's so fascinating to me how much that site is now really, like, we have mentioned that site easily 20 times more the past month than we did last year.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Like, it's- the way it's so integrated into gaming culture now fascinates me. And again, I'm gonna say this again, it really fascinates me. Nobody's competing with them.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Do they have patents I don't know about? I mean, I guess there's Ustream, but you don't hear Ustream as much as you hear about Twitch. Fascinates me.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:27.000
I mean, I would say the only other thing I can think of that comes close is, like, YouTube. But that is obviously- YouTube's different as well. You know, it's more video on demand and-

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Twitch, as most know, was born out of Justin TV. Justin TV is in the same class as Ustream.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000
They're all very general and they have incredibly diverse content and it's a very broad service.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Twitch did something incredibly significant for gaming. It just isolated it to gaming.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:55.000
And that alone, and, you know, featured the biggest games that everybody goes into. Spectate, Dota, League of Legends, Starcraft, WoW to a lesser extent, Hearthstone now.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:03.000
They did something that was very specific, perhaps because they started signing contracts with these big companies a year or two ago.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:11.000
But they have a dedicated, significant gaming experience and now they are reaping the fruits of those contracts.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:22.000
It's just fascinating to me. And I think I joked last week, maybe Microsoft should delay Twitch TV so they can launch their whole Skype broadcast or Skype game room.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:30.000
You know, I'm really surprised nobody else is trying to kind of get in on that. But anyway, that's a whole other show.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Sorry, Loki, I didn't mean to derail you, but it fascinates me how much we're talking about this and how much of a gaming culture it is now.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Well, so, you know, like we've said before, and actually I think more talking about Nintendo even.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Just, you know, hey, look at all the bad things that could possibly happen with, you know, because we were talking about the whole SwapNo thing and now you're saying,

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:05.000
hey, well, you know, what's to stop somebody from showing their penis over the video chat on Nintendo Wii U?

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Well, people found out that, hey, guess what, you know, a really cool thing that you can do with the PlayStation 4 is that you can stream stuff with that wonderful Playroom app that's on there.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:27.000
So, you know, you can basically sit down in a room and have those little robots running around and stuff and you can almost create your own talk show.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:36.000
That's what, like, some people have been doing is they've been sitting there filming themselves doing stupid shit within the Playroom app.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:48.000
And, unfortunately, it only takes, you know, one person to realize, hey, you can stream stuff out of there to have someone else realize, hey, I can stream really nasty, weird shit from there and that's what happens.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000
So, Twitch has been trying to crack down on it.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:58.000
You know, they're continuing, it says, we continue to moderate according to the terms of service, non-gaming content is not allowed.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Non-gaming content, if using PlayStation 4 Playroom, the content must be about games or gaming within our terms of service.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Thanks for understanding. Discussing gaming is gaming content.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
There are numerous such channels on Twitch such as One More Game.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:23.000
However, what does not fall under the terms of service would be some dude having sex with his girlfriend on a couch in the middle of the Playroom app.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:29.000
You know what? Twitch had to have a way to deal with this anyway, though, because you could do all that shit on a PC if you wanted with your webcam.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:45.000
So, it's not like this is a foreign territory for Twitch to have to deal with, but, certainly, the PlayStation 4 and it broadening the Twitch community like that maybe is kind of the interesting element of this.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:54.000
The unfortunate thing about, I really hope they don't disable Playroom for streaming, because just like I talked about the Google Plus thing earlier is a great way to get your foot in the door.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:02.000
I think, and I think it's really fun when there's a lot of people, you know, part of what I like about this show too is that we're all in the same room, we all get to react to each other and so forth.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:12.000
I think it would be awesome if people could do like broadcasts on Twitch through Playroom where they're all in the same room and, you know, confiding with each other and gesturing at each other and all that.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:26.000
There was one example of that. There was someone doing a show called The Spartan Show and they were sitting down at a desk and they were talking about, you know, the PlayStation 4 and stuff and I think they were even taking Skype calls on a computer that was in there and they had like the setup and stuff.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:35.000
So, that's kind of cool. Having sex with somebody or in this case, you know, there was one that's like some guy motorboating somebody in a horse head mask.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Not, that's a little weird, but.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Hasn't that happened on this show, though?

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Not a horse head mask yet.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Maybe not a horse head mask, but I'm pretty sure one of the times.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Motorboating has probably happened.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Motorboating has definitely happened on this show.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:55.000
I'm like, all those times Princess Irene has been here, I know motorboating has happened on this show.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Is this when I interject and say that Bobby Blackwell was just a little bit ahead of his time?

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Friday Night Gaming?

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Friday Night Gaming.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000
That was pre-Twitch. I'm fairly confident the entire age of that show.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
He was doing it on Ustream, the other site.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Anyway, so outside of this crazy stuff, something of course that's being worked in right now is archiving.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000
They're planning on doing it for the Playstation 4.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Considering for the Xbox One, I think probably just right now because the Xbox One Twitch service hasn't launched yet.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000
So, once that does, we'll see what, you know, the feasibility of all that stuff.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000
I'm sure that they're going to have archiving on both sides at some point.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:38.000
And of course, like I mentioned, the Xbox One does not have the Twitch service that launched and that is coming later on.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Sometime in the first part of 2014.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Yeah.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Alright. Lots of news with that. It's getting to be very social.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000
You know, there was an interesting Twitter discussion that happened this week.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.000
And it was kind of about somebody was basically saying, like, what's the big fucking deal about game streaming?

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000
I'm paraphrasing here really bad, but what's the big fucking deal about game streaming?

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Like, do people really watch that stuff?

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000
And I would say the answer is obviously yes.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:16.000
And it's even getting bigger with all this in, you know, kind of enrichments into the Playstation 4 and Xbox One.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000
But the question was more like, you know, well, why?

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Why do people watch other people play games when you can be playing them themselves?

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:30.000
And I respect that position because I was there myself just a couple years ago, maybe even last year.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
And I'm sure I've said that on this show.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Why the hell would I livestream when I can play something myself?

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:41.000
But I have found through trying it and kind of getting into other people's streams

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000
and seeing more and more of my friends easily be able to livestream.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000
It's, you know, it's so easy on Playstation 4 and helping friends of mine be able to stream.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:54.000
It's somewhat the modern day equivalent of being able to go plop down next to somebody on the couch.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Whatcha doin'?

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Even across, like, long distances.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Because that's almost like what it's become.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Like, Xtaphir might be streaming Resogun one night and I can just virtually go plop on him next to the couch.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Whatcha doin'? Whatcha playin'? How you doin'? You're dyin'.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:13.000
You know, it's like kind of the modern equivalent of that in a way.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
I think for me it's like, why?

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
You know, for some people they get to see the best of the best.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
They might have some other reasons too.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:24.000
But, you know, for me I just love the fact that there's people that would even want to watch it.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:30.000
And I can make something that can be a single player experience sometimes be more social.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:37.000
A friend of mine was streaming a bunch of fighting games, which normally I've been to a couple fighting game tournaments in my area.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Yeah, okay, I haven't played a fighting game in a really long time.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
But then he switched to Divekick.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:47.000
That game is completely frickin' fascinating.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
And I'm mildly obsessed with it now.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000
I know him, I have known him for a number of years, so I was just kind of coming in to socialize.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:01.000
I've heard how good he is at Persona 3 Arena, so I was just kind of seeing what he's up to and seeing the other games he wants to play.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:06.000
And just happenstance, I saw a new game that I literally never heard about before that day.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:13.000
And now every time I see it, it's just so simple on the face, yet so incredibly deep.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000
And just a very, you know, Divekick is unlike any other fighting game out there.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000
So it was just a good, random occurrence.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Dan at Live.vongnetwork.com says,

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:54.000
I told my wife, this is like my football. That's why I watch people stream games.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:02.000
And now that these apps are showing up on TVs and the devices and so forth, you watch it almost the same way you watch football now.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Instead of a cable box, it's an Xbox One box.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Is that redundant? Xbox One box?

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Mildly.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Mildly redundant.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Doomplaig says, some games are really fun to watch, particularly open world type games like Grand Theft Auto.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:21.000
This wasn't particularly a big one, but imagine the modern equivalent of Geometry Wars.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Incredible twitch action, you know, once your brain can actually adapt to everything that's going on.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000
It turns into a very fun spectator event incredibly quickly.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000
MaskedBishop in the chatroom says,

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000
When live streaming on the next gen consoles, can you see your viewer count?

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Well, we don't know about Xbox One just yet, because that app's not out.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
But on PlayStation 4, yes.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:46.000
When you do the whole little, like, where it has the side and the bottom bar and it kind of shrinks the screen just slightly,

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000
you can actually see how many people are watching the stream.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000
And it also counts how many chat lines have been spoken so far, which is interesting.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
You can see how active your chatroom is.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.000
But you can also see at the very bottom, you see the last two lines of chat.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Which, if you don't have a lot of people watching, you can probably stay on top of very easy.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:08.000
But imagine if you're one of the more popular broadcasters, and you wouldn't be able to stay on top of the chat that way.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.000
So I don't know.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000
20 messages a second? That thing will never stop moving.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
That would be tough, so I don't know.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.000
But I think a lot of people probably don't interact with their chatrooms as much if you get that many comments,

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
because it's just impossible to stay on top of, so.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Alright, anyhow, let's move on.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Sorry, we're running really long tonight, but hey, it's one of those nights.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:32.000
I guess we dabble on this a little earlier in the show, but I want to talk about it a little more now.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.000
This is about Nintendo talking about their Wii U lineup for 2014.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Basically, in an interview with Game Trailers, Reggie Fils-Aime, who of course is Nintendo of America's president,

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:47.000
said that there will not be a Wii U software drought like we saw in 2013.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Here it is, quote,

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:55.000
The way we're going to be different is, we're going to certainly have a steadier pace of games, both for Wii U and for 3DS.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.000
The marketing activity is going to be constant throughout the entire year.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.000
You tease me a little bit that, boy, the first half of 2013 was a little quiet.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
And you know what, you look back and it was.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.000
We're not going to be making that same mistake in 2014.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Hmm, admission.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:14.000
So the pace, the ongoing activity, touching the consumer and messaging is what we're all about.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
That's going to be a big difference next year.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.000
I will say this, I went and saw Catching Fire on Friday, which by the way, amazing.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000
But they had a Wii U commercial, actually.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:31.000
You know how they do, they do like the, this is the first look of the movies at the cinema.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Enjoy the, you know, basically the ads thrown at you while you're waiting for the movie to start.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Well, one of them was a big Wii U ad that actually was Mario 3D World.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.000
And I laughed at it because it had a girl in a cat suit.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000
And I was like, this is like some weird furry action going on here.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.000
No offense to furries, but it was just a little weird to see that in the commercial and so forth.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
I was just laughing.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
And it even said, out now.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000
And I was like, wow, that commercial must have just come out today.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Just in time for Catching Fire, which, you know, is obviously doing huge box office this weekend.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
But I digress.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.000
So Nintendo is trying to get the word out there in other ways, for sure.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
So they have the movie ads, if nothing else.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000
But Reggie promising you're not going to see that same drought.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Well, I bet that's why Donkey Kong and Mario Kart 8 aren't coming out right now.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
I think that's a huge part of it.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
I think the Donkey Kong delay was strategical.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.000
I don't think it had anything to do with the game not being done.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:29.000
I think Mario Kart maybe needed a little more tweaks, because pushing that all the way back to April is quite a ways, maybe further.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:35.000
But I think the Donkey Kong's now what? February? I think that is a strategical delay.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000
I think you didn't want to have two platformers out back to back.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:43.000
And Mario 3D World is so damn good, you don't want to release Donkey Kong at the same time.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.000
And then it's like, oh yeah, there's two good platformers.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
It's because there's not a lot of Wii U titles coming out.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Yeah.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Seriously, there's not a lot of Wii U titles coming out.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.000
So when Reggie talks about this whole, there's not going to be a drought, are you saying?

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
He's full of shit.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.000
He's full of shit.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:05.000
He's absolutely 100% full of shit, because here are the games coming out in February on the Wii U.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
The Lego Movie and Donkey Kong.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:13.000
So, does that sound like full of shit to me? That sounds like a whole heap of shit.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Could there be stuff we just don't know about yet?

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Because, let's be real, they cranked out that Zelda Wind Waker HD thing fast.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Could they have other little, I mean, and we've heard the rumors before about the 64 revisited.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000
I don't remember what the, what the hell did they call that?

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000
I even read that article.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
I think I joked it was Wii U Imagine, like they call RuPaul's Drag Race or something.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000
It was something similar to that, but you know what I'm talking about, right?

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Wii U Imagine.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Wii U Imagine or something.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Could that be something that's in their pocket that they haven't quite played those cards yet?

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000
I don't think that they've, they've already announced their first quarter stuff.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:54.000
I'm sorry, they have one other title in, so they have a title in January.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
They are one of the only Wii U titles in January.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:02.000
It's Wii Fit U, but it's a disc-based version for the game that's out already right now.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:07.000
So that doesn't, I don't really count that because you could get it right now.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.000
But yes, disc-based version of Wii Fit U will be out in January.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
But come on, it's just...

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Which was supposed to be out this year, if I'm not mistaken.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000
It is out right now.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
No, the disc was supposed to be out this year, wasn't it?

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Yeah, that was pushed back.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
But there is a drought.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
They're third-party, there's not a whole ton of games coming out.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
It's just like the Lego movie.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000
And that's it so far for February.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
March, there's gonna be some stuff, but that's it.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Gene in chat brings up a good point.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Live.fognetwork.com.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One drought, though.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Could those systems be...

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Not for as long, period.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Launch window, whatever.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Well, I mean, at least we know...

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Is Destiny first quarter, or is that further back?

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
We look at it somewhere for Destiny.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Right now, I think placeholder is first quarter.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Okay, but Titanfall is first quarter for sure, right?

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Titanfall is March.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000
So, there's some things trickling in there, at least.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
But, I mean, Gene could have a good point.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
I mean, could the other system...

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000
I mean, what do the other systems have that's so great?

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Well, there's a lot of placeholder stuff right now.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.000
And to be fair, Lego Movie is on all platforms.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000
So, there's that.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.000
They do have some other titles.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
You know, because I don't remember off the top of my head,

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
so I'm gonna actually go look.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000
But, I know a lot of the stuff I have right now is placeholder.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Thief is supposed to be pretty soon.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
I don't know if that's still gonna be first quarter,

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.000
if that'll get pushed back.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000
I was gonna say...

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
I think, at least in PlayStation's camp,

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000
I don't know so much about Xbox One,

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
but PlayStation's camp, they're teasing a lot of...

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Infamous.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Well, they're teasing a lot of... Oh, yeah, Infamous.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Well, that's...

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
That's March, I think.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
They're teasing a lot of, like, betas.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.000
You know, there's the Destiny beta.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
There's the Final Fantasy XIV beta.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
There's the Elder Scrolls Online beta.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Like, they're kind of trying to fill in the gap with all these,

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
like, well, the games won't be out,

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
but all these awesome previews you're waiting for will be.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
So, give or take that.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
So, anyway.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Alright.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.000
So, if you don't have any other games to report on,

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000
we'll move over to the next story.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000
I'll look it up.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000
I'll talk about it in a release.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000
You work on that.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Moving on to Jason.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Leaving the consoles,

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.000
as this game has never made a release on one so far,

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Step Evolution announces ReRave Plus Arcade.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:34.000
I have not seen the current ReRave arcade game,

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
but I'm going to assume it's very similar

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000
to the rest of the touch-based attractions

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
that Dave & Buster has.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
So, it is a big 40-inch touchscreen

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
at about just above waist level

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000
and a nice placard sign to advertise what the game is.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000
But at a trade show in just the last couple of days,

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000
IAAPA, they announced ReRave Plus

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
with a new cabinet design.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Very similar to how a lot of other games,

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000
notably DJ Max Technica, are going about it.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Standing cabinet, taller than you,

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
with a little miniature platform

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
where the subwoofer is that you step up onto.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.000
You have the lean-in touchscreen that you go into play

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000
and then a spectator's touchscreen above your face.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:22.000
The improvements that come to ReRave Plus,

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.000
notably any graphical changes or song lists,

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.000
will be available for current ReRave arcade installations,

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000
but this new cabinet will look a hell of a lot better

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
for people that want to plunk that money in again.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.000
I've played ReRave a couple times just on my phone.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Probably more likely my iPad

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
because phone's a little bit difficult.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Just a quick overview of the game

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000
is that you have touch targets with timing.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
It is a music rhythm game.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.000
You touch them at a particular time.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.000
It's Elite Beat Agents.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000
It's Elite Beat Agents without the dancers.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000
It's been a really long time since I played that game.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
It's virtually Elite Beat Agents.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000
The only difference is that you can kind of better see

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
when the things are going to hit with the clock formations,

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000
but that's really it.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
And multiple taps.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Didn't Elite Beat Agents have those?

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000
No.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Okay, then it's DJ Max Technica.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
I wouldn't make that comparison.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
A combination of the two...

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Anyways, ReRave Plus,

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.000
massive improvements for the arcade installations next year,

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000
and it's a very pretty game.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
I would like to see this in my local Dave & Busters

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.000
or elsewhere that I've been that I can't think even has games.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000
I loved and hated at the same time

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000
how they have to make sure that it's going to be relevant

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
for an arcade by putting ticket spitting into it.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Yeah, I completely glossed over that

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
even though I commented on it when I was watching the video.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
This is going to be the first touch attraction game

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
that I've seen that is a redemption game

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
and actually spews tickets.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
And it's one of those things where it's like,

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
ah, gross, but then at the same time you're like,

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000
well, it's actually a worthy game to do that kind of thing.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Well, but the reality is that's the only way

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.000
it's going to get into arcades, which sucks.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Don't hear me wrong.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Imagine if DDR gave tickets.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
All those noobs getting their free song on Beginner

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
would get like one, but then everybody else

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
that plays the super hard songs,

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
hey, we just raped the whole machine of tickets.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
I'd have a ton of fucking tickets, I just gotta tell you.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
I would have a ton of fucking tickets.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Well, I think the way you would do it is that

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000
you would still have a ticket spin at the end of the game,

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
but depending on how hard the difficulty was

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.000
is how big the jackpot is.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
It should be for every step that you make

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
that's on a perfect song.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000
It's like spitting them out, like shooting out of there.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Don't trip.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000
And I stand corrected, there are a lot more delayed Wii U games.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
I forgot about which, put it this way,

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
they're not that mentionable.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000
There's Jet Tail Fin Racers,

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000
which is based off an iOS Android game.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Although there is Game of the Year contender

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Hello Kitty Cruisers that got delayed.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.000
It got delayed?

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Yeah, it got delayed.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Fuckers.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
So there's your drought.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
So yeah, if you want to call it non-drought

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.000
by delaying games, yeah sure, why not.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Let's play that way.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.000
There are some confirmed, like for example

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Drive Club is supposed to be coming out in February

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000
and also confirmed the Xbox One version

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000
of Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare is gonna be coming out.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Oh, there you go.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Alright.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000
So, if you want to talk drought, look at January.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.000
There is Wii Fit U and Dragon Ball Z Battle of Z.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000
That's it.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000
You could look at January almost every year

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
and it's the same story.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000
No it's not.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Really?

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000
This is ridiculous.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Well I do remember one year,

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
when did Bioshock Infinite come out this year?

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000
It was pretty early.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000
And then sometimes you get the Final Fantasy 13, 2.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000
13, 2 was January.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000
And now Lightning Returns I think is February or March, yeah.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
But that's encouraging.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000
It's very unusual to have two games only.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.000
In December it's also two games.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Gran Turismo 6 and then the Vita game.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
But you were supposed to have the South Park game.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
That didn't happen.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.000
That would have only been three games.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
A lot of the games left.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Alright, let's talk about what's coming out now

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
as we travel around the world and check out release dates.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Now this was a pretty lengthy segment in previous weeks

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
but as Loki's indicating it's gonna start to dry up a little bit

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.000
but let's see if there's anything for this week anyway.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Loki?

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.000
A little bit.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.000
It's more like someone took a fucking ShamWow to this shit.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000
No seriously, this week there's a whole lot of nothing.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.000
It's basically Ys Memory of Celceta

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
which is gonna be coming out on Vita.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
One super late announcement.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Air Conflicts Vietnam on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.000
And I almost think that's it.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:49.000
I'm trying to lick it real quick.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:55.000
I know that Frozen pack for Disney Infinity is supposed to be coming out this week.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
That was another one.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:01.000
But yeah, it's sad.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.000
God, is that it?

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Atari Flashback 4?

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.000
That's coming out?

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Oh really?

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
What's cool about the Flashback 4?

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Fuck if I know.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000
I wanna know more about that.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Those consoles are pretty neat.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Let's see.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000
I love retro games.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000
What can I say?

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Yeah, Disney Infinity, the Frozen Toy Box set in Power Disc Pack 2

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000
is gonna be coming out now if you're into that shit.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Good Black Friday deals.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Oh, one very late one.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:31.000
A Halo Origins bundle which is basically just a rebundling of the Halo Anniversary

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
and Halo Reach.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.000
So that'll be coming out this week as well.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:42.000
And Black Friday, there is gonna be some...

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000
I know there's a new PlayStation 3 SKU for $1.99

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:50.000
that comes with The Last of Us and Batman Arkham Origins.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.000
So that's pretty good.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Girls fashion shoot got delayed again.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
So that's on 3DS.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
And that is literally it.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Alright, let's travel to Japan where things are a little more active this week.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000
For PlayStation 3, you have Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
being released in Japan on November the 28th.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Also, Shin Sangoku Musou 7 Moshuden comes out this week.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.000
There's a lot of different versions of that limited edition.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000
That's Dynasty Warriors, isn't it?

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000
I think it is.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Koei did that one.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.000
So that's a pretty big release out there.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Also, Himawari no Kyokai no Nagai Natsu Yasumi Extra Vacation comes out this week.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Regular and limited edition.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
That's, again, all PlayStation 3.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:38.000
And Super Robot Taisen OG Infinite Battle comes out as well this week.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:41.000
So pretty busy week on the PlayStation 3 in Japan.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Taking a look at the Xbox 360 in Japan,

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:49.000
we have just Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is it on the 360 in Japan.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.000
So sounds like plenty more games coming out on the PlayStation 3 there,

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
but that's kind of the norm.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:59.000
On the PlayStation Vita, Bitter Smile comes out this week in regular and limited edition.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Criminal Girls Invitation.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Invitation to what?

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000
All sorts of criminal things.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000
That is the name of the game.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Criminal Girl Invitation.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.000
And it's all these anime chicks in jail outfits.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
This is cracking me up.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
It's definitely some type of RPG.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
I was going to say this is looking tactics-like.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.000
It's got the whole hit points.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Not anymore it's not looking like tactics.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.000
It's the hit points and magic points.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Is she spreading eagle in that shot?

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000
This is for sick people.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:28.000
I shouldn't say that.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
All right.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Other releases in Japan.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Moving on beyond that.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Shing Sengoku Musou 7 comes out on the PlayStation Vita as well.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:45.000
And White Album 2, Shiwase no Mukugawa comes out in Japan as well this week.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Pretty busy on the PlayStation Vita.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Looking at the Wii U quickly to see if there's anything this week.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag and Disney Infinity Toy Box Challenge.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:00.000
I don't know if that's the initial release of Disney Infinity in Japan.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
That's the 3DS one, yeah.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000
No, it's Wii U comes out in Japan this week.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
That is the original.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.000
So that's finally out in Japan this week it sounds like.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000
I guess they don't really have any content in there.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:16.000
And on Nintendo 3DS they have that as well.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000
And this is exciting if you have a Japanese 3DS.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Hatsune Miku Project Mirai 2 comes out.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:26.000
And there's all these little accessories to go with that if you're into that.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Surprise.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:33.000
A new orange and black 3DS XL and a turquoise and black 3DS XL or as they call it over there, LL.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Couple other quick titles here.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Toriko Ultimate Survival, Pretty Rhythm Rainbow Live Kirikirami Design, and Kamen Rider come out this week.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:47.000
And a whole hell of a lot of system and game accessories.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Yes, but that's nothing new for Japan.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
How about the UK, Jason?

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Alright, well unlike the Xbox One, Europe is just now getting its PlayStation 4.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.000
So the lineup that we've come to know is just stacking up for this week in Europe.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Angry Birds Star Wars, Battlefield 4, Contrast, FIFA 14, Injustice Gods Among Us for both PlayStation 4 and Vita.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Madden NFL 25, Need for Speed Rivals, Putty Squad, that's Wii U, Super Motherload, the Pinball Arcade, and then Tiny Brains on the PlayStation 3.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Very quiet for the other systems.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Injustice Gods Among Us is of course cross platform, PS4, PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PS Vita as well I think I already mentioned.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:36.000
And there was one more, I said Super Mario 3D World is coming to Wii U over there.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
And that's pretty much it.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Definitely the PlayStation 4 week this week.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Alrighty, just a few more news stories for you guys than the classic game of the week.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Let's run through these quickly because we're running long part A here. So, Loki.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Alright, there's a brand new firmware for PlayStation 4.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:03.000
System Update 1.51 that's going to make some, I guess, minor refinements to the system UI.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:10.000
And also, I guess, indicating when a user is downloading a game and a game patch at the same time.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:15.000
And I guess, wow that's really it.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
System Stability.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
So, yay patch!

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
As it goes with new releases.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Yeah, it's nice though that they're coming out pretty quick.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.000
That's pretty fast since the release of the system so I guess that's kind of cool.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:35.000
I wouldn't expect a major content right now but good that they're at least fixing some things.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.000
One other story here about Tomb Raider.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.000
And yes, there is a Tomb Raider sequel in development.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:48.000
And this is because Crystal Dynamics' Senior Art Director Brian Horton was talking about this during a lecture.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:54.000
And a statement that is grabbing some headlines was the fact that it was well financed.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.000
But let me bring some clarity to that statement here.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:03.000
There was a European trademark registered for Tomb Raider Reflections.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Could that be the sequel's title? Who knows.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:10.000
But certainly when trademarks, people run wild with those, but that could be it.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Square has also confirmed that there's going to be a reveal in early December.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
So possibly Spike TV.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.000
This is one of the things that will be announced during the video game awards there.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.000
And then during the UK's Bradford Animation Festival,

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:31.000
the aforementioned art director was taking some questions from the audience.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000
And he said in regards to the Tomb Raider sequel, quote,

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.000
We've announced the sequel. I'm glad I can finally talk about.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.000
The Tomb Raider sequel is the next chapter of Laura's development.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Her life is changing. She can't go back to the way she was.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:47.000
It seemed to recall they did announce the sequel after there was the whole, like,

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.000
there was the comic book that was being made and the comic book maker mentioned something.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000
So it kind of led to this.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.000
But anyway, then a question was asked by the audience about, you know,

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Square Enix had called the game a failure earlier this year,

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.000
which many of us looked at that and went, You guys smoking crap?

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Because Tomb Raider is kind of awesome and it sold millions.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
So what do you mean it's a failure?

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Well, the reply from Brian Horton was, quote,

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.000
We don't talk about our budgets. It's a well-financed game.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.000
We're not spending any more on a sequel than on the original game.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.000
So I wouldn't take well-financed to mean like, Oh, they're just throwing money at it.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000
I think I would just take that to mean, Don't worry.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000
The game will come out and it will be like they're not going to cut corners.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.000
And, you know, it's going to be a crappy quality because of that.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
I think that's what they're trying to reassure people of.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000
So, um, the Tomb Raider reboot was great.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:37.000
And I think if the sequel can kind of capture that magic, uh, I'm looking forward to it.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000
I would be interested in this. So I'm looking forward to the reveal.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000
I'm curious to see what they do with her now, because obviously the first one was,

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.000
was all kinds of scary and really had that like caves environment and all that.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.000
So I'm curious, are they going to now do the whole like exotic worlds and that like,

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
will that be the, she'll become a pirate.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.000
It'll be just like Assassin's Creed four or, or well charted Lara Croft edition,

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000
or will it still be like super scary and, and the whole, like, you know,

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:09.000
as, as Jamie calls it on the show, the game called girl,

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:15.000
you know, will the sequel be girl who knows girl.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.000
All right. So we'll see what happens with the two Raiders sequel, but, um,

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.000
they're, they're trying to reassure us.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.000
It's taken care of and, and don't you worry.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000
You'll be hearing more on it soon. All right. Uh,

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.000
let's get to the classic game of the week because as you know,

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
every week here on orange lounge radio,

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000
we asked stark soccer to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that she

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.000
thinks, Hey, you ungrateful brats,

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.000
put down your Xbox one and your PlayStation four and we use and go check out a

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000
real classic this week. Yeah.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Definitely put that shit down. You don't even need a reason to put that out.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Yeah. All right. But dark soccer is not here tonight. So, uh, we invited, uh,

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Jason to pick this week cause Jason's never got to pick the classic in the

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.000
week. I guess I can. You've done a lot for the show over the years.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
So we kind of view this as a, a, a,

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000
a present of sorts that you can pick the game of the week this week.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000
So Jason,

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000
what have you picked tonight for the classic game of the week tonight?

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.000
I picked vets by spectrum Holobytes.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
All right. And I just going to warn,

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
I'm going to warn people right off.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000
That is the noise with this game.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
It uses like PC speaker, right?

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Only PC speaker.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.000
PC speaker.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:33.000
So there's not a lot of music with this and it's a lot of incidental break

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.000
squeaks. So, but I will, as I always do,

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
let the music play in the background, whatever it is.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:44.000
So it is quite literally just a break squeals and a police sirens.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
And yeah. Anyways, here you go.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Developed by sphere and published by spectrum Holobyte.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000
First and foremost,

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:55.000
I will say that this game is spelled V E T T E vet as in short for Corvette.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
It is an with an exclamation point with an exclamation.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Don't forget about that.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:03.000
That is an incredibly early and incredibly crude race in simulation game.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:06.000
It was originally released in 1989 coming,

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:10.000
coming out on IBM PCs running MS-DOS and Macintosh computers.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.000
It is set in San Francisco. It features terrain,

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000
notable landmarks,

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:21.000
high speed racing across all of the upper peninsula of San Francisco.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.000
It'll take you to landmarks anywhere from the San Francisco zoo across both

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:28.000
bridges and plenty of notable landmarks in between.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.000
This game is 100% a relic of times past.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.000
When the game starts,

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000
you have to answer a question based off details in the instruction manual in

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.000
order to play the game.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:41.000
It asks you things like specific tuning parameters of,

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
I think it's all actually Corvettes.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
There may be the European sports cars too in there.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000
I don't entirely remember.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.000
It was a long time ago when I played it.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Um, what's really fun about this game is that if you do,

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
if you answer the question incorrectly,

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
you get all the way to the start of the race.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
And as soon as go is waived,

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:04.000
a police siren is heard and you are arrested in game for driving a stolen vet.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
That's funny. That's great. I like that.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Just the, Oh man.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Can I just say quickly though,

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.000
it always blows me away how all these racing games are set in San Francisco,

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000
which I get to an extent, you know, you have the landmarks and,

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000
and the Hills of San Francisco make it interesting and everything,

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.000
but just as somebody who drives a lot in San Francisco, um,

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:27.000
real racing in San Francisco is being stuck in traffic all fucking day.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
You don't race in San Francisco.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
There's too many cars.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:34.000
You race to make it down five miles on the one-on-one in like 30 minutes when

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
you're already late for your appointment.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
And heaven help you if Bart is striking.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.000
As, as I learned when I came into town last time.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Yes.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Yes. 100% correct.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Uh, the core of the game, it is a racing game.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
You pick one of four types of Corvettes,

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000
age appropriate and choose one of four European sports cars as your opponent.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Uh, one of the four, there are four key destinations to race.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:02.000
The fourth being a worldwide tour encompassing the three previous levels.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:07.000
And despite the display of American Corvette dickwagging,

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:10.000
the funnier part of this game is that if you lose to your opponent,

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.000
one of the most often messages you get is don't feel bad.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000
I programmed this game.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.000
So apparently the developers may have been more in love with the European

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
sports cars in the Corvette. I don't know.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.000
It's a very, it's very interesting mix of cultures there.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Um, there are degrees of difficulty and realism on the easiest mode called

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
trainee. There will be no car damage.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Police will not be a factor.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Uh, turns will be tight and cruise control will just be full speed at all

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
times. Even if you collide with something,

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.000
you will instantly go back up to your cruise control speed.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:44.000
When the object moves out of your way. Yes, there are collisions.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:49.000
There are damage. There is realism to the extent you can call it for 1989.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Um, as you increase in difficulty,

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.000
these various options will start becoming more and more realistic.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:59.000
If you speed go down the wrong way, uh, go down a one way street,

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
the wrong way. Um, uh,

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Oh, Hey, look at that Bay bridge.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:08.000
That's the golden gate bridge lights and police will start to pursue you.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.000
You will get pulled over and you will even have to give your excuse to the

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:16.000
officer before he writes you a citation. There is even manslaughter.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.000
There are characters in the city of San Francisco that you can run into and

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:25.000
they go from a standing crude Sprite to a flattened crude Sprite.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Um, the pro difficulty level turns all of these on, on full realism,

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:33.000
damage, traction, police, and cruise control are all said to be realistic.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Pretty convincingly too, I will say. Um, Oh, and by the way,

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.000
your opponent is immune to all of this and is damn fast.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:44.000
He's incredibly frustrating. This game was oodles of fun for me when I was,

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:47.000
uh, well it came out when I was four,

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:50.000
but I'm sure I was playing it more when I was five, six or seven.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:54.000
And despite how crude it is, there's just something colorful,

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:57.000
wonderful, fun, defined, and really,

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
really incredibly interesting about this game.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Yeah. When you look at these old racing games, you're kind of like, wow,

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:07.000
this looks like shit. But I mean, at the time this is, I mean,

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.000
you think, I think of an Epic game, like what was that? Not hard drive in,

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
but what was the sequel? The stunt racing one where you do,

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.000
or was it hard drive in?

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Are you thinking the big sitting cabinet?

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Was it maybe stunts? Yeah.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Where you would go over the loop and all that shit like that game looks like

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.000
utter garbage now. But back in the day,

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000
we were plunking down a dollar because dude, you could drive around a loop.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:34.000
And we loved it. And it's VR realness.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Test drive three, man.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
So anyway, sorry, Jason.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:44.000
This game, this game is as zany as it is shockingly deep to the point that it

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
can actually represent it. If you don't want to race,

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.000
there's also a tour mode,

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:50.000
which will immediately warp you to time period appropriate landmarks,

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.000
the Coit tower, the ferry building, Fisherman's wharf and the piers,

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
the trans America pyramid. Yup.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:59.000
And of course Lombard street and all of its glory completely represented in

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.000
this game.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:04.000
The kicker of this game is that there's a lot of crude and silly elements.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Like for example,

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.000
I'm staring at the video right now and there's a gear there's there's a

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:11.000
shifter. There's the gear box. No,

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:15.000
there's the shifter with the character's hand on it. And the,

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:19.000
and the gear is represented by a little notch in, you know,

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:22.000
one is top left, two is bottom left, et cetera, et cetera.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
But the hand never moves.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:29.000
There's just this little switch that goes through the image YouTube for vet.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
You'll see what I'm talking about. Automatic or manual.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
You can do it both. Um, the,

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.000
the kicker of all this game and we were talking about this before with Atari

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:41.000
and everything else. This game was less than one megabyte in size,

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:47.000
one single floppy disk for the whole of the upper peninsula.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.000
And yeah, these objects are crude, but they're fricking 3d standing objects.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:55.000
This game actually does have terrain. So you actually go sloped roads.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:58.000
The background images are cute. There's a,

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:02.000
there were some serious polygons on that golden gate bridge.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:06.000
It's amazing the objects that they put together to make this game for less

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:10.000
than one megabyte, completely astounding.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
All right, there it is.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:17.000
There it is a look into racing games on the PCs passed with the classic game

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:20.000
of the week vet. All right, there it is.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:23.000
That's vet with an explanation point, not like, you know,

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.000
my first pet vet. Yeah. Or something like that.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.000
My first pet accident.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Hey, there it is. Uh, thank you very much, Jason. That was a good pick.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:34.000
You know what? Because I like hearing about games that like I would have never

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.000
looked up otherwise. And considering that I did play a lot of old school games,

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:40.000
I'd actually never heard of this game. So you, you stumped me on that one.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Good job, Jason. All right. That does it for part a,

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
but we have plenty more show to come after a quick break.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
We have a rapid fire news coming at you.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:52.000
The focal question of the week talking about sales and frugal gaming news about

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
current racing games. So, uh,

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:57.000
going from a classic racer to things like fours of five and Gran Turismo six,

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.000
your emails, your calls at one eight seven seven game,

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:05.000
O L R and plenty more when we come back with more of orange lounge radio.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live on this Sunday night,

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:22.000
November the 24th of 2013 with our 528th episode already in progress.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.000
We've had a heck of a show so far tonight. Yeah. Jason's joining us here.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:29.000
If you are just joining us live, dark soccer out for the night,

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.000
she had a prior engagement,

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:35.000
a family affair as those things tend to happen this time of year and a real

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:39.000
quickly since you know, Thanksgiving week is this coming week here in America.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.000
I just want to wish all of our listeners who are celebrating Thanksgiving this

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000
coming week. I want to wish you all a happy Thanksgiving. Uh, and you know,

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.000
we here at orange launch radio, as cheesy as this sounds,

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.000
we really are thankful for all of you guys who take the time out of your day to

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:54.000
listen. Those of you that participate with the show here live on Sunday nights.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Uh, those of you that listen, uh, via the podcast,

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.000
those of you that leave comments at vog network.com, those of you that email,

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:03.000
those of you that leave the kind reviews on iTunes and Stitcher and all that.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:06.000
We just really appreciate you guys. Thank you for being a part of the community.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.000
You are our motivation. That is why we've been here for the past. God,

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:13.000
how long has it been? 11 plus years at this point. I have lost count.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.000
It has hit that point. I have lost count of how many episodes we've had,

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:20.000
but since, since June of 2002, we've been here at orange launch radio.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.000
We are thankful for you guys. You keep us going. So a happy Thanksgiving to all

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
you out there. And if you aren't in America, you know,

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:30.000
you're Canadian or you're, you're British or Australian or from another country

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.000
that doesn't have Thanksgiving this week, then I will say, enjoy your week,

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:39.000
making fun of us and our black Friday mania and all that crap.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.000
So enjoy your week, making fun of us for all of that. Uh, we,

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:45.000
we deserve it quite frankly. Um,

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
but I'm hoping for some good deals come cyber Monday.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
I'm crossing my fingers and my toes. Maybe I can get,

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:53.000
maybe I can get Diablo three on PlayStation three at a steel price on cyber

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Monday. And because I'm certainly not braving those crowds on black Friday.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
I will say this. I have gone out on black Friday,

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000
like late at night and it's just like any other day. Like if you,

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.000
if you go at like seven or eight o'clock at night to target or whatever,

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.000
it's just like any other day because all the, all the crazies are done.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.000
They went to bed, all the,

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:15.000
all the TVs for 99 bucks or whatever crazy shit's going on.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:18.000
They're all long since sold out. So nobody's around for those anymore. So, uh,

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
black Friday is not so bad in that regard,

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.000
which is good because sometimes I realize I need toothpaste and then, Oh shit,

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:29.000
I don't want to be anywhere near a store on black Friday, but there you go.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.000
All right.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:34.000
I'm just hoping there's been enough pushback that stores don't make a habit of

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:38.000
actually being open on Thanksgiving night. Like prior to midnight Fridays,

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Fridays rough and you know, the five,

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000
the 4am starts and the midnight starts and all that kind of crap is, is rough.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:48.000
But at least it's on Friday. People that have companies that have talked about

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
being open on Thanksgiving night, like eight o'clock,

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:53.000
8pm or some nonsense like that.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:59.000
I seriously hope that that is not prolific and does not trend in future years.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Not to deviate too much from the topic of video games,

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.000
but since a lot of video games are on sale during this special period,

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000
we'll go into this a little bit. But, um, you know,

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
I do kind of understand both sides of it is that, you know, there,

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:12.000
if the audience wasn't there for it, they wouldn't do it.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.000
And they do have to get the particular sales and all that. You know,

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.000
I do to some extent understand that, you know,

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:23.000
and that is what you sign up for where you work at when you work in retail.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:27.000
And there is other industries like policemen don't get the day off.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Firefighters don't get the day off. You know, it just,

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:32.000
sometimes it comes with the territory. I'm not defending it totally.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
I'm just trying to look at both sides.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:35.000
I'm going to tell you what I don't like about it.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:39.000
This is why I don't like about it is that it's starting to eclipse Thanksgiving.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
And that's that, no, no, no, no, no.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
We do not get two days off of work to celebrate Black Friday.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:46.000
And that's starting to be what it's becoming.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:49.000
And that's the part that gets me more than anything is well,

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:52.000
we're starting to eclipse Thanksgiving. And you know, that's,

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:56.000
that's where things get a little, little, I don't like it for me,

01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:00.000
but you know, there's a lot of places that don't,

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
hospitals don't stop running on Thanksgiving.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:06.000
So let's give thanks to those folks that, you know,

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
work hard when the rest of us have a day off.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
And then deal with the trampling crazies the day afterwards.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Yeah. Yeah. No kidding.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Four hours. Not even 24 hours goes by before that stuff happens.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Yeah. So, all right. Let's move on.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Let's get back into some rapid fire news.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Get back to what the games are all about. Loki.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Yes. So there was a lot of Persona announcements after, you know,

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
a countdown. And I kind of, it was funny,

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
they had some videos that go along with it.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Trolling, you know, Persona fans,

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.000
you know, they had a video with this old woman that was announcing something.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.000
And they had a trailer in the background of, you know,

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
it playing in Akibahara.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:49.000
And you couldn't see it because her head was in the way.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
On purpose.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Anyways, Persona 5 announced for PlayStation 3.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:57.000
I'm assuming coming out, it says Winter 2014.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:00.000
So, pretty soon.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Persona Q, Shadow of the Labyrinth.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:07.000
That's coming out on 3DS, was that?

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Yeah, 3DS. So it's supposed to be June 5th in Japan.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:15.000
So, probably sometime during the summer in North America.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Persona, or P4U, Persona 4,

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:23.000
the Ultimax Ultra Suplex hold on PS3.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:27.000
That is going to be a follow up to Persona 4 Arena.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:31.000
And then there's Persona 4,

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Dancing All Night.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
That's going to be coming to Vita.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
And it's supposed to be a music game.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
A rhythm action game, I guess.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Oh, that should be fun.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Yes, and that's coming Autumn of 2014.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
So, lots of Persona for you.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Persona fans, still not satisfied.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Even though that's probably like, literally 5,000 hours of gameplay.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
No, I'm teasing, obviously.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
But no, that is exciting.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Considering the lack of good games based on this franchise,

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Game of Thrones is going to be getting a brand new series of games,

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.000
or at least a game, from Telltale.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
And that's pretty awesome.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
There's no way it will be less than one game.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
This will be a series like everything else.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:20.000
So, I don't know, I think it's pretty awesome.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Because I know they've had the strategy game, which is alright,

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:28.000
and then they had that Game of Thrones game that came out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:29.000
It was kind of lame.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:32.000
But, can't go wrong with Telltale.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
There's no way they can fuck that up.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Well, I'm just going to say this,

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:39.000
as much as I agree, and Telltale's put out a lot of quality stuff,

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:42.000
I'm a little sad that that King's Quest thing didn't happen.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
That's a little irritating.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
I was really looking forward to the Telltale King's Quest game,

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:49.000
so the fact that that kind of didn't happen is sad.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
But, yay, Game of Thrones, I guess.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:56.000
I'm totally using this story as an excuse to bitch about King's Quest not happening.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
I'm sorry, but I had to.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Well, I would think probably Activision's going to be at fault there.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Because, you know, they're the ones that have the license, don't they?

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Um, yeah, but, you know, fuck them.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.000
What are they going to do with it?

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Treyarch, first person shooter, King's Quest.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
I'd still play that, but yeah.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Argh.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
No idea.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:26.000
And then, of course, you know, not a huge...

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:30.000
I guess it's sort of a surprise that John Carmack is leaving id Software.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.000
And I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that, you know,

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:39.000
he's working with the Oculus folks as their chief technology officer.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:46.000
And I'm not sure what else he's doing, but he is resigning.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:51.000
And he's been at the company for 17 years, but it's too bad.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:54.000
That seems short for some reason.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Was that...?

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:58.000
17 puts it back to 1996.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
But didn't...

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:04.000
That was like, after Doom and everything, wasn't he there for...?

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.000
I thought so too.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
I think I'm just fucking up my id Software history.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Maybe.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:15.000
My question is, though, is that why Rage was on sale this weekend?

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Your golden parachute is made up of the sales of this game.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Oculus Rift, though.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Jason, have you played Oculus Rift?

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:22.000
I have.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Oh, and I didn't mention that.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Since I got back into town, if I didn't mention this,

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:29.000
I don't remember when I actually played it,

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:32.000
so I may or may not have mentioned it last time I was on the show,

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:35.000
but I've been wanting to get my hands on an Oculus Rift,

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
not out of my own pocket.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:41.000
There is an Oculus Rift at the office, owned by a coworker of mine,

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:45.000
that leaves it there because he and a friend of his sometimes stay late

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.000
and do, you know, hack on 3D projects and that kind of stuff.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:50.000
I don't know if I have...

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Hack on 3D projects, play 3D pornography games, you know.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:57.000
Well, play 3D games, most definitely.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.000
I won't doubt that one.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Anything else?

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Well, that's a whole other discussion.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Just remember what the Internet's for, Jason.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:09.000
But I do have A for the Awesome, R for the Awesome,

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
and I have played that in Oculus mode.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:15.000
And with the exception of one level that had a really, really weird visual bug

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.000
where the sky was, like, bleeding out,

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:23.000
the backdrop of the ground was bleeding out a lot of the buildings and whatnot,

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:26.000
that game is fucking fantastic with the Oculus Rift.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Oh, my dear sweet God.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.000
I love that game just in general, but having...

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:35.000
You know, there's contention about which display mode to use with the Oculus Rift,

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:39.000
whether head tracking should be where your aiming is.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.000
I don't think so.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Other people do whatever.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.000
That's what the choice is for.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:46.000
But for, you know, the skydiving simulator in a freaking Oculus Rift,

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:49.000
oh, my God, that is so much fun.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Absolutely love it.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:54.000
I love the Oculus Rift, too.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.000
That demo that Bobby gave me at Dragon Con was pretty awesome.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.000
I'm excited to see some more, you know, game development talent go over there,

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:03.000
because obviously you have a lot of concepts on Rift right now

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
and a lot of really cool demos,

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:09.000
but to hear that there could be some great games that come out of that,

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
it's good news.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:16.000
I've been two weeks ago,

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
also obviously still when I was in San Francisco,

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:21.000
because that's where the Rift is, like I said.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:24.000
A couple of coworkers stayed late,

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:27.000
and one individual was demoing it to other people,

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:30.000
and it was kind of funny because one of them didn't understand

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
that it was head tracking and not, like,

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
she said afterwards that she thought it was, like,

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
augmented reality or something like that,

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.000
that she'd be able to see through.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:40.000
So when somebody else is playing, she would go up and,

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
hey, hey, wave on the other side of the Rift,

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:45.000
and we're like, it doesn't work that way.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
She can't see you.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
And then when she actually put it on,

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
she still had that mentality,

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:54.000
and so she was doing the Italy house demo,

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
if you saw just the basic FPS.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
I did, yeah.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:01.000
And so there were, like, wispy things in the air,

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:04.000
like the torches would let out those little quick flames.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:07.000
I think she said butterflies and maybe even leaves.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
I actually kind of don't remember it myself.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:12.000
But she was walking around, and she would, you know,

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
she would wave her arm at him, and she would flick,

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.000
she would try to hit him,

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:23.000
and obviously nothing happened except for adjusted angle

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
and viewing.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:29.000
But afterwards, after they had both understood

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
what was actually going on, they were like,

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
yeah, that's cool, but what about immersion?

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
And so I just kind of turned to them, and I said,

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:39.000
well, that's what the treadmill attachment is for

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:42.000
that was demoed at PAX so that you can actually,

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.000
you have a game pad or some other joystick in hand,

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:49.000
you have the Oculus on your head, and then you suit yourself,

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
you strap yourself in, and you start walking on a treadmill,

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:55.000
and that's as close to immersion as you're going to get

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
until the holodeck comes.

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.000
We've got to watch the Oculus Rift talk,

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
or we're going to be the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:01.000
So love you, Bobby.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Honestly, TLDR, amazing, as always.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
Honestly, if the Oculus Rift was a new console

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
that was coming out in November,

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
that would probably be more exciting than some,

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
see, that at least has a hook.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:12.000
That's a new way to play games.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:15.000
It's kind of a push forward in technology

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:18.000
other than game console with better specs.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
That's fucking PC with better specs.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.000
I mean, come on.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:24.000
That is something that has a little bit more of a hook.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Interesting way to look at it.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
To register participation for this week's episode

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
use the passphrase, illegal.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
All right, let's move on with some more rapid-fire news, though,

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:37.000
including, here's another story about fucking Twitch,

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.000
but it's about Minecraft,

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:43.000
which that's a game that won't die in a community that won't die,

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:44.000
and with good reason.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:45.000
I'm not saying it should.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:46.000
And Oculus support.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:47.000
And does it have Oculus?

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Of course it does.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:49.000
Why am I even asking?

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Of course it has Oculus support.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
But anyway, one-click Twitch streaming

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:57.000
is now coming to the PC and Mac versions of Minecraft.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:00.000
I know Path of Exile, which is a game I played not that long ago,

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:01.000
has this as well.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
You're starting to see this built into the game.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
You don't even need open broadcast software

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
or any of those programs to stream.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
You just click in the game and there you go.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.000
This was kind of outlined at MineCon recently,

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:15.000
but now in Minecraft you do a quick visit

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
to enable streaming in the account settings.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
All you have to do, press F6, there you go.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:22.000
And if you need to walk through the features,

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:23.000
that's available, of course, on YouTube,

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:26.000
because, you know, people can stream and then archive to YouTube.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.000
That's that.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
So many more Minecraft streams to come.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:33.000
The creators of Minecraft, very good about,

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:39.000
they do not try to enforce copyrights on any of their stuff

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:40.000
on Twitch or YouTube or any of that.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
They're like, go forth and mine.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
It's just make all the Minecraft stuff you want.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:47.000
And of course, Hunger Games, Minecraft, YouTube,

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
they're everywhere.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Those are huge.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:51.000
They look fun.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
I just never could find something to join in with.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
I wish we could do one of those, but I know.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
We could, but it's a lot of work.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
They have a script for it.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:02.000
I want to play Final Fantasy XIV and World of Warcraft.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Moving on, I want to play A Legend of Zelda,

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
A Link Between Worlds.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
And now that I've registered it to my club Nintendo account,

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:12.000
maybe I can get these rewards, which is pretty neat.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:17.000
Three posters based on the game is a new club Nintendo reward.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
They measure 22 by 28.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:22.000
And I don't know if these are a limited time deal or what have you.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:25.000
It costs 500 coins if you want these posters.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
So there you go.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
By the way, you can also get A Legend of Zelda,

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:33.000
A Link to the Past for 150 coins for the Wii Virtual Console,

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:36.000
because it's not out on Wii U yet,

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
but I'm sure it will be before too long.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:41.000
In fact, I haven't looked at what Virtual Console games came out for Wii U recently,

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:45.000
but there was a lot of, let's just say, scraping the bottom of the barrel,

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:49.000
some of the really old Nintendo launch titles that people don't care about anymore,

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:50.000
like Clu Clu Land.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Sorry fans of Clu Clu Land, but let's be real, no one cur,

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:57.000
but that's been what some of the Virtual Console releases have been lately.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:02.000
The next gen console wars did continue in South Park.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
We talked about this a little bit last week,

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
when the first half of South Park aired.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Well, sure enough, it was a two-part episode,

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
and the second half did air this week.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:13.000
It was the continued story of Black Friday.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:18.000
A Song of Ass and Fire apparently was the name of the episodes.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Go figure.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
And there you go.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
They are dressed in a little bit of product placement.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:26.000
The characters of South Park were dressed up like the characters in the RPG,

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:29.000
which is coming out now March of 2014.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:32.000
A lot of people talking about the Princess Kenny anime intro.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:35.000
I'm gonna be honest, I didn't watch this week's yet.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:36.000
It's pretty funny.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:37.000
I plum forgot.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
Who won the console war in the end?

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Spoilers.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:43.000
I didn't watch it, but I saw that sequence, so I watched it on YouTube.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:44.000
God dammit.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Probably better we don't answer that for spoilers.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:46.000
Yeah, I guess that's true.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:47.000
For spoilers, some people are gonna be like,

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
your shows spoil things.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Alright, let's move on.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:52.000
Jason, what do you have for us?

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Alright.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:57.000
Polyphony Digital are attempting to do the impossible.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Release a Gran Turismo in a timely manner.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:04.000
The best case scenario will be that Gran Turismo 7 will come out next year,

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:07.000
with Gran Turismo 6 finally releasing on December 6th.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:10.000
But that is the best case, and things get bumped,

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:14.000
and new generation, and new consoles, and feasibility.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Well, you know, we'll see.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:22.000
This is considerably impressive considering that the wait between Gran Turismo 5 and 6

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:26.000
was three years, and the wait between 4 and 5 was nearly six years.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:30.000
Best of luck to them, and especially making it look completely awesome

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:35.000
on modern...modern consoles, I say, as they just came out this week.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Hello.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:42.000
Three PS1 games are available for free on a PlayStation Home scavenger hunt.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.000
It's a short little 13-hidden card minigame in Home.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.000
Shouldn't take you more than 10, 20 minutes tops,

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:52.000
but the games are Twisted Metal, Warhawk, and Destruction Derby,

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:58.000
which are frickin' great titles to add to your collection, so why not?

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:04.000
And lastly, Strider 2014, the reboot, will also include the original version,

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Strider 1 and 2, the PS1 versions rather, not Arcade or anything like that.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Strider 2014 is slated to be released on February 22nd,

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:19.000
will include the first two. Get your history on and enjoy these games.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:22.000
Oh, I lied, it's not just PlayStation 4, I'm crazy.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:28.000
Strider 2014 is going to be on PC, Xbox 360, and Xbox One.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
When's that out? I missed the date.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
February 22.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.000
Yay, there's something to look forward to in that early window.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
I totally forgot one of the games I played this week.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:40.000
I'll have to name it next week. It's alright.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
There was a download game I totally played earlier this week.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:46.000
I spent an entire night playing it, and then it was like, oh, new games to play.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:50.000
I do that way too much, but I would just say the download games really help bridge the gap.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Alrighty, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:04.000
Every week here, we take Facebook and Google+, slam it together, you get FUGL.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Let's get to the question of the week.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:14.000
And I will read some of the answers from Facebook and Google+, because we are running a little long tonight. Sorry, guys.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Where the hell are the posts on Google+, I can't see them.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Alright, fine, we'll go to Facebook first.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:27.000
For some reason, my computer is running so slow too. I'm sorry if it's causing the feed to skip.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:31.000
Also, all the account madness that we did earlier today may have been a factor in this.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
That very well could be, who knows.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:36.000
Well, I had to get the YouTube channel back. We haven't posted to it for like four years.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Alright, anyway, here we go, the FUGL question of the week.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Brace yourselves, holiday shopping season is coming.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Are there any holiday gaming deals you plan to pick up over the next few weeks?

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Do you typically wait for games to go on sale before buying them, or does the desire to play them right away usually win out?

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:56.000
So let's go to some of the answers from Facebook.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Redthehay says, I plan to buy older games online or at the store that are usually under $10.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:09.000
It depends on the game. If it's a single-player game I really, really want, or something I can play with my regular online buddies, or a mix of both like Grand Theft Auto 5, I usually get it at launch.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Forthefallendreams says, Cyber Monday sales rule because it can wait and come to me, dammit.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Murica!

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Andy R. says, the desire to play right away wins out almost all the time.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:26.000
That and pre-order bonuses, stupid as they sometimes are.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:34.000
I'll probably still take a look at the deals coming up, but buying a PlayStation 4 last week and a 3DS a couple months ago means I'm holding off on spending too much at the moment.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Daniel S. says, there aren't any specific games I want to buy per se, but if they're a really good deal on something I'll snatch it up.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:50.000
Those are usually Steam sales, but outlets have been known to clear their inventory of large collector's edition boxes.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Ooh, that's really true.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:08:00.000
DJ Synthetic says, I'm just hoping for a purple 3DS bundle type thing. I need to start playing something not Call of Duty Ghosts.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:10.000
DJ Rama S. says, Gamestop has some sweet deals I plan to pick up. I do try to wait for games to go on sale, but on the same token I'm in no rush to play a lot of the games that are coming out.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:14.000
So by the time I get that game it's usually under $30. Score!

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:18.000
Alright, now going over to Google+, now that it's loaded, let's look at just a few comments over there.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Act Def says, I already jumped the gun on getting a Zelda Wind Waker Wii U on the Mexican version of Black Friday, which is El Buen Fin, or The Great Weekend.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:30.000
I did not know that was a thing. I learned something tonight.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Tech 2030 says, even though I just bought a Playstation 4, if there is a killer Black Friday deal for a Wii U, I'll probably pull the trigger on that one.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:43.000
It's killing me that I'm not playing Super Mario 3D World in Wind Waker HD already.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:50.000
And lastly, Sam H. says, Xbox Live and Playstation Plus 12 month subcards for $30 at Gamestop.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
That's right, Rob. I'm going to Gamestop.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Well, you know what, I can't really blame you for that, Sam, though. That's a pretty good deal.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:01.000
Even I want to go get the Playstation Plus card at that rate, because it's a really good deal.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Those are some of the answers from our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
By all means, please go read the rest of them.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:24.000
How about you guys? I think we might have dabbled into this a little bit, but do you have any Black Friday, Cyber Monday deals you guys are looking into?

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:28.000
I already mentioned Diablo 3 as something I want to grab if I can get it dirt cheap.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:31.000
I'm not paying $60 for a game I already have for free.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:34.000
But for the console version, yeah, I'm tempted.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:35.000
Jason?

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Invariably, Steam's going to have something that's interesting. I have a pretty big wish list.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:44.000
But specifically, I just haven't had the time to even consider this kind of stuff.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Not to mention all of the... not that the newest things are going to be too deeply discounted, but I have exactly none of the newer consoles.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:54.000
And so those are saving for those as higher up on my radar.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:59.000
Something Steam, it'll happen. Other than that, ask me next year.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
Loki?

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:08.000
No. Unless there's something on Steam that I have to have, which I say there probably isn't going to be, but you never know.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:13.000
There always will be. There's some indie title that wasn't on your radar that will be eventually.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Splunkies! I know one I really want to get that I just haven't... I'm sure the minute that goes on a deep Steam sale, it'll be mine.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:26.000
I forgot about Steam sales, Jason, you're right. That's gonna hurt. It's gonna hurt this year.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:29.000
You already said it once in this episode. Winter is coming. That can only mean one thing.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
That's right. Steam sale!

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:39.000
I still haven't even picked up Bioshock Infinite, even though they had it for like $11 for all three games.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Bioshock 1, 2, and Infinite.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Ooh, I gotta get that too. That's a good point.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
So it'll be like five bucks by the time.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:53.000
Alright, let's move on with some other news, and then we'll get to the mailbag, the FUs of the Week, and all that other good stuff. Loki?

02:10:53.000 --> 02:11:05.000
So Fours of Five. Fours of Five, as people realize once they purchase a game, has a bit of a monetization business model to it.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Granted, you can play the game and unlock stuff, or you can buy some tokens.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:20.000
And the tokens, their pricing model for the tokens is really stupid, actually, because they have different bundles you can get.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:24.000
And you usually think, oh, I'm buying more so I get a better deal on it.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:27.000
It's actually the opposite. If you buy less, you get a better deal on it.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:33.000
But they have, I guess they were talking about different cars and stuff.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:46.000
For example, if you were to buy the McLaren or something like that, the P1, the cost of that, the token pack, they're saying, well, this is all in Euros, of course.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:53.000
So they're saying $15.99 would be, I guess it would cover both of those cars.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:12:00.000
100 is like 79 Euro? I don't know what that is over here. I think it's like 89 cents over here.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:04.000
79 Euros is $107.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:08.000
I'm sorry, .79 Euros, not 79 Euros.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Yeah, $1.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
So about a dollar.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:22.000
So basically, I think they did the same thing with Real Driving 3 when that came out or something, where they added it all together.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:29.000
I want to say it was like $2,200 is what they came up with as far as what's going to cost.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Oh, here we go. Token costs in the US.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
So 100 tokens runs you 99 cents.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:39.000
If you want 325 tokens, it's going to run you $5.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:43.000
Yes, you heard correctly, 325 tokens is $5.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:49.000
Whereas if I spent $5 on the 100 tokens, I get 500 tokens because that makes fucking sense.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
Thanks for letting me bundle easily, guys.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:54.000
$575 is $10.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Let me throw this out there because the chat's being a little adamant about this point.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:01.000
ActDeft in chat at live.vognetwork.com. First, I love this.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:06.000
BlackWolf at live.vognetwork.com says, the monetization ain't as bad as whatever Loki's about to say.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:13.000
And then ActDeft said, monetization as in buying tokens and credits, those exist since fours of three.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:17.000
I seriously don't know why people are making a big fuzz about this monetization thing.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:24.000
I do think in some extent it is an opportunity for people to pounce on a new system and,

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:27.000
oh my God, this is the route we're going down.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:32.000
I think it's because this game has half the cars that the last game had is more like it.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:35.000
And that they're offering, oh, you can get more cars than DLC.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:41.000
Yes, I understand that's because the cars are modeled in higher resolution or whatever excuse they want to use.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:49.000
But it's a little shady when you're buying a system for $500 and then you're buying a game for $60.

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:54.000
And then they are saying, hey, you know what, you can also buy some cars too if you want to spend another $100 on it.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:14:04.000
I kind of think that's where it's at is that people have hit their saturation point with seeing the freemium model in the premium games.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:09.000
And I kind of just think the reason why this is all catching fire and you're seeing it,

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:15.000
it's not like we're the first ones to get out there and make it sound like it's all new because there's a lot of gaming blogs that are running this,

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:20.000
like it's Xbox One poison. You know you guys have read that out there somewhere.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:26.000
I think it's because people are just hitting their saturation point where it's like, okay, stop injecting freemium models into premium games.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:29.000
It's not, yeah, I don't have a problem with it being on this game.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:33.000
I have a problem with it being on any game that you're paying retail price for.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:39.000
If it's a free-to-play game, okay, fine. That's fine because they've got to make their money somehow.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:45.000
But you've already made your money selling me this game and now you're saying, oh, well, we need more money.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:53.000
Like for example, they were saying, though, that I guess one of the cars was like $100.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Yeah, okay, so they had the Lotus E21 is 6 million credits or 10,000 tokens.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:14.000
So yes, 10,000 tokens would be $100 in real money if you wanted to just buy the car and not play the game to unlock those tokens or whatever, or credits.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:22.000
That's kind of lame. I mean, fuck, I thought it was kind of lame in Forza Horizon where they had the shit you could unlock for tokens.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:31.000
So I think it's lame everywhere. And come on, this is ridiculous. There's no excuse that this needs to be in there.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:39.000
And I hate when the developers or publishers go, but the people wanted it. It's like, no one fucking wants it.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Yeah, I remember a day when UpUpDownDownLeftRightLeftRightBA Start gave me all that shit.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:51.000
But I will say, at least in the case of Forza Horizon, I still love that game an awful lot.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:57.000
So it's not like this ruins the game per se, and I haven't played Forza 5 so I can't speak to it, but I have played Forza Horizon a lot.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:03.000
It didn't ruin the game per se, but it's just one of those things where you kind of, you just, it's a disappointing sigh.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:07.000
I guess it's really the only way I can phrase it. Anyway.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Alright, let's move on. By the way, if you think this is specific to Xbox and Forza, you would be incorrect.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:25.000
Why? Because Gran Turismo 6 on the PlayStation 3, not 4, 3, will also have a system for in-game microtransactions.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:30.000
So again, this isn't something you can really pick on Forza specifically.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:36.000
This is just people starting to kind of hit their point where, you know, I've had it officially with these.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:45.000
So, purchasable as credits from PlayStation Network and physical retailers, you can get in-game credits to get vehicles, parts, and related accessories.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:55.000
We don't know exactly how much this is going to be in the game and so forth, but it sounds like almost the exact same model that you see in Forza, also in Gran Turismo 6.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:17:01.000
Which will be launching early December, so you can see for yourself exactly if there's $100 cars to buy in this game as well.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:08.000
It's stupid that people even allow that, and unfortunately you're buying these games because they're good racing games, but at the same time, they're not putting the...

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:15.000
I mean, I guess the best advice you could say is just don't buy these, but I'm sure to some extent people are going to buy some of them.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:23.000
Because they want, oh, maybe not necessarily $100 for a car, but you know, maybe they want just extra money or something, I don't know.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:25.000
Alright.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:37.000
They have it in Grand Theft Auto. Grand Theft Auto 5 has where you can pay to get money online, and they keep nerfing all the fucking payouts on everything, so trying to convince people to spend money on that.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Dr. Tzuyu in chat says, I'd assume in Gran Turismo you can still earn credits the old-fashioned way. I'm also assuming that to be the case. It's almost identical to what we just talked about with Forza 5, it seems.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:58.000
So how long is it that we're going to get that fucking energy meter for these games, where, oh, my driver's tired now. He can't drive anymore for today.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
In this case, it'll be a gas tank.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:05.000
Unless they buy him some Mountain Dew, because they're going to have the product tie-in in there as well.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:14.000
Can you imagine if they came out with a new Gradius game, and you could no longer hit up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA, start, but you could for 99 cents?

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:18.000
No, you hit it, and then it pops up a little window saying in the marketplace, hey, do you wish to buy extra lines?

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:25.000
That's where us old curmungians get a little sad when we read news like this, just to put it in perspective.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Anyway, Jason, maybe you have some better news in the racing game world?

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:35.000
Wrapping up our trifecta of racing, Mario Kart Arcade Grand Prix Deluxe is confirmed for US release.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:49.000
It's been in Japan since the summer this year, and it will make its way to North America, well, rather, just outside Japan, winter 2013, so imminently in the next month for arcades that are actually going to make the investment.

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:56.000
It was also showcased at IAAPA, as was ReRave that we mentioned earlier in the show.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:08.000
A little bit of technical discussion about the fact that it can retrofit in existing cabinets, reuse Dead Heat, I believe it was called, Dead Heat Riders motorcycle game.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:21.000
Cute trailer video that also includes the Taiko Drum character from Taiko Netasigen, other various bits about what it's going to be powered by as far as the system internal.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:29.000
The really, really weird part about this article is that the author wrote this saying,

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:37.000
One thing we are also sure about is that this is not the same game as what Nintendo will be releasing for Wii U later that they are calling Mario Kart 8.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
Duh?

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:45.000
Grand Prix 1 and 2 were NOTHING like ANY existing Mario Kart game.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:49.000
Similar locales, but the active racing was NOTHING.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:57.000
I remember back in the day when you would have Crystal Castles in the arcade, Crystal Castles on the 2600, it's technically supposed to be a port of the arcade game.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:01.000
It's not uncommon to think that home versions of games are ports of the arcade game.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:04.000
So I can see why they're like, this is different than Mario Kart 8.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:17.000
In large part, we are so far removed from that, I don't know, it just struck me in the realization that these games are that different, that the Mario Kart arcade experience is that distinct.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:24.000
But it's just like, minus music games, what else has been similar console and arcade?

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:29.000
Time Crisis doesn't really exist in the console space anymore, so far as I know.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:37.000
Sadly, it's because the arcades are dying out. It's Super Street Fighter, but that's where the arcade game was almost based off the console.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:47.000
I guess the answer to this question is Hydro Thunder and H2 Overdrive and that kind of stuff that did show up on the Xbox 360 Marketplace.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
Xbox Live Arcade Marketplace, rather.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:55.000
Or a game I talked about a couple weeks ago on the show, Midway Arcade Origins, which is actual arcade ports of the emulators.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
From two decades ago, sure.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:00.000
ActDeafner in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com says,

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:04.000
The new arcade Mario Kart has Taiko Drum as a character. I want to play that. That sounds awesome.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
I said that. I said it was in the trailer.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
It's very cute. It's very awesome to see.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:16.000
This Nintendo Namco mutual happiness is really, really worthwhile.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:21.000
Dr. Tetsuya says, I played the first Mario Kart arcade game and it was fun. Would love to play the third one.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:22.000
So there you go.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:27.000
Yeah, I actually did too when I was in Arizona. Mesa Golf Land has...

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
They'll get it at Golf Land, whoopee.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:36.000
I believe it was Grand Prix 1. It was very old. The cameras were shot to hell. The display was a little dim.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:39.000
And it was also very, very easy, which was kind of weird.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:46.000
But yeah, for being completely original gameplay mechanics, Mario Kart Grand Prix Arcade is quite fun.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:49.000
If you happen to come across it, definitely check it out.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Alright, let's move on. Loki.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
It's also great for when you're drunk.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
During your bachelor party.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Is that one of the YouTubes on the Orange House video game? I think it is. I think it's still there.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:04.000
It's one of the few. I think that one still gets views. I should make ad money off that.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
You should. I get a portion though.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:10.000
We'll see. The show still runs. That's your portion.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:16.000
Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about NCAA game.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:25.000
Speaking of a publisher that's really having a karma sink or whatever, EA, holy shit.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:33.000
First, losing the NCAA game. Now, NBA Live.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:37.000
That game has been waiting to come out for years now.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:42.000
They retooled it, retooled it, and the reviews have been fucking terrible.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
It just looks terrible.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
They gotta be hurting over EA Sports.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:54.000
Anyways, NCAA. They have sued EA now over the Lightness settlement.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:23:05.000
And, you know, I guess the $40 million settlement that was going, I guess, to students.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:09.000
Our student athlete. Like this is in their legal dispute.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
Going back all the way to 2009.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:20.000
And, you know, of course, this is, I guess, regarding, they've not renewed the license.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:25.000
I think they're trying to put it out now as like some sort of EA Sports college football or something like that.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Excuse me.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:39.000
They're saying, the collegiate licensing company, the CLC is caught in the middle of a dispute between NCAA and EA, which should not involve us.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:43.000
And the CLC has valued the relationship with both NCAA and EA.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:49.000
While we hope that they can soon resolve their dispute, we see no reason for the CLC to be involved.

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:59.000
And, of course, EA has declined a sort of comments regarding, you know, the CLC being involved in this lawsuit in the first place.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:06.000
So, either way, it doesn't look like NCAA is going to be coming back for a college football game next year.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:13.000
That's too bad because that was one of the only good titles in the month of July.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Now, I guess it's going to be Persona. Lots of Persona.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Persona all year long. You're a Persona.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
You say that like it's a bad thing.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
I'm not saying it's like a bad thing.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:29.000
I mean, if you didn't like sports, Persona is what you got.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:35.000
Alright. Well, one thing you can look forward to early next year is the remasters of Final Fantasy X and X-2.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Because those remasters are finally dated here for the U.S.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:43.000
I believe they are already out in Japan or about to come out right before the end of the year.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:44.000
December.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:45.000
December something, right?

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
Well, we're getting them in March 2014.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:50.000
Specifically, March 18th, 2014 is when North America gets it.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:53.000
Europe gets it on March 21st.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:56.000
Now, that is the PlayStation 3 versions of the remaster.

02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:00.000
If you're looking to the Vita version, well, there's been no announcement on that.

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:03.000
And a press release from Square Enix Europe said, quote,

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Full details of the PlayStation Vita version and release timing will be revealed at a future date.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:12.000
Hmm. Hmm.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:16.000
Well, we'll see. We'll see. Poor Vita.

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:20.000
You know, it would have been great for the Vita if the Vita version came out first.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:24.000
That would have been really good for the Vita, but, oh well, I guess I shouldn't encourage that.

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Does the Vita have a fully-fledged Final Fantasy yet?

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:29.000
No, it wouldn't have. 13 pre-dated it by a long shot.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Yeah, no, Vita doesn't really have anything Final Fantasy, per se, unless you want to count PSP games that you can play on Vita.

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:41.000
Like, Tactics was a PlayStation Plus title at one point, and there's plenty of PS1 games.

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:44.000
I still have the physical disc, the UMD of that.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:45.000
Yeah.

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:50.000
All right, let's get to the mailbag. Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orange.orangeradio.com.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:54.000
And usually DarkSakura jumps in the mailbag.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:55.000
Both are applicable.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
Well, if she sees things she doesn't like, she might.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:04.000
No, she jumps in the mailbag head first, but since she's not here tonight, I will get the hazmat suit on and jump into the mailbag for you.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:07.000
Just two emails tonight to read here.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:13.000
And the first one comes to us from a person who said, please don't read my name. So, fine, I will not.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:18.000
So, anonymous writes us and says, why I am getting an Xbox One instead of PlayStation 4.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:21.000
The Xbox One is better.

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:28.000
The Xbox doesn't require you to pay for a $5 a month PlayStation Plus membership for online multiplayer.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:34.000
The PlayStation 4, however, does require a $5 a month PlayStation Plus membership for online multiplayer.

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:39.000
The Xbox One can play used Xbox One games.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:45.000
The PlayStation 4, however, cannot play used Xbox One games.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:50.000
The Xbox will have many exclusive games, such as Killer Instinct, Halo.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:55.000
The Xbox One version of Battlefield 4 will be exclusive to the Xbox One.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:00.000
The Xbox One version of Assassin's Creed, the Xbox One version of Watch Dogs.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:03.000
I can't argue with that. That's solid. That is a solid argument.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:09.000
That is some NeoGaf logic right there. Good job, anonymous emailer. Good job.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:14.000
I'm having one of those moments where it's like, not sure if troll or...

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:20.000
You know, you laugh about that, but like, over this week, I've been actually, I've had some downtime at work,

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:23.000
so I've been going through the Microsoft retail training program.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:26.000
In fact, I've been actually giving away some DLC codes I got from that.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:33.000
But holy shit, man, that is some of their arguments for the Xbox One.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Hey, you can play used games on it. I'm like, yeah. Cool.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:43.000
All those games that have just sat around for years and years, and I don't really feel like bringing them out again.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:48.000
You know what would have really been news? You can play all your last generation games on it as well.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:54.000
It's backwards compatible. I'm telling you, from people I know that are more casual gamers,

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:59.000
like they like gaming, but they don't seek out shows like this or post to internet websites and things like that,

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:04.000
that's the number one bitch I hear is that, well, I don't want to get a PlayStation 4 if it's not going to play PlayStation 3 games.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:08.000
Or, well, does the new Xbox play the other Xbox games? Why not?

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:14.000
I hear that more than anything else. I understand why. You probably understand why,

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:19.000
because of all the graphic chips upgrades and the parts inside that have changed, where that's not possible.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:24.000
But I'm just telling you, the general public doesn't give a fuck,

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:30.000
because there's been other consoles that were backwards compatible that kind of instilled that in us.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:33.000
The Wii played the GameCube games. The Wii U plays the Wii games.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
The Game Boys are usually backwards compatible and so forth.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:41.000
And even what, Xbox 360 played some Xbox games. PlayStation 3s, when they were new, would play PlayStation 2 games.

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
Mmm, zippy.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
PS2 did play PS1 games.

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:49.000
Yeah, exactly. So there were some consoles in the past that kind of did that. So, I'm just saying.

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:55.000
The funny thing is that those consoles are the minority, and especially Nintendo history up until the Wii

02:28:55.000 --> 02:29:01.000
had no backwards compatibility console-wise, because they didn't fit in slots anymore.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:06.000
And not to mention the shift from cartridge to disc just in general.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:11.000
Yeah, same experience here. I went out to brunch, lunch, something with a friend of mine,

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:16.000
and that was one of the very first things out of his mouth, is that the PlayStation 4 isn't...

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:19.000
And this was before I knew about the architecture switch.

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:24.000
And he said, yeah, I hate Sony now because they're not playing all the games that I already own.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:28.000
I said, that's very strange, especially not even digital versions.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:32.000
As soon as I figured out why that's the case, it all made sense.

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:37.000
Same argument you just made. Had another point. Slipped my mind. You know how it goes.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:41.000
Alright. Well, we have another email here. It's from Ross Steel, UT.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:44.000
Ross Steel has a tendency to send the show novels.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:49.000
Ross Steel, I'm going to invite you to post this on our forums in its entirety, because it's a little bit long.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Hey, I'm all about where every gamer has a voice, but it is still a three-hour show, so this is quite the little novel here.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:57.000
I'm going to try to get the gist of it here, but I'm going to be extremely paraphrasing.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:01.000
If you do that, remember, TLDR.

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:07.000
Yeah, bullet points are great. Like, that last email was a bunch of bullet points, right?

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:12.000
No, I don't want to... It's not that the email is bad. It's just I only have a certain amount of time.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:15.000
But the more I talk about the time frames, the longer we drag things out.

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:23.000
So let me read a portion of this email here from Ross Steel, UT, who basically was emailing us to talk about who won the last console generation.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:27.000
And first off was,

02:30:53.000 --> 02:31:03.000
I won't bring myself so low as to pirate games, but between Steam's offline mode failing me numerous times and the PlayStation Network outage,

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:10.000
I don't feel like any of the stuff I buy on a DRM platform is actually mine, so I abandoned those libraries and counted the loss as a lesson learned.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:16.000
I learned not to trust one iota of what I'm told in the gaming media. This show accepted, of course.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:23.000
I don't really consider ourselves gaming media, because we're not trying to break... Just an aside here, I don't consider ourselves gaming media, because we're not trying to break news, we're just trying to talk about it.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:30.000
But I also hate the term gaming enthusiast, because some news doesn't make us enthusiastic. We're just gaming talkers.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:39.000
What else would you call it? I guess Bobby uses the term gaming commentator, but then I feel like I'm talking about a sports ball.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
Casting, casting, Starcraft, and all that kind of stuff.

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:45.000
We're just people talking shit. That's what we are. We're people talking shit.

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Alright, anyhow. He says in his email here,

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:55.000
This generation, we saw gaming journalism degrade into the worst state it's been in since the crash of 83.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Reviews are made based on how big a franchise is, not to appease publishers, but to keep the fanboys off their asses.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:05.000
I learned to love Killzone, was something he said.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:10.000
The franchise started off as an also ran on the PlayStation 2, a laughable attempt at a Halo killer.

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:15.000
However, the ensuing games have shown remarkable improvement, both in gameplay and storytelling,

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:19.000
and it's been an absolute pleasure to see the progress Guerrilla Games has made.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:27.000
Let's see. I want to read some of these PS's too, because they're really good.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:30.000
PS, you guys were wondering about what made a cult game.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:34.000
I like to think of it in the same way as a cult movie, where it doesn't have a huge mainstream success,

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:38.000
but instead finds a smaller, more dedicated, and enduring fan base.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Showgirls and Rocky Horror may not have made a lot of money at the box office,

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:47.000
but they'll likely be remembered long after people have forgotten about the latest superhero fad movie.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:51.000
And PPS, the most important part of the entire email. You ready?

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:56.000
PPS. Really, Loki? You gotta up your game when it comes to parody porn names.

02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:00.000
Here's some you can use next time the topic comes up on the house.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:03.000
The Dark Knight Hardens.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
Shaving Private Ryan.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
I don't remember what the hell this was in reference to.

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
The Shaw-Skank Redemption.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
Or the Cock of Steel.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:14.000
We were talking about porn on the last show.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:18.000
It was OLR. We were talking about porn. It happens.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:19.000
Here you go.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:24.000
Alright, thank you RawsteelUT. Sorry I had to edit, but we gotta keep things moving here,

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
because the show is already running long.

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:31.000
If you want to email us some thoughts, mailbag at orangelaunchreader.com is the place to do so.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:34.000
You can also send us a tweet, twitter.com slash OLR.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:37.000
Let's get to the FUs of the week. Why?

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:42.000
Because we're mad and stuff and we're not going to take it anymore.

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
Jason, would you like to start us off tonight?

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:06.000
I shall. FU to traffic. FU to parking.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
FU to critical mass.

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:13.000
I mean, I love the human ingenuity and the things that especially in San Francisco and Manhattan

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:21.000
and any other completely over-full to the brim location, what they have to deal with.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:25.000
You know, God bless people's ingenuity and the way that they make things work.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
God damn, fuck critical mass.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:30.000
That stuff's just frustrating. Yeah, that's it.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
Uh, Logie?

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:38.000
Um, FU cookie quicker. I don't know why I'm so famous.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
Amen.

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:46.000
My FU of the week goes to my scale, because it told me something I didn't want to hear yesterday.

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
I'm very angry at it.

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:53.000
So also FU to the lack of motivation I have when it comes to doing something about that.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:57.000
So I've really got to hunker down and do something about it, so we'll see.

02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:01.000
So stay tuned to figure out what fad diet I go on in our next episode.

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
We'll see.

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:08.000
Alright, let's get back into a few more gaming news stories than Twitter topics and Skype line and all that good stuff.

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:12.000
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
But first, a couple more quick stories.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:15.000
Logie?

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:18.000
You know, you could just pick up one of those Wii Fit meters and then you could download Wii Fit U for free.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:26.000
I know, and I could get the balance board out from under the TV, but Logie, it's so hard.

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:30.000
You have to lift that TV and then the TV will be lower, Logie.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:36.000
What else is going to raise the TV up that perfect amount that the Wii Balance Board does?

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
Cable box.

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
Don't you have a story to read?

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:45.000
Today I've walked 7,500 miles and three and a half...

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
Wow, not that many miles.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:51.000
7,500 steps and three and a half miles.

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
What is that? Fitbit?

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
Oh, you've got a Fitbit? Do you like that?

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
I really do. It's actually...

02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:01.000
Does it actually get you to walk more though? Because I could get a Fitbit and be like, hey, look how much I walked today.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:07.000
But it doesn't matter if I'm not doing more than what I did already.

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:12.000
Inherently no, but it makes the motivation easier when I go to actually do it.

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:19.000
Does Fitbit have a social thing where I can go like, let's say you and I both have Fitbit and I get a higher score than you.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:24.000
I walk more steps. I can send you a text message that's like, haha, I'm better than you. Here's proof.

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:34.000
Maybe not bragging rights, but I was actually just commenting on something of our good old buddy Big Red Pimps post a couple days ago.

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:37.000
He's on a fitness kick right now and he's already lighter than me.

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:42.000
He started a couple months ago. He's already lighter than me and I need to really do the same.

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:48.000
But he's been the top of the Fitbit leaderboards for weeks now and it's him talking about that.

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Oh, so there are Fitbit leaderboards?

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:57.000
Absolutely. I'm in my employer's group as well as I have my selection of friends.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
So there is E-peen to it. There is E-peen to it.

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:06.000
Absolutely. There are badges. There are goals. There is a good combination of everything to increase the...

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:12.000
Lower the barrier to entry, raise the motivation enough that you might actually get off your lazy ass and do it.

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:13.000
How much is a Fitbit?

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:17.000
Ranges from $70 to $120. There's a couple different moments.

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
$70?

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:21.000
Lord, that's a lot of money.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:25.000
That's a lot of money. That's a lot of money for bragging rights about I walked more than you.

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:29.000
Then again, not getting thinner just sitting here doing a radio show.

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:33.000
I would say just use your DS, but that unfortunately doesn't... that negates Fitbit at all.

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
It's fucking snacking too. Snacking is my worst enemy.

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
Should I slap you when you go up to go get some more of them?

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
No, because I'm hungry.

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
Me too, but I'm not going to eat until frickin' midnight.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:42.000
Anyways, Loki.

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Do you want some pretzels?

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:44.000
Sorry, no.

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:45.000
Loki.

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Alright, so the inevitable has happened.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:38:01.000
They're going to bundle a Vita with a PlayStation 4 and sell it in the UK for an undetermined amount of money at some point.

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:07.000
That's it. They're really pushing that second screen thing. Remote play and all that fun stuff.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:11.000
Hopefully you get a good price, because I don't think they had a price on it.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:18.000
That's it, huh? Do you think this will actually sell? Because that's an expensive bundle.

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:25.000
If it's at a good price, if you're like, you know, saving quite a bit of money on it, then yeah, it should sell.

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:29.000
If there is no price break on it, then fuck them.

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:36.000
Alright, this last story I have here doesn't totally have to do with gaming, but you know what?

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:44.000
It definitely has to do with tech, and it's got a lot of people talking this week, and I wanted to bring it up here on the show.

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:49.000
Y'all know the famous MP3 player Winamp, right?

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
It really whips the llama's ass.

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:56.000
That's right, with this little demo story about whooping the llama's ass or whatever Wesley Willis reject lyric that was.

02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:01.000
Winamp was bought by America Online in June 1999.

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
America Online is still around?

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:08.000
And that's when the troubles began. Yeah, guess who owns Joystiq blog, and WoW Insider and all that.

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:15.000
TUAW, and the weblog's network is owned by AOL Time Warner.

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:18.000
And Huffington Post is part of AOL now, or the other way around, right?

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:22.000
So, they've got some stuff. They just, you know, dial-up isn't really what they're known for anymore.

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:26.000
But anyway, they did have Winamp, and they bought it in June 1999.

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:31.000
It is going to be shutting down. Winamp is shutting down in exactly one month.

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:36.000
Sadness. By the way, this also includes Shoutcast, apparently.

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:40.000
Now, what was exciting is that there were some rumors going around, I don't know if there's any truth to this,

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:45.000
that Microsoft was looking at buying them once AOL announced that they were going to shut them down.

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:49.000
I don't know why Microsoft would necessarily want them, but as somebody who, you know,

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:55.000
helps to run a Shoutcast network, like vognetwork.com is on a Shoutcast server,

02:39:55.000 --> 02:40:01.000
I would like to see Microsoft buy it and then implement it onto Xbox One,

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:05.000
because I think it would be great if you could get Vognetwork directly onto Xbox One.

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:08.000
But I sadly don't think that's going to be happening.

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:12.000
So yeah, Winamp is going to be closing. Now, here's the thing.

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:15.000
They can't go and uninstall the program off your computer.

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:19.000
So a lot of people have been asking, like, well, what's going to happen to all the Shoutcasters?

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
Once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet.

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:25.000
As far as we know, nothing is going to happen to the Shoutcasters.

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:29.000
As long as there's people still selling Shoutcast server spaces over, we have a place to go.

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:33.000
Yeah, it'll take down the official Shoutcast stream directory,

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:37.000
but if you still have your own server, you still have the technology, nothing changes.

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:43.000
So vognetwork's not going anywhere, but does this motivate us to possibly explore other options in 2014?

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:48.000
Eh, sure. But I'll tell you, Bobby and I are both very much at the school of thought of,

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:51.000
if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:55.000
And why are you wagging your finger at me, Jason?

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:59.000
Because I'm very counter to that. I like new features and new things.

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:02.000
Jason was like, you're using Winamp 2.0.

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:09.000
We had multiple revelations today. He's using a 7-year-old MIRC.

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:15.000
He's using no-shit Winamp 2.0, not even 5 with the 2.0 style.

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:19.000
He's using Internet Explorer 6 on this PC, for fuck's sake.

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:23.000
I'm using Firefox to browse. I don't actually use Internet Explorer.

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:29.000
Internet Explorer 6 is still present, and I saw it jump up, and I was almost in tears.

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:34.000
And XP, which has been dead for how many years?

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:37.000
Okay, hold on, hold on. This Winamp is 5.572.

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:41.000
You lied to me. It's just using the 2.0 style.

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:44.000
I get it, there are certain situations that call for it.

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:48.000
5.5 is not the newest, though, because I get a pop-up window every time I launch it saying,

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:52.000
shouldn't you update your Winamp? I'm like, no, fucking leave me alone,

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:55.000
because when I update things, they break. Always.

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:58.000
I like doing new things, I like new features.

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:02.000
I'm not a bleeding-edge kind of guy, but I'm not far from it.

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:09.000
Alright, anyhow, VoG will continue until it really does break,

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
and we are forced to switch to something else.

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:16.000
Or, somebody sells us real good on the advantages of using something else,

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
which is always a possibility, too.

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:19.000
Possible.

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:23.000
Jason's eyes lit up. I'm gonna get an email tomorrow.

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
Reasons why you should be on Icecast.

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:29.000
That's what's gonna happen.

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:31.000
Yeah, anyways.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:38.000
Alright, that was it. Let me now switch our status on our un-updated Skype,

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:41.000
which I'm still using 6.6, even though I think there's a 7.0 now.

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:44.000
I refuse to update Skype.

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:48.000
I was on a call, you can call us now, 1877-GameOLR,

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
or username on Skype, orangeandandrea.

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:51.000
I refuse to update Skype.

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
Are we gonna get any calls from an Xbox One?

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
I hope so. Let's see.

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
If you've got an Xbox One, fire it up and give us a call.

02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:00.000
Phone lines are already lighting up, so let's go to it.

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
This is Ravenstaufen. Can you hear me?

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:07.000
Oh, yes, we can. Hi, and your video just popped up. What's up?

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
Oh, good. I got it.

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:12.000
You got your gold 3DS. You just held it up there.

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:15.000
Yeah, and I also got the game with it. I must be stupid.

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:21.000
Wait a minute. You got the game and the console, even though the game's already on the console?

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:25.000
Yeah, well, what happened was, I was listening to your last week's show,

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:30.000
and then I went like, you know, I bought the game at midnight with the rest of the X-Bone people,

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:33.000
and then I said, you know what, I'm gonna go buy it.

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:36.000
How was that, being the Nintendo guy in the line?

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
Oh, there was four of us.

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:41.000
There was four of us there. We're all shouting at Zelda.

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:45.000
It was actually a little powwow. It was absolutely cool. I loved it.

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:48.000
I even got the X-Bone shirt to prove. Sorry for showing off.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:52.000
That's all right. Ravenstaufen is taking off his clothes on cam right now.

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
Banned from Twitch TV.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:59.000
I will put this on the list of reasons why Orange Launch Radio should have a video.

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:02.000
I will add that Ravenstaufen gets naked.

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:04.000
Just, I'm kidding.

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:07.000
Wish for what you don't need to know.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:15.000
Raven, I can't help but notice behind you, I love that little Pikachu Pokemon banner thing you've got.

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:18.000
Yeah, this is my little room that I broadcast on.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:21.000
I know you have a little room, but this is the setup.

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:25.000
Some people call it a dining room, but we call it the broadcast room, yes.

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:30.000
Yeah, it's just a little room that I have posters of Grand Theft Auto and all that stuff.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:34.000
All the consoles are in here so I can just chill out, just shut the door and go like,

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:35.000
GO AWAY!

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:38.000
Nice. Every man needs a man cave.

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:41.000
Yeah, this one's pretty small, but it's awesome.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
It's not the size, it's how you use it.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:48.000
Yeah, I was calling because I'm sure you played Zelda.

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:51.000
Does it make the case for 3D for you as well?

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:57.000
I was already kind of like, I don't hate 3D.

02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:03.000
It was always kind of a neat effect to me, but I don't think games should really rely on it either,

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:06.000
because there's so many people that can't see it, you know, too.

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:09.000
But does it have impressive graphics?

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:14.000
Does it really show what 3DS can do with the 3D?

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:15.000
Absolutely.

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:20.000
I was really impressed with, just like in the dungeons where you have the multiple levels,

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:25.000
how you can really see that top and bottom, and just like when you jump off cliffs,

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:31.000
or my absolute favorite, when you grab a chicken and then jump off a cliff and slowly fly down,

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:34.000
like yeah, that stuff looks rad on the 3DS.

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:38.000
Yeah, I really enjoyed a lot of this game.

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:44.000
I like that it's top down, and it really does look like you're looking down on the action,

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
and it really looks very nice.

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
Yeah. No, it's great. I love it.

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:53.000
And I think it makes a good case for not getting a 2DS.

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:54.000
It really does.

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:58.000
I mean, if anyone's playing on a 2DS, I feel you're missing out on something.

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:02.000
Like, just the death of just seeing that go deeper is just, it's something that,

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:06.000
even with the, how are you liking the bigger screens now that you have a big DS?

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:09.000
Oh, and now it's like, I'm doing one of those things where it's like,

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:13.000
how did I go so long with my regular 3DS?

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
Like, how did I manage that?

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:18.000
Because now that I'm on the 3DS XL, I'm like, oh my God, this is so beautiful. I love it.

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:23.000
Yeah, so, but that's like a lot of different upgrade things.

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:24.000
It's like the iPhones, right?

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:28.000
When I'm on the 4 for so long, and then when I finally get the 5, it's like,

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:31.000
God damn, how did I use that shitty phone for so long?

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
But it's just, that's the way tech works.

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:34.000
Tech is like that.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:39.000
One last thing, I mean, I'm still keeping my purple 3DS because I'm still attached to it.

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:42.000
I can't transfer anything over because I have the circle pad.

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:45.000
So I have to keep everything nice and clean on this one.

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
So Fire Card 7 can't come over.

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:51.000
Oh, dang, that's right, because there's no circle pad for the XL, is there?

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:55.000
There is, it's just, I only have the circle pad for the 3DS.

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:56.000
Gotcha.

02:46:56.000 --> 02:47:01.000
Oh no, I moved everything over and I bought a 32 gig card, 30 bucks at Radio Shack,

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:04.000
so I will never run into storage issues again.

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:05.000
That's the goal.

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:06.000
That's what I need to do.

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:11.000
I have an 8 and a 16, and I'm like debating like, all right, this is my default one,

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:14.000
and it looks like I might have to just make everything from scratch

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:18.000
or either beat Revelations on the 3DS and then move it all over later.

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:23.000
I was rocking a 2 gig SD card on my original 3DS and I don't know how I did it.

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:24.000
I don't know how the hell I did it.

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:25.000
I'm rocking.

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:26.000
I still am.

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:27.000
Wow.

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:28.000
It's not enough.

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
All right, well, Raven, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls,

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
but thank you so much for the call and the video chat.

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:33.000
We appreciate it.

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:34.000
Oh, not at all.

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:35.000
I'm glad you can answer my call.

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:36.000
Bye, peace.

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:37.000
Later.

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:38.000
Always good to hear from Raven.

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
I do love the fact that you wave into the monitor.

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:41.000
I know, I still wave.

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:44.000
God, here I am talking about, we don't need a stinking video show,

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:49.000
and then I'm like, I keep playing into the video stuff.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
Clearly, I don't know what I'm talking about,

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
but if you've been listening for 11 years, you already know that.

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:54.000
Hi, you're on the phone, sir.

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:55.000
Who's there?

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
It's the one and only DJ Ron Mess.

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:58.000
Hi, Rama.

02:47:58.000 --> 02:47:59.000
How are you?

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:00.000
I am good.

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:01.000
How about you, good sir?

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:05.000
Good, except I'm learning slowly tonight that I'm always wrong.

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:09.000
That's been like pretty much my entire life, so I feel for you.

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:10.000
Let's start a club.

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
Ooh, and booze should be involved.

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
I'm right by the fridge.

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
I still have leftover vanilla vodka.

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:17.000
Fuck yes.

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:18.000
What's the old saying?

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:21.000
Here's to you, here's to me, best of friends will always be,

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:25.000
but if we should ever disagree, fuck you, and here's to me.

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:26.000
You got that right.

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:27.000
Yes, cling.

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:28.000
All right.

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:29.000
Sorry, Rama.

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
You didn't call in to sing drinking songs with me,

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
even though it's probably a nice little sidebar,

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
but what is really on your mind tonight?

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:36.000
Any...

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
Rob, it's happy hour somewhere, right?

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:43.000
It's happy hour at OLR, at vognetwork.com, between...

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:49.000
Well, we have the family friendly bar at between 5 o'clock and 6 o'clock Pacific,

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:52.000
and then we have adults only 18 and up after...

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
Oh, you're so bad.

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:55.000
You're so bad.

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
I'm not bad, I'm just...

02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:00.000
We have a family friendly bar from 5 to 6.

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
That's not wrong.

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:05.000
No, the funny thing is when we open up the bar in the chat room,

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
someone gets kind of upset because it's family friendly.

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:12.000
I get in trouble when I'm not family friendly between 5 and 6,

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
so I've got to be careful.

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:15.000
All right.

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
What's really on your mind, Rama?

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:21.000
The Legend of Zelda I link between worlds.

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:22.000
You've been playing it?

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:27.000
Yes, let's just say there was a reason why I was late to work one Friday.

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
Wow, really?

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
Yes, yeah.

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:36.000
I was underlined amongst the people that were picking up PlayStation 4s and Xbox Ones,

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
so...

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:42.000
So were you like Raven where there was like four people there,

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:46.000
like little Nintendo camps in the line, or was it just you or what?

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:49.000
No, it was just one line for everything pretty much,

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:55.000
but I did notice that there were some people changing their minds in their PS4 pickups,

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:58.000
and they were asking people, does anyone want a PS4?

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
We have like three here.

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:01.000
Nobody said anything.

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:02.000
Oh, wow.

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:03.000
Interesting.

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
Well, where's your head at with the...

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
I mean, I know you've been playing Zelda.

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:08.000
I'll grow you more on that in a minute,

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:11.000
but where's your head at with the whole PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and all that?

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
Are you getting one, or what are you doing?

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:17.000
I plan on getting a PlayStation 4 when the order comes out.

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:18.000
Oh.

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:21.000
It's a steampunk first-person shooter.

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
That's the reason why I want to pick it up.

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:27.000
As a convention-goer, I can see where that's relevant to your interests.

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
Mm-hmm.

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:30.000
All right, so tell me more about Zelda.

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:34.000
What do you think about the game itself?

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:37.000
It's so surreal, especially on the XL.

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:41.000
It's like a total throwback from me sitting there on the Super NES,

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:44.000
playing through the game from start to finish.

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:47.000
The music is just phenomenal.

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:52.000
I just have a couple of gripes with the game, but other than that, I'm enjoying it.

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:55.000
What are the gripes, because in order to be,

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
and I hate to use this term, fair and balanced,

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
but I don't know what else to say, in order to be fair...

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:02.000
Why did it just become Fox News?

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:03.000
Come on.

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
This is actually a fair and balanced discussion.

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
I know, I know.

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:11.000
To try and bring a little balance to all the positivity I was barfing on the game earlier,

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
what are the gripes you have?

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:16.000
Well, for me, I like the top-down view,

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:20.000
but I remember from the Super NES version, from the top-down view,

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:26.000
you could see more of Link's face and body, so it was more like the angle.

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:32.000
But in this version, all you can pretty much see is the top of the hero's head and his hair.

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:36.000
I do feel like we saw a little more,

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:41.000
like the view radius was a little more on the Super Nintendo as well,

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
but maybe I'm crazy.

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:46.000
I mean, it's not like a game-ruiner, but I noticed it.

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
Yeah.

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:51.000
And the second issue I have is that now,

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:55.000
I've never really followed the lore of Zelda,

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:58.000
but I do know that I think it was with the first N64 game,

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:02.000
is when the lore of Zelda, the storyline split,

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:06.000
where you have adventures where it's just Link in the game,

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:09.000
and then there's a storyline where it's the hero.

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:13.000
I'm putting the game in thinking it's Link and a brand new adventure.

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:19.000
I'm thinking it's going to pick up sort of where A Link to the Past left off, per se.

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:22.000
But no, you're playing as the hero.

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:26.000
Because you can name the hero whatever you want.

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:28.000
That's the difference.

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:31.000
No, I guess you could do that in some of the other ones,

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:35.000
but I think that plays into it somehow, that you don't have to name him Link.

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
Sure. All the games are like that.

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:40.000
Even from the Super NES one, you can name whatever,

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
but you were still Link.

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
Can you do that on Twilight Princess and stuff?

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:47.000
I thought you couldn't, but it's just been so long.

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:51.000
I always name them Link anyway. I kind of just don't notice it.

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:58.000
That was my issue. I'd rather play as Link.

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:01.000
I don't mean to split hands, but that's how I kind of feel.

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:05.000
You're the hero, but the hero looks just like Link.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:10.000
In Final Fantasy, you can technically rename all the characters as well.

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:12.000
In almost all the Final Fantasy games, you can rename the characters,

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.000
at least until the instituted voice acting.

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:21.000
I can't play Final Fantasy VI and not have Terra and Locke and all that.

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:28.000
I think everybody does that one playthrough where you start naming your characters butts, fart, penis.

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:35.000
For me, I renamed them as characters from Ronda and the What Happened.

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:40.000
I'm following through the storyline, and I'm picturing the personalities in the game.

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:42.000
It fits so well.

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:50.000
It's just that I'd like to be Link, but with a different name, but I know the game is around him,

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:56.000
not the games around the hero that's supposed to be filling the shoes that belonged to Link.

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:01.000
That is a minor gripe though, right?

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:05.000
At the end of the day, it doesn't really impact the game, which is fantastic.

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:13.000
Right. As I was saying earlier in the chat about it, when I called A Link Between Worlds Second Quest,

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:16.000
I say it's Second Quest, whereas if you remember in the first game,

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:19.000
if you played through Second Quest, everything was different.

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
One thing was it was something else.

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
That's how I'm seeing this game.

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:28.000
Everything is there, but when you go into certain locations, things have changed.

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:32.000
It's like, wow, it's been 10, 15 years since I've been here,

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:38.000
so there's more for me to explore, or if I go into this store, oh, this is something else.

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:41.000
That is true, but there's also the new mechanics to consider,

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:45.000
especially the flattening yourself on the wall really kind of changes things

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:48.000
and shows you more parts of the world that weren't even there, but I guess that's the point.

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:49.000
Mm-hmm.

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:50.000
All right.

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:53.000
I'm going to let you go to try and squeeze in another call, but thanks for the call.

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:54.000
Hey, anytime, bro.

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:55.000
All right, take care, buddy.

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:56.000
You too.

02:54:56.000 --> 02:55:01.000
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you'd like to give us a call.

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:06.000
We have time for at least one more call here if you are interested in talking with us tonight.

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:08.000
I want to get to Twitter topics.

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.000
I also want to ask Loki if he has any last-minute stories

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:14.000
or if you are too busy clicking cookies over there.

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:15.000
No, I have last-minute stories.

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:16.000
Okay.

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:25.000
Apparently, there's been reports that you can have some issues,

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:33.000
maybe even possibly a band if you upload stuff to the upload studio on Xbox One with obscenities in there.

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
Mm-hmm.

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:41.000
So maybe as a glitch or something, but there has been some reports regarding that.

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:42.000
All right.

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:43.000
Be careful.

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:49.000
We got another call coming in, so let's get to it, and then we'll take whatever last-minute stories otherwise that Loki has.

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:50.000
Let's get to it.

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:51.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:54.000
Who's this?

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000
Bienvenidos a OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:57.000
You there?

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
Caller.

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:00.000
Hello.

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:01.000
I don't know.

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:05.000
Yeah, Skype seems to think the caller isn't there, so I'm going to have to let that call go.

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:08.000
Sorry about it, but go ahead and try again.

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:13.000
Remember, Echo123 is your friend to test before you call.

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000
I haven't heard that name in years.

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:16.000
What?

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:17.000
Echo123.

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:18.000
Echo123.

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:22.000
I would love to see an Xbox One call, so please, if you have your Xbox One,

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:25.000
I want to see what the quality looks like.

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:30.000
See you sitting on your couch there, giving a call.

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:33.000
Maybe I can give the voice command, and it'll work.

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:36.000
Xbox, Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:39.000
Now if somebody is playing, it's going to fuck them up.

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:40.000
Sorry.

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:41.000
I had to.

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:44.000
Xbox, open Skype.

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.000
Now everybody's going to go hit stop.

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000
Oh, we're getting another call here.

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:49.000
If I did, I apologize.

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:50.000
All right, yeah.

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:51.000
I know, right?

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:52.000
Who's this?

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:55.000
Maybe I can give the voice command, and it'll work.

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:56.000
Xbox, Skype.

02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:57.000
Hello?

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:58.000
Go ahead and mute the...

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:00.000
I think they got scared.

02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:02.000
Mute your radio before you call in.

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:04.000
That's always a good idea.

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:06.000
Otherwise, we hear ourselves echoing.

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:07.000
It's a little awkward.

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:08.000
Or just headphones.

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:11.000
That was the name I didn't recognize, so...

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:14.000
Echo123 again, and...

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:18.000
Or maybe that person just accidentally called us because of what you did.

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:22.000
Hey, you're the one that said Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:24.000
I just said open Skype.

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:25.000
That's true.

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:26.000
Come on, you went the whole nine yards.

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:27.000
That's true.

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000
It would be really funny, because that person hung up right away.

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:30.000
Maybe that really did dial.

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:31.000
I don't know.

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
Should we try it again?

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
No, don't do it again.

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:36.000
I'm going to get hate mail.

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:37.000
Loki, go ahead.

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
If you have more last minute stories.

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
I don't.

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:42.000
Oh, well, goddamn.

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:43.000
Sorry.

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:44.000
All right.

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:46.000
Let me...

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:49.000
I'm trying to pull up our Twitter, but I got sidetracked.

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:52.000
But I know we had some tweets here tonight.

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:53.000
Let's see.

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:54.000
YYR tweets us.

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:58.000
Guess what comes out for 3DS in North America and Europe in four days?

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:02.000
Space Harrier and Super Hang-On and Glorious 3D.

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:03.000
Instabuy.

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:04.000
I forgot about those.

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:05.000
I'm excited about that as well.

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:08.000
Too Bad Dark Soccer's not here tonight to give you a little squee.

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:09.000
But...

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:10.000
Squeak!

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:11.000
Squeak!

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000
Here you go.

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000
Let's see.

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:20.000
Gali89 tweeted us this little acapella Mega Man 2 Wily stage.

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:24.000
I didn't screen the YouTube first, so I'm not going to play it right now.

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:29.000
But I love seeing that type of remixed homegrown stuff on YouTube.

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:30.000
Always fun.

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:36.000
CatastrophicMoggie also excited about Atlus announcing Persona 5, giving us the links just in case we missed it.

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.000
Dungeonbuster says,

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:43.000
First thing I thought of listening to Yakuza 5's Battle of Pride was OLR.

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:46.000
Makes me sad it's not getting localized.

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.000
Oh, I got to give this as a shoutout too.

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:50.000
This came in through our Twitter and I got to say hi to this.

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:53.000
This came from Video Game Bang.

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:54.000
And they said,

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:56.000
Hi, you're a Sacramento gaming podcast.

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:58.000
We're a Sacramento gaming podcast.

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.000
Let's be friends.

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:04.000
So shoutout to our new frenzies at Video Game Bang.

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:05.000
And I did reply and said,

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:07.000
Okay, BFF's forever.

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:10.000
So there you go. Hello to Video Game Bang.

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:12.000
Although I'm going to be honest, it's just the pervo in me.

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:15.000
But every time I look at the name, I see Video Gang Bang.

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:17.000
And I'm like, I need to get glasses there.

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:20.000
No, I'm not. I'm sure it's a fantastic show.

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.000
I will check it out this week.

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:24.000
Both are fantastic shows.

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:25.000
What?

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.000
Both are fantastic shows.

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.000
I'm sure that is true as well.

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:33.000
I will check out Video Game Bang later this week.

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
Wouldn't it be funny if they lived next door?

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:38.000
You never know. They're in Sac somewhere.

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:40.000
Should we knock on the wall and find out?

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:43.000
Well, I'm not far from Sac State.

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:46.000
So I'm sure there's a lot of stuff that brews out of the college there.

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:48.000
Alright, anyhow.

02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:50.000
The phones are ringing one more time.

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:53.000
We're going to try and take this call and then we'll wrap up.

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:55.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:59:57.000 --> 03:00:00.000
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:03.000
Hello, this is Omega777.

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:04.000
Hello.

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:08.000
There you are. You made it, Omega777. What's up, buddy?

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:20.000
That was me that I guess tried to call earlier and ended up with the sound from the radio coming in and it didn't...

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:23.000
Well, 50 points from Gryffindor, but what's on your mind?

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:34.000
Okay, basically I figured out the reason why there wasn't a whole lot of... was it midnight releases or camp outs for Wii U last year.

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:48.000
And basically, as it turns out, because it was done on a Sunday, I guess as it usually is, a lot of the big box retail stores didn't want to do any midnight releases.

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:54.000
I guess they figured it wouldn't be a commercially safe thing to do.

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:56.000
Jesus would not approve.

03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:59.000
Yeah, definitely.

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:05.000
I'm assuming that's what it is. Well, you know what, especially in some parts of the company, you don't mess around with Sundays.

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:10.000
Especially asking people to stay up all night till midnight when there's church the next day.

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:13.000
That is asking too much, especially in some places.

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:20.000
So it's not a far-fetched theory, to be honest. But could it also be true that maybe the demand just wasn't there?

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:29.000
But I seem to think the Wii U sold pretty well initially. It was what happened after the initial release that was problematic.

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:40.000
Yeah, a lot of the consoles, they'll have their glitches and whatnot, but in the end, they'll overcome them.

03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:45.000
And I'm sure Wii U will definitely catch up with everyone else in the future.

03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:52.000
BlackWolf in our chat room wants to point out, I got my Wii U at a midnight release, so there were stores that did a midnight release for the Wii U.

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:55.000
Maybe it just depends on where you were at.

03:01:55.000 --> 03:02:01.000
But Amiga777, where are you at with these next-gen consoles? Have you picked any of them up?

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:06.000
Are you Team Sony, Team Nintendo, Team Microsoft, or all teams? Where's your head at with this?

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:17.000
I'm not a person of that on any team yet. I guess you could say, funnily enough, I'm probably just still Team Sega.

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:20.000
Dreamcast, that is.

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:28.000
Fair enough. I think there's a lot of people that can't let go. You do know they remake all those games for the newer consoles? No, I understand.

03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:35.000
Oh, yes, definitely. I do know that. I mean, I do have a 360 now. I play it every once in a while.

03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:41.000
So that's what it's going to take? First console to get Shenmue 3 announced for it? Instant win?

03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:43.000
Definitely.

03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:48.000
Fair enough. Alright, AmigaBuddy, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for the call.

03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:49.000
Alright, take care.

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:50.000
Alright, take care. Bye-bye.

03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:55.000
So there you go. First console to get Shenmue 3 is an exclusive. You win.

03:02:55.000 --> 03:03:02.000
Alright, that's it for Last Minute Stories. That's it for Skypline tonight. Thank you guys very much for calling and participating.

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:08.000
If you didn't get through, but you wanted to call, 1-877-GATE... You can leave a voicemail, I guess, even though no one ever does.

03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:14.000
Or you can email us. Mailbag at orangelandsradio.com or tweet us twitter.com slash O-L-R.

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:20.000
That's it. We're here at the close of the show. We're done with Last Minute Stories.

03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:23.000
But before we go tonight, I do want to thank our listeners once again.

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:27.000
I know I did this after the break, but I like to, at the end of every show, say thank you guys very much for listening.

03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:30.000
Thanks for tuning in. Support independent broadcasting.

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:34.000
If you like what you heard here at Orange Lawns Radio tonight, we don't charge for the show.

03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:41.000
Just tell a friend or 5 or 20 about the show. Help spread the word about Orange Lawns Radio. It is much, much appreciated.

03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:48.000
Leave us a nice review is always appreciated, too. iTunes, Stitcher, or wherever you heard about this show.

03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:52.000
Help spread the word, because word of mouth is all we got.

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:56.000
Jason, speaking of mouths, thank you for loaning yours to the show tonight.

03:03:56.000 --> 03:04:00.000
That sounds a little awkward, but thank you very much for being here. I really appreciate it.

03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:03.000
Do you have anything you want to plug while you're here?

03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:07.000
I... not specifically. Not really of my own anymore.

03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:09.000
I mean, this is kind of my focus, and otherwise...

03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:13.000
Do you have a Twitter or some ego site if you have fans that want to follow you?

03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.000
VXJsonXV, practically everywhere.

03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.000
There you go. Practically everywhere.

03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:20.000
Alright, thank you very much for being here, Jason. I'm sure we'll be seeing...

03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:25.000
You said you're going to be here in San Francisco through the holidays, so we might be seeing more of you in the coming weeks.

03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:28.000
You're always welcome here at Studio OLR. Thanks for being here.

03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:30.000
I will certainly take you up on that.

03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:34.000
Alright, sounds good. As I always ask people, do you have a final thought tonight on the show?

03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:41.000
No. Get this podcast up so I can re-listen to it for the two-hour drive back to San Francisco.

03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:46.000
I will work on it, but tonight I'm going to have the YouTube challenge too, so we'll see.

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:52.000
I've been here. I also have a backlog of like 30 hours of music podcasts that I have to get there to.

03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:56.000
Well, you know, support whatever independent podcast you can think of. I'm sure this isn't the only one you listen to.

03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:58.000
Yes, absolutely.

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:01.000
Of course, I'm quick to recommend those at vognetwork.com.

03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:03.000
You can always listen to the video game Bang.

03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:08.000
That's right. There's a new one for you to try. Tell me how it is. I haven't listened to it yet, but I will.

03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:14.000
Alright. Loki, thank you as always for being here, even though, you know, you don't have a choice.

03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:17.000
But any final thoughts for us tonight?

03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:19.000
Uh, tornadoes suck.

03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:24.000
Is that a cookie clicker thing?

03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:26.000
No, no. It's a real thing.

03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:28.000
I hope everybody's okay.

03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:35.000
I mentioned on Twitter, my company I work for, their warehouse is going to hit by a tornado.

03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:38.000
Yeah, I saw that earlier in the week. That's so awful.

03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:40.000
Is that the Ohio stuff?

03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:44.000
Yeah, there was a lot of really unfortunate stuff in the Midwest this week.

03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:53.000
Three damaged PS4s out of the whole thing got crushed by the roof. Well, damaged by the roof.

03:05:53.000 --> 03:06:00.000
The roof fell on the whole pallet of them, and I'm trying again to send them to me.

03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:02.000
I'll fix them.

03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:07.000
Between three systems, I'm sure there's enough parts, if not to get at least one of those working.

03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:08.000
Fix it, Loki.

03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:13.000
Besides, I mean, the insurance is covering the cost of those anyways. It's not like they're losing money.

03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:15.000
They're just going to throw them away anyways.

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:17.000
Alright, and last but not least, my final thought tonight.

03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:23.000
And my final thought would be, you know what, I know there's been a lot of positivity and negativity on tonight's show,

03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:28.000
and there is a lot out there in the gaming industry, but there's a lot of good stuff going on right now.

03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:35.000
So whether you're Team Wii, Team Sony, Team Xbox, or what have you, just go have fun.

03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:39.000
There's like a million games to play right now. It's the best time of year to be a gamer. Have fun.

03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:40.000
Team PC.

03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:42.000
Team Wii.

03:06:42.000 --> 03:06:43.000
Shut up.

03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:46.000
Whatever team you're on, have fun, and don't be a dick.

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:52.000
We'll see you next week. Have a safe holiday, those of you in the US, and we'll talk to you again in seven days.

03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:53.000
Have a wonderful night. Bye.

03:06:53.000 --> 03:06:57.000
