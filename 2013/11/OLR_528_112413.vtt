WEBVTT

00:14.198 --> 00:17.460
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot on the heels of the PlayStation 4, Microsoft releases the Xbox One Million.

00:17.660 --> 00:19.561
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Xbox releases the Microsoft One.

00:19.721 --> 00:21.842
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, millionaires buy one Xbox.

00:22.462 --> 00:23.043
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean.

00:23.303 --> 00:24.463
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't, just stay tuned.

00:24.603 --> 00:27.185
[SPEAKER_03]: This, Nintendo, and all your comments begin right now.

00:31.854 --> 00:36.797
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.857 --> 00:43.741
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 528 for this November the 24th of 2013.

00:45.802 --> 00:53.506
[SPEAKER_05]: You're here and we're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and it's me, Rob Roberts, and my co-hosts,

00:53.946 --> 00:56.529
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:10.104 --> 01:13.346
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm back playing cookie clicker again, I guess.

01:13.606 --> 01:14.987
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you swore that off last week.

01:15.007 --> 01:17.108
[SPEAKER_06]: I did, but then I realized you can prestige in it.

01:17.329 --> 01:22.292
[SPEAKER_06]: So you get, you know, I guess you get some, like, heavenly chips or some bullshit.

01:22.312 --> 01:23.792
[SPEAKER_05]: You got sucked right back in.

01:24.413 --> 01:26.334
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just because I have nothing better to do right now.

01:26.414 --> 01:27.515
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you an achievement whore?

01:27.535 --> 01:27.995
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what this is?

01:28.055 --> 01:28.816
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

01:47.671 --> 01:53.354
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, joining us here tonight, helping to fill in for hosts since we are down DarkSakura tonight.

01:53.974 --> 01:55.715
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys should be familiar with this guy by now.

01:55.875 --> 01:57.295
[SPEAKER_05]: After all, he is the voice of the show.

01:57.415 --> 01:58.776
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello to Jason!

01:58.976 --> 02:01.797
[SPEAKER_03]: I may not be the happiest bunny on the farm, but I certainly am the gassiest.

02:02.478 --> 02:03.698
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.700
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:29.990 --> 02:32.932
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but now it's everywhere, so we don't really do that anymore.

02:33.232 --> 02:34.933
[SPEAKER_05]: But how are you, Gassy Bunny?

02:35.253 --> 02:37.574
[SPEAKER_05]: I am... You better watch out or you'll get that nickname.

02:37.835 --> 02:38.395
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, probably.

02:39.115 --> 02:39.496
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

02:39.856 --> 02:41.437
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm quite exhausted.

02:41.677 --> 02:42.337
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

02:42.857 --> 02:50.181
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a surprisingly non-gamey, but still kind of gamey, but also lots of movement in the literal sense this week.

02:50.402 --> 02:50.602
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?

02:50.902 --> 02:51.042
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

02:51.162 --> 02:53.023
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, you've been traveling around everywhere, right?

02:53.143 --> 02:54.264
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of travel, yeah.

02:54.744 --> 02:57.527
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

03:15.965 --> 03:17.387
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we allowed to say where you work on air?

03:17.587 --> 03:19.470
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure I've said it once or twice.

03:19.530 --> 03:21.513
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a pretty cool company a lot of people have heard of, I'm sure.

03:22.173 --> 03:27.601
[SPEAKER_03]: I work for GitHub down there in San Francisco, which is my excuse for coming into town constantly.

03:27.861 --> 03:30.164
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't hurt that it's on their dime.

03:30.304 --> 03:33.048
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, why not come out to Sacramento too?

03:33.208 --> 03:34.029
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't mind at all.

03:34.129 --> 03:34.610
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't mind at all.

03:49.447 --> 03:59.117
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if things aren't open source and you're doing the active development in private, GitHub still applies because it's the entire suite of collaboration.

03:59.758 --> 04:08.147
[SPEAKER_03]: And even people that are not developers, issues managers, people that just need to go in for reviews and need to be a part of the process, it's all applicable to them as well.

04:08.927 --> 04:10.348
[SPEAKER_03]: Open source, public, private, whatever.

04:11.189 --> 04:11.609
[SPEAKER_03]: It all works out.

04:11.669 --> 04:13.770
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the act of development and collaboration.

04:13.830 --> 04:17.793
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I do learn things from reading source code, even though I don't totally understand it.

04:17.973 --> 04:22.656
[SPEAKER_05]: At work, there's a lot of Visual Basic tied into Microsoft Office, like macros and things like that.

04:22.716 --> 04:25.397
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually did talk about this before, and you made that exact point.

04:25.777 --> 04:33.262
[SPEAKER_03]: Any macros or anything Visual Basic-based could... Well, you know, after 520 episodes, some topics repeat themselves once in a while.

04:33.302 --> 04:34.743
[SPEAKER_03]: 100 episodes ago, you know...

04:36.685 --> 04:42.189
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, okay, I don't know if I've talked about this, but I will use this as an opportunity to give a cheap plug to my YouTube channel.

04:42.390 --> 04:43.871
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I've been using that more and more, right?

04:43.971 --> 04:46.373
[SPEAKER_05]: My Rob Roberts plays and do my Let's Remember videos.

04:46.713 --> 04:49.095
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the games I did this week, Dragonfire on the Atari 2600.

04:49.335 --> 04:50.075
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you ever play this game?

04:50.276 --> 04:50.736
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not.

04:50.756 --> 04:52.377
[SPEAKER_03]: We run across the bridge, run through the treasure room.

04:52.397 --> 04:53.278
[SPEAKER_03]: Practically all of the Atari.

04:53.698 --> 04:54.559
[SPEAKER_05]: You're probably too young.

04:55.920 --> 05:01.787
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason why I bring that game up specifically is that the guy actually released the source code.

05:01.907 --> 05:04.930
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go to AtariAge.com and check out the source code for Dragonfire.

05:05.571 --> 05:08.273
[SPEAKER_05]: I find those Atari 2600 source codes amazing.

05:08.614 --> 05:14.320
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand it whatsoever, but the cool thing about Dragonfire in particular is that it's all commented.

05:14.600 --> 05:18.763
[SPEAKER_05]: Like here is the code that shows the sprite for the chalice, you know, something like that.

05:19.063 --> 05:30.489
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you can actually kind of see like, wow, this is like when they have to cram all this crap into 4K, 4 kilobytes or 8 kilobytes were like the average Atari 2600 size if you think about it.

05:30.509 --> 05:32.631
[SPEAKER_05]: 4 kilobytes, that's nothing.

05:33.294 --> 05:37.716
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a... I write Word documents that are like 200 kilobytes easy.

05:38.076 --> 05:38.416
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy!

05:38.636 --> 05:43.138
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because there's more background data in a Word document that there is actual text that you type into it.

05:43.258 --> 05:43.578
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

05:43.799 --> 05:46.700
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is a similar feat, as a matter of fact, for the classic game of the week.

05:47.400 --> 05:52.782
[SPEAKER_03]: A similar feat of how in the hell did they do this back in the day with such restricted file sizes and everything else.

05:53.663 --> 05:53.803
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

05:54.483 --> 05:55.044
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, very cool.

05:55.084 --> 05:58.610
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, we digressed a little bit there, but I find the source code stuff really fascinating.

05:58.950 --> 06:01.154
[SPEAKER_05]: I also want to introduce our chat room, of course.

06:01.214 --> 06:02.956
[SPEAKER_05]: We always have our live chatters with us.

06:03.197 --> 06:09.387
[SPEAKER_05]: We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network.

06:09.847 --> 06:36.889
[SPEAKER_05]: VOG Network.com and you can join us if you are listening live in our chat room live.vognetwork.com our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf in fact starts us off tonight because I love this comment here he says the source code to Pac-Man on Atari 2600 is a piece of art even though everyone considers it a terrible game to play well yes Pac-Man on the Atari 2600 was really garbage but if you think about the time constraints the guy had to work with it's really astonishing

06:37.549 --> 06:39.550
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like, yeah, it does some weird shit.

06:39.570 --> 06:43.193
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, the fact that the ghost can only draw one, like, it has to cycle.

06:43.433 --> 06:44.414
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why the ghosts blink.

06:44.694 --> 06:47.796
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it can't, like, the Atari 2600 literally cannot draw all of them at once.

06:48.157 --> 06:51.399
[SPEAKER_05]: So it draws these two in one frame, these two in, or maybe one each frame.

06:51.419 --> 06:52.179
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember what it does.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.961
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's crazy shit to get it to work.

06:54.981 --> 06:56.282
[SPEAKER_05]: And he had to do it in mere months.

06:56.723 --> 07:00.445
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what fucked up a lot of those Atari 2600 games, is that they had no time.

07:01.166 --> 07:02.347
[SPEAKER_05]: E.T., same story.

07:02.367 --> 07:02.807
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

07:03.347 --> 07:06.169
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there were maybe some other decisions along with E.T.

07:06.289 --> 07:13.954
[SPEAKER_03]: as well, but not to digress yet again on another detailed... I could talk about old shit all day long.

07:14.094 --> 07:19.778
[SPEAKER_05]: And considering that I have not bought the Xbox One or the PlayStation 4 yet, I'd prefer to focus on the old stuff.

07:19.998 --> 07:31.795
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the 7th guest and the 11th hour that are in a really similar state that because they were made in that Windows 95, DOS, transitional kind of world where the modern... What are the words that I'm even looking for?

07:32.556 --> 07:36.061
[SPEAKER_03]: The modern conveniences in libraries and DirectX didn't exist yet.

07:36.562 --> 07:59.021
[SPEAKER_03]: and in order to be widely compatible with all the hardware that was blossoming in the Windows era the developer had to do these really, really, really nasty low-level assembly tricks to just eke out that last bit of performance for all of the visuals and the smooth video and everything that that game employed alongside Myst and Riven as well just to take something that is

08:00.931 --> 08:04.272
[SPEAKER_03]: Still images with depth and the transitions and everything else.

08:05.273 --> 08:09.414
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, human ingenuity and what computers have done for the last decade is unreal.

08:09.574 --> 08:13.816
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, there is a way to kind of tie all this talk into what's going on with the new consoles.

08:13.836 --> 08:18.738
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we were listening to Bobby's show here in studio and just the general talk as well out there on the internet.

08:19.058 --> 08:27.601
[SPEAKER_05]: I know one of the topics that came up on Bobby's show tonight was the fact that some of the launch games that you have right now kind of look like they could be done on current consoles.

08:27.901 --> 08:28.502
[SPEAKER_05]: Dead Rising 3 Dead Rising 3

08:51.202 --> 08:58.243
[SPEAKER_06]: People have the expectation, because last gen, well, even before last gen began, or this gen, I'm getting confused which gen we're on now.

09:00.504 --> 09:06.665
[SPEAKER_06]: This gen, I guess, they were talking about, oh, yeah, 1080p, it's going to be 60 frames per second.

09:07.145 --> 09:10.606
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the next gen, okay, that's how we're going to differentiate ourselves.

09:10.646 --> 09:13.546
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be higher resolutions, better frame rates, and stuff like that.

09:13.866 --> 09:18.127
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have Dead Rising 3 come out, that 720p running at 30 frames per second.

09:18.807 --> 09:23.352
[SPEAKER_06]: and it chugs and there's like long ass load screens.

09:23.712 --> 09:25.694
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, dude, what the hell?

09:25.854 --> 09:31.019
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you could have done this shit on an Xbox 360 and had the same kind of results.

09:31.359 --> 09:36.444
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, why are there games out now that have higher frame rates, look better and you can't pull this shit off on next gen?

09:36.644 --> 09:40.827
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, because, and to tie it into what Jason was just talking about, it's learning the tricks.

09:41.147 --> 09:46.071
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think there's still a lot of tricks that the developers are going to have to learn with these consoles.

09:46.211 --> 09:51.455
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll see it in about a year where these games start to look better and better.

09:52.156 --> 09:54.858
[SPEAKER_05]: You even see it with the current-gen stuff.

09:55.738 --> 09:58.320
[SPEAKER_05]: What's a really good-looking game that came out in the past year?

09:59.061 --> 10:01.783
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like Tomb Raider, let's say, looks fantastic.

10:02.062 --> 10:02.803
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

10:22.606 --> 10:36.751
[SPEAKER_06]: I am still bugged at the fact that, you know, and this I guess is even the same situation with, you know, the Xbox 360 when it launched that they want people to spend money on these systems and they haven't really shown what's different about these systems.

10:37.152 --> 10:41.913
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, cool, so the Xbox One can display more zombies on screen, but the game still runs like shit.

10:42.194 --> 10:51.157
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, why don't you, I don't know, instead of pumping out a thousand zombies on the screen, maybe do 500 and then the frame rate's better.

10:51.457 --> 10:52.398
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11:14.491 --> 11:14.811
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

11:14.972 --> 11:19.658
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I never had a problem with there being too few zombies in Dead Rising games, to be honest.

11:19.718 --> 11:23.582
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't really know why it's an issue.

11:23.743 --> 11:24.864
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you being a little harsh?

11:24.884 --> 11:27.888
[SPEAKER_05]: Because DKB in the chatroom says, Runs like shit, really?

11:28.168 --> 11:28.989
[SPEAKER_05]: And even I have to go.

11:29.169 --> 11:29.470
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

11:29.770 --> 11:31.773
[SPEAKER_05]: Real... Isn't that a little harsh?

11:31.933 --> 11:33.134
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 30 frames per second.

11:34.216 --> 11:38.000
[SPEAKER_06]: 30 frames per second, you know, with... Once again, I have an expectation.

11:38.020 --> 11:46.211
[SPEAKER_06]: If they want me to spend $500 on a new console, then I better see some... I better see a fucking difference between this gen and next gen.

11:46.591 --> 11:48.532
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see... They have to wow me.

11:48.552 --> 11:49.513
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to sell it to me.

11:50.093 --> 11:58.357
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, if they're showing me a game that looks like Dead Rising 2, but, oh, the map's slightly bigger this time, and, oh, there's some more zombies, I don't fucking care.

11:58.397 --> 11:59.518
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not buying that system.

11:59.578 --> 12:11.624
[SPEAKER_05]: To be fair, and to be devil's advocate a little bit here, didn't we kind of know that going into this round of consoles that they weren't going to be pushing the graphical envelope and all this as much because there's not a lot more you can do.

12:12.404 --> 12:13.485
[SPEAKER_05]: with the current TVs.

12:13.565 --> 12:17.188
[SPEAKER_05]: Intel 4K TVs are the standard, which we don't even know if that will be.

12:17.508 --> 12:20.671
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's not a lot else to do visually.

12:20.971 --> 12:32.141
[SPEAKER_05]: When we were talking PlayStation 2 to PlayStation 3, the entire world was in the process, well, at least this country and probably most of the rest of the world, was transitioning between SDTV and HDTV.

12:32.181 --> 12:33.362
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that was a huge jump.

12:33.542 --> 12:47.191
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I understand that, but we've had a whole generation of games that have been running at 720p and now with hardware that's definitely a lot better than this current generation systems, and they can't fucking pull out 1080p native?

12:48.251 --> 12:49.052
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, and...

12:49.652 --> 13:10.606
[SPEAKER_06]: and a decent frame rate I mean shit Rise runs at 30 frames per second if you're lucky it's locked in there or they even did dumbass shit with Need for Speed Rivals where even on PC it's fucking locked at 30 frames per second you try to unlock it and the game goes crazy because it's just the way they did their physics or something in the game it's just all messed up

13:11.306 --> 13:17.408
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my problem though, is that they are... Once again, there's no... And I think this is going to be a problem with these consoles.

13:17.548 --> 13:18.209
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no hook.

13:18.549 --> 13:19.889
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no hook to get me in there.

13:20.170 --> 13:24.371
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas with the Wii, it took off because it was a new way to play games.

13:25.732 --> 13:26.692
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft's trying to sell it.

13:26.732 --> 13:28.093
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Kinect is important.

13:29.273 --> 13:31.435
[SPEAKER_06]: But it doesn't really do a whole ton.

13:32.035 --> 13:38.560
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, it's like these fucking promises that they made when Kinect originally came out and we're seeing the same shit not quite work right again.

13:39.261 --> 13:41.442
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, well, we're going to patch it.

13:41.462 --> 13:42.243
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to get better.

13:42.583 --> 13:45.745
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it didn't fucking get better with the original Kinect.

13:46.006 --> 13:47.287
[SPEAKER_06]: And same with Smart Glass stuff.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.309
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen how they've really implemented these second screen things other than

13:50.609 --> 13:51.349
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

14:08.136 --> 14:15.618
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to figure out where your head's at right now with these new consoles because you're coming off to me right now more negative than I kind of thought you were at.

14:15.978 --> 14:29.321
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of thought you were in a similar place that I was at where, okay, you might not be on board with Xbox One and PlayStation 4 right now because the games aren't really there to substantiate the several hundred dollars purchase, but I kind of thought you'd be jumping on board a year or two from now.

14:29.461 --> 14:30.021
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I wrong?

14:30.041 --> 14:30.121
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

14:31.201 --> 14:36.228
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, maybe if there's some better games come out that actually show off the hardware.

14:37.049 --> 14:42.636
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now, there's not really anything coming out that's going to be like that.

14:42.696 --> 14:45.018
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it just all seems like promises right now.

14:45.319 --> 14:48.062
[SPEAKER_06]: That we're getting a lot of promised things and...

14:50.169 --> 14:50.670
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

14:50.790 --> 14:51.530
[SPEAKER_06]: It just promises.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.072
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, even like, look at these launches.

14:53.232 --> 14:54.153
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pathetic.

14:54.473 --> 14:58.316
[SPEAKER_06]: The amount of features that aren't in there that are going to be patched in later on.

14:58.776 --> 15:00.078
[SPEAKER_06]: It just screams rushed.

15:00.318 --> 15:01.719
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole thing screams rushed.

15:01.779 --> 15:05.882
[SPEAKER_06]: It really, these consoles should have come out six months from now and not now.

15:07.644 --> 15:09.626
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why bother rushing everything.

15:10.286 --> 15:13.209
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess because you have to react to the other, you know...

15:13.709 --> 15:14.870
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the holidays too.

15:15.311 --> 15:15.691
[SPEAKER_06]: So what?

15:15.991 --> 15:16.532
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter.

15:16.572 --> 15:17.553
[SPEAKER_06]: The holidays don't matter.

15:18.494 --> 15:21.577
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on now.

15:21.677 --> 15:24.480
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the holidays don't matter as far as selling these consoles.

15:24.520 --> 15:29.726
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll sell a million consoles regardless of the... Are these people really saving them for the holidays?

15:29.826 --> 15:34.551
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, maybe a small percentage of them, but put it out six months from now and people would still be buying them.

15:35.231 --> 15:37.293
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, fiscal year performance is important too.

15:37.673 --> 15:45.718
[SPEAKER_05]: And you and I both know you're going to sell more consoles, way more consoles between October and December than you're going to sell between January and March, which is the end of the fiscal year.

15:46.159 --> 15:50.602
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, in that sense, it's logical, right?

15:51.132 --> 15:51.873
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

16:08.693 --> 16:24.341
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not picking one up anytime soon because there's no games on there that I'm really interested in and so far everything they've shown they haven't really changed anything it's all the same shit that they're pulling right now on the current gen consoles and to be honest there's more games coming out in current gen anyways

16:25.482 --> 16:33.648
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see some significant differences between Assassin's Creed 4 on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3.

16:34.468 --> 16:41.973
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell, even when Titanfall comes out, I kind of want to see what they're going to do as far as the Xbox 360 version.

16:41.993 --> 16:45.715
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see how different that is compared to the Xbox One version.

16:46.636 --> 16:51.442
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I need to see what these vast differences are in order for me to, you know, justify me in purchasing.

16:51.462 --> 16:57.410
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, to be honest, I mean, might as well just dump that $500 into a PC because at least those games are going to be running at a higher resolution than 720p.

16:59.531 --> 17:07.954
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I don't know, I think you might be being a little too harsh, but I also understand the frustrations, you know, I get it.

17:07.994 --> 17:11.895
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, live.vognetwork.com, it is the show where every gamer has a voice.

17:12.435 --> 17:18.717
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwolf, wanting to challenge you on one of these points here, saying they rush it because gamers don't want to wait.

17:19.078 --> 17:21.678
[SPEAKER_05]: How much did you complain when Grand Theft Auto V was delayed?

17:22.519 --> 17:23.139
[SPEAKER_05]: It was worth it.

17:25.157 --> 17:25.817
[SPEAKER_06]: It was worth it.

17:26.237 --> 17:27.718
[SPEAKER_06]: And let me be honest.

17:27.838 --> 17:29.018
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me be honest with Grand Theft Auto 5.

17:29.558 --> 17:33.419
[SPEAKER_06]: Grand Theft Auto 5 has a lot more content than some of these other fucking next-gen games.

17:33.739 --> 17:37.720
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be a horrible, irresponsible person if I did not ask this question.

17:37.980 --> 17:43.782
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you be sitting here a year from now going, it was worth it for Xbox One?

17:45.345 --> 17:47.826
[SPEAKER_05]: when that Grand Theft Auto 6 or whatever happens.

17:47.846 --> 17:52.629
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't predict the future, and it's going to be Grand Theft Auto 5 again on next year is what it's going to be.

17:53.289 --> 17:55.350
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I can't predict the future.

17:55.430 --> 18:00.153
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I would like for them, I'd like to be wrong on these consoles.

18:00.193 --> 18:11.078
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, honestly, I would, but as we're going to get into later on, there's some things that we've complained about, like, dude, it's a fucking $60 game, and you're treating it like a free-to-play game.

18:12.179 --> 18:13.140
[SPEAKER_06]: And shit's not going away.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.001
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only getting worse.

18:14.382 --> 18:24.814
[SPEAKER_06]: And so why should I buy into these brand new consoles if they're just going to turn them into some sort of sieve for me to just basically take more money from me?

18:26.476 --> 18:28.459
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to have something to really sell me on it.

18:28.479 --> 18:31.002
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, Kinect 2.0 was supposed to be so...

18:32.363 --> 18:54.450
[SPEAKER_05]: integral to you know the Xbox experience and aside from voice commands and shit for I don't really fucking care about voice commands okay yeah that's cool and all but um I hear I mean I don't know again there's a lot of mixed opinions out there but I'm hearing that people really are enjoying the interface once they finally get down there in there and use it that the whole like you know screen and screen stuff and and all that kind of kind of works pretty good

18:55.891 --> 19:14.591
[SPEAKER_06]: I still don't... For me, the screen and screen stuff, once again, you're telling me that it's important for me to have a tablet so I can do the second screen stuff, so why do I need a little tiny sliver of my screen when I can do the same shit on my tablet that's right in front of me because you're having me use this tablet to play the games as well.

19:15.051 --> 19:16.272
[SPEAKER_05]: Except for Grand Theft Auto 5.

19:39.265 --> 19:41.548
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, eventually.

19:41.628 --> 19:42.309
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming.

19:42.329 --> 19:45.632
[SPEAKER_06]: They already have PC documentation inside.

19:45.712 --> 19:45.932
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

19:46.213 --> 19:48.035
[SPEAKER_05]: We got into a kickoff topic anyway.

19:48.295 --> 19:50.798
[SPEAKER_05]: I originally wanted to talk about the Xbox One's launch.

19:51.158 --> 19:52.660
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to talk about those sales figures.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.583
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, Loki, do you want to kind of go over the sales figures?

19:55.623 --> 19:57.785
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, as Bobby said, they're trying to make some money.

19:58.065 --> 19:59.507
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like they did after all, right, Loki?

19:59.747 --> 20:00.688
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they did pretty well.

20:02.470 --> 20:10.977
[SPEAKER_06]: Both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One sold a million units, or they're phrasing it as over a million units.

20:12.459 --> 20:17.644
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying not to sound biased here, but I really fucking hate PR speak.

20:18.084 --> 20:23.849
[SPEAKER_06]: I got down on Activision about Call of Duty and their one million units ship bullshit and stuff.

20:24.810 --> 20:31.474
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they sold a million units worldwide versus one million units North America for the PlayStation 4.

20:32.175 --> 20:32.935
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey, you know what?

20:33.315 --> 20:34.536
[SPEAKER_06]: No one's knocking a million units.

20:34.556 --> 20:39.719
[SPEAKER_06]: A million units of a console within 24 hours is fantastic.

20:40.019 --> 20:41.360
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I have to say this.

20:41.500 --> 20:42.181
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Loki.

20:42.221 --> 20:43.021
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of interrupting.

20:43.061 --> 20:46.703
[SPEAKER_05]: But Tech2030 in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Fuck this.

20:47.044 --> 20:49.445
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just not buy any of them and only play Cookie Clicker.

20:49.585 --> 20:50.265
[SPEAKER_03]: And 66% of the room is...

20:52.827 --> 20:53.490
I'm multitasking.

20:58.092 --> 21:02.415
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, and I have my phone off, Jason, because mine will produce cookies while it's not on.

21:02.475 --> 21:03.055
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyway.

21:03.716 --> 21:04.536
[SPEAKER_05]: All joking aside.

21:05.637 --> 21:07.298
[SPEAKER_05]: So, one million on both consoles.

21:07.358 --> 21:08.799
[SPEAKER_05]: But, okay, I have to go there.

21:08.879 --> 21:10.660
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not trying to knock Xbox.

21:10.700 --> 21:12.461
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm going to be real with you guys.

21:12.822 --> 21:19.926
[SPEAKER_05]: Based on all that internet stuff and all the rabble-rabble angry mobs we saw six months ago, I wasn't expecting Xbox One to do that well.

21:20.206 --> 21:20.987
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yay for them.

21:21.167 --> 21:23.128
[SPEAKER_05]: I think competition is healthy across the board.

21:23.449 --> 21:23.889
[SPEAKER_05]: However...

21:24.409 --> 21:29.413
[SPEAKER_05]: It is worth pointing out, Xbox One might have sold a million, but they did it in, what, 13 countries?

21:29.433 --> 21:31.215
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas PlayStation 4 was only U.S.

21:31.255 --> 21:31.935
[SPEAKER_05]: and Canada, right?

21:32.095 --> 21:36.679
[SPEAKER_06]: I still think it's very skewed as far as, you know, it's good for day one.

21:36.839 --> 21:38.801
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get me wrong, it's good for day one.

21:38.841 --> 21:49.289
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're going to play the console wars here, you have to understand that we're talking a couple countries versus basically all their launch territories at once.

21:49.329 --> 21:51.411
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not like doom and gloom for Xbox.

21:51.451 --> 21:52.012
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not at all.

21:52.032 --> 21:52.552
[SPEAKER_05]: Far from it.

21:52.632 --> 21:53.012
[SPEAKER_06]: Not at all.

21:53.233 --> 22:02.481
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the end of the day, once they do finally launch in all their countries or whatever, I think you're going to see a significant number more PlayStation 4s than you are the Xbox One.

22:02.521 --> 22:05.224
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I don't think they've still recovered completely from...

22:07.066 --> 22:29.422
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just the price I think at the end of the day for a lot of people I mean not the ones listening to this podcast or participating I think the folks you know active gamers participating in this kind of have a lot more issues to juggle but I think for a lot of people for a lot of parents sitting there going what do I buy for my teenage son or daughter which oh this one's cheaper I'm gonna get that I think for a lot of people that's what it's gonna come down to

22:29.642 --> 22:30.182
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

22:52.870 --> 22:54.951
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's certainly applicable in the broader sense.

22:54.991 --> 23:06.538
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still massive legions of people, parents that aren't into gaming, and they do add up to that majority of the people that would have gotten the console for their child, teen, anything along those lines.

23:06.818 --> 23:10.240
[SPEAKER_05]: And when it comes to the parents, I don't think you can totally count out Wii U either.

23:10.839 --> 23:11.459
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not at all.

23:11.479 --> 23:13.380
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they have some good games on there.

23:14.781 --> 23:16.442
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you like Nintendo games, it's good.

23:16.842 --> 23:17.602
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii is going to be great.

23:17.662 --> 23:24.066
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're looking for other games from other companies, you may be having some issues.

23:24.986 --> 23:26.127
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll come back to this later.

23:26.907 --> 23:36.131
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm just saying, though, as far as Nintendo games go, yeah, it's fantastic because a lot of people look forward to Nintendo games on those consoles.

23:36.231 --> 23:37.032
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just...

23:40.399 --> 24:00.318
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know they're kind of in their own thing they don't even want to compete in this next gen and that's why I always kind of laugh when they show okay the next generation is starting they show the Wii I'm like yeah okay whatever but it's just I don't know it'll be interesting to see what happens with all these consoles and stuff but it's just it's a rocky start I think

24:01.588 --> 24:08.678
[SPEAKER_05]: Doom Plague in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says Wii U currently has better games than either new console, just probably not for long.

24:09.018 --> 24:15.367
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a very good yes, I agree with you point because I would agree.

24:15.507 --> 24:18.972
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Wii U right now has better games than either one of those consoles.

24:19.432 --> 24:22.254
[SPEAKER_05]: But are we going to be able to say the same a year from now?

24:22.474 --> 24:22.994
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

24:23.134 --> 24:26.076
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you're going to get some heavy, heavy hitters next year.

24:26.496 --> 24:29.757
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine, you know, we already know there's going to be Destiny, Titanfall.

24:30.138 --> 24:33.679
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine Microsoft's going to push out their new Halo for next holiday.

24:33.759 --> 24:35.340
[SPEAKER_05]: Or at least, you know, you're going to see a lot on that.

24:35.761 --> 24:40.543
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony, I don't know what they're... They'll probably have a new LittleBigPlanet or something.

24:40.623 --> 24:42.184
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got plenty of stuff they can rely on.

24:42.364 --> 24:46.286
[SPEAKER_03]: All of those games that they had to delay into first or second quarter 2015 that we've been talking about.

24:46.326 --> 24:48.347
[SPEAKER_03]: Uncharted 4 is coming.

24:48.507 --> 25:13.219
[SPEAKER_05]: and then so Nintendo's challenge is going to really be how are they going to stay afloat without all the third party support but they will throw out a new Zelda on Wii U next year I think we're all anticipating that if they don't honestly if they don't do a Zelda on Wii U next year there's going to be a lot of people that are disappointed that's the reality where we're at right now and Smash Brothers

25:13.760 --> 25:20.922
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo has a big 2014 for its namesake titles as does the rollout of the Xbox One and PS4 even Smash Bros.

25:21.002 --> 25:41.589
[SPEAKER_05]: I was kind of excited about it for the Wii and stuff but the new one just doesn't really it's kind of like hey look it's the same characters we had last time don't knock it until you see it a little more in motion I don't think we've really seen I mean yes we've had some teasers but you haven't seen the game really in motion getting your hands on it and all that and I think there's a lot to come with that

25:41.989 --> 26:07.101
[SPEAKER_05]: I think back to the Wii one when it was in development you know there was a big difference between the early early stages and hearing about the characters and then like really getting to play that thing you know those Smash Brothers games have a lot of depth to them and there's so much in the in the regards to the unlockables collectibles and all that stuff I just I I really hope they don't rush this Wii U one but it's been in development a hell of a long time so I would think we're gonna be ready in 2014 but we'll see

26:08.081 --> 26:13.785
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyhow, I think that's enough of our kickoff topic of Xbox One and everything else going on.

26:14.265 --> 26:19.548
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk a little more specifically about what you yourself have been doing in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week?

26:19.808 --> 26:22.770
[SPEAKER_05]: I would usually let ladies go first, but we don't have any tonight.

26:22.850 --> 26:25.432
[SPEAKER_05]: But Jason, since you are sitting in Jamie's chair, go for it.

26:25.472 --> 26:26.412
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your gaming week?

26:26.912 --> 26:28.694
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been playing a lot of real-life the game.

26:29.074 --> 26:34.737
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a epic training simulator and workout simulator and driving simulator and walking simulator.

26:34.757 --> 26:37.039
[SPEAKER_05]: You even sound like Jamie with that gaming week.

26:38.896 --> 26:46.343
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a really light couple of weeks because I, as I'm sure many people remember, I was here a couple episodes ago.

26:47.344 --> 26:51.207
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been to Arizona and back in that time I was training a new coworker this week.

26:52.889 --> 26:53.970
[SPEAKER_03]: Incredibly busy times.

26:54.310 --> 26:59.535
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm basically just grinding a little bit more, by which I mean getting completely obliterated by...

26:59.835 --> 27:02.437
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

27:18.668 --> 27:21.869
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't just come out last week, but I noticed within the past month or so.

27:21.929 --> 27:23.149
[SPEAKER_05]: Since the last time you were on, I think.

27:23.709 --> 27:35.112
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just casual grinding of games with a very defined start and end, and are also very friendly to just stop what I'm doing wherever I am with no penalty to speak of.

27:36.672 --> 27:40.813
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's honestly really about all I've had time for this past week.

27:41.107 --> 27:41.507
[SPEAKER_05]: Dexter Dexter

28:03.257 --> 28:07.379
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just trying to take a break from Grand Theft Auto for a little bit.

28:07.499 --> 28:12.842
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go back into it, obviously, really soon.

28:14.163 --> 28:18.165
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, I know the new Steam sale is coming up soon, and I'm like...

28:19.417 --> 28:20.097
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

28:49.652 --> 28:50.512
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry, yeah, yeah.

28:50.952 --> 28:53.153
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, you can get all that.

28:54.473 --> 28:54.994
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked that up.

28:55.014 --> 28:57.654
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't played it yet, but I was very excited to see that in there.

28:57.874 --> 29:01.035
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't recall all the details, but I stumbled across something the other day.

29:01.235 --> 29:03.376
[SPEAKER_03]: It was basically a make-your-own Humble Bundle.

29:04.776 --> 29:06.077
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they launched the store now.

29:06.197 --> 29:08.337
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of different websites that have it.

29:08.397 --> 29:13.719
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've seen the improvements that Humble Bundle has been rolling out in that regard, but I thought it was something unique.

29:13.979 --> 29:14.279
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

29:15.899 --> 29:16.119
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.

29:16.360 --> 29:18.363
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I came across it.

29:18.383 --> 29:21.608
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I don't have time and I don't have money.

29:21.688 --> 29:21.988
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

29:22.048 --> 29:23.570
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I didn't take in enough of the details.

29:24.204 --> 29:24.664
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Loki.

29:24.805 --> 29:28.107
[SPEAKER_06]: No, there's a bunch of different Humble Bundle-esque sites.

29:29.288 --> 29:30.509
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one of them that does that.

29:31.030 --> 29:32.231
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

29:32.511 --> 29:33.732
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, so that's pretty much that.

29:34.112 --> 29:39.477
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've just been messing around with Clicker today just because, I don't know, I'm just bored.

29:40.017 --> 29:48.264
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't start Fallout right now because it's in the middle of the show and this doesn't take any intelligence at all other than clicking a mouse.

29:48.384 --> 29:51.487
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, that's pretty much where I've been.

29:51.952 --> 29:54.475
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, I've been very busy with a couple new games.

29:54.795 --> 29:59.440
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing the usual stuff as well, including, you know, helping Alan and stuff.

29:59.861 --> 30:03.745
[SPEAKER_05]: But this Friday, obviously, was the release of the Xbox One.

30:04.085 --> 30:06.528
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel the same way about the one that I do about the PlayStation 4.

30:07.149 --> 30:08.730
[SPEAKER_05]: The games aren't there for me right now.

30:09.071 --> 30:12.555
[SPEAKER_05]: Next year, I'm probably going to have to pick up both because you're going to have things like...

30:13.415 --> 30:35.840
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XIV and Destiny on PlayStation 4 things I definitely want over there and then on Xbox One I'm sure they'll announce Forza Horizon 2 which will be enough for me to want to get an Xbox One so I'll get those in 2014 but for now being a Wii U owner I was very excited about the release of Super Mario 3D World on the Nintendo Wii and Wii U thank you yes Wii U

30:36.880 --> 31:02.259
[SPEAKER_05]: and I will tell you this the game delivers it's it's outstanding I I love it it's it's what you would kind of expect I don't think it really like to me it feels a lot different than 3d land on the 3ds did because obviously for one it's not really in 3d but for two I think just the larger screen the more diverse characters I feel like there's kind of more going on in each stage because of it

31:02.839 --> 31:10.631
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna tell you the thing I like most about Mario 3D World is the attention to detail and it's the little things that really make that game.

31:11.171 --> 31:18.222
[SPEAKER_05]: The things from you get really close to a Goomba and the Goomba spots you and makes angry Goomba face and starts charging at you.

31:18.742 --> 31:44.558
[SPEAKER_05]: or when you step on a turtle and there's that literal moment you can actually see the little koopa of the whole like where'd my pants go type of thing and running over to try to get the shell as fast as they can to the little sound when you walk on a glass you hear the clink clink clink clink when you're actually walking on glass pipes to when you're underwater the background music actually changes completely to when you come back above the water it goes back to where it was at to when you're kitty Mario

31:45.618 --> 32:11.085
[SPEAKER_05]: which really is the best thing ever that was a great power-up love it when you're climbing up a wall and you go as far as you can because you can't just climb the wall infinitely finally you get to a certain point where you can't climb anymore and they're just like they claw onto the wall and they start slipping and they leave little claw marks behind like as they're falling and look really sad like it's those little details that really do it for me and yeah I mean the level design obviously is great

32:11.605 --> 32:18.129
[SPEAKER_05]: There's things to collect in every level, so just because you beat it once doesn't mean you're going to collect all three green stars and the stamp and everything.

32:18.810 --> 32:21.531
[SPEAKER_05]: The social elements are very interesting.

32:21.571 --> 32:30.697
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we give Nintendo a hard time about not understanding online, but the way they've integrated Miiverse into this and the ghost Miis and everything is interesting.

32:32.718 --> 32:34.980
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in some ways it's kind of give or take.

32:35.680 --> 32:46.423
[SPEAKER_05]: But just to kind of give you an example, while you're walking around the world map, you'll see these random Miis on the map, and if you walk up to them, they'll have a little picture of something they wrote on Miiverse about that world.

32:47.003 --> 32:57.266
[SPEAKER_05]: When you beat a stage, you'll actually see, scrolling across the top of the screen, Miiverse posts from people who also played that stage and posted something about it on Miiverse.

32:57.906 --> 33:00.867
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll give you an example of how this can work, is that...

33:01.647 --> 33:03.949
[SPEAKER_05]: I was playing a level in World 3 not long ago.

33:04.009 --> 33:08.473
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a water level, and we all love water levels, but they're a necessary part of any Mario game, right?

33:08.873 --> 33:11.455
[SPEAKER_05]: And I couldn't find two of the stars in the level.

33:11.495 --> 33:13.397
[SPEAKER_05]: I could find the last one, but I couldn't find the first two.

33:13.837 --> 33:21.483
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I beat the level, it shows me all the Miiverse posts, and one of the first ones that comes up is, Where are the first and second stars?

33:21.543 --> 33:23.645
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, thank God it's not just me.

33:24.085 --> 33:25.627
[SPEAKER_05]: That was literally my reaction, right?

33:25.947 --> 33:28.809
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was kind of, I don't know, that was a neat reaction.

33:29.930 --> 33:44.617
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't think of that I get in any other game right now and I'm not saying it's like a huge deal or a game changer or OMG Nintendo's pushing the envelope but I will say that was a unique reaction that immediate instant feedback that I can't say I get anywhere else right now.

33:44.657 --> 33:48.178
[SPEAKER_03]: That instant attachment to another individual somewhere out there in the universe.

33:48.218 --> 33:48.818
[SPEAKER_05]: Me too!

33:49.259 --> 33:49.859
[SPEAKER_05]: Me too!

33:50.039 --> 33:53.480
[SPEAKER_05]: Stranger Danger 10357 or whatever your name is, right?

33:54.121 --> 33:59.243
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there was that instance where I did kind of feel like oh okay, so I'm not the only crazy one.

34:00.023 --> 34:16.669
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a very interesting case to think about the fact that, yeah, Nintendo is not necessarily getting the always-on, multi-world, MMO, universe-style network services, but they're pushing a really damn good community.

34:17.290 --> 34:20.351
[SPEAKER_03]: And as long as they keep up the moderator actions and filtering... It's moderated.

34:20.531 --> 34:21.891
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a moderated community.

34:22.532 --> 34:22.612
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

34:23.912 --> 34:31.515
[SPEAKER_05]: That works and it doesn't work because again, you know, we criticized Nintendo last week about the whole swap note thing, which I think was completely valid.

34:31.895 --> 34:34.616
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was ridiculous the way they threw the baby out with the bathwater with that.

34:35.036 --> 34:50.583
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, there's a difference between these type of public communications you have in a game like Mario, you know, Super Mario 3D World and the private communications where essentially if, you know, me and a friend are both over the age of 18, we should be able to send whatever we want because we could do it on an email anyway.

34:50.703 --> 34:50.843
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

34:50.983 --> 34:51.603
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so.

34:52.004 --> 34:58.407
[SPEAKER_03]: These emotions and expressions that they're capturing in the public eye is quite unique and very worthy and very fun to see.

34:59.777 --> 35:26.417
[SPEAKER_05]: level design again have I mentioned how great the level design is in the game because I will tell you what also in world 3 there's a level and this might be a minor spoiler so mute for about 60 seconds if you don't want to hear it I don't think it's a big deal but some people are nutso about spoilers so mute it if you don't want to hear it there's a level in the third world that invokes Mario Kart like right on down to the level actually looks like a Mario circuit track and you're running over these little dash squares that was so much fun to play

35:27.438 --> 35:55.660
[SPEAKER_05]: and I didn't even play it in multiplayer which can you imagine I've only played this game in single player but the whole thing is designed for four people to play and I can only imagine what a riot some of these games are in multiplayer and some of these levels and so forth one of the things that I hear about the game is that whoever does the best in a level wears a little crown in the next level so you know people are going to be trying to steal that crown and pick on the player who has the crown and I'm sure it makes for amazing

35:57.401 --> 36:24.689
[SPEAKER_05]: multiplayer experiences but I have yet to do those so anyway Mario 3D World if you are a Wii U owner I don't know why you don't have this game yet you need to make it a priority to get your hands on this game because it is the best Wii U game available now I already thought the one they released last year was pretty good but this one blows it out of the water it really does this is great so Mario 3D World is a must have if you're a Wii U owner is it a system seller?

36:26.650 --> 36:29.092
[SPEAKER_05]: If you like Nintendo systems, yeah.

36:29.272 --> 36:29.972
[SPEAKER_05]: It's getting there.

36:30.493 --> 36:31.474
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely getting there.

36:31.654 --> 36:37.118
[SPEAKER_05]: It's yet another game now where it's like, alright, now Wii U is starting to really build up that library.

36:37.378 --> 36:47.045
[SPEAKER_05]: If I drop the money on a Wii U, now I have two solid Mario games, Zombie U, Nintendo Land, maybe Wonderful 101 if you're into that, or Pikmin.

36:47.065 --> 36:52.849
[SPEAKER_05]: It is strengthening Nintendo's library, but is it going to be a system seller?

36:53.369 --> 36:55.291
[SPEAKER_05]: It really depends on what type of games you're into.

36:56.011 --> 37:22.818
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a real bummer Mario Kart 8 didn't make it this year because I think and I'm all for take the time to get it right and also that's part of how they're going to make 2014 not feel like the desert that 2013 was but I think if Mario Kart 8 had come out and it was solid and they were able to deliver that one-two punch on the Wii U I would be like you gotta buy a Wii U because there's all these games now but with only the

37:23.278 --> 37:33.515
[SPEAKER_05]: one huge great game it's a little harder to say because I think you really have to say like how much do I want to play Mario 3D World but I'm telling you it's really good

37:35.251 --> 37:44.395
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um... The other Nintendo game I happened to pick up this week, I actually went and bought a 3DS XL because I'm that big of a whore for 2D Zelda.

37:45.195 --> 37:49.757
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love Link to the Past, so of course I was all over Link Between Worlds.

37:49.797 --> 37:52.759
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, I've seen the stories about how it's really 3D and all this stuff.

37:53.019 --> 37:53.579
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.780
[SPEAKER_05]: It still plays like Link to the Past and all that.

37:56.080 --> 38:04.024
[SPEAKER_05]: So I bought a new Zelda 3DS XL, which has the Triforce, the, you know, high rule and low rule Triforces on it, and I've been playing the game, and I...

38:05.505 --> 38:07.106
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

38:23.499 --> 38:24.799
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on and so on.

38:51.724 --> 38:54.825
[SPEAKER_05]: I also have to hand it to the team that created this.

38:55.325 --> 38:57.446
[SPEAKER_05]: The 3D effects are great.

38:58.286 --> 39:12.250
[SPEAKER_05]: And considering a lot of us thought Nintendo was abandoning 3D when they released the 2DS, it was quite pleasing to see a 3D game that really benefits from having the 3D switch on if you are into viewing the 3D and everything.

39:12.610 --> 39:15.471
[SPEAKER_05]: Like just from the little creatures jumping, the little...

39:16.631 --> 39:17.272
[SPEAKER_05]: What were their names?

39:17.332 --> 39:18.793
[SPEAKER_05]: The Octoroks shoot the rocks, right?

39:18.813 --> 39:20.594
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the little jumping spider things called?

39:20.635 --> 39:21.035
[SPEAKER_05]: Tektites?

39:21.055 --> 39:21.515
[SPEAKER_05]: Were those Tektites?

39:21.535 --> 39:21.815
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

39:21.835 --> 39:26.279
[SPEAKER_05]: Those guys that jump up and you actually kind of see that in 3D is great.

39:26.880 --> 39:30.843
[SPEAKER_05]: When you jump off a cliff, you see that little 3D kind of enhancement.

39:31.564 --> 39:37.208
[SPEAKER_05]: You definitely see it in dungeons when, you know, you're on a level, but there's like an upstairs and a downstairs within the same level.

39:37.468 --> 39:40.431
[SPEAKER_05]: You definitely get a sense of that 3D effect and it's done tastefully.

39:41.091 --> 39:41.171
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

39:41.952 --> 39:43.112
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's great.

39:43.513 --> 39:48.675
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've heard a lot of talk about how, well, it's really weird that you can kind of rent everything from the shop in the beginning.

39:50.195 --> 39:51.476
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a different way of doing it.

39:51.776 --> 39:53.416
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't really change things for me.

39:53.677 --> 39:56.958
[SPEAKER_05]: There's still definitely points and things that you get in the dungeons.

39:57.939 --> 40:00.721
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be ways that you will want to play things in a certain order.

40:01.202 --> 40:03.344
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't really bothered by the rental system at all.

40:03.624 --> 40:04.145
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

40:04.325 --> 40:13.695
[SPEAKER_05]: It also helps differentiate it from Link to the Past and make it its own game, which is one of the better Zelda games that will be out there in the franchise for sure.

40:15.657 --> 40:20.101
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma says, Zelda A Link Between Worlds is essentially a Link to the Past second quest.

40:20.842 --> 40:21.442
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't agree with you.

40:22.203 --> 40:30.848
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they've changed enough where it... Especially once you get that ability where you can actually kind of glue yourself to walls and walk around and all that.

40:30.968 --> 40:34.170
[SPEAKER_05]: It really changes a lot of the puzzles and so forth.

40:34.210 --> 40:36.711
[SPEAKER_05]: And just such the graphical upgrade and everything.

40:37.211 --> 40:39.072
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I would call it a second quest.

40:39.693 --> 40:39.813
[SPEAKER_05]: It's...

40:41.274 --> 40:41.575
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

40:41.875 --> 40:42.616
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like I said earlier.

40:42.636 --> 40:44.458
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like revisiting an old friend.

40:44.578 --> 40:45.920
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there elements of Link to the Past?

40:46.060 --> 40:46.621
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

40:46.941 --> 40:51.186
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is definitely its own game and it is worth the price that they're asking for it.

40:51.226 --> 40:52.308
[SPEAKER_05]: The $40 or whatever.

40:53.129 --> 40:54.270
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know because I bought the bundle.

40:54.491 --> 40:55.011
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's what?

40:55.031 --> 40:55.452
[SPEAKER_05]: $40 retail, Loki?

40:56.753 --> 40:58.194
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's worth it.

40:59.294 --> 40:59.654
[SPEAKER_05]: There it goes.

41:01.154 --> 41:01.455
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

41:01.475 --> 41:02.395
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to look at our chat room.

41:02.415 --> 41:06.056
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I was talking so much I have been falling behind on our chat room.

41:06.076 --> 41:06.796
[SPEAKER_03]: He was fanboying.

41:07.056 --> 41:07.837
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, a little bit.

41:07.977 --> 41:08.477
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit.

41:08.537 --> 41:13.438
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, you know, it's funny because I've been accused of the whole Nintendo fanboy thing, which whatever.

41:13.458 --> 41:14.579
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to like what I like.

41:15.399 --> 41:19.345
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I'd like to think I'm also critical of Nintendo when they need it too.

41:19.906 --> 41:30.923
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and, you know, the whole online thing last week and the fact that, you know, yes, Super Mario World, Super Mario 3D World is great, but is it going to be enough to really push the Wii U's this year?

41:32.310 --> 41:32.911
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

41:33.711 --> 41:34.031
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

41:34.051 --> 41:37.174
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Nintendo really needed that one other game, but we'll see.

41:37.334 --> 41:37.674
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

41:38.355 --> 41:41.778
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm rooting for them, though, but I'm rooting for Microsoft and Sony as well.

41:41.918 --> 41:42.998
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that so wrong?

41:43.719 --> 41:45.861
[SPEAKER_05]: Aren't I allowed to like all the games?

41:46.721 --> 41:48.263
[SPEAKER_05]: Is something wrong with me?

41:49.143 --> 41:49.504
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything.

41:49.984 --> 41:50.785
[SPEAKER_03]: So says the internet.

41:52.990 --> 41:57.674
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I'll complain about things that need complaining about, but I'm going to cheer on the things that need cheering of.

41:57.954 --> 42:02.899
[SPEAKER_05]: And these Mario and Zelda games are accomplishments that are worthy of the cheering.

42:03.539 --> 42:04.100
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

42:05.836 --> 42:12.377
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's see, live.vognetwork.com TigerClaw says, Zelda becomes shorter if you have the guide for it.

42:12.657 --> 42:13.657
[SPEAKER_05]: Try playing without one.

42:13.677 --> 42:15.538
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll spend hours trying to figure stuff out.

42:15.578 --> 42:17.398
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, couldn't that be said about any game?

42:17.898 --> 42:21.119
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you use the guide, you're gonna have all the puzzles answered for you.

42:22.279 --> 42:27.840
[SPEAKER_05]: Zelda does have an interesting system in it where you can use the play coins that you get from walking around on the 3DS.

42:28.160 --> 42:30.780
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use those to buy hints from a ghost.

42:31.120 --> 42:35.061
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you get these little glasses in the beginning, hint glasses, and you can use them to buy hints.

42:35.561 --> 42:46.534
[SPEAKER_05]: so up to you if you want to use them or not I think that's interesting some people will probably get really turned off by that but then I just say don't equip them and then they won't be there so um

42:48.143 --> 42:48.843
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

42:49.083 --> 42:52.644
[SPEAKER_05]: Also looking for some more chats at live.vognetwork.com.

42:53.064 --> 42:58.626
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft says, I'm forgetting Zelda Wind Waker HD, Rayman Legends, and some other games.

42:59.066 --> 42:59.566
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.

42:59.706 --> 43:03.827
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably am forgetting those games, but let's also not kid ourselves.

43:03.927 --> 43:08.548
[SPEAKER_05]: Both those games you mentioned are available on other consoles, especially in the case of Rayman Legends.

43:09.168 --> 43:15.850
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the game was developed for Wii U, and it's probably best on Wii U, but the reality is it's not exclusive to Wii U anymore.

43:16.790 --> 43:36.726
[SPEAKER_05]: uh Zelda Wind Waker HD I haven't played that yet I'm very much looking forward to it but I even if the game is outstanding which I'm sure it's great it's really hard to call a reimagining of a GameCube game something that's going to really sell a lot of consoles although maybe it did for some people I don't know maybe I'm being too hard on it

43:38.604 --> 43:42.065
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the earlier Zelda release on the Wii U. Yeah, you did.

43:42.625 --> 43:45.805
[SPEAKER_03]: Taste tester before... Or it's the only Wii U release.

43:45.825 --> 43:46.405
[SPEAKER_03]: What am I saying?

43:46.525 --> 43:47.826
[SPEAKER_03]: Link Between Worlds is 3DS.

43:47.966 --> 43:48.326
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, right.

43:48.406 --> 43:52.346
[SPEAKER_05]: It was also extremely quickly put together.

43:52.366 --> 43:53.487
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not saying that in a bad way.

43:53.547 --> 43:55.827
[SPEAKER_05]: From what I understand, everybody that I know that's played it really loves it.

43:56.347 --> 43:58.587
[SPEAKER_05]: But they essentially threw it together.

43:59.248 --> 44:01.148
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not sure how to take that.

44:01.208 --> 44:04.428
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I guess that's a good thing that you can put out a quality product so fast.

44:04.468 --> 44:06.629
[SPEAKER_05]: But they did have to reimagine an old game to do it.

44:07.109 --> 44:07.329
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

44:08.349 --> 44:33.998
[SPEAKER_05]: um but you're right I shouldn't totally count out when Waker HD is something that is available there are going to be you know the game is 10 years old there are going to be a lot of people out there especially in their teens that probably never touched the first game so you know anyway all right uh I've I've gushed enough about new Mario new Zelda but I'm telling you they're great and honestly is there an Xbox One or PlayStation 4 launch game as good as Mario 3D World

44:35.778 --> 44:36.238
[SPEAKER_05]: I doubt it.

44:36.679 --> 44:38.239
[SPEAKER_05]: I highly, highly doubt it.

44:39.600 --> 44:43.202
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, a year from now, will we be able to say the same thing?

44:43.422 --> 44:43.902
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not.

44:44.443 --> 44:46.364
[SPEAKER_05]: Wii U also came out a year ago.

44:46.404 --> 44:48.365
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a year to make this game, or more.

44:48.845 --> 44:57.450
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'm sure a year from now it'll be a different story, but I'm telling you, this really makes this whole next-gen console war... I'm using my little quotey fingers...

44:58.610 --> 45:02.874
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to consider the holiday season starting on September 17th, but that's just me.

45:17.205 --> 45:20.546
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I have to mention, of course, Grand Theft Auto 5.

45:21.226 --> 45:22.307
[SPEAKER_05]: Which you haven't played yet.

45:23.067 --> 45:26.868
[SPEAKER_05]: But I recognize that a lot of people are going to call that the game of the year.

45:28.188 --> 45:34.230
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's in the show world tonight, but those Spike TV award things that they announce a lot of games at.

45:34.290 --> 45:34.650
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, VGX.

45:34.690 --> 45:36.331
[SPEAKER_05]: Bioshock Infinite Bioshock Infinite

45:54.687 --> 45:55.929
[SPEAKER_05]: Depends what kind of games you're into.

45:56.049 --> 45:56.970
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

45:57.030 --> 45:58.292
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a popularity contest.

45:58.312 --> 45:58.833
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a little bit.

45:58.953 --> 46:01.696
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I saw Tomb Raider in there, too, which was a pleasant surprise.

46:01.756 --> 46:07.124
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Tomb Raider's great and a good kick in the butt for the franchise, so I was happy to see that in there.

46:07.504 --> 46:09.086
[SPEAKER_05]: Did anybody else remember what else was in there?

46:09.166 --> 46:09.987
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe our chatters do.

46:10.088 --> 46:11.670
[SPEAKER_05]: Live.vognetwork.com.

46:13.117 --> 46:13.437
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

46:37.828 --> 46:39.610
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, there's so many hours.

46:39.770 --> 46:43.733
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of one of the reasons I'm like, do I really want to start Fallout New Vegas?

46:43.753 --> 46:46.936
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Skyrim, holy shit, did that take off a lot of my time.

46:46.996 --> 46:49.578
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

46:49.858 --> 46:58.245
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of those games, Loki, when they inevitably announced Elder Scrolls 6 for next generation consoles, will you be on board?

46:58.506 --> 46:59.927
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, you'll be like, it's on PC.

47:00.367 --> 47:01.268
[SPEAKER_05]: I can mod it on PC.

47:02.709 --> 47:05.932
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I might actually... I don't blame you, I don't blame you.

47:06.417 --> 47:06.857
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

47:21.966 --> 47:37.279
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw having that same thought at live.vognetwork.com what if they announce Elder Scrolls 6 for next gen not before the next Fallout because it kind of seems like they're going in that pattern Elder Scrolls 6 is not coming for another couple years at least because they have also online which is at some point

47:37.719 --> 47:48.344
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I think is good news because I think they need some time to... Again, the games that came out right during the launch window, a little bit not the full potential of the system.

47:48.704 --> 47:53.266
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the more time that Elder Scrolls 6 has to incubate a little bit, I think that's actually a good thing.

47:53.646 --> 47:54.786
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want it right away.

47:55.587 --> 47:58.128
[SPEAKER_05]: Trust me, it's a good thing.

47:59.629 --> 48:00.589
[SPEAKER_05]: There is that part of me.

48:00.629 --> 48:01.509
[SPEAKER_05]: And here is where...

48:03.090 --> 48:03.950
[SPEAKER_05]: Mass Effect 4 Mass Effect 4?

48:04.010 --> 48:04.891
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, what if it's current gen?

48:28.544 --> 48:29.105
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

48:44.335 --> 48:46.217
[SPEAKER_05]: I play Mass Effect 3 multiplayer on PC myself and it's great.

48:46.257 --> 48:47.018
[SPEAKER_05]: So I could just keep the PC.

48:47.038 --> 48:47.819
[SPEAKER_05]: I think for me though, having that

49:01.892 --> 49:27.990
[SPEAKER_05]: Graphic and my first experience with Mass Effect was on the Xbox 360 so I still associated my mind with consoles I just kind of think for me Mass Effect 4 is only going to sweeten the pot for the next gen consoles it's not really going to be the reason I get a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One or whatever but it's just I'm just going to be like just add that to the list of why just put that in all caps there in the pro column Mass Effect 4 right there so

49:28.730 --> 49:29.031
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

49:30.492 --> 49:35.839
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm saying Mass Effect 4 but whatever they end up calling it because obviously the Shepard series is over.

49:35.859 --> 49:36.620
[SPEAKER_05]: Y'all know what I mean.

49:37.081 --> 49:37.821
[SPEAKER_05]: Y'all know what I meant.

49:40.264 --> 49:40.665
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

49:40.765 --> 49:45.171
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com BlackWolf says, I just don't want to see Sky on a table.

49:45.411 --> 49:46.732
[SPEAKER_05]: Well then don't come to the mall with me.

49:49.075 --> 49:53.740
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get into some housekeeping and then we'll do gaming news of course.

49:54.040 --> 49:57.824
[SPEAKER_05]: Just real quick, don't forget you can follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

49:58.164 --> 50:03.229
[SPEAKER_05]: We are also available on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google+.

50:03.709 --> 50:07.053
[SPEAKER_05]: Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

50:07.093 --> 50:09.936
[SPEAKER_05]: We finally got one of those short URLs like a lot of people are getting now.

50:10.676 --> 50:14.439
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I think this is something we're going to do starting this week.

50:15.520 --> 50:19.623
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, thanks to Jason's help, I was able to get the keys to the YouTube channel back.

50:20.224 --> 50:23.847
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are going to look at posting episodes of Orange Launch Radio on YouTube.

50:25.748 --> 50:29.391
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not Orange Launch Video all of a sudden, so that is not something that's going to be there.

50:29.771 --> 50:33.014
[SPEAKER_05]: It will just be the audio with a static picture.

50:33.754 --> 50:35.316
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe at a later date we could...

50:36.616 --> 51:01.848
[SPEAKER_05]: if we talk about screenshots we can enhance the videos of that or something it depends how well received the YouTube thing is this is just a crazy experiment we have to try to get the show out to more people because YouTube does have a very big audience I think the show can get more exposure so hello to all you YouTubers and thanks for checking out the show depending on how well the show is received on YouTube we might see what else we can kind of do to enhance the show that way

51:02.548 --> 51:06.130
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, right now it's just about trying to get the show out there.

51:06.650 --> 51:10.792
[SPEAKER_05]: And plus the news that YouTube is coming to things like the 3DS.

51:11.172 --> 51:12.892
[SPEAKER_05]: YouTube's available on the Vita.

51:13.513 --> 51:18.075
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything that is another way that people can easily listen to OLR, we want to get in on that.

51:18.315 --> 51:21.336
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is coming, I think, starting this week.

51:21.376 --> 51:24.857
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this very episode will go up on YouTube if everything goes in my favor.

51:25.177 --> 51:25.618
[SPEAKER_05]: So there we go.

51:27.318 --> 51:27.598
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

51:28.538 --> 51:29.539
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

51:30.259 --> 51:34.620
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, you ever played around with Google Hangout?

51:34.880 --> 51:35.140
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

51:35.560 --> 51:37.401
[SPEAKER_05]: Perhaps you can try doing OLR with it.

51:37.481 --> 51:38.661
[SPEAKER_05]: It would archive to YouTube.

51:39.101 --> 51:39.321
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

51:41.081 --> 51:42.062
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be honest.

51:42.202 --> 51:44.742
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe I'm just being a stickler with this.

51:45.382 --> 51:47.043
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't interesting to watch.

51:48.604 --> 51:52.286
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all just sitting around a table with our microphones in hand.

51:52.306 --> 51:54.847
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm not interested in watching any of this.

51:55.567 --> 51:57.208
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really not that interesting to watch.

51:57.568 --> 52:04.891
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would need a director to sit here with us if we were to push video to its full potential.

52:04.911 --> 52:10.654
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess my point I'm trying to get at is if we make that jump to video, I kind of don't want it to be like half-assed.

52:11.014 --> 52:17.457
[SPEAKER_05]: I want somebody to actually be able to, if we talk about a game, throw up the B-roll footage of the game, be able to show that there.

52:17.797 --> 52:21.219
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just kind of too much for us to be able to put out right now.

52:22.400 --> 52:37.607
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, and I've been on this show for many, I think this show is best consumed, listen to it in the background while you play video games, or while you chat in our chat room, or while you're at work doing whatever data entry or writing or whatever it is you do that doesn't require you to be listening at work right now.

52:37.947 --> 52:46.596
[SPEAKER_05]: I think our show is best consumed that way I think if you were to sit here and watch Talking Heads for three hours talk about video games that would be the most boring thing in the world to me

52:47.932 --> 52:48.713
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's just my thought.

52:49.053 --> 52:50.133
[SPEAKER_05]: Convince me I'm wrong.

52:50.394 --> 52:52.015
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe I am just being stubborn.

52:52.075 --> 52:55.617
[SPEAKER_05]: And keep in mind, I've done radio for the past 10 plus years.

52:55.697 --> 52:58.139
[SPEAKER_05]: So this just might be my old fuddy-duddy way of thought.

52:59.159 --> 53:00.120
[SPEAKER_05]: Convince me I'm wrong.

53:00.180 --> 53:00.821
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all ears.

53:01.241 --> 53:02.482
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been wrong before.

53:02.642 --> 53:03.162
[SPEAKER_05]: Lord knows.

53:04.743 --> 53:05.023
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

53:07.725 --> 53:10.167
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into gaming news tonight.

53:10.827 --> 53:11.908
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that that's all out of the way.

53:13.746 --> 53:14.206
[SPEAKER_03]: One hour in.

53:14.287 --> 53:14.827
[SPEAKER_05]: One hour in.

53:32.941 --> 53:33.221
[SPEAKER_02]: For us.

53:33.662 --> 53:33.842
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

53:33.942 --> 53:34.382
[SPEAKER_03]: For this show.

53:34.562 --> 53:34.742
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

53:34.782 --> 53:36.844
[SPEAKER_05]: You do what works for you.

53:36.924 --> 53:37.664
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will say this.

53:37.744 --> 53:41.066
[SPEAKER_05]: Google Hangout is a great way to produce a podcast.

53:41.687 --> 53:42.367
[SPEAKER_05]: Super easy.

53:43.108 --> 53:43.768
[SPEAKER_05]: Super easy.

53:44.228 --> 53:47.931
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am all for more voices getting out there and more people being heard.

53:48.191 --> 53:51.253
[SPEAKER_05]: So if Google Hangout's the way you do that, go for it.

53:51.733 --> 53:52.274
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

53:54.335 --> 53:59.899
[SPEAKER_05]: I will brace myself for the angry emails I'm sure to incur from all that, but know that I am trying to be well-intentioned.

54:00.159 --> 54:01.100
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Loki.

54:02.000 --> 54:17.891
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so like with any console launch, there's a little bit of hiccups usually with console launches, and that was definitely the case of the PlayStation 4 with the random blinking blue light of doom or whatever you want to call it.

54:18.231 --> 54:24.657
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now the Xbox One is also running into similar issues, except no blinking lights this time around.

54:24.977 --> 54:36.087
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead, it's the sound... Yes, much like the Xbox 360, except at least it's not actually carving a nice ring into your disc this time.

54:36.287 --> 54:40.271
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just making a grinding noise and not reading discs.

54:40.471 --> 54:42.593
[SPEAKER_06]: And so people are running into those issues.

54:43.774 --> 54:44.796
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

55:00.795 --> 55:01.235
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

55:02.216 --> 55:16.023
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, the console's only been out a few days, so it's hard to say how widespread anything is, but I think it's important for Microsoft at this point to do some damage control.

55:16.223 --> 55:24.687
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw their response, which is basically, hey, if you have an issue with your system, call the customer support, blah, blah, blah, blah.

55:25.648 --> 55:27.609
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's very...

55:31.184 --> 55:31.564
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

55:31.584 --> 55:48.616
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very scripted of you to say that and instead addressing how many units might be affected versus last week when a similar situation was happening where different systems were breaking or DOA from Sony, you heard...

55:49.597 --> 55:50.157
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

56:08.466 --> 56:16.411
[SPEAKER_06]: I think right there that's addressing everything instead of, you know, not commenting on it and letting everyone speculate how bad the issue is.

56:16.492 --> 56:24.297
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm worried that, I mean, and I don't want to sound doom and gloom, but I'm worried that it may be a little bit more widespread than it seems.

56:24.737 --> 56:37.005
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully it's not because I would hope that, you know, they would test their hardware, you know, well and figure out that these problems, hopefully, you know, some sort of bad run on these disk drives or something.

56:40.228 --> 56:43.230
[SPEAKER_06]: Be wary at console launches that you're going to run into issues.

56:45.171 --> 56:51.556
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of a fair warning for any console launch that there's going to be speed bumps.

56:51.916 --> 56:54.818
[SPEAKER_05]: But we don't think this is as bad as the Red Ring of Death yet.

56:55.699 --> 56:56.760
[SPEAKER_06]: So far, yeah.

56:56.840 --> 56:59.382
[SPEAKER_06]: Not as big of an issue, but we'll see.

56:59.682 --> 57:00.162
[SPEAKER_06]: Time will tell.

57:00.723 --> 57:02.244
[SPEAKER_06]: And really, once again, it's...

57:03.866 --> 57:24.120
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, see how they respond to it, you know, how they, I think it would be nice if they came out and said something similar to what Sony said, where it's like, hey, listen, it's only this, it's not a widespread thing, we've only received, you know, you know, it's .04% or whatever, you know, compared to the system, you know, it's within standards, this is what, you know, we were expecting.

57:26.081 --> 57:29.303
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wish there was more coming from them other than very scripted, you know.

57:29.583 --> 57:31.625
[SPEAKER_06]: To be fair, this is what we were expecting.

57:31.865 --> 57:33.986
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it going to work if I'm one of those people?

57:34.206 --> 57:40.491
[SPEAKER_06]: Not what we were expecting, but it's within regular electronics yields as far as defectives go.

57:40.531 --> 57:43.133
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's such a low percentage that...

57:44.940 --> 57:47.562
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like they're making it easy at least on the Microsoft side.

57:47.582 --> 57:54.285
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about Sony's side, but on the Microsoft side, they just ship you a new one and then you have to ship the old one back in two weeks or you get charged.

57:54.445 --> 57:55.026
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they're doing.

57:55.046 --> 57:56.106
[SPEAKER_05]: They make it easy.

57:56.226 --> 57:58.768
[SPEAKER_05]: That's easier than the 360 replacement was, to be honest.

57:59.108 --> 57:59.768
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's great.

57:59.808 --> 58:00.949
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad that they're doing that.

58:01.189 --> 58:02.650
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's what they need to do.

58:02.750 --> 58:04.591
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, I think that they need to...

58:05.271 --> 58:31.332
[SPEAKER_06]: especially come on Microsoft you need to know like after all of the fallout and stuff from even when you're announcing the Xbox One stuff I think you need to talk more to your customers more directly and not sound like it's some scripted PR thing make it more candid I guess interesting kind of two good comments in the chat room but a little different Gene at live.vognetwork.com says damage control will freak out and make it a bigger deal though

58:32.293 --> 58:35.335
[SPEAKER_05]: It could have that effect where... It didn't seem like that was the effect, though.

58:35.435 --> 58:36.556
[SPEAKER_05]: The media would pick up on that.

58:37.176 --> 58:40.038
[SPEAKER_05]: Tal says, if they acknowledge it, the problem will disappear.

58:40.118 --> 58:42.540
[SPEAKER_05]: If they attempt to deny and deny, then the issue will balloon.

58:43.921 --> 58:49.184
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're just not... I mean, all they're doing is just saying, hey, you have a defective system, contact customer support.

58:49.484 --> 58:53.287
[SPEAKER_06]: I could have figured that out without reading anything from them.

58:53.907 --> 58:56.769
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like, oh, well, shit, I don't know what to do with this console.

58:57.469 --> 59:01.652
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on, if you're buying an Xbox console, you know what to do with your console if it's going to be broken.

59:02.279 --> 59:08.105
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying because, you know, especially if you bought it launched last year or not last year, last time around.

59:08.745 --> 59:09.026
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

59:09.066 --> 59:14.411
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, to be fair, you know, we're talking about Xbox One problems, but PlayStation 4 also had problems.

59:14.431 --> 59:15.352
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk about those.

59:16.613 --> 59:23.480
[SPEAKER_05]: And Sony talked about in an interview with Engadget this week exactly where those numbers are at, which Loki referred to a minute ago.

59:24.180 --> 59:34.665
[SPEAKER_05]: Quote, the number of effective PlayStation 4 systems is less than 1%, which represents a very small percentage of total units shipped to date and is within the expected range for a new product introduction.

59:34.685 --> 59:36.266
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's almost exactly what you were saying, Loki.

59:37.006 --> 59:45.311
[SPEAKER_05]: We understand the frustration of consumers that have had a problem and are working with them and our retail partners to help troubleshoot issues and ensure affected units are exchanged.

59:45.571 --> 59:46.011
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know...

59:46.971 --> 59:50.752
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't know how they can give you a better answer than that.

59:51.172 --> 59:55.014
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, again, if I'm one of those 1%, I'm still not going to be happy.

59:55.454 --> 59:57.734
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, I guess what else can they do?

59:57.794 --> 59:58.915
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's a problem, there's a problem.

59:59.075 --> 01:00:01.336
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, who's actually happy about the effect of electronics?

01:00:02.056 --> 01:00:02.356
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody.

01:00:03.316 --> 01:00:06.897
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, I think about it, you know, it's really not just video game consoles.

01:00:06.977 --> 01:00:10.718
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, iPhones are kind of notorious for having a lot of problems too.

01:00:11.238 --> 01:00:16.699
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the freaking switches, like on my first iPhone 5, that little switch, or what was it?

01:00:16.979 --> 01:00:19.639
[SPEAKER_05]: Something broke on, oh my, my sleep button, that's what it was.

01:00:19.959 --> 01:00:21.280
[SPEAKER_05]: The sleep button stopped clicking.

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:26.701
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, those things start breaking pretty easy and I wasn't using my phone for anything too strenuous.

01:00:26.741 --> 01:00:32.322
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, it's not like only game consoles are broken all the time, but it's still irritating.

01:00:32.742 --> 01:00:33.382
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

01:00:57.407 --> 01:01:00.288
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason is going to be doing some stories for us tonight since Jamie's not here.

01:01:00.628 --> 01:01:08.170
[SPEAKER_03]: I am, and easily, per the organization, you don't even have to change the initial because Jason and Jamie start with the same letter.

01:01:09.571 --> 01:01:24.355
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps a relic of back when the Xbox was still a check-in every 24 hours if the system is offline, achievements will not unlock if you're playing a game while it's offline, presumably also if your internet connection is down, anything along those lines.

01:01:26.075 --> 01:01:45.039
[SPEAKER_03]: The common consensus is just that this is simply a holdover for achievement verification on the web and not some kind of... It'd be nice if this were some kind of like a buying achievement deterrent or something of the sort, but it's more likely just that it fell within the same expectations of the system always being online.

01:01:45.519 --> 01:01:47.780
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the really fun things with this article is that...

01:01:49.521 --> 01:02:01.609
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was an announcement posted on Xbox 360 Achievements that when they realized that I was playing one game, I got achievements for another one because apparently their internet connection had died for some period of time.

01:02:02.310 --> 01:02:05.852
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they link to a help article on support.xbox.com.

01:02:06.773 --> 01:02:13.877
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought this was... I guess I've always known that we've been headed in this direction, but it makes me laugh and cry equal amounts.

01:02:14.097 --> 01:02:28.005
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get no gamer score earned from app achievements, the prescribed resolution says, "...you can earn app achievements for basic use of an app, such as watching a movie on Netflix, at the app developer's discretion.

01:02:28.465 --> 01:02:32.748
[SPEAKER_03]: App achievements do not affect gamer score, though they may bring other in-app awards."

01:02:33.548 --> 01:02:38.534
[SPEAKER_03]: And this stuff is starting to go into things that don't have anything to do with gaming at all.

01:02:39.334 --> 01:02:40.796
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give you a great example.

01:02:50.706 --> 01:02:55.048
[SPEAKER_05]: Target, the store, has a brand new app on iPhone, probably on Android too.

01:02:55.088 --> 01:02:55.889
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't imagine why it wouldn't be.

01:02:55.909 --> 01:02:56.789
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Cartwheel.

01:02:57.049 --> 01:02:58.710
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like their new little coupon thing, right?

01:02:59.110 --> 01:03:05.234
[SPEAKER_05]: And you go into this big Target database that they have of all these coupons and you add them to your barcode.

01:03:05.254 --> 01:03:07.155
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to have a Facebook, I think, to sign up for it.

01:03:07.755 --> 01:03:10.556
[SPEAKER_05]: And you put all the little coupons on your thing, right?

01:03:10.656 --> 01:03:14.638
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have your barcode and they scan your phone at the store and you get money back with it.

01:03:14.658 --> 01:03:15.299
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the thing.

01:03:16.508 --> 01:03:18.830
[SPEAKER_05]: Game Center Achievements Game Center Achievements

01:03:39.627 --> 01:03:52.636
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it, and Foursquare very largely pioneered a lot of this with its badges and just the continued increase of them.

01:03:53.196 --> 01:03:55.278
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was also a camera app.

01:03:56.158 --> 01:04:11.905
[SPEAKER_03]: Not terribly unlike Instagram in 2009 that when Game Center and Custom Achievement Integration first hit, they would give you achievements and scores for filterless and filtered photos and all of these other snazzy framing and other things that you can do with the app.

01:04:12.545 --> 01:04:20.189
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it, and on a game console, if there's actually a merit to the reward, sure, but I... I don't know.

01:04:20.709 --> 01:04:22.990
[SPEAKER_03]: The generation's here, it's finally starting, whatever.

01:04:23.970 --> 01:04:25.531
[SPEAKER_03]: Just made me laugh and also cry.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.941
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, some people in chat are asking questions here.

01:04:29.721 --> 01:04:30.081
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

01:04:32.662 --> 01:04:34.382
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiger Claw says, yeah, that does sound weird.

01:04:34.422 --> 01:04:36.643
[SPEAKER_05]: What if they give you achievement for watching certain movies?

01:04:36.983 --> 01:04:43.125
[SPEAKER_05]: What if you unlock an achievement of a movie you didn't want people know you, which cause, I don't know where the grammar went there.

01:04:43.325 --> 01:04:43.866
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:04:59.506 --> 01:05:04.868
[SPEAKER_05]: So I could save on panties if I want, but it was marked with a little padlock.

01:05:04.908 --> 01:05:06.028
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, what does that mean?

01:05:06.088 --> 01:05:07.369
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, oh, it's private.

01:05:07.749 --> 01:05:13.951
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I'm buying women's panties, I'm not going to have to answer that question with my friends who see that I'm using that to save money.

01:05:14.211 --> 01:05:15.651
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, why are you buying women's panties?

01:05:16.411 --> 01:05:18.992
[SPEAKER_03]: You watched Jersey Shore behind the scenes.

01:05:19.012 --> 01:05:21.153
[SPEAKER_03]: 100 points for your lost sanity.

01:05:23.615 --> 01:05:51.748
[SPEAKER_05]: so I would imagine certain things would be private or you could lock away or what have you so there you go Bobby Blackwolf in chat wants to remind you VOG gives achievements that's right our lovely network vognetwork.com gamified with the achievements it's true and now in case you haven't heard me pimp this enough that whole gamification is turning into prizes if you haven't checked that out the raffle at vognetwork.com we're giving away cards against humanity this month next month we're giving away tune in next week to find out

01:05:52.708 --> 01:06:21.333
[SPEAKER_03]: I finally got my first comment based achievement on VOG Network the other day I don't comment too terribly much but I was posting addendums and explaining things on a previous episode and I got enough cumulative likes that I'm finally starting to get some loot for the task BlackWolfInChat says the app achievements are general they're like watch 10 videos about your favorite team in the NFL app not watch 10 videos about the Jacksonville Jaguars laughter

01:06:22.236 --> 01:06:22.436
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

01:06:52.396 --> 01:06:55.257
[SPEAKER_03]: A good... Maybe not so much NHL.

01:06:55.277 --> 01:06:55.978
[SPEAKER_03]: I take that one back.

01:06:56.518 --> 01:07:01.600
[SPEAKER_03]: But most everything else that I've played, a good 70%, 80% of them are local.

01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:06.082
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you want to show off those achievements to anybody, you're going to have to connect online eventually.

01:07:06.162 --> 01:07:07.483
[SPEAKER_05]: So it can talk to the server.

01:07:07.883 --> 01:07:09.784
[SPEAKER_05]: 360 and PlayStation 3 both do that today.

01:07:09.804 --> 01:07:09.984
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

01:07:10.364 --> 01:07:11.985
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, I think...

01:07:12.545 --> 01:07:23.133
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same group of people that were complaining about the 24-hour requirement because shoddy internet, internet instability, not having broadband.

01:07:26.917 --> 01:07:30.479
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so looking at Bobby really wants me to read this.

01:07:30.519 --> 01:07:31.659
[SPEAKER_05]: He sent me a private message.

01:07:31.999 --> 01:07:36.601
[SPEAKER_05]: Please note the Xbox One achievements seem to be a combination of achievements and rewards on the 360.

01:07:37.542 --> 01:07:46.166
[SPEAKER_05]: The rewards bring avatar items on the 360 and on Xbox One some of those zero point achievements bring in-game badges and titles.

01:07:46.946 --> 01:07:51.988
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I mean, and that's kind of like the whole, you know, like I was talking about Cartwheel a minute ago.

01:07:52.048 --> 01:07:57.329
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not playing anything, but you're still getting those rewards for using it.

01:07:57.389 --> 01:08:01.190
[SPEAKER_05]: And I imagine even things like Twitch, because Twitch sent an email out.

01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:05.071
[SPEAKER_05]: They blasted all their broadcasters and said, hey, you can get achievements in our new app.

01:08:05.552 --> 01:08:06.172
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe...

01:08:07.132 --> 01:08:34.998
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm making shit up here but it would not be outside the realm of possibility that Twitch could be like and if you were in these achievements you can archive X more hours of video or your videos will be saved for X many more hours or your YouTubes will export this much faster or whatever they want to do you can chat in this color you know they could whatever little achievements they wanted to get they could do and it wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility for their power users quote unquote so

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:38.181
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on.

01:08:38.221 --> 01:08:40.421
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, speaking of Twitch, right?

01:08:40.701 --> 01:08:41.942
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, speaking of Twitch.

01:08:43.942 --> 01:08:51.385
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have to say, before you get into this, it's so fascinating to me how much that site is now really...

01:08:52.125 --> 01:09:16.759
[SPEAKER_05]: like we have mentioned that site easily 20 times more the past month than we did last year like it's the way it's so integrated into gaming culture now fascinates me and again I'm gonna say this again it really fascinates me nobody's competing with them do they have patents I don't know about I mean I guess there's Ustream but you don't hear Ustream as much as you hear about Twitch fascinates me

01:09:18.139 --> 01:09:21.562
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say the only other thing I can think of that comes close is YouTube.

01:09:22.222 --> 01:09:24.524
[SPEAKER_05]: But that is obviously... YouTube's different as well.

01:09:25.385 --> 01:09:26.766
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more video on demand.

01:09:27.606 --> 01:09:30.849
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitch, as most know, was born out of Justin.TV.

01:09:30.929 --> 01:09:33.331
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin.TV is in the same class as Ustream.

01:09:33.731 --> 01:09:37.914
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all very general and they have incredibly diverse content and it's a very broad service.

01:09:38.375 --> 01:09:41.797
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitch did something incredibly significant for gaming...

01:09:43.218 --> 01:09:44.719
[SPEAKER_03]: It just isolated it to gaming.

01:09:45.099 --> 01:09:54.865
[SPEAKER_03]: And that alone, and featured the biggest games that everybody goes into, Spectate, Dota, League of Legends, StarCraft, WoW to a lesser extent, Hearthstone now.

01:09:56.326 --> 01:10:11.114
[SPEAKER_03]: They did something that was very specific, perhaps because they started signing contracts with these big companies a year or two ago, but they have a dedicated, significant gaming experience, and now they are reaping the fruits of those contracts.

01:10:12.934 --> 01:10:14.376
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just fascinating to me.

01:10:14.996 --> 01:10:22.783
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I joked last week, maybe Microsoft should delay Twitch TV so they can launch their whole Skype broadcast or Skype game room.

01:10:24.184 --> 01:10:29.388
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really surprised nobody else is trying to kind of get in on that.

01:10:29.428 --> 01:10:30.830
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, that's a whole other show.

01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:37.735
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Loki, I didn't mean to derail you, but it fascinates me how much we're talking about this and how much of a gaming culture it is now.

01:10:38.716 --> 01:11:05.079
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, so, you know, like we've said before, and actually I think more talking about, like, Nintendo even, just, you know, hey, look at all the bad things that could possibly happen with, you know, because we were talking about the whole swap note thing, and now you're saying, hey, well, you know, what's to stop somebody from, you know, showing their penis over the video chat on, you know, Nintendo Wii U?

01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:09.722
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, people found out that, hey, guess what?

01:11:09.762 --> 01:11:20.169
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a really cool thing that you can do with the PlayStation 4 is that you can stream stuff with that wonderful Playroom app that's on there.

01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:27.474
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, you could basically sit down in a room and have those little robots running around and stuff, and you can almost create your own talk show.

01:11:27.814 --> 01:11:35.940
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what, like, some people have been doing, is they've been sitting there filming themselves doing stupid shit within the Playroom app.

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:48.509
[SPEAKER_06]: and unfortunately it only takes you know one person to realize hey you can stream stuff out of there to have someone else realize hey I can stream really nasty weird shit from there and that's what happened so

01:11:50.456 --> 01:11:52.238
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitch has been trying to crack down on it.

01:11:52.258 --> 01:11:52.478
[SPEAKER_06]: It says,

01:12:13.874 --> 01:12:23.144
[SPEAKER_06]: However, what does not fall under the terms of service would be some dude having sex with his girlfriend on a couch in the middle of the Playroom app.

01:12:23.825 --> 01:12:24.206
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

01:12:24.306 --> 01:12:29.331
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitch had to have a way to deal with this anyway, though, because you could do all that shit on a PC if you wanted with your webcam.

01:12:29.391 --> 01:12:34.177
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not like this is a foreign territory for Twitch to have to deal with, but...

01:12:35.718 --> 01:12:45.104
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly, the PlayStation 4 and it broadening the Twitch community like that is kind of the interesting element of this.

01:12:45.865 --> 01:12:50.108
[SPEAKER_05]: The unfortunate thing about it, I really hope they don't disable Playroom for streaming.

01:12:50.128 --> 01:12:50.488
[SPEAKER_05]: No, there's...

01:12:50.788 --> 01:12:54.591
[SPEAKER_05]: because just like I talked about the Google Plus thing earlier is a great way to get your foot in the door.

01:12:55.132 --> 01:13:00.156
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, and I think it's really fun when there's a lot of people, you know, part of what I like about this show too is that we're all in the same room.

01:13:00.196 --> 01:13:01.677
[SPEAKER_05]: We all get to react to each other and so forth.

01:13:02.077 --> 01:13:05.120
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be awesome if people could do like broadcasts.

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:05.860
[SPEAKER_05]: They were, yeah.

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:06.481
[SPEAKER_05]: On Twitch, yeah.

01:13:07.202 --> 01:13:13.847
[SPEAKER_05]: There was one example of that.

01:13:13.867 --> 01:13:27.918
[SPEAKER_06]: There was someone doing a show called The Spartan Show and they were sitting down at a desk and they were talking about the PlayStation 4 and stuff and I think they were even taking Skype calls on a computer that was in there and they had the setup and stuff so that's kind of cool.

01:13:28.798 --> 01:13:35.884
[SPEAKER_06]: Having sex with somebody or in this case there was one that's like some guy motorboating somebody in a horse head mask but

01:13:36.591 --> 01:13:40.393
[SPEAKER_06]: Not... That's a little weird, but... Hasn't that happened on this show, though?

01:13:41.874 --> 01:13:43.195
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a horse head mask yet.

01:13:43.235 --> 01:13:47.037
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe not a horse head mask, but I'm pretty sure one of the times... Motorboating has probably happened.

01:13:47.637 --> 01:13:50.619
[SPEAKER_05]: Motorboating has definitely happened on this show.

01:13:50.659 --> 01:13:54.621
[SPEAKER_05]: All those times Princess Irene has been here, I know motorboating has happened on this show.

01:13:55.982 --> 01:13:59.684
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this when I interject and say that Bobby Blackwell was just a little bit ahead of his time?

01:14:00.445 --> 01:14:01.585
[SPEAKER_03]: Friday Night Gaming?

01:14:01.725 --> 01:14:02.446
[SPEAKER_03]: Friday Night Gaming?

01:14:03.266 --> 01:14:04.526
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pre-Twitch.

01:14:05.067 --> 01:14:06.207
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fairly confident.

01:14:06.247 --> 01:14:08.748
[SPEAKER_06]: He was doing it on Ustream, the other site.

01:14:11.208 --> 01:14:18.430
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so outside of this crazy stuff, something of course that's being worked in right now is archiving.

01:14:18.530 --> 01:14:20.171
[SPEAKER_06]: They're planning on doing it for the PlayStation 4.

01:14:21.394 --> 01:14:26.296
[SPEAKER_06]: Considering for the Xbox One, I think probably just right now because the Xbox One Twitch service hasn't launched yet.

01:14:26.477 --> 01:14:29.658
[SPEAKER_06]: So once that does, we'll see what, you know, the feasibility of all stuff.

01:14:29.858 --> 01:14:32.500
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure that they're going to have archiving on both sides at some point.

01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:38.482
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, you know, like I mentioned, the Xbox One does not have the Twitch service that launched and that is coming later on.

01:14:39.343 --> 01:14:40.303
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometime in the first part of 2014.

01:14:43.359 --> 01:14:44.000
[SPEAKER_05]: GameStreamer

01:15:05.823 --> 01:15:08.905
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say the answer is obviously yes.

01:15:08.985 --> 01:15:16.410
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's even getting bigger with all this in, you know, kind of enrichments into the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:19.812
[SPEAKER_05]: But the question was more like, you know, well, why?

01:15:19.973 --> 01:15:23.975
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do people watch other people play games when you can be playing them themselves?

01:15:24.916 --> 01:15:30.800
[SPEAKER_05]: And I respect that position because I was there myself just a couple years ago, maybe even last year.

01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:32.341
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure I've said that on this show.

01:15:32.881 --> 01:15:35.143
[SPEAKER_05]: Why the hell would I live stream when I can play something myself?

01:15:35.883 --> 01:15:49.594
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have found through trying it and kind of getting into other people's streams and seeing more and more of my friends easily be able to live stream as you know, it's so easy on PlayStation 4 and helping friends of mine be able to stream.

01:15:50.215 --> 01:15:54.699
[SPEAKER_05]: It's somewhat the modern day equivalent of being able to go plop down next to somebody on the couch.

01:15:54.959 --> 01:15:55.679
[SPEAKER_05]: What you doing?

01:15:57.180 --> 01:16:00.482
[SPEAKER_05]: Even across long distances, because that's almost like what it's become.

01:16:00.542 --> 01:16:05.565
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, Extifer might be streaming Rezagun one night, and I can just virtually go plop on him next to the couch.

01:16:05.845 --> 01:16:06.605
[SPEAKER_05]: What you doing?

01:16:06.625 --> 01:16:07.366
[SPEAKER_05]: What you playing?

01:16:07.406 --> 01:16:07.826
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing?

01:16:07.846 --> 01:16:08.586
[SPEAKER_05]: You're dying.

01:16:08.727 --> 01:16:08.987
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?

01:16:10.327 --> 01:16:13.009
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like kind of the modern equivalent of that, in a way.

01:16:13.369 --> 01:16:14.550
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, for me, is like why...

01:16:15.570 --> 01:16:42.358
[SPEAKER_05]: for some people they get to see the best of the best they might have some other reasons too but for me I just love the fact that there's people that would even want to watch it and I can make something that can be a single player experience sometimes be more social a friend of mine was streaming a bunch of fighting games which normally I've been to a couple fighting game tournaments in my area yeah okay I haven't played a fighting game in a really long time but then he switched to dive kick

01:16:43.527 --> 01:16:48.629
[SPEAKER_03]: That game is completely freaking fascinating, and I'm mildly obsessed with it now.

01:16:48.829 --> 01:16:53.651
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I know him, I have known him for a number of years, so I was just kind of coming in to socialize.

01:16:54.151 --> 01:17:00.974
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard how good he is at Persona 3 Arena, so I was just kind of seeing what he's up to and seeing the other games he wants to play.

01:17:01.554 --> 01:17:08.397
[SPEAKER_03]: And just happenstance, I saw, you know, a new game that I literally never heard about before that day, and now every time I see it, it's just...

01:17:10.084 --> 01:17:35.449
[SPEAKER_05]: so simple on the face yet so incredibly deep and just a very you know dive kick is unlike any other fighting game out there so it was just a good random occurrence I go to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com lots of comments on this uh bonds006 says hear me out on this I don't care to watch others play games because I will be missing out on playing games I have two TVs in my living room and I have zero interest of watching a game stream while I am in the living room uh

01:17:36.409 --> 01:17:46.331
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like watching a friend play a game you don't have interest in playing, but curious enough to see how he or she plays it.

01:17:47.291 --> 01:17:51.492
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan at live.vognetwork.com says, I told my wife, this is like my football.

01:17:51.672 --> 01:17:53.572
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I watch people stream games.

01:17:54.012 --> 01:18:01.633
[SPEAKER_05]: And now that these apps are showing up on TVs and in the devices and so forth, you watch it almost the same way you watch football now.

01:18:02.114 --> 01:18:04.154
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of a cable box, it's an Xbox One box.

01:18:04.174 --> 01:18:04.974
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

01:18:05.414 --> 01:18:14.439
[SPEAKER_05]: Doom Plague says some games are really fun to watch, particularly open world type games like Grand Theft Auto.

01:18:14.779 --> 01:18:22.203
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Twitch games like, this wasn't particularly a big one, but imagine the modern equivalent of Geometry Wars.

01:18:22.503 --> 01:18:30.167
[SPEAKER_03]: Incredible Twitch action, once your brain can actually adapt to everything that's going on, it turns into a very fun spectator event incredibly quickly.

01:18:31.378 --> 01:18:36.539
[SPEAKER_05]: Mast Bishop in the chatroom says, when live streaming on the next gen consoles, can you see your viewer count?

01:18:37.019 --> 01:18:39.660
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we don't know about Xbox One just yet because that app's not out.

01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:41.360
[SPEAKER_05]: But on PlayStation 4, yes.

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:49.162
[SPEAKER_05]: When you do the whole little like where it has the side and the bottom bar and it kind of shrinks the screen just slightly, you can actually see how many people are watching the stream.

01:18:49.182 --> 01:18:52.883
[SPEAKER_05]: And it also counts how many chat lines have been spoken so far, which is interesting.

01:18:53.323 --> 01:18:55.083
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see how active your chatroom is.

01:18:55.383 --> 01:18:58.704
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can also see at the very bottom, you see the last two lines of chat.

01:18:59.304 --> 01:19:21.672
[SPEAKER_05]: which if you don't have a lot of people watching you can probably stay on top of very easy but imagine if you're one of the more popular broadcasters and you wouldn't be able to stay on top of the chat that way so I don't know 20 messages a second that thing will never stop moving that would be tough so I don't know but I think a lot of people probably don't interact with their chat rooms as much if you get that many comments because it's just impossible to stay on top of so

01:19:22.472 --> 01:19:24.133
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyhow, let's move on.

01:19:24.213 --> 01:19:26.993
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, we're running really long tonight, but hey, it's one of those nights.

01:19:28.354 --> 01:19:32.215
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we dabbled on this a little earlier in the show, but I want to talk about it a little more now.

01:19:32.315 --> 01:19:36.556
[SPEAKER_05]: This is about Nintendo talking about their Wii U lineup for 2014.

01:19:37.156 --> 01:19:46.619
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, in an interview with Game Trailers, Reggie Fils-Aimé, who of course is Nintendo of America's president, said that there will not be a Wii U software drought like we saw in 2013.

01:19:46.659 --> 01:19:47.079
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is, quote,

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:55.263
[SPEAKER_05]: The way we're going to be different is we're going to certainly have a steadier pace of games, both for Wii U and for 3DS.

01:19:55.703 --> 01:19:58.804
[SPEAKER_05]: The marketing activity is going to be constant throughout the entire year.

01:19:59.164 --> 01:20:03.106
[SPEAKER_05]: You tease me a little bit that, boy, the first half of 2013 was a little quiet.

01:20:03.246 --> 01:20:04.086
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what?

01:20:04.106 --> 01:20:05.127
[SPEAKER_05]: You look back and it was.

01:20:05.407 --> 01:20:07.368
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to be making that same mistake in 2014.

01:20:08.428 --> 01:20:09.108
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm, admission.

01:20:09.749 --> 01:20:14.231
[SPEAKER_05]: So the pace, the ongoing activity, touching the consumer and messaging is what we're all about.

01:20:14.531 --> 01:20:16.492
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be a big difference next year.

01:20:17.532 --> 01:20:21.578
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say this, I went and saw Catching Fire on Friday, which by the way, amazing!

01:20:22.178 --> 01:20:25.723
[SPEAKER_05]: But they had a Wii U commercial, actually.

01:20:25.803 --> 01:20:33.473
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how they do, they do like the, this is the first look of the movies at the cinema, enjoy the, you know, basically the act.

01:20:33.473 --> 01:20:33.873
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com.

01:21:00.069 --> 01:21:10.089
[SPEAKER_05]: but I digress so Nintendo is trying to get the word out there in other ways for sure so they have the movie ads if nothing else but Reggie promising you're not going to see that same drought

01:21:11.465 --> 01:21:15.087
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I bet that's why Donkey Kong and Mario Kart 8 aren't coming out right now.

01:21:15.708 --> 01:21:16.908
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a huge part of it.

01:21:17.349 --> 01:21:19.270
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the Donkey Kong delay was strategical.

01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:22.011
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it had anything to do with the game not being done.

01:21:22.552 --> 01:21:28.976
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Mario Kart maybe needed a little more tweaks because pushing that all the way back to April is quite a ways and maybe further.

01:21:29.896 --> 01:21:32.898
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think the Donkey Kong's now, what, February?

01:21:33.358 --> 01:21:35.019
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that is a strategical delay.

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:40.703
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you didn't want to have two platformers out back-to-back and Mario 3D World is so damn good

01:21:41.363 --> 01:22:07.755
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to release Donkey Kong at the same time And then it's like, oh yeah, there's two good platformers It's because there's not a lot of Wii U titles coming out Seriously, there's not a lot of Wii U titles coming out So when Reggie talks about this whole There's not going to be a drought He's full of shit He's absolutely 100% full of shit Because here are the games coming out in February On the Wii U The Lego Movie and Donkey Kong

01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:11.382
[SPEAKER_06]: So does that sound like full of shit to me?

01:22:11.542 --> 01:22:13.324
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like a whole heap of shit.

01:22:14.645 --> 01:22:17.548
[SPEAKER_05]: Could there be stuff we just don't know about yet?

01:22:17.688 --> 01:22:22.252
[SPEAKER_05]: Because let's be real, they cranked out that Zelda Wind Waker HD thing fast.

01:22:22.413 --> 01:22:27.357
[SPEAKER_05]: Could they have other little... I mean, and we've heard the rumors before about the 64 revisited.

01:22:27.377 --> 01:22:29.880
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember what the hell they call that.

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:30.781
[SPEAKER_03]: I even read that article.

01:22:30.801 --> 01:22:34.244
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I joked it was re-imagined, like they call RuPaul's Drag Race or something.

01:22:34.564 --> 01:22:37.006
[SPEAKER_05]: It was something similar to that, but you know what I'm talking about, right?

01:22:37.046 --> 01:22:37.586
[SPEAKER_05]: Re-imagined.

01:22:37.606 --> 01:22:38.607
[SPEAKER_05]: Re-imagined or something.

01:22:38.928 --> 01:22:43.091
[SPEAKER_05]: Could that be something that's in their pocket that they haven't quite played those cards yet?

01:22:44.072 --> 01:22:48.175
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that they've... They've already announced their first quarter.

01:22:48.216 --> 01:22:48.616
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

01:22:48.696 --> 01:22:50.437
[SPEAKER_06]: They have one other title in...

01:22:52.760 --> 01:23:12.239
[SPEAKER_06]: so they have a title in January they are one of the only Wii U titles in January it's Wii Fit U but it's a disc based version for the game that's out already right now so that doesn't I don't really count that because you could get it right now but yes disc based version of Wii Fit U will be out in January

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:39.902
[SPEAKER_06]: but come on it's just which was supposed to be out this year if I'm not mistaken it is out right now no the disc was supposed to be out this year that was pushed back but there is a drought there's not a whole ton of games coming out it's just the Lego movie and that's it so far for February March there's going to be some stuff but that's it Gene in chat brings up a good point live.vognetwork.com PlayStation 4 and Xbox One drought though

01:23:41.584 --> 01:23:44.567
[SPEAKER_03]: Could those systems be... Not for as long, period.

01:23:44.628 --> 01:23:45.769
[SPEAKER_03]: Launch window, whatever.

01:23:46.069 --> 01:23:52.536
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, at least we know... Is Destiny first quarter, or is that further back?

01:23:52.576 --> 01:23:53.798
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking at summer for Destiny.

01:23:54.078 --> 01:23:56.981
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, I think Placeholder is first quarter.

01:23:57.102 --> 01:23:59.004
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, but Titanfall is first quarter for sure, right?

01:23:59.024 --> 01:23:59.965
[SPEAKER_06]: Titanfall is March.

01:24:00.325 --> 01:24:04.248
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there's some things trickling in there, at least.

01:24:04.408 --> 01:24:06.069
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, Gene could have a good point.

01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:09.511
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what do the other systems have that's so great?

01:24:10.692 --> 01:24:12.553
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's a lot of placeholder stuff right now.

01:24:14.094 --> 01:24:16.996
[SPEAKER_06]: And to be fair, LEGO Movie is on all platforms.

01:24:17.356 --> 01:24:21.418
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there's that.

01:24:21.759 --> 01:24:22.719
[SPEAKER_06]: They do have some other titles.

01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:26.422
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember off the top of my head, so I'm going to actually go look.

01:24:27.322 --> 01:24:31.967
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but, uh, I know a lot of the stuff I have right now is Placeholder Thief.

01:24:32.387 --> 01:24:34.189
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to be, um, pretty soon.

01:24:34.789 --> 01:24:37.532
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that's still gonna be first quarter, if that'll get pushed back.

01:24:38.353 --> 01:24:41.216
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I was gonna say, um...

01:24:42.369 --> 01:25:11.959
[SPEAKER_05]: I think at least in PlayStation's camp I don't know so much about Xbox One but PlayStation's camp they're teasing a lot of oh yeah Infamous that's March I think they're teasing a lot of like betas you know there's the Destiny beta there's the Final Fantasy 14 beta there's the Elder Scrolls Online beta they're kind of trying to fill in the gap with all these like well the games won't be out but all these awesome previews you're waiting for will be so give or take that so anyway all right

01:25:13.866 --> 01:25:14.987
[SPEAKER_05]: Step Evolution Announces ReRave Plus Arcade

01:25:29.984 --> 01:25:40.568
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not seen the current ReRave arcade game, but I'm going to assume it's very similar to the rest of the touch-based attractions that Dave & Buster has.

01:25:41.028 --> 01:25:48.831
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is a big 40-inch touchscreen at about just above waist level and a nice placard sign to advertise what the game is.

01:25:49.451 --> 01:25:57.534
[SPEAKER_03]: But at a trade show in just the last couple of days, IAAPA, they announced ReRave Plus with a new cabinet design.

01:25:58.454 --> 01:26:02.995
[SPEAKER_03]: Very similar to how a lot of other games, notably DJ Max Technica, are going about it.

01:26:04.116 --> 01:26:09.577
[SPEAKER_03]: Standing cabinet taller than you with a little miniature platform where the subwoofer is that you step up onto.

01:26:09.997 --> 01:26:16.179
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the lean-in touchscreen that you go into play, and then a spectator's touchscreen above your face.

01:26:18.419 --> 01:26:35.409
[SPEAKER_03]: The improvements that come to ReRave+, notably any graphical changes or song lists, will be available for current ReRave arcade installations, but this new cabinet will look a hell of a lot better for people that want to plunk that money in again.

01:26:36.850 --> 01:26:43.394
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played ReRave a couple times just on my phone, probably more likely my iPad because the phone's a little bit difficult.

01:26:44.975 --> 01:26:49.739
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a quick overview of the game is that you have touch targets with timing.

01:26:50.279 --> 01:26:51.260
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a music rhythm game.

01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:52.421
[SPEAKER_03]: You touch them at a particular time.

01:26:52.461 --> 01:26:53.442
[SPEAKER_05]: It's elite beat agents.

01:26:54.183 --> 01:26:55.083
[SPEAKER_05]: It's elite beat agents.

01:26:56.404 --> 01:26:57.225
[SPEAKER_05]: Without the dancers.

01:26:59.087 --> 01:27:01.388
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a really long time since I played that game.

01:27:01.849 --> 01:27:03.870
[SPEAKER_03]: It's virtually elite beat agents.

01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:09.515
[SPEAKER_05]: The only difference is that you can kind of better see when the things are going to hit with the clock formations, but that's really it.

01:27:09.735 --> 01:27:10.516
[SPEAKER_05]: And multiple taps.

01:27:11.650 --> 01:27:12.671
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't League of Legends have those?

01:27:12.691 --> 01:27:13.151
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:27:13.211 --> 01:27:15.353
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, then it's DJ Max Technica.

01:27:16.594 --> 01:27:17.835
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't make that comparison.

01:27:18.196 --> 01:27:19.357
[SPEAKER_03]: A combination of the two.

01:27:19.777 --> 01:27:20.197
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, whatever.

01:27:20.437 --> 01:27:25.121
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, ReRave Plus, massive improvements for the arcade installations next year.

01:27:25.742 --> 01:27:26.803
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a very pretty game.

01:27:27.103 --> 01:27:31.247
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to see this in my local Dave & Buster's or elsewhere that I've been that I can't think

01:27:32.568 --> 01:27:40.812
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved and hated at the same time how they have to make sure that it's going to be relevant for an arcade by putting tickets spitting into it.

01:27:52.406 --> 01:27:54.607
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's one of those things where it's like, ah, gross.

01:27:54.727 --> 01:27:58.868
[SPEAKER_05]: But then at the same time, you're like, well, it's actually a worthy game to do that kind of thing.

01:27:58.928 --> 01:28:03.510
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, but the reality is that's the only way it's going to get into arcades, which sucks.

01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:05.050
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't hear me wrong.

01:28:05.070 --> 01:28:05.931
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine if DDR gave tickets.

01:28:06.531 --> 01:28:09.592
[SPEAKER_03]: All those noobs failing to getting their free song on Beginner would get like one.

01:28:10.112 --> 01:28:14.093
[SPEAKER_03]: But then everybody else that plays the super hard songs, hey, we just raped the whole machine.

01:28:14.113 --> 01:28:15.314
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have a ton of fucking tickets.

01:28:15.434 --> 01:28:16.194
[SPEAKER_06]: I just got to tell you.

01:28:16.534 --> 01:28:17.235
[SPEAKER_06]: Outro Outro Outro

01:28:34.278 --> 01:28:34.698
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't trip.

01:28:34.718 --> 01:28:35.539
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't trip.

01:28:59.465 --> 01:29:00.346
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there's your drought.

01:29:00.666 --> 01:29:05.691
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, if you want to call it non-drought by delaying games, yeah, sure, why not?

01:29:05.931 --> 01:29:06.752
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's play that way.

01:29:07.753 --> 01:29:19.224
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some confirmed, like, for example, Drive Club is supposed to be coming out in February and also confirmed the Xbox One version of Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare is going to be coming out.

01:29:19.424 --> 01:29:20.044
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there you go.

01:29:21.105 --> 01:29:21.426
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:29:22.006 --> 01:29:22.647
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's...

01:29:23.948 --> 01:29:25.529
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to talk drought, look at January.

01:29:25.809 --> 01:29:30.593
[SPEAKER_06]: There is We Fit You and Dragon Ball Z Battle of Z. That's it.

01:29:30.673 --> 01:29:34.136
[SPEAKER_05]: You could look at January almost every year and it's the same story.

01:29:34.196 --> 01:29:34.896
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not.

01:29:35.176 --> 01:29:35.437
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

01:29:35.457 --> 01:29:36.257
[SPEAKER_05]: This is ridiculous.

01:29:36.277 --> 01:29:40.100
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I do remember one year... When did Bioshock Infinite come out this year?

01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:40.741
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty early.

01:29:40.781 --> 01:29:43.723
[SPEAKER_05]: And then sometimes you get the Final Fantasy 13-2.

01:29:43.743 --> 01:29:44.924
[SPEAKER_05]: 13-2 was January.

01:29:44.984 --> 01:29:49.147
[SPEAKER_05]: And now Lightning Returns, I think, is February or March.

01:29:49.907 --> 01:29:50.228
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's...

01:29:50.868 --> 01:29:53.969
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very unusual to have two games only.

01:29:54.249 --> 01:29:55.630
[SPEAKER_06]: In December, it's also two games.

01:29:55.670 --> 01:29:57.250
[SPEAKER_06]: Gran Turismo 6 and then the Vita game.

01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:59.051
[SPEAKER_05]: But you were supposed to have the South Park game.

01:29:59.631 --> 01:30:00.191
[SPEAKER_06]: That didn't happen.

01:30:00.231 --> 01:30:01.492
[SPEAKER_06]: That would have only been three games.

01:30:01.652 --> 01:30:02.772
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the games left.

01:30:03.692 --> 01:30:08.174
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's talk about what's coming out now as we travel around the world and check out release dates.

01:30:08.494 --> 01:30:14.316
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, this was a pretty lengthy segment in previous weeks, but as Loki's indicating, it's going to start to dry up a little bit.

01:30:14.376 --> 01:30:16.697
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's see if there's anything for this week anyway.

01:30:17.057 --> 01:30:17.317
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

01:30:17.818 --> 01:30:18.298
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit.

01:30:18.318 --> 01:30:21.081
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more like someone took a fucking ShamWow to this shit.

01:30:23.503 --> 01:30:27.567
[SPEAKER_06]: No, seriously, this week there's a whole lot of nothing.

01:30:27.787 --> 01:30:33.252
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically Ys Memory of Celceta, which is going to be coming out on Vita.

01:30:34.753 --> 01:30:40.258
[SPEAKER_06]: One super late announcement, Air Conflicts Vietnam on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:30:40.298 --> 01:30:40.358
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

01:30:44.728 --> 01:30:46.509
[SPEAKER_06]: And I almost think that's it.

01:30:47.590 --> 01:30:48.670
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to look here real quick.

01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:54.854
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's that Frozen pack for Disney Infinity supposed to be coming out this week.

01:30:55.694 --> 01:30:56.575
[SPEAKER_06]: That was another one.

01:30:57.195 --> 01:30:58.596
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's sad.

01:31:03.058 --> 01:31:03.938
[SPEAKER_06]: God, is that it?

01:31:04.759 --> 01:31:05.699
[SPEAKER_06]: Atari Flashback 4.

01:31:06.659 --> 01:31:07.239
[SPEAKER_06]: That's coming out?

01:31:07.379 --> 01:31:07.840
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:08.260
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:09.700
[SPEAKER_05]: What's cool about the Flashback 4?

01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:10.400
[SPEAKER_05]: What does that have in it?

01:31:10.420 --> 01:31:11.161
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck if I know.

01:31:11.221 --> 01:31:12.181
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to know more about that.

01:31:12.221 --> 01:31:13.481
[SPEAKER_05]: Those consoles are pretty neat.

01:31:13.861 --> 01:31:14.362
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

01:31:14.642 --> 01:31:15.422
[SPEAKER_05]: I love retro games.

01:31:15.442 --> 01:31:15.822
[SPEAKER_05]: What can I say?

01:31:15.842 --> 01:31:21.984
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Disney Infinity, the Frozen toy box set in PowerDisc Pack 2 is going to be coming out now if you're into that shit.

01:31:23.866 --> 01:31:25.168
[SPEAKER_06]: Good Black Friday deals.

01:31:25.309 --> 01:31:26.731
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, one very late one.

01:31:26.971 --> 01:31:33.561
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo Origins bundle, which is basically just a re-bundling of the Halo Anniversary and Halo Reach.

01:31:34.322 --> 01:31:36.044
[SPEAKER_06]: So that'll be coming out this week as well.

01:31:37.246 --> 01:31:37.487
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

01:31:39.912 --> 01:31:49.443
[SPEAKER_06]: Black Friday, I know there's a new PlayStation 3 skew for $1.99 that comes with The Last of Us and Batman Arkham Origins.

01:31:50.104 --> 01:31:50.745
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty good.

01:31:50.985 --> 01:31:53.348
[SPEAKER_06]: Girls Fashion Shoot got delayed again, so that's on 3DS.

01:31:55.771 --> 01:31:56.933
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is literally it.

01:31:57.577 --> 01:32:01.700
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's travel to Japan where things are a little more active this week.

01:32:01.761 --> 01:32:07.185
[SPEAKER_05]: On the PlayStation 3, you have Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag being released in Japan on November the 28th.

01:32:07.705 --> 01:32:11.869
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Shin Sangoku Musou 7 Moshuden comes out this week.

01:32:12.650 --> 01:32:15.772
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of different versions of that limited edition.

01:32:15.952 --> 01:32:17.314
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Dynasty Warriors, isn't it?

01:32:17.334 --> 01:32:17.914
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is.

01:32:17.974 --> 01:32:19.095
[SPEAKER_05]: Koei did that one.

01:32:19.495 --> 01:32:21.457
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a pretty big release out there.

01:32:21.837 --> 01:32:23.439
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Himawari no Kyu...

01:32:23.959 --> 01:32:31.244
[SPEAKER_05]: Kyokai to Nagai Natsuyasumi Extra Vacation comes out this week, regular and limited edition.

01:32:31.284 --> 01:32:32.525
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, again, all PlayStation 3.

01:32:33.565 --> 01:32:38.629
[SPEAKER_05]: And Super Robot Taisen OG Infinite Battle comes out as well this week.

01:32:38.669 --> 01:32:40.950
[SPEAKER_05]: So pretty busy week on the PlayStation 3 in Japan.

01:32:41.391 --> 01:32:49.096
[SPEAKER_05]: Taking a look at the Xbox 360 in Japan, we have just Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag is it on the 360 in Japan.

01:32:49.176 --> 01:32:53.699
[SPEAKER_05]: So sounds like plenty more games coming out on the PlayStation 3 there, but that's kind of the norm.

01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:55.680
[SPEAKER_05]: on the PlayStation Vita.

01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:58.422
[SPEAKER_05]: Bitter Smile comes out this week in regular and limited edition.

01:32:59.143 --> 01:33:00.844
[SPEAKER_05]: Criminal Girls Invitation.

01:33:02.365 --> 01:33:03.446
[SPEAKER_05]: Invitation to what?

01:33:04.919 --> 01:33:05.660
[SPEAKER_06]: All sorts of criminal things.

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:06.801
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the name of the game.

01:33:06.861 --> 01:33:08.642
[SPEAKER_05]: Criminal Girl Invitation.

01:33:08.722 --> 01:33:12.325
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's all these anime chicks in jail outfits.

01:33:12.345 --> 01:33:13.346
[SPEAKER_05]: This is cracking me up.

01:33:13.746 --> 01:33:15.388
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely some type of RPG.

01:33:15.648 --> 01:33:17.269
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say this is looking tactics-like.

01:33:17.309 --> 01:33:18.710
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the whole hit points.

01:33:18.771 --> 01:33:19.111
[SPEAKER_03]: Not anymore.

01:33:19.131 --> 01:33:20.152
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not looking like tactics.

01:33:20.332 --> 01:33:21.793
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the hit points and magic points.

01:33:21.813 --> 01:33:23.735
[SPEAKER_05]: Is she spreading eagle in that shot?

01:33:24.755 --> 01:33:25.995
[SPEAKER_05]: This is for sick people.

01:33:26.816 --> 01:33:27.996
[SPEAKER_05]: I shouldn't say that.

01:33:28.376 --> 01:33:28.756
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:33:30.616 --> 01:33:32.217
[SPEAKER_05]: Other releases in Japan.

01:33:32.277 --> 01:33:33.537
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on beyond that.

01:33:34.437 --> 01:33:37.938
[SPEAKER_05]: Shin Sangoku Musou 7 comes out on the PlayStation Vita as well.

01:33:38.558 --> 01:33:44.679
[SPEAKER_05]: And White Album 2, Shiwase no Mukugawa comes out in Japan as well this week.

01:33:45.039 --> 01:33:48.120
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty busy on the PlayStation Vita.

01:33:49.060 --> 01:34:03.437
[SPEAKER_05]: um looking at the Wii U quickly to see if there's anything this week uh Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag and Disney Infinity Toy Box Challenge I don't know if that's the initial release of Disney Infinity in Japan that's the 3DS one yeah no it's Wii U

01:34:03.937 --> 01:34:04.338
[SPEAKER_05]: Toy Box Challenge

01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:32.947
[SPEAKER_05]: A new orange and black 3DS XL and a turquoise and black 3DS XL, or as they call it over there, LL.

01:34:33.568 --> 01:34:35.070
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple other quick titles here.

01:34:35.791 --> 01:34:43.301
[SPEAKER_05]: Toriko, Ultimate Survival, Pretty Rhythm, Rainbow Live, Kirakira My Design, and Kamen Rider come out this week.

01:34:43.914 --> 01:34:46.916
[SPEAKER_03]: and a whole hell of a lot of system and game accessories.

01:34:47.176 --> 01:34:49.377
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, but that's nothing new for Japan.

01:34:49.597 --> 01:34:51.238
[SPEAKER_05]: How about the UK, Jason?

01:34:51.479 --> 01:35:01.865
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, unlike the Xbox One, Europe is just now getting its PlayStation 4 so the lineup that we've come to know is just stacking up for this week in Europe.

01:35:02.245 --> 01:35:19.148
[SPEAKER_03]: Angry Bird, Star Wars, Battlefield 4, Contrast, FIFA 14, Injustice Gods Among Us for both PlayStation 4 and Vita, Madden NFL 25, Need for Speed Rivals, Putty Squad, Super Motherload, the Pinball Arcade, and then Tiny Brains on the PlayStation 3.

01:35:20.910 --> 01:35:22.292
[SPEAKER_03]: Very quiet for the other systems.

01:35:22.352 --> 01:35:24.674
[SPEAKER_03]: Injustice Gods Among Us is, of course, cross-platform.

01:35:24.734 --> 01:35:30.220
[SPEAKER_03]: PS4, PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PS Vita as well, I think I already mentioned.

01:35:30.861 --> 01:35:32.763
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was one more.

01:35:32.943 --> 01:35:35.967
[SPEAKER_03]: I said Super Mario 3D World is coming to Wii U over there.

01:35:36.828 --> 01:35:38.390
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's pretty much it.

01:35:39.170 --> 01:35:40.592
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely the PlayStation 4 week this week.

01:35:43.658 --> 01:35:47.040
[SPEAKER_05]: Alrighty, just a few more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:51.281
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's run through these quickly because we're running long Part A here.

01:35:51.321 --> 01:35:51.682
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Loki.

01:35:51.902 --> 01:35:54.923
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, there's a brand new firmware for PlayStation 4.

01:35:55.343 --> 01:35:57.164
[SPEAKER_06]: System Update 1.51.

01:35:57.284 --> 01:36:09.930
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to make some, I guess, minor refinements to the system UI and also, I guess, indicating when a user is downloading a game and a game patch at the same time.

01:36:10.791 --> 01:36:14.795
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess... Wow, that's really it.

01:36:15.796 --> 01:36:16.857
[SPEAKER_06]: System stability.

01:36:18.219 --> 01:36:18.900
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, patch!

01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:20.582
[SPEAKER_03]: As it goes, with new releases.

01:36:23.208 --> 01:36:25.350
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's nice though that they're coming out pretty quick.

01:36:25.970 --> 01:36:29.033
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty fast since the release of the system, so I guess that's kind of cool.

01:36:29.813 --> 01:36:34.677
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't expect a major content right now, but good that they're at least fixing some things.

01:36:36.459 --> 01:36:48.088
[SPEAKER_05]: One other story here about Tomb Raider, and yes, there is a Tomb Raider sequel in development, and this is because Crystal Dynamics' senior art director Brian Horton was talking about this during a lecture yesterday.

01:36:48.448 --> 01:37:09.324
[SPEAKER_05]: and some a statement that is grabbing some headlines was the fact that it was well financed but let me let me bring some clarity to that statement here there was a European trademark registered for Tomb Raider Reflections could that be the sequel's title who knows but certainly when trademarks and people run wild with those but that could be it

01:37:10.845 --> 01:37:14.829
[SPEAKER_05]: Square has also confirmed that there's going to be a reveal in early December.

01:37:15.690 --> 01:37:17.532
[SPEAKER_05]: So possibly Spike TV.

01:37:17.652 --> 01:37:21.075
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of the things that will be announced during the Video Game Awards there.

01:37:21.616 --> 01:37:30.665
[SPEAKER_05]: And then during the UK's Bradford Animation Festival, the aforementioned art director was taking some questions from the audience.

01:37:31.225 --> 01:37:51.966
[SPEAKER_05]: and he said in regards to the Tomb Raider sequel quote we've announced the sequel I'm glad I can finally talk about the Tomb Raider sequel is the next chapter of Laura's development her life is changing she can't go back to the way she was I seem to recall they did announce the sequel after there was the whole like there was the comic book that was being made and the comic book maker mentioned something so it kind of led to this but anyway

01:37:53.086 --> 01:37:53.546
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:38:11.795 --> 01:38:14.817
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not spending any more on a sequel than on the original game.

01:38:41.975 --> 01:38:48.721
[SPEAKER_05]: What they do with her now, because obviously the first one was all kinds of scary and really had that caves environment and all that.

01:38:49.001 --> 01:38:54.045
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm curious, are they going to now do the whole exotic worlds and that?

01:38:54.225 --> 01:38:56.247
[SPEAKER_05]: Will that be the... She'll become a pirate.

01:38:56.367 --> 01:38:58.529
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be just like Assassin's Creed 4.

01:38:59.049 --> 01:39:00.551
[SPEAKER_02]: Uncharted, Lara Croft edition.

01:39:00.751 --> 01:39:08.937
[SPEAKER_05]: Or will it still be super scary and the whole, as Jamie calls it on the show, the game called Girl.

01:39:11.115 --> 01:39:11.996
[SPEAKER_05]: Girl Girl Girl Girl Girl

01:39:27.628 --> 01:39:46.982
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get to the classic game of the week, because as you know, every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, we ask DarkSakura to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful brats, put down your Xbox One and your PlayStation 4 and Wii U's and go check out a real classic this week.

01:39:47.802 --> 01:39:49.944
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely put that shit down.

01:39:49.964 --> 01:39:51.145
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't even need a reason to put that down.

01:39:51.505 --> 01:39:51.765
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

01:40:16.917 --> 01:40:17.358
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:40:17.858 --> 01:40:20.941
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just going to warn people right off.

01:40:22.943 --> 01:40:25.125
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the noise with this game.

01:40:25.185 --> 01:40:27.147
[SPEAKER_05]: It uses like PC speaker, right?

01:40:27.167 --> 01:40:28.569
[SPEAKER_03]: And only PC speaker.

01:40:28.589 --> 01:40:29.229
[SPEAKER_05]: PC speaker.

01:40:29.289 --> 01:40:35.015
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's not a lot of music with this, and it's a lot of incidental break squeaks.

01:40:35.736 --> 01:40:39.479
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will, as I always do, let the music play in the background, whatever it is.

01:40:39.499 --> 01:40:39.960
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't.

01:40:40.761 --> 01:40:46.045
[SPEAKER_03]: It is quite literally just break squeals and police sirens and yeah.

01:40:46.305 --> 01:40:50.629
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, developed by Sphere and published by Spectrum Hollowbyte.

01:40:51.169 --> 01:40:56.634
[SPEAKER_03]: First and foremost, I will say that this game is spelled V-E-T-T-E, VET as in short for Corvette.

01:40:57.575 --> 01:40:58.556
[SPEAKER_05]: With an exclamation point.

01:40:58.576 --> 01:40:59.276
[SPEAKER_03]: With an exclamation point.

01:40:59.296 --> 01:41:00.017
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget about that.

01:41:00.377 --> 01:41:04.922
[SPEAKER_03]: That is an incredibly early and incredibly crude racing simulation game.

01:41:05.002 --> 01:41:11.889
[SPEAKER_03]: It was originally released in 1989, coming out on IBM PCs running MS-DOS and Macintosh computers.

01:41:12.489 --> 01:41:13.290
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

01:41:28.723 --> 01:41:32.205
[SPEAKER_03]: This game is 100% a relic of times past.

01:41:32.825 --> 01:41:37.547
[SPEAKER_03]: When the game starts, you have to answer a question based off details in the instruction manual in order to play the game.

01:41:50.356 --> 01:42:04.202
[SPEAKER_03]: What's really fun about this game is that if you do, if you answer the question incorrectly, you get all the way to the start of the race and as soon as go is waved, a police siren is heard and you are arrested in game for driving a stolen vet.

01:42:05.842 --> 01:42:06.302
[SPEAKER_05]: That's funny.

01:42:06.322 --> 01:42:06.762
[SPEAKER_05]: That's creative.

01:42:06.782 --> 01:42:07.142
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.

01:42:09.563 --> 01:42:14.985
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just say quickly, though, it always blows me away how all these racing games are set in San Francisco, which I get to an extent.

01:42:15.025 --> 01:42:21.647
[SPEAKER_05]: You have the landmarks and the hills of San Francisco make it interesting and everything, but just as somebody who drives a lot in San Francisco,

01:42:23.147 --> 01:42:27.711
[SPEAKER_05]: Real racing in San Francisco is being stuck in traffic all fucking day.

01:42:27.791 --> 01:42:29.552
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't race in San Francisco.

01:42:30.113 --> 01:42:31.194
[SPEAKER_05]: There's too many cars.

01:42:31.234 --> 01:42:36.077
[SPEAKER_03]: You race to make it down five miles on the 101 in like 30 minutes when you're already late for your appointment.

01:42:36.318 --> 01:42:38.319
[SPEAKER_05]: And heaven help you if Bart is striking.

01:42:40.141 --> 01:42:42.603
[SPEAKER_03]: As I learned when I came into town last time.

01:42:43.163 --> 01:42:45.025
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, 100% correct.

01:42:46.046 --> 01:42:47.528
[SPEAKER_03]: The core of the game, it is a racing game.

01:42:47.568 --> 01:42:54.716
[SPEAKER_03]: You pick one of four types of Corvettes, age appropriate, and choose one of four European sports cars as your opponent.

01:42:54.816 --> 01:43:02.425
[SPEAKER_03]: There are four key destinations to race, the fourth being a worldwide tour encompassing the three previous levels.

01:43:03.165 --> 01:43:14.469
[SPEAKER_03]: and despite the display of American Corvette dickwagging, the funnier part of this game is that if you lose to your opponent, one of the most often messages you get is, don't feel bad, I programmed this game.

01:43:14.869 --> 01:43:19.010
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently the developers may have been more in love with the European sports cars than the Corvette.

01:43:19.090 --> 01:43:22.531
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's a very interesting mix of cultures there.

01:43:23.711 --> 01:43:28.113
[SPEAKER_03]: There are degrees of difficulty and realism on the easiest mode called Trainee.

01:43:28.213 --> 01:43:31.574
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be no car damage, police will not be a factor.

01:43:32.194 --> 01:43:37.178
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, turns will be tight and cruise control will just be full speed at all times.

01:43:37.278 --> 01:43:43.002
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you collide with something, you will instantly go back up to your cruise control speed when the object moves out of your way.

01:43:43.382 --> 01:43:48.846
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there are collisions, there are damage, there is realism to the extent you can call it for 1989.

01:43:51.047 --> 01:44:14.304
[SPEAKER_03]: as you increase in difficulty these various options will start becoming more and more realistic if you speed go down a wrong way go down a one-way street the wrong way oh hey look at that Bay Bridge or I assume that's the Golden Gate Bridge yeah run through red lights and police will start to pursue you you will get pulled over and you will even have to give your excuse to the officer before he writes you a citation

01:44:14.924 --> 01:44:16.604
[SPEAKER_03]: There is even manslaughter.

01:44:16.784 --> 01:44:25.446
[SPEAKER_03]: There are characters in the city of San Francisco that you can run into and they go from a standing crude sprite to a flattened crude sprite.

01:44:26.627 --> 01:44:29.907
[SPEAKER_03]: The pro difficulty level turns all of these on on full realism.

01:44:30.007 --> 01:44:33.788
[SPEAKER_03]: Damage, traction, police, and cruise control are all said to be realistic.

01:44:34.228 --> 01:44:35.989
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty convincingly too, I will say.

01:44:36.009 --> 01:44:41.290
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and by the way, your opponent is immune to all of this and is damn fast.

01:44:41.330 --> 01:44:42.630
[SPEAKER_03]: He's incredibly frustrating.

01:44:43.050 --> 01:44:50.160
[SPEAKER_03]: This game was oodles of fun for me when I was, well, it came out when I was four, but I'm sure I was playing it more when I was five, six, or seven.

01:44:50.841 --> 01:44:59.272
[SPEAKER_03]: And despite how crude it is, there's just something colorful, fun, defined, and really, really incredibly interesting about this game.

01:44:59.412 --> 01:44:59.712
[SPEAKER_05]: Stunt Racing

01:45:16.408 --> 01:45:20.450
[SPEAKER_05]: Movie Stunts, where you go over the loop and all that shit.

01:45:20.610 --> 01:45:29.295
[SPEAKER_05]: That game looks like utter garbage now, but back in the day, we were plunking down a dollar because, dude, you could drive around a loop.

01:45:30.695 --> 01:45:31.416
[SPEAKER_05]: And we loved it.

01:45:31.476 --> 01:45:33.177
[SPEAKER_05]: And fail every single time.

01:45:33.317 --> 01:45:34.537
[SPEAKER_05]: In its VR realness.

01:45:34.557 --> 01:45:36.258
[SPEAKER_03]: Test drive 3, man.

01:45:37.419 --> 01:45:40.360
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, sorry, Jason.

01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:45.323
[SPEAKER_03]: This game is as zany as it is shockingly deep to the point that it can actually represent it.

01:45:45.783 --> 01:45:57.596
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't want to race, there's also a tour mode which will immediately warp you to time period appropriate landmarks, the Coit Tower, the Ferry Building, Fisherman's Wharf, and the Piers, the Transamerica Pyramid, and of course, Lombard Street.

01:45:57.776 --> 01:46:00.018
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of its glory completely represented in this game.

01:46:00.879 --> 01:46:26.982
[SPEAKER_03]: The kicker of this game is that there's a lot of crude and silly elements, like for example, I'm staring at the video right now, and there's a gear, there's a shifter, there's the gear box, no, there's the shifter, with the character's hand on it, and the gear is represented by a little notch in, you know, one is top left, two is bottom left, et cetera, et cetera, but the hand never moves, there's just this little switch that goes through the image.

01:46:28.223 --> 01:46:30.246
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube for VET, you'll see what I'm talking about.

01:46:30.426 --> 01:46:31.968
[SPEAKER_03]: Automatic or manual, you can do it both.

01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:41.640
[SPEAKER_03]: The kicker of all this game, and we were talking about this before with Atari and everything else, this game was less than one megabyte in size.

01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:47.366
[SPEAKER_03]: One single floppy disk for the whole of the Upper Peninsula.

01:46:47.987 --> 01:46:51.630
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, these objects are crude, but they're frickin' 3D standing objects.

01:46:51.930 --> 01:46:55.613
[SPEAKER_03]: This game actually does have terrain, so you actually go sloped roads.

01:46:56.053 --> 01:46:59.755
[SPEAKER_03]: The background images are cute, there's EGA dithering.

01:46:59.775 --> 01:47:02.637
[SPEAKER_05]: There were some serious polygons on that Golden Gate Bridge.

01:47:02.677 --> 01:47:03.078
[SPEAKER_03]: There are.

01:47:03.138 --> 01:47:08.321
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing the objects that they put together to make this game for less than one megabyte.

01:47:09.022 --> 01:47:10.183
[SPEAKER_03]: Completely astounding.

01:47:11.354 --> 01:47:12.895
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, there it is.

01:47:13.435 --> 01:47:18.177
[SPEAKER_05]: Look into racing games on the PCs passed with the classic game of the week, Vette.

01:47:19.118 --> 01:47:19.858
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, there it is.

01:47:19.958 --> 01:47:24.480
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Vette with an explanation point, not like, you know, my first pet vet.

01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:25.640
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, or something like that.

01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:27.001
[SPEAKER_03]: My first pet accident.

01:47:27.121 --> 01:47:28.042
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, there it is.

01:47:29.382 --> 01:47:30.182
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much, Jason.

01:47:30.202 --> 01:47:30.843
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a good pick.

01:47:30.963 --> 01:47:31.343
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

01:47:31.403 --> 01:47:34.444
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I like hearing about games that I would have never looked up otherwise.

01:47:34.524 --> 01:47:37.766
[SPEAKER_05]: And considering that I did play a lot of old school games, I'd actually never heard of this game.

01:47:38.186 --> 01:47:40.088
[SPEAKER_05]: So you stumped me on that one.

01:47:40.128 --> 01:47:40.708
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job, Jason.

01:47:41.289 --> 01:47:41.529
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:47:41.969 --> 01:47:45.432
[SPEAKER_05]: That does it for Part A, but we have plenty more show to come after a quick break.

01:47:45.752 --> 01:47:47.694
[SPEAKER_05]: We have rapid-fire news coming at you.

01:47:47.754 --> 01:47:50.917
[SPEAKER_05]: The Fugle Question of the Week, talking about sales and frugal gaming.

01:47:51.577 --> 01:47:53.439
[SPEAKER_05]: News about current racing games.

01:47:53.739 --> 01:47:57.462
[SPEAKER_05]: So going from a classic racer to things like Forza 5 and Gran Turismo 6.

01:47:58.183 --> 01:48:05.109
[SPEAKER_05]: Your emails, your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR and plenty more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:48:11.929 --> 01:48:22.138
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday night, November the 24th of 2013, with our 528th episode already in progress.

01:48:22.659 --> 01:48:24.260
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had a heck of a show so far tonight.

01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:24.981
[SPEAKER_05]: We have.

01:48:25.061 --> 01:48:26.042
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason's joining us here.

01:48:26.102 --> 01:48:29.265
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are just joining us live, DarkSakura out for the night.

01:48:29.305 --> 01:48:33.789
[SPEAKER_05]: She had a prior engagement, a family affair, as those things tend to happen this time of year.

01:48:33.809 --> 01:48:34.089
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.

01:48:34.409 --> 01:48:43.741
[SPEAKER_05]: And real quickly, since Thanksgiving week is this coming week here in America, I just want to wish all of our listeners who are celebrating Thanksgiving this coming week, I want to wish you all a happy Thanksgiving.

01:48:44.622 --> 01:48:51.210
[SPEAKER_05]: And we here at Orange Launch Radio, as cheesy as it sounds, we really are thankful for all of you guys who take the time out of your day to listen.

01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:53.733
[SPEAKER_05]: Those of you that participate with the show here live on Sunday nights,

01:48:54.253 --> 01:49:04.558
[SPEAKER_05]: Those of you that listen via the podcast, those of you that leave comments at vognetwork.com, those of you that email, those of you that leave the kind reviews on iTunes and Stitcher and all that, we just really appreciate you guys.

01:49:04.658 --> 01:49:06.098
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for being a part of the community.

01:49:06.418 --> 01:49:07.819
[SPEAKER_05]: You are our motivation.

01:49:08.139 --> 01:49:09.720
[SPEAKER_05]: That is why we've been here for the past

01:49:10.460 --> 01:49:11.440
[SPEAKER_05]: God, how long has it been?

01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:12.541
[SPEAKER_05]: 11 plus years at this point.

01:49:12.881 --> 01:49:13.761
[SPEAKER_05]: I have lost count.

01:49:14.161 --> 01:49:14.961
[SPEAKER_05]: It has hit that point.

01:49:14.981 --> 01:49:16.961
[SPEAKER_05]: I have lost count of how many episodes we've had.

01:49:17.021 --> 01:49:20.962
[SPEAKER_05]: But since June of 2002, we've been here at Orange Laundry.

01:49:20.982 --> 01:49:22.042
[SPEAKER_05]: We are thankful for you guys.

01:49:22.383 --> 01:49:23.103
[SPEAKER_05]: You keep us going.

01:49:23.423 --> 01:49:25.143
[SPEAKER_05]: So happy Thanksgiving to all you out there.

01:49:25.403 --> 01:49:39.006
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you aren't in America, you're Canadian or you're British or Australian or from another country that doesn't have Thanksgiving this week, then I will say enjoy your week making fun of us and our Black Friday mania and all that crap.

01:49:39.486 --> 01:50:02.886
[SPEAKER_05]: So enjoy your week making fun of us for all of that We deserve it, quite frankly But I'm hoping for some good deals come Cyber Monday I'm crossing my fingers and my toes Maybe I can get Diablo 3 on PlayStation 3 at a steel price on Cyber Monday Because I'm certainly not braving those crowds on Black Friday I will say this, I have gone out on Black Friday late at night And it's just like any other day

01:50:03.526 --> 01:50:29.046
[SPEAKER_05]: if you go at like 7 or 8 o'clock at night to Target or whatever it's just like any other day because all the crazies are done they went to bed all the TVs for 99 bucks or whatever crazy shit's going on they're all long since sold out so nobody's around for those anymore so Black Friday's not so bad in that regard which is good because sometimes I realize I need toothpaste and then oh shit I don't want to be anywhere near a store on Black Friday but there you go

01:50:30.247 --> 01:50:52.988
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just hoping there's been enough pushback that stores don't make a habit of actually being open on Thanksgiving night like prior to midnight Friday's rough and the 4am starts and the midnight starts and all that kind of crap is rough but at least it's on Friday companies that have talked about being open on Thanksgiving night like 8pm or some nonsense like that

01:50:53.608 --> 01:50:59.293
[SPEAKER_03]: I seriously hope that that is not prolific and does not trend in future years.

01:50:59.513 --> 01:51:07.700
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to deviate too much from the topic of video games, but since a lot of video games are on sale during this special period, we'll go into this a little bit.

01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:09.801
[SPEAKER_05]: I do kind of understand both sides of it.

01:51:10.342 --> 01:51:12.263
[SPEAKER_05]: If the audience wasn't there for it, they wouldn't do it.

01:51:13.044 --> 01:51:16.307
[SPEAKER_05]: They do have to get the particular sales and all that.

01:51:16.447 --> 01:51:17.868
[SPEAKER_05]: I do to some extent...

01:51:18.328 --> 01:51:18.928
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

01:51:39.474 --> 01:52:06.906
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's that no no no no we do not get two days off of work to celebrate Black Friday and that's starting to be what it's becoming and that's the part that gets me more than anything is when we're starting to eclipse Thanksgiving and you know that's that's where things get a little little I don't like it for me but you know there's a lot of places that don't hospitals don't stop running on Thanksgiving so let's give thanks to those folks that you know work hard when the

01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:10.461
[SPEAKER_03]: and then deal with the trampling crazies the day afterwards.

01:52:10.521 --> 01:52:11.021
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

01:52:11.241 --> 01:52:11.662
[SPEAKER_03]: No kidding.

01:52:11.962 --> 01:52:12.662
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had four hours.

01:52:12.682 --> 01:52:14.363
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm talking about.

01:52:14.443 --> 01:52:16.724
[SPEAKER_03]: Not even 24 hours goes by before that stuff happens.

01:52:16.824 --> 01:52:17.064
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:52:17.684 --> 01:52:18.425
[SPEAKER_05]: So, all right.

01:52:19.165 --> 01:52:19.745
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

01:52:19.805 --> 01:52:21.466
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get back into some rapid fire news.

01:52:21.506 --> 01:52:23.587
[SPEAKER_05]: Get back to what the games are all about.

01:52:23.647 --> 01:52:23.887
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

01:52:24.187 --> 01:52:32.569
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so there was a lot of Persona announcements after a countdown, and it was funny, they had some videos that go along with it.

01:52:33.609 --> 01:52:45.392
[SPEAKER_06]: Trolling Persona fans, they had a video with this old woman that was announcing something, and they had a trailer in the background of it playing in Akihabara, and...

01:52:46.872 --> 01:52:51.153
[SPEAKER_06]: Persona 5 Announced for PS3 Winter 2014 Persona Q Shadow of the Labyrinth 3DS June 5th in Japan North America

01:53:15.699 --> 01:53:23.361
[SPEAKER_06]: Persona, or P4U, Persona 4, the Ultimax Ultra Suplex Hold on PS3.

01:53:23.441 --> 01:53:27.043
[SPEAKER_06]: That is going to be a follow-up to Persona 4 Arena.

01:53:28.283 --> 01:53:35.465
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's Persona 4 Dancing All Night that's going to be coming to Vita.

01:53:35.925 --> 01:53:40.107
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's supposed to be a music game, a rhythm action game, I guess.

01:53:40.567 --> 01:53:41.287
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that should be fun.

01:53:41.767 --> 01:53:43.369
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and that's coming in autumn of 2014.

01:53:43.769 --> 01:53:47.333
[SPEAKER_05]: So lots of Persona for you.

01:53:47.533 --> 01:53:52.759
[SPEAKER_05]: Persona fans still not satisfied, even though that's probably like literally 5,000 hours of gameplay.

01:53:53.439 --> 01:53:55.001
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm teasing, obviously.

01:53:55.061 --> 01:53:56.142
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, that is exciting.

01:53:57.223 --> 01:54:12.664
[SPEAKER_06]: considering the lack of good games based on this franchise Game of Thrones is going to be getting a brand new series of games or at least a game from Telltale and that's pretty awesome

01:54:13.638 --> 01:54:15.139
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way it will be less than one game.

01:54:15.239 --> 01:54:16.761
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be a series like everything else.

01:54:17.381 --> 01:54:19.343
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm... I don't know.

01:54:19.363 --> 01:54:20.244
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's pretty awesome.

01:54:20.304 --> 01:54:23.386
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know they've had the strategy game, which is alright.

01:54:23.426 --> 01:54:28.090
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they had that Game of Thrones game that came out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:54:28.130 --> 01:54:28.931
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of lame.

01:54:29.411 --> 01:54:31.633
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can't go wrong with Telltale.

01:54:32.134 --> 01:54:33.255
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no way they can fuck that up.

01:54:33.355 --> 01:54:33.475
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

01:54:33.894 --> 01:54:42.398
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm just going to say this, as much as I agree and Telltale's put out a lot of quality stuff, I'm a little sad that that King's Quest thing didn't happen.

01:54:42.618 --> 01:54:43.919
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little irritating.

01:54:44.119 --> 01:54:49.801
[SPEAKER_05]: I was really looking forward to the Telltale King's Quest game, so the fact that that kind of didn't happen is sad.

01:54:49.861 --> 01:54:51.662
[SPEAKER_05]: But yay Game of Thrones, I guess.

01:54:51.862 --> 01:54:56.044
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm totally using this story as an excuse to bitch about King's Quest not happening.

01:54:56.064 --> 01:54:57.505
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, but I had to.

01:54:58.445 --> 01:55:01.668
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I would think probably Activision's gonna be at fault there.

01:55:02.788 --> 01:55:05.190
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, they're the ones that have the license, don't they?

01:55:05.210 --> 01:55:11.155
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, but, you know, fuck them.

01:55:11.175 --> 01:55:12.076
[SPEAKER_06]: What are they gonna do with it?

01:55:12.276 --> 01:55:14.898
[SPEAKER_06]: Treyarch, First Person Shooter, King's Quest.

01:55:16.199 --> 01:55:17.780
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd still play that, but yeah.

01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:18.561
[SPEAKER_06]: Arrgh.

01:55:19.922 --> 01:55:20.262
[SPEAKER_06]: No idea.

01:55:20.282 --> 01:55:22.804
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then, of course, um...

01:55:26.229 --> 01:55:30.570
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it's sort of a surprise that John Carmack is leaving id Software.

01:55:30.590 --> 01:55:39.474
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that he's working with the Oculus folks as their chief technology officer.

01:55:39.754 --> 01:55:43.676
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure what else he's doing, but he is resigning.

01:55:46.737 --> 01:55:49.598
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been at the company for 17 years, but it's too bad.

01:55:51.189 --> 01:55:52.990
[SPEAKER_03]: That seems short for some reason.

01:55:54.091 --> 01:55:54.371
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that?

01:55:54.391 --> 01:55:56.733
[SPEAKER_03]: 17 puts it back to 1996.

01:55:58.274 --> 01:56:02.277
[SPEAKER_03]: But didn't... That was like after Doom and everything.

01:56:02.297 --> 01:56:04.799
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't he there for... I thought so too.

01:56:04.819 --> 01:56:06.520
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm just fucking up my ID software history.

01:56:06.781 --> 01:56:07.061
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

01:56:07.779 --> 01:56:11.440
[SPEAKER_06]: My question is, so is that why Rage was on sale this weekend?

01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:17.441
[SPEAKER_03]: Your golden parachute is made up of the sales of this game.

01:56:17.681 --> 01:56:18.861
[SPEAKER_05]: Oculus Rift, though.

01:56:19.341 --> 01:56:20.682
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason, have you played Oculus Rift?

01:56:21.502 --> 01:56:22.382
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and I didn't mention that.

01:56:24.122 --> 01:56:36.785
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I got back into town, if I didn't mention this, I don't remember when I actually played it, so I may or may not have mentioned it last time I was on the show, but I've been wanting to get my hands on an Oculus Rift, but not out of my own pocket.

01:56:37.806 --> 01:56:47.794
[SPEAKER_03]: There is an Oculus Rift at the office owned by a co-worker of mine that leaves it there because he and a friend of his sometimes stay late and do, you know, hack on 3D projects and that kind of stuff.

01:56:49.055 --> 01:56:54.080
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I have... Hack on 3D projects, play 3D pornography games, you know.

01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:56.482
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, play 3D games most definitely.

01:56:57.082 --> 01:56:57.923
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't doubt that one.

01:56:58.183 --> 01:56:58.724
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?

01:56:58.864 --> 01:57:01.146
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's a whole other discussion.

01:57:01.186 --> 01:57:02.987
[SPEAKER_05]: Just remember what the internet's for, Jason.

01:57:03.007 --> 01:57:03.087
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:57:04.008 --> 01:57:06.750
[SPEAKER_03]: A for the awesome, A for the awesome

01:57:23.803 --> 01:57:25.824
[SPEAKER_03]: That game is fucking fantastic with the Oculus Rift.

01:57:26.344 --> 01:57:27.564
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my dear sweet God.

01:57:27.624 --> 01:57:38.867
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that game just in general, but having, you know, there's contention about which display mode to use with the Oculus Rift, whether head tracking should be where you're aiming is.

01:57:39.028 --> 01:57:39.608
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

01:57:39.688 --> 01:57:40.708
[SPEAKER_03]: Other people do whatever.

01:57:40.748 --> 01:57:41.728
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what the choice is for.

01:57:42.248 --> 01:57:49.411
[SPEAKER_03]: But for, you know, the skydiving simulator in a freaking Oculus Rift, oh my God, that is so much fun.

01:57:49.871 --> 01:57:50.591
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely love it.

01:57:53.041 --> 01:57:53.742
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been, uh...

01:58:13.894 --> 01:58:27.242
[SPEAKER_03]: Two weeks ago, also, obviously still when I was in San Francisco, because that's where the Rift is, like I said, a couple of coworkers stayed late and one individual was demoing it to two other people.

01:58:27.602 --> 01:58:37.288
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was kind of funny because one of them didn't understand that it was head tracking and not like... She said afterwards that she thought it was like augmented reality or something like that, that she'd be able to see through.

01:58:37.708 --> 01:58:42.851
[SPEAKER_03]: So when somebody else is playing, she would go up and, hey, hey, wave on the other side of the Rift and we're like...

01:58:43.972 --> 01:59:09.109
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't work that way, she can't see you And then when she actually put it on, she still had that mentality And so she was doing the Italy house demo, if you saw just the basic FPS I did, I did And so there were like wispy things in the air, like the torches would let out those little quick flames I think she said butterflies and maybe even leaves, I actually kind of don't remember it myself

01:59:09.549 --> 01:59:21.353
[SPEAKER_03]: but she was walking around and she would, you know, she would wave her arm at him and she would flick, she would try to hit him and obviously nothing happened except for adjusted

01:59:23.035 --> 01:59:24.236
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

01:59:48.473 --> 01:59:49.114
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:00:15.493 --> 02:00:17.835
[SPEAKER_06]: other than game console with better specs.

02:00:18.316 --> 02:00:19.857
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fucking PC with better specs.

02:00:19.897 --> 02:00:20.477
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

02:00:21.518 --> 02:00:23.600
[SPEAKER_06]: That is something that has a little bit more of a hook.

02:00:23.920 --> 02:00:28.664
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting way to look at it.

02:00:29.225 --> 02:00:43.257
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on with some more rapid fire news, though, including here's another story about fucking Twitch, but it's about Minecraft, which that's a game that won't die in a community that won't die.

02:00:43.417 --> 02:00:43.657
[SPEAKER_05]: And with

02:00:43.697 --> 02:00:44.177
[SPEAKER_05]: and Oculus Support.

02:01:09.410 --> 02:01:12.152
[SPEAKER_05]: This was kind of outlined at MineCon recently.

02:01:12.512 --> 02:01:17.016
[SPEAKER_05]: But now in Minecraft, you do a quick visit to enable streaming in the account settings.

02:01:17.296 --> 02:01:18.637
[SPEAKER_05]: All you have to do, press F6.

02:01:18.837 --> 02:01:19.318
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

02:01:19.938 --> 02:01:23.501
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you need to walk through the features, that's available, of course, on YouTube.

02:01:23.521 --> 02:01:25.723
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, people can stream and then archive to YouTube.

02:01:26.203 --> 02:01:26.624
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that.

02:01:27.024 --> 02:01:29.346
[SPEAKER_05]: So many more Minecraft streams to come.

02:01:29.666 --> 02:01:32.489
[SPEAKER_05]: The creators of Minecraft, very good about...

02:01:33.910 --> 02:01:40.275
[SPEAKER_05]: They do not try to enforce copyrights on any of their stuff on Twitch or YouTube or any of that.

02:01:40.295 --> 02:01:41.877
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, go forth and mine.

02:01:42.237 --> 02:01:44.279
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just make all the Minecraft stuff you want.

02:01:44.319 --> 02:01:48.603
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, Hunger Games, Minecraft, YouTubes, they're everywhere.

02:01:49.043 --> 02:01:49.724
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are huge.

02:01:49.824 --> 02:01:50.404
[SPEAKER_05]: They look fun.

02:01:50.664 --> 02:01:52.806
[SPEAKER_06]: I just never could find something to join in with.

02:01:53.547 --> 02:01:57.230
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish we could do one of those, but I know it's a lot of work.

02:01:57.611 --> 02:01:58.832
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a script for it, but...

02:01:59.707 --> 02:02:02.489
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to play Final Fantasy XIV and World of Warcraft.

02:02:20.462 --> 02:02:45.368
[SPEAKER_05]: and uh don't know if these are a limited time deal or what have you it costs 500 coins if you want these posters so there you go by the way you can also get a Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past for 150 coins uh for the Wii Virtual Console because it's not out on Wii U yet but I'm sure it will be before too long in fact I haven't looked at what Virtual Console games came out for Wii U recently but there was a lot of um let's just say scraping the bottom of the barrel

02:02:46.548 --> 02:02:50.291
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the really old Nintendo launch titles that people don't care about anymore, like Clue Clueland.

02:02:50.691 --> 02:02:54.134
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, fans of Clue Clueland, but let's be real, no one care.

02:02:54.495 --> 02:02:57.477
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's been what some of the virtual console releases have been lately.

02:02:59.318 --> 02:03:02.601
[SPEAKER_05]: The next-gen console wars did continue in South Park.

02:03:02.741 --> 02:03:06.444
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about this a little bit last week when the first half of South Park aired.

02:03:06.744 --> 02:03:10.768
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, sure enough, it was a two-part episode, and the second half did air this week.

02:03:11.508 --> 02:03:13.910
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the continued story of Black Friday...

02:03:15.171 --> 02:03:18.292
[SPEAKER_05]: A Song of Ass and Fire apparently was the name of the episodes.

02:03:19.072 --> 02:03:19.592
[SPEAKER_05]: Go figure.

02:03:20.132 --> 02:03:21.052
[SPEAKER_05]: And there you go.

02:03:21.212 --> 02:03:23.492
[SPEAKER_05]: They are dressed in a little bit of product placement.

02:03:23.513 --> 02:03:28.753
[SPEAKER_05]: The characters in South Park were dressed up like the characters in the RPG which is coming out now March of 2014.

02:03:29.133 --> 02:03:32.114
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people talking about the Princess Kenny anime intro.

02:03:32.614 --> 02:03:33.314
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be honest.

02:03:33.554 --> 02:03:35.135
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't watch this week's yet.

02:03:35.355 --> 02:03:36.035
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty funny.

02:03:36.195 --> 02:03:36.935
[SPEAKER_05]: I plum forgot.

02:03:37.615 --> 02:03:38.995
[SPEAKER_06]: Who won the console war in the end?

02:03:39.115 --> 02:03:39.495
[SPEAKER_06]: Spoilers.

02:03:39.655 --> 02:03:40.235
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't watch it.

02:03:40.335 --> 02:03:42.756
[SPEAKER_06]: But I saw that sequence so I watched it on YouTube.

02:03:43.036 --> 02:03:43.296
[SPEAKER_06]: God damn.

02:03:43.476 --> 02:03:43.796
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn it.

02:03:43.816 --> 02:03:45.098
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably better we don't answer that for spoilers.

02:03:45.118 --> 02:03:45.698
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I guess that's true.

02:03:45.738 --> 02:03:46.299
[SPEAKER_05]: For spoilers.

02:03:46.359 --> 02:03:48.181
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people are going to be like, your show spoils things.

02:03:49.562 --> 02:03:49.882
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:03:50.263 --> 02:03:50.783
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.

02:03:50.923 --> 02:03:51.724
[SPEAKER_03]: Jason, what do you have for us?

02:03:52.004 --> 02:03:52.625
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:03:53.146 --> 02:03:56.108
[SPEAKER_03]: Polyphony Digital are attempting to do the impossible.

02:03:57.043 --> 02:03:57.563
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

02:04:15.652 --> 02:04:15.932
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

02:04:37.019 --> 02:04:41.621
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, three PS1 games are available for free on a PlayStation Home scavenger hunt.

02:04:42.041 --> 02:04:46.183
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a short little 13 hidden card minigame in home.

02:04:46.523 --> 02:04:57.527
[SPEAKER_03]: Shouldn't take you more than 10-20 minutes tops, but the games are Twisted Metal, Warhawk, and Destruction Derby, which are frickin' great titles to add to your collection, so why not?

02:04:58.707 --> 02:05:26.165
[SPEAKER_03]: and lastly Strider 2014 the reboot will also include the original version Strider 1 and 2 the PS1 versions rather not arcade or anything like that Strider 2014 is slated to be released on February 22nd will include the first two get your history on and enjoy these games oh I lied it's not just PlayStation 4 I'm crazy Strider 2014 is going to be on PC, Xbox 360 and Xbox One

02:05:28.208 --> 02:05:28.948
[SPEAKER_05]: When's that out?

02:05:29.768 --> 02:05:30.348
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed the date.

02:05:30.448 --> 02:05:30.808
[SPEAKER_03]: February 22.

02:05:31.029 --> 02:05:34.169
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay, there's something to look forward to in that early window.

02:05:35.429 --> 02:05:37.310
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally forgot one of the games I played this week.

02:05:37.330 --> 02:05:38.410
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to name it next week.

02:05:38.750 --> 02:05:39.110
[SPEAKER_05]: It's alright.

02:05:40.390 --> 02:05:42.611
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a download game I totally played earlier this week.

02:05:42.671 --> 02:05:45.631
[SPEAKER_05]: I spent like an entire night playing it and then it was like, oh, new games to play.

02:05:46.471 --> 02:05:47.612
[SPEAKER_05]: I do that way too much.

02:05:47.692 --> 02:05:50.332
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll just say the download games really help bridge the gap.

02:05:52.312 --> 02:05:55.113
[SPEAKER_05]: Alrighty, let's get to the Fugo question of the week.

02:05:56.790 --> 02:06:02.912
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week here, we take Facebook and Google+, slam it together, you get FOOGLE!

02:06:04.753 --> 02:06:06.174
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to the question of the week.

02:06:07.554 --> 02:06:12.056
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will read some of the answers from Facebook and Google+, because we are running a little long tonight.

02:06:12.116 --> 02:06:12.696
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, guys.

02:06:14.697 --> 02:06:16.658
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the hell are the posts on Google+, I can't see them.

02:06:17.618 --> 02:06:18.838
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, fine, we'll go to Facebook first.

02:06:20.559 --> 02:06:23.240
[SPEAKER_05]: For some reason, my computer is running so slow, too.

02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:24.821
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry if it's causing the feed to skip.

02:06:27.159 --> 02:06:30.680
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, all the account madness that we did earlier today may have been a factor in this.

02:06:30.920 --> 02:06:31.841
[SPEAKER_05]: That very well could be.

02:06:31.861 --> 02:06:32.181
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

02:06:32.961 --> 02:06:34.482
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I had to get the YouTube channel back.

02:06:34.522 --> 02:06:35.962
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't posted to it for like four years.

02:06:36.363 --> 02:06:36.603
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:06:36.623 --> 02:06:37.903
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, here we go.

02:06:37.983 --> 02:06:38.804
[SPEAKER_05]: The Fugle Question of the Week.

02:06:38.884 --> 02:06:39.664
[SPEAKER_05]: Brace yourselves.

02:06:39.724 --> 02:06:41.304
[SPEAKER_05]: Holiday shopping season is coming.

02:06:42.125 --> 02:06:46.607
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any holiday gaming deals you plan to pick up over the next few weeks?

02:06:47.107 --> 02:06:52.549
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you typically wait for games to go on sale before buying them, or does the desire to play them right away usually win out?

02:06:53.149 --> 02:06:55.731
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's go to some of the answers from Facebook.

02:06:55.831 --> 02:06:57.873
[SPEAKER_05]: RedTheHaze says, For the Fallen Dreams says, America!

02:07:18.600 --> 02:07:33.925
[SPEAKER_05]: Andy R says the desire to play right away wins out almost all the time that and pre-order bonuses stupid as they sometimes are I'll probably still take a look at the deals coming up but buying a Playstation 4 last week and a 3DS a couple months ago means I'm holding off on spending too much at the moment

02:07:34.905 --> 02:07:36.707
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, let's see.

02:07:36.947 --> 02:07:43.574
[SPEAKER_05]: Daniel S says, there aren't any specific games I want to buy per se, but if they're a really good deal on something, I'll snatch it up.

02:07:43.914 --> 02:07:50.080
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are usually Steam sales, but outlets have been known to clear their inventory of large, large collector's edition boxes.

02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:51.301
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, that's really true.

02:07:52.222 --> 02:07:56.246
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, DJ Synthetic says, I'm just hoping for a purple 3DS bundle type thing.

02:07:56.586 --> 02:07:59.248
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to start playing something not Call of Duty Ghosts.

02:08:00.129 --> 02:08:04.173
[SPEAKER_05]: and DJ Ranma S says GameStop has some sweet deals I plan to pick up.

02:08:04.513 --> 02:08:09.658
[SPEAKER_05]: I do try to wait for games to go on sale but on the same token I'm in no rush to play a lot of the games that are coming out.

02:08:09.959 --> 02:08:11.700
[SPEAKER_05]: So by the time I get that game it's usually under $30.

02:08:11.740 --> 02:08:11.860
[SPEAKER_05]: Score!

02:08:14.031 --> 02:08:18.034
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, now going over to Google+, now that it's loaded, let's look at just a few comments over there.

02:08:18.794 --> 02:08:27.141
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft says, I already jumped the gun on getting a Zelda Wind Waker Wii U on the Mexican version of Black Friday, which is El Buen Fin, or The Great Weekend.

02:08:27.701 --> 02:08:28.802
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not know that was a thing.

02:08:29.382 --> 02:08:31.264
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned something tonight.

02:08:31.284 --> 02:08:38.389
[SPEAKER_05]: Tech2030 says, Even though I just bought a PlayStation 4, if there is a killer Black Friday deal for a Wii U, I'll probably pull the trigger on that one.

02:08:38.789 --> 02:08:42.672
[SPEAKER_05]: It's killing me that I'm not playing Super Mario 3D World and Wind Waker HD already.

02:08:43.393 --> 02:08:51.690
[SPEAKER_05]: and lastly Sam H says Xbox Live and PlayStation Plus 12 month sub cards for 30 bucks at GameStop that's right Rob I'm going to GameStop

02:08:52.594 --> 02:08:53.514
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what?

02:08:53.555 --> 02:08:55.215
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't really blame you for that, Sam, though.

02:08:55.235 --> 02:08:56.236
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a pretty good deal.

02:08:56.756 --> 02:09:01.218
[SPEAKER_05]: Even I want to go get the PlayStation Plus card at that rate because it's a really good deal.

02:09:01.939 --> 02:09:05.180
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are some of the answers from our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:07.922
[SPEAKER_05]: By all means, please go read the rest of them.

02:09:07.982 --> 02:09:14.045
[SPEAKER_05]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

02:09:15.145 --> 02:09:15.886
[SPEAKER_05]: How about you guys?

02:09:16.186 --> 02:09:23.632
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we might have dabbled into this a little bit, but do you have any Black Friday, Cyber Monday deals you guys are looking into?

02:09:23.732 --> 02:09:28.096
[SPEAKER_05]: I already mentioned Diablo 3 is something I want to grab if I can get it dirt cheap.

02:09:28.116 --> 02:09:30.438
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not paying $60 for a game I already have for free.

02:09:31.038 --> 02:09:33.961
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the console version, yeah, I'm tempted.

02:09:34.641 --> 02:09:34.921
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason?

02:09:34.941 --> 02:09:35.742
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason?

02:09:36.242 --> 02:09:38.324
[SPEAKER_03]: No, unless there's something on Steam that I have to have, which

02:10:06.158 --> 02:10:08.359
[SPEAKER_06]: I say there probably isn't going to be, but you never know.

02:10:08.419 --> 02:10:09.219
[SPEAKER_05]: There always will be.

02:10:09.559 --> 02:10:12.360
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some indie title that wasn't on your radar that will be eventually.

02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:15.520
[SPEAKER_05]: Spelunkies, I know one I really want to get.

02:10:16.821 --> 02:10:19.762
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure the minute that goes on a deep steam sale, it'll be mine.

02:10:20.782 --> 02:10:22.382
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot about steam sales, Jason.

02:10:22.402 --> 02:10:22.762
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.

02:10:22.922 --> 02:10:24.183
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to hurt.

02:10:24.483 --> 02:10:25.263
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to hurt this year.

02:10:26.277 --> 02:10:27.578
[SPEAKER_03]: You already said it once in this episode.

02:10:27.818 --> 02:10:28.519
[SPEAKER_03]: Winter is coming.

02:10:28.659 --> 02:10:29.559
[SPEAKER_03]: I can only mean one thing.

02:10:29.579 --> 02:10:30.100
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:30.700
[SPEAKER_05]: Steam sale.

02:10:31.521 --> 02:10:31.861
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:10:32.301 --> 02:10:39.507
[SPEAKER_06]: I still haven't even picked up, like, Bioshock Infinite, even though they had it for, like, $11 for, like, you know, all three games.

02:10:39.747 --> 02:10:41.368
[SPEAKER_06]: Bioshock 1, 2, and Infinite.

02:10:41.468 --> 02:10:42.529
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, I gotta get that, too.

02:10:43.250 --> 02:10:43.830
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good point.

02:10:44.130 --> 02:10:46.212
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be, like, five bucks by the time.

02:10:47.193 --> 02:10:47.453
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:10:47.813 --> 02:10:52.697
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on with some other news, and then we'll get to the mailbag, the FU's of the week, and all that other good stuff.

02:10:52.737 --> 02:10:53.017
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

02:10:53.037 --> 02:10:53.117
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

02:10:53.866 --> 02:11:04.480
[SPEAKER_06]: Forza 5 Forza 5, as people realize once they purchase the game, has a bit of a monetization business model to it.

02:11:05.941 --> 02:11:08.284
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, you can play the game and unlock stuff.

02:11:09.525 --> 02:11:36.057
[SPEAKER_06]: or you can buy some tokens and the tokens um they cost their price email for the tokens is really stupid actually because they have different bundles you can get and you're you know you usually think oh I'm buying more so I get a better deal on it it's actually the opposite if you buy less you get better deal on it um but they have um I guess they were talking about different cars and stuff for example if you were to buy like um

02:11:38.491 --> 02:11:40.533
[SPEAKER_06]: The McLaren or something like that, the P1.

02:11:41.353 --> 02:11:45.396
[SPEAKER_06]: The cost of that, the token pack, they're saying, well, this is all in euros, of course.

02:11:45.977 --> 02:11:52.121
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're saying $15.99 would be, I guess it would cover both of those cars.

02:11:54.042 --> 02:11:56.664
[SPEAKER_06]: $100 is like $79 euro.

02:11:57.264 --> 02:11:58.525
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what that is over here.

02:11:58.545 --> 02:11:59.146
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's like $0.89 over here.

02:11:59.166 --> 02:11:59.346
[SPEAKER_06]: $79 euros is $107. $107.

02:12:05.421 --> 02:12:09.363
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, 0.79 euros, not 79 euros.

02:12:09.423 --> 02:12:09.703
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, $1.

02:12:10.463 --> 02:12:12.384
[SPEAKER_06]: So about a dollar.

02:12:14.525 --> 02:12:21.807
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, I think they did the same thing with Real Driving 3 when that came out or something, where they added it all together.

02:12:21.947 --> 02:12:23.048
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say it was like $2,200 is what they...

02:12:27.309 --> 02:12:35.613
[SPEAKER_06]: Token costs in the US 100 tokens runs you 99 cents If you want 325 tokens, it's going to run you $5 Yes, you heard correctly 325 tokens is $5 Whereas if I spent $5 on the 100 tokens, I get 500 tokens Because that makes fucking sense

02:12:49.588 --> 02:12:53.531
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for letting me bundle easily, guys.

02:12:53.911 --> 02:12:54.071
[SPEAKER_06]: $5.75 is $10.

02:12:54.912 --> 02:12:57.594
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me throw this out there because the chat's being a little adamant about this point.

02:12:57.914 --> 02:13:01.817
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft and chat at live.vognetwork.com First, I love this.

02:13:01.877 --> 02:13:06.400
[SPEAKER_05]: Blackwolf at live.vognetwork.com says, The monetization ain't as bad as whatever Loki's about to say.

02:13:07.701 --> 02:13:13.087
[SPEAKER_05]: and then Actdeft said monetization as in buying tokens and credits, those exist since Forza 3.

02:13:13.868 --> 02:13:17.752
[SPEAKER_05]: I seriously don't know why people are making a big fuzz about this monetization thing.

02:13:19.113 --> 02:13:24.339
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think in some extent it is an opportunity for people to pounce on a new system and

02:13:24.879 --> 02:13:27.020
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, this is the route we're going down.

02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:35.364
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's because this game has half the cars that the last game had is more like it, and that they're offering... Oh, you can get more cars in DLC.

02:13:35.605 --> 02:13:50.412
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I understand that's because the cars are modeled in higher resolution or whatever excuse they want to use, but it's a little shady when you're buying a system for $500, and then you're buying a game for $60, and then they are saying...

02:13:50.652 --> 02:13:51.233
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you know what?

02:13:51.253 --> 02:13:54.575
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also buy some cars too if you want to spend another $100 on them.

02:13:54.816 --> 02:14:04.403
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of think that's where it's at is that people have hit their saturation point with seeing the freemium model in the premium games.

02:14:05.044 --> 02:14:15.353
[SPEAKER_05]: And I kind of just think the reason why this is all catching fire and you're seeing it, it's not like we're the first ones to get out there and make it sound like it's all new because there's a lot of gaming blogs that are running this like it's...

02:14:16.213 --> 02:14:22.960
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox One Poison I don't have a problem with it being on this game I have a problem with it being on any game that you're paying retail price for If it's a free to play game

02:14:35.393 --> 02:14:36.634
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, fine.

02:14:37.374 --> 02:14:39.175
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine, because they've got to make their money somehow.

02:14:39.255 --> 02:14:45.077
[SPEAKER_06]: But you've already made your money selling me this game, and now you're saying, oh, well, we need more money.

02:14:45.357 --> 02:14:48.839
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, for example, they were saying, though, that, I guess...

02:14:51.303 --> 02:14:55.267
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the cars was like $100.

02:14:57.549 --> 02:15:03.815
[SPEAKER_06]: Lotus E21 is 6 million credits or 10,000 tokens.

02:15:04.676 --> 02:15:13.484
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, 10,000 tokens would be $100 in real money if you wanted to just buy the car and not play the game to unlock those tokens or credits.

02:15:15.418 --> 02:15:15.999
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of lame.

02:15:16.259 --> 02:15:16.820
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, fuck.

02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:22.306
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was kind of lame in Forza Horizon where they had this shit you could unlock for tokens.

02:15:22.866 --> 02:15:23.087
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

02:15:23.547 --> 02:15:26.230
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's lame everywhere.

02:15:26.671 --> 02:15:27.331
[SPEAKER_06]: And come on.

02:15:28.152 --> 02:15:29.013
[SPEAKER_06]: This is ridiculous.

02:15:29.113 --> 02:15:30.775
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no excuse that this needs to be in there.

02:15:31.116 --> 02:15:35.761
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hate when the developers or publishers go, but the people wanted it.

02:15:37.338 --> 02:15:38.779
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, no one fucking wants it.

02:15:38.799 --> 02:15:42.602
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I remember a day when UpUpDownDown, LeftRightLeftRightBA, Stark gave me all that shit.

02:15:42.962 --> 02:15:43.903
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know.

02:15:44.343 --> 02:15:50.848
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will say, at least in the case of Forza Horizon, I still love that game an awful lot.

02:15:50.948 --> 02:15:57.313
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not like this ruins the game, per se, and I haven't played Forza 5, so I can't speak to it, but I have played Forza Horizon a lot.

02:15:58.014 --> 02:16:05.079
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't ruin the game, per se, but it's just one of those things where you kind of, you just, it's a disappointing sigh, I guess is really the only way I can phrase it.

02:16:06.383 --> 02:16:06.623
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

02:16:07.464 --> 02:16:07.724
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:16:09.224 --> 02:16:09.825
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

02:16:09.885 --> 02:16:15.728
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, if you think this is specific to Xbox and Forza, you would be incorrect.

02:16:16.208 --> 02:16:16.588
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

02:16:16.888 --> 02:16:25.373
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Gran Turismo 6 on the PlayStation 3, not 4, 3, will also have a system for in-game microtransactions.

02:16:25.413 --> 02:16:30.035
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, this isn't something you can really pick on Forza specifically.

02:16:30.395 --> 02:16:33.537
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just people starting to kind of hit their point where, you know...

02:16:33.977 --> 02:16:34.558
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had it!

02:16:34.678 --> 02:16:35.278
[SPEAKER_05]: Officially!

02:16:35.819 --> 02:16:36.259
[SPEAKER_05]: With these.

02:16:36.780 --> 02:16:41.545
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, purchasable as credits from PlayStation Network and physical retailers.

02:16:41.565 --> 02:16:45.508
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get in-game credits to get vehicles, parts, and related accessories.

02:16:46.329 --> 02:16:53.136
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we don't know exactly how much this is gonna be in the game and so forth, but it sounds like almost the exact same model that you see in Forza...

02:16:53.596 --> 02:17:01.578
[SPEAKER_05]: also in Gran Turismo 6 which will be launching early December so you can see for yourself exactly if there's $100 cars to buy in this game as well.

02:17:01.598 --> 02:17:20.864
[SPEAKER_06]: It's stupid that people even allow and unfortunately you're buying these games because they're good racing games but at the same time they're not putting I mean I guess the best advice you could say is just don't buy these but I'm sure to some extent people are going to buy some of them because they want oh you know maybe not necessarily $100 for a car but you know maybe they want just

02:17:21.965 --> 02:17:37.360
[SPEAKER_06]: extra money or something I don't know they have it in Grand Theft Auto Grand Theft Auto 5 has where you can pay to get money online and they keep nerfing all the fucking payouts on everything so trying to convince people to spend money on that

02:17:38.306 --> 02:17:42.390
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya in chat says, I'd assume in Gran Turismo you can still earn credits the old-fashioned way.

02:17:43.371 --> 02:17:44.932
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also assuming that to be the case.

02:17:44.992 --> 02:17:48.815
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost identical to what we just talked about with Forza 5, it seems.

02:17:49.116 --> 02:17:55.641
[SPEAKER_06]: So how long is it that we're going to get that fucking energy meter for, you know, these games where, oh, my driver's tired now.

02:17:55.722 --> 02:18:00.526
[SPEAKER_06]: He can't drive anymore, you know, for today because... In this case, it'll be a gas tank.

02:18:00.886 --> 02:18:05.190
[SPEAKER_06]: Some Mountain Dew, you know, because they're going to have the product tie-in in there as well, and...

02:18:05.458 --> 02:18:06.299
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

02:18:26.579 --> 02:18:29.021
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason, maybe you have some better news in the racing game world?

02:18:29.141 --> 02:18:35.227
[SPEAKER_03]: Wrapping up our trifecta of racing, Mario Kart Arcade Grand Prix Deluxe is confirmed for US release.

02:18:36.168 --> 02:18:48.599
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been in Japan since the summer of this year, and it will make its way to North America, well, rather just outside Japan, winter 2013, so imminently in the next month for arcades that are actually going to make the investment.

02:18:49.479 --> 02:18:55.925
[SPEAKER_03]: It was also showcased at IAAPA as was re-raved that we mentioned earlier in the show.

02:18:56.505 --> 02:19:06.173
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of technical discussion about the fact that it can retrofit in existing cabinets, reuse Dead Heat, I believe it was called.

02:19:06.233 --> 02:19:08.275
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead Heat Riders motorcycle game.

02:19:09.195 --> 02:19:14.319
[SPEAKER_03]: Cute trailer video that also includes the Taiko Drum character from Taiko Natasajin.

02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:21.307
[SPEAKER_03]: Other various bits about what it's going to be powered by as far as the system internal.

02:19:21.928 --> 02:19:36.685
[SPEAKER_03]: The really, really weird part about this article is that the author wrote this saying, One thing we are also sure about is that this is not the same game as what Nintendo will be releasing for Wii U later that they are calling Mario Kart 8.

02:19:38.325 --> 02:19:45.331
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember back in the day when you would have Crystal Castles in the arcade, Crystal Castles on the 2600.

02:19:55.298 --> 02:19:57.460
[SPEAKER_05]: It's technically supposed to be a port of the arcade game.

02:19:57.940 --> 02:20:01.282
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not uncommon to think that home versions of games are ports of the arcade game.

02:20:01.543 --> 02:20:04.324
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can see why they're like, this is different than Mario Kart 8.

02:20:04.444 --> 02:20:07.787
[SPEAKER_03]: In large part, we are so far removed from that.

02:20:08.107 --> 02:20:17.193
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it just struck me in the realization that these games are that different, that the Mario Kart arcade experience is that distinct.

02:20:17.793 --> 02:20:24.318
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just like, minus music games, what else has been similar console and arcade?

02:20:25.218 --> 02:20:29.620
[SPEAKER_03]: Time Crisis doesn't really exist in the console space anymore so far as I know.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.201
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly, it's because the arcades are dying out.

02:20:32.301 --> 02:20:34.121
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, what, Super Street Fighter?

02:20:34.542 --> 02:20:38.403
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's where the arcade game was almost based off the console.

02:20:38.523 --> 02:20:39.964
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the answer to this question is...

02:20:41.204 --> 02:20:48.909
[SPEAKER_03]: and Hydro Thunder and H2 Overdrive and that kind of stuff that did show up on the Xbox 360 Marketplace, Xbox Live Arcade Marketplace rather.

02:20:49.070 --> 02:20:54.773
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a game I talked about a couple weeks ago on the show, Midway Arcade Origins, which is actual arcade ports of the emulators.

02:20:55.114 --> 02:20:57.195
[SPEAKER_03]: From two decades ago, sure.

02:20:57.675 --> 02:21:02.619
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, the new arcade Mario Kart has Taiko Drum as a character.

02:21:02.659 --> 02:21:03.359
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to play that.

02:21:03.399 --> 02:21:04.000
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds awesome.

02:21:04.020 --> 02:21:04.440
[SPEAKER_05]: I said that.

02:21:05.140 --> 02:21:05.881
[SPEAKER_03]: I said it was in the trailer.

02:21:06.314 --> 02:21:06.914
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very cute.

02:21:06.954 --> 02:21:07.955
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very awesome to see.

02:21:09.036 --> 02:21:16.220
[SPEAKER_03]: This Nintendo Namco mutual happiness is really, really worthwhile.

02:21:16.700 --> 02:21:19.862
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya says, I played the first Mario Kart arcade game and it was fun.

02:21:19.902 --> 02:21:21.143
[SPEAKER_05]: Would love to play the third one.

02:21:21.783 --> 02:21:24.645
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually did too when I was in Arizona.

02:21:25.426 --> 02:21:30.308
[SPEAKER_03]: Mesa Golf Land has... Don't get it at Golf Land, whoopee.

02:21:30.429 --> 02:21:31.869
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it was Grand Prix 1.

02:21:31.929 --> 02:21:32.590
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very old.

02:21:32.610 --> 02:21:34.111
[SPEAKER_03]: The cameras were shot to hell.

02:21:34.191 --> 02:21:35.712
[SPEAKER_03]: The display was a little dim.

02:21:36.392 --> 02:21:38.495
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was also very, very easy, which was kind of weird.

02:21:38.655 --> 02:21:46.204
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, for being completely original gameplay mechanics, Mario Kart Grand Prix Arcade is quite fun.

02:21:46.244 --> 02:21:48.447
[SPEAKER_03]: If you happen to come across it, definitely check it out.

02:21:50.293 --> 02:21:51.074
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on.

02:21:51.214 --> 02:21:51.454
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

02:21:52.114 --> 02:21:55.856
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also great for when you're drunk during your bachelor party.

02:21:56.737 --> 02:21:58.978
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that one of the YouTubes on the Originals Radio account?

02:21:58.998 --> 02:21:59.318
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is.

02:21:59.379 --> 02:22:00.099
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's still there.

02:22:00.559 --> 02:22:02.901
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that one still gets views.

02:22:02.941 --> 02:22:04.622
[SPEAKER_05]: I should make ad money off that.

02:22:04.642 --> 02:22:05.042
[SPEAKER_05]: You should.

02:22:05.502 --> 02:22:06.343
[SPEAKER_06]: I get a portion though.

02:22:07.424 --> 02:22:07.824
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

02:22:08.224 --> 02:22:09.205
[SPEAKER_05]: The show still runs.

02:22:09.265 --> 02:22:09.926
[SPEAKER_05]: That's your portion.

02:22:12.829 --> 02:22:16.272
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about NCAA again.

02:22:17.273 --> 02:22:25.421
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, speaking of a publisher that's really having a karma sink or whatever, EA, holy shit.

02:22:26.182 --> 02:22:28.864
[SPEAKER_06]: First, losing the NCAA...

02:22:30.846 --> 02:22:31.106
[SPEAKER_06]: Game.

02:22:31.627 --> 02:22:42.292
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, uh, NBA Live, you know, that game has been, you know, waiting to come out for years now, and they retooled it, retooled it, and the reviews have been fucking terrible.

02:22:42.713 --> 02:22:44.133
[SPEAKER_06]: It just looks terrible.

02:22:46.135 --> 02:22:48.376
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, they gotta be hurting over EDA Sports.

02:22:48.416 --> 02:22:54.099
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, NCAA, um, they have sued EA now over the Lightness settlement.

02:22:54.959 --> 02:22:57.821
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, you know, I guess, uh,

02:23:00.168 --> 02:23:10.896
[SPEAKER_06]: with the $40 million settlement that was going, I guess, to students or student-athletes like this is in their legal dispute going back all the way to 2009.

02:23:11.197 --> 02:23:20.644
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, this is, I guess, regarding they've not renewed the license.

02:23:21.004 --> 02:23:25.187
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're trying to put it out now as some sort of EA Sports college football or something like that.

02:23:27.269 --> 02:23:27.589
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me.

02:23:28.650 --> 02:23:39.581
[SPEAKER_06]: They're saying the Collegiate Licensing Company, the CLC, is caught in the middle of a dispute between NCAA and EA, which should not involve us.

02:23:40.041 --> 02:23:43.525
[SPEAKER_06]: And the CLC has valued the relationship with both NCAA and EA.

02:23:44.125 --> 02:23:49.891
[SPEAKER_06]: While we hope that they can soon resolve their dispute, we see no reason for the CLC to be involved.

02:23:50.111 --> 02:23:51.893
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, EA has declined...

02:23:52.513 --> 02:23:59.778
[SPEAKER_06]: A sort of comments regarding the CELC being involved in this lawsuit in the first place.

02:23:59.818 --> 02:24:06.702
[SPEAKER_06]: So either way, it doesn't look like the NCAA is going to be coming back for a college football game next year.

02:24:09.024 --> 02:24:13.006
[SPEAKER_06]: That's too bad because that was one of the only good titles in the month of July.

02:24:13.307 --> 02:24:14.788
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I guess it's going to be Persona.

02:24:15.168 --> 02:24:15.768
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of Persona.

02:24:16.469 --> 02:24:18.010
[SPEAKER_06]: Persona all year long.

02:24:19.150 --> 02:24:19.711
[SPEAKER_06]: Your Persona.

02:24:21.283 --> 02:24:21.864
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:24:39.078 --> 02:24:43.039
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe they are already out in Japan or about to come out right before the end of the year.

02:24:43.279 --> 02:24:44.179
[SPEAKER_05]: December or something, right?

02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:45.740
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we're getting them in March 2014.

02:24:47.180 --> 02:24:50.381
[SPEAKER_05]: Specifically March 18th, 2014 is when North America gets it.

02:24:50.781 --> 02:24:52.702
[SPEAKER_05]: Europe gets it on March 21st.

02:24:53.142 --> 02:24:56.123
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that is the PlayStation 3 versions of the remaster.

02:24:56.483 --> 02:24:57.783
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're looking to the Vita version...

02:24:58.325 --> 02:25:00.027
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's been no announcement on that.

02:25:00.648 --> 02:25:08.198
[SPEAKER_05]: And a press release from Square Enix Europe said, quote, full details of the PlayStation Vita version and release timing will be revealed at a future date.

02:25:08.879 --> 02:25:09.760
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

02:25:11.022 --> 02:25:11.543
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

02:25:12.624 --> 02:25:13.225
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we'll see.

02:25:14.787 --> 02:25:15.267
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

02:25:15.607 --> 02:25:16.127
[SPEAKER_05]: Poor Vita.

02:25:17.108 --> 02:25:19.868
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it would have been great for the Vita if the Vita version came out first.

02:25:20.408 --> 02:25:24.269
[SPEAKER_05]: That would have been really good for the Vita, but oh well, I guess I shouldn't encourage that.

02:25:24.289 --> 02:25:26.470
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the Vita have a fully fledged Final Fantasy yet?

02:25:27.090 --> 02:25:27.530
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it wouldn't.

02:25:27.790 --> 02:25:29.550
[SPEAKER_03]: 13 predated it by a long shot.

02:25:29.650 --> 02:25:41.373
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, Vita doesn't really have anything Final Fantasy per se, unless you'd want to count PSP games that you can play on Vita, like Tactics was a PlayStation Plus title at one point, and there's plenty of PS1 games.

02:25:41.846 --> 02:26:04.433
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have the physical disc, the UMD of that alright, let's get to the mailbag every week you guys email us at mailbag at orange launch radio dot com and usually DarkSakura jumps in the mailbag both are applicable well if she sees things she doesn't like she might but no, she jumps in the mailbag head first but since she's not here tonight I will get the hazmat suit on and jump into the mailbag for you

02:26:05.253 --> 02:26:33.780
[SPEAKER_05]: just two emails tonight to read here and the first one comes to us from a person who said please don't read my name so fine I will not so Anonymous writes us and says why I am getting an Xbox One instead of PlayStation 4 the Xbox One is better the Xbox doesn't require you to pay for a $5 a month PlayStation Plus membership for online multiplayer the PlayStation 4 however does require a $5 a month PlayStation Plus membership for online multiplayer

02:26:34.878 --> 02:26:40.603
[SPEAKER_05]: The Xbox One version of Assassin's Creed, the Xbox One version of Watch Dogs.

02:27:00.720 --> 02:27:01.501
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't argue with that.

02:27:01.521 --> 02:27:02.122
[SPEAKER_06]: That's solid.

02:27:02.302 --> 02:27:03.182
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a solid argument.

02:27:03.202 --> 02:27:05.324
[SPEAKER_05]: That is some NeoGAF logic right there.

02:27:05.444 --> 02:27:07.245
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job, anonymous emailer.

02:27:07.886 --> 02:27:08.506
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job.

02:27:10.087 --> 02:27:16.172
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm having one of those moments where it's like, not sure if troll or... You know, you laugh about that.

02:27:16.592 --> 02:27:19.815
[SPEAKER_06]: But like over this week, I've been actually, I've had some downtime at work.

02:27:19.855 --> 02:27:22.677
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been going through the Microsoft retail training program.

02:27:23.037 --> 02:27:25.579
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I've been actually giving away some DLC codes I got from the...

02:27:27.420 --> 02:27:28.942
[SPEAKER_06]: But holy shit, man.

02:27:29.122 --> 02:27:32.605
[SPEAKER_06]: That is some of their arguments for the Xbox One.

02:27:32.865 --> 02:27:34.147
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you can play used games on it.

02:27:34.527 --> 02:27:37.510
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, yeah, cool.

02:27:38.991 --> 02:27:43.575
[SPEAKER_03]: All those games that have just sat around for years and years and I don't really feel like bringing them out again.

02:27:43.595 --> 02:27:45.037
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what would have really been news?

02:27:45.517 --> 02:27:48.400
[SPEAKER_05]: You can play all your last generation games on it as well.

02:27:48.480 --> 02:27:49.661
[SPEAKER_05]: It's backwards compatible.

02:27:50.682 --> 02:27:51.162
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you.

02:27:52.103 --> 02:27:58.665
[SPEAKER_05]: From people I know that are more casual gamers, like they like gaming, but they don't seek out shows like this or post to internet websites and things like that.

02:27:59.245 --> 02:28:04.106
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the number one bitch I hear is that, well, I don't want to get a PlayStation 4 if it's not going to play PlayStation 3 games.

02:28:04.766 --> 02:28:07.287
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, well, does the new Xbox play the other Xbox game?

02:28:07.347 --> 02:28:07.927
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

02:28:08.927 --> 02:28:10.828
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear that more than anything else.

02:28:11.528 --> 02:28:12.608
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand why.

02:28:13.248 --> 02:28:18.750
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably understand why because of all the graphic chips upgrades and the parts inside that have changed where that's not possible.

02:28:19.070 --> 02:28:20.010
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm just telling you,

02:28:22.188 --> 02:28:30.033
[SPEAKER_05]: The general public doesn't give a fuck because there's been other consoles that were backwards compatible that kind of instilled that in us.

02:28:30.333 --> 02:28:31.653
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii played the GameCube games.

02:28:31.693 --> 02:28:33.034
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii U plays the Wii games.

02:28:33.054 --> 02:28:35.455
[SPEAKER_05]: The Game Boys are usually backwards compatible and so forth.

02:28:35.475 --> 02:28:38.537
[SPEAKER_05]: And even Xbox 360 played some Xbox games.

02:28:38.617 --> 02:28:41.659
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 3s, when they were new, would play PlayStation 2 games.

02:28:41.939 --> 02:28:44.900
[SPEAKER_05]: PS2 did play PS1 games.

02:28:44.921 --> 02:28:45.441
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.

02:28:45.521 --> 02:28:47.462
[SPEAKER_05]: So there were some consoles in the past that kind of did that.

02:28:47.862 --> 02:29:00.677
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just saying the funny thing is that those consoles are the minority and especially like Nintendo history up until the Wii had no backwards compatibility console wise because they didn't fit in slots anymore.

02:29:01.418 --> 02:29:05.223
[SPEAKER_03]: And not to mention that shift from, you know, cartridge to disk just in general.

02:29:06.624 --> 02:29:08.305
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, same experience here.

02:29:08.425 --> 02:29:11.427
[SPEAKER_03]: I went out to brunch, lunch, something with a friend of mine.

02:29:11.687 --> 02:29:18.531
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was one of the very first things out of his mouth is that the PlayStation 4 isn't... And this was before I knew about the architecture switch.

02:29:19.091 --> 02:29:23.954
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, yeah, I hate Sony now because they're not playing all the games that I already own.

02:29:24.455 --> 02:29:24.675
[SPEAKER_03]: I said...

02:29:24.975 --> 02:29:27.778
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very strange, especially not even digital versions.

02:29:28.579 --> 02:29:32.063
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as I figured out why that's the case, it all made sense.

02:29:32.744 --> 02:29:33.685
[SPEAKER_03]: Same argument you just made.

02:29:34.286 --> 02:29:35.668
[SPEAKER_03]: Had another point, slipped my mind.

02:29:36.048 --> 02:29:36.569
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how it goes.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:37.260
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:29:38.061 --> 02:29:39.262
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we have another email here.

02:29:39.323 --> 02:29:40.564
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from RossDealUT.

02:29:42.125 --> 02:29:44.048
[SPEAKER_05]: RossDeal has a tendency to send the show novels.

02:29:44.548 --> 02:29:48.973
[SPEAKER_05]: RossDeal, I'm going to invite you to post this on our forums in its entirety because it's a little bit long.

02:29:48.993 --> 02:29:52.056
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I'm all about where every gamer has a voice, but it is still a three-hour show.

02:29:52.136 --> 02:29:53.838
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is quite the little novel here.

02:29:53.858 --> 02:29:56.961
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to try to get the gist of it here, but I'm going to be extremely paraphrasing.

02:29:56.981 --> 02:29:58.283
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you do that, remember TLDL.

02:29:59.884 --> 02:30:00.705
[SPEAKER_06]: and TLDR.

02:30:01.065 --> 02:30:03.407
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, bullet points are great.

02:30:03.787 --> 02:30:06.369
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that last email was a bunch of bullet points, right?

02:30:06.770 --> 02:30:10.272
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't want to... It's not that the email is bad.

02:30:10.373 --> 02:30:12.094
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just I only have a certain amount of time.

02:30:12.114 --> 02:30:14.596
[SPEAKER_05]: But the more I talk about the time frames, the longer we drag things out.

02:30:14.616 --> 02:30:16.778
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me read a portion of this email here from RossDLUT.

02:30:17.478 --> 02:30:22.601
[SPEAKER_05]: who basically was emailing us to talk about who won the last console generation.

02:30:22.641 --> 02:30:26.903
[SPEAKER_05]: He talked about that there were a few things that he kind of, you know, a few points he wanted to make about this.

02:30:26.963 --> 02:30:31.365
[SPEAKER_05]: And first off was, I learned the most popular system may not fit your particular needs.

02:30:31.726 --> 02:30:35.928
[SPEAKER_05]: While the Wii sold like absolute gangbusters, the games were stupidly few and far between.

02:30:36.208 --> 02:30:43.312
[SPEAKER_05]: And while I don't speak for anyone else, I found myself fighting against the controls in games like Super Mario Galaxy where I should have been having a stupendous time.

02:30:44.832 --> 02:30:47.494
[SPEAKER_05]: Secondly, I gave up AAA PC gaming.

02:30:47.794 --> 02:30:55.880
[SPEAKER_05]: This was the generation where it became 100% impossible to buy a PC game that didn't require an online authentication or other form of invasive DRM.

02:30:56.320 --> 02:31:10.029
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't bring myself so low as to pirate games, but between Steam's offline mode failing me numerous times and the PlayStation Network outage, I don't feel like any of the stuff I buy on a DRM platform is actually mine, so I abandoned those libraries and counted the loss as a lesson learned.

02:31:11.090 --> 02:31:14.012
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned not to trust one iota of what I'm told in the gaming media.

02:31:14.392 --> 02:31:15.593
[SPEAKER_05]: This show accepted, of course.

02:31:16.354 --> 02:31:20.559
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really consider ourselves gaming media, because we're not trying to break news.

02:31:21.139 --> 02:31:23.582
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just trying to talk about it.

02:31:23.882 --> 02:31:27.826
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also hate the term gaming enthusiast, because some news doesn't make us enthusiastic.

02:31:27.866 --> 02:31:29.668
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just gaming talkers.

02:31:30.749 --> 02:31:30.989
[SPEAKER_05]: Outro Music

02:31:48.139 --> 02:32:02.996
[SPEAKER_05]: he says in his email here this generation we saw gaming journalism degrade into the worst state it's been in since the crash of 83 reviews are made based on how big a franchise is not to appease publishers but to keep the fanboys off their asses um

02:32:03.576 --> 02:32:23.032
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned to love Killzone was something he said the franchise started office and also ran on the PlayStation 2 a laughable attempt at a Halo killer however the ensuing games have shown remarkable improvement both in gameplay and storytelling and it's been an absolute pleasure to see the progress Guerrilla Games has made let's see um

02:32:25.394 --> 02:32:26.415
[SPEAKER_05]: P.S.

02:32:26.595 --> 02:32:29.857
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys were wondering about what made a cult game.

02:32:30.278 --> 02:32:37.923
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to think of it in the same way as a cult movie, where it doesn't have a huge mainstream success, but instead finds a smaller, more dedicated, and enduring fanbase.

02:32:38.323 --> 02:32:47.290
[SPEAKER_05]: Showgirls and Rocky Horror may not have made a lot of money at the box office, but they'll likely be remembered long after people have forgotten about the latest superhero fad movie.

02:32:48.090 --> 02:32:50.612
[SPEAKER_05]: and PPS, the most important part of the entire email.

02:32:50.632 --> 02:32:50.892
[SPEAKER_05]: You ready?

02:32:51.332 --> 02:32:51.893
[SPEAKER_05]: PPS.

02:32:52.433 --> 02:32:53.074
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, Loki?

02:32:53.454 --> 02:32:56.096
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta up your game when it comes to parody porn names.

02:32:56.916 --> 02:33:00.098
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's some you can use next time the topic comes up on the house.

02:33:00.959 --> 02:33:02.460
[SPEAKER_05]: The Dark Knight Hardens.

02:33:03.721 --> 02:33:05.002
[SPEAKER_05]: Shaving Private Ryan.

02:33:05.472 --> 02:33:06.932
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even remember what the hell this was in reference to.

02:33:07.012 --> 02:33:11.034
[SPEAKER_05]: The Shawskank Redemption or the Cock of Steel.

02:33:12.314 --> 02:33:13.894
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking about porn on the last show.

02:33:13.934 --> 02:33:14.775
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure we were.

02:33:14.835 --> 02:33:15.655
[SPEAKER_05]: It was OLR.

02:33:15.715 --> 02:33:16.675
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking about porn.

02:33:17.195 --> 02:33:17.715
[SPEAKER_05]: It happens.

02:33:18.115 --> 02:33:18.596
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

02:33:19.076 --> 02:33:19.296
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:33:19.336 --> 02:33:20.376
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, RawSteelUT.

02:33:20.436 --> 02:33:25.758
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry I had to edit, but we got to keep things moving here because the show is already running long.

02:33:25.858 --> 02:33:30.759
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to email us some thoughts, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to do so.

02:33:31.239 --> 02:33:34.040
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also send us a tweet, twitter.com slash OLR.

02:33:34.660 --> 02:33:36.602
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:33:37.022 --> 02:33:37.382
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

02:33:37.923 --> 02:33:42.266
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we're mad and stuff and we're not gonna take it anymore.

02:33:59.017 --> 02:34:00.458
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason, would you like to start us off tonight?

02:34:01.238 --> 02:34:02.098
[SPEAKER_03]: I shall.

02:34:02.478 --> 02:34:07.921
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to traffic, F you to parking, F you to critical mass.

02:34:08.361 --> 02:34:21.526
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I love the human ingenuity and the things that, especially in San Francisco and Manhattan and any other completely over-full-to-the-brim location, what they have to deal with.

02:34:21.666 --> 02:34:24.207
[SPEAKER_03]: God bless people's ingenuity and the way that they make things work.

02:34:25.047 --> 02:34:26.547
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn, fuck Critical Mass.

02:34:26.968 --> 02:34:29.268
[SPEAKER_03]: That stuff's just frustrating.

02:34:29.288 --> 02:34:30.008
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's it.

02:34:31.989 --> 02:34:32.389
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Loki.

02:34:33.629 --> 02:34:35.950
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, F you the cookie clicker.

02:34:36.850 --> 02:34:38.070
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why I'm still playing this.

02:34:38.350 --> 02:34:38.710
[SPEAKER_05]: Amen.

02:34:40.091 --> 02:34:45.192
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, my F you of the week goes to my scale, because it told me something I didn't want to hear yesterday.

02:34:46.152 --> 02:34:47.112
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very angry at it.

02:34:48.012 --> 02:34:49.913
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so also F you to the, uh,

02:34:50.273 --> 02:34:51.014
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you next time.

02:35:02.836 --> 02:35:08.160
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get back into a few more gaming news stories and Twitter topics and Skype line and all that good stuff.

02:35:08.180 --> 02:35:11.783
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:35:12.043 --> 02:35:13.744
[SPEAKER_05]: But first, a couple more quick stories.

02:35:13.784 --> 02:35:14.004
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

02:35:14.104 --> 02:35:17.787
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you could just pick up one of those Wii Fit meters and then you could download Wii Fit U for free.

02:35:17.887 --> 02:35:22.931
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, and I could get the balance board out from under the TV, but Loki, it's so hard.

02:35:25.858 --> 02:35:26.158
[SPEAKER_05]: Cablebox

02:35:38.530 --> 02:35:39.431
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you have a story to read?

02:35:41.172 --> 02:35:44.774
[SPEAKER_03]: Today I've walked 7,500 miles and three and a half.

02:35:45.675 --> 02:35:48.096
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, not that many miles.

02:35:48.116 --> 02:35:50.938
[SPEAKER_03]: 7,500 steps and three and a half miles.

02:35:51.158 --> 02:35:52.139
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that, a Fitbit?

02:35:52.840 --> 02:35:53.520
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got a Fitbit?

02:35:53.760 --> 02:35:54.301
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you like that?

02:35:54.621 --> 02:35:56.302
[SPEAKER_05]: I really do.

02:35:56.402 --> 02:35:57.863
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it actually get you to walk more though?

02:35:57.883 --> 02:36:00.985
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I could get a Fitbit and be like, hey, look how much I walked today.

02:36:01.325 --> 02:36:01.705
[SPEAKER_05]: But like...

02:36:02.506 --> 02:36:03.407
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:36:25.720 --> 02:36:33.749
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not bragging rights, but I was actually just commenting on something of our good old buddy BigRedPim's post a couple days ago.

02:36:33.849 --> 02:36:37.032
[SPEAKER_03]: He's on a fitness kick right now, and he's already lighter than me.

02:36:37.193 --> 02:36:41.758
[SPEAKER_03]: He started a couple months ago, he's already lighter than me, and I need to really do the same.

02:36:42.598 --> 02:36:46.403
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's been the top of the Fitbit leaderboards for weeks now, and it's...

02:36:47.143 --> 02:36:49.304
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are Fitbit leaderboards?

02:36:49.444 --> 02:36:50.664
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, absolutely.

02:36:51.964 --> 02:36:56.686
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in my employer's group as well as I have my selection of friends.

02:36:56.846 --> 02:36:58.326
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is EPing to it?

02:36:58.366 --> 02:37:00.266
[SPEAKER_03]: There is EPing to it.

02:37:00.326 --> 02:37:05.768
[SPEAKER_03]: There are badges, there are goals, there is a good combination of everything to increase the...

02:37:06.568 --> 02:37:07.950
[SPEAKER_03]: Lower the barrier to entry.

02:37:08.070 --> 02:37:11.594
[SPEAKER_03]: Raise the motivation enough that you might actually get off your lazy ass and do it.

02:37:11.714 --> 02:37:12.535
[SPEAKER_05]: How much is a Fitbit?

02:37:13.295 --> 02:37:14.617
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranges from $70 to $120.

02:37:14.657 --> 02:37:16.138
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple different models.

02:37:16.158 --> 02:37:16.138
$70?

02:37:16.238 --> 02:37:16.419
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

02:37:20.399 --> 02:37:21.240
[SPEAKER_03]: Laura, that's a lot of money.

02:37:21.300 --> 02:37:22.041
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of money.

02:37:22.401 --> 02:37:25.004
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot of money for bragging rights about I walked more than you.

02:37:25.965 --> 02:37:29.809
[SPEAKER_05]: Then again, not getting thinner, just sitting here doing a radio show.

02:37:29.829 --> 02:37:33.112
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say just use your DS, but that unfortunately doesn't, that negates Fitbit at all.

02:37:33.152 --> 02:37:34.153
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking snacking too.

02:37:34.233 --> 02:37:35.695
[SPEAKER_05]: Snacking is my worst enemy.

02:37:35.795 --> 02:37:37.737
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I slap you when you go up to go get some more of them?

02:37:37.797 --> 02:37:38.758
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because I'm hungry.

02:37:39.399 --> 02:37:41.541
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too, but I'm not going to eat until freaking midnight.

02:37:41.801 --> 02:37:42.462
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, Loki.

02:37:42.482 --> 02:37:43.263
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want some pretzels?

02:37:44.003 --> 02:37:45.164
[SPEAKER_06]: and Loki.

02:37:45.844 --> 02:37:49.806
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so the inevitable has happened.

02:37:50.546 --> 02:38:00.731
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to bundle a Vita with a PlayStation 4 and sell it in the UK for an undetermined amount of money at some point.

02:38:02.552 --> 02:38:02.912
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

02:38:03.432 --> 02:38:04.873
[SPEAKER_06]: They're really pushing that second screen thing.

02:38:05.113 --> 02:38:06.694
[SPEAKER_06]: Remote play and all that fun stuff.

02:38:07.454 --> 02:38:10.856
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully you get a good price because I don't think they had a price on it.

02:38:13.379 --> 02:38:14.000
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it, huh?

02:38:14.020 --> 02:38:15.962
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think this will actually sell?

02:38:15.982 --> 02:38:18.145
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's an expensive bundle.

02:38:18.546 --> 02:38:25.395
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's at a good price, if you're saving quite a bit of money on it, then yeah, it should sell.

02:38:26.636 --> 02:38:29.219
[SPEAKER_06]: If there is no price break on it, then fuck them.

02:38:30.581 --> 02:38:36.649
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, this last story I have here doesn't totally have to do with gaming, but you know what?

02:38:37.530 --> 02:38:43.978
[SPEAKER_05]: It definitely has to do with tech, and it's got a lot of people talking this week, and I wanted to bring it up here on the show.

02:38:45.419 --> 02:38:48.984
[SPEAKER_05]: Y'all know the famous MP3 player, Winamp, right?

02:38:49.244 --> 02:38:50.445
[SPEAKER_03]: It really whips the llama's ass.

02:38:50.465 --> 02:38:56.287
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, with this little demo story about whooping the llama's ass or whatever Wesley Willis reject lyric that was.

02:38:57.668 --> 02:39:00.589
[SPEAKER_05]: Winamp was bought by America Online in June 1999.

02:39:00.649 --> 02:39:02.750
[SPEAKER_05]: America Online's still around.

02:39:02.870 --> 02:39:04.270
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's when the troubles began.

02:39:04.290 --> 02:39:08.272
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, guess who owns Joystick Blog and Wow Insider and all that?

02:39:08.692 --> 02:39:14.838
[SPEAKER_03]: TUAW and the Weblogs Network is owned by AOL Time Warner.

02:39:15.079 --> 02:39:18.002
[SPEAKER_05]: And Huffington Post is part of AOL now or the other way around, right?

02:39:18.122 --> 02:39:19.763
[SPEAKER_05]: So they've got some stuff.

02:39:19.783 --> 02:39:22.146
[SPEAKER_05]: They just, you know, dial up isn't really what they're known for anymore.

02:39:22.186 --> 02:39:25.289
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, they did have Winamp and they bought it in June 1999.

02:39:25.409 --> 02:39:28.292
[SPEAKER_05]: It is going to be shutting down.

02:39:28.693 --> 02:39:31.115
[SPEAKER_05]: Winamp is shutting down in exactly one month.

02:39:33.077 --> 02:39:33.478
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadness.

02:39:33.538 --> 02:39:35.901
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, this also includes Shoutcast, apparently.

02:39:36.101 --> 02:39:45.052
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, what was exciting is that there were some rumors going around, I don't know if there's any truth to this, that Microsoft was looking at buying them once AOL announced that they were going to shut them down.

02:39:45.412 --> 02:39:49.517
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why Microsoft would necessarily want them, but as somebody who, you know...

02:39:50.498 --> 02:39:51.178
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

02:40:12.588 --> 02:40:13.048
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:40:37.242 --> 02:40:37.742
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing changes.

02:40:37.842 --> 02:40:42.984
[SPEAKER_05]: So VOG Network's not going anywhere, but does this motivate us to possibly explore other options in 2014?

02:40:43.685 --> 02:40:45.005
[SPEAKER_05]: Eh, sure.

02:40:45.545 --> 02:40:51.288
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll tell you, Bobby and I are both very much of the school of thought of, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

02:40:53.168 --> 02:40:55.089
[SPEAKER_05]: And why are you wagging your finger at me, Jason?

02:40:56.829 --> 02:40:58.070
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm very counter to that.

02:40:58.090 --> 02:40:59.610
[SPEAKER_03]: I like new features and new things.

02:40:59.630 --> 02:41:02.251
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason was like, you're using Winamp 2.0.

02:41:03.912 --> 02:41:04.692
[SPEAKER_03]: You're using Winamp 2.0.

02:41:04.752 --> 02:41:07.233
[SPEAKER_03]: We had multiple revelations today.

02:41:07.313 --> 02:41:09.733
[SPEAKER_03]: He's using a 7-year-old MIRC.

02:41:10.053 --> 02:41:14.475
[SPEAKER_03]: He's using no shit Winamp 2.0, not even 5 with the 2.0 style.

02:41:14.775 --> 02:41:18.336
[SPEAKER_03]: He's using Internet Explorer 6 on this PC for fuck's sake.

02:41:19.296 --> 02:41:21.377
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm using Firefox to browse.

02:41:21.497 --> 02:41:23.237
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't actually use Internet Explorer.

02:41:23.297 --> 02:41:28.879
[SPEAKER_03]: Internet Explorer 6 is still present and I saw it jump up and I was almost in tears.

02:41:29.739 --> 02:41:33.740
[SPEAKER_03]: And XP, which has been dead for how many years?

02:41:34.020 --> 02:41:34.820
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, hold on, hold on.

02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:37.381
[SPEAKER_05]: This says that this Winamp is 5.572.

02:41:37.741 --> 02:41:38.281
[SPEAKER_05]: You lied to me.

02:41:38.621 --> 02:41:39.662
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just using the 2 style.

02:41:41.722 --> 02:41:42.163
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it.

02:41:42.243 --> 02:41:44.684
[SPEAKER_03]: There are certain situations that call for it.

02:41:44.904 --> 02:41:50.526
[SPEAKER_05]: 5.5 is not the newest though because I get a pop-up window every time I launch it saying, shouldn't you update your Winamp?

02:41:50.566 --> 02:41:53.547
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, no, fucking leave me alone because when I update things, they break.

02:41:54.808 --> 02:41:55.168
[SPEAKER_03]: Always.

02:41:55.268 --> 02:41:56.409
[SPEAKER_03]: I like doing new things.

02:41:56.509 --> 02:41:57.369
[SPEAKER_03]: I like new features.

02:41:58.650 --> 02:42:01.231
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a bleeding edge kind of guy, but I'm not far from it.

02:42:03.115 --> 02:42:30.661
[SPEAKER_05]: so alright anyhow VOG will continue until it really does break and we are forced to switch to something else or somebody sells us real good on the advantages of using something else which is always a possibility too possible Jason's eyes lit up I'm gonna get an email tomorrow reasons why you should be on IceCast alright that's what's gonna happen yeah anyways

02:42:31.441 --> 02:42:33.102
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that was it.

02:42:33.182 --> 02:42:41.546
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me now switch our status on our un-updated Skype, which I'm still using 6.6, even though I think there's a 7.0 now.

02:42:41.646 --> 02:42:42.946
[SPEAKER_05]: I refuse to update Skype.

02:42:44.847 --> 02:42:45.808
[SPEAKER_05]: I was on a call.

02:42:46.068 --> 02:42:47.008
[SPEAKER_05]: You can call us now.

02:42:47.028 --> 02:42:49.289
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or use the name on Skype, Orange Laundry.

02:42:49.749 --> 02:42:50.810
[SPEAKER_05]: I refuse to update Skype.

02:42:50.850 --> 02:42:52.931
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to get any calls from an Xbox One?

02:42:53.630 --> 02:42:54.230
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope so.

02:42:54.450 --> 02:42:54.870
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

02:42:55.110 --> 02:42:57.031
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've got an Xbox One, fire it up and give us a call.

02:42:57.311 --> 02:42:58.031
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're going to go to the phone.

02:42:58.051 --> 02:43:00.131
[SPEAKER_05]: The phone lines are already lighting up, so let's go to it.

02:43:00.531 --> 02:43:01.631
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:43:01.691 --> 02:43:02.292
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

02:43:02.952 --> 02:43:03.992
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Raven Stolfen.

02:43:04.092 --> 02:43:04.652
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me?

02:43:04.952 --> 02:43:05.852
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes, we can.

02:43:05.892 --> 02:43:07.232
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, and your video just popped up.

02:43:07.292 --> 02:43:07.773
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?

02:43:07.873 --> 02:43:08.293
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, good.

02:43:08.533 --> 02:43:08.993
[SPEAKER_05]: I got it.

02:43:09.673 --> 02:43:11.113
[SPEAKER_05]: You got your gold 3DS.

02:43:11.153 --> 02:43:12.013
[SPEAKER_05]: You just held it up there.

02:43:12.613 --> 02:43:13.894
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I also got the game with it.

02:43:14.034 --> 02:43:14.174
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

02:43:14.194 --> 02:43:14.854
[SPEAKER_08]: I must be stupid.

02:43:15.574 --> 02:43:15.974
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute.

02:43:15.994 --> 02:43:21.015
[SPEAKER_05]: You got the game and the console, even though the game's already on the console?

02:43:21.761 --> 02:43:32.328
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, what happened was, I was listening to your last week's show, and then I went like, you know, I bought the game at midnight with the rest of the Xbone people, and then I said, you know what, I'm gonna go buy it.

02:43:33.683 --> 02:43:34.964
[SPEAKER_05]: Raven's Dolphin Gets Naked

02:44:03.983 --> 02:44:04.383
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

02:44:04.903 --> 02:44:06.864
[SPEAKER_08]: Wish for what you don't need to know.

02:44:09.505 --> 02:44:14.806
[SPEAKER_05]: Raven, I can't help but notice behind you, I love that little Pikachu Pokemon banner thing you've got.

02:44:15.566 --> 02:44:18.527
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this is my little room that I broadcast on.

02:44:18.547 --> 02:44:20.788
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you have a little room, but this is the setup.

02:44:21.468 --> 02:44:24.709
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people call it a dining room, but we call it the broadcast room, yes.

02:44:25.478 --> 02:44:29.602
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's just a little room that I have posters of Grand Theft Auto and all that stuff.

02:44:29.642 --> 02:44:34.986
[SPEAKER_08]: So all the consoles are in here so I can just chill out, just shut the door and go like, go away!

02:44:35.427 --> 02:44:35.787
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

02:44:36.608 --> 02:44:37.769
[SPEAKER_05]: Every man needs a man cave.

02:44:38.789 --> 02:44:40.571
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this one's pretty small, but it's awesome.

02:44:41.011 --> 02:44:42.312
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the size, it's how you use it.

02:44:43.113 --> 02:44:47.317
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was calling because I'm sure you played Zelda.

02:44:48.698 --> 02:44:50.800
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it make the case for 3D for you as well?

02:44:52.330 --> 02:44:57.073
[SPEAKER_05]: I was already kind of like, I don't hate 3D.

02:44:58.074 --> 02:45:05.718
[SPEAKER_05]: It was always kind of a neat effect to me, but I don't think games should really rely on it either because there's so many people that can't see it, too.

02:45:06.519 --> 02:45:09.681
[SPEAKER_05]: But does it have impressive graphics?

02:45:10.161 --> 02:45:14.064
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it really show what 3DS can do with the 3D?

02:45:14.324 --> 02:45:14.984
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

02:45:15.404 --> 02:45:17.506
[SPEAKER_05]: I was really impressed with just like...

02:45:18.466 --> 02:45:33.379
[SPEAKER_05]: in the dungeons where you have the multiple levels how you can really see that top and bottom and just like when you jump off cliffs or my absolute favorite when you when you grab a chicken and then jump off a cliff and slowly fly down like yeah that stuff looks rad on a on the 3ds

02:45:34.580 --> 02:45:37.963
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I really enjoyed a lot of this game.

02:45:37.983 --> 02:45:46.050
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that it's top-down, and it really does look like you're looking down on the action, and it really looks very nice.

02:45:46.290 --> 02:45:46.491
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

02:45:46.911 --> 02:45:47.591
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's great.

02:45:47.672 --> 02:45:48.112
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

02:45:48.292 --> 02:45:51.975
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it makes a good case for not getting a 2DS.

02:45:53.743 --> 02:45:54.403
[SPEAKER_08]: It really does.

02:45:55.044 --> 02:45:58.286
[SPEAKER_08]: If anyone's playing on a 2DS, I feel you're missing out on something.

02:45:58.866 --> 02:46:01.748
[SPEAKER_08]: Just the depth of just seeing that go deeper.

02:46:01.848 --> 02:46:06.491
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something that... How are you liking the bigger screens now that you have a big DS?

02:46:06.711 --> 02:46:13.135
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, now it's like... I'm doing one of those things where it's like, how did I go so long with my regular 3DS?

02:46:13.235 --> 02:46:14.776
[SPEAKER_05]: How did I manage that?

02:46:14.796 --> 02:46:17.438
[SPEAKER_05]: Because now that I'm on the 3DS XL, I'm like, oh my god, this is so beautiful.

02:46:17.498 --> 02:46:17.838
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

02:46:19.179 --> 02:46:19.719
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so...

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:22.682
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's like a lot of different upgrade things.

02:46:22.822 --> 02:46:24.003
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the iPhones, right?

02:46:24.404 --> 02:46:31.090
[SPEAKER_05]: When I'm on the 4 for so long and then when I finally get the 5, it's like, God damn, how did I use that shitty phone for so long?

02:46:31.150 --> 02:46:32.692
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's the way tech works.

02:46:33.479 --> 02:46:34.239
[SPEAKER_08]: Tech is like that.

02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:35.700
[SPEAKER_08]: One last thing.

02:46:36.120 --> 02:46:38.801
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still keeping my purple 3DS because I'm still attached to it.

02:46:38.901 --> 02:46:41.702
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't transfer anything over because I have the circle pad.

02:46:42.122 --> 02:46:44.943
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have to keep everything nice and clean on this one.

02:46:45.023 --> 02:46:47.004
[SPEAKER_08]: So Mario Kart 7 can't come over.

02:46:47.564 --> 02:46:48.244
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, dang.

02:46:48.704 --> 02:46:50.885
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right because there's no circle pad for the XL, is there?

02:46:51.685 --> 02:46:51.866
[SPEAKER_05]: There is.

02:46:51.886 --> 02:46:54.466
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just I only have the circle pad for the 3DS.

02:46:54.547 --> 02:46:54.727
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotcha.

02:46:56.087 --> 02:47:03.552
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, I moved everything over and I bought a 32 gig card, 30 bucks at RadioShack, so I will never run into storage issues again.

02:47:04.153 --> 02:47:04.593
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the goal.

02:47:04.613 --> 02:47:05.374
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I need to do.

02:47:05.454 --> 02:47:18.563
[SPEAKER_08]: I have an 8 and a 16 and I'm debating like, alright, this is my default one and it looks like I might have to just make everything from scratch or either beat Revelations on the 3DS and then move it all over later.

02:47:18.783 --> 02:47:22.946
[SPEAKER_05]: I was rocking a 2 gig SD card on my original 3DS and I don't know how I did it.

02:47:23.126 --> 02:47:24.107
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how the hell I did it.

02:47:24.247 --> 02:47:25.388
[SPEAKER_05]: Fairly sure, I still am.

02:47:26.008 --> 02:47:26.288
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

02:47:27.129 --> 02:47:27.729
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not enough.

02:47:28.390 --> 02:47:32.392
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well Raven, I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls, but thank you so much for the call and the video chat.

02:47:32.432 --> 02:47:32.933
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate it.

02:47:32.993 --> 02:47:33.593
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, not at all.

02:47:33.793 --> 02:47:35.074
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad you can answer my call.

02:47:35.134 --> 02:47:35.374
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

02:47:35.454 --> 02:47:35.755
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace.

02:47:36.115 --> 02:47:36.315
[SPEAKER_05]: Later.

02:47:37.216 --> 02:47:38.096
[SPEAKER_05]: Always good to hear from Raven.

02:47:38.136 --> 02:47:40.057
[SPEAKER_03]: I do love the fact that you wave into the monitor.

02:47:40.178 --> 02:47:41.078
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I still wave.

02:47:41.398 --> 02:47:47.322
[SPEAKER_05]: God, here I am talking about we don't need a stinking video show and then I'm like, I keep playing into the video stuff.

02:47:47.923 --> 02:47:48.023
[SPEAKER_05]: Ugh.

02:47:49.335 --> 02:47:50.396
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:48:13.310 --> 02:48:18.614
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm right by the fridge, I still have leftover vanilla vodka Fuck yes, what's the old saying?

02:48:18.935 --> 02:48:34.987
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's to you, here's to me, best of friends will always be But if we should ever disagree, fuck you and here's to me You got that right Yes, cling, alright, sorry Ranma You didn't call in to sing drinking songs with me Even though it's probably a nice little sidebar But what is really on your mind tonight?

02:48:36.664 --> 02:48:39.967
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, it's happy hour somewhere, right?

02:48:40.107 --> 02:48:42.689
[SPEAKER_05]: It's happy hour at OLR, at vognetwork.com.

02:48:43.030 --> 02:48:51.377
[SPEAKER_05]: Between, well, we have the family-friendly bar between 5 o'clock and 6 o'clock Pacific, and then we have adults only, you know, 18 and up.

02:48:53.079 --> 02:48:54.720
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're so bad.

02:48:54.920 --> 02:48:55.861
[SPEAKER_01]: You're so bad.

02:48:56.081 --> 02:48:57.022
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not bad.

02:48:57.102 --> 02:49:00.105
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just, we have a family-friendly bar from 5 to 6.

02:49:00.145 --> 02:49:00.225
[SPEAKER_05]: True.

02:49:01.286 --> 02:49:05.208
[SPEAKER_01]: The Legend of Zelda A Link Between Worlds The Legend of Zelda A Link Between Worlds

02:49:23.516 --> 02:49:27.079
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, let's just say there was a reason why I was late to work on Friday.

02:49:28.159 --> 02:49:29.260
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, really?

02:49:30.441 --> 02:49:31.602
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yeah.

02:49:31.942 --> 02:49:37.146
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on the line amongst the people that were picking up PlayStation 4s and Xbox Ones.

02:49:39.347 --> 02:49:45.952
[SPEAKER_05]: So were you like Raven where there was like four people there, like little Nintendo camps in the line or was it just you or what?

02:49:47.389 --> 02:49:48.810
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:50:17.402 --> 02:50:18.002
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh!

02:50:18.983 --> 02:50:21.024
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a steampunk first person shooter.

02:50:21.364 --> 02:50:23.445
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reason why I want to pick it up.

02:50:24.105 --> 02:50:27.247
[SPEAKER_05]: As a convention goer, I can see where that's relevant to your interests.

02:50:29.108 --> 02:50:30.608
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so tell me more about Zelda.

02:50:30.628 --> 02:50:32.169
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about the game itself?

02:50:34.250 --> 02:50:37.151
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so surreal, especially on the XL.

02:50:37.532 --> 02:50:43.915
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a total throwback for me sitting there on the Super NES playing through the game from start to finish.

02:50:44.315 --> 02:50:46.596
[SPEAKER_01]: The music is just phenomenal.

02:50:47.739 --> 02:50:51.862
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have a couple of gripes with the game, but other than that, I'm enjoying it.

02:51:13.427 --> 02:51:25.635
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for me, I like the top-down view, but I remember from the Super NES version, from the top-down view, you could see more of Link's face and body, so it was more like the angle.

02:51:26.375 --> 02:51:32.279
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this version, all you can pretty much see is the top of the hero's head and his hair.

02:51:33.374 --> 02:51:34.475
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Nintendo Zelda

02:51:55.151 --> 02:52:08.445
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do know that I think it was with the first N64 game is when the lore of Zelda, the storyline split where you have adventures where it's just Link in the games and then there's a storyline where it's the hero.

02:52:09.066 --> 02:52:13.491
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm putting the game in thinking it's Link in a brand new adventure.

02:52:13.511 --> 02:52:14.792
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking it's going to pick up

02:52:16.351 --> 02:52:17.131
[SPEAKER_01]: Link to the Past

02:52:36.139 --> 02:52:36.940
[SPEAKER_01]: All the games are like that.

02:52:36.960 --> 02:52:41.763
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even from the Super NES one, you can name whatever, but you were still Link.

02:52:41.984 --> 02:52:44.065
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you do that on Twilight Princess and stuff?

02:52:44.285 --> 02:52:47.207
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you couldn't, but it's just been so long.

02:52:47.928 --> 02:52:49.409
[SPEAKER_05]: I always name them Link anyway.

02:52:49.449 --> 02:52:50.830
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of just don't notice it.

02:52:51.671 --> 02:52:51.871
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

02:52:53.839 --> 02:53:20.855
[SPEAKER_05]: that was like that was like my issue I'm like I'd rather play as Link I mean I don't mean to split hairs but that's how I kind of feel but you're the hero but the hero looks just like Link well it's like in Final Fantasy you can technically rename all the characters as well in almost all the Final Fantasy games you can rename the characters well at least until the instituted voice acting but like you know I can't play Final Fantasy 6 and not have like Terra and Locke and all that

02:53:22.096 --> 02:53:28.179
[SPEAKER_05]: I think everybody does that one playthrough where you start naming your characters butts, fart, penis.

02:53:29.800 --> 02:53:40.205
[SPEAKER_01]: See, for me, I renamed them as characters from Ranma 1.5, and I'm following through the storyline, and I'm picturing the personalities in the game.

02:53:40.545 --> 02:53:41.666
[SPEAKER_01]: It fits so well.

02:53:42.046 --> 02:53:43.167
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just that...

02:53:44.537 --> 02:53:45.739
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:53:58.277 --> 02:54:00.958
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that is a minor gripe, though, right?

02:54:00.978 --> 02:54:04.578
[SPEAKER_05]: Because at the end of the day, it doesn't really impact the game, which is fantastic.

02:54:05.218 --> 02:54:05.418
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

02:54:06.099 --> 02:54:18.721
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I was saying earlier in a chat about it, when I called A Link Between Worlds Second Quest, I say it's Second Quest, whereas if you remember in the first game, if you played through Second Quest, everything was different.

02:54:18.921 --> 02:54:19.101
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

02:54:19.181 --> 02:54:21.221
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you thought one thing was something else.

02:54:21.602 --> 02:54:23.082
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I'm seeing this game.

02:54:23.122 --> 02:54:23.362
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like...

02:54:24.471 --> 02:54:28.615
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is there, but when you go into certain locations, things have changed.

02:54:28.695 --> 02:54:34.641
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, wow, it's been 10, 15 years since I've been here, so there's more for me to explore.

02:54:34.901 --> 02:54:37.684
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if I go into this store, oh, this is something else.

02:54:39.085 --> 02:54:47.153
[SPEAKER_05]: That is true, but there's also the new mechanics to consider, especially the flattening yourself on the wall really kind of changes things and shows you more parts of the world that weren't even there.

02:54:47.233 --> 02:54:47.994
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess that's the point.

02:54:48.632 --> 02:54:48.772
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

02:54:48.792 --> 02:54:49.172
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:54:49.493 --> 02:54:52.975
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, Ranma, I'm going to let you go to try and squeeze in another call, but thanks for the call.

02:54:53.636 --> 02:54:54.397
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, anytime, bro.

02:54:54.497 --> 02:54:55.137
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, take care, buddy.

02:54:55.738 --> 02:54:56.779
[SPEAKER_05]: You too.

02:54:56.799 --> 02:54:57.139
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

02:54:57.159 --> 02:55:00.842
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give us a call.

02:55:01.202 --> 02:55:05.746
[SPEAKER_05]: We have time for at least one more call here if you are interested in talking with us tonight.

02:55:06.746 --> 02:55:07.907
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to get to Twitter topics.

02:55:07.967 --> 02:55:13.492
[SPEAKER_05]: I also want to ask Loki if he has any last-minute stories or if you are too busy clicking cookies over there.

02:55:13.914 --> 02:55:14.855
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I have last minute stories.

02:55:14.955 --> 02:55:15.716
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

02:55:15.776 --> 02:55:32.377
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently there's been reports that you can have some issues, maybe even possibly a band if you upload stuff to the upload studio on Xbox One with obscenities in there.

02:55:35.078 --> 02:55:40.099
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe it was a glitch or something, but there has been some reports regarding that.

02:55:41.299 --> 02:55:41.560
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:55:42.320 --> 02:55:48.462
[SPEAKER_05]: We got another call coming in, so let's get to it, and then we'll take whatever last-minute stories otherwise that Loki has.

02:55:48.842 --> 02:55:49.282
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to it.

02:55:49.322 --> 02:55:50.162
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

02:55:50.182 --> 02:55:50.522
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

02:55:53.663 --> 02:55:54.083
[SPEAKER_05]: Hola.

02:55:54.143 --> 02:55:55.564
[SPEAKER_05]: Bienvenidos a Orange Sounds Radio.

02:55:56.444 --> 02:55:56.704
[SPEAKER_05]: You there?

02:55:56.744 --> 02:55:57.084
[SPEAKER_05]: Call her.

02:55:59.780 --> 02:56:00.701
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, I don't know.

02:56:00.721 --> 02:56:05.023
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Skype seems to think the caller isn't there, so I'm going to have to let that call go.

02:56:05.523 --> 02:56:07.804
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about it, but go ahead and try again.

02:56:07.824 --> 02:56:13.527
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, Echo123 is your friend to test before you call.

02:56:13.547 --> 02:56:14.868
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't heard that in years.

02:56:15.068 --> 02:56:16.308
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

02:56:16.488 --> 02:56:16.688
[SPEAKER_05]: Echo123.

02:56:16.828 --> 02:56:17.209
[SPEAKER_05]: Echo123.

02:56:18.769 --> 02:56:24.032
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to see an Xbox One call, so please, if you have your Xbox One, I want to see what the quality looks like.

02:56:25.613 --> 02:56:27.974
[SPEAKER_05]: See you sitting on your couch there, giving a call.

02:56:30.406 --> 02:56:32.528
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I can give the voice command and it'll work.

02:56:32.988 --> 02:56:36.690
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox, Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:56:36.850 --> 02:56:39.292
[SPEAKER_05]: Now if somebody is playing, it's going to fuck them up.

02:56:39.372 --> 02:56:40.733
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I had to.

02:56:41.013 --> 02:56:42.114
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox, open Skype.

02:56:44.675 --> 02:56:46.076
[SPEAKER_05]: Now everybody's going to go hit stop.

02:56:46.156 --> 02:56:47.237
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we're getting another call here.

02:56:47.857 --> 02:56:48.938
[SPEAKER_03]: If I did, I apologize.

02:56:49.058 --> 02:56:50.019
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, yeah, I know, right?

02:56:50.519 --> 02:56:51.340
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:56:51.360 --> 02:56:51.680
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

02:56:55.346 --> 02:56:56.067
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello!

02:56:56.307 --> 02:56:59.408
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead and mute the... I think they got scared.

02:57:00.909 --> 02:57:02.569
[SPEAKER_05]: Mute your radio before you call in.

02:57:02.609 --> 02:57:03.650
[SPEAKER_05]: That's always a good idea.

02:57:04.810 --> 02:57:06.111
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise we hear ourselves echoing.

02:57:06.151 --> 02:57:06.831
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little awkward.

02:57:06.891 --> 02:57:08.031
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the name I didn't recognize.

02:57:08.111 --> 02:57:08.412
[SPEAKER_05]: Echo 1, 2, 3 again.

02:57:08.432 --> 02:57:08.492
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

02:57:14.754 --> 02:57:18.096
[SPEAKER_05]: or maybe that person just accidentally called us because of what you did.

02:57:18.116 --> 02:57:22.418
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you're the one that said Skype or is on radio.

02:57:22.599 --> 02:57:23.959
[SPEAKER_03]: I just said open Skype.

02:57:24.219 --> 02:57:24.600
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

02:57:24.620 --> 02:57:24.960
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

02:57:25.020 --> 02:57:26.261
[SPEAKER_03]: You went the whole nine yards.

02:57:26.461 --> 02:57:29.122
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be really funny because that person hung up right away.

02:57:29.222 --> 02:57:30.403
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that really did dial.

02:57:30.523 --> 02:57:30.943
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

02:57:31.764 --> 02:57:32.644
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we try it again?

02:57:33.465 --> 02:57:35.366
[SPEAKER_05]: No, don't do it again.

02:57:35.406 --> 02:57:36.446
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to get hate mail.

02:57:36.486 --> 02:57:37.047
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, go ahead.

02:57:37.627 --> 02:57:38.648
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have more last minute stories.

02:57:40.228 --> 02:57:40.509
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't.

02:57:41.469 --> 02:57:42.130
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, goddamn.

02:57:42.470 --> 02:57:42.650
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

02:57:43.328 --> 02:57:49.069
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let me... I'm trying to pull up our Twitter, but I got sidetracked.

02:57:49.289 --> 02:57:50.790
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know we had some tweets here tonight.

02:57:51.870 --> 02:57:52.310
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

02:57:53.250 --> 02:57:57.731
[SPEAKER_05]: YYR tweets us, Guess what comes out for 3DS in North America and Europe in four days?

02:57:58.431 --> 02:58:01.692
[SPEAKER_05]: Space Harrier and Super Hang-On in glorious 3D.

02:58:01.912 --> 02:58:02.472
[SPEAKER_05]: Insta-buy.

02:58:02.893 --> 02:58:03.993
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot about those.

02:58:04.153 --> 02:58:05.373
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited about that as well.

02:58:05.413 --> 02:58:08.194
[SPEAKER_05]: Too bad DarkSakura's not here tonight to give you a little squee, but...

02:58:09.734 --> 02:58:10.815
[SPEAKER_07]: Squeak, squeak.

02:58:10.995 --> 02:58:13.156
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you go.

02:58:13.216 --> 02:58:13.716
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

02:58:15.457 --> 02:58:20.580
[SPEAKER_05]: Gally89 tweeted us this little acapella Mega Man 2 Wily stage.

02:58:20.940 --> 02:58:23.622
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't screen the YouTube first, so I'm not going to play it right now.

02:58:24.542 --> 02:58:28.864
[SPEAKER_05]: But I love seeing that type of remixed homegrown stuff on YouTube.

02:58:29.305 --> 02:58:29.825
[SPEAKER_05]: Always fun.

02:58:30.505 --> 02:58:45.472
[SPEAKER_05]: uh CatastrophicMagi also excited about Atlas announcing Persona 5 giving us the links just in case we missed it um Dungeon Buster says first thing I thought of listening to Yakuza 5's Battle of Pride was OLR makes me sad it's not getting localized

02:58:46.312 --> 02:58:47.713
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I got to give this as a shout out too.

02:58:47.733 --> 02:58:49.973
[SPEAKER_05]: This came in through our Twitter and I got to say hi to this.

02:58:50.313 --> 02:58:52.094
[SPEAKER_05]: This came from Video Game Bang.

02:58:52.854 --> 02:58:56.215
[SPEAKER_05]: And they said, hi, you're a Sacramento Gaming podcast.

02:58:56.616 --> 02:58:58.336
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a Sacramento Gaming podcast.

02:58:58.696 --> 02:58:59.777
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's be friends.

02:59:00.597 --> 02:59:03.778
[SPEAKER_05]: So shout out to our new frenzies at Video Game Bang.

02:59:04.078 --> 02:59:06.619
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did reply and said, okay, BFFs forever.

02:59:07.019 --> 02:59:07.719
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

02:59:07.799 --> 02:59:08.640
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

02:59:08.700 --> 02:59:09.900
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello to Video Game Bang.

02:59:10.200 --> 02:59:17.784
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I'm going to be honest, it's just the Pervo in me, but every time I look at the name, I see Video Gangbang, and I'm like, I need to get glasses there.

02:59:17.844 --> 02:59:19.045
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not.

02:59:19.245 --> 02:59:20.525
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it's a fantastic show.

02:59:20.585 --> 02:59:21.646
[SPEAKER_05]: I will check it out this week.

02:59:22.066 --> 02:59:23.447
[SPEAKER_05]: Both are fantastic shows.

02:59:24.047 --> 02:59:24.227
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

02:59:24.247 --> 02:59:25.288
[SPEAKER_05]: I said both of those.

02:59:25.308 --> 02:59:26.709
[SPEAKER_05]: Both are fantastic shows.

02:59:27.489 --> 02:59:29.710
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure that is true as well.

02:59:29.731 --> 02:59:32.572
[SPEAKER_05]: I will check out Video Game Bang later this week.

02:59:33.013 --> 02:59:34.814
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't it be funny if they live next door?

02:59:36.115 --> 02:59:36.995
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.

02:59:37.215 --> 02:59:38.276
[SPEAKER_05]: They're in Sac somewhere.

02:59:38.296 --> 02:59:40.657
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we knock on the wall and find out?

02:59:40.918 --> 02:59:46.241
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not far from Sac State, so I'm sure there's a lot of stuff that brews out of the college there.

02:59:48.542 --> 02:59:49.663
[SPEAKER_05]: The phones are ringing one more time.

02:59:49.763 --> 02:59:52.745
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to try and take this call and then we'll wrap up.

02:59:52.805 --> 02:59:53.686
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:59:53.706 --> 02:59:54.006
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

02:59:57.537 --> 02:59:59.178
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, you're on Orange Sounds Radio, who's this?

02:59:59.959 --> 03:00:04.283
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, this is Amiga777, one year later.

03:00:04.703 --> 03:00:07.906
[SPEAKER_04]: There you are, you made it, Amiga777, what's up buddy?

03:00:09.728 --> 03:00:19.857
[SPEAKER_00]: That was me that I guess tried to call earlier and ended up with the sound from the radio coming in and it didn't.

03:00:20.532 --> 03:00:23.075
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, 50 points from Gryffindor, but what's on your mind?

03:00:23.796 --> 03:00:34.450
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, basically I figured out the reason why there wasn't a whole lot of midnight releases or campouts for Wii U last year.

03:00:35.071 --> 03:00:35.872
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically...

03:00:37.288 --> 03:00:55.669
[SPEAKER_00]: as it turns out because it was done on a Sunday I guess as it usually is a lot of the big box retail stores didn't want to do any midnight releases I guess they figured it wouldn't be you know like a commercially safe thing to do Jesus would not approve

03:00:57.230 --> 03:00:58.530
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.

03:01:00.591 --> 03:01:02.092
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming that's what it is.

03:01:02.212 --> 03:01:05.313
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially in some parts of the company, you don't mess around with Sundays.

03:01:05.453 --> 03:01:09.975
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially asking people to stay up all night till midnight when there's church the next day.

03:01:10.535 --> 03:01:11.616
[SPEAKER_05]: That is asking too much.

03:01:12.336 --> 03:01:13.437
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially in some places.

03:01:15.417 --> 03:01:17.638
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a far-fetched theory, to be honest.

03:01:17.999 --> 03:01:20.640
[SPEAKER_05]: But could it also be true that maybe the demand just wasn't there?

03:01:21.720 --> 03:01:25.182
[SPEAKER_05]: I seem to think the Wii U sold pretty well initially.

03:01:25.902 --> 03:01:26.723
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

03:01:45.423 --> 03:01:54.926
[SPEAKER_05]: BlackWolf in our chatroom wants to point out, I got my Wii U at a midnight release, so there were stores that did a midnight release for the Wii U, so maybe it just depends on where you were at.

03:01:55.447 --> 03:01:59.448
[SPEAKER_05]: But Amiga777, where are you at with these next-gen consoles?

03:01:59.468 --> 03:02:00.748
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you picked any of them up?

03:02:01.209 --> 03:02:04.630
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you Team Sony, Team Nintendo, Team Microsoft, or all teams?

03:02:04.850 --> 03:02:05.850
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's your head at with this?

03:02:07.531 --> 03:02:07.591
[SPEAKER_00]: Um...

03:02:09.154 --> 03:02:10.954
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm personally not on any team yet.

03:02:12.275 --> 03:02:18.376
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you could say federally enough, I'm probably just still Team Sega.

03:02:18.756 --> 03:02:19.716
[SPEAKER_00]: Dreamcast, that is.

03:02:21.216 --> 03:02:21.776
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

03:02:21.836 --> 03:02:23.577
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a lot of people that can't let go.

03:02:24.677 --> 03:02:27.438
[SPEAKER_05]: You do know they remake all those games for the newer consoles, right?

03:02:27.478 --> 03:02:28.178
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I understand.

03:02:28.518 --> 03:02:29.418
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes, definitely.

03:02:29.658 --> 03:02:30.378
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that.

03:02:30.658 --> 03:02:33.259
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I do have a 360 now.

03:02:33.699 --> 03:02:35.159
[SPEAKER_00]: I play it once in a while, but...

03:02:35.900 --> 03:02:37.181
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what it's going to take?

03:02:37.561 --> 03:02:40.304
[SPEAKER_05]: First console to get Shenmue 3 announced for it?

03:02:40.564 --> 03:02:41.125
[SPEAKER_05]: Instant win?

03:02:41.685 --> 03:02:42.386
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.

03:02:43.467 --> 03:02:43.987
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

03:02:44.388 --> 03:02:47.531
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, AmigaBuddy, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for the call.

03:02:48.492 --> 03:02:49.333
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, take care.

03:02:50.534 --> 03:02:51.054
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

03:02:52.336 --> 03:02:54.438
[SPEAKER_05]: First console to get Shenmue 3 as an exclusive.

03:02:54.658 --> 03:02:54.978
[SPEAKER_05]: You win.

03:02:56.219 --> 03:02:56.560
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

03:02:57.040 --> 03:02:58.101
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for Last Minute Stories.

03:02:58.402 --> 03:02:59.923

[SPEAKER_05]: I will certainly take you up on that.

03:04:29.790 --> 03:04:30.410
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, sounds good.

03:04:31.110 --> 03:04:33.551
[SPEAKER_05]: As I always ask people, do you have a final thought tonight on the show?

03:04:35.129 --> 03:04:41.613
[SPEAKER_03]: No, get this podcast up so I can re-listen to it for the two-hour drive back to San Francisco.

03:04:41.813 --> 03:04:46.255
[SPEAKER_05]: I will work on it, but tonight I'm going to have the YouTube challenge too, so we'll see.

03:04:46.295 --> 03:04:47.035
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been here.

03:04:47.836 --> 03:04:52.378
[SPEAKER_03]: I also have a backlog of 30 hours of music podcasts that I have to get through too.

03:04:52.438 --> 03:04:55.060
[SPEAKER_05]: Support whatever independent podcast you can think of.

03:04:55.100 --> 03:04:56.641
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure this isn't the only one you listen to.

03:04:56.661 --> 03:04:57.541
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, absolutely.

03:04:57.981 --> 03:05:00.963
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, I'm quick to recommend those at vognetwork.com.

03:05:00.983 --> 03:05:02.364
[SPEAKER_05]: You can always listen to Video Game Bang.

03:05:03.204 --> 03:05:04.646
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

03:05:04.666 --> 03:05:05.727
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a new one for you to try.

03:05:06.207 --> 03:05:06.788
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me how it is.

03:05:07.028 --> 03:05:08.129
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't listened to it yet, but I will.

03:05:10.592 --> 03:05:13.915
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, thank you as always for being here, even though you don't have a choice.

03:05:15.917 --> 03:05:17.059
[SPEAKER_05]: Any final thoughts for us tonight?

03:05:17.960 --> 03:05:18.200
[SPEAKER_05]: 20 is suck.

03:05:22.591 --> 03:05:23.592
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a cookie clicker thing?

03:05:23.792 --> 03:05:24.292
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

03:05:24.933 --> 03:05:25.594
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a real thing.

03:05:25.774 --> 03:05:27.375
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I hope everybody's okay.

03:05:27.495 --> 03:05:28.956
[SPEAKER_06]: No, everything's fine.

03:05:29.097 --> 03:05:34.961
[SPEAKER_06]: I mentioned on Twitter, my company that I work for, their warehouse got hit by a fire.

03:05:34.981 --> 03:05:36.823
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I saw that earlier in the week.

03:05:36.883 --> 03:05:38.164
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so awful.

03:05:38.184 --> 03:05:39.405
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the Ohio stuff?

03:05:39.705 --> 03:05:43.789
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there was a lot of really unfortunate stuff in the Midwest this week.

03:05:44.169 --> 03:05:45.250
[SPEAKER_06]: But, and...

03:05:47.231 --> 03:06:14.236
[SPEAKER_06]: 3 damaged PS4s out of the whole thing got crushed by the roof well, damaged by the roof because the roof fell on the whole pallet of them and I'm trying again to send them to me I'll fix them between 3 systems I'm sure there's enough parts if not to get at least one of those working fix it Loki besides, the insurance is covering the cost of those anyways it's not like they're losing money they're just going to throw them away anyways

03:06:14.976 --> 03:06:40.492
[SPEAKER_05]: all right and last but not least my final thought tonight and my final thought would be you know what um i know there's a lot of uh there's been a lot of positivity and negativity on tonight's show and there is a lot out there in the gaming industry but you know there's there's a lot of good stuff going on right now so whether you're team we team sony team xbox or what have you just just go have fun there's like a million games to play right now it's the best time of year to be a gamer have fun team pc team we

[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, shut up.

03:06:43.015 --> 03:06:46.239
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever team you're on, have fun and don't be a dick.

03:06:46.780 --> 03:06:47.641

[SPEAKER_05]: Have a safe holiday, those of you in the US, and we'll talk to you again in seven days.
