10091	12312	Sky, and Loki.
14034	14974	It's here, it's here.
15094	17976	Blizzard has finally announced their Don't Call It A MOBA Hero Battler.
18276	22159	Also, Sony released the PlayStation 4 and the player media has been at a fever pitch.
22439	23360	What have people been saying?
23600	24220	What's gone wrong?
24440	26702	Find out all this and so much more right now.
31670	36594	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36674	42919	It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 527 for this November the 17th of 2013.
44580	50645	My name is Rob Roberts joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and gaming lols.
51105	53147	And thank you for being here by the way after a week off.
53547	54108	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
71889	75450	It's about a six or six and a half hour drive back from LA, right?
75730	76491	So I'm in the car the whole time.
76511	80712	And Alan's there too, but there's only so much talking you can do and at some point it's just you staring through.
80732	81692	And playing what game am I thinking of?
82032	82973	Yeah, that kind of thing.
83373	85133	We did listen to Bobby's show, I will say that.
85173	86394	We were somewhere in the middle of...
87094	88155	I don't freaking know anywhere.
88175	90277	Probably about an hour south of Santa Nella.
90337	91058	Probably Harris Ranch.
91358	92940	You California people that know your I-5.
93200	95742	I was around Harris Ranch when Bobby's show came on.
96063	97964	So that entertained us a little ways.
98044	101948	But then the whole way home, I'm just going, and this is where OLR will be starting.
102949	104811	And here's where Jamie will be doing the classic game of the week.
105952	107854	And here's where she'd be throwing a fit about reading emails.
108594	110416	I didn't throw a fit.
111697	118224	But just kind of going through that whole like, you know, after so many years of doing something, it's kind of like, I should be doing this right now, but I'm not.
118344	120546	We know when we're behind and we know when we're ahead.
120826	121447	That's right.
122188	123389	Well, I hope you had a good week off.
123429	124570	It was restful and all that stuff.
125390	125930	I slept.
126471	128411	That's a great way to spend the time.
128531	129111	Sleep is good.
129151	130032	That's what Sundays are for.
130592	132192	Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.
132352	132532	Hi.
132873	133273	Hi, Loki.
133293	133653	How are you?
134313	134533	Fine.
134913	137534	You sound like you might need to be doing a little more sleeping yourself.
138214	138534	What happened?
138554	139255	Did you catch a cold?
139935	140215	Yeah.
140435	141955	Did you bring disease to the show tonight?
142115	143856	I've been staying up late at night.
144662	148625	Oh, is that because of Josh, or just, you're just doing projects?
148705	149766	Yes, it's because of Josh.
151107	155269	And totally not because I was playing Cookie Clicker last night.
155730	156470	Wait a minute!
156890	157891	Cookie Clicker?
158351	159212	Really, Loki?
159472	160293	I got bored!
160453	171340	I got bored last night because, what is it, uh... Nellie was messing around on Reddit, and so I was talking with her, and I was like, I don't want to browse Reddit anymore, and I remember hearing about Cookie Clicker...
172561	175363	reading about Cookie Clicker and then I'm like, let's see what this thing is.
175904	178065	So I tried it out and yeah.
178766	186511	You kind of missed the train, Loki, because Cookie Clicker was all the rage on my other show, Horde House, about two months ago and I think we're all over it now, but you're late to the party.
186551	187172	That's alright.
187212	188813	I just need to finish it and then I'll be done.
189861	191782	I didn't realize there was an end to Cookie Clicker.
192883	194824	I played the iPhone knockoff one.
196485	197266	It isn't the same.
197306	198807	They really need to put out an official one.
199527	200288	For the record?
200928	201169	No.
202029	203250	You're not going to get into Cookie Clicker?
203410	203890	Hell no.
203990	206072	What about the other iPhone game I've been playing?
206172	209114	I can't believe I got sucked into this garbage all over again.
209454	211696	I really want to thank Kethervis if she's out there listening.
211716	216539	I don't think she listens to OLR, but if she is, I'm doing that whole warning shots at you right now.
216939	219421	She got me addicted to Tiny Death Star.
220301	220862	Have you seen this?
221302	222403	Yes, and I'm not playing it either.
222564	234755	It's Tiny Tower with the LucasArts franchise with all the Vader and Palpatine and all the characters and cute little MIDI-style Death Star music while it's playing.
234935	235676	I still refuse.
235956	236517	You refuse?
236557	237317	It's probably for the best.
238218	242979	The only thing that makes me upset about Tiny Death Star... We'll get into real games in a minute, I promise.
243239	247620	The only thing that makes me upset about Tiny Death Star is that you can't rename all the stores.
248060	251861	Because that was the best part of Tiny Tower, which is based off his renaming the stores.
252081	256522	Because Alan would always rename his stores to these hilarious things.
256602	258663	Of course, I can't even remember any of them off the top of my head.
259043	260543	Alan, what were some of your funny stores?
260903	262443	You remember any of them on Tiny Tower?
262904	263504	He's shaking his head.
263524	264624	I wish I could bring it up and see.
264884	270556	I know I had a restaurant called Poops RS Yeah Just because I was thinking that it gave people diarrhea
270956	276597	Well, there was the apartment complex I built in the Death Star was... Let me look.
276637	279658	I'm trying to... I'm actually pulling it up as we are live here.
280318	281938	You can pull up our chat room if you're listening live.
281958	285039	Oh, you named it Ewok Shits.
285199	294221	You can't participate with the show live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
294721	299142	And if you are listening live, come join us in chat, live.vognetwork.com.
299642	300122	Ah, here it is.
300222	300342	The
300842	304634	Felucia Apartments is one of the apartments I have.
304674	308506	So I was going to rename it to By Felucia, but I couldn't rename it.
310279	310759	Very sad.
310919	312481	Sad trombone.
312541	313261	Womp womp.
313982	314702	All right, anyhow.
315803	317984	We're going to get into our gaming weeks and all that good stuff.
318885	321667	We'll talk about all that and what we've been doing with the week.
321707	326130	But we got a lot of stuff to catch up on too after being gone last week.
326410	328571	Oh, Alan came and he brought in his tiny tower.
329132	329532	Let me read.
330012	330112	What?
330132	330953	It's still loading.
330973	331673	Oh, it's still loading?
332814	333935	Live radio, everybody.
334335	358492	I think I deleted it like a year ago Yeah, I finally deleted mine off the phone too Let me look at our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com Tim Tripp in chat says, I actually played Tiny Death Star for about 30 minutes Which is 25 more minutes than I usually spend with an iPhone game Dungeon Buster says, I'm playing Tiny Death Star, never played Tiny Towers before so this is new to me So I guess if it hasn't worn off yet then that's good
359378	385236	The Volleyball Gym is called Sandy Balls The Glassworks is called Here Blow This The Breakfast Place is called Enough Fucking Pancakes The Greenhouse Florist is called Dankweed 420 So, yeah And I see your computer lab is called Sierra Online in a nod There you go Those weren't even his funniest ones, but that's alright, there's some funny ones in there
385751	393077	All right, okay, before we get into our gaming weeks and the types of the games that we've been doing this week, we have to settle a few things from when we were gone last week.
393438	394439	We weren't here last week.
395219	400144	I was in Anaheim, sort of at BlizzCon, meaning I didn't go to actual BlizzCon.
400204	402886	I just went to all the parties, and then I went to Disneyland, which is right next door.
403427	405388	And I'll tell you what, that was the way to do it.
405749	406549	I had a great time.
407230	411554	Met a lot of awesome people and all that, and I'll talk more about BlizzCon a little later in the show when we get to some of that news.
413670	424434	But one of the cliffhangers we left with last week, or excuse me, two weeks ago, was that we were talking about kind of the end of the last generation with PlayStation 3 and so forth, and the start of the new one.
424734	434017	And I mentioned that I was waffling on the PlayStation 4, and I wasn't sure if I was going to get one, and I had my pre-order through Amazon, and was I going to keep it, was I going to cancel it, da-da-da-da-da.
434857	440644	Um, Wii U, you might remember a year ago, I never bothered pre-ordering a Wii U. I said, I'm not going to get it.
440684	441405	I'm not going to get it.
441666	443348	The day the Wii U comes out, what did I do?
443428	445310	I went and bought one at Target, right?
445811	447112	So what happened with the PlayStation 4?
448354	450736	I did not buy the PlayStation 4.
451578	453580	I canceled my pre-order when I got back from Disneyland.
454204	456065	You're a wise, wise fellow.
456086	457166	Well, here's the thing.
457707	460349	And a part of me actually feels kind of bad.
461309	463691	Because at Disney, I had a great time at Disney.
463751	467154	Like Alan and I had a great time on Friday and the park wasn't very crowded.
467474	470997	But then Saturday, randomly, an old friend of mine...
471557	472358	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
491195	491856	Sway Me Drive Home Sunday
514554	542345	absolutely Diablo 3 on Playstation 4 looks great even though I already played it on PC I enjoy the controls on Playstation 3's demo and I will give the game another try on Playstation 4 absolutely Final Fantasy 14 will be in beta on the Playstation 4 and then I do want to get the Need for Speed game at some point but next year some other things to look forward to Infamous Second Son obviously and Destiny I mean that's all in the first half next year so I'm
542865	548489	Sure, between now and then, I will end up buying a PlayStation 4, but I'm going to be perfectly honest with you guys.
548609	555513	Despite all this console wars and whether you're cheering me or booing me for my decision, money played a big part of it too.
556894	560756	Might have gone over budget a little bit when we were in Hanaheim, so whoops.
561256	561937	Womp womp.
563658	571362	Going to the chat room at live.vognetwork.com, Ross Steel UT says, So the Wii U was worth more at launch than the PlayStation 4?
574573	577083	I'm... This is not going to be a popular answer.
577485	577706	Yes.
580911	608780	and the reason why I say yes is at least on the Wii U and you can call me fanboy all you want I don't give a fuck but on the Wii U at least there was the Mario Brothers which I really wanted to play the Super Mario Brothers Wii U and there was Zombie U and yeah I wanted to play Nintendo Land 2 I mean that was three games at launch that I said I really want to play these games I couldn't do that with PlayStation 4 I couldn't sit there and go these are four games I have to play right now
609600	610261	I couldn't do that.
610961	617366	Now, obviously, we all know that Wii U lost a lot of steam over its first year release and I'm not going to try and defend that.
618127	620048	There should have been more in the pipeline and what have you.
620529	631598	I think that's where PlayStation 4 will outpace Wii U is because I'm looking at the first half of next year going, this looks very exciting for PlayStation 4 with all those games I just named.
631978	636582	So in that regard, which I would argue is more...
637122	641005	Crucial to the system's future than the launch.
641385	643887	The next six months look very good for PlayStation 4.
647290	648451	Let's see, also going to the chat room.
648471	649092	I didn't get one either.
649812	651313	Yeah, neither did Loki.
651494	654576	You guys had already kind of locked that in a couple weeks ago, but I know I was waffling.
654596	659720	It just has to do with the bullshit of launches these days, of system launches, the way they go these days.
660200	665465	If there aren't the games that are going to be out... Let me rephrase that because I can't apparently speak proper English today.
666225	683790	if the games that I want to play are not out when the system launches then buying the system is buying a giant paperweight I would rather wait till the issues get worked out I would rather wait until there's a library that's worth me actually putting some money on and my hundred dollar gift card will last me a while yeah so and um
685631	688294	I am still planning on getting that Zelda 3DS I want and Mario 3D World next week.
688314	689636	Do you know when Fire Emblem's out?
699344	702805	to be fair, there's never been a system that had a five-star launch lineup.
728260	729443	Dreamcast had good games when it came out.
736721	764320	Dreamcast was decent, yeah Sonic Adventure by itself was a great game I remember Super Nintendo was really weak but it had Mario World which was like, you know Nobody cared there's Mario World Exactly Also, there's another one I'm trying to think through Genesis Launch was really crappy as far as games go because it was just the standard Sega fare There was no Sonic Was it like an Alex Kidd game?
765300	765560	Mm-hmm.
765780	766601	Yeah.
766721	768481	Altered Beast, I'm pretty sure was the launch title.
768561	769041	Columns.
769962	770362	Alan's here.
770622	776184	I was trying to think pop quiz-wise, there were five or six launch week Super Nintendo games.
776224	778785	It was SimCity, Pilotwings, right?
779045	779885	Super Mario World.
780885	783666	I want to say Final Fantasy II, but no, that came out a couple months later.
783686	784507	It was launch window.
784887	785127	Yeah.
785247	786287	Within like six months of it.
786347	788128	Because there were just like the four or five.
788308	790689	There was also the Super Scope games.
791429	793711	No, no, SuperScope came way later.
794371	798655	Actually, Alan, I think those ones you named, I don't remember, was F-Zero at launch?
799575	799876	No.
800016	805280	But I think the ones you named were like, I think first party were like the only ones, yeah.
805400	813065	It was Pilotwings, the Nintendo sort of green hair professor port of SimCity and Mario World.
813105	815087	Those were the big three from Nintendo.
815107	815187	Okay.
816288	841402	I thought that first week there were five I'm trying to think what the other two were someone would compete in chat um now I'm trying to I'm getting asked some questions about the Xbox one and where my head's at with that I'm gonna be honest guys I kind of counted that out a while ago because the hundred dollar price tag it's a little more up there and the launch games to me didn't like didn't counterbalance that like yes I know it's getting killer instinct but I'm kind of on
841582	870792	I think the launch games sound a little bit better like Forza 5 sounds pretty awesome and Dead Rising 3 the thing with Dead Rising 3 is it's just like kind of the whole series Dead Rising you know I bought it I have fun with it for about a week and then I get bored with it really fast and so the same thing happened I got Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising 2 off the record and I got bored with those so fast you'd think that would be impossible being that's a sandbox zombie game but Dead Rising 3 I think I'd just get bored with really fast
871252	875115	Just so you know, Alan, looking at chat, Bobby Blackwolf went and looked it up for you.
875195	879317	The Super Nintendo launch titles were indeed Mario World F-Zero was a launch title.
879638	883500	Pilotwings, SimCity, Gradius 3 was the only other one that was there the day it launched.
884020	885281	Yeah, that was the one you were missing.
886282	887403	So yeah, so here's the thing.
887883	894447	I actually kind of agree that I think the Xbox One lineup and those things you just said, like the Forza, the Crimson Dragon, that not so much Rise.
894587	895848	In fact, very much not so much Rise.
895868	896949	Yeah, Rise is kind of...
897509	906854	but a lot of those other games you're talking about actually I think the Xbox lineup out the gate sounds a little stronger than PlayStation 4 but do I want to pay another $100 for the privilege of playing those games?
907174	909116	Is it that much a must-have title?
909456	911197	Not for me and not the stuff I play.
913220	916941	I still think it's weird seeing... I saw a TV commercial again today.
918562	920102	They had some football on at Chili's.
920403	925104	It was talking about how to watch TV with the Xbox One and how that's a selling feature.
925124	931406	I'm like, I just don't get... I guess if you're really hardcore into fancy football, cool.
931466	936788	But other than that, why the hell would you purchase that system to watch TV on it?
936888	939429	It just doesn't seem like that makes sense.
940726	941687	I will say this now.
942547	946450	Now that it's been a week, and do I regret my decision to not get a PlayStation 4?
950772	957677	It is really taking a lot of willpower to make me not go, isn't there something we could sell to get the money?
957817	962359	Don't we have hidden money somewhere that I could dig up and help pay for the PlayStation 4?
962920	965221	Do I have a rewards card or an unspent gift certificate?
965241	966002	Yeah.
966662	969465	and watching other people on their Twitch streams.
969526	984282	Like, you know, I've been watching... Extifer was streaming some stuff and that was fun and Bobby was streaming some stuff and it was neat to watch and it did kind of make me go, oh, that's right, I could have played like DC Universe Online with all the new textures would have been really cool and flowers really pretty and all that.
985384	1000724	and the Twitch stuff looks great so I there is that whole like I want to be in the cool kids club type of thing going on but I'm doing all right I I'm pretty sure I'm gonna make it till 2014 without breaking down and buying a PlayStation 4 we'll see so
1001885	1002206	All right.
1002987	1003668	So yeah, that's it.
1004809	1006692	No PlayStation 4 for me for now.
1006812	1011479	But I am still going to, of course, be following it as are we all and doing the news and all that.
1011499	1012340	And I'll get one eventually.
1012881	1016867	Just so you know, guys, just to kind of put it in perspective.
1017808	1022612	I did not buy an Xbox 360 at launch either, nor did I buy a PlayStation 3 at launch.
1023012	1024994	I actually bought the Xbox 360 first.
1025054	1027276	I bought that about four months after it launched.
1027556	1029938	They were still really hard to find when I bought it.
1029998	1034462	Like, I had to track Best Buy's site and when they got the new shipments.
1034522	1040427	And I remember I had to get, like, the not fancy 360 and had to buy the extra stuff separately.
1040867	1041267	Like, because they...
1042268	1043609	Excuse me, they were still hard to come by.
1043989	1047071	And my Xbox 360 died within a week of me buying it.
1047291	1048032	That pissed me off.
1048352	1050213	But whatever, it's old news now.
1050934	1052755	PlayStation 3, I didn't buy for like a year.
1052935	1057198	I didn't buy PlayStation 3 until LittleBigPlanet, I think, had been announced or came out or something.
1057678	1058138	Thanks for watching!
1076587	1079129	I just, I don't like Killzone, I really don't like Killzone.
1079830	1088617	And in looking at like, you know, with the next gen games, I guess, you know, like Call of Duty and Battlefield and stuff, I mean, Call of Duty just, first off, Call of Duty I'm not excited about at all.
1089418	1093942	I had actually gotten a copy, I'm like, fuck this, I'm not opening this, I'm selling it.
1094482	1098066	And so I did, but I still have another copy, but yeah.
1098726	1101988	You know, it's just... I haven't even bothered to want to play that.
1102208	1109133	And, you know, it just didn't look that great on... It just doesn't show off the power of that system at all.
1109573	1113155	It's kind of... Okay, this looks like a PlayStation 3 game.
1113175	1114316	I don't know.
1115897	1116217	All right.
1116278	1117499	Well, let's see.
1117559	1118880	What else should I talk about here?
1118900	1122083	I want to get into our gaming weeks, but I should mention BlizzCon real quick.
1122223	1129450	I did talk a little more in depth about this over on Horde House, my other show, which is on Wednesdays with Extover, Shane Alinko, and Grandpa Matt.
1129810	1131351	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1156230	1158671	I had a good time at the event.
1158711	1162153	You definitely feel that buzz in the air, all the excitement for the new products.
1163093	1165594	Obviously, a big Warcraft expansion was announced.
1165614	1168076	We'll get into some of the details a little later on when we get to the news.
1168676	1171677	There was a lot of buzz about that and the many other things that they announced.
1173198	1184682	But, you know, remember guys, BlizzCon costs $175 to go to, and I just, I gotta be honest, I think the way I did it was great, where we went to Disneyland, and I got to go to the party, so I got to do all the networking.
1185022	1189483	Yeah, I didn't get to play the new stuff, but that's okay, I'll play it eventually, it'll come out.
1189723	1193264	I just, $175, hmm, I don't know about that.
1194044	1196345	Alright, let's get into our gaming weeks.
1196405	1201066	What types of video games have we been playing this week on the consoles we do own?
1201187	1202627	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1202907	1204547	I'm actually defending RawSteelUT.
1204567	1205147	Give me a second.
1206208	1209308	Oh, chat stuff going on right now at live.vognetwork.com?
1209348	1211629	Yeah, if he wants attention, then don't give attention.
1211769	1213809	Let me... Go ahead.
1214269	1216209	No, my point is that he left the room.
1216229	1217310	He's not there to defend himself.
1217610	1219170	I don't see any point in talking about him behind his back.
1219510	1219790	The end.
1221490	1223111	Let's get into our gaming week.
1223151	1224231	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1226671	1228011	My gaming weeks were... I...
1232552	1235797	I actually have twice finished the Stanley Parable.
1235817	1236538	Sorry, I didn't mean to kick you.
1237740	1238581	Then I'll kick you harder.
1239102	1247254	I finished the Stanley Parable, which you play it through once the way you're told to play it, and then you do different things that keep you from actually finishing the game.
1247754	1253141	So it's a very interesting kind of twist on the walkthrough first person adventure.
1255063	1255664	I really like it.
1255704	1256505	It's very well done.
1256565	1261691	I don't know that it was worth the full charge price of it, but it was definitely worth the sale price.
1261811	1262652	It was a very good game.
1263052	1264372	and I haven't finished exploring it.
1264472	1265273	It's pretty neat.
1267713	1269353	I hear the game has a funny sense of humor.
1269533	1269793	It does.
1269853	1271394	It has a really funny sense of humor.
1271414	1273374	Compared to GLaDOS from Portal a lot.
1273394	1279376	Yeah, the narrator is just Mr. Snark as long as you don't do what Mr. Narrator says.
1280076	1282176	So you can rebel against the narrator.
1282516	1285457	It's encouraged that you do so from time to time.
1286677	1311331	Um I also have been playing um Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 because I have uh I'm actually trying once again to get textures imported on my Mass Effect 3 um by doing mods myself from scratch using textures and meshes that other people have made and I've got meshes working just fine not textures and I do not want to use text mod because that means it would be a pain in the ass.
1312191	1320960	So, moving on from that, I also played Final Fantasy XIV, and I'm taking my sweet time with it, but I finally got Thaumaturge leveled up.
1321781	1329568	Once someone reminded me that I could actually pick some of my Arcanist abilities and use them with my Thaumaturge, the class became less shitty.
1331010	1332351	I'm sorry, physic is like...
1334060	1339284	Like, thaumaturges are like, squish, squish, squish, squish, no mana, squish, squish.
1340104	1341625	And then I was like, oh yeah, physic.
1342586	1344427	Being able to heal yourself is a great little perk.
1344787	1350351	But now I'm back to Arcanist, and I'm going to work up to 34 and then do that stupid quest again.
1351071	1354754	That one that I'm trying to finish, so I'm just wandering around doing fates right now anyway.
1354854	1359377	So, kind of boring, but... Excited about the content patch coming in December?
1359778	1363400	Yeah, I did enjoy the lightning thing.
1363520	1377387	I got the quest and I actually hung out where basically you just find where all the people are camping and that's where lightning is going to show up eventually in one of the little random fates that pop up in that area.
1377747	1382849	So I actually got the lightning thing, her showing there and being all kind of broody to herself.
1383630	1384650	Is this my fate?
1385991	1387452	I'm lightning angst.
1388132	1391136	I just liked how all the fonts turned to Final Fantasy XIII and the music.
1391176	1392057	I liked that too.
1392878	1398545	I gotta be honest, I sat there waiting for the fate to pop and I was like, this is so boring, I didn't even see it through.
1398745	1401148	I was like, fuck this, I'll do it later.
1401168	1405053	Well, I was a little bit late because I was trying to get a good view to Screencapper.
1405693	1412039	You know, because they turned it off, your regular screencaps, but I use Steam for it.
1412319	1416403	So I was going to turn off all my stuff in Screencapper, but I didn't get it done.
1416543	1422208	I did like, though, that you can get some of the outfits and armor, and that's what I'm kind of working on right now because I like pretty stuff.
1424510	1425771	I've been playing Animal Crossing.
1425871	1432797	I am going to be probably playing Animal Crossing because I have one loan left for my second character.
1433840	1439704	and then there's Julian's but I'm using his as bribery so that he actually behaves and he's a good boy but he doesn't listen.
1439864	1441485	Another one of your animals moved to my village.
1442066	1442366	Really?
1442706	1443526	Agnes, I think it was.
1443747	1444547	Oh, the pig?
1444647	1444967	Yeah.
1445448	1447809	I know Portia just moved too so I don't know who she moved to.
1447829	1449030	I don't think she came to mine.
1449070	1449631	I got Agnes.
1449671	1455875	I got Mitzi, finally, who was the white cat with the blue face that was on the cover of the first game.
1456395	1457096	I have Mitzi now.
1457276	1457596	Oh, nice.
1458396	1461599	And I like her better than Ed and I want Ed to leave because he's fucking creepy.
1461859	1463080	It's like they're real people.
1465081	1488919	I was actually, because I started listening to the Night Vale podcast, which is fun But I was thinking about doing like an Animal Crossing parody with Night Vale type stuff It's called Welcome to Normandy or something You know, a particular person at VOG has openly voiced the fact that they would love to have some type of fiction-based podcast thing here It would be a lot of fun
1489159	1493683	Well, you know, I've been working on stories already, so... There you go.
1493723	1494283	Make it happen.
1494964	1495424	Make it work.
1495584	1500028	I actually have a very extreme story I'm already working on for a webcomic, but it would tie in very nicely with the podcast.
1501048	1501429	Talk to me.
1501529	1502129	Talk to me, person.
1502349	1502970	All right.
1503751	1503871	And...
1505972	1535204	I uh crap I played other shit but I don't remember what the fuck it was uh and um it's kind of hard though I've noticed to play um MMOs when you have a very needy cat Midna has now taken to climbing up my side and patting me on the shoulder when she wants me to play with her not just you know the climbing up part but she pats me on the shoulder and waits till I look at her and then she goes meh and then she hops up in my lap and tries to eat my mouse so
1535424	1542587	Whatever Not an actual mouse, like your computer mouse My... Cat and mouse You know what's stupid about my mouse, by the way?
1542667	1542848	What?
1543048	1547510	Because Microsoft doesn't make that thumb trackball anymore People on Amazon sell them for 200 bucks Oh, really?
1547550	1550251	And I own two of them They don't make thumb trackballs anymore?
1550431	1562517	Not the wired Microsoft thumb trackball Oh, like different brands and stuff Logitech makes one like it But people are actually spending the 200 bucks And it makes me think maybe I should sell one of mine Gotcha But then again, I wouldn't be able to get another
1564066	1565267	Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1565827	1567148	Uh, I played a lot of Grand Theft Auto.
1568009	1568509	Of course you did.
1568569	1569050	Of course I did.
1569530	1574713	So, I played more of online, I think I'm like level 28 now on PS3.
1574814	1580177	I didn't play any online on 360, but I did 100% 360, so I'm all done with that.
1580577	1584400	And actually, I'm kind of, I was trying to black out everything on 360 as far as the
1586761	1614968	100% checklists because there's more stuff you can do than actually you get 100% for which doesn't make any sense but that's the way they have it so I uh what did I do I did all the um Epsilon tracks the other day and I don't know I'm just messing around um I'll probably play more online because they're gonna have a content patch coming out um this week and
1618746	1623190	Then I played Cookie Clicker, but I started that last night, so it's only been a few hours.
1623230	1625972	I can hear you over there clicking while you're talking, by the way.
1626232	1626632	Of course.
1626873	1627573	Oh my gosh.
1627813	1628814	You've got an intervention.
1629935	1631156	It'll be over soon, don't worry.
1633078	1633738	There is an end.
1634459	1634819	All right.
1635960	1637181	How many cookies do you have right now?
1639343	1643166	Well, I'm producing just under 30 million per second.
1643186	1646128	That's not enough.
1646551	1647371	All right, anything else?
1650993	1651333	That's it.
1651834	1652834	All right, My Gaming Week.
1652874	1654095	Oh, real quick, actually.
1654595	1658077	A little bit of Forza Horizon, but I wasn't actually playing it.
1658097	1659017	My son was playing it.
1659597	1662619	I saw the stuff on Facebook with the pictures and everything.
1662639	1666380	Yeah, he likes playing with my Microsoft racing wheel.
1666941	1670923	He likes pretending it's a steering wheel and goes and plays around with that.
1670943	1671443	So I'm like, hey...
1672463	1675405	What about the... Then he wants to sit in my car and stuff.
1675505	1677025	And so I tell him how the car works.
1677946	1680107	And I'm like, yeah, you push the pedals to go and stuff.
1680127	1684028	I'm like, I'll tell you what, it can set up a game for you and you can go drive a car in that.
1684529	1689771	And so he had trouble at first because I had the force feedback on and stuff.
1689851	1693232	It's hell hard to drive that stupid steering wheel with the force feedback on.
1693272	1694413	So I turned it all off and...
1695194	1707873	Um, then I finally, I switched him into a Honda Fit, because, uh, the car I picked for him, because it was a Class C car, um, just was all over the road, but for some reason the Fit doesn't, yeah, it's more stable, I guess, or something.
1708414	1709456	And so he, um...
1710560	1715464	DarkTetsuya saw the video and said, that was a great video, Loki.
1715484	1721188	Siao wants to know, Siao, sorry, I always mispronounce your name, says, what's the subscription fee for the Final Fantasy MMO?
1721908	1724710	I believe it's $12.95 a month for the basic, which gives you one character or server, but
1739361	1747531	I only had one plan and that was the $14.99 plan.
1748552	1750474	Go take a look because I think there's a $12.95 plan.
1751155	1755159	I didn't see any of it but I don't care because I wanted all the stuff and whatever.
1755860	1757422	It's what I was paying for WoW anyway so it's fine.
1758403	1759164	It's not that big a difference.
1759744	1760545	All right, anything else, Loki?
1760965	1761525	Or do I get to go?
1761826	1762086	That's it.
1762186	1762426	All right.
1763427	1764047	My game of the week.
1764147	1767990	Honestly, not a whole lot of different stuff because I was out of town for a few days.
1768330	1771432	But, you know, the typical Final Fantasy XIV, you know, I'm addicted to that.
1771913	1773994	And also played some World of Warcraft.
1774014	1781739	I think the whole BlizzCon thing might have energized me a little bit to at least log in and check on my character and go, yep, still got no friends left playing this game.
1781759	1782180	That's too bad.
1783740	1785721	But I did play some actual new stuff.
1786461	1792143	I did play a little more of the Midway Arcade because I was trophy hunting in that game and I talked about that a couple weeks ago on the show.
1792683	1796104	But another game I played on PlayStation 3, you ready for this?
1796444	1802246	While all you guys were busy with your newfangled PlayStation 4s playing one of the big launch titles, Assassin's Creed 4...
1803286	1813312	I played Assassin's Creed 3 on PlayStation 3 which by the way is my first Assassin's Creed game I've ever played to which everybody is telling me you're doing it wrong!
1813877	1814657	I want two.
1814797	1815917	I actually have two for PC.
1816177	1816438	Do you?
1816738	1819018	But I hated playing it without a controller.
1821539	1823359	I've been playing Assassin's Creed 3.
1823459	1824479	I like it well enough.
1825679	1830080	I've only gotten through that first little chapter thing where you're in the opera house and then the boat and everything.
1830520	1834861	I like the way that it was telling a story and I thought the environments were really kind of neat.
1835021	1836362	I really like that opera house.
1836382	1839402	It was really pretty to be scaling all around and jumping all around.
1839762	1841643	So I was kind of having fun with that.
1842183	1843283	But did you fight Ultros?
1844223	1851367	No, I did not fight Ultros, but I did have to walk in the rafters and all that stuff.
1852688	1854549	The way the sequence was done was really neat.
1854589	1859731	You would hop over to this stage piece that would fall because of your weight, but not all the way onto the stage.
1859811	1862813	I don't know, I was having fun with it.
1864214	1866495	I want to play a little more of it, so I probably will.
1866635	1870617	I didn't get to play a lot this week, but I played enough to get through that first chapter.
1870757	1872138	It was exciting enough.
1873198	1877941	Considering it was a series, I've had a lot of people tell me, Rob, you should play Assassin's Creed.
1878202	1879703	Why don't you talk about Assassin's Creed on your show?
1879723	1880503	Why aren't you playing this game?
1880523	1882344	I tried Assassin's Creed 1.
1882585	1885887	Nah, it was just kind of not for me.
1886730	1894252	I just wanted to play too, simply because it was Renaissance Italy, and you get to kill Dometicis, and that's always fun.
1894772	1898472	Because when they weren't busy being Pope or killing each other off, they're a very interesting family.
1899673	1905774	And yeah, all those same people telling me to play Assassin's Creed, I'm sure when they hear I started with a third game, are going to be like, what are you doing?
1906474	1907414	Don't do that one!
1907754	1910275	But too late, and I'm enjoying it well enough, so...
1910700	1911240	Thanks for watching!
1928149	1933791	Well, but could that be because of the spread where some people are waiting for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and all that?
1933951	1948997	Yeah, it's funny because actually for work, I was doing some comparisons between launch... Basically from that Tuesday to the Saturday launch week versus their previous iterations and stuff.
1949177	1949257	And...
1951238	1953881	Just a little bit of a spoiler here.
1953921	1957124	Call of Duty Ghosts did not sell through 1 billion copies.
1957385	1959807	They sold into retail 1 billion copies.
1959927	1967415	They sold through maybe about $177 million worth of that, not $1 billion.
1968336	1971899	Assassin's Creed 4, I don't remember what it was, but it was less than half.
1973781	1995484	of Assassin's Creed 3 Assassin's Creed 3 sold really well but that's my idea with that is because they changed up the locale and it was a little bit of a different type of game so it was a lot more interesting whereas 4 is very similar to Assassin's Creed 3 except now it's pirates and there's more of the ship stuff in there but I don't know and then no one cares about Call of Duty for some reason this year
1996945	2001767	Looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Tim Tripp says, I'm loving Assassin's Creed 4.
2002328	2003609	Sexy pirate adventure time.
2004249	2009052	Assassin's Creed 3, the part I played, didn't have pirates, but it had a little bit of the boat.
2009972	2016436	I don't know if you've been marking yourself for download for all those free Xbox games, right?
2016596	2017577	No, I don't think I have.
2017637	2019458	They had Assassin's Creed 2 on there.
2019498	2019978	Oh, did they?
2020139	2020799	Yeah.
2020859	2021139	Whoops.
2021659	2021960	Stupid me.
2022700	2025002	All right, let's see other comments on Assassin's Creed.
2025642	2028725	DKB says, I couldn't get through the first one, but the rest were great.
2029825	2030386	Let's see.
2031206	2035549	Burr says the Assassin's Creed 2 trilogy is good, or you could go right into Assassin's Creed 4.
2038051	2038832	And let's see.
2039052	2043735	They did just put out the Ezio trilogy on, well, they had it out on PS3, and now it's out on 360 as well.
2045056	2063596	Gene in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says maybe the second one it's cheap, easily sets up how to play so there you go some comments and suggestions from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com that's pretty much it for my gaming week I have some other PlayStation Network things to get into but I didn't play them enough so I'll get into them a little later on next week
2064116	2065456	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2084122	2084703	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2101560	2110763	because I have some other newer stuff like I did some streaming of Typing of the Dead that old Slenderman video from a few months ago that's all there but you can check out my Let's Remember series with Jumpman Jr.
2111063	2111743	First video is up.
2112063	2128989	I started to do a second video tonight but I couldn't use it because get this I was trying to do, I don't want to say the game because I'll probably end up doing it later but it was an Atari 2600 game, I'll say that much and when I was recording because the old Atari 2600 games when there was too much on the screen would have the flicker
2129429	2130750	I'll see you next time.
2155206	2168096	both mainstream stuff and neglected stuff I'm kind of starting with a bunch of games that don't get talked enough about but I have like a shit ton of Commodore 64 stuff I want to play and even older stuff Atari 2600 and so on so alright
2170057	2170777	Thank you for watching!
2188647	2217855	you can also listen to this program not just via iTunes and the App Store and all that but we are also available on streaming sites such as TuneIn and Stitcher Radio and that's an opportunity for me to say that Stitcher Radio does have reviews now and those really help with exposure they do have a direct impact on that so please if you enjoy the show consider leaving us a nice little review on Stitcher we really really appreciate it alright let's get into some gaming news now it's been a very busy week with the launch of a system and everything right Loki?
2218675	2239774	Yeah so you know as with any console launching there's sometimes hiccups with things one of which is people encountering the blinking blue light which is a error indicator can mean a bunch of different things including you know an issue with you know TV compatibility an issue with the
2240014	2242957	Power Supply, The Hard Drive, or something else!
2259792	2277500	Of course, one of the things I know that people are mentioning is sometimes there's an issue where the HDMI port that they have on there, that part of the metal shielding on there is popped up and you have to push it down because your HDMI cable might not go all the way into the port and make a bad connection.
2278320	2281862	Then that causes that wonderful light to pop up as well.
2282603	2289473	or your hard drive might not be seated properly and you need to go pop that out and maybe put it back in and see if that works.
2290875	2292918	So they have a lot of stuff.
2292978	2296584	Obviously through Sony's support site you can check it out and
2298160	2301681	If you have a problem or just fucking complain and say, hey, my shit's not working.
2301721	2302622	I just bought the system.
2302642	2303182	What the fuck?
2304042	2308143	And they'll send you a coffin to send your system back and fix it.
2308324	2313465	But don't do what everybody else does, which is just write an angry post on the internet because that's not really going to fix anything.
2314626	2314766	No.
2316847	2317728	So what do you think?
2317888	2318288	I don't know.
2318688	2321230	Is it doom and gloom for Sony?
2321290	2327434	No, because they were saying that it's a lot of these issues so far that they've charted as far as people calling in.
2327515	2328315	It's only been about...
2331587	2333448	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2349316	2355264	Yeah, obviously those people are very vocal, so it's making it sound like a larger issue.
2355825	2367459	But until it becomes a larger issue, like the Xbox 360 launch, that's actually well within usual hardware tolerances.
2367579	2367679	Yeah.
2369598	2378061	Here's the thing though, just to play devil's advocate a little bit, didn't the 360 and Microsoft and all that grossly understate the amount of 360 consoles that were having problems?
2378422	2389506	Because I think they said what, like, I don't know, the number was really low, and then at one point they said it was 30%, like they went as high as they did, but just the people I know, it's more like...
2391526	2393747	75% of those things had problems for real.
2393807	2403529	Considering how many consoles I went through on the Xbox 360 and how my PlayStation systems 1, 2, and 3, not a problem at all.
2403789	2404869	In fact, it's funny.
2404929	2413090	I actually took apart my PlayStation 3 a couple weeks ago when I thought, oh, it's pretty hot.
2413330	2415671	I'm sure there's a ton of fucking cat hair in there.
2416371	2417832	Surprisingly, there's no cat hair in there.
2417852	2419213	I was like, how the fuck did that happen?
2419393	2420834	My computer's, like, full of cat hair.
2421314	2423435	But that system, for some reason, nothing.
2423976	2425056	I don't know what they did to it.
2425116	2427178	It's a magic cat hair repellent or something.
2427758	2432661	But, yeah, I've never had a problem with any of the Sony systems.
2432841	2437744	Like, Microsoft would be the one I'd be very wary about because, like I said, I went through about 12 systems with them, so...
2439082	2442726	Yeah, I'm a little bit more skeptical with Microsoft hardware.
2443607	2450293	But, you know, it's not to say that it's not possible that there is a widespread thing.
2450373	2456519	But so far, it doesn't seem to be that, you know, with the Xbox 360 launch, you know, everybody was being affected by it.
2456539	2460323	It's like you knew someone that had, you know, something go wrong with their system.
2460423	2462285	And it's very obvious.
2462826	2462966	But...
2463226	2463526	We'll see.
2466127	2468268	They just went through and sold a ton of systems.
2468308	2471090	We'll see if we start hearing more about this.
2471510	2473171	If it's going to be a widespread thing.
2473291	2475632	But I don't think it is at the moment.
2476052	2477493	Yet another reason I avoid lunch.
2479045	2479906	ShadowNextGen says,
2497240	2500264	I have a launch 20 gig PS3 and it works just fine.
2500724	2503628	I'm just hoping that doesn't crap out someday because that would suck.
2503888	2507052	I've never had a problem with any of my systems except the 360.
2508213	2511537	My PlayStation 1 and Japanese PlayStation 2 and American one were fine.
2511577	2511817	Well, like,
2511937	2514399	My JPS2 is a launch one, too.
2514719	2516821	And it's been working just fine, perfectly.
2517622	2519824	And my PS3 was a launch PS3.
2520264	2521905	And it's zero problems.
2521945	2523887	You know how apt those were to having issues.
2524447	2528531	But we did... One of our Xboxes red-ringed.
2529151	2532214	But we haven't had the problem since, and they were still making them under those same specs.
2532474	2532614	So...
2535256	2562506	I think they've learned their lesson a lot especially with the red ring thing was the whole overheating of those chips and technology has gotten so much better in the years now that they're not using 90 nanometer chips anymore they're using 20, 30 nanometer chips that are way cooler way more energy efficient so running into heating problems nowadays isn't as much of an issue anymore because technology has improved so much in the years so
2563806	2582021	I think, unless of course you're shoving your system into a closed-look area, like the red light of Doom was one of the ones that people were saying on the PlayStation 4, that's from it overheating, but I just don't think right now we haven't heard enough to where I think it's widespread yet.
2582702	2583002	We'll see.
2583042	2586625	I mean, if we hear that there's a ton of people being affected by it, or if it's something that...
2588088	2594348	It's fine now, but two weeks down the road, all of a sudden everyone's systems start dying, then that's something different.
2596047	2600011	Alright, well, moving on to more talk about PlayStation 4.
2600391	2612142	You know, when they released that giant FAQ on Sony's site a few weeks ago, some people were very upset to hear that there was not going to be any type of playback in the games, and that the PlayStation 4, for some weird reason, won't even play CDs.
2612642	2616686	I guess CDs are a dying thing, which is ironic because this is Sony.
2616746	2619088	Like, didn't Sony start the CD player stuff?
2619228	2619448	Like...
2620069	2620729	Thank you for watching!
2635716	2636396	Thank you for watching!
2658364	2659544	Except that's the way I saw it.
2660705	2663006	It's interesting that he fires that direct shot.
2663106	2665087	There's a lot of people saying that, Loki.
2665207	2667269	Okay, this is cool.
2667549	2672171	I'm just saying, believe him or not, but he did come out and say we did not do it because of this.
2672432	2673532	Let me finish the quote.
2673852	2676114	The focus has been more on the game features.
2676454	2679336	Some of the features we wanted but couldn't get in on day one.
2679556	2679736	Go ahead.
2680376	2683560	Okay, then I would like to explain to him why he did put it out.
2683580	2689888	I mean, if they said, hey, listen, you guys could have had, you know, CDMP3 playback, but then we wouldn't have had, like, game streaming or something like that.
2689988	2690369	I don't know.
2690409	2696537	I just, it just sounds odd that, you know, that they would just omit this stuff.
2697768	2701509	Yet, yet, hey, that Music Unlimited service works just fine.
2702410	2704030	It's just a little odd.
2704230	2705271	Is it working, though?
2705491	2711513	Have any of the PlayStation 4 adopters signed up for Music Unlimited just because they had to hear their Lady Gaga while they're playing?
2711533	2714874	Hey, they've got a free trial in there with all the launch systems.
2714914	2715354	Interesting.
2716154	2728199	One of the things I did like, just looking, kind of reminding me based off that picture there, is one of the things that I don't even know if they've really been talking about, but those controllers have a headphone out on them for game audio.
2728619	2731460	Like, actual game audio from, you know, your TV.
2731540	2741104	So, like, if, like, before, you know, about a month ago or so, I didn't have a wireless headset for my PlayStation 3, and I just had headphones.
2741504	2743385	And that would work fantastic.
2743405	2743805	Yeah.
2744065	2744566	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2768067	2776836	They were crunching to get this out on time, and so they just focus on game-related features now, and then they're going to add that all in, you know, quarter one next year or something.
2776856	2778757	Okay, you know, I'm fine with that.
2779458	2786284	Yeah, he did go on to say, as we speak, the people in Japan, the system guys, are discussing when we can put these features in.
2786625	2790989	Okay, well, it sounds like that's what it is, but, you know, it is a little...
2792538	2820745	you know perplexing that oh hey music unlimited works but you know we just couldn't possibly squeeze out you know the one man you know one programmer that's gonna take to implement mp3 playback on I mean come on how fucking hard is it gonna be to implement mp3 playback on a goddamn ps4 I don't think it's gonna be that hard to write an mp3 playback app it just doesn't seem like it would be that difficult I don't know
2821605	2825166	Alright, by the way, some folks in chat and discussing the origins of the CD.
2825766	2829287	Actdeft says Philips did the CD, but Sony jumped on the CD quickly too.
2829787	2832067	Ranma says it was a joint venture between Philips and Sony.
2832087	2834308	I do remember that Philips was heavily involved.
2834568	2838508	And Philips had, what, the CDI back in the day, so he got into gaming at one point.
2838969	2843669	You remember that Sony worked on the Super Nintendo's processor and I believe was supposed to make a CD unit.
2843729	2846270	Yeah, Sony was... And then, like, no, let's do our own thing.
2847389	2860134	I think it was Nintendo didn't want to do it something to that effect but at any rate Sony took what they had from having worked with Nintendo and jumped on their own little bit of the wagon gaming history y'all
2860996	2870502	Alright, well, so you'll get to have your, or as SGO100 Matt in chat says, if I can't listen to Kesha while I'm gaming, then that's a deal breaker.
2870862	2875985	Well, you'll get your We Are Who We Are or whatever songs it is she does.
2876025	2881188	You'll get to play those songs in Need for Speed or whatever soon enough.
2881288	2881508	What?
2881589	2881869	Help.
2882249	2882449	What?
2882469	2883410	Because I like Kesha.
2885371	2887032	I blame you for showing me that video.
2887612	2891456	Oh, now, the video she did with James Van Der Beek, that was great.
2891776	2895420	You know, I checked out the director's other videos, and they are equally as brilliant.
2895500	2895740	Oh, yeah?
2896040	2896361	Oh, yeah.
2896561	2897041	Good times.
2897582	2898202	But I blame you.
2900585	2906791	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, hate.
2907211	2907972	Let's move on.
2908653	2909914	DarkSakura, you're next, actually.
2910336	2912199	Well, how about some wank?
2912820	2914443	Wank, wank, and more wank.
2915484	2916245	Goddamn you Blizzard.
2916265	2917047	During the show?
2917107	2917628	It's gross.
2917648	2918309	Goddamn you Blizzard.
2918930	2920172	Blizzard's a bunch of fuckers.
2920712	2920993	Why?
2921293	2923577	Because they put out an expansion I'm actually interested in.
2925140	2952297	Warlords of Draenor Blah blah blah Level 90 Blah blah blah I mean actually level 100 But they're doing an instant level 90 now With the expansion which I think is stupid But I'll talk about that in a minute So basically you get to go into the past And learn more stuff about the space goats And explore the land of the space goats And hang out with the space goats And hopefully play more space goats Because that was my favorite race
2953658	2957099	I'm glad to hear the Draenei aren't getting fucked over in this expansion.
2957540	2960581	Because in the last couple expansions, they've just been absent.
2960621	2962702	Straight up, not a part of it.
2963022	2963982	Fuck your pandas.
2965003	2966023	Fuck all these other people.
2966843	2969004	We're going to go here and be Russian.
2969825	2970725	Or at least sound Russian.
2972088	2973068	Yes, yes.
2973128	2973228	I do.
2992893	2995597	Yep, and I had so much fun with it.
2995737	3000023	I played through all of Cataclysm without any help, practically, except for just being in the guild.
3000464	3001946	I didn't do dungeons, I didn't craft.
3002947	3008294	I didn't discover crafting until I had already started raiding, I think, so it was kind of funny.
3009956	3027206	but yeah, they're boosting level cap to 100 and you can instantly upgrade one character to level 90 so that you can start playing the new content which I would like to see if there are other restrictions on this just because, keep in mind
3028246	3041272	People, part of the reason that you level is to not just gain the experience and the abilities of your character in game, but so that you learn the mechanics of your character in game.
3041872	3046494	And by learning those mechanics, it makes you an overall better-rounded player.
3046914	3052756	You know how you fit in when, you know, if you, should you decide to do instances, which some are fun, some are not.
3052776	3053757	You know, but...
3054537	3059200	And people will give you unwanted tips on how to play your class even when you don't give a shit.
3060081	3061521	Which, assholes.
3062522	3065264	We were talking a little bit about this on Horde House just at that point.
3065344	3069927	There's supposed to be some type of scenarios or something that help you learn.
3070127	3077091	Like if you're a brand new level one that boosts to 90, you get some type of scenario that helps you understand your class or something.
3077111	3079072	That's still, I don't think, going to be good enough.
3080053	3081894	It's an interesting band-aid.
3082394	3083275	You know, like even...
3084295	3089136	I always kind of approach that because I don't play World of Warcraft and I don't know too much about it.
3089396	3091837	And this announcement, just nothing.
3092197	3092797	I feel nothing.
3093037	3095897	Nothing jumped out saying, hey, that looks really cool.
3096157	3098218	I just kind of, eh, whatever.
3098358	3101778	They didn't really do anything to attract new players, to be honest.
3101798	3103459	Which kind of sounds like a mistake to me, if you ask.
3103479	3104419	I think it is a mistake.
3104799	3105519	Anyway, sorry, Jamie.
3105559	3109420	And this is the crappy thing because I really want to play it for the lore.
3110817	3113625	I really want to see what the new stuff is.
3114166	3118117	It's very interesting to me, but I just completely dropped it.
3120185	3146832	World of Warcraft for Final Fantasy and I'm really enjoying Final Fantasy I enjoy not having to rep grind I don't care about doing all the Titan crap or what's the other stuff that you guys have been doing the primal fights I can get those later I haven't had this wild urge to massively level I've been able to sit back and enjoy the game and that's kind of what I dug about playing through Cataclysm the first time but then when I got to all the Panda shit I was like
3147612	3148513	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3169426	3179175	There's supposed to be improvements like a re-skinned character models and new animation, but I hope that they never change the Night Elf dance because that shit's funny.
3181838	3182138	So that's it.
3182158	3183259	You can watch the trailer online.
3183319	3183819	It's pretty.
3186382	3188444	Part of me just does not want to give a shit.
3188804	3190446	The other part of me is like, ooh, goat.
3192659	3195101	You know, I'm not super into World of Warcraft lore.
3195121	3197643	I never have been, which is funny, you know, with the podcast and everything.
3197683	3199945	But I was always more about the social aspect.
3200365	3202327	And the garrison sounds really neat.
3202887	3205770	The whole player cities or whatever sound really neat.
3205790	3215718	Well, it almost sounds like they're trying to give a nod back to the original Warcraft games because you pretty much had your own towns and your defensible areas, you know, when you did places.
3215818	3216358	That's a good point.
3218160	3220402	The other thing that's just really...
3221747	3251436	I'm wondering the updates I think as far as characters and animation are necessary they are long overdue and I realize they've been trying to cater to people on older systems that might not be able to keep up with it but at the same time I think that keeping like a window of about maybe five years worth of computer what's the word I'm trying to think of being friendly to older systems is a safe bet rather than how long has the game been out now like what
3251736	3252677	Oh, nine years almost?
3252717	3253678	Yeah, nine years.
3254559	3257882	And they were still catering to people from computers.
3258242	3265148	I mean, I was playing whatever you had installed on your MacBook.
3265168	3266109	Wrath of the Lich King, I think.
3266169	3268331	Yeah, I was playing that stuff on your MacBook.
3269132	3271033	And it was still just fine.
3271934	3272435	So, I mean...
3274335	3274796	I don't know.
3274916	3279337	I really, really, really, really want to see the new stuff.
3280157	3282398	It's just, I don't know if it's so worth it to me.
3282498	3286319	I've been, well, you know, I read all the books that came out during Cataclysm.
3286959	3287959	I got all of those books.
3288039	3289420	I love the freaking Thrall book.
3289440	3292081	I didn't read the Jaina book, though, because I'm just pissed off about what they did to her.
3292801	3297242	I mean, I hate how her character has become, she used to be like one of my favorites, even though I made fun of her.
3298102	3299863	Because I do have a character named Vagina.
3302608	3303608	who I made look like her.
3304509	3310772	But other than that, I can get the lore stuff from my friends or I can get it on YouTube.
3311072	3315194	I watched the whole ending of the Garrosh bullshit on YouTube.
3315994	3317154	Yeah, oh, there's two versions, right?
3317174	3319295	I've watched both of them.
3319796	3322457	I'm mildly surprised, but not majorly.
3322517	3324097	I was just like, Jaina, shut up.
3325218	3326298	Your trauma's showing.
3327799	3329820	Granted, it's well-earned trauma, but still.
3330720	3341003	I don't want to repeat myself too much from Wednesday's Horde House, but some of my co-hosts really got into how they feel that this is being charged for a patch, that a lot of this stuff should have been taken care of in a patch.
3341983	3352126	But I said that, you know, I'm really looking forward to five mans coming back, thank God, because I've been really pissed off that Pandaria neglected them, and that's probably the reason I'm not playing right now.
3352466	3352787	DarkSakura.com
3367848	3373070	So if you can put a group together, and when I say 11, that's an arbitrary number between 10 and 25.
3373950	3377991	You can now do LFR difficulty with a pre-established group of like 11, 12 people.
3378371	3379672	Everything flexes now.
3379952	3384873	And for the hardcore players, they're getting a new difficulty called Mythic Rating that's all 20-man.
3385013	3385353	That's it.
3385413	3386414	No more 10s and 25s.
3386434	3387154	20-man.
3387394	3388074	You know what, though?
3388114	3389534	That part's cool.
3390035	3391355	I do actually miss the rating.
3391415	3394156	But you know what the big crappy part of it was at the end?
3394296	3394536	Mm-hmm.
3394756	3398957	was that I like to chat with all my friends, you know, in the guild.
3399217	3399437	Right.
3400077	3402638	And it just sort of got to be a ghost town, sort of.
3402658	3404698	I mean, I was fine doing all the stuff by myself.
3405199	3410060	You can easily play through anything in World of Warcraft as a solo game.
3410260	3410480	Right.
3411040	3422463	And actually, that's one advantage it has over Final Fantasy XIV to me, because you have to have other people to do the duty things, like what's the...
3423603	3424263	Like the dungeons.
3424343	3424884	The dungeons, yeah.
3424904	3425724	You have to do those, yeah.
3426564	3448170	I like the better that there are four people and not five, but still, it's... I liked having the option of me being able to do this shit by myself and then going back and doing dungeons alone so that I could see what they were like because, you know, that's how I was farming for... And you can't do that in Final Fantasy XIV because it level sinks you.
3448550	3449070	Exactly.
3449110	3451211	Which is, you know, it's good and bad.
3451824	3453745	So, yeah, pluses and minuses.
3454466	3454806	I don't know.
3454826	3461511	For right now, as much as I really, really want to see the new content, I can't justify it.
3461711	3464934	Well, we don't even know the date anyway, so you have a long time to make up your mind.
3464974	3468236	So if Final Fantasy XIV turns crusty and old, then maybe I'll be back.
3468376	3496928	which it might, and Blizzard's probably banking on that a little bit, so we'll see alright, moving on, Loki alright, so let's talk a little bit about let's go back and talk about gold as I mentioned before there's the Xbox Live games with gold thing that you get some free games, and originally it was, oh hey, we're gonna stop it once the Xbox One comes out, and everyone's like why the fuck aren't you just
3497748	3501369	And now they're like, well, hey, we're going to do it again.
3501389	3504650	We're going to keep it going through 2014.
3504890	3507871	And we're going to include Xbox One games on a monthly basis.
3508811	3514013	Which makes me believe that that's probably going to be digital games.
3514213	3517434	Because I don't see them giving away...
3518734	3520936	Well, I can see them giving away Rise because that game looks like crap.
3521337	3525601	There's no way they're giving away retail games for the first year, or at least six months.
3526902	3528043	Probably a lot of download stuff.
3528243	3529925	So, yeah, it'll be a while.
3529985	3534589	But, hey, still though, it's good to see that that's going to be continuing on.
3535089	3544618	I would not be surprised, though, even if they did retail games, that that doesn't change to be more like the PlayStation Network program where you have to continue being a live member in order to...
3544878	3548080	I mean, because come on, they put everything else behind the fucking paywall.
3548300	3553744	What makes you think that they're all of a sudden going to just continue on with, oh, sure, we're generous to give you free games that you can have forever.
3554464	3556105	No, no, this is Microsoft.
3557006	3559507	If Sony's doing it and people are happy with it, they're going to do it too.
3565959	3572465	I guess, yeah, I'm excited to go in there and see what they're going to give away on 360 and maybe flag some of the games.
3572485	3576528	But at the same time, my account's coming up for renewal soon.
3576568	3581732	I don't know if I'm going to do it because I'm just like, there's really nothing I'm playing online on 360 anymore.
3581772	3591199	I was playing Mass Effect 3 pretty heavily for a while, but now most of the people I play with are on PC and we haven't really done Forza in forever and there's really not a lot to play on 360 right now.
3592120	3595383	Even on PS... To be fair, on PlayStation 3, there's not a lot I play online either.
3595443	3596844	It's all PC or really nothing.
3597124	3597845	But it's all free now.
3598105	3599826	I mean, it's free.
3600066	3600267	True.
3600287	3601868	But yeah, I'm kind of the same.
3602408	3607712	Mine's renewing soon too, but I do play quite a bit on 360, so I'll probably keep mine.
3608533	3609214	Thanks for watching!
3633449	3634370	All right, let's move on.
3634931	3636692	Nintendo put out a bit of news this week.
3636912	3640515	They did another one of their Nintendo Directs, which is how they get the news out these days.
3641156	3645980	Taking their case directly to their fans and cutting out all the skeptics in between.
3647221	3649803	This is the news that came out on their Direct on November 13th.
3650123	3652405	A release date for Mario Party Island Tour in Europe.
3652545	3655287	That will be January, even though we're getting that next week, right?
3655607	3657069	Sorry, Europe, you gotta wait till the new year.
3658170	3663336	The 3DS will be getting YouTube, which is kind of one of those things they announced it and I went, it's not already there.
3663476	3665638	And like, oh yeah, it's really not already there.
3665718	3667781	So finally, YouTube on the 3DS.
3667801	3668942	Grasping the internet.
3669202	3669423	Yeah.
3669983	3673127	Which by the way, let me throw this out there, see what the live chatters think.
3673167	3674689	I was going to keep this a secret, but what the hell.
3675770	3678632	I'm thinking about putting OLR episodes up in full on YouTube.
3678872	3680254	And no, this will not involve video.
3680634	3685138	But just like a static picture while you have... Because now you don't have to break things up into 15 minutes anymore.
3685158	3686039	So you just do three hours.
3686719	3690863	And my big problem right now, I can't get in the Orange Launch Radio account.
3690903	3693065	So I need Jason's help getting me back in there.
3693085	3693946	I don't remember how to get in.
3694186	3696588	They switched YouTube so many times now with the integration.
3696648	3697849	I can't log into the account.
3698189	3700952	So hopefully Jason can figure it out or he might be screwed and have to get a new name.
3701292	3701772	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3719377	3727703	I think it does have a sound player, but I'm not sure if it's MP3s or if it's like MPA, either that iTunes format or whatever it is.
3727723	3729284	No, regardless, you can't do podcasts.
3729304	3729644	We know that.
3729704	3734167	Even though the PSP did, yeah, that website on the PSP that did it, you can't really do it easy.
3734227	3736048	So that is something we're toying with.
3736068	3742653	So that's really cool to hear that YouTube will be on the 3DS so that, you know, for whatever it is on YouTube you want to look at, that'll be possible.
3742673	3748056	And YouTube on the 3DS, I believe that there is a YouTube player for the PlayStation 4 as well.
3748096	3748877	So there you go.
3749757	3751018	Yay, it's all over the place.
3751038	3751439	There you go.
3752139	3752439	All right.
3753660	3754201	Other things.
3755321	3758163	3DS and Wii U, there's going to be a system update for both.
3758524	3760585	And finally, the eShops will be combined.
3760785	3761586	Thank God.
3761646	3762667	It's about time, right?
3763067	3766369	They're going to combine the eShops, not the games, sorry.
3766970	3769172	But the account balances will be one and the same.
3769532	3777818	So the good news is if you have like 23 cents sitting in your wallet on 3DS and like 23 cents on all that leftover change, you'll be able to combine it.
3778038	3778398	Yay!
3779219	3781860	Buy something and not have that leftover change anymore.
3782980	3784101	DLC coming to Pikmin 3.
3785361	3792484	DLC worked out pretty well for Mario Wii U last year with the Super Luigi Brothers, so it'll be interesting to see what comes to the Pikmin 3 DLC.
3793224	3795926	Bravely Default comes to the US on February 7th.
3797266	3816552	Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy comes out in North America on February 28th and there is a new hero mode in Zelda A Link Between Worlds and there's also something about and I'm not finding here Miiverse on 3DS but I know we have a follow up on that in a little bit here so I'll wait for that
3817072	3817753	Super Mario 3D World
3838067	3864690	so she will be available in Super Mario 3D World I missed what the qualifications were to unlock her I want to say that if you had like a save file from the old game you get it right away no no that's um if you have Super Luigi Brothers you get the classic Mario Brothers re-skinned into Luigi Brothers you get that but yeah that's really cool Rosalina's another character there so hooray yeah I'm very excited about Mario 3D World
3865888	3866289	I'm glad.
3866469	3866670	Yeah.
3867531	3868373	Yay, excitement.
3868594	3869075	Huzzah.
3869135	3869576	Huzzah.
3870157	3871680	All right, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
3872378	3879559	Well, speaking of 3DS stuff, Miiverse has got a few restrictions on it that may not please people.
3880599	3883000	It's the Wii U social network that they're doing.
3883600	3891161	It's going to be out on 3DS in December, but they are not going to allow private messages or friend requests.
3891261	3892461	They don't have those features.
3893162	3900943	Basically, I think that's kind of going along with what happened with, not PictoChat, Swapnote.
3901443	3902965	Yeah.
3903767	3911779	To avoid, you know, getting at anything that may not be safe for little kitties and, you know, an easily offendable adult.
3912760	3913602	So, it's...
3916061	3922369	They're still going to be able to use this for consolidating their eShop balances, like you were saying.
3923991	3927335	But they can leave comments about games.
3927996	3930119	There's sort of a bulletin board thing about that.
3930539	3935125	But you're not going to be able to do the actual private message person to person.
3936633	3937114	DarkSakura.com
3948809	3950990	Yeah, but Miiverse is moderated.
3951130	3953691	It'll be on there for five seconds, Rob.
3953731	3954311	That's right.
3954552	3955312	Somebody might see it.
3955372	3956692	Someone will see the penis.
3957813	3958573	They will touch it.
3958633	3959234	They will love it.
3961134	3962195	With their little stylus.
3965276	3965656	Boop it.
3966156	3966757	Boop the penis.
3966777	3966977	Boop.
3970525	3976492	I thought you meant to say bop it, like I'm thinking about those old like, you know, like bop it, twist it, throw it, turn it.
3977072	3982378	I saw one of those at the thrift store the other day and some kid was playing with it and was like, this toy sucks!
3982398	3986623	I was like, that's what we thought when it came out.
3986983	3989864	Didn't they make like Bop It for the Nintendo Wii?
3989984	3990705	Am I crazy?
3990825	3992866	Or wasn't there like actually a Bop It game?
3993326	3994567	No, there wasn't a Bop It game.
3994667	3995547	Are you sure?
3995567	3996468	There was like Jenga.
3997748	4000710	They had a few Jenga games and I was like, what the?
4001150	4002390	You can't play Jenga on a Wii.
4002430	4003431	That's dumb.
4003611	4005352	People can barely play Jenga in real life.
4007290	4007830	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4029146	4030607	And anyway, they're going to flick the penis.
4030647	4037633	If it was like chicks topless and dudes pantsless playing Bop It, that might be the reason to watch the TV show, right?
4038753	4039274	Fair enough.
4041375	4044518	Maybe Cinemax needs to get in on the Bop It TV show.
4046159	4048821	Bop It, twist it, turn it, touch it.
4051383	4052864	I'm sorry, you were talking about... Sorry.
4053424	4054545	I don't like where this show's going.
4054585	4059168	You were talking about pantsless guys and I just started laughing because that is hilarious mental imagery.
4059428	4060369	Equal opportunity.
4060389	4062070	I'm trying to think if you've got to have topless chicks.
4062690	4066773	But I imagine that male dangly bits look a lot more hilarious than boobs bouncing.
4066793	4069095	All right.
4070555	4071396	Moving on.
4071976	4073397	I don't like where this show's going.
4073437	4074538	It's going to a dark place.
4074818	4075739	Let's go to release dates.
4075759	4076619	What, your pants?
4081454	4084278	Loki, save the show and please read the release dates.
4084298	4085559	See, I'll just think of the children.
4086160	4086481	Shut up.
4087302	4087922	Release dates.
4087982	4092949	Well, next week we have the launch of the Xbox One, so that'll be coming out on Friday.
4093489	4098856	Along with that, a bunch of other games, including, and not necessarily all for the Xbox One.
4100298	4118434	Zumba Kids for the Wii and Xbox 360 NBA Live 14 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag coming out on PC and Xbox One Walking Dead Game of the Year Edition the good one from Telltale another crappy Activision one that's on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and
4119815	4142303	uh Need for Speed Rivals on all the other systems other than PlayStation 4 it's on PS3 Xbox 360 Xbox One and PC uh Young Justice Legacy on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and 3DS uh let's see here Zuma Fitness World Party on Xbox One The Amazing Spider-Man on Vita Just Dance 2014 on Xbox One Battlefield 4
4142623	4150768	4 on Xbox One, FIFA 14, Madden 25, also Xbox One, Band Fuse Rock Legends on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4151088	4153970	That's sort of like Rocksmith, but not Rocksmith.
4154230	4161554	Although, hey, that game did have a cameo in, what was it, the movie 43 or whatever that was.
4164735	4165716	Isn't that movie awful?
4165776	4166956	I heard horrible things about that movie.
4166976	4167516	Oh, it wasn't very good.
4167576	4168197	I watched it.
4168437	4169117	It was not funny.
4170778	4172978	Adventure Time Explored Dungeon because I don't know.
4173339	4178420	That's coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, and on the 3DS.
4178901	4180901	Fighter Within on Xbox One.
4183542	4186844	Aquapazza Aqua Plus Dream Match on PlayStation 3.
4188784	4190585	And what else we've got here?
4192369	4195731	I know there's some Nintendo games coming out as well, of course.
4196712	4200554	We've got Mario Party Island Tour on the 3DS.
4201574	4205056	We also have Angry Birds Star Wars on Xbox One.
4205137	4207178	Lego Marvel Super Heroes on Xbox One.
4207258	4207798	GameStick!
4208198	4211380	They're still claiming that they're coming out that week, so maybe that'll be out.
4211921	4212981	Zoo Tycoon on 360.
4213902	4214722	Forza Motorsports 5.
4216423	4217044	Dead Rising 3.
4219284	4239467	Girls Fashion Shoot for the 3DS Rise, Son of Rome The Legend of Zelda A Link Between Worlds on 3DS Tearaway on the Vita Super Mario 3D World on Wii U as well as that wonderful Nintendo 3DS XL Golden Black with The Legend of Zelda A Link Between Worlds
4240327	4241028	That's it.
4242349	4244470	And then it officially dies to nothing.
4244490	4246511	I was going to say, last big week of the year, right?
4246531	4249593	It goes into a coma for the next two months.
4249834	4251094	Is it last big week of the year?
4251174	4255497	Because then, after that, you've got Black Friday, and that's when all the stuff's supposed to be out by.
4256538	4267125	Well, actually, there's the first week in December, you've got Gran Turismo 6, and then it literally, there is nothing... Well, the South Park game was supposed to be there, but that got moved.
4267145	4268526	Yeah, the South Park was supposed to be on the 10th,
4269046	4270907	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4289356	4292259	and Dragon Ball Z, Battle for Z on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4293040	4293520	That's it.
4293580	4297504	That's literally everything between now and January and February.
4297604	4298925	That is like nothing.
4299126	4299926	It's unheard of.
4300046	4302809	This segment will go by quickly in the coming weeks.
4302969	4303550	What's coming out?
4303990	4304371	Nothing.
4304571	4304931	Nothing.
4305432	4305612	All right.
4306533	4306733	Let's see.
4306753	4308715	Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
4308755	4311397	Codeman in our chatroom says, girls fashion shoot.
4311818	4313900	I'm all over that shit because I'm a classy bitch.
4314761	4315562	You and me both, Cody.
4315582	4316043	You and me both.
4316083	4320970	By the way, speaking of classy bitch, I want to thank Alan for bringing me the wine to drink during the show.
4321070	4321851	Can I smell it?
4322051	4322472	Yes, you may.
4322952	4324635	You could have a little taste if you want.
4324655	4327859	I don't know if it's against your... It's very sweet.
4327939	4328821	...what you can and can't eat right now.
4329201	4329461	All right.
4329782	4330042	You know what?
4330062	4331805	I have to try that stuff that Victoria told me about.
4332594	4333315	The Frivolo?
4333395	4350250	Yeah I need some of that in my life Actually, we're looking at going out to the winery in a couple weeks to do that Kidnap me I don't know if Lady Victoria will be here, but she hasn't been on the show in forever She was on like one show in the old studio None of the listeners here probably know her We need to kidnap her
4350390	4350710	We do.
4350730	4351710	Need to make that happen.
4352490	4355111	Victoria would be great on this show because she's a WoW widow.
4355731	4360612	In one of her relationships many years ago, the guy cared about World of Warcraft more than her.
4361332	4364513	And so she's got all these stories about how much she hates the Storming the Castle game.
4364533	4368013	I think it would be a fun... I wanted to get her on Horde House because of that.
4368033	4368713	That would be funny.
4368974	4369614	I digress.
4370054	4371794	Let's talk about Japanese release dates.
4372454	4376655	On the PlayStation 4 this week... Oh, you guys don't get the PlayStation 4 until February 11th.
4376895	4378476	I'm so mean, why did I say that?
4394910	4398452	So I think that plays into it more than we might want to admit here in the US.
4398612	4398973	I don't know.
4399393	4402815	But anyway, that just kind of was a little reminder there as I was looking at the release dates.
4402875	4406517	Oh yeah, Japan didn't have all this craziness that we had here this week with PlayStation 4.
4408619	4411941	However, on the PlayStation 3 still kicking this week in Japan, hey...
4412381	4418366	If you're mad at me about what I said about the PlayStation 4, you can get your revenge this week with Lightning Returns Final Fantasy XIII.
4418787	4419627	I really want that game.
4419908	4421609	I can't play it until, like, February.
4421629	4422550	Are you sure it's going to be revenge?
4422570	4427534	Because, I mean, after the last one, you know, it might be just like... I thought Final Fantasy XIII 2 was good.
4427975	4428755	It was good.
4428775	4429796	I didn't think it was supposed to be that good.
4429816	4430377	Oh, whatever.
4431177	4432899	Final Fantasy XIII Lightning Returns.
4433559	4434320	It'll be interesting.
4434360	4435541	We'll say that much one way or the other.
4435801	4437963	That is out in Japan this week on the PlayStation 3.
4438783	4441305	Hanasaku Mani Mani also comes out.
4441986	4446969	Monster Hunter Frontier G in like a beginner's package is out this week as well in Japan.
4447690	4450052	Need for Speed Rivals makes its way to Japan as well.
4450552	4452874	And Shin Atelier Rorona...
4453354	4468104	Hajimari no Monogatari The Alchemist of Arland comes out this week on PlayStation 3 as well there's also by the way like a special ultimate box for Lightning Returns I guess that's some type of collector's edition I didn't really read up on because I don't plan on importing it
4469265	4481995	On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan, just Lightning Returns on the 360 as well, and Need for Speed Rivals also comes out in Japan this week on the 360.
4483797	4492644	Going over to the PlayStation Vita, the Shin Atelier Arona game I mentioned earlier is also on the PlayStation Vita, and that's really it this week on the Vita.
4493404	4496465	and the Wii U this week gets Super Mario 3D World.
4496805	4501287	Taiko no Tatoujin on the Wii U. Damn the Wii U for not being region free.
4501427	4503447	Damn it, because I would so import that game.
4503467	4504488	I love Taiko no Tatoujin.
4504528	4508369	It's so cute, especially if it still had the inflatable drum, although it probably doesn't.
4508389	4511310	It probably uses the touchpad and the stylus and all that.
4511390	4516251	But oh, no, I guess they're selling a bundle set that has a Taiko with it and a Bachi.
4516271	4518452	I want to see what they don't have a picture of what it looks like.
4520959	4521420	Oh, there it is.
4521460	4523040	There's a tiny, tiny little picture of it.
4523100	4527743	I love the little taiko on the thing.
4527763	4531525	They're so cute and they look like kitty faces.
4532825	4537308	I have a taiko plushie and I wanted to put kitty ears on it just because it looks like cat faces.
4538388	4538948	So cute.
4538968	4540809	That's kind of weird, but okay.
4541029	4549112	On the Nintendo 3DS this week in Japan, this last group of dates I will read, we have a Nintendo 3DS XL in Chopper Pink and Luffy Red.
4549753	4558236	This is just in conjunction with One Piece Unlimited World R from Bandai Namco is out this week and gets those special 3DSs with that.
4558876	4588047	there's also Tongari Bushi to Mahou no Machi and Atsu Futari no My Princess Biohazard Revelations or Resident Evil of course gets a price reduction this week and most importantly on the 3DS if you screw up on all those other games don't worry Mama will fix it and Cooking Mama 5 out this week in Japan I'm glad Mama's going back to her roots after all that gardening shit and whatever what the hell else what else did Mama fix
4589015	4590357	What were all the spin-off games?
4590577	4591097	Remember, Loki?
4591357	4592358	I know there was Gardening Mama.
4592378	4593239	I thought there was one other one.
4593319	4594300	There's Crafting Mama.
4594320	4595081	Crafting Mama.
4595541	4596642	Babysitting Mama.
4597003	4598784	Remember with the creepy one?
4598824	4600045	With that creepy baby.
4600105	4602387	Yeah, they put the Wii remote inside its ass.
4603709	4604489	I remember that.
4605210	4612917	Yeah, there was Crafting Mama, Gardening Mama, Babysitting Mama, and then three or four Cooking Mamas.
4614227	4635556	Alright, there you go By the way, I'm being complimented by AkumaJP in our chatroom I have no problem understanding that, good job Yay, I pronounced at least one of those games correctly 12 years will do a lot Alright, never had a class, believe it or not Let's go around for the UK releases, DarkSakura
4636551	4639533	There were a few things, actually a few things coming out.
4640474	4641435	It's a pretty long list.
4641475	4643256	So I'm just going to start from the 19th.
4644016	4646738	We have on the 19th, NBA Live 14.
4647699	4651842	Then on the 20s, we have Contrast and Soul Calibur 2 HD online.
4652542	4657126	And then on the 21st, there is Battlefield 4, FIFA 14, Madden XL.
4657506	4658307	I'm sorry, XL.
4658467	4660168	I've got the 3DS thing on the head.
4660688	4663630	Madden NFL 25 and Shiva Kosher Edition.
4664031	4664211	Wait.
4665413	4666313	I need to check this out.
4666814	4667054	Anyway.
4669155	4672717	Then on the 22nd, Angry Birds Star Wars, Assassin's Creed 4.
4673757	4677699	These are basically all the new release stuff coming out, the system release stuff.
4678059	4694387	So there's Crimson Dragon, Dead Rising 3, Kinect Sports Rivals Preseason, Need for Speed Rivals, Need for Speed blah blah blah, Tearaway, Legend of Zelda Link Between Worlds, Watch Dogs, Young Justice Legacy, Power Star Golf and Zoo Tycoon.
4696704	4697625	All right, that's it.
4698065	4698345	Yarp.
4698766	4699106	All right.
4699846	4700587	Busy, busy week.
4700647	4702669	That segment's going to slow down in the coming weeks.
4703669	4704130	Double yarp.
4704370	4706471	Have fun with all the games that you're buying.
4706492	4707392	There's a lot to choose from.
4707432	4708653	It's a great time to be a gamer.
4708773	4714157	No matter what system it is you're backing right now or if it's several, lots of great stuff to look forward to.
4714197	4720422	And PC gamers, not leaving you guys out because there's that rumored Steam sale coming right after Thanksgiving, right?
4720442	4725366	There's like a fall sale and then there's an actual Xmas or holiday sale or whatever.
4725586	4725946	What's that?
4726026	4726967	So prepare your wallets.
4726987	4728328	Yeah, prepare your wallets.
4728688	4729609	Winter is coming.
4731350	4732491	Winter sale is coming.
4733812	4737595	All right, let's do a few more news stories and then the classic game of the week, Loki.
4737955	4744660	Okay, so Nintendo has actually purchased some stake in, I guess, this company, Duango.
4745280	4751805	And Duango owns Nico Nico, which is a video delivery service company.
4753248	4760682	and I guess maybe that they're planning on using that to I don't know either deliver games or
4763177	4763577	No idea.
4765138	4771081	But it's interesting to see that they purchased 612,000 shares.
4773543	4773943	Interesting.
4775324	4779106	It's a web service company that provides content through mobile phones.
4780727	4787771	I don't know if that means streaming videos or something, but interesting that they're getting involved with that.
4788031	4789012	Tinfoil hat?
4789392	4789832	Oops, excuse me.
4789872	4790953	Tinfoil hat time.
4791840	4798587	Could this be a clue about... And just buying stock in a company doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna... It's not buying the company.
4798647	4803533	Could this be a clue about where Nintendo wants to go with their next handheld system?
4804994	4810360	Not gonna say that they're gonna make it a phone, because I don't think that's correct, but maybe something about...
4811846	4813287	What if it could get data?
4813508	4814789	Like, let's say it's like an iPad.
4815149	4817211	It does 4G and it does like streaming video.
4817712	4821755	That's the one thing we didn't really see on the 3DS that I thought we would.
4821875	4823577	Like, I know it's got Netflix and that stuff.
4823617	4824918	Well, they have that at first.
4824938	4826900	Remember, they're going to do 3D movies on there.
4826980	4827881	Whatever happened to that?
4828021	4829703	Yeah, they kind of fizzled out, I guess.
4829723	4830723	Were they limited by the story?
4830823	4839571	I remember when they were showing the demos at the very first E3 or whatever, they had, I think they had the trailer for Tangled, was the one thing we saw in 3D, on the 3DSs.
4839591	4843414	They had Tekken, they had the whole Tekken animated movie that was in there.
4843434	4848259	And Tron was like something I was like, fuck yeah, they need to put Tron in 3D out on the 3DS, because that never happened.
4848279	4850901	I don't know, maybe not enough demand for it.
4850981	4858528	Could there be some, a hint there, if this is some type of streaming service, could there be some type of movie thing being built into the next DS?
4858908	4863092	I'm totally tinfoil hatting, but I don't, I mean, it would make sense.
4863152	4867997	I mean, the 3D movie thing sounded cool, but now that they're getting away from 3D, I don't know.
4869724	4872846	Oh, that's true, because maybe 3D isn't going to be such a big deal.
4874387	4875848	WhatUpG even agrees with you there.
4876268	4878170	I think Nintendo's next handheld will be 2D.
4878310	4882613	That comment from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
4883814	4885916	We'll see if anything comes of my tinfoil hatting.
4887016	4888477	This will be happening for sure though.
4888797	4892699	Heroes of the Storm was another game that Blizzard announced at BlizzCon.
4893060	4894000	I'm excited about this.
4894180	4900544	I'm not super into MOBAs, but even though I'm terrible at them, I've tried to play them and they are fun.
4901104	4902125	League of Legends and Dota 2.
4902705	4903866	Heroes of the Storm Beta Sign-Ups
4918743	4935897	so if this is something you're interested in beta testing you don't have to be an active WoW player or anything like that you just have to have a Battle.net account and you can go log into your site and you can update your beta preferences for Heroes of the Storm so that's something I know I did right away but if you guys are interested in this don't forget to update your Battle.net accounts for the same thing
4936437	4937538	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4954980	4962363	DarkSakura, did you see this cinematic trailer they were doing for Heroes of the Storm that had some of these bad guys and good guys in it all kind of coming together?
4962403	4965485	It was pretty neat to see everybody in that one video.
4965805	4969246	But I noticed, the first thing I said is I said, where are the Lost Vikings?
4969987	4970567	Exactly.
4970587	4971848	They're still hanging out in that cave.
4973241	4975462	I looked at this trailer and I said, where are the Lost Vikings?
4975502	4977063	It's like an old school Blizzard property.
4977083	4978184	A lot of people remember, right?
4978484	4979965	Well, apparently I'm not the only one.
4980545	4984387	And it came out this week during BlizzCon.
4984928	4989070	While Dustin Browder, who's a Blizzard game designer, was being interviewed with GameSpot.
4989090	4991991	He said, quote, there's a good chance for Lost Vikings.
4992292	4994553	That's one of the characters we've been really interested in doing.
4994893	4995373	Thanks for watching!
5016366	5018028	So don't count the Lost Vikings out.
5018949	5022613	Another one not to count out is that, what's that Super Nintendo game, Blackthorn?
5022774	5024215	Whatever's the one they did on Super Nintendo?
5024516	5027019	They released that for free on Battle.net.
5027039	5030062	You just go download it totally for free and have a blast with that.
5030503	5033907	I have a feeling they could be putting him in Heroes of the Storm 2.
5034367	5034667	Why not?
5035308	5051902	sure why not diversify things a little bit more than just World of Warcraft and all that for the record I do absolutely love that the three that the Lost Vikings are in World of Warcraft you can just go hang out with them if you're Alliance and you can kill the shit out of them if you're Horde that part's pretty cool
5053072	5053472	DarkSakura.com
5076221	5082604	Zanac, and if you ever have played this game or have seen it played, you can definitely tell it's a freaking compile game.
5083004	5085405	I mean, seriously, it's fucking compile.
5087226	5095129	It is, like I said, designed by Compile and released in Japan by Pony Canyon and by FCI in the US.
5095690	5098671	It was first an MSX game, as was Gartic.
5101004	5118582	which we got Guarded Gaiden as the Guardian Legend and it came out on the Famicom Disk System and the NES and later on came out for the Virtual Console and it also came out on MSX2 as Zanac EX and PlayStation as Zanac X Zanac
5119182	5125768	So basically you play one ship called the AFX-6502 Zanac through 12 levels, and you have to destroy the system.
5126309	5127890	Ooh, taking down the system!
5128751	5136238	So you have... It was actually developed by some of the main developers at Compile.
5137580	5141503	These are the same ones who went in to do the Guardian Legend, Blazing Lasers, and Puyo Puyo.
5143025	5144046	It was basically...
5145896	5154482	And this is where I say you can tell it's a freaking Compile shooter because watching it looks like playing through those shooting levels of Guardian Legend, I mean, down to graphical style and everything.
5155022	5157984	The music is definitely Compile stuff.
5158804	5163727	And just watching it through, it's a very fast and kind of difficult game.
5163908	5165509	It's really not super easy.
5166549	5169191	And, you know, you've got your weapons boosts.
5169271	5174675	You either game over when you lose your lives or you beat the game.
5174815	5177757	You do get extra lives as you go.
5179571	5181993	Thank you for watching.
5182013	5183574	See you next time.
5197042	5198884	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5215199	5216220	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5235809	5237891	And that's the thing about Compile.
5237931	5240714	You notice they did have the little ground things that you shoot there?
5241315	5246360	Those exact things were in Guardian Legend that had your power-up.
5247300	5248722	And even the way those bullets look.
5248742	5249342	Those are bullets.
5249723	5251505	Straight out of Guardian Legend, too.
5251525	5252706	Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
5252746	5256449	It's good that you did, because Compile, I mean, basically until, you know...
5257350	5266938	For all of their NES shooters, Compile really did, or I shouldn't just say NES, I should just say their 8-bit shooters, really did stick with a certain style.
5266998	5272463	Even Blazing Lasers, to an extent, has that overwhelming Compile look to it.
5273164	5276206	And I hate to say it, if you play one Compile shooter, you've played most of them.
5277187	5283533	You know, except Guardian Legend actually happened to have really cool adventure sequences and so much to do.
5284213	5304735	Now, um, there was that compilation, like I mentioned, for PlayStation that was Zanac, uh, ex-Zanac, and, um, as far as that's concerned, it also had an updated version of Zanac called Zanac Neo, and the different, uh, NES versions, so I'd definitely say if someone can find that, they should go ahead and do it, because...
5306016	5321279	All in all, even if you get over its striking similarities to the other games, then it's still, you know, it's still a very good shooter to play.
5322259	5325220	And I'd definitely say it's worth adding to any library.
5325920	5327140	So, that's it.
5327240	5327680	Xanak.
5328740	5329140	There it is.
5329180	5332661	If anyone's wondering if I've done this before, I think you might be getting confused with Zexy's.
5333937	5336718	Yes, you did do sexies, I remember that, but you've never done Xanic.
5337119	5346943	No, we were, wow, somebody has already updated, I was on the wiki because somebody in chat was suggesting that you do Shenmue, and I was like, yeah, I know, Actdeft was like, I think she's done it, and I'm like, really, when?
5347264	5352706	And sure enough, you did do that in episode 326, something like that was long, 356, a long time ago.
5352726	5353387	500-something episodes ago.
5353407	5353627	Yes.
5354187	5355148	This list is getting very long.
5355408	5359793	But as I'm on the list, already updated to say Zanac there, episode 527.
5359893	5361655	Well done, wiki editors.
5361796	5366020	And honestly, and I have to say through the people who update the wiki, I seriously do rely on you.
5366481	5373228	Because, I mean, if you guys are having trouble remembering what I've picked, imagine the trouble I'm having when... No, no, no, no.
5373288	5374309	I have to describe this.
5374410	5374830	I've got...
5376111	5380153	A wall of shelves behind me at my house that's loaded with video games.
5380693	5383814	And I have to look at this shit going, what have I not done?
5384475	5388136	So I just started picking games by freaking year and I picked 1986 this time.
5389116	5390297	So it worked.
5391097	5394319	Fun OLR trivia, the very first Classic Game of the Week, episode 250.
5395379	5396860	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5422336	5426357	I was saving it, but you were very much like, you know what?
5426497	5427018	To hell with it.
5427198	5428178	Episode 256.
5428378	5436040	I kind of go through this thing where I don't want to do things that are too expected or too much of the, everybody loves this fucking game, ooh.
5436401	5436661	Sure.
5436761	5443323	You know, I want to do something that maybe people haven't heard of or good games that people just may have overlooked.
5443383	5446084	But sometimes you have to do Final Fantasy VI twice.
5446824	5448605	No, sometimes... Which didn't happen.
5448685	5449125	Yeah.
5449225	5449565	Yeah.
5450505	5453006	Well, like I said, it's hard to remember.
5453226	5453886	It's fine.
5453926	5459728	You know, I'm probably going to have to do Kickle Cubicle just because Dan was playing it the other day.
5459828	5463650	I still have a list like a mile long of Commodore 64 games whenever you're ready.
5463690	5465730	You need to show me some of these games.
5465850	5467531	I'm going to do Oregon Trail next week, guys.
5467631	5468311	That would be awesome.
5468331	5469232	Why don't you do Oregon Trail?
5469252	5469752	That game was awesome.
5469772	5470032	All right.
5470112	5470472	I might.
5470712	5472393	If you have some suggestions for DarkSakura.
5472453	5478995	Oregon Trail is stuck in my head because I just got finished reading Problem Sleuth and there's a whole tribute to Oregon Trail in there.
5479275	5479575	Nice.
5479735	5480516	Yeah.
5480576	5482478	You can hit DarkSakura up on Tumblr.
5482658	5485881	I usually would give you out your Twitter, but you don't really check Twitter, do you?
5485981	5486381	You know what?
5486461	5488082	I make sure to check Twitter at least once a week.
5488222	5490184	So my Twitter is DarkSakura.
5490384	5490745	There you go.
5490865	5492646	My Tumblr is Kuro Tsubasa.
5492906	5495448	K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A.
5496049	5496629	Blackwing.
5497150	5499552	Because I'm so dark.
5500052	5502194	Or, shoot, send something.
5502414	5503475	Harass me on the mailbag.
5503495	5506377	I'll complain about it and then critique your grammar and then I'll probably do it.
5506598	5506878	All right.
5506918	5508179	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
5508784	5509644	We're going to take a break, though.
5509664	5510745	I think I've done Twinby.
5511465	5530132	Speaking of the mailbag, we're going to take a quick break, then we're going to come back, and we're going to do the mailbag, and the FUs of the week, and your live phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Ones Radio, Rapid Fire News, PS4 sales, politics and games, and pornography in Part B tonight.
5530412	5534094	Yes, a legit porn story coming up in Part B tonight.
5534134	5535974	So you definitely don't want to go anywhere.
5536034	5537515	We will be right back after this.
5544150	5554697	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this Sunday evening, November the 17th, 2013, with the 527th episode of our show already in progress.
5555257	5562162	And some good classic songs from some old games there during our break, which sadly we can't play during the podcast, but we do play live.
5562462	5566965	We had the epilogue from Final Fantasy IV, which I always loved that ending, one of my favorites, right?
5567645	5573369	And then Mega Man 7's introduction, which, you know, I think there's mixed opinions on Mega Man 7, but I thought it was pretty cool.
5574470	5589585	During the break, a lot of folks in our chat room, I noticed over at live.vognetwork.com talking about weight loss and a lot of successes, which is interesting because Thanksgiving is not usually the time of year you hear about weight loss, but a lot of people have been successful with their various things, including DarkSakura.
5589605	5591467	You've been, I know, doing very well.
5591787	5600632	Yeah, I'm actually, and I know it's going to sound fad-like and everything, but I've done similar stuff before, and I honestly feel better doing it.
5601092	5610777	I'm doing this whole ketogenic eating thing where it's really low-carb, but you also have a percentage of how much fat you eat and how much protein you eat, and that's a lot of protein.
5611857	5621845	But I also go to the gym at least once a week and I do bodyweight exercises in my house if I don't go to the gym.
5621905	5627169	So it's working out with weights three times a week and walking on the opposite days.
5627685	5629947	I really couldn't do low carb because I just love bread.
5630427	5631888	Is there a diet where I could eat nothing but bread?
5631968	5635751	Well, I did find a recipe to make bread out of coconut flour.
5636472	5637612	Oh, I like coconut.
5637913	5643637	And Tiara sent me a recipe to do red velvet cupcakes, which I'm going to be trying.
5643697	5644137	Yum.
5644538	5649922	I have actually found a lot of people speak very highly of almond flour bread and coconut flour bread.
5650182	5650522	Interesting.
5650762	5653344	So, and I haven't missed it, honestly.
5653564	5654965	I need to get motivated.
5655966	5656787	I need to get Wii Fit U.
5658227	5664430	Well, to be honest, it was just sort of like... You remember when I moved out here, how much I put on?
5664890	5667611	Like, I'm going to say it on air, I was a size 20.
5668292	5669252	I don't mind saying it.
5669672	5671213	And I dropped down to a 12.
5672453	5673694	And then I put back on some.
5674114	5675135	So, it's like...
5676355	5696319	I could just continue to eat all the stuff that makes me feel like shit because I've got digestion problems eating too much sugar actually makes me have harder time concentrating and since cutting all of it out I'm actually feeling infinitely better than I ever did and plus I have more energy for stuff I want to do I'm planning on playing DDR again
5697405	5700749	Gene in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Wow, we are all so healthy.
5701229	5701590	Not me.
5701930	5702531	No, not me.
5702631	5703872	Actdeft says, We fit you up.
5705374	5708517	I need to figure out something to get into, but we'll see.
5709098	5709939	All right, moving on.
5711080	5712681	Let's get into some rapid-fire news.
5712742	5713462	Back to games.
5713843	5717747	This is another reason why I'm not losing any weight, because I'm too busy playing video games.
5718027	5718927	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5739060	5744323	What I've started doing now, I have set times now for me to play my games.
5744983	5748425	I play Animal Crossing in the morning so that I can go to the island and get a tan because fuck.
5750286	5757990	But I play while walking around the house and feeding the cat and putting up dishes and doing chores in the house.
5758030	5759131	I'll do parts of it.
5759431	5762573	And then the hour while my character's on the island is when I go do yoga.
5764053	5788490	so it actually using my I'm using my games to help me set my exercise times okay so I know that when an hour is up I hopefully I do about maybe 30 minutes of yoga and then I do just you know wandering around the house and some housework because housework counts as exercise fuck it and by the time I'm done with that I know it's time to come back from the island and hit Ed with a bug net because fuck him
5789514	5794815	Yeah, I guess maybe there's a way I could get on the treadmill and have a 3DS or something, an iPad or something.
5794835	5796576	I used to play Pokemon on the recumbent bike.
5796816	5797056	Nice.
5797976	5799036	Maybe I could figure something like that out.
5799516	5803577	Oh, well, for now, let's get back into video games because that's what the show's about.
5803737	5806038	So, Loki, some rapid-fire news for us.
5806318	5815940	Yes, Infamous Second Son, which was supposed to be coming out first quarter, they finally announced that it will be launching March 21st in North America.
5816980	5839268	and they had a wonderful trailer that was during their whole launch special that they did definitely one of the only games I'm kind of looking forward to on that another interesting one Towerfall Ascension you may remember Towerfall from being one of the more popular Ouya games now it's coming to PC and it's going to be coming to PlayStation 4 as well that's gotta suck for Ouya a little bit
5840228	5854257	um also brand new levels and they've got 50 new levels coming they said and 50 new versus levels four more playable characters and 12 player cooperative quest mode six additional power-ups and more
5856443	5862006	And last but not least, Rayman Legends is supposed to be coming to next-gen consoles in February.
5862926	5863807	That's so funny.
5864207	5868969	It was like when the Wii U was supposed to be coming out on the Wii U in February and it never did.
5870189	5872390	Are you throwing shade that that might not actually happen?
5872991	5874251	I don't know if it's going to be February.
5874311	5876632	Yeah, it's going to be coming out on next-gen consoles.
5876652	5882475	I don't know how they're going to make that, if it's going to look as good because I would think on a next-gen console they're going to have to
5883095	5884897	Yeah, maybe they don't do anything with the graphics.
5884917	5890423	They might just up-res some things and do some new textures and things to make it look a little sharper.
5891384	5892765	Frame rate would be really good.
5893266	5900033	All I can think of in my head is that Extifer will have yet another reason to do a stream of Rayman Legends over on his little Twitch channel that he does.
5901394	5903056	I think he played the thing start to finish on Twitch.
5903156	5904298	Wow, that's interesting.
5904958	5905960	All right.
5906020	5906460	Moving on.
5906581	5908003	Some stuff that I hear.
5908784	5912589	I hear click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click from Loki as soon as he's done with his story.
5912649	5914031	Cookie, cookie, cookie, cookie, cookie.
5914732	5915794	I'm going to be done with this game today.
5917816	5920477	Your addiction is affecting your life in the following ways.
5920497	5921337	I may have cheated a little bit.
5921357	5922858	Look at your life, look at your choices.
5922878	5924299	That's a teensy bit.
5924619	5925379	All right, you have cheated.
5925639	5929681	Well, maybe the next thing that Loki can get addicted to is Hatsune Miku Project Diva.
5929961	5930321	Woo!
5931541	5933142	Ah, hey, now this game's really cute.
5933742	5941105	And if you missed it on the PlayStation 3 for whatever reason, A, buy it on sale or something, but B, it will be coming out on the Vita in early 2014.
5942466	5943006	Very cool.
5943086	5945827	So yeah, Hatsune Miku coming out in the North America and Europe.
5946648	5948750	in early 2014 on the Vita.
5948850	5949891	So that was announced this week.
5950031	5950651	Very exciting.
5952093	5968809	When we were getting into it a couple weeks ago on our last episode about the whole fact that Swapnote was disabled on the 3DS, somebody had brought up, well, WeKaraokeU has some F-words and things in it, so why is it that you can't send pictures of
5969870	5975977	DONGs on Swapnote, but yet you can have fucking shit and all these words in songs on WeKaraokeU.
5976537	5989452	Well, apparently this week it was announced that warnings will be added to the game's eShop page when you get an access token for WeKaraokeU and in the app itself that will warn people.
5990052	6001136	We Karaoke U by JoySound is intended to provide users with access to a large catalog of songs from a broad range of music labels across a variety of musical genres designed to appeal to all musical tastes.
6001617	6009019	As such, Nintendo does not restrict which songs are included in the catalog of songs featured within the We Karaoke U by JoySound application.
6009460	6010540	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
6010580	6012741	The songs aren't rated by Peggy.
6012781	6014201	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
6014642	6014822	So...
6016062	6024063	Interesting little retcon they had to do, for lack of a better word, on some of their other games that have adult themes.
6025564	6028164	I find this fascinating, and I've got to check this out this week.
6029584	6031385	I heard about this before, and I'm sure you all did too.
6031745	6035965	There was a Chinese hack a couple years ago of Final Fantasy VII.
6036686	6038706	They shoved it into an NES cartridge.
6038746	6045107	I don't know which Final Fantasy game they had hacked or if they programmed a new game or something, but somebody took Final Fantasy VII and put it in an NES cartridge
6045347	6047409	Well, that was a couple years ago that that happened.
6047489	6056196	But this week, it was actually a translation patch that happened by Modder Luigia.
6056936	6058838	I'm tempted to say Luigia, but it's Luigia 2009.
6059218	6061100	Actually, it was a whole team.
6061140	6061860	It wasn't just one guy.
6062181	6065423	But this Modder led this team to actually translate the game.
6065443	6068586	But at the same time, they actually fixed some things.
6068626	6074631	They redrew some of the graphics, improved the music, did an actual ending, bug fixes, improvements,
6075171	6076152	This is kind of crazy.
6076232	6084979	Now it's like a legit game that you can play through and check out if you want to check it out in English because I guess it was super broken in its original form, but now it's able to play.
6085079	6087300	So really curious to see what that looks like.
6089002	6089342	Yeah.
6090723	6099390	Their next project that they're working on, a unlicensed NES port of Pokemon Yellow that came out from the same company on the NES.
6099790	6103493	They're going to redo that one in English and fix some of those issues next.
6103673	6104354	That's pretty awesome.
6105094	6105535	DarkSakura
6125713	6129195	and there's going to be a PlayStation exclusive mission called Deja Vu.
6129896	6138201	There's a trailer for it that's been out and this is supposed to come out in the spring of 2014 for the various systems of Microsoft and Sony persuasions.
6139902	6140762	In other news...
6143485	6158781	There is going to be... It looks like a new third-person game that's coming out by Monolith called Middle-Earth Shadow of Mordor that is going to be based in the Lord of the Rings universe, and you play as a ranger named Talion.
6159602	6159842	So...
6162648	6189191	he's resurrected as a vengeful spirit and he gets to be a wraith like person and then last but not least in the thing that refuses to load on my iPad there is a new character that has been confirmed for the next Smash Brothers and that's Marth not really a new character but you know Marth fans will be happy that he's back as long as we get Roy too
6190876	6213380	I think some of the partner characters are the ones in danger like you know it's it's no it's no surprise that you know Star Fox will be a character that's in the game but will Captain Falcon come back or not Captain Falcon god damn it the other dude Captain Falcon should be there Captain Falcon from F-Zero will absolutely be there what uh this bird Falco Falco yeah he will he may not be back
6213940	6217264	Good Good Falco's a bitch Yeah, he's totally a bitch Not even a good kind of bitch Hey Rob Show me your moves
6240749	6243812	every week over at Facebook and Google+.
6244032	6245974	You take those words and slam them together, you get Fugle.
6246434	6250839	We ask a question of our listeners, and we read some of the answers here for y'all here on the show.
6251319	6259707	This week's question, as asked of our communities, since the PlayStation 4 came out, we've noticed an increase of social media posts coming from the device.
6260227	6263770	This can include tweets or Facebook posts when someone starts playing the game.
6264011	6264751	Have y'all noticed this?
6264771	6265392	Because I sure did.
6265772	6267813	Lots more Facebook posts coming from the PlayStation 4.
6268154	6269655	I ignore Facebook.
6269675	6270175	You blocked it?
6270215	6270635	Kind of.
6270855	6272997	Well, I haven't blocked it, but I haven't really paid attention.
6273437	6276239	Oh, I noticed a big increase in the amount of posts.
6276579	6279040	I see posts now when people start playing a game.
6279581	6288866	So I was very surprised at the increased amount of, you know, I don't want to say spam, but automated posts coming from the PlayStation.
6289247	6291048	Anyway, so that led into our question this week.
6291508	6296649	For the PlayStation 4 owners, do you use social media posting features on your new device?
6296709	6297210	Why or why not?
6297730	6302731	And for the non-PlayStation 4 owners, do you like seeing the social media posts made from the PlayStation 4?
6303451	6305092	So let's get to some of the answers.
6305512	6307372	There's so many tonight, I'm not going to be able to read them all.
6307792	6308913	We'll start with a couple from Google+.
6309653	6315015	Colin M replied and said, I only like to see posts when a person starts a game for the first time.
6315535	6319357	That way I know what games they're playing and maybe join in or talk to them about it.
6319637	6322818	I do not need to see every time an achievement or trophy unlocks.
6324179	6335263	I would agree, especially if you're meaning that to say like the first and old, like not the subsequent times they start the game, the very first time, just kind of know that they have it and you can ask them questions about it, but I don't need to see like
6335743	6339004	So and so is playing Resogun for the 7,000th time today.
6339064	6340104	It's like, I don't need to see that.
6340845	6347927	Redertainment says, As a non-PlayStation 4 owner, posts of people having fun with their PS4 serve as a taunt to me.
6348287	6350108	A taunt of things that they have that I don't.
6350488	6353629	I'm experiencing this more and more as I pursue Project Buy a House.
6354249	6363274	When, but not if, but when I buy my house and I begin to fill social media with pictures of my house, those pictures will taunt people with what I have, and they don't.
6363974	6364574	That's true.
6364594	6369497	That's the whole point of doing it, though, is to say, oh, so-and-so has this.
6369717	6370377	I want that.
6371978	6374259	Is that why people post pictures of their kids, too?
6375380	6376460	My kid's the cutest.
6376680	6377261	Happy face.
6377321	6382963	Well, I personally think that for some people, having children is an unspoken competition, but don't get me started on that.
6385260	6388644	For some people I've met, buying a house is an unspoken competition.
6388924	6390206	So, I'm just saying.
6391207	6394170	In the past, a good friend of mine just bought a house.
6394190	6395051	I'm not shading that.
6395091	6397674	I'm talking about in the past, many years ago.
6399395	6402719	And Alan knows exactly what I'm talking about and he's over there saying it too.
6403079	6403600	Alright, anyway.
6405811	6417139	Let's see, Actdeft says, I only try to use any social media sharing when it's something like truly special or great, like getting a really hard achievement or trophy or telling people that I'll stream a game since now that's possible with the new consoles.
6418240	6423404	Let's go over to Facebook and get some of the answers over on Facebook and see what people said there.
6423744	6450902	how about Burr who said so far as a PS4 owner I've only posted one gameplay clip to Facebook mostly just to see if it worked nobody responded though so I'll probably save it for funny bugs or things that are actually interesting people probably don't want to hear about every little thing I do so I shut off the automatic posting the real fun so far has been the Twitch streaming it's actually an incentive to keep playing since you're entertaining others as much as yourself let's see Scott W said I've just started trying it out with screenshots I like it
6451802	6457024	Um, Codeman says, I don't have a PlayStation 4 yet, but I don't mind posts if they are from consoles.
6457304	6460865	What frustrates me is when people invite me to Facebook games and Candy Crush.
6461745	6467667	But I enjoy seeing what my friends are playing and it's a chance to get an unbiased opinion rather than the media companies telling me what to play.
6468168	6468948	Ooh, I like that answer.
6470104	6498473	TigerClaw says while having those features on the PS4 is good when you want to post something the only downside is your Twitter or Facebook post would be spammed with so and so playing this game or unlock a trophy if they give the player the ability to control what is posted on Twitter and Facebook then some people won't be bombarded with PS4 spam I kind of agree like I don't like the whole idea of all or nothing like let me again I don't have a PS4 so I don't know how it works but I know on the PS3 you don't get to pick either you turn it on or you turn it off
6499053	6510701	and you can turn on like certain types of posts but I can't like tell it only post these trophies or what have you that would kind of be a little better I would think or they could have the trophy pop up and say hey do you want to post this to your wall
6511978	6515059	Gene W replied and said, I currently do not have a PlayStation 4.
6515379	6521400	However, I'm against these messages because I dislike them already on Facebook and don't really have a desire to have a friends list.
6523041	6531963	Flaming Toilet, God, I love that name, responds and says, I may be a grumpy old man, but I think we've gone way overboard with social media integration everywhere, not just gaming.
6532503	6534085	The world doesn't need to know my business.
6534325	6536989	I certainly don't want to annoy people with it any more than I have to.
6537329	6540153	And I don't really care what trophies other people get or whatever.
6540573	6546961	And yes, there's every bit of irony in using social media to bitch about social media's ever-growing presence in our lives.
6548744	6549905	So that's a good way to end it.
6550005	6551267	I only read like half the answers.
6551307	6553650	So please do check out Facebook and Google Plus for more answers.
6553991	6559779	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.
6559819	6560159	That's right.
6560199	6561461	We finally have a short URL.
6561721	6564265	Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.
6564525	6572051	And then there's a whole, like, you know, Google+, shoved down throat, YouTube comments thing all tweaked and stuff and how people love that.
6572071	6574032	Yeah, I'm not sure how I feel about all that.
6574092	6576214	Like, I'm trying to embrace it.
6576294	6579316	I'm trying to do the whole hug it for 15 minutes and see if I like it.
6580017	6580777	I will tell you this.
6580837	6583599	More like hug it for 15 minutes and see if you get a skin disease.
6584440	6585481	I'm trying to...
6587341	6591284	trying to embrace it with the whole fact that I'm getting into YouTube more, which is unrelated.
6591325	6598030	But I'm like, all right, well, maybe this is an incentive to use Google Plus to do more like gaming style posts that tie into the YouTubes I do.
6598050	6603035	So I'm like, I'm trying to like it that way, but obviously it's a very unpopular change.
6605196	6613700	But I don't know, Google used to be the company that could do no wrong And lately, between, you know, what was that?
6614321	6616782	Before they had Google+, they had, what was that social network?
6616822	6628528	Buzz, oh God, that network was, yeah, that was just bad And then, you know, they've done some weird things lately I still love them, but I question some of their choices
6628948	6632091	All right, let's get back into some long gaming news.
6632611	6632891	Loki.
6633292	6633712	Buzz.
6634412	6635533	I forgot about that.
6635633	6635954	Oh, yes.
6637295	6640638	Anyways, let's talk about PlayStation 4 again.
6640838	6641138	Why not?
6642499	6644220	Sold 1 million units the first day.
6644901	6645942	So that's got to be pretty good.
6646903	6657551	And kind of along the lines of their prediction, which is, or I should say projection, 3 million units sold by the end of the year is the estimate by Jack Trenton.
6657571	6658572	Look at all that wine I just wasted.
6658832	6662476	So that's pretty good.
6662956	6670864	I think availability is going to factor in quite heavily, especially with the systems coming out.
6670885	6672186	I don't think it's going to be an issue where...
6673179	6680226	I'm not really sure with the Wii U whether it was availability as a problem or demand not being that high.
6680246	6688534	Actually, I think it's demand not being that high because I remember there was a bunch of systems sitting at retail in piles and no one gave a shit.
6689415	6697197	But the PlayStation 4, if there's any sort of indicator whatsoever, the gray market is pretty profitable right now.
6697317	6699257	So there is demand for the system.
6699577	6705319	It's just going to be availability is going to be kind of slim until, I don't know, a few months from now.
6705639	6716201	And it actually may even be a few months more because with the launch in other territories, they're going to have to ramp up production more or there's just going to be less systems to go around.
6716921	6722362	We're not expecting those types of shortages though that we saw with the Wii and the 360 and all that, right?
6722382	6725703	I don't think it's going to be as bad as the Wii.
6726463	6732445	What I've been hearing is a few weeks out or probably a month from launch, we're going to see some more shipments coming in.
6732585	6737926	Although, this is completely one other side of the spectrum.
6737986	6741347	If you're a consumer trying to pre-order one of those things...
6742067	6743408	Keep an eye on that and Amazon and
6766127	6767227	Yeah, but you know what?
6767267	6770489	GameStop loves to use scare tactics to get people to pre-order.
6770529	6771289	So fuck that.
6771389	6775651	I don't believe anything they say as far as... Amazon had... I think Amazon had bundles available.
6776591	6777332	Game system bundles.
6777352	6779893	It's probably people like me that canceled their pre-orders, honestly.
6780353	6782594	They probably had a few of those to go.
6782634	6785235	So somebody bought my PlayStation 4, which is fine.
6786536	6788416	But yeah, that's probably what that was, to be honest.
6789137	6789417	All right.
6791397	6793117	How do you think the Xbox One will sell?
6793157	6796238	I mean, I don't want to get too fanboy wars-ish, but what do you think?
6797298	6798478	I think it'll sell alright.
6799058	6801799	I'm worried that they're going to have a bigger problem with availability.
6802179	6808400	Because as of right now, they're really shrinking down who's getting the system.
6809480	6813281	And you're not going to see it at all independent retailers.
6813321	6816161	You're going to see it at the big stores, and that's it.
6816301	6818882	So if they're having an issue with production on that stuff...
6819802	6821183	Then, yeah, they could be a problem.
6821403	6824344	But, I think they've got a pretty decent lineup at launch.
6824544	6829067	And I think they'll do about as well as the PlayStation, or the Xbox One, or the PlayStation 4.
6829727	6831288	And the Xbox One will do about the same.
6831928	6833469	Really, it comes down to exclusives.
6833629	6841132	And, let's be honest, going forward, you know, in the least immediate future, a lot of the games that are coming out next gen are on both systems.
6841253	6846995	So, it's, there's not a whole lot differentiating one from the other as far as games go.
6847335	6847556	I mean...
6848596	6849778	So, I don't know.
6850059	6850820	Titanfall, I guess.
6850880	6851682	I mean, there's that.
6852423	6854447	But that's on 360 even in PC.
6854507	6855249	So, I don't know.
6856291	6857112	Pocket Station Vita
6880587	6882249	Thanks for watching!
6899869	6904713	On December 3rd, non-PlayStation Plus Japanese owners will be able to get it.
6904833	6908535	There's also a PlayStation title that's going to be added to that.
6908835	6910497	Dokodemo Isho comes out.
6911237	6918022	No word about when this is being released in the U.S., but you've got to think that, hey, if it happened over there, it will probably happen here too at some point.
6918062	6918822	That's pretty cool.
6919362	6924666	That'll be a fun little perk for PlayStation Plus users over here, especially if those free games are still involved.
6925426	6927828	The other thing I was going to mention, and we kind of forgot to mention,
6929690	6932133	PS Vita TV came out over in Japan.
6932433	6933154	Oh, yeah!
6933255	6934236	People are kind of digging it.
6934256	6937721	Another thing that I heard that kind of sucked about it is it's region locked.
6938642	6940044	Oh, come on!
6940084	6944069	The Vita doesn't normally do that, so it's a little strange that it's like that.
6944129	6945451	They're trying to stop us from...
6946813	6947314	I'm not sure.
6947334	6948956	I don't know if it's region locked.
6949697	6950338	I had to read up.
6950458	6952100	I didn't really look into it too much.
6952160	6954263	But I mean, I gotta be honest when that thing comes over here.
6954283	6961472	I kind of want one just because, you know, it's a good way, especially with all these free games I'm getting from the, you know, PlayStation Plus.
6961632	6961793	Yeah.
6962413	6966797	I could play these PSP and Vita and PlayStation games and stuff on there.
6967377	6968819	And I don't know.
6968839	6971180	I think that'd be pretty awesome with DualShock controller and stuff.
6971401	6977386	You know, Gene has a good question in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com saying, I wonder if the Vita sales went up with the PlayStation 4 release.
6977426	6980048	You know, we're not hearing a lot about that, but I'm hearing about the second screen.
6980088	6981329	People are really loving that.
6981369	6982210	Those that do have a Vita.
6982390	6987594	I do have to tell you that Dan was telling me that Vitas actually went on sale at RadioShack for $120.
6987934	6989956	That did happen the week we were gone.
6989976	6991037	Yeah, I remember reading about that.
6991337	6991577	Yeah.
6992678	6995679	Loki, have you heard anything about the sales for Vita?
6995899	6999020	I mean, I can't imagine there's a lot of people that can afford to buy both at once.
6999060	7003222	I haven't really been seeing... We haven't been seeing a lot of Vita sales, if anything.
7003262	7006443	I mean, it'd be interesting to see if it does go up at retail.
7006463	7011125	I mean, I'm thinking, if anything, there's people just clearing out inventory because they probably were sitting on a bunch of them.
7011505	7015166	I'm sure with Black Friday, you're going to see some special deals on that stuff.
7015186	7019868	There was supposed to be one that was with Tearaway, but that got retailer-exclusived, so...
7020248	7029940	Well, it will also still be interesting to see what happens with the PlayStation Vita in Japan versus here because I realize that Christmas isn't quite the same in Japan as it is here but it's still, you know, a deal.
7030652	7038396	and there's going to be the PlayStation Vita, the new colors and the new redesign of it already happened.
7038796	7041298	So that's kind of what Sony's pushing in Japan right now.
7041338	7049662	So I'm really curious to see how that kind of affects things because you could look at potentially there being more Vitas per person in Japan than there are here.
7050222	7052764	It would be very interesting to see how that affects the development of the games.
7053564	7053704	So...
7055785	7067068	Go to retirementlive.vognetwork.com Brad, our buddy from PodCulture, who has renamed himself PS4Culture tonight, says his co-host Glenn bought a Vita just for the PlayStation 4 tie-in stuff.
7067148	7067528	Wow.
7069369	7073050	That's a heck of a purchase, but hey, if you can do it, why not?
7073830	7075410	Alright, more news.
7075530	7077431	DarkSakura taking a different turn here.
7078374	7081797	Well, game politics has alerted us to something.
7081937	7091324	Remember how we kept talking about the 38 Studios and their sort of downturn with the local economy in Rhode Island?
7091644	7095067	Yes, that was the one that was owned by, what was the name, Curt Schilling, the baseball player, right?
7095267	7097169	You are correct.
7097189	7099310	They did the Kingdom of Amalur.
7099631	7100011	Exactly.
7100031	7101312	Which is free on PlayStation Plus now.
7101332	7107337	Well, now their state senator, Dawson Hodgson, who is Republican, so whatever...
7107777	7108358	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7123068	7126372	is a pretty big deal, especially for such a tiny state.
7126472	7129094	I mean, I don't know too much more about Rhode Island.
7129114	7130075	I've known people from there.
7130296	7132398	Well, the state loaned them money.
7133058	7133219	Exactly.
7133239	7135120	Which is probably the reason for this.
7135321	7140746	Which comes right out of tax funds, things to pay for state improvement, whatever.
7145364	7171237	help, benefits, that type of thing so I can see them wanting to investigate this and one thing that he said I know that I'm not alone in the belief that the response of our government has been wholly insufficient to the task of delivering answers, accountability and leadership in the wake of this massive destruction of public resources swift enactment of the bill and diligent prosecution of its mandate would vindicate these needs
7172077	7184445	and I get where they're coming from at the same time I wonder if it's just something that it's time to let go let go, move forward, find other ways of raising the funds because you can't
7187873	7197876	Yeah, I mean, I understand the reason why they might want to do the investigation, but at the same time, it's like one of those, well, it's not going to get the money back.
7198156	7201937	You know, what ultimate good is it really going to do?
7202057	7205258	I mean, I guess they can, you know, make sure this never happens again.
7205378	7209959	But I kind of think a lesson has certainly already been learned somewhere.
7210179	7212700	But maybe it's about holding certain people accountable.
7212720	7213060	I don't know.
7213340	7225147	I do think accountability is something to look into, but at the same time, I'm wondering if perhaps the state might have been a little short-sighted in funding a company in the middle of a recession.
7225647	7228469	Were they starry-eyed at the fact it was a sports star?
7229542	7229983	Probably.
7230043	7230423	Probably.
7230564	7230964	Probably.
7231124	7237053	Did you hear that they found a full finished game on their servers that they're going to now auction off in December?
7237414	7237754	Really?
7237834	7238195	No.
7238215	7238535	Good.
7238656	7240999	There was another game that was literally done.
7241039	7242321	It was for Mac, actually.
7242341	7243162	It was a PC game.
7243383	7243643	Weird.
7243683	7244765	Some sort of tactics game.
7244905	7245526	And then it got...
7246246	7246987	Well, they should do it.
7247207	7247867	Yeah, why not?
7249268	7250229	I thought that was kind of funny.
7252030	7253151	Rhode Island paid for it.
7253171	7255193	Why didn't you sell it?
7255213	7256514	You could have made some money back.
7256694	7257414	Yeah, a little bit.
7258836	7263579	The sad thing is it probably won't sell for very much money because nobody knows about it.
7263619	7264680	It's got not a lot behind it.
7264760	7269604	So probably go at bargain basement prices and somebody will flip it and do pretty well with it.
7270184	7270504	We'll see.
7271485	7271825	All right.
7272706	7273406	Let's move on.
7273627	7273887	Loki.
7274207	7288557	Alright, so let's talk about Zune and the fact that, yeah, I think we already knew it was kind of shutting down, but it's going away as soon as the Xbox One launch.
7290638	7293720	And yeah, they're not going to support rental purchasing or browsing of content.
7294395	7299577	And it's going to be, I guess, now everything's being taken care of through Xbox Music.
7299657	7311441	So, you know, I guess if you're a previous Zune user and you log into the Xbox Music service, it will show your library as a virtual collector or something.
7311721	7316123	And I guess any previous purchase video content will transfer over.
7316923	7317403	So that's good.
7319889	7320329	It's too bad.
7320730	7324053	They really tried to... They tried to make Zune happen.
7324073	7325034	They really tried.
7325054	7327616	They sort of tried to compete with the iPods.
7328637	7329638	It just didn't quite happen.
7330259	7333282	We had a nice listing in the Zunecast store for a while.
7335244	7337706	Thanks to the new listeners we got through Zunecast.
7337806	7340709	Sorry to hear about what happened to your Zune, but it is what it is.
7343012	7343292	All right.
7343732	7351581	Well, in somewhat brighter news, I guess, on the Microsoft front, one of the games that people are very excited about on Xbox One, Killer Instinct.
7351961	7354824	And almost more so because of Killer Instinct's classic.
7355345	7360551	It's not just the fact that there's the new Killer Instinct, but that you can play the classic Killer Instinct as well.
7361831	7365232	The Ultra Edition is coming out of the classic Killer Instinct.
7365853	7369834	It will have two versions of the arcade version of Killer Instinct.
7370054	7371774	Obviously, it's not the Super Nintendo version.
7372155	7372655	I mean, right?
7373055	7375936	So, Killer Instinct will get the arcade versions.
7376796	7395609	Killer Instinct Classic will have the original arcade version, version 1.4, and the upgraded ROM revision 1.5D, which has glitch fixes, infinite combos that were discovered after the game's initial releases were fixed, also some emulating scanline options.
7396349	7400332	A training mode is there now, though, and sprite galleries will be available.
7401313	7401914	That's pretty cool.
7403155	7410765	The Killer Instinct Classic, it is only available in Killer Instinct's Ultra Edition and the Boxed Pin Ultimate Edition.
7411245	7412807	You will not be able to buy it separately.
7412907	7416592	So if you want this, you have to buy the free-to-play Killer Instinct game.
7418410	7419692	That's the only way to do it.
7419852	7423759	I know people that are going to be buying it just so they can have the classic version.
7423819	7424881	Because, you know what?
7424941	7427765	Killer Instinct, especially the classic version, was awesome.
7428026	7429889	And it'll have more characters than the new one.
7430410	7431351	That's the sad part.
7434866	7437188	They announced Fulgore for what it's worth.
7438068	7440389	The classic one is way better than the new one.
7441910	7451636	You know what's way better each and every week is our mailbag because we get to hear from you guys at our email address mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com
7452662	7458908	DarkSakura is going to dive into the mailbag headfirst and find some emails that she deems worthy of reading on the show.
7458928	7461510	And I imagine after a week off we have quite the backlog, no?
7461870	7462251	A few.
7464432	7475082	There is a really long one that I'm just going to only read the first paragraph because this is really fucking long.
7477894	7480176	Um, and I'm not gonna read the Uber Novel, sorry.
7480536	7483338	So, um, it's from Rostel UT.
7483358	7484238	Hi.
7485619	7491383	Um, well, in a few hours I'll be waiting in a midnight line for the PS4 at my local GameStop, so I thought I would shoot you guys an email before that.
7492024	7498788	Anyway, when talking about the news that defined the generation, I am surprised that Brown vs. Entertainment Merchants Association wasn't brought up.
7499268	7504452	With all the talk of blaming video games for society's ills, it's hard to argue with the 7-2 decision when the time comes...
7504972	7505733	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
7526451	7537678	Whoever eventually replaces the older members of the court will almost certainly be more aware of gaming as a medium, and California's already beaten economy was done no favors by the massive reimbursement they had to give the EMA.
7538299	7552048	No doubt we'll continue to see scumbag politicians try to pass feel-good legislations restricting game content, but we're probably not going to see yet another case go to the Supreme Court anytime soon, as they tend not to listen to the same issues that often.
7552908	7569555	This case has given us a huge buffer, and while we can't take anything for granted, it's hard to see where we'll see much more than summary dismissals of the sort of poorly written headline-chasing tripe legislation that had defined the previous decade.
7570095	7573897	I'll go so far as to say this will define the next generation as well.
7574837	7589237	um that is a good pick of something that kind of fell off of our radars I'm not gonna deny that that is a very good selection I think one reason that it may be we don't think of it right away compared to some of the other things we talked about last week is because we did kind of dodge a bullet
7589798	7611294	and I think in a lot of our minds yeah this is the way it should be duh you know like oh the whole fact that the Supreme Court decided to say that you know this is a bad idea duh we all knew it was a bad idea so no harm no foul right I think that I mean I'm not belittling the response because I think yeah absolutely this is a decision by the Supreme Court that impacts
7612074	7613516	Gaming, period.
7614157	7621507	But I think that's why a lot of us kind of neglect to remember it because it's kind of like, well, they ended up on our side like they should have been, so la-di-da.
7621868	7623450	Didn't really change anything at the end of the day.
7623750	7624191	Hooray.
7625696	7625897	Anyway.
7627658	7647815	And I always have to give it to Rossdale UT for definitely bringing up points that are definitely apt when it comes to comparing what you see in the current generation of gaming, especially with bringing up how we are on that line from changing sort of how we're thinking about
7648395	7649956	Thank you for watching!
7669729	7683200	I seem to remember in that whole Supreme Court decision thing, I think the Justice knew what Mortal Kombat was because he or she, I don't remember which Justice it was, had interns or people in the office that knew the game and played it a lot.
7683780	7687923	So I just remember that that was... I don't have the story in front of me, so I don't remember the details.
7687963	7690265	I remember that was something out of it that I found fascinating.
7690285	7693047	It's like, hey, the Supreme Court knows Mortal Kombat.
7693147	7694088	It's not just...
7694488	7700571	Dan's old boss named his daughter Melina because his wife wouldn't let him name her Katana.
7701452	7702832	This is corporate boss.
7703513	7705213	I like the name Melina a lot, actually.
7705274	7708335	Not even just because of Mortal Kombat, but... Yeah, I actually met the guy.
7708355	7708795	He's pretty cool.
7709175	7713117	But still, I mean, you know, Robin Williams named his daughter Zelda.
7714218	7714438	True.
7714798	7719101	Yeah, so... Moving on, and sorry, Russell, you too.
7719121	7721922	The rest of the email was just way too long, but I did glance over it.
7723490	7725276	This comes from Nark.
7726474	7730135	Well, I'm... Which was a great 90s arcade game, by the way.
7730175	7733576	But this is with a Q and not with a C. Oh, you're like Joystick.
7734077	7734297	Yeah.
7734317	7735017	The AOL block.
7735557	7745080	Well, I'm weighing in a little late on the matter, but I believe there is an overarching theme that connects the defining game with the defining news for the past generation.
7745120	7746681	That is online everything.
7747581	7751382	Someone mentioned crowdfunding and an ME3 multiplayer.
7753503	7755465	It hasn't been that long since WoW launched.
7755525	7758366	Now there are so many MMOs that once had spins.
7759247	7760728	Although Ragnarok Online was the best of them.
7761288	7764150	And now you have MMOs being funded, produced by the community.
7764591	7771735	Star Citizen doesn't even exist and the players are already pumped for over $25 million already pumped over $25 million into it.
7772196	7775678	And that's not the news story of the generation.
7775778	7780902	And if that's not the news story of the generation I don't know what would be more poignant.
7781642	7788169	So online everything, but if I had to narrow it down, I'd say the world of Warcraft is the defining game of our generation, like the game or not.
7788529	7793394	And even the Star Citizen crowdfunding story is this generation's defining news event.
7793654	7794575	Great topic, game on.
7795456	7795616	Narc.
7797054	7799935	I'm thinking of Pinky from Pinky and the Brain.
7800335	7800955	Instead of Narf.
7801055	7803756	Narf.
7803976	7809738	Here's the one reason I respectfully disagree with your choice of World of Warcraft is because the game came out in 2004.
7809858	7811679	Was it 2003?
7812219	7811679	2004?
7812239	7819221	I think it was 2004 during the last generation because this generation didn't really start until 05-06 depending on if PS3 or 360 kicked it off.
7819321	7820282	So that's my one slight...
7825043	7830686	Dispute with that, but honestly, I'm not invalidating any of your points because the rest of it's all very good.
7830886	7834168	And with the Kickstarter and all that, absolutely.
7835188	7837610	Gene says he's naming his first child Baraka.
7839751	7841352	Which is better, Baraka or Blanca?
7843373	7843873	Food for thought.
7844898	7846699	If you want your kid going around being named White.
7847419	7848319	I don't know.
7848379	7851380	No, with a K. Wasn't that... Yeah, but still.
7852140	7852360	Anyway.
7852961	7853901	Hello, peoples.
7854781	7860183	I'd like to extend my gratitude for Loki for the VOG Grand Theft Auto Online community event that was held tonight, Friday night.
7877541	7880942	DS fucking L. Okay, oh, never mind.
7880962	7881482	I see what he's saying.
7881502	7888924	DS fucking L. My failed attempts to play Grand Theft Auto online with the VOG community has only given me more incentive to achieve my long-held goal.
7889404	7900306	I will accomplish Project Buy a House, and when I do, I will get cable internet, string Cat5 throughout my house, and finally achieve the true broadband gaming dream I have only dreamed of.
7900626	7901166	I will do this.
7901406	7901786	I will.
7902207	7903367	Stay Black Red Entertainment.
7903607	7903947	Trainer.
7905714	7906214	You know what?
7907875	7918740	You also want to look into your router if you're going to do the ultimate Wi-Fi or internet experience.
7919780	7923422	Don't use whatever your provider gives you.
7923802	7931145	It's also partially, I think, Rockstar's fault because I had trouble connecting it some of the times I was getting disconnected from stuff.
7932346	7934567	I blame everything on Rockstar's because they make me too jittery.
7937938	7942981	Anyway, this one, here is an update for OLR.
7943402	7946644	It's been six months since my wife Tracy passed away from a stroke at 47.
7948385	7951407	When I called in, I was being... Oh, I remember this one.
7951627	7951827	Yes.
7951987	7955890	When I called in, I was being evicted from the house I was renting and had to move in with a friend.
7956350	7962635	The sad part is that really happened and I thought I was going to have to get a second job just to survive.
7963055	7964776	I was getting depressed but was surviving.
7965176	7967438	I still listen to the podcast regularly for a smile.
7968178	7971159	I got more from the retirement system she was in than I figured.
7971499	7974720	Being a responsible adult bites, I could have flown to Vegas and partied.
7975360	7978321	I paid off my SUV five years early and now I have no car payment.
7978381	7980322	I paid off the bills left over from the last place.
7980722	7984163	I bought myself a new 55-inch 3D TV.
7984523	7991485	I will be getting an Xbox One when I find one and a new laptop for gaming.
7991825	7992846	Thank you for all your prayers.
7992966	7994206	It looks like I will be okay.
7994326	7996547	I would call in, but I am East Coast and work Monday.
7998792	8000113	I'm happy to hear that follow-up.
8000213	8002295	Those of you that were here six months ago, I'm sure remember.
8002995	8006998	I think in the 12 years that we've been doing OLR, it was the hardest phone call we've ever taken on the show.
8007478	8010300	I'm just going to guess on a nickname that's a name in lights.
8010861	8011901	Yes, I believe that's right.
8012662	8015124	He's a really good guy.
8015144	8017165	We chat on Facebook all the damn time.
8017205	8019267	Yeah, he used to do WoW with us, too.
8020548	8024871	That whole thing, though, was really a testament to the power of community.
8024891	8025731	Yeah.
8026892	8033261	Yeah, I get warm fuzzies hearing that it's going to be okay for him.
8033721	8035924	And I'm glad to hear it's going to be okay.
8036925	8038367	And I'm sure the listeners appreciate it.
8038447	8040991	Even if it's six months later, it's really nice to know.
8041211	8041471	Thank you.
8041491	8042773	Stay in touch.
8044595	8045136	One more email.
8046276	8047377	Howdy, guys and gal.
8047517	8047857	Smile.
8048958	8050739	Yes, thank you for acknowledging my womanhood.
8054222	8056363	Nice tits.
8056623	8057864	I was acknowledging your womanhood.
8058225	8059265	Yes, they are quite nice.
8059325	8060806	I have a gorgeous rack.
8061507	8062708	I get complimented on it daily.
8064048	8068710	Firstly, although we missed you last week, I hope you all had a fantastic week off.
8068871	8070171	I did sleeping, so that was great.
8070251	8072092	I went to Disneyland and BlizzCon.
8072112	8072812	It was amazing.
8074053	8077995	Okay, now that we have the touchy-feely bullshit out of the way... Oh, hey.
8078835	8085784	A couple weeks ago I was watching Under Sedation Live, which you can view and participate live every Saturday night at 10pm EST on VOGnetwork.com.
8086145	8088067	Are you on Travis Donovan's payroll?
8089529	8090110	Who is this?
8091272	8091872	Degenerate Johnny.
8092193	8093575	Are you on Travis' payroll?
8094175	8095577	Did he offer you VOG points?
8096451	8100894	Travis and Jessica were talking about cult movies of the 90s, Boondock Saints, Cutthroat Island, and Hackers.
8102415	8106177	This conversation got me to thinking of cult video games and what makes a cult game.
8106778	8111341	Is a cult game a game that people enjoy despite the low review scores like Too Human?
8111861	8134360	is a cult game, a game that did not have a stellar launch but managed to gain a huge following such as Demon's Souls is a cult game, a game that people like to play despite the low sales numbers such as Bulletstorm and Shadows of the Damned I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this and I'm eager to find out what you consider a cult game I'm also interested in finding out what your favorite cult game is not so sincerely Degenerate Johnny aka Rob's Parody Songwriter
8135612	8137593	Thank you for not bringing that to this show
8161182	8165104	Um, as far as the question on hand, what makes a cult video game?
8165624	8168466	Dishonored Johnny, I think it's kind of all those things that you named.
8168706	8170227	I don't think there's, there's no definition.
8170267	8173508	There's no, you don't go to the dictionary and see like what makes a cult game.
8173528	8174889	I think it's a little bit of all those things.
8175129	8176870	And I think the definition is a little different for everybody.
8177150	8202679	well that and also when you have I think you should also look at the factor of well this is more like hipster game I would think when you have people outside of an age group the game is intended for playing the game like I hate to say it Pokemon Pokemon oh Pokemon's totally a cult game but see but but does that label really fit when Pokemon is like a hugely selling game but I
8202799	8204640	See, that's why I relabeled it a hipster game.
8204660	8206561	There's definitely a cult of Pokemon.
8206841	8209382	I was going to say one of the biggest cult games there is is World of Warcraft.
8209882	8210122	Yeah.
8210262	8211623	But now it's doing well.
8211663	8214084	Yeah, it's such a huge game.
8214124	8214844	I don't know.
8214864	8216945	I feel weird calling that a cult game, too.
8217145	8225248	This is how I look at it, too, is maybe when you have something's popularity emerge after it was supposed to have its heyday.
8225588	8227129	For example, look at Rocky.
8228493	8229434	Rocky Horror Picture Show
8257031	8258753	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8274548	8274868	LeoTarded
8297413	8297994	LeoTarded?
8298054	8298595	LeoTarded.
8298615	8299095	LeoTarded.
8299115	8300237	That's what they say on Drag Race.
8300297	8301178	Totally LeoTarded.
8301378	8309247	But I hate using that word because I do know people who... Anyway, sorry.
8309888	8313713	Oh yeah, and if you want to go for, like Jean just said, shock treatment, Ultra Cult.
8314887	8316007	Oh my god, Shock Treatment.
8316328	8317288	Shock Treatment's fucking hilarious.
8317308	8320149	You have to watch Shock Treatment like seven times before it even makes sense.
8320229	8322410	But the music is really good.
8322830	8325411	I need a bit of, ooh, Shock Treatment.
8326532	8329553	You remember when we ate the hacker cookies when Evan lived with Jessica?
8330553	8335295	And these were cookies that were made with so much chocolate and no doughs that I was shaking after two of them.
8335835	8338916	I remember when I got really sick in 2008.
8339356	8344077	I was actually supposed to be in a shadow cast of Shock Treatment playing Ricky from the Rest Home.
8344497	8349619	I had to drop out because that was the year I got really sick and I had to go to the hospital, so somebody replaced me.
8350619	8355260	Well, SSJ100Mad is saying that Darkstalkers is a cult franchise.
8355280	8356741	Kind of.
8358658	8359419	Yeah, kinda.
8359479	8364443	It wasn't as overly successful as most of Capcom's other things, but see, it was always in the circles.
8365043	8368586	I lived in arcades with fighting games, so they always had people on it.
8369107	8374972	I think a cult game is that game that everybody asks for a sequel for that you're never gonna get.
8375492	8378134	Like Shenmue is a great example of a cult game.
8378154	8378815	Like Half-Life?
8380496	8383199	Half-Life, by that definition, is definitely a cult game.
8383579	8386942	Or I was gonna joke, Mega Man is now a cult game as of recent...
8387242	8394025	You know what a good example, though, of the... I think Blaster Master is a great example of a cult game.
8394425	8398487	Yes, it got some sequels, but they were worse than Shock Treatment, let's be real.
8399228	8401069	That's hard to be worse unless you're Yaris.
8401689	8403630	What if Yaris got a sequel?
8403670	8407472	The Wii remake wasn't awful, but that's not saying much.
8408512	8413036	I'll give you another example of a great cult game because I don't think people know this one very well.
8413116	8413736	Cold Sept.
8414017	8415318	I've talked about this on the game before.
8415798	8418420	It's that whole like Magic the Gathering meets Monopoly.
8418660	8423004	I love that game but there's like one on the 360 and on the PlayStation 2 and that's really it.
8423024	8423904	I think it's bigger in Japan.
8423924	8427947	We've just had a few really good points in the chat.
8428668	8437415	Ranma brings up rival schools being more than Darkstalkers which I fully agree with and I fucking love rival schools and the people who love rival schools really fucking love rival schools.
8438195	8452324	and Gene says PSO2 in the US which I was totally into PSO2 for a little while and then there's Final Fantasy and Queen Simia says any Bimani game which in America, yes, I would say.
8453745	8480840	DDR got super super popular and now it's fallen into because of the cult status the imports had over here now it's more in the mainstream but as far as I was aware in Japan poppin music is everywhere and everyone fucking plays poppin music I love this Technus says those Burger King games Sneak King was a cult game of sorts or fuck everyone I knew that played Ragnarok Online
8481874	8482094	Yeah.
8482214	8484495	Because that game was like, oh, we have 3D games.
8484575	8485316	No, fuck you.
8485336	8487377	We're playing our 2D little MMO.
8487857	8490758	SS2100 Matt says, so Chrono Trigger would be considered cult.
8491158	8492439	No, because you got Chrono Cross.
8493580	8494160	I'm just trolling.
8494480	8495741	Chrono Trigger was pretty popular.
8496201	8497181	It is a cult game of sorts.
8497221	8498522	Ragenator says Earthbound.
8500131	8501112	Kind of, yeah.
8501752	8504893	Kid Icarus for a long time I would definitely call a cult game.
8504933	8506174	In fact, in some ways it still is.
8506294	8509936	Oom Jamalami being a sequel, I would not consider that one a cult.
8512297	8512957	Pig bumpin'.
8514498	8515118	We had that.
8515858	8517439	I will agree with Skullgirls
8531989	8550758	because that game is pretty fun but it wasn't getting a whole lot of attention just but you have your dedicated fan base to it and because of that we've had the Kickstarter go in a lot more of that too so yeah Skullgirls is a pretty recent one or maybe even La Mulana you know
8551897	8555318	La Mulana is definitely a cult game if your name is Dark Tetsuya.
8555398	8556099	Cave Story.
8556819	8557699	Ooh, that's a good one, too.
8557739	8558239	Cave Story.
8558780	8560920	Anyway, this is a great topic, but we are dragging it out.
8560940	8562101	Yeah, it's time to move it on.
8562201	8562501	Yes.
8563221	8565022	This would be a good topic for a list list or something someday.
8565042	8565862	But great question.
8565982	8566262	Love it.
8566743	8566963	Yeah.
8567903	8572985	And we definitely sort of discussed a little bit of what defines a cult game.
8573245	8577267	And Travis will now be able to say, yet again, they jacked another segment for my show.
8577767	8578687	And you know what I say?
8579588	8580688	Nothing, because it's a gesture.
8586427	8588568	And just remember that saying, love you.
8588688	8590109	Just a really strong love you.
8590790	8591090	Love it.
8591831	8593392	It's a very deep kind of love.
8594933	8596874	It's a very thrusty, deep kind of love.
8597054	8597454	All right.
8598575	8604299	Speaking of thrusty, deep kind of love, thank you to all you guys that emailed us tonight and those of you that will email next week in advance.
8604359	8608902	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails.
8609362	8613165	Well, right along with that gesture, we'll cue a new segment.
8613305	8614125	Or not a new segment.
8614145	8614746	A new segment?
8615206	8616188	We need a new segment.
8628697	8629438	Tweet us ideas.
8630418	8631399	We'll crowdsource this.
8631659	8632760	The OLR shit list.
8633700	8635482	Tweet us your new OLR segments.
8635522	8636382	New OLR segment.
8636682	8638043	Tweet us your ideas.
8638063	8640205	And I'm not bringing you back website of the week.
8640305	8645188	But if we get a new segment, then an old segment's gotta go.
8645468	8645688	No.
8646489	8647710	We'll just live here forever.
8647750	8648690	We'll just do a four hour show?
8648730	8650792	I'm just gonna live under your table here, Rob.
8651032	8652953	And eventually Sanrio will like me.
8653994	8655435	Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.
8671516	8673897	Fuck you to me not having a job yet.
8675298	8681801	And I'm still waiting back to hear from Cool Job as I've been referring to it in writing Cool Job with a trademark.
8684662	8688164	It's really just very difficult to find work.
8688544	8695447	And Dan and I are actually going to be going out looking at houses next week because we feel we're wasting money on rent.
8696487	8704350	and trying to, you know, it's really hard to improve your situation when you are not given the means to improve your situation.
8704770	8708972	And all those people who are bootstrap theorists, fuck you very much.
8709812	8710192	Fuck you.
8711773	8712113	Loki?
8713353	8715954	Fuck you to Cookie Clicker.
8716074	8716674	I agree.
8716754	8717755	Fuck you to Cookie Clicker.
8717775	8719375	Do you have a permanent dent in your finger now?
8720316	8721056	No, but I'm almost done.
8723036	8724177	Seriously, I'm almost done.
8725851	8727532	Cthulhu has somehow arisen.
8727652	8732014	I don't know how this has happened, but it's part of the game, I guess.
8732295	8733955	Loki's in the devil.
8734896	8735716	Ranma's turned evil.
8736637	8739378	Have to do an ancient pact to stop them from being evil.
8742100	8742640	And I'm cheating.
8743020	8743381	A lot.
8743421	8744321	Of course you're cheating.
8744441	8745762	This is Loki we're talking about.
8745802	8747303	Hey, it's to get done with the game.
8747423	8748743	It's all about the endgame, you know?
8748824	8749124	Yeah.
8750004	8751866	Alright, my FU of the week.
8753007	8754389	I guess I don't have a lot I'm mad at.
8754509	8756991	My FU of the week goes to these holiday candies.
8759433	8762016	Alan says they're grandma candy, and they totally are.
8762036	8768863	It's like the holiday mix of those hard candies that grandma always had in a glass jar at her house.
8769043	8770184	Like the Werther's Originals?
8770592	8771933	I wanna be a princess I'm thinking really hard
8800140	8801581	It's not working, DarkSakura.
8801662	8802663	I'm taking this home.
8805185	8806366	Are you confiscating it?
8806947	8807687	It looks nasty.
8808148	8809149	It's really good, though.
8811813	8815015	It's just that candy pink in it, you know?
8815075	8818057	Codeman in chat says, so I come to your house, you will offer me candy?
8818238	8818618	Absolutely.
8818658	8823721	If you're going to make the trip out here from Oklahoma or wherever you are, I will absolutely get you candy.
8824142	8826283	He only uses it to get people in his car, not his car.
8827064	8827584	In the van.
8827904	8829425	You don't have a van yet.
8830346	8831267	That's what you think.
8831727	8832287	Yeah, but...
8833328	8834849	That's the perfect alibi right there, too.
8836210	8839512	All right, that does it for the FUs of the week.
8839592	8843734	Let's get to some more stories, and then we are not that far away from the Skype line.
8843794	8845715	Excited to talk to some folks tonight.
8845935	8847797	I hope we get calls tonight.
8847817	8851439	1-877-GAME-OLR, or I usually am on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8851479	8852860	But first, a couple stories for you.
8853060	8858403	Sadly, we missed a wonderful transition that we would have had had we gone into the story straight from the mailbag, but, you know, whatever.
8859823	8882030	so hey in case you need some more information about which system you should buy for the next generation Pornhub would let you know that hey they're fully supporting the Playstation 4 and you'll be able to view Pornhub and all of it's video content through the Playstation 4's web browser nice
8884011	8884912	So that's why I was joking.
8906406	8909687	It's, you know, it's strange, but let's see.
8909707	8911667	Dinosaur.
8911687	8914208	Hey, that's weird that that came up as a recommended.
8914268	8915928	Yes, it has dinosaur porn on there.
8915988	8916328	Yes.
8916749	8918249	So you were all set.
8918729	8920670	Dinosaurs, like the old ABC sitcom?
8920890	8923170	Dinosaurs as in like CG dinosaurs.
8927491	8928652	And someone that's dressed in green.
8928692	8929072	I don't know.
8930272	8932753	But yes, they do have dinosaur pornography.
8933393	8934413	You'll be happy to know.
8935581	8935921	All right.
8936142	8938944	Anyway, very happy to hear that.
8938984	8943547	Congratulations, PlayStation 4, for definitively winning the console wars with that.
8943987	8949191	Although, we all know if there's any way to do it, Pornhub will also show up on Xbox One.
8949231	8950132	Of course.
8950472	8951973	Well, it is Internet Explorer.
8952033	8952834	It'll have to happen.
8953234	8953874	But here's the thing.
8954315	8961939	If you really want to win the console wars, you just bring triple X rated video to the actual web stores.
8962039	8972485	I can go rent a copy of The Dark Knight Returns or The Dark Knight Bonesome Chicken the Ass 2.
8973566	8975587	That's how you win the console wars right there.
8978209	8983252	Alright, speaking of vulgarities, did you know that South Park's still on the air?
8983312	8984313	It's in its 17th season.
8985454	8992058	And you know, South Park's kind of hit and miss these days, but it's still worth watching once in a while, especially this past week.
8992458	8993819	And I actually watched this episode.
8993839	9000964	A friend of mine alerted me to the fact that the latest South Park episode was about the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One console wars.
9001264	9003926	They kind of put a Game of Thrones parody into it, too.
9004266	9006488	It also looks very much like their game.
9007449	9023910	it does look like their game which made it funny because there was a part where they totally shade the fact that their game got delayed like something about like they just someone says who wants to sit around and wait for a stupid game a game that's not even that good oh then they slam the pre-order thing that's what it was they say like
9025294	9028675	Pre-orders are just the way of them dicking you over every time.
9028695	9035538	The $5 you spend on a pre-order is just going to some guy who hasn't even finished the game yet.
9035578	9036378	That was the part.
9036418	9037819	I'm totally not doing it justice.
9037859	9039920	Sorry, I don't have it queued up right now.
9040840	9041761	Thanks for watching!
9056790	9065439	Yes, they actually split up and choose a side, and it's going to be PlayStation 4 fans versus Xbox One fans in an epic throwdown at the mall.
9065499	9067921	And they're actually recruiting other cliques for their side.
9068421	9073767	I think the Sony clique had Kyle in it, and they recruited the goth kids.
9074307	9077689	DarkTetsuya in our chatroom says they did confirm on Facebook part 2 is this coming week.
9104978	9106480	So there will be a part two.
9106600	9107842	So check that out.
9107962	9110224	Gene asks, was Wii U ignored?
9110825	9111206	Of course.
9111386	9112287	Of course it was ignored.
9113188	9114790	Just like real life.
9114850	9116312	This is next gen wars.
9117914	9122519	Well, maybe that'll be the twist in the second part is that they all come together and buy Wii U's.
9123960	9124420	I doubt it.
9124861	9125761	I highly doubt it.
9126061	9126821	I don't think so.
9127821	9128142	Alright.
9129982	9131082	That's it for stories.
9131283	9133863	So I think we can open up the Skype line now.
9133883	9136744	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
9136764	9140345	If you'd like to give us a call on Skype, the Skype line is open.
9141246	9142166	And in the meantime...
9143610	9145612	We can go to some Twitter topics.
9145652	9147033	I know we had a few good ones tonight.
9147674	9148795	Also, last-minute stories.
9148895	9150896	Loki, I don't know if you had any last-minute stories you wanted to get out?
9151597	9151877	No.
9152237	9152478	No?
9152498	9156461	Well, I was going to mention that there's this teaser site now.
9156721	9162046	It's the Survivor 2299 that people are thinking might be for Fallout.
9162746	9168328	Originally, it was thought, oh, maybe it's a fan site because it wasn't registered to the usual Bethesda stuff.
9168688	9172670	However, Bethesda just recently trademarked Fallout 4.
9174250	9178872	And also, the timing kind of coincides with the Spike VGX.
9179472	9180173	Oh, lordy.
9180613	9181213	Oh, lordy.
9181233	9183614	So, expect an announcement maybe in December?
9183834	9184754	Yeah, most likely.
9184954	9185675	Let's go to the phones.
9185695	9186575	They're lighting up now.
9186595	9188095	We shouldn't have a problem with calls tonight.
9188155	9189056	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
9189076	9189356	Who's this?
9190199	9191100	This is Codeman.
9216753	9217954	Have you seen the Batman ones?
9218034	9220175	I have not seen the Batman ones.
9220795	9227518	They do it sort of the old Adam West style Batman, but it's with the actual characters from now.
9227558	9230019	I think the last one I saw was a parody of Lord of the Rings.
9230719	9232200	It literally had a bunch of midgets.
9232420	9235201	I remember when you invited me over to see Ally McFeel.
9236602	9237342	It was great.
9237382	9238903	Ron Jeremy was actually in that.
9239383	9241884	And for the record, the last one I watched was the Mork and Mindy one.
9244360	9247904	I wanted to see the one that was called This Ain't Glee.
9248604	9250486	Because now they don't even bother.
9250527	9252188	They just say, this ain't whatever.
9253089	9255492	Oh, wait, I did see another one more recent.
9255552	9258215	I saw Nalin Palin, which is hilarious.
9259116	9262777	I know you must have seen Not The Cosbys because we were so fascinated.
9262837	9264317	We were so fascinated about the guy.
9265677	9273079	The guy that played Bill Cosby in there, he never got into any of the scenes, but his impression was fantastic.
9273479	9276059	And that was the part that was more like, we don't give a shit about the porn.
9276279	9278220	His impression was just dead on.
9278280	9278980	It was hilarious.
9279220	9283241	Code Man, I don't know if you actually called to talk about porn, but clearly we could do that all night.
9283281	9284281	But what's on your mind, buddy?
9284861	9286662	It's all Porn Orange Lounge Radio tonight.
9286682	9288964	Porn Orange Lounge Radio!
9288984	9290124	Porn Orange Lounge Radio.
9290985	9293266	No, I haven't called in a while, actually.
9294147	9297589	I've been pretty busy with life, I guess you could say.
9297649	9302452	But no, I just figured I was up tonight and figured I'd call in and just talk.
9302692	9303692	PS4, because I...
9305193	9306934	I canceled my pre-order like you did, Rob.
9307974	9309034	I'm glad I'm not alone.
9310174	9316336	Would you give out your Twitter on the show so that the people that are about to send me angry tweets after tonight's episode can send them to you too?
9316356	9317856	Yeah, it's Codeman Games.
9318236	9319177	Look it up.
9320697	9323978	But I will tell you, Extifer...
9325074	9331198	I've been keeping up with his, like, he posted, I think, a Resogun on Facebook.
9331378	9337341	And I'm just like, I'm seeing all these videos and I'm like, God, I should have kept it.
9338022	9339803	That's the exact same thing I've been doing.
9339903	9341544	And it's, you know what that means?
9341764	9346487	All that social media shit that Sony infused into its console is working.
9346687	9348668	This is exactly what they want people to do.
9349048	9350770	I heard, actually, for me, it was the opposite.
9350790	9353692	I was like, ah, another video of the stupid robots.
9353712	9355493	It's like, I've already seen that.
9355553	9356574	I know what it looks like.
9357435	9366943	Well, it's just, it's, you know, you see all this stuff, and you cancel it because you know, okay, well, I kind of go with the same thing as, you know, a console is good as what, you know, games are on them.
9367323	9372668	But, like, then you see all these people playing it, and you just get this feeling of, like, God, I need this because it's new.
9373088	9373769	It's different.
9375990	9403506	in a sense and so you get to this point where you're like oh my god I just need this console but you know you have other things to do and you can't spend that much money on something but you're just like oh my god I need it but at the time I had the money and I was like okay well I have the pre-order I'm going to get it and all this stuff and I got to the point where I was just like you know what there's just no games that are selling this system for me right now about the only thing that was selling was the Resogun and then like I wanted to check out
9405027	9412130	and... What was the... What was the little... With the little guys and the... The Playroom?
9412710	9413930	No, not the Playroom.
9414250	9416811	It starts with a K. I can't even think... Knack.
9417131	9417451	Knack.
9417571	9417911	There you go.
9418932	9421873	I wanted to play Knack because I played a demo of it at Target and I thought it was kind of fun.
9422273	9425154	I've heard it's kind of repetitive, but at the same time, I don't really care.
9425194	9427295	I mean, it looked... It felt fun when I played it.
9427455	9431196	And the controller just felt so amazing when I played it.
9431596	9433677	So I was just like, oh my god, I should have got one of these.
9433797	9433997	But...
9434557	9436159	I do have to make a confession.
9436920	9442187	I did sell my Xbox 360 and some games and got like $300 something for it.
9442207	9442267	So...
9446463	9450304	That will be going towards the PS4, so I probably will be getting one.
9450684	9451785	Out with the old and in with the new.
9451965	9455186	I've got some extra systems in my office that I'm not using.
9455226	9456766	I might as well just take those in.
9456786	9457747	There you go, right?
9458287	9467570	You know, I'm not a big advocate of the Evil G, but today they had a 90% trade-in value on consoles, so I was just like, why not?
9468750	9496843	Oh dang, I wish I'd known that I might have done that Because Alan and I actually have two Because, you know, when we got together and moved in together We both had 360s and Playstation 3s So we have two Playstation 3s and two Xbox 360s And there's really no reason for us to do that So we really should sell my systems Because they're the older ones And keep Alan's But, oh well, maybe they'll do something like that again Although, yes, I'm with you I really don't like the Evil G But if they're willing to give me a lot of money I can cross picket lines
9496943	9499544	We've got extra systems lying around.
9500184	9500565	Why not?
9500725	9501105	Why not?
9502165	9511629	And also, lastly, before I go, I wanted to tell you guys about a game I've been playing that I think kind of fell under the radar a little bit because I don't think really a lot of people play this game anymore.
9511689	9512249	But maybe they do.
9512290	9512610	I don't know.
9512930	9515251	But the Ratchet & Clank, the new Ratchet & Clank game that just came out.
9515411	9515591	Yeah.
9516171	9543202	um it's like super fun it's the first like full length type I guess Ratchet and Clank that they released because they released like the all for one which is like the multiplayer which kind of wasn't that good and then they released um Full Frontal Assault which was the like it was like a tower defense Ratchet and Clank but this one that they just released into the Nexus was fantastic and I'm playing it right now and I actually with the game got a um
9544202	9556942	a code for a downloadable game for the Quest for Booty game which was like the first downloadable game that they released or whatever and I'm willing to give it to somebody in chat if they want it because I already own it
9559008	9582082	but I have a free code here so if anybody in chat likes the Ratchet and Clank games and they don't own this game it's really fun it was a full length downloadable Ratchet and Clank game it's all like pirate themed and stuff so if you anybody the first person to direct message me in chat maybe I want it I wish you told me I want it no it's fine give it to a listener
9582682	9583382	Do you want it, Rob?
9600791	9601051	DarkSakura,
9618101	9622164	We're some Japanese porn we watch.
9622324	9627408	And for the record, all Final Fuck Xs is really good cosplay with fucking.
9627628	9633812	Yeah, I remember because I was looking for Dance Dance Revolution stuff, like games on eBay, and I'm like, hey, what's this?
9634373	9635193	I gotta buy that.
9635213	9640317	Which, Dance Dance Fuck has nothing to do with the games, which was hilarious.
9640977	9641198	Anyway.
9641898	9645564	I'm just gonna have to channel my inner Shane on this one and go, I don't care.
9645864	9646205	Alright.
9647466	9647927	Well said.
9648007	9648788	Alright, take care, buddy.
9650707	9651969	All right, Rob, everybody.
9652169	9652830	Thanks for the call.
9653490	9654371	I will talk to you all later.
9654391	9654932	All right, take care.
9655152	9655412	Bye.
9655693	9656093	All right, bye.
9656914	9657675	All right, that was a good call.
9657695	9661599	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9662099	9664462	I want to do some quick Twitter topics while we wait for another call.
9665223	9670448	Tiger Claw tweets us and says, Mortal Kombat producer Hector Sanchez leaves NetherRealm Studios.
9670468	9670789	That's right.
9670809	9672911	I did see this coming out today.
9673311	9673772	It's a Kirby!
9702165	9708847	Yeah, it's the screen of my Wii U. It's actually a video of it.
9709108	9709908	Oh, it's live video.
9709928	9711669	Oh, no wonder I hear myself echoing a little bit.
9711769	9712049	Okay.
9712169	9713289	Oh, yeah, I can see the pixels.
9714049	9714730	Oh, there it goes.
9715370	9715790	All right.
9716110	9716790	It is live video.
9717371	9717751	Nice.
9718011	9718411	Love that.
9718631	9719431	I like your Kirby.
9720152	9721832	Even though I'm hearing myself echo, but that's okay.
9721852	9722673	Well, what's on your mind, buddy?
9723993	9727714	Well, basically... Sorry.
9728375	9731756	I was going to talk about... Or I'm going to talk about... Basically...
9732941	9738792	Or ask you, why do people still say that Nintendo is gonna be in ruins?
9741034	9745355	Um, I don't know, Loki, why do people say Nintendo's going to be in ruins?
9745376	9747516	Because doom and gloom, doom and gloom.
9747796	9756159	It's just because, you know, the Wii U's not selling well, and so they assume that because the Wii U's not selling well that Nintendo doesn't have anything else that they're selling that's not doing well.
9757259	9761061	Except, you know, they have this thing called the 3DS that seems to sell like crazy.
9761641	9764982	So, I don't know, I don't think they're in ruins, but as far as getting...
9765582	9771004	The platform of Wii U, that's not doing so hot.
9772044	9772685	That's about it.
9773445	9778026	And actually, I mean, right now they don't really have any EA games at all.
9778487	9780347	And there's nothing on the slate for next year.
9781688	9782388	So that's going to hurt.
9782708	9790814	Well, to paraphrase something that someone very aptly put on the tumblers, the Virtual Boy didn't tank it.
9791435	9793376	The Micro didn't tank it.
9793476	9795958	The 64DD didn't tank it.
9797539	9797779	So...
9798860	9803181	They're just not going to recapture what happened with the Wii.
9803241	9805502	I think the Wii set the bar so high.
9805882	9808903	It was such a successful console that expectations are very high.
9810264	9812845	Is the Wii U going to win this generation?
9813325	9815526	Not likely, but never say never.
9816886	9830680	I think we also have to remember in the last generation, PlayStation 3 didn't come out the gate too hot And PlayStation 3 took a while to turn around PlayStation 3 took a good two years And when did LittleBigPlanet come out?
9830700	9834504	Because that's when things really started turning around for PlayStation 3 That was almost two years into it, right?
9835625	9838028	I think it was 2007, so it was a year after it came out
9838348	9840150	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9859825	9886850	um this time I don't think it's gonna be I think Nintendo may actually be the one that lags behind a little bit but we'll see Xbox One's out next week we gotta see where things are at six months out we'll see I I but it's not over for Nintendo 3DS will always keep them afloat and whatever else you know they've got up their sleeve there'll be a Zelda game on Wii U next year it's gonna sell systems along with Super Smash Brothers just just wait
9887230	9889171	But what about you, Actdeft?
9889191	9893893	You just bought a Wii U. So what finally made you decide to take the plunge?
9895473	9899775	Basically, first of all, Super Mario 3D World.
9902036	9908338	Seeing the videos over and over again, it looks like it's going to be a pretty fun game to play.
9909879	9914761	And I really wanted to play it as soon as it comes out.
9915754	9917615	So I pretty much wanted that.
9917675	9922899	And also, I talked this with Bobby, Rayman Legends.
9924020	9933107	Even though it's a multi-platform game, I still want it on the Wii U. And it's even on sale right now on Steam for $20.
9933227	9939532	And I'm like, I want to purchase that, but now that I have the Wii U, I really...
9940532	9963213	I want to get it for this console and so yeah basically those are my two main reasons right now to get one and even then and something that you said on the beginning of the show it's like pretty much right now Wii U has the games has at least a more sorry
9963959	9972239	More games to play right now since it has the year since it launched.
9974803	9988547	and it already has a big library so it doesn't have that many games maybe to play but at least you have more of a selection right now than the PS4 or even the Xbox One.
9989167	10001211	Even though there's not a lot of games on Wii U, there's still at least some really great A-list titles on it that help keep the system afloat which I'm not sure PlayStation 4 or Xbox One has as much of right now anyway.
10001671	10001771	So...
10002711	10002951	All right.
10003171	10006054	Well, Actdeft, thanks so much for the call and enjoy your new Wii U. Have fun.
10006994	10007274	Thanks.
10007495	10007715	All right.
10007735	10008115	You're welcome.
10008155	10008615	Take care, buddy.
10008635	10009056	Have a good night.
10009856	10011458	See ya.
10011638	10011978	See ya.
10011998	10015581	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.
10016361	10020324	And we will... Oh, guess what?
10020844	10025348	Nobody sent Code Man a direct message for that code, so he ended up giving it to me anyway.
10025788	10027169	Ha ha, suckers.
10027750	10028010	All right.
10030152	10031193	Let's go to the phones one more time.
10031213	10034816	Hopefully, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10035256	10037538	While we wait for a call to come in, Twitter.
10037598	10039880	Oh, there's a call's coming in right now, so let's go to it.
10040521	10041422	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10041442	10041762	Who's this?
10042502	10043583	It's Legend of Zaku here.
10043683	10044744	Hey, Zaku buddy.
10044784	10045325	How you doing?
10046146	10046966	Long time no see.
10047066	10047647	That's right.
10047687	10048127	What's new?
10049468	10052592	Nothing much, just shuffling between Battlefield 4 and GTA 5.
10052632	10052892	That's my PJs.
10052912	10053753	Those are my PJs.
10069758	10071339	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10089687	10097050	But that's all I can say about it, other than it looks pretty short than the one for Battlefield 3.
10098331	10106154	But I'm hearing a lot of great things about online, except of course when you have people crashing the servers maliciously.
10106754	10107935	Yeah, I heard about that.
10107975	10108695	What's up with that?
10111116	10115078	Did the DDoS attacks go against Battlefield 4 today or something?
10115998	10127124	Apparently, from what I'm hearing, when I'm glancing through Kotaku right now, yeah, they were basically getting hammered by Denalo Service.
10127144	10128485	Yeah, they were getting DDOS'd.
10131108	10143451	I guess now that the PS4 is out, this kind of opens the floodgates in that since most of the PS4 games will have dedicated servers, whether or not that will actually translate over to consoles.
10144271	10156193	Assuming one can just slyly sniff outgoing packets, outgoing network packets to see if they can find an IP to exploit.
10157210	10158331	I mean, that's one way to do it.
10158371	10168398	You just snip the traffic in between the private dedicated servers and the console, and you might be able to get some info, assuming it's not encrypted.
10169259	10171881	But if it is, then they're still a bit lucky.
10173505	10176607	I'm assuming you did not jump on the PlayStation 4 bandwagon, did you?
10176927	10177687	Not yet.
10177767	10180248	I still have a PS3 to go over.
10180588	10184049	As I said, I still have GTA 5 that I played yesterday, last night.
10185130	10186410	And I've been juggling Battlefield 4.
10186710	10190312	So those are the two gaming things going on right now.
10190732	10195855	So you're sitting out this new consoles for a little bit too.
10195875	10197316	You're not planning on Xbox One either?
10198156	10198737	Not yet.
10198837	10203900	As I said, I'd rather give it at least a couple of years or until the prices start dropping.
10204850	10208291	I mean, I got my Xbox two years after it came out.
10208791	10215893	That was the first 360, and then after that I had, you know, that one crapped out and then I bought another.
10215993	10222615	But yeah, it was, I waited at least two years before buying that current generation of console.
10223256	10226757	And PS3 I got last year, so, yeah.
10227977	10245683	Still juggling, but it's not really good to be an early adopter in this stage, especially for a new generation of consoles, because you're pretty much dealt with what you have already and not what improvements Sony or Microsoft will make on their hardware.
10246832	10253183	So rather than having to deal with that aftermath initially, I'd rather just see how they flesh it out.
10253283	10256428	But you can be the cool kid on the block with your cool new toy.
10256588	10257930	You're the coolest kid in school.
10259173	10280163	Sure, that is true, but I know it's $400 that I could put to good use, you know, like buying myself a new video card or basically getting two terabyte hard drives so I could set up on rate so I could put all my Steam games and get a lot more of them so I don't max out my current drive.
10280723	10306934	stuff like that like putting stuff on my PC as opposed to the PS3 which I still invest but it's not as urgent as something that's almost like reaching two years old and I still need to get a new video card for it but other than that I mean it's not like my redheaded stepchild called the 360 which I barely put anything except for an Xbox Live membership earlier this year and that's it
10308934	10310654	Of course, it's Frostbite.
10338520	10342524	and you could actually do countering knife attacks.
10343825	10344726	I don't hate shooters.
10344786	10346628	I'm so bad at them, Zaku.
10346788	10348750	I am so, so bad.
10348770	10349911	Do you want to play with a scrub?
10350371	10350851	Do you want to?
10350891	10354955	Because I will lower your team's collective performance.
10355616	10356156	Not even that.
10356196	10358759	I barely see VOG Network on GTA Online.
10359339	10360040	What's up with that?
10360080	10361781	I'll see Vinny on the PS3.
10363072	10364093	I'm on all the time.
10364613	10367334	Except I'm on two different systems.
10367715	10370076	Can't you hit me up on a social club?
10370556	10372137	Don't they have messaging systems?
10372177	10372477	Do they?
10372697	10374318	I have it through my phone now.
10375199	10378861	Because I'm not doing my best to dodge, chop.
10379181	10381222	I put messages on there.
10381262	10384064	Are you friended on PlayStation Network with me?
10384904	10385624	That's a good start.
10385644	10386865	It's there.
10386885	10389006	My profile should have my PSN ID.
10389887	10391668	I'll even post it up right now after this call.
10393384	10400821	but yeah hopefully OLR can get a VOG Network like Groupon Origin for Battlefield
10402012	10431007	3 and or 4 yeah see that requires me to install Origin it's not that bad oh my god I basically bit the bullet and did that for Battlefield 3 and nothing went wrong alright alright Zaku I gotta wrap up we're running long and this Origin debate is going to take up a whole other show alright have a good one buddy thanks for the call take care bye I love it when we get the webcam calls it's always good to be able to see our people I should probably put a webcam on the computer just for Skype
10431847	10434209	So that way when they call in they can actually see.
10434230	10437773	I can bring back the one I've been using for my drawing streams.
10437833	10439374	It's more incentive for people to call too.
10439495	10446421	Microsoft would like to let you know that you can get your free Skype camera with the purchase of an Xbox One in the form of a Kinect.
10447262	10448283	Alright, I am so sorry.
10448363	10449664	The phones are still lighting up.
10449744	10451465	I've got to wrap up because we're running long.
10451485	10453607	We're 15 minutes past midnight on the East Coast.
10453667	10456489	I still have some Twitter topics, so one of these is a really good question I want to get to.
10456869	10461993	So please, please tweet, email, and we'll get to you guys in a later week, hopefully.
10463293	10465634	I want to get this tweet from Actdeft who sent us a tweet.
10466234	10468235	This is something I totally missed from the Nintendo Direct.
10468255	10468855	I'm so sorry.
10469195	10470395	How could I forget Kirby?
10470655	10471855	How very dare I?
10472456	10474096	I'm mad at myself, y'all.
10474156	10480718	Kirby Triple Deluxe will be coming out in Japan on January 11th and there's a teaser site for that.
10481258	10482638	Kirby Triple Deluxe.
10483078	10483378	Get it?
10483639	10485299	Kirby 3D?
10486879	10487179	Get it?
10487860	10489240	Oh my gosh.
10490166	10490386	Dreamcast
10509062	10512445	The problem is they're still not over, so it's still going.
10512706	10513486	It's still going?
10513767	10514047	Yeah.
10514547	10514928	Alright.
10516229	10517390	Define when.
10517610	10518711	Do you mean by sales?
10518751	10521434	Do you mean by units specifically sold?
10521474	10522976	Do you mean by what country?
10523016	10525658	Do you mean by Gallup poll?
10525738	10526119	I don't know.
10526239	10528000	I think the question's vague on purpose.
10528681	10529362	It's his opinion.
10529442	10531544	In your opinion, who won?
10532805	10532985	My 3DS.
10535626	10537607	The 3DS won the last console.
10537767	10539407	I think that's a perfectly valid answer.
10539427	10541408	See, that's a console, not a handheld.
10541768	10542468	Ah, all right.
10542488	10542848	Sorry.
10542929	10543869	You know what I think won?
10544049	10544729	My computer.
10544949	10545289	The end.
10545389	10545809	The PCs.
10545829	10547870	The PC won.
10547890	10548790	The PCs won.
10549771	10550091	You know what?
10550111	10550971	There's a lot of people.
10551631	10553512	There would be a lot of people in that camp.
10553532	10555192	Clearly a home run with the Ouya.
10555212	10557413	I mean, the Ouya won the last gen console wars.
10557433	10559614	There's just no doubt about it that, you know, they're...
10560594	10562116	No, no.
10562716	10563497	Loki, who won?
10563957	10564398	Who won?
10565379	10568601	Probably Xbox, just because they had a lot of units out there.
10569422	10572445	They still have the strongest support, I think, from all third parties.
10573145	10576128	I mean, it's still going strong.
10576729	10578350	The Wii's gone.
10578730	10584916	I mean, the support from Wii's gone, and now it's Wii U. So they're in their own gen, I guess.
10585236	10586037	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10604674	10608858	I think for me, if you're going by sales specifically, Nintendo won.
10608958	10613963	Clearly, whether you like it or not, love or hate what they brought to the table, just speaking by the numbers.
10614003	10615564	And no, that's not me being a fanboy.
10616085	10619568	But, I mean, Wii Sports is the biggest video game of all time, period.
10619588	10620288	You can't dispute that.
10620428	10621409	I vote for the Neo Geo.
10622230	10629098	But the answer that was in my head was actually something Bobby said in chat here, who said, who won?
10629379	10629939	The gamers.
10630480	10631261	Absolutely believe it.
10631321	10632843	The gamers won The Last Generation.
10633684	10638850	There's a lot of choice available out there now and more ways to connect with each other.
10639250	10641813	And our voices are really having an impact.
10642674	10643915	For better or for worse.
10646356	10648397	And so, yeah, I think the gamers won.
10648557	10649057	Absolutely.
10649417	10652959	If I had to pick a company, though, Netflix won.
10653659	10654240	Big time.
10654680	10656341	Netflix won The Last Generation.
10656701	10657121	Huge.
10657201	10659902	Because that's what a lot of these gaming boxes are.
10659922	10661783	They're Netflix devices and so forth.
10662824	10664785	Gene in chat says Apple won.
10665465	10666646	You know, that's not a stretch.
10667926	10669368	It just depends on what you look at.
10670309	10672111	Alright, great tweet, great question.
10672151	10673312	Maybe we'll get some emails on that.
10673372	10685685	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Again, sorry to the calls that didn't get through, but we do want to wrap up because we are after 9.15 on the West Coast, which means it's 15 past midnight on the East Coast.
10686005	10687266	So it is about time that we wrap up.
10688367	10692449	But before we say goodnight for good, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.
10693950	10697032	And I do want to also say one more time, thank you very much for downloading us.
10697373	10699134	Thank you for supporting Independent Radio.
10699474	10700955	You made it this far in the show.
10701415	10703597	I really appreciate your guys' support of the show.
10703637	10705198	It's what keeps us motivated to do this.
10705838	10706799	I know we've had some very...
10707139	10707479	DarkSakura.com
10722714	10723475	You said doo-doo.
10723595	10724015	I did.
10724936	10726658	We do perform this show for free.
10727358	10728820	All we ask is help spread the word.
10728860	10729821	Help grow our family.
10729881	10731542	Get some more awesome people into our community.
10731582	10733064	It is so appreciated.
10733504	10735786	And support independent broadcasting.
10736046	10737788	There's so many great people that do this.
10738168	10743914	If you hated our show, yet you made it all this way, there's probably some other indie shows out there that are for you.
10743974	10745095	So check them out.
10747671	10749152	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
10749393	10750173	Loki, we'll start with you.
10750213	10751034	Your final thought tonight.
10751194	10752275	I'm done with Cookie Clicker.
10752295	10753776	You're done?
10753836	10754637	You're over it?
10754657	10757800	My 24-hour foray into Cookie Clicker is now complete.
10757820	10758540	You divorced it?
10758981	10759541	I'm done.
10759661	10760162	I'm over it.
10760302	10760922	You're over it.
10761202	10761583	All right.
10761903	10762544	Party's over.
10762624	10762984	Get out.
10764405	10775875	My final thought tonight is that game capture card I bought really ended up being a waste of money because I don't have a TV next to my PC, which means I need to buy a TV.
10778439	10779620	DarkSakura, your final thoughts tonight.
10802054	10824681	I got up to go grab my shoes because my feet were cold and my legs hurt from doing squats I was walking like the hunched back old woman and also tonight's cookie is fun alright that's it you guys thank you very much for listening to our show and I was also going to say all you need to do is get a really long HDMI cable and your problem solved
10825001	10825581	Problem solved?
10825961	10826661	Maybe I will do that.
10826701	10827702	That's a good idea.
10827762	10833003	I didn't even think to get a 50-foot HD cable.
10833403	10834864	Just what we need in this apartment.
10835044	10836184	I don't know about 50 feet.
10837064	10842946	I don't remember how long it is you can make an HDMI cable before you have to have some sort of signal booster.
10844106	10847587	You should be able to get at least 20 feet without having to do that.
10847767	10848427	That should be enough.
10849099	10851241	Yay, just when we need another big cable in the house.
10851281	10852282	Or wireless HDMI.
10852362	10853262	Alan will be so happy.
10854323	10855524	Alright, he's cheering you live here.
10855684	10856765	Alright, that really is going to do it.
10857025	10858146	Thank you guys again for listening.
10858186	10860328	We will be back next week to do this all again.
10860468	10861649	Next week's not Thanksgiving, right?
10861769	10862950	No, that's two weeks.
10863331	10867494	No, but I'll have to bring over sweet potato latkes that are left over.
10868433	10868993	Oh my god.
10869294	10870735	It is the latke feast.
10870775	10872257	The OLR latke feast.
10872418	10874921	We ate like a whole bag of those fucking latkes last year.
10874941	10875261	They're so good.
10875281	10876342	Maybe I'll bring jelly donuts.
10876923	10877244	No!
10878265	10878906	Alright, that's it.
10878946	10879446	We're done.
10879587	10880047	We're out.
10880087	10880428	Goodnight.
10880947	10881547	Thank you for watching.
10910551	10911791	See you next week. .
