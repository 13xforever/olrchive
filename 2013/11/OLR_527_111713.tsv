27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
36000	44000	It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 527 for this November the 17th of 2013
44000	51000	My name is Rob Roberts joining over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and gaming lolz
51000	53000	And thank you for being here by the way after a week off
53000	59000	But I'm joined this week in studio as I am every single stinking week except last week when we were off
59000	62000	By the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers
62000	65000	How are you doing? Did you have a good week off last week?
65000	67000	What did you end up doing?
67000	75000	I was in a car the whole time but you know like it's about a 6 or 6 and a half hour drive back from L.A.
75000	80000	So I'm in the car the whole time and Alan's there too but there's only so much talking you can do and at some point
80000	82000	And playing what game am I thinking of?
82000	84000	Yeah that kind of thing
84000	88000	We did listen to Bobby's show I will say that we were somewhere in the middle of I don't freaking know
88000	91000	Probably about an hour south of Santa Nella probably Harris Ranch
91000	96000	You California people that know your I5 was around Harris Ranch when Bobby's show came on
96000	100000	So that entertained us a little ways but then the whole way home I'm just going
100000	102000	And this is where OLR will be starting
102000	105000	And here's where Jamie will be doing the Classic Game of the Week
105000	108000	And here's where she'd be throwing a fit about reading emails
109000	111000	I don't throw a fit
111000	115000	But just kind of going through that whole like you know after so many years of doing something
115000	118000	It's kind of like I should be doing this right now but I'm not
118000	120000	We know when we're behind and we know when we're ahead
120000	122000	That's right
122000	124000	Well I hope you had a good week off it was restful and all that stuff
124000	126000	I slept
126000	128000	That is a great way to spend the time
128000	129000	Sleep is good
129000	130000	That's what Sundays are for
130000	132000	Also say hello to Tech Master Loki
132000	133000	Hi
133000	134000	Hi Loki how are you?
134000	135000	Fine
135000	137000	You sound like you might need to be doing a little more sleeping yourself
137000	139000	What happened? Did you catch a cold?
139000	140000	Uh yeah
140000	142000	Did you bring disease to the show tonight?
142000	144000	I've been staying up late at night
144000	148000	Oh is that because of Josh or just you're just doing projects?
148000	150000	Yes it's because of Josh
150000	153000	And totally not because I was playing Cookie Clicker last night
155000	157000	Wait a minute
157000	159000	Cookie Clicker? Really Loki?
159000	161000	I got bored I got bored last night
161000	163000	I got bored last night because
163000	165000	Nellie was messing around with Reddit
165000	167000	And so I was talking with her
167000	169000	And I was like I don't want to browse Reddit anymore
169000	171000	I remember hearing about Cookie Clicker
171000	173000	Or reading about Cookie Clicker
173000	175000	And then I'm like let's see what this thing is
175000	177000	So I tried it out
177000	178000	And yeah
178000	180000	You kind of missed the train Loki
180000	182000	Because Cookie Clicker was all the rage on my other show
182000	184000	Horde House about two months ago
184000	186000	And I think we're all over it now but
186000	188000	You're late to the party that's alright
188000	190000	It's alright I just need to finish it and it'll be done
190000	192000	I didn't realize there was an end to Cookie Clicker
192000	193000	Oh
193000	195000	I played the iPhone knock off one
195000	197000	That's not the same
197000	199000	It isn't the same they really need to put out an official one
199000	200000	For the record?
200000	201000	It's addicting none the less
201000	202000	No
202000	203000	You're not going to get into Cookie Clicker?
203000	204000	Hell no
204000	206000	What about the other iPhone game I've been playing
206000	209000	I can't believe I got sucked into this garbage all over again
209000	212000	I really want to thank Kethervis if she's out there listening
212000	214000	I don't think she listens to OLR but if she is
214000	217000	Like I'm doing that whole warning shots at you right now
217000	219000	She got me addicted to Tiny Death Star
220000	221000	Have you seen this?
221000	222000	Yes and I'm not playing it either
222000	225000	It's Tiny Tower with the LucasArts franchise
225000	229000	With all the Vader and Palpatine and all the characters
229000	233000	And cute little midi style Death Star music
233000	234000	While it's playing
234000	235000	I still refuse
235000	236000	You refuse?
236000	237000	I refuse
237000	238000	It's probably for the best
238000	240000	The only thing that makes me upset about Tiny Death Star
240000	242000	We'll get into real games in a minute I promise
242000	244000	The only thing that makes me upset about Tiny Death Star
244000	247000	Is that you can't rename all the stores
247000	250000	Because that was the best part of Tiny Tower
250000	252000	Which is based off his renaming the stores
252000	256000	Because Allen would always rename his stores to these hilarious things
256000	258000	Of course I can't even remember any of them off the top of my head
258000	260000	Allen what were some of your funny stores
260000	262000	You remember any of them on Tiny Tower
262000	264000	He's shaking his head I wish I could bring it up and see
264000	267000	I know I had a restaurant called Poops R Us
267000	268000	Yeah
268000	270000	Just because I was thinking that it gave people diarrhea
270000	272000	Well there was a
272000	275000	The apartment complex I built in the Death Star
275000	276000	The Death Star was
276000	277000	Let me look I'm trying to
277000	280000	I'm actually pulling it up as we are live here
280000	282000	You can pull up our chat room if you're listening live
282000	284000	Oh you named it Ewok Shits
284000	287000	You can't participate with this show live every Sunday night
287000	289000	At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
289000	291000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
291000	293000	At the Voice of Geeks Network
293000	295000	Vognetwork.com
295000	297000	And if you are listening live come join us and chat
297000	299000	Live.vognetwork.com
299000	302000	Ah here it is the Felucia apartments
302000	304000	Is one of the apartments I have
304000	306000	So I was going to rename it to by Felucia
306000	308000	But I couldn't rename it
308000	310000	Very sad
310000	312000	Sad trombone
312000	314000	Womp womp
314000	316000	Alright anyhow
316000	318000	We're going to get into our gaming weeks and all that good stuff
318000	320000	We'll talk about all that
320000	322000	And what we've been doing with the week
322000	324000	But we got a lot of stuff to catch up on too
324000	326000	After being gone last week
326000	328000	Oh Alan came and he brought in his Tiny Tower
328000	330000	Let me read
330000	332000	What? It's still loading
332000	334000	Live radio everybody
334000	336000	I think I deleted it like
336000	338000	Yeah I finally deleted mine off the phone too
338000	340000	Let me look at our chat room
340000	342000	Live.vognetwork.com
342000	344000	Tim Tripp in chat says
344000	346000	I actually played Tiny Death Star for about 30 minutes
346000	348000	Which is 25 more minutes
348000	350000	Than I usually spend with an iPhone game
350000	352000	Dungeon Buster says
352000	354000	I'm playing Tiny Death Star
354000	356000	Never played Tiny Towers before so this is new to me
356000	358000	So I guess if it hasn't worn off yet
358000	360000	Then that's good
360000	362000	Sandy Ball Gym is called Sandy Balls
364000	366000	The Glassworks is called Here Blow This
368000	370000	The Breakfast Place is called Enough Fucking Pancakes
372000	374000	The Greenhouse
374000	376000	Florist is called Dankweed 420
376000	378000	So yeah
378000	380000	And I see your computer lab is called Sierra Online
380000	382000	In a nod
382000	384000	There you go
384000	386000	Those weren't even his funniest ones but that's alright
386000	388000	There's some funny ones in there
388000	390000	We have to settle a few things
390000	392000	From when we were gone last week
392000	394000	We weren't here last week
394000	396000	I was in Anaheim
396000	398000	Sort of at Blizzcon
398000	400000	Meaning I didn't go to actual Blizzcon
400000	402000	I just went to all the parties and then I went to Disneyland
402000	404000	Which is right next door
404000	406000	That was the way to do it
406000	408000	I had a great time
408000	410000	I met a lot of awesome people
410000	412000	I'll talk more about Blizzcon later in the show
412000	414000	When we get to some of that news
414000	416000	One of the cliffhangers we left last week
416000	418000	Or excuse me, two weeks ago
418000	420000	Was that we were talking about the end
420000	422000	Of the last generation with PlayStation 3
422000	424000	And so forth
424000	426000	And the start of the new one
426000	428000	And I mentioned that I was waffling on the PlayStation 4
428000	430000	And I wasn't sure if I was going to get one
430000	432000	And I had my pre-order through Amazon
432000	434000	Was I going to keep it, was I going to cancel it
436000	438000	Wii U, you might remember a year ago
438000	440000	I never bothered pre-ordering a Wii U
440000	442000	I said I'm not going to get it
442000	444000	The day the Wii U comes out, what did I do?
444000	446000	I got one at Target
446000	448000	So what happened with the PlayStation 4?
448000	450000	I did not buy the PlayStation 4
450000	452000	I cancelled my pre-order
452000	454000	When I got back from Disneyland
454000	456000	You were a wise, wise fellow
456000	458000	Well, here's the thing
458000	460000	A part of me actually feels kind of bad
460000	462000	Because at Disney
462000	464000	I had a great time at Disney
464000	466000	Alan and I had a great time on Friday
466000	468000	And the park wasn't very crowded
468000	470000	But then Saturday, randomly
470000	472000	An old friend of mine
472000	474000	A few years ago
474000	476000	Who actually works for Sony now
476000	478000	Was hanging out with me at the park
478000	480000	And we were talking, of course we have to talk
480000	482000	I don't want to bug him with work
482000	484000	But we have to talk a little bit about PlayStation 4
484000	486000	And he was telling me all the good stuff
486000	488000	And I was leaving Saturday feeling really jazzed
488000	490000	About PlayStation 4, like, okay
490000	492000	I gotta get one when I get home, I gotta get one when I get home
492000	494000	But then I'll tell you what
494000	496000	Swamee was that drive home Sunday
496000	498000	And I don't know what it was
498000	500000	I don't know if it was kind of listening to Bobby's show
500000	502000	You know, it's
502000	504000	A video game system is only as good as the games that are on it
504000	506000	Or what have you
506000	508000	But I really realized, guys
508000	510000	There's just nothing I really, really want to get
510000	512000	On PlayStation 4 right now
512000	514000	Now, early next year
514000	516000	Absolutely
516000	518000	Diablo 3 on PlayStation 4 looks great
518000	520000	Even though I already played it on PC
520000	522000	I enjoy the controls on PlayStation 3's demo
522000	524000	And I will give the game another try on PlayStation 4
524000	526000	Absolutely
526000	528000	Final Fantasy 14 will be in beta
528000	530000	In the PlayStation 4
530000	532000	And then
532000	534000	I do want to get the Need for Speed game at some point
534000	536000	But next year, some other things to look forward to
536000	538000	Infamous Second Son, obviously
538000	540000	And Destiny
540000	542000	I mean, that's all in the first half next year
542000	544000	So I'm sure between now and then
544000	546000	I will end up buying a PlayStation 4
546000	548000	But I'm gonna be perfectly honest with you guys
548000	550000	Despite all this, like, console wars
550000	552000	And whether you're cheering me or booing me
552000	554000	For my decision
554000	556000	Money played a big part of it, too
556000	558000	Might have gone over budget a little bit
558000	560000	When we were in Anaheim, so
560000	562000	Whoops, womp, womp
562000	564000	Going to the chat room
564000	566000	At live.vognetwork.com
566000	568000	RawstealUT says
568000	570000	So the Wii U is worth more at launch
570000	572000	Than the PlayStation 4?
572000	574000	I'm
574000	576000	This is not gonna be a popular answer
576000	578000	Yes
580000	582000	And the reason why I say yes
582000	584000	Is at least
584000	586000	On the Wii U
586000	588000	And you can call me fanboy all you want
588000	590000	I don't give a fuck
590000	592000	But on the Wii U at least, there was the Mario Brothers
592000	594000	Which I really wanted to play, the Super Mario Brothers Wii U
594000	596000	And there was Zombie U
596000	598000	And yeah, I wanted to play Nintendo Land, too
598000	600000	I mean, that was three games
600000	602000	At launch that I said, I really want to play these games
602000	604000	I couldn't do that with PlayStation 4
604000	606000	I couldn't sit there and go
606000	608000	These are four games I have to play
608000	610000	Right now
610000	612000	I couldn't do that
612000	614000	And honestly, we all know that Wii U lost a lot of steam
614000	616000	Over its first year release
616000	618000	And I'm not gonna try and defend that
618000	620000	You know, there should have been more in the pipeline
620000	622000	Or what have you
622000	624000	I think that's where PlayStation 4 will outpace Wii U
624000	626000	Is because I'm looking at the first half of next year
626000	628000	Going, this looks very exciting
628000	630000	For PlayStation 4
630000	632000	With all those games I just named
632000	634000	So in that regard
634000	636000	Which I would argue
636000	638000	Is more crucial
638000	640000	To the system
640000	642000	In the future than the launch
642000	644000	The next six months look very good for PlayStation 4
644000	646000	So
646000	648000	Let's see, also going to the chat room
648000	650000	I didn't get one either
650000	652000	Yeah, neither did Loki
652000	654000	You guys had already kind of locked that in a couple weeks ago
654000	656000	But I know I was waffling
656000	658000	It just has to do with the bullshit of system launches
658000	660000	The way they go these days
660000	662000	If there aren't the games that are gonna be out
662000	664000	Let me rephrase that
664000	666000	Because I can't apparently speak proper English today
666000	668000	If the games that I want to play
668000	670000	Are not out when the system launches
670000	672000	Then buying the system is buying a giant paperweight
672000	674000	I would rather wait
674000	676000	Till the issues get worked out
676000	678000	I would rather wait until there's a library that's worth me
678000	680000	Actually putting some money on
680000	682000	And my $100 gift card will last me a while
682000	684000	Yeah
684000	686000	I am still planning on
686000	688000	And this again
688000	690000	Probably won't be a popular statement
690000	692000	But I don't care
692000	694000	I am still planning on getting that Zelda 3DS I want
694000	696000	And Mario 3D World next week
696000	698000	You know when Fire Emblem's out?
698000	700000	It didn't Fire Emblem already
700000	702000	It did?
702000	704000	Yeah, it came out a while ago
704000	706000	Unless there's a new one I'm not aware of
706000	708000	But that's
708000	710000	Yes, I am still planning on keeping that
710000	712000	But the good news is I can actually sell my old 3DS
712000	714000	To recoup some of the money
714000	716000	That's what I plan on doing
716000	718000	Yep, yep
718000	720000	Let's see
720000	722000	Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
722000	724000	RawsteelUT says
724000	728000	There's never been a system that had a five star launch lineup
728000	730000	I'm really trying to think that through
730000	732000	Oh, the Xbox 360 I thought had a pretty great launch
732000	734000	360 wasn't bad
734000	736000	360 wasn't bad at all
736000	738000	Dreamcast had good games when it came out
738000	740000	Dreamcast was decent, yeah
740000	742000	Sonic Adventure by itself
742000	744000	Was a great game
744000	746000	I remember
746000	748000	Super Nintendo was really weak
748000	750000	But it had Mario World
750000	752000	Nobody cared there's Mario World
752000	756000	There's another one I'm trying to think through
756000	758000	Genesis launch was really crappy as far as games go
758000	760000	Because it was just the standard Sega fare
760000	762000	There was no Sonic
762000	764000	Was it like an Alex Kidd game?
764000	766000	Yeah
766000	768000	Altered Beast I'm pretty sure was the launch title
768000	770000	columns
770000	772000	Alan's here
772000	774000	I was trying to think pop quiz wise
774000	776000	There were five or six launch week Super Nintendo games
776000	778000	It was SimCity, Pilotwings
778000	780000	Super Mario World
780000	782000	I want to say Final Fantasy 2
782000	784000	But no that came out a couple months later
784000	786000	It was Launch Window
786000	788000	Within like six months of it
788000	790000	There were just like the four or five
790000	792000	There was also the Super Scope games
792000	794000	No, Super Scope games way later
794000	796000	Actually, Alan, I think those ones you named
796000	798000	I don't remember
798000	800000	Was F-Zero at launch?
800000	802000	But I think the ones you named
802000	804000	I think first party were the only ones
804000	806000	There was Pilotwings
806000	808000	The Nintendo
808000	810000	The Green Hair Professor port
810000	812000	Of SimCity
812000	814000	And Mario World
814000	816000	Those were the big three from Nintendo
816000	818000	I thought that first week there were five
818000	820000	I'm trying to think of what the other two were
820000	822000	Someone Wikipedia it in chat
822000	824000	Now I'm trying to
824000	826000	I'm getting asked some questions about the Xbox One
826000	828000	And where my head's at with that
828000	830000	I'm going to be honest guys
830000	832000	I kind of counted that out a while ago
832000	834000	Because the $100 price tag gets a little more up there
834000	836000	And the launch games to me
836000	838000	Didn't counter balance that
838000	840000	Yes, I know it's getting Killer Instinct
840000	842000	But I'm kind of eh on that
842000	844000	I think the launch games sound a little bit better
844000	846000	Four to five sounds pretty awesome
846000	848000	And Dead Rising 3
848000	850000	It's just like the whole series
850000	852000	Dead Rising, I bought it
852000	854000	I have fun with it for about
854000	856000	A week and then I get bored with it
856000	858000	Really fast
858000	860000	The same thing happened
860000	862000	I got Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising 2 off the record
862000	864000	And I got bored with it so fast
864000	866000	You'd think that would be impossible
866000	868000	Being that it's a sandbox zombie game
868000	870000	But Dead Rising 3 I think I'd just get bored with
870000	872000	Really fast
872000	874000	Just so you know Alan, looking at chat
874000	876000	Bobby Blackwolf went and looked it up for you
876000	878000	Super Nintendo launch titles were indeed
878000	880000	Mario World F-Zero was a launch title
880000	882000	Pilotwings, SimCity, Gradius 3
882000	884000	Was the only other one that was there the day it launched
884000	886000	Yeah, that was the one you were missing
886000	888000	So yeah, here's the thing
888000	890000	I actually kind of agree that I think
890000	892000	The Xbox One lineup and those things you just said
892000	894000	Forza, The Crimson Dragon, not so much Rise
894000	896000	In fact, very much not so much Rise
896000	898000	Yeah, Rise is kind of...
898000	900000	But a lot of those other games you're talking about
900000	902000	Actually, I think the Xbox lineup out the gate
902000	904000	Sounds a little stronger than Playstation 4
904000	906000	But do I want to pay another $100 for the privilege
906000	908000	Of playing those games?
908000	910000	Is it that much a must-have title?
910000	912000	Not for me, and not the stuff I play
912000	914000	So
914000	916000	I still think it's weird seeing
916000	918000	I saw a TV commercial again today
918000	920000	They had some football on at Chili's
920000	922000	And it was talking about
922000	924000	How to watch TV with the Xbox One
924000	926000	And how that's a selling feature
926000	928000	I'm like, I just don't get
928000	930000	I guess if you're really hardcore into
930000	932000	Fancy football, cool
932000	934000	But other than that, why the hell
934000	936000	Would you purchase that system to watch
936000	938000	TV on it? It just doesn't seem like
938000	940000	That makes sense
940000	942000	I will say this now
942000	944000	Now that it's been a week
944000	946000	Do I regret my decision to not get a
946000	948000	Playstation 4?
948000	950000	It's
950000	952000	It is really
952000	954000	Taking a lot of willpower
954000	956000	To make me not go
956000	958000	Isn't there something we could sell to get the money
958000	960000	Don't we have hidden money somewhere
960000	962000	That I could dig up and help pay for the
962000	964000	Playstation 4? Do I have a rewards card
964000	966000	Or an unspent gift certificate?
966000	968000	Watching other people
968000	970000	On their Twitch streams
970000	972000	I've been watching Exeter was streaming
972000	974000	Some stuff, and that was fun, and Bobby was streaming
974000	976000	Some stuff, and it was neat to watch
976000	978000	It kind of made me go, oh
978000	980000	That's right, I could have played like DC Universe
980000	982000	Online with all the new textures would have been really cool
982000	984000	And flowers really pretty
984000	986000	And all that
986000	988000	And the Twitch stuff looks great
988000	990000	So there is that whole like, I want to be in the cool kids club
990000	992000	Type of thing going on
992000	994000	But I'm doing alright
994000	996000	I'm pretty sure I'm going to make it till
996000	998000	2014 without breaking down
998000	1000000	And buying a Playstation 4
1000000	1002000	We'll see
1002000	1004000	Alright, so yeah, that's it
1004000	1006000	No Playstation 4 for me
1006000	1008000	For now, but I am still going to
1008000	1010000	Of course be following it as are we all
1010000	1012000	And doing the news and all that
1012000	1014000	And I'll get one eventually
1014000	1016000	Just so you know guys
1016000	1018000	Just to kind of put it in perspective
1018000	1020000	I did not buy an Xbox 360
1020000	1022000	At launch either, nor did I buy a
1022000	1024000	Playstation 3 at launch
1024000	1026000	I actually bought the Xbox 360 first
1026000	1028000	I bought that about 4 months after it launched
1028000	1030000	They were still really hard to find
1030000	1032000	When I bought it, like I had to
1032000	1034000	And when they got the new
1034000	1036000	Shipments, and I remember I had to get
1036000	1038000	The not fancy 360
1038000	1040000	And had to buy the extra stuff
1040000	1042000	Separately
1042000	1044000	Excuse me, they were still hard to come by
1044000	1046000	And my Xbox 360 died within a week
1046000	1048000	Of me buying it, and that pissed me off
1048000	1050000	But whatever, it's old news now
1050000	1052000	Playstation 3 I didn't buy
1052000	1054000	For like a year, I didn't buy Playstation 3
1054000	1056000	Until LittleBigPlanet I think had been announced
1056000	1058000	Or came out or something
1058000	1060000	Was when I finally got the Playstation 3
1060000	1062000	So, just because I don't buy a console at launch
1062000	1064000	Doesn't mean I won't love the system eventually
1064000	1066000	Like I said before, if Killzone
1066000	1068000	Wasn't Killzone, if it was a new
1068000	1070000	Resistance game, next gen
1070000	1072000	I would buy that
1072000	1074000	Because, well, I would want that game
1074000	1076000	But
1076000	1078000	I just, I don't like Killzone
1078000	1080000	I really don't like Killzone
1080000	1082000	And looking at like, you know, what the next gen
1082000	1084000	Games, I guess, you know, like Call of Duty
1084000	1086000	And Battlefield and stuff, I mean, Call of Duty
1086000	1088000	Just, first off, Call of Duty I'm not excited about
1088000	1090000	At all
1090000	1092000	I had actually gotten a copy and I'm like
1092000	1094000	Fuck this, I'm not opening this, I'm selling it
1094000	1096000	And so I did
1096000	1098000	But I still have another copy
1098000	1100000	But, you know, it's just
1100000	1102000	I haven't even bothered to want to play that
1102000	1104000	And, you know, it just didn't look that
1104000	1106000	Great on
1106000	1108000	It just doesn't show off
1108000	1110000	The power of that system at all
1110000	1112000	It just kind of, you know, okay
1112000	1114000	This looks like a Playstation 3 game
1114000	1116000	I don't know
1116000	1118000	Alright, well, let's see
1118000	1120000	What else should I talk about here? I want to get into our gaming weeks
1120000	1122000	But I should mention BlizzCon real quick
1122000	1124000	I did talk a little more in depth about this
1124000	1126000	Over on Horde House, my other show, which is on Wednesdays
1126000	1128000	With Xtavor, Shana Linko
1128000	1130000	And Grandpa Matt
1130000	1132000	That is on Wednesdays
1132000	1134000	And the latest episode, which is called
1134000	1136000	Outworld is Mortal Combat
1136000	1138000	The name of it, long story
1138000	1140000	You'll figure it out when you listen
1140000	1142000	I talked a little more about BlizzCon, but I just want to reiterate
1142000	1144000	I did have a good time at the parties
1144000	1146000	I met all the people
1146000	1148000	There was this fun little event called World of Podcasts
1148000	1150000	They did Thursday night where they tried to get all the podcasters
1150000	1152000	Together to kind of like do these panels and things
1152000	1154000	And that was neat for networking
1154000	1156000	And just getting to meet different people
1156000	1158000	So yeah, I had a good time at the event
1158000	1160000	And, you know, you definitely feel that buzz
1160000	1162000	In the air, all the excitement for the new products
1162000	1164000	You know, obviously
1164000	1166000	A big Warcraft expansion was announced
1166000	1168000	We'll get into some of the details a little later on when we get to the news
1168000	1170000	But there was a lot of buzz about that
1170000	1172000	And the many other things that they announced
1172000	1174000	But, you know, remember guys
1174000	1176000	BlizzCon costs $175 to go to
1176000	1178000	And I just, I got to be honest
1178000	1180000	I think the way I did it was great
1180000	1182000	Where we went to Disneyland
1182000	1184000	And I got to go to the parties, so I got to do all the networking
1184000	1186000	Yeah, I didn't get to play the new stuff
1186000	1188000	But that's okay
1188000	1190000	I'll play it eventually, it'll come out
1190000	1192000	$175, hmm
1192000	1194000	I don't know about that
1194000	1196000	Alright, let's get into our gaming weeks
1196000	1198000	What types of video games have we been playing this week
1198000	1200000	On the consoles we do own?
1200000	1202000	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1202000	1204000	I'm actually defending RossTLUT
1204000	1206000	Give me a second
1206000	1208000	Oh, chat stuff going on right now
1208000	1210000	At live.hugnetwork.com
1210000	1212000	If he wants attention, then don't give attention
1212000	1214000	Let me, go ahead
1214000	1216000	No, my point is that he left the room
1216000	1218000	He's not there to defend himself
1218000	1220000	I don't see any point in talking about him behind his back
1220000	1222000	The end
1222000	1224000	Let's get into our gaming weeks
1224000	1226000	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1226000	1228000	Um, my gaming week
1228000	1230000	Was nice
1230000	1232000	I
1232000	1234000	I actually
1234000	1236000	Have twice finished the Stanley Parable
1236000	1238000	Sorry, I didn't mean to kick you
1238000	1240000	Then I'll kick you harder
1240000	1242000	I finished the Stanley Parable
1242000	1244000	Which you play it through once the way you're told to play it
1244000	1246000	And then you do different things that keep you
1246000	1248000	From actually finishing the game
1248000	1250000	So it's a very interesting kind of twist
1250000	1252000	On the walk through
1252000	1254000	First person adventure
1254000	1256000	I really like it
1256000	1258000	It was very well done
1258000	1260000	I don't know that it was worth the full charge price
1260000	1262000	Of it, but it was definitely worth the sale price
1262000	1264000	It was a very good game
1264000	1266000	And I haven't finished exploring it
1266000	1268000	It's pretty neat
1268000	1270000	I hear the game has a funny sense of humor
1270000	1272000	It does, it has a really funny sense of humor
1272000	1274000	Compared to GLaDOS from Portal a lot
1274000	1276000	Yeah, the narrator is just Mr. Snark
1276000	1278000	As long as you don't do
1278000	1280000	What Mr. Narrator says
1280000	1282000	So you can rebel against the narrator
1282000	1284000	It's encouraged
1284000	1286000	That you do so from time to time
1286000	1288000	I also
1288000	1290000	Have been playing
1290000	1292000	Mass Effect 2
1292000	1294000	And Mass Effect 3
1294000	1296000	Because I have
1296000	1298000	I'm actually trying once again to get textures
1298000	1300000	Imported on my Mass Effect 3
1300000	1302000	By doing mods myself from scratch
1302000	1304000	Using textures and meshes that other people
1304000	1306000	Have made and I've got
1306000	1308000	Meshes working just fine
1308000	1310000	Not textures and I do not want to use text mod
1310000	1312000	Because that means it would be a pain in the ass
1312000	1314000	So, moving on from that
1314000	1316000	I also played Final Fantasy 14
1316000	1318000	And I'm taking my sweet time with it
1318000	1320000	But I finally got Thaumaturge leveled up
1320000	1322000	Once someone reminded me
1322000	1324000	That I could actually
1324000	1326000	Pick some of my Arcana stability
1326000	1328000	And use them with my Thaumaturge
1328000	1330000	The class became less shitty
1330000	1332000	I'm sorry, physic is like
1332000	1334000	Thaumaturges are like
1334000	1336000	Squish, squish, squish, squish
1336000	1338000	No mana, squish, squish
1338000	1340000	And then I was like
1340000	1342000	Oh yeah, physic
1342000	1344000	Being able to heal yourself is a great little perk
1344000	1346000	But now I'm back to
1346000	1348000	Arcanist and I'm going to
1348000	1350000	Work up to 34 and then do that stupid quest again
1350000	1352000	That one that I'm trying to finish
1352000	1354000	So I'm just wandering around doing fates
1354000	1356000	Right now anyway, so
1356000	1358000	Kind of boring, but...
1358000	1360000	Are you excited about the content patch coming in December?
1360000	1362000	Yeah, I did enjoy the lightning
1362000	1364000	Thing
1364000	1366000	I got the quest
1366000	1368000	And I actually hung out
1368000	1370000	Basically you just find
1370000	1372000	Where all the people are camping and that's where lightning
1372000	1374000	Is going to show up eventually
1374000	1376000	In one of the little random
1376000	1378000	Fates that pop up in that area
1378000	1380000	So I actually got the lightning
1380000	1382000	Thing, her showing there and being all kind of
1382000	1384000	Broody to herself and
1384000	1386000	Is this my fate?
1386000	1388000	I'm lightning angst
1388000	1390000	I just liked how all the fonts turned to Final Fantasy
1390000	1392000	13 and the music
1392000	1394000	I gotta be honest
1394000	1396000	I sat there waiting for the fate to pop
1396000	1398000	And I was like, this is so boring I didn't even
1398000	1400000	See it through
1400000	1402000	I was like, fuck this I'll do it later
1402000	1404000	I was a little bit late because I was trying to get a good
1404000	1406000	View to screen capper
1406000	1408000	You know because
1408000	1410000	They turned it off, regular screen caps
1410000	1412000	But I use steam for it
1412000	1414000	So I was going to turn off all my stuff in screen capper
1414000	1416000	But I didn't get it done
1416000	1418000	I did like though that you can get
1418000	1420000	Some of the outfits and armor
1420000	1422000	And that's what I'm kind of working on right now
1422000	1424000	Because I like pretty stuff
1424000	1426000	I've been playing Animal Crossing
1426000	1428000	I am going to be probably playing
1428000	1430000	Animal Crossing because I have one
1430000	1432000	Lone left
1432000	1434000	For my second character
1434000	1436000	And then there's Julian's but I'm using his as bribery
1436000	1438000	So that he actually behaves in
1438000	1440000	He's a good boy but he doesn't listen
1440000	1442000	Another one of your animals moved to my village
1442000	1443000	Really?
1443000	1444000	Agnes I think it was?
1444000	1446000	Oh the pig? Yeah
1446000	1448000	I know Portia just moved too so I don't know who she moved to
1448000	1450000	I don't think she came to mine, I got Agnes
1450000	1452000	I got Mitzi finally
1452000	1454000	The white cat with the blue face
1454000	1456000	That was on the cover of the first game
1456000	1458000	I have Mitzi now
1458000	1460000	And I like her better than Ed
1460000	1462000	And I want Ed to leave because he's fucking creepy
1462000	1464000	It's like they're real people
1464000	1466000	I was actually
1466000	1468000	I started listening
1468000	1470000	To the Night Vale podcast
1470000	1472000	Which is fun
1472000	1474000	But I was thinking about doing an Animal Crossing
1474000	1476000	Parody with Night Vale type
1476000	1478000	Stuff that's called Welcome to Normandy
1478000	1480000	Or something
1481000	1483000	A particular person at VOG has
1483000	1485000	Openly voiced the fact that they would love to have
1485000	1487000	Some type of fiction based podcast
1487000	1489000	Thing here, it would be a lot of fun
1489000	1491000	Well you know I've
1491000	1493000	I've been working on stories already so
1493000	1495000	Make it happen
1495000	1496000	Make it work
1496000	1498000	I actually have a very extreme story I'm already working on
1498000	1500000	For a webcomic but it would tie in very nicely with the podcast
1500000	1502000	Talk to me, talk to me person
1502000	1504000	Alright
1506000	1508000	Crap I played other shit
1508000	1510000	But I don't remember what the fuck it was
1512000	1514000	It's kind of hard though I've noticed
1514000	1516000	To play MMOs
1516000	1518000	When you have a very needy cat
1518000	1520000	Midna has now taken
1520000	1522000	To climbing up my side
1522000	1524000	And patting me on the shoulder when she wants me to play with her
1524000	1526000	Not just you know
1526000	1528000	The climbing up part
1528000	1530000	But she pats me on the shoulder and waits till I look at her
1530000	1532000	And then she goes
1532000	1534000	And then she hops up in my lap
1534000	1536000	And tries to eat my mouse so whatever
1536000	1538000	Not an actual mouse
1538000	1540000	Like your computer mouse
1540000	1542000	Cat and mouse
1542000	1544000	You know what's stupid about my mouse by the way
1544000	1546000	Because Microsoft doesn't make that thumb track ball anymore
1546000	1548000	People on Amazon sell them for 200 bucks
1548000	1550000	And I own two of them
1550000	1552000	They don't make thumb track balls anymore?
1552000	1554000	Not the wired Microsoft thumb track ball
1554000	1556000	Oh like different brands
1556000	1558000	Logitech makes one like it
1558000	1560000	But people are actually spending the 200 bucks
1560000	1562000	And it makes me think maybe I should sell one of mine
1562000	1564000	But then again I wouldn't be able to get another
1564000	1566000	Loki how was your gaming week?
1566000	1568000	I played a lot of Grand Theft Auto
1568000	1570000	Of course you did
1570000	1572000	So I played more of online
1572000	1574000	I think I'm like level 28 now
1574000	1576000	On PS3
1576000	1578000	I didn't play any online on 360
1578000	1580000	But I did 100% 360
1580000	1582000	So I'm all done with that
1582000	1584000	And actually I'm kind of
1584000	1586000	I was trying to black out everything on 360
1586000	1588000	As far as the 100% checklist
1588000	1590000	Because there's more stuff you can do
1590000	1592000	Than actually get 100% for
1592000	1594000	Doesn't make any sense but
1594000	1596000	That's the way they have it
1596000	1598000	So what did I do?
1598000	1600000	I did all the
1600000	1602000	Epsilon tracks the other day
1602000	1604000	And
1604000	1606000	I don't know just messing around
1606000	1608000	I'll probably play more online
1608000	1610000	Because they're gonna have a content patch
1610000	1612000	Coming out
1612000	1614000	This week
1614000	1616000	And
1616000	1618000	Then
1618000	1620000	Then I played Cookie Clicker
1620000	1622000	I started that last night
1622000	1624000	It's only been a few hours
1624000	1626000	I can hear you over there clicking while you're talking by the way
1626000	1628000	Of course
1628000	1630000	You got an intervention
1630000	1632000	It'll be over soon don't worry
1632000	1634000	There is an end
1634000	1636000	Alright
1636000	1638000	How many cookies do you have right now?
1638000	1640000	Well I'm producing
1640000	1642000	Looks like just under
1642000	1644000	30 million per second
1644000	1646000	It's not enough
1646000	1648000	Alright anything else?
1648000	1650000	Um
1650000	1652000	No that's it
1652000	1654000	Alright my gaming wheel
1654000	1656000	Real quick actually
1656000	1658000	A little bit of Forza Horizon but I wasn't actually playing it
1658000	1660000	My son was playing it
1660000	1662000	I saw the stuff on Facebook
1662000	1664000	With the pictures and everything
1664000	1666000	Yeah he likes playing with my Microsoft
1666000	1668000	Racing wheel
1668000	1670000	He likes pretending it's a steering wheel
1670000	1672000	And goes and plays around that
1672000	1674000	So I'm like hey what about the
1674000	1676000	Then he wants to sit in my car and stuff
1676000	1678000	And tell him how the car works
1678000	1680000	And I'm like yeah you push the pedals to go
1680000	1682000	And stuff and well I'll tell you what I can set up
1682000	1684000	A game for you and you can go drive a car in that
1684000	1686000	And so
1686000	1688000	He had trouble at first because I had the
1688000	1690000	Force feedback on and stuff
1690000	1692000	It's hella hard to drive that stupid steering wheel
1692000	1694000	With the force feedback on so I turned it all off
1694000	1696000	And then I finally
1696000	1698000	Switched him into a Honda Fit
1698000	1700000	Because the car I picked for him
1700000	1702000	Because it was a class C car
1702000	1704000	Just was all over the road but for some reason
1704000	1706000	The Fit doesn't
1706000	1708000	It's more stable I guess or something
1708000	1710000	And so he
1710000	1712000	He was doing alright
1712000	1714000	He got it up to like 35
1714000	1716000	And he was staying on the road
1716000	1718000	But there was like a turn
1718000	1720000	It was like an S turn and he was able to stay on the road
1720000	1722000	So it was pretty cool
1722000	1724000	Let's see look at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
1724000	1726000	Dark Tetsuya saw the video
1726000	1728000	And said that was a great video Loki
1728000	1730000	Ciao wants to know
1730000	1732000	Sorry I always mispronounce your name
1732000	1734000	Says what's the subscription fee
1734000	1736000	For the Final Fantasy MMO
1736000	1738000	I believe it's $12.95 a month for the basic
1738000	1740000	Which gives you 1 character a server
1740000	1742000	Think $14.95 for the advanced
1742000	1744000	Which is 8 characters a server
1744000	1746000	I only had 1 plan
1746000	1748000	And that was the $14.99 plan
1748000	1750000	Go take a look
1750000	1752000	Because I think there's a $12.95 plan
1752000	1754000	I didn't see any of it but I don't care
1754000	1756000	Because I wanted all the stuff and whatever
1756000	1758000	It's what I was paying for a while anyway so it's fine
1758000	1760000	It's not that big a difference
1760000	1762000	Anything else Loki? Or do I get to go?
1762000	1764000	Alright my gaming week
1764000	1766000	Honestly not a whole lot of
1766000	1768000	Different stuff because I was out of town for a few days
1768000	1770000	But you know the typical Final Fantasy 14
1770000	1772000	I'm addicted to that
1772000	1774000	And also played some World of Warcraft
1774000	1776000	I think the whole BlizzCon thing might have energized
1776000	1778000	Me a little bit to at least log in and check out my character
1778000	1780000	And go yep still
1780000	1782000	Still got no friends left playing this game that's too bad
1782000	1784000	But I did play
1784000	1786000	Some actual new stuff
1786000	1788000	I did play a little more of the Midway Arcade
1788000	1790000	Because I was trophy hunting in that game
1790000	1792000	And I talked about that a couple weeks ago on the show
1792000	1794000	But another game I played
1794000	1796000	On Playstation 3, you ready for this?
1796000	1798000	While all you guys were busy with your
1798000	1800000	Newfangled Playstation 4's
1800000	1802000	Playing one of the big launch titles, Assassin's Creed 4
1802000	1804000	I played Assassin's Creed 3
1804000	1806000	On Playstation 3
1806000	1808000	Which by the way is my first
1808000	1810000	Assassin's Creed game I've ever played
1810000	1812000	To which everybody is telling me
1812000	1814000	You're doing it wrong!
1814000	1816000	I want two, I actually have two for PC
1816000	1818000	Do you?
1818000	1820000	But I hated playing it without a controller
1820000	1822000	I like
1822000	1824000	I've been playing Assassin's Creed 3
1824000	1826000	I like it well enough
1826000	1828000	I've only gotten through that first little chapter
1828000	1830000	Where you're in the Opera House, then the boat and everything
1830000	1832000	I liked the way that it was telling
1832000	1834000	A story and I thought the environments were really
1834000	1836000	Kind of neat, like I really liked that
1836000	1838000	Opera House was really pretty
1838000	1840000	To be scaling all around and jumping all around
1840000	1842000	So I was kind of having fun with that
1842000	1844000	But did you fight Ultros?
1844000	1846000	No, I did not fight Ultros
1846000	1848000	But I did
1848000	1850000	I did have to walk in the
1850000	1852000	Rafters and all that stuff
1852000	1854000	The way the sequence was done was really
1854000	1856000	Neat, like you would hop over to this stage
1856000	1858000	Piece that would fall because of your weight
1858000	1860000	But not all the way onto the stage
1860000	1862000	Yeah, I was
1862000	1864000	Having fun with it
1864000	1866000	I want to play a little more of it
1866000	1868000	I probably will, I didn't get to play a lot a lot this week
1868000	1870000	But I played enough to get through that first
1870000	1872000	Chapter, it was exciting enough
1872000	1874000	Considering it was a series
1874000	1876000	I never really, I've had a lot of people
1876000	1878000	Tell me like, Rob, you should play Assassin's Creed
1878000	1880000	Why don't you talk about Assassin's Creed on your show?
1880000	1882000	Why aren't you playing this game?
1882000	1884000	I tried Assassin's Creed 1, nah
1884000	1886000	It was just kind of not for me
1886000	1888000	I just wanted to play 2
1888000	1890000	Simply because it was Renaissance Italy
1890000	1892000	And you get to kill
1892000	1894000	Dometicis and that's always fun
1894000	1896000	Because when they weren't busy
1896000	1898000	Being Pope or killing each other off
1898000	1900000	They're a very interesting family
1900000	1902000	But yeah, all those same people telling me to play Assassin's Creed
1902000	1904000	I'm sure when they hear I started with a third game
1904000	1906000	They're gonna be like, what are you doing?
1906000	1908000	Don't do that one
1908000	1910000	But too late, and I'm enjoying it well enough
1910000	1912000	So, hey, the good news is if 3
1912000	1914000	Is like the worst one, then
1914000	1916000	That gives me incentive to go play 1 and 2 again
1916000	1918000	I don't think 3 was the worst one
1918000	1920000	It sold way better than 4 did
1920000	1922000	Well, wait a minute though
1922000	1924000	4's only been out, what, since Friday?
1924000	1926000	I'm talking the first 4 days
1926000	1928000	Oh wait, that's right, 4 was out on the other consoles
1928000	1930000	Well, but could that be because
1930000	1932000	Of the spread where some people are waiting for
1932000	1934000	PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and all that?
1934000	1936000	It's funny because actually for work
1936000	1938000	I was doing some comparisons
1938000	1940000	Between launch
1940000	1942000	Basically from that Tuesday to
1942000	1944000	The Saturday launch
1944000	1946000	Week
1946000	1948000	Versus their previous
1948000	1950000	Iterations and stuff
1950000	1952000	Just a little bit
1952000	1954000	Of a spoiler here
1954000	1956000	Call of Duty and Ghost did not sell
1956000	1958000	Every 1 billion copies, they sold
1958000	1960000	Into retail 1 billion copies
1960000	1962000	They sold through maybe about
1962000	1964000	177 million dollars
1964000	1966000	Worth of that, not 1 billion dollars
1966000	1968000	And then
1968000	1970000	Assassin's Creed 4
1970000	1972000	I don't remember what it was, but it was about
1972000	1974000	It was less than half
1974000	1976000	Of Assassin's Creed 3
1976000	1978000	Assassin's Creed 3 sold really well
1978000	1980000	My idea with that is because they changed
1980000	1982000	Up the locale and it was a little bit of a different
1982000	1984000	Type of game, so it was a lot more interesting
1984000	1986000	Warriors 4 is very similar
1986000	1988000	To Assassin's Creed 3 except now it's
1988000	1990000	Pirates and there's more of the ship
1990000	1992000	Stuff in there, but
1992000	1994000	I don't know, no one cares about
1994000	1996000	Call of Duty for some reason this year
1996000	1998000	Looking at our chatroom at
1998000	2000000	Live.vognetwork.com, Tim Tripp
2000000	2002000	Says, I'm loving Assassin's Creed 4
2002000	2004000	Sexy pirate adventure time
2004000	2006000	Assassin's Creed 3, the part
2006000	2008000	I played, didn't have pirates, but it had a little bit
2008000	2010000	Of the boat
2010000	2012000	I don't know if you've been
2012000	2014000	Marking yourself for download for all those free
2014000	2016000	Xbox games
2016000	2018000	Right? No, I don't think I have
2018000	2020000	They had Assassin's Creed 2 on there
2020000	2022000	Did they? Yeah
2022000	2024000	Stupid me
2024000	2026000	Other comments on Assassin's Creed
2026000	2028000	DKB says I couldn't get through the first one
2028000	2030000	But the rest were great
2030000	2032000	Let's see
2032000	2034000	Burr says the Assassin's Creed 2 trilogy is good
2034000	2036000	Or you could go right into Assassin's Creed 4
2036000	2038000	And
2038000	2040000	Let's see
2041000	2043000	Well they had it out on PS3
2043000	2045000	And now it's out on 360 as well
2045000	2047000	Gene in our chatroom at Live.vognetwork.com says
2047000	2049000	Maybe the second one, it's cheap
2049000	2051000	Easily sets up how to play
2051000	2053000	So here you go
2053000	2055000	Some comments and suggestions from our chatroom at Live.vognetwork.com
2055000	2057000	That's pretty much it for my gaming week
2057000	2059000	I have some other Playstation Network things to get into
2059000	2061000	But I didn't play them enough
2061000	2063000	So I'll get into them a little later on next week
2063000	2065000	So let's
2065000	2067000	Move into gaming news
2067000	2069000	But first we'll do some housekeeping
2069000	2071000	So I should say one other thing
2071000	2073000	And this kind of goes to housekeeping too
2073000	2075000	Cheat plug time, you ready? Ready for cheat plug?
2075000	2077000	Yay
2077000	2079000	So one other game I played this week
2079000	2081000	Was the retro-tastic Jumpman Jr.
2081000	2083000	On Commodore 64
2083000	2085000	Which is one of my earliest gaming memories
2085000	2087000	And I played it because I'm toying around with this new project
2087000	2089000	For my YouTube channel
2089000	2091000	So if you want to see me playing
2091000	2093000	A good 20-25 minutes of Jumpman Jr.
2093000	2095000	Go check out my YouTube channel
2095000	2097000	My username over there is RobRobertsPlays
2097000	2099000	All one word
2099000	2101000	You will get my YouTube page to come right up
2101000	2103000	Because I have some other newer stuff
2103000	2105000	Like I did some streaming and typing in the dead
2105000	2107000	That old Slenderman video from a few months ago
2107000	2109000	That's all there
2109000	2111000	But you can check out my Let's Remember series with Jumpman Jr.
2111000	2113000	First video is up
2113000	2115000	I started to do a second video tonight
2115000	2117000	But I couldn't use it because
2117000	2119000	Get this, I was trying to do
2119000	2121000	I don't want to say the game because I'll probably end up doing it later
2121000	2123000	But it was an Atari 2600 game, I'll say that much
2123000	2125000	And when I was recording
2125000	2127000	Because the old Atari 2600 games
2127000	2129000	When there was too much on the screen
2129000	2131000	It would have the flicker
2131000	2133000	So when it was recorded
2133000	2135000	It recorded at just the right frames a second
2135000	2137000	That when I was doing one part of the game
2137000	2139000	My character just disappears in the video
2139000	2141000	So you can't even see it
2141000	2143000	Because of the flicker
2143000	2145000	I'm starting to learn about all that fun stuff
2145000	2147000	But the Jumpman Jr. one looks great
2147000	2149000	So check that out over at YouTube
2149000	2151000	And I will be adding more videos to it
2151000	2153000	I had a really nice response to that first video
2153000	2155000	There are classic games
2155000	2157000	Both mainstream stuff and neglected stuff
2157000	2159000	I'm kind of starting with a bunch of games
2159000	2161000	That don't get talked enough about
2161000	2163000	But I have a shit ton of Commodore 64 stuff
2163000	2165000	I want to play
2165000	2167000	And even older stuff, Atari 2600 and so on
2167000	2169000	Alright
2169000	2171000	Let's get into some other housekeeping
2171000	2173000	Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R

2205000	2207000	They do have a direct impact on that
2207000	2209000	So please, if you enjoy the show
2209000	2211000	We really, really appreciate it
2211000	2213000	Alright, let's get into
2213000	2215000	Some gaming news now
2215000	2217000	It's been a very busy week with the launch of a system
2217000	2219000	And everything, right Loki?
2219000	2221000	Yeah, so
2221000	2223000	As with any console launching
2223000	2225000	There's sometimes hiccups with things
2225000	2227000	One of which is people encountering
2227000	2229000	The blinking blue light
2229000	2231000	Which is a
2231000	2233000	Error indicator
2233000	2235000	It can mean a bunch of different things
2235000	2237000	Including
2237000	2239000	An issue with TV compatibility
2239000	2241000	An issue with the power supply
2241000	2243000	The hard drive, or something else
2243000	2245000	So
2245000	2247000	Yeah, and they kind of
2247000	2249000	Go through some of the things to try
2249000	2251000	Of course, you know
2251000	2253000	Turn it off, turn it back on
2253000	2255000	Number one thing that you do with anything
2255000	2257000	That's mechanical
2257000	2259000	Is reboot
2259000	2261000	Of course, there's
2261000	2263000	One of the things I know that people
2263000	2265000	Are mentioning is sometimes there's an issue
2265000	2267000	Where the HDMI port that they have on there
2267000	2269000	That part of the metal shielding
2269000	2271000	On there is popped up
2271000	2273000	And you have to push it down because your
2273000	2275000	HDMI cable might not go all the way
2275000	2277000	Into the port and make a bad connection
2277000	2279000	Then that
2279000	2281000	You know, causes that wonderful light
2281000	2283000	To pop up as well
2283000	2285000	Or, your hard drive might not be seated properly
2285000	2287000	And you need to go pop that out
2287000	2289000	And maybe put it back in
2289000	2291000	And see if that works
2291000	2293000	So they have a lot of stuff
2293000	2295000	Obviously through Sony's support site
2295000	2297000	You can check it out
2297000	2299000	If you have a problem
2299000	2301000	Or just fucking complain and say
2301000	2303000	Hey, my shit's not working, I just bought this system
2303000	2305000	What the fuck
2305000	2307000	And they'll send you a coffin to
2307000	2309000	Send your system back and fix it
2309000	2311000	But don't do what everybody else does
2311000	2313000	Which is just write an angry post on the internet
2313000	2315000	Because that's not really going to fix anything
2315000	2317000	No
2317000	2319000	So what do you think? I don't know
2319000	2321000	Is it doom and gloom for Sony?
2321000	2323000	No, because they were saying
2323000	2325000	That it's a lot of these issues
2325000	2327000	So far that they've charted
2327000	2329000	As far as people calling it
2329000	2331000	It's only been about
2331000	2333000	You know, was it
2333000	2335000	0.04%
2335000	2337000	Or something like that
2337000	2339000	Of the systems that are out there
2339000	2341000	So that's about like
2341000	2343000	I think we're going to get the numbers later on
2343000	2345000	But it's only a few thousand systems out of
2345000	2347000	About a million systems launched
2347000	2349000	So
2349000	2351000	Yeah, obviously
2351000	2353000	Those people are very vocal
2353000	2355000	So it's making it sound like a larger issue
2355000	2357000	But until
2357000	2359000	It becomes a larger issue
2359000	2361000	Like the Xbox 360 launch
2361000	2363000	That's actually well within
2363000	2365000	Usual
2365000	2367000	Hardware tolerances
2369000	2371000	Here's the thing though
2371000	2373000	Just to play devil's advocate a little bit
2373000	2375000	Didn't the 360 and Microsoft and all that
2375000	2377000	Grossly understate the amount of 360
2377000	2379000	Consoles that were having problems
2379000	2381000	Because I think they said what
2381000	2383000	I don't know, the number was really low
2383000	2385000	And then at one point they said it was 30%
2385000	2387000	Like they went as high as it was
2387000	2389000	But just the people I know
2389000	2391000	It's more like 75%
2391000	2393000	Of those things had problems
2393000	2395000	For real
2395000	2397000	Considering how many consoles I went through
2397000	2399000	On the Xbox 360 and how
2399000	2401000	My Playstation systems
2401000	2403000	1, 2, and 3
2403000	2405000	Not a problem at all
2405000	2407000	I actually took apart my Playstation 3
2407000	2409000	A couple weeks ago
2409000	2411000	When I thought
2411000	2413000	Oh it's pretty hot
2413000	2415000	I'm sure there's a ton of fucking cat hair
2415000	2417000	In there
2417000	2419000	Surprisingly there's no cat hair in there
2419000	2421000	How the fuck did that happen?
2421000	2423000	My computer is full of cat hair
2423000	2425000	But that system for some reason
2425000	2427000	Nothing
2427000	2429000	I don't know what they did to it
2429000	2431000	It's a magic cat hair repellent
2431000	2433000	I've never had a problem with any of the
2433000	2435000	Microsoft would be the one I'd be very wary about
2435000	2437000	Because like I said I went through about 12 systems
2437000	2439000	With them so
2439000	2441000	Yeah I'm a little bit more skeptical
2441000	2443000	With Microsoft hardware
2443000	2445000	But
2445000	2447000	It's not to say that it's
2447000	2449000	Not possible that there is
2449000	2451000	A widespread thing but
2451000	2453000	So far it doesn't seem to be that
2453000	2455000	With the Xbox 360 at launch
2455000	2457000	Everybody was being affected by it
2457000	2459000	You knew someone that had
2459000	2461000	Something go wrong with their system
2461000	2463000	It's very obvious
2463000	2465000	But we'll see
2465000	2467000	Once they just went through
2467000	2469000	And sold a ton of systems
2469000	2471000	We'll see if we start hearing more about this
2471000	2473000	If it's going to be a widespread thing
2473000	2475000	But I don't think it is
2475000	2477000	At the moment
2477000	2479000	Yet another reason I avoid launch
2479000	2481000	Well you know what though
2481000	2483000	I bought my 360 like 4 months after launch
2483000	2485000	And it still wasn't fixed
2485000	2487000	So I worry that if there is a problem
2487000	2489000	It's not going to get fixed overnight
2489000	2491000	Go into our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
2491000	2493000	ShadowNextGen says Loki was
2493000	2495000	One of the lucky ones not to have a Playstation 1
2495000	2497000	Or Playstation 2 without problems
2497000	2499000	Very nice I have a launch 20 gig PS3
2499000	2501000	And it works just fine
2501000	2503000	I'm just hoping that it doesn't crap out someday
2503000	2505000	Because that would suck I've never had a problem
2505000	2507000	With any of my systems except the 360
2507000	2509000	My Playstation 1
2509000	2511000	And Japanese Playstation 2 and American
2511000	2513000	One were fine Well my
2513000	2515000	JPS2 is a launch one too
2515000	2517000	And it's been working just fine perfectly
2517000	2519000	And my PS3 was a launch PS3
2519000	2521000	And it's zero problems
2521000	2523000	You know how apt those were
2523000	2525000	To having issues
2525000	2527000	But we did
2527000	2529000	One of our Xboxes red ringed
2529000	2531000	But we haven't had the problem since
2531000	2533000	And they were still making them under those same specs
2533000	2535000	So
2535000	2537000	I think they've learned their lesson a lot
2537000	2539000	Especially with the red ring thing
2539000	2541000	Was the whole overheating of those chips
2541000	2543000	And technology has gotten so much better
2543000	2545000	In the years now that they're not using
2545000	2547000	30 nanometer chips anymore
2547000	2549000	They're using 20, 30 nanometer chips
2549000	2551000	That are way cooler, way more
2551000	2553000	Energy efficient
2553000	2555000	So running into
2555000	2557000	Heating problems nowadays isn't
2557000	2559000	As much of an issue anymore
2559000	2561000	Because technology has improved
2561000	2563000	So much in the years
2563000	2565000	I think unless
2565000	2567000	Of course you're shoving your system
2567000	2569000	Into a closed look area
2569000	2571000	The red light of doom was one of the ones
2571000	2573000	That people were saying on the
2573000	2575000	PlayStation 4, that's from overheating
2575000	2577000	But
2577000	2579000	I just don't think right now we haven't heard enough
2579000	2581000	To where
2581000	2583000	I think it's widespread yet
2583000	2585000	We'll see, I mean if we hear that there's a ton of people being affected
2585000	2587000	By it or if it's something that
2587000	2589000	It's fine now
2589000	2591000	But like you know
2591000	2593000	Two weeks down the road all of a sudden everyone's systems start dying
2593000	2595000	Then that's something different
2595000	2597000	Alright well
2597000	2599000	Moving on to more talk about
2599000	2601000	PlayStation 4
2601000	2603000	When they released that giant FAQ on Sony's side
2603000	2605000	A few weeks ago
2605000	2607000	Some people were very upset to hear that there was not going to be
2607000	2609000	Any type of playback in the games
2609000	2611000	And that the PlayStation 4 for some weird reason
2611000	2613000	Won't even play CDs
2613000	2615000	I guess CDs are a dying thing
2615000	2617000	Which is ironic because this is Sony
2617000	2619000	Like didn't Sony start the CD player stuff?
2619000	2621000	Like it's kind of weird
2621000	2623000	That their own device wouldn't even play CDs
2623000	2625000	But whatever
2625000	2627000	Anyhow
2627000	2629000	So Sony is hearing the
2629000	2631000	Loud vocal internet people
2631000	2633000	That are bitching a lot about the MP3s
2633000	2635000	Being missing in the CDs and so forth
2635000	2637000	It was in the form of a response
2637000	2639000	From the president of Sony Worldwide Studios
2639000	2641000	Shuhei Yoshida
2641000	2643000	Who said the biggest surprise for us
2643000	2645000	All internally at Sony was that there are so many
2645000	2647000	People who passionately reacted
2647000	2649000	To our announcements that there's no MP3
2649000	2651000	Support or CD support on day one
2651000	2653000	It's not like we actively decided
2653000	2655000	Let's not do this feature so people
2655000	2657000	Will have to subscribe to Music Unlimited
2657000	2659000	Except that's the way I saw it
2659000	2661000	It's interesting that
2661000	2663000	He fires that direct shot
2663000	2665000	There's a lot of people saying that
2665000	2667000	Whether you want
2667000	2669000	I'm just saying believe him or not
2669000	2671000	But he did come out and say we did not
2671000	2673000	Do it because of this
2673000	2675000	Let me finish the quote
2675000	2677000	The focus has been more on the game features
2677000	2679000	Some of the features we wanted
2679000	2681000	But couldn't get in on day one
2681000	2683000	I would like to explain why he did put it out
2683000	2685000	If they said
2685000	2687000	You guys could have had CD MP3 playback
2687000	2689000	But then we wouldn't have had game streaming
2689000	2691000	Or something like that
2691000	2693000	It just sounds
2693000	2695000	Odd
2695000	2697000	That they would just omit this stuff
2697000	2699000	Yet
2699000	2701000	Hey that Music Unlimited service works just fine
2701000	2703000	It's just a little odd
2703000	2705000	Is it working though?
2705000	2707000	Have any of the PlayStation 4 adopters
2707000	2709000	Signed up for Music Unlimited just because
2709000	2711000	They had to hear their Lady Gaga
2711000	2713000	While they're playing?
2713000	2715000	There's a lot of detail in there
2715000	2717000	With all the launch systems
2717000	2719000	One of the things I did like
2719000	2721000	Just kind of reminded me based off that picture
2721000	2723000	Is
2723000	2725000	One of the things I don't even know if they've really been talking about
2725000	2727000	Those controllers have a headphone out on them
2727000	2729000	For game audio
2729000	2731000	Like actual game audio from
2731000	2733000	Your TV
2733000	2735000	Before
2735000	2737000	About a month ago or so
2737000	2739000	I didn't have a wireless headset for my PlayStation 3
2739000	2741000	I just had headphones
2741000	2743000	And that would work fantastic
2743000	2745000	Just being able to
2745000	2747000	Have that audio without having to bug anybody
2747000	2749000	But I thought that was kind of a neat feature
2749000	2751000	That I wish all consoles had
2751000	2753000	It's neat to see that on there
2753000	2755000	But yeah it would be cool
2755000	2757000	If I could play MP3's back
2757000	2759000	Or put MP4's
2759000	2761000	On a jump drive or something
2761000	2763000	And watch them on my system like I can
2763000	2765000	On my PlayStation 3
2765000	2767000	It's kind of dumb that they don't have that
2767000	2769000	But hey if it's something that
2769000	2771000	They can get this out on time
2771000	2773000	And so they just focus on game related features
2773000	2775000	Now and then they're going to add that all in
2775000	2777000	Quarter one next year or something
2777000	2779000	Ok I'm fine with that
2779000	2781000	Yeah he did go on to say
2781000	2783000	As we speak the people in Japan
2783000	2785000	The system guys are discussing
2785000	2787000	When we can put these features in
2787000	2789000	Ok well then it sounds like that's what it is
2789000	2791000	But you know
2791000	2793000	It is a little
2793000	2795000	Perplexing that oh hey Music Unlimited
2795000	2797000	Works
2797000	2799000	You know we couldn't
2799000	2801000	Possibly squeeze out
2801000	2803000	The one programmer
2803000	2805000	That's going to take to implement MP3
2805000	2807000	Playback on
2807000	2809000	I mean come on how fucking hard is it
2809000	2811000	Going to be to implement MP3 Playback
2811000	2813000	On a goddamn PS4
2813000	2815000	I don't think it's going to be that hard to write
2815000	2817000	An MP3 Playback
2817000	2819000	App
2819000	2821000	It just doesn't seem like it would be that difficult
2821000	2823000	I don't know
2823000	2825000	Alright by the way some folks in chat
2825000	2827000	ActDef says
2827000	2829000	Philips did the CD but Sony jumped on the CD quickly too
2829000	2831000	Rama says it was a joint venture
2831000	2833000	Between Philips and Sony
2833000	2835000	I do remember that Philips was heavily involved
2835000	2837000	And Philips had the CDI back in the day
2837000	2839000	So they got into gaming at one point
2839000	2841000	You remember that Sony worked on the
2841000	2843000	Super Nintendo's processor and I believe was supposed to make
2843000	2845000	A CD unit
2845000	2847000	And then like no let's do our own thing
2847000	2849000	I think it was Nintendo didn't want to do it
2849000	2851000	Something to that effect
2851000	2853000	But at any rate Sony took what they
2853000	2855000	Had from having worked with Nintendo
2855000	2857000	And jumped on their own little
2857000	2859000	Bit of the wagon
2859000	2861000	Gaming history y'all
2861000	2863000	Alright well so you'll get
2863000	2865000	To have your or as
2865000	2867000	What is it sg100matt in chat says
2867000	2869000	If I can't listen to Kesha while I'm gaming
2869000	2871000	Then that's a deal breaker
2871000	2873000	You'll get your
2873000	2875000	We are who we are
2875000	2877000	Or whatever songs it is she does
2877000	2879000	You'll get those to play those songs
2879000	2881000	In Need for Speed or whatever soon enough
2881000	2883000	Help because I like Kesha
2885000	2887000	I blame you for showing me that video
2887000	2889000	Oh now the video
2889000	2891000	She did with James Van Der Beek
2891000	2893000	That was great
2893000	2895000	You know I checked out the directors other videos
2895000	2897000	And they are equally as brilliant
2897000	2899000	But I blame you
2901000	2903000	To register participation for this weeks episode of
2903000	2905000	Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com
2905000	2907000	Use the pass phrase hate
2907000	2909000	Let's move on
2909000	2911000	Chakra you're next actually
2911000	2913000	Well how about some wank
2913000	2915000	Wank wank and more wank
2915000	2917000	God damn you blizzard
2917000	2919000	During the show it's gross
2919000	2921000	Blizzard is a bunch of fuckers
2921000	2923000	Why? Because they put out an expansion
2923000	2925000	I'm actually interested in
2925000	2927000	Warlords of Draenor
2927000	2929000	Blah blah blah level 90 blah blah blah
2929000	2931000	I mean actually level 100
2931000	2933000	But they're doing an instant level 90 now
2933000	2935000	With the expansion which I think is stupid
2935000	2937000	But I'll talk about that in a minute
2937000	2939000	So basically you get to go into the past
2939000	2943000	And learn more stuff about the space goats
2943000	2945000	And explore the land of the space goats
2945000	2947000	And hang out with the space goats
2947000	2949000	And hopefully play more space goats
2949000	2951000	Because that was my favorite race
2953000	2955000	I'm glad to hear the Draenei aren't getting
2955000	2957000	Fucked over in this expansion
2957000	2959000	Because in the last couple of expansions
2959000	2961000	They've just been absent
2961000	2963000	Like straight up not a part of it
2963000	2965000	Fuck your pandas
2965000	2967000	Fuck all these other people
2967000	2969000	We're gonna go here and be Russian
2969000	2971000	Or at least sound
2971000	2973000	Like
2973000	2975000	Eastern European accent
2975000	2977000	And honestly I actually
2977000	2979000	They're my favorite race
2979000	2981000	In the entire anything
2981000	2983000	Having to do with Warcraft
2983000	2985000	My first character
2985000	2987000	When I actually decided to play
2987000	2989000	Longer than level 20
2989000	2991000	Was Erisa remember?
2991000	2993000	My arcane mage
2993000	2995000	And I had so much fun with it
2995000	2997000	I played through all of Cataclysm
2997000	2999000	Without any help practically
2999000	3001000	Except for just being in the guild
3001000	3003000	I didn't do dungeons, I didn't craft
3003000	3005000	I didn't discover crafting until like
3005000	3007000	I had already started raiding I think
3007000	3009000	So it was kind of funny
3009000	3013000	But yeah they're boosting level cap to 100
3013000	3015000	And you can instantly upgrade
3015000	3017000	One character to level 90
3017000	3019000	So that you can start
3019000	3021000	Playing the new content
3021000	3023000	Which I would like to see
3023000	3025000	If there are other restrictions
3025000	3027000	On this just because keep in mind
3027000	3029000	People
3029000	3031000	Part of the reason that you level
3031000	3033000	Is to not just
3033000	3035000	Gain the experience and the
3035000	3037000	Abilities of your character in game
3037000	3039000	But so that you learn the mechanics
3039000	3041000	Of your character in game
3041000	3043000	And by learning those mechanics
3043000	3045000	It makes you an overall
3045000	3047000	Better rounded player
3047000	3049000	You know how you fit in
3049000	3051000	Should you decide to do instances
3051000	3053000	Which some are fun, some are not
3053000	3055000	You know but
3055000	3057000	And people will give you unwanted tips
3057000	3059000	On how to play your class
3059000	3061000	Even when you don't give a shit
3061000	3063000	Which assholes
3063000	3065000	We were talking a little bit about this on Horde House
3065000	3067000	Just at that point
3067000	3069000	There's supposed to be some type of like
3069000	3071000	Scenarios or something that help you
3071000	3073000	Like if you're a brand new level one
3073000	3075000	That boosts to 90
3075000	3077000	You get some type of scenario
3077000	3079000	But that's still I don't think gonna be good enough
3079000	3081000	It's an interesting
3081000	3083000	Band-aid
3083000	3085000	You know like even
3085000	3087000	I always kind of like approach that
3087000	3089000	Because I don't play World of Warcraft
3089000	3091000	And I don't know too much about it
3091000	3093000	And this announcement just
3093000	3095000	Nothing, I feel nothing
3095000	3097000	Jumped out and saying hey that looks really cool
3097000	3099000	I just like kind of eh whatever
3099000	3101000	They didn't really do anything to attract
3101000	3103000	New players to be honest
3103000	3105000	Which kind of sounds like a mistake to me
3106000	3108000	And this is the crappy thing because I really
3108000	3110000	Want to play it for the lore
3110000	3112000	You know I really want to
3112000	3114000	See what the new stuff is
3114000	3116000	It's very interesting to me
3116000	3118000	But I just completely dropped
3120000	3122000	World of Warcraft for Final Fantasy
3122000	3124000	And I'm really enjoying Final Fantasy
3124000	3126000	I enjoy not having to rep grind
3126000	3128000	I don't care about doing all the what is it the
3128000	3130000	Titan crap or
3130000	3132000	What's the other stuff that you guys have been doing
3132000	3134000	The primal fights basically
3134000	3136000	I can get those later
3136000	3138000	I haven't had this wild urge
3138000	3140000	To like massively level I've been
3140000	3142000	Able to sit back and enjoy the game
3142000	3144000	And that's kind of what I dug about playing through Cataclysm
3144000	3146000	The first time but then when I got to all the
3146000	3148000	Panda shit I was like it really
3148000	3150000	Was literally steaming piles of panda shit
3150000	3152000	That's all it was
3152000	3154000	Rep grinding, the rep grinding got worse
3154000	3156000	With the freaking pandas
3156000	3158000	And I hated the arena
3158000	3160000	And I hated the Pokemon battle
3160000	3162000	Because it was fine for like a week
3162000	3164000	And I got sick of it
3164000	3166000	But yeah along with this too there of course will be new
3166000	3168000	Zones, dungeons, new raids, scenarios
3168000	3170000	Battlegrounds
3170000	3172000	There's supposed to be improvements like a
3172000	3174000	Reskinned character models
3174000	3176000	And new animation
3176000	3178000	But I hope that they never change the night elf
3178000	3180000	Dance because that shit's funny
3182000	3184000	So you can watch the trailer online it's pretty
3184000	3186000	I
3186000	3188000	Part of me just does not want to give a shit
3188000	3190000	The other part of me is like
3190000	3192000	Goats
3192000	3194000	You know I'm not super into
3194000	3196000	World war class lore I never have been
3196000	3198000	Which is funny you know with the podcast and everything
3198000	3200000	But I was always more about the social aspect
3200000	3202000	And the garrison sounds really neat
3202000	3204000	The whole player cities
3204000	3206000	Or whatever sound really neat
3206000	3208000	Well it almost sounds like they're trying to give a nod back to
3208000	3210000	The original Warcraft games
3210000	3212000	Because you pretty much had your
3212000	3214000	Own towns and your defensible areas
3214000	3216000	You know when you did places
3216000	3218000	That's a good point
3218000	3220000	The other thing that's just really
3220000	3222000	I'm wondering
3222000	3224000	The updates I think
3224000	3226000	As far as characters and animation
3226000	3228000	Are necessary
3228000	3230000	They are long overdue
3230000	3232000	And I realize they've been trying to cater to people
3232000	3234000	On older systems that might not be able to
3234000	3236000	Keep up with it but at the same
3236000	3238000	Time I think that keeping like
3238000	3240000	A window of about maybe
3240000	3242000	Five years worth of
3242000	3244000	Computer
3244000	3246000	What's the word I'm trying to think of
3246000	3248000	Being friendly to older systems
3248000	3250000	Is a safe bet rather than
3250000	3252000	How long has the game been out now like what
3252000	3254000	Oh nine years almost
3254000	3256000	And they were still catering to people
3256000	3258000	From computers still on
3258000	3260000	I mean I was playing
3260000	3262000	Whatever you had
3262000	3264000	Installed on your
3264000	3266000	Macbook
3266000	3268000	I was playing that stuff on your
3268000	3270000	Macbook and it was still
3270000	3272000	Just fine
3272000	3274000	So I mean
3274000	3276000	I don't know I really
3276000	3278000	Really really really
3278000	3280000	Want to see the new stuff
3280000	3282000	It's just I don't know if it's so
3282000	3284000	Worth it to me I've been well you know I read
3284000	3286000	All the books that came out during
3286000	3288000	Cataclysm I got all of those books
3288000	3290000	I love the freaking thrall book I didn't read the Jaina
3290000	3292000	Book though because I'm just pissed off about what they did to her
3292000	3294000	I mean I hate how her
3294000	3296000	Character has become she used to be like one of my favorites
3296000	3298000	Even though I made fun of her
3298000	3300000	But because I do have a character named
3300000	3302000	Jaina
3302000	3304000	Who I made look like her
3304000	3306000	But other than that
3306000	3308000	I can
3308000	3310000	Get the lore stuff from my friends or I can
3310000	3312000	Get it on YouTube I watched the whole ending
3312000	3314000	Of the Garrosh bullshit
3314000	3316000	On YouTube
3316000	3318000	Yeah oh there's two versions right? I've watched both of them
3318000	3320000	No I'm
3320000	3322000	Mildly surprised but not
3322000	3324000	Majorly I just like Jaina shut up
3324000	3326000	Your trauma's showing
3326000	3328000	Granted
3328000	3330000	It's well earned trauma but still
3330000	3332000	I don't want to repeat myself too much
3332000	3334000	From Wednesday's word house but some of my co-hosts
3334000	3336000	Really got into how they
3336000	3338000	Feel that this is being charged for a patch
3338000	3340000	That a lot of this stuff should have been
3340000	3342000	Taken care of in a patch
3342000	3344000	But I said that you know I'm
3344000	3346000	Really looking forward to five man's coming back
3346000	3348000	Thank god because I've been really pissed
3348000	3350000	Off that Pandaria neglected them
3350000	3352000	And that's probably the reason I'm not playing right now
3352000	3354000	It's because I really can't fucking stand LFR
3354000	3356000	And but
3356000	3358000	Five man's you can tolerate it's much easier
3358000	3360000	When it's five people versus twenty five
3360000	3362000	It's something about that social dynamic
3362000	3364000	But I am really jazzed to hear about these
3364000	3366000	Rating changes where now you can
3366000	3368000	LFR with eleven people
3368000	3370000	So if you can put a group together and
3370000	3372000	You know when I say eleven that's an arbitrary
3372000	3374000	Number between ten and twenty five
3374000	3376000	You can now do LFR difficulty with
3376000	3378000	A pre-established group of like eleven twelve people
3378000	3380000	Everything flexes now
3380000	3382000	And for the hardcore players they're getting a new
3382000	3384000	Difficulty called mythic rating
3384000	3386000	That's all twenty man that's it no more tens and
3386000	3388000	Twenty fives twenty man
3388000	3390000	That part's cool
3390000	3392000	I do actually miss the rating but you know
3392000	3394000	The big crappy part of it was at the end
3394000	3396000	Was that I like to
3396000	3398000	Chat with all my friends you know
3398000	3400000	In the guild
3400000	3402000	And it just sort of got to be a ghost
3402000	3404000	Town sort of I mean I was fine doing all the
3404000	3406000	Stuff by myself it's a you can easily
3406000	3408000	Play through anything in
3408000	3410000	World of Warcraft as a solo game
3410000	3412000	Right and it's the actually
3412000	3414000	That's one advantage it has over Final Fantasy
3414000	3416000	Fourteen to me because you have to
3416000	3418000	Have other people to do the
3418000	3420000	The duty
3420000	3422000	Things like what's
3422000	3424000	The like the dungeons
3424000	3426000	The dungeons yeah you have to do those yeah
3426000	3428000	I like the better that they're four people
3428000	3430000	And not five but still it's
3432000	3434000	I liked having the option of
3434000	3436000	Me being able to do this shit by myself and
3436000	3438000	Then going back and doing
3438000	3440000	Dungeons alone
3440000	3442000	So that I could see what they were like because you know
3442000	3444000	That's how I was farming for
3444000	3446000	And you can't do that
3446000	3448000	In Final Fantasy Fourteen because it level sinks you
3448000	3450000	Exactly which is you know
3450000	3452000	It's good and bad
3452000	3454000	So yeah pluses and minuses
3454000	3456000	I don't know for right now there's
3456000	3458000	As much as I
3458000	3460000	Really really want to see the new content
3460000	3462000	I can't justify it so
3462000	3464000	Well we don't even know the date anyway so you have a long time
3464000	3466000	To make up your mind
3466000	3468000	So if Final Fantasy Fourteen turns crusty and old then maybe I'll be back
3468000	3470000	Which it might and Blizzard's probably
3470000	3472000	Banking on that a little bit so we'll see
3472000	3474000	Alright moving on
3474000	3476000	Loki
3476000	3478000	So let's talk a little bit
3478000	3480000	About the
3480000	3482000	Let's go back and talk about gold
3482000	3484000	As I mentioned before
3484000	3486000	You know there's the Xbox Live
3486000	3488000	Games with Gold thing that you get
3488000	3490000	Some free games and originally
3490000	3492000	It was oh hey we're gonna like
3492000	3494000	Stop it you know once
3494000	3496000	Xbox One comes out and everyone's like
3496000	3498000	Why the fuck aren't you just continuing
3498000	3500000	That well now they're like well hey we're gonna
3500000	3502000	We're gonna do it again and uh
3502000	3504000	We're gonna keep it going through
3504000	3506000	2014 and we're gonna include
3506000	3508000	Xbox One games on a monthly basis
3508000	3510000	Which makes me
3510000	3512000	Believe that that's
3512000	3514000	Probably gonna be digital games
3514000	3516000	Cause I don't see them
3516000	3518000	Giving away
3518000	3520000	Well I could see them giving away
3520000	3522000	Rise cause that game looks like crap but
3522000	3524000	There's no way they're giving away retail games for the first year
3524000	3526000	Or for at least six months
3526000	3528000	Probably a lot of download stuff
3528000	3530000	So yeah it'll be a while
3530000	3532000	But um hey
3532000	3534000	Still though it's good to see that that's gonna be continuing
3534000	3536000	On I would not be surprised
3536000	3538000	Though even if they did retail games
3538000	3540000	That that doesn't change to be more like
3540000	3542000	The Playstation Network program where
3542000	3544000	You have to continue being a live member
3544000	3546000	In order to I mean cause come on they
3546000	3548000	Put everything else behind the fucking paywall
3548000	3550000	What makes you think that they're all of a sudden gonna just
3550000	3552000	Continue on with oh sure are we generous
3552000	3554000	To give you free games that you can have forever
3554000	3556000	Nah nah this is Microsoft
3556000	3558000	Sony's doing it and people
3558000	3560000	Are happy with it they're gonna do it too
3564000	3566000	Um I guess
3566000	3568000	Yeah I'm excited to go
3568000	3570000	In there and see what they're gonna give away on 360
3570000	3572000	And maybe flag some of the
3572000	3574000	Games but at the same time my
3574000	3576000	Account's coming up for renewal
3576000	3578000	Soon I don't know if I'm gonna do it
3578000	3580000	Cause I'm just like there's really nothing
3580000	3582000	I'm playing online on 360 anymore
3582000	3584000	I've been playing Mass Effect 3 pretty heavily for a while
3584000	3586000	But now most of the people I play with are on PC
3586000	3588000	And we haven't really done
3588000	3590000	Forzen forever and
3590000	3592000	There's really not a lot to play on 360 right now
3592000	3594000	Even on PS to be fair on Playstation 3
3594000	3596000	There's not a lot I play online either it's all PC
3596000	3598000	Or really nothing
3598000	3600000	It's all free now so I mean it's free
3600000	3602000	True
3602000	3604000	Mine's renewing soon too but I do
3604000	3606000	Play quite a bit on 360
3606000	3608000	So I'll probably keep mine but
3608000	3610000	You know it
3610000	3612000	The free games aren't really
3612000	3614000	A benefit right now it's just kinda like
3614000	3616000	Oh cool old ass shit I don't
3616000	3618000	Want anyways but I'll take it
3618000	3620000	Because you're giving it to me for free
3620000	3622000	You know it's like I already have Halo
3622000	3624000	Or I already have Crackdown but
3624000	3626000	Now I have a digital version of it
3626000	3628000	Fable 3 another one
3628000	3630000	Oh fantastic
3630000	3632000	Fable 3 was kinda crap anyway
3632000	3634000	Alright let's move on
3634000	3636000	Nintendo put out a bit of news
3636000	3638000	This week they did another one of their
3638000	3640000	Nintendo Directs which is how they get the news out
3640000	3642000	These days taking their case
3642000	3644000	Directly to their fans and
3644000	3646000	Cutting out all the skeptics in between
3646000	3648000	This is the news that came out
3648000	3650000	On their Direct on November 13th
3650000	3652000	A release date for Mario Party Island Tour
3652000	3654000	In Europe that will be January even though we're
3654000	3656000	Getting that next week right? Sorry Europe
3656000	3658000	You gotta wait till the new year
3658000	3660000	The 3DS will be getting YouTube
3660000	3662000	Which is kinda one of those things they announced it and I went
3662000	3664000	It's not already there and I
3664000	3666000	Oh yeah it's really not already there so
3666000	3668000	Finally YouTube on the 3DS
3668000	3670000	Grasping the internet
3670000	3672000	Which by the way let me throw this out there
3672000	3674000	See what the live chatters think I was gonna keep this a
3674000	3676000	Secret but what the hell
3676000	3678000	I'm thinking about putting OLR episodes up in full
3678000	3680000	On YouTube and no this will not involve
3680000	3682000	Video but just like a static picture
3682000	3684000	While you have because now you don't have to break
3684000	3686000	Things up into 15 minutes anymore so you just do 3 hours
3686000	3688000	And my
3688000	3690000	Big problem right now I can't get in the Orange
3690000	3692000	Zaun's radio account so I need Jason's help
3692000	3694000	Getting me back in there I don't remember how to get in
3694000	3696000	They switched YouTube so many times now
3696000	3698000	With the integration I can't log into the account
3698000	3700000	So hopefully Jason can figure it out or he might be
3700000	3702000	Screwed I'm gonna have to get a new name but I am thinking about
3702000	3704000	Putting up episodes in full on
3704000	3706000	YouTube which when I hear things like
3706000	3708000	This like oh YouTube on the 3DS
3708000	3710000	I go oh that would be really cool
3710000	3712000	Because people can't like
3712000	3714000	Download MP3's on their
3714000	3716000	DS or at least I don't think they can right
3716000	3718000	That's not really a thing you can't like do podcasts
3718000	3720000	On a 3DS otherwise yeah I think it does have a
3720000	3722000	Sound player but I'm not sure if it's
3722000	3724000	MP3's or if it's like
3724000	3726000	MPA or that
3726000	3728000	iTunes format or whatever it is
3728000	3730000	Regardless you can't do podcasts we know that
3730000	3732000	Even though the PSP did that website on the
3732000	3734000	PSP that did it you can't really do it easy
3734000	3736000	So that is something we're toying with
3736000	3738000	So that's really cool to hear that YouTube
3738000	3740000	Will be on the 3DS so that you know
3740000	3742000	For whatever it is on YouTube you want to look at
3742000	3744000	And YouTube on the 3DS
3744000	3746000	I believe that there is a YouTube
3746000	3748000	Player for the Playstation 4 as well
3748000	3750000	So there you go
3750000	3752000	Hey it's all over the place there you go
3752000	3754000	Alright um other things
3754000	3756000	3DS and Wii U
3756000	3758000	There's going to be a system update for both
3758000	3760000	And finally the eShops will be
3760000	3762000	Combined thank god it's about
3762000	3764000	Time right they're going to combine the
3764000	3766000	eShops not the games
3766000	3768000	Sorry but the account balances
3768000	3770000	Will be one and the same so the good news
3770000	3772000	Is if you have like 23 cents sitting
3772000	3774000	In your wallet on 3DS and like you know
3774000	3776000	23 cents on your all that leftover
3776000	3778000	Change you'll be able to combine it
3778000	3780000	Yay buy something
3780000	3782000	And not have that leftover change anymore
3782000	3784000	DLC coming to
3784000	3786000	Pikmin 3
3786000	3788000	DLC worked out pretty well for Mario Wii U
3788000	3790000	Last year with the Super Luigi Brothers
3790000	3792000	So it will be interesting to see what comes to the
3792000	3794000	Pikmin 3 DLC
3794000	3796000	Bravely Default comes to the US on
3796000	3798000	February 7th
3798000	3800000	Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy
3800000	3802000	Comes out in North America on February 28th
3802000	3804000	And there is a new
3804000	3806000	Hero mode in Zelda A Link Between
3806000	3808000	Worlds and
3808000	3810000	There's also something
3810000	3812000	About and I'm not finding here Miiverse
3812000	3814000	On 3DS but I know we have a
3814000	3816000	Kind of a follow up on that in a little bit here
3816000	3818000	So I'll wait for that but one other
3818000	3820000	Big thing I wanted to mention here is Super Mario 3D
3820000	3822000	World the rumors
3822000	3824000	From a couple weeks ago that Rosalina is going to be
3824000	3826000	A playable character turned out to be true
3826000	3828000	You will not only have your classic
3828000	3830000	Mario Brothers 2 characters meaning
3830000	3832000	Mario, Luigi, Toad and Princess Toadstool
3832000	3834000	But Rosalina will be unlocked
3834000	3836000	And she does like a little
3836000	3838000	Spin attack type thing
3838000	3840000	So she will be available in Super Mario
3840000	3842000	3D World I missed what the
3842000	3844000	Qualifications were to unlock her
3844000	3846000	I want to say that if you had like a
3846000	3848000	Save file from the old game you get it right away
3848000	3850000	No no that's um
3850000	3852000	If you have Super Luigi Brothers you get the
3852000	3854000	Classic Mario Brothers
3854000	3856000	Reskinned into Luigi Brothers you get
3856000	3858000	That but
3858000	3860000	Yeah that's really cool Rosalina is another character there
3860000	3862000	So hooray
3862000	3864000	Yeah I'm very excited about Mario
3864000	3866000	3D World
3866000	3868000	I'm glad
3868000	3870000	Yay excitement
3870000	3872000	Alright DarkSakura what do you have for us
3872000	3874000	Well speaking of
3874000	3876000	3DS stuff Miiverse
3876000	3878000	Has got a few restrictions on it that may
3878000	3880000	Not please people
3880000	3882000	It's the Wii U social network
3882000	3884000	That they're doing
3884000	3886000	It's going to be out on 3DS in December
3886000	3888000	But they are not going to allow
3888000	3890000	Private messages or
3890000	3892000	Friend requests they don't have those
3892000	3894000	Features basically I think
3894000	3896000	That's kind of going along with what
3896000	3898000	Happened with
3898000	3900000	Not PictoChat
3900000	3902000	Swapnote
3902000	3904000	To avoid
3904000	3906000	You know getting out anything
3906000	3908000	That may not be safe for little kitties
3908000	3910000	And you know
3910000	3912000	An easily offendable adult
3912000	3914000	So it's
3914000	3916000	They're still
3916000	3918000	Going to be able to use this for
3918000	3920000	Consolidating their eShop
3920000	3922000	Balances like you were saying
3922000	3924000	And
3924000	3926000	But they can leave
3926000	3928000	Comments about games
3928000	3930000	There's a sort of a bulletin board thing about that
3930000	3932000	But you're not going to be able to
3932000	3934000	Do the actual private
3934000	3936000	Message person to person
3936000	3938000	Cause there might be a penis
3938000	3940000	If you allow that
3940000	3942000	You know what
3942000	3944000	If they're allowing you to put comments on a bulletin
3944000	3946000	Board it is very
3946000	3948000	Easy to do an ASCII cock
3948000	3950000	Yeah but Miiverse is moderated
3950000	3952000	That stuff gets poor
3952000	3954000	It'll be on there for 5 seconds Rob
3954000	3956000	That's right somebody might see it in 5 seconds
3956000	3958000	Someone will see the penis
3958000	3960000	They will touch it they will love it
3960000	3962000	With their little stylus
3962000	3964000	Boop it
3964000	3966000	Boop it
3966000	3968000	Boop the penis
3968000	3970000	Boop
3970000	3972000	Oh I thought you meant to say boppet
3972000	3974000	Like I'm thinking about those old like
3974000	3976000	Boppet twist it throw it
3976000	3978000	Turn it
3978000	3980000	I saw one of those at the thrift store the other day and some kid was playing with it
3980000	3982000	And was like this toy
3982000	3984000	Sucks
3984000	3986000	I was like that's what we thought
3986000	3988000	When it came out
3988000	3990000	Didn't they make like boppet for the Nintendo Wii
3990000	3992000	Am I crazy or wasn't there like actually
3992000	3994000	A boppet game
3994000	3996000	No there wasn't a boppet game
3996000	3998000	There was like Jenga
3998000	4000000	They had a few Jenga games
4000000	4002000	And I was like what the
4002000	4004000	That's dumb
4004000	4006000	People can barely play Jenga in real life
4006000	4008000	No I guess there was
4008000	4010000	There was a family game night
4010000	4012000	That came out
4012000	4014000	That boppet I guess
4014000	4016000	Why did I think there was a boppet game
4016000	4018000	Because that would be a retarded enough idea
4018000	4020000	Where they might do something like that
4020000	4022000	I mean they made Jenga
4022000	4024000	Wow really S2 under Matt says there's a boppet TV show
4024000	4026000	I didn't know that
4026000	4028000	Why?
4028000	4030000	I had no idea
4030000	4032000	If it was like chicks topless
4032000	4034000	And dudes pantsless playing
4034000	4036000	Bop it
4036000	4038000	That might be the reason to watch the TV show right
4038000	4040000	Fair enough
4040000	4042000	Maybe
4042000	4044000	Cinemax needs to get in on the boppet TV show
4044000	4046000	Bop it
4046000	4048000	Twist it
4048000	4050000	Turn it
4050000	4052000	Touch it
4052000	4054000	I'm sorry you were talking about
4054000	4056000	I don't like where this shows going
4056000	4058000	You were talking about pantsless guys
4058000	4060000	Hilarious mental imagery
4060000	4062000	Equal opportunity
4062000	4064000	If you gotta have topless chicks
4064000	4066000	But I imagine that male dangly bits look a lot more hilarious
4066000	4068000	Than boobs bouncing
4068000	4070000	Alright
4070000	4072000	Moving on
4072000	4074000	I don't like where this shows going
4074000	4076000	It's going to a dark place
4076000	4078000	Let's go to release dates

4240000	4242000	That's it
4242000	4244000	And then it officially dies to nothing
4244000	4246000	I was gonna say last big week of the year
4246000	4248000	It goes into a coma for the next
4248000	4250000	Two months
4250000	4252000	Last big week of the year because then
4252000	4254000	After that you've got Black Friday
4254000	4256000	And that's when all the stuff is supposed to be out by
4256000	4258000	Well actually there's like
4258000	4260000	The first week in December you've got
4260000	4262000	Gran Turismo 6
4262000	4264000	And then it literally
4264000	4266000	There is nothing
4266000	4268000	Well the South Park game was supposed to be there
4268000	4270000	Yeah the South Park was supposed to be on the 10th

4276000	4278000	That's coming out on the Vita
4278000	4280000	And then January there's literally
4280000	4282000	The disc version of Wii Fit U
4282000	4284000	The pedometer and you want to buy
4284000	4286000	The disc version of the game
4286000	4288000	And then the bundle with the
4288000	4290000	Balance board
4290000	4292000	And Dragon Ball Z Battle for Z on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360
4292000	4294000	That's it
4294000	4296000	That's literally everything between now and January
4296000	4298000	And February
4298000	4300000	It's like nothing
4300000	4302000	This segment will go by quickly
4302000	4304000	What's coming out?
4304000	4306000	Nothing
4306000	4308000	Let's see go into our chatroom at
4308000	4310000	Live.vognetwork.com
4310000	4312000	I'm all over that shit
4312000	4314000	Cause I'm a classy bitch
4314000	4316000	You and me both Cody
4316000	4318000	By the way speaking of classy bitch
4318000	4320000	I want to thank Alan for bringing me the wine
4320000	4322000	To drink during the show
4322000	4324000	Can I smell it? Yes you may
4324000	4326000	You could have a little taste if you want
4326000	4328000	I don't know if it's against your
4328000	4330000	What you can and can't eat right now
4330000	4332000	You know what I have to try that stuff that Victoria told me about
4332000	4334000	The Fravolo?
4334000	4336000	Yeah
4336000	4338000	I need some of that in my life
4338000	4340000	Actually we're looking at going out to the winery in a couple weeks
4340000	4342000	To do that
4342000	4344000	Kidnap me. I don't know if Lady Victoria will be here
4344000	4346000	But she hasn't been on the show in forever
4346000	4348000	She was on like one show in the old studio
4348000	4350000	None of the listeners here probably know her
4350000	4352000	We need to kidnap her. We do
4352000	4354000	Victoria would be great on this show
4354000	4356000	Because she's a wow widow
4356000	4358000	In one of her relationships many years ago
4358000	4360000	The guy cared about World of Warcraft
4360000	4362000	More than her
4362000	4364000	And so she's got all these stories about how much she hates
4364000	4366000	The storming the castle game
4366000	4368000	I've wanted to get her on Horde House because of that
4368000	4370000	But anyway, I digress
4370000	4372000	Let's talk about Japanese release dates
4372000	4374000	On the Playstation 4 this week
4374000	4376000	You guys don't get the Playstation 4 until February
4376000	4378000	I'm so mean. Why did I say that?
4378000	4380000	Well actually
4380000	4382000	I will bring this around because
4382000	4384000	I kind of think that whole
4384000	4386000	Delay in Japan kind of plays
4386000	4388000	Into part of the reason why I'm not feeling
4388000	4390000	The Playstation 4 here right now
4390000	4392000	Because I think a lot of stuff isn't coming out
4392000	4394000	Until Japan has the Playstation 4
4394000	4396000	So I think that plays into it more
4396000	4398000	Than we might want to admit here in the US
4398000	4400000	I don't know, but anyway
4400000	4402000	That just kind of was a little reminder there
4402000	4404000	As I was looking at the release dates
4404000	4406000	Oh yeah, Japan didn't have all this craziness that we had here this week
4406000	4408000	With Playstation 4
4408000	4410000	However, on the Playstation 3
4410000	4412000	Still kicking this week in Japan
4412000	4414000	Hey, if you're mad at me about what I said about the Playstation 4
4414000	4416000	You can get your revenge this week
4416000	4418000	With Lightning Returns Final Fantasy 13
4418000	4420000	I really want that game
4420000	4422000	I can't play it until like February
4422000	4424000	It takes me revenge because after the last one
4424000	4426000	It might be just like
4426000	4428000	I thought Final Fantasy 13 2 was good
4428000	4430000	It was good
4430000	4432000	Whatever
4432000	4434000	Final Fantasy 13 Lightning Returns
4434000	4436000	It'll be interesting, we'll say that much one way or the other
4436000	4438000	That is out in Japan this week on the Playstation 3
4438000	4440000	Hanasaku Mani Mani also comes out
4440000	4442000	Monster Hunter Frontier G
4442000	4444000	In like a beginners package
4444000	4446000	Is out this week as well
4446000	4448000	In Japan
4448000	4450000	Need for Speed Rivals makes its way to Japan as well
4450000	4454000	And Shin Atelier Rorona Hajimari no Morgatari
4454000	4456000	The Alchemist of Arland
4456000	4458000	Comes out this week on Playstation 3
4458000	4460000	As well
4460000	4462000	There's also by the way like a special
4462000	4464000	Ultimate box for Lightning Returns
4464000	4466000	I guess that's some type of collector's edition I didn't really read up on
4466000	4468000	Because I don't plan on importing it
4468000	4472000	On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan
4472000	4474000	Looking there real quick

4498000	4500000	Damn the Wii U for not being region-free
4500000	4502000	Damn it because I would so import that game
4502000	4504000	I love Taiko no Tatujin
4504000	4506000	It's so cute
4506000	4508000	It still had the inflatable drum
4508000	4510000	Although it probably doesn't
4510000	4512000	It probably uses the touchpad and the stylus
4512000	4514000	Oh no I guess they're selling a bundle set
4514000	4516000	That has a Taiko with it
4516000	4518000	And a bocce
4518000	4520000	They don't have a picture of what it looks like
4520000	4522000	Oh there it is
4522000	4524000	There's a tiny tiny little picture of it
4524000	4526000	I love the little Taiko on the thing
4526000	4528000	They're so cute
4528000	4530000	And they look like kitty faces
4530000	4532000	I want to take one of the little
4532000	4534000	I have a Taiko plushie
4534000	4536000	And I wanted to put kitty ears on it
4536000	4538000	Just because it looks like cat faces
4538000	4540000	So cute
4540000	4542000	On the Nintendo 3DS
4542000	4544000	This week in Japan

4576000	4578000	Don't worry
4578000	4580000	Mama will fix it
4580000	4582000	And Cooking Mama 5 out this week in Japan
4582000	4584000	I'm glad Mama's going back to her roots
4584000	4586000	After all that gardening shit
4586000	4588000	What the hell else did Mama fix?
4588000	4590000	What were all those spinoff games?
4590000	4592000	I know there was Gardening Mama
4592000	4594000	I thought there was one other one
4594000	4596000	There's Crafting Mama
4596000	4598000	Babysitting Mama
4598000	4600000	Remember with the creepy one

4602000	4604000	It's ass
4604000	4606000	I remember that
4606000	4608000	There was Crafting Mama
4608000	4610000	Gardening Mama
4610000	4612000	Babysitting Mama
4612000	4614000	And then 3 or 4 Cooking Mamas
4614000	4616000	Alright
4616000	4618000	There you go
4618000	4620000	By AkumaJP in our chatroom
4620000	4622000	I have no problem understanding that
4622000	4624000	Good job
4624000	4626000	Yay I pronounced at least one of those games correctly
4626000	4628000	12 years
4628000	4630000	Will do a lot
4630000	4632000	Never had a class believe it or not
4632000	4634000	Let's go around for the
4634000	4636000	UK releases Dark Sakura
4636000	4638000	There were a few things
4638000	4640000	Actually a few things coming out
4640000	4642000	It's a pretty long list
4642000	4644000	So I'm just going to start from the 19th
4644000	4646000	We have on the 19th NBA Live 14

4654000	4656000	FIFA 14
4656000	4658000	Madden XL
4658000	4660000	I got the 3DS thing on the head
4660000	4662000	Madden NFL 25
4662000	4664000	And Shiva Kosher Edition
4664000	4666000	Wait
4666000	4668000	I need to check this out
4668000	4670000	Then on the 22nd
4670000	4672000	Angry Birds Star Wars
4672000	4674000	Assassin's Creed 4
4674000	4676000	Basically all the new release stuff
4676000	4678000	The system release stuff
4678000	4680000	So there's Crimson Dragon, Dead Rising 3
4680000	4682000	Connect Sports Rivals
4682000	4684000	Preseason, Need for Speed Rivals
4684000	4686000	Blah blah blah
4686000	4688000	Tearaway
4688000	4690000	Legend of Zelda, Link Between Worlds, Watch Dogs
4690000	4692000	Young Justice Legacy
4692000	4694000	Power Star Golf and Zoo Tycoon
4696000	4698000	Alright, that's it
4698000	4700000	Yarp
4700000	4702000	Busy busy week, that segment is going to slow down
4702000	4704000	In the coming weeks
4704000	4706000	Have fun with all the games
4706000	4708000	There's a lot to choose from
4708000	4710000	It's a great time to be a gamer
4710000	4712000	No matter what system it is you're backing right now
4712000	4714000	Or if it's several, lots of great stuff to look forward to
4714000	4716000	And PC gamers
4716000	4718000	Not leaving you guys out because
4718000	4720000	There's that rumored Steam sale coming right after Thanksgiving
4720000	4722000	There's a fall sale and then there's an
4722000	4724000	Actual
4724000	4726000	Xmas or holiday sale
4726000	4728000	Prepare your wallets
4728000	4730000	Winter is coming
4730000	4732000	Winter Sale is coming
4732000	4734000	Alright
4734000	4736000	Let's do a few more news stories
4736000	4738000	And then the classic game of the week, Loki
4738000	4740000	So Nintendo has actually
4740000	4742000	Purchased some stake in
4742000	4744000	I guess this company
4744000	4746000	Dwango
4746000	4748000	Dwango owns Nico Nico
4748000	4750000	Which is a video
4750000	4752000	Delivery service
4752000	4754000	And I guess
4754000	4756000	Maybe they're planning on
4756000	4758000	Using that to
4758000	4760000	I don't know, either deliver
4760000	4762000	Games or
4762000	4764000	No idea
4764000	4766000	But it's interesting
4766000	4768000	To see that they
4768000	4770000	Purchase
4770000	4772000	612,000 shares
4772000	4774000	So
4774000	4776000	Interesting, web services
4776000	4778000	It's a web service company that provides
4778000	4780000	Content through mobile phones
4780000	4782000	I don't know if that means
4782000	4784000	Streaming videos or something
4784000	4786000	Interesting that they're getting involved
4786000	4788000	Hmmm
4788000	4790000	Tinfoil hat
4790000	4792000	Tinfoil hat time
4792000	4794000	Could this be a clue
4794000	4796000	Just buying stock in the company doesn't necessarily mean
4796000	4798000	It's not buying the company
4798000	4800000	Could this be a clue
4800000	4802000	About where Nintendo wants to go
4802000	4804000	With their next handheld system
4804000	4806000	Not going to say that they're going to make it a phone
4806000	4808000	Because I don't think that's correct
4808000	4810000	But maybe something about
4810000	4812000	What if it
4812000	4814000	Could get data
4814000	4816000	I think it's like an iPad
4816000	4818000	It does 4G and it does streaming video
4818000	4820000	That's the one thing we didn't really see
4820000	4822000	On the 3DS that I thought we would
4822000	4824000	Like I know it's got Netflix and that stuff
4824000	4826000	Well they had that at first
4826000	4828000	Remember they were going to do 3D movies on there
4828000	4830000	Yeah, whatever happened to that
4830000	4832000	They kind of fizzled out I guess
4832000	4834000	I remember when they were showing the demos
4834000	4836000	The very first E3 or whatever
4836000	4838000	I think they had the trailer for Tangled
4838000	4840000	Was the one thing we saw in 3D
4840000	4842000	On the 3DS
4842000	4844000	An animated movie that was in there
4844000	4846000	And Tron was like something I was like, fuck yeah
4846000	4848000	They need to put Tron and 3D out on the 3DS
4848000	4850000	But that never happened, it fizzled
4850000	4852000	Maybe not enough demand
4852000	4854000	Could there be a hint there
4854000	4856000	If this is some type of streaming service
4856000	4858000	Could there be some type of movie thing
4858000	4860000	Being built into the next DS
4860000	4862000	I'm totally tinfoil-hatting
4862000	4864000	But I don't, I mean
4864000	4866000	The 3D movie thing sounded cool
4866000	4868000	But now that they're getting away from 3D
4868000	4870000	I don't know
4870000	4874000	It's true because maybe 3D isn't going to be such a big deal
4874000	4876000	WhatupG even agrees with you there
4876000	4878000	I think Nintendo's next handheld will be 2D
4878000	4882000	That comment from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
4882000	4884000	Alright
4884000	4886000	We'll see if anything comes of my tinfoil-hatting
4886000	4888000	This will be happening for sure though
4888000	4890000	Heroes of the Storm
4890000	4892000	Was another game that Blizzard announced at BlizzCon
4892000	4894000	I'm excited about this
4894000	4896000	I'm not super into MOBAs
4896000	4898000	But even though I'm terrible at them
4898000	4900000	I've tried to play them and they are fun
4900000	4902000	League of Legends and Dota 2
4902000	4904000	This is Blizzard's answer to that whole craze
4904000	4906000	Because after all, one of the first MOBAs
4906000	4908000	Defense of the Ancients
4908000	4910000	An add-on for Warcraft 3
4910000	4912000	So it kind of, in a way, started with a Blizzard game
4912000	4914000	But obviously spun out in all these different directions
4914000	4916000	Heroes of the Storm
4916000	4918000	The beta sign-ups are available
4918000	4920000	So if there's something you're interested in beta testing
4920000	4922000	You don't have to be an active WoW player
4922000	4924000	Or anything like that
4924000	4926000	You just have to have a battle.net account
4926000	4928000	And you can update your beta preferences
4928000	4930000	For Heroes of the Storm
4930000	4932000	So that's something I know I did right away
4932000	4934000	But if you guys are interested in this
4934000	4936000	Don't forget to update your battle.net accounts for the same thing
4936000	4938000	Now, they announced
4938000	4940000	Some of the heroes that are going to be in the game
4940000	4942000	And I have to admit
4942000	4944000	Even though cinematic trailers kind of bother me
4944000	4946000	Because you literally see none of the game
4946000	4948000	In these Blizzard cinematic trailers
4948000	4950000	As far as fan wank goes
4950000	4952000	It was pretty awesome
4952000	4954000	To see all these characters just out and outright
4954000	4956000	And each other here
4956000	4958000	Did you see this cinematic trailer they were doing for Heroes of the Storm
4958000	4960000	That had some of these bad guys
4960000	4962000	And good guys in it all kind of coming together
4962000	4964000	It was pretty neat
4964000	4966000	To see everybody in that one video
4966000	4968000	But I noticed, the first thing I said
4968000	4970000	Is I said, where are the lost Vikings?
4970000	4972000	Exactly, they're still hanging out in that cave
4972000	4974000	I looked at this trailer
4974000	4976000	And I said, where are the lost Vikings?
4976000	4978000	It's like an old school Blizzard property
4978000	4980000	A lot of people remember, right?
4980000	4982000	Well apparently I'm not the only one
4982000	4984000	Who came out this week
4984000	4986000	During Blizzcon
4986000	4988000	While Dustin Browder, who's a Blizzard game designer
4988000	4990000	Was being interviewed with GameSpot
4990000	4992000	He said, quote, there's a good chance for lost Vikings
4992000	4994000	That's one of the characters we've been really interested in doing
4994000	4996000	It's a way we can do three characters
4996000	4998000	And you're controlling them and swapping back and forth
4998000	5000000	I think we've really got some ideas
5000000	5002000	That we might be able to make work
5002000	5004000	But we're going to have to test it first
5004000	5006000	To really see
5006000	5008000	That's interesting, they don't want to put in the Vikings separately
5008000	5010000	They want to have like ice climbers
5010000	5012000	That's some shit
5012000	5014000	One character that you control one of
5014000	5016000	And it's all three of them type of thing
5016000	5018000	That could be very interesting
5018000	5020000	So don't count the lost Vikings out
5020000	5022000	Another one not to count out
5022000	5024000	What's that Super Nintendo game, Blackthorn?
5024000	5026000	Whatever's the one they did on Super Nintendo
5026000	5028000	They released that for free on Battle.net
5028000	5030000	You just go download it, totally for free
5030000	5032000	And have a blast with that
5032000	5034000	I have a feeling they could be putting him
5034000	5036000	In Heroes of the Storm 2
5036000	5038000	Why not?
5038000	5040000	More than just World of Warcraft
5040000	5042000	For the record, I do absolutely
5042000	5044000	Love that the lost Vikings
5044000	5046000	Are in World of Warcraft
5046000	5048000	You can just go hang out with them if you're Alliance
5048000	5050000	And you can kill the shit out of them if you're Horde
5050000	5052000	That part's pretty cool
5052000	5054000	Very cool
5054000	5056000	Alright, let's
5056000	5058000	Travel to a time that was simpler
5058000	5060000	We're going to go back to a time when lost Vikings
5060000	5062000	Might have actually been out
5062000	5064000	It's the classic game of the week
5064000	5066000	No, Dark Sakura didn't pick lost Vikings
5066000	5068000	But she did pick something else that's very cool
5068000	5070000	I picked something that my autocorrect
5070000	5072000	Tried to change to Zantac
5072000	5074000	I picked Zanac
5074000	5076000	Zanac is the classic game of the week
5076000	5078000	Zanac, and if you ever
5078000	5080000	Have played this game or have seen it played
5080000	5082000	You can definitely tell it's a freaking compile game
5082000	5084000	I mean, seriously
5084000	5086000	It's fucking compile
5086000	5088000	Um, it is
5088000	5090000	Um, like I said, designed by
5090000	5092000	Compile and released in Japan by
5092000	5094000	Pony Canyon and by FCI
5094000	5096000	In the US
5096000	5098000	It was first an MSX game as was
5098000	5100000	Gardic
5100000	5102000	Um, which we got
5102000	5104000	We got Gardic Gaiden as the guardian legend
5104000	5106000	Um, and
5106000	5108000	It came out on the Famicom Disk System
5108000	5110000	And the NES
5110000	5112000	And later on came out for the Virtual Console
5112000	5114000	And it also came out
5114000	5116000	On MSX2 as
5116000	5118000	Zanac EX and PlayStation as Zanac
5118000	5120000	X Zanac
5120000	5122000	So basically you play one ship called the
5122000	5124000	X502 Zanac through twelve levels
5124000	5126000	And you have to destroy the system
5126000	5128000	Ooh, taking down the system
5128000	5130000	So you have
5130000	5132000	Um, it was
5132000	5134000	Actually developed by
5134000	5136000	Some of the main developers at Compile
5136000	5138000	Um, these are the
5138000	5140000	Same ones who went in to do the guardian legend
5140000	5142000	Blazing lasers and Puyo Puyo
5142000	5144000	Um, it was basically
5144000	5146000	And
5146000	5148000	This is where I say you can tell it's a freaking compile shooter
5148000	5150000	Because watching it looks like
5150000	5152000	Playing through those shooting levels of guardian legend
5152000	5154000	I mean down to graphical style and everything
5154000	5156000	The music
5156000	5158000	Is definitely compile stuff
5158000	5160000	And just watching it through
5160000	5162000	It's a very fast
5162000	5164000	And kind of difficult game
5164000	5166000	It's really not super easy
5166000	5168000	And uh, you know you've got your
5168000	5170000	Weapons boost, you have uh
5170000	5172000	You either, you know
5172000	5174000	Game over when you lose your lives or you beat
5174000	5176000	The game, you do get
5176000	5178000	Extra lives as you go
5178000	5180000	Excuse me
5180000	5182000	You do also
5182000	5184000	Have like
5184000	5186000	Your special weapons
5186000	5188000	That are based off of whatever number
5188000	5190000	Is labeled
5190000	5192000	And you lose all of your powerups
5192000	5194000	Of course if you get hit
5194000	5196000	Your enemies are
5196000	5198000	You have meteors
5198000	5200000	You have different aircraft
5200000	5202000	You have these discs
5202000	5204000	That are
5204000	5206000	You can't shoot them, they're impervious
5206000	5208000	You have ground turrets
5208000	5210000	Different planes, you have your different bosses
5210000	5212000	Can I just say real quick, those discs come right out
5212000	5214000	Or are in guardian legend, I swear
5214000	5216000	Like, I have to admit
5216000	5218000	Dark Sakura, I know of Xanac
5218000	5220000	And I know some of the stuff with the lunar
5220000	5222000	Lander and all that, which we'll probably get into in a minute
5222000	5224000	But I've never actually played it
5224000	5226000	And I'm watching this
5226000	5228000	Little video here and I'm like, wow
5228000	5230000	This really does look like a shooter stage out of the guardian legend
5230000	5232000	I mean the sprites are a little different
5232000	5234000	But just the way, like the sound
5234000	5236000	Is very similar
5236000	5238000	And that's the thing about compile
5238000	5240000	You notice they did have the little
5240000	5242000	Ground things that you shoot there
5242000	5244000	Those exact things were in
5244000	5246000	Guardian legend that had your powerup
5246000	5248000	Your little
5248000	5250000	And even the way those bullets look, those are bullets
5250000	5252000	Straight out of guardian legend too, so this is interesting
5252000	5254000	Sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt that
5254000	5256000	It's good that you did because compile
5256000	5258000	I mean basically until
5258000	5260000	For all of their NES shooters, compile really did
5260000	5262000	Or, I shouldn't just say NES
5262000	5264000	They're 8-bit shooters
5264000	5266000	Really did stick
5266000	5268000	With a certain style, even blazing lasers
5268000	5270000	To an extent, has that
5270000	5272000	Overwhelming compile look
5272000	5274000	To it, and I hate to say
5274000	5276000	If you play one compile shooter, you've played most of them
5276000	5278000	You know, except
5278000	5280000	Guardian legend actually happened to have
5280000	5282000	A really cool adventure sequences
5282000	5284000	And so much to do
5284000	5286000	Now, there was that
5286000	5288000	Compilation, like I mentioned for Playstation
5288000	5290000	That was Xanac, ex-Xanac
5290000	5292000	And
5292000	5294000	As far as
5294000	5296000	That's concerned
5296000	5298000	It also had an updated version of Xanac
5298000	5300000	Called Xanac Neo
5300000	5302000	And the different NES versions
5302000	5304000	So I'd definitely say if someone can find that
5304000	5306000	They should go ahead and do it because
5306000	5308000	All in all, even if you get over
5308000	5310000	It's striking similarities to the
5310000	5312000	Other games
5312000	5314000	Then
5314000	5316000	It's still, you know
5316000	5318000	It's still
5318000	5320000	It's still a very
5320000	5322000	Good shooter to play
5322000	5324000	And I'd definitely say
5324000	5326000	It's worth adding to any library
5326000	5328000	So, that's it, Xanac
5328000	5330000	There it is
5330000	5332000	If anyone's wondering if I've done this before, I think you might be getting
5332000	5334000	Confused with Zexes
5334000	5336000	Yes, you did do Zexes, I remember that
5336000	5338000	But you've never done Xanac
5338000	5340000	Wow, somebody has already updated
5340000	5342000	I was on the wiki, because somebody in chat was suggesting
5342000	5344000	That you do Shenmue
5344000	5346000	And I was like, yeah I know, Act F was like
5346000	5348000	And I'm like, really, when?
5348000	5350000	And sure enough, you did do that in episode
5350000	5352000	326, somebody that was long, 356
5352000	5354000	You did a long time ago
5354000	5356000	Yes, this list is getting very long
5356000	5358000	But as I'm on the list, already updated
5358000	5360000	To say Xanac there, episode 527
5360000	5362000	Well done, wiki editors
5362000	5364000	And honestly, and I have to say
5364000	5366000	For the people who update the wiki, I seriously do rely on you
5366000	5368000	Because, I mean
5368000	5370000	If you guys are having trouble remembering what I've picked
5370000	5372000	Imagine the trouble I'm having
5372000	5374000	When, no no no, I have to describe
5374000	5376000	This, I've got
5376000	5378000	A wall of shelves behind me
5378000	5380000	At my house that's loaded with video games
5380000	5382000	And I have to look at this shit
5382000	5384000	Going, what have I not done?
5384000	5386000	So I've just started picking games
5386000	5388000	By freaking year, and I picked 1986 this time
5388000	5390000	So it worked
5390000	5392000	Fun OLR trivia
5392000	5394000	The very first Classic Game of the Week
5394000	5396000	Episode 250
5396000	5398000	Was the very first Classic Game of the Week
5398000	5400000	And we all know what it was
5400000	5402000	Do we? Do you remember? What was it?
5402000	5404000	It was Vibribin, no it wasn't
5404000	5406000	It was Fantasy Zone
5406000	5408000	It was Fantasy Zone, was the very first Classic Game of the Week
5408000	5410000	Because Fantasy Zone is my favorite
5410000	5412000	No, my second favorite video game ever
5412000	5414000	My first favorite being
5414000	5416000	Guardian Legend, and my third favorite being
5416000	5418000	Space Harrier
5418000	5420000	You did end up doing Guardian Legend later, and I remember you came in here and you were like
5420000	5422000	Ah, fuck it, we're doing Guardian Legend tonight
5422000	5424000	I was saving it, but
5424000	5426000	You were very much like, you know what?
5426000	5428000	The hell with it, episode 256
5428000	5430000	I kind of go through this thing where I don't
5430000	5432000	Want to do things that are too expected
5432000	5434000	Or too much of the
5434000	5436000	Everybody loves this fucking game, ooh
5436000	5438000	You know, I want to do something
5438000	5440000	That maybe people haven't heard of
5440000	5442000	Or good games that people just
5442000	5444000	May have overlooked
5444000	5446000	Sometimes you have to do Final Fantasy 6 twice
5446000	5448000	No, sometimes
5448000	5450000	Yeah
5450000	5452000	Well, like I said
5452000	5454000	It's hard to remember
5454000	5456000	You know, I'm probably going to have to do Kickle Cubicle
5456000	5458000	Just because
5458000	5460000	Dan was playing it the other day
5460000	5462000	I still have a list like a mile long of Commodore 64 games
5462000	5464000	Whenever you're ready
5464000	5466000	You need to show me some of these games
5466000	5468000	I'm going to do Oregon Trail next week, guys
5468000	5470000	That would be awesome, why don't you do Oregon Trail?
5470000	5472000	I might
5472000	5474000	If you have some suggestions for Dark Soccer
5474000	5476000	Oregon Trail is stuck in my head because I just got finished reading
5476000	5478000	Problem Sleuth
5478000	5480000	And there's a whole tribute to Oregon Trail in there
5480000	5482000	Nice
5482000	5484000	You can hit Dark Soccer up on Tumblr
5484000	5486000	I usually would give out your Twitter
5486000	5488000	You know what, I make sure to check Twitter at least once a week
5488000	5490000	So my Twitter is
5490000	5492000	DarkSakura
5492000	5494000	My Tumblr is Kurotsubasa
5494000	5496000	K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A
5496000	5498000	Blackwing
5498000	5500000	Because I'm so dark
5500000	5502000	Or, uh, shoot
5502000	5504000	Harass me on the mailbag
5504000	5506000	I'll complain about it and then critique your grammar
5506000	5508000	And then I'll probably do it
5508000	5510000	Alright, mailbag at orangeonstrader.com
5510000	5512000	We're going to take a break, though
5512000	5514000	I think I've done Twinbee
5514000	5516000	We're going to take a break, then we're going to come back
5516000	5518000	And we're going to do the mailbag
5518000	5520000	And the FUs of the Week
5520000	5522000	And your live phone calls
5522000	5524000	Rapid Fire News
5524000	5526000	PS4 sales
5526000	5528000	Politics and games
5528000	5530000	And pornography in part B tonight
5530000	5532000	Yes, a legit porn story
5532000	5534000	Coming up in part B tonight
5534000	5536000	So you definitely don't want to go anywhere
5536000	5538000	We will be right back after this
5538000	5548000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live on this Sunday evening
5548000	5550000	November the 17th, 2013
5550000	5554000	With the 527th episode of our show already in progress
5554000	5559000	And some good classic songs from some old games there during our break
5559000	5561000	Which sadly we can't play during the podcast
5561000	5563000	But we do play live
5563000	5565000	We had the epilogue from Final Fantasy IV
5565000	5567000	Which I always love that ending
5568000	5570000	And then Mega Man 7's introduction
5570000	5572000	Which, you know, I think there's mixed opinions on Mega Man 7
5572000	5574000	But I thought it was pretty cool
5574000	5576000	During the break, a lot of folks in our chat room
5576000	5578000	I noticed over at live.vognetwork.com
5578000	5580000	Talking about weight loss and a lot of successes
5580000	5582000	Which is interesting
5582000	5584000	Because Thanksgiving is not usually the time of year
5584000	5586000	When you hear about weight loss
5586000	5588000	But a lot of people have been successful with their various things
5588000	5590000	Including Dark Soccer
5590000	5592000	You've been doing very well
5592000	5594000	Yeah, I'm actually
5594000	5596000	And I know it's going to sound fad-like and everything
5596000	5598000	But I've done similar stuff before
5598000	5600000	And I honestly feel better doing it
5600000	5603000	As I'm doing this whole ketogenic eating thing
5603000	5605000	Where it's like really low carb
5605000	5607000	But you also have a percentage of like how much fat you eat
5607000	5609000	And how much protein you eat
5609000	5611000	And that's a lot of protein
5611000	5616000	But I also go to the gym at least once a week
5616000	5620000	And I do body weight exercises in my house
5620000	5622000	If I don't go to the gym
5622000	5624000	So it's working out with weights three times a week
5624000	5626000	And walking on the opposite days
5626000	5628000	I really couldn't do low carb
5628000	5630000	Because I just love bread
5630000	5632000	Is there a diet where I can eat nothing but bread?
5632000	5634000	Well, I did find a recipe to make bread
5634000	5636000	Out of coconut flour
5636000	5638000	Oh, I like coconut
5638000	5642000	And Tiara sent me a recipe to do red velvet cupcakes
5642000	5644000	Which I'm going to be trying
5644000	5646000	I have actually found a lot of people
5646000	5648000	Speak very highly of almond flour bread
5648000	5650000	And coconut flour bread
5650000	5652000	Interesting
5652000	5654000	I haven't missed it, honestly
5654000	5656000	I need to get motivated
5656000	5658000	I need to get Wii Fit U
5658000	5660000	Well, to be honest
5660000	5662000	It was just sort of like
5662000	5664000	You remember when I moved out here
5664000	5666000	How much I put on
5666000	5668000	I'm going to say it on air, I was a size 20
5668000	5670000	I don't mind saying it
5670000	5672000	And I dropped down to a 12
5672000	5674000	And then I put back on some
5674000	5676000	So it's like
5676000	5678000	I could just continue
5678000	5680000	To eat all of the stuff that makes me feel like shit
5680000	5682000	Because I've got digestion problems
5682000	5684000	Eating too much sugar
5684000	5686000	Actually makes me
5686000	5688000	Have a harder time concentrating
5688000	5690000	And since cutting all of it out
5690000	5692000	I'm actually feeling infinitely better than I ever did
5692000	5694000	And plus, I have more energy for
5694000	5696000	Stuff I want to do
5696000	5698000	I'm planning on playing DDR again
5698000	5700000	Gene in our chat room at Live.vongnetwork.com says
5700000	5702000	Wow, we are all so healthy
5702000	5704000	Not me, no, not me
5704000	5706000	AgDef says Wii Fit U up
5706000	5708000	I need to figure out something to get into
5708000	5710000	We'll see
5710000	5712000	Alright, moving on
5712000	5714000	Let's get into some rapid fire news
5714000	5716000	Back to games
5716000	5718000	This is another reason why I'm not losing any weight
5718000	5720000	Because I'm too busy playing video games
5720000	5722000	Although, no, I shouldn't play into that stereotype
5722000	5724000	Because there's a lot of people
5724000	5726000	That play an awful lot of video games
5726000	5728000	It's about finding the balance, absolutely
5728000	5730000	And for those of you guys who don't listen to Hoard House
5730000	5732000	I know Extrovert has a great story there
5732000	5734000	He plays a lot of video games
5734000	5736000	But he lost a lot of weight
5737000	5739000	It's really quite something
5739000	5741000	Well, what I've started doing now
5741000	5743000	I have set times now
5743000	5745000	For me to play my games
5745000	5747000	I play Animal Crossing in the morning
5747000	5749000	So that I can go to the island and get a tan
5749000	5751000	Because fuck
5751000	5753000	But I play while walking around the house
5753000	5755000	And feeding the cat
5755000	5757000	And putting up dishes
5757000	5759000	And doing chores in the house
5759000	5761000	I'll do parts of it
5761000	5763000	And then the hour while my character is on the island
5763000	5765000	Is when I go do yoga
5765000	5767000	I'm actually using my games
5767000	5769000	To help me set my exercise times
5769000	5771000	Okay
5771000	5773000	So I know that when an hour is up
5773000	5776000	I do about maybe 30 minutes of yoga
5776000	5778000	And then I do
5778000	5780000	Just wandering around the house and some housework
5780000	5782000	Because housework counts as exercise, fuck it
5782000	5784000	And by the time I'm done with that
5784000	5786000	I know it's time to come back from the island
5786000	5788000	And hit Ed with a bug net
5788000	5790000	Because fuck him
5790000	5792000	Yeah, I guess maybe there's a way I could
5792000	5794000	Get on the treadmill and have a 3DS
5794000	5796000	With an iPad or something
5796000	5798000	I used to play Pokemon on the recumbent bike
5798000	5800000	Nice, maybe I could figure something like that out
5800000	5802000	Oh well, for now, let's get back into video games
5802000	5804000	Because that's what the show's about
5804000	5806000	So, Loki, some rapid fire news for us
5806000	5808000	Yes, Infamous Second Son
5808000	5810000	Which was supposed to be coming out
5810000	5812000	First quarter
5812000	5814000	They finally announced that it will be launching
5814000	5816000	March 21st in North America
5816000	5818000	And they had a wonderful trailer
5818000	5820000	That was during their whole launch special
5820000	5822000	That they did
5823000	5825000	Definitely one of the only games I'm looking forward to
5825000	5827000	Another interesting one
5827000	5829000	Towerfall Ascension
5829000	5831000	You may remember Towerfall from being one of the
5831000	5833000	More popular Ouya games
5833000	5835000	Now it's coming to PC
5835000	5837000	And it's going to be coming to Playstation 4 as well
5837000	5839000	That's gonna suck for Ouya a little bit
5841000	5843000	Also brand new levels
5843000	5845000	And they've got 50 new levels coming
5845000	5847000	And 50 new versus levels
5847000	5849000	4 more playable characters
5849000	5852000	And 12 player cooperative quest mode
5852000	5854000	6 additional power ups and more
5856000	5858000	And last but not least
5858000	5860000	Rayman Legends is supposed to be coming to
5860000	5862000	Next gen consoles in February
5862000	5864000	That's so funny
5864000	5866000	It's like when the Wii U
5866000	5868000	Was supposed to be coming out in the Wii U in February
5868000	5870000	And it never did
5870000	5872000	Are you throwing shade that that might not actually happen?
5872000	5874000	I don't know if it's going to be in February
5874000	5876000	Yeah, it's going to be coming out in next gen consoles
5876000	5878000	I don't know how they're going to make that
5878000	5880000	It's going to look as good
5880000	5882000	I would think on a next gen console
5882000	5884000	They're going to have to
5884000	5886000	Yeah, maybe they don't do anything with the graphics
5886000	5888000	They might just up rez some things
5888000	5890000	And do some new textures and things to make it
5890000	5892000	Look a little sharper
5892000	5894000	Frame rate would be really good
5894000	5896000	All I can think of in my head is that
5896000	5898000	Extrofer will have yet another reason to do a stream
5898000	5900000	Of Rayman Legends over on his little Twitch channel
5900000	5902000	That he does
5902000	5904000	I think he played the thing start to finish on Twitch
5904000	5906000	Interesting
5906000	5908000	Moving on, some stuff that I hear
5908000	5910000	I hear click click click click
5910000	5912000	Click click click from Loki
5912000	5914000	As soon as he's done with his story
5914000	5916000	Cookie cookie cookie cookie cookie cookie
5916000	5918000	I'm going to be done with this game today
5918000	5920000	Your addiction is affecting your life in the following ways
5920000	5922000	I may have cheated a little bit
5922000	5924000	Look at your life, look at your choices
5924000	5926000	That's a teensy bit
5926000	5928000	Well maybe the next thing that Loki can get addicted to
5928000	5930000	Is Hatsune Miku Project D.Va
5930000	5932000	Nope
5932000	5934000	Ah hey, now this game is really cute
5934000	5936000	And if you missed it on the Playstation 3
5936000	5938000	For whatever reason, A buy it on sale
5938000	5940000	Or something, but B it will be coming out
5940000	5942000	On the Vita in early 2014
5942000	5944000	Very cool, so yeah
5944000	5946000	Hatsune Miku coming out in the North America and Europe
5946000	5948000	In early 2014
5948000	5950000	On the Vita, so that was announced this week
5950000	5952000	Very exciting
5952000	5954000	When we were getting into it a couple weeks ago
5954000	5956000	On our last episode about the whole fact that
5956000	5958000	Swap Note was
5958000	5960000	Disabled on the 3DS, somebody had brought up
5960000	5962000	Well, we karaoke you
5962000	5964000	Has some, you know, F words
5964000	5966000	And things in it, so why is it that
5966000	5968000	You know, you can't send
5968000	5970000	Pictures of
5970000	5972000	Dongs on Swap Note, but yet you can
5972000	5974000	Have fucking shit and all these words
5974000	5976000	In songs on We Karaoke You
5976000	5978000	Well, apparently this week it was
5978000	5980000	Announced that warnings
5980000	5982000	Will be added to the game's eShop
5982000	5984000	Page when you get an access
5984000	5986000	Token for We Karaoke You
5986000	5988000	And in the app itself
5988000	5990000	That will warn people
5990000	5992000	We Karaoke You by JoySound
5992000	5994000	Is intended to provide users with
5994000	5996000	Access to a large catalog of songs
5996000	5998000	From a broad range of music labels across a variety
5998000	6000000	Of musical genres designed to appeal
6000000	6002000	To all musical tastes
6002000	6004000	As such, Nintendo does not restrict which songs
6004000	6006000	Are included in the catalog of songs
6006000	6008000	Featured within the We Karaoke You by JoySound
6008000	6010000	Application
6010000	6012000	Blah blah blah blah blah, the songs aren't rated by
6012000	6014000	Peggy, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
6014000	6016000	So
6016000	6018000	Interesting little
6018000	6020000	Retcon they had to do
6020000	6022000	For lack of a better word on some of their
6022000	6024000	Other games that have adult themes
6024000	6026000	I find this
6026000	6028000	Fascinating and I've got to check this out this week
6028000	6030000	I heard about this before
6030000	6032000	And I'm sure you all did too
6032000	6034000	There was a Chinese hack a couple years ago
6034000	6036000	Of Final Fantasy 7
6036000	6038000	That they shoved it into an NES
6038000	6040000	Cartridge, I don't know which Final Fantasy game they had
6040000	6042000	Hacked or if they programmed a new game or something
6042000	6044000	But somebody took Final Fantasy 7 and put it
6044000	6046000	In an NES cart, well that was a
6046000	6048000	Couple years ago that that happened but
6048000	6050000	This week it was
6050000	6052000	Actually a translation
6052000	6054000	Patch that happened by
6054000	6056000	Modder Luigia
6056000	6058000	I'm tempted to say Luigia
6058000	6060000	But it's Luigia 2009
6060000	6062000	Actually it was a whole team it wasn't just one guy
6062000	6064000	But this modder led this team to
6064000	6066000	Actually translate the game but at the same
6066000	6068000	Time they actually fixed
6068000	6070000	Some things, they redrew some of the graphics
6070000	6072000	Improved the music
6072000	6074000	Did an actual ending, bug fixes
6074000	6076000	Improvements, this is kind of crazy
6076000	6078000	Now it's like a legit game
6078000	6080000	That you can play through and check out if you
6080000	6082000	Want to check it out in English because I guess it was super broken
6082000	6084000	In its original form but now it's
6084000	6086000	Able to play so really
6086000	6088000	Curious to see what that looks like
6088000	6090000	Yeah
6090000	6092000	Their next project that they're working on
6092000	6094000	A
6094000	6096000	Unlicensed NES port of
6096000	6098000	Pokemon Yellow that came out from
6098000	6100000	The same company on the NES
6100000	6102000	They're going to redo that one in English and fix some of those
6102000	6104000	Issues next
6104000	6106000	That's pretty awesome
6106000	6108000	Dark Sakura
6108000	6110000	Sounds fairly cool
6110000	6112000	Well in other news there is some information about
6112000	6114000	Metal Gear Solid 5
6114000	6116000	Ground Zeroes there's going to be
6116000	6118000	A
6118000	6120000	Snake skin
6120000	6122000	A solid snake skin
6122000	6124000	So that you can run around as actual
6124000	6126000	Snake
6126000	6128000	And there's going to be a Playstation exclusive
6128000	6130000	Mission called Deja Vu
6130000	6132000	There's a trailer for it that's been out
6132000	6134000	And this is supposed to come out in the spring of 2014
6134000	6136000	For the various systems
6136000	6138000	Of Microsoft and Sony persuasions
6138000	6140000	In
6140000	6142000	Other news
6142000	6144000	There is
6144000	6146000	Going to be
6146000	6148000	It looks like a third
6148000	6150000	A new third person game that's coming out by Monolith
6150000	6152000	Called Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor
6152000	6154000	That is going to be based
6154000	6156000	In the Lord of the Rings universe and
6156000	6158000	You play as a ranger
6158000	6160000	A ranger named Talion
6160000	6162000	So
6162000	6164000	He's resurrected
6164000	6166000	As a vengeful spirit
6166000	6168000	And he gets to be a wraith
6168000	6170000	Like person
6170000	6172000	And then last but not least
6172000	6174000	In the
6174000	6176000	Thing that refuses to load on my
6176000	6178000	iPad
6178000	6180000	There is a new character that has been confirmed
6180000	6182000	For the next Smash Brothers and that's Marth
6182000	6184000	Not really a new
6184000	6186000	Character but you know
6186000	6188000	Marth fans will be happy that he's back
6188000	6190000	As long as we get Roy too
6190000	6192000	I think some of the
6192000	6194000	Partner characters are the ones in danger
6194000	6196000	Like you know it's no
6196000	6198000	It's no surprise
6198000	6200000	That Star Fox will be a character
6200000	6202000	That's in the game but will
6202000	6204000	Captain Falcon come back or not Captain Falcon
6204000	6206000	God dammit
6206000	6208000	Captain Falcon from F-Zero will absolutely
6208000	6210000	Be there
6210000	6212000	This bird Falco
6212000	6214000	He may not be back
6214000	6216000	Good
6216000	6218000	But I would think that those are the characters in danger
6218000	6220000	Of the partner characters
6220000	6222000	He is kind of a bitch isn't he
6222000	6224000	Yeah he's totally a bitch not even a good kind of bitch
6224000	6226000	Only good Falco did music in the 1980's
6226000	6228000	Hey Rob
6228000	6230000	Show me your moves
6230000	6232000	I will show you the FUGO
6232000	6234000	Question of the week
6240000	6242000	Every week over at
6242000	6244000	Facebook and Google Plus
6244000	6246000	You take those words and slam it together you get FUGO
6246000	6248000	We ask a question of our listeners
6248000	6250000	And we read some of the answers here for y'all
6250000	6252000	Here on the show
6252000	6254000	This week's question as asked of our communities
6254000	6256000	Since the Playstation 4 came out
6256000	6258000	We've noticed an increase of social media
6258000	6260000	Posts coming from the device
6260000	6262000	This can include tweets or Facebook
6262000	6264000	Posts when someone starts playing the game
6264000	6266000	Have y'all noticed this cause I sure did
6266000	6268000	Lots more Facebook posts coming from the Playstation 4
6268000	6270000	I ignore Facebook
6270000	6272000	Kind of, well I haven't blocked it
6272000	6274000	But I haven't really paid attention
6274000	6276000	I noticed a big increase in the amount of posts
6276000	6278000	I see posts now when people start
6278000	6280000	Playing a game
6280000	6282000	So I was very surprised at the increased
6282000	6284000	Amount of
6284000	6286000	You know I don't want to say spam
6286000	6288000	But automated posts
6288000	6290000	Coming from the Playstation
6290000	6292000	Anyway so that led into our question this week
6292000	6294000	For the Playstation 4 owners
6294000	6296000	Do you use social media posting features on your new device
6296000	6298000	Why or why not
6298000	6300000	For the non Playstation 4 owners
6300000	6302000	Do you like seeing the social media posts
6302000	6304000	Made from the Playstation 4
6304000	6306000	So let's get to some of the answers
6306000	6308000	There's so many tonight I'm not going to be able to read them all
6308000	6310000	We'll start with a couple from Google Plus
6310000	6312000	Colin M replied and said
6312000	6314000	I only like to see posts when a person starts a game
6314000	6316000	For the first time
6316000	6318000	That way I know what games they're playing
6318000	6320000	And maybe join in or talk to them about it
6320000	6322000	I do not need to see every time an achievement
6322000	6324000	Or trophy unlocks
6324000	6326000	I would agree especially if you're meaning
6326000	6328000	Not to say like the first and
6328000	6330000	Not the subsequent times
6330000	6332000	They start the game but the very first time
6332000	6334000	Just to kind of know that they have it
6334000	6336000	And you can ask them questions about it
6336000	6338000	But I don't need to see like
6338000	6340000	So and so is playing Resogun for the 7000th time today
6340000	6342000	I don't need to see that
6342000	6344000	Redertainment says
6344000	6346000	As a non Playstation 4 owner
6346000	6348000	Posts of people having fun with their PS4
6348000	6350000	Serve as a taunt to me
6350000	6352000	A taunt of things that they have that I don't
6352000	6354000	I'm experiencing this more and more as I pursue
6354000	6356000	When but not if but when
6356000	6358000	I buy my house and I begin to fill
6358000	6360000	Social media with pictures of my house
6360000	6362000	Those pictures will taunt people with what I have
6362000	6364000	And they don't
6364000	6366000	That's true
6366000	6368000	What's the whole point of doing it though?
6368000	6370000	Is to say oh so and so has this
6370000	6372000	I want that
6372000	6374000	Is that why people post pictures of their kids too?
6374000	6376000	My kids the cutest
6376000	6378000	Happy face
6378000	6380000	Well I personally think that for some people
6380000	6382000	Having children is an unspoken competition
6382000	6384000	Don't get me started on that
6384000	6386000	For some people I've met
6386000	6388000	Buying a house is an unspoken competition
6388000	6390000	So I'm just saying
6390000	6392000	In the past
6392000	6394000	A good friend of mine just bought a house
6394000	6396000	I'm not shading that I'm talking about in the past
6396000	6398000	Many years ago
6398000	6400000	And Alan
6400000	6402000	Alan knows exactly what I'm talking about and he's over there
6402000	6404000	Saying it too. Alright anyway
6404000	6406000	Let's see
6406000	6408000	Act Def says I only try to use any
6408000	6410000	Social media sharing when it's something like
6410000	6412000	Truly special or great
6412000	6414000	Like getting a really hard achievement or trophy
6414000	6416000	Or telling people that I'll stream a game
6416000	6418000	Since now that's possible with the new consoles
6418000	6420000	Let's go over to Facebook and get some
6420000	6422000	Of the answers over on Facebook
6422000	6424000	And see what people said there
6424000	6426000	How about Burr who said
6426000	6428000	So far as a PS4 owner I've only posted one
6428000	6430000	Gameplay clip to Facebook
6430000	6432000	Mostly just to see if it worked
6432000	6434000	Nobody responded though so I'll probably save it for funny bugs
6434000	6436000	Or things that are actually interesting
6436000	6438000	People probably don't want to hear about every little thing I do
6438000	6440000	So I shut off the automatic posting
6440000	6442000	The real fun so far has been the Twitch streaming
6442000	6444000	It's actually an incentive to keep playing
6444000	6446000	Since you're entertaining others as much as yourself
6446000	6448000	Scott W said
6448000	6450000	I've just started trying it out with screenshots
6450000	6452000	I like it
6452000	6454000	Code Man says I don't have a PS4 yet
6454000	6456000	But I don't mind posts if they are from consoles
6456000	6458000	What frustrates me is when people invite me to
6458000	6460000	Facebook games and Candy Crush
6460000	6462000	But I enjoy seeing what my friends are playing
6462000	6464000	And it's a chance to get an unbiased opinion
6464000	6466000	Rather than the media companies
6466000	6468000	Telling me what to play
6468000	6470000	I like that answer
6470000	6472000	Tiger Claw says
6472000	6474000	While having those features on the PS4 is good
6474000	6476000	When you want to post something
6476000	6478000	The only downside is your Twitter or Facebook posts
6478000	6480000	Would be spammed with so and so playing this game
6480000	6482000	Or unlock a trophy
6482000	6484000	If they give the player the ability to control
6484000	6486000	What is posted on Twitter and Facebook
6486000	6488000	Then some people won't be bombarded with PS4 spam
6488000	6490000	I kind of agree
6490000	6492000	I don't like the whole idea of all or nothing
6492000	6494000	Let me
6494000	6496000	I know on the PS3 you don't get to pick
6496000	6498000	Either you turn it on or you turn it off
6498000	6500000	And you can turn on certain types of posts
6500000	6502000	But I can't tell it
6502000	6504000	Only post these trophies or what have you
6504000	6506000	That would be a little better I would think
6506000	6508000	Or they could have the trophy pop up
6508000	6510000	And say hey do you want to post this to your wall
6510000	6512000	Gene W replied
6512000	6514000	I currently do not have a PS4
6514000	6516000	However I'm against these messages
6516000	6518000	Because I dislike them already on Facebook
6518000	6520000	And don't really have a desire to have a friends list
6520000	6522000	Flaming Toilet
6522000	6524000	Flaming Toilet
6524000	6526000	God I love that name
6526000	6528000	Responds and says I may be a grumpy old man
6528000	6530000	But I think we've gone way overboard with social media
6530000	6532000	Integration everywhere not just gaming
6532000	6534000	The world doesn't need to know my business
6534000	6536000	I certainly don't want to annoy people with it
6536000	6538000	Anymore than I have to
6538000	6540000	And I don't really care what trophies other people get or whatever
6540000	6542000	And yes there's every bit of irony
6542000	6544000	In using social media to bitch
6544000	6546000	About social media's ever growing presence
6546000	6548000	In our lives
6548000	6550000	So that's a good way to end it
6550000	6552000	I only read like half the answers
6552000	6554000	So please do check out Facebook and Google Plus for more answers
6554000	6556000	Facebook.com slash
6556000	6558000	Orange Lounge Radio
6558000	6560000	Or Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio
6560000	6562000	That's right we finally have a short URL
6562000	6564000	Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio
6564000	6566000	And then there's the whole like you know
6566000	6568000	Google Plus shoved down throat
6568000	6570000	YouTube comments thing
6570000	6572000	All tweaked and stuff and how people love that
6572000	6574000	Yeah I'm not sure how I feel about all that
6574000	6576000	Like I'm trying to embrace it
6576000	6578000	I'm trying to do the whole hug it for 15 minutes
6578000	6580000	And see if I like it
6580000	6582000	I will tell you this the fact that I
6582000	6584000	Hug it for 15 minutes and see if you get a skin disease
6584000	6586000	I'm trying to
6586000	6588000	Trying to embrace it
6588000	6590000	With the whole fact that I'm getting into YouTube
6590000	6592000	More which is unrelated but I'm like alright
6592000	6594000	Well maybe this is an incentive to use Google Plus
6594000	6596000	To do more like gaming style posts
6596000	6598000	That tie into the YouTube's ideas
6598000	6600000	I'm like I'm trying to like it that way
6600000	6602000	But obviously it's a very
6602000	6604000	Unpopular change
6604000	6606000	But I don't know
6606000	6608000	Google used to be the company that you know
6608000	6610000	Could do no wrong and
6610000	6612000	Lately between
6612000	6614000	You know what was that
6614000	6616000	Before they had Google Plus they had
6616000	6618000	What was that social net Buzz oh god
6618000	6620000	That network yeah that was
6620000	6622000	Just bad and then you know
6622000	6624000	They've done some weird things lately
6624000	6626000	No hmm
6626000	6628000	I still love them but I question some of their
6628000	6630000	Choices alright let's
6630000	6632000	Let's get back into some long gaming news
6632000	6634000	Loki Buzz
6634000	6636000	I forgot about that
6636000	6638000	Anyways
6638000	6640000	Let's talk about PlayStation 4 again
6640000	6642000	Why not
6642000	6644000	Sold 1 million units the first day
6644000	6646000	So that's got to be pretty good
6646000	6648000	And kind of
6648000	6650000	Along the lines of their
6650000	6652000	Prediction which is or I should say
6652000	6654000	Projection
6654000	6656000	3 million units sold by the end of the year
6656000	6658000	The estimate by Jack Tritten
6658000	6660000	So
6660000	6662000	Yeah so that's
6662000	6664000	Pretty good and you know definitely
6664000	6666000	I think availability is gonna
6666000	6668000	You know factor in quite
6668000	6670000	Heavily especially with the
6670000	6672000	Systems coming I don't think it's gonna be an issue
6672000	6674000	Where I'm not really sure
6674000	6676000	With the Wii U whether it was you know
6676000	6678000	Availability as a problem
6678000	6680000	Or demand not being
6680000	6682000	Actually I think it's demand not being that high because
6682000	6684000	I remember there was a bunch of systems
6684000	6686000	Sitting at retail
6686000	6688000	In piles and no one gave
6688000	6690000	A shit but
6690000	6692000	PlayStation 4 you know and if
6692000	6694000	There's any sort of indicator whatsoever
6694000	6696000	The grey market
6696000	6698000	Is pretty profitable right now so
6698000	6700000	There is demand for the system
6700000	6702000	It's just gonna be availability is gonna kind of
6702000	6704000	Slim until
6704000	6706000	I don't know a few months from now
6706000	6708000	And actually it may even be a few months more
6708000	6710000	Because you know with the launch and other territories
6710000	6712000	You know they're gonna
6712000	6714000	Have to ramp up production more
6714000	6716000	Or you know there's just gonna be less systems
6716000	6718000	That go around
6718000	6720000	What types of shortages though that we saw
6720000	6722000	Like with the Wii and the 360
6722000	6724000	I don't think it's gonna be as bad
6724000	6726000	As you know the Wii
6726000	6728000	You know what I've been hearing is like a few weeks
6728000	6730000	Out or probably a month from
6730000	6732000	Launch we're gonna see some more shipments
6732000	6734000	Coming in although
6734000	6736000	You know this is completely one other side
6736000	6738000	Of you know the spectrum
6738000	6740000	If you're you know consumer trying to
6740000	6742000	Pre-order one of those things
6742000	6744000	Keep in mind that these places taking pre-orders
6744000	6746000	May have already sold out their second
6746000	6748000	Third fourth shipments so
6748000	6750000	You know whereas I've been saying four weeks
6750000	6752000	When we're you know expecting to see some more
6752000	6754000	They yeah
6754000	6756000	Are gonna expect them you know more systems in
6756000	6758000	But those may be for customers that already have it
6758000	6760000	You may in fact I think a lot of
6760000	6762000	Like the game subs and stuff are saying
6762000	6764000	February now if you haven't pre-ordered yet so
6764000	6766000	You know keep an eye on that and Amazon
6766000	6768000	Yeah but you know what GameStop
6768000	6770000	Loves to use scare tactics to get people to
6770000	6772000	Pre-order so fuck that I don't believe anything
6772000	6774000	They say as far as the pre-order
6774000	6776000	I think Amazon had bundles available
6776000	6778000	You know game system bundles
6778000	6780000	It's probably people like me that cancel their pre-orders honestly
6780000	6782000	They probably had a few of those
6782000	6784000	To go so somebody bought my PlayStation 4
6784000	6786000	Which is fine
6786000	6788000	But yeah that's probably what that was
6788000	6790000	To be honest
6790000	6792000	Alright um
6792000	6794000	How do you think the Xbox One will sell?
6794000	6796000	I mean I don't want to get too fanboy wars-ish
6796000	6798000	But what do you think?
6798000	6800000	I think it'll sell alright
6800000	6802000	I'm worried that they're gonna have a bigger problem
6802000	6804000	Because as of right now
6804000	6806000	They're really
6806000	6808000	Shrinking down who's getting the system
6808000	6810000	And you're not gonna see it
6810000	6812000	You're not gonna see it at all
6812000	6814000	Independent retailers you're gonna see it at
6814000	6816000	The big stores and that's it
6816000	6818000	So if they're having an issue with production
6818000	6820000	On that stuff then
6820000	6822000	Yeah they could be a problem but
6822000	6824000	I think they've got a pretty decent lineup
6824000	6826000	At launch and I think they'll do about as well as the
6826000	6828000	PlayStation or the Xbox One
6828000	6830000	Or the PlayStation 4 and the
6830000	6832000	Xbox One will do about the same
6832000	6834000	Really it comes down to exclusives and
6834000	6836000	Let's be honest going
6836000	6838000	Forward you know in the least immediate future
6838000	6840000	A lot of the games that are coming out next gen
6840000	6842000	Are on both systems so it's
6842000	6844000	There's not a whole lot differentiating
6844000	6846000	One from the other
6846000	6848000	As far as games go I mean
6848000	6850000	So I don't know
6850000	6852000	Titanfall I guess I mean there's that
6852000	6854000	But that's on 360 even
6854000	6856000	And PC so I don't know
6856000	6858000	Alright well um going back to
6858000	6860000	A story we talked about on our last episode before
6860000	6862000	We had a break we talked about Pocketstation
6862000	6864000	Remember the Pocketstation was that
6864000	6866000	Cool little portable thing that they
6866000	6868000	Had on the PlayStation
6868000	6870000	With the kitty mascot
6870000	6872000	And that there were rumors
6872000	6874000	That it was making a comeback because of some
6874000	6876000	Trademarks that had been registered well guess what
6876000	6878000	Pocketstation came out as a
6878000	6880000	Free app for the PlayStation Vita
6880000	6882000	In Japan and
6882000	6884000	Yeah the app is free for
6884000	6886000	Japanese PlayStation Plus members
6886000	6888000	They say it includes Crash Bandicoot 3
6888000	6890000	Mega Man, Ape Escape and other
6890000	6892000	Original PlayStation titles I don't know if that's some type of
6892000	6894000	Perk for the PlayStation Plus
6894000	6896000	Some free PS1 titles that actually maybe used
6896000	6898000	The Pocketstation
6898000	6900000	But that's pretty cool
6900000	6902000	On December 3rd non PlayStation Plus
6902000	6904000	Japanese owners will be able to get it
6904000	6906000	There's also
6906000	6908000	A PlayStation title that's going to be added
6908000	6910000	To that Dokodemo Isho
6910000	6912000	Comes out no word about
6912000	6914000	When this is being released in the US but
6914000	6916000	You gotta think that hey if it happened over there
6916000	6918000	It will probably happen here too at some point
6918000	6920000	That's pretty cool
6920000	6922000	That'll be a fun little perk for PlayStation Plus
6922000	6924000	Users over here especially if those free games
6924000	6926000	Are still involved
6926000	6928000	The other thing I was going to mention and we kind of forgot to mention
6928000	6930000	Is the PS Vita
6930000	6932000	TV came out over in Japan
6932000	6934000	Oh yeah!
6934000	6936000	The other thing that I heard
6936000	6938000	That kind of sucked about it is it's region locked
6938000	6940000	Oh come on!
6940000	6942000	The Vita doesn't normally do that
6942000	6944000	It's a little strange that it's like that
6944000	6946000	They're trying to stop us from
6946000	6948000	I'm not sure
6948000	6950000	I don't know if it's region locked
6950000	6952000	I don't know, I had to read up
6952000	6954000	I didn't really look into it too much
6954000	6956000	I gotta be honest when that thing comes over here
6956000	6958000	I kind of want one
6958000	6960000	Especially with all these free games I'm getting
6960000	6962000	From the PlayStation Plus
6962000	6964000	I could play these PSP
6964000	6966000	And Vita and PlayStation games
6966000	6968000	And stuff on there
6968000	6970000	I don't know, I think that'd be pretty awesome
6971000	6973000	You know Jean has a good question in our chatroom
6973000	6975000	At live.vognetwork.com saying
6975000	6977000	I wonder if the Vita sales went up with the PlayStation 4 release
6977000	6979000	You know we're not hearing a lot about that
6979000	6981000	But I'm hearing about the second screen
6981000	6983000	People are really loving that, those that do have a Vita
6983000	6985000	I do have to tell you that Dan was telling me that
6985000	6987000	Vita actually went on sale at Radio Shack
6987000	6989000	For 120
6989000	6991000	That did happen the week we were gone, yeah
6991000	6993000	I remember reading about that
6993000	6995000	Loki, have you heard anything about the sales for Vita?
6995000	6997000	I mean I can't imagine there's a lot of people
6997000	6999000	That can afford to buy both at once
6999000	7001000	I haven't really been seeing, we haven't been seeing
7001000	7003000	A lot of Vita sales
7003000	7005000	I mean it'd be interesting to see
7005000	7007000	If it does go up at retail
7007000	7009000	I'm thinking if anything people just clearing out
7009000	7011000	Inventory because they probably are sitting on a bunch of them
7011000	7013000	I'm sure with Black Friday you're gonna see
7013000	7015000	Some special deals on that stuff
7015000	7017000	There was supposed to be one that was with Tearaway
7017000	7019000	But that got retailer exclusive
7019000	7021000	Well it will
7021000	7023000	Also still be interesting to see what happens with
7023000	7025000	The PlayStation Vita in Japan
7025000	7027000	Versus here because I realize that Christmas
7027000	7029000	Has been quite the same in Japan as it is here
7029000	7031000	But it's still, you know, a deal
7031000	7033000	And there's gonna be the PlayStation Vita
7033000	7035000	That new, the new colors
7035000	7037000	And the new redesign
7037000	7039000	Of it already happened
7039000	7041000	So that's kind of what Sony's pushing in Japan right now
7041000	7043000	So I'm really curious to see how that kind of affects things
7043000	7045000	Cause you could look at potentially
7045000	7047000	There being more Vitas
7047000	7049000	Per person in Japan
7049000	7051000	Than there are here
7051000	7053000	It'll be very interesting to see how that affects the development of the games
7053000	7055000	So
7055000	7057000	Go to our channel at live.vognetwork.com
7057000	7059000	Brad, our buddy from Pod Culture
7059000	7061000	Who has renamed himself
7061000	7063000	PS4 Culture tonight
7063000	7065000	Says his co-host Glenn bought a Vita
7065000	7067000	Just for the PlayStation 4 tie-in stuff
7067000	7069000	Wow
7069000	7071000	That's a heck of a purchase
7071000	7073000	But hey, if you can do it, why not?
7073000	7075000	Alright
7075000	7077000	More news, Dark Sakura
7077000	7079000	Taking a different turn here
7079000	7081000	Well, game politics has alerted us to something
7081000	7083000	Remember how we kept talking about
7083000	7085000	The 38 Studios and their
7085000	7087000	Sort of
7087000	7089000	Down turn with the
7089000	7091000	Local economy in Rhode Island
7091000	7093000	Yes, that was the one that was owned by
7093000	7095000	What was the name, Curt Schilling, the baseball player, right?
7095000	7097000	You are correct
7097000	7099000	The kingdom of Amalur
7099000	7101000	Exactly
7101000	7103000	Which was free on PlayStation Plus
7103000	7105000	Now there's State Senator Dawson
7105000	7107000	Hodgson
7107000	7109000	Who is a Republican, so whatever
7109000	7111000	Is putting out legislation to
7111000	7113000	Basically keep pushing to
7113000	7115000	Have an independent commission investigate
7115000	7117000	What happened with 38 Studios
7117000	7119000	Which, I mean
7119000	7121000	100 million on the state's
7121000	7123000	Debt
7123000	7125000	Is a pretty big deal, especially for such a tiny
7125000	7127000	State, I mean
7127000	7129000	I don't know too much more about Rhode Island
7129000	7131000	I've known people from there
7131000	7133000	The state loaned them money
7133000	7135000	Which is probably the reason for this
7135000	7137000	Which comes right out of
7137000	7139000	You know, tax funds
7139000	7141000	To pay for
7141000	7143000	State improvement
7145000	7147000	Help benefits, that type of thing
7147000	7149000	So I can see them wanting to
7149000	7151000	To
7151000	7153000	Investigate this
7153000	7155000	And one thing that he said
7155000	7157000	I know that I'm not alone
7157000	7159000	In the belief that the response of our government
7159000	7161000	Has been wholly insufficient to the task of delivering
7161000	7163000	Answers, accountability, and leadership
7163000	7165000	In the wake of this massive destruction
7165000	7167000	Of public resources
7167000	7169000	Swift enactment of the bill and diligent
7169000	7171000	Prosecution of its mandate would vindicate these needs
7171000	7173000	And I get where they're coming from
7173000	7175000	At the same time
7175000	7177000	I wonder
7177000	7179000	If it's just something that
7179000	7181000	Is time to let go
7181000	7183000	Let go, move forward, find other ways of raising
7183000	7185000	The funds, because you can't
7187000	7189000	Get water from a stone
7189000	7191000	Unless you happen to be squeezing cheese
7191000	7193000	Yeah, I mean I understand the reason why
7193000	7195000	They might want to do the investigation
7195000	7197000	But at the same time, it's like one of those
7197000	7199000	Well, it's not going to get the money back
7199000	7201000	You know, what
7201000	7203000	Ultimate good is it really going to do
7203000	7205000	I mean, I guess they can
7205000	7207000	Make sure this never happens again
7207000	7209000	But I kind of think a lesson
7209000	7211000	Has certainly already been learned somewhere
7211000	7213000	But maybe it's about holding certain people accountable
7213000	7215000	I don't know
7215000	7217000	I do think accountability is something
7217000	7219000	To look into
7219000	7221000	But at the same time, I'm wondering if perhaps
7221000	7223000	The state might have been a little short-sighted
7223000	7225000	With the company in the middle of a recession
7225000	7227000	Were they starry-eyed
7227000	7229000	At the fact it was a sports star?
7229000	7231000	Probably
7231000	7233000	Did you hear that they found a full
7233000	7235000	Finished game on their servers
7235000	7237000	That they're going to now auction off in December
7237000	7239000	Really? No
7239000	7241000	There was another game that was literally done
7241000	7243000	It was for Mac, actually
7243000	7245000	It was a PC game
7245000	7247000	Weird, some sort of tactics game
7247000	7249000	Well, they should do it
7249000	7251000	I thought that was kind of funny
7251000	7253000	Well, Rhode Island paid for it
7253000	7255000	Why didn't you sell it?
7255000	7257000	You could have made some money back
7257000	7259000	Yeah, a little bit
7259000	7261000	The sad thing is it probably won't sell for very much money
7261000	7263000	Because nobody knows about it
7263000	7265000	It's got not a lot behind it
7265000	7267000	Probably go at bargain-basement prices
7267000	7269000	And somebody will flip it and do pretty well with it
7269000	7271000	We'll see
7271000	7273000	Alright, let's move on
7273000	7275000	Loki
7275000	7277000	So let's talk about
7277000	7279000	Zune
7279000	7281000	And the fact that
7281000	7283000	I think we already knew it was kind of shutting down
7283000	7285000	But it's
7285000	7287000	It's going away
7287000	7289000	As soon as the Xbox One launch
7289000	7291000	And yeah
7291000	7293000	They're not going to support rental purchasing
7293000	7295000	Or browsing of content
7295000	7297000	And it's going to be
7297000	7299000	I guess now everything is being taken care of
7299000	7301000	Through Xbox Music
7301000	7303000	I guess if you're a previous Zune user
7303000	7305000	And you log into the
7305000	7307000	Xbox Music service
7307000	7309000	It will show your library
7309000	7311000	As a virtual collector
7311000	7313000	And I guess any previous purchase
7313000	7315000	Video content
7315000	7317000	Will transfer over
7317000	7319000	So that's good
7319000	7321000	It's too bad
7321000	7323000	They really tried to
7323000	7325000	They tried to make Zune happen
7325000	7327000	They really tried
7327000	7329000	They sort of tried to compete with the iPods
7329000	7331000	And it just didn't quite happen
7331000	7333000	We had a nice listing in the Zune Cast Store
7333000	7335000	For a while
7335000	7337000	Thanks to the new listeners we got through Zune Cast
7337000	7339000	Sorry to hear about what happened to your Zune
7339000	7341000	But you know, it is what it is
7341000	7343000	So
7343000	7345000	Alright, well in
7345000	7347000	Somewhat brighter news I guess on the Microsoft
7347000	7349000	Front, one of the games that people are
7349000	7351000	Very excited about on Xbox One
7351000	7353000	Killer Instinct
7353000	7355000	And almost more so because of Killer Instinct Classic
7355000	7357000	It's not just the fact that there's the new Killer Instinct
7357000	7359000	Heck yeah
7359000	7361000	But that you can play the classic Killer Instinct as well
7361000	7363000	The Ultra Edition
7363000	7365000	Is coming out of the classic Killer Instinct
7365000	7367000	It will have two versions
7367000	7369000	Of the arcade version
7369000	7371000	Of Killer Instinct, obviously it's not the
7371000	7373000	Super Nintendo version, I mean right
7373000	7375000	So Killer Instinct will get
7375000	7377000	The arcade versions
7377000	7379000	Killer Instinct Classic will have the original
7379000	7381000	Arcade version, version 1.4
7381000	7383000	And the upgraded
7383000	7385000	ROM revision 1.5D
7385000	7387000	Which has glitch fixes
7387000	7389000	Infinite combos that were discovered
7389000	7391000	After the game's initial releases
7391000	7393000	Were fixed
7393000	7395000	Also some emulating scamline
7395000	7397000	Options
7397000	7399000	A training mode is there now though
7399000	7401000	And sprite galleries will be available
7401000	7403000	So that's pretty cool
7403000	7405000	The Killer Instinct Classic
7405000	7407000	It is only available in Killer Instinct
7407000	7409000	Ultra Edition
7409000	7411000	And the boxed pin Ultimate Edition
7411000	7413000	You will not be able to buy it separately
7413000	7415000	So if you want this, you have to buy
7415000	7417000	The free to play Killer Instinct game
7417000	7419000	That's the only way to do it
7419000	7421000	But there's definitely a lot of
7421000	7423000	I know people that are going to be buying it
7423000	7425000	Just so they can have the classic version
7425000	7427000	Because you know what, Killer Instinct
7427000	7429000	Especially the classic version was awesome
7429000	7431000	And it will have more characters than the new one
7431000	7433000	That's the sad part
7433000	7435000	They announced
7435000	7437000	Full Gore
7437000	7439000	For what it's worth, Full Gore
7439000	7441000	The classic one is way better than the new one
7441000	7443000	Alright
7443000	7445000	You know what's way better each and every week
7445000	7447000	Is our mailbag
7447000	7449000	Guys at our email address
7449000	7451000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
7451000	7453000	Dark Soccer
7453000	7455000	Is going to dive into the mailbag head first
7455000	7457000	And find some emails that she
7457000	7459000	Deems worthy of reading on the show
7459000	7461000	And I imagine after a week off we have quite the backlog
7461000	7462000	No?
7462000	7464000	A few
7464000	7466000	There is a really
7466000	7468000	Long one that I'm just
7468000	7470000	Going to
7470000	7472000	Only read the first paragraph
7472000	7474000	Because this is really
7474000	7476000	Fucking long
7477000	7479000	And I'm not going to read the uber novel
7479000	7481000	Sorry
7481000	7483000	It's from
7483000	7485000	RawStillUT
7485000	7487000	Well in a few hours I'll be waiting
7487000	7489000	In a midnight line for the PS4 at my local GameStop
7489000	7491000	So I thought I would shoot you guys an email before that
7491000	7493000	Anyway when talking about the news
7493000	7495000	That define the generation
7495000	7497000	I am surprised that Brown vs Entertainment Merchants Association
7497000	7499000	Wasn't brought up
7499000	7501000	With all the talk of blaming video games for society's ills
7501000	7503000	It's hard to argue with a 7 to 2 decision
7503000	7505000	When the time comes
7505000	7507000	For another state to try and strip the gaming industry
7507000	7509000	Of its right to free expression
7509000	7511000	After all, even if a law could be narrowly
7511000	7513000	Tailored to
7513000	7515000	Alito and Roberts
7515000	7517000	I am not sure
7517000	7519000	Which I'm not sure
7519000	7521000	Even can happen in the current political climate
7521000	7523000	It still leaves 5 justices
7523000	7525000	Who were pretty much close to the idea
7525000	7527000	Outright
7527000	7529000	Whoever eventually replaces the older members of the court
7529000	7531000	Will almost certainly be more aware of gaming as a medium
7531000	7533000	And California's already beaten economy
7533000	7535000	Was done no favors
7535000	7537000	By the massive reimbursement they had to give the EMA
7537000	7539000	No doubt we'll continue to see
7539000	7541000	Scumbag politicians try to pass
7541000	7543000	Feel-good legislations restricting game content
7543000	7545000	We're probably not going to see
7545000	7547000	Yet another case go to the Supreme Court
7547000	7549000	Anytime soon
7549000	7551000	As they tend not to listen to the same issues
7551000	7553000	That often
7553000	7555000	This case has given us a huge buffer
7555000	7557000	And while we can't take anything for granted
7557000	7559000	It's hard to see where we'll see
7559000	7561000	Much more than summary dismissals
7561000	7563000	Of the sort of poorly written
7563000	7565000	Headline chasing tripe legislation
7565000	7567000	I love that term, tripe legislation
7567000	7569000	That had defined the previous
7569000	7571000	Decade
7571000	7573000	I'll go so far as to say this will define the next generation
7573000	7575000	As well
7575000	7577000	That is a good pick of something
7577000	7579000	That kind of fell off of our radars
7579000	7581000	I'm not going to deny that that is a very good selection
7581000	7583000	I think one reason
7583000	7585000	That maybe we don't think
7585000	7587000	Of it right away compared to some of the other things
7587000	7589000	We talked about last week is because we did kind of dodge a bullet
7589000	7591000	And I think in a lot of our minds
7591000	7593000	Yeah, this is the way it should be
7593000	7595000	Duh!
7595000	7597000	Oh, the whole fact that the Supreme Court
7597000	7599000	Decided to say that this is a bad idea
7599000	7601000	Duh! We all knew it was a bad idea
7601000	7603000	So no harm no foul, right?
7603000	7605000	I'm not belittling
7605000	7607000	The response because I think
7607000	7609000	Yeah, absolutely, this is a decision
7609000	7611000	By the Supreme Court that impacts
7611000	7613000	Gaming, period
7613000	7615000	But I think that's why
7615000	7617000	A lot of us kind of neglect to remember it
7617000	7619000	Because it's kind of like, well, they ended up
7619000	7621000	On our side like they should have been
7621000	7623000	So, la di da, didn't really change anything
7623000	7625000	At the end of the day, hooray
7625000	7627000	Anyway
7627000	7629000	And I always have to give it
7629000	7631000	To Rossdale, UT for
7631000	7633000	Definitely bringing up points
7633000	7635000	That are
7635000	7637000	Definitely apt
7637000	7639000	When it comes to comparing
7639000	7641000	What you see in
7641000	7643000	The current generation of gaming
7643000	7645000	Especially with bringing up how
7645000	7647000	We are on that line from changing
7647000	7649000	Sort of how we're thinking
7649000	7651000	Of our games
7651000	7653000	To how we used to think of our games
7653000	7655000	It really is a line that's been crossed
7655000	7657000	Too many of the people now
7657000	7659000	That are in charge of the industry
7659000	7661000	Were people like us
7661000	7663000	Who grew up with it and now see it
7663000	7665000	As a true medium of expression
7665000	7667000	As opposed to
7667000	7669000	You know, just bang bang
7669000	7671000	Yeah, I seem to remember that whole
7671000	7673000	Supreme Court decision thing
7673000	7675000	I think the justice knew what Mortal Kombat was
7675000	7677000	Because he or she
7677000	7679000	I don't remember which justice it was
7679000	7681000	Had interns or people
7681000	7683000	In the office that knew the game and played it a lot
7683000	7685000	So, I remember
7685000	7687000	I just remember that that was
7687000	7689000	I don't have the story in front of me so I don't remember the details
7689000	7691000	I remember that was something out of it that I found fascinating
7691000	7693000	It's like, hey, the Supreme Court knows Mortal Kombat
7693000	7695000	It's not just a niche thing
7695000	7697000	Dan's old boss named his daughter
7697000	7699000	Melina
7699000	7701000	Because his wife wouldn't let him name her Katana
7701000	7703000	This is corporate boss
7703000	7705000	I like the name Melina a lot
7705000	7707000	Not even just because of Mortal Kombat
7707000	7709000	I actually met the guy, he's pretty cool
7709000	7711000	But still, you know
7711000	7713000	Robin Williams named his daughter Zelda
7713000	7715000	True
7715000	7717000	So
7717000	7719000	Moving on, and sorry Russell
7719000	7721000	You'd see the rest of the email was just way too long
7721000	7723000	But I did glance over it
7723000	7725000	This comes from
7725000	7727000	Nark
7727000	7729000	Which was a great 90's arcade
7729000	7731000	90's arcade game by the way
7731000	7733000	But this is with a Q and not with a C
7733000	7735000	Oh, you're like Joystick
7735000	7737000	The AOL block
7737000	7739000	Well, I'm weighing in a little late on the matter
7739000	7741000	But I believe there is an overarching theme
7741000	7743000	That connects the defining game
7743000	7745000	With the defining news for the past generation
7745000	7747000	That is online everything
7747000	7749000	Someone mentioned crowdfunding
7749000	7751000	And an ME3 multiplayer
7751000	7753000	It hasn't been that long
7753000	7755000	Since well launched
7755000	7757000	Now there are so many MMOs
7757000	7759000	That once had spins
7759000	7761000	Although Ragnarok Online was the best of them
7761000	7763000	And now you have MMOs being funded
7763000	7765000	Produced by the community
7765000	7767000	Star Citizen doesn't even exist
7767000	7769000	And the players are already pumped for over
7769000	7771000	Already pumped over 25 million dollars
7771000	7773000	Into it
7773000	7775000	And that's not the news story of the generation
7775000	7777000	And if that's not, I can't read today
7777000	7779000	If that's not the news story of the generation
7779000	7781000	I don't know what would be more poignant
7781000	7783000	So online everything
7783000	7785000	But if I had to narrow it down
7785000	7787000	World of Warcraft is the defining game of our generation
7787000	7789000	Like the game or not
7789000	7791000	And even the Star Citizen crowdfunding
7791000	7793000	Story is this generation's defining news event
7793000	7795000	Great topic, game on
7795000	7797000	Nark
7797000	7799000	I'm thinking of Pinky
7799000	7801000	From Pinky and the Brain
7801000	7803000	Instead of Nark
7803000	7805000	Here's the one reason
7805000	7807000	I respectfully disagree with your choice
7807000	7809000	Of World of Warcraft is because the game
7809000	7811000	Came out in 2004
7811000	7813000	Was it 2003? 2004? I think it was 2004
7813000	7815000	During the last generation
7815000	7817000	Because this generation didn't really start till
7817000	7819000	2005-06 depending on
7819000	7821000	You know, if PS3 or 360 kicked it off
7821000	7823000	So that's my one
7823000	7825000	Slight
7825000	7827000	Dispute with that, but otherwise
7827000	7829000	Honestly, I'm not invalidating any of your points
7829000	7831000	Because the rest of it's all very good
7831000	7833000	And you know, with the Kickstarter
7833000	7835000	And all that, absolutely
7835000	7837000	And Gene says, he's naming his first child
7837000	7839000	Baraka
7839000	7841000	Which is better, Baraka or Blanca?
7843000	7845000	Food for thought
7845000	7847000	If you want your kid going around being named white
7847000	7849000	No with a K
7849000	7851000	Wasn't that uh
7851000	7853000	Yeah, but still
7853000	7855000	Hello peoples
7855000	7857000	I'd like to extend my gratitude for Loki
7857000	7859000	For the VoG Grand Theft Auto online community event
7859000	7861000	That was held tonight, Friday night
7861000	7863000	I'm sure it was a good time for those of you
7863000	7865000	Who could stay connected to the game
7865000	7867000	Unfortunately, I could not
7867000	7869000	The reason for this lies not with Rockstar Games
7869000	7871000	Anyone I was attempting to play with
7871000	7873000	The reason I couldn't stay connected is due to my
7873000	7875000	So-called broadband
7875000	7877000	Uh
7877000	7879000	DS fucking L
7879000	7881000	Okay, oh never mind
7881000	7883000	DS fucking L
7883000	7885000	My failed attempts to play Grand Theft Auto online
7885000	7887000	With the VoG community has only given me more
7887000	7889000	Incentive to achieve my long-held goal
7889000	7891000	I will accomplish project buy a house
7891000	7893000	And when I do, I will get
7893000	7895000	Cable internet, string cat5
7895000	7897000	Throughout my house, and finally achieve the true
7897000	7899000	Broadband gaming dream
7899000	7901000	I have only dreamed of
7901000	7903000	I will do this, I will stay
7903000	7905000	Blackwatertainment trainer
7905000	7907000	You know what
7907000	7909000	Um, you also want to look into your router
7909000	7911000	If you're going to do the ultimate
7911000	7913000	Uh
7913000	7915000	The ultimate uh
7915000	7917000	Wi-Fi or
7917000	7919000	Internet experience
7919000	7921000	Don't use whatever your
7921000	7923000	Provider gives you
7923000	7925000	Goodbye your own
7925000	7927000	It's also partially, I think, Rockstar as well
7927000	7929000	I had trouble connecting it
7929000	7931000	Some of the times I was getting disconnected from stuff
7931000	7933000	I blame everything on
7933000	7935000	Rockstars because they make me too jittery
7937000	7939000	Anyway, um
7939000	7941000	This one, uh, here is
7941000	7943000	An update for OLR
7943000	7945000	It's been six months since my wife Tracy
7945000	7947000	Passed away from a stroke at 47
7947000	7949000	Uh, when I called in
7949000	7951000	I was being- Oh, I remember this one
7951000	7953000	Yes, when I called in I was being
7953000	7955000	Evicted from the house I was renting and had to
7955000	7957000	Move in with a friend, the sad part is
7957000	7959000	That re-
7959000	7961000	Is that really happened and I thought I was
7961000	7963000	Going to have to get a second job just to survive
7963000	7965000	I was getting depressed but was surviving
7965000	7967000	I still listen to the podcast regularly for
7967000	7969000	A smile, I got more
7969000	7971000	From the retirement system she was in than I figured
7971000	7973000	Being a responsible adult
7973000	7975000	Bites, I could have flown to Vegas and partied
7975000	7977000	I paid off my SUV five years early
7977000	7979000	And now I have no car payment, I paid off the bills
7979000	7981000	Left over from the last place, I bought
7981000	7983000	Myself a new 55
7983000	7985000	Inch 3D TV, I will be getting
7985000	7987000	An Xbox One and I
7987000	7989000	Find one and a new
7989000	7991000	No, when I find one and a new laptop
7991000	7993000	For gaming, thank you for all your prayers
7993000	7995000	It looks like I will be okay, I would call in
7995000	7997000	But I am East Coast and work Monday
7997000	7999000	I'm happy
7999000	8001000	To hear that follow up, those of you that were here
8001000	8003000	Six months ago I'm sure remember that was
8003000	8005000	I think in the 12 years that we've been doing OLR
8005000	8007000	It was the hardest phone call we've ever taken on the show
8007000	8009000	Yeah, I'm just gonna guess on a
8009000	8011000	Nickname that's a name in lights
8011000	8013000	I believe that's right
8013000	8015000	He's a really good guy
8015000	8017000	We chat on Facebook all the damn time
8017000	8019000	Yeah, he used to do wow with us too
8019000	8025000	So that whole thing though was really a testament to the power of community
8025000	8033000	Yeah, I get warm fuzzies hearing that it's gonna be okay for him
8033000	8036000	And I'm glad to hear it's gonna be okay
8036000	8038000	And I'm sure the listeners appreciate it
8039000	8041000	Even if it's six months later it's really nice to know
8041000	8043000	Thank you
8043000	8045000	Stay in touch
8045000	8047000	One more email
8047000	8049000	Howdy guys and gal, smile
8049000	8051000	Yes, thank you for acknowledging my womanhood
8051000	8055000	Nice tits
8055000	8058000	I was acknowledging your womanhood
8058000	8060000	Yes, they are quite nice
8060000	8062000	I have a gorgeous rack
8062000	8064000	I get complimented on it daily
8064000	8066000	Firstly, although we missed you last week
8066000	8068000	I hope you all had a fantastic week off
8068000	8070000	I did sleeping so that was great
8070000	8072000	I went to Disneyland and BlizzCon
8072000	8074000	It was amazing
8074000	8077000	Okay, now that we have the touchy feely bullshit out of the way
8077000	8079000	Oh hey
8079000	8081000	A couple weeks ago I was watching Under Sedation Live
8081000	8083000	Which you can view and participate live every Saturday night
8083000	8086000	At 10pm EST on vognetwork.com
8086000	8088000	Are you on Travis Donovan's payroll?
8088000	8090000	Are you on his payroll?
8090000	8092000	Who is this?
8092000	8094000	Are you on Travis' payroll?
8094000	8096000	Did he offer you vog points?
8096000	8098000	Travis and Jessica were talking about cult movies
8098000	8101000	Of the 90's, Boondock Saints, Cutthroat Island and Hackers
8101000	8105000	This conversation got me to thinking of cult video games
8105000	8107000	And what makes a cult game
8107000	8109000	Is a cult game a game that people enjoy
8109000	8111000	Despite the low review scores like Too Human?
8111000	8114000	Is a cult game a game that did not have a stellar launch
8114000	8117000	But managed to gain a huge following such as Demon's Souls?
8117000	8119000	Is a cult game a game that people like to play
8119000	8122000	Despite the low sales numbers such as Bulletstorm and Shadows of the Damned?
8122000	8124000	I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this
8124000	8127000	And I'm eager to find out what you consider a cult game
8127000	8130000	I'm also interested in finding out what your favorite cult game is
8130000	8132000	Not so sincerely, Degenerate Johnny
8132000	8134000	AKA Rob's Parody Songwriter
8134000	8136000	Thanks
8136000	8138000	Thank you for not bringing that to this show
8138000	8140000	That's a really good question
8140000	8144000	And for the record, even though Travis gives me shit all the time on Under Sedation Live
8144000	8146000	You really all should check out that show
8146000	8148000	They have a lot of fun over there
8148000	8151000	It's a bummer though y'all missed episode 6-66
8151000	8155000	Because I live for DJ Satan who was on that show
8155000	8157000	Anyway, sorry
8157000	8161000	But I just wanted to go ahead and let that plug air a little bit
8161000	8163000	As far as the question on hand
8163000	8165000	What makes a cult video game?
8165000	8168000	Degenerate Johnny, I think it's kind of all those things that you named
8168000	8170000	I don't think, there's no definition
8170000	8173000	You don't go to the dictionary and see what makes a cult game
8173000	8175000	I think it's a little bit of all those things
8175000	8177000	And I think the definition is a little different for everybody
8177000	8179000	Well that and also when you have
8179000	8182000	I think you should also look at the factor of
8182000	8185000	Well this is more like hipster game I would think
8185000	8190000	When you have people outside of an age group the game is intended for
8190000	8192000	Playing the game
8192000	8194000	Like, I hate to say it
8194000	8196000	Pokemon
8196000	8198000	Pokemon's totally a cult game
8198000	8202000	But does that label really fit when Pokemon is like a hugely selling game
8202000	8205000	See that's why I relabeled it a hipster game
8205000	8207000	Definitely a cult of Pokemon
8207000	8209000	I was going to say one of the biggest cult games there is is World of Warcraft
8209000	8213000	Yeah, but now it's doing well
8213000	8215000	It's such a huge game
8215000	8217000	I feel weird calling that a cult game too
8217000	8219000	This is how I look at it too
8219000	8222000	Maybe when you have something's popularity
8222000	8225000	Emerge after it was supposed to have its heyday
8225000	8227000	For example, look at Rocky
8227000	8229000	Rocky Horror Picture Show
8229000	8232000	Yeah, the play was pretty good
8232000	8234000	And had pretty decent following when the movie came out
8234000	8236000	Didn't it tank?
8236000	8238000	Yes, the movie originally tanked
8238000	8240000	It was based on a play
8240000	8242000	But the movie originally tanked
8242000	8244000	Which I've seen the play finally
8244000	8246000	They noticed that in New York or somewhere
8246000	8248000	A lot of the same people were going to see it over and over again
8248000	8250000	And they started doing the midnight showing
8250000	8253000	And the minute that somebody yelled
8253000	8255000	Buy an umbrella you cheap bitch
8255000	8257000	At the screen, things changed forever
8257000	8259000	Well yeah, but I mean that's the thing that you have
8259000	8262000	Popularity is of a different sort
8262000	8265000	Than what was intended when the movie came out
8265000	8267000	Correct?
8267000	8269000	So I think that if you look at
8269000	8271000	For example
8271000	8273000	Portal, okay
8273000	8276000	I think Portal was just sort of a throw in kind of game
8276000	8279000	It was meant to be a fun little puzzler
8279000	8281000	But it's the whole
8281000	8284000	Quirkiness of it that really got it a huge following
8284000	8286000	And maybe got people
8286000	8290000	Got people moving outside of whatever was written in the game
8290000	8292000	Into the retarded vant-
8292000	8294000	I hate using that word, why am I saying it?
8294000	8296000	Into the crazy-
8296000	8298000	Leo-tarded
8298000	8300000	Leo-tarded
8300000	8302000	That's what they say on Drag Race, totally Leo-tarded
8302000	8306000	But I hate using that word because I do know people who
8306000	8308000	Anyway
8308000	8310000	Sorry
8310000	8312000	Oh yeah, and if you want to go for
8312000	8314000	Like Jean just said, Shock Treatment, Ultra Cult
8314000	8316000	Oh my god, Shock Treatment
8316000	8318000	Shock Treatment's fucking hilarious
8318000	8320000	You have to watch Shock Treatment like seven times before it even makes sense
8320000	8322000	But the music is really good
8322000	8324000	I need a bit of ooh
8324000	8326000	Shock Treatment
8326000	8328000	You remember when we ate the hacker cookies
8328000	8330000	When Evan lived with Jessica
8330000	8334000	And these were cookies that were made with so much chocolate and no doughs
8334000	8336000	That I was shaking after two of them
8336000	8338000	I remember when I got really sick
8338000	8340000	In 2008
8340000	8342000	I was actually supposed to be in a shadow cast
8342000	8344000	Of Shock Treatment playing Ricky from the Rest Home
8344000	8346000	I had to drop out because
8346000	8348000	That was the year I got really sick and I had to go to the hospital
8348000	8350000	So somebody replaced me
8350000	8352000	But anyway
8352000	8356000	Well, SSJ100Matt is saying that Darkstalkers is a cult franchise
8356000	8358000	But- Kinda
8358000	8360000	Yeah, kinda, it wasn't as
8360000	8362000	Overly successful as most of Capcom's other things
8362000	8364000	But see, it was always in the circles
8364000	8366000	I lived in arcades with fighting games
8366000	8368000	So they always had people on it
8368000	8370000	I think a cult game is that game
8370000	8372000	Is that game that everybody
8372000	8374000	Asks for a sequel for
8374000	8376000	That you're never gonna get
8376000	8378000	Like Shenmue is a great example of a cult game
8378000	8380000	Like Half Life
8380000	8382000	Half Life by that definition
8382000	8384000	Is definitely a cult game
8384000	8386000	Or I was gonna joke Mega Man is now a cult game
8386000	8388000	As of recent
8388000	8390000	You know what a good example though of the
8390000	8392000	I think
8392000	8394000	Blaster Master is a great example of a cult game
8394000	8396000	Yes, it got some sequels
8396000	8398000	But they were worse than Shock Treatment
8398000	8400000	Let's be real
8400000	8402000	It's hard to be worse unless you're Yaris
8402000	8404000	What if Yaris got a sequel?
8404000	8406000	The Wii remake wasn't awful
8406000	8408000	But that's not saying much
8408000	8410000	I'll give you another example of a great cult game
8410000	8412000	Because I don't think people know this one
8412000	8414000	Very well, Cultcept
8414000	8416000	Talked about this in the game before
8416000	8418000	It's that whole like Magic the Gathering meets Monopoly
8418000	8420000	I love that game
8420000	8422000	But there's like one on the 360
8422000	8424000	And on the Playstation 2 and that's really it
8424000	8426000	I think it's bigger in Japan
8426000	8428000	There's a lot of points in the chat
8428000	8430000	Rama brings up Rival Schools
8430000	8432000	Being more than Darkstalkers
8432000	8434000	Which I fully agree with
8434000	8436000	And I fucking love Rival Schools
8436000	8438000	And the people who love Rival Schools
8438000	8440000	Really fucking love Rival Schools
8440000	8442000	And Jean says PSO2 in the US
8442000	8444000	Which I was totally into PSO2 for a little while
8444000	8446000	And then there's Final Fantasy
8446000	8448000	And Queen Samia says
8448000	8450000	Any Bimani game
8450000	8452000	In America, yes
8452000	8454000	I would say
8454000	8456000	VR got super super popular
8456000	8458000	And now it's fallen into
8458000	8460000	Because of the cult status the imports had over here
8460000	8462000	Now it's more in the mainstream
8464000	8466000	But as far as I was aware
8466000	8468000	In Japan, popin' music is everywhere
8468000	8470000	And everyone fucking plays popin' music
8470000	8472000	I love this
8472000	8474000	Technus says those Burger King games
8474000	8476000	Yeah, those
8476000	8478000	Sneak King was a cult game of sorts
8478000	8480000	Or fuck, everyone I knew that played Ragnarok online
8480000	8482000	Because that game was like
8482000	8484000	Oh, we have 3D games
8484000	8486000	No, fuck you, we're playing our 2D little MMO
8486000	8488000	SSG100Matt says
8488000	8490000	So Chrono Trigger would be considered cult
8490000	8492000	No, because you got Chrono Cross
8492000	8494000	I'm just trollin'
8494000	8496000	Chrono Trigger was pretty popular
8496000	8498000	It is a cult game of sorts
8498000	8500000	Rageinator says Earthbound
8500000	8502000	Kinda, yeah
8502000	8504000	Kid Icarus for a long time
8504000	8506000	I would definitely call it a cult game
8506000	8508000	In fact, in some ways it still is
8508000	8510000	I would not consider that one a cult
8510000	8512000	Um
8512000	8514000	Pig bumpin'
8514000	8516000	We had that
8516000	8518000	Because the Parappa series
8518000	8520000	For what it was
8520000	8522000	It took off, I think, bigger
8522000	8524000	In a way than it was supposed to
8524000	8526000	And then Umjramalami
8526000	8528000	And Parappa 2, those are sequels
8528000	8530000	So I'm not gonna really count them as much
8530000	8532000	Now I will agree with Skullgirls
8532000	8534000	Because that game is
8534000	8536000	Pretty fun
8536000	8538000	It wasn't getting a whole lot of attention
8538000	8540000	But you have your dedicated
8540000	8542000	Fan base to it
8542000	8544000	And because of that, we've had the Kickstarter go in
8544000	8546000	A lot more of that too
8546000	8548000	So yeah, Skullgirls is a pretty recent one
8548000	8550000	Or maybe even La Mulana
8550000	8552000	You know
8552000	8554000	La Mulana is definitely a cult game
8554000	8556000	If your name is Dark Tetsuya
8556000	8558000	Cave Story
8558000	8560000	Ooh, that's a good one too
8560000	8562000	This is a great topic, but we are dragging it out
8562000	8564000	Yeah, it's time to move it on
8565000	8567000	But great question, love it
8567000	8569000	Yeah, and we definitely
8569000	8573000	Sort of discussed a little bit of what defines a cult game
8573000	8575000	And Travis will now be able to say
8575000	8577000	Yet again, they jacked another segment for my show
8577000	8579000	And you know what I say?
8579000	8581000	Nothing, because it's a gesture
8586000	8588000	And just remember, that saying
8588000	8590000	Love you, just a really strong love you
8590000	8592000	Love it
8592000	8594000	It's a very deep kind of love
8594000	8596000	It's a very thrusty, deep kind of love
8596000	8598000	Alright
8598000	8600000	Speaking of thrusty, deep kind of love
8600000	8602000	Thank you to all you guys that emailed us tonight
8602000	8604000	And those of you that will email next week
8604000	8606000	In advance, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com
8606000	8608000	Is the place to send those emails
8608000	8610000	Well, right along with that gesture
8610000	8612000	We'll cue a new segment
8612000	8614000	Or not a new segment, a new segment?
8614000	8616000	We need a new segment
8616000	8618000	It's a brand new segment here on the show
8618000	8620000	We've been doing it since episode one
8620000	8622000	We're growing segments like bugs
8622000	8624000	You wanna get a new segment on the show?
8624000	8626000	We should get a new segment for OLR
8626000	8628000	What should the new OLR segment be?
8628000	8630000	Tweet us ideas
8630000	8632000	We'll crowdsource this
8632000	8634000	The OLR shit list
8634000	8636000	New OLR segment
8636000	8638000	Tweet us your ideas
8638000	8640000	And I'm not bringing you back website of the week
8640000	8642000	But, if we get a new segment
8642000	8644000	Then an old segment's gotta go
8644000	8646000	No
8646000	8648000	We'll just live here forever
8648000	8650000	I'm just gonna live under your table here
8650000	8652000	And eventually Sanrio will like me
8652000	8654000	Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week
8670000	8672000	Fuck you to me
8672000	8674000	Not having a job yet
8674000	8676000	And I'm still waiting back to hear
8676000	8678000	From Cool Job
8678000	8680000	As I've been referring to it
8680000	8682000	In writing Cool Job with a trademark
8682000	8684000	Um
8684000	8686000	It's really just very difficult
8686000	8688000	To find work
8688000	8690000	And, you know, Dan and I
8690000	8692000	Are actually gonna be going out looking at houses next week
8692000	8694000	Cause
8694000	8696000	We feel we're wasting money on rent
8696000	8698000	And trying to
8698000	8700000	You know, it's really hard
8700000	8702000	To improve your situation when you are not
8702000	8704000	Given the means to improve your situation
8704000	8706000	And all those people who are
8706000	8708000	Bootstrap theorists
8708000	8710000	Fuck you very much
8710000	8712000	Fuck you
8712000	8714000	Loki?
8714000	8716000	Fuck you to Cookie Clicker
8716000	8718000	I agree, fuck you to Cookie Clicker
8718000	8720000	Do you have a permanent dent in your finger now?
8720000	8722000	Uh, no, but I'm almost done
8722000	8724000	Seriously, I'm almost done
8724000	8726000	Cosdula has somehow arisen
8726000	8728000	I don't know how this has happened
8728000	8730000	But
8730000	8732000	It's part of the game, I guess
8732000	8734000	But he's in the devil
8734000	8736000	Grandmas turn evil
8736000	8738000	Have to do an ancient practice
8738000	8740000	To stop them from being evil
8740000	8742000	Um
8742000	8744000	And I'm cheating, a lot
8744000	8746000	Of course you're cheating, this is Loki we're talking about
8746000	8748000	It's to get done with the game, it's all about the end game
8748000	8750000	You know?
8750000	8752000	Alright, uh, my FU of the week
8752000	8754000	Um, I guess I don't have a lot I'm mad at
8754000	8756000	My FU of the week goes to these holiday candies
8756000	8758000	But
8758000	8760000	And, it's, Alan says they're grandma candy
8760000	8762000	And they totally are
8762000	8764000	It's like the mix, the holiday mix
8764000	8766000	Of those hard candies
8766000	8768000	That grandma always had in a glass jar
8768000	8770000	At her house
8770000	8772000	Kinda, but they're not like
8772000	8774000	Butterscotch or anything
8774000	8776000	Everybody knows, you've seen these, they all clunk
8776000	8778000	Together too, like the hard candies
8778000	8780000	These things are so addicting, I eat them and I've almost
8780000	8782000	Eaten like an entire bag
8782000	8784000	And I wonder why I can't lose weight
8784000	8786000	So FU to
8786000	8788000	Candy for being delicious
8788000	8790000	Bob, you suck
8790000	8792000	What? You can do anything
8792000	8794000	You put your mind to
8794000	8796000	Okay, I wanna be a princess
8796000	8798000	I'm thinking really hard
8800000	8802000	It's not working, Dark Sakura
8802000	8804000	I'm taking this home
8804000	8806000	Are you compensating it?
8806000	8808000	It looks nasty
8808000	8810000	It's really good though
8812000	8814000	It's just that candy pink in it
8814000	8816000	You know? Uh, Codeman in chat says
8816000	8818000	So I come to your house, you will offer me candy
8818000	8820000	Absolutely, if you're gonna make the trip out here
8820000	8822000	From Oklahoma or wherever you are
8822000	8824000	I will absolutely get you candy
8824000	8826000	He only uses it to get people in his car
8826000	8828000	Not his house, in the van
8828000	8830000	You don't have a van yet
8830000	8832000	That's what you think
8832000	8834000	Can I have a bite?
8834000	8836000	That's the perfect alibi right there too
8836000	8838000	I don't have a van, what are you talking about?
8838000	8840000	Alright, that does it for the FUs of the Week
8840000	8842000	Let's get to some more stories and then
8842000	8844000	We are not that far away from the Skype line
8844000	8846000	I'm excited to talk to some folks tonight
8846000	8848000	I hope we get calls tonight
8848000	8850000	1877 Game OLR
8850000	8852000	Or I use the name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio
8852000	8854000	But first, a couple stories for you
8854000	8856000	Sadly we missed a wonderful transition that we would have had
8856000	8858000	Had we gone into the story straight from the mailbag
8858000	8860000	But, you know, whatever
8860000	8862000	So hey, in case you need some more information
8862000	8864000	About which system you should buy
8864000	8866000	For the next generation
8866000	8868000	Pornhub would let you know
8868000	8870000	That hey, they're fully supporting
8870000	8872000	The Playstation 4
8872000	8874000	And you'll be able to view Pornhub
8874000	8876000	And all of its video content
8876000	8878000	Through the Playstation 4's web browser
8882000	8884000	Nice
8884000	8886000	So that's why I was joking
8886000	8888000	Does Pornhub offer the freaky porn though?
8888000	8890000	I only like the really crazy stuff
8890000	8892000	I will never forget that New Years
8892000	8894000	It was like 2007 or something
8894000	8896000	With the pterodactyl porn on the Wii
8896000	8898000	That was the most hilarious thing I've ever seen in my life
8898000	8900000	That is a good question
8900000	8902000	One that we should just look up the answer to
8902000	8904000	Why not?
8904000	8906000	You have to do some research here
8906000	8908000	It's, you know, it's strange
8908000	8910000	But let's see
8910000	8912000	Dinosaur
8912000	8914000	Hey, that's weird that that came up as a recommended
8914000	8916000	Yes, it has dinosaur porn on there
8916000	8918000	So you are all set
8918000	8920000	Dinosaurs? Like the old ABC sitcom?
8920000	8922000	Dinosaurs as in like CG dinosaurs
8922000	8924000	And they even
8924000	8926000	And
8926000	8928000	And someone that's dressed in green
8928000	8930000	I don't know
8930000	8932000	But yes, they do have dinosaur
8932000	8934000	Pornography
8934000	8936000	You'll be happy to know
8936000	8938000	Alright, anyway
8938000	8940000	Very happy to hear that
8940000	8942000	Congratulations Playstation 4 for
8942000	8944000	Definitively winning the console wars with that
8944000	8946000	Although, we all know
8946000	8948000	If there's any way to do it
8948000	8950000	Pornhub will also show up on Xbox One
8950000	8952000	Of course, well it is Internet Explorer
8952000	8954000	It'll have to happen
8954000	8956000	But here's the thing
8956000	8958000	I always bring triple X rated
8958000	8960000	Video
8960000	8962000	To the actual web stores
8962000	8964000	Like I can go rent a copy of
8964000	8966000	You know, the Dark Knight
8966000	8968000	Returns or
8968000	8970000	The Dark Knight bones some chick
8970000	8972000	In the ass too
8972000	8974000	You know, that's
8974000	8976000	That's how you win the console wars right there
8978000	8980000	Alright, speaking of vulgarities
8980000	8982000	Did you know that South Park
8982000	8984000	Is still on the air? It's in its 17th
8984000	8986000	Season
8986000	8988000	South Park is kind of hit and miss these days
8988000	8990000	It's still worth watching once in a while
8990000	8992000	Especially this past week
8992000	8994000	And I actually watched this episode
8994000	8996000	A friend of mine alerted me to the fact that
8996000	8998000	The latest South Park episode was about the
8998000	9000000	Playstation 4 and Xbox One
9000000	9002000	Console wars
9002000	9004000	They kind of put a Game of Thrones parody into it too
9004000	9006000	It also looks very much like
9006000	9008000	It does
9008000	9010000	Look like their game which made it funny
9010000	9012000	Because there was a part where they totally
9012000	9014000	Shade the fact that their game got delayed
9014000	9016000	Like something about
9016000	9018000	Someone says, who wants to sit around and wait for a stupid
9018000	9020000	Game, a game that's not even that good
9020000	9022000	Oh, then they slam the pre-order
9022000	9024000	Thing, that's what it was, they say like
9024000	9026000	You know, pre-orders are just
9026000	9028000	The way of them dicking you over every time
9028000	9030000	Like they go
9030000	9032000	The five dollars you spend on a pre-order
9032000	9034000	Is just going to some guy who hasn't even
9034000	9036000	Finished the game yet and da da da, like that was the
9036000	9038000	Part, I'm totally not doing it justice
9038000	9040000	Sorry, I don't have it queued up right now
9040000	9042000	But it was worth watching
9042000	9044000	I lulled a couple times
9044000	9046000	I think it's going to be a two-parter
9046000	9048000	Because it didn't really, the ending wasn't really
9048000	9050000	An ending, so
9050000	9052000	It makes sense because they have both consoles coming out
9052000	9054000	Yeah, I'm curious to see if maybe they're going to end it after the
9054000	9056000	Consoles actually come out, I don't know
9056000	9058000	Yes, they actually
9058000	9060000	Split up and choose a side and it's
9060000	9062000	Going to be Playstation 4 fans
9062000	9064000	Versus Xbox One fans
9064000	9066000	And an epic throw down at the mall
9066000	9068000	And they're actually recruiting other clicks for their side
9068000	9070000	Like I think the Sony click had
9070000	9072000	Kyle in it
9072000	9074000	And they recruited the Goth kids
9074000	9076000	I thought they were trying to recruit them
9076000	9078000	But it didn't work, I don't know
9078000	9080000	I don't know, this is way
9080000	9082000	Too much seriousness for an episode of South Park
9082000	9084000	But it's always fun to see
9084000	9086000	This whole stuff get kind of made fun of
9086000	9088000	In the media, who better to make fun of it
9088000	9090000	Than South Park
9090000	9092000	By the way, if you do want to watch the whole episode
9092000	9094000	And actually get the quote that I butchered
9094000	9096000	South Park Studios
9096000	9098000	Has the full episode
9098000	9100000	And Dark Tetsuya in our chat room
9100000	9102000	Says they did confirm on Facebook
9102000	9104000	Part 2 is this coming week
9104000	9106000	So there will be a
9106000	9108000	Part 2, so check that out
9108000	9110000	Jean asks, was Wii U ignored?
9110000	9112000	Of course, of course it was ignored
9112000	9114000	Just like real life
9114000	9116000	This is next gen wars
9116000	9118000	Well
9118000	9120000	Maybe that'll be the twist in the second part
9120000	9122000	Is that they all come together and buy Wii Us
9122000	9124000	I doubt it
9124000	9126000	I highly doubt it
9126000	9128000	I don't think so
9128000	9130000	Alright
9130000	9132000	That's it for stories
9132000	9134000	So I think we can open up the Skype line now
9134000	9136000	1877 Game OLR
9136000	9138000	Or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio
9138000	9140000	If you'd like to give us a call on Skype
9140000	9142000	The Skype line is open
9142000	9144000	And in the meantime
9144000	9146000	We can go to some Twitter topics
9146000	9148000	I know we had a few good ones tonight
9148000	9150000	Also, last minute stories
9150000	9152000	Loki, I don't know if you had any last minute stories
9152000	9154000	No
9154000	9156000	I was gonna mention that there's this teaser site
9156000	9158000	Now it's the Survivor
9158000	9160000	2299
9160000	9162000	That people are thinking might be for Fallout
9162000	9164000	Originally it was thought
9164000	9166000	Oh, maybe it's a fan site because it wasn't registered
9166000	9168000	To the usual Bethesda stuff
9168000	9170000	However, Bethesda
9170000	9172000	Just recently trademarked
9172000	9174000	Fallout 4
9174000	9176000	And also the timing kinda
9176000	9178000	Coincides with the Spike
9178000	9180000	VGX stuff
9180000	9182000	Oh lordy
9182000	9184000	Expect an announcement maybe in December
9184000	9186000	Most likely, let's go to the phones
9186000	9188000	They're lighting up now, we shouldn't have a problem with calls tonight
9188000	9190000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
9190000	9192000	This is Codeman
9192000	9194000	Hey Codeman, how you doing? What's up?
9194000	9196000	Not much, I got some candy here waiting for you
9196000	9198000	I learned that you like
9198000	9200000	Freaky porn on this episode
9200000	9202000	That was kinda weird
9202000	9204000	Freaky porn makes it sound like
9204000	9206000	I'm like this lecherous creepy
9206000	9208000	dude that lives in a basement
9208000	9210000	There's a tonki punch video where they actually dress up
9210000	9212000	Like a donkey, that's funny
9212000	9214000	I like funny porn, Codeman
9214000	9216000	My favorite are the parodies
9216000	9218000	Have you seen the Batman ones?
9218000	9220000	The Batman ones are great because
9220000	9222000	They do it sort of the old
9222000	9224000	Adam West style Batman
9224000	9226000	But it's with the actual
9226000	9228000	characters from now on
9228000	9230000	I think the last one I saw was a parody of Lord of the Rings
9230000	9232000	It literally had a bunch of midgets
9232000	9234000	I remember when you invited me over
9234000	9236000	To see Ali McFeel
9236000	9238000	Ron Jeremy was actually in that
9238000	9240000	And for the record
9240000	9242000	The last one I watched was the Mork and Mindy one
9242000	9246000	I wanted to see the one that was called
9246000	9248000	This Ain't Glee
9248000	9250000	Because now they don't even bother
9250000	9252000	They just say, this ain't whatever
9252000	9254000	Oh wait, I did see another one
9254000	9256000	More recent, I saw Nalen Palin
9256000	9258000	Which is hilarious
9258000	9260000	I know you must have seen
9260000	9262000	Not the Cosby's because we were so fascinated
9262000	9264000	We were so fascinated by the guy
9264000	9266000	The guy that played Bill Cosby
9266000	9268000	In there
9268000	9270000	He never got into any of the scenes
9270000	9272000	But his impression was fantastic
9272000	9274000	And that was the part
9274000	9276000	It was like, we don't give a shit about the porn
9276000	9278000	His impression was just dead on
9278000	9280000	It was hilarious
9280000	9282000	Codeman, I don't know if you actually called to talk about porn
9282000	9284000	But clearly we could do that all night
9284000	9286000	But what's on your mind, buddy?
9286000	9288000	It's all porn and orange lounge radio tonight
9288000	9290000	Orange lounge radio?
9290000	9292000	No, I haven't called in a while
9292000	9294000	I haven't called in a while actually
9294000	9296000	I've been pretty busy with life
9296000	9298000	I guess you could say
9298000	9300000	But no, I just figured I was up tonight
9300000	9302000	And figured I'd call in and just talk
9302000	9304000	PS4, because I
9304000	9306000	I cancelled my pre-order like you did, Rob
9306000	9308000	I'm glad I'm not alone
9308000	9310000	Would you give out your Twitter on the show
9310000	9312000	So that the people that are about to
9312000	9314000	Send me angry tweets after tonight's episode
9314000	9316000	Can send them to you too?
9316000	9318000	Yeah, it's Codeman Games
9318000	9320000	Look it up
9320000	9322000	But I will tell you
9322000	9324000	Xtifer
9324000	9326000	I've been keeping up with his
9326000	9328000	He posted, I think, a RezaGun
9328000	9330000	On Facebook
9330000	9332000	And I'm just like
9332000	9334000	I'm seeing all these videos and I'm like
9334000	9336000	God
9336000	9338000	I should have kept it
9338000	9340000	That's the exact same thing I've been doing
9340000	9342000	And you know what that means
9342000	9344000	All that social media shit that Sony
9344000	9346000	Infused into its console is working
9346000	9348000	This is exactly what they want people to do
9348000	9350000	Actually, for me, it's the opposite
9350000	9352000	Another video of the stupid robot
9352000	9354000	I've already seen that
9354000	9356000	I know what it looks like
9356000	9358000	Well, it's just
9358000	9360000	You see all this stuff and you
9360000	9362000	Cancel it because you know, okay
9362000	9364000	I kind of go with the same thing
9364000	9366000	A console is good at what
9366000	9368000	Games are on them
9368000	9370000	But then you see all these people playing it
9370000	9372000	And you just get this feeling of
9372000	9374000	God, I need this because it's new
9374000	9376000	It's different
9376000	9378000	In a sense, and so you get to this point where you're like
9378000	9380000	Oh my God, I just need this console
9380000	9382000	But you know you have other
9382000	9384000	Things to do and you can't spend that much money
9384000	9386000	On something, but you're just like, oh my God
9386000	9388000	I need it, but at the time, I had the money
9388000	9390000	And I was like, okay, well I have the
9390000	9392000	Pre-order, I'm going to get it and all this stuff
9392000	9394000	And I got to the point where I was just like
9394000	9396000	You know what, there's just no games that are selling
9396000	9398000	The system for me right now
9398000	9400000	About the only thing that was
9400000	9402000	Selling was the RezaGun
9402000	9404000	I wanted to check out
9404000	9406000	What was the
9406000	9408000	What was the little
9408000	9410000	With the little guys
9410000	9412000	And the
9412000	9414000	Playroom? No, not the Playroom
9414000	9416000	It starts with a K
9416000	9418000	Knack
9418000	9420000	I wanted to play Knack because I played
9420000	9422000	A demo of it at Target and I thought it was kind of fun
9422000	9424000	I've heard it's kind of repetitive, but at the same time
9424000	9426000	I don't really care
9426000	9428000	I felt fun when I played it
9428000	9430000	And the controller just felt so
9430000	9432000	Amazing when I played it
9432000	9434000	It's like, oh my God, I should have got one of these
9434000	9436000	But I do have to make a confession
9436000	9438000	I did
9438000	9440000	Sell my Xbox 360
9440000	9442000	And got like
9442000	9444000	Well, and some games and got like
9444000	9446000	300 something dollars for it, so
9446000	9448000	That will be going towards a PS4
9448000	9450000	So I probably will be getting one
9450000	9452000	How about the old and the new and the new?
9452000	9454000	I got some extra systems at my
9454000	9456000	Office that I'm not using, I might as well
9456000	9458000	Just take those in
9458000	9460000	You know, I'm not a big advocate
9460000	9462000	Of the evil G, but today they had
9462000	9464000	A 90% trade-in
9464000	9466000	Value on console, so I was just like
9466000	9468000	Oh wow, why not?
9468000	9470000	Oh dang, I wish I had known that
9470000	9472000	I might have done that
9472000	9474000	Alan and I actually have two
9474000	9476000	Because, you know, when we got together and moved in
9476000	9478000	Together, we both had 360s and PlayStation 3s
9478000	9480000	So we have two PlayStation 3s and two
9480000	9482000	Xbox 360s and there's really no reason for us
9482000	9484000	To do that, so we really should sell my
9484000	9486000	Systems because they're the older ones
9486000	9488000	And keep Alan's
9488000	9490000	Oh well, maybe they'll do something like that again
9490000	9492000	Although yes, I'm with you, I really don't like
9492000	9494000	The evil G, but if they're willing to give me a lot of money
9494000	9496000	I can cross picket lines
9496000	9498000	We've got extra
9498000	9500000	Systems lying around
9500000	9502000	Why not?
9502000	9504000	And also, lastly, before I go
9504000	9506000	I wanted to tell you guys about a game I've been
9506000	9508000	Playing that I think kind of fell under
9508000	9510000	The radar a little bit because I don't think
9510000	9512000	A lot of people play this game anymore, but maybe
9512000	9514000	They do, I don't know, but the Ratchet and Clank
9514000	9516000	The new Ratchet and Clank game that just came out
9516000	9518000	It's like super fun
9518000	9520000	It's the first full length type
9520000	9522000	I guess Ratchet and Clank that they released
9522000	9524000	Because they released the All For One
9524000	9526000	Which is like the multiplayer, which kind of
9526000	9528000	Wasn't that good, and then they released
9528000	9530000	A full frontal assault
9530000	9532000	Which was the
9532000	9534000	It was like a tower defense Ratchet and Clank
9534000	9536000	But this one that they just released
9536000	9538000	Into the Nexus was fantastic
9538000	9540000	And I'm playing it right now
9540000	9542000	And I actually, with the game
9542000	9544000	Got a
9544000	9546000	A code for a downloadable
9546000	9548000	Game for the Quest for Booty game
9548000	9550000	Which was like the first downloadable
9550000	9552000	Game that they released or whatever
9552000	9554000	And I'm willing to give it to
9554000	9556000	Somebody in chat if they want it because
9556000	9558000	I already own it
9558000	9560000	But I have a free
9560000	9562000	Code here, so if anybody in chat likes
9562000	9564000	The Ratchet and Clank games and they
9564000	9566000	Don't own this game
9566000	9568000	It's really fun, it was a full length downloadable
9568000	9570000	Ratchet and Clank game, it's all like pirate themed
9570000	9572000	And stuff, so
9572000	9574000	So if you, anybody
9574000	9576000	The first person to
9576000	9578000	Direct message me in chat
9578000	9580000	Maybe, I want it, I wish you told me
9580000	9582000	I want it, no it's fine, give it to a listener
9582000	9584000	Do you want it Rob?
9584000	9586000	Of course, no no, give it to a listener, I have so many games to play
9586000	9588000	I'll never get around to it, give it to a listener
9588000	9590000	Who will actually play it
9590000	9592000	Alright cool, and welcome back guys
9592000	9594000	After a week of being off
9594000	9596000	Thank you, appreciate it
9596000	9598000	One more thing I just want to leave you with is that
9598000	9600000	You're not the first to talk about porn here on Orange
9600000	9602000	Radio, you need to go back in the archives
9602000	9604000	On the OL archive or whatever
9604000	9606000	And find the episode where we did review
9606000	9608000	And we watched live on air
9608000	9610000	Because our show was a lot different back in the early days
9610000	9612000	We actually watched live on air
9612000	9614000	Final Fuck X, which I still have
9614000	9616000	Somewhere, and Dance Dance
9616000	9618000	Fuck
9618000	9620000	Where some Japanese
9620000	9622000	Where some Japanese porn we
9622000	9624000	Watched, and for the record
9624000	9626000	All Final Fuck X's is
9626000	9628000	Really good cosplay with fucking
9628000	9630000	I remember I was looking for Dance Dance Revolution
9630000	9632000	Like stuff, like games on eBay
9632000	9634000	And I'm like, hey what's this?
9634000	9636000	I gotta buy that
9636000	9638000	Dance Dance Fuck has nothing to do with the games
9638000	9640000	So it just, which was hilarious
9640000	9642000	So, anyway
9642000	9644000	I'm just gonna have to channel my inner Shane on this one
9644000	9646000	And go, I don't care
9646000	9648000	Alright, well said
9648000	9650000	Alright, take care buddy
9650000	9652000	Alright Rob, everybody
9652000	9654000	Thanks for the call
9654000	9656000	I will talk to y'all later
9656000	9658000	Alright, that was a good call
9658000	9660000	1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype
9660000	9662000	Is OrangeLoungeRadio
9662000	9664000	I wanna do some quick Twitter topics while we wait for another call
9664000	9666000	Tigerclaw tweets us
9666000	9668000	And says, Mortal Kombat producer
9668000	9670000	Hector Sanchez leaves NetherRealm Studios
9670000	9672000	That's right, I did see this
9672000	9674000	Coming out today
9674000	9676000	That one of the guys over there at NetherRealm did leave the company
9676000	9678000	As of I think yesterday
9678000	9680000	Was his departure, no word yet where he
9680000	9682000	Went, but obviously he was a big
9682000	9684000	Part of not only the new Mortal Kombat
9684000	9686000	But Injustice, so
9686000	9688000	Very interesting to see him
9688000	9690000	Take another job somewhere
9690000	9692000	So let's go to the phones and go to another call
9692000	9694000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
9694000	9696000	Hi, this is Def
9696000	9698000	I see your picture has changed
9698000	9700000	It's a little, is that your new Wii U?
9700000	9702000	It's a Kirby
9702000	9704000	Yeah, it's the screen of my Wii U
9704000	9706000	It's actually a video
9706000	9708000	Of it
9708000	9710000	Oh, it's live video
9710000	9712000	Oh, no wonder I hear myself echoing a little bit
9712000	9714000	Oh yeah, I can see the pixels
9714000	9716000	Oh, there it goes
9716000	9718000	Alright, it is live video
9718000	9720000	Nice, love that
9720000	9722000	Even though I'm hearing myself echo
9722000	9724000	But that's okay, what's on your mind buddy?
9724000	9726000	Basically
9726000	9728000	Sorry
9728000	9730000	I was gonna talk about
9730000	9732000	Basically
9732000	9734000	Or ask you
9734000	9736000	Why do people still
9736000	9738000	Say that Nintendo is gonna
9738000	9740000	Be in ruins
9740000	9742000	I don't know
9742000	9744000	Lucky, why do people say
9744000	9746000	Nintendo is gonna be in ruins
9746000	9748000	It's doom and gloom, doom and gloom
9748000	9750000	It's just because the Wii U is not selling well
9750000	9752000	So they assume that because the Wii U is not selling well
9752000	9754000	That Nintendo doesn't have anything else
9754000	9756000	That they're selling that's not doing well
9756000	9758000	Except
9758000	9760000	They have this thing called the 3DS
9760000	9762000	That seems to sell like crazy
9762000	9764000	I don't know, I don't think they're in ruins
9764000	9766000	But as far as getting the platform
9766000	9768000	Of Wii U
9768000	9770000	Ehhhh, that's not
9770000	9772000	Doing so hot
9772000	9774000	That's about it
9774000	9776000	And actually right now they don't really have any
9776000	9778000	EA games
9778000	9780000	At all, and there's nothing on the slate for next year
9780000	9782000	So that's gonna hurt
9782000	9784000	Well to paraphrase something
9784000	9786000	That someone very aptly put on
9786000	9788000	The tumblers
9788000	9790000	The Virtual Boy
9790000	9792000	Didn't tank it
9792000	9794000	The Micro didn't tank it
9794000	9796000	The 64DD didn't tank it
9796000	9798000	So
9798000	9800000	They're just not going to
9800000	9802000	Recapture what
9802000	9804000	Happened with the Wii
9804000	9806000	I think the Wii set the bar so high
9806000	9808000	It was such a successful console
9808000	9810000	That expectations are very high
9810000	9812000	Is the Wii U going to win
9812000	9814000	This generation?
9814000	9816000	Not likely, but never say never
9816000	9818000	I mean, I think we also have to remember
9818000	9820000	In the last generation
9820000	9822000	PlayStation 3 didn't come out the gate too hot
9822000	9824000	And PlayStation 3 took a while
9824000	9826000	To turn around
9826000	9828000	PlayStation 3 took a good two years
9828000	9830000	And when did Little Big Planet
9830000	9832000	Come out? Because that's when things really started
9832000	9834000	Turning around for PlayStation 3
9834000	9836000	That was almost two years into it, right?
9836000	9838000	I think it was 2007, so it was a year after it came out
9838000	9840000	I think it's still just
9840000	9842000	A little too soon to write off
9842000	9844000	Nintendo completely
9844000	9846000	Are they having a bad day?
9846000	9848000	Absolutely. Are they done?
9848000	9850000	I don't think so. Are they going to be number one?
9850000	9852000	Probably not
9852000	9854000	I think it's going to be a little more even
9854000	9856000	Steven across all three of them this time
9856000	9858000	Because let's be real, last generation
9858000	9860000	Nintendo blew the other two out of the water
9860000	9862000	Whether you like it or not
9862000	9864000	This time I don't think it's going to be
9864000	9866000	I think Nintendo may actually be the one that lags behind a little bit
9866000	9868000	But we'll see
9868000	9870000	Xbox One's out next week
9870000	9872000	We've got to see where things are at six months out
9872000	9874000	We'll see
9874000	9876000	But it's not over for Nintendo
9876000	9878000	3DS will always keep them afloat
9878000	9880000	And whatever else they've got up their sleeve
9880000	9882000	It's going to be a Wii U next year
9882000	9884000	It's going to sell systems
9884000	9886000	Along with Super Smash Brothers
9886000	9888000	Just wait
9888000	9890000	But what about you Actif?
9890000	9892000	You just bought a Wii U
9892000	9894000	So what finally made you decide to take the plunge?
9896000	9898000	Basically
9898000	9900000	First of all, Super Mario 3D World
9900000	9902000	It's
9902000	9904000	Seeing the videos
9904000	9906000	Over and over again
9906000	9908000	It looks like it's going to be a pretty fun game to play
9908000	9910000	And I really
9910000	9912000	Wanted to play it
9912000	9914000	As soon as it comes out
9914000	9916000	So
9916000	9918000	I pretty much wanted that
9918000	9920000	And also
9920000	9922000	I topped this with Bobby
9922000	9924000	Rayman Legends
9924000	9926000	Even though it's a multi-platform
9926000	9928000	Game
9928000	9930000	I still want it on the Wii U
9930000	9932000	And it's even on sale right now
9932000	9934000	On Steam for 20 bucks
9934000	9936000	I want to purchase that
9936000	9938000	But now that I have the Wii U
9938000	9940000	I really
9940000	9942000	Want to get it for this console
9942000	9944000	So yeah
9944000	9946000	Basically those are my two main reasons right now
9946000	9948000	To get one
9948000	9950000	And even then
9950000	9952000	Something that you said on the beginning of the show
9952000	9954000	It's like pretty much
9954000	9956000	Right now Wii U
9956000	9958000	Has the games
9958000	9960000	Has at least
9960000	9962000	More games to play
9962000	9964000	Right now
9964000	9966000	Since it has
9966000	9968000	The
9968000	9970000	Year
9970000	9972000	Since it launched
9972000	9974000	So yeah
9974000	9976000	It already has
9976000	9978000	A big library so it
9978000	9980000	Doesn't have that many games
9980000	9982000	Maybe to play but
9982000	9984000	At least you have more of a selection
9984000	9986000	Right now than the
9986000	9988000	PS4 or even the
9988000	9990000	Xbox One
9990000	9992000	Even though there's not a lot of games on Wii U
9992000	9994000	There will be some really great
9994000	9996000	A-list titles on it
9996000	9998000	That help keep the system afloat
9998000	10000000	Which I'm not sure PS4 or Xbox One
10000000	10002000	Has as much of right now anyway
10002000	10004000	Alright
10004000	10006000	Well Akdef, thanks so much for the call
10006000	10008000	And enjoy your new Wii U, have fun
10008000	10010000	Thanks
10010000	10012000	Alright you're welcome, take care buddy, have a good night
10012000	10014000	See ya
10014000	10016000	1877 Game OLR
10016000	10018000	Or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio
10018000	10020000	If you want to give us a call
10020000	10022000	Guess what, nobody sent
10022000	10024000	CodeMan a direct message for that code
10024000	10026000	So he ended up giving it to me anyway
10026000	10028000	Haha, suckers
10028000	10030000	Alright
10030000	10032000	Let's go to the phones one more time hopefully
10032000	10034000	1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype
10034000	10036000	OrangeLoungeRadio
10036000	10038000	While we wait for a call to come in
10038000	10040000	There's a call coming in right now so let's go to it
10040000	10042000	Hi on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
10042000	10044000	It's Legend, Zaku here
10044000	10046000	Hey Zaku buddy, how you doing?
10046000	10048000	Long time no see
10048000	10050000	What do you do?
10050000	10052000	Nothing much, just shuffling between
10052000	10054000	Battlefield 4 and GTA 5
10054000	10056000	I love that you're calling in when you're in your
10056000	10058000	camo shirt, I couldn't see you for a minute
10058000	10060000	That's my PJ's
10060000	10062000	What, what's that? Those are my PJ's
10062000	10064000	I was going to say it kind of looked like a PJ top
10064000	10066000	You call in when you're in your camo jammies
10066000	10068000	To talk about Battlefield, so please by all means
10068000	10070000	How is Battlefield?
10070000	10072000	Well I haven't, to be honest I haven't
10072000	10074000	gotten into the multiplayer yet
10074000	10076000	Because I'm still, you know, it's always
10076000	10078000	A thing of mine to always do single player first
10078000	10080000	Then just jump into multiplayer
10080000	10082000	Same thing I did for Battlefield 3
10082000	10084000	But so far
10084000	10086000	I mean, if you want single player
10086000	10088000	It is kind of like very
10088000	10090000	Cinematic
10090000	10092000	But that's all I can say about it other than
10092000	10094000	It looks like it's gonna
10094000	10096000	It looks pretty short than the
10096000	10098000	One for Battlefield 3
10098000	10100000	But I'm hearing a lot of great things about
10100000	10102000	Online, except of course when you
10102000	10104000	Have people
10104000	10106000	Crashing the servers maliciously
10106000	10108000	Like what happened this weekend
10108000	10110000	Yeah I heard about that, what's up with that?
10110000	10112000	Did the DDoS
10112000	10114000	Attacks go against
10114000	10116000	Battlefield 4 today or something?
10116000	10118000	Apparently from what I'm hearing
10118000	10120000	When I'm glancing through Kotaku
10120000	10122000	Right now
10122000	10124000	Yeah they were getting
10124000	10126000	They were basically getting hammered
10126000	10128000	By denial of service, yeah they were getting
10128000	10130000	DDoS'd
10130000	10132000	I guess
10132000	10134000	Now that the PS4 is out
10134000	10136000	This kind of opens the floodgates
10136000	10138000	Since most of the
10138000	10140000	PS4 games will have dedicated servers
10140000	10142000	Whether or not that will actually
10142000	10144000	Translate over to consoles
10144000	10146000	Assuming one can just
10146000	10148000	Slightly sniff
10148000	10150000	Outgoing packets
10150000	10152000	Outgoing network packets
10152000	10154000	To see if they can
10154000	10156000	Find an IP to exploit
10156000	10158000	I mean that's one way to do it
10158000	10160000	You just snip the traffic
10160000	10162000	Between the private dedicated
10162000	10164000	Servers and the console and you might
10164000	10166000	Be able to get some info
10166000	10168000	Assuming it's not encrypted
10168000	10170000	But if it is
10170000	10172000	Then they're still a bit lucky
10172000	10174000	I'm assuming you
10174000	10176000	Did not jump on the PlayStation 4 bandwagon
10176000	10178000	Did you, you've been doing that?
10178000	10180000	Not yet, I still have a PS3 to go over
10180000	10182000	As I said I still have GTA 5
10182000	10184000	That I played yesterday, last night
10184000	10186000	And I've been juggling
10186000	10188000	Battlefield 4 so those are the two things
10188000	10190000	Those two gaming things are going on right now
10190000	10192000	So you're sitting out
10192000	10194000	This new
10194000	10196000	Consoles for a little bit too
10196000	10198000	You're not planning on Xbox One either?
10198000	10200000	Not yet, as I said I'd rather give it
10200000	10202000	At least a couple of years
10202000	10204000	Or until the prices start dropping
10204000	10206000	I mean when I
10206000	10208000	Got my Xbox two years after it came out
10208000	10210000	That was the first
10210000	10212000	The first 360
10212000	10214000	And then after that
10214000	10216000	That one crapped out and then I bought another
10216000	10218000	But yeah, it was
10218000	10220000	I waited at least two years before buying
10220000	10222000	That current generation of
10222000	10224000	Console
10224000	10226000	And PS3 I got last year so
10226000	10228000	Yeah
10228000	10230000	Still juggling, but as I
10230000	10232000	You know, I'd rather, it's not
10232000	10234000	It's not really good to be an early adopter
10234000	10236000	In this stage
10236000	10238000	Especially for a new generation console
10238000	10240000	Because you're pretty much dealt with
10240000	10242000	What you have already and not
10242000	10244000	What improvements Sony
10244000	10246000	Or Microsoft will make on their hardware
10246000	10248000	Yeah, but
10248000	10250000	Other than having to deal with that aftermath initially
10250000	10252000	I'd rather just see how they find
10252000	10254000	How they flesh it out
10254000	10256000	But you can be the cool kid on the block with your cool new toy
10256000	10258000	You're the coolest kid in school
10258000	10260000	Sure
10260000	10262000	That is true, but
10262000	10264000	I know it's $400
10264000	10266000	That I could put to good use
10266000	10268000	You know, like
10268000	10270000	Buying myself a new video card
10270000	10272000	Or basically getting
10272000	10274000	Two terabyte hard drives
10274000	10276000	I could set up on RAID so I could put all my
10276000	10278000	Steam games and get a lot
10278000	10280000	More of them so I don't max out my current drive
10280000	10282000	Stuff like that, like putting stuff
10282000	10284000	On my PC
10284000	10286000	As opposed to the PS3 which I still
10286000	10288000	Invest, but it's not as
10288000	10290000	It's not as urgent as
10290000	10292000	Something that's almost like reaching
10292000	10294000	Two years old
10294000	10296000	And I still need to get a new video card for it
10296000	10298000	But other than that
10298000	10300000	I mean, it's not like my
10300000	10302000	My head is Seth Child called the 360
10302000	10304000	Which I barely put anything
10304000	10306000	Except for an Xbox Live membership earlier this year
10306000	10308000	And that's it
10308000	10310000	Alright
10310000	10312000	Well, Zaku, we're gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show
10312000	10314000	But have fun with your Battlefield
10314000	10316000	And get in that multiplayer and let us know how it is
10316000	10318000	You know, when the servers work
10318000	10320000	Maybe you guys do need to
10320000	10322000	Jump on it
10322000	10324000	I'm certain there are Battlefield PC players
10324000	10326000	The best argument
10326000	10328000	I heard for playing Battlefield 4
10328000	10330000	And Jamie, you'll appreciate this
10330000	10332000	The best argument I heard for Battlefield 4 and playing it
10332000	10334000	Is it's using the same engine the new Mass Effect
10334000	10336000	Game's gonna be using
10336000	10338000	Of course, it's Frostbite
10338000	10340000	And you can actually do
10340000	10342000	Countering knife attacks
10342000	10344000	I don't hate shooters
10344000	10346000	I'm so bad at them, Zaku
10346000	10348000	I am so, so bad
10348000	10350000	Do you want to play with a scrub?
10350000	10352000	Do you want to?
10352000	10354000	I will lower your team's
10354000	10356000	Collective performance
10356000	10358000	Other than that, I barely see VOG network on GTA Online
10358000	10360000	What's up with that?
10360000	10362000	I don't see many on the PS3
10362000	10364000	I'm on all the time
10364000	10366000	Except I'm on two different Sims
10366000	10368000	Good day, though
10368000	10370000	Can't you hit me up on a social club?
10370000	10372000	Don't they have messaging systems?
10372000	10374000	I have it through my phone now
10374000	10376000	Because I'm not
10376000	10378000	Doing my best to dodge, chop
10378000	10380000	I put messages on there
10380000	10382000	Are you friended on
10382000	10384000	PlayStation Network with me?
10385000	10387000	It's there
10387000	10389000	My profile should have my PSN ID
10389000	10391000	I'll even post it up right now
10391000	10393000	After this call
10393000	10395000	But yeah
10395000	10397000	Hopefully
10397000	10399000	OLR can get a VOG network
10399000	10401000	Group on Origin for Battlefield
10401000	10403000	3 and or 4
10403000	10405000	Yeah
10405000	10407000	That requires me to install Origin
10407000	10409000	It's not that bad
10409000	10411000	Oh my god
10411000	10413000	I basically bit the bullet and did that
10414000	10416000	Alright, Zaku
10416000	10418000	I gotta wrap up
10418000	10420000	We're running long
10420000	10422000	Have a good one, buddy
10422000	10424000	Thanks for the call
10424000	10426000	I love it when we get the webcam calls
10426000	10428000	It's always good to be able to see our people
10428000	10430000	I should probably put a webcam on the computer
10430000	10432000	Just for Skype
10432000	10434000	So that way when they call in
10434000	10436000	I can remember the one I've been using
10436000	10438000	For my drawing
10438000	10440000	It's more incentive for people to call
10440000	10442000	Microsoft would like to let you know
10442000	10444000	That you can get your free Skype camera
10444000	10446000	With the purchase of an Xbox One
10446000	10448000	In the form of a Kinect
10448000	10450000	I am so sorry, the phones are still lighting up
10450000	10452000	I've gotta wrap up because we're running long
10452000	10454000	We're 15 minutes past midnight on the East Coast
10454000	10456000	I still have some Twitter topics
10456000	10458000	So one of these is a really good question I want to get to
10458000	10460000	So please, please tweet, email
10460000	10462000	And we'll get to you guys in a later week, hopefully
10462000	10464000	I want to get this tweet from
10464000	10466000	ActDeaf who sent us a tweet
10466000	10468000	This is something I totally missed from the Nintendo Direct
10468000	10470000	I'm so sorry
10470000	10472000	I get Kirby, how very dare I
10472000	10474000	I'm mad at myself, y'all
10474000	10476000	Kirby Triple Deluxe
10476000	10478000	Will be coming out in Japan on
10478000	10480000	January 11th
10480000	10482000	And there's a teaser site for that
10482000	10484000	Kirby Triple Deluxe
10484000	10486000	Get it? Kirby 3D
10486000	10488000	Get it?
10488000	10490000	Oh my gosh
10490000	10492000	Alright
10492000	10494000	And one other question here
10494000	10496000	That I really like this
10496000	10498000	This is from AJ Twist
10498000	10500000	So, in O.L.R.'s opinion
10500000	10502000	Who won
10502000	10504000	The last gen
10504000	10506000	Console Wars?
10506000	10508000	Dreamcast
10508000	10510000	The dramas are still not over
10510000	10512000	So, I mean, it's still going
10512000	10514000	It's still going?
10514000	10516000	Alright
10516000	10518000	Define when, do you mean by sales
10518000	10520000	Do you mean by units
10520000	10522000	Specifically sold, do you mean
10522000	10524000	By what country, do you mean by
10524000	10526000	Gallup poll, I don't know
10526000	10528000	I think the question is vague on purpose
10528000	10530000	It's his opinion, in your opinion
10530000	10532000	Who won
10532000	10534000	My 3DS
10534000	10536000	The 3DS won the last console
10536000	10538000	I think that's a perfectly valid answer
10538000	10540000	See, that's a console, not a handheld
10540000	10542000	Ah, alright
10542000	10544000	You know what I think won?
10544000	10546000	My computer, the end
10546000	10548000	PC's
10548000	10550000	PC's won
10550000	10552000	You know what, there's a lot of people
10552000	10554000	There would be a lot of people in that camp
10554000	10556000	It would be a home run with the Ouya
10556000	10558000	I mean, the Ouya won the last gen console wars
10558000	10560000	There's just no doubt about it
10560000	10562000	No
10562000	10564000	Loki, who won?
10564000	10566000	Who won?
10566000	10568000	Probably Xbox, just because they had
10568000	10570000	A lot of units out there
10570000	10572000	They still have the strongest support, I think
10572000	10574000	From all third parties
10574000	10576000	I mean, it's still going strong
10576000	10578000	The Wii's gone
10578000	10580000	I mean, the support for Wii U
10580000	10582000	Is gone, and now it's Wii U
10582000	10584000	So, they're in their own
10584000	10586000	Gen, I guess
10586000	10588000	It's the way they want to classify themselves because they can't compete
10588000	10590000	With the Wii U now
10590000	10592000	So, I think Xbox, but
10592000	10594000	I mean, PlayStation 3 did turn it around
10594000	10596000	And now they're selling
10596000	10598000	Quite heavily, so that's
10598000	10600000	Pretty neck and neck, I mean, it's not like
10600000	10602000	One clear winner
10602000	10604000	I think, it depends on your criteria
10604000	10606000	I think, for me
10606000	10608000	If you're going by sales, specifically
10608000	10610000	Nintendo won, clearly
10610000	10612000	Like it or not, love or hate what they brought to the table
10612000	10614000	Just speaking by the numbers
10614000	10616000	And no, that's not me being a fanboy
10616000	10618000	I mean, Wii Sports is the
10618000	10620000	Biggest video game of all time, period
10620000	10622000	You can't dispute that
10622000	10624000	But, the answer
10624000	10626000	That was in my head
10626000	10628000	Was actually something Bobby said in chat here
10628000	10630000	Who said, who won? The gamers
10630000	10632000	Absolutely believe it, the gamers won
10632000	10634000	The last generation
10634000	10636000	There's a lot of choice available out there now
10636000	10638000	And more ways to
10638000	10640000	Connect with each other, and our voices
10640000	10642000	Are really having an impact
10642000	10644000	For better or for worse
10646000	10648000	And so, yeah, I think the gamers won
10648000	10650000	Absolutely, if I had to pick a
10650000	10652000	Company though, Netflix
10652000	10654000	Won, big time
10654000	10656000	Netflix won the last generation
10656000	10658000	Huge, because
10658000	10660000	That's what a lot of these gaming boxes are
10660000	10662000	They're Netflix devices and so forth
10662000	10664000	Gene in chat says
10664000	10666000	Apple won, you know, that's
10666000	10668000	Not a stretch
10668000	10670000	It just depends on what you look at
10670000	10672000	Alright, great tweet, great question
10672000	10674000	Maybe we'll get some emails on that
10674000	10676000	Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com
10676000	10678000	Again, sorry to the call
10678000	10680000	So I didn't get through, but we do want to wrap up
10680000	10682000	We are after
10682000	10684000	9.15 on the west coast
10684000	10686000	Which means it's 15 past midnight on the east coast
10686000	10688000	So it is about time that we wrap up
10688000	10690000	But before we say
10690000	10692000	Goodnight for good, we gotta go around and get everybody's
10692000	10694000	Final thought
10694000	10696000	And I do want to also say one more time
10696000	10698000	Thank you very much for downloading us

10706000	10708000	I know we've had some very strong opinions
10708000	10710000	And devil's advocate positions

10712000	10714000	So I really appreciate you guys that stick with the whole thing
10714000	10716000	To listen to it

10736000	10738000	If you hated our show
10738000	10740000	Yet you made it all this way
10740000	10742000	There's probably some other indie shows out there
10742000	10744000	That are for you
10744000	10746000	So check them out
10746000	10748000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought
10748000	10750000	Loki, we'll start with you, your final thought tonight
10750000	10752000	I'm done with Cookie Clicker
10752000	10754000	I'm done
10754000	10756000	My 24 hour foray into Cookie Clicker
10756000	10758000	Is now complete
10758000	10760000	You divorced it, so it's done
10760000	10762000	You're over it
10762000	10764000	Party's over, get out
10764000	10766000	My final thought tonight is
10766000	10768000	That
10768000	10770000	Game capture card I bought
10770000	10772000	Really ended up being a waste of money
10772000	10774000	Because I don't have a TV next to my PC
10774000	10776000	Which means I need to buy a TV
10776000	10778000	No, I need to buy a Playstation 4
10778000	10780000	Which means you need to lend it to me
10780000	10782000	No, I need to buy a 3DS XL
10782000	10784000	I need to buy all the things
10784000	10786000	But I'm broke
10786000	10788000	You need a roof over your head
10788000	10790000	Food in your stomach and water and shelter
10790000	10792000	I already said shelter
10792000	10794000	And fucking
10794000	10796000	And sex
10796000	10798000	And a kitty
10798000	10800000	Dark Soccer
10800000	10802000	Your final thought tonight
10802000	10804000	I got up to go grab my shoes
10804000	10806000	Because my feet were cold
10806000	10808000	And um
10808000	10810000	My legs hurt from doing squats
10810000	10812000	I was walking like the hunched
10812000	10814000	Back old woman
10814000	10816000	And also tonight's cookie is fun
10816000	10818000	Alright, that's it you guys
10818000	10820000	Thank you very much for listening to our show
10820000	10822000	And I was also going to say all you need to do is
10822000	10824000	Get a really long HDMI cable
10824000	10826000	And you're problem solved
10826000	10828000	Maybe I will do that, that's a good idea
10828000	10830000	Might as well instead of
10830000	10832000	I didn't even think to get
10832000	10834000	A 50 foot HD cable
10834000	10836000	Just what we need in this apartment
10836000	10838000	I don't know about 50 feet
10838000	10840000	I don't remember how long it is
10840000	10842000	You can make an HDMI cable before you have to have
10842000	10844000	Some sort of signal booster
10844000	10846000	You should be able to get at least 20 feet
10846000	10848000	I think without having to do that
10848000	10850000	And that should be enough
10850000	10852000	Yay, just what we need, another big cable in the house
10852000	10854000	Alan will be so happy
10854000	10856000	Alright, he's cheering you live here
10856000	10858000	Alright, that really is going to do it
10858000	10860000	Thank you guys again for listening
10860000	10862000	Well again, next week's not Thanksgiving right?
10862000	10864000	No, that's two weeks
10864000	10866000	But I'll have to bring over sweet potato latkes
10866000	10868000	That are left over
10868000	10870000	Oh my god
10870000	10872000	It is the latke feast, the OLR latke feast
10872000	10874000	We ate like a whole bag of those fucking latkes
10874000	10876000	Last year, they're so good
10876000	10878000	Well then maybe I'll bring jelly donuts
10878000	10880000	Alright, that's it, we're done, we're out
