14517	26054	Nintendo Kills Swapnode via SpotPass because children and penises Ubisoft turns tail and drops its passport system for Assassin's Creed and the Pocket Station rumors get stronger with an impending announcement this week All these plosives and more begin...
31584	36427	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36507	41010	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with this episode number 526 for November the 3rd, 2013.
41050	43631	Yep, we're in that start of November, which is that month when...
49415	50136	DarkSakura.com
68331	73397	Well, except for the day's just been so weird because of ye olde time change.
74078	78303	Yeah, and to be honest, and just keeping it real, y'all, I'm a little hungover today.
78523	80666	So I'm a little, I'm a little like dragging.
80686	82388	You look amazing for a hungover.
82408	85011	Well, thank you.
85071	86333	Did you enjoy the vodka presents?
86853	88874	I haven't partaken in the vodka presence.
89214	96276	I actually was planning to drink during tonight's show, which I'm sure the listeners would have loved, but now that I'm... I kind of drank a lot last night.
96416	99437	You should try a shot of it if you feel up to it later.
99477	99837	We'll see.
99897	108139	If listeners, if y'all behave, and especially knowing that I don't have to get Alan after work now, he's on his way home right now, so I don't have to drive tonight at all, so I can be responsible.
109320	117686	If listeners behave, I'll take a shot maybe at the beginning of part B. And the wine was already starting to get me to slur my words at the end of last week's show.
117927	122030	I'm going to have to get you a bottle of the Honey Run because that stuff was... I love that stuff.
122731	123551	And you were funny.
123871	126734	But I have to say, I just forgot what I was going to say.
126834	129236	Oh yeah, I'm drunk on coffee and high on life.
129976	130416	Woohoo!
130896	131177	Alright.
132037	134678	Also say hello to somebody else who I'm sure is high on life.
134718	136018	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
136479	138659	And actually November is not a very busy month for games.
138999	141000	Although there are a couple big games coming out.
141100	141961	You've got to be kidding.
142001	142861	I was just thinking today.
142881	143741	I was like, oh my god.
144121	146942	November 22nd is the day the Xbox One comes out, right?
147062	147263	Yeah.
147403	147843	Well, okay.
147943	152384	On November 22nd, I've already bought at Best Buy and have to go pick up my Zelda 3DS.
153945	154826	Mario 3D World Land View Week
171035	178664	Yeah, but so are you going to count every single re-release of each of these games on different platforms as a separate title?
178784	179805	I suppose not.
180025	185552	It's just the same titles are just, oh, hey, one comes out one week, one comes out the other week, and whatever.
185752	185972	I mean...
186894	189036	So, really, you only have two major releases.
190458	199831	Next-gen console and first-party games aside, you pretty much just have Call of Duty, Ending for Speed, and then, I guess, the Super Mario 3D World.
200132	201353	And that's about it.
201373	201814	Well, to be honest...
201914	202734	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
218563	233264	90% of the time solid as heck and all the good or all the kind of early previews and reviews on that thing are really positive so I don't think I have any reason not to be super excited about that game I'm more excited about that than anything I can think of on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One to be quite honest
233484	236287	But the resolution that it played on the Xbox One was just terrible.
236687	248919	Zero, zero P. I mean, same with the PlayStation 4, zero P. Is that why the fan wank fantasy of Nintendo making Xbox One games can't come true because Xbox One wouldn't run it?
248939	250961	I get no picture and sound at all.
251081	256386	All it gets is a stupid error that comes on the screen and says this disc is not compatible or it's dirty or something.
256406	257648	I just don't get it, but...
258308	262110	To be real, I don't really need the Zelda 3DS XL.
262250	263091	I really don't need it.
263111	263651	You don't need it.
263771	265732	And my money could be better spent on other things.
265752	270395	Spray paint the damn... But... If you buy it, you can sell me your old one for Dan.
271368	272329	Oh, Dan wants a 3DS?
272869	273850	Because he wants to play Zelda.
274150	276351	Why doesn't he buy a Zelda 3DS?
276391	277872	Because I have no job.
278032	278873	What about a 2DS?
279053	282575	I have a buyer earmarked right now, but if that falls through, certainly.
282756	283816	That'd be a good thing.
284957	288039	Dan, if you're listening to the show, which you're not, I'm not getting it for you at all.
288279	288479	Ever.
288800	289500	No, I'm not.
289620	290080	You don't need it.
291201	313985	so uh yeah so it's uh anyway i just want that zelda 3ds because it looks so dang cool and i was so happy that it didn't end up being a gamestop exclusive and i can buy it at a bunch of other retailers so yeah i pre-ordered it at best buy because i just i don't know if it's going to be limited quantity or what and i just want to make sure i can yeah they're always limited launch like uh those pokemon 3ds xls they're gone they were gone after their first initial launch
314105	342402	I still saw some on the shelf at Fry's yeah they probably bought a ton and didn't sell them but it's still they only do them one batch and that's it interesting alright well let's see I do want to also introduce our chat room live.vognetwork.com because of course we are the show where every gamer has a voice you guys join us in the chat room every week and we like to read some of the comments from the chat room let's see Actdeft saying I'm considering selling my Pikachu 3DS XL to get a Wii U
343042	344083	It would certainly be a start.
345183	347665	Brad from PodCulture says, Sky, I'm such a sucker.
348025	352347	I ordered Injustice for the PlayStation 4, already imported it for PlayStation 3.
352947	357229	But yeah, I mean, I know the reviews on that game were mixed, but you, Brad, really liked it.
357490	360511	And, you know, if you like a game, then you like a game.
360911	364333	And I don't think there's anything wrong with getting it on multiple consoles if you truly enjoy a game.
364353	365534	Even though it was freaking weird.
365694	367515	Well, but that's, you know, opinions.
367555	368535	I know, I know.
368575	371157	And I have to give him a hard time over being a DC fanboy anyway.
371177	371297	Okay.
371817	372137	and DarkSakura.
389245	393348	Xtifer, our buddy from Horde House, is in chat tonight and says, That's one thing about Nintendo.
393649	397712	You can bet that all their games will always run and look amazing on their systems.
398012	401875	This is why Mario 3D World looks so much better than most other things.
402675	410201	I don't know if they knock it out of the park 100% of the time with their games, because sometimes there's some misfires, like what Steel Diver wasn't really the hottest 3DS game.
410782	414625	But not to totally dismiss your point, because...
415405	419087	It's one of the biggest perks of Nintendo and one of the biggest drawbacks.
420268	421989	Nobody does Nintendo better than Nintendo.
422009	425571	The bar is not really set very high for Nintendo either.
426672	427592	No, I'm serious.
427632	431295	The type of game, though, it doesn't have to be that it's cartoony.
431335	432976	It doesn't have to be that realistic.
433516	438359	Also, it's a lot easier for them because they're developing on one platform as opposed to multi-platform.
439379	443122	That kind of goes with any first-party game that you're only going to have on one platform.
443162	443782	It might look better.
443942	455227	Well, I was going to say, SSJ100Matt was saying how many multiple copies of DDR do we have, except that they actually were kind of different from system to system and release to release, so it doesn't matter.
455347	461350	I was just about to read that same comment and go, well, it's very similar to the Madden games every year.
461450	463751	I mean, DDR was a type of Madden game.
464971	466232	You know, it was different.
466272	469814	Yeah, that actually burned calories instead of making you put them on eating chips.
469914	472455	But still, but still, it was music instead of players.
472595	474336	That's all you had to change, though, was the music.
474376	475557	The music changed the whole game.
475637	487263	The game itself, it's like, that's like saying, well, hey, you know, Monopoly and, you know, another game that uses dice are exactly... Monopoly and Dungeons & Dragons are exactly the same because they use dice.
487363	487963	It's just, you know...
488323	493108	Well, the whole point is that it's the content that makes the game, not the style.
493248	495270	Well, part of it is the content and the style.
495771	503719	Well, I mean, to use the D&D analogy, you use the same method every time you play, but your content's different every time you play.
503799	508104	It's the same with DDR and same, I hope, with the sports ball stuff.
508644	512246	All right, well, we're having a fun conversation here at the top of the show.
512326	516928	But I wanted to get into the official kickoff topic that I had earmarked for tonight before we get into our gaming weeks.
517448	524191	And the kickoff topic I wanted to talk about tonight is, as I've mentioned in prior weeks on the show, we are not going to be here next week.
524351	526252	And it's kind of sort of because of BlizzCon.
526412	529993	I'm going to be out of town, even though I'm technically not going to BlizzCon.
530053	533355	Long story, but I'm going to DizCon and some of the parties.
533755	534295	So there you go.
534635	536096	So we're not going to be here next week.
536136	537317	So no show November 10th.
537517	537757	Sorry.
538537	540879	But we will be back on November 17th.
541240	547786	And if you think about it, when we're back with our first live show on November 17th, we will now live in a world that has a PlayStation 4 in it.
548086	550908	The next system for, you know, the next generation.
551069	554992	Although I know some people may say Wii U is in there, but you know, well...
556353	583174	we all know Nintendo marches to the beat of their own drum right so you know okay yeah we use there but PlayStation 4 is like you know in Xbox One or like really kind of like that next level of power and graphics and so forth so this is really kind of the last episode of OLR to kind of put a cap on this generation now it's not that this generation is done because obviously there's still plenty of 360 and PlayStation 3 games to come
583254	585775	You don't kill your first child when you have your next child.
586735	593037	But, and there's even some speculation that this generation could continue if these new consoles tank, which is a possibility.
593557	599078	If you were going to use that analogy, I would just be like this great, great, great, great, great grandmother.
599759	604000	But for most practical purposes, this generation is probably peaked.
604900	609521	And we're in a unique situation here at OLR that when these consoles launched in, what, 2005, 2006, we were around.
612222	613683	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
631155	632735	DarkSakura, you already take a mic to mouth.
632795	633536	What are your thoughts?
653240	654601	Well, I'm going to go with the Mass Effect series.
655181	657762	I mean, all three of them together because they're a series.
657862	658042	Right.
658462	659682	No surprise hearing this from you.
659742	661203	Yeah, but I'm going to say this.
661663	667085	Specifically, it got me back into gaming this generation because I had my surgery.
667925	670666	I played a bunch of games and it was, I'm okay.
670867	671687	Oh, this is fun.
672207	672987	Oh, this is neat.
673067	674228	I'm going to go back and play Puyo Puyo.
674268	678349	I always go back and play my old games because I'm a classic gamer.
678689	678890	But...
680330	687413	I have to say that since picking up the series and getting into the story again, I've started checking out more and more new things as they've come out.
687473	689734	I've started looking at other companies that do similar things.
691435	697477	Well, as opposed to the sucky things that Bioware has done, but companies that have similar types of titles.
697577	699298	I've been playing Dragon Age.
699338	708362	I've been really expanding, and I think that it's just the first series that's been out that had so engaging a story that I really...
710563	711803	And I've used this quote before.
711943	715385	A friend of mine in Becky's has said it's the best movie I've ever played.
716585	719487	And you know how you go back and watch your favorite... How often have we seen Showgirls?
720667	725869	But you go back and you watch your favorite show over and over even if part of it has sucked.
726690	730151	Even if you didn't like part of this story or thought this could have been better.
730831	734613	You still go back and watch it if it's something that you love.
734673	736714	Especially if it's the universe that you like.
737394	753445	I had actually gotten pretty kind of bored with it for a little while and then I just went back and started over and I was like well you know what this is kind of fun again and started finding new things to enjoy and you know so I'm actually kind of getting back into it it's really funny but it was
754526	757487	You know, especially, you know, now I play it on PC, mind you.
758508	762069	But it still goes in with the same generation.
762790	766571	And, you know, my second choice is actually up there too.
766591	768632	I don't know if I can mention my second choice.
768652	769073	Sure, of course.
769613	770253	The Portal series.
771314	780758	Portal and Portal 2 because those added in all kinds of different mechanics and made you use your brain as well as having just a delicious snarky humor in it that was...
781498	782780	Fantastic.
783461	789128	But the big two things about both of those is that you also have this community built up around it.
789228	792312	I hate to use the word fandom, but it really is just that.
793195	797217	It's funny that you bring up Portal because I'm looking at our chat room and of course we've got people naming their games.
797377	799799	Actdeft says the game that defined this generation, Portal.
800359	810704	And definitely probably in my top five, I would have put the Orange Box as one of the defining games of this generation because it was such that immense value, but it also brought us Portal.
810844	811365	It brought us...
812645	818006	I think in many ways the Orange Box kind of set up Steam in a lot of ways.
818046	825248	And I realize Steam was around before, but I think a lot of people really got onto Steam in large part because of those Orange Box games.
825288	830490	And Steam has been, you know, I don't want to leave the PC and how they've been pacing alongside consoles out of this necessarily.
830810	833450	So I think the Orange Box really heavily contributed.
833470	834691	That would definitely be my top five.
834711	836151	It's not my number one, but yeah.
836411	840272	Well, here's the point I was going back to with what I call them defining games.
841253	850936	First of all, you do have, like you were just mentioning that side-by-side with PC, you're actually, with so much crossover between consoles and PC, you're expanding the fan base.
851456	857958	You are building an actual bigger community instead of this us-versus-them mentality that's existed forever.
858258	860399	You've actually got both people playing these games.
861379	865481	How often have I modded Becky's save files for Mass Effect 2 and 3?
866101	880475	plenty of times and you know you've got this level of crossover but it's when you've got people who are so invested in the story that they've expanded around it that I think that you've made you've really gotten a success story out of it
881662	882942	I was really considering.
883123	884744	I wasn't going to say the Mass Effect.
885404	888567	I was really considering saying Mass Effect 3 is my game of the generation.
889707	892189	I knew you would say it, though, so I'm going to pick something else.
892389	892690	Okay.
892870	895972	And I know a lot of people would say, why not 2?
896873	898454	How could you pick 3 over 2?
899315	904438	And this is where I go, well, it's not necessarily about the best, but it's about what defined this generation.
905039	909102	And I think in a lot of ways, you know, Mass Effect 3 introduced the multiplayer element of it.
909182	909422	Mm-hmm.
909582	910764	And I want to play again soon.
925055	928016	was definitely one of the more noteworthy things to happen.
928596	929116	I agree.
929196	937799	The way that the fans, in many ways, revolted against what they'd put out for the game was something you wouldn't have seen in previous generations.
938619	945542	I think we all said around the time, Final Fantasy VII, thank God the internet wasn't out when people saw Final Fantasy VII's ending for the first time.
945602	946902	You probably would have seen something similar.
946922	948222	I liked the ending for that game.
950063	953726	I think that in many ways, for better or for worse, defined the generation.
953946	954126	Yeah.
954406	957629	So I'll save my pick for just a minute here.
957749	961632	Loki, what do you think was the game that defined the generation for better or for worse?
962254	967878	Um, well, here's kind of a weird take on it, but I'm going to say Saints Row the Third.
968678	971680	And, unfortunately... It's not just because it's you, though.
971900	974262	No, no, and hold on, let me explain.
975322	975823	It's deep.
975963	977364	Where every gamer has a voice.
977524	978044	Deep.
978424	978804	It's deep.
978985	979965	Saints Row deep.
980165	980626	Alright.
981526	984228	Watch, hold on, you'll understand in just a second.
984568	985529	Okay, so here's why.
986209	988970	Saints Row was a great series, and I really enjoyed it.
989310	993171	And, I mean, pretty much the whole series has been in this generation so far.
993631	1003693	Well, the reason why third is most defining of this generation is because of all the business tactics that are being used in games nowadays.
1003973	1006994	It kind of introduced a lot of these things, at least to that series.
1007414	1009134	Like, for example, on-disc DLC.
1009234	1010815	DLC whoring.
1010835	1012115	DLC whoring.
1012615	1037806	really terrible DLC that they charge a lot of money for and you get very little content out of basically gutting what was a really good series and then turning it into some big monetization fest that is this generation of games it's basically something that you they've done so much to where you actually hate the series and yet you'll still buy it the next year that it comes out
1038866	1042049	That's basically this generation in gaming.
1043370	1045091	You take the abuse and you still come back.
1045912	1047493	Very interesting pick.
1051136	1053338	I can't really get around it.
1053378	1057021	I have two picks for the game of the generation, but one of them is not really a game.
1057081	1065548	So let me start with, and I know people are going to roll their eyes at this, but it really is, I think in many ways, the game that defined this generation for better or worse.
1066149	1067710	I believe that game is Wii Fit.
1069707	1070567	Get Off Your Ass The Game?
1072208	1072688	Kind of.
1073168	1077650	And I think that whole exergaming thing.
1078370	1081031	Now, some might go, well, why not Wii Sports?
1081271	1084212	And believe me, I was thinking Wii Sports big time.
1084772	1094456	But I really was thinking about more Wii Fit, how that really took what Wii Sports did for the whole get up off your butt and move gaming and really push that forward.
1094936	1096817	And really for the first time,
1097918	1104468	Didn't make video games look like something for lazy people And I think that was a very important turning point in this generation But DDR didn't?
1105449	1112280	DDR didn't catch on the way Wii Fit did Because Konami didn't believe in it the way Nintendo did Whether we like it or not Good point
1114657	1140500	I think when Nintendo really pushing Wii Fit and really getting it out there I think they really brought this counterbalance and moved the Wiis and exercise gaming altogether into the commonplace soccer moms were eating it up retirement homes, grandmas were playing video games and this was like a huge thing
1140791	1141972	I have another one, by the way.
1143313	1146756	You can't just have one because it's hard to define a whole generation of that.
1147097	1150099	And yes, this is not going to grant the thought of five again because that's just too easy.
1151441	1155684	Minecraft is another example of a thing that defines a generation.
1155965	1157846	You have an indie game that just goes...
1159267	1159587	and so on.
1179734	1182535	Hey, these indie games can actually be very good.
1182815	1189077	And now you're seeing a lot more focus on indie titles and stuff that's not coming from a big publisher or developer.
1189257	1191778	Well, that and the genre of sandbox games in general.
1192879	1193719	That's been around forever.
1193759	1194699	But yes, definitely.
1194719	1199061	But it really brought that back up into the limelight.
1199441	1199661	Yeah.
1200321	1207424	My other pick for the game, and I'm using my quotey fingers, that define this generation of games is Netflix.
1207444	1207504	Yes.
1210020	1211301	I didn't expect that, but yeah.
1237032	1237632	Not at my house.
1238893	1241795	But we had a dedicated computer set up just for that.
1242155	1243455	We didn't need to use any of that.
1243516	1244696	But admittedly, you're different.
1245216	1248778	And, you know, again, I'm thinking about the soccer mom families and so forth.
1248858	1254341	You know, really, there's people that go out there and buy Wii's because they're cheap Netflix boxes.
1256282	1257123	Yeah, there is that.
1257163	1264547	I mean, it's for the same reason that people bought PS3's or PS2's because of them being a DVD player and the Blu-ray player for PS3, so...
1266809	1281675	and one of the games one of the other games I would throw out there and then we'll change topics here I want to get into news stories one of the other games that really define the generation and you know I say for better or for worse and in this case it's definitely for worse I think Farmville
1283596	1284536	I just verped a bit.
1285357	1290978	But whether you like it or not, mobile and Facebook gaming has become bigger and bigger lately.
1291258	1294539	And again, it's the whole fact that it gets these people to play games.
1295059	1297660	Not just play them, but obsess over them.
1298440	1302181	Like grandma's going out of town because she's going on a cruise for a week.
1302221	1306442	Can somebody watch her farm so her freaking cows don't die or whatever it is.
1306462	1307183	That's my mother.
1307843	1308083	See?
1309181	1309902	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1324542	1328246	Alright, SSJ100Matt says Angry Birds also, definitely for those same reasons.
1328967	1332632	Extover says I think Wii Sports would be more defining than Wii Fit to be honest.
1332992	1335535	It really was the defining moment for all motion control games.
1336496	1341262	I do agree to a point Extover and I think Wii Sports, you know, obviously was, well it was
1341963	1345745	The biggest game this generation as far as sales go, you know.
1346005	1350927	But I think Wii Fit really took what Wii Sports started and just kind of put an exclamation point on it.
1350967	1352608	And that's kind of why I said Wii Fit.
1352968	1357730	And especially you start to look at how the connect and the move really got a piece of that.
1357830	1359971	It was a lot more the exercise gaming and all that.
1359991	1361052	I mean, look at all those games that come out.
1361072	1362072	They're all exercise games.
1362432	1363053	So, anyway.
1364433	1370660	Tiger Claw says two words, Horse Armor, which, you know, definitely Skyrim, I think is a game of the generation in some ways.
1371381	1375906	There's a lot of people, you know, that can play that game and only that game and never anything but that game.
1376086	1378169	I just don't think that Skyrim brought anything really new.
1378803	1383747	Tal says, or maybe that's Tal, sorry if I'm mispronouncing that, says at least no one mentioned Journey.
1384307	1387029	You know, Journey is a pretty incredible game though.
1387429	1391813	And I just, Journey kind of stands on its own.
1392874	1396937	I don't think we've yet seen how Journey has inspired other games yet.
1397957	1399819	But that might be coming in the next generation.
1400199	1404062	But Journey, I think Journey was an amazing game and one of the best of the generation.
1404502	1406484	But I don't know if it necessarily defined it.
1407364	1408185	Kind of the difference there.
1409093	1421100	Or if it had to be something that added definition to this generation of gaming, I would say that it brought back an artistic element that had been missing.
1421220	1423161	Call of Duty Modern Warfare.
1423842	1424042	Why?
1424582	1430145	Because it basically steamrolled the franchise that they have now.
1431566	1433868	Then there was that whole divorce after that, right?
1433908	1435609	Or was that Modern Warfare 2 that was after that?
1436069	1437690	That was after Modern Warfare 2, I think.
1438547	1440749	One more comment here and then I'll switch topics here.
1441089	1445932	Extover says, for me, The Last of Us is the epitome of the defining game of this generation.
1445992	1448934	To me, it was this generation's series finale.
1449535	1451996	That's an interesting analogy there.
1452997	1454378	You know, I can see that.
1454418	1455959	I mean, I've wanted to play the game.
1455999	1456740	I haven't played it yet.
1457460	1461663	But for everything that I've seen come up around it, I'd have to agree with that.
1461683	1463984	It's sort of like the cherry on top of the sundae.
1464885	1467727	I do like that analogy that it's the series finale.
1468508	1469769	I think that's a neat way of putting it.
1469809	1472091	And then we wake up and it's Bob Newhart in his bed.
1472932	1473692	It was all a dream.
1474133	1474413	All right.
1474854	1478117	How about the news that defined this generation?
1478717	1484563	You might really have to rack your brain a little bit, but what do you think was the news story that really defined this generation?
1484583	1486124	I'd say it was a series of news stories.
1486705	1490468	There might be more than one that you can think of, but something off the top of your head.
1490849	1492030	And I ask this to Chad as well.
1492967	1498872	Well, I'm really going to go with a series of them because they all go back to the same thing.
1498932	1505718	It's all the stupid, violence-blaming video games, which we've got psychological studies proving the exact opposite.
1505758	1511102	We have statistics showing that crime has decreased since the... When did the Nintendo come out?
1511142	1511303	Was it 91, 90?
1511363	1511443	Yeah.
1513244	1514865	The original Nintendo?
1515065	1515165	Yes.
1515325	1515165	85.
1515345	1516406	85.
1515425	1516406	I don't know why I was saying that.
1516546	1517166	The Super Nintendo.
1517206	1518607	I think you said Super Nintendo was 1991.
1519027	1526871	Because we've had a decrease in armed crime amongst youth over the last 20, 30 years.
1528692	1532054	But they still go back and try to do this as scapegoat.
1532114	1535396	It's still turning into this misunderstood thing.
1535896	1536957	When in reality...
1537757	1538479	DarkSakura.com
1548880	1549761	Loki, any thoughts?
1551281	1553223	It's a tough question, especially live.
1553423	1555184	I can't even remember what happened last year.
1556024	1562908	Like, you guys, I seriously told Loki and DarkSakura like five minutes before the show what was going to come up, as usually happens here in the world of live radio.
1562928	1565169	Well, I'm just trying to think of stuff.
1565209	1569272	I mean, there's the PlayStation Network hacking thing.
1569352	1570773	Since you brought it up, that was my number one.
1570993	1572414	The PlayStation Network hack.
1572774	1573774	I wouldn't even do that.
1573995	1574135	I'm
1576030	1597641	I don't know, it's just kind of, to me, maybe the Xbox One announcement and kind of all the stuff that went wrong during E3 and kind of the reversal of that stuff is kind of like this generation's almost, I don't know, some people like the specs and stuff that they have on the console and all the different DRM things and stuff.
1598061	1611208	But it's almost like, for the majority of the people, I think it's like this kind of nightmare situation, like this is the way things are going, and kind of, you know, demonstrating all the wrongs, all the stuff that's kind of gone wrong in this generation.
1611588	1615790	I don't know, I can't really think of anything that's super defining in this.
1616431	1617091	It's hard to say.
1617111	1622574	There hasn't really been any huge, huge, huge, like, changes, I would think.
1623447	1626049	I did think of two things that I would like to have been defining.
1626550	1632835	And one of them was how they were networking the PS3s as a computer to, what was it, leukemia or cancer research?
1633528	1634649	Oh, the Folding at Home?
1634829	1635489	Yeah.
1635990	1641573	I thought that's something that should have been defining, but people like to look at the negative instead of the positive.
1641973	1645475	But that and all of the charities that popped up around Next Generation Gaming.
1647196	1652859	I'm not saying that they popped up with this generation, but they've certainly come to higher prevalence with this generation.
1653899	1655781	We have Child's Play, Extra Life.
1656781	1664365	and I mean, yeah, a lot of them are going back and playing older consoles but we're seeing a lot more of these popping up and getting attention.
1664505	1672829	You know, I kind of tie that to the emergence of streaming your gameplay online and kind of Twitch TV and all the, you know, Ustream and all that.
1673289	1676371	as kind of, you know, I think that's one of the big things about this generation.
1676391	1688738	I think you see a lot of charity drives, you know, able to be done a lot easier and a lot more ground roots, you know, ground level types of fundraising.
1688778	1689738	Grassroots.
1689758	1689999	Thank you.
1690019	1690739	That's the word I was looking for.
1691319	1697861	types of fundraising because of being able to stream your games online and just have that instant audience.
1698241	1709064	I kind of think that story is evolving as we move into the PlayStation 4 and Xbox 360, going to have that stuff in there, although we'll get into the news in a minute here where there's some borders with that and what it will and won't do.
1709564	1714846	But I think that is definitely a big story that's kind of bridging the two generations.
1715927	1720949	I would really like for stuff like that to be the defining news of the generation.
1721009	1721269	Really?
1721870	1725851	The most defining, I think the most defining thing ever of this generation?
1726592	1727352	President Cat.
1730053	1734555	I more want to put it as you have communities of people coming together for a good cause through video games.
1735681	1741906	I love some of these answers here in chat, and this is a great one that I didn't even think of, and I'm sitting here going, why?
1741966	1742607	Why didn't I think of this?
1743748	1745650	Tal in our chatroom says, Kickstarter.
1746230	1747531	Any Kickstarter-related game.
1747832	1757180	And BlackWolf adds to that, the new story of this generation is either the emergence of Kickstarter or the internet bitching enough that a storyteller changed the ending of the story they wanted to tell.
1757440	1760103	But you know, both those things have something in common, and that is...
1760723	1763844	The voice of the internet has become a huge thing this generation.
1764164	1771946	If you think about it, I don't want to toot our own horn a little bit, but podcasting wasn't around last time.
1772146	1772406	Heck yeah.
1772466	1773227	And it is now.
1773987	1775607	And that's all a part of that.
1775687	1788011	It's just the voice of the gamer getting a little louder and those barriers, you know, it used to be the magazine would come to my home and that was the only way I kind of kept tabs on what was going on in the gaming industry.
1788351	1792075	But those barriers between us and the gaming industry are really coming down.
1792375	1793576	Twitter is a big part of that.
1793937	1797160	I can interact with developers directly for better or for worse.
1798028	1811952	Well, in general, though, that would be an evolution of communication itself, where many communities are coming together and having that interactivity that we didn't have, you know, 30 years ago, or that we barely had 30 years ago, I'll put it that way.
1812332	1813592	I mean, I met my husband online.
1814813	1822675	I've made tons, like the chat room is full of, you know, friends of mine now, you know, people I can call friends, so, and that I might not have met otherwise.
1823075	1823535	Absolutely.
1823615	1823795	So...
1824575	1829721	Um, and Tigerclaw says you could also add the whole thing with PSN being hacked and down for a few weeks.
1829841	1842033	Um, I said it briefly, but yeah, that would actually be my number one most defining thing I think was when PlayStation Network was hacked because I think in a lot of ways it, you know, how much information we're putting out there about ourselves easily.
1842494	1846298	I think a very tough lesson was learned in many ways all around the board.
1847299	1864715	Just like I think the last generation, the Xbox and PlayStation 2, I think the defining thing of that generation was Xbox Live It's almost like the defining thing of this generation was when the trust there kind of fails us, if that makes sense
1864895	1866836	Well, that's how you were over the Xbox thing.
1866876	1867297	Oh, sure.
1867897	1878924	And you really do understand a lot more of the nature of marketing, watching the reactions between the two companies, how they responded to their respective hackings.
1879325	1880385	Also, digital.
1880565	1886129	I mean, because there was a big push for Xbox Live Arcade, and I mean, that was something that happened.
1886229	1888511	And also, full-size digital games.
1888551	1894155	I mean, granted, I'm sure it was on the PC stuff a long time ago, but console-wise, digital's been a big thing.
1895215	1895796	What was that?
1896756	1908504	Alright, well, I'm sure you guys sitting there listening to the show have plenty more to add to this, so I invite you to email us or tweet us, especially while we're down during the week, and let us know what defined this generation, be it game or news, for you.
1908584	1912787	That's Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com, or you can tweet us at OLR.
1913007	1913808	One final thought, Jamie?
1914068	1916910	I'd say the crappiest thing about this generation?
1917390	1918111	Manuals!
1918491	1919972	We need manuals to come back!
1920232	1922454	And we need these companies to hire me to design them!
1923334	1949856	so in other words it's the downside to the digital exactly print is so beautiful I love manuals and I love posters and I love getting stuff with my game that I can put on my wall or you know keep Midna from eating alright let's move on I want to talk about our gaming weeks quickly we're running a little long tonight because that was a great kickoff topic thank you guys let's quickly talk about our gaming weeks Dark Sakura I'm not playing Animal Crossing right now at all am I
1950937	1979138	Final Fantasy XIV I've been kind of stalling on that just because I'm on my second job and it's so slow I was gifted thanks to D&L Dreams who is so sweet I gave her a box of yarn a while back and she has in return given me the Stanley Parable so I will be playing it very soon I played some Fractal I have been playing a little bit more of the Super Mario 3D world but like I said 3D kind of for me
1980078	1988604	Um, and Dan is playing, um, uh, Legend of Zelda, whichever the Oracle of Seasons ones is, our thing.
1989005	1993368	Yeah, Dan's, uh, he just finished, uh, Mimish Cap and he's, no, is he doing Mimish Cap now?
1993488	1996910	He's doing, he's doing one of them anyway, but Dan's going on this big Zelda kick lately.
1996990	2003595	So my, my house has been full of, uh, Zelda music and, uh, and lots of loud cursing.
2005234	2016963	And then, in addition to that, it's just been me hunting down stuff on Steam that I haven't played in a while and actually trying to get some use out of these games and stuff I've gotten on sale before.
2017504	2018424	So, I don't know.
2018564	2018945	What about you?
2020486	2022367	I'm sorry.
2022427	2023248	I'm reading Reddit.
2024189	2024729	Reddit's funny.
2025910	2027792	I don't know.
2027812	2028772	What have I played this week?
2029913	2033116	Grand Theft Auto V. Yeah, that would have been Grand Theft Auto V, yes.
2034111	2035972	So I played a bit of online.
2036272	2041373	We did a very short VOG game night this week, thanks to the one person that came out.
2042173	2044214	I guess everybody else is doing more important things.
2045434	2051235	But next week, though, next week on Friday, we will be doing another VOG game night, this time on PlayStation 3.
2051976	2059438	So if you have the PlayStation 3 version of Grand Theft Auto V and wish to play with us online, we will be doing that 8.15 on Friday.
2059598	2059858	You know what?
2059878	2060878	I should get Dan in on that.
2061306	2061786	You should.
2061806	2062847	It's a good time.
2062867	2064607	Because he would be hilarious.
2065467	2068288	I mean, he's hilarious anyway, and he's also funny looking, but he'd be even funnier.
2068508	2068969	He'd be fun.
2069169	2074370	And I'm going to try to get my coworkers that are not too old that won't fall asleep.
2075691	2084334	I swear to God, it's just like, you know, my boss had to, yeah, I totally forgot to play last time because I got home and I just fell asleep.
2084354	2084374	I
2085034	2085654	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2105140	2105841	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2121454	2124555	Pain in the ass, I can't get the plane low enough to trigger it.
2125095	2126876	So, I don't know.
2127196	2132838	But I got all my stunt jumps done and all my collectibles done and I'm at 96 or 7% now.
2133399	2140321	So I just have to do night flights, fly under some bridges, and go to the strip club with my friends.
2140361	2141802	That's actually one of the things I have to do.
2143883	2145143	Alright, that it?
2145603	2147644	It's not a night in Los Santos without boobs.
2148747	2167650	um my gaming week was you know a lot of Final Fantasy 14 as is to be expected as of late but I'm having a great time in that game and uh Shane is bugging me and as as our other members of my free company are bugging me to finish my relic plus one quest so I do really need to do that uh but otherwise just having a good time uh you know getting my dark light gear completed and all that
2168370	2183053	as far as other new games to talk about well this one's not new but it's like a fresh coat of paint on an old classic and that would be the Wii U virtual console release of Super Castlevania 4 and I was playing that because that came out was it on Halloween or the day before?
2183093	2196676	It was this week and since I already had it on Wii it was only like a dollar to get the Wii U version which was great because I can even and before tonight's show I was sitting here playing it and it was on the TV behind me and DarkSakura goes it's so weird that when your TV moves by itself
2197515	2202179	Hey, you know, I was really proud of myself when I stepped in and I recognized it just where you had it paused.
2202900	2205022	I was like, that looks Super Nintendo.
2205182	2206383	That's not Richter.
2206543	2207484	Okay, it's Super Castlevania 4.
2207524	2208845	Yeah, absolutely.
2209206	2212889	So, yeah, an amazing classic.
2213009	2217874	And if for whatever reason you missed this game and you happen to own a Wii U, I really urge you to pick it up.
2218034	2222638	I imagine most people that are on the Wii U probably already played this at some point, but...
2222898	2223659	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2240880	2255692	Also, earlier this week, and I know we're going to get into this in the news, so it might be a little bit redundant, but on Monday, I think it was Monday, the Typing of the Dead Overkill came out, which is the new Typing of the Dead based on the House of the Dead Overkill, which was the Wii version of the game.
2256212	2262057	So, when I heard there was a new Typing of the Dead, I was like, yes, please, buy, because it's, what, 50% off on Steam during the week?
2262077	2262717	10 bucks, yeah.
2268542	2269623	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2289918	2291439	Dreamcast packs don't show on people's backs
2311506	2340009	they had a move it was move enabled I think it also allowed you to you could use the analog sticks if you really want to I just I guess I never really get into those games on the home console like the last shooter game I really truly loved at home was point-blank okay and that was a long time ago oh that needs to come back I know those games were amazing but anyway um you know I never really got into time crisis or any of the on-rails shooters at home that's more of an arcade thing to me so I never really played house of the dead but I love timing of the
2340049	2341750	It sounded like you said Ask the Dead for a minute.
2342651	2344252	You know, there's actually a reason I did not buy it.
2345393	2347775	Because I need bad voice acting in my House of the Dead.
2348856	2351058	We're beating G over there.
2351318	2355701	Well, I do believe that this is the one that had the most uses of fuck in it.
2355741	2366330	Oh my gosh, it's so over the top and it's really dirty, nasty dialogue and exploitation films of the past and like Quentin Tarantino style 70s.
2366350	2366670	It's...
2368431	2369152	It's crazy.
2392689	2394030	I just thought that was funny.
2394310	2394850	That was funny.
2395210	2396131	Okay, that's pretty cool.
2396171	2397532	So, anyway, yeah.
2397632	2397972	Loved it.
2398632	2407297	And HitStun in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, I was also disappointed in the lack of visible keyboards, and yes, it contains House of the Dead Overkill Extended Cut.
2407597	2411519	Yes, if you want to use your mouse and play the clicky-click version, you can do that too.
2412019	2413580	But for me, it's all about the typing.
2413760	2414380	You know what, though?
2415140	2425403	I do have to say that the best thing to ever come out of Typing of the Dead was cosplay I saw at AX one year that had the Dreamcast pack and the keyboard and everything.
2425443	2426003	That was awesome.
2426103	2426643	That's awesome.
2427164	2427524	Amazing.
2428164	2428504	All right.
2429284	2431405	Let's get into gaming news.
2431425	2433585	I want to do some housekeeping real quick, though, before we get there.
2434246	2437987	Once again, I said this earlier, but just a reminder, we will not be here live next week.
2438667	2438887	So...
2440117	2442140	But I will be here live, just not on air.
2442380	2443081	Just not on air.
2443121	2444443	Maybe you'll do a Twitch thing or something.
2444463	2445124	I don't know.
2445385	2445505	No.
2445525	2445945	No, probably not.
2446026	2447348	All right.
2447388	2449050	I'll do my homework and let you guys watch.
2449070	2451413	We're taking a night off because you know what?
2451614	2453617	Sometimes we want a night off.
2453917	2455720	I'm sneaking myself off in Rob's luggage.
2457701	2463423	Also in housekeeping tonight, I want to mention that we unveiled something new at vognetwork.com tonight.
2463943	2468045	You can hear the in-depth discussion on the Bobby Blackwolf show when he posts his episode midweek.
2468845	2475147	But in a nutshell, the game at vognetwork.com now includes a raffle element.
2475547	2484393	So in other words, when you check into shows, you get your points, you do all that, you can potentially earn real crap that we will ship to you.
2484833	2486735	And this month's crap is pretty good.
2486835	2487935	It's Cards Against Humanity.
2487995	2489937	It's a sealed version of a very hard-to-get game.
2490317	2492378	So yeah, I'm sure there'll be some people that want to get that.
2492679	2494480	So all you have to do, you have to enter, though.
2494500	2496601	You're not automatically put in just because you get points.
2496641	2500824	You do have to enter, and you can check that out at vognetwork.com slash raffles.
2500844	2505167	And I think that also shows up now on the left side of the page under your user info.
2505607	2507168	Thank you for watching!
2530743	2541015	and many of you have been until now so we just want to say thank you very much and hope you enjoy this new little twist on the VOG Network game.
2543318	2548525	One other thing I gotta say and then we can get into news but this is important and I want to wish a very happy
2548985	2549686	Thanks for watching!
2568747	2597081	Brad and his gang over there at PodCulture Christina, Adam, all those guys have been a great support of OLR especially Brad in the support that he's given these projects here at OLR he supports Horde House in a huge way he helped set up the website and get that show hosted at Horde House so I'm so appreciative for that the microphones that we use here now at OLR were kind of handed down from Brad from PodCulture
2597981	2600302	So, yeah, they've just been such a great support over the years.
2600322	2602042	And they're squishy.
2602062	2603242	Well, with the little foamy hats.
2603282	2603702	Yes, they are.
2603722	2604142	They're squishy.
2604362	2604863	Mine's red.
2604943	2605903	I like it.
2606143	2607463	It's for our listeners' protection.
2607863	2608283	That's right.
2608343	2608723	That's right.
2609483	2613264	So, yeah, I just want to say a big thank you and congratulations because 400 is an epic milestone.
2613384	2615405	I remember when you were just a wee 150.
2615445	2617525	All right.
2618385	2618785	There you go.
2618925	2621586	So congrats to all those guys over there at PodCulture.
2623737	2629182	To register for participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VOGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, TURN.
2629362	2631183	Alright, let's start with the gaming news tonight.
2631544	2633445	Loki, please, if you would, start us off with the news.
2633805	2641672	Well, you know, one of the taglines for the PlayStation 3 this generation was, it only does, and then they list a ton of shit.
2641812	2649959	Well, this week they decided to put out a fact, or they being Sony, decided to put out a fact outlining the stuff that the PlayStation 4 won't do.
2650739	2656302	And that includes a few things at launch, which of course you're going to have to update your system and stuff.
2657142	2663446	It's going to lack DLNA support, so you're not really going to be able to stream stuff from media servers too easily.
2664286	2671850	Also, it doesn't feature a music visualizer, and that's probably because it doesn't play any CDs.
2672811	2678616	And also, dynamic themes are not supported, which makes sense because it kind of changed the whole user interface anyways.
2680218	2682380	And MP3 playback is not going to happen.
2684041	2696373	And if you want to listen to music or see videos or that kind of thing, you can do that through Sony Music's unlimited service and video unlimited service.
2698069	2699430	You know, actually, here's the thing.
2700030	2703913	I'm not entirely sure that you can't stream stuff to your PS4.
2704414	2708236	Because I remember the Wii had that kind of problem, too, where you couldn't stream stuff.
2708256	2717163	But they had a lot of services set up where you go to a web page, or you set up, like, a server, and it creates a web page on your network, and then you just do it through the web browser.
2717463	2719024	So there might be a workaround there.
2719304	2721005	That's essentially a hack.
2721105	2725246	I mean, not like a hack like you think, but it's a workaround.
2725466	2726767	It's still annoying that they did that.
2727347	2739011	And the other thing they were saying too, the PlayStation 4 share button and record capabilities, apparently that is going to be kind of limited to Twitch.
2739391	2742692	You're not going to be able to upload videos to YouTube.
2743733	2743893	And...
2745011	2745451	Thanks for watching!
2761005	2762066	So, I don't know.
2763106	2764046	I don't think that's a big deal.
2764066	2767008	They have to have something in place if they want to protect whatever they're doing.
2767028	2769289	But this is at launch, so, I mean, it makes sense.
2770129	2774511	They're also saying Ustream footage will not be saved for later playback, so, whatever.
2776392	2783055	The other thing I was going to mention, one of the things, actually, when Bobby was talking about it on the show, and I had mentioned it on the show, and Rob said, hey, save that for the show.
2785036	2787377	My thoughts about the MP3 playback, because it kind of sucks.
2787757	2807451	and you know I've been seeing the conspiracy theory out there where they're like well they're just trying to get people to you know participate in Sony's music unlimited service or something like that I think there might be actually another reason behind it if you think about it first off they have to build it in the game so that you know to have mp3 playback but let's just assume that it works with games kind of like how it does now
2808686	2809206	Thanks for watching!
2832160	2833101	Sony Music Unlimited
2844185	2845426	It's a very interesting thought.
2845527	2856356	I should probably just throw out there the point that there are many streams on Twitch TV today where the person's playing Warcraft or League of Legends, and they're listening to iTunes in the background.
2856657	2860540	So you do hear licensed music go out through Twitch TV all the time, and it's kind of a gray area.
2860921	2869769	And Twitch kind of says, I think in their legal fact, and I'm going off my memory, so I apologize if I'm wrong or misrepresenting, but I want to say it just kind of says, you know, we don't really...
2870409	2875413	We consider it kind of like fair use or whatever as long as they don't complain about it type of thing.
2876814	2880737	They have no reason to go out and take it down because it's just part of a broadcast.
2881217	2883919	So it's kind of a gray area right now.
2883979	2885941	But I think that's an interesting perspective.
2886001	2892146	Sony, as a record label as well as this, maybe has a vested interest in not having you be able to stream your music.
2892166	2895728	And it could be that they are just trying to sell more subscriptions to Music Unlimited.
2895768	2896449	But let's be honest.
2896509	2898310	I mean, if I have a PlayStation 4...
2900072	2902694	I don't think I need to really necessarily do that.
2903014	2908098	Oh, the other thing too, it's not going to support USB hard drive support or memory sticks at launch.
2908458	2909860	I don't like that.
2910720	2914804	I don't understand the reason behind it, especially when it's something that's already in the PlayStation 3.
2915564	2919588	I don't know why, but whatever the case, this is just at launch.
2920308	2920989	Stuff can change.
2921630	2929200	One other thing though that's come out is the Xbox One will support playback of CDs.
2929781	2933346	It will also support DLNA streaming as well.
2934007	2934508	Although
2938804	2940185	I guess it's a little different.
2940645	2942305	MP3 playback you can't do.
2942565	2946607	They're saying to do that, the system I guess is set up as like a Play 2 receiver.
2947287	2956610	And that means you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 PC or Windows Phone I guess to stream to it.
2957170	2959071	Kind of like the Windows Media Center or something like that.
2959271	2959931	Buy our products.
2960591	2961351	Basically, yeah.
2961391	2962612	It's kind of locked into that.
2963072	2963332	So...
2965151	2987331	I don't know, I mean, that's kind of annoying, but whatever the reasons, you know, it is a little disappointing that you can't out of the box use it as like a media server or something like that, because that's why I use my PlayStation 3 for a lot, but I guess their thoughts would be, oh, well, just use your PlayStation 3 for that, or buy a PlayStation 3 for that specific purpose.
2987852	2991575	It's still annoying, and hopefully later on, maybe a year from now, or
2991755	2994457	PKJr92 says I would think it would be super easy to just not allow anything playing locally to stream.
3014813	3015534	I would think two.
3015654	3017917	I think so too, but they are rushing.
3018718	3020700	A lot of stuff is kind of in rush mode right now.
3020820	3023943	Maybe that's kind of like, okay, let's not worry about that right now.
3024003	3027067	Let's just do this and then we'll fix it later.
3028256	3036520	My thought with that is that they might also be managing it some of the similar way that I've been using live stream lately for a lot of my drawing stuff.
3037240	3040742	And you actually can choose what channels you have input into your stream.
3041502	3045084	So I mean, they probably have like maybe a channel selector of some sort.
3046104	3054929	Brad from PodCulture says, it's better to not have features to start out and then add later versus launch with features that get taken away like other OS on PlayStation 3.
3054989	3056069	That is very much the truth.
3056490	3057110	Very much the truth.
3059191	3059491	All right.
3059591	3061172	Well, let's move on with some other stories.
3062052	3068415	This is – I have no better way to put this than this was the tweet that was heard around the world this week.
3069076	3073498	And it was actually a twit longer because it was too much for one tweet actually.
3073658	3076580	XBOX ONE XBOX ONE XBOX ONE XBOX ONE XBOX ONE
3095849	3098251	and were native 1080p on the PlayStation 4.
3099011	3103074	We optimized each console to hit 60 frames per second and the game looks great on both.
3103454	3106336	Still on the road, but glad to see the great reception to Extinction.
3106396	3107717	Can't wait for next week's launch.
3108577	3110639	And yeah, that went over...
3112082	3113023	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3140679	3156825	So, I mean, based on those two games and speculating like crazy, it sounds like the Xbox One, it's harder to get the graphics and stuff to be where they need to be in order to get the performance that you have on that system.
3156985	3157826	That's what it sounds like.
3157866	3159466	It's easier to do it on the PlayStation 4.
3159606	3162388	Let me ask a couple devil's advocate questions that are important.
3162888	3163908	One, 720p versus 900p.
3166409	3168190	Is there really a difference?
3168910	3171211	Can I really see the difference between the two?
3171711	3172951	Is it that big of a deal?
3174132	3185236	You'll note, well, it was hard because they did some side-by-side comparisons, but the problem is that the Xbox One version doesn't have a patch for some of the anti-aliasing stuff that they're going to have in there.
3186857	3190638	So right now it does look more jaggy on the Xbox One.
3191098	3192739	Is that going to change when that patch comes out?
3193519	3197080	Probably, so is it very hard to tell the difference between the two?
3198121	3209625	Yeah, for most people, you're not going to notice a huge difference, but the more detail that you have in there, especially with these consoles pushing more detail, you're going to notice it eventually.
3209865	3212926	And also, the other thing is, it's a next-gen fucking game!
3213326	3216548	It should be running at 1080p in my opinion.
3218289	3230876	If it's running at the same resolution as a regular Xbox 360 game, and some Xbox 360 games are probably running higher resolutions, why am I spending $500 on this fucking system in the first place?
3231196	3234337	What am I getting out of it that's different than the Xbox 360 version?
3236018	3242363	Looking at our chat at live.vognetwork.com, Ranma says, also, if you're gaming on a 32-inch TV, you will not see the difference.
3243244	3245765	Bonds006 says, though, yes, there is a difference.
3246766	3254531	Ranma also speculates, I think that because of the usage of system memory, PlayStation 4 is using GDDR5 and Xbox One is using DDR3.
3254932	3255532	That could be it.
3255612	3257333	GDDR memory is for video cards.
3258754	3264339	The other devil's advocate point I wanted to bring up is, weren't we in this exact reverse situation last generation?
3265039	3284294	And I specifically think of the game Oblivion, because I seem to remember when that came out for PlayStation 3, and it came out a year after it was out on 360, and people were like, it sucks, and the slowness of the Blu-ray drive holds it back, and it's graphically not as good, it's buggy.
3285655	3287277	But did that really ruin the PlayStation 3?
3287901	3288001	No.
3318284	3334295	I mean, for some people that's not a big deal, but when you're spending $500, $400 on a new system, you're going to be paying attention to every single... Especially when you're looking at games, like if I'm looking to play Call of Duty, that's a game that's not exclusive to one of those consoles.
3334916	3343202	I'm going to be looking at every damn thing, and if it runs better on one system than another one... Like, for example, if I was buying a next-gen system for Oblivion or Skyrim...
3344082	3358199	I wouldn't be buying a Playstation 3 because it ran like shit on the Playstation 3 until about 8 patches later then it finally ran okay for Skyrim I'm not sure if they ever fixed Oblivion but it took a long time well
3359973	3365438	I think... I do understand that point of wanting to have the capability to run higher.
3366338	3372663	But there also, I mean, you got to think about the average person who's going to be able to afford having the huge TV that will show it off.
3373464	3377848	Like, I mean, for me, yeah, I would want all of that.
3377908	3383192	But if the average player isn't going to have the TV to show it off, why worry about it?
3383252	3384633	It's still going to look great either way.
3385729	3413705	more comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Dungeon Buster says Bethesda had little experience with the Playstation 3 at the time too they've gotten better though the problems with Skyrim's DLC still point out issues they have with it and Extover says I say it's too early to tell let's wait until next year when next gen exclusives come out more often you know that is true these are launch games and every other generation we've seen that you put the launch games next to the games that come out at the end of the generation and you see the progress

3433484	3439968	I mean, granted, they're going to have some better physics and stuff, like, ooh, moving grass, ooh, you know, leaves are rustling.
3440248	3442990	But, you know, for a lot of people, it doesn't matter.
3443050	3450595	The majority of the copies of Call of Duty are going to be sold on the Xbox 360, like they are every other year.
3451495	3453477	Last comment from our chat, then we'll go to DarkSakura's story.
3454037	3458701	BlackWolf says frames per second, or FPS, is more important than resolution anyway.
3459061	3462884	A constant 60 frames a second outweighs the number of pixels on the screen.
3463265	3463565	Amen.
3463885	3470170	I agree with that immensely, because I'll play Final Fantasy XIV in crappier graphics settings just to get it to run smooth.
3470451	3473173	That's more important than it being pretty.
3473853	3475315	Anyhow, let's move on.
3475335	3480639	We could debate this all day long, as people have been doing on the internet for a long time, but we have a lot of shows still to go.
3481257	3482440	Who remembers the pocket station?
3482882	3484707	Me Do you remember the pocket station?
3484927	3485409	I have one
3486195	3487076	I need to steal Jewelies.
3487156	3488116	I mean, borrow Jewelies.
3488297	3491199	Isn't that how you raised a Chocobo in Final Fantasy VIII or something like that?
3491219	3491619	Hell yeah.
3491779	3496903	Yeah, and it also had a stat mode for... What was that game?
3497904	3503808	Shitty Justice Gakuen Evolution, the Rival Schools second edition that came out on PlayStation.
3503828	3511714	I don't remember if it was official or non-official, but it had a wonderful DDR non-stop course editor for the fourth mix.
3511934	3512875	Yes, yes.
3514056	3516798	Well, there was a teaser that came out.
3516818	3526845	There's basically this four-minute PlayStation Japan video that's out that teases the Pocket Station.
3528006	3533230	So we could possibly see something similar to it coming out with PS4.
3533570	3535511	I mean, of course, this is just a hint at it.
3535551	3540115	Nothing etched in stone or engraved in metal, I should say.
3540856	3542077	But who knows?
3542157	3545442	I mean, I used the hell out of my VMU on my Dreamcast.
3545462	3551410	I think I carried like three VMUs on my keychain at one time because I had my Chao, Dan's Chao, and my Godzilla.
3552361	3555103	It could make a very interesting iPhone or Android app.
3555123	3556645	I was going to say, it's going to be an app.
3556705	3557906	It's not going to be a device.
3558286	3561569	It just seems very obvious to be a great use for the app.
3562329	3563110	I think it would be fun.
3564111	3565252	Especially if they have the little cat.
3566033	3566793	Because I love the cat.
3567594	3570376	The little mascot that's shown up
3571557	3591393	ever since it would be awesome because you know they can the Playstation 3 can play the older games which I'm assuming is a matter of time before you see that on Playstation 4 as well that they you know bring out the library of old PS1 and 2 games that would be really awesome if you could get a Pocket Station emulator on your phone I know that might be asking too much but I think it would be really cool
3591775	3604678	You know what would be nice is using, if you get that emulator and they start bringing out localized games that we never saw, sort of like how Nintendo's doing with the Wii U. True.
3604758	3605339	That'd be fun.
3605999	3606299	Alright.
3606879	3607719	Let's move on, Loki.
3608519	3608840	Alright.
3610980	3615201	Microsoft has put out a brand new privacy policy.
3615882	3619002	They're talking about how they collect data.
3619142	3627285	This is mainly referring to the Kinect and talking about what features they record.
3627725	3638188	Basically, the Kinect camera actually records some information as far as your facial recognition and stuff, but it saves that to your console, so that's actually not shared.
3639229	3644954	They did say, though, that you could, I guess, turn off, of course, the Kinect features at any time.
3645995	3649258	And the voice, I guess, commands are captured, but I don't think those are shared.
3649939	3653642	Skype, though, on the other hand, well, nothing's guaranteed to be private there.
3654242	3661169	So I guess they can get that if you want, which is not surprising because I think they're already sharing it at the NSA anyways.
3663370	3663811	And then...
3664625	3674472	The thing that's kind of been the bane of my existence, at least on the Xbox 360 right now, they want some updated contact information for your safety.
3674812	3683198	So like second ways to contact you via email or texting you or phone calls and stuff like that.
3684279	3688561	I've tried to put my information in there a few times now, and it never fucking takes.
3688922	3690142	I remember you bitching about this before.
3690222	3691663	It says, oh, I don't have it.
3691703	3696085	So now I just back out of it every goddamn time because I've already put that stuff in there.
3696205	3701268	The website said it was confirmed, yet it keeps nagging me for fucking information over and over.
3701328	3702148	It'll send me the text.
3702168	3702849	I'll confirm it.
3703329	3707351	It fucking even sent me the text, and I was going to confirm it on the Xbox 360.
3707391	3710553	It's like, no, sorry, you have to visit this website to do that.
3710913	3712954	Then why the fuck are you nagging me through this?
3714201	3725044	But yeah, so anyways, now if you, I guess you could link your service account with, you know, some other stuff and you have to have some sort of like name, address, email and all that stuff.
3726504	3729065	And that's just to protect the hacks and all that, right?
3729225	3730065	Yeah, they claim.
3730425	3733386	Yeah, it can text you if somebody's trying to spend a lot of money or something like that, right?
3733426	3740067	I think it's more of like, you know, second way to authenticate yourself, you know, because Google does that now, Steam does it.
3740107	3741028	Sure, sure.
3741608	3742488	With emails, so.
3743008	3743488	Makes sense.
3743788	3750211	I appreciate them at least trying to protect things, especially after having money stolen in the Xbox 360 very easily.
3750871	3755894	I appreciate that they're taking the extra step, even if it's a little sloppy from Loki's perspective.
3756514	3768219	And also, just as a reminder, you probably want to make sure that you go to Xbox.com and go to your account settings to make sure that you opt out of all of the
3768699	3775041	sharing of that information with Microsoft Parties and company affiliates, resellers, distributors, etc., etc., etc.
3775261	3779462	Because I'm sure that they conveniently left that on, you know.
3779482	3780542	Of course, of course.
3781842	3788764	All right, moving on to some highly controversial news this week, and this one just really blew me away.
3789064	3789224	And...
3790784	3791204	Oh boy.
3793125	3800567	We just had a comment earlier in the show about somebody said it's better to add a feature after the console comes out than to take something away.
3800767	3801487	I believe that was Brad.
3801767	3802448	Yes, it was Brad.
3802708	3806889	And we are seeing this week something getting taken away.
3807149	3813531	And it's Nintendo who disabled the Swap Note application on their 3DS.
3814351	3816332	And it's due to the exchange of, quote,
3817012	3843216	explicit material now it should be pointed out I may have overdone it there because they didn't disable the entire app but they disabled the spot pass feature which for most people was the app that means sending the notes through the internet so you can no longer send pictures of your cats through the internet because some kids were exchanging explicit material and I guess they just found this out what two years after the app launched and
3843936	3846157	Some users were exchanging offensive material.
3847437	3853658	The feature was deactivated to, quote, limit the risk of any inappropriate activity or misuse of a service.
3854739	3869182	Further quotes from Nintendo's notice, quote, Nintendo has learned that some consumers, including miners, have been exchanging their friend codes on internet bulletin boards and then using Swapnote, known as Nintendo Letterboxd in other regions, to exchange offensive material.
3869722	3880211	Nintendo has been investigating ways of preventing this and determined it is best to stop the spot pass feature of swap note because it allows the direct exchange of photos and was actively misused.
3880732	3888058	Nintendo always wants to provide a positive experience for all consumers and limit the risk of any inappropriate activity or misuse of a service.
3888599	3891441	We feel it is important on this occasion to take this action.
3892182	3896386	We are very sorry for any inconvenience to the many consumers who have been using this service.
3896806	3904673	Nintendo will continue to work to ensure more consumers are aware of our parental control features which allow parents to manage their children's experience on our systems.
3906234	3907735	Nintendo just now learned this.
3908216	3909637	Two afters after the fact.
3910157	3918464	That if you give teenagers access to the internet they're going to take pictures of their penis and send it to their friends.
3918865	3920386	It took you two years to figure that out?
3921994	3923236	I am just shocked.
3935390	3940411	at the... Like, I don't even know what word to use with it.
3940431	3941651	It's a degree of naivety.
3941991	3948873	Yes, I think naivety... God damn it, I keep wanting to say naivety because it's Christmas.
3949713	3950293	Naivety.
3950493	3953354	It is not remotely Christmas, it's Hanukkah first.
3953914	3954694	I mean Thanksgiving.
3955054	3956474	I mean Thanksgiving-ka.
3956694	3959775	But I'm just blown away by...
3960635	3968398	Honestly, honest to God, it took you two years to get to that point, and now you're taking it away because kids look up porn online?
3970879	3977042	And yet, you leave the internet browser, which I'm sure you've made terrible on purpose.
3977382	3987786	The first thing I did when I saw this news story is I went to my DS browser, I pulled up gay porn, and I took a picture of it and put it on Twitter saying, well, Nintendo didn't really remove the porn from my DS, now did they?
3988666	3990087	But they removed the child porn.
3991155	3997962	What is it that I told Bobby when he cast the shows over to us?
3998342	4002787	I was like, there are two things that you're going to have on a device the moment it comes out.
4003147	4004269	And that's porn and Linux.
4005830	4006151	It's true.
4007671	4009413	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4025589	4028491	or all this party and Spike and I were talking about this a lot.
4028511	4030892	Spike's a big Nintendo fan and I understand why.
4030912	4033934	Nintendo does make some great games as I said earlier.
4034334	4037035	The game I'm most looking forward to this holiday season is a Nintendo game.
4037376	4039777	A Nintendo game in many ways defined last generation.
4040877	4066633	and he was throwing out a theory that maybe this has to do with the 2DS and the fact that the 2DS is marketed a bit more towards children and because Nintendo is more actively pursuing the kid market maybe they have to pay a little more attention to what kids can actually do with the device and although I totally understand that point and respect it there's a part of me that goes well god damn it when are we going to put some onus on the parents because a kid doesn't walk into Toys R Us and plop down $130 on a 2DS.
4069654	4071534	Somebody drove them there, if they do.
4071875	4074295	There is a lot of irresponsibility on the part of parents, I think.
4075695	4080717	So put the 2DS in a giant envelope that says Parental Warning in big red letters.
4081477	4083937	To disable internet on this device.
4084958	4098301	But, you know, the thing, and this goes a little bit into marketing too, is that when you have a system with a warning label on it, you have a chance that a parent's going to just see the warning.
4099281	4101605	and go, oh, well, I don't want to do this risk.
4101665	4104369	It's easier not to deal with it than have to work for it.
4105130	4109477	I've got too much else on my plate with my kid or how can I watch everything all the time?
4109537	4110959	It's better just to not get it.
4111340	4113282	You know, I see it that way too.
4114585	4115946	Video Chat
4136283	4144430	So right at this moment, I could go on and I could call whoever's on their Wii U right now and I could say, hey, look at this, and pull down my pants and show them my balls.
4145411	4148714	And there's... I mean, is Nintendo going to shut down the video chat too?
4149174	4159703	Because, heaven forbid, a child unsupervised uses the device because the parents were too lazy to enable parental controls and starts, you know, showing their goods to predators.
4160844	4161244	Which I...
4162285	4165647	Again, I'm not... Don't misunderstand me.
4166547	4172050	That's the terrible thing, and people who prey on kids like that should have horrible, horrible things done to them.
4172490	4179133	But I think there has to be responsibility on the parents' part that if you put a device like this in the home, you need to watch what your kids are doing.
4180094	4182215	I would like to respond to HitStun, by the way.
4182535	4184496	And what does HitStun say in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com?
4184516	4185817	Why, they just patch out photos?
4186217	4186437	Mm-hmm.
4186917	4190139	Well, I mean, it's not stopping people from, you know, drawing...
4191900	4194382	Well, and photos were the best part.
4194822	4196323	So how are you supposed to share your photos now?
4196363	4197564	I like photos of pussy.
4197664	4201847	What's the point of having a 3D camera on the thing if you can't share it with anyone?
4202087	4207811	Because you can take them off on your SD card and email them.
4208011	4213194	Swapnote came after the launch anyway, so you can technically still view them on your card.
4213375	4216717	And I guess hypothetically, yeah, you could email them or something, but...
4217497	4218297	It really did.
4218777	4221738	And I saw the word used in chat here by PKJr92.
4221778	4224059	Nintendo neutered the service.
4224079	4226700	Yeah, it really neutered the photography.
4227100	4229900	And even Nintendo's own implementation.
4230080	4231941	Like, you can take the screenshots in Animal Crossing.
4232181	4233561	And they touted that as a big feature.
4234002	4237042	And how you could, like, you know... I'll be honest.
4237803	4242524	I've done one screen cap through Swapnote and all the rest of them I pulled off my SD card and put on my Tumblr.
4243164	4243384	Okay.
4245734	4257305	The ones that are on my fan page on Facebook, I took those on my game and just copied them over because they come across as, I believe, as JPEGs if you don't use the 3D mode.
4259487	4261249	Alright, so there you go.
4263591	4265433	I'm just very disappointed in this news.
4265513	4267735	It's like every time you think Nintendo gets it,
4268495	4268996	They don't.
4269116	4271897	Oh, by the way, this is still a thing that's going around.
4272557	4277160	There's an app called WeKaraokeU, and I don't believe that's here in the U.S.
4277220	4282003	I think that's something that's only available in Japan because, you know, karaoke's a little bigger overseas.
4282023	4284644	They only have WeSing or something.
4284724	4286385	I don't think that has any karaoke in it.
4286545	4287206	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4308862	4311823	and people are just making a point out of this.
4311883	4316905	It's like Nintendo, you still can do many adult things if you want to with your console.
4316925	4325088	It's Joy Sound is the karaoke thing and if I remember correctly, I do believe a Joy Sound game has come out over here for the Wii.
4325229	4326109	I don't believe the Wii U yet.
4326129	4327269	I don't think it's on the Wii U yet, yeah.
4327689	4328510	I think I remember that.
4329210	4350496	but it's just you know again it's it's a little ridiculous and unfortunately just you know accentuates the reason why Nintendo constantly gets ridiculed for not understanding online and this doesn't make me feel a little more comfortable about their situation sorry to say well all right let's move on with more news DarkSakura
4351302	4356350	I feel a little bit like I don't want to take from Bobby's interview earlier.
4357552	4358974	Think of it as giving him a cheap plug.
4359477	4369262	Yeah, so I'm actually going to say, everyone, if you want more of the information on this, make sure that you go listen to Bobby's show, which you can download on iTunes and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and VOGnetwork.com.
4369882	4372203	So, but I am going to go ahead and tell you what happened.
4373484	4382428	And there's a company called Wadjet Eye, and that's W-A-D-J-E-T, and I love companies with mythological names.
4382708	4383189	It's just cool.
4384189	4390771	So anyway, there was a game put out called Blackwell Deception, and it was put out for free.
4390811	4393351	There were codes that you could download to play the game.
4393731	4399393	Well, people were taking those free codes and setting them up to resell them, which I think is shitty.
4400533	4403894	So basically, they just took them all down and said...
4404574	4406014	Well, no, we don't want that to happen.
4406374	4409355	But it wasn't necessarily the codes that went down.
4409395	4410695	It was the page that went down.
4410916	4412956	So, well, the link to the page that went down.
4413056	4415717	So basically people were still going to that and getting all the codes.
4416497	4421938	So there's about 30,000 codes worth of games now that have been removed from Steam.
4422878	4424459	And I believe it was 30,000, didn't he say?
4424479	4424739	Yeah.
4425379	4433149	Yeah, he said this during the interview too, that he just did those last 30,000 from the time he went to bed because he was up for 30 hours because of the situation.
4433730	4434551	On his anniversary?
4434571	4435412	That's shitty.
4436293	4437795	But anyway...
4440180	4448242	It just, I'm not going to say it baffles me that people will abuse the generosity of others because it happens.
4448343	4448763	I'm sorry.
4449303	4454624	If you've got people who think they can make a profit off of other people, they're going to do it.
4454744	4455365	Humble Bundle.
4455705	4457005	All the time this happens with Humble Bundle.
4457025	4458226	Which is why that changed.
4458346	4464668	Yeah, we talked about it on the show that people are eBaying their codes on the Humble Bundle to people that don't know any better.
4465048	4466048	It's really tacky.
4468485	4471027	I wouldn't just say tacky.
4471647	4475211	I would put it up in the realm of purely unethical.
4476132	4481116	We just have this faction of greedy people, which I'm not going to go into detail on that one.
4483418	4485280	But I think that it was...
4487281	4515412	what Dave Gilbert did that was who Bobby interviewed before I think that was purely necessary I think it was the right step to take under the situation and yeah there's people pissed off about it but look at it as the rotten apple spoiling the bunch you have a lot of bad apples spoiling all of it for everybody so if you want to be mad at anybody be mad at the people that were abusing the system not at the person who was the victim of the abuse
4517694	4518875	Steam can pull games from the library
4543975	4546779	But that doesn't stop you from linking your game with your Steam account.
4547099	4551023	You can still run everything through Steam if you want your functionality of Steam with your game.
4551384	4554528	How do you think I get all those pretty cutscene screencaps of Final Fantasy XIV?
4554548	4554608	So...
4557890	4564673	Alright, well let's travel around the world and check out some release dates that you can buy and then you can resell if you want.
4566073	4568735	Because it's a little more ethical when you actually bought it in the first place.
4569055	4571736	But anyway, let's travel around the world and check out release dates and what's coming out soon.
4572496	4576258	Alright, so this week we have Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures on 3DS.
4576738	4581560	Also the Castlevania Lords of Shadows Collection on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.

4586822	4612914	Call of Duty Ghosts on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 believe it or not the PlayStation 4 and Wii U and PC cause you know you gotta be cool and get those PlayStation 4 discs a week before they come out it's so weird to me, hey look I got this game I'm totally gonna not play it for a week so it's gonna take some getting used to that now we have to throw in PlayStation 4 releases into the mix but I guess this happened before with Wii U yeah

4653145	4654126	And the Game Stick.
4654266	4655507	I should know what I'm getting, Rob.
4655687	4656328	I know, right?
4656688	4657589	No, no, no, hold off.
4657609	4664675	You gotta wait for Hello Kitty Cruisers or whatever that was, you know, the Mario Kart-esque game.
4665655	4666536	Oh yeah, right, yeah.
4667076	4667677	That'll be fun.
4667697	4669459	That's a budget title, too.
4669479	4669799	20 bucks.
4669959	4670460	Heck yeah.
4670500	4673242	Well, Rob, I think you're worth at least 20 bucks.
4673482	4675444	All right, I'm covered for Hanukkah.
4676906	4677767	All right, let's move on.
4678307	4682731	Going to Japan, I would read PlayStation 4 dates, but remember, they're not getting theirs until next year.
4682751	4683512	Yeah, as well.
4683692	4686053	So we still have a little while before we start getting those dates in Japan.
4686753	4688854	But we can read what's going on on the PlayStation 3.
4689315	4704001	And coming out on November 7th, we have Akiba's Trip 2, Battlefield 4, Book of Spells, NBA 2K14, and Onichambara Z Kagura with No No No comes out.
4704842	4705742	And, oh, Rocksmith 2014.
4706442	4708884	X4 will be happy to hear that Rocksmith 2014 get exposed to Japan as well.
4708904	4710444	It's going to be big in Japan.
4710704	4710864	Huh?
4710884	4711945	It's going to be big in Japan.
4712265	4712927	Is it big in Japan?
4713329	4717281	I don't know how well those series, or how well music games are still doing in Japan.
4717522	4719688	Was Rock Band and those other games really selling in Japan?
4720091	4721651	Rock Band, I don't remember.
4722472	4723652	I think it did get a release.
4723672	4724552	It did get a release?
4724592	4724852	Yeah, yeah.
4724872	4726093	I don't know.
4726333	4733475	Well, regardless, if you happen to have a friend in Japan who wants to learn how to play the guitar, Rocksmith 2014 is out this week on November 7th.
4733555	4735916	Oh my God, you know what I'm suddenly thinking of in my mind?
4737376	4746579	Rock Band Visual K Edition, where it's all like Malice Miser and... I don't think they localized the music or anything when they put it out there, so...
4747339	4748140	I just think it would be fun.
4765662	4789794	Going to the PlayStation Vita Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Battle Destiny Gets a price reduction It's already out But there is a new game called X Tetra Comes out this week On the PlayStation Vita Going to the Wii U this week Nothing But you do get Call of Duty Ghosts next week Since we won't be here next week And Super Mario 3D World in a couple weeks I guess I'll be touching on that again when we come back
4790955	4803725	and on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Metal Max 4, Geku no Diva, Exetetra comes out there as well and there is a Monster Hunter 4 Hunter Pack limited console bundle out this week as well.
4804285	4812531	There's also another Tamagotchi game, Seishun no Dream School comes out on the 3DS this week and that does it for Japanese releases.
4812892	4814093	DarkSakura, how about the UK?
4815292	4832659	there's a few things in the UK on the 6th we have Call of Duty Ghost for practically everything and Castle Storm for the Sony consoles on the 7th is Wii Sports Club and the 8th is Mario and Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games the end
4833140	4833500	The end.
4834141	4837564	Bobby Blackwolf bringing some clarity in chat with Rock Band Japan.
4837865	4840948	Blackwolf says Rock Band Japan was a thing that failed in development.
4841228	4843130	They talked about it at their PAX East panel.
4843270	4845712	Licensing was a mess and they wound up giving up on it.
4846173	4852679	I thought they got some version of Rock Band in Japan, but maybe it's just, you know, maybe they got our version subtitled.
4852759	4854241	Yeah, licensing was probably a mess.
4855182	4863074	Maybe the import store that I see Japanese releases on, maybe they were kind of going the other way and helping Japan get the English version if they so wanted.
4863547	4864207	Thanks for watching!
4886852	4913347	but nope Ubisoft decided hey you know what we're gonna put a brand new online pass I'm sorry you play passport um that's gonna be part of Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag and then that you know not only will grant you access I guess to the online portions of the game but it also locks away the game's fleet management system that was part of the single player campaign
4914998	4915839	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4929474	4930834	Ubisoft decided, hey, you know what?
4931455	4932375	We're going to get rid of it.
4932635	4934816	And we're going to actually start now with Assassin's Creed 4.
4935436	4939497	So they went ahead and they're going to... I was giving them applause.
4940138	4942198	They're going to now have that code.
4942238	4955403	You still have to get the code for the Uplay Passport, but it'll be a free download that you just go to PlayStation Network or the Xbox Live Marketplace and you just download it.
4955703	4958284	And basically it allows you to do that for free.
4958824	4960645	and they're not going to have it in any future games.
4960825	4971548	It says the Uplay Passport was initiated as a means of giving customers full access and support for online multiplayer and features along with exclusive content, bonuses and rewards.
4972048	4978470	However, games today are blurring the lines between offline and online between single player and Wiz multiplayer.
4979130	4979810	Come on, man.
4979870	4981170	It was a single player campaign.
4981190	4982871	There's no blurring anything there.
4983831	5004118	and based on that and feedback we received we recognize that the passport is no longer the best approach maybe just because people are calling you out and you're fucking money grubbing you know tactics is what it is you know yeah it's not the approach so now we're just gonna have to microtransaction everything to be continued is basically what I the way I see it so um
5005834	5006915	Good on them, I guess.
5007035	5011358	Now we only have to get on Warner Games and Deep Silver.
5011758	5015641	I mean, seriously, what the fuck with Saints Row 4?
5016742	5019284	I thought we were done with that when THQ went out of business.
5020845	5024328	And if it's not Deep Silver, I'm going to blame Volition, those motherfuckers.
5025769	5030693	Here I thought it was THQ forcing them to hoard the DLC for that game.
5031293	5032134	Nope, it was them.
5032874	5033495	Blame the devs.
5035367	5047974	All right, well, before we get to the classic game of the week, this is, I don't know, words escape me, and I think a lot of us, again, here's another story this week where a lot of us kind of looked at this and went, like, how can this happen?
5048034	5049094	This is awful.
5050475	5057799	During this weekend, a lot of folks out there were participating in a charity fundraiser known as Extra Life, which is a video game fundraiser.
5057839	5060380	It's Gamers Doing Good, which is the stuff we like to report on.
5060420	5063042	It's raising money for the Children's Miracle Network Hospital.
5063682	5070310	Well, during the fundraiser, the website for Extra Life came under a DDoS attack, which is what?
5070350	5071271	Denial of Service?
5071872	5073153	Directed Denial of Service.
5073193	5080081	Directed Denial of Service attack, basically meaning a bunch of people hitting it all at once to try and take it down.
5080121	5084166	I think the first thought that comes with this is, well, was it just too popular and all these people were trying to hit it?
5084506	5084786	BlackWolf.com
5108159	5137278	Whatever, alright Anyway Whatever it stands for It's a pretty shitty thing to do to a charity organization Especially when it's gamers trying to do good And, you know, all these people were trying to donate And they couldn't through the site Because everybody that's doing the stream is trying to point people to the site And, you know, they couldn't make the donations So, you know, obviously there was a lot of pissed off people online About, like, how could somebody be so shitty to take down a charity And
5137638	5162666	and I have a couple schools of thought on this is that one there's shitty people out there period and you know just like we had an unfortunate horrible incident in the real world where a guy went and shot a guy at the airport and shut down LAX for a few hours like how could somebody be that shitty you know there are shitty people out there and we have to do whatever we can to you know stop these people whether that's through getting help or through you know whatever but
5163486	5175857	Um, I, I, I'm just curious what there is to gain from taking this down because I can't think there would be an internet organization out there that would be like, heck yeah, we screwed over all these sick kids.
5176257	5178319	Like who would want to take pride in that?
5178619	5179340	I'm not sure.
5180000	5181862	There are people who enjoy being assholes.
5182502	5182763	Yes.
5183023	5191410	And I, I think it could be, and I don't want to sound like too tinfoil hatty, but it could honestly be a cyber terrorist organization.
5193860	5197563	Or it could be someone who has a vested interest in making gamers look bad.
5197983	5199204	That sounds like a script kidding to me.
5200145	5210093	You think it was just one crazy person that went... I think it's some juvenile kid that's like... My other thought was that maybe they were trying to intercept the credit cards somehow.
5210674	5214437	Maybe, but I don't know how you... But I would think, you know, again...
5216178	5244800	I think this whole situation is shitty and I feel shitty for even going here but is it possible that somebody was after the credit card transactions and somebody wanted to get all these instant credit card numbers and things coming in in a very short amount of time people wanted access to that you wouldn't DDOS a site to do that though that would be like installing a Trojan or something or somehow getting access to their database or something DDOSing something is not going to really do anything as far as I'm aware
5245126	5247490	I don't think anyone's laughing.
5247510	5247570	No.
5262128	5272273	It's one thing when maybe they take down CNN.com or hack an LA Times article to say butts, butts, butts, butts or whatever they do.
5272413	5273493	That's hilarious.
5273993	5275074	That's one thing.
5275714	5281636	But charity organization raising money for sick kids, I don't think anybody's going to laugh at that.
5281656	5282837	That's just a special kind of dickery.
5283237	5283477	Yeah.
5284337	5288739	That's exactly the kind of... Well, the whole butts thing is an awesome dickery thing that you could do.
5288779	5292461	Just macro every single key on your keyboard to type butts when you type it.
5294141	5296822	BlackWolf says, I think the people who did it were laughing.
5297342	5306466	I think it's important to make sure that if they're laughing, which, again, what sick individuals would be laughing at this particular situation?
5306866	5311568	I think it's important that if, for whatever reason, we know these people, we hang out with these people, we talk to these people...
5312428	5326375	um that we let them know they're sick for laughing at this but if you if you endorse this or you laugh at it too then that's just encouraging it to happen and I think you need to kind of put your foot down and be like this is not okay
5327648	5328968	I think it was an attention grab.
5329788	5335329	I mean, seriously, the reason why people do asshole things like that is because they know it's going to rile someone up.
5335369	5336409	It's the worst kind of troll.
5337290	5341990	And it's why I don't give PETA any attention anymore.
5342491	5351072	It's why I hate bringing... I mean, yeah, it's a big thing and definitely needs to be spoken out against, but I also don't want to give these people the time of day.
5351172	5356373	I'd like to think that all of us and the people who listen to our show wouldn't hang around that kind of person.
5356553	5356793	Right.
5357313	5362016	So I definitely... That's why I'm not sitting here going, if you're the person that did this, you're an asshole.
5362036	5364278	Because I'm like, no, that person's not listening to this program.
5365058	5368261	But I would like to think that our listeners are decent people who have good taste.
5368381	5369001	Absolutely.
5369662	5375526	And definitely at least a higher level of ethics than these people do.
5377375	5379455	But it is a small world.
5379595	5380656	I learn that every day.
5380936	5386717	And even though you might not know somebody directly who is involved with this, you might know someone that knows someone.
5387437	5392698	So be that change and let people know it's not funny and it's not okay.
5393198	5394018	So anyway.
5395018	5395318	All right.
5396179	5396799	Let's move on.
5396839	5402240	Let's move on to happier things such as gaming history and the things that brought us to where we are today.
5403560	5412985	Every week here on the show, DarkSakura likes to take a step into the classic gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you kids out there, you should be playing this video game.
5413165	5413786	Yeah.
5413806	5416467	Stop learning how to put butts on the LA Times.
5416487	5417287	Yeah.
5417487	5418848	And play this classic game.
5419589	5421149	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
5421469	5424191	The classic game of the week is Shin Megami Tensei.
5424870	5426992	Ooh, you'll make a lot of friends with that choice.
5427132	5428493	Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
5428713	5444847	Plus, I have to say that as I have not spoken to my dear friend who is such a fan of this game, Catastrophic Magi, on Steam for a while, I dedicate this one to you because you were the one who introduced me to the series as in-depth as I know it now.
5446549	5460972	Shin Megami Tensei means True Goddess Reincarnation and I am referring to the first one that came out on October 30th 1992 for the Super Famicom and it is based off of Megami Tensei which is a novel and Famicom game.
5461972	5468734	This one is the first of the series at least in the Shin Megami Tensei series to be put out by Atlus.
5469774	5476717	Um, this one in particular starts off, um, it's a first person RPG.
5477237	5481079	So, in fact it actually is a lot like a, what was the series, Wizardry.
5481759	5490083	Um, so you go through different dungeons and you have up to six characters and it's turn based, um, uh, a field of vision.
5490103	5492484	So basically you walk up to the corner, you turn the corner.
5493404	5494825	You have two types of characters.
5494845	5496186	You have humans and demons.
5496906	5499068	And you have to collect demons like Pokemans.
5500389	5506672	So your human will acquire the demon by either negotiating, bribing, or coercion during a battle.
5507113	5515077	And then once you have them, you can store them in your computer and summon them for money to use in battle.
5515918	5519220	And they feed off of a secondary currency called magnetite.
5521002	5526123	So if your demon is defeated in battle, then they have to be revived.
5526143	5528924	So like I said, it's got that Pokemon element to it.
5530504	5542407	It has a method of controlling multiple demons by calling Akuma Gattai, which is demon fusion.
5542527	5549329	So you can basically use, you can combine your demons to be like this powerful gestalt.
5550309	5559775	You also have firearms, you have special ammo that goes with it, melee weapons, you have armor, you have only certain things that can be wielded by certain alignments.
5560175	5563618	And as far as your demons go, each of them have their own different statistics.
5563638	5565279	Like I said, it's kind of Pokemon-like.
5566219	5580212	um you have they all have permanent um abilities in this game that changes with the later two and they can't uh yeah be changed at all so um with this your your demons are um
5583109	5589731	are basically your tools for fighting in the game along with your regular armaments.
5589751	5591792	You have different types.
5592072	5595253	You have pixies.
5595473	5596673	You have angels.
5596833	5600654	You have all kinds of... You have ghouls.
5600674	5601655	You have all kinds of different ones.
5602135	5604836	So the alignment of your demons are two different types.
5604876	5605156	You have...
5607097	5610680	Light Neutral Dark and Law Neutral Chaos.
5611320	5614823	So basically it's kind of a D&D style alignment system.
5615283	5621488	So you can have True Neutral, you can have Chaotic Dark, which I guess would be like Chaotic Evil.
5621648	5623970	Law is associated with God, Order, and Peace.
5624651	5628113	Chaos is with the Devil and Freedom and War.
5628994	5632056	And then Balance is the Neutral one too.
5632256	5636320	So your human characters also have alignments as well.
5637080	5639241	Now, I'm not going to go too much into the stories.
5639301	5643062	Basically, it's demons on Earth, and they're changing the balance of power, and you have to stop them.
5644742	5648683	So you have your characters, you have your hero that you name yourself.
5650444	5658166	In sort of the game Apocrypha, there has been a name given of Kazuya in the Steven Report 1.
5660040	5664385	There is a heroine, which in that same thing she was given the name Yuka.
5664866	5674197	You have a law hero, a chaos hero, you have a girl named Yuriko, you have Steven, which is a disabled computer programmer who writes the demon summoning program.
5675545	5696642	Goto, Ozawa, and then you have just a bunch of characters in this game I'm not going to go into it but those are like the major characters it also was imported later on for the PC Engine Super CD-ROM and Mega CD and then re-released for PlayStation and Game Boy Advance to build hype for Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne
5697963	5699103	Fumitsu gave it a 30 out of 40.
5699143	5702825	The original version got a 36 out of 40 from Fumitsu.
5702845	5703426	There's also a manga spinoff.
5703446	5704226	It's out in English.
5714052	5733882	all kinds of stuff and of course we have so many different games now in the series that have come out in English that anyone can enjoy it but I do know for a fact that there's a translated ROM out of the first one so you can find it and play it through whatever means you deem necessary and that's it
5738698	5739579	and Shin Megami Tensei.
5762002	5779802	Alright, we're going to take a quick break here and when we come back there's plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come including the Fugle Question of the Week, some rapid fire news and your emails and your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR and yeah, all that's coming up when we come back after a quick break here at Orange Lounge Radio.
5786136	5795998	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this Sunday evening, November the 3rd, 2013 with episode number 526 of our show.
5796699	5803860	And we were talking a lot about kind of like this generation of gaming earlier on in the show because we're not going to be here next week.
5803920	5805521	So when we are back in two weeks...
5806428	5807689	PlayStation 4 will be out.
5807770	5810072	And then the week after that, the Xbox One will be out.
5810172	5817361	So we will be living in the next gaming generation and it'll be interesting to see what the reception is of those systems when they launch.
5817641	5819123	I'm surprised you didn't play my generation.
5819871	5821112	Oh, maybe at the end.
5821312	5821592	Maybe.
5822013	5822473	Maybe at the end.
5823514	5831839	Yeah, we always do little break songs here at the Voice of Geeks Network where we do tape live, of course, Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
5832079	5834801	And, you know, I hope some night you'll be able to check us out live.
5835622	5837163	I know we're up against The Walking Dead.
5837643	5865967	or some award show usually or whatever's going on but you know you could always TiVo those shows but I also know that some people just wait and download us on the podcast which is just fine too we appreciate all you guys that stop and check us out and I'll say this again at the end of the show but we do always appreciate any feedback you guys leave us helping us to spread the word about our show you know whether that be on iTunes like a nice five star review or you know liking us on Facebook and sharing the page or
5866327	5870650	I don't know if you guys know this, Stitcher now does the reviews and the star ratings.
5870830	5879475	Stitcher is a great app as well that's gotten a lot of people to be able to access our show without having to worry about downloading and syncing podcasts.
5879495	5881156	Stitcher is a great application.
5882717	5882997	Awesome.
5883678	5893184	Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom says, speaking of award shows tonight, Bobby Blackwolf says, you were up against the YouTube Music Awards, but apparently those were a big old bag of dicks.
5894625	5897047	Best Lyric of Our Generation, Chao Ma Ma Ma Main
5922146	5922346	Yes.
5923047	5928131	Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about South Park.
5928972	5931554	South Park, seriously, what's going on with you?
5932975	5937439	Delayed till March, unfortunately.
5939441	5943905	And I was so hoping that it would come out in December because there was nothing coming out in December, but
5945526	5950090	Yeah, and just because it's not done yet, really.
5950430	5952792	And they showed some gameplay, and I thought it was pretty cool.
5952993	5955215	Yeah, I'm very much looking forward to this game.
5955335	5958517	I'm a little disappointed about the delay, but, you know, get it right.
5958658	5959739	Take the time you need to get it right.
5959779	5960339	Don't rush it.
5960839	5961280	It's fine.
5961560	5965123	When the game comes out, finally, we'll all forget about the delay, so it inevitably happens.
5965784	5966865	Right, Grand Theft Auto fans?
5966885	5967105	Yeah.
5968826	5973328	Speaking of Grand Theft Auto V, 29 million fans have already forgiven it.
5974008	5978930	And it's already shipped to retail, but they pretty much sold.
5980011	5983412	And that means, and that's within six weeks.
5984973	5990735	So a couple more weeks, it will have outsold Grand Theft Auto IV's lifetime sales.
5991335	5993276	So that's not bad for six weeks.
5995020	6003463	And last but not least, something I'm kind of excited about, The Seventh Guest 3 is going to be a possible game that will be coming out.
6003983	6005224	Full motion video and all.
6005484	6010105	The Seventh Guest, if you're not aware, is a pretty old PC game.
6010145	6010986	It was a puzzle game.
6011366	6012126	And the 11th hour.
6012446	6014846	Yes, the 11th hour of the second game in the series.
6015687	6017067	They're trying to kickstart a third.
6017167	6018427	They're looking for $435,000.
6019467	6025989	Oh my god, is there a reward tier level where I can be in the game in one of those cheesy full motion videos?
6026049	6027649	Because that's kind of awesome if so.
6028789	6030729	If I had money, I would so want to do that.
6031550	6032010	I don't know.
6032410	6033070	Let me check.
6033170	6034870	They're at $39,000 right now and they have 35 days to go and
6039852	6045200	It would like literally be my dream to be one of those corny full motion video actors in one of these games.
6046462	6049686	Well, $1,000 gets your name on an object in the mansion.
6051088	6055275	$5,000, your name and likeness in a painting or photograph in the mansion.
6055888	6058611	You could be in the game, Rob.
6058791	6061334	It's not the same.
6061354	6061334	$7,500.
6062956	6066740	Scary animated portrait of you in the mansion and producer in-game credit.
6067941	6070604	And no, there is not a way to be an actual...
6073242	6079828	How can I campaign to be one of the cheesy full motion video actors in the game?
6080088	6092619	You would have to probably contact the creator and just give them lots of money and say, hey, can I forego all those things that be actually in the game as a character?
6092639	6093880	Nice.
6093900	6094160	Nice.
6095959	6096319	All right.
6097080	6097300	Yeah.
6097320	6102023	So if anybody behind that game and that Kickstarter is listening, we'd love to get you on for an interview.
6102123	6102683	Wink, wink.
6102763	6104484	Or maybe I can hassle you about being in the game.
6104544	6104985	Wink, wink.
6105145	6105405	All right.
6106386	6107406	I'll do it just as Frank.
6107886	6108767	All right.
6108827	6109127	No.
6109547	6109868	All right.
6110528	6111068	Moving on.
6111469	6116532	I'm being a little bit reductive here talking about something I already talked about earlier in the show, but I will mention.
6117032	6118233	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6136733	6138695	Doesn't Steam always have a Christmas sale?
6139035	6141477	Or, excuse me, a winter holiday sale or whatever at the end of the year?
6141897	6145119	Yeah, so, you know, if you really... It is almost Decemberween.
6145259	6148402	Yeah, if you really have to get it cheap, you have that to look forward to.
6149202	6152445	But honestly, it's still worth even $20 if you want to play it right now.
6153065	6153525	Good times.
6153806	6155187	And, yeah, there it is.
6155287	6156728	Typing of the Dead Overkill, it is out.
6157288	6163172	And I'll give a cheap plug for my YouTube channel one more time, Rob Roberts Plays, and you can watch me actually play the first hour or so of the game.
6164934	6172598	It has been announced that the male Wii Fit trainer will also be a playable character in Smash Brothers for Wii U and the 3DS.
6173398	6179321	Just like you have, I don't know, you kind of have like Zelda and Sheik are kind of the same, but not really, you know.
6180142	6181662	That's what they're kind of doing with the trainers.
6182043	6182683	Model swap.
6182923	6186445	Yeah, the male Wii Fit trainer is the exact same character as the female one.
6186485	6189026	It's just like a, it's a costume swap of sorts.
6189507	6191908	I am so looking forward to beating people up with Power of Yoga.
6192652	6197616	I think it would have been cooler if they just left the male trainer out.
6197856	6200919	I know they're just trying to pad the roster, but whatever.
6201279	6201660	Oh, neat.
6214850	6223353	And it would be kind of neat for those two versus two matches to like, you know, you could play Wii Fit Trainer versus Wii Fit Trainer, but you guys actually look different and it's not just a palette swap.
6223433	6225134	That's kind of neat for what it is.
6225874	6227735	But yeah, little news piece there.
6227915	6231297	And lastly, a follow-up to an interview we had a couple weeks ago.
6231337	6236579	You might remember that we had the guy behind Retro Magazine, that Kickstarter, was here on the show.
6236919	6238159	And he's with Game Gavel as well.
6238439	6239720	SoCal Mike was what he went by.
6240320	6264422	and he was trying to raise the money there for Retro Magazine and was having a little bit of a hard time getting coverage because apparently a lot of commercial websites won't run the story because it's competitive and I guess I didn't really realize this but it should be obvious that in these commercial for-profit blogs and things they literally have anti-competitive clauses they will not run a piece that could promote something that competes against it and
6264542	6265023	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6286903	6287403	Now hire me
6304728	6308649	They ended up with $75,000 altogether.
6309169	6313470	And I believe that was going to cover a couple of the stretch goals.
6314110	6315231	Dang, look at all these people here.
6315631	6318011	I'm trying to find it.
6318131	6324273	Oh, $62,000 was met, meaning everyone gets a collectible sticker with the first print issue and there will be an increased page count.
6324973	6325354	Yay!
6325414	6326154	Yay, hire me.
6327916	6328116	No.
6328436	6328717	All right.
6329077	6331379	Anyhow, yeah, so congrats to Retro Magazine.
6331399	6332740	I look forward to having my first issue.
6332780	6333401	I did back it.
6333601	6337665	I kicked back like $35 or so, just enough to get the year subscription to the magazine.
6337705	6343290	So I look forward to having that strewn on my kitchen table where we table LR very soon.
6343726	6346829	Along with Kid Icarus Rising and, uh, what's that pink thing?
6347189	6349211	Uh, what, this man bag of Alice?
6349391	6350532	No, no, I know what the man bag is.
6350592	6353815	Oh, this is a little game called Pink Hijinx that I got.
6353935	6356817	It was in my Gamer X loot bag that I just haven't played yet.
6356857	6358258	It's like this game involving little pink pyramids.
6358278	6361861	I thought it was a pink Tootsie Roll, I mean, Tootsie, uh, Hershey Kiss at first.
6361881	6363683	No, I would have eaten it if that was the case.
6363723	6364624	Mmm, chocolate.
6364664	6365304	Mmm, chocolate.
6365384	6367066	Alright, anyway, less chocolate, more news.
6368564	6369865	Well, we do have some news.
6369965	6373607	There was a hack into the Pokemans.
6374348	6380072	And there are two mega evolutions were released.
6381173	6383114	We have, let's see what they are.
6384735	6389478	It was released by Smilam, who created the first homebrew portal game for the DS.
6390019	6392901	So there is a mega evolution for Latios and Latias.
6395963	6397684	They are ugly.
6401894	6404438	I don't know what they're called, but they're kind of butt ugly.
6404738	6407462	So yeah, if you look online and find them, see if you care.
6408343	6413210	Also, there is an ESRB rating saying that Gradius V might be going to PS3.
6413851	6416875	Which, I freaking love me some Gradius V, but that game is some hard shit.
6417956	6419777	But that would be awesome.
6420317	6422758	There is a T for Teen rating on it.
6423418	6425019	So who knows?
6425639	6427000	I would like to see it there.
6427720	6432382	Maybe with some goodies, like maybe doing Gradius 2 as a throw-in, you know, because Gradius 2 is the best.
6433643	6435643	And then Steam has hit a milestone.
6436404	6438585	65 million active users.
6440425	6441486	That's a lot of people, Rob.
6441626	6442827	That's a country.
6443587	6444187	A small country.
6444947	6446128	Not a medium-sized country, I'd say.
6446567	6447147	That is a lot.
6447507	6447988	That's people.
6449068	6449968	Way to go, Steam.
6451169	6451809	Good job.
6453250	6453810	Congrats.
6453830	6454550	The winner is you.
6454770	6455251	Mazel tov.
6455571	6457752	Didn't they say that that's bigger than Xbox Live now?
6458012	6458192	Yeah.
6458412	6458972	Yeah, wow.
6459592	6459993	Very cool.
6460533	6462974	All right, let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week, ladies and gentlemen.
6470626	6474591	You take Facebook, you take Google+, you slam those words together, you get FOOGLE!
6474891	6487868	Which, by the way, I'm happy to announce, you can reach our Facebook page at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, but you can now reach our Google Plus page at google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.
6488208	6488769	Thanks for watching!
6505064	6506706	Do those things that Google users do.
6507807	6509348	And when I figure out what that is, I'll let you know.
6509368	6509889	Just kidding.
6510289	6512892	Alright, let's... You answer Fugle Questions of the Week.
6512932	6513472	That's what you do.
6513492	6521019	And this week's Fugle Question of the Week is probably similar to something we asked before, admittedly, when these systems were first announced.
6521139	6521359	But...
6522000	6526883	With us not having a show on 11.10, the next time we have a live show, the PlayStation 4 will be out.
6527003	6532266	So, this is the last unofficial poll to see what systems our listeners are getting this holiday season.
6532766	6547375	Are you or do you plan to buy before the end of the year a PlayStation 4, an Xbox One, a Wii U, a 3DS or a Vita, because you know that Zelda XL's got some people re-buying a 3DS or buying one for the first time, or something else or none of the above?
6547895	6548636	And why?
6548976	6550757	Did you ultimately decide the way you did?
6551378	6559543	I will try to read everybody's answers, but some of the longer ones I'm going to cut really short just for time's sake because we did get a lot of answers tonight and I don't want to go on forever.
6559583	6563826	So I hope you'll understand and read all the answers in their entirety at Facebook or Google+.
6564746	6567468	Redertainment says, due to project buy a house?
6568008	6568689	None of the above.
6570001	6594719	Soutour says none of the above because the PlayStation 3 and Gran Turismo 6 is enough for me for now Sam H says none of the above I have too many current gen games to go buy and play E3VL says already pre-ordered the PlayStation 4 since it's the cheaper console May purchase the Xbox One after it has a price drop to play the exclusives
6595832	6599454	Actdeft says, I plan on getting a Wii U and upgrading my PC.
6599934	6601035	Why do I want a Wii U?
6601435	6606378	I think there's enough games I would actually play, like Super Mario 3D World and Rayman Legends being the main ones.
6607038	6616023	And Cyberjudge says, I'd planned on purchasing a PlayStation 4, but with recent good and bad news I received, I'm no longer purchasing an next-gen console in the foreseeable future.
6616443	6617183	I do have a Vita.
6617243	6619845	I'll end up getting a PlayStation 4 when I am again able.
6620290	6625974	So that was about half nothing, half mixture of PlayStation 4 and Wii U, Xbox One a little later.
6626774	6627975	We got a lot of people on Facebook.
6627995	6628896	Let me try to get through these.
6629356	6634979	Andy R says, buying a PlayStation 4 at launch, mostly because it's new and shiny and I'm a consumer whore.
6636340	6637161	That's my reason too.
6637581	6638041	And hell.
6638402	6640503	KJ says, I pre-ordered a PlayStation 4.
6641163	6643705	The timing of the release of the console is my main reason.
6643845	6647427	I paid off the PlayStation 4 little by little, not in one lump sum.
6647948	6649709	Xbox One will have to wait for a price drop.
6651010	6665129	Renji2214 says I'm thinking of getting a Wii U for the holidays this year I haven't seen anything that interests me on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One and with Super Mario 3D World and Mario Kart 9 and the new Smash Brothers next year I think the Wii U has a little more that I'd be interested in
6666250	6669473	Uh, our old pal 23rd Magus, or what is it?
6669533	6670054	Drew Nami.
6670094	6670714	Drew Nami.
6671034	6674818	Drew Nami replied and said, I know better than to buy a system at launch.
6675038	6677800	Even the DS took a year before it had more than tech demos.
6678641	6686348	Uh, Extifer, our pal from Horde House, said we're getting a PlayStation 4, already have a Wii U, no Xbox One yet, no plans to get a 3DS or Vita.
6686928	6687869	LOL Uya.
6688770	6690632	He just threw that in there to kick them.
6691493	6708591	SSJ100Matt says other every year around or on Cyber Monday I spend money that I've saved towards upgrades to my PC I figure if I spend a little money every year I can keep my PC at near optimal settings this year I'm going to get a new graphics card a second monitor whatever's left over will go towards a device to help me stream games
6709719	6711860	Our friend Syl from Girls Gone Wow.
6711900	6712580	I love Syl.
6712780	6713561	I love you, Syl.
6713601	6714461	She was on this week's Courthouse.
6714481	6715061	And I love your hair.
6715141	6715842	It looks so cute.
6716142	6716722	She's amazing.
6717282	6719503	And you can hear them at Voice of Geeks Network.
6719603	6722824	Girls Gone Wow is on our network Wednesdays at 9 a.m.
6722884	6724545	Pacific, noon Eastern.
6724565	6726506	They're really early because in the UK it's 5.
6726986	6728186	I want Syl to kidnap me.
6729367	6729987	Not the other way around.
6730007	6730787	I want her to kidnap me.
6731947	6732407	Fair enough.
6733227	6736568	Anyhow, Syl says, I really want a PlayStation 4, but can't afford one now.
6736668	6739909	I'll wait until much later when they have newer versions and I can get it secondhand.
6740409	6744330	Or perhaps I should just livestream with more cleavage on display so I can get money.
6744750	6748011	But it's important to note she put a little angry face after that.
6748071	6750271	What do you call that line underscore line face?
6750311	6752112	Like the grrr face.
6753092	6754173	Xbox One hasn't impressed me so far.
6779116	6794866	Degenerate Johnny says 3DS because of Pokemon XY and I don't want to be pressured into getting the next gen I still have a pile of current gen games I haven't even touched yet when I finish this shrink wrap pile and I'm feeling comfortable moving forward I'll consider a next gen console until then I'd rather bask in the here and now
6796385	6811096	AZHP says none of the above my backlog of games is so huge that I honestly don't need a new system and none of the games are really drawing me my friend is lending me her 3DS so I can play Ace Attorney but other than that there's nothing I want to play badly enough to buy a system at this time
6811937	6817880	Burr says, I'm getting both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One because I have the money to get in on this console launch party madness.
6818380	6823883	I know it's not the most objectively smart thing to do, but I'm going to enjoy some enthusiasm for the next generation for now.
6824463	6826884	Well, you know, I think that's a good way of looking at it.
6826944	6830726	I know this is a lot to be spending, but I'm going to have fun with this.
6830766	6831786	So that's a good way of looking at it.
6832386	6834367	JV Monset also says, I'm getting both.
6834788	6838649	Though the PlayStation 4 had zero interesting games at launch, I believe it has potential in 2014.
6840370	6845636	CriticalMyth says I cancelled my PlayStation 4 pre-order and I'll be holding off on any new consoles until 2014.
6846818	6850802	I'm too backlogged on games for my PlayStation 3, Vita, and 360 as it is.
6851944	6853766	Doug T says I'm buying the PlayStation 4.
6854366	6855468	My preference is Sony.
6855788	6858972	I have massive PlayStation 2, 3, and Vita game libraries.
6859292	6860973	I don't trust their position with Xbox One.
6861013	6862314	They could change their stance again.
6873291	6876733	GamerGirl says, I'm not bothering to buy one until further down the road.
6876873	6880135	I enjoy my PlayStation 3 too much and the first batches always have glitches.
6880276	6880896	So I'm going to wait.
6881056	6887600	I don't even have a Wii U. DDRDollarBill says, none of the new systems because none have three must-have games for it.
6887680	6889041	A general rule I follow.
6889321	6889922	That's a good rule.
6891021	6892543	Hitstun says, screw all that.
6892783	6894164	I want a Retron 5.
6894725	6895906	I've got plenty of old games.
6895926	6896286	Those are great.
6896426	6900310	I still have to finish, and the Retron 5 makes them look nice over HDMI.
6900370	6902272	That's a very creative answer.
6903433	6906436	Rationator says, I'm a ways off before I buy an next-gen system.
6906476	6908418	I want to replace my PlayStation 3 first.
6908758	6910700	If I were to buy one, I'd lean towards a PlayStation 4.
6911641	6915003	FifthDream says, I have my PlayStation 4 pre-ordered with release day delivery.
6915323	6916543	Can't wait for it to arrive.
6916683	6917944	I've just always liked PlayStation.
6918304	6923387	I never got PlayStation 3 because I was required to have a 360 for a tech support job and never saw the reason to get both.
6924247	6926128	BloodDrunk says, none of the above.
6926488	6928829	Going for a good old-fashioned video card upgrade.
6928889	6929850	PC is where it's at.
6930737	6953699	and James S says I have my PlayStation 4 paid off and I'm ready to go as well as the special edition Zelda 3DS and I'm going to ask for a Vita for Christmas along with the new media molecule game Tearaway because that game looks good and the reason is because I'm simply just one giant man child well said considering I'm in a very similar position although I got to admit
6954724	6957006	I'm starting to waffle a little bit on the PlayStation 4.
6957046	6957947	I might cancel it.
6958907	6960869	Because a combination of things.
6960949	6966453	I think it's the three game rule that one of our listeners said in their response.
6967094	6971457	And just the fact that I would really be interested in upgrading my PC a little more.
6971878	6973899	And you start to kind of weigh what's more important.
6974260	6977702	PlayStation 4 or being able to do more stuff on your PC.
6978323	6981325	And if I look at where I really spend most of my time gaming, it's on the PC.
6981906	6982106	So...
6982586	6987230	Dan and I have had a similar discussion because I'm really working on trying to up my own design stuff.
6988351	6990513	And I need a computer that's going to handle it better.
6990573	6993595	Plus, I mean, I play on the PC more than anything anyway.
6994356	7000381	Just don't be surprised if you guys come back in two weeks on the show and hear that I canceled my pre-order because it's something I'm strongly leaning towards right now.
7000621	7003003	Like, it's likely going to happen.
7003203	7005625	Keep in mind, buying a game at launch is not usually a good idea.
7006175	7006355	Yeah.
7007716	7007976	All right.
7008537	7009157	System, I should say.
7009177	7009977	So that's interesting.
7010178	7020925	None of us are, assuming I cancel my PlayStation 4, which is the likely case at this point, but y'all, I said on this show right up until the day it came out, I'm not getting a Wii U. I'm not getting a Wii U. And then, of course, what happened about a Wii U?
7022005	7024387	None of us will own an X-Gen system except my Wii U.
7025802	7027722	That doesn't count.
7027742	7029683	The Wii U is not a next-gen system.
7029743	7030403	I'm sorry.
7030443	7038965	It could be like a separate parallel dimension system, but it's not a next-generation system.
7039025	7041846	Regardless of where you place it or how you feel about it.
7041946	7049768	Does this mean we have to stop doing a video game podcast because we're not gaming enough to be on the cutting edge in the new generation?
7049848	7050008	No.
7051048	7051168	No.
7051744	7054926	No, I also obviously, obviously I agree with you.
7055347	7056627	I just think it's the realistic position.
7056667	7057148	I have a PC.
7057248	7058269	I can run games.
7058589	7059509	I have a PC.
7059770	7067815	At least a third to half of those answers were people saying, nope, not right now, or getting systems that are like 3DSs and Vitas and things that are already out there.
7067935	7071358	Well, and Dan and I already said we're going to wait until there's more stuff out for it that we want.
7071418	7077602	We're sitting on a $100 gift card that we're going to put to our, we've decided it's going to our PS4.
7078102	7079163	We're just not getting it yet.
7079463	7079603	Right.
7079643	7084327	Besides, I want to make sure there's no shapes or lights of death on anything that I'm planning on purchasing.
7084688	7088451	I probably, if I get a PlayStation 4 this year, it's going to be because I got it for free.
7088851	7089952	I'm not actually going to buy one.
7090213	7095017	I'll want to get one before February of next year when Final Fantasy XIV starts on PlayStation 4.
7095517	7099141	But, you know, by then I'll have a tax refund I can spend on it, too.
7099441	7101182	So it's something I have to put in perspective.
7101603	7101783	Yeah.
7102043	7112667	Keep in mind, guys, I know we've been doing this podcast a long time, and some of you have stuck by us a very long time, and I really, really appreciate that, but the reality is we don't make our lives off this show, and people ain't giving us free shit all the time.
7113228	7123372	Once in a great while, we are extremely lucky to get a review copy of a game from an independent studio or something, but the reality is it's not like they're shipping us free consoles and things like that.
7123432	7126753	So just like you have to think about, do I have the money to spend on this console?
7126773	7129274	We have to ask ourselves the same question, and sometimes the answer is,
7129734	7133898	No, I'd rather spend the money on a ticket to Atlanta so I can go to DragonCon next year.
7133978	7134579	You know, type of thing.
7134979	7135860	Or whatever it is.
7137582	7137922	Alright.
7139043	7140144	Anyhow, moving on.
7140585	7146591	Let's get into some more news and then we'll get to our phone calls pretty soon here at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7146671	7148693	You can yell at me for changing my mind if you want.
7149053	7149774	Although I'm not, again...
7150094	7150234	MindCon
7174302	7184646	Apparently, if you have the PC or Mac version of it, you will be able to soon stream to Twitch straight from the game.
7185406	7193889	And you'll be able to link your Twitch TV account to the actual game and it'll allow you to stream, I guess, natively.
7195529	7196730	Which I think is kind of interesting.
7197650	7206057	and of course, I guess you'll be able to do it on the Xbox One as well because I think they're going to have Twitch integration, but that's kind of something separate.
7206558	7213984	Speaking of the Xbox, there is some new DLC coming and yet another reskin of the game.
7214724	7218146	much like the Mass Effect Minecraft mod that they had.
7218546	7222208	Now they have the Elder Scrolls Skyrim texture set.
7222448	7227591	It comes with 40 character skins, themed menus, user interface, and craftable items.
7228091	7230152	Also 20 songs from Skyrim as well.
7230792	7241798	And the best part about it is it comes with a pre-made map that I guess recreates areas of Bleak Falls Barrow, Whiterun, and Riverwood.
7242138	7243599	So that's pretty sweet.
7244724	7245525	That is pretty neat.
7247809	7252235	I need to check out some of these themed DLCs they have going on on Xbox because I know they have the Mass Effect one.
7252275	7254919	I never checked that out, but the Skyrim one sounds cute too.
7255259	7257723	Yeah, so I think it's pretty sweet.
7261113	7288561	at some point I need to go back to Minecraft but I just I'm too busy with Grand Theft Auto alright moving on to information about Wii Sports Club remember Wii Sports Club this is the thing they're doing on Wii U that's kind of the reinvention of what many were saying were the game of last generation Wii Sports and I had no idea about this but there was a article they run called Owada Asks that was talking about the release of Wii Sports Club and he said quote
7290061	7301523	I'm sorry, actually this is not Iwata that said this, but this is developers behind the game, Kozo Makino and Takayuki Shimamura said about Namco Bandai being involved in the development of this.
7301543	7302623	I had no idea they were involved.
7303564	7311125	But Makino says, we asked Namco Bandai Studios to develop it, so I first participated as a coordinator, but in the end I got into just about anything.
7311525	7316506	I mainly worked on the network aspect of the game, but at times I made suggestions on how some features should turn out to be.
7317186	7323570	And Shimomura says, from the middle of development, Makino-san and Suzuki-san were also working as full-fledged planners.
7323911	7334858	We did ask Namco Bandai Studio to develop the game this time, but staff in Nintendo's Network Development and Operations Department, the Software Planning and Development Department that those two are in, and EAD also chipped in.
7334918	7338160	So that's kind of neat that Namco Bandai is involved.
7338420	7340521	Confirmed, Pac-Man a playable character.
7340741	7341262	No, I'm just kidding.
7341282	7341982	That's not confirmed.
7342082	7346305	I'm a little disappointed that Nintendo chipped in on the network portion of it.
7346625	7347246	Don't worry, Rob.
7371303	7372044	Rob, don't worry.
7372184	7374226	This is plan B. You do understand.
7374246	7380412	This is plan B because remember, this holiday, they do have a brand new Wii U SKU that has the new Super Mario Bros.
7380653	7384236	U and new Luigi U as well.
7384637	7394026	If that fucking fails and can't sell the game system, you better believe they are going to include this with the next SKU that comes out to try to drive sales.
7394106	7394487	Oh, I'm sure.
7395508	7398832	and they just dropped the price in Nintendo Land pretty heavy too, right?
7398852	7401255	Didn't they drop that down to 29 bucks this week, I think happened too?
7401796	7402757	Or it's coming up very soon?
7402777	7410568	Yeah, well, if it's not the packing game anymore too, you know, it's gotta, you know, getting its price dropped would really help it sell.
7412049	7413690	One other interesting note.
7414291	7421237	You may not want to read too much into this, but there's a Wii U exclusive trailer that Nintendo has.
7422077	7425981	It's for the 2013 and 2014 lineup that shows Wii U exclusives.
7426481	7428923	Bayonetta 2 was in the trailer at one time.
7429544	7430424	It's not there now.
7431465	7434608	Some people are reading into this that, uh-oh, it slipped to 2015.
7436349	7437650	I don't know.
7437770	7443511	I think people might be reading a bit too much, especially the people that are saying, oh, well, this means it's no longer exclusive.
7444011	7449233	No, they've said many times this game would not be happening if it wasn't for Nintendo, and it's going to be exclusive.
7449733	7450894	So, yeah.
7451554	7456415	But it could just be that there's nothing new to show.
7457156	7459056	You know, they want to keep the game a secret.
7459136	7459436	I don't know.
7459456	7463338	But it honestly wouldn't surprise me whatsoever if it's going to be pushed back all the way to 2015.
7464058	7464598	Wouldn't surprise me.
7466374	7469795	I hope they have a strong enough 2014 lineup to keep selling Wii U's.
7471175	7472516	I'm sure they've got something under their hat.
7472556	7474396	Maybe the Zelda game will be this year.
7474416	7475616	It'll probably be this year.
7475656	7477757	Yeah, maybe the Zelda game will come out sooner than we think.
7478857	7480438	I'm still thinking holiday next year.
7480578	7481618	I don't think it's going to be any sooner than that.
7481638	7484739	I'm pretty sure it's all hands on deck for Zelda Wii U, but we'll see.
7485659	7487240	Anyway, let's move on.
7487320	7487800	DarkSakura.
7488780	7492321	Well, in other news, we do have...
7494079	7494940	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7509355	7510416	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7536115	7539540	It's always fun to hear about new games coming out for old consoles.
7539700	7541082	There's still love out there for it.
7541162	7543405	I love when people do Dreamcast games.
7543425	7543925	Yeah, right?
7544486	7545648	I want some of them still.
7546895	7554062	Actdeft in our chatroom reminds me of a very obvious Nintendo game I should have remembered for 2014, Smash Bros.
7554322	7556004	I'm sure that's a given for next year too.
7556024	7557405	I think that'll finally be done.
7557505	7557966	That'll be good.
7558326	7559047	And Mario Kart 8.
7559688	7560569	Yeah, there's Mario Kart 8.
7560929	7565994	Wasn't there a rumor that it is, I think the date was out there, April 25th, I want to say?
7566274	7568397	Granted, that was a UK date, if I'm not mistaken.
7568997	7571138	But isn't that later than it was originally said?
7571678	7575739	And remember I said when Donkey Kong got delayed, it could have been a sign that Mario Kart was delayed too?
7575859	7580220	I think they have a... They're probably going to try to make sure they have a release every month.
7580280	7582441	So they've got Donkey Kong in February.
7583041	7592404	There's still no real date for... I mean, say if Wii Fit U, they have the meter out for that, but they don't actually have a physical bundle for it yet that's been announced.
7592884	7595764	Unless that's December, because there's really nothing in December.
7596125	7597385	Gran Turismo, it's your month!
7598385	7599806	Oh yeah, don't forget Wii U owners.
7599846	7601707	If you have a balance board, Wii Fit U is out.
7602428	7602628	Yeah.
7603628	7604969	I should check that out at some point.
7605109	7609412	And if you have a balance board, you already pretty much have Wii Fit U. I mean, it's only a little bit different.
7610732	7611673	You have to buy a meter, though.
7611933	7613654	So make sure you get your Fit Meter thing.
7614595	7617496	I'm trying to think what else there was.
7618017	7618557	Smash Bros.
7618597	7619197	and Mario Kart.
7619317	7620658	I mean, those are supposed to be at some point.
7620758	7621158	And then...
7623981	7649909	has a tendency though to kind of surprise us with little things you know and they're doing their own thing now with these Nintendo Directs they they're not adhering to any schedule for release of news I mean granted they'll save some of their biggest stuff for E3 week but I wouldn't be surprised if they don't do a press conference again next year and do what they did this year so anyway let's move on with some other news all right Loki Final Fantasy 14 doing pretty well now that they rebooted has it gone up a level
7650663	7654565	Yes, I'd say 1.5 million registered accounts.
7655905	7656745	That's not bad.
7656805	7659787	I'd say that's worth the reboot.
7659967	7663728	DarkSakura's doing the Final Fantasy 1 victory animation with the hands up and down.
7664308	7667489	You know what just went into my head was the Brental Floss thing.
7667550	7669430	You just got pwned, FTW.
7672272	7685742	so yeah that's cool and definitely I think it'll be neat when the PlayStation they say the PlayStation 4 beta version is planned to launch I guess the same day as the Japanese PlayStation 4 so February yep cool very cool
7686621	7691802	Yeah, we just heard not that long ago there was a million Final Fantasy XIV, so it's going up in subscribers.
7692842	7702244	That's going to make this year's BlizzCon very interesting because this MMO, Final Fantasy XIV, has still got some steam behind it.
7702284	7710046	Now, granted, you had Star Wars and you had Rift and some of these other ones too, but Blizzard, I wonder if they're starting to feel the pressure this year.
7710106	7713947	There's a lot of pressure to make or break World of Warcraft this year.
7714747	7715007	DarkSakura,
7738974	7739535	Good luck.
7739835	7743817	That's just going to be hard to do anyways, even if it was an excellent game.
7743937	7746918	I don't think anyone really cares.
7747238	7747878	Same with WoW.
7748719	7754161	There's a lot of other things competing for attention out there in the MMO space.
7755182	7759764	They have to do something to really interest people in playing it.
7759804	7761965	I just don't think they're really doing that a lot anymore.
7763280	7765301	Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2 Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2
7787688	7788228	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7812205	7813507	Dragon Quest X Dragon Quest X
7831795	7848958	and so a lot of people are like oh well if Reggie wants it you know he can he can make that happen so I don't know if he solely can make that happen but I'd be a fan of seeing some of these remakes come out over here I'm very curious about Dragon Quest X I'm kind of sad that just didn't happen so
7850063	7850543	Who knows?
7851064	7856027	By the way, this is the stuff now that Operation Rainfall and that whole group has their eyes on.
7856047	7859149	Because they've got nothing left on their original three.
7859189	7859889	They all came out.
7859909	7860570	They got their way.
7861030	7862611	So now they're hoping to get this as well.
7863031	7864072	So, good luck.
7864912	7866974	Hope Nintendo listens to you guys because I'd like to see it.
7867654	7880321	Well, speaking of listening to you guys, every week you guys can email us at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura, she dives into the mailbag and picks out an email or two to read for you guys here on the show.
7880401	7881902	Or if it's like last week, there'll be five emails.
7882062	7886144	No, it's just one and I had to use my radioactive gloves to slip through the Mandarin text.
7887605	7888905	Yes, we're still getting the spam.
7890734	7893096	All right, so we've got one email tonight.
7893116	7893236	One.
7893416	7894117	All right, well, what is it?
7894177	7898181	With Twitter links, and I'm just going to go ahead and read this.
7898721	7899482	Hi, OLR.
7900062	7908530	In light of Nintendo's recent closure of Swapnote, I'd like to bring to your attention some funny as hell comments made by Sony Computer Entertainment Prez, Shuhei Yoshida.
7909111	7909531	Enjoy.
7910151	7912834	And the first one says... Do you want me to read these?
7912854	7913895	Because I know you're on your iPad.
7913915	7915977	Sure.
7915997	7916197	Sure.
7916860	7929123	Okay, the first one is a reply to somebody saying, oh, okay, Yoshida says, thanks for the feedback to the lack of MP3 and DLNA supported the launch of PS4.
7929484	7932144	I'll share with the PS4 dev team for future consideration.
7932464	7937126	And somebody replied to that, I need to listen to porn whilst playing Battlefield.
7937726	7939866	And Yoshida replied to that, I know.
7940267	7940587	Okay.
7943920	7955964	And then there was another tweet where somebody tweeted at him, Hey, I want to know why my dick got caught in my PlayStation 3's disc tray when I tried to play Killzone Shadowfall on my PlayStation 3.
7956744	7957564	It really hurts.
7958044	7960445	And yes, I tried turning it on and off again.
7960885	7962786	Yoshida replied, Shut up.
7965194	7970117	To which the original guy replied, K. That's cute.
7972079	7978103	Also, please pardon me for a brief Orange Lounge Foodio tangent, but do you guys have a Del Taco in the area?
7978283	7980444	Yes, we have plenty of them.
7980464	7986248	There's literally one up the street from OLR Studios, and you better bet I go there all the time.
7986328	7989770	They have some great chicken tacos, and this is true.
7990391	7992372	Signed, The Nasty Canasta.
7992852	7993893	One of my favorite handles.
7994414	7996816	It always makes me think of strip poker, but it's Nasty Canasta.
7996836	7998757	It's the Nasty Canasta.
7999278	8000999	Nasty Canasta does need a theme song, huh?
8002060	8011569	Yeah, I need to... It should be like... It should be like, I don't know... Like something set to a Burt Bacharach song or something.
8011649	8015472	Well, Nasty Canasta kind of makes me think like Copacabana, which makes me think of those.
8015492	8019896	So I don't know, when I go... Because we love to use Bomani songs for things, so I kind of think of this song.
8023021	8024502	That's the Nasty Canasta song now.
8028925	8036169	You're not sponsored by Del Taco.
8036189	8037510	We're sponsored by Pinkberry.
8037870	8038451	I wish.
8038551	8039951	I wish we had official sponsorship.
8039971	8040772	I want sugar-free Pinkberry.
8040792	8044374	They had a new app come out this week, but I'm not going to plug it because they don't sponsor us.
8045035	8045855	Hey, Pinkberry.
8046415	8047616	Free samples over here.
8049197	8049517	All right.
8049577	8052039	Even though I cannot partake of your deliciousness for a while.
8053144	8053464	Okay.
8054305	8054745	There you go.
8054765	8055446	So that was our email.
8055486	8057187	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
8057227	8059189	You guys didn't make DarkSakura work very hard this week.
8059289	8061871	Actdeft, why it's all taco and not of taco?
8063933	8066695	Because, you know, Americans gotta be stupid.
8068797	8069057	So.
8070218	8070538	All right.
8071719	8073340	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
8073661	8075422	And you have a week.
8075482	8076823	You have an extra week this week.
8077324	8080626	And you had an extra hour last night to really fill up that mailbag.
8080866	8081527	I'm going to sleep.
8082079	8083140	What, during the show next week?
8084081	8084522	Yeah.
8084942	8085062	Oh.
8085443	8086424	Because we're not having one.
8086444	8086984	That's right.
8087265	8087985	I'm going to sleep.
8089147	8089427	All right.
8090068	8091750	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
8091970	8095173	Because before we can sleep, we have to get all the angst out of our system.
8095293	8096555	So we'll do the FUs of the week.
8113710	8121016	FU to my state of unemployment and not hearing back on the one I really wanted to hear back on at all.
8124598	8130863	Yeah, this is an FU to that and also being sore from the gym because I want to go back tomorrow.
8132144	8137068	And Tom Nook because he's an ass.
8138289	8138489	Loki?
8141070	8144293	I guess, after the fact, I guess I have to have my wisdom teeth out.
8144653	8145414	So that's going to be fun.
8146055	8146635	Oh god, that's right.
8146655	8147897	Are you going to miss a show because of that?
8148217	8148837	Or you don't know yet?
8150019	8152541	I hope your situation isn't like mine was.
8152561	8155324	Because you remember my wisdom teeth coming out, don't you?
8155364	8156625	Yeah, yeah.
8156645	8158767	I got mine out when I was a teenager, so it's no big deal.
8159007	8162671	I've got pictures of it where I look like I've been in a prize fight for three months.
8162731	8163131	Gross.
8164212	8164933	I hope yours is better.
8166825	8167926	I win as the what lady?
8167966	8168746	I win as the what lady?
8186312	8186432	What?
8186452	8188975	Where were some of the other costumes there?
8188995	8189175	Uh...
8201489	8206591	Alan and somebody else ended up as the ridiculously hot photogenic runner guy.
8206831	8209072	So it was really funny that they duplicated the costume.
8209092	8209733	That was really funny.
8211473	8215295	Slagkick from Game Buoy was doing funeral selfies.
8216155	8217296	He was doing selfies at funerals.
8217536	8221217	So of course he walked over to me and took a picture of me and put hashtag this bitch soon.
8223484	8226906	By the way, I have to tell you, a trick-or-treater did come to my door dressed as an internet meme.
8227486	8227866	Oh, yeah?
8228066	8231168	He was wearing one of the Rage Comics shirts, wearing a horse head.
8232248	8233049	He was an internet meme.
8233369	8234089	Nice, nice.
8234409	8246235	Well, and the other one, I would say Captain Spike, also from Gamebuoy.org, he wore this gray hoodie, but he had it stuffed with pillows so he was round, and he had a little Barbie doll swinging on a chain.
8246715	8247676	He was the wrecking ball.
8249297	8250477	Get it?
8250497	8250858	Get it?
8251278	8251978	I thought it was funny.
8252599	8256341	And he kept saying all night how comfortable he was because he had the built-in pillows and I was laughing.
8257202	8258903	There you go.
8258983	8260344	Grandpa did not dress up.
8261024	8270651	So he said something really, as Grandpa tends to do if you've ever listened to Horde House, he said something really unpolitically correct later on in the evening, so he said he was a YouTube commenter.
8271411	8272391	So that's that.
8272671	8280013	So anyway, I don't remember why I was telling that story, but oh yes, because we got tacos last night while I had been drinking.
8280093	8284715	And I'll tell you what, there is no better food when you've been drinking than tacos.
8285855	8287135	Unless they come from Jack in the Box.
8287416	8291277	F you to the fact that I'm too fat and need to eat less tacos.
8293397	8294558	You should try some of that vodka.
8294578	8298259	Oh yeah, I was supposed to have some of that at the start of Part B, huh?
8298979	8299219	Well...
8300305	8300785	We'll see.
8301026	8301546	Rab.
8302106	8302907	Rab vodka.
8303127	8306869	Maybe I'll do a shot for each call we get tonight to try to entice you.
8306889	8308110	Everyone call.
8310032	8312093	Do I have to mix it with anything or do I just take it as shots?
8314127	8314927	It's already mixed.
8315047	8315808	It's infused with juice.
8315988	8316188	Nice.
8316408	8316648	All right.
8317388	8321769	Let's go to a couple more stories, and then we'll open up the phones and take some calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8322430	8322670	Loki.
8322850	8327011	So Sony has now announced a new Sony Rewards plan.
8327071	8333653	Apparently it allows you to earn points for money that you spend on the PlayStation Store.
8334854	8351684	for every dollar spent you earn one point and each of those points equals up to be about one penny versus you know towards something else so for example if you want to get a brand new playstation 3 game or playstation 4 game for $59.99 it's going to cost you $5,999 um
8357648	8362672	Granted, there are other ways you can earn money, or points I should say, in there.
8363252	8385528	Not just with purchasing stuff, but you can also, I think they have money spent on, for every dollar you spend on the Sony store, every dollar you spend on the PlayStation store, when you upload your ticket stubs for Sony Pictures movies, and also registered DVDs and Blu-ray discs,
8386208	8388129	They're also going to have promotions through retail partners.
8388269	8391250	Also, if you sign up for offers, you earn 100 points.
8391751	8394992	Buy a PS3 bundle, you earn up to 270 points.
8396833	8399234	For movie tickets, you earn up to 400 points.
8399654	8406937	I'm not sure if that's per ticket or whatever, but right there, that's a good way there.
8408558	8413059	Basically, for every 1,000 points, you earn a $10 PlayStation Store code.
8416118	8420461	and then 250 points for buying the year of PlayStation Plus.
8421041	8433228	So yeah, lots of ways to earn points and they have rewards including, you know, not just games and stuff but you can also get Sony products and they have like other things, digital downloads, music, you know, movie tickets.
8434449	8436369	VIP experiences, they say.
8436389	8436829	Oh, yay.
8437110	8439370	So, you know, prostitutes, I guess.
8439950	8441170	That's what I'm led to believe in.
8441190	8442210	Pole dances.
8442231	8442691	Good times.
8444111	8446711	Hunting human beings, you know, that kind of stuff.
8447111	8447391	Awesome.
8448252	8448592	All right.
8449092	8452332	Hey, this is a new story about a free game, so listen up.
8453393	8455913	This is a game that came out on the Super Nintendo in the mid-90s.
8455953	8457273	It's called Blackthorn.
8457653	8458394	Oh, God, that game.
8458414	8459194	Do you remember this game?
8459254	8459734	Yes, I do.
8459754	8460614	I have that game.
8460754	8461835	Blackthorn is one of them.
8461875	8466497	And what's interesting is if you have a Battle.net account, you can go get Blackthorn from Blizzard for free.
8481425	8481765	That's it.
8481865	8483407	Once you've downloaded the game, it's yours to keep.
8483707	8484427	It's a free game.
8484988	8493014	I'm going to speculate here it's to try and get more people on their Battle.net downloader because if they can give away, you know, this, you know, they're not making any money off this anymore.
8493034	8494135	You mean all that crap I uninstalled?
8494335	8508006	Well, but if you were to go download the Battle.net downloader so you can get Blackthorn, then hey, how easy is it to get a Hearthstone on your computer when that comes out, which is probably this week during BlizzCon, and how easy is it to get a StarCraft downloader
8508066	8509347	Check that out at battle.net
8532383	8534625	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8552200	8556922	The vodka is actually actual potato vodka that I filtered myself.
8557762	8565344	And this one has, I believe, plum, nectarine, and a couple of other fruits in it.
8565384	8565824	I don't remember.
8565844	8566585	I made it a while back.
8566625	8567345	So it's pretty potent.
8567685	8595759	Nice, alright, so the sky plane's open, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio And I will do a shot for each call that we get tonight Everyone call You can't just call in and say, I'm only calling because I want you to do a shot You have to tell us something We've had a lot of topics tonight, including the games of the generation and so forth So there's plenty to discuss And I have my shot glass here, I have a tall shot glass Alan collects shot glasses, and I just happened to grab this one, it says Canada on it So I guess, shout out It will be a polite shot

8597100	8598041	It will be a very polite shot.
8598361	8601023	Shout out to all our Canadian listeners up north.
8601183	8604886	I know at least one of the guys from Video Game Realness.

8606166	8606807	They're in Toronto.
8606847	8608568	I know at least one of them listens pretty regularly.
8609129	8612571	And Alan, wait, since you're walking by, where's this shot glass from?
8612591	8613492	Is this when you went to Toronto?

8636954	8638696	Oh no, the phone line's not lighting up.
8638716	8640637	It's going to be a sober night tonight.
8641138	8641898	Call.
8642039	8643480	Let's have some new voices.
8643660	8645762	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
8645802	8646743	We're talking about food.
8647163	8648004	Are they talking about food?
8648024	8650446	We're talking about restaurant chains and where they are in the country.
8651640	8654342	I noticed somebody said Rax Roast Beef earlier.
8654362	8656124	I was like, oh my god, that's a blast from the past.
8656324	8660367	You know what was a big blast for me that I don't have anymore was Kenny Rogers Roasters.
8661147	8661868	That's a thing?
8662308	8664490	Yeah, it's basically like Boston Market.
8665190	8666411	It's almost exactly the same.
8666451	8668713	So in Boston Market, I was like, oh, that's neat.
8669053	8669694	That is awesome.
8669734	8672276	All right, we are starting to get some calls here, so let's go to it.
8672536	8673436	Hi, you're on Orange Science Radio.
8673456	8673837	Who's this?
8674617	8675678	Hey, this is TechQ.
8675998	8676939	Hey, TechQ?
8677019	8677419	TechQ?
8678550	8678810	Yes.
8679050	8680271	What is on your mind, TechQ?
8680351	8682952	Oh, wait, first, before I get to what's on your mind, let me hold on.
8683012	8684353	Oh, God, this bottle's hard to open.
8684373	8684613	Hold on.
8687514	8688274	Did everyone hear that?
8688855	8691856	Will you talk to TechQ for me, DarkSakura, while I pour a shot here?
8691956	8693877	Rob is pouring himself some pink liquor.
8694097	8696398	So what do you have to talk about tonight?
8697338	8704162	I wanted to comment about the News of the Generation that you did earlier.
8704762	8706863	Y'all forgot to mention the Red Ring.
8708165	8709585	360.
8708505	8709585	Yeah, there was the red ring.
8711326	8713826	Oh, yeah, the 360 red ring.
8714526	8715686	Mm-hmm.
8715846	8721667	Why do you... I mean, obviously, I can answer this too, but why do you feel this was a defining moment of the generation?
8722788	8736030	I think it affected, like, 90% of all 360s that were sold up to a point until they finally admitted that it was shoddy...
8737560	8742966	Hardware that they sold I would hope they would They wouldn't get my money
8758196	8760897	if I were going to get an X-Bone.
8762298	8764319	What are your thoughts on the upcoming generation?
8764379	8766359	I know we had the Fugo question of the week earlier.
8766719	8768560	Are you jumping in on any of these new consoles?
8768600	8770081	Are you taking a wait-and-see approach or what?
8771401	8775843	Since I traded in my 360, why not get a PS4 cheap?
8776503	8780105	But that is interesting that you traded in the Microsoft console to get the Sony console.
8780225	8781865	What weighed in on that decision?
8781925	8783506	Was that just about price or what?
8784501	8811421	um it's basically before they did the 180 mantra back in before in July I was just disgusted with them on their policy especially on the the used game DRM crap that they try to pull so it was probably one of those things where by the time they reversed course it was too late you'd pre-ordered your PS4 right yeah yeah makes sense all right well uh Tech Q anything else you want to share with us tonight
8812557	8813337	Don't get too drunk.
8813357	8814297	Don't get too drunk.
8840104	8841485	It has yumminess in it, I'll tell you that.
8841505	8844287	But we've got, surprise, surprise, now we're getting tons of calls.
8844307	8845507	We've got another call coming in.
8845547	8846468	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8846488	8846868	Who's this?
8847488	8850470	This is Ranma, and I am going to do a shot with you.
8850690	8851290	Fuck yes.
8851370	8853311	Alright, DarkSakura's my bartender right now.
8853351	8854412	She's pouring me a shot.
8854912	8855833	She's such a good friend.
8855873	8858854	She not only makes me the liquor, but then she pours it out for me.
8858894	8860015	That's a true friend right there.
8860375	8861256	Yes, yes, indeed.
8861376	8863457	I have my whipped cream vodka right here.
8863717	8867579	When I'm old and in a wheelchair, she'll be switching out my IV bag with liquor.
8868140	8870742	Alright, here we go, I got the shot, you ready buddy?
8871282	8880849	Shit, I just took a shot, let me do another one, okay, whenever you're ready Alright, let me know when you're ready Ready One, two, three Down in one
8882628	8882828	Good times.
8882848	8883890	Does it burn nicely?
8884610	8884891	That's good.
8884951	8885872	I left a drop in the glass.
8886413	8887434	Oh, you can't have that.
8887454	8887754	My bad.
8888595	8888956	All right.
8889356	8891539	Now that that's taken care of, what's on your mind, buddy?
8892380	8894682	I'm just amused by the whole PlayStation FAQ.
8895063	8897306	It just amuses the living shit out of me.
8897686	8898227	It's like...
8899500	8904842	When the prior gen came in, it was like, it can play video games, it can do this, this, and that.
8904882	8907123	And I'm like, can it play Street Fighter?
8907383	8908484	Yes, but it can also do this.
8908904	8910465	Can it play Street Fighter?
8910945	8911845	Yes, it can play Street Fighter.
8911965	8912346	Thank you.
8913006	8915407	PlayStation 4, it can only play Street Fighter.
8916087	8917408	But I want to do all of this.
8918028	8919309	But you can only play Street Fighter.
8919669	8920809	But I want to do this.
8921029	8923410	Well, you should have kept your prior gen console now, shouldn't you?
8924831	8926532	That sounds too much like a Microsoft line.
8928365	8930247	See, that's the funny part.
8930567	8935030	It's like when Microsoft came out the gate running their mouth with everything that they're going to do.
8935731	8937172	Everyone had their guns ready.
8937392	8940755	They were going to Microsoft's castle and just hang Dracula.
8941696	8944358	And Sony's like, they're like Gendo.
8944378	8945999	They're like, we're just going to wait this out.
8947080	8948041	Now they're waiting it out.
8948541	8950482	And Sony's like, we're going to do a little bit of this.
8950983	8951924	We're going to do a little bit of that.
8952144	8953044	We're going to do a little bit of this.
8953605	8954786	And the people are like, wait a minute.
8955811	8956752	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8976809	8977149	and DarkSakura.com
9002144	9002724	True, true.
9003485	9008327	I can't hate on them for that, but I'm amused where they're saying no DLNA.
9008767	9010367	My train of thought is, well, you know what?
9010688	9015169	If I can't watch my anime on the PlayStation 4, I'll just fire up my PlayStation 3.
9016390	9019771	I kind of feel like that's one of the first things you're going to see get reversed.
9019991	9027014	I really think they're listening, and I think they're going to come back and be like, whoa, we didn't realize people were going to make a big deal out of this and miss this.
9027054	9029255	So I kind of suspect you're going to see it.
9030123	9031224	I believe it, I believe it.
9031244	9036527	It's just a little bit of time, which is why I am not running out in the next 12 days to buy one.
9037568	9044652	And that's also part of the reason, I mean, not just the video, it's just the expense and everything and the whole fact that, you know, the games are disappearing that I was going to pick up.
9046393	9049515	Well, from the trailer, I mean, when the promo for the console...
9050814	9051554	Thanks for watching!
9072219	9073099	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9099434	9104519	Not just me, because as GF Day I can tell you, I'm more of a Mario Kart whore than anything else.
9104539	9104599	No.
9119787	9121948	Yes and no, but I'll tell you this now.
9122888	9125348	F-Zero on 3DS would be sick.
9125789	9127529	Because we've played F-Zero.
9128209	9130970	The game plays a lot faster than Mario Kart.
9131010	9132510	It's a lot faster speed.
9132910	9134051	It's tighter controls.
9134551	9137491	I mean, like I said, I have the XL.
9137811	9139332	And there's no fucking blue shells.
9140112	9140572	Exactly.
9140852	9143393	I mean, all the 3DS games I play on the XL now...
9144312	9147853	They feel a lot more surreal, a lot more in-depth, and I have a lot more fun playing them.
9148133	9152274	So, F-Zero on that, Mario Kart on it, I'm sold.
9152914	9153614	I'm like, yes.
9154775	9155195	Alright.
9155915	9158896	Alright, well, I don't know about you, Ranma, I'm starting to feel this liquor a little bit.
9158956	9159376	Feels good.
9160416	9161096	Not me, man.
9161396	9169098	And I shouldn't even be taking another shot, because I gotta get up at 6.30 for work, and I have a near 90-minute commute to work now.
9169238	9171899	You have a way better tolerance than I, that's all I can say.
9173164	9175785	I will send you some of my liver powers.
9177646	9182109	Well, my liver powers have been dared through Patty because she's heavy-handed when she pours.
9182449	9187171	So, Rob, when you come out here to the East Coast, you'll spend a week with her.
9187531	9189932	When you come back, you'll have an iron liver.
9190613	9192794	I really am hoping to get back out to New York in 2014.
9193294	9194134	It is one of the goals.
9194194	9197396	If for nothing else than to see NPH and Hedvig.
9197696	9198436	That's got to happen.
9200596	9202137	Worst case scenario, send a box.
9202337	9202657	As who?
9203338	9203958	Hedvig.
9204118	9204518	Willie.
9204678	9204898	Yes.
9205999	9206239	Ooh.
9206419	9206959	I know, right?
9207440	9207680	All right.
9208160	9210581	I want to send two boxes now, huh?
9211182	9211582	All right, buddy.
9211602	9212943	I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls.
9213403	9213783	You got it.
9213843	9214423	Stay fabulous.
9214563	9214884	Take care.
9214924	9215304	Of course.
9215344	9215804	Stay black.
9216484	9217125	Of course, brother.
9217305	9217585	All right.
9217665	9217925	Bye.
9218265	9218525	Bye.
9219926	9220226	All right.
9220246	9224148	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9224168	9226810	You know, the New York – I love the New York listeners of Orange Lounge Radio.
9226910	9228631	It's a fun group and it's been way too long.
9228651	9229391	I want to go back out there.
9229851	9234353	Speaking of the New York Orange Lounge radio listeners, I know this guy hasn't listened for a while, but I just saw this in chat.
9234473	9236713	SJ100Matt said this in chat and I was like, no way, really?
9237153	9241695	Apparently Sephiroth1215 won one of the PlayStation 4s through Taco Bell.
9242295	9243295	Yeah.
9243375	9243635	Nice.
9243976	9244816	So congrats.
9244836	9245716	I think that's awesome.
9245916	9247257	I just want to win tacos, really.
9247537	9247797	Yeah?
9248417	9249137	Yeah, just tacos.
9249157	9250718	I'm starting to feel a little bit like spinny.
9250978	9251518	These are spinny.
9251858	9252238	And look.
9252458	9252958	Pouring another.
9253138	9254419	Skypline's lighting up.
9255319	9257660	Pretty soon I'm not even going to be able to click on the answer button.
9258755	9260096	Hi, you're on Orange Eyes Radio, who's this?
9260957	9261818	Hey, this is Actdeft.
9262098	9266682	Hey, Actdeft, hold on, we'll get to your call in a minute, but there's something I gotta do first.
9268443	9273888	Yeah, we have a name for that, when you drink a shot, it's called Hidalgo.
9275509	9278712	When you take a shot of public glass, so yeah, do it.
9278872	9279973	What does it mean, Hidalgo?
9279993	9282135	Hidalgo, it's a name, it's...
9283476	9290538	It's actually the name of one of the founding fathers of the nation.
9290698	9291458	So Hidalgo.
9291498	9301100	I don't know where the name comes from for taking a shot, but it's something I've heard throughout the years.
9301340	9301720	You know what?
9301760	9302180	Fair enough.
9302240	9306221	I gave a shout out to the Canadians earlier, so this one goes out to my Mexicans down below.
9306281	9306681	Here we go.
9306761	9308962	And I did put the stuff in a Petron bottle.
9309782	9310122	What?
9311354	9312815	There you go, Actdeft.
9312895	9314556	Does it count that I put it in a Patron bottle?
9316038	9316398	Perhaps.
9316458	9317359	Alright, what's on your mind, buddy?
9317379	9317939	I took the shot.
9317979	9318279	What's up?
9319440	9325144	Well, I wanted to talk about the influential game of the generation, or most influential.
9326846	9329848	Yeah, what do you believe is the most influential game of the generation?
9330909	9331289	Portal.
9332089	9332450	Portal.
9332510	9335932	Oh yeah, you mentioned this in chat earlier, and Jamie somewhat agreed with you.
9335952	9336873	It was her number two pick.
9337233	9338034	Why did you pick Portal?
9339677	9359703	Basically, while Portal didn't do anything that, well, how to say, that special or that original, besides the portals or the physics in the game, that's something that we already seen in other games, especially like Half-Life and stuff like that.
9360964	9364385	But it was influential because of the storytelling, basically.
9365618	9372682	Most of the games after Portal try to imitate something in the storytelling in them.
9373743	9381448	Like games, at least in a more serious and more detailed, well, not detailed, sorry.
9381748	9383389	I'm trying to gather my words.
9383649	9384730	That's all right.
9385390	9387231	Was that because of GLaDOS, you think?
9387812	9389573	Like, you know, everybody loves that character.
9391181	9408215	Yeah, part of that, and part of Shell being mute, it's basically like playing Zelda or playing Mario where the main characters are mute, but since this is a first-person game,
9409896	9415179	Game, so basically they're talking to you, so it's a more personal maybe.
9416279	9431406	And all the experience around it, because it's like, especially because of that, it's a first person, it's a most personal, sorry, more personal experience all around.
9431966	9437568	You're the one doing the stuff, all the stuff happens to you directly, so it's
9438909	9443214	A lot of games after Portal have kind of imitated that.
9444115	9456288	Not maybe in a first-person perspective, but more in what happens in the decisions that you make or the other stuff that you do in the game.
9456928	9458610	Well, basically, it's you.
9459983	9463125	You know what also was great about first-person shooters?
9463825	9465606	I'm starting to slur a little bit.
9466006	9469468	You know what was great about Portal besides just what you're talking about, like the immersion and all that?
9470428	9474951	The thing that was great about Portal is that it was a first-person shooter game for people that hate first-person shooters.
9476151	9476792	Yeah, basically.
9477412	9477852	I mean, really.
9478452	9487517	Everybody I know that hates first-person shooters still loves Portal because it's more a puzzle, obviously, but yet it is that first-person game.
9489569	9495473	and especially that because I got the orange box on the 360 basically for Portal.
9496354	9501978	I didn't finish even the Half-Life 2 and didn't even start episode 1 and 2.
9503078	9505160	I played Team Fortress and I still play it.
9505500	9506921	That's a game I enjoy.
9507781	9511144	But basically I got the orange box
9511784	9514726	Because of Portal, and I played a hell of a lot of it.
9515547	9517668	I have three different copies of it.
9519229	9521090	Two on the Xbox.
9521130	9523192	I got the Orange Box and Still Alive.
9523872	9525913	And then I got the copy on Steam.
9526734	9528475	So I love that game a lot.
9529936	9531938	Like you said, it's an immersive game.
9532778	9533899	It's totally immersive.
9534179	9539022	And like I said, a lot of games have tried to replicate that immersion.
9542044	9543525	and succeed in it.
9543805	9552948	Not all of them, but that's basically the legacy Portal has handed down to gaming.
9553008	9558530	And I think it's a pretty important thing in this generation and probably in the next.
9558910	9562392	And, and, and, very important with Portal and Jonathan Colton.
9563432	9564793	Oh, yeah.
9565333	9565553	All right.
9565573	9567674	Well, Actdeft, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show.
9567694	9568954	But thank you so much for your call, buddy.
9569795	9570095	Thank you.
9570235	9570475	All right.
9570515	9570795	Take care.
9573831	9574151	All right.
9574731	9576192	That does it for calls tonight.
9576572	9577232	Oh, I know.
9577312	9579872	More of you wanted to call in to get me to take more shots.
9579912	9581193	But you guys, it's a school night.
9581233	9585013	I got to work tomorrow, and I'm already feeling a little bit tipsy.
9585074	9587814	So I asked the bartender to call me off.
9587874	9588714	To call it off.
9588814	9589394	Close it down.
9589434	9590055	Shut it down.
9590075	9590735	Cut you off.
9590775	9591395	Cut me off.
9591455	9592335	That's what I was looking for.
9592355	9593935	And I got you water because I'm nice.
9594015	9595636	You are a good friend.
9596956	9598196	I would help you hide bodies.
9598976	9600317	Would you hold my head over the toilet?
9600777	9602257	I'd hold your hair back if you had enough.
9604963	9606224	I'm talking about long hair.
9606284	9607565	Jerk.
9607605	9608005	Rob.
9608245	9609966	You know I have a complex about that.
9610026	9610066	No.
9610086	9610567	I'm just kidding.
9610667	9610967	I don't.
9611167	9612348	But it's funny.
9613629	9614929	So I learned something today.
9615170	9615590	Okay, what?
9615830	9617751	I learned what they call a comb over in Japan.
9618792	9619793	A barcode hair.
9621594	9622674	I don't like that look at all.
9623215	9626197	Yeah, it's kind of bad, but I still thought that was a funny thing.
9626217	9629279	There is nothing wrong with rocking the bald look as far as I'm concerned.
9629319	9629839	You know what?
9629859	9630580	Are you going to shave it off?
9630660	9630800	No.
9631040	9631160	No.
9632574	9633655	See, I think it's distinguished.
9633735	9635236	I'm gonna rock what God gave me.
9635396	9637718	You need, like, black-rimmed glasses.
9638419	9639200	I do have glasses.
9639260	9640581	No, you need, like, mine.
9640781	9641161	Like yours?
9641261	9641602	Like mine.
9641622	9642783	Can I try on your glasses right now?
9642803	9643123	I guess.
9643143	9644104	I'll have to take a picture of it.
9644344	9644864	Okay, that's fine.
9645385	9646205	Does my hair look okay?
9646225	9646706	I don't even know.
9646746	9648007	Alright, what little hair I have?
9648027	9650009	I don't have any face diseases or anything.
9650069	9651970	Oh my God, you're a blind woman.
9652330	9654112	Alright, hey, internet.
9656587	9657468	This is great radio.
9657488	9657968	It's done.
9658008	9660251	I'm going to put it up on the... Oh lordy.
9660572	9660812	I know.
9660832	9663416	I'm really, really freaking nearsighted.
9663436	9663716	Wait, wait.
9663736	9664457	I have to approve.
9664677	9665679	I have to approve the picture.
9665699	9666420	Oh fuck, Rob.
9667241	9667922	This is important.
9669083	9669624	That's great.
9670731	9672472	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9698492	9702294	BlackWolf says, hey, you could take a picture with your 3DS and send it out via swap.
9702594	9703114	Oh, never mind.
9703875	9704255	Womp.

9825246	9827427	So, Loki, your final thought tonight.
9827948	9833492	I wonder if the memory card adapter for the PlayStation 3 that they had at launch or whatever works with the Pocket Station.
