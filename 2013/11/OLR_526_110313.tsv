7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	18000	This week, Nintendo kills Swapnode via Spotpass, because children and penises!
18000	27000	Ubisoft turns tail and drops its passport system for Assassin's Creed, and the PocketStation rumors get stronger with an intending announcement this week. All these plosives and more begin right now.
27000	31000	Orange, Lounge, Radio
58000	61000	Greetings and Salutations
61000	64000	I feel better than I have in a very long time
64000	68000	Good. It's nice to feel great, in a good mood
68000	74000	Well, except for the day's just been so weird because of ye olde time change, arr
74000	78000	And to be honest, and just keeping it real y'all, I'm a little hungover today
78000	81000	So I'm a little, I'm a little like dragon
81000	83000	Rob, you look amazing for a hungover
83000	85000	Well thank you
85000	87000	Did you enjoy the vodka presence?
87000	96000	I haven't, I haven't partaken in the vodka presence, I actually was planning to drink during tonight's show, which I'm sure the listeners would have loved, but now that I've, I kind of drank a lot last night
96000	99000	You should try a shot of it, if you feel up to it later
99000	108000	We'll see, we'll see, if the, if listeners, if y'all behave, and especially knowing that I don't have to get Alan after work now, he's on his way home right now, so I don't have to drive tonight at all, so I can be responsible
108000	109000	Indeed
109000	118000	If listeners behave, I will take a shot, maybe at the beginning of part B, and the wine was already starting to get me to slur my words at the end of last week's show, so this should be hilarious
118000	122000	I'm gonna have to get you a bottle of the honey run, because that stuff was, I love that stuff
122000	123000	Good times
123000	129000	And you were funny, but I have to say, I just forgot what I was gonna say, so please, oh yeah, I'm drunk on coffee and high on life
129000	136000	Woohoo, alright, also say hello to somebody else who I'm sure is high on life, say hello to Techmaster Loki
136000	141000	And actually, November's not a very busy month for games, although there are a couple big games coming out
141000	147000	You've gotta be kidding, I was just thinking today, I was like, oh my god, November 22nd is the day the Xbox One comes out, right?
147000	148000	Yeah
148000	163000	Well, okay, on November 22nd, I've already bought, at Best Buy, and have to go pick up my Zelda 3DS, because I'm not getting the Xbox One right away, just probably next year, and then, you know what else comes out November 22nd is the Mario 3D World Land Cube
163000	167000	It's still not that much, really October was a busier month because you had a lot more releases
167000	170000	Was it really? I just would have thought, well, you've got two consoles launching this month
170000	178000	Yeah, but, so, are you gonna count every single re-release of each of these games on different platforms as a separate title?
178000	179000	I suppose not
179000	185000	It's just the same titles, they're just, oh hey, one comes out one week, one comes out the other week, and whatever
186000	201000	So, really, you only have two major releases, next gen console and first party games aside, you pretty much just have Call of Duty, and Need for Speed, and then, I guess, the Mario, Super Mario 3D World, and that's about it
201000	212000	Well, to be honest, I'm just keeping it real, I mean, I know everybody's excited about this new generation of games, but I'm probably, the single game I'm most excited about is that Wii U Mario game
212000	229000	That, I think, is the game to be most excited about right now, I think those Mario games are, 90% of the time, solid as heck, and all the good, all the kind of early previews and reviews on that thing are really positive, so I don't think I have any reason not to be super excited about that game
229000	233000	I'm more excited about that than anything I can think of on Playstation 4 or Xbox One, to be quite honest
233000	241000	But the resolution that it played on the Xbox One was just terrible, zero P, I mean, it's same with the Playstation 4, zero P
241000	249000	Is that why the fan wank fantasy of Nintendo making Xbox One games can't come true, because Xbox One wouldn't run away?
249000	257000	I get no picture and sound at all, all I get is a stupid arrow that comes on the screen that says this disc is not compatible or it's dirty or something, I just don't get it, but
258000	266000	Now, to be real, I don't really need the Zelda 3DS XL, I really don't need it, and my money could be better spent on other things
266000	271000	Spray paint the damn, but, if you buy it, you can sell me your old one for Dan
271000	273000	Oh, Dan wants a 3DS?
273000	275000	Because he wants to play Zelda!
275000	277000	Why doesn't he buy a Zelda 3DS?
277000	279000	Because I have no job!
279000	281000	What about a 2DS?
281000	285000	I have a buyer earmarked right now, but if that falls through, certainly, that would be a good thing
285000	291000	Dan, if you're listening to the show, which you're not, I'm not getting it for you at all, ever, no, I'm not, you don't need it
291000	300000	So, yeah, anyway, I just want that Zelda 3DS, because it looks so dang cool, and I was so happy that it didn't end up being a GameStop exclusive and I could buy it at a bunch of other retailers
300000	306000	So, yeah, I pre-ordered it at Best Buy, because I don't know if it's going to be limited quantity or what, and I just want to make sure I can
306000	314000	Yeah, they're always limited launch, like those Pokemon 3DS XLs, they're gone, they were gone after their first initial launch
314000	316000	I still saw some on the shelf at Fry's
316000	322000	Yeah, they probably bought a ton and didn't sell them, but it's still, they only do them one batch and that's it
322000	331000	Interesting, alright, well, let's see, I do want to also introduce our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com, because of course we are the show where every gamer has a voice
331000	336000	You guys join us in the chatroom every week, and we like to read some of the comments from the chatroom
336000	344000	Let's see, actdeft saying, I'm considering selling my Pikachu 3DS XL to get a Wii U, it would certainly be a start
344000	352000	Brad from Pod Culture says, Skye, I'm such a sucker, I ordered Injustice for the PlayStation 4, already imported it for PlayStation 3
352000	360000	But yeah, I mean, I know the reviews on that game were mixed, but you, Brad, really liked it, and, you know, I don't, if you like a game, then you like a game
360000	364000	And I don't think there's anything wrong with getting it on multiple consoles if you truly enjoy a game
364000	365000	Even though it's freaking weird
365000	367000	Well, but that's, you know, opinions
367000	371000	I know him, and I have to give him a hard time ever being a DC fanboy anyway
371000	374000	Yeah, well that's an age-old battle YouTube has been having forever
374000	381000	But for me, I have Final Fantasy XIV on PlayStation 3 and PC, and some people think I'm weird for that
381000	382000	Because you are
382000	387000	You bet, I'm playing it on PlayStation 4 when that's available, so I'm excited about that
388000	398000	Xtafur, our buddy from Horde House, is in chat tonight and says, That's one thing about Nintendo, you can bet that all their games will always run and look amazing on their systems
398000	402000	This is why Mario 3D World looks so much better than most other things
402000	407000	I don't know if they knock it out of the park 100% of the time with their games, because sometimes there's some misfires
407000	410000	Like what, Steel Diver wasn't really the hottest 3DS game
411000	419000	But not to totally dismiss your point, because it's one of the biggest perks of Nintendo and one of the biggest drawbacks
419000	422000	Nobody does Nintendo better than Nintendo
422000	426000	The bar is not really set very high for Nintendo either, I mean, because we're talking
426000	431000	No, I'm serious, so the type of game, though, it doesn't have to be that, it's cartoony
431000	433000	It doesn't have to be that realistic
433000	438000	And also it's a lot easier for them because they're developing on one platform as opposed to multi-platform
439000	444000	But that kind of goes with any first party game that you're only going to have on one platform and it might look better
444000	449000	Well, I was going to say, as theJ100Matt was saying, how many multiple copies of DDR do we have
449000	455000	Except that they actually were kind of different from system to system and release to release, so it doesn't matter
455000	461000	I was just about to read that same comment and go, well, it's very similar to the Madden games every year
461000	464000	I mean, DDR was a type of Madden game
465000	470000	Yeah, that actually burned calories instead of making you put them on eating chips
470000	473000	But still, it was music instead of players that changed
473000	476000	That's all you had to change, though, was the music. The music changed the whole game
476000	483000	The game itself, that's like saying, well, hey, Monopoly and another game that uses dice
483000	488000	Monopoly and Dungeons and Dragons are exactly the same because they use dice
488000	493000	Well, the whole point is that it's the content that makes the game, not the style
493000	495000	Well, part of it is the content and the style
495000	501000	Well, I mean, to use the D&D analogy, you use the same method every time you play
501000	504000	But your content's different every time you play
504000	508000	It's the same with DDR and same, I hope, with the sports ball stuff
508000	512000	Alright, well, we're having a fun conversation here at the top of the show
512000	517000	But I wanted to get into the official kickoff topic that I had earmarked for tonight before we get into our gaming weeks
517000	522000	And the kickoff topic I wanted to talk about tonight is, as I've mentioned in prior weeks on the show
522000	526000	We are not going to be here next week, and it's kind of sort of because of BlizzCon
526000	530000	I'm going to be out of town, even though I'm technically not going to BlizzCon
530000	534000	Long story, but I'm going to DizCon and some of the parties, so there you go
534000	538000	So we're not going to be here next week, so no show November 10th, sorry
538000	541000	But we will be back on November 17th
541000	544000	And if you think about it, when we're back with our first live show on November 17th
544000	548000	We will now live in a world that has a PlayStation 4 in it
548000	551000	The next system for, you know, the next generation
551000	555000	Although I know some people may say Wii U is in there, but, you know, well
555000	559000	We all know Nintendo marches to the beat of their own drum
559000	562000	Right? So, you know, okay, yeah, Wii U is there
562000	570000	But PlayStation 4 is, like, you know, and Xbox One are like really kind of like that next level of power and graphics and so forth
570000	577000	So this is really kind of the last episode of OLR to kind of put a cap on this generation
577000	583000	Now, it's not that this generation is done, because obviously there's still plenty of 360 and PlayStation 3 games to come
583000	586000	You don't kill your first child when you have your next child
586000	593000	Yeah, but, and there's even some speculation that this generation could continue if these new consoles tank, which is a possibility
593000	599000	If you were going to use that analogy, I would just be like this great, great, great, great, great grandmother
599000	604000	But for most practical purposes, this generation is probably peaked
604000	612000	And we're in a unique situation here at OLR that when these consoles launched in, what, 2005, 2006, we were around
612000	619000	So we've actually been able to cover this entire generation of gaming from start to finish, you know, having done this show as long as we have
619000	623000	So I'm kind of curious what my co-hosts feel, and I'll share my thoughts too
623000	629000	I want to know, I want to know kind of what you think the most defining game of the generation was
629000	636000	And I don't necessarily mean the best game of the generation, although that certainly may end up being for you the most defining
636000	641000	But what do you think the most defining game of the generation was?
641000	645000	And then I'm also going to ask so you can be thinking about it, and the chatters, you can think about this too
645000	649000	What do you think was the most important thing that happened news-wise in this generation?
649000	653000	Dark Soccer, you're already taking mic to mouth, what are your thoughts?
653000	658000	Well, I'm going to go with the Mass Effect series, I mean, all three of them together because they're a series
658000	660000	No surprise hearing this from you
660000	665000	Well, yeah, but I'm going to say this, that specifically it got me back into gaming this generation
665000	672000	Because I, you know, I had my surgery, and you know, I played a bunch of games and, you know, was, I'm okay, oh this is fun
672000	676000	Oh, this is neat, I'm going to go back and play Puyo Puyo, I always go back and play like my old games
676000	685000	Because I am a classic gamer, but I have to say that since picking up the series and getting into the story again
685000	690000	I've started checking out more and more new things as they've come out, I've started looking at other companies that do similar things
690000	697000	That, well, as opposed to the sucky things that Bioware has done, but you know, companies that have similar types of titles
697000	705000	I've got, I've been playing Dragon Age, I've been really expanding, and I think that it's just, it's the first series that's been out
705000	713000	That had so engaging a story that I really, it's, and I've used this quote before, a friend of mine in Becky's
713000	720000	Has said it's the best movie I've ever played, and you know how you go back and watch your favorite, how often have we seen Showgirls?
720000	726000	But you know, you go back and you watch your, you know, your favorite show over and over even if part of it, you know, has sucked
726000	730000	You know, even if you didn't like part of this story or didn't, or thought this could have been better
730000	737000	You still go back and watch it if it's something that you love, especially if it's the universe that you like
737000	744000	And I had actually gotten pretty kind of bored with it for a little while, and then I just went back and started over
744000	748000	And I was like, well, you know what, this is kind of fun again, and started finding new things to enjoy
748000	752000	And you know, so I'm actually kind of getting back into it, it's really funny
752000	762000	But it was, you know, especially, you know, now I play it on PC, mind you, but it still goes in with the same generation
762000	768000	And, you know, my second choice is actually up there too, I don't know if I can mention my second choice
768000	769000	Sure, of course
769000	776000	The Portal series, Portal and Portal 2, because those added in all kinds of different mechanics
776000	782000	And made you use your brain as well as having just a delicious, starky humor in it that was fantastic
782000	789000	And, you know, but the big two things about both of those is that you also have this community built up around it
790000	793000	I hate to use the word fandom, but it really is just that
793000	797000	It's funny that you bring up Portal, because I'm looking at our chatroom, and of course we've got people naming their games
797000	800000	Act Def says, the game that defined this generation, Portal
800000	806000	And definitely probably in my top five, I would have put the orange box as one of the defining games of this generation
806000	818000	Because it was such that immense value, but it also brought us Portal, it brought us, I think in many ways the orange box kind of set up Steam in a lot of ways
818000	825000	And I realize Steam was around before, but I think a lot of people really got onto Steam in large part because of those orange box games
825000	830000	And Steam has been, you know, I don't want to leave the PC and how they've been pacing alongside consoles out of this necessarily
830000	836000	So I think the orange box really heavily contributed, that would definitely be my top five, it's not my number one, but yeah
836000	840000	Well, here's the point I was going back to, why I call them defining games
840000	848000	Is first of all, you do have, like you were just mentioning that side by side with PC, you're actually with so much crossover between consoles and PC
848000	858000	You're expanding the fan base, you are building an actual bigger community instead of this us versus them mentality that's existed forever
858000	865000	You've actually got both people playing these games, you know, how often have I modded Becky's save files for Mass Effect 2 and 3?
866000	877000	Plenty of times, and you know, you've got this level of crossover, but it's, when you've got people who are so invested in the story that they've expanded around it
877000	881000	That I think that you've made, you've really gotten a success story out of it
881000	889000	I was really considering, I wasn't going to say the Mass Effect, I was really considering saying Mass Effect 3 is my game of the generation
889000	896000	I knew you would say it though, so I'm going to pick something else, and I know a lot of people would say, why not 2?
896000	904000	How could you pick 3 over 2? And this is where I go, well it's not necessarily about the best, but it's about what defined this generation
904000	912000	And I think in a lot of ways, you know, Mass Effect 3 introduced the multiplayer element of it, you know, which I love, and still get a lot of replayability out of it
912000	913000	And I want to play again soon
913000	919000	Yeah, and it's still a great game, but then you get into that whole debacle about the ending
919000	928000	And I think the internet backlash to that, whether you like it or not, was definitely one of the more noteworthy things to happen
928000	938000	You know, the way that the fans in many ways revolted against what they put out for the game was something you wouldn't have seen in previous generations
938000	945000	You know, like I think we all said around the time, Final Fantasy VII, thank god the internet wasn't out when people saw Final Fantasy VII's ending for the first time
945000	949000	You probably would have seen something similar, and so I think that in many ways
949000	950000	I liked the ending for that game
950000	954000	I think that in many ways, for better or for worse, defined the generation
954000	962000	So, I'll save my pick for just a minute here, Loki, what do you think was the game that defined the generation for better or for worse?
962000	968000	Well, here's kind of a weird take on it, but I'm going to say Saints Row the Third
968000	970000	And, unfortunately
970000	972000	Is that just because it's you, though?
972000	974000	No, no, and hold on, let me explain
974000	976000	It's deep
976000	977000	Where every gamer has a voice
977000	978000	Deep
978000	979000	It's deep
979000	980000	Saints Row deep
980000	984000	Well, no, this is, and watch, hold on, you'll understand in just a sec
985000	986000	So, here's why
986000	989000	Saints Row was a great series, and I really enjoyed it
989000	993000	And, I mean, pretty much the whole series has been in this generation so far
993000	1004000	Well, the reason why Third is most defining of this generation is because of all the business tactics that are being used in games nowadays
1004000	1007000	It kind of introduced a lot of these things, at least to that series
1007000	1010000	Like, for example, on disc DLC
1010000	1012000	DLC whoring
1012000	1018000	Really terrible DLC that they charge a lot of money for and you get very little content out of
1018000	1025000	Basically gutting what was a really good series and then turning it into some big monetization fest
1025000	1028000	That is this generation of games
1028000	1035000	It's basically something that you, they've done so much to where you actually hate the series
1035000	1038000	And yet you'll still buy it the next year that it comes out
1038000	1042000	That's basically this series, this generation in gaming
1042000	1045000	You take the abuse and you still come back
1045000	1048000	Very interesting pick
1048000	1053000	I have, I can't really get around it
1053000	1057000	I have two picks for the game of the generation, but one of them is not really a game
1057000	1061000	So let me start with, and I know people are going to roll their eyes at this
1061000	1066000	But it really is, I think in many ways, the game that defined this generation, for better or worse
1066000	1069000	I believe that game is Wii Fit
1069000	1071000	Get off your ass the game?
1071000	1073000	Kind of
1073000	1078000	And I think that whole exer-gaming thing
1078000	1081000	Now some might go, well why not Wii Sports?
1081000	1084000	And believe me, I was thinking Wii Sports big time
1084000	1087000	But I really was thinking about more Wii Fit
1087000	1093000	How that really took what Wii Sports did for the whole get up off your butt and move gaming
1093000	1095000	And really pushed that forward
1095000	1100000	And really for the first time, didn't make video games look like something for lazy people
1100000	1103000	And I think that was a very important turning point in this generation
1103000	1105000	But DDR didn't?
1105000	1110000	DDR didn't catch on the way Wii Fit did because Konami didn't believe in it the way Nintendo did
1110000	1112000	Whether we like it or not
1112000	1114000	What's your point?
1114000	1120000	I think when Nintendo really pushing Wii Fit and really getting it out there
1120000	1128000	I think they really brought this counterbalance and moved the Wiis and exercise gaming altogether
1128000	1131000	Into the commonplace
1131000	1133000	Soccer moms were eating it up
1133000	1137000	Retirement homes, grandmas were playing video games
1137000	1141000	And this was like, you know, a huge thing
1141000	1143000	I have another one by the way
1143000	1147000	You can't just have one because it's hard to define a whole generation of that
1147000	1151000	And yes this is not going to grant the thought of 5 again because that's just too easy
1151000	1156000	Minecraft is another example of a thing that defines this generation
1156000	1161000	You have an indie game that just goes crazy, just blows up
1161000	1166000	You have basically all of the content out there
1166000	1172000	The community, the YouTube videos, just all that sort of stuff
1172000	1179000	And kind of almost kick starting I think a little bit of the indie resurgence you've seen
1179000	1183000	Where, hey, these indie games can actually be very good
1183000	1189000	And now you're seeing a lot more focus on indie titles and stuff that's not coming from a big publisher or developer
1189000	1192000	Well that and the genre of sandbox games in general
1192000	1194000	That's been around forever
1194000	1199000	But it really brought that back up into the limelight
1199000	1204000	My other pick for the game, and I'm using my quotey fingers
1204000	1208000	That define this generation of games is Netflix
1208000	1211000	I'm sorry, I didn't expect that, but yeah
1211000	1216000	But think about it, okay Netflix isn't a game, yes I know that
1216000	1223000	But didn't all our game consoles turn into something else, a little something else because of Netflix?
1223000	1229000	Yes there's Hulu and all this other stuff too, but Netflix obviously being the biggest one
1229000	1231000	And me just being a big fan of Orange is the New Black
1231000	1237000	Isn't that the one that really just turned game consoles into entertainment centers?
1237000	1238000	Not at my house
1238000	1243000	But we had a dedicated computer set up just for that, we didn't need to use any of that
1243000	1245000	But admittedly you're different
1245000	1249000	And again, I'm thinking about the soccer mom families and so forth
1249000	1255000	There's people that go out there and buy Wii's because they're cheap Netflix boxes
1255000	1263000	Yeah there is that, I mean it's for the same reason that people bought PS2's because of them being a DVD player
1263000	1265000	And the Blu-ray player for PS3
1265000	1270000	And one of the other games I would throw out there
1270000	1272000	And then we'll change topics here, I want to get into news stories
1272000	1275000	One of the other games that really define the generation
1275000	1280000	And you know I say for better or for worse and in this case it's definitely for worse
1280000	1283000	I think Farmville
1283000	1285000	I just burped a bit
1285000	1291000	But whether you like it or not, mobile and Facebook gaming has become bigger and bigger lately
1291000	1295000	And again it's the whole fact that it gets these people to play games
1295000	1298000	Not just play them but obsess over them
1298000	1302000	Like grandma's going out of town because she's going on a cruise for a week
1302000	1306000	Can somebody watch her farm so her frickin' cows don't die or whatever it is
1306000	1307000	That's my mother
1307000	1308000	See?
1308000	1309000	Yeah
1309000	1311000	Did your mother ever play video games before Farmville?
1311000	1312000	Yes
1312000	1313000	Oh
1313000	1314000	We used to have
1314000	1316000	Damn you ruined my point I was trying to make
1316000	1320000	My mom and I used to get into screaming matches over Dr. Mario
1320000	1323000	Which by the way her birthday is in two days so happy birthday
1323000	1328000	Alright SSG100Matt says angry birds also, definitely for those same reasons
1329000	1333000	Extover says I think Wii Sports would be more defining than Wii Fit to be honest
1333000	1336000	It really was the defining moment for all motion control games
1336000	1341000	I do agree to a point Extover and I think Wii Sports obviously was
1341000	1345000	Well it was the biggest game this generation as far as sales go
1345000	1351000	But I think Wii Fit really took what Wii Sports started and just kind of put an exclamation point on it
1351000	1353000	And that's kind of why I said Wii Fit
1353000	1358000	I mean especially you start to look at how the Kinect and the Move really got a piece of that
1358000	1360000	It was a lot more the exercise gaming and all that
1360000	1362000	I mean look at all those games that come out they're all exercise games
1362000	1363000	So anyway
1363000	1371000	Tigerclaw says two words horse armor which you know definitely Skyrim I think is a game of the generation in some ways
1371000	1376000	There's a lot of people you know that can play that game and only that game and never anything but that game
1376000	1378000	I just don't think that Skyrim brought anything really new
1378000	1384000	Tal says or maybe that's Tal sorry for mispronouncing that says at least no one mentioned Journey
1384000	1392000	You know Journey is a pretty incredible game though and I just Journey kind of stands on its own
1392000	1397000	I don't think we've yet seen how Journey has inspired other games yet
1397000	1400000	But that might be coming in the next generation
1400000	1404000	But Journey I think Journey was an amazing game and one of the best of the generation
1404000	1406000	But I don't know if it necessarily defined it
1406000	1408000	Kind of the difference there
1408000	1416000	Or if it had to be something that added definition to this generation of gaming
1416000	1421000	I would say that it added it brought back an artistic element that had been missing
1421000	1423000	Call of Duty Modern Warfare
1423000	1424000	Why?
1424000	1430000	Because that just it basically steamrolled the franchise that they have now
1431000	1435000	And then there was that whole divorce after that right or was that Modern Warfare 2?
1435000	1436000	That was after that
1436000	1438000	That was after Modern Warfare 2 I think
1438000	1441000	One more comment here and then I'll switch topics here
1441000	1446000	Extrovert says for me The Last of Us is the epitome of the defining game of this generation
1446000	1449000	To me it was this generation's series finale
1449000	1452000	That's an interesting analogy there
1452000	1457000	You know I can see that I mean I've wanted to play the game I haven't played it yet
1457000	1461000	But for everything that I've seen come up around it I'd have to agree with that
1461000	1464000	Sort of like the cherry on top of the sundae
1464000	1468000	I do like that analogy that it's the series finale
1468000	1470000	I think that's a neat way of putting it
1470000	1472000	And then we wake up and it's Bob Newhart in his bed
1472000	1474000	It was all a dream
1474000	1478000	Alright how about the news that defined this generation
1478000	1481000	You might really have to rack your brain a little bit
1481000	1484000	But what do you think was the news story that really defined this generation?
1484000	1486000	I'd say it was a series of news stories
1486000	1488000	There might be more than one that you can think of
1488000	1490000	But something off the top of your head
1490000	1492000	And I ask this to chat as well
1492000	1496000	Well I'm really going to go with a series of them
1496000	1499000	Because they all go back to the same thing
1499000	1502000	It's all those stupid violence blaming video games
1502000	1505000	Which we've got psychological studies proving the exact opposite
1505000	1509000	We have statistics showing that crime has decreased since the
1509000	1512000	When did the Nintendo come out? Was it 91? 90?
1512000	1515000	The original Nintendo? 85
1515000	1517000	I don't know why I was saying that, but Super Nintendo
1517000	1519000	I think you said Super Nintendo was 90 to 91
1519000	1522000	Because we've had a decrease in armed crime amongst youth
1522000	1527000	Over the last 20-30 years
1527000	1532000	But they still go back and try to do this as scapegoat
1532000	1535000	It's still turning into this misunderstood thing
1535000	1540000	When in reality it's just another mask for what the real problem is
1540000	1544000	So I think we're seeing a bigger increase of scapegoatism
1544000	1547000	In the news about video games
1547000	1550000	Loki, any thoughts?
1550000	1553000	It's a tough question, especially live
1553000	1555000	I can't even remember what happened last year
1555000	1558000	Like you guys, I seriously told Loki in Dark Soccer
1558000	1560000	Like 5 minutes before the show what was going to come up
1560000	1563000	As usually happens here in the world of live radio
1563000	1565000	Well I'm just trying to think of big stuff
1565000	1569000	There's the PlayStation Network hacking thing
1569000	1571000	Since you brought it up, that was my number one
1571000	1573000	The PlayStation Network hack
1573000	1575000	I wouldn't even do that
1575000	1578000	I don't know, it's just kind of to me
1578000	1581000	Maybe the Xbox One announcement
1581000	1583000	And kind of all the stuff that went wrong
1583000	1587000	Like during E3 and kind of the reversal of that stuff
1587000	1591000	It's kind of like this generation's
1591000	1595000	Almost, I don't know, some people like the specs and stuff
1595000	1598000	That they have on the console and all the different DRM things and stuff
1598000	1600000	But it's almost like for the majority of the people
1600000	1603000	I think it's like this kind of nightmare situation
1603000	1605000	Like this is the way things are going
1605000	1611000	And kind of demonstrating all the stuff that's kind of gone wrong in this generation
1611000	1616000	I don't know, I can't really think of anything that's super defining in this
1616000	1623000	It's hard to say, there hasn't really been any huge, huge, huge changes I think
1623000	1626000	I do think of two things that I would like to have been defining
1626000	1630000	And one of them was how they were networking the PS3s as a computer to
1630000	1633000	What was it, leukemia or cancer research?
1633000	1635000	Oh, the folding at home?
1635000	1639000	Yeah, I thought that's something that should have been defining
1639000	1642000	But people like to look at the negative instead of the positive
1642000	1646000	But that and all of the charities that popped up around next generation gaming
1646000	1650000	I'm not saying that they popped up with this generation
1650000	1653000	But they've certainly come to higher prevalence with this generation
1653000	1656000	We have Child's Play, Extra Life
1656000	1659000	A lot of them are going back and playing older consoles
1659000	1664000	But we're seeing a lot more of these popping up and getting attention
1664000	1669000	I kind of tie that to the emergence of streaming your gameplay online
1669000	1673000	And kind of Twitch TV and Ustream and all that
1673000	1676000	I think that's one of the big things about this generation
1676000	1683000	I think you see a lot of charity drives able to be done a lot easier
1683000	1688000	And a lot more ground roots, ground level types of fundraising
1688000	1689000	Grassroots?
1689000	1691000	Thank you, that's the word I was looking for
1691000	1695000	Types of fundraising because of being able to stream your games online
1695000	1698000	And just have that instant audience
1698000	1702000	I kind of think that story is evolving as we move into PlayStation 4
1702000	1705000	And Xbox 360 going to have that stuff in there
1705000	1708000	So we'll get into the news in a minute here where there's some borders with that
1708000	1709000	And what it will and won't do
1709000	1715000	But I think that is definitely a big story that's kind of bridging the two generations
1715000	1721000	I would really like for stuff like that to be the defining news of the generation
1721000	1722000	Really?
1722000	1726000	The most defining, I think the most defining thing ever of this generation
1726000	1728000	President Cat
1728000	1734000	I more want to put it as you have communities of people coming together for a good cause through video games
1734000	1738000	I love some of these answers here in chat
1738000	1740000	And this is a great one that I didn't even think of
1740000	1742000	And I'm sitting here going why, why didn't I think of this
1742000	1745000	Tal in our chat room says Kickstarter
1745000	1747000	Any Kickstarter related game
1747000	1749000	And Black Wolf adds to that
1749000	1752000	The news story of this generation is either the emergence of Kickstarter
1752000	1757000	Or the internet bitching enough that a storyteller changed the ending of the story they wanted to tell
1757000	1759000	But you know both those things have something in common
1759000	1763000	And that is the voice of the internet has become a huge thing this generation
1764000	1768000	If you think about it, I don't want to toot our own horn a little bit
1768000	1772000	But podcasting wasn't around last time
1772000	1773000	Heck yeah
1773000	1774000	And it is now
1774000	1776000	And that's all a part of that
1776000	1780000	It's just the voice of the gamer getting a little louder
1780000	1785000	And those barriers, you know it used to be the magazine would come to my home
1785000	1788000	And that was the only way I kind of kept tabs on what was going on in the gaming industry
1788000	1792000	But those barriers between us and the gaming industry are really coming down
1792000	1793000	Twitter is a big part of that
1793000	1797000	I can interact with developers directly for better or for worse
1797000	1802000	Well in general though that would be an evolution of communication itself
1802000	1805000	Where many communities are coming together
1805000	1809000	And having that interactivity that we didn't have you know 30 years ago
1809000	1812000	Or that we barely had 30 years ago I'll put it that way
1812000	1814000	I mean I met my husband online
1814000	1818000	I've made tons, like the chat room is full of you know friends of mine now
1818000	1820000	You know people I can call friends so
1820000	1822000	And that I might not have met otherwise
1822000	1823000	Absolutely
1823000	1829000	And Tigerclaw says you could also add the whole thing with PSN being hacked and down for a few weeks
1829000	1833000	I said it briefly but yeah that would actually be my number one most defining thing
1833000	1835000	I think was when Playstation Network was hacked
1835000	1842000	Because I think in a lot of ways how much information we're putting out there about ourselves easily
1842000	1846000	I think a very tough lesson was learned in many ways all around the board
1846000	1851000	Just like I think the last generation, the Xbox and Playstation 2
1851000	1855000	I think the defining thing of that generation was Xbox Live
1855000	1863000	It's almost like the defining thing of this generation was when the trust there kind of fails us
1863000	1864000	If that makes sense
1864000	1866000	Well that's how you were over the Xbox thing
1866000	1867000	Well sure
1867000	1871000	And you really do understand a lot more of the nature of marketing
1872000	1879000	Watching the reactions between the two companies, how they responded to their respective hackings
1879000	1883000	Also digital, I mean because there was a big push for Xbox Live Arcade
1883000	1886000	And I mean that was something that happened
1886000	1888000	And also you know full size digital games
1888000	1891000	I mean granted I'm sure it was on the PC stuff a long time ago
1891000	1894000	But console wise you know digital has been a big thing
1894000	1896000	So it was that
1896000	1900000	Alright well I'm sure you guys sitting there listening to the show have plenty more to add to this
1900000	1904000	So I invite you to email us or tweet us especially while we're down during the week
1904000	1908000	And let us know what defined this generation be it game or news for you
1908000	1912000	That's mailbag at orangelandtrader.com or you can tweet us at OLR
1912000	1914000	One final thought Jamie
1914000	1917000	I'd say the crappiest thing about this generation
1917000	1920000	Manuals! We need manuals to come back
1920000	1923000	And we need these companies to hire me to design them
1923000	1926000	So in other words it's the downside to the digital stuff
1926000	1928000	Exactly
1928000	1931000	The content is so beautiful I love manuals and I love posters
1931000	1934000	And I love getting stuff with my game that I can put on my wall
1934000	1937000	Or you know keep Midna from eating
1937000	1940000	Alright let's move on
1940000	1943000	I want to talk about our gaming weeks quickly we're running a little long tonight
1943000	1945000	Because that was a great kick off topic thank you guys
1945000	1947000	Let's quickly talk about our gaming week start Sakura
1947000	1949000	I'm not playing Animal Crossing right now
1949000	1951000	At all, am I?
1951000	1954000	Final Fantasy 14 I've been kind of stalling on that
1954000	1957000	Just because I'm on my second job and it's so slow
1958000	1963000	I was gifted thanks to DNL Dreams who is so sweet
1963000	1965000	I gave her a box of yarn a while back
1965000	1968000	And she has in return given me the Stanley parable
1968000	1971000	So I will be playing it very soon
1971000	1973000	I played some fractal
1973000	1976000	I have been playing a little bit more of the Super Mario 3D world
1976000	1979000	But like I said 3D kind of eh for me
1981000	1984000	And Dan is playing Legend of Zelda
1984000	1987000	Which ever the Oracle of Seasons ones is
1987000	1989000	Our thing
1989000	1991000	He just finished Mimish Cap
1991000	1993000	Is he doing Mimish Cap now?
1993000	1995000	He's doing one of them anyway
1995000	1997000	But Dan's going on this big Zelda kick lately
1997000	2000000	So my house has been full of Zelda music
2000000	2003000	And lots of loud cursing
2005000	2007000	And then in addition to that
2007000	2011000	It's just been me hunting down stuff on Steam that I haven't played in a while
2011000	2015000	And actually trying to get some use out of these games
2015000	2017000	And stuff I've gotten on sale before
2017000	2019000	So what about you?
2021000	2023000	I'm sorry I really read it
2023000	2025000	Oh Reddit's funny
2027000	2029000	What have I played this week?
2029000	2031000	Grand Theft Auto 5
2031000	2033000	Yeah that would have been Grand Theft Auto 5
2033000	2036000	So I played a bit of online
2036000	2040000	We did a very short Va game night this week
2040000	2042000	Thanks to the one person that came out
2042000	2044000	I guess everybody else is doing more important things
2044000	2046000	But next week though
2046000	2048000	Next week on Friday we will be doing
2048000	2050000	Another Va game night
2050000	2052000	This time on Playstation 3
2052000	2054000	So if you have the Playstation 3 version of Grand Theft Auto 5
2054000	2056000	And wish to play with us online
2056000	2058000	We will be doing that
2058000	2060000	8.15 on Friday
2060000	2062000	I should get Dan in on that
2062000	2064000	Because he would be hilarious
2064000	2066000	I mean he's hilarious anyway
2066000	2068000	And he's also funny looking
2068000	2070000	It'll be fun and I'm gonna try to get my coworkers
2070000	2072000	That are not too old
2072000	2074000	That won't fall asleep
2074000	2076000	I swear to god
2076000	2078000	It's just like
2078000	2080000	You know my boss half the time
2080000	2082000	Yeah I totally forgot to play last time
2082000	2084000	Because I got home and I just fell asleep
2084000	2086000	How fucking old are you?
2086000	2088000	You're not that old I mean seriously
2088000	2090000	Naps are awesome what are you talking about?
2090000	2092000	It's like I was just so tired I couldn't play
2092000	2094000	And then my other coworkers
2094000	2096000	You were like Raz and Mike
2096000	2098000	You know our one IT guy
2098000	2100000	Who just got the game
2100000	2102000	You're like I'll play you gotta make sure you're there
2102000	2104000	Make sure you're there
2104000	2106000	He shows up everybody else does not
2106000	2108000	It's like what the hell man
2108000	2110000	But yeah we'll be there
2110000	2112000	I'm still working on my 100% stuff
2112000	2114000	I'm doing the knife flights now
2114000	2116000	Which I'm stuck on
2116000	2118000	One that's very near the
2118000	2120000	Near the film lot
2120000	2122000	And it's a pain in the ass
2122000	2124000	I can't get the plane low enough
2124000	2126000	To trigger it
2126000	2128000	So I don't know
2128000	2130000	But I got all my stunt jumps done
2130000	2132000	And all my collectables done
2132000	2134000	And I'm at 96% or 7% now
2134000	2136000	So I just have to do knife flights
2136000	2138000	Fly under some bridges
2138000	2140000	And go to the strip club with my friends
2140000	2142000	That's actually one of the things I have to do
2142000	2144000	Alright
2144000	2146000	That it?
2146000	2148000	That's not a night in Los Santos without boobs
2148000	2150000	My gaming week was
2150000	2152000	A lot of Final Fantasy 14
2152000	2154000	As is to be expected as of late
2154000	2156000	But I'm having a great time in that game
2156000	2158000	And Shane is bugging me
2158000	2160000	As are other members of my free company
2160000	2162000	Are bugging me to finish my relic plus one
2162000	2164000	Quest so I do really need to do that
2164000	2166000	But otherwise just having a good time
2166000	2168000	Getting my darklight gear completed and all that
2168000	2170000	As far as other new games to talk about
2170000	2172000	Well this one's not new
2172000	2174000	But it's like a fresh coat of paint
2174000	2176000	On an old classic and that would be the Wii U
2176000	2178000	Virtual console release of Super Castlevania 4
2178000	2180000	And I was playing
2180000	2182000	Because that came out
2182000	2184000	Was it on Halloween or the day before?
2184000	2186000	It was this week
2186000	2188000	And since I already had it on Wii
2188000	2190000	It was only like a dollar to get the Wii U version
2190000	2192000	Which was great
2192000	2194000	And before tonight's show I was sitting here playing it
2194000	2196000	And it was on the TV behind me
2196000	2198000	And Dark Soccer goes
2198000	2200000	It's so weird that when your TV moves by itself
2200000	2202000	Hey you know I was really proud of myself
2202000	2204000	When I stepped in and I recognized it just where you had it paused
2204000	2206000	I was like
2206000	2208000	I look super Nintendo
2208000	2210000	Absolutely
2210000	2212000	So yeah
2212000	2214000	An amazing classic
2214000	2216000	And if for whatever reason you miss this game
2216000	2218000	And you happen to own a Wii U
2218000	2220000	I really urge you to pick it up
2220000	2222000	I imagine most people that are on the Wii U
2222000	2224000	Probably already played this at some point
2224000	2226000	But it is so worth it
2226000	2228000	I mean even the fact that they charge $8 for it
2228000	2230000	I think it's a worthy
2230000	2232000	I mean the game was just ahead of its time
2232000	2234000	As far as platformers are concerned
2234000	2236000	I love it so much
2236000	2238000	Super Castlevania IV
2238000	2240000	Love it
2240000	2242000	Also earlier this week
2242000	2244000	And I know we're going to get into this in the news
2244000	2246000	So it might be a little bit redundant
2246000	2248000	But on Monday, I think it was Monday
2248000	2250000	The Typing of the Dead Overkill came out
2250000	2252000	Which is the new Typing of the Dead
2252000	2254000	Based on the House of the Dead Overkill
2254000	2256000	Which was the Wii version of the game
2256000	2258000	So when I heard there was a new Typing of the Dead
2258000	2260000	I was like yes please buy
2260000	2262000	Because it's what 50% off on Steam during the week
2262000	2264000	10 bucks yeah
2264000	2266000	20 bucks instead of 20 during the week
2266000	2268000	So I bought it and I actually did some streaming
2268000	2270000	Which you can see the archive on my YouTube
2270000	2272000	Under user RobRobertsPlays
2272000	2274000	I think it's my YouTube
2274000	2276000	I'm having to get used to having a YouTube channel now
2276000	2278000	But I think the archive is at RobRobertsPlays
2278000	2280000	On YouTube and you can see me
2280000	2282000	And I think Shane and Xtopher at some point
2282000	2284000	Joined the call and we were just kind of playing through
2284000	2286000	The Typing of the Dead Overkill
2286000	2288000	Which I remember Typing of the Dead on Dreamcast
2288000	2290000	And I loved that game
2290000	2292000	So I was a little sad in this new one
2292000	2294000	Because the game's broadcast packs don't show on people's backs
2294000	2296000	And there's not even the PC or whatever
2296000	2298000	It's just kind of a straight up port of the Wii version
2298000	2300000	But I didn't play the Wii version
2300000	2302000	So I honestly thought it was like a brand new game
2302000	2304000	And I imagine there's a lot of you out there
2304000	2306000	That probably missed the Wii version
2306000	2308000	It was also on PlayStation 3
2308000	2310000	Was it really? I don't remember at all
2310000	2312000	Was it like a move game or something?
2312000	2314000	It was move enabled
2314000	2316000	I think it also allowed you to use the analog sticks
2316000	2318000	If you really wanted to
2318000	2320000	I guess I never really get into those games
2320000	2322000	On the home console
2322000	2324000	The last shooter game I really truly loved
2324000	2326000	At home was Point Blank
2326000	2328000	And that was a long time ago
2328000	2330000	That needs to come back
2330000	2332000	Those games were amazing
2332000	2334000	I never really got into Time Crisis
2334000	2336000	Or any of the on-rails shooters at home
2336000	2338000	That's more of an arcade thing to me
2338000	2340000	I never really played House of the Dead
2340000	2342000	It sounded like you said Ass of the Dead for a minute
2342000	2344000	There's actually a reason I did not buy it
2344000	2346000	Because I need bad voice acting
2346000	2348000	In my House of the Dead
2348000	2350000	We're beating G over there
2350000	2352000	I do believe that this is the one
2352000	2354000	That had the most uses of fuck in it
2354000	2356000	Oh my gosh
2356000	2358000	It's so over the top
2358000	2360000	And it's really dirty, nasty
2360000	2362000	Dialogue and exploitation
2362000	2364000	Films of the past
2364000	2366000	Like Quentin Tarantino style
2366000	2368000	70s
2368000	2370000	It's crazy
2370000	2372000	So it was like House of 1000 Corpses the game?
2372000	2374000	Kind of
2374000	2376000	If you're in the right mood for it, it's pretty funny
2376000	2378000	Of course, the phrases that you type in
2378000	2380000	Hilarious, the things that come up
2380000	2382000	We got one on the livestream that was
2382000	2384000	Walrus Punch
2384000	2386000	I don't know why that was so funny, but it was great
2386000	2388000	And I saw a screenshot of one on the internet
2388000	2390000	Where in the hospital level, there's a zombie
2390000	2392000	That gets up out of the bed and you have to type
2392000	2394000	Thanks Obama
2394000	2396000	That was funny
2396000	2398000	Ok, that's pretty cool
2398000	2400000	Loved it
2400000	2402000	And a hitstun in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
2402000	2404000	Says, I was also disappointed in the lack of
2404000	2406000	And yes, it contains House of the Dead
2406000	2408000	Overkill extended cut
2408000	2410000	Yes, if you want to use your mouse and play the clicky click
2410000	2412000	Version, you can do that too
2412000	2414000	But for me, it's all about the typing
2414000	2416000	You know what though, I do have to say
2416000	2418000	That the best thing to ever come
2418000	2420000	Out of Typing of the Dead
2420000	2422000	Was Cosplay I saw at AX one year
2422000	2424000	That had the Dreamcast pack
2424000	2426000	And the keyboard and everything, that was awesome
2426000	2428000	That's awesome, amazing
2428000	2430000	Alright, let's get into
2430000	2432000	Gaming news
2432000	2434000	In housekeeping real quick though, before we get there
2434000	2436000	Once again, I said this earlier, but just a reminder
2436000	2438000	We will not be here live next week
2440000	2442000	But I will be here live, just not on air
2442000	2444000	Maybe you'll do a twitch thing
2444000	2446000	Or something, I don't know
2446000	2448000	I'll do my homework
2448000	2450000	And let you guys watch
2450000	2452000	We're taking a night off, because you know what
2452000	2454000	Sometimes we want a night off
2454000	2456000	Sneaking myself off in Rob's luggage
2456000	2458000	Also
2458000	2460000	In housekeeping tonight, I want to mention
2460000	2462000	That we unveiled something new
2462000	2464000	At vognetwork.com tonight
2464000	2466000	You can hear the in-depth discussion on the Bobby Blackwolf
2466000	2468000	Show when he posts his episode mid-week
2468000	2470000	But in a nutshell
2470000	2472000	The game at vognetwork.com
2472000	2474000	Now includes a
2474000	2476000	Raffle element
2476000	2478000	So in other words, when you check into shows, you get your points
2478000	2480000	You do all that
2480000	2482000	You can potentially earn
2482000	2484000	Real crap that we will ship to you
2484000	2486000	And this month's crap
2486000	2488000	Is pretty good, it's Cards Against Humanity
2488000	2490000	It's a sealed version of a very hard to get game
2490000	2492000	So yeah, I'm sure there'll be some people that want to get that
2492000	2494000	So all you have to do
2494000	2496000	You have to enter though, you're not automatically put in
2496000	2498000	Just because you get points, you do have to enter
2498000	2500000	And you can check that out at vognetwork.com
2500000	2502000	Slash raffles, and I think that also shows up now
2502000	2504000	On the left side of the page
2504000	2506000	Under your user info
2506000	2508000	Contributors to the network
2508000	2510000	And people that have won in the past
2510000	2512000	Few months will be ineligible
2512000	2514000	And unfortunately
2514000	2516000	This particular month's raffle
2516000	2518000	Is only open to US residents
2518000	2520000	Because it's really expensive to ship overseas
2520000	2522000	And it's coming out of our own pocket
2522000	2524000	So we can't have it yet overseas
2524000	2526000	But we're really hoping that some of the rewards
2526000	2528000	In future month will be digital oriented
2528000	2530000	Which will be much easier for us to give to our overseas friends
2530000	2532000	Because we want the game to be something
2532000	2534000	Everybody can participate in
2534000	2536000	And many of you have been until now
2536000	2538000	So we just want to say thank you very much
2538000	2540000	And hope you enjoy this new little twist
2540000	2542000	On the VOG Network game
2542000	2544000	One other thing I gotta say
2544000	2546000	And then we can get into news
2546000	2548000	But this is important
2548000	2550000	And I want to wish a very happy episode number 400
2550000	2552000	To our friends over at Pod Culture
2552000	2554000	Because they are hitting episodes
2554000	2556000	It's already been taped
2556000	2558000	But they are putting out episode number 400 this week
2558000	2560000	It debuts at VOG Network tomorrow
2560000	2562000	At 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern
2562000	2564000	That's Monday
2564000	2566000	But then it will be on their feed right after that
2566000	2568000	And obviously 400 episodes is an amazing milestone
2568000	2570000	Brad and his gang over there at Pod Culture
2570000	2572000	Christina, Adam, all those guys
2572000	2574000	Have been a great support of OLR
2574000	2576000	Especially, especially Brad
2576000	2578000	And the support that he's given
2578000	2580000	These projects here at OLR
2580000	2582000	He supports Horde House in a huge way
2582000	2584000	Like he helped set up the website
2584000	2586000	And get that show hosted
2586000	2588000	At Horde House
2588000	2590000	So I'm so appreciative for that
2590000	2592000	The microphones that we use here now at OLR
2592000	2594000	Were kind of handed down from
2594000	2596000	Brad from Pod Culture
2596000	2598000	So yeah, they've just been such a great support
2598000	2600000	And they're squishy
2600000	2602000	And they're squishy
2602000	2604000	With the little foamy hats, yes they are
2604000	2606000	They're squishy, mine's red, I like it
2606000	2608000	It's for our listeners protection
2608000	2610000	That's right, that's right
2610000	2612000	So yeah, I just want to say a big thank you and congratulations
2612000	2614000	Because 400 is an epic milestone
2614000	2616000	I remember when you were just a wee hundred and fifty
2616000	2618000	Alright
2618000	2620000	There you go, so congrats to all those guys
2620000	2622000	Over there at Pod Culture
2622000	2624000	To register participation
2624000	2626000	For this week's episode of Orange Launch Radio
2626000	2628000	At vognetwork.com
2629000	2631000	Alright, let's start with the gaming news tonight
2631000	2633000	Loki, please, if you would, start us off with the news
2633000	2635000	Well, you know, one of the
2635000	2637000	Taglines for the Playstation 3
2637000	2639000	Uh, this generation was
2639000	2641000	It only does, and then they list a ton of shit
2641000	2643000	Well, this week they decided to put out a fact
2643000	2645000	Or, they being Sony
2645000	2647000	They decided to put out a fact
2647000	2649000	Outlining the stuff that the Playstation 4
2649000	2651000	Won't do
2651000	2653000	And that includes a few things at launch
2653000	2655000	Which, you know, of course you're gonna have to update
2655000	2657000	Your system and stuff
2657000	2659000	It's gonna lack DLNA support
2659000	2661000	So you're not really gonna be able to
2661000	2663000	Stream stuff from media servers too easily
2663000	2665000	Also, no support
2665000	2667000	It doesn't feature a music visualizer
2667000	2669000	And that's
2669000	2671000	Probably because it doesn't play any CDs
2671000	2673000	And also
2673000	2675000	Dynamic themes are not supported
2675000	2677000	Which makes sense because it kind of
2677000	2679000	Changed the whole user interface anyways
2679000	2681000	And MP3 playback
2681000	2683000	Is not gonna happen
2683000	2685000	And if you want to
2685000	2687000	Listen to music
2687000	2689000	Or see videos or that kind of thing
2689000	2691000	You can do that through
2691000	2693000	Sony Musics
2693000	2695000	With their unlimited service
2695000	2697000	And video unlimited service
2697000	2699000	You know, actually
2699000	2701000	Here's the thing
2701000	2703000	I'm not entirely sure that you can't stream stuff
2703000	2705000	To your PS4
2705000	2707000	Because I remember the Wii
2707000	2709000	Had that kind of problem too
2709000	2711000	Where you couldn't stream stuff
2711000	2713000	But they had a lot of services set up
2713000	2715000	And it creates a web page on your network
2715000	2717000	And you just do it through the web browser
2717000	2719000	So there might be a work around
2719000	2721000	But that's essentially a hack
2721000	2723000	I mean, not like a hack
2723000	2725000	Like you think we gotta do it
2725000	2727000	But it's a work around
2727000	2729000	It's still annoying that they did that
2729000	2731000	And the other thing they were saying too
2731000	2733000	The PlayStation 4 share button
2733000	2735000	Record capabilities
2735000	2737000	Apparently that is gonna be
2737000	2739000	Kind of limited to
2739000	2741000	Twitch
2741000	2743000	They're gonna upload videos to YouTube
2743000	2745000	And um
2745000	2747000	Yeah but couldn't you just export your video to Twitch
2747000	2749000	And then publish it to YouTube
2749000	2751000	Like that's what I would think you would just be able to do
2751000	2753000	Well right now it says all the archiving's gonna be done
2753000	2755000	Through um
2755000	2757000	Twitch
2757000	2759000	Yeah it's very easy on Twitch to take an archive and post it to YouTube
2759000	2761000	That's how I got like the House of the Dead things on YouTube now
2761000	2763000	So I don't know
2763000	2765000	I don't think that's a big deal
2765000	2767000	They have to have something in place if they want to protect
2767000	2769000	Whatever they're doing
2769000	2771000	That makes sense
2771000	2773000	They're also saying Ustream footage will not be saved for later playback
2773000	2775000	So whatever
2775000	2777000	Um
2777000	2779000	The other thing I was gonna mention
2779000	2781000	One of the things actually when Bobby was talking about on the show
2781000	2783000	And I had mentioned on the show
2783000	2785000	Rob said, hey stay there for the show
2785000	2787000	My thoughts about the MP3 playback
2787000	2789000	Cause it kinda sucks
2789000	2791000	And you know I've been seeing the conspiracy theory out there
2791000	2793000	Where they're like, well they're just trying to get people to
2793000	2795000	Participate in Sony's music unlimited service
2795000	2797000	Or something like that
2797000	2799000	And there's probably another reason behind it
2799000	2801000	If you think about it
2801000	2803000	First off they have to build it in the game
2803000	2805000	So that you know to have MP3 playback
2805000	2807000	But let's just assume that it works with games
2807000	2809000	Kind of like how it does now
2809000	2811000	When you're doing the streaming
2811000	2813000	And granted they could probably create a way to
2813000	2815000	I mean filter it out
2815000	2817000	But let's say they can't
2817000	2819000	So when you're doing your streaming
2819000	2821000	With your share button and all that stuff
2821000	2823000	There's possibility that licensed music is gonna be
2823000	2825000	Part of the audio that's on that
2825000	2827000	And so maybe to get around that
2827000	2829000	That's why you can't do MP3's anymore
2829000	2833000	Because if you have the Sony music unlimited stuff
2833000	2835000	That stuff's licensed by Sony
2835000	2837000	Perhaps they've licensed it for broadcast
2837000	2839000	And you know if it's in your video
2839000	2841000	Or whatever that you've made
2841000	2843000	It's not such a big deal
2843000	2845000	It's a very interesting thought
2845000	2847000	I should probably just throw out there
2847000	2849000	The point that there are many streams
2849000	2851000	On Twitch TV today
2851000	2853000	Where the person's playing Warcraft
2853000	2855000	Or League of Legends
2855000	2857000	And they're listening to iTunes in the background
2857000	2859000	So you do hear licensed music go out through Twitch TV
2859000	2861000	All the time and it's kind of a gray area
2861000	2863000	And Twitch kind of says I think in their legal fact
2863000	2865000	And I'm going off my memory so I apologize if I'm wrong
2865000	2867000	Or misrepresenting
2867000	2869000	But I want to say it just kind of says
2869000	2871000	You know we don't really
2871000	2873000	We consider it kind of like fair use or whatever
2873000	2875000	As long as they don't complain about it
2875000	2877000	Type of thing
2877000	2879000	They have no reason to go out and take it down
2879000	2881000	Because it's just part of a broadcast
2881000	2883000	So it's kind of a gray area right now
2883000	2885000	But I think that's an interesting perspective
2885000	2887000	Sony as a record label
2887000	2889000	As well as this
2889000	2891000	Maybe has a vested interest in not having you
2891000	2893000	Be able to stream your music
2893000	2895000	And it could be that they are just trying to sell more subscriptions
2895000	2897000	To Music Unlimited but let's be honest
2897000	2899000	If I have a PlayStation 4
2899000	2901000	I don't think I need to really
2901000	2903000	Necessarily do that
2903000	2905000	Oh the other thing too is it's not going to support USB
2905000	2907000	Hard drive support or memory sticks
2907000	2909000	At launch
2909000	2911000	I don't understand the reason behind it
2911000	2913000	Especially when it's something that's already in the PlayStation 3
2913000	2915000	I don't know why
2915000	2917000	But whatever the case
2917000	2919000	This is just at launch
2919000	2921000	Stuff can change
2921000	2923000	One other thing though
2923000	2925000	That's come out
2925000	2927000	Is the Xbox One will support
2927000	2929000	Playback of CDs
2929000	2931000	It will also support
2931000	2933000	DLNA streaming as well
2933000	2935000	Although
2935000	2937000	There
2937000	2939000	I guess
2939000	2941000	It's a little different
2941000	2943000	MP3 playback you can't do
2943000	2945000	They're saying to do that
2945000	2947000	The system I guess is set up as a Play 2 receiver
2947000	2949000	And that means you can
2949000	2951000	Use your Windows 7
2951000	2953000	Or Windows 8 PC
2953000	2955000	Or Windows Phone
2955000	2957000	I guess just stream to it
2957000	2959000	Kind of like the Windows Media Center
2959000	2961000	Buy our products
2961000	2963000	Basically yeah it's kind of locked into that
2963000	2965000	So
2965000	2967000	I don't know I mean that's kind of annoying
2967000	2969000	But
2969000	2971000	Whatever the reasons
2971000	2973000	It is a little disappointing
2973000	2975000	That you can't
2975000	2977000	Out of the box use it as a media server
2977000	2979000	Or something like that because that's why I use my PlayStation 3 for a lot
2979000	2981000	But I guess their thoughts
2981000	2983000	Would be oh well just use your
2983000	2985000	PlayStation 3 for that or buy a PlayStation 3
2985000	2987000	For that specific purpose
2987000	2989000	It's still annoying
2989000	2991000	And hopefully later on maybe a year
2991000	2993000	From now or hey whenever I decide to actually buy
2993000	2995000	A console because I'm definitely not getting one launch
2995000	2997000	That these features will be added
2997000	2999000	Back in so
2999000	3001000	I think it's just it's a matter of time
3001000	3003000	Especially if people complain about it enough
3003000	3005000	They are listening so
3005000	3007000	It could change
3007000	3009000	Some comments from our chat room live.vognetwork.com
3009000	3011000	PKJunior92 says I would think it would be
3011000	3013000	Super easy to just not allow anything
3013000	3015000	Playing locally to stream
3015000	3017000	I would think too
3017000	3019000	They are rushing to
3019000	3021000	This stuff is kind of in rush mode right now
3021000	3023000	Maybe that's kind of like okay let's not worry
3023000	3025000	About that right now let's just
3025000	3027000	Do this and then we'll fix it later
3027000	3029000	My thought with that is
3029000	3031000	That they might also be managing it
3031000	3033000	Some of the similar way that
3033000	3035000	I've been using live stream lately
3035000	3037000	For a lot of my drawing stuff
3037000	3039000	And you actually can choose what channels
3039000	3041000	You have input into your stream
3041000	3043000	So I mean they probably have
3043000	3045000	Like maybe a channel selector of some sort
3045000	3047000	Brad from Pop Culture says
3047000	3049000	It's better to not have features to start out
3049000	3051000	And then add later
3051000	3053000	Versus launch with features that get taken away
3053000	3055000	Like other OS on Playstation 3
3055000	3057000	That is very much the truth
3057000	3059000	Very much the truth
3059000	3061000	Alright well let's move on with some other stories
3061000	3063000	This is
3063000	3065000	I have no better way to put this
3065000	3067000	And this is the tweet that was heard
3067000	3069000	Around the world this week
3069000	3071000	And it was actually a
3071000	3073000	Twit longer because it was too much for one tweet
3073000	3075000	That happened and
3075000	3077000	The person who wrote the tweet
3077000	3079000	Was Mark Rubin
3079000	3081000	Who I believe he's behind
3081000	3083000	The studio that makes Call of Duty Ghost
3083000	3085000	So that's Infinity Ward right?
3085000	3087000	So he made this tweet and it says
3087000	3089000	Hey been on the road last couple weeks
3089000	3091000	So I haven't had the chance to update
3091000	3093000	But wanted to confirm that for Xbox One
3093000	3095000	We're 1080p upscaled from 720p
3095000	3097000	And we're native 1080p
3097000	3099000	On the Playstation 4
3099000	3101000	We optimized each console to hit 60 frames
3101000	3103000	Per second and the game looks great on both
3103000	3105000	Still on the road but glad to see the great
3105000	3107000	Reception to extinction can't wait for next
3107000	3109000	Week's launch
3109000	3111000	And yeah that went over
3111000	3113000	Huge because
3113000	3115000	It was a huge opportunity for people to jump
3115000	3117000	On and say oh Xbox One's
3117000	3119000	Inferior to Playstation 4 case in point
3119000	3121000	It's not just that either it's also Battlefield 4
3121000	3123000	Battlefield 4 is
3123000	3125000	900 because they do this weird
3125000	3127000	Shit where they always upscale stuff
3127000	3129000	It's been a thing that they've had on
3129000	3131000	Halo 3 and Halo 4
3131000	3133000	A lot of other games they upscale
3133000	3135000	But like Battlefield 4
3135000	3137000	720p on the Xbox One
3137000	3139000	900p on the Playstation 4
3139000	3141000	So
3141000	3143000	I mean based on those
3143000	3145000	Two games and speculating like
3145000	3147000	Crazy it sounds like the
3147000	3149000	Xbox One it's harder to get
3149000	3151000	You know
3151000	3153000	The graphics and stuff to be
3153000	3155000	Where they need to be in order to get
3155000	3157000	The performance that you have on that system
3157000	3159000	That's what it sounds like it's easier to do it on the
3159000	3161000	Playstation 4
3161000	3163000	Let me ask a couple devil's advocate questions that are important
3163000	3165000	One 720p versus 900p
3165000	3167000	Is there really
3167000	3169000	A difference
3169000	3171000	Can I really see the difference between the two
3171000	3173000	Is it that big of a deal
3173000	3175000	You'll note
3175000	3177000	Well it was hard because they did
3177000	3179000	Some side by side comparisons
3179000	3181000	But the problem is that the Xbox One version
3181000	3183000	Doesn't have a patch for some of the anti-aliasing
3183000	3185000	Stuff that they're going to have in there
3185000	3187000	So
3187000	3189000	Right now it does look more
3189000	3191000	Jaggy on the Xbox One
3191000	3193000	Is that going to change when that patch comes out?
3193000	3195000	Probably
3195000	3197000	So is it very hard to tell the difference between the two
3197000	3199000	Yeah for most people
3199000	3201000	You're not going to notice a huge difference
3201000	3203000	But you know the more detail
3203000	3205000	That you have in there especially with these consoles
3205000	3207000	Pushing more detail
3207000	3209000	You're going to notice it eventually
3209000	3211000	And also the other thing is
3211000	3213000	It's a next gen fucking game
3213000	3215000	It should be running at 1080p
3215000	3217000	In my opinion
3217000	3219000	I mean because what else
3219000	3221000	If it's running at the same resolution as a regular
3221000	3223000	Xbox 360 game
3223000	3225000	And some Xbox 360 games
3225000	3227000	Are probably running at higher resolutions
3227000	3229000	Why am I spending $500
3229000	3231000	On this fucking system in the first place
3231000	3233000	What am I getting out of it that's different
3233000	3235000	Than the Xbox 360 version
3235000	3237000	Look at our chat
3237000	3239000	At live.vognetwork.com
3239000	3241000	Rama says also if you're gaming on a 32 inch TV
3241000	3243000	You will not see the difference
3243000	3245000	Bonds006 says though
3245000	3247000	Yes there is a difference
3247000	3249000	Rama also speculates
3249000	3251000	I think that because of the usage of system memory
3251000	3253000	PlayStation 4 is using GDDR5
3253000	3255000	And Xbox One is using DDR3
3255000	3257000	That could be it
3257000	3259000	GDDR memory is for video cards
3259000	3261000	The other devil's advocate point I wanted to bring up
3261000	3263000	Is weren't we in this exact reverse
3263000	3265000	Situation last generation
3265000	3267000	And I specifically think
3267000	3269000	Of the game Oblivion
3269000	3271000	Cause I seem to remember
3271000	3273000	When that came out for PlayStation 3
3273000	3275000	People
3275000	3277000	And it came out a year after it was out on 360
3277000	3279000	And people were like it sucks
3279000	3281000	And the slowness of the blu-ray drive
3281000	3283000	Holds it back and it's graphically not as good
3283000	3285000	It's buggy
3285000	3287000	But did that really ruin the PlayStation 3?
3287000	3289000	No
3289000	3291000	So
3291000	3293000	Well I will say this
3293000	3295000	It didn't help the PlayStation 3
3295000	3297000	Get a great start out the gate
3297000	3299000	That generation. PlayStation 3
3299000	3301000	Had some really kick ass exclusives
3301000	3303000	To finally close the gap a little bit
3303000	3305000	And come out looking okay at the end of the generation
3305000	3307000	But here's the thing
3307000	3309000	Yeah they're gonna find tricks to
3309000	3311000	Make it better and stuff
3311000	3313000	But out the gate though
3313000	3315000	There is an advantage already
3315000	3317000	It's not as even as it might be
3317000	3319000	And I mean
3319000	3321000	For some people that's not a big deal
3321000	3323000	But when you're spending
3323000	3325000	$500, $400 on a new system
3325000	3327000	You're gonna be paying attention to
3327000	3329000	Every single
3329000	3331000	Especially when you're looking at games
3331000	3333000	Like if I'm looking to play Call of Duty
3333000	3335000	That's a game that's not exclusive to one of those consoles
3335000	3337000	I'm gonna be looking at every damn thing
3337000	3339000	And if it runs better on one system than another one
3339000	3341000	Like for example if I was buying a next gen system
3341000	3343000	For Oblivion or Skyrim
3343000	3345000	I wouldn't be buying a PlayStation 3
3345000	3347000	Cause it ran like shit
3347000	3349000	On the PlayStation 3 until about
3349000	3351000	8 patches later
3351000	3353000	Then it finally ran okay for Skyrim
3353000	3355000	I'm not sure if they ever fixed Oblivion
3355000	3357000	It took a long time
3357000	3359000	Well
3359000	3361000	I think
3361000	3363000	I do understand that point
3363000	3365000	Of wanting to have the capability to run
3365000	3367000	Higher
3367000	3369000	But there also I mean you gotta think about the average person
3369000	3371000	Who's gonna be able to afford having the huge
3371000	3373000	TV that will show it off
3373000	3375000	Like I mean
3375000	3377000	For me
3377000	3379000	Yeah I would want all of that
3379000	3381000	But if the average player isn't gonna have the TV
3381000	3383000	To show it off
3383000	3385000	It's still going to look great either way
3385000	3387000	More comments from our chatroom at
3387000	3389000	live.vognetwork.com
3389000	3391000	DungeonBuster says Bethesda had little experience with the
3391000	3393000	PlayStation 3 at the time too
3393000	3395000	They've gotten better though the problems with Skyrim's
3395000	3397000	DLC still point out issues they have with it
3397000	3399000	And Extover says
3399000	3401000	I say it's too early to tell, let's wait until next year
3401000	3403000	When next gen exclusives come out more often
3403000	3405000	You know that is true
3405000	3407000	These are launch games and every other generation
3407000	3409000	We've seen that you put the launch games
3409000	3411000	Next to the games that come out
3411000	3413000	At the end of the generation and you see
3413000	3415000	The progress, you see how far
3415000	3417000	You know developers learn to push the limitations
3417000	3419000	Of the system
3419000	3421000	So yeah maybe
3421000	3423000	The Xbox One lags a little behind
3423000	3425000	Here but they could catch up as developers
3425000	3427000	Learn how to work with them more right?
3427000	3429000	Let's be honest officially between the current gen
3429000	3431000	And next gen games you're not gonna see a huge
3431000	3433000	Difference especially on these multi-platform games
3433000	3435000	I mean granted they're gonna have some better physics
3435000	3437000	And stuff like ooh moving grass
3437000	3439000	Oooh you know
3439000	3441000	Leaves are rustling but you know
3441000	3443000	For a lot of people it doesn't matter
3443000	3445000	They're gonna, the majority of the copies
3445000	3447000	Of Call of Duty are gonna
3447000	3449000	Be sold on the Xbox 360
3449000	3451000	Like they are every other year
3451000	3453000	Last comment from our chat then we'll go to Dark Soccer
3453000	3455000	Story, BlackWolf says
3455000	3457000	Frames per second or FPS is more
3457000	3459000	Important than resolution anyway
3459000	3461000	A constant 60 frames a second
3461000	3463000	Outways the number of pixels on the screen
3463000	3465000	Amen I agree with that
3465000	3467000	Immensely because like I'll play Final Fantasy
3467000	3469000	14 and crappier graphics settings
3469000	3471000	Just to get it to run smooth
3471000	3473000	That's more important than it being pretty
3473000	3475000	So anyhow let's move on
3475000	3477000	We could debate this all day long as people
3477000	3479000	Have been doing on the internet for a long time
3479000	3481000	But we have a lot of show still to go
3481000	3483000	Who remembers the pocket station?
3483000	3485000	Me. Do you remember the pocket station?
3485000	3487000	I have one. I need to steal Julie's
3487000	3489000	I mean borrow Julie's. Isn't that how you
3489000	3491000	Like raised a chocobo in Final Fantasy 8 or something like that?
3491000	3493000	Hell yeah. Yeah and it also had a
3493000	3495000	Stat mode for um
3495000	3497000	What was that game?
3497000	3499000	She reads Justice Gakuen
3499000	3501000	Evolution, the rival school's
3501000	3503000	Second edition that came out on
3503000	3505000	Playstation. And it had, I don't remember if it was official
3505000	3507000	Or non-official but it had a wonderful
3507000	3509000	DDR you know
3509000	3511000	Non-stop course editor for
3511000	3513000	The fourth mix. Yes. Yes.
3513000	3515000	Well um
3515000	3517000	There was a teaser that came out
3517000	3519000	There's basically this
3519000	3521000	Four minute Playstation
3521000	3523000	Japan video
3523000	3525000	That's out that teases
3525000	3527000	The uh pocket station
3527000	3529000	Um so we could
3529000	3531000	Possibly see something
3531000	3533000	Similar to it coming out with PS4
3533000	3535000	I mean of course this is just a hint
3535000	3537000	At it. Nothing you know
3537000	3539000	Etched in stone or engraved
3539000	3541000	In metal I should say. But
3541000	3543000	Who knows? I mean
3543000	3545000	I used the hell out of my VMU on my
3545000	3547000	Dreamcast. I think I carried like three VMUs
3547000	3549000	On my keychain at one time. Cause I had my
3549000	3551000	Chow, Dan's Chow and um
3551000	3553000	Godzilla. It could make a very
3553000	3555000	Interesting iPhone or Android app
3555000	3557000	I was gonna say it's gonna be an app. It's not
3557000	3559000	Gonna be a device. It just seems very
3559000	3561000	Obvious to be a great use
3561000	3563000	For the app. I think it would be fun
3563000	3565000	Mhmm. Especially if they have the little cat
3565000	3567000	Cause I love the cat
3567000	3569000	The little uh
3569000	3571000	Mascot that's like shown up
3571000	3573000	Ever since. It would be
3573000	3575000	Awesome because you know they can
3575000	3577000	The Playstation 3
3577000	3579000	Can play the older games which I'm assuming
3579000	3581000	Is a matter of time before you see that on Playstation 4
3581000	3583000	As well. That they you know bring out
3583000	3585000	The library of old PS1 and 2 games
3585000	3587000	That would be really awesome if you could get a
3587000	3589000	Pocket station emulator on your phone
3589000	3591000	I know that might be asking too much but I think it would be
3591000	3593000	Really cool. You know what would be nice is
3593000	3595000	Using if you get that emulator
3595000	3597000	And um
3597000	3599000	They start you know bringing out
3599000	3601000	Localized games that we never saw
3601000	3603000	Sort of like how Nintendo's doing with the
3603000	3605000	Wii U. True. True.
3605000	3607000	That'd be fun. Alright.
3607000	3609000	Let's move on. Loki.
3609000	3611000	Alright. Um
3611000	3613000	So Microsoft has put out a brand new
3613000	3615000	Privacy policy
3615000	3617000	They were talking about
3617000	3619000	How they collect data
3619000	3621000	And this is mainly referring to
3621000	3623000	The Kinect
3623000	3625000	And talking about
3625000	3627000	What features they record
3627000	3629000	Basically
3629000	3631000	The Kinect camera
3631000	3633000	Actually records some information as far
3633000	3635000	As like you know your facial recognition
3635000	3637000	And stuff. But it saves that to your console
3637000	3639000	So that's actually not shared
3639000	3641000	They did say though that you could
3641000	3643000	I guess turn off
3643000	3645000	You know of course the Kinect features at any time
3645000	3647000	And the voice I guess
3647000	3649000	Commands are captured but I don't think those are
3649000	3651000	Shared. Skype though on the other hand
3651000	3653000	Well nothing's guaranteed to be
3653000	3655000	Private there. So
3655000	3657000	I guess they can get that
3657000	3659000	If you want. Which is not surprising
3659000	3661000	Cause I think they're already sharing it at the end
3661000	3663000	So anyways
3663000	3665000	And then
3665000	3667000	The thing that's kind of been the bane of my
3667000	3669000	Existence at least on the Xbox 360
3669000	3671000	Right now
3671000	3673000	They want some updated
3673000	3675000	Contact information for your safety
3675000	3677000	So like second
3677000	3679000	Ways to contact you via like
3679000	3681000	Email or
3681000	3683000	Texting you or phone calls and stuff like that
3683000	3685000	I've tried to put
3685000	3687000	My information in there a few times now
3687000	3689000	And it never fucking takes
3689000	3691000	It just says
3691000	3693000	Oh I don't have it. So now I just back out
3693000	3695000	Of it every god damn time because
3695000	3697000	I've already put that stuff in there
3697000	3699000	The website said it was confirmed
3699000	3701000	Yet it keeps nagging me for fucking information
3701000	3703000	Over and over. It'll send me the text. I'll confirm it
3703000	3705000	It even sent me the text
3705000	3707000	And I was gonna confirm it on
3707000	3709000	The Xbox 360
3709000	3711000	No sorry you have to visit this website to do that
3711000	3713000	Like then why the fuck are you nagging me through this
3713000	3715000	But yeah
3715000	3717000	So anyways now if you
3717000	3719000	I guess you could link your service account with
3719000	3721000	You know some other stuff
3721000	3723000	And you have to have some sort of like
3723000	3725000	Name, address, email and all that stuff
3725000	3727000	And that's just to
3727000	3729000	Protect the hacks and all that right
3729000	3731000	Yeah they claim
3731000	3733000	Yeah it can text you if somebody's trying to spend a lot of money or something like that right
3733000	3735000	I think it's more of like
3735000	3737000	Second way to authenticate yourself
3737000	3739000	You know cause Google does that
3739000	3741000	Now Steam does it
3741000	3743000	With emails
3743000	3745000	Makes sense I mean I appreciate
3745000	3747000	Them at least you know trying to
3747000	3749000	Protect things like especially after having money stolen
3749000	3751000	In the Xbox 360 very easily
3751000	3753000	I appreciate that they're taking the extra step
3753000	3755000	Even if it's a little sloppy
3755000	3757000	From Loki's perspective
3757000	3759000	And also you know just as a reminder
3759000	3761000	You know you probably
3761000	3763000	Want to make sure that you go to
3763000	3765000	Xbox.com and go to your account
3765000	3767000	Settings to make sure that
3767000	3769000	You opt out of all of the
3769000	3771000	Sharing of that information with
3771000	3773000	Microsoft parties and company affiliates
3773000	3775000	Resellers, distributors, etc, etc, etc
3775000	3777000	Cause I'm sure that they
3777000	3779000	Conveniently left that on
3779000	3781000	Of course, of course
3781000	3783000	Alright
3783000	3785000	Moving on to some highly controversial
3785000	3787000	News this week and
3787000	3789000	This one just really blew me away
3789000	3791000	And
3791000	3793000	Oh boy this is
3793000	3795000	We just had a comment earlier in the show
3795000	3797000	About somebody said
3797000	3799000	It's better to add a feature after the console
3799000	3801000	Comes out than to take something away
3801000	3803000	I believe that was Brad
3803000	3805000	We are seeing
3805000	3807000	This week something getting taken away
3807000	3809000	And it's Nintendo who
3809000	3811000	Disabled the swap note application
3811000	3813000	On their
3813000	3815000	3DS and it's due to
3815000	3817000	The exchange of quote
3817000	3819000	Explicit material
3819000	3821000	Now it should be pointed out
3821000	3823000	I may have overdone
3823000	3825000	It there cause they didn't disable the entire app
3825000	3827000	But they disabled the spot pass feature
3827000	3829000	Which for most people was the
3829000	3831000	App that means sending the notes through the internet
3831000	3833000	So you can no longer send pictures
3833000	3835000	Of your cats through the internet
3835000	3837000	Because some kids
3837000	3839000	Were exchanging explicit material
3839000	3841000	And I guess they just found this out
3841000	3843000	What two years after the app launched
3843000	3845000	Some users were exchanging
3845000	3847000	Offensive material
3847000	3849000	The feature was deactivated to quote
3849000	3851000	Limit the risk of any inappropriate
3851000	3853000	Activity or misuse of
3853000	3855000	A service
3855000	3857000	Further quotes from Nintendo's notice quote
3857000	3859000	Nintendo has learned that some consumers
3859000	3861000	Including miners
3861000	3863000	Have been exchanging their friend codes
3863000	3865000	On internet bulletin boards and then using
3865000	3867000	Swap note known as Nintendo letter box
3867000	3869000	In other regions to exchange offensive
3869000	3871000	Material
3871000	3873000	Nintendo has been investigating ways of preventing this
3873000	3875000	And determined it is best to stop the
3875000	3877000	Spot pass feature of swap note
3877000	3879000	Because it allows the direct exchange of photos
3879000	3881000	And was actively misused
3881000	3883000	Nintendo always wants to provide a positive
3883000	3885000	Experience for all consumers
3885000	3887000	And limit the risk of any inappropriate activity
3887000	3889000	Or misuse of a service
3889000	3891000	We feel it is important on this occasion
3891000	3893000	To take this action
3893000	3895000	We are very sorry for any inconvenience
3895000	3897000	To the many consumers who have been using this service
3897000	3899000	Nintendo will continue to work to ensure
3899000	3901000	More consumers are aware of our parental control
3901000	3903000	Features which allow parents to manage
3903000	3905000	Their children's experience on our systems
3905000	3907000	Okay
3907000	3909000	Nintendo just now learned this
3909000	3911000	Two afters after the fact
3911000	3913000	That if you give teenagers
3913000	3915000	Access to the internet
3915000	3917000	They are going to take pictures of their penis
3917000	3919000	And send it to their friends
3919000	3921000	It took you two years to figure that out
3921000	3923000	This is why
3923000	3925000	Everybody drags Nintendo
3925000	3927000	Over the fact that they don't understand
3927000	3929000	Online
3929000	3931000	This news story certainly doesn't do them any favors
3931000	3933000	I am
3933000	3935000	I am just shocked
3935000	3937000	At the
3937000	3939000	Like
3939000	3941000	I don't even know what word to use
3941000	3943000	A degree of naivety
3943000	3945000	Naive
3945000	3947000	God dammit
3947000	3949000	I keep wanting to say naivety
3949000	3951000	Because it's Christmas
3951000	3953000	Naivety
3953000	3955000	It is not remotely Christmas it's Hanukkah first
3955000	3957000	I mean Thanksgiving
3957000	3959000	But I'm just
3959000	3961000	Blown away by
3961000	3963000	Honestly
3963000	3965000	Honest to god it took you two years to get to that point
3965000	3967000	And now you're taken away
3967000	3969000	Because kids look up porn online
3969000	3971000	And yet
3971000	3973000	You leave the internet browser
3973000	3975000	Which you've made, I'm sure you've made
3975000	3977000	Terrible on purpose
3977000	3979000	The first thing I did when I saw this news story
3979000	3981000	Is I went to my DS browser
3981000	3983000	I pulled up gay porn
3983000	3985000	And I took a picture of it and put it on Twitter saying
3985000	3987000	Well Nintendo didn't really remove the porn from my DS
3987000	3989000	Now did they?
3989000	3991000	But they removed the child porn
3991000	3993000	Well what is it
3993000	3995000	That I told Bobby
3995000	3997000	When he tasked
3997000	3999000	The shows over to us
3999000	4001000	There are two things you can have
4001000	4003000	On a device the moment it comes out
4003000	4005000	And that's porn in Linux
4005000	4007000	It's true
4007000	4009000	I just
4009000	4011000	I was talking
4011000	4013000	I was at a fun little party last night
4013000	4015000	Which is why I'm a little hungover today
4015000	4017000	I was at a fun little party last night with Captain Spike
4017000	4019000	From Game Buoy and Slidekick was there
4019000	4021000	We love those guys
4021000	4023000	Matt or Grandpa from Hoardhouse was there
4023000	4025000	So some podcasting friends and some other people
4025000	4027000	Were all at this party
4027000	4029000	Spike and I were talking about this a lot
4029000	4031000	Spike's a big Nintendo fan and I understand why
4031000	4033000	Nintendo does make some great games
4033000	4035000	As I said earlier
4035000	4037000	The game I'm most looking forward to this holiday season
4037000	4039000	Is a Nintendo game
4039000	4041000	A Nintendo game in many ways to find last generation
4041000	4043000	He was throwing out a theory
4043000	4045000	That maybe this has to do with the 2DS
4045000	4047000	The fact that the 2DS is marketed
4047000	4049000	A bit more towards children
4049000	4051000	Because Nintendo is more actively
4051000	4053000	Pursuing the kid market
4053000	4055000	And they have to pay a little more attention to
4055000	4057000	What kids can actually do with the device
4057000	4059000	And although I totally understand that point
4059000	4061000	And respect it
4061000	4063000	There's a part of me that goes
4063000	4065000	Well god damn it
4065000	4067000	When are we going to put some onus on the parents
4067000	4069000	Because a kid doesn't walk into Toys R Us
4069000	4071000	And plop down $130 on a 2DS
4071000	4073000	Somebody drove them there if they do
4073000	4075000	There is a lot of irresponsibility on the part of parents I think
4075000	4077000	So put the 2DS in a giant envelope
4077000	4079000	That says parental warning
4079000	4081000	In big red letters
4081000	4083000	To disable internet
4083000	4085000	On this device
4085000	4087000	But you know the thing
4087000	4089000	And this goes a little bit into marketing too
4089000	4091000	Is that when you have a system
4091000	4093000	With a warning label on it
4093000	4095000	You have a chance
4095000	4097000	That a parent is going to
4097000	4099000	Just see the warning
4099000	4101000	And go oh well I don't want to do this
4101000	4103000	Risk it's easier not to deal with it
4103000	4105000	Than have to work for it
4105000	4107000	I've got too much else on my plate with my kid
4107000	4109000	Or how can I watch everything all the time
4109000	4111000	It's better just to not get it
4111000	4113000	I see it that way too
4115000	4117000	And here's the other interesting thing
4117000	4119000	Swapnote for all practical purposes
4119000	4121000	I think is one of the more innocent applications
4121000	4123000	I love to use it for cat pics
4123000	4125000	And writing little notes
4125000	4127000	I get excited about
4127000	4129000	Seeing the stuff that comes through
4129000	4131000	Meanwhile they've shut this down
4131000	4133000	But guess what still works on my Wii U
4133000	4135000	Video chat
4135000	4137000	So right at this moment
4137000	4139000	I could go on and I could call
4139000	4141000	Whoever's on their Wii U right now
4141000	4143000	And I could say hey look at this
4143000	4145000	And pull down my pants and show them my balls
4145000	4147000	I mean is Nintendo
4147000	4149000	Going to shut down the video chat too
4149000	4151000	Because heaven forbid
4151000	4153000	A child unsupervised
4153000	4155000	Uses the device because the parents were too lazy
4155000	4157000	To enable parental controls
4157000	4159000	And starts showing their goods
4159000	4161000	To predators
4161000	4163000	Which again
4163000	4165000	I'm not
4165000	4167000	Don't misunderstand me
4167000	4169000	That's the terrible thing
4169000	4171000	And people who prey on kids like that
4171000	4173000	Should have horrible horrible things done to them
4173000	4175000	But I think there has to be responsibility
4175000	4177000	On the parents part
4177000	4179000	That if you put a device like this in the home
4179000	4181000	You need to watch what your kids are doing
4181000	4183000	I would like to respond to hitstun by the way
4183000	4185000	And what does hitstun say in our chatroom
4185000	4187000	At live.vognetwork.com
4187000	4189000	They just patch out photos
4189000	4191000	Well I mean it's not stopping people from
4191000	4193000	Drawing things either
4193000	4195000	And photos were the best part
4195000	4197000	So how are you supposed to share your photos now?
4197000	4199000	I like photos of pussy
4199000	4201000	What's the point of having a 3D camera on the thing
4201000	4203000	If you can't share it with anyone
4203000	4205000	Because you can
4205000	4207000	Take them off on your SD card
4207000	4209000	And email them
4209000	4211000	Swapnote came after the launch anyway
4211000	4213000	So you can technically still view them on your card
4213000	4215000	And I guess hypothetically
4215000	4217000	Yeah you could email them or something
4217000	4219000	But it really did
4219000	4221000	And I saw the word used in chat here
4221000	4223000	PKJunior92
4223000	4225000	Nintendo neutered the service
4225000	4227000	It really neutered the photography
4227000	4229000	And even Nintendo's own
4229000	4231000	You can take the screenshots
4231000	4233000	In Animal Crossing
4233000	4235000	And they touted that as a big feature
4235000	4237000	And how you could like
4237000	4239000	I'll be honest
4239000	4241000	I've done one screencap through Swapnote
4241000	4243000	And all the rest of them I pulled off my SD card
4243000	4245000	And put on my Tumblr
4245000	4247000	I need the ones that are on my
4247000	4249000	Fan page on Facebook
4249000	4251000	I took those
4251000	4253000	On my game
4253000	4255000	And just copied them over
4255000	4257000	Because they come across as I believe as JPEGs
4257000	4259000	If you don't use the 3D mode
4259000	4261000	Alright so
4261000	4263000	There you go
4263000	4265000	I'm just very disappointed in this news
4265000	4267000	It's like every time you think
4267000	4269000	Nintendo gets it
4269000	4271000	They don't
4271000	4273000	Oh by the way
4273000	4275000	There's an app called WeKaraokeU
4275000	4277000	And I don't believe that's here in the US
4277000	4279000	I think that's something that's only available in Japan
4279000	4281000	Because you know
4281000	4283000	Karaoke is a little bigger overseas
4283000	4285000	WeSing or something
4285000	4287000	I don't think that has any karaoke in it
4287000	4289000	Yeah but there's this WeKaraokeU app
4289000	4291000	And by the way this app contains mature language
4291000	4293000	Songs in it
4293000	4295000	There was some tweet that was going around that was really funny
4295000	4297000	Where it shows the little me in it singing
4297000	4299000	We fucking in the bed
4299000	4301000	We fucking on the floor
4301000	4303000	I don't know what song that is but it's just really funny
4303000	4305000	Sure that's not a Lily Allen song
4305000	4307000	You know Reddit's blowing up with all this
4307000	4309000	So it's just
4309000	4311000	And people are just making a point out of this
4311000	4313000	It's like Nintendo
4313000	4315000	You still can do many adult things
4315000	4317000	If you want to with your console
4317000	4319000	It's JoySound is the
4319000	4321000	Karaoke thing
4321000	4323000	And if I remember correctly I do believe a JoySound game has come out over here
4323000	4325000	For the Wii
4325000	4327000	I don't believe it's on the Wii U yet
4327000	4329000	I think I remember that
4329000	4331000	But it's just
4331000	4333000	It's a little ridiculous
4333000	4335000	And unfortunately just you know
4335000	4337000	Extenuates the reason why Nintendo
4337000	4339000	Constantly gets ridiculed
4339000	4341000	For not understanding online
4341000	4343000	And this doesn't make me feel a little more comfortable about their situation
4343000	4345000	Sorry to say
4345000	4347000	Alright
4347000	4349000	Let's move on
4349000	4351000	With more news, DarkSakura
4351000	4353000	You know I feel a little bit like
4353000	4355000	I don't want to take from
4355000	4357000	Bobby's interview earlier
4357000	4359000	Think of it as giving him a cheap plug
4359000	4361000	Yeah so I'm actually gonna say
4361000	4363000	Hey everyone if you want more of the information
4363000	4365000	On this make sure that you go listen to Bobby's show
4365000	4367000	Which you can download on iTunes and blah blah blah
4367000	4369000	And blognetwork.com
4369000	4371000	So but I am gonna go ahead
4371000	4373000	And tell you what happened
4373000	4375000	And there's a
4375000	4377000	A company called Wadjet Eye
4377000	4379000	And that's
4379000	4381000	W-A-D-J-E-T and I love
4381000	4383000	Companies with mythological names
4383000	4385000	Just cool
4385000	4387000	So anyway
4387000	4389000	There was a game put out called
4389000	4391000	And it was put out for free
4391000	4393000	There were codes that you could download to play the game
4393000	4395000	Well people were taking those free codes
4395000	4397000	And setting them up to resell them
4397000	4399000	Which I think is shitty
4399000	4401000	So
4401000	4403000	Basically they just took them all down
4403000	4405000	And said well no
4405000	4407000	We don't want that to happen but
4407000	4409000	It wasn't necessarily the codes that went down
4409000	4411000	It was the page that went down
4411000	4413000	So well the link to the page that went down
4413000	4415000	So basically people were still going to that
4415000	4417000	And getting all the codes
4417000	4419000	So there's about
4419000	4421000	30,000 codes worth of games now that have been
4421000	4423000	Removed from Steam
4423000	4425000	And I believe it was 30,000?
4425000	4427000	Didn't he say? Yeah he said this during the interview too
4427000	4429000	That you know he just did those last
4429000	4431000	30,000 from like the time he went to bed
4431000	4433000	Cause he was up for 30 hours because of the situation
4433000	4435000	On his anniversary that's shitty
4435000	4437000	But um
4437000	4439000	But anyway um
4439000	4441000	It
4441000	4443000	It just
4443000	4445000	I'm not gonna say it baffles me that people will
4445000	4447000	Use the generosity of others
4447000	4449000	Because it happens I'm sorry
4449000	4451000	If you've got people
4451000	4453000	Who think they can make a profit off of
4453000	4455000	Other people they're going to do it
4455000	4457000	Humble Bundle all the time this happens with Humble Bundle
4457000	4459000	Which is why that changed
4459000	4461000	Yeah we talked about it on the show that people are eBay-ing
4461000	4463000	Their codes on the Humble Bundle
4463000	4465000	To people that don't know any better
4465000	4467000	It's really tacky
4467000	4469000	It's
4469000	4471000	I wouldn't just say tacky
4471000	4473000	It's I would put it up
4473000	4475000	In the realm of purely unethical
4475000	4477000	We just have
4477000	4479000	This faction of greedy people
4479000	4481000	Which I'm not going to go into detail on that one
4481000	4483000	Um
4483000	4485000	But I think that it was
4485000	4487000	What
4487000	4489000	What Dave Gilbert did
4489000	4491000	That was who Bobby interviewed before
4491000	4493000	I think that was purely necessary
4493000	4495000	I think it was the right step to take under the situation
4495000	4497000	And yeah there's people pissed off about it
4497000	4499000	But
4499000	4501000	Look at it as
4501000	4503000	The rotten apple spoiling the bunch
4503000	4505000	You have a lot of bad apples
4505000	4507000	Spoiling all of it
4507000	4509000	For everybody
4509000	4511000	So if you want to be mad at anybody
4511000	4513000	Be mad at the people that were abusing the system
4513000	4515000	Not at the person who was the victim of the abuse
4517000	4519000	Yeah I and
4519000	4521000	One interesting thing we learned from all this too is that
4521000	4523000	Steam can pull games from the library I thought that was interesting
4523000	4525000	We haven't really heard of a case of that happening before
4525000	4527000	But he does talk in his interview with Bobby about
4527000	4529000	You know the ethics
4529000	4531000	Behind doing that and that you know
4531000	4533000	You don't want to abuse something like that or Steam's never
4533000	4535000	Going to let you sell games or want to work with you again
4535000	4537000	So I thought that was very interesting
4537000	4539000	And there was another point with people
4539000	4541000	Being angry because they couldn't get their game
4541000	4543000	On Steam
4543000	4545000	But that doesn't stop you
4545000	4547000	From linking your game with your Steam account
4547000	4549000	You can still run everything through Steam if you want
4549000	4551000	Your functionality of Steam with your game
4551000	4553000	How do you think I get all those pretty cut scene
4553000	4555000	Screen caps of Final Fantasy 14
4555000	4557000	Right
4557000	4559000	Alright well let's travel around the world
4559000	4561000	And check out some release dates
4561000	4563000	That you can buy
4563000	4565000	And then you can resell if you want
4565000	4567000	Because it's a little more ethical
4567000	4569000	When you actually bought it in the first place
4569000	4571000	But anyway let's travel around the world and check out release dates
4571000	4573000	And what's coming out soon
4573000	4575000	Alright so this week we have Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures
4575000	4577000	On 3DS

4593000	4595000	Wii U and PC
4595000	4597000	Because you know
4597000	4599000	You gotta be cool
4599000	4601000	And get those Playstation 4 discs
4601000	4603000	A week before they come out
4603000	4605000	Hey look I got this game
4605000	4607000	I'm totally gonna not play it for a week
4607000	4609000	So it's gonna take some getting used to
4609000	4611000	That now we have to throw in Playstation 4 releases into the mix
4611000	4613000	But I guess this happened before with Wii U
4613000	4615000	Zumba Fitness World Party
4615000	4617000	On the Wii U, Xbox 360
4617000	4619000	And Wii

4631000	4633000	Wii, Wii U and 3DS
4637000	4639000	Frozen on the DS
4639000	4641000	And 3DS
4641000	4643000	And
4643000	4645000	Last but not least
4645000	4647000	Um
4647000	4649000	The Travel Adventures with Hello Kitty
4649000	4651000	On 3DS
4651000	4653000	Oh yay
4653000	4655000	And the game stick
4655000	4657000	I sure know what I'm getting Rob
4657000	4659000	No no no hold off
4659000	4661000	You gotta wait for Hello Kitty Cruisers
4661000	4663000	Or whatever that was
4663000	4665000	The Mario Kart-esque game
4665000	4667000	Oh yeah right
4667000	4669000	That'll be fun
4669000	4671000	20 bucks
4671000	4673000	Rob I think you're worth at least 20 bucks
4673000	4675000	Alright I'm covered for Hanukkah
4675000	4677000	Alright
4677000	4679000	Alright let's move on
4679000	4681000	Going to Japan I would read Playstation 4 dates
4681000	4683000	But remember they're not getting theirs until next year
4683000	4685000	So we still have a little while before we start
4685000	4687000	Getting those dates in Japan
4687000	4689000	But we can read what's going on on the Playstation 3
4689000	4691000	And coming out on November 7
4691000	4693000	We have Akiba's Trip 2
4693000	4695000	Battlefield 4
4695000	4697000	Book of Spells
4697000	4699000	2K14
4699000	4701000	And Oni Chambara Z Kagura
4701000	4703000	With No No No
4703000	4705000	Comes out
4705000	4707000	Oh Rocksmith 2014 X4 will be happy to hear
4707000	4709000	That Rocksmith 2014 get exposed to Japan
4709000	4711000	As well
4711000	4713000	It's going to be big in Japan
4713000	4715000	Is it big in Japan? I don't know how well
4715000	4717000	Music games are still doing in Japan
4717000	4719000	Was Rockband and those other games really
4719000	4721000	Selling in Japan?
4721000	4723000	Rockband I don't remember
4723000	4725000	I think they did get a release
4725000	4727000	Well regardless
4727000	4729000	If you happen to have a friend
4729000	4731000	In Japan who wants to learn how to play the guitar
4731000	4733000	Rocksmith 2014 is out this week on November 7
4733000	4735000	Oh my god you know what I'm suddenly
4735000	4737000	Thinking of in my mind
4737000	4739000	Rockband Visual K Edition
4739000	4741000	Where it's all like
4741000	4743000	Malismizer and
4743000	4745000	I don't think they localize the music
4745000	4747000	Or anything when they put it out there
4747000	4749000	I just think it would be fun
4749000	4751000	Alright so there are some price reductions
4751000	4753000	As well in games like Tekken Tag Tournament 2
4753000	4755000	But I want to get to the
4755000	4757000	Xbox 360 and some of the games coming out there
4757000	4759000	Battlefield 4 is out there as well
4759000	4761000	And NBA 2K14
4761000	4763000	And Rocksmith 2014 out in Japan
4763000	4765000	This week as well on the Xbox 360
4765000	4767000	Going to the Playstation Vita
4767000	4769000	Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Battle
4769000	4771000	Destiny gets a price reduction
4771000	4773000	It's already out, but there is a new game called
4773000	4775000	X-Tetra
4775000	4777000	Comes out this week on the Playstation Vita
4777000	4779000	Going to the Wii U this week
4779000	4781000	Nothing
4781000	4783000	But you do get Call of Duty Ghost
4783000	4785000	Next week since we'll be here next week
4785000	4787000	And Super Mario 3D World
4787000	4789000	In a couple weeks, I guess I'll be touching on that
4789000	4791000	Again when we come back
4791000	4793000	And on the Nintendo 3DS this week
4793000	4795000	Metal Max 4 Gekko no D.Va
4795000	4797000	X-Tetra
4797000	4799000	Comes out there as well
4799000	4801000	And there is a Monster Hunter 4 Hunter Pack
4801000	4803000	Limited Console Bundle out this week
4803000	4805000	As well
4805000	4807000	There's also another Tamagotchi game
4807000	4809000	Seishun no Dream School comes out
4809000	4811000	On the 3DS this week
4811000	4813000	And that does it for Japanese releases
4813000	4815000	Dark Sakura, how about the UK?
4815000	4817000	There's a few things in the UK
4817000	4819000	On the 6th we have Call of Duty Ghost
4819000	4821000	For practically everything
4821000	4823000	And Castle Storm for the Sony consoles
4823000	4825000	On the 7th is Wii Sports Club
4825000	4827000	And the 8th is Mario & Sonic
4827000	4829000	At the Sochi
4829000	4831000	2014 Olympic Winter Games
4831000	4833000	The end
4833000	4835000	The end
4835000	4837000	Bobby Blackwolf bringing some clarity in chat
4837000	4839000	Blackwolf says
4839000	4841000	Rock Band Japan was a thing that failed in development
4841000	4843000	They talked about it at their PAX East panel
4843000	4845000	Licensing was a mess and they wound up
4845000	4847000	Giving up on it
4847000	4849000	I thought they got some version of Rock Band in Japan
4849000	4851000	But maybe it's just
4851000	4853000	Maybe they got our version subtitled
4853000	4855000	Yeah licensing was probably a mess
4855000	4857000	Maybe the import store
4857000	4859000	That I see Japanese releases on
4859000	4861000	Maybe they were kind of going the other way
4861000	4863000	And helping Japan get the English version if they so wanted
4863000	4865000	Because Japan imports stuff from us sometimes
4865000	4867000	Alright
4867000	4869000	Before we get to the classic game of the week
4869000	4871000	Just a few more stories for you guys
4871000	4873000	Loki
4873000	4875000	Here we thought we were
4875000	4877000	All done with the online pass
4877000	4879000	Because EA gave up on it
4879000	4881000	That was that
4881000	4883000	And
4883000	4885000	THQ went out of business
4885000	4887000	There's two companies
4887000	4889000	But nope
4889000	4891000	Ubisoft decided hey you know what
4891000	4893000	We're going to put a brand new online pass
4893000	4895000	I'm sorry
4895000	4897000	Uplay Passport
4897000	4899000	That's going to be part of
4899000	4901000	Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag
4901000	4903000	And then that not only will
4903000	4905000	Grant you access to the online
4905000	4907000	Portions of the game
4907000	4909000	But it also locks away
4909000	4911000	The game's fleet management system
4911000	4913000	That was part of the single player campaign
4913000	4915000	Now
4915000	4917000	That's not such a big deal if you're buying the game new
4917000	4919000	But of course if you're going to buy it second hand
4919000	4921000	It's going to cost you ten bucks
4921000	4923000	It's still kind of like really
4923000	4925000	You put that in there really
4925000	4927000	I mean come on
4927000	4929000	And people got pissed off about it
4929000	4931000	Well
4931000	4933000	Ubisoft decided hey you know what
4933000	4935000	We're going to get rid of it
4935000	4937000	And we're going to actually start now with Assassin's Creed IV
4937000	4939000	So they went ahead and
4939000	4941000	They're going to
4941000	4943000	Now have that code
4943000	4945000	You still have to get the code for
4945000	4947000	The Uplay Passport
4947000	4949000	But it'll be a free download
4949000	4951000	You just go to the PlayStation Network
4951000	4953000	Or the
4953000	4955000	Xbox Live Marketplace and you just
4955000	4957000	Download it and basically
4957000	4959000	It allows you to do that for free
4959000	4961000	And they're not going to have it in any future games
4961000	4963000	It says the Uplay Passport was initiated
4963000	4965000	As a means of giving the customer full access
4965000	4967000	And support for online multiplayer
4967000	4969000	And features along with
4969000	4971000	Exclusive content bonuses and rewards
4971000	4973000	However
4973000	4975000	Games today are blurring the lines between
4975000	4977000	Offline and online
4977000	4979000	And single player and wiz multiplayer
4979000	4981000	Come on man it was a single player campaign
4981000	4983000	There's no blurring anything there
4983000	4985000	And based on that
4985000	4987000	And feedback received
4987000	4989000	We recognize that the Passport is no longer
4989000	4991000	The best approach
4991000	4993000	Maybe just because people are calling you out and you're fucking money
4993000	4995000	Grubbing you know tactics
4995000	4997000	Is what it is you know
4997000	4999000	Yeah it's not the approach so now we're just going to have to
4999000	5001000	Microtransaction everything to be continued
5001000	5003000	Is basically the way I see it
5003000	5005000	So um
5005000	5007000	Good on them I guess
5007000	5009000	Now we only have to get on Warner Games
5009000	5011000	And Deep Silver
5011000	5013000	I mean seriously
5013000	5015000	What the fuck with Saints Row 4
5015000	5017000	You know I thought
5017000	5019000	We were done with that when THQ went out of business
5019000	5021000	And if it's not
5021000	5023000	Deep Silver I'm going to blame Volition
5023000	5025000	Those motherfuckers you know with
5025000	5027000	You know here I thought it was THQ
5027000	5029000	Forcing them to you know
5029000	5031000	Hoard the DLC for that game
5031000	5033000	Nope it was them
5034000	5036000	Alright well um
5036000	5038000	Before we get to the classic game of the week
5038000	5040000	This is this is I don't
5040000	5042000	Words escape me and I think a lot of us
5042000	5044000	Again here's another story
5044000	5046000	This week where a lot of us kind of looked at this
5046000	5048000	And went like how can this happen
5048000	5050000	This is awful
5050000	5052000	During this weekend a lot of folks
5052000	5054000	Out there were participating in a charity fundraiser
5054000	5056000	Known as Extra Life which is a
5056000	5058000	Video game fundraiser
5058000	5060000	It's gamers doing good which is the stuff we like to report
5060000	5062000	On it's raising money for the Children's Miracle
5062000	5064000	Network Hospital
5064000	5066000	Well during the fundraiser
5066000	5068000	The website for Extra Life came under
5068000	5070000	A DDOS attack which is
5070000	5072000	Denial of Service
5072000	5074000	Directed Denial of Service Attack
5074000	5076000	Basically meaning a bunch of people
5076000	5078000	Hitting it all at once to try and take it down
5078000	5080000	But they they and you know
5080000	5082000	I think the first thought that comes with this is
5082000	5084000	Well was it just too popular and all these people were trying to hit it
5084000	5086000	No they came out and said
5086000	5088000	We believe we were under DDOS attack
5088000	5090000	And somebody took down the charity website
5090000	5092000	For a couple of hours
5092000	5094000	And luckily they were able to get it back up
5094000	5096000	Only to have it taken down again
5096000	5098000	At 4.45 pm
5098000	5100000	I believe that was yesterday
5100000	5102000	It did come back up at 5.48
5102000	5104000	So after about an hour
5104000	5106000	But if you think about it
5106000	5108000	By the way Black Wolf says the first E is distributed
5108000	5110000	Whatever
5110000	5112000	Anyway
5112000	5114000	Whatever it stands for
5114000	5116000	It's a pretty shitty thing to do to a charity organization
5116000	5118000	Especially when it's gamers trying to do good
5118000	5120000	And you know all these people
5120000	5122000	Were trying to donate
5122000	5124000	And they couldn't through the site
5124000	5126000	Because everybody that's doing the stream is trying to point people to the site
5126000	5128000	And you know they couldn't
5128000	5130000	Make the donations
5130000	5132000	So you know obviously there was a lot of pissed off people
5132000	5134000	Online about like how could somebody
5134000	5136000	Be so shitty to take down
5136000	5138000	A charity
5138000	5140000	And I have a couple schools of thought on this
5140000	5142000	Is that one there's shitty people
5142000	5144000	Out there period
5144000	5146000	And you know just like we had an unfortunate
5146000	5148000	Horrible incident in the real world
5148000	5150000	Where a guy went and shot a guy at an airport
5150000	5152000	And shut down LAX for a few hours
5152000	5154000	Like how could somebody be that shitty
5154000	5156000	You know there are shitty people out there
5156000	5158000	And we have to do whatever we can to
5158000	5160000	You know stop these people
5160000	5162000	Whether that's through getting help
5162000	5164000	Or through you know whatever
5164000	5166000	I'm just curious
5166000	5168000	What there is to gain
5168000	5170000	From taking this down
5170000	5172000	Because I can't think there would be an internet organization out there
5172000	5174000	That would be like heck yeah
5174000	5176000	That would be rude over all these sick kids
5176000	5178000	Like who would want to take pride in that
5178000	5180000	I'm not sure
5180000	5182000	There are people who enjoy being assholes
5182000	5184000	Yes and I
5184000	5186000	I think it could be
5186000	5188000	And I don't want to sound like too tinfoil hatty
5188000	5190000	But it could honestly be a cyber
5190000	5192000	Terrorist organization
5194000	5196000	Or it could be someone who has a vested interest
5196000	5198000	In making gamers look bad
5198000	5200000	That sounds like a script kitty to me
5200000	5202000	You think it was just one crazy person
5202000	5204000	I think it's some juvenile kid
5204000	5206000	That's like hehehe
5206000	5208000	My other thought was that maybe they were trying to
5208000	5210000	Intercept the credit cards somehow
5210000	5212000	Maybe but I don't know how you
5212000	5214000	But I would think
5214000	5216000	You know again
5216000	5218000	I think this whole situation is shitty
5218000	5220000	And I feel shitty for even going here
5220000	5222000	But is it possible that somebody
5222000	5224000	Was after the credit card transactions
5224000	5226000	And somebody wanted to get all
5226000	5228000	All these instant credit card numbers
5228000	5230000	And things coming in in a very short
5230000	5232000	Amount of time people wanted access to that
5232000	5234000	You wouldn't DDoS a site to do that though
5234000	5236000	That would be like installing
5236000	5238000	A trojan or something
5238000	5240000	Or somehow getting access to their database
5240000	5242000	Or something
5242000	5244000	DDoSing something is not going to really do anything
5244000	5246000	As far as I'm aware
5246000	5248000	ActDeft quoting a movie
5248000	5250000	Saying there's people that just want to
5250000	5252000	See the world burn
5252000	5254000	And BlackWolf says
5254000	5256000	Sky the lulz
5256000	5258000	I don't think anyone's laughing
5260000	5262000	No
5262000	5264000	You know it's one thing when
5264000	5266000	You know maybe they take down
5266000	5268000	CNN.com or
5268000	5270000	Hack an LA Times article to say
5270000	5272000	Butts butts butts butts or whatever
5272000	5274000	They do
5274000	5276000	That's one thing
5276000	5278000	But you know charity organization
5278000	5280000	Raising money for sick kids
5280000	5282000	I don't think anybody's going to laugh at that
5282000	5284000	That's just a special kind of dickery
5284000	5286000	Yeah
5286000	5288000	The whole butts thing is an awesome dickery
5288000	5290000	Just macro every single
5290000	5292000	Key on your keyboard to type butts
5292000	5294000	When you type it
5294000	5296000	BlackWolf says I think the people who did it
5296000	5298000	Were laughing
5298000	5300000	I think it's important to make sure
5300000	5302000	If they're laughing
5302000	5304000	What sick individuals
5304000	5306000	Would be laughing at this particular situation
5306000	5308000	I think it's important that if
5308000	5310000	For whatever reason we know these people
5310000	5312000	We hang out with these people
5312000	5314000	We talk to these people
5314000	5316000	That we let them know they're sick
5316000	5318000	If you
5318000	5320000	Endorse this or you laugh at it
5320000	5322000	Too then that's just
5322000	5324000	Encouraging it to happen and I think you need
5324000	5326000	To kind of put your foot down and be like this is not
5326000	5328000	Okay
5328000	5330000	I think it was an attention grab
5330000	5332000	I mean seriously the reason why people
5332000	5334000	Do asshole things like that is because they know
5334000	5336000	It's going to rile someone up it's the worst kind
5336000	5338000	Of troll
5338000	5340000	It's why I don't give
5340000	5342000	PETA any attention anymore
5342000	5344000	It's why I hate
5344000	5346000	Bringing
5346000	5348000	Yeah it's a big thing and definitely needs to be spoken out against
5348000	5350000	But I also don't want to give these people the time of day
5350000	5352000	You know I'd like to think that
5352000	5354000	All of us and the people who listen to our show
5354000	5356000	Wouldn't hang around that kind of person
5356000	5358000	Right
5358000	5360000	That's why I'm not sitting here going
5360000	5362000	If you're the person that did this you're an asshole
5362000	5364000	Because I'm like no that person's not listening to this program
5364000	5366000	But I would like to think
5366000	5368000	That our listeners are decent people who have good taste
5368000	5370000	Absolutely
5370000	5372000	And definitely a
5372000	5374000	Higher level of ethics
5374000	5376000	Than these people do
5376000	5378000	But you know
5378000	5380000	It is a small world I learn that every day
5380000	5382000	And even though you might
5382000	5384000	Not know somebody directly who is involved with this
5384000	5386000	You might know someone that knows someone
5386000	5388000	So you know
5388000	5390000	Be that change
5390000	5392000	And let people know it's not funny
5392000	5394000	And it's not okay
5394000	5396000	Alright
5396000	5398000	Let's move on let's move on to happier things
5398000	5400000	Such as gaming history and
5400000	5402000	You know the things that brought us to where we are today
5402000	5404000	Every week here on the show
5404000	5406000	Dark Soccer likes to take a step into
5406000	5408000	The classic gaming vault
5408000	5410000	And find a game that she thinks hey
5410000	5412000	You kids out there you should be playing
5412000	5414000	This video game
5414000	5416000	Stop learning how to put butts on the
5416000	5418000	L.A. Times and play this
5418000	5420000	Classic game
5420000	5422000	Dark Soccer what is the classic game of the week?
5422000	5424000	The classic game of the week is Shin Megami Tensei
5424000	5426000	You'll make a lot of friends
5426000	5428000	With that choice
5428000	5430000	I'm pretty sure plus I have to say
5430000	5432000	That as I have not spoken to
5432000	5434000	My dear friend who is such a fan of this game
5434000	5436000	CatastrophicMagi
5436000	5438000	On
5438000	5440000	Steam for a while
5440000	5442000	I dedicate this one to you because you were the one who
5442000	5444000	Introduced me to the series
5444000	5446000	As in depth as I know it now
5446000	5448000	Shin Megami Tensei
5448000	5450000	Means true goddess reincarnation
5450000	5452000	And I am referring to the first one
5452000	5454000	That came out on October 30th
5454000	5456000	1992 for the Super Famicom
5456000	5458000	And it is based off of Megami Tensei
5458000	5460000	Which is a novel
5460000	5462000	Infamicom game
5462000	5464000	This one is the
5464000	5466000	First of the series
5466000	5468000	At least in the Shin Megami Tensei series
5468000	5470000	To be put out by Atlus
5470000	5472000	This one in particular
5472000	5474000	Starts off
5474000	5476000	It's a first person RPG
5476000	5478000	So
5478000	5480000	In fact it actually is a lot like
5480000	5482000	What was the series? Wizardry
5482000	5484000	So you go through different dungeons
5484000	5486000	And you have up to six characters
5486000	5488000	And it's turn based
5488000	5490000	A field of vision
5490000	5492000	So basically you walk up to the corner
5492000	5494000	You turn the corner
5494000	5496000	You have two types of characters
5496000	5498000	You have humans and demons
5498000	5500000	And you have to collect demons like pokemons
5500000	5502000	So your human
5502000	5504000	Will acquire the demon
5504000	5506000	By either negotiating, bribing, or coercion
5506000	5508000	During a battle
5508000	5510000	You have them
5510000	5512000	You can store them in your computer
5512000	5514000	And summon them for money
5514000	5516000	To use in battle
5516000	5518000	And they feed off of a secondary currency
5518000	5520000	Called magnetite
5520000	5522000	So
5522000	5524000	If your demon is defeated
5524000	5526000	In battle then they have to be revived
5526000	5528000	So like I said it's got that Pokemon element to it
5530000	5532000	It has
5532000	5534000	A
5534000	5536000	A method of controlling
5536000	5538000	Multiple demons
5538000	5540000	By calling them Akumagata
5540000	5542000	Which is demon fusion
5542000	5544000	So you can
5544000	5546000	Basically use
5546000	5548000	You can combine your demons to be
5548000	5550000	Like this powerful gestalt
5550000	5552000	You also have firearms
5552000	5554000	You have special ammo that goes with it
5554000	5556000	Melee weapons, you have armor
5556000	5558000	You have only certain things
5558000	5560000	That can be wielded by certain alignments
5560000	5562000	And as far as your demons go
5562000	5564000	Each of them have their own different statistics
5564000	5566000	Like I said it's kind of Pokemon like
5566000	5568000	They all have permanent
5568000	5570000	Abilities in this game
5570000	5572000	That changes with the later two
5572000	5574000	And they can't
5574000	5576000	Be changed at all
5576000	5578000	So with this
5578000	5580000	Your demons are
5582000	5584000	Are basically
5584000	5586000	Your tools for fighting
5586000	5588000	In the game along with your regular armaments
5588000	5590000	You have
5590000	5592000	Different types
5592000	5594000	You have
5594000	5596000	Pixies
5596000	5598000	You have angels
5598000	5600000	You have all kinds of
5600000	5602000	You have ghouls, you have all kinds of different ones
5602000	5604000	So the alignment of your demons
5604000	5606000	Are two different types
5606000	5608000	You have light neutral dark
5608000	5610000	And light neutral chaos
5610000	5612000	Or law neutral chaos
5612000	5614000	So basically it's kind of a D&D style
5614000	5616000	Alignment system
5616000	5618000	So you can have true neutral
5618000	5620000	You can have chaotic dark
5620000	5622000	Which I guess would be chaotic evil
5622000	5624000	Law is associated with God order and peace
5624000	5626000	Chaos is with you know
5626000	5628000	The devil and freedom and war
5628000	5630000	And then balance
5630000	5632000	Is the neutral one too
5632000	5634000	So your human characters also have
5634000	5636000	Alignment as well
5636000	5638000	Now I'm not gonna go
5638000	5640000	Too much into the stories basically it's demons
5640000	5642000	On earth and they're changing the balance of power
5642000	5644000	And you have to stop them
5644000	5646000	So you have your characters
5646000	5648000	You have your hero that you name
5648000	5650000	Yourself
5650000	5652000	In sort of the game
5652000	5654000	In Apocrypha there has been
5654000	5656000	A name given of Kazuya
5656000	5658000	In the Steven
5658000	5660000	Report 1
5660000	5662000	There is a heroine
5662000	5664000	Which in that same thing she was given
5664000	5666000	The name Yuka
5666000	5668000	You have a law hero, a chaos hero
5668000	5670000	You have a girl named Yuriko
5670000	5672000	You have Steven which is a disabled computer programmer
5672000	5674000	Who writes the demon summoning program
5674000	5676000	You have a character named Goto
5676000	5678000	Ozawa
5678000	5680000	You have just a bunch of characters in this game
5680000	5682000	I'm not gonna go into it but those are like the major characters
5682000	5684000	It also was imported later on
5684000	5686000	For the PC Engine Super CD ROM
5686000	5688000	And Mega CD
5688000	5690000	And then re-released for Playstation
5690000	5692000	And Game Boy Advance
5692000	5694000	To build hype
5694000	5696000	For Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne
5696000	5698000	Famitsu gave it a 30 out of 40
5700000	5702000	The original
5702000	5704000	That was the Playstation 1 by the way
5704000	5706000	The original version got a 36 out of 40
5706000	5708000	From Famitsu
5708000	5710000	There's also a manga spin-off
5710000	5712000	It's out in English
5712000	5714000	All kinds of stuff
5714000	5716000	And of course we have
5716000	5718000	So many different games now in the series
5718000	5720000	And that have
5720000	5722000	Come out in English that anyone
5722000	5724000	Can enjoy it but I do know for a fact
5724000	5726000	There's a translated ROM
5726000	5728000	Out of the first one so you can
5728000	5730000	Find it
5730000	5732000	And play it through whatever means you deem
5732000	5734000	Necessary
5738000	5740000	Is Shin Megami Tensei
5740000	5742000	Yeah sorry about all the beeping I was trying to find some better music
5742000	5744000	Because the first three YouTube
5744000	5746000	Videos I found were all like the same music
5746000	5748000	And it's happy
5748000	5750000	Well that's what the game sounded like
5750000	5752000	So there it is your classic game of the week
5752000	5754000	Shin Megami Tensei on the Super Nintendo

5888000	5890000	Up against the YouTube music awards
5890000	5892000	But apparently those were a big old
5892000	5894000	Bag of dicks
5894000	5896000	I
5896000	5898000	Yeah I heard it was going to be very experimental
5898000	5900000	And I'm sure
5900000	5902000	It went wrong but we'll see alright
5902000	5904000	Let's go back and do some gaming news
5904000	5906000	Rapid fire news here Loki
5906000	5908000	Did that one Chinese food
5908000	5910000	Song win or whatever it was
5910000	5912000	One can only hope
5912000	5914000	I mean that's what I think
5914000	5916000	Of when I think of YouTube
5916000	5918000	Best lyric of our generation
5918000	5920000	Chow ma ma ma main
5922000	5924000	Ah yes anyways
5924000	5926000	So let's talk a little bit about
5926000	5928000	South Park
5928000	5930000	South Park
5930000	5932000	Seriously what's going on with you
5932000	5934000	Delayed
5934000	5936000	To March
5936000	5938000	Unfortunately
5938000	5940000	And I was so hoping
5940000	5942000	That it would come out in December
5942000	5944000	Because there was nothing coming out in December but
5944000	5946000	Yeah
5946000	5948000	And uh
5948000	5950000	Just because it's not done yet
5950000	5952000	Really and they showed some gameplay and I
5952000	5954000	Thought it would be pretty cool
5954000	5956000	Yeah I'm very much looking forward to this game
5956000	5958000	I'm a little disappointed about the delay but
5958000	5960000	You know get it right take the time you need to get it right
5960000	5962000	Don't rush it it's fine
5962000	5964000	If it comes out finally we'll all forget about the delay
5964000	5966000	So it definitely happens
5966000	5968000	Right Grand Theft Auto fans?
5968000	5970000	Speaking of Grand Theft Auto 5
5970000	5972000	29 million fans
5972000	5974000	Have already forgiven it
5974000	5976000	And it's already um
5976000	5978000	Well they shipped that many to retail
5978000	5980000	But they pretty much sold
5980000	5982000	And that means if
5982000	5984000	And that's within 6 weeks
5984000	5986000	So couple more weeks
5986000	5988000	It will have outsold
5988000	5990000	Grand Theft Auto 4's
5990000	5992000	Time sales so that's
5992000	5994000	Not bad for 6 weeks
5994000	5996000	And last but not least
5996000	5998000	Something I'm kind of excited about
5998000	6000000	The 7th guest 3
6000000	6002000	Is going to be a
6002000	6004000	Possible game that will be coming out
6004000	6006000	Full motion video and all
6006000	6008000	The 7th guest if you're not aware is a
6008000	6010000	Pretty old PC game
6010000	6012000	It was a puzzle game
6012000	6014000	And the 11th hour
6014000	6016000	The second game in the series
6016000	6018000	They're trying to kick start a third
6018000	6020000	For $435,000
6020000	6022000	Oh my god is there a reward
6022000	6024000	Tier level where I can be in the game
6024000	6026000	In one of those cheesy full motion videos
6026000	6028000	Because it's kind of awesome if so
6028000	6030000	If I had money I would so
6030000	6032000	Want to do that
6032000	6034000	I don't know let me check
6034000	6036000	They're at $39,000 right now
6036000	6038000	And they have 35 days to go
6038000	6040000	And
6040000	6042000	It would like literally be my dream
6042000	6044000	To be one of those corny full motion video actors
6044000	6046000	In one of these games
6046000	6048000	$1,000 get your name on an object
6048000	6050000	In the mansion
6050000	6052000	$5,000
6052000	6054000	Your name and likeness in a painting
6054000	6056000	Or photograph in the mansion
6056000	6058000	You could be in the game Rob
6058000	6060000	$75,000
6060000	6062000	$75,000
6062000	6064000	Scary animated portrait
6064000	6066000	Of you in the mansion and producer
6066000	6068000	In game credit
6068000	6070000	And no there is not a way to be
6070000	6072000	An actual
6072000	6074000	An actual
6074000	6076000	Can I campaign to be
6076000	6078000	One of the cheesy full motion
6078000	6080000	Video actors in the game
6080000	6082000	You would have to like probably contact
6082000	6084000	The
6084000	6086000	Creator and just give them lots
6086000	6088000	Of money and say hey
6088000	6090000	Can I forgo all those things
6090000	6092000	That be like actually in the game as like
6092000	6094000	A character
6094000	6096000	Nice
6096000	6098000	Alright yeah so if
6098000	6100000	Anybody behind that game and that Kickstarter is listening
6100000	6102000	We'd love to get you on for an interview
6102000	6104000	Wink wink or maybe I can hassle you about being
6104000	6106000	In the game wink wink alright
6106000	6108000	I'll do it dressed as Frank
6108000	6110000	No alright
6110000	6112000	Moving on I'm being a little bit
6112000	6114000	Reductive here talking about something I already
6114000	6116000	Talked about earlier in the show but I will
6116000	6118000	Mention The Typing of the Dead Overkill
6118000	6120000	Was a surprise that was brought
6120000	6122000	Out this week Sega didn't
6122000	6124000	Really mention that they were working on it there was a
6124000	6126000	Few teasers here and there but it did come out as
6126000	6128000	A surprise so Typing of the Dead Overkill
6128000	6130000	Was released it was available
6130000	6132000	For $10 but you might have missed the sale
6132000	6134000	That was only through November 1st so now
6134000	6136000	It's going to cost you $20 but you know what
6136000	6138000	Doesn't Steam always have a
6138000	6140000	Christmas sale or excuse me a winter
6140000	6142000	Holiday sale or whatever at the end of the year
6142000	6144000	Yeah so you know if you really
6144000	6146000	It is almost December ween
6146000	6148000	Yeah if you really have to get it cheap you have that to look forward
6148000	6150000	To so but honestly
6150000	6152000	It's still worth even $20 if you want to play it
6152000	6154000	Right now good times and
6154000	6156000	Yeah there it is Typing of the Dead Overkill
6156000	6158000	It is out and I'll give
6158000	6160000	A cheap plug for my YouTube channel one more time
6160000	6162000	Rob Robert just plays and you can watch me actually play
6162000	6164000	The first hour or so of the game
6164000	6166000	Um it has been announced that the
6166000	6168000	Male Wii Fit Trainer will also
6168000	6170000	Be a playable character in
6170000	6172000	Smash Brothers for Wii U and the
6172000	6174000	3DS just like you have
6174000	6176000	I don't know you kind of have like Zelda and
6176000	6178000	And Sheik are kind of the same
6178000	6180000	But not really you know
6180000	6182000	That's what they're kind of doing with the trainers
6182000	6184000	Model swap yeah the male Wii Fit
6184000	6186000	Trainer is the exact same character as the female
6186000	6188000	One it's just like a it's a costume
6188000	6190000	Swap of sorts I am so
6190000	6192000	Looking forward to beating people up with the power of yoga
6192000	6194000	Right but now you can do
6194000	6196000	That I think it would actually be cooler if they
6196000	6198000	Just left the male trainer out
6198000	6200000	I know they're just trying to pad the roster but
6200000	6202000	Whatever yeah I don't know
6202000	6204000	It's just kind of one of those oh neat
6204000	6206000	You know yeah but it's not like
6206000	6208000	Oh well now I have to pre-order this
6208000	6210000	Knowing that I can play a male Wii Fit Trainer
6210000	6212000	Just changes everything not really
6212000	6214000	It's just kind of one of those like oh neat
6214000	6216000	Type of things and it would be kind of neat for those
6216000	6218000	2 vs 2 matches to like you know
6218000	6220000	You could play Wii Fit Trainer vs Wii Fit Trainer
6220000	6222000	But you guys actually look different
6222000	6224000	And it's not just a pallet swap that's
6224000	6226000	Kind of neat for what it is
6226000	6228000	But yeah little news piece there
6228000	6230000	And lastly a follow up to an
6230000	6232000	Interview we had a couple weeks ago you might remember that
6232000	6234000	We had the guy behind
6234000	6236000	Retro Magazine that Kickstarter was here
6236000	6238000	On the show and he's with Game Gavel as well
6238000	6240000	So Cal Mike was what he went by
6240000	6242000	And he was trying to raise the money there for Retro Magazine
6242000	6244000	And was having a little bit of a hard time
6244000	6246000	Getting coverage because
6246000	6248000	Apparently a lot of commercial websites
6248000	6250000	Won't run the story
6250000	6252000	Because it's competitive
6252000	6254000	And I guess I didn't really realize
6254000	6256000	This but it should be obvious that
6256000	6258000	In these commercial for profit
6258000	6260000	Blogs and things they literally have anti
6260000	6262000	Competitive clauses they will not run a piece
6262000	6264000	That could promote something that competes against it
6264000	6266000	That's one of the great things about the indie
6266000	6268000	World because we are the exact opposite
6268000	6270000	You know when an indie podcast asks
6270000	6272000	Me to plug them I'm like heck yeah sure
6272000	6274000	Let's help each other out right
6274000	6276000	In fact we grow more
6276000	6278000	From helping each other out than trying to like
6278000	6280000	I have no tolerance for people that try to take each other down
6280000	6282000	I have no tolerance for that
6282000	6284000	The only clause we believe in is the Santa clause
6284000	6286000	I do worship Santa this is true
6286000	6288000	But anyway
6288000	6290000	We got off on a little tangent but my point I was really trying
6290000	6292000	To make is that thanks to the
6292000	6294000	Indie scene and all the people that were helping get the
6294000	6296000	Word out about this they met their goal
6296000	6298000	Yay and I think
6298000	6300000	If I'm not mistaken they might have hit
6300000	6302000	One of their stretch goals even they really
6302000	6304000	Shot up in the last few days
6304000	6306000	Now hire me
6306000	6308000	They ended up with $75,000
6308000	6310000	All together and I believe
6310000	6312000	That was going to cover a couple of the
6312000	6314000	Stretch goals
6314000	6316000	Dang look at all these people here
6316000	6318000	I'm trying to find it
6318000	6320000	$62,000 was met meaning everyone
6320000	6322000	Gets a collectible sticker with the first print
6322000	6324000	Issue and there will be an increased page
6324000	6326000	Count yay
6326000	6328000	For me
6328000	6330000	Alright anyhow
6330000	6332000	So congrats to Retro Magazine I look forward to
6332000	6334000	Having my first issue I did back it
6334000	6336000	I kicked back like $35 or so just enough
6336000	6338000	To get the year subscription of the magazine
6338000	6340000	I look forward to having that on my
6340000	6342000	Strewn on my kitchen table
6342000	6344000	Where we table LR very soon
6344000	6346000	Along with Kid Icarus Rising and
6346000	6348000	What's that pink thing?
6348000	6350000	This man bag? No
6350000	6352000	I know what the man bag is
6352000	6354000	This is a little game called Pink Hijinx
6354000	6356000	It was in my GamerX loot bag
6356000	6358000	That I just haven't played yet
6358000	6360000	It's like this game involving little pink pyramids
6360000	6362000	I thought it was a pink Tootsie roll
6362000	6364000	No I would have eaten it
6364000	6366000	Chocolate
6366000	6368000	Less chocolate more news
6368000	6370000	Well we do have some news
6370000	6372000	There was a hack
6372000	6374000	Into the Pokemans
6374000	6376000	And there are two
6376000	6378000	Mega Evolutions were
6378000	6380000	Released
6380000	6382000	We have
6382000	6384000	Let's see what they are
6384000	6386000	It was released by Smeelum
6386000	6388000	Who created the first
6388000	6390000	Homebrew Portal game for the DS
6390000	6392000	Said that there is a Mega Evolution for
6392000	6394000	Latios and Latias
6394000	6396000	Um
6396000	6398000	They are
6398000	6400000	Ugly
6400000	6402000	Ugly mon
6402000	6404000	I don't know what they're called
6404000	6406000	But they're kind of ugly
6406000	6408000	So yeah you can look online and find them
6408000	6410000	Also there is an ESR
6410000	6412000	B rating saying that Gradius 5
6412000	6414000	Might be going to PS3
6414000	6416000	Which I freaking love me some Gradius 5
6416000	6418000	But that game is some hard shit
6418000	6420000	But that would be awesome
6420000	6422000	There is a T for Teen
6422000	6424000	Rating on it
6424000	6426000	So uh who knows
6426000	6428000	I would like to see it there
6428000	6430000	Maybe with some goodies like maybe doing Gradius 2
6430000	6432000	As a throw in you know
6432000	6434000	Because Gradius 2 is the best
6434000	6436000	And then Steam has hit a milestone
6436000	6438000	65 million active
6438000	6440000	Users
6440000	6442000	That's a lot of people Rob
6442000	6444000	That's a country
6444000	6446000	A small country
6446000	6448000	Not a medium sized country I'd say
6448000	6450000	Way to go Steam
6450000	6452000	Good job
6452000	6454000	Congrats
6454000	6456000	The winner is you
6456000	6458000	Didn't they say that's bigger than Xbox Live now
6458000	6460000	Yeah
6460000	6462000	Alright let's get to the FUGL question of the week
6462000	6464000	Ladies and gentlemen
6468000	6470000	You take Facebook
6470000	6472000	You take Google Plus
6472000	6474000	You slam those words together
6474000	6476000	You get FUGL
6476000	6478000	Which by the way I'm happy to announce
6478000	6480000	You can reach our Facebook page
6480000	6482000	At Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio
6482000	6484000	But you can now reach our Google Plus page
6484000	6486000	At Google.com
6486000	6488000	Slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio
6488000	6490000	They finally have those short URLs
6490000	6492000	And we were able to get one for OrangeLoungeRadio
6492000	6494000	It's weird though because you do slash plus
6494000	6496000	But if you've seen the Google URLs
6496000	6498000	Go to Google.com slash plus
6498000	6500000	OrangeLoungeRadio
6500000	6502000	No more disgusting sequence of numbers at the end there
6502000	6504000	So you can be our friend on Google Plus
6504000	6506000	And do those things that Google users do
6506000	6508000	And when I figure out what that is
6508000	6510000	I'll let you know
6510000	6512000	Alright let's
6512000	6514000	You answer FUGL questions of the week
6514000	6516000	That's what you do and this week's FUGL question of the week
6516000	6518000	Is probably similar to something we asked before
6518000	6520000	Admittedly when these systems were first announced
6520000	6522000	But
6522000	6524000	With us not having a show on 1110
6524000	6526000	The next time we have a live show the Playstation 4
6526000	6528000	Will be out so
6528000	6530000	This is the last unofficial poll to see what systems
6530000	6532000	Our listeners are getting this holiday season
6532000	6534000	Are you or do you plan to buy
6534000	6536000	Before the end of the year
6536000	6538000	A Playstation 4
6538000	6540000	An Xbox One
6540000	6542000	A Wii U
6542000	6544000	A 3DS or a Vita
6544000	6546000	Or something else or none of the above
6546000	6548000	And why
6548000	6550000	Did you ultimately decide the way you did
6550000	6552000	I will try to read everybody's
6552000	6554000	Answers but some of the longer ones
6554000	6556000	I'm going to cut really short
6556000	6558000	Just for time's sake because we did get a lot of answers
6558000	6560000	Tonight and I don't want to go on forever so I hope you'll
6560000	6562000	Understand and read all the answers in their
6562000	6564000	Entirety at Facebook or Google Plus
6564000	6566000	Redertainment says due to
6566000	6568000	Project Buy a House
6568000	6570000	None of the above
6570000	6572000	Soutoure says none of the above
6572000	6574000	Because the Playstation 3
6574000	6576000	Gran Turismo excuse me
6576000	6578000	Gran Turismo 6 is enough for me for now
6578000	6580000	Sam H says none of the above
6580000	6582000	I have too many current gen games
6582000	6584000	To go buy and play
6584000	6586000	E3VL says
6586000	6588000	Already pre-ordered the Playstation 4
6588000	6590000	Since it's the cheaper console
6590000	6592000	May purchase the Xbox One
6592000	6594000	After it has a price drop to play the
6594000	6596000	Exclusives
6596000	6598000	Act Def says I plan on getting a Wii U
6598000	6600000	And upgrading my PC
6600000	6602000	Why do I want a Wii U?
6602000	6604000	I think there's enough games I would actually play
6604000	6606000	Like Super Mario 3D World and Rayman Legends being the main ones
6606000	6608000	And Cyber Judge says
6608000	6610000	I planned on purchasing a Playstation 4
6610000	6612000	But with recent good and bad news I received
6612000	6614000	I'm no longer purchasing an
6614000	6616000	Next gen console in the foreseeable future
6616000	6618000	I do have a Vita I'll end up getting a
6618000	6620000	Playstation 4 when I am again able
6620000	6622000	So that was about half nothing
6622000	6624000	Half mixture of Playstation 4 and Wii U
6624000	6626000	Xbox One a little later
6626000	6628000	We got a lot of people on Facebook
6628000	6630000	Let me try to get through these
6630000	6632000	Andy R says buying a Playstation 4 at launch
6632000	6634000	Mostly because it's new and shiny
6634000	6636000	And I'm a consumer whore
6636000	6638000	That's my reason too
6638000	6640000	KJ says I preordered a Playstation 4
6640000	6642000	The timing of the release of the console
6642000	6644000	Is my main reason
6644000	6646000	I paid off the Playstation 4 little by little
6646000	6648000	Not in one lump sum
6648000	6650000	Xbox One will have to wait for a price drop
6650000	6652000	Renji2214 says
6652000	6654000	I'm thinking of getting a Wii U
6654000	6656000	For the holidays this year
6656000	6658000	I haven't seen anything that interests me on Playstation 4
6658000	6660000	Xbox One and with Super Mario 3D World
6660000	6662000	And Mario Kart 9 and the new Smash Brothers
6662000	6664000	Next year I think the Wii U has a little more
6664000	6666000	That I'd be interested in
6666000	6668000	Our old pal 23rd Magus
6668000	6670000	Or what is it, Drunami
6670000	6672000	Drunami replied and said
6672000	6674000	I know better than to buy a system
6674000	6676000	At launch, even the DS took a year
6676000	6678000	Before it had more than tech demos
6678000	6680000	X2fer, our pal from Hoardhouse
6680000	6682000	Said we're getting a Playstation 4
6682000	6684000	Already have a Wii U, no Xbox
6684000	6686000	One yet, no plans to get a 3DS or Vita
6686000	6688000	LOLU
6688000	6690000	He just threw that in there to
6690000	6692000	Kick them
6692000	6694000	Matt says other
6694000	6696000	Every year around or on Cyber Monday
6696000	6698000	I spend money that I've saved towards upgrades
6698000	6700000	To my PC
6700000	6702000	I figure if I spend a little money every year
6702000	6704000	I can keep my PC at near optimal settings
6704000	6706000	This year I'm gonna get a new graphics card
6706000	6708000	A second monitor, whatever's left over will go towards
6708000	6710000	A device to help me stream games
6710000	6712000	Our friend Sil from Girls Gone Wow
6712000	6714000	I love Sil
6714000	6716000	I love you Sil
6716000	6718000	And I love your hair, it looks so cute
6718000	6720000	She's amazing
6720000	6722000	Girls Gone Wow is on our network
6722000	6724000	Wednesdays at 9am Pacific
6724000	6726000	Noon Eastern
6726000	6728000	They're really early because in the UK it's 5
6728000	6730000	I want Sil to kidnap me
6730000	6732000	Not the other way around, I want her to kidnap me
6732000	6734000	Fair enough
6734000	6736000	Anyhow, Sil says I really want a Playstation 4
6736000	6738000	But can't afford one now
6738000	6740000	I'll wait until much later when they have newer versions
6740000	6742000	And I can get it second hand
6742000	6744000	Or perhaps I should just livestream with more cleavage on display
6744000	6746000	So I can get money
6746000	6748000	But it's important to note she put a little angry face
6748000	6750000	What do you call that line underscore line face
6750000	6752000	Like the grrr face
6754000	6756000	Unfortunately she had some ignoramus on Twitter
6756000	6758000	Say something about her livestreams
6758000	6760000	And it's like
6760000	6762000	People
6762000	6764000	Grow up
6764000	6766000	Giovedea from Anime Jam Session says
6766000	6768000	Which you can hear Tuesdays here at VOG
6768000	6770000	Says 3DS with a few games
6770000	6772000	Not interested in the Wii U
6772000	6774000	And I'll probably pick up the Playstation 4
6774000	6776000	After a price drop so I can play Kingdom Hearts
6776000	6778000	Xbox One hasn't impressed me so far
6778000	6780000	Degenerate Johnny says
6780000	6782000	3DS because of Pokémon XY
6782000	6784000	And I don't want to be pressured into getting the next gen
6784000	6786000	I still have a pile of current gen games
6786000	6788000	I haven't even touched yet
6788000	6790000	When I finish this shrink wrap pile and I'm feeling comfortable moving forward
6790000	6792000	I'll consider a next gen console
6792000	6794000	Until then, I'd rather bask in the here and now
6796000	6798000	AZHP says
6798000	6800000	None of the above
6800000	6802000	My backlog of games is so huge that I honestly don't need a new system
6802000	6804000	And none of the games are really drawing me
6804000	6806000	My friend is lending me her 3DS
6806000	6808000	So I can play Ace Attorney
6808000	6810000	But other than that, there's nothing I want to play badly enough
6810000	6812000	To buy a system at this time
6812000	6814000	Burr says
6814000	6816000	I'm getting both the Playstation 4 and Xbox One
6816000	6818000	Because I have the money to get in on this console launch party madness
6818000	6820000	I know it's not the most objectively smart thing to do
6820000	6822000	But I'm going to enjoy some enthusiasm
6822000	6824000	For the next generation for now
6824000	6826000	Well, you know, I think
6826000	6828000	That's a good way of looking at it
6828000	6830000	I know this is a lot to be spending
6830000	6832000	But I'm going to have fun with this
6832000	6834000	JVMonset also says
6834000	6836000	I'm getting both
6836000	6838000	Though the Playstation 4 had zero interesting games at launch
6838000	6840000	I believe it has potential in 2014
6840000	6842000	CriticalMyths says
6842000	6844000	I cancelled my Playstation 4 pre-order
6844000	6846000	And I'll be holding off on any new consoles until 2014
6846000	6848000	I'm too backlogged on games
6848000	6850000	For my Playstation 3, Vita, and 360
6850000	6852000	As it is
6852000	6854000	Doug T says
6854000	6856000	I'm buying the Playstation 4
6856000	6858000	My preference is Sony
6858000	6860000	I have massive Playstation 2, 3, and Vita game libraries
6860000	6862000	I'm still buying the Xbox One next year
6862000	6864000	But decided to pass
6864000	6866000	Due to Microsoft's initial stance
6866000	6868000	And then over a few weeks
6868000	6870000	Constantly changing what they were doing with the system
6870000	6872000	I don't trust their position with Xbox One
6872000	6874000	They could change their stance again
6874000	6876000	GamerGirl says
6876000	6878000	I'm not bothering to buy one until further down the road
6878000	6880000	I enjoy my Playstation 3 too much
6880000	6882000	And the first batches always have glitches
6882000	6884000	So I'm going to wait
6884000	6886000	I don't even have a Wii U
6886000	6888000	DDRDollarBill says
6888000	6890000	That's a good rule
6890000	6892000	Hitstun says
6892000	6894000	Screw all that, I want a Retron 5
6894000	6896000	I've got plenty of old games
6896000	6898000	I still have to finish
6898000	6900000	And the Retron 5 makes them look nice over HDMI
6900000	6902000	That's a very creative answer
6902000	6904000	Reginator says
6904000	6906000	I'm a ways off before I buy a next gen system
6906000	6908000	I want to replace my Playstation 3 first
6908000	6910000	If I were to buy one
6910000	6912000	I'd lean towards a Playstation 4
6912000	6914000	Fifth Dream says
6914000	6916000	I have my Playstation 4 pre-ordered with release day delivery
6916000	6918000	If I were to arrive
6918000	6920000	I've just always liked Playstation
6920000	6922000	I never got a Playstation 3 because I was required to have a 360
6922000	6924000	For a tech support job
6924000	6926000	And never saw the reason to get both
6926000	6928000	Blood Drunk says
6928000	6930000	None of the above
6930000	6932000	Going for a good old fashioned video card upgrade
6932000	6934000	PC is where it's at
6934000	6936000	And James S says
6936000	6938000	I have my Playstation 4 paid off
6938000	6940000	And I'm ready to go
6940000	6942000	As well as the special edition Zelda 3DS
6942000	6944000	And I'm going to ask for a Vita for Christmas
6944000	6946000	The reason is because
6946000	6948000	I'm simply just one giant man child
6948000	6950000	Well said
6950000	6952000	Considering I'm in a very similar position
6952000	6954000	Although I've got to admit
6954000	6956000	I'm starting to waffle a little bit on the Playstation 4
6956000	6958000	I might cancel it
6958000	6960000	Because a combination of things
6960000	6962000	I think it's the three game rule
6962000	6964000	That one of our listeners said
6964000	6966000	In their response
6966000	6968000	And just the fact that
6968000	6970000	I would really be interested in upgrading my PC
6970000	6972000	A little more
6972000	6974000	And that you start to weigh what's more important
6974000	6976000	A Playstation 4
6976000	6978000	Or being able to do more stuff on your PC
6978000	6980000	And if I look at where I really spend most of my time
6980000	6982000	Gaming, it's on the PC
6982000	6984000	Dan and I have had a similar discussion
6984000	6986000	Because I'm really working on trying to up
6986000	6988000	My own design stuff
6988000	6990000	And I need a computer that's going to handle it better
6990000	6992000	Plus I play on the PC
6992000	6994000	More than anything anyway
6994000	6996000	Just don't be surprised if you guys come back in two weeks
6996000	6998000	On the show and hear that I cancelled my pre-order
6998000	7000000	Because it's something I'm strongly leaning towards right now
7000000	7002000	It's likely going to happen
7002000	7004000	Keep in mind, buying a game at launch
7004000	7006000	Is not usually a good idea
7006000	7008000	Or a system I should say
7008000	7010000	So that's interesting
7010000	7012000	None of us are
7012000	7014000	Assuming I cancel my Playstation 4
7014000	7016000	Which is the likely case at this point
7016000	7018000	I said on this show right up until the day it came out
7018000	7020000	I'm not getting a Wii U
7020000	7022000	And then of course what happened about a Wii U?
7022000	7024000	None of us will own a next gen system except my Wii U
7024000	7026000	Does this mean we have-
7026000	7028000	That doesn't count
7028000	7030000	Wii U is not a next gen system
7030000	7032000	I'm sorry
7032000	7034000	It could be like a separate parallel
7034000	7036000	Dimension system
7036000	7038000	But it's not a next
7038000	7040000	Generation system
7040000	7042000	Regardless of where you place it or how you feel about it
7042000	7044000	This is a ride shoe compared to a Pikachu
7044000	7046000	Does this mean we have to stop doing a video game podcast
7046000	7048000	Because we're not gaming enough
7048000	7050000	To be on the cutting edge of the new generation
7050000	7052000	No
7052000	7054000	No I also
7054000	7056000	Obviously I agree with you
7056000	7058000	I have a PC I can run games
7058000	7060000	I have a PC
7060000	7062000	At least a third to half of those answers
7062000	7064000	Where people saying nope not right now
7064000	7066000	Or getting systems that are like 3DS's
7066000	7068000	And Vita's and things that are already out there
7068000	7070000	Well and Dan and I already said we're gonna wait until
7070000	7072000	There's more stuff out for it that we want
7072000	7074000	We're sitting on a $100 gift card
7074000	7076000	That we're gonna put to our-
7076000	7078000	We've decided it's going to our PS4
7078000	7080000	We're just not getting it yet
7080000	7082000	Besides I wanna make sure there's no shapes or lights of death
7082000	7084000	On anything that I'm planning on purchasing
7084000	7086000	Probably if I get a PlayStation 4 this year
7086000	7088000	It's gonna be because I got it for free
7088000	7090000	I'm not actually gonna buy one
7090000	7092000	I'll wanna get one before February of next year
7092000	7094000	When Final Fantasy XIV starts on PlayStation 4
7094000	7096000	But um
7096000	7098000	You know I don't- by then I'll have a tax refund
7098000	7100000	I can spend on it too
7100000	7102000	So it's something I have to put in perspective
7102000	7104000	So keep in mind guys
7104000	7106000	I know we've been doing this podcast a long time
7106000	7108000	And some of you have stuck by us a very long time
7108000	7110000	And I really really appreciate that but the reality is
7110000	7112000	We don't make our lives off this show
7113000	7115000	Once in a great while we are extremely lucky
7115000	7118000	To get a review copy of a game from an independent studio
7118000	7120000	Or something but the reality is
7120000	7123000	It's not like they're shipping us free consoles and things like that
7123000	7125000	So just like you have to think about
7125000	7127000	Do I have the money to spend on this console
7127000	7129000	We have to ask ourselves the same question
7129000	7130000	And sometimes the answer is
7130000	7132000	No I'd rather spend the money on a ticket to Atlanta
7132000	7134000	So I can go to Dragon Con next year
7134000	7135000	You know type of thing
7135000	7137000	Or whatever it is
7137000	7139000	Alright
7139000	7141000	Anyhow moving on
7141000	7143000	We'll do some more news and then we'll get to
7143000	7145000	Our phone calls pretty soon here
7145000	7147000	At 1877 Game OLR
7147000	7149000	You can yell at me for changing my mind if you want
7149000	7150000	Although I'm not, again
7150000	7151000	You're allowed to waffle
7151000	7152000	Again
7152000	7153000	Waffles are delicious
7153000	7154000	Waffles are fucking good
7154000	7156000	And I said here on the show
7156000	7157000	I'm not getting a Wii U
7157000	7158000	I'm not getting a Wii U
7158000	7160000	What happened that Sunday when you all came to the studio
7160000	7161000	I'm playing my Wii U
7161000	7162000	So you never know
7162000	7163000	Because you're a consumer whore
7163000	7164000	And how
7164000	7165000	Back to news, Loki
7165000	7167000	Alright so Minecraft has
7167000	7169000	Done something quite interesting
7169000	7171000	There's an update I guess is going to be coming
7171000	7173000	And it was announced at Minecon
7173000	7177000	Apparently if you have the PC or Mac version of it
7177000	7179000	You will be able to
7179000	7181000	Soon
7181000	7184000	Stream to Twitch straight from the game
7184000	7186000	And you'll be able to link your
7186000	7187000	You know
7187000	7189000	Twitch TV account
7189000	7191000	To the actual game
7191000	7193000	And it'll allow you to stream I guess natively
7193000	7196000	Which I think is kind of interesting
7196000	7198000	And of course you know
7198000	7200000	I guess you'll be able to do it on
7200000	7202000	You know the Xbox One as well
7202000	7203000	Because I think they're going to have
7203000	7204000	Twitch integration
7204000	7206000	But that's kind of something separate
7206000	7208000	Speaking of the Xbox
7208000	7210000	There is some new
7210000	7211000	DLC coming in
7211000	7212000	Yet another
7212000	7214000	Reskin of the game
7214000	7216000	Much like the Mass Effect
7216000	7218000	Minecraft mod that they had
7218000	7220000	Now they have the Elder Scrolls Skyrim
7220000	7222000	Texture set
7222000	7224000	It comes with 40 character skins
7224000	7225000	Themed menus
7225000	7226000	User interface
7226000	7227000	And craftable items
7227000	7229000	Also 20 songs from Skyrim as well
7229000	7230000	And
7230000	7231000	The best part about it
7231000	7233000	Is it comes with a pre-made map
7233000	7235000	That
7235000	7237000	I guess recreates areas of
7237000	7239000	Bleak Falls Barrow
7239000	7241000	Whiterun and Riverwood
7241000	7243000	So that's pretty sweet
7243000	7245000	That is pretty neat
7245000	7248000	I need to check out some of these themed
7248000	7250000	DLCs they have going on on Xbox
7250000	7251000	Because I know they have the Mass Effect one
7251000	7252000	I never checked that out
7252000	7254000	But the Skyrim one sounds cute too
7254000	7255000	Yeah so
7256000	7258000	I think that's pretty sweet
7261000	7263000	At some point I need to go back to Minecraft
7263000	7265000	But I'm just too busy with Grand Theft Auto
7265000	7267000	Alright
7267000	7269000	Moving on to information about Wii Sports Club
7269000	7270000	Remember Wii Sports Club?
7270000	7272000	This is the thing they're doing on Wii U
7272000	7274000	That's kind of the reinvention of
7274000	7276000	What many were saying were
7276000	7278000	The game of last generation, Wii Sports
7278000	7281000	And I had no idea about this
7281000	7283000	But there was an article
7283000	7284000	That they run called
7284000	7285000	Owada Asks
7285000	7287000	That was talking about the release of Wii Sports Club
7287000	7289000	And he said quote
7289000	7291000	I'm sorry actually this is not
7291000	7292000	Owada that said this
7292000	7294000	But this is developers behind the game
7294000	7296000	Kozo Makino and
7296000	7298000	Takayuki Shimamura
7298000	7300000	Said about Namco Bandai
7300000	7301000	Being involved in the development of this
7301000	7303000	I had no idea they were involved
7303000	7304000	But Makino says
7304000	7306000	We asked Namco Bandai Studios
7306000	7307000	To develop it
7307000	7309000	So I first participated as a coordinator
7309000	7311000	But in the end I got into just about anything
7311000	7313000	I mainly worked on the network aspect of the game
7313000	7315000	But at times I made suggestions
7315000	7317000	On how some features should turn out to be
7317000	7318000	And Shimamura says
7318000	7319000	From the middle of development
7319000	7321000	Makino-san and Suzuki-san
7321000	7323000	Were also working as full fledged planners
7323000	7325000	We did ask Namco Bandai Studios
7325000	7326000	To develop the game this time
7326000	7327000	But staff and Nintendo's
7327000	7329000	Network development and operations department
7329000	7331000	The software planning and development department
7331000	7332000	That those two are in
7332000	7334000	And EAD also chipped in
7334000	7336000	So that's kind of neat
7336000	7338000	That Namco Bandai is involved
7338000	7340000	Confirmed Pac-Man a playable character
7340000	7342000	No I'm just kidding that's not confirmed
7342000	7343000	But you know
7343000	7345000	I'm a little disappointed that Nintendo chipped in
7345000	7347000	On the network portion of it
7347000	7348000	Right
7348000	7350000	That's not exactly where they're the strongest I think
7350000	7351000	Yeah a little
7351000	7352000	Especially after this week's news
7352000	7353000	I'm a little worried about that
7353000	7356000	But if it really works
7356000	7358000	I think the idea of a Wii Sports
7358000	7360000	That's online is really cool
7360000	7361000	It's a bummer
7361000	7363000	You know they can't use that camera
7363000	7365000	To be able to like show my friend
7365000	7366000	Playing Wii Sports
7366000	7368000	Although I'm sure there'd be people out there
7368000	7370000	That'd be like look I'm gonna swing around naked
7370000	7371000	I'm doing a helicopter
7371000	7372000	Rob don't worry
7372000	7373000	This is plan B
7373000	7374000	You do understand
7374000	7375000	This is plan B
7375000	7376000	Because remember this holiday
7376000	7378000	They do have a brand new Wii U skew
7378000	7381000	That has the new Super Mario Brothers U
7381000	7383000	And you know
7383000	7384000	New Luigi U as well
7384000	7386000	If that fucking fails
7386000	7388000	And can't sell the game system
7388000	7389000	You better believe
7389000	7391000	They are going to include this
7391000	7393000	With the next skew that comes out there
7393000	7394000	To try to drive sales
7394000	7395000	Oh I'm sure
7395000	7397000	And they just dropped the price
7397000	7398000	Nintendo land pretty heavy too right
7398000	7400000	Did they drop that down to 29 bucks this week
7400000	7401000	I think happened too
7401000	7402000	Or it's coming up very soon
7402000	7404000	Not surprised the game's coming in
7404000	7406000	Yeah well if it's not the packing game anymore too
7406000	7407000	You know it's gotta
7407000	7409000	Getting its price dropped
7409000	7411000	Would really help it sell
7411000	7413000	One other interesting note
7413000	7416000	You may not want to read too much into this
7416000	7420000	But there's a Wii U exclusive trailer
7420000	7421000	That Nintendo has
7421000	7424000	It's for the 2013 and 2014 lineup
7424000	7426000	That shows Wii U exclusives
7426000	7429000	Bayonetta 2 was in the trailer at one time
7429000	7431000	It's not there now
7431000	7433000	Some people are reading into this that
7433000	7434000	Uh oh
7434000	7436000	It slipped to 2015
7436000	7437000	I don't
7437000	7438000	I don't know
7438000	7440000	I think people might be reading a bit too much
7440000	7442000	Especially the people that are saying
7442000	7444000	Oh well this means it's no longer exclusive
7444000	7445000	No
7445000	7446000	They've said many times
7446000	7447000	This game would not be happening
7447000	7448000	If it wasn't for Nintendo
7448000	7450000	And it's going to be exclusive
7450000	7451000	So um
7451000	7452000	Yeah
7452000	7454000	But uh
7454000	7457000	It could just be that there's nothing new to show
7457000	7459000	You know they want to keep the game a secret
7459000	7460000	I don't know but it wouldn't
7460000	7461000	It honestly wouldn't surprise me whatsoever
7461000	7464000	If it's going to be pushed back all the way to 2015
7464000	7465000	Wouldn't surprise me
7466000	7468000	I hope they have a strong enough 2014 lineup
7468000	7470000	To keep selling Wii U's
7471000	7472000	I'm sure they've got something under their hat
7472000	7474000	Maybe the Zelda game will be this year
7474000	7475000	They'll probably be this year
7475000	7478000	Yeah maybe the Zelda game will come out sooner than we think
7478000	7480000	I'm still thinking holiday next year
7480000	7481000	I don't think it's going to be any sooner than that
7481000	7484000	I'm pretty sure it's all hands on deck for Zelda Wii U
7484000	7485000	But we'll see
7485000	7486000	Anyway
7486000	7487000	Let's move on
7487000	7488000	Dark Sakura
7488000	7491000	Well in other news
7491000	7493000	We do have
7493000	7495000	As soon as it actually works for me
7495000	7496000	There we go
7496000	7500000	There is a new Neo Geo game coming out
7500000	7504000	We have Neo XYX for Neo Geo MVS
7504000	7506000	And yeah for the longest time
7506000	7509000	The last one out was Samurai Shadow 5
7509000	7511000	So we're starting to see new ones
7511000	7513000	It was actually done by NG Dev Team
7513000	7516000	And it is a shooter
7516000	7519000	That's their third scrolling shooter
7519000	7521000	That's going to be out on the MVS
7521000	7523000	And their fourth overall MVS release
7523000	7527000	So I watched a little bit of this earlier
7527000	7530000	And it looks pretty neat I have to say
7530000	7532000	Fun shooting game
7532000	7535000	But it's nothing SNK of course
7535000	7537000	It's always fun to hear about
7537000	7539000	New games coming out for old consoles
7539000	7541000	There's still love out there for it
7541000	7543000	I love when people do Dreamcast games
7543000	7544000	Yeah right
7544000	7546000	I want some of them still
7546000	7548000	Act Def in our chat room
7548000	7550000	Reminds me of a very obvious Nintendo game
7550000	7552000	I should have remembered for 2014
7552000	7554000	Smash Brothers
7554000	7556000	I'm sure that's a given for next year too
7556000	7557000	I think that'll finally be done
7557000	7558000	That'll be good
7558000	7559000	And Mario Kart 8
7559000	7560000	Yeah there is Mario Kart 8
7560000	7562000	Wasn't there a rumor that it is
7562000	7564000	I think the date was out there
7564000	7566000	April 25th I want to say
7566000	7568000	Now granted that was a UK date if I'm not mistaken
7568000	7571000	But isn't that later than it was originally said
7571000	7573000	And remember I said when Donkey Kong got delayed
7573000	7575000	It could have been a sign that Mario Kart was delayed too
7575000	7576000	I think they have a
7576000	7578000	They're probably going to try to
7578000	7580000	Make sure they have a release every month
7580000	7582000	So they got Donkey Kong in February
7582000	7585000	There's still no real date for
7585000	7586000	I mean
7586000	7587000	They have Wii Fit U
7587000	7588000	They have the meter out for that
7588000	7591000	But they don't actually have a physical bundle for it yet
7591000	7592000	That's been announced
7592000	7593000	Unless that's December
7593000	7595000	Because there's really nothing in December
7595000	7596000	Gran Turismo
7596000	7597000	It's your month
7597000	7599000	Oh yeah don't forget Wii U owners
7599000	7601000	If you have a balance board Wii Fit U is out
7601000	7602000	Yeah
7602000	7604000	I should check that out at some point
7604000	7605000	And if you have a balance board
7605000	7607000	You already pretty much have Wii Fit U
7607000	7609000	I mean it's only a little bit different
7609000	7611000	You have to buy a meter though
7611000	7613000	So make sure you get your fit meter thing
7615000	7617000	I'm trying to think what else there was
7617000	7618000	Smash Brothers and Mario Kart
7618000	7620000	I mean those are supposed to be some point
7620000	7621000	And then
7622000	7624000	Nintendo has a tendency though to kind of surprise us
7624000	7625000	With little things
7625000	7626000	You know and they're doing their own thing now
7626000	7627000	With these Nintendo Directs
7627000	7629000	They're not adhering to any schedule
7629000	7630000	For release of news
7630000	7632000	I mean granted they'll save some of their biggest stuff
7632000	7633000	For E3 week
7633000	7635000	But I wouldn't be surprised if they don't do a press conference
7635000	7636000	Again next year
7636000	7637000	And do what they did this year
7637000	7638000	So anyway
7638000	7640000	Let's move on with some other news
7641000	7642000	Alright
7642000	7643000	Logie
7643000	7644000	Final Fantasy XIV
7644000	7646000	Doing pretty well now that they
7646000	7647000	Rebooted
7647000	7648000	Has it gone up a level?
7648000	7649000	Yes
7649000	7650000	Yes I'd say
7650000	7652000	1.5 million registered accounts
7654000	7655000	That's not bad
7655000	7656000	I'd say that's worth
7656000	7657000	You know
7657000	7658000	The reboot
7658000	7660000	Dark Soccer is doing the Final Fantasy 1 victory animation
7660000	7661000	With the hands
7661000	7662000	Up and down
7662000	7663000	Do do do do do
7663000	7664000	You know what just went into my head
7664000	7665000	Was the Brentalfloss thing
7665000	7666000	You just got pwned
7666000	7667000	FTW
7670000	7671000	So yeah
7671000	7672000	That's cool
7672000	7673000	And definitely I think it'll be neat
7673000	7674000	When the PlayStation
7674000	7675000	They say the PlayStation 4
7675000	7677000	Beta version is playing
7677000	7679000	I guess the same day as the Japanese PlayStation 4
7679000	7680000	So
7680000	7681000	February
7681000	7682000	Yep
7682000	7683000	Cool
7683000	7684000	Very cool
7684000	7685000	Yeah
7685000	7686000	We just heard not that long ago
7686000	7687000	There was a million Final Fantasy XIV
7687000	7689000	So it's going up in subscribers
7690000	7691000	That's gonna
7691000	7692000	You know
7692000	7693000	That's gonna make this year's BlizzCon
7693000	7694000	Very interesting
7694000	7695000	Because you know
7695000	7696000	There's a little
7696000	7697000	You know
7697000	7698000	This MMO
7698000	7699000	Final Fantasy XIV
7699000	7700000	Has still got some steam behind it
7700000	7701000	Now granted
7701000	7702000	You had Star Wars
7702000	7703000	And you had
7703000	7704000	Rift
7704000	7705000	And you know
7705000	7706000	Some of these other ones too
7706000	7707000	But
7707000	7708000	You know
7708000	7709000	Blizzard
7709000	7710000	I wonder if they're starting to feel the pressure this year
7710000	7711000	There's a lot of pressure
7711000	7714000	To make or break World of Warcraft this year
7714000	7715000	With this next expansion
7715000	7717000	Eventually the bubble's gotta burst
7717000	7718000	Yeah
7718000	7719000	It does for everything
7719000	7720000	Well some have said it
7720000	7721000	It burst a long time ago
7721000	7722000	Cataclysm burst that bubble
7722000	7723000	I think this year
7723000	7724000	For example
7724000	7725000	Call of Duty Ghost
7725000	7726000	Is not gonna outsell
7726000	7727000	Black Ops 2
7727000	7728000	It's not gonna happen
7728000	7729000	And I think
7729000	7730000	I don't think
7730000	7731000	It might not even be the top
7731000	7732000	Game of the year
7732000	7733000	Because of Grand Theft Auto coming out
7733000	7734000	That was huge
7734000	7735000	29 million copies in 6 weeks
7735000	7736000	Good luck
7736000	7737000	I mean that's just gonna be hard to do anyways
7737000	7738000	Even if it was an excellent game
7738000	7739000	But just
7739000	7740000	I don't think anyone really cares
7740000	7741000	And I think
7741000	7742000	The same with
7742000	7743000	Wow
7743000	7744000	There's a lot of
7744000	7745000	Other things
7745000	7746000	Competing for attention out there
7746000	7747000	In the
7747000	7748000	You know
7748000	7749000	MMO space
7749000	7750000	So
7750000	7751000	They have to do something
7751000	7752000	To really
7752000	7753000	Interest people in playing it
7753000	7754000	And I just don't think
7754000	7755000	They're really doing that a lot anymore
7755000	7756000	Alright
7756000	7757000	Well
7757000	7758000	Moving on
7758000	7759000	To the final
7759000	7760000	Final Fantasy XIV
7760000	7761000	Final Fantasy XIV
7761000	7762000	Final Fantasy XIV
7762000	7763000	Final Fantasy XIV
7763000	7764000	Alright
7764000	7765000	Well moving on to
7765000	7766000	One of those
7766000	7767000	You know
7767000	7768000	This is a case of a tweet
7768000	7769000	Giving people a lot more hope
7769000	7770000	Than maybe they should have
7770000	7771000	But you never know
7771000	7772000	And
7772000	7773000	It's also about a Square Enix game
7773000	7774000	You know
7774000	7775000	Like Final Fantasy XIV
7775000	7776000	It's about
7776000	7777000	The Dragon Quest series
7777000	7778000	And I don't believe
7778000	7779000	There's been a Dragon Quest game
7779000	7780000	Out here in a while
7780000	7781000	We did get
7781000	7782000	We did get Dragon Quest IX
7782000	7783000	Right
7783000	7784000	We did get that
7784000	7785000	But then
7785000	7786000	What there was
7786000	7787000	Dragon Quest Monsters
7787000	7788000	Joker 2
7788000	7789000	That was like 2011
7789000	7790000	That's the last time we've seen
7790000	7791000	A Dragon Quest game out here
7791000	7792000	Now
7792000	7793000	I know this
7793000	7794000	But they've been remaking
7794000	7795000	Dragon Quest games in Japan
7795000	7796000	There's actually two remakes
7796000	7797000	That have happened
7797000	7799000	A third is coming out as well
7799000	7801000	They have Dragon Quest Monsters
7801000	7803000	Wonderland 3D
7803000	7804000	And
7804000	7805000	What's the other one that they had?
7805000	7807000	They have Dragon Quest VII
7807000	7808000	That's right
7808000	7809000	Being remade for the 3DS
7809000	7810000	Ooh
7810000	7811000	Awesome
7811000	7812000	And then of course
7812000	7814000	There's Dragon Quest X
7814000	7815000	The MMO
7815000	7816000	Never happened here in the US
7816000	7817000	Right
7817000	7818000	But there's a lot of people
7818000	7819000	That want to see it happen
7819000	7820000	Well
7820000	7821000	There was a tweet
7821000	7822000	On the Nintendo of America account
7822000	7824000	With hashtag Reginator
7824000	7826000	Implying that it was from Reggie
7826000	7827000	Fils-Aime himself saying
7827000	7831000	I'd love to see a new Dragon Quest game too
7831000	7833000	And so a lot of people are like
7833000	7834000	Oh well if Reggie wants it
7834000	7835000	You know
7835000	7836000	He can make that happen
7836000	7837000	So
7837000	7840000	I don't know if he solely can make that happen
7840000	7841000	But
7841000	7843000	I'd be a fan of seeing some of these remakes
7843000	7844000	Come out over here
7844000	7846000	I'm very curious about Dragon Quest X
7846000	7848000	I'm kind of sad that just didn't happen
7848000	7850000	So
7850000	7851000	Who knows
7851000	7852000	By the way
7852000	7853000	This is the stuff now
7853000	7855000	That Operation Rainfall and that whole group
7855000	7856000	Has their eyes on
7856000	7857000	Cause you know
7857000	7858000	They've got nothing left
7858000	7859000	On their original 3
7859000	7860000	They all came out
7860000	7861000	They got their way
7861000	7863000	So now they're hoping to get this as well
7863000	7864000	So
7864000	7865000	Good luck
7865000	7866000	Hope Nintendo listens to you guys
7866000	7867000	Cause I'd like to see it
7867000	7868000	Well
7868000	7869000	Speaking of listening to you guys
7869000	7871000	Every week you guys can email us

7872000	7874000	At orangeloungeradio.com
7874000	7875000	In Dark Soccer
7875000	7877000	She dives into the mailbag
7877000	7878000	And picks out an email or two
7878000	7879000	To read for you guys
7879000	7880000	Here on the show
7880000	7881000	Or if it's like last week

7882000	7883000	Nah it's just one
7883000	7884000	And I had to use my radioactive gloves
7884000	7886000	To slip through the Mandarin text
7886000	7887000	So
7887000	7889000	Yes we're still getting the spam
7889000	7890000	Bleh

7896000	7897000	And I'm just gonna
7897000	7898000	Go ahead and read this
7898000	7900000	Hi O.L.R.
7900000	7902000	Enlightened Nintendo's recent closure of Swapnote
7902000	7904000	I'd like to bring to your attention
7904000	7905000	Some funny as hell comments
7905000	7907000	Made by Sony Computer Entertainment
7908000	7909000	Shuhei Yoshida
7909000	7910000	Enjoy
7910000	7911000	And the first one
7911000	7912000	Says
7912000	7913000	Do you want me to read these
7913000	7914000	Cause I know you're on your iPad
7914000	7915000	Or
7915000	7916000	Uh sure
7916000	7917000	Okay
7917000	7918000	Uh
7918000	7919000	The first one is a reply
7919000	7920000	To somebody saying
7920000	7921000	Oh
7921000	7922000	Uh
7922000	7923000	Okay
7923000	7924000	Why
7924000	7925000	Yoshida says
7925000	7926000	Thanks for the feedback
7926000	7927000	To the lack of MP3
7927000	7928000	And DLNA support
7928000	7929000	At the launch of PS4
7929000	7931000	I'll share with the PS4 dev team
7931000	7932000	For future consideration
7932000	7934000	And somebody replied to that
7934000	7935000	I need to listen to porn
7935000	7937000	Whilst playing Battlefield
7937000	7939000	And Yoshida replied to that
7939000	7940000	I know
7943000	7944000	Yeah
7944000	7945000	And then there was another tweet
7945000	7946000	Where
7946000	7947000	Uh
7947000	7948000	Somebody tweeted at him
7948000	7949000	Hey
7949000	7950000	I wanna know why my dick
7950000	7952000	Got caught in my PlayStation 3's
7952000	7953000	Disc tray
7953000	7954000	When I tried to play
7954000	7955000	Killzone Shadow Fall
7955000	7956000	On my PlayStation 3
7956000	7957000	It really hurts
7957000	7958000	And yes
7958000	7960000	I tried turning it on and off again
7960000	7961000	Yoshida replied
7961000	7962000	Shut up
7962000	7963000	Shut up
7965000	7967000	To which the original guy replied
7967000	7968000	K
7969000	7970000	That's cute
7971000	7972000	Okay
7972000	7974000	Also please pardon me for a brief
7974000	7976000	Orange Lounge foodie-o tangent
7976000	7978000	But do you guys have a Del Taco in the area?
7978000	7979000	Yes, we have plenty of them
7979000	7980000	Yeah
7980000	7981000	They have some
7981000	7982000	There's literally one up the street
7982000	7983000	From OLR Studios
7983000	7984000	And
7984000	7985000	You better bet
7985000	7986000	I go there all the time
7986000	7987000	It's fantastic
7987000	7988000	They have some great chicken tacos
7988000	7990000	And this is true
7990000	7991000	Signed
7991000	7992000	The Nasty Canasta
7992000	7993000	Oh
7993000	7994000	One of my favorite handles
7994000	7995000	Yes
7995000	7996000	It always makes me think of like strip poker
7996000	7997000	But it's Nasty Canasta
7997000	7999000	It's the Nasty Canasta
7999000	8001000	Nasty Canasta does need a theme song huh
8001000	8002000	Yeah
8002000	8004000	I need to um
8004000	8006000	It should be like um
8008000	8009000	It should be like
8009000	8010000	I don't know
8010000	8011000	Like something set to a Burt Bacharach song
8011000	8012000	Or something
8012000	8013000	Well Nasty Canasta kind of makes me think
8013000	8014000	Like Copacabana
8014000	8015000	Yeah
8015000	8016000	Which makes me think of like those
8016000	8017000	So I don't know
8017000	8018000	When I go
8018000	8019000	Cause you know we love to use
8019000	8020000	I kind of think of this song
8023000	8025000	That's the Nasty Canasta song now
8034000	8036000	We're not sponsored by Del Taco
8036000	8038000	We're sponsored by Pinkberry
8038000	8039000	I wish
8039000	8040000	I wish we had official sponsorship
8040000	8041000	I want sugar free Pinkberry
8041000	8042000	They had a new app come out this week
8042000	8043000	But I'm not going to plug it
8043000	8045000	Because they don't sponsor us
8045000	8046000	Hey Pinkberry
8046000	8048000	Free samples over here
8049000	8050000	Alright
8050000	8053000	Even though I cannot partake of your deliciousness for a while
8053000	8054000	Okay
8054000	8055000	There you go

8088000	8089000	I'm going to sleep
8089000	8090000	Alright
8090000	8092000	Let's get to the FUs of the week
8092000	8093000	Because before we can sleep
8093000	8095000	We have to get all the angst out of our system
8095000	8097000	So we'll do the FUs of the week
8107000	8116000	FU to my state of unemployment
8116000	8117000	Um
8117000	8121000	And not hearing back on the one I really wanted to hear back on at all
8121000	8122000	Um
8122000	8123000	Yeah
8123000	8127000	This is an FU to that
8127000	8129000	And also being sore from the gym
8129000	8132000	Cause I want to go back tomorrow
8132000	8133000	And uh
8133000	8134000	Yeah
8134000	8136000	And Tom Nook
8136000	8138000	Cause he's an ass
8138000	8140000	Loki?
8140000	8141000	Um
8141000	8144000	I guess after the fact I get to have my wisdom teeth out
8144000	8146000	So that's going to be fun
8146000	8147000	Oh god that's right
8147000	8148000	Aren't you going to miss a show because of that?
8148000	8150000	Or you don't know yet?
8150000	8152000	I hope your situation isn't like mine was
8152000	8155000	Cause you remember my wisdom teeth coming out don't you?
8155000	8156000	Yeah
8156000	8157000	Where I had
8157000	8158000	Cause I got mine out when I was a teenager
8158000	8159000	So it was no big deal
8159000	8160000	I've got pictures of it
8160000	8163000	Where I look like I've been in a prize fight for three months
8163000	8164000	Gross
8164000	8166000	I hope yours is better
8166000	8167000	Uh
8167000	8170000	My FU goes to the fact that I don't have tacos right now
8170000	8171000	And that really sucks
8171000	8172000	But
8172000	8173000	That was the best
8173000	8174000	That was
8174000	8176000	We were drinking at this party last night that we went to
8176000	8179000	Which by the way it was the meme party I talked about on the show before
8179000	8181000	And now I can tell you because
8181000	8184000	You know I'm not keeping a secret from any of the listeners anymore
8184000	8186000	I witnessed the what lady?
8186000	8188000	Which you know that you know that that jpeg of the
8188000	8189000	What?
8189000	8191000	The really old lady that's missing her teeth or something
8191000	8193000	And just says W A T
8193000	8195000	So I went as the what lady to the party
8195000	8196000	And it got a great reaction
8196000	8198000	And I drank a lot
8198000	8200000	Where were some of the other costumes there?
8200000	8201000	Uh
8201000	8206000	Alan and somebody else ended up as the ridiculously hot photogenic runner guy
8206000	8209000	So it was really funny that they duplicated the costume
8209000	8210000	That was really funny
8210000	8211000	Uh
8211000	8215000	Slag Kick from Game Buoy was doing funeral selfies
8215000	8217000	He was doing selfies at funerals
8217000	8219000	So of course he walked over to me and took a picture of me
8219000	8221000	And put hashtag this bitch soon
8222000	8224000	By the way I have to tell you
8224000	8227000	A trick or treater did come to my door dressed as an internet meme
8227000	8228000	Oh yeah?
8228000	8230000	He was wearing one of the rage comic shirts
8230000	8232000	Wearing a horse head
8232000	8233000	He was an internet meme
8233000	8234000	Nice nice
8234000	8236000	Well and the other one I would say
8236000	8238000	Captain Spike also from gamebuoy.org
8238000	8241000	Uh did the he wore this like grey hoodie
8241000	8244000	But he had it stuffed with pillows so he was round
8244000	8246000	And he had a little barbie doll swinging on a chain
8246000	8248000	He was the wrecking ball
8248000	8249000	Uh
8249000	8250000	Get it?
8250000	8251000	Get it?
8251000	8252000	I thought it was funny
8252000	8254000	And he kept saying all night like how comfortable he was
8254000	8256000	Cause he had to build him pillows and I was laughing so
8256000	8258000	There you go
8258000	8260000	Uh grandpa did not dress up
8260000	8263000	So we he said something really off
8263000	8265000	As grandpa tends to do if you've ever listened to Hoard House
8265000	8269000	He said something really unpolitically correct later on in the evening
8269000	8271000	So he said he was a YouTube commenter
8271000	8272000	So that's that
8272000	8273000	So anyway
8273000	8275000	Um I don't remember why I was telling that story
8275000	8278000	But oh yes because we got tacos last night
8278000	8280000	While I had been drinking
8280000	8283000	And I'll tell you what there is no better food
8283000	8285000	When you've been drinking than tacos
8285000	8286000	Even though
8286000	8287000	Unless they come from Jack in the Box
8287000	8289000	Eff you to the fact that I'm too fat
8289000	8291000	And uh need to eat less tacos
8293000	8295000	You should try some of that vodka
8295000	8298000	I'm oh yeah I was supposed to have some of that at the start of part B huh
8298000	8299000	Mhmm
8299000	8301000	Well we'll see
8301000	8302000	Rab
8302000	8303000	Rab vodka
8303000	8306000	Maybe maybe I'll do a shot for each call we get tonight
8306000	8307000	To try to entice
8307000	8308000	Everyone call
8308000	8309000	Nice
8309000	8313000	Do I have to mix it with anything or do I just take it as shots
8313000	8316000	It it's it's already mixed it's infused with juice
8316000	8317000	Nice
8317000	8319000	Alright uh let's go to a couple more stories
8319000	8321000	And then we'll open up the phones and take some calls
8321000	8322000	At 1877 Game OLR
8322000	8323000	Uh Logie
8323000	8327000	So Sony has now announced a new Sony rewards uh plan
8327000	8334000	Apparently it allows you to earn points for money that you spend on the Playstation store
8334000	8337000	So you earn for every dollar spent you earn one point
8337000	8343000	And each of those points equals up to be about one penny versus you know towards something else
8343000	8351000	So for example if you want to get a brand new Playstation 3 game or Playstation 4 game for $59.99
8351000	8356000	It's gonna cost you $5,999
8356000	8357000	Um
8357000	8362000	Granted there are other ways you can earn money um or points I should say in there
8362000	8370000	Not just with you know purchasing stuff but you can also I think they have um money spent on this
8370000	8373000	For every dollar you spend on the Sony store
8373000	8376000	Every dollar you spend on the purchase or the uh Playstation store
8376000	8385000	Um when you upload your ticket stubs for Sony pictures, movies and also registered DVDs and Blu-ray discs
8385000	8388000	Um they're also gonna have promotions through retail partners
8388000	8391000	Also if you you know sign up for offers you earn 100 points
8391000	8395000	Buy a PS3 bundle you earn up to 270 points
8395000	8399000	Um they said for movie tickets you earn up to 400 points
8399000	8405000	I'm not sure if that's per ticket or whatever but I mean right there that's a good way there
8405000	8413000	And um basically for every 1000 points you earn a $10 uh Playstation store code
8413000	8420000	Um and then uh 250 points for uh buying the year of Playstation Plus
8420000	8426000	So yeah lots of ways to earn points and they have rewards including you know not just games and stuff
8426000	8433000	But you can also get Sony products and they have like other things, digital downloads, musics, you know movie tickets
8433000	8436000	VIP experiences they say
8436000	8437000	Oh yay
8437000	8439000	So you know prostitutes I guess
8439000	8441000	That's one I'm led to believe in
8441000	8442000	Pole dances
8442000	8444000	Good times
8444000	8447000	Hunting human beings you know that that kind of stuff
8447000	8448000	Awesome
8448000	8452000	Alright uh hey this is a new story about a free game so listen up
8452000	8457000	Um this is a game that came out on the Super Nintendo in the mid 90s it's called Blackthorn
8457000	8458000	I don't know how many
8458000	8459000	Oh god that game
8459000	8460000	Do you remember this game?
8460000	8461000	Yes I do I have that game
8461000	8464000	What you may not remember about this game it was a blizzard game
8464000	8465000	Yes
8465000	8466000	Yes
8466000	8470000	The blizzard that makes Starcraft, Diablo, Warcraft they made a few other games in the heyday
8470000	8471000	Blackthorn
8471000	8478000	Oh yeah oh yeah so Blackthorn is one of them and um what's interesting is if you have a battle.net account
8478000	8481000	You can go get Blackthorn from Blizzard for free
8481000	8484000	That's it once you've downloaded the game it's yours to keep it's a free game
8484000	8489000	I'm gonna speculate here it's to try and get more people on their battle net downloader
8489000	8493000	Cause if they can give away you know this you know what they're not making any money off this anymore
8493000	8494000	You mean all that crap I uninstalled
8494000	8499000	Well but but if you were to go download the battle net downloader so you can get Blackthorn
8499000	8506000	Then hey how easy is it to get a hearthstone on your computer when that comes out which is probably this week during Blizzcon
8506000	8513000	And how easy is it to get a Starcraft demo and a Diablo demo cause all that shit will automatically download if you don't tell it not to
8513000	8518000	So uh they know what they're doing with this they're just trying to get that battle net thing on more computers
8518000	8524000	But hey free game and for those of you that are already playing Warcraft and Diablo and all that stuff anyway
8524000	8529000	And you know shit you already have that stuff on your computer so why not add Blackthorn to that
8529000	8532000	So check that out at battle.net
8532000	8540000	Alright we are uh we're ready to open up the skype line at 1877 game OLR or username on skype orange lounge radio
8540000	8542000	Let me just make sure we are set to accept calls yes we are
8542000	8547000	And I do have my uh my bottle here of what is this vodka that you made
8547000	8550000	Jamie made this vodka she's making moonshine in her basement
8550000	8557000	Not the vodka itself the vodka is actually um actual potato vodka that I filtered myself
8557000	8567000	And it this one has I believe plum nectarine and um a couple of other fruits in it I don't remember I made it a while back so it's pretty potent
8567000	8572000	Nice alright so the skype line is open 1877 game OLR or username on skype orange lounge radio
8572000	8579000	And I will do a shot for each call that we get tonight uh but you can't just call in and say I'm only calling cause I want you to do a shot

8591000	8594000	And I just happened to grab this one it says Canada on it so I guess shout out

8596000	8601000	It will be it will be a very polite shot shout out to all our Canadian listeners up north
8601000	8606000	I know um I know one of the guys at least one of the guys from video game realness they're all Canadian over there in Toronto
8606000	8613000	I know at least one of them listens pretty regularly and uh Alan wait since you're walking by where's the shot glass from is this when you went to Toronto?
8613000	8615000	That's when you went to Toronto
8615000	8622000	Alan went to Toronto once and we really really want to go well I've never been I've only been to Vancouver so I really want to go back to Toronto
8622000	8628000	Oh wait I lied when I was 17 I went to Niagara Falls but you know that wasn't seeing very much of Canada
8628000	8635000	Cause I really want to go to Toronto so I know we've got listeners up there so these shots are for you guys if anybody calls

8643000	8645000	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
8645000	8647000	We're talking about food
8647000	8648000	Are they talking about food?
8648000	8650000	We're talking about restaurant chains and where they are in the country
8650000	8656000	I noticed somebody said racks roast beef earlier I was like oh my god that's a blast from the past
8656000	8660000	You know what was a big blast for me that they don't have anymore was Kenny Rogers Roasters
8660000	8662000	That's a thing?
8662000	8668000	Yeah it's basically like Boston Market it's almost exactly the same so in Boston Market I was like oh that's neat
8668000	8672000	That is awesome alright we are starting to get some calls here so let's go to it
8672000	8674000	Hi you're on Orange Tons Radio who's this?
8674000	8676000	Hey this is Tech Q
8676000	8678000	Hey Tech Q?
8678000	8679000	Yes
8679000	8683000	What is on your mind Tech Q? Oh wait first before I get to what's on your mind let me hold on
8683000	8685000	Oh god this bottle's hard to open hold on
8687000	8689000	Did everyone hear that?
8689000	8692000	Will you talk to Tech Q for me while I pour a shot here?
8692000	8697000	Rob is pouring himself some pink liquor so what do you have to talk about tonight?
8697000	8704000	I wanted to comment about the news of this generation that you did earlier
8704000	8708000	Y'all forgot to mention the red ring 360
8708000	8710000	Yeah there was the red ring
8710000	8714000	Oh yeah the 360 red ring
8715000	8722000	Why do you, I mean obviously I can answer this too but why do you feel this was a defining moment of the generation?
8722000	8739000	I think it affected like 90% of all 360s that were sold up to a point until they finally admitted that they shot the hardware that they sold
8740000	8751000	What do you think Microsoft's learned from this going into the next generation? Do you trust that the Xbox One's not going to have these similar types of problems or what?
8751000	8761000	I would hope they would, they wouldn't get my money if I were going to get Xbone
8762000	8766000	What are your thoughts on the upcoming generation? I know we had the Fugu question of the week earlier
8766000	8770000	Are you jumping in on any of these new consoles? Are you taking a wait and see approach or what?
8770000	8776000	Since I traded in my 360 why not get a PS4 cheap
8776000	8780000	But that is interesting that you traded in the Microsoft console to get the Sony console
8780000	8784000	What weighed in on that decision? Was that just about price or what?
8784000	8800000	It's basically before they did the 180 mantra back in July I was just disgusted with them on their policy especially on that used game DRM crap that they tried to pull
8800000	8806000	So it was probably one of those things where by the time they reversed course it was too late you'd pre-ordered your PS4 right?
8806000	8807000	Yeah
8807000	8808000	Yeah makes sense
8808000	8812000	Alright well TechQ anything else you want to share with us tonight?
8812000	8813000	Don't get too drunk
8813000	8815000	Alright I'll try I will drink responsibly
8815000	8818000	This is Rob of course he will no I'm kidding
8818000	8819000	Alright take care buddy thanks for calling
8819000	8820000	Thanks
8820000	8821000	Alright bye
8821000	8822000	Bye bye
8822000	8827000	Yes the liquor is good and what you didn't, during that call Alan came in here and took a shot as well and he approved too
8827000	8834000	What shot glass did he use? Oh how appropriate he used the Hard Rock Atlanta shot glass that I brought him from this year's DragonCon
8834000	8835000	How appropriate
8835000	8839000	So yeah I don't remember what else I put in I think it had mango too
8840000	8845000	It has yumminess in it I'll tell you that but we've got surprise surprise now we're getting tons of calls we got another call coming in
8845000	8847000	Hi you're on Orange Lawn's radio who's this?
8847000	8850000	This is Ron and I am going to do a shot with you
8850000	8854000	Buck yes alright Dark Soccer's my bartender right now she's pouring me a shot
8854000	8860000	She's such a good friend she not only makes me the liquor but then she pours it out for me that's a true friend right there
8860000	8863000	Yes yes indeed and I have my whipped cream vodka right here
8863000	8867000	When I'm old and in a wheelchair she'll be switching out my IV bag with liquor
8867000	8868000	Alright
8868000	8869000	Heck yeah
8869000	8871000	Here we go I got the shot you ready buddy?
8871000	8874000	Shit I just took a shot let me do another one okay whatever you're ready
8874000	8876000	Alright let me know when you're ready
8876000	8877000	Ready
8877000	8878000	1, 2, 3
8878000	8879000	3
8880000	8881000	Down and 1
8882000	8884000	Does it burn nicely?
8884000	8885000	That's good
8885000	8886000	I like to drop you a glass
8886000	8887000	Oh that you can't have that
8887000	8888000	My bad
8888000	8892000	Alright now that that's taken care of what's on your mind buddy?
8892000	8897000	I'm just amused by the whole PlayStation FAQ it just amuses the living shit out of me
8897000	8905000	It's like when the next when the prior gen came in it was like it can play video games it can do this this and that and I'm like
8905000	8907000	Can it play Street Fighter?
8907000	8908000	Yes but it can also do this
8908000	8910000	Can it play Street Fighter?
8910000	8911000	Yes it can play Street Fighter
8911000	8912000	Thank you
8912000	8915000	PlayStation 4 it can only play Street Fighter
8915000	8917000	But I want to do all of this
8917000	8919000	But you can only play Street Fighter
8919000	8920000	But I want to do this
8921000	8924000	Well you should have kept your prior gen console now shouldn't you?
8924000	8927000	That sounds too much like a Microsoft line
8927000	8935000	See that's the funny part it's like when Microsoft came out the gate running their mouth with everything that they're going to do
8935000	8941000	Everyone had their guns ready they were going to Microsoft castle and just hang Dracula
8941000	8946000	And Sony's like they're like Gendo they're like we're just gonna wait this out
8946000	8953000	Now they're waiting it out and Sony's like we're gonna do a little bit of this we're gonna do a little bit of that we're gonna do a little bit of this
8953000	8959000	And the people like wait a minute this is what Microsoft's were doing but it's Sony so it's okay
8959000	8964000	Well that and Sony was a little bit smarter about how they delivered the bad news to be honest
8964000	8968000	They really waited until the last minute and just kind of snuck it in under the radar
8968000	8975000	And to be real all of these features while they're disappointing at the end of the day they don't really ruin the gaming experience
8975000	8983000	And you know one place where people really razzed the shit out of Microsoft was that they were talking about TV and all this other stuff that wasn't games
8983000	8993000	At that original Xbox reveal and Sony is basically now saying like yeah we're games and not a lot else at this point with the removal of some of these media things
8993000	9001000	So it's very interesting like Sony is still delivering on the games part of it and Microsoft's getting there too with their policy adjustments and so forth
9001000	9008000	Yeah true true I can't hate on them for that but I'm amused where they say no DLNA
9008000	9015000	My train of thought is well you know what if I can't watch my anime on the PlayStation 4 I'll just fire up my PlayStation 3
9015000	9023000	I kind of feel like that's one of the first things you're gonna see get reversed I really think they're listening and I think they're gonna come back and be like
9023000	9029000	Whoa we didn't realize people were was like gonna make a big deal out of this and miss this so I kind of suspect you're gonna see it
9029000	9036000	I believe it I believe it it's just a little bit of time which is why I am not running out in the next 12 days to buy one
9036000	9044000	And that's also part of the reason I mean not just the video it's just the expense and everything and the whole fact that you know the games are disappearing that I was gonna pick up
9044000	9053000	Well from the trailer I mean when the promo for the console I'm not really a first person shooter type of guy
9053000	9061000	If I play those I'm playing it for the story which is why I like Battlefield 3 the hell with the multiplayer I like the story mode from start to finish
9061000	9064000	Interesting I don't usually hear people talk about the story in that game
9064000	9070000	That's how I am cause if I'm gonna do multiplayer it's gonna be with you and whoever else we're gonna be running our mouths like dumbasses but you know
9070000	9071000	Yeah of course
9071000	9080000	There's only one game on the PS4 that I want it's The Order it's a first person shooter that's full steampunk that's it
9080000	9082000	That was like fun
9082000	9091000	Yeah and I can that's not coming until like 2014 I can wait same thing with the Wii U Bayonetta 2 and Mario Kart 8 I can wait
9091000	9093000	X1 still waiting
9093000	9099000	Mario 3D World though that's starting to up the urgency a little bit you gotta admit a little bit
9099000	9104000	Not with me cause as G of Day I can tell you I'm more of a Mario Kart hoard than anything else
9105000	9114000	You know what that's totally fair totally fair I wish Nintendo would announce an F-Zero but as somebody said in chat earlier with all the upside downness of Mario Kart 8
9114000	9119000	Mario Kart is starting to take F-Zero's features I kinda think that says what we need to know about F-Zero
9119000	9127000	Yes and no but I'll tell you this now F-Zero on 3DS would be sick because we've played F-Zero
9127000	9137000	The game plays a lot faster than Mario Kart it's a lot faster speed it's tighter controls I mean like I said I have the XL
9137000	9139000	And there's no fucking blue shells
9139000	9148000	Exactly I mean all the 3DS games I play on my XL now they feel a lot more surreal a lot more in depth I have a lot more fun playing them
9148000	9154000	So F-Zero on that Mario Kart on it I'm sold I'm like yes
9154000	9159000	Alright well I don't know about you Rama I'm starting to feel this liquor a little bit feels good
9159000	9169000	Not me man and I shouldn't even be taking another shot cause I gotta get up at 630 for work and I have like a near 90 minute commute to work now so
9169000	9172000	You have a way better tolerance than I that's all I can say
9172000	9176000	I will send you some of my liver powers
9177000	9185000	Well my liver powers have been adhered through Patty cause she's heavy handed when she pours so Rob when you come out here to the east coast
9185000	9190000	You'll spend a week with her when you come back you'll have an iron liver
9190000	9199000	I really am hoping to get back out to New York in 2014 it is one of the goals if for nothing else than to see NPH and Hedvig that's gotta happen
9199000	9202000	If worst case scenario it's a box
9202000	9203000	As who?
9203000	9204000	Hedvig
9204000	9205000	Willy
9206000	9207000	Yeah I know right?
9207000	9208000	Alright

9226000	9228000	It's a fun group and it's been way too long
9228000	9229000	I wanna go back out there
9229000	9234000	Speaking of the New York orange lounge radio listeners I know this guy hasn't listened for a while but I just saw this in chat
9234000	9241000	SJ100Matt said this in chat and I was like no way really apparently Sephiroth1215 won one of the Playstation 4's through Taco Bell
9241000	9242000	Yeah
9242000	9243000	Nice
9243000	9245000	So congrats I think that's awesome
9245000	9247000	I just wanna win tacos really
9247000	9248000	Yeah?
9248000	9249000	Yeah just tacos
9249000	9252000	I'm starting to feel a little bit like spitty these are spitty and look
9252000	9253000	Pouring another
9253000	9258000	Skyplines lighting up pretty soon I'm not even gonna be able to click on the answer button
9258000	9260000	Hi orange lounge radio who's this?
9260000	9262000	Hey this is act deaf
9262000	9267000	Hey act deaf hold on we'll get to your call in a minute but there's something I gotta do first
9267000	9274000	Yeah we have a name for that when you drink a shot it's called Idago
9274000	9278000	When you take a shot of all the glass so yeah do it
9278000	9280000	What does it mean Idago?
9280000	9290000	Idago it's a name it's actually the name of one of the founding fathers of the nation
9290000	9291000	So Idago
9291000	9301000	I don't know where the name comes from for taking a shot but it's something I've heard throughout the years
9301000	9306000	You know what fair enough I gave a shout out to the Canadians earlier so this one goes out to my Mexicans down below here we go
9306000	9309000	And I did put the stuff in a petrol bottle
9310000	9312000	There you go act deaf
9312000	9315000	So maybe does it count that I put it in a petrol bottle?
9315000	9318000	Perhaps alright what's on your mind buddy I took the shot what's up
9318000	9325000	Well I wanted to talk about the influential game of the generation or most influential
9325000	9330000	Yeah what do you believe is the most influential game of the generation?
9330000	9331000	Portal
9331000	9337000	Portal oh yeah you mentioned this in chat earlier and Jamie somewhat agreed with you is her number two pick
9337000	9339000	Why did you pick Portal?
9339000	9350000	Basically well Portal didn't do anything that well how to say that special or that original
9350000	9360000	Besides the portals or the physics in the game that's something that we have we already seen in other games especially like Half Life and stuff like that
9360000	9373000	But it was influential because of the storytelling basically it's most of the games after Portal try to imitate something in the storytelling in them
9373000	9383000	Like games at least in a more serious and more detailed well not detailed sorry I'm trying to gather my words
9383000	9390000	That's alright was that because of GLaDOS you think? Like everybody loves that character
9390000	9405000	Yeah part of that and part of Shell being mute it's basically like playing Zelda or playing Mario where the main characters are mute
9406000	9415000	But since this is a first person game so basically they're talking to you so it's a more personal maybe
9415000	9431000	And all the experience around it because it's like especially because of that it's a first person it's a more personal experience all around
9431000	9443000	You're the one doing the stuff all the stuff happens to you directly so it's a lot of games after Portal have kind of imitated that
9443000	9456000	So it's not maybe in a first person perspective but more in what happens in the decisions that you make or the other stuff that you do in the game
9456000	9459000	Well basically it's you
9459000	9469000	You know what also was great about first person shooter I'm starting to slur a little bit about Portal you know what was great about Portal besides just what you're talking about like the immersion and all that
9469000	9475000	The thing that was great about Portal is that it was a first person shooter game for people that hate first person shooters
9475000	9477000	Yeah basically
9477000	9488000	I mean really like everybody I know that like hates first person shooters still loves Portal because it's more of like it's more a puzzle obviously but it's yet it is that first person
9488000	9502000	And especially that because I got the orange box on the 360 basically for Portal I didn't finish even the Half Life 2 and didn't even start episode 1 and 2
9502000	9514000	I played Team Fortress and I still play it that's a game I enjoy but basically I got the orange box because of Portal and I played a hell a lot of it
9514000	9516000	There's a lot of people that do that
9516000	9528000	I have three different copies of it two on the Xbox I got the orange box and still alive and then I got the copy on Steam so I love that game a lot
9529000	9543000	Like you said it's an immersive game it's totally immersive and like I said a lot of games have tried to replicate that immersion and a few have succeeded in it
9543000	9558000	Not all of them but it's basically the legacy that Portal has handed down to gaming and I think it's a pretty important thing too in this generation and probably the next
9558000	9562000	And very important with Portal and Jonathan Coulton
9562000	9564000	Oh yeah
9564000	9569000	Alright well Act F I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show but thank you so much for your call buddy
9569000	9570000	Thank you
9570000	9571000	Alright take care
9572000	9573000	Bye
9573000	9588000	Alright that does it for calls tonight oh I know more you wanted to call in to get me to take more shots but you guys it's a school night I got to work tomorrow and I'm already feeling a little bit tipsy so I asked the bartender to call me off
9588000	9590000	To call it off close it down shut it down
9590000	9591000	Cut you off
9591000	9592000	Cut me off that's what I was looking for
9592000	9594000	And I got you water because I'm nice
9594000	9596000	You are a good friend
9596000	9598000	I would help you hide bodies
9598000	9600000	You are what would you hold my head over the toilet
9600000	9602000	I'd hold your hair back if you had enough
9602000	9604000	Hey
9604000	9606000	I'm not talking I'm talking about long hair
9606000	9607000	Jerk

9608000	9613000	You know I have a complex about that and I'm just kidding I don't but it's funny
9613000	9615000	So I learned something today
9615000	9616000	Okay what
9616000	9618000	I learned what they call a combover in Japan
9618000	9620000	A barcode hair
9620000	9623000	Nah I don't like that look at all
9623000	9626000	Yeah it's kind of bad but I still thought that was a funny name
9626000	9629000	There is nothing wrong with rocking the bald look as far as I'm concerned
9629000	9630000	You know what
9630000	9631000	Are you gonna shave it all off
9631000	9632000	No

9787000	9789000	You know what we need to do?
9789000	9791000	We need to have a PS4 QQ party

9794000	9796000	Jumping Flash Marathon

9798000	9799000	Oh my god
9799000	9800000	This is why we're friends
9800000	9804000	You have to play Playstation 1 games on your PS3 because it's 1 plus 3 and there you go 4
9804000	9808000	I like the way you think even though it's kinda ridiculous but that's why we keep you around
9808000	9811000	I still have to get a battery for the Saturn
