00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
This week, Nintendo kills Swapnode via Spotpass, because children and penises!

00:18.000 --> 00:27.000
Ubisoft turns tail and drops its passport system for Assassin's Creed, and the PocketStation rumors get stronger with an intending announcement this week. All these plosives and more begin right now.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange, Lounge, Radio

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Greetings and Salutations

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
I feel better than I have in a very long time

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
Good. It's nice to feel great, in a good mood

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
Well, except for the day's just been so weird because of ye olde time change, arr

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
And to be honest, and just keeping it real y'all, I'm a little hungover today

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
So I'm a little, I'm a little like dragon

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Rob, you look amazing for a hungover

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Well thank you

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Did you enjoy the vodka presence?

01:27.000 --> 01:36.000
I haven't, I haven't partaken in the vodka presence, I actually was planning to drink during tonight's show, which I'm sure the listeners would have loved, but now that I've, I kind of drank a lot last night

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
You should try a shot of it, if you feel up to it later

01:39.000 --> 01:48.000
We'll see, we'll see, if the, if listeners, if y'all behave, and especially knowing that I don't have to get Alan after work now, he's on his way home right now, so I don't have to drive tonight at all, so I can be responsible

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Indeed

01:49.000 --> 01:58.000
If listeners behave, I will take a shot, maybe at the beginning of part B, and the wine was already starting to get me to slur my words at the end of last week's show, so this should be hilarious

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
I'm gonna have to get you a bottle of the honey run, because that stuff was, I love that stuff

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Good times

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
And you were funny, but I have to say, I just forgot what I was gonna say, so please, oh yeah, I'm drunk on coffee and high on life

02:09.000 --> 02:16.000
Woohoo, alright, also say hello to somebody else who I'm sure is high on life, say hello to Techmaster Loki

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
And actually, November's not a very busy month for games, although there are a couple big games coming out

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
You've gotta be kidding, I was just thinking today, I was like, oh my god, November 22nd is the day the Xbox One comes out, right?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Yeah

02:28.000 --> 02:43.000
Well, okay, on November 22nd, I've already bought, at Best Buy, and have to go pick up my Zelda 3DS, because I'm not getting the Xbox One right away, just probably next year, and then, you know what else comes out November 22nd is the Mario 3D World Land Cube

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
It's still not that much, really October was a busier month because you had a lot more releases

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
Was it really? I just would have thought, well, you've got two consoles launching this month

02:50.000 --> 02:58.000
Yeah, but, so, are you gonna count every single re-release of each of these games on different platforms as a separate title?

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
I suppose not

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
It's just the same titles, they're just, oh hey, one comes out one week, one comes out the other week, and whatever

03:06.000 --> 03:21.000
So, really, you only have two major releases, next gen console and first party games aside, you pretty much just have Call of Duty, and Need for Speed, and then, I guess, the Mario, Super Mario 3D World, and that's about it

03:21.000 --> 03:32.000
Well, to be honest, I'm just keeping it real, I mean, I know everybody's excited about this new generation of games, but I'm probably, the single game I'm most excited about is that Wii U Mario game

03:32.000 --> 03:49.000
That, I think, is the game to be most excited about right now, I think those Mario games are, 90% of the time, solid as heck, and all the good, all the kind of early previews and reviews on that thing are really positive, so I don't think I have any reason not to be super excited about that game

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
I'm more excited about that than anything I can think of on Playstation 4 or Xbox One, to be quite honest

03:53.000 --> 04:01.000
But the resolution that it played on the Xbox One was just terrible, zero P, I mean, it's same with the Playstation 4, zero P

04:01.000 --> 04:09.000
Is that why the fan wank fantasy of Nintendo making Xbox One games can't come true, because Xbox One wouldn't run away?

04:09.000 --> 04:17.000
I get no picture and sound at all, all I get is a stupid arrow that comes on the screen that says this disc is not compatible or it's dirty or something, I just don't get it, but

04:18.000 --> 04:26.000
Now, to be real, I don't really need the Zelda 3DS XL, I really don't need it, and my money could be better spent on other things

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
Spray paint the damn, but, if you buy it, you can sell me your old one for Dan

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Oh, Dan wants a 3DS?

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Because he wants to play Zelda!

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Why doesn't he buy a Zelda 3DS?

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Because I have no job!

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
What about a 2DS?

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
I have a buyer earmarked right now, but if that falls through, certainly, that would be a good thing

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
Dan, if you're listening to the show, which you're not, I'm not getting it for you at all, ever, no, I'm not, you don't need it

04:51.000 --> 05:00.000
So, yeah, anyway, I just want that Zelda 3DS, because it looks so dang cool, and I was so happy that it didn't end up being a GameStop exclusive and I could buy it at a bunch of other retailers

05:00.000 --> 05:06.000
So, yeah, I pre-ordered it at Best Buy, because I don't know if it's going to be limited quantity or what, and I just want to make sure I can

05:06.000 --> 05:14.000
Yeah, they're always limited launch, like those Pokemon 3DS XLs, they're gone, they were gone after their first initial launch

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I still saw some on the shelf at Fry's

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
Yeah, they probably bought a ton and didn't sell them, but it's still, they only do them one batch and that's it

05:22.000 --> 05:31.000
Interesting, alright, well, let's see, I do want to also introduce our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com, because of course we are the show where every gamer has a voice

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
You guys join us in the chatroom every week, and we like to read some of the comments from the chatroom

05:36.000 --> 05:44.000
Let's see, actdeft saying, I'm considering selling my Pikachu 3DS XL to get a Wii U, it would certainly be a start

05:44.000 --> 05:52.000
Brad from Pod Culture says, Skye, I'm such a sucker, I ordered Injustice for the PlayStation 4, already imported it for PlayStation 3

05:52.000 --> 06:00.000
But yeah, I mean, I know the reviews on that game were mixed, but you, Brad, really liked it, and, you know, I don't, if you like a game, then you like a game

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
And I don't think there's anything wrong with getting it on multiple consoles if you truly enjoy a game

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Even though it's freaking weird

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Well, but that's, you know, opinions

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
I know him, and I have to give him a hard time ever being a DC fanboy anyway

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Yeah, well that's an age-old battle YouTube has been having forever

06:14.000 --> 06:21.000
But for me, I have Final Fantasy XIV on PlayStation 3 and PC, and some people think I'm weird for that

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Because you are

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
You bet, I'm playing it on PlayStation 4 when that's available, so I'm excited about that

06:28.000 --> 06:38.000
Xtafur, our buddy from Horde House, is in chat tonight and says, That's one thing about Nintendo, you can bet that all their games will always run and look amazing on their systems

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
This is why Mario 3D World looks so much better than most other things

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
I don't know if they knock it out of the park 100% of the time with their games, because sometimes there's some misfires

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Like what, Steel Diver wasn't really the hottest 3DS game

06:51.000 --> 06:59.000
But not to totally dismiss your point, because it's one of the biggest perks of Nintendo and one of the biggest drawbacks

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
Nobody does Nintendo better than Nintendo

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
The bar is not really set very high for Nintendo either, I mean, because we're talking

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
No, I'm serious, so the type of game, though, it doesn't have to be that, it's cartoony

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
It doesn't have to be that realistic

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
And also it's a lot easier for them because they're developing on one platform as opposed to multi-platform

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
But that kind of goes with any first party game that you're only going to have on one platform and it might look better

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
Well, I was going to say, as theJ100Matt was saying, how many multiple copies of DDR do we have

07:29.000 --> 07:35.000
Except that they actually were kind of different from system to system and release to release, so it doesn't matter

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
I was just about to read that same comment and go, well, it's very similar to the Madden games every year

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
I mean, DDR was a type of Madden game

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
Yeah, that actually burned calories instead of making you put them on eating chips

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
But still, it was music instead of players that changed

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
That's all you had to change, though, was the music. The music changed the whole game

07:56.000 --> 08:03.000
The game itself, that's like saying, well, hey, Monopoly and another game that uses dice

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
Monopoly and Dungeons and Dragons are exactly the same because they use dice

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
Well, the whole point is that it's the content that makes the game, not the style

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Well, part of it is the content and the style

08:15.000 --> 08:21.000
Well, I mean, to use the D&D analogy, you use the same method every time you play

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
But your content's different every time you play

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
It's the same with DDR and same, I hope, with the sports ball stuff

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
Alright, well, we're having a fun conversation here at the top of the show

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
But I wanted to get into the official kickoff topic that I had earmarked for tonight before we get into our gaming weeks

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
And the kickoff topic I wanted to talk about tonight is, as I've mentioned in prior weeks on the show

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
We are not going to be here next week, and it's kind of sort of because of BlizzCon

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
I'm going to be out of town, even though I'm technically not going to BlizzCon

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
Long story, but I'm going to DizCon and some of the parties, so there you go

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
So we're not going to be here next week, so no show November 10th, sorry

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
But we will be back on November 17th

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
And if you think about it, when we're back with our first live show on November 17th

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
We will now live in a world that has a PlayStation 4 in it

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
The next system for, you know, the next generation

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
Although I know some people may say Wii U is in there, but, you know, well

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
We all know Nintendo marches to the beat of their own drum

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
Right? So, you know, okay, yeah, Wii U is there

09:22.000 --> 09:30.000
But PlayStation 4 is, like, you know, and Xbox One are like really kind of like that next level of power and graphics and so forth

09:30.000 --> 09:37.000
So this is really kind of the last episode of OLR to kind of put a cap on this generation

09:37.000 --> 09:43.000
Now, it's not that this generation is done, because obviously there's still plenty of 360 and PlayStation 3 games to come

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
You don't kill your first child when you have your next child

09:46.000 --> 09:53.000
Yeah, but, and there's even some speculation that this generation could continue if these new consoles tank, which is a possibility

09:53.000 --> 09:59.000
If you were going to use that analogy, I would just be like this great, great, great, great, great grandmother

09:59.000 --> 10:04.000
But for most practical purposes, this generation is probably peaked

10:04.000 --> 10:12.000
And we're in a unique situation here at OLR that when these consoles launched in, what, 2005, 2006, we were around

10:12.000 --> 10:19.000
So we've actually been able to cover this entire generation of gaming from start to finish, you know, having done this show as long as we have

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
So I'm kind of curious what my co-hosts feel, and I'll share my thoughts too

10:23.000 --> 10:29.000
I want to know, I want to know kind of what you think the most defining game of the generation was

10:29.000 --> 10:36.000
And I don't necessarily mean the best game of the generation, although that certainly may end up being for you the most defining

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
But what do you think the most defining game of the generation was?

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
And then I'm also going to ask so you can be thinking about it, and the chatters, you can think about this too

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
What do you think was the most important thing that happened news-wise in this generation?

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
Dark Soccer, you're already taking mic to mouth, what are your thoughts?

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
Well, I'm going to go with the Mass Effect series, I mean, all three of them together because they're a series

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
No surprise hearing this from you

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
Well, yeah, but I'm going to say this, that specifically it got me back into gaming this generation

11:05.000 --> 11:12.000
Because I, you know, I had my surgery, and you know, I played a bunch of games and, you know, was, I'm okay, oh this is fun

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
Oh, this is neat, I'm going to go back and play Puyo Puyo, I always go back and play like my old games

11:16.000 --> 11:25.000
Because I am a classic gamer, but I have to say that since picking up the series and getting into the story again

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
I've started checking out more and more new things as they've come out, I've started looking at other companies that do similar things

11:30.000 --> 11:37.000
That, well, as opposed to the sucky things that Bioware has done, but you know, companies that have similar types of titles

11:37.000 --> 11:45.000
I've got, I've been playing Dragon Age, I've been really expanding, and I think that it's just, it's the first series that's been out

11:45.000 --> 11:53.000
That had so engaging a story that I really, it's, and I've used this quote before, a friend of mine in Becky's

11:53.000 --> 12:00.000
Has said it's the best movie I've ever played, and you know how you go back and watch your favorite, how often have we seen Showgirls?

12:00.000 --> 12:06.000
But you know, you go back and you watch your, you know, your favorite show over and over even if part of it, you know, has sucked

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
You know, even if you didn't like part of this story or didn't, or thought this could have been better

12:10.000 --> 12:17.000
You still go back and watch it if it's something that you love, especially if it's the universe that you like

12:17.000 --> 12:24.000
And I had actually gotten pretty kind of bored with it for a little while, and then I just went back and started over

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
And I was like, well, you know what, this is kind of fun again, and started finding new things to enjoy

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
And you know, so I'm actually kind of getting back into it, it's really funny

12:32.000 --> 12:42.000
But it was, you know, especially, you know, now I play it on PC, mind you, but it still goes in with the same generation

12:42.000 --> 12:48.000
And, you know, my second choice is actually up there too, I don't know if I can mention my second choice

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Sure, of course

12:49.000 --> 12:56.000
The Portal series, Portal and Portal 2, because those added in all kinds of different mechanics

12:56.000 --> 13:02.000
And made you use your brain as well as having just a delicious, starky humor in it that was fantastic

13:02.000 --> 13:09.000
And, you know, but the big two things about both of those is that you also have this community built up around it

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
I hate to use the word fandom, but it really is just that

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
It's funny that you bring up Portal, because I'm looking at our chatroom, and of course we've got people naming their games

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
Act Def says, the game that defined this generation, Portal

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
And definitely probably in my top five, I would have put the orange box as one of the defining games of this generation

13:26.000 --> 13:38.000
Because it was such that immense value, but it also brought us Portal, it brought us, I think in many ways the orange box kind of set up Steam in a lot of ways

13:38.000 --> 13:45.000
And I realize Steam was around before, but I think a lot of people really got onto Steam in large part because of those orange box games

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
And Steam has been, you know, I don't want to leave the PC and how they've been pacing alongside consoles out of this necessarily

13:50.000 --> 13:56.000
So I think the orange box really heavily contributed, that would definitely be my top five, it's not my number one, but yeah

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
Well, here's the point I was going back to, why I call them defining games

14:00.000 --> 14:08.000
Is first of all, you do have, like you were just mentioning that side by side with PC, you're actually with so much crossover between consoles and PC

14:08.000 --> 14:18.000
You're expanding the fan base, you are building an actual bigger community instead of this us versus them mentality that's existed forever

14:18.000 --> 14:25.000
You've actually got both people playing these games, you know, how often have I modded Becky's save files for Mass Effect 2 and 3?

14:26.000 --> 14:37.000
Plenty of times, and you know, you've got this level of crossover, but it's, when you've got people who are so invested in the story that they've expanded around it

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
That I think that you've made, you've really gotten a success story out of it

14:41.000 --> 14:49.000
I was really considering, I wasn't going to say the Mass Effect, I was really considering saying Mass Effect 3 is my game of the generation

14:49.000 --> 14:56.000
I knew you would say it though, so I'm going to pick something else, and I know a lot of people would say, why not 2?

14:56.000 --> 15:04.000
How could you pick 3 over 2? And this is where I go, well it's not necessarily about the best, but it's about what defined this generation

15:04.000 --> 15:12.000
And I think in a lot of ways, you know, Mass Effect 3 introduced the multiplayer element of it, you know, which I love, and still get a lot of replayability out of it

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
And I want to play again soon

15:13.000 --> 15:19.000
Yeah, and it's still a great game, but then you get into that whole debacle about the ending

15:19.000 --> 15:28.000
And I think the internet backlash to that, whether you like it or not, was definitely one of the more noteworthy things to happen

15:28.000 --> 15:38.000
You know, the way that the fans in many ways revolted against what they put out for the game was something you wouldn't have seen in previous generations

15:38.000 --> 15:45.000
You know, like I think we all said around the time, Final Fantasy VII, thank god the internet wasn't out when people saw Final Fantasy VII's ending for the first time

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
You probably would have seen something similar, and so I think that in many ways

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
I liked the ending for that game

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
I think that in many ways, for better or for worse, defined the generation

15:54.000 --> 16:02.000
So, I'll save my pick for just a minute here, Loki, what do you think was the game that defined the generation for better or for worse?

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
Well, here's kind of a weird take on it, but I'm going to say Saints Row the Third

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
And, unfortunately

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Is that just because it's you, though?

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
No, no, and hold on, let me explain

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
It's deep

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Where every gamer has a voice

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Deep

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
It's deep

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Saints Row deep

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
Well, no, this is, and watch, hold on, you'll understand in just a sec

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
So, here's why

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
Saints Row was a great series, and I really enjoyed it

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
And, I mean, pretty much the whole series has been in this generation so far

16:33.000 --> 16:44.000
Well, the reason why Third is most defining of this generation is because of all the business tactics that are being used in games nowadays

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
It kind of introduced a lot of these things, at least to that series

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
Like, for example, on disc DLC

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
DLC whoring

16:52.000 --> 16:58.000
Really terrible DLC that they charge a lot of money for and you get very little content out of

16:58.000 --> 17:05.000
Basically gutting what was a really good series and then turning it into some big monetization fest

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
That is this generation of games

17:08.000 --> 17:15.000
It's basically something that you, they've done so much to where you actually hate the series

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
And yet you'll still buy it the next year that it comes out

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
That's basically this series, this generation in gaming

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
You take the abuse and you still come back

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Very interesting pick

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000
I have, I can't really get around it

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
I have two picks for the game of the generation, but one of them is not really a game

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
So let me start with, and I know people are going to roll their eyes at this

17:41.000 --> 17:46.000
But it really is, I think in many ways, the game that defined this generation, for better or worse

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
I believe that game is Wii Fit

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Get off your ass the game?

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Kind of

17:53.000 --> 17:58.000
And I think that whole exer-gaming thing

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
Now some might go, well why not Wii Sports?

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
And believe me, I was thinking Wii Sports big time

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
But I really was thinking about more Wii Fit

18:07.000 --> 18:13.000
How that really took what Wii Sports did for the whole get up off your butt and move gaming

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
And really pushed that forward

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
And really for the first time, didn't make video games look like something for lazy people

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
And I think that was a very important turning point in this generation

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
But DDR didn't?

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
DDR didn't catch on the way Wii Fit did because Konami didn't believe in it the way Nintendo did

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Whether we like it or not

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
What's your point?

18:34.000 --> 18:40.000
I think when Nintendo really pushing Wii Fit and really getting it out there

18:40.000 --> 18:48.000
I think they really brought this counterbalance and moved the Wiis and exercise gaming altogether

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Into the commonplace

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Soccer moms were eating it up

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
Retirement homes, grandmas were playing video games

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
And this was like, you know, a huge thing

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
I have another one by the way

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
You can't just have one because it's hard to define a whole generation of that

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
And yes this is not going to grant the thought of 5 again because that's just too easy

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
Minecraft is another example of a thing that defines this generation

19:16.000 --> 19:21.000
You have an indie game that just goes crazy, just blows up

19:21.000 --> 19:26.000
You have basically all of the content out there

19:26.000 --> 19:32.000
The community, the YouTube videos, just all that sort of stuff

19:32.000 --> 19:39.000
And kind of almost kick starting I think a little bit of the indie resurgence you've seen

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
Where, hey, these indie games can actually be very good

19:43.000 --> 19:49.000
And now you're seeing a lot more focus on indie titles and stuff that's not coming from a big publisher or developer

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
Well that and the genre of sandbox games in general

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
That's been around forever

19:54.000 --> 19:59.000
But it really brought that back up into the limelight

19:59.000 --> 20:04.000
My other pick for the game, and I'm using my quotey fingers

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
That define this generation of games is Netflix

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
I'm sorry, I didn't expect that, but yeah

20:11.000 --> 20:16.000
But think about it, okay Netflix isn't a game, yes I know that

20:16.000 --> 20:23.000
But didn't all our game consoles turn into something else, a little something else because of Netflix?

20:23.000 --> 20:29.000
Yes there's Hulu and all this other stuff too, but Netflix obviously being the biggest one

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
And me just being a big fan of Orange is the New Black

20:31.000 --> 20:37.000
Isn't that the one that really just turned game consoles into entertainment centers?

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Not at my house

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
But we had a dedicated computer set up just for that, we didn't need to use any of that

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
But admittedly you're different

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
And again, I'm thinking about the soccer mom families and so forth

20:49.000 --> 20:55.000
There's people that go out there and buy Wii's because they're cheap Netflix boxes

20:55.000 --> 21:03.000
Yeah there is that, I mean it's for the same reason that people bought PS2's because of them being a DVD player

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
And the Blu-ray player for PS3

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
And one of the other games I would throw out there

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
And then we'll change topics here, I want to get into news stories

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
One of the other games that really define the generation

21:15.000 --> 21:20.000
And you know I say for better or for worse and in this case it's definitely for worse

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
I think Farmville

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
I just burped a bit

21:25.000 --> 21:31.000
But whether you like it or not, mobile and Facebook gaming has become bigger and bigger lately

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
And again it's the whole fact that it gets these people to play games

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
Not just play them but obsess over them

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
Like grandma's going out of town because she's going on a cruise for a week

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
Can somebody watch her farm so her frickin' cows don't die or whatever it is

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
That's my mother

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
See?

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Yeah

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Did your mother ever play video games before Farmville?

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Yes

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Oh

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
We used to have

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Damn you ruined my point I was trying to make

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
My mom and I used to get into screaming matches over Dr. Mario

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
Which by the way her birthday is in two days so happy birthday

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
Alright SSG100Matt says angry birds also, definitely for those same reasons

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
Extover says I think Wii Sports would be more defining than Wii Fit to be honest

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
It really was the defining moment for all motion control games

22:16.000 --> 22:21.000
I do agree to a point Extover and I think Wii Sports obviously was

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
Well it was the biggest game this generation as far as sales go

22:25.000 --> 22:31.000
But I think Wii Fit really took what Wii Sports started and just kind of put an exclamation point on it

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
And that's kind of why I said Wii Fit

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
I mean especially you start to look at how the Kinect and the Move really got a piece of that

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
It was a lot more the exercise gaming and all that

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
I mean look at all those games that come out they're all exercise games

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
So anyway

22:43.000 --> 22:51.000
Tigerclaw says two words horse armor which you know definitely Skyrim I think is a game of the generation in some ways

22:51.000 --> 22:56.000
There's a lot of people you know that can play that game and only that game and never anything but that game

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I just don't think that Skyrim brought anything really new

22:58.000 --> 23:04.000
Tal says or maybe that's Tal sorry for mispronouncing that says at least no one mentioned Journey

23:04.000 --> 23:12.000
You know Journey is a pretty incredible game though and I just Journey kind of stands on its own

23:12.000 --> 23:17.000
I don't think we've yet seen how Journey has inspired other games yet

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
But that might be coming in the next generation

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
But Journey I think Journey was an amazing game and one of the best of the generation

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
But I don't know if it necessarily defined it

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Kind of the difference there

23:28.000 --> 23:36.000
Or if it had to be something that added definition to this generation of gaming

23:36.000 --> 23:41.000
I would say that it added it brought back an artistic element that had been missing

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Why?

23:44.000 --> 23:50.000
Because that just it basically steamrolled the franchise that they have now

23:51.000 --> 23:55.000
And then there was that whole divorce after that right or was that Modern Warfare 2?

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
That was after that

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
That was after Modern Warfare 2 I think

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
One more comment here and then I'll switch topics here

24:01.000 --> 24:06.000
Extrovert says for me The Last of Us is the epitome of the defining game of this generation

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
To me it was this generation's series finale

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
That's an interesting analogy there

24:12.000 --> 24:17.000
You know I can see that I mean I've wanted to play the game I haven't played it yet

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
But for everything that I've seen come up around it I'd have to agree with that

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
Sort of like the cherry on top of the sundae

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
I do like that analogy that it's the series finale

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
I think that's a neat way of putting it

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
And then we wake up and it's Bob Newhart in his bed

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
It was all a dream

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
Alright how about the news that defined this generation

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
You might really have to rack your brain a little bit

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
But what do you think was the news story that really defined this generation?

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
I'd say it was a series of news stories

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
There might be more than one that you can think of

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
But something off the top of your head

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
And I ask this to chat as well

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
Well I'm really going to go with a series of them

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
Because they all go back to the same thing

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
It's all those stupid violence blaming video games

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
Which we've got psychological studies proving the exact opposite

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
We have statistics showing that crime has decreased since the

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
When did the Nintendo come out? Was it 91? 90?

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
The original Nintendo? 85

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
I don't know why I was saying that, but Super Nintendo

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
I think you said Super Nintendo was 90 to 91

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
Because we've had a decrease in armed crime amongst youth

25:22.000 --> 25:27.000
Over the last 20-30 years

25:27.000 --> 25:32.000
But they still go back and try to do this as scapegoat

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
It's still turning into this misunderstood thing

25:35.000 --> 25:40.000
When in reality it's just another mask for what the real problem is

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
So I think we're seeing a bigger increase of scapegoatism

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
In the news about video games

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
Loki, any thoughts?

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
It's a tough question, especially live

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
I can't even remember what happened last year

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Like you guys, I seriously told Loki in Dark Soccer

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Like 5 minutes before the show what was going to come up

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
As usually happens here in the world of live radio

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Well I'm just trying to think of big stuff

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
There's the PlayStation Network hacking thing

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Since you brought it up, that was my number one

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
The PlayStation Network hack

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
I wouldn't even do that

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
I don't know, it's just kind of to me

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
Maybe the Xbox One announcement

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
And kind of all the stuff that went wrong

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
Like during E3 and kind of the reversal of that stuff

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
It's kind of like this generation's

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
Almost, I don't know, some people like the specs and stuff

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
That they have on the console and all the different DRM things and stuff

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
But it's almost like for the majority of the people

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
I think it's like this kind of nightmare situation

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Like this is the way things are going

26:45.000 --> 26:51.000
And kind of demonstrating all the stuff that's kind of gone wrong in this generation

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
I don't know, I can't really think of anything that's super defining in this

26:56.000 --> 27:03.000
It's hard to say, there hasn't really been any huge, huge, huge changes I think

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
I do think of two things that I would like to have been defining

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
And one of them was how they were networking the PS3s as a computer to

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
What was it, leukemia or cancer research?

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Oh, the folding at home?

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
Yeah, I thought that's something that should have been defining

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
But people like to look at the negative instead of the positive

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
But that and all of the charities that popped up around next generation gaming

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
I'm not saying that they popped up with this generation

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
But they've certainly come to higher prevalence with this generation

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
We have Child's Play, Extra Life

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
A lot of them are going back and playing older consoles

27:39.000 --> 27:44.000
But we're seeing a lot more of these popping up and getting attention

27:44.000 --> 27:49.000
I kind of tie that to the emergence of streaming your gameplay online

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
And kind of Twitch TV and Ustream and all that

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
I think that's one of the big things about this generation

27:56.000 --> 28:03.000
I think you see a lot of charity drives able to be done a lot easier

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
And a lot more ground roots, ground level types of fundraising

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Grassroots?

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Thank you, that's the word I was looking for

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
Types of fundraising because of being able to stream your games online

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
And just have that instant audience

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
I kind of think that story is evolving as we move into PlayStation 4

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
And Xbox 360 going to have that stuff in there

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
So we'll get into the news in a minute here where there's some borders with that

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
And what it will and won't do

28:29.000 --> 28:35.000
But I think that is definitely a big story that's kind of bridging the two generations

28:35.000 --> 28:41.000
I would really like for stuff like that to be the defining news of the generation

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Really?

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
The most defining, I think the most defining thing ever of this generation

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
President Cat

28:48.000 --> 28:54.000
I more want to put it as you have communities of people coming together for a good cause through video games

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
I love some of these answers here in chat

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
And this is a great one that I didn't even think of

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
And I'm sitting here going why, why didn't I think of this

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
Tal in our chat room says Kickstarter

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Any Kickstarter related game

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
And Black Wolf adds to that

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
The news story of this generation is either the emergence of Kickstarter

29:12.000 --> 29:17.000
Or the internet bitching enough that a storyteller changed the ending of the story they wanted to tell

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
But you know both those things have something in common

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
And that is the voice of the internet has become a huge thing this generation

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
If you think about it, I don't want to toot our own horn a little bit

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
But podcasting wasn't around last time

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
Heck yeah

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
And it is now

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
And that's all a part of that

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
It's just the voice of the gamer getting a little louder

29:40.000 --> 29:45.000
And those barriers, you know it used to be the magazine would come to my home

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
And that was the only way I kind of kept tabs on what was going on in the gaming industry

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
But those barriers between us and the gaming industry are really coming down

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Twitter is a big part of that

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
I can interact with developers directly for better or for worse

29:57.000 --> 30:02.000
Well in general though that would be an evolution of communication itself

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
Where many communities are coming together

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
And having that interactivity that we didn't have you know 30 years ago

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
Or that we barely had 30 years ago I'll put it that way

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
I mean I met my husband online

30:14.000 --> 30:18.000
I've made tons, like the chat room is full of you know friends of mine now

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
You know people I can call friends so

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
And that I might not have met otherwise

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Absolutely

30:23.000 --> 30:29.000
And Tigerclaw says you could also add the whole thing with PSN being hacked and down for a few weeks

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
I said it briefly but yeah that would actually be my number one most defining thing

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
I think was when Playstation Network was hacked

30:35.000 --> 30:42.000
Because I think in a lot of ways how much information we're putting out there about ourselves easily

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
I think a very tough lesson was learned in many ways all around the board

30:46.000 --> 30:51.000
Just like I think the last generation, the Xbox and Playstation 2

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
I think the defining thing of that generation was Xbox Live

30:55.000 --> 31:03.000
It's almost like the defining thing of this generation was when the trust there kind of fails us

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
If that makes sense

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Well that's how you were over the Xbox thing

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
Well sure

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
And you really do understand a lot more of the nature of marketing

31:12.000 --> 31:19.000
Watching the reactions between the two companies, how they responded to their respective hackings

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
Also digital, I mean because there was a big push for Xbox Live Arcade

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
And I mean that was something that happened

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
And also you know full size digital games

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
I mean granted I'm sure it was on the PC stuff a long time ago

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
But console wise you know digital has been a big thing

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
So it was that

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
Alright well I'm sure you guys sitting there listening to the show have plenty more to add to this

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
So I invite you to email us or tweet us especially while we're down during the week

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
And let us know what defined this generation be it game or news for you

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
That's mailbag at orangelandtrader.com or you can tweet us at OLR

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
One final thought Jamie

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
I'd say the crappiest thing about this generation

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
Manuals! We need manuals to come back

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
And we need these companies to hire me to design them

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
So in other words it's the downside to the digital stuff

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Exactly

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
The content is so beautiful I love manuals and I love posters

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
And I love getting stuff with my game that I can put on my wall

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
Or you know keep Midna from eating

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
Alright let's move on

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
I want to talk about our gaming weeks quickly we're running a little long tonight

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Because that was a great kick off topic thank you guys

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Let's quickly talk about our gaming week start Sakura

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
I'm not playing Animal Crossing right now

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
At all, am I?

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
Final Fantasy 14 I've been kind of stalling on that

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
Just because I'm on my second job and it's so slow

32:38.000 --> 32:43.000
I was gifted thanks to DNL Dreams who is so sweet

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
I gave her a box of yarn a while back

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
And she has in return given me the Stanley parable

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
So I will be playing it very soon

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
I played some fractal

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
I have been playing a little bit more of the Super Mario 3D world

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
But like I said 3D kind of eh for me

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
And Dan is playing Legend of Zelda

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
Which ever the Oracle of Seasons ones is

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Our thing

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
He just finished Mimish Cap

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Is he doing Mimish Cap now?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
He's doing one of them anyway

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
But Dan's going on this big Zelda kick lately

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
So my house has been full of Zelda music

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
And lots of loud cursing

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
And then in addition to that

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
It's just been me hunting down stuff on Steam that I haven't played in a while

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
And actually trying to get some use out of these games

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
And stuff I've gotten on sale before

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
So what about you?

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
I'm sorry I really read it

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Oh Reddit's funny

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
What have I played this week?

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Grand Theft Auto 5

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Yeah that would have been Grand Theft Auto 5

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
So I played a bit of online

33:56.000 --> 34:00.000
We did a very short Va game night this week

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Thanks to the one person that came out

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
I guess everybody else is doing more important things

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
But next week though

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Next week on Friday we will be doing

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Another Va game night

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
This time on Playstation 3

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
So if you have the Playstation 3 version of Grand Theft Auto 5

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
And wish to play with us online

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
We will be doing that

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
8.15 on Friday

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
I should get Dan in on that

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Because he would be hilarious

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
I mean he's hilarious anyway

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
And he's also funny looking

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
It'll be fun and I'm gonna try to get my coworkers

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
That are not too old

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
That won't fall asleep

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
I swear to god

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
It's just like

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
You know my boss half the time

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Yeah I totally forgot to play last time

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Because I got home and I just fell asleep

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
How fucking old are you?

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
You're not that old I mean seriously

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Naps are awesome what are you talking about?

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
It's like I was just so tired I couldn't play

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
And then my other coworkers

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
You were like Raz and Mike

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
You know our one IT guy

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Who just got the game

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
You're like I'll play you gotta make sure you're there

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Make sure you're there

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
He shows up everybody else does not

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
It's like what the hell man

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
But yeah we'll be there

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I'm still working on my 100% stuff

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
I'm doing the knife flights now

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Which I'm stuck on

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
One that's very near the

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Near the film lot

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
And it's a pain in the ass

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
I can't get the plane low enough

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
To trigger it

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
So I don't know

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
But I got all my stunt jumps done

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
And all my collectables done

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
And I'm at 96% or 7% now

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
So I just have to do knife flights

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Fly under some bridges

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
And go to the strip club with my friends

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
That's actually one of the things I have to do

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Alright

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
That it?

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
That's not a night in Los Santos without boobs

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
My gaming week was

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
A lot of Final Fantasy 14

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
As is to be expected as of late

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
But I'm having a great time in that game

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
And Shane is bugging me

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
As are other members of my free company

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Are bugging me to finish my relic plus one

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Quest so I do really need to do that

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
But otherwise just having a good time

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Getting my darklight gear completed and all that

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
As far as other new games to talk about

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Well this one's not new

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
But it's like a fresh coat of paint

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
On an old classic and that would be the Wii U

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Virtual console release of Super Castlevania 4

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
And I was playing

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Because that came out

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Was it on Halloween or the day before?

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
It was this week

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
And since I already had it on Wii

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
It was only like a dollar to get the Wii U version

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Which was great

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
And before tonight's show I was sitting here playing it

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
And it was on the TV behind me

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
And Dark Soccer goes

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
It's so weird that when your TV moves by itself

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Hey you know I was really proud of myself

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
When I stepped in and I recognized it just where you had it paused

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
I was like

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
I look super Nintendo

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Absolutely

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
So yeah

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
An amazing classic

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
And if for whatever reason you miss this game

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
And you happen to own a Wii U

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
I really urge you to pick it up

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
I imagine most people that are on the Wii U

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Probably already played this at some point

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
But it is so worth it

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
I mean even the fact that they charge $8 for it

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I think it's a worthy

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
I mean the game was just ahead of its time

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
As far as platformers are concerned

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
I love it so much

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Super Castlevania IV

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Love it

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Also earlier this week

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
And I know we're going to get into this in the news

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
So it might be a little bit redundant

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
But on Monday, I think it was Monday

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
The Typing of the Dead Overkill came out

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Which is the new Typing of the Dead

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Based on the House of the Dead Overkill

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Which was the Wii version of the game

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
So when I heard there was a new Typing of the Dead

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
I was like yes please buy

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Because it's what 50% off on Steam during the week

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
10 bucks yeah

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
20 bucks instead of 20 during the week

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
So I bought it and I actually did some streaming

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Which you can see the archive on my YouTube

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Under user RobRobertsPlays

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
I think it's my YouTube

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
I'm having to get used to having a YouTube channel now

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
But I think the archive is at RobRobertsPlays

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
On YouTube and you can see me

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
And I think Shane and Xtopher at some point

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Joined the call and we were just kind of playing through

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
The Typing of the Dead Overkill

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Which I remember Typing of the Dead on Dreamcast

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
And I loved that game

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
So I was a little sad in this new one

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Because the game's broadcast packs don't show on people's backs

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
And there's not even the PC or whatever

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
It's just kind of a straight up port of the Wii version

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
But I didn't play the Wii version

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
So I honestly thought it was like a brand new game

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
And I imagine there's a lot of you out there

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
That probably missed the Wii version

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
It was also on PlayStation 3

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Was it really? I don't remember at all

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Was it like a move game or something?

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
It was move enabled

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
I think it also allowed you to use the analog sticks

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
If you really wanted to

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
I guess I never really get into those games

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
On the home console

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
The last shooter game I really truly loved

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
At home was Point Blank

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
And that was a long time ago

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
That needs to come back

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Those games were amazing

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
I never really got into Time Crisis

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Or any of the on-rails shooters at home

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
That's more of an arcade thing to me

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
I never really played House of the Dead

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
It sounded like you said Ass of the Dead for a minute

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
There's actually a reason I did not buy it

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Because I need bad voice acting

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
In my House of the Dead

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
We're beating G over there

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
I do believe that this is the one

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
That had the most uses of fuck in it

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Oh my gosh

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
It's so over the top

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
And it's really dirty, nasty

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Dialogue and exploitation

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Films of the past

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Like Quentin Tarantino style

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
70s

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
It's crazy

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
So it was like House of 1000 Corpses the game?

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Kind of

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
If you're in the right mood for it, it's pretty funny

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Of course, the phrases that you type in

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Hilarious, the things that come up

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
We got one on the livestream that was

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Walrus Punch

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
I don't know why that was so funny, but it was great

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
And I saw a screenshot of one on the internet

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Where in the hospital level, there's a zombie

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
That gets up out of the bed and you have to type

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Thanks Obama

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
That was funny

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Ok, that's pretty cool

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Loved it

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
And a hitstun in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Says, I was also disappointed in the lack of

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
And yes, it contains House of the Dead

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Overkill extended cut

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Yes, if you want to use your mouse and play the clicky click

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Version, you can do that too

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
But for me, it's all about the typing

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
You know what though, I do have to say

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
That the best thing to ever come

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Out of Typing of the Dead

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Was Cosplay I saw at AX one year

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
That had the Dreamcast pack

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
And the keyboard and everything, that was awesome

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
That's awesome, amazing

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Alright, let's get into

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Gaming news

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
In housekeeping real quick though, before we get there

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Once again, I said this earlier, but just a reminder

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
We will not be here live next week

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
But I will be here live, just not on air

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Maybe you'll do a twitch thing

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Or something, I don't know

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
I'll do my homework

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
And let you guys watch

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
We're taking a night off, because you know what

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Sometimes we want a night off

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Sneaking myself off in Rob's luggage

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Also

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
In housekeeping tonight, I want to mention

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
That we unveiled something new

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
At vognetwork.com tonight

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
You can hear the in-depth discussion on the Bobby Blackwolf

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Show when he posts his episode mid-week

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
But in a nutshell

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
The game at vognetwork.com

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Now includes a

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Raffle element

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
So in other words, when you check into shows, you get your points

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
You do all that

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
You can potentially earn

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Real crap that we will ship to you

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
And this month's crap

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Is pretty good, it's Cards Against Humanity

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
It's a sealed version of a very hard to get game

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
So yeah, I'm sure there'll be some people that want to get that

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
So all you have to do

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
You have to enter though, you're not automatically put in

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Just because you get points, you do have to enter

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
And you can check that out at vognetwork.com

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Slash raffles, and I think that also shows up now

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
On the left side of the page

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Under your user info

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Contributors to the network

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
And people that have won in the past

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Few months will be ineligible

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
And unfortunately

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
This particular month's raffle

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Is only open to US residents

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Because it's really expensive to ship overseas

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
And it's coming out of our own pocket

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
So we can't have it yet overseas

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
But we're really hoping that some of the rewards

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
In future month will be digital oriented

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Which will be much easier for us to give to our overseas friends

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Because we want the game to be something

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Everybody can participate in

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
And many of you have been until now

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
So we just want to say thank you very much

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
And hope you enjoy this new little twist

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
On the VOG Network game

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
One other thing I gotta say

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
And then we can get into news

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
But this is important

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
And I want to wish a very happy episode number 400

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
To our friends over at Pod Culture

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Because they are hitting episodes

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
It's already been taped

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
But they are putting out episode number 400 this week

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
It debuts at VOG Network tomorrow

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
At 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
That's Monday

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
But then it will be on their feed right after that

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
And obviously 400 episodes is an amazing milestone

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Brad and his gang over there at Pod Culture

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Christina, Adam, all those guys

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Have been a great support of OLR

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Especially, especially Brad

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
And the support that he's given

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
These projects here at OLR

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
He supports Horde House in a huge way

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Like he helped set up the website

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
And get that show hosted

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
At Horde House

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
So I'm so appreciative for that

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
The microphones that we use here now at OLR

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Were kind of handed down from

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Brad from Pod Culture

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
So yeah, they've just been such a great support

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
And they're squishy

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
And they're squishy

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
With the little foamy hats, yes they are

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
They're squishy, mine's red, I like it

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
It's for our listeners protection

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
That's right, that's right

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
So yeah, I just want to say a big thank you and congratulations

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Because 400 is an epic milestone

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
I remember when you were just a wee hundred and fifty

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Alright

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
There you go, so congrats to all those guys

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Over there at Pod Culture

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
To register participation

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
For this week's episode of Orange Launch Radio

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
At vognetwork.com

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Alright, let's start with the gaming news tonight

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Loki, please, if you would, start us off with the news

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Well, you know, one of the

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Taglines for the Playstation 3

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Uh, this generation was

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
It only does, and then they list a ton of shit

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Well, this week they decided to put out a fact

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Or, they being Sony

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
They decided to put out a fact

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Outlining the stuff that the Playstation 4

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Won't do

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
And that includes a few things at launch

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Which, you know, of course you're gonna have to update

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Your system and stuff

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
It's gonna lack DLNA support

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
So you're not really gonna be able to

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Stream stuff from media servers too easily

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Also, no support

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
It doesn't feature a music visualizer

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
And that's

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Probably because it doesn't play any CDs

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
And also

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Dynamic themes are not supported

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Which makes sense because it kind of

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Changed the whole user interface anyways

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
And MP3 playback

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Is not gonna happen

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
And if you want to

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Listen to music

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Or see videos or that kind of thing

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
You can do that through

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Sony Musics

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
With their unlimited service

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
And video unlimited service

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
You know, actually

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Here's the thing

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
I'm not entirely sure that you can't stream stuff

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
To your PS4

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Because I remember the Wii

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Had that kind of problem too

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Where you couldn't stream stuff

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
But they had a lot of services set up

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
And it creates a web page on your network

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
And you just do it through the web browser

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
So there might be a work around

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
But that's essentially a hack

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
I mean, not like a hack

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Like you think we gotta do it

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
But it's a work around

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
It's still annoying that they did that

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
And the other thing they were saying too

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
The PlayStation 4 share button

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Record capabilities

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Apparently that is gonna be

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Kind of limited to

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Twitch

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
They're gonna upload videos to YouTube

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
And um

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Yeah but couldn't you just export your video to Twitch

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
And then publish it to YouTube

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Like that's what I would think you would just be able to do

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Well right now it says all the archiving's gonna be done

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Through um

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Twitch

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Yeah it's very easy on Twitch to take an archive and post it to YouTube

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
That's how I got like the House of the Dead things on YouTube now

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
So I don't know

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
I don't think that's a big deal

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
They have to have something in place if they want to protect

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Whatever they're doing

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
That makes sense

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
They're also saying Ustream footage will not be saved for later playback

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
So whatever

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Um

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
The other thing I was gonna mention

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
One of the things actually when Bobby was talking about on the show

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
And I had mentioned on the show

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Rob said, hey stay there for the show

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
My thoughts about the MP3 playback

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Cause it kinda sucks

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
And you know I've been seeing the conspiracy theory out there

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Where they're like, well they're just trying to get people to

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Participate in Sony's music unlimited service

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Or something like that

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
And there's probably another reason behind it

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
If you think about it

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
First off they have to build it in the game

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
So that you know to have MP3 playback

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
But let's just assume that it works with games

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Kind of like how it does now

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
When you're doing the streaming

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
And granted they could probably create a way to

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
I mean filter it out

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
But let's say they can't

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
So when you're doing your streaming

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
With your share button and all that stuff

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
There's possibility that licensed music is gonna be

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Part of the audio that's on that

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
And so maybe to get around that

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
That's why you can't do MP3's anymore

47:09.000 --> 47:13.000
Because if you have the Sony music unlimited stuff

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
That stuff's licensed by Sony

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Perhaps they've licensed it for broadcast

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
And you know if it's in your video

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Or whatever that you've made

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
It's not such a big deal

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
It's a very interesting thought

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
I should probably just throw out there

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
The point that there are many streams

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
On Twitch TV today

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Where the person's playing Warcraft

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Or League of Legends

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
And they're listening to iTunes in the background

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
So you do hear licensed music go out through Twitch TV

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
All the time and it's kind of a gray area

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
And Twitch kind of says I think in their legal fact

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
And I'm going off my memory so I apologize if I'm wrong

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Or misrepresenting

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
But I want to say it just kind of says

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
You know we don't really

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
We consider it kind of like fair use or whatever

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
As long as they don't complain about it

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Type of thing

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
They have no reason to go out and take it down

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Because it's just part of a broadcast

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
So it's kind of a gray area right now

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
But I think that's an interesting perspective

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Sony as a record label

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
As well as this

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Maybe has a vested interest in not having you

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Be able to stream your music

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
And it could be that they are just trying to sell more subscriptions

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
To Music Unlimited but let's be honest

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
If I have a PlayStation 4

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
I don't think I need to really

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Necessarily do that

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Oh the other thing too is it's not going to support USB

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Hard drive support or memory sticks

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
At launch

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
I don't understand the reason behind it

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Especially when it's something that's already in the PlayStation 3

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
I don't know why

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
But whatever the case

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
This is just at launch

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Stuff can change

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
One other thing though

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
That's come out

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Is the Xbox One will support

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Playback of CDs

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
It will also support

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
DLNA streaming as well

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
Although

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
There

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
I guess

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
It's a little different

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
MP3 playback you can't do

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
They're saying to do that

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
The system I guess is set up as a Play 2 receiver

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
And that means you can

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Use your Windows 7

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Or Windows 8 PC

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Or Windows Phone

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
I guess just stream to it

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Kind of like the Windows Media Center

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Buy our products

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Basically yeah it's kind of locked into that

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
So

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
I don't know I mean that's kind of annoying

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
But

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Whatever the reasons

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
It is a little disappointing

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
That you can't

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Out of the box use it as a media server

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Or something like that because that's why I use my PlayStation 3 for a lot

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
But I guess their thoughts

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Would be oh well just use your

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
PlayStation 3 for that or buy a PlayStation 3

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
For that specific purpose

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
It's still annoying

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
And hopefully later on maybe a year

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
From now or hey whenever I decide to actually buy

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
A console because I'm definitely not getting one launch

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
That these features will be added

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Back in so

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
I think it's just it's a matter of time

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Especially if people complain about it enough

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
They are listening so

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
It could change

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Some comments from our chat room live.vognetwork.com

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
PKJunior92 says I would think it would be

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Super easy to just not allow anything

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Playing locally to stream

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
I would think too

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
They are rushing to

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
This stuff is kind of in rush mode right now

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Maybe that's kind of like okay let's not worry

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
About that right now let's just

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Do this and then we'll fix it later

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
My thought with that is

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
That they might also be managing it

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Some of the similar way that

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
I've been using live stream lately

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
For a lot of my drawing stuff

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
And you actually can choose what channels

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
You have input into your stream

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
So I mean they probably have

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Like maybe a channel selector of some sort

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Brad from Pop Culture says

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
It's better to not have features to start out

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
And then add later

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Versus launch with features that get taken away

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Like other OS on Playstation 3

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
That is very much the truth

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Very much the truth

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Alright well let's move on with some other stories

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
This is

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
I have no better way to put this

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
And this is the tweet that was heard

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Around the world this week

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
And it was actually a

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Twit longer because it was too much for one tweet

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
That happened and

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
The person who wrote the tweet

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Was Mark Rubin

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Who I believe he's behind

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
The studio that makes Call of Duty Ghost

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
So that's Infinity Ward right?

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
So he made this tweet and it says

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Hey been on the road last couple weeks

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
So I haven't had the chance to update

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
But wanted to confirm that for Xbox One

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
We're 1080p upscaled from 720p

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
And we're native 1080p

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
On the Playstation 4

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
We optimized each console to hit 60 frames

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Per second and the game looks great on both

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Still on the road but glad to see the great

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Reception to extinction can't wait for next

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Week's launch

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
And yeah that went over

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Huge because

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
It was a huge opportunity for people to jump

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
On and say oh Xbox One's

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Inferior to Playstation 4 case in point

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
It's not just that either it's also Battlefield 4

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Battlefield 4 is

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
900 because they do this weird

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Shit where they always upscale stuff

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
It's been a thing that they've had on

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Halo 3 and Halo 4

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
A lot of other games they upscale

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
But like Battlefield 4

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
720p on the Xbox One

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
900p on the Playstation 4

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
So

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
I mean based on those

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Two games and speculating like

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Crazy it sounds like the

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Xbox One it's harder to get

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
You know

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
The graphics and stuff to be

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Where they need to be in order to get

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
The performance that you have on that system

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
That's what it sounds like it's easier to do it on the

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Playstation 4

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Let me ask a couple devil's advocate questions that are important

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
One 720p versus 900p

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Is there really

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
A difference

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Can I really see the difference between the two

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Is it that big of a deal

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
You'll note

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Well it was hard because they did

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Some side by side comparisons

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
But the problem is that the Xbox One version

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Doesn't have a patch for some of the anti-aliasing

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Stuff that they're going to have in there

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
So

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Right now it does look more

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Jaggy on the Xbox One

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Is that going to change when that patch comes out?

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Probably

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
So is it very hard to tell the difference between the two

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Yeah for most people

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
You're not going to notice a huge difference

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
But you know the more detail

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
That you have in there especially with these consoles

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Pushing more detail

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
You're going to notice it eventually

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
And also the other thing is

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
It's a next gen fucking game

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
It should be running at 1080p

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
In my opinion

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
I mean because what else

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
If it's running at the same resolution as a regular

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Xbox 360 game

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
And some Xbox 360 games

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Are probably running at higher resolutions

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Why am I spending $500

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
On this fucking system in the first place

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
What am I getting out of it that's different

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Than the Xbox 360 version

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Look at our chat

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
At live.vognetwork.com

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Rama says also if you're gaming on a 32 inch TV

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
You will not see the difference

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Bonds006 says though

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Yes there is a difference

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Rama also speculates

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
I think that because of the usage of system memory

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
PlayStation 4 is using GDDR5

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
And Xbox One is using DDR3

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
That could be it

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
GDDR memory is for video cards

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
The other devil's advocate point I wanted to bring up

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Is weren't we in this exact reverse

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Situation last generation

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
And I specifically think

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Of the game Oblivion

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Cause I seem to remember

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
When that came out for PlayStation 3

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
People

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
And it came out a year after it was out on 360

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
And people were like it sucks

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
And the slowness of the blu-ray drive

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Holds it back and it's graphically not as good

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
It's buggy

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
But did that really ruin the PlayStation 3?

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
No

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
So

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Well I will say this

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
It didn't help the PlayStation 3

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Get a great start out the gate

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
That generation. PlayStation 3

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Had some really kick ass exclusives

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
To finally close the gap a little bit

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
And come out looking okay at the end of the generation

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
But here's the thing

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Yeah they're gonna find tricks to

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Make it better and stuff

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
But out the gate though

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
There is an advantage already

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
It's not as even as it might be

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
And I mean

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
For some people that's not a big deal

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
But when you're spending

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
$500, $400 on a new system

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
You're gonna be paying attention to

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Every single

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Especially when you're looking at games

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Like if I'm looking to play Call of Duty

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
That's a game that's not exclusive to one of those consoles

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
I'm gonna be looking at every damn thing

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
And if it runs better on one system than another one

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Like for example if I was buying a next gen system

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
For Oblivion or Skyrim

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
I wouldn't be buying a PlayStation 3

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Cause it ran like shit

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
On the PlayStation 3 until about

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
8 patches later

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Then it finally ran okay for Skyrim

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
I'm not sure if they ever fixed Oblivion

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
It took a long time

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Well

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
I think

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
I do understand that point

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Of wanting to have the capability to run

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Higher

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
But there also I mean you gotta think about the average person

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Who's gonna be able to afford having the huge

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
TV that will show it off

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Like I mean

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
For me

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Yeah I would want all of that

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
But if the average player isn't gonna have the TV

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
To show it off

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
It's still going to look great either way

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
More comments from our chatroom at

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
live.vognetwork.com

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
DungeonBuster says Bethesda had little experience with the

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
PlayStation 3 at the time too

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
They've gotten better though the problems with Skyrim's

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
DLC still point out issues they have with it

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
And Extover says

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
I say it's too early to tell, let's wait until next year

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
When next gen exclusives come out more often

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
You know that is true

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
These are launch games and every other generation

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
We've seen that you put the launch games

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Next to the games that come out

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
At the end of the generation and you see

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
The progress, you see how far

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
You know developers learn to push the limitations

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Of the system

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
So yeah maybe

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
The Xbox One lags a little behind

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Here but they could catch up as developers

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Learn how to work with them more right?

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Let's be honest officially between the current gen

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
And next gen games you're not gonna see a huge

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Difference especially on these multi-platform games

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
I mean granted they're gonna have some better physics

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
And stuff like ooh moving grass

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Oooh you know

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Leaves are rustling but you know

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
For a lot of people it doesn't matter

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
They're gonna, the majority of the copies

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Of Call of Duty are gonna

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Be sold on the Xbox 360

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Like they are every other year

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Last comment from our chat then we'll go to Dark Soccer

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Story, BlackWolf says

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Frames per second or FPS is more

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Important than resolution anyway

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
A constant 60 frames a second

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Outways the number of pixels on the screen

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Amen I agree with that

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Immensely because like I'll play Final Fantasy

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
14 and crappier graphics settings

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Just to get it to run smooth

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
That's more important than it being pretty

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
So anyhow let's move on

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
We could debate this all day long as people

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Have been doing on the internet for a long time

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
But we have a lot of show still to go

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Who remembers the pocket station?

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Me. Do you remember the pocket station?

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
I have one. I need to steal Julie's

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
I mean borrow Julie's. Isn't that how you

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Like raised a chocobo in Final Fantasy 8 or something like that?

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Hell yeah. Yeah and it also had a

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Stat mode for um

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
What was that game?

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
She reads Justice Gakuen

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Evolution, the rival school's

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Second edition that came out on

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
Playstation. And it had, I don't remember if it was official

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Or non-official but it had a wonderful

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
DDR you know

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Non-stop course editor for

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
The fourth mix. Yes. Yes.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Well um

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
There was a teaser that came out

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
There's basically this

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
Four minute Playstation

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Japan video

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
That's out that teases

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
The uh pocket station

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Um so we could

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Possibly see something

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
Similar to it coming out with PS4

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
I mean of course this is just a hint

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
At it. Nothing you know

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Etched in stone or engraved

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
In metal I should say. But

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Who knows? I mean

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
I used the hell out of my VMU on my

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Dreamcast. I think I carried like three VMUs

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
On my keychain at one time. Cause I had my

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Chow, Dan's Chow and um

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Godzilla. It could make a very

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Interesting iPhone or Android app

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
I was gonna say it's gonna be an app. It's not

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Gonna be a device. It just seems very

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Obvious to be a great use

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
For the app. I think it would be fun

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Mhmm. Especially if they have the little cat

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Cause I love the cat

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
The little uh

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Mascot that's like shown up

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Ever since. It would be

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Awesome because you know they can

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
The Playstation 3

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Can play the older games which I'm assuming

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Is a matter of time before you see that on Playstation 4

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
As well. That they you know bring out

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
The library of old PS1 and 2 games

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
That would be really awesome if you could get a

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Pocket station emulator on your phone

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
I know that might be asking too much but I think it would be

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Really cool. You know what would be nice is

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
Using if you get that emulator

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
And um

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
They start you know bringing out

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Localized games that we never saw

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Sort of like how Nintendo's doing with the

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Wii U. True. True.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
That'd be fun. Alright.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Let's move on. Loki.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Alright. Um

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
So Microsoft has put out a brand new

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Privacy policy

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
They were talking about

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
How they collect data

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
And this is mainly referring to

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
The Kinect

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
And talking about

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
What features they record

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Basically

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
The Kinect camera

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Actually records some information as far

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
As like you know your facial recognition

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
And stuff. But it saves that to your console

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
So that's actually not shared

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
They did say though that you could

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
I guess turn off

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
You know of course the Kinect features at any time

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
And the voice I guess

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Commands are captured but I don't think those are

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Shared. Skype though on the other hand

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Well nothing's guaranteed to be

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Private there. So

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
I guess they can get that

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
If you want. Which is not surprising

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Cause I think they're already sharing it at the end

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
So anyways

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
And then

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
The thing that's kind of been the bane of my

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Existence at least on the Xbox 360

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Right now

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
They want some updated

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Contact information for your safety

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
So like second

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Ways to contact you via like

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Email or

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Texting you or phone calls and stuff like that

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
I've tried to put

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
My information in there a few times now

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
And it never fucking takes

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
It just says

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Oh I don't have it. So now I just back out

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Of it every god damn time because

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
I've already put that stuff in there

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
The website said it was confirmed

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Yet it keeps nagging me for fucking information

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Over and over. It'll send me the text. I'll confirm it

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
It even sent me the text

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
And I was gonna confirm it on

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
The Xbox 360

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
No sorry you have to visit this website to do that

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Like then why the fuck are you nagging me through this

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
But yeah

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
So anyways now if you

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
I guess you could link your service account with

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
You know some other stuff

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
And you have to have some sort of like

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Name, address, email and all that stuff

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
And that's just to

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Protect the hacks and all that right

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Yeah they claim

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Yeah it can text you if somebody's trying to spend a lot of money or something like that right

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
I think it's more of like

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Second way to authenticate yourself

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
You know cause Google does that

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Now Steam does it

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
With emails

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Makes sense I mean I appreciate

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Them at least you know trying to

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Protect things like especially after having money stolen

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
In the Xbox 360 very easily

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
I appreciate that they're taking the extra step

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Even if it's a little sloppy

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
From Loki's perspective

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
And also you know just as a reminder

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
You know you probably

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Want to make sure that you go to

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Xbox.com and go to your account

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Settings to make sure that

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
You opt out of all of the

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Sharing of that information with

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Microsoft parties and company affiliates

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Resellers, distributors, etc, etc, etc

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Cause I'm sure that they

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Conveniently left that on

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Of course, of course

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Alright

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Moving on to some highly controversial

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
News this week and

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
This one just really blew me away

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
And

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Oh boy this is

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
We just had a comment earlier in the show

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
About somebody said

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
It's better to add a feature after the console

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Comes out than to take something away

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
I believe that was Brad

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
We are seeing

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
This week something getting taken away

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
And it's Nintendo who

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Disabled the swap note application

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
On their

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
3DS and it's due to

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
The exchange of quote

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Explicit material

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Now it should be pointed out

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
I may have overdone

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
It there cause they didn't disable the entire app

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
But they disabled the spot pass feature

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Which for most people was the

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
App that means sending the notes through the internet

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
So you can no longer send pictures

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Of your cats through the internet

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Because some kids

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Were exchanging explicit material

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
And I guess they just found this out

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
What two years after the app launched

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Some users were exchanging

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Offensive material

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
The feature was deactivated to quote

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Limit the risk of any inappropriate

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Activity or misuse of

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
A service

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Further quotes from Nintendo's notice quote

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Nintendo has learned that some consumers

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Including miners

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Have been exchanging their friend codes

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
On internet bulletin boards and then using

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Swap note known as Nintendo letter box

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
In other regions to exchange offensive

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Material

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Nintendo has been investigating ways of preventing this

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
And determined it is best to stop the

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Spot pass feature of swap note

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Because it allows the direct exchange of photos

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
And was actively misused

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Nintendo always wants to provide a positive

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Experience for all consumers

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
And limit the risk of any inappropriate activity

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Or misuse of a service

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
We feel it is important on this occasion

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
To take this action

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
We are very sorry for any inconvenience

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
To the many consumers who have been using this service

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Nintendo will continue to work to ensure

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
More consumers are aware of our parental control

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Features which allow parents to manage

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Their children's experience on our systems

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Okay

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Nintendo just now learned this

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Two afters after the fact

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
That if you give teenagers

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Access to the internet

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
They are going to take pictures of their penis

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
And send it to their friends

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
It took you two years to figure that out

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
This is why

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Everybody drags Nintendo

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Over the fact that they don't understand

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Online

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
This news story certainly doesn't do them any favors

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I am

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
I am just shocked

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
At the

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Like

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
I don't even know what word to use

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
A degree of naivety

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Naive

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
God dammit

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
I keep wanting to say naivety

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Because it's Christmas

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Naivety

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
It is not remotely Christmas it's Hanukkah first

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
I mean Thanksgiving

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
But I'm just

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Blown away by

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Honestly

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Honest to god it took you two years to get to that point

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
And now you're taken away

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Because kids look up porn online

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
And yet

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
You leave the internet browser

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Which you've made, I'm sure you've made

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Terrible on purpose

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
The first thing I did when I saw this news story

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Is I went to my DS browser

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I pulled up gay porn

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
And I took a picture of it and put it on Twitter saying

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Well Nintendo didn't really remove the porn from my DS

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Now did they?

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
But they removed the child porn

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Well what is it

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
That I told Bobby

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
When he tasked

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
The shows over to us

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
There are two things you can have

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
On a device the moment it comes out

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
And that's porn in Linux

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
It's true

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
I just

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
I was talking

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I was at a fun little party last night

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Which is why I'm a little hungover today

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
I was at a fun little party last night with Captain Spike

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
From Game Buoy and Slidekick was there

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
We love those guys

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Matt or Grandpa from Hoardhouse was there

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
So some podcasting friends and some other people

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Were all at this party

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Spike and I were talking about this a lot

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Spike's a big Nintendo fan and I understand why

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Nintendo does make some great games

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
As I said earlier

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
The game I'm most looking forward to this holiday season

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Is a Nintendo game

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
A Nintendo game in many ways to find last generation

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
He was throwing out a theory

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
That maybe this has to do with the 2DS

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
The fact that the 2DS is marketed

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
A bit more towards children

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Because Nintendo is more actively

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Pursuing the kid market

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
And they have to pay a little more attention to

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
What kids can actually do with the device

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
And although I totally understand that point

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
And respect it

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
There's a part of me that goes

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Well god damn it

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
When are we going to put some onus on the parents

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Because a kid doesn't walk into Toys R Us

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
And plop down $130 on a 2DS

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Somebody drove them there if they do

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
There is a lot of irresponsibility on the part of parents I think

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
So put the 2DS in a giant envelope

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
That says parental warning

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
In big red letters

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
To disable internet

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
On this device

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
But you know the thing

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
And this goes a little bit into marketing too

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Is that when you have a system

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
With a warning label on it

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
You have a chance

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
That a parent is going to

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Just see the warning

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
And go oh well I don't want to do this

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Risk it's easier not to deal with it

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Than have to work for it

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I've got too much else on my plate with my kid

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Or how can I watch everything all the time

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
It's better just to not get it

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
I see it that way too

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
And here's the other interesting thing

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Swapnote for all practical purposes

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
I think is one of the more innocent applications

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
I love to use it for cat pics

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
And writing little notes

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I get excited about

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Seeing the stuff that comes through

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Meanwhile they've shut this down

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
But guess what still works on my Wii U

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Video chat

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
So right at this moment

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
I could go on and I could call

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Whoever's on their Wii U right now

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
And I could say hey look at this

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
And pull down my pants and show them my balls

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
I mean is Nintendo

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Going to shut down the video chat too

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Because heaven forbid

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
A child unsupervised

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Uses the device because the parents were too lazy

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
To enable parental controls

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
And starts showing their goods

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
To predators

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Which again

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
I'm not

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Don't misunderstand me

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
That's the terrible thing

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
And people who prey on kids like that

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Should have horrible horrible things done to them

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
But I think there has to be responsibility

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
On the parents part

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
That if you put a device like this in the home

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
You need to watch what your kids are doing

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
I would like to respond to hitstun by the way

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
And what does hitstun say in our chatroom

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
At live.vognetwork.com

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
They just patch out photos

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Well I mean it's not stopping people from

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Drawing things either

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
And photos were the best part

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
So how are you supposed to share your photos now?

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
I like photos of pussy

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
What's the point of having a 3D camera on the thing

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
If you can't share it with anyone

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Because you can

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Take them off on your SD card

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
And email them

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Swapnote came after the launch anyway

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
So you can technically still view them on your card

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
And I guess hypothetically

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Yeah you could email them or something

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
But it really did

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
And I saw the word used in chat here

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
PKJunior92

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Nintendo neutered the service

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
It really neutered the photography

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
And even Nintendo's own

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
You can take the screenshots

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
In Animal Crossing

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
And they touted that as a big feature

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
And how you could like

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
I'll be honest

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
I've done one screencap through Swapnote

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
And all the rest of them I pulled off my SD card

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
And put on my Tumblr

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
I need the ones that are on my

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Fan page on Facebook

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
I took those

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
On my game

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
And just copied them over

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Because they come across as I believe as JPEGs

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
If you don't use the 3D mode

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Alright so

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
There you go

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
I'm just very disappointed in this news

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
It's like every time you think

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Nintendo gets it

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
They don't

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Oh by the way

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
There's an app called WeKaraokeU

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
And I don't believe that's here in the US

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
I think that's something that's only available in Japan

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Because you know

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Karaoke is a little bigger overseas

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
WeSing or something

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
I don't think that has any karaoke in it

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Yeah but there's this WeKaraokeU app

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
And by the way this app contains mature language

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Songs in it

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
There was some tweet that was going around that was really funny

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Where it shows the little me in it singing

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
We fucking in the bed

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
We fucking on the floor

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
I don't know what song that is but it's just really funny

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Sure that's not a Lily Allen song

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
You know Reddit's blowing up with all this

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
So it's just

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
And people are just making a point out of this

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
It's like Nintendo

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
You still can do many adult things

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
If you want to with your console

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
It's JoySound is the

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Karaoke thing

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
And if I remember correctly I do believe a JoySound game has come out over here

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
For the Wii

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
I don't believe it's on the Wii U yet

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I think I remember that

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
But it's just

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
It's a little ridiculous

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
And unfortunately just you know

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Extenuates the reason why Nintendo

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Constantly gets ridiculed

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
For not understanding online

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
And this doesn't make me feel a little more comfortable about their situation

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Sorry to say

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Alright

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Let's move on

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
With more news, DarkSakura

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
You know I feel a little bit like

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
I don't want to take from

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Bobby's interview earlier

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Think of it as giving him a cheap plug

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Yeah so I'm actually gonna say

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Hey everyone if you want more of the information

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
On this make sure that you go listen to Bobby's show

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Which you can download on iTunes and blah blah blah

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
And blognetwork.com

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
So but I am gonna go ahead

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
And tell you what happened

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
And there's a

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
A company called Wadjet Eye

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
And that's

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
W-A-D-J-E-T and I love

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Companies with mythological names

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Just cool

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
So anyway

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
There was a game put out called

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
And it was put out for free

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
There were codes that you could download to play the game

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Well people were taking those free codes

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
And setting them up to resell them

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Which I think is shitty

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
So

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Basically they just took them all down

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
And said well no

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
We don't want that to happen but

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
It wasn't necessarily the codes that went down

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
It was the page that went down

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
So well the link to the page that went down

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
So basically people were still going to that

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
And getting all the codes

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
So there's about

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
30,000 codes worth of games now that have been

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Removed from Steam

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
And I believe it was 30,000?

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Didn't he say? Yeah he said this during the interview too

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
That you know he just did those last

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
30,000 from like the time he went to bed

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Cause he was up for 30 hours because of the situation

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
On his anniversary that's shitty

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
But um

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
But anyway um

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
It

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
It just

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
I'm not gonna say it baffles me that people will

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Use the generosity of others

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Because it happens I'm sorry

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
If you've got people

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Who think they can make a profit off of

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Other people they're going to do it

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Humble Bundle all the time this happens with Humble Bundle

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Which is why that changed

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Yeah we talked about it on the show that people are eBay-ing

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Their codes on the Humble Bundle

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
To people that don't know any better

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
It's really tacky

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
It's

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
I wouldn't just say tacky

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
It's I would put it up

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
In the realm of purely unethical

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
We just have

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
This faction of greedy people

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Which I'm not going to go into detail on that one

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Um

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
But I think that it was

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
What

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
What Dave Gilbert did

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
That was who Bobby interviewed before

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
I think that was purely necessary

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
I think it was the right step to take under the situation

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
And yeah there's people pissed off about it

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
But

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Look at it as

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
The rotten apple spoiling the bunch

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
You have a lot of bad apples

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Spoiling all of it

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
For everybody

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
So if you want to be mad at anybody

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Be mad at the people that were abusing the system

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Not at the person who was the victim of the abuse

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Yeah I and

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
One interesting thing we learned from all this too is that

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Steam can pull games from the library I thought that was interesting

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
We haven't really heard of a case of that happening before

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
But he does talk in his interview with Bobby about

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
You know the ethics

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Behind doing that and that you know

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
You don't want to abuse something like that or Steam's never

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Going to let you sell games or want to work with you again

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
So I thought that was very interesting

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
And there was another point with people

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Being angry because they couldn't get their game

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
On Steam

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
But that doesn't stop you

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
From linking your game with your Steam account

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
You can still run everything through Steam if you want

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Your functionality of Steam with your game

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
How do you think I get all those pretty cut scene

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Screen caps of Final Fantasy 14

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Right

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Alright well let's travel around the world

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
And check out some release dates

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
That you can buy

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
And then you can resell if you want

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Because it's a little more ethical

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
When you actually bought it in the first place

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
But anyway let's travel around the world and check out release dates

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
And what's coming out soon

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Alright so this week we have Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000

Wii U and PC

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Because you know

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
You gotta be cool

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
And get those Playstation 4 discs

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
A week before they come out

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Hey look I got this game

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
I'm totally gonna not play it for a week

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
So it's gonna take some getting used to

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
That now we have to throw in Playstation 4 releases into the mix

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
But I guess this happened before with Wii U

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000

The Travel Adventures with Hello Kitty

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
On 3DS

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
And the game stick

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
I sure know what I'm getting Rob

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
No no no hold off

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
You gotta wait for Hello Kitty Cruisers

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Or whatever that was

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
The Mario Kart-esque game

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Oh yeah right

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
That'll be fun

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
20 bucks

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Rob I think you're worth at least 20 bucks

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Alright I'm covered for Hanukkah

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Alright

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Alright let's move on

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Going to Japan I would read Playstation 4 dates

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
But remember they're not getting theirs until next year

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
So we still have a little while before we start

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Getting those dates in Japan

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
But we can read what's going on on the Playstation 3

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
And coming out on November 7

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
We have Akiba's Trip 2

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Battlefield 4

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Book of Spells

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
2K14

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
And Oni Chambara Z Kagura

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
With No No No

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Comes out

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Oh Rocksmith 2014 X4 will be happy to hear

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
That Rocksmith 2014 get exposed to Japan

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
As well

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
It's going to be big in Japan

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Is it big in Japan? I don't know how well

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Music games are still doing in Japan

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Was Rockband and those other games really

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Selling in Japan?

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Rockband I don't remember

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
I think they did get a release

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Well regardless

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
If you happen to have a friend

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
In Japan who wants to learn how to play the guitar

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Rocksmith 2014 is out this week on November 7

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Oh my god you know what I'm suddenly

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Thinking of in my mind

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Rockband Visual K Edition

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Where it's all like

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Malismizer and

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
I don't think they localize the music

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Or anything when they put it out there

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
I just think it would be fun

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Alright so there are some price reductions

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
As well in games like Tekken Tag Tournament 2

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
But I want to get to the

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Xbox 360 and some of the games coming out there

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Battlefield 4 is out there as well

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
And NBA 2K14

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
And Rocksmith 2014 out in Japan

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
This week as well on the Xbox 360

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Going to the Playstation Vita

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Battle

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Destiny gets a price reduction

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
It's already out, but there is a new game called

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
X-Tetra

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Comes out this week on the Playstation Vita

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Going to the Wii U this week

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Nothing

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
But you do get Call of Duty Ghost

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Next week since we'll be here next week

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
And Super Mario 3D World

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
In a couple weeks, I guess I'll be touching on that

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Again when we come back

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
And on the Nintendo 3DS this week

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Metal Max 4 Gekko no D.Va

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
X-Tetra

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Comes out there as well

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
And there is a Monster Hunter 4 Hunter Pack

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Limited Console Bundle out this week

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
As well

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
There's also another Tamagotchi game

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Seishun no Dream School comes out

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
On the 3DS this week

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
And that does it for Japanese releases

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Dark Sakura, how about the UK?

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
There's a few things in the UK

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
On the 6th we have Call of Duty Ghost

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
For practically everything

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
And Castle Storm for the Sony consoles

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
On the 7th is Wii Sports Club

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
And the 8th is Mario & Sonic

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
At the Sochi

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
2014 Olympic Winter Games

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
The end

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
The end

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Bobby Blackwolf bringing some clarity in chat

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Blackwolf says

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Rock Band Japan was a thing that failed in development

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
They talked about it at their PAX East panel

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Licensing was a mess and they wound up

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Giving up on it

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
I thought they got some version of Rock Band in Japan

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
But maybe it's just

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Maybe they got our version subtitled

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Yeah licensing was probably a mess

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Maybe the import store

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
That I see Japanese releases on

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Maybe they were kind of going the other way

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
And helping Japan get the English version if they so wanted

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Because Japan imports stuff from us sometimes

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Alright

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Before we get to the classic game of the week

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Just a few more stories for you guys

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Loki

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Here we thought we were

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
All done with the online pass

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Because EA gave up on it

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
That was that

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
And

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
THQ went out of business

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
There's two companies

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
But nope

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Ubisoft decided hey you know what

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
We're going to put a brand new online pass

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
I'm sorry

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Uplay Passport

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
That's going to be part of

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
And then that not only will

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Grant you access to the online

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Portions of the game

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
But it also locks away

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
The game's fleet management system

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
That was part of the single player campaign

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Now

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
That's not such a big deal if you're buying the game new

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
But of course if you're going to buy it second hand

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
It's going to cost you ten bucks

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
It's still kind of like really

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
You put that in there really

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
I mean come on

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
And people got pissed off about it

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Well

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Ubisoft decided hey you know what

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
We're going to get rid of it

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
And we're going to actually start now with Assassin's Creed IV

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
So they went ahead and

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
They're going to

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Now have that code

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
You still have to get the code for

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
The Uplay Passport

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
But it'll be a free download

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
You just go to the PlayStation Network

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Or the

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Xbox Live Marketplace and you just

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Download it and basically

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
It allows you to do that for free

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
And they're not going to have it in any future games

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
It says the Uplay Passport was initiated

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
As a means of giving the customer full access

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
And support for online multiplayer

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
And features along with

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Exclusive content bonuses and rewards

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
However

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Games today are blurring the lines between

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Offline and online

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
And single player and wiz multiplayer

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Come on man it was a single player campaign

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
There's no blurring anything there

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
And based on that

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
And feedback received

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
We recognize that the Passport is no longer

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
The best approach

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Maybe just because people are calling you out and you're fucking money

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Grubbing you know tactics

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Is what it is you know

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Yeah it's not the approach so now we're just going to have to

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Microtransaction everything to be continued

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Is basically the way I see it

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
So um

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Good on them I guess

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Now we only have to get on Warner Games

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
And Deep Silver

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
I mean seriously

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
What the fuck with Saints Row 4

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
You know I thought

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
We were done with that when THQ went out of business

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
And if it's not

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Deep Silver I'm going to blame Volition

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Those motherfuckers you know with

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
You know here I thought it was THQ

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Forcing them to you know

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Hoard the DLC for that game

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Nope it was them

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Alright well um

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Before we get to the classic game of the week

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
This is this is I don't

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Words escape me and I think a lot of us

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Again here's another story

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
This week where a lot of us kind of looked at this

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
And went like how can this happen

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
This is awful

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
During this weekend a lot of folks

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Out there were participating in a charity fundraiser

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Known as Extra Life which is a

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Video game fundraiser

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
It's gamers doing good which is the stuff we like to report

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
On it's raising money for the Children's Miracle

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Network Hospital

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Well during the fundraiser

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
The website for Extra Life came under

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
A DDOS attack which is

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Denial of Service

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Directed Denial of Service Attack

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Basically meaning a bunch of people

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Hitting it all at once to try and take it down

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
But they they and you know

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
I think the first thought that comes with this is

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Well was it just too popular and all these people were trying to hit it

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
No they came out and said

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
We believe we were under DDOS attack

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
And somebody took down the charity website

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
For a couple of hours

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
And luckily they were able to get it back up

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Only to have it taken down again

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
At 4.45 pm

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
I believe that was yesterday

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
It did come back up at 5.48

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
So after about an hour

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
But if you think about it

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
By the way Black Wolf says the first E is distributed

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Whatever

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Anyway

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Whatever it stands for

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
It's a pretty shitty thing to do to a charity organization

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Especially when it's gamers trying to do good

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
And you know all these people

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Were trying to donate

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
And they couldn't through the site

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Because everybody that's doing the stream is trying to point people to the site

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
And you know they couldn't

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Make the donations

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
So you know obviously there was a lot of pissed off people

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Online about like how could somebody

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Be so shitty to take down

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
A charity

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
And I have a couple schools of thought on this

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Is that one there's shitty people

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Out there period

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
And you know just like we had an unfortunate

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Horrible incident in the real world

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Where a guy went and shot a guy at an airport

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
And shut down LAX for a few hours

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Like how could somebody be that shitty

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
You know there are shitty people out there

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
And we have to do whatever we can to

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
You know stop these people

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Whether that's through getting help

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Or through you know whatever

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
I'm just curious

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
What there is to gain

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
From taking this down

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Because I can't think there would be an internet organization out there

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
That would be like heck yeah

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
That would be rude over all these sick kids

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Like who would want to take pride in that

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
I'm not sure

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
There are people who enjoy being assholes

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Yes and I

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
I think it could be

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
And I don't want to sound like too tinfoil hatty

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
But it could honestly be a cyber

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Terrorist organization

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Or it could be someone who has a vested interest

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
In making gamers look bad

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
That sounds like a script kitty to me

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
You think it was just one crazy person

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
I think it's some juvenile kid

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
That's like hehehe

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
My other thought was that maybe they were trying to

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Intercept the credit cards somehow

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Maybe but I don't know how you

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
But I would think

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
You know again

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
I think this whole situation is shitty

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
And I feel shitty for even going here

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
But is it possible that somebody

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Was after the credit card transactions

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
And somebody wanted to get all

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
All these instant credit card numbers

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
And things coming in in a very short

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Amount of time people wanted access to that

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
You wouldn't DDoS a site to do that though

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
That would be like installing

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
A trojan or something

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Or somehow getting access to their database

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Or something

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
DDoSing something is not going to really do anything

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
As far as I'm aware

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
ActDeft quoting a movie

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Saying there's people that just want to

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
See the world burn

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
And BlackWolf says

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Sky the lulz

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
I don't think anyone's laughing

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
No

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
You know it's one thing when

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
You know maybe they take down

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
CNN.com or

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Hack an LA Times article to say

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Butts butts butts butts or whatever

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
They do

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
That's one thing

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
But you know charity organization

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Raising money for sick kids

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
I don't think anybody's going to laugh at that

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
That's just a special kind of dickery

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Yeah

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
The whole butts thing is an awesome dickery

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Just macro every single

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Key on your keyboard to type butts

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
When you type it

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
BlackWolf says I think the people who did it

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Were laughing

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
I think it's important to make sure

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
If they're laughing

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
What sick individuals

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Would be laughing at this particular situation

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
I think it's important that if

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
For whatever reason we know these people

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
We hang out with these people

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
We talk to these people

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
That we let them know they're sick

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
If you

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Endorse this or you laugh at it

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Too then that's just

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Encouraging it to happen and I think you need

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
To kind of put your foot down and be like this is not

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Okay

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
I think it was an attention grab

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
I mean seriously the reason why people

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Do asshole things like that is because they know

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
It's going to rile someone up it's the worst kind

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Of troll

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
It's why I don't give

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
PETA any attention anymore

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
It's why I hate

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Bringing

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Yeah it's a big thing and definitely needs to be spoken out against

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
But I also don't want to give these people the time of day

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
You know I'd like to think that

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
All of us and the people who listen to our show

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Wouldn't hang around that kind of person

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Right

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
That's why I'm not sitting here going

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
If you're the person that did this you're an asshole

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Because I'm like no that person's not listening to this program

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
But I would like to think

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
That our listeners are decent people who have good taste

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Absolutely

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
And definitely a

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Higher level of ethics

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Than these people do

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
But you know

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
It is a small world I learn that every day

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
And even though you might

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Not know somebody directly who is involved with this

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
You might know someone that knows someone

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
So you know

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Be that change

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
And let people know it's not funny

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
And it's not okay

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Alright

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Let's move on let's move on to happier things

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Such as gaming history and

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
You know the things that brought us to where we are today

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Every week here on the show

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Dark Soccer likes to take a step into

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
The classic gaming vault

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
And find a game that she thinks hey

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
You kids out there you should be playing

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
This video game

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Stop learning how to put butts on the

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
L.A. Times and play this

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Classic game

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Dark Soccer what is the classic game of the week?

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
The classic game of the week is Shin Megami Tensei

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
You'll make a lot of friends

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
With that choice

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
I'm pretty sure plus I have to say

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
That as I have not spoken to

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
My dear friend who is such a fan of this game

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
CatastrophicMagi

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
On

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Steam for a while

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
I dedicate this one to you because you were the one who

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Introduced me to the series

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
As in depth as I know it now

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Shin Megami Tensei

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Means true goddess reincarnation

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
And I am referring to the first one

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
That came out on October 30th

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
1992 for the Super Famicom

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
And it is based off of Megami Tensei

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Which is a novel

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Infamicom game

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
This one is the

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
First of the series

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
At least in the Shin Megami Tensei series

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
To be put out by Atlus

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
This one in particular

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Starts off

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
It's a first person RPG

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
So

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
In fact it actually is a lot like

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
What was the series? Wizardry

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
So you go through different dungeons

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
And you have up to six characters

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
And it's turn based

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
A field of vision

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
So basically you walk up to the corner

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
You turn the corner

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
You have two types of characters

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
You have humans and demons

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
And you have to collect demons like pokemons

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
So your human

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Will acquire the demon

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
By either negotiating, bribing, or coercion

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
During a battle

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
You have them

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
You can store them in your computer

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
And summon them for money

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
To use in battle

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
And they feed off of a secondary currency

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Called magnetite

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
So

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
If your demon is defeated

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
In battle then they have to be revived

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
So like I said it's got that Pokemon element to it

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
It has

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
A

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
A method of controlling

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Multiple demons

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
By calling them Akumagata

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Which is demon fusion

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
So you can

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Basically use

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
You can combine your demons to be

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Like this powerful gestalt

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
You also have firearms

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
You have special ammo that goes with it

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Melee weapons, you have armor

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
You have only certain things

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
That can be wielded by certain alignments

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
And as far as your demons go

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Each of them have their own different statistics

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Like I said it's kind of Pokemon like

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
They all have permanent

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Abilities in this game

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
That changes with the later two

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
And they can't

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Be changed at all

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
So with this

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Your demons are

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Are basically

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Your tools for fighting

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
In the game along with your regular armaments

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
You have

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Different types

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
You have

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Pixies

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
You have angels

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
You have all kinds of

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
You have ghouls, you have all kinds of different ones

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
So the alignment of your demons

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Are two different types

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
You have light neutral dark

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
And light neutral chaos

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Or law neutral chaos

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
So basically it's kind of a D&D style

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Alignment system

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
So you can have true neutral

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
You can have chaotic dark

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Which I guess would be chaotic evil

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Law is associated with God order and peace

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Chaos is with you know

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
The devil and freedom and war

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
And then balance

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Is the neutral one too

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
So your human characters also have

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Alignment as well

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Now I'm not gonna go

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Too much into the stories basically it's demons

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
On earth and they're changing the balance of power

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
And you have to stop them

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
So you have your characters

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
You have your hero that you name

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Yourself

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
In sort of the game

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
In Apocrypha there has been

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
A name given of Kazuya

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
In the Steven

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Report 1

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
There is a heroine

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Which in that same thing she was given

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
The name Yuka

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
You have a law hero, a chaos hero

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
You have a girl named Yuriko

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
You have Steven which is a disabled computer programmer

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Who writes the demon summoning program

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
You have a character named Goto

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Ozawa

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
You have just a bunch of characters in this game

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
I'm not gonna go into it but those are like the major characters

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
It also was imported later on

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
For the PC Engine Super CD ROM

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
And Mega CD

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
And then re-released for Playstation

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
And Game Boy Advance

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
To build hype

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
For Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Famitsu gave it a 30 out of 40

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
The original

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
That was the Playstation 1 by the way

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
The original version got a 36 out of 40

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
From Famitsu

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
There's also a manga spin-off

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
It's out in English

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
All kinds of stuff

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
And of course we have

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
So many different games now in the series

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
And that have

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Come out in English that anyone

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Can enjoy it but I do know for a fact

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
There's a translated ROM

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Out of the first one so you can

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Find it

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
And play it through whatever means you deem

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Necessary

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Is Shin Megami Tensei

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Yeah sorry about all the beeping I was trying to find some better music

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Because the first three YouTube

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Videos I found were all like the same music

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
And it's happy

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Well that's what the game sounded like

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
So there it is your classic game of the week

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Of our show

And we were

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Talking a lot about kind of like this

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Generation of gaming earlier on in the show

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Because we're not gonna be here next week

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
So when we are back in two weeks

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
The Playstation 4 will be out

Gaming generation and it'll be

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Interesting to see what the reception

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Is of those systems when they launch

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
I'm surprised you didn't play my generation

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Oh maybe at the end

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Maybe at the end

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000

You know whether that be on

iTunes like a nice five star review

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000

Or you know I don't know if you guys know this

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Stitcher now does the reviews and the

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Star ratings and Stitcher is a great

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
App as well that's

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Got a lot of people to be able to access our show

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Without having to worry about downloading and

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Syncing podcasts and yeah Stitcher's a

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Great application so

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Awesome and Bobby Blackwolf

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
In our chat room says speaking of award

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Shows tonight Bobby Blackwolf says you were

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Up against the YouTube music awards

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
But apparently those were a big old

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Bag of dicks

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
I

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Yeah I heard it was going to be very experimental

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
And I'm sure

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
It went wrong but we'll see alright

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Let's go back and do some gaming news

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Rapid fire news here Loki

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Did that one Chinese food

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Song win or whatever it was

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
One can only hope

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
I mean that's what I think

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Of when I think of YouTube

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Best lyric of our generation

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Chow ma ma ma main

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Ah yes anyways

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
So let's talk a little bit about

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
South Park

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
South Park

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Seriously what's going on with you

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Delayed

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
To March

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Unfortunately

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
And I was so hoping

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
That it would come out in December

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Because there was nothing coming out in December but

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Yeah

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
And uh

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Just because it's not done yet

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Really and they showed some gameplay and I

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Thought it would be pretty cool

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Yeah I'm very much looking forward to this game

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
I'm a little disappointed about the delay but

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
You know get it right take the time you need to get it right

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Don't rush it it's fine

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
If it comes out finally we'll all forget about the delay

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
So it definitely happens

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Right Grand Theft Auto fans?

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Speaking of Grand Theft Auto 5

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
29 million fans

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Have already forgiven it

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
And it's already um

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Well they shipped that many to retail

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
But they pretty much sold

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
And that means if

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
And that's within 6 weeks

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
So couple more weeks

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
It will have outsold

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Grand Theft Auto 4's

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Time sales so that's

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Not bad for 6 weeks

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
And last but not least

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Something I'm kind of excited about

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
The 7th guest 3

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Is going to be a

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Possible game that will be coming out

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Full motion video and all

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
The 7th guest if you're not aware is a

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Pretty old PC game

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
It was a puzzle game

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
And the 11th hour

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
The second game in the series

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
They're trying to kick start a third

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
For $435,000

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Oh my god is there a reward

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Tier level where I can be in the game

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
In one of those cheesy full motion videos

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Because it's kind of awesome if so

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
If I had money I would so

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Want to do that

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
I don't know let me check

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
They're at $39,000 right now

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
And they have 35 days to go

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
And

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
It would like literally be my dream

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
To be one of those corny full motion video actors

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
In one of these games

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
$1,000 get your name on an object

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
In the mansion

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
$5,000

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Your name and likeness in a painting

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Or photograph in the mansion

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
You could be in the game Rob

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
$75,000

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
$75,000

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Scary animated portrait

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Of you in the mansion and producer

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
In game credit

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
And no there is not a way to be

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
An actual

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
An actual

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Can I campaign to be

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
One of the cheesy full motion

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Video actors in the game

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
You would have to like probably contact

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
The

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Creator and just give them lots

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Of money and say hey

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Can I forgo all those things

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
That be like actually in the game as like

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
A character

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Nice

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Alright yeah so if

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Anybody behind that game and that Kickstarter is listening

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
We'd love to get you on for an interview

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Wink wink or maybe I can hassle you about being

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
In the game wink wink alright

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I'll do it dressed as Frank

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
No alright

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Moving on I'm being a little bit

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Reductive here talking about something I already

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Talked about earlier in the show but I will

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Mention The Typing of the Dead Overkill

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Was a surprise that was brought

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Out this week Sega didn't

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Really mention that they were working on it there was a

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Few teasers here and there but it did come out as

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
A surprise so Typing of the Dead Overkill

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Was released it was available

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
For $10 but you might have missed the sale

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
That was only through November 1st so now

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
It's going to cost you $20 but you know what

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Doesn't Steam always have a

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Christmas sale or excuse me a winter

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Holiday sale or whatever at the end of the year

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Yeah so you know if you really

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
It is almost December ween

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Yeah if you really have to get it cheap you have that to look forward

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
To so but honestly

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
It's still worth even $20 if you want to play it

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Right now good times and

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Yeah there it is Typing of the Dead Overkill

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
It is out and I'll give

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
A cheap plug for my YouTube channel one more time

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Rob Robert just plays and you can watch me actually play

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
The first hour or so of the game

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
Um it has been announced that the

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Male Wii Fit Trainer will also

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Be a playable character in

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Smash Brothers for Wii U and the

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
3DS just like you have

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
I don't know you kind of have like Zelda and

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
And Sheik are kind of the same

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
But not really you know

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
That's what they're kind of doing with the trainers

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Model swap yeah the male Wii Fit

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Trainer is the exact same character as the female

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
One it's just like a it's a costume

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Swap of sorts I am so

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Looking forward to beating people up with the power of yoga

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Right but now you can do

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
That I think it would actually be cooler if they

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Just left the male trainer out

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
I know they're just trying to pad the roster but

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Whatever yeah I don't know

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
It's just kind of one of those oh neat

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
You know yeah but it's not like

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Oh well now I have to pre-order this

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Knowing that I can play a male Wii Fit Trainer

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Just changes everything not really

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
It's just kind of one of those like oh neat

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Type of things and it would be kind of neat for those

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
2 vs 2 matches to like you know

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
You could play Wii Fit Trainer vs Wii Fit Trainer

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
But you guys actually look different

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
And it's not just a pallet swap that's

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Kind of neat for what it is

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
But yeah little news piece there

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
And lastly a follow up to an

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Interview we had a couple weeks ago you might remember that

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
We had the guy behind

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Retro Magazine that Kickstarter was here

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
On the show and he's with Game Gavel as well

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
So Cal Mike was what he went by

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
And he was trying to raise the money there for Retro Magazine

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
And was having a little bit of a hard time

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Getting coverage because

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Apparently a lot of commercial websites

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
Won't run the story

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Because it's competitive

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
And I guess I didn't really realize

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
This but it should be obvious that

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
In these commercial for profit

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Blogs and things they literally have anti

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Competitive clauses they will not run a piece

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
That could promote something that competes against it

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
That's one of the great things about the indie

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
World because we are the exact opposite

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
You know when an indie podcast asks

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Me to plug them I'm like heck yeah sure

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Let's help each other out right

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
In fact we grow more

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
From helping each other out than trying to like

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
I have no tolerance for people that try to take each other down

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
I have no tolerance for that

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
The only clause we believe in is the Santa clause

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
I do worship Santa this is true

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
But anyway

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
We got off on a little tangent but my point I was really trying

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
To make is that thanks to the

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Indie scene and all the people that were helping get the

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Word out about this they met their goal

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Yay and I think

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
If I'm not mistaken they might have hit

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
One of their stretch goals even they really

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Shot up in the last few days

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Now hire me

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
They ended up with $75,000

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
All together and I believe

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
That was going to cover a couple of the

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Stretch goals

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Dang look at all these people here

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
I'm trying to find it

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
$62,000 was met meaning everyone

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Gets a collectible sticker with the first print

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Issue and there will be an increased page

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Count yay

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
For me

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Alright anyhow

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
So congrats to Retro Magazine I look forward to

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Having my first issue I did back it

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
I kicked back like $35 or so just enough

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
To get the year subscription of the magazine

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
I look forward to having that on my

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Strewn on my kitchen table

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Where we table LR very soon

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Along with Kid Icarus Rising and

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
What's that pink thing?

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
This man bag? No

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
I know what the man bag is

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
This is a little game called Pink Hijinx

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
It was in my GamerX loot bag

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
That I just haven't played yet

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
It's like this game involving little pink pyramids

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
I thought it was a pink Tootsie roll

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
No I would have eaten it

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Chocolate

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Less chocolate more news

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Well we do have some news

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
There was a hack

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Into the Pokemans

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
And there are two

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Mega Evolutions were

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Released

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
We have

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Let's see what they are

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
It was released by Smeelum

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Who created the first

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Homebrew Portal game for the DS

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Said that there is a Mega Evolution for

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Latios and Latias

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Um

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
They are

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Ugly

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Ugly mon

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
I don't know what they're called

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
But they're kind of ugly

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
So yeah you can look online and find them

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Also there is an ESR

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
B rating saying that Gradius 5

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Might be going to PS3

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Which I freaking love me some Gradius 5

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
But that game is some hard shit

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
But that would be awesome

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
There is a T for Teen

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Rating on it

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
So uh who knows

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
I would like to see it there

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Maybe with some goodies like maybe doing Gradius 2

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
As a throw in you know

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Because Gradius 2 is the best

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
And then Steam has hit a milestone

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
65 million active

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Users

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
That's a lot of people Rob

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
That's a country

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
A small country

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Not a medium sized country I'd say

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Way to go Steam

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Good job

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Congrats

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
The winner is you

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Didn't they say that's bigger than Xbox Live now

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Yeah

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Alright let's get to the FUGL question of the week

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Ladies and gentlemen

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
You take Facebook

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
You take Google Plus

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
You slam those words together

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
You get FUGL

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Which by the way I'm happy to announce

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
You can reach our Facebook page

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
At Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
But you can now reach our Google Plus page

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
At Google.com

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
They finally have those short URLs

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
And we were able to get one for OrangeLoungeRadio

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
It's weird though because you do slash plus

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
But if you've seen the Google URLs

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Go to Google.com slash plus

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
OrangeLoungeRadio

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
No more disgusting sequence of numbers at the end there

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
So you can be our friend on Google Plus

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
And do those things that Google users do

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
And when I figure out what that is

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
I'll let you know

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Alright let's

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
You answer FUGL questions of the week

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
That's what you do and this week's FUGL question of the week

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Is probably similar to something we asked before

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Admittedly when these systems were first announced

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
But

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
With us not having a show on 1110

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
The next time we have a live show the Playstation 4

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Will be out so

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
This is the last unofficial poll to see what systems

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Our listeners are getting this holiday season

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Are you or do you plan to buy

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Before the end of the year

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
A Playstation 4

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
An Xbox One

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
A Wii U

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
A 3DS or a Vita

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Or something else or none of the above

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
And why

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Did you ultimately decide the way you did

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
I will try to read everybody's

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Answers but some of the longer ones

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
I'm going to cut really short

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Just for time's sake because we did get a lot of answers

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
Tonight and I don't want to go on forever so I hope you'll

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Understand and read all the answers in their

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Entirety at Facebook or Google Plus

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Redertainment says due to

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Project Buy a House

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
None of the above

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Soutoure says none of the above

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Because the Playstation 3

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Gran Turismo excuse me

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Gran Turismo 6 is enough for me for now

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Sam H says none of the above

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
I have too many current gen games

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
To go buy and play

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
E3VL says

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Already pre-ordered the Playstation 4

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Since it's the cheaper console

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
May purchase the Xbox One

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
After it has a price drop to play the

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Exclusives

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Act Def says I plan on getting a Wii U

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
And upgrading my PC

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Why do I want a Wii U?

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
I think there's enough games I would actually play

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Like Super Mario 3D World and Rayman Legends being the main ones

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
And Cyber Judge says

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
I planned on purchasing a Playstation 4

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
But with recent good and bad news I received

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
I'm no longer purchasing an

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Next gen console in the foreseeable future

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
I do have a Vita I'll end up getting a

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Playstation 4 when I am again able

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
So that was about half nothing

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Half mixture of Playstation 4 and Wii U

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Xbox One a little later

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
We got a lot of people on Facebook

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Let me try to get through these

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Andy R says buying a Playstation 4 at launch

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Mostly because it's new and shiny

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
And I'm a consumer whore

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
That's my reason too

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
KJ says I preordered a Playstation 4

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
The timing of the release of the console

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Is my main reason

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
I paid off the Playstation 4 little by little

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Not in one lump sum

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Xbox One will have to wait for a price drop

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Renji2214 says

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
I'm thinking of getting a Wii U

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
For the holidays this year

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
I haven't seen anything that interests me on Playstation 4

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Xbox One and with Super Mario 3D World

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
And Mario Kart 9 and the new Smash Brothers

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Next year I think the Wii U has a little more

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
That I'd be interested in

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Our old pal 23rd Magus

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Or what is it, Drunami

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Drunami replied and said

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
I know better than to buy a system

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
At launch, even the DS took a year

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Before it had more than tech demos

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
X2fer, our pal from Hoardhouse

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Said we're getting a Playstation 4

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Already have a Wii U, no Xbox

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
One yet, no plans to get a 3DS or Vita

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
LOLU

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
He just threw that in there to

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Kick them

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Matt says other

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Every year around or on Cyber Monday

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
I spend money that I've saved towards upgrades

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
To my PC

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
I figure if I spend a little money every year

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
I can keep my PC at near optimal settings

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
This year I'm gonna get a new graphics card

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
A second monitor, whatever's left over will go towards

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
A device to help me stream games

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Our friend Sil from Girls Gone Wow

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
I love Sil

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
I love you Sil

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
And I love your hair, it looks so cute

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
She's amazing

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Girls Gone Wow is on our network

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Wednesdays at 9am Pacific

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Noon Eastern

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
They're really early because in the UK it's 5

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
I want Sil to kidnap me

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Not the other way around, I want her to kidnap me

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Fair enough

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Anyhow, Sil says I really want a Playstation 4

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
But can't afford one now

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
I'll wait until much later when they have newer versions

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
And I can get it second hand

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Or perhaps I should just livestream with more cleavage on display

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
So I can get money

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
But it's important to note she put a little angry face

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
What do you call that line underscore line face

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Like the grrr face

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Unfortunately she had some ignoramus on Twitter

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Say something about her livestreams

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
And it's like

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
People

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Grow up

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Giovedea from Anime Jam Session says

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Which you can hear Tuesdays here at VOG

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Says 3DS with a few games

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Not interested in the Wii U

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
And I'll probably pick up the Playstation 4

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
After a price drop so I can play Kingdom Hearts

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Xbox One hasn't impressed me so far

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Degenerate Johnny says

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
3DS because of Pokémon XY

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
And I don't want to be pressured into getting the next gen

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
I still have a pile of current gen games

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
I haven't even touched yet

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
When I finish this shrink wrap pile and I'm feeling comfortable moving forward

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
I'll consider a next gen console

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Until then, I'd rather bask in the here and now

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
AZHP says

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
None of the above

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
My backlog of games is so huge that I honestly don't need a new system

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
And none of the games are really drawing me

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
My friend is lending me her 3DS

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
So I can play Ace Attorney

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
But other than that, there's nothing I want to play badly enough

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
To buy a system at this time

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Burr says

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
I'm getting both the Playstation 4 and Xbox One

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Because I have the money to get in on this console launch party madness

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
I know it's not the most objectively smart thing to do

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
But I'm going to enjoy some enthusiasm

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
For the next generation for now

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Well, you know, I think

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
That's a good way of looking at it

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
I know this is a lot to be spending

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
But I'm going to have fun with this

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
JVMonset also says

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
I'm getting both

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Though the Playstation 4 had zero interesting games at launch

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
I believe it has potential in 2014

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
CriticalMyths says

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
I cancelled my Playstation 4 pre-order

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
And I'll be holding off on any new consoles until 2014

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
I'm too backlogged on games

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
For my Playstation 3, Vita, and 360

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
As it is

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Doug T says

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
I'm buying the Playstation 4

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
My preference is Sony

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
I have massive Playstation 2, 3, and Vita game libraries

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
I'm still buying the Xbox One next year

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
But decided to pass

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Due to Microsoft's initial stance

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
And then over a few weeks

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
Constantly changing what they were doing with the system

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
I don't trust their position with Xbox One

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
They could change their stance again

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
GamerGirl says

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
I'm not bothering to buy one until further down the road

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
I enjoy my Playstation 3 too much

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
And the first batches always have glitches

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
So I'm going to wait

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
I don't even have a Wii U

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
DDRDollarBill says

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
That's a good rule

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Hitstun says

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Screw all that, I want a Retron 5

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
I've got plenty of old games

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
I still have to finish

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
And the Retron 5 makes them look nice over HDMI

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
That's a very creative answer

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Reginator says

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
I'm a ways off before I buy a next gen system

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
I want to replace my Playstation 3 first

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
If I were to buy one

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
I'd lean towards a Playstation 4

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Fifth Dream says

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
I have my Playstation 4 pre-ordered with release day delivery

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
If I were to arrive

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
I've just always liked Playstation

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
I never got a Playstation 3 because I was required to have a 360

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
For a tech support job

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
And never saw the reason to get both

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Blood Drunk says

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
None of the above

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Going for a good old fashioned video card upgrade

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
PC is where it's at

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
And James S says

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
I have my Playstation 4 paid off

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
And I'm ready to go

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
As well as the special edition Zelda 3DS

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
And I'm going to ask for a Vita for Christmas

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
The reason is because

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
I'm simply just one giant man child

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Well said

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Considering I'm in a very similar position

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Although I've got to admit

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
I'm starting to waffle a little bit on the Playstation 4

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
I might cancel it

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Because a combination of things

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
I think it's the three game rule

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
That one of our listeners said

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
In their response

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
And just the fact that

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
I would really be interested in upgrading my PC

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
A little more

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
And that you start to weigh what's more important

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
A Playstation 4

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Or being able to do more stuff on your PC

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
And if I look at where I really spend most of my time

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Gaming, it's on the PC

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Dan and I have had a similar discussion

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Because I'm really working on trying to up

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
My own design stuff

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
And I need a computer that's going to handle it better

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
Plus I play on the PC

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
More than anything anyway

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Just don't be surprised if you guys come back in two weeks

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
On the show and hear that I cancelled my pre-order

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Because it's something I'm strongly leaning towards right now

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
It's likely going to happen

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Keep in mind, buying a game at launch

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Is not usually a good idea

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Or a system I should say

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
So that's interesting

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
None of us are

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Assuming I cancel my Playstation 4

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Which is the likely case at this point

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
I said on this show right up until the day it came out

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
I'm not getting a Wii U

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
And then of course what happened about a Wii U?

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
None of us will own a next gen system except my Wii U

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Does this mean we have-

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
That doesn't count

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Wii U is not a next gen system

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
I'm sorry

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
It could be like a separate parallel

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Dimension system

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
But it's not a next

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Generation system

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Regardless of where you place it or how you feel about it

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
This is a ride shoe compared to a Pikachu

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Does this mean we have to stop doing a video game podcast

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Because we're not gaming enough

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
To be on the cutting edge of the new generation

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
No

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
No I also

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Obviously I agree with you

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
I have a PC I can run games

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
I have a PC

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
At least a third to half of those answers

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Where people saying nope not right now

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Or getting systems that are like 3DS's

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
And Vita's and things that are already out there

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Well and Dan and I already said we're gonna wait until

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
There's more stuff out for it that we want

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
We're sitting on a $100 gift card

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
That we're gonna put to our-

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
We've decided it's going to our PS4

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
We're just not getting it yet

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Besides I wanna make sure there's no shapes or lights of death

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
On anything that I'm planning on purchasing

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Probably if I get a PlayStation 4 this year

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
It's gonna be because I got it for free

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
I'm not actually gonna buy one

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
I'll wanna get one before February of next year

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
When Final Fantasy XIV starts on PlayStation 4

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
But um

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
You know I don't- by then I'll have a tax refund

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
I can spend on it too

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
So it's something I have to put in perspective

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
So keep in mind guys

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
I know we've been doing this podcast a long time

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
And some of you have stuck by us a very long time

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
And I really really appreciate that but the reality is

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
We don't make our lives off this show

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Once in a great while we are extremely lucky

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:38.000
To get a review copy of a game from an independent studio

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
Or something but the reality is

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:43.000
It's not like they're shipping us free consoles and things like that

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
So just like you have to think about

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Do I have the money to spend on this console

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
We have to ask ourselves the same question

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:50.000
And sometimes the answer is

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
No I'd rather spend the money on a ticket to Atlanta

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
So I can go to Dragon Con next year

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:55.000
You know type of thing

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Or whatever it is

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Alright

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Anyhow moving on

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
We'll do some more news and then we'll get to

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Our phone calls pretty soon here

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
At 1877 Game OLR

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
You can yell at me for changing my mind if you want

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Although I'm not, again

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:11.000
You're allowed to waffle

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Again

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Waffles are delicious

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Waffles are fucking good

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
And I said here on the show

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.000
I'm not getting a Wii U

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:18.000
I'm not getting a Wii U

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
What happened that Sunday when you all came to the studio

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:21.000
I'm playing my Wii U

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.000
So you never know

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Because you're a consumer whore

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:24.000
And how

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Back to news, Loki

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Alright so Minecraft has

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Done something quite interesting

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
There's an update I guess is going to be coming

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
And it was announced at Minecon

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Apparently if you have the PC or Mac version of it

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
You will be able to

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Soon

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Stream to Twitch straight from the game

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
And you'll be able to link your

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:47.000
You know

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
Twitch TV account

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
To the actual game

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
And it'll allow you to stream I guess natively

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Which I think is kind of interesting

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
And of course you know

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
I guess you'll be able to do it on

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
You know the Xbox One as well

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Because I think they're going to have

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:04.000
Twitch integration

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
But that's kind of something separate

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Speaking of the Xbox

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
There is some new

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:11.000
DLC coming in

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Yet another

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Reskin of the game

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Much like the Mass Effect

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
Minecraft mod that they had

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Now they have the Elder Scrolls Skyrim

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Texture set

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
It comes with 40 character skins

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Themed menus

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:26.000
User interface

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000
And craftable items

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Also 20 songs from Skyrim as well

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:30.000
And

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:31.000
The best part about it

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Is it comes with a pre-made map

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
That

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
I guess recreates areas of

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Bleak Falls Barrow

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
Whiterun and Riverwood

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
So that's pretty sweet

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
That is pretty neat

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:48.000
I need to check out some of these themed

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
DLCs they have going on on Xbox

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Because I know they have the Mass Effect one

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:52.000
I never checked that out

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
But the Skyrim one sounds cute too

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Yeah so

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
I think that's pretty sweet

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
At some point I need to go back to Minecraft

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
But I'm just too busy with Grand Theft Auto

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Alright

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Moving on to information about Wii Sports Club

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Remember Wii Sports Club?

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
This is the thing they're doing on Wii U

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
That's kind of the reinvention of

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
What many were saying were

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
The game of last generation, Wii Sports

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:21.000
And I had no idea about this

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
But there was an article

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:24.000
That they run called

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Owada Asks

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
That was talking about the release of Wii Sports Club

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
And he said quote

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
I'm sorry actually this is not

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Owada that said this

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
But this is developers behind the game

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
Kozo Makino and

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Takayuki Shimamura

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Said about Namco Bandai

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Being involved in the development of this

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
I had no idea they were involved

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:44.000
But Makino says

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
We asked Namco Bandai Studios

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:47.000
To develop it

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
So I first participated as a coordinator

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
But in the end I got into just about anything

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
I mainly worked on the network aspect of the game

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
But at times I made suggestions

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
On how some features should turn out to be

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:58.000
And Shimamura says

02:01:58.000 --> 02:01:59.000
From the middle of development

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Makino-san and Suzuki-san

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Were also working as full fledged planners

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
We did ask Namco Bandai Studios

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.000
To develop the game this time

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:07.000
But staff and Nintendo's

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
Network development and operations department

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
The software planning and development department

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:12.000
That those two are in

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
And EAD also chipped in

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
So that's kind of neat

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
That Namco Bandai is involved

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Confirmed Pac-Man a playable character

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
No I'm just kidding that's not confirmed

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:23.000
But you know

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
I'm a little disappointed that Nintendo chipped in

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
On the network portion of it

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Right

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
That's not exactly where they're the strongest I think

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Yeah a little

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Especially after this week's news

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.000
I'm a little worried about that

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:36.000
But if it really works

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
I think the idea of a Wii Sports

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
That's online is really cool

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:41.000
It's a bummer

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
You know they can't use that camera

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
To be able to like show my friend

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Playing Wii Sports

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Although I'm sure there'd be people out there

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
That'd be like look I'm gonna swing around naked

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:51.000
I'm doing a helicopter

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Rob don't worry

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:53.000
This is plan B

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:54.000
You do understand

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:55.000
This is plan B

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Because remember this holiday

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
They do have a brand new Wii U skew

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.000
That has the new Super Mario Brothers U

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
And you know

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:04.000
New Luigi U as well

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
If that fucking fails

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
And can't sell the game system

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:09.000
You better believe

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
They are going to include this

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
With the next skew that comes out there

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:14.000
To try to drive sales

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Oh I'm sure

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
And they just dropped the price

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Nintendo land pretty heavy too right

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Did they drop that down to 29 bucks this week

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:21.000
I think happened too

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Or it's coming up very soon

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Not surprised the game's coming in

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Yeah well if it's not the packing game anymore too

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.000
You know it's gotta

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Getting its price dropped

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Would really help it sell

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
One other interesting note

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:36.000
You may not want to read too much into this

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:40.000
But there's a Wii U exclusive trailer

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:41.000
That Nintendo has

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:44.000
It's for the 2013 and 2014 lineup

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
That shows Wii U exclusives

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Bayonetta 2 was in the trailer at one time

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
It's not there now

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Some people are reading into this that

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:54.000
Uh oh

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
It slipped to 2015

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:57.000
I don't

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:58.000
I don't know

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
I think people might be reading a bit too much

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Especially the people that are saying

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Oh well this means it's no longer exclusive

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000
No

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:06.000
They've said many times

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:07.000
This game would not be happening

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:08.000
If it wasn't for Nintendo

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
And it's going to be exclusive

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:11.000
So um

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Yeah

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
But uh

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.000
It could just be that there's nothing new to show

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
You know they want to keep the game a secret

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:20.000
I don't know but it wouldn't

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.000
It honestly wouldn't surprise me whatsoever

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:24.000
If it's going to be pushed back all the way to 2015

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:25.000
Wouldn't surprise me

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
I hope they have a strong enough 2014 lineup

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
To keep selling Wii U's

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:32.000
I'm sure they've got something under their hat

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Maybe the Zelda game will be this year

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:35.000
They'll probably be this year

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Yeah maybe the Zelda game will come out sooner than we think

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
I'm still thinking holiday next year

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.000
I don't think it's going to be any sooner than that

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:44.000
I'm pretty sure it's all hands on deck for Zelda Wii U

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.000
But we'll see

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Anyway

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Let's move on

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:48.000
Dark Sakura

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Well in other news

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
We do have

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
As soon as it actually works for me

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:56.000
There we go

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:00.000
There is a new Neo Geo game coming out

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:04.000
We have Neo XYX for Neo Geo MVS

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
And yeah for the longest time

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:09.000
The last one out was Samurai Shadow 5

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
So we're starting to see new ones

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
It was actually done by NG Dev Team

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:16.000
And it is a shooter

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:19.000
That's their third scrolling shooter

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
That's going to be out on the MVS

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
And their fourth overall MVS release

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:27.000
So I watched a little bit of this earlier

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:30.000
And it looks pretty neat I have to say

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Fun shooting game

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.000
But it's nothing SNK of course

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
It's always fun to hear about

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
New games coming out for old consoles

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
There's still love out there for it

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
I love when people do Dreamcast games

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Yeah right

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
I want some of them still

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Act Def in our chat room

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Reminds me of a very obvious Nintendo game

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
I should have remembered for 2014

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
Smash Brothers

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
I'm sure that's a given for next year too

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:57.000
I think that'll finally be done

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:58.000
That'll be good

02:05:58.000 --> 02:05:59.000
And Mario Kart 8

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:00.000
Yeah there is Mario Kart 8

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
Wasn't there a rumor that it is

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
I think the date was out there

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
April 25th I want to say

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Now granted that was a UK date if I'm not mistaken

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:11.000
But isn't that later than it was originally said

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
And remember I said when Donkey Kong got delayed

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
It could have been a sign that Mario Kart was delayed too

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:16.000
I think they have a

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
They're probably going to try to

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Make sure they have a release every month

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
So they got Donkey Kong in February

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:25.000
There's still no real date for

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:26.000
I mean

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:27.000
They have Wii Fit U

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:28.000
They have the meter out for that

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:31.000
But they don't actually have a physical bundle for it yet

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:32.000
That's been announced

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:33.000
Unless that's December

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Because there's really nothing in December

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:36.000
Gran Turismo

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:37.000
It's your month

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Oh yeah don't forget Wii U owners

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
If you have a balance board Wii Fit U is out

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Yeah

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
I should check that out at some point

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:45.000
And if you have a balance board

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
You already pretty much have Wii Fit U

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
I mean it's only a little bit different

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
You have to buy a meter though

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
So make sure you get your fit meter thing

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
I'm trying to think what else there was

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Smash Brothers and Mario Kart

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
I mean those are supposed to be some point

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:01.000
And then

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Nintendo has a tendency though to kind of surprise us

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:05.000
With little things

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.000
You know and they're doing their own thing now

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:07.000
With these Nintendo Directs

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
They're not adhering to any schedule

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:10.000
For release of news

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
I mean granted they'll save some of their biggest stuff

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:13.000
For E3 week

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
But I wouldn't be surprised if they don't do a press conference

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Again next year

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:17.000
And do what they did this year

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:18.000
So anyway

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Let's move on with some other news

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Alright

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Logie

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:24.000
Final Fantasy XIV

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
Doing pretty well now that they

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Rebooted

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:28.000
Has it gone up a level?

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:29.000
Yes

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Yes I'd say

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
1.5 million registered accounts

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:35.000
That's not bad

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:36.000
I'd say that's worth

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:37.000
You know

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:38.000
The reboot

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Dark Soccer is doing the Final Fantasy 1 victory animation

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:41.000
With the hands

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Up and down

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Do do do do do

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:44.000
You know what just went into my head

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Was the Brentalfloss thing

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:46.000
You just got pwned

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:47.000
FTW

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:51.000
So yeah

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:52.000
That's cool

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:53.000
And definitely I think it'll be neat

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.000
When the PlayStation

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:55.000
They say the PlayStation 4

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Beta version is playing

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
I guess the same day as the Japanese PlayStation 4

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:00.000
So

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:01.000
February

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:02.000
Yep

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Cool

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Very cool

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Yeah

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:06.000
We just heard not that long ago

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:07.000
There was a million Final Fantasy XIV

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
So it's going up in subscribers

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.000
That's gonna

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:12.000
You know

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:13.000
That's gonna make this year's BlizzCon

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Very interesting

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Because you know

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:16.000
There's a little

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:17.000
You know

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:18.000
This MMO

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:19.000
Final Fantasy XIV

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:20.000
Has still got some steam behind it

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:21.000
Now granted

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:22.000
You had Star Wars

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:23.000
And you had

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:24.000
Rift

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:25.000
And you know

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Some of these other ones too

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.000
But

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:28.000
You know

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Blizzard

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:30.000
I wonder if they're starting to feel the pressure this year

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:31.000
There's a lot of pressure

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:34.000
To make or break World of Warcraft this year

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:35.000
With this next expansion

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Eventually the bubble's gotta burst

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Yeah

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:39.000
It does for everything

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:40.000
Well some have said it

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:41.000
It burst a long time ago

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:42.000
Cataclysm burst that bubble

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:43.000
I think this year

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:44.000
For example

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Call of Duty Ghost

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:46.000
Is not gonna outsell

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Black Ops 2

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:48.000
It's not gonna happen

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:49.000
And I think

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:50.000
I don't think

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:51.000
It might not even be the top

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.000
Game of the year

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:53.000
Because of Grand Theft Auto coming out

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:54.000
That was huge

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:55.000
29 million copies in 6 weeks

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Good luck

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:57.000
I mean that's just gonna be hard to do anyways

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Even if it was an excellent game

02:08:58.000 --> 02:08:59.000
But just

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:00.000
I don't think anyone really cares

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:01.000
And I think

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:02.000
The same with

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Wow

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:04.000
There's a lot of

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Other things

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:06.000
Competing for attention out there

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:07.000
In the

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:08.000
You know

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.000
MMO space

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:10.000
So

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:11.000
They have to do something

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.000
To really

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.000
Interest people in playing it

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:14.000
And I just don't think

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:15.000
They're really doing that a lot anymore

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Alright

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:17.000
Well

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:18.000
Moving on

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.000
To the final

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Final Fantasy XIV

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Final Fantasy XIV

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:22.000
Final Fantasy XIV

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Final Fantasy XIV

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:24.000
Alright

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:25.000
Well moving on to

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:26.000
One of those

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:27.000
You know

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:28.000
This is a case of a tweet

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:29.000
Giving people a lot more hope

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:30.000
Than maybe they should have

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:31.000
But you never know

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:32.000
And

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:33.000
It's also about a Square Enix game

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:34.000
You know

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:35.000
Like Final Fantasy XIV

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:36.000
It's about

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:37.000
The Dragon Quest series

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:38.000
And I don't believe

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:39.000
There's been a Dragon Quest game

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Out here in a while

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:41.000
We did get

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:42.000
We did get Dragon Quest IX

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:43.000
Right

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:44.000
We did get that

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:45.000
But then

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:46.000
What there was

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:47.000
Dragon Quest Monsters

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Joker 2

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:49.000
That was like 2011

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:50.000
That's the last time we've seen

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:51.000
A Dragon Quest game out here

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Now

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:53.000
I know this

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:54.000
But they've been remaking

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Dragon Quest games in Japan

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:56.000
There's actually two remakes

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:57.000
That have happened

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
A third is coming out as well

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
They have Dragon Quest Monsters

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
Wonderland 3D

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:04.000
And

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:05.000
What's the other one that they had?

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
They have Dragon Quest VII

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:08.000
That's right

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:09.000
Being remade for the 3DS

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Ooh

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Awesome

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:12.000
And then of course

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
There's Dragon Quest X

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:15.000
The MMO

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:16.000
Never happened here in the US

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:17.000
Right

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:18.000
But there's a lot of people

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:19.000
That want to see it happen

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Well

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:21.000
There was a tweet

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.000
On the Nintendo of America account

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
With hashtag Reginator

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Implying that it was from Reggie

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Fils-Aime himself saying

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:31.000
I'd love to see a new Dragon Quest game too

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
And so a lot of people are like

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Oh well if Reggie wants it

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:35.000
You know

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:36.000
He can make that happen

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:37.000
So

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:40.000
I don't know if he solely can make that happen

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:41.000
But

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
I'd be a fan of seeing some of these remakes

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Come out over here

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
I'm very curious about Dragon Quest X

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
I'm kind of sad that just didn't happen

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
So

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.000
Who knows

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.000
By the way

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:53.000
This is the stuff now

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
That Operation Rainfall and that whole group

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Has their eyes on

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Cause you know

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:58.000
They've got nothing left

02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:59.000
On their original 3

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:00.000
They all came out

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:01.000
They got their way

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
So now they're hoping to get this as well

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:04.000
So

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:05.000
Good luck

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Hope Nintendo listens to you guys

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:07.000
Cause I'd like to see it

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Well

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:09.000
Speaking of listening to you guys

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Every week you guys can email us

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.000
At mailbag

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
At orangeloungeradio.com

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:15.000
In Dark Soccer

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
She dives into the mailbag

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:18.000
And picks out an email or two

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.000
To read for you guys

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Here on the show

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Or if it's like last week

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:22.000
There'll be five emails

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Nah it's just one

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:24.000
And I had to use my radioactive gloves

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
To slip through the Mandarin text

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:27.000
So

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Yes we're still getting the spam

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Bleh

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:31.000
Alright so

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:32.000
What is

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:33.000
So we got one email tonight

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:34.000
One

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:35.000
Alright well what is it

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:36.000
With Twitter links

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:37.000
And I'm just gonna

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Go ahead and read this

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Hi O.L.R.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Enlightened Nintendo's recent closure of Swapnote

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
I'd like to bring to your attention

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Some funny as hell comments

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
Made by Sony Computer Entertainment

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Shuhei Yoshida

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:50.000
Enjoy

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:51.000
And the first one

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:52.000
Says

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Do you want me to read these

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Cause I know you're on your iPad

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Or

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Uh sure

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Okay

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Uh

02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:59.000
The first one is a reply

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.000
To somebody saying

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Oh

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Uh

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Okay

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Why

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:05.000
Yoshida says

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:06.000
Thanks for the feedback

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:07.000
To the lack of MP3

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:08.000
And DLNA support

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.000
At the launch of PS4

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
I'll share with the PS4 dev team

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:12.000
For future consideration

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
And somebody replied to that

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:15.000
I need to listen to porn

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Whilst playing Battlefield

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
And Yoshida replied to that

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:20.000
I know

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Yeah

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:25.000
And then there was another tweet

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Where

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:27.000
Uh

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:28.000
Somebody tweeted at him

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:29.000
Hey

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:30.000
I wanna know why my dick

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Got caught in my PlayStation 3's

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:33.000
Disc tray

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:34.000
When I tried to play

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Killzone Shadow Fall

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:36.000
On my PlayStation 3

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:37.000
It really hurts

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:38.000
And yes

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
I tried turning it on and off again

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Yoshida replied

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Shut up

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:43.000
Shut up

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
To which the original guy replied

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:48.000
K

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:50.000
That's cute

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Okay

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Also please pardon me for a brief

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
Orange Lounge foodie-o tangent

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
But do you guys have a Del Taco in the area?

02:12:58.000 --> 02:12:59.000
Yes, we have plenty of them

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:00.000
Yeah

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:01.000
They have some

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:02.000
There's literally one up the street

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:03.000
From OLR Studios

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:04.000
And

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:05.000
You better bet

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:06.000
I go there all the time

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:07.000
It's fantastic

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:08.000
They have some great chicken tacos

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
And this is true

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:11.000
Signed

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:12.000
The Nasty Canasta

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Oh

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:14.000
One of my favorite handles

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Yes

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:16.000
It always makes me think of like strip poker

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:17.000
But it's Nasty Canasta

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
It's the Nasty Canasta

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
Nasty Canasta does need a theme song huh

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Yeah

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
I need to um

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
It should be like um

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:29.000
It should be like

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:30.000
I don't know

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Like something set to a Burt Bacharach song

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Or something

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Well Nasty Canasta kind of makes me think

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:34.000
Like Copacabana

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:35.000
Yeah

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Which makes me think of like those

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:37.000
So I don't know

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:38.000
When I go

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Cause you know we love to use

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:40.000
I kind of think of this song

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
That's the Nasty Canasta song now

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
We're not sponsored by Del Taco

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
We're sponsored by Pinkberry

02:13:58.000 --> 02:13:59.000
I wish

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:00.000
I wish we had official sponsorship

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:01.000
I want sugar free Pinkberry

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:02.000
They had a new app come out this week

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:03.000
But I'm not going to plug it

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Because they don't sponsor us

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:06.000
Hey Pinkberry

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Free samples over here

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Alright

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:13.000
Even though I cannot partake of your deliciousness for a while

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:14.000
Okay

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:15.000
There you go

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:16.000
So that was our email

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:17.000
Mailbag at orangeontraded.com

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
You guys didn't make our soccer work very hard this week

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Act deft

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Why Del Taco and not of taco?

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:27.000
Cause you know Americans gotta be stupid

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:30.000
So

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:31.000
Alright uh

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
Mailbag at orangeontraded.com

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:34.000
And uh

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:35.000
You have a week

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
You have an extra week this week

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
And you had an extra hour last night

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:40.000
I'm going to sleep

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:41.000
To really fill up that mailbag

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:42.000
I'm going to sleep

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:43.000
What?

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:44.000
During the show next week?

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:45.000
Yeah

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:46.000
Oh

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Cause we're not having one

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:48.000
That's right

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:49.000
I'm going to sleep

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Alright

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
Let's get to the FUs of the week

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:53.000
Because before we can sleep

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
We have to get all the angst out of our system

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
So we'll do the FUs of the week

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:16.000
FU to my state of unemployment

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:17.000
Um

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:21.000
And not hearing back on the one I really wanted to hear back on at all

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:22.000
Um

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:23.000
Yeah

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:27.000
This is an FU to that

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
And also being sore from the gym

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:32.000
Cause I want to go back tomorrow

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:33.000
And uh

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:34.000
Yeah

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
And Tom Nook

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
Cause he's an ass

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
Loki?

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:41.000
Um

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:44.000
I guess after the fact I get to have my wisdom teeth out

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
So that's going to be fun

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Oh god that's right

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:48.000
Aren't you going to miss a show because of that?

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Or you don't know yet?

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
I hope your situation isn't like mine was

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:55.000
Cause you remember my wisdom teeth coming out don't you?

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Yeah

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:57.000
Where I had

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:58.000
Cause I got mine out when I was a teenager

02:15:58.000 --> 02:15:59.000
So it was no big deal

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:00.000
I've got pictures of it

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:03.000
Where I look like I've been in a prize fight for three months

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:04.000
Gross

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
I hope yours is better

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:07.000
Uh

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:10.000
My FU goes to the fact that I don't have tacos right now

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:11.000
And that really sucks

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:12.000
But

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:13.000
That was the best

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:14.000
That was

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
We were drinking at this party last night that we went to

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:19.000
Which by the way it was the meme party I talked about on the show before

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
And now I can tell you because

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:24.000
You know I'm not keeping a secret from any of the listeners anymore

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
I witnessed the what lady?

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Which you know that you know that that jpeg of the

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:29.000
What?

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
The really old lady that's missing her teeth or something

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
And just says W A T

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
So I went as the what lady to the party

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:36.000
And it got a great reaction

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
And I drank a lot

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Where were some of the other costumes there?

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:41.000
Uh

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:46.000
Alan and somebody else ended up as the ridiculously hot photogenic runner guy

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:49.000
So it was really funny that they duplicated the costume

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:50.000
That was really funny

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Uh

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:55.000
Slag Kick from Game Buoy was doing funeral selfies

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
He was doing selfies at funerals

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
So of course he walked over to me and took a picture of me

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
And put hashtag this bitch soon

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
By the way I have to tell you

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:07.000
A trick or treater did come to my door dressed as an internet meme

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:08.000
Oh yeah?

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
He was wearing one of the rage comic shirts

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Wearing a horse head

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:13.000
He was an internet meme

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Nice nice

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
Well and the other one I would say

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Captain Spike also from gamebuoy.org

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:21.000
Uh did the he wore this like grey hoodie

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:24.000
But he had it stuffed with pillows so he was round

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
And he had a little barbie doll swinging on a chain

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
He was the wrecking ball

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.000
Uh

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:30.000
Get it?

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:31.000
Get it?

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:32.000
I thought it was funny

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
And he kept saying all night like how comfortable he was

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Cause he had to build him pillows and I was laughing so

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
There you go

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Uh grandpa did not dress up

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:43.000
So we he said something really off

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
As grandpa tends to do if you've ever listened to Hoard House

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:49.000
He said something really unpolitically correct later on in the evening

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
So he said he was a YouTube commenter

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:52.000
So that's that

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:53.000
So anyway

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
Um I don't remember why I was telling that story

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:58.000
But oh yes because we got tacos last night

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
While I had been drinking

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:03.000
And I'll tell you what there is no better food

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
When you've been drinking than tacos

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Even though

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:07.000
Unless they come from Jack in the Box

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
Eff you to the fact that I'm too fat

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
And uh need to eat less tacos

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
You should try some of that vodka

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:18.000
I'm oh yeah I was supposed to have some of that at the start of part B huh

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:19.000
Mhmm

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
Well we'll see

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:22.000
Rab

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:23.000
Rab vodka

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Maybe maybe I'll do a shot for each call we get tonight

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:27.000
To try to entice

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Everyone call

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Nice

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:33.000
Do I have to mix it with anything or do I just take it as shots

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:36.000
It it's it's already mixed it's infused with juice

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Nice

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
Alright uh let's go to a couple more stories

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
And then we'll open up the phones and take some calls

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:42.000
At 1877 Game OLR

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:43.000
Uh Logie

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:47.000
So Sony has now announced a new Sony rewards uh plan

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Apparently it allows you to earn points for money that you spend on the Playstation store

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:57.000
So you earn for every dollar spent you earn one point

02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:03.000
And each of those points equals up to be about one penny versus you know towards something else

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:11.000
So for example if you want to get a brand new Playstation 3 game or Playstation 4 game for $59.99

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:16.000
It's gonna cost you $5,999

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:17.000
Um

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Granted there are other ways you can earn money um or points I should say in there

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:30.000
Not just with you know purchasing stuff but you can also I think they have um money spent on this

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:33.000
For every dollar you spend on the Sony store

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Every dollar you spend on the purchase or the uh Playstation store

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:45.000
Um when you upload your ticket stubs for Sony pictures, movies and also registered DVDs and Blu-ray discs

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Um they're also gonna have promotions through retail partners

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:51.000
Also if you you know sign up for offers you earn 100 points

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:55.000
Buy a PS3 bundle you earn up to 270 points

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:59.000
Um they said for movie tickets you earn up to 400 points

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:05.000
I'm not sure if that's per ticket or whatever but I mean right there that's a good way there

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:13.000
And um basically for every 1000 points you earn a $10 uh Playstation store code

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Um and then uh 250 points for uh buying the year of Playstation Plus

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:26.000
So yeah lots of ways to earn points and they have rewards including you know not just games and stuff

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:33.000
But you can also get Sony products and they have like other things, digital downloads, musics, you know movie tickets

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:36.000
VIP experiences they say

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.000
Oh yay

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
So you know prostitutes I guess

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
That's one I'm led to believe in

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Pole dances

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Good times

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:47.000
Hunting human beings you know that that kind of stuff

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Awesome

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:52.000
Alright uh hey this is a new story about a free game so listen up

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:57.000
Um this is a game that came out on the Super Nintendo in the mid 90s it's called Blackthorn

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:58.000
I don't know how many

02:20:58.000 --> 02:20:59.000
Oh god that game

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Do you remember this game?

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:01.000
Yes I do I have that game

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:04.000
What you may not remember about this game it was a blizzard game

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:05.000
Yes

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:06.000
Yes

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:10.000
The blizzard that makes Starcraft, Diablo, Warcraft they made a few other games in the heyday

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:11.000
Blackthorn

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:18.000
Oh yeah oh yeah so Blackthorn is one of them and um what's interesting is if you have a battle.net account

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:21.000
You can go get Blackthorn from Blizzard for free

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:24.000
That's it once you've downloaded the game it's yours to keep it's a free game

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:29.000
I'm gonna speculate here it's to try and get more people on their battle net downloader

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:33.000
Cause if they can give away you know this you know what they're not making any money off this anymore

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:34.000
You mean all that crap I uninstalled

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:39.000
Well but but if you were to go download the battle net downloader so you can get Blackthorn

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Then hey how easy is it to get a hearthstone on your computer when that comes out which is probably this week during Blizzcon

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:53.000
And how easy is it to get a Starcraft demo and a Diablo demo cause all that shit will automatically download if you don't tell it not to

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:58.000
So uh they know what they're doing with this they're just trying to get that battle net thing on more computers

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:04.000
But hey free game and for those of you that are already playing Warcraft and Diablo and all that stuff anyway

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:09.000
And you know shit you already have that stuff on your computer so why not add Blackthorn to that

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:12.000
So check that out at battle.net

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:20.000
Alright we are uh we're ready to open up the skype line at 1877 game OLR or username on skype orange lounge radio

And I do have my uh my bottle here of what is this vodka that you made

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:30.000
Jamie made this vodka she's making moonshine in her basement

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:37.000
Not the vodka itself the vodka is actually um actual potato vodka that I filtered myself

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:47.000
And it this one has I believe plum nectarine and um a couple of other fruits in it I don't remember I made it a while back so it's pretty potent

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:52.000
Nice alright so the skype line is open 1877 game OLR or username on skype orange lounge radio

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:59.000

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:04.000
You have to tell us something uh we've had a lot of topics tonight including the games of the generation and so forth

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:11.000
So there's plenty to discuss and uh I have my shot glass here I have a tall shot glass uh Alan collects shot glasses

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:14.000
And I just happened to grab this one it says Canada on it so I guess shout out

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
So it will be a polite shot

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:21.000
It will be it will be a very polite shot shout out to all our Canadian listeners up north

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:26.000
I know um I know one of the guys at least one of the guys from video game realness they're all Canadian over there in Toronto

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:33.000
I know at least one of them listens pretty regularly and uh Alan wait since you're walking by where's the shot glass from is this when you went to Toronto?

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
That's when you went to Toronto

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Alan went to Toronto once and we really really want to go well I've never been I've only been to Vancouver so I really want to go back to Toronto

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Oh wait I lied when I was 17 I went to Niagara Falls but you know that wasn't seeing very much of Canada

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:55.000
Cause I really want to go to Toronto so I know we've got listeners up there so these shots are for you guys if anybody calls

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
Oh no the phone line's not lighting up

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
Call let's have some new voices

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
We're talking about food

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:08.000
Are they talking about food?

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
We're talking about restaurant chains and where they are in the country

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:16.000
I noticed somebody said racks roast beef earlier I was like oh my god that's a blast from the past

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:20.000
You know what was a big blast for me that they don't have anymore was Kenny Rogers Roasters

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
That's a thing?

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:28.000
Yeah it's basically like Boston Market it's almost exactly the same so in Boston Market I was like oh that's neat

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:32.000
That is awesome alright we are starting to get some calls here so let's go to it

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
Hi you're on Orange Tons Radio who's this?

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
Hey this is Tech Q

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Hey Tech Q?

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:39.000
Yes

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:43.000
What is on your mind Tech Q? Oh wait first before I get to what's on your mind let me hold on

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
Oh god this bottle's hard to open hold on

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
Did everyone hear that?

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:52.000
Will you talk to Tech Q for me while I pour a shot here?

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:57.000
Rob is pouring himself some pink liquor so what do you have to talk about tonight?

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:04.000
I wanted to comment about the news of this generation that you did earlier

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Y'all forgot to mention the red ring 360

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
Yeah there was the red ring

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:14.000
Oh yeah the 360 red ring

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:22.000
Why do you, I mean obviously I can answer this too but why do you feel this was a defining moment of the generation?

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:39.000
I think it affected like 90% of all 360s that were sold up to a point until they finally admitted that they shot the hardware that they sold

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:51.000
What do you think Microsoft's learned from this going into the next generation? Do you trust that the Xbox One's not going to have these similar types of problems or what?

02:25:51.000 --> 02:26:01.000
I would hope they would, they wouldn't get my money if I were going to get Xbone

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:06.000
What are your thoughts on the upcoming generation? I know we had the Fugu question of the week earlier

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:10.000
Are you jumping in on any of these new consoles? Are you taking a wait and see approach or what?

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Since I traded in my 360 why not get a PS4 cheap

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:20.000
But that is interesting that you traded in the Microsoft console to get the Sony console

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:24.000
What weighed in on that decision? Was that just about price or what?

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:40.000
It's basically before they did the 180 mantra back in July I was just disgusted with them on their policy especially on that used game DRM crap that they tried to pull

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:46.000
So it was probably one of those things where by the time they reversed course it was too late you'd pre-ordered your PS4 right?

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:47.000
Yeah

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Yeah makes sense

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Alright well TechQ anything else you want to share with us tonight?

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:53.000
Don't get too drunk

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
Alright I'll try I will drink responsibly

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:58.000
This is Rob of course he will no I'm kidding

02:26:58.000 --> 02:26:59.000
Alright take care buddy thanks for calling

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:00.000
Thanks

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:01.000
Alright bye

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Bye bye

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:07.000
Yes the liquor is good and what you didn't, during that call Alan came in here and took a shot as well and he approved too

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:14.000
What shot glass did he use? Oh how appropriate he used the Hard Rock Atlanta shot glass that I brought him from this year's DragonCon

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:15.000
How appropriate

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:19.000
So yeah I don't remember what else I put in I think it had mango too

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:25.000
It has yumminess in it I'll tell you that but we've got surprise surprise now we're getting tons of calls we got another call coming in

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
Hi you're on Orange Lawn's radio who's this?

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:30.000
This is Ron and I am going to do a shot with you

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:34.000
Buck yes alright Dark Soccer's my bartender right now she's pouring me a shot

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:40.000
She's such a good friend she not only makes me the liquor but then she pours it out for me that's a true friend right there

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:43.000
Yes yes indeed and I have my whipped cream vodka right here

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:47.000
When I'm old and in a wheelchair she'll be switching out my IV bag with liquor

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Alright

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:49.000
Heck yeah

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
Here we go I got the shot you ready buddy?

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:54.000
Shit I just took a shot let me do another one okay whatever you're ready

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
Alright let me know when you're ready

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:57.000
Ready

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:58.000
1, 2, 3

02:27:58.000 --> 02:27:59.000
3

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:01.000
Down and 1

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Does it burn nicely?

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:05.000
That's good

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:06.000
I like to drop you a glass

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:07.000
Oh that you can't have that

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:08.000
My bad

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Alright now that that's taken care of what's on your mind buddy?

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:17.000
I'm just amused by the whole PlayStation FAQ it just amuses the living shit out of me

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:25.000
It's like when the next when the prior gen came in it was like it can play video games it can do this this and that and I'm like

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
Can it play Street Fighter?

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:28.000
Yes but it can also do this

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
Can it play Street Fighter?

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:31.000
Yes it can play Street Fighter

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:32.000
Thank you

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:35.000
PlayStation 4 it can only play Street Fighter

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
But I want to do all of this

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
But you can only play Street Fighter

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:40.000
But I want to do this

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:44.000
Well you should have kept your prior gen console now shouldn't you?

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:47.000
That sounds too much like a Microsoft line

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:55.000
See that's the funny part it's like when Microsoft came out the gate running their mouth with everything that they're going to do

02:28:55.000 --> 02:29:01.000
Everyone had their guns ready they were going to Microsoft castle and just hang Dracula

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:06.000
And Sony's like they're like Gendo they're like we're just gonna wait this out

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:13.000
Now they're waiting it out and Sony's like we're gonna do a little bit of this we're gonna do a little bit of that we're gonna do a little bit of this

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:19.000
And the people like wait a minute this is what Microsoft's were doing but it's Sony so it's okay

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Well that and Sony was a little bit smarter about how they delivered the bad news to be honest

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:28.000
They really waited until the last minute and just kind of snuck it in under the radar

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:35.000
And to be real all of these features while they're disappointing at the end of the day they don't really ruin the gaming experience

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:43.000
And you know one place where people really razzed the shit out of Microsoft was that they were talking about TV and all this other stuff that wasn't games

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:53.000
At that original Xbox reveal and Sony is basically now saying like yeah we're games and not a lot else at this point with the removal of some of these media things

02:29:53.000 --> 02:30:01.000
So it's very interesting like Sony is still delivering on the games part of it and Microsoft's getting there too with their policy adjustments and so forth

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:08.000
Yeah true true I can't hate on them for that but I'm amused where they say no DLNA

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:15.000
My train of thought is well you know what if I can't watch my anime on the PlayStation 4 I'll just fire up my PlayStation 3

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:23.000
I kind of feel like that's one of the first things you're gonna see get reversed I really think they're listening and I think they're gonna come back and be like

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:29.000
Whoa we didn't realize people were was like gonna make a big deal out of this and miss this so I kind of suspect you're gonna see it

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:36.000
I believe it I believe it it's just a little bit of time which is why I am not running out in the next 12 days to buy one

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:44.000
And that's also part of the reason I mean not just the video it's just the expense and everything and the whole fact that you know the games are disappearing that I was gonna pick up

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:53.000
Well from the trailer I mean when the promo for the console I'm not really a first person shooter type of guy

02:30:53.000 --> 02:31:01.000
If I play those I'm playing it for the story which is why I like Battlefield 3 the hell with the multiplayer I like the story mode from start to finish

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Interesting I don't usually hear people talk about the story in that game

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:10.000
That's how I am cause if I'm gonna do multiplayer it's gonna be with you and whoever else we're gonna be running our mouths like dumbasses but you know

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:11.000
Yeah of course

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:20.000
There's only one game on the PS4 that I want it's The Order it's a first person shooter that's full steampunk that's it

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
That was like fun

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:31.000
Yeah and I can that's not coming until like 2014 I can wait same thing with the Wii U Bayonetta 2 and Mario Kart 8 I can wait

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
X1 still waiting

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:39.000
Mario 3D World though that's starting to up the urgency a little bit you gotta admit a little bit

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Not with me cause as G of Day I can tell you I'm more of a Mario Kart hoard than anything else

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:54.000
You know what that's totally fair totally fair I wish Nintendo would announce an F-Zero but as somebody said in chat earlier with all the upside downness of Mario Kart 8

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:59.000
Mario Kart is starting to take F-Zero's features I kinda think that says what we need to know about F-Zero

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:07.000
Yes and no but I'll tell you this now F-Zero on 3DS would be sick because we've played F-Zero

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:17.000
The game plays a lot faster than Mario Kart it's a lot faster speed it's tighter controls I mean like I said I have the XL

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
And there's no fucking blue shells

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:28.000
Exactly I mean all the 3DS games I play on my XL now they feel a lot more surreal a lot more in depth I have a lot more fun playing them

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:34.000
So F-Zero on that Mario Kart on it I'm sold I'm like yes

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:39.000
Alright well I don't know about you Rama I'm starting to feel this liquor a little bit feels good

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:49.000
Not me man and I shouldn't even be taking another shot cause I gotta get up at 630 for work and I have like a near 90 minute commute to work now so

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:52.000
You have a way better tolerance than I that's all I can say

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:56.000
I will send you some of my liver powers

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:05.000
Well my liver powers have been adhered through Patty cause she's heavy handed when she pours so Rob when you come out here to the east coast

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:10.000
You'll spend a week with her when you come back you'll have an iron liver

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:19.000
I really am hoping to get back out to New York in 2014 it is one of the goals if for nothing else than to see NPH and Hedvig that's gotta happen

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:22.000
If worst case scenario it's a box

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:23.000
As who?

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:24.000
Hedvig

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:25.000
Willy

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:27.000
Yeah I know right?

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:28.000
Alright

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
I want to send two boxes now huh?

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:33.000

Speaking of the New York orange lounge radio listeners I know this guy hasn't listened for a while but I just saw this in chat

02:33:54.000 --> 02:34:01.000
SJ100Matt said this in chat and I was like no way really apparently Sephiroth1215 won one of the Playstation 4's through Taco Bell

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:18.000
Skyplines lighting up pretty soon I'm not even gonna be able to click on the answer button

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Hi orange lounge radio who's this?

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
Hey this is act deaf

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:27.000
Hey act deaf hold on we'll get to your call in a minute but there's something I gotta do first

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:34.000
Yeah we have a name for that when you drink a shot it's called Idago

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:38.000
When you take a shot of all the glass so yeah do it

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
What does it mean Idago?

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:50.000
Idago it's a name it's actually the name of one of the founding fathers of the nation

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:51.000
So Idago

02:34:51.000 --> 02:35:01.000
I don't know where the name comes from for taking a shot but it's something I've heard throughout the years

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:06.000
You know what fair enough I gave a shout out to the Canadians earlier so this one goes out to my Mexicans down below here we go

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:09.000
And I did put the stuff in a petrol bottle

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
There you go act deaf

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:15.000
So maybe does it count that I put it in a petrol bottle?

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Perhaps alright what's on your mind buddy I took the shot what's up

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:25.000
Well I wanted to talk about the influential game of the generation or most influential

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:30.000
Yeah what do you believe is the most influential game of the generation?

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:31.000
Portal

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:37.000
Portal oh yeah you mentioned this in chat earlier and Jamie somewhat agreed with you is her number two pick

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
Why did you pick Portal?

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:50.000
Basically well Portal didn't do anything that well how to say that special or that original

02:35:50.000 --> 02:36:00.000
Besides the portals or the physics in the game that's something that we have we already seen in other games especially like Half Life and stuff like that

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:13.000
But it was influential because of the storytelling basically it's most of the games after Portal try to imitate something in the storytelling in them

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:23.000
Like games at least in a more serious and more detailed well not detailed sorry I'm trying to gather my words

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:30.000
That's alright was that because of GLaDOS you think? Like everybody loves that character

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:45.000
Yeah part of that and part of Shell being mute it's basically like playing Zelda or playing Mario where the main characters are mute

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:55.000
But since this is a first person game so basically they're talking to you so it's a more personal maybe

02:36:55.000 --> 02:37:11.000
And all the experience around it because it's like especially because of that it's a first person it's a more personal experience all around

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:23.000
You're the one doing the stuff all the stuff happens to you directly so it's a lot of games after Portal have kind of imitated that

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:36.000
So it's not maybe in a first person perspective but more in what happens in the decisions that you make or the other stuff that you do in the game

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:39.000
Well basically it's you

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:49.000
You know what also was great about first person shooter I'm starting to slur a little bit about Portal you know what was great about Portal besides just what you're talking about like the immersion and all that

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:55.000
The thing that was great about Portal is that it was a first person shooter game for people that hate first person shooters

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
Yeah basically

02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:08.000
I mean really like everybody I know that like hates first person shooters still loves Portal because it's more of like it's more a puzzle obviously but it's yet it is that first person

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:22.000
And especially that because I got the orange box on the 360 basically for Portal I didn't finish even the Half Life 2 and didn't even start episode 1 and 2

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:34.000
I played Team Fortress and I still play it that's a game I enjoy but basically I got the orange box because of Portal and I played a hell a lot of it

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
There's a lot of people that do that

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:48.000
I have three different copies of it two on the Xbox I got the orange box and still alive and then I got the copy on Steam so I love that game a lot

02:38:49.000 --> 02:39:03.000
Like you said it's an immersive game it's totally immersive and like I said a lot of games have tried to replicate that immersion and a few have succeeded in it

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:18.000
Not all of them but it's basically the legacy that Portal has handed down to gaming and I think it's a pretty important thing too in this generation and probably the next

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:22.000
And very important with Portal and Jonathan Coulton

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
Oh yeah

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:29.000
Alright well Act F I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show but thank you so much for your call buddy

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Thank you

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:31.000
Alright take care

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:33.000
Bye

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:48.000
Alright that does it for calls tonight oh I know more you wanted to call in to get me to take more shots but you guys it's a school night I got to work tomorrow and I'm already feeling a little bit tipsy so I asked the bartender to call me off

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
To call it off close it down shut it down

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:51.000
Cut you off

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:52.000

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
You are a good friend

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
I would help you hide bodies

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
You are what would you hold my head over the toilet

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
I'd hold your hair back if you had enough

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
Hey

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
I'm not talking I'm talking about long hair

Rob

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:13.000
You know I have a complex about that and I'm just kidding I don't but it's funny

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
So I learned something today

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:16.000
Okay what

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
A barcode hair

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:23.000
Nah I don't like that look at all

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:26.000
Yeah it's kind of bad but I still thought that was a funny name

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:29.000
There is nothing wrong with rocking the bald look as far as I'm concerned

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:30.000
You know what

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:31.000
Are you gonna shave it all off

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:32.000
No

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
See I think it's distinguished

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:35.000
I'm gonna rock what God gave me

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:38.000

I'm a little scatterbrained right now because I just had three shots in a very short amount of time

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
And I have no alcohol tolerance to begin with

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:06.000
Um I want to thank all you guys for listening to the show

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:10.000
And uh encourage you to keep spreading the word about Orange Orange Radio

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:14.000
We appreciate all the feedback and all the good good stuff you guys leave out there for us

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:18.000
Sorry we won't be here next week but you know what once in a while we're gonna take a week off it happens

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:24.000
Um if you are gonna be at Blizzcon I'm unfortunately not going to the convention itself

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
Which I talked about why on a previous episode of the show

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:30.000
But I will be at the World of Podcasts event that's Thursday night

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:34.000
Um I will be there as will grandpa from Horde House so come find us and say hello

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:39.000
I swear we are very open and like don't be shy we're really friendly

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:44.000
And we'll probably be at the bar so I'll probably be a little out of it like I am right now and that makes me extra friendly

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:49.000
So come see us at World of Podcasts otherwise you'll have to catch me at Blizzcon the next day

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
Uh so for those of you that are going to Blizzcon

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:55.000
For the rest of you we'll see you in two weeks back here on November 17th

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:59.000
When we will be living in a world with the Playstation 4 and soon the Xbox One

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:00.000
Yes

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:03.000
A new era of gaming a new era of Orange Orange Radio in a way

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:07.000
Even though none of us are gonna get it but I imagine we'll all be playing somebody else's at least

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
You know what we need to do?

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
We need to have a PS4 QQ party

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:14.000
That would be fun and we'll just play Playstation 1 games all night

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
Jumping Flash Marathon

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
I thought of Jumping Flash 2

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:19.000
Oh my god

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:20.000
This is why we're friends

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:24.000
You have to play Playstation 1 games on your PS3 because it's 1 plus 3 and there you go 4

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:28.000
I like the way you think even though it's kinda ridiculous but that's why we keep you around

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:31.000
I still have to get a battery for the Saturn

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:34.000
I've been telling Dan to bring one home from work and he hasn't

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
Alright we're gonna wrap up the show

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:40.000
Um thank you guys very much I guess we gotta go around and get everybody's final thoughts

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:45.000
I feel like I'm forgetting something at the end of the show but it's just because things are spinning a little bit right now

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:48.000
So uh Loki your final thought tonight

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:54.000
I wonder if the memory card adapter for the Playstation 3 that they had at launch or whatever works with the PocketStation

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:57.000
Wait did you have last minute stories? I forgot to ask you

02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:00.000
No like I have last minute stories

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
Who does last minute stories anymore?

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:03.000
Alright uh

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:04.000
It's November

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
Dark Soccer your final thought tonight

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:10.000
Uh words

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:13.000
My final thought tonight is Disneyland

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:14.000
I missed you

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:15.000
Duffy

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
Yes and Duffy

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
And Dark Soccer gets to babysit

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
Cause she's my friend you're a good friend

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:22.000
Yeah we need to work out the details

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
You get me drunk and then you babysit my cat

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:25.000
Alright

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
Have a good week everybody

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:28.000
Enjoy the week off

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
We will be back in 2 weeks

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:35.000
So during the week off we really encourage you check out other great independent podcasts

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:41.000
Because there's a lot of great stuff out there and uh you know without the 3 hours you have with us next week

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:47.000
That's at least 3 1 hour shows you could be listening to from some other hard working independent podcasters

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
So please keep supporting independent podcasting

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:53.000
Thank you guys very much for tuning into our show and have a wonderful night

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:56.000
We will see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:59.000
And I have to buy myself more time while I look for the outro

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
I can't even find the outro on this list

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:02.000
Where is it?

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
Is it gone? There it is

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
Alright let's try that again

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
Have a great week everybody

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:11.000
We'll see you in 2 weeks here on Orange Lounge Radio

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:12.000
Jason take us out

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:40.000
