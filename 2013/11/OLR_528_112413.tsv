14198	17460	Hot on the heels of the PlayStation 4, Microsoft releases the Xbox One Million.
17660	19561	No, Xbox releases the Microsoft One.
19721	21842	I mean, millionaires buy one Xbox.
22462	23043	You know what I mean.
23303	24463	And if you don't, just stay tuned.
24603	27185	This, Nintendo, and all your comments begin right now.
31854	36797	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36857	43741	It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 528 for this November the 24th of 2013.
45802	53506	You're here and we're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and it's me, Rob Roberts, and my co-hosts,
53946	56529	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
70104	73346	I'm back playing cookie clicker again, I guess.
73606	74987	I thought you swore that off last week.
75007	77108	I did, but then I realized you can prestige in it.
77329	82292	So you get, you know, I guess you get some, like, heavenly chips or some bullshit.
82312	83792	You got sucked right back in.
84413	86334	It's just because I have nothing better to do right now.
86414	87515	Are you an achievement whore?
87535	87995	Is that what this is?
88055	88816	Thanks for watching!
107671	113354	Alright, joining us here tonight, helping to fill in for hosts since we are down DarkSakura tonight.
113974	115715	You guys should be familiar with this guy by now.
115875	117295	After all, he is the voice of the show.
117415	118776	Say hello to Jason!
118976	121797	I may not be the happiest bunny on the farm, but I certainly am the gassiest.
122478	123698	Ew.
125459	126700	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
149990	152932	So, but now it's everywhere, so we don't really do that anymore.
153232	154933	But how are you, Gassy Bunny?
155253	157574	I am... You better watch out or you'll get that nickname.
157835	158395	Yeah, probably.
159115	159496	How are you?
159856	161437	I'm quite exhausted.
161677	162337	Yeah?
162857	170181	It's been a surprisingly non-gamey, but still kind of gamey, but also lots of movement in the literal sense this week.
170402	170602	Yeah?
170902	171042	Yeah.
171162	173023	Oh yeah, you've been traveling around everywhere, right?
173143	174264	Lots of travel, yeah.
174744	177527	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
195965	197387	Are we allowed to say where you work on air?
197587	199470	I'm pretty sure I've said it once or twice.
199530	201513	It's a pretty cool company a lot of people have heard of, I'm sure.
202173	207601	I work for GitHub down there in San Francisco, which is my excuse for coming into town constantly.
207861	210164	And it doesn't hurt that it's on their dime.
210304	213048	So, you know, why not come out to Sacramento too?
213208	214029	We don't mind at all.
214129	214610	We don't mind at all.
229447	239117	And even if things aren't open source and you're doing the active development in private, GitHub still applies because it's the entire suite of collaboration.
239758	248147	And even people that are not developers, issues managers, people that just need to go in for reviews and need to be a part of the process, it's all applicable to them as well.
248927	250348	Open source, public, private, whatever.
251189	251609	It all works out.
251669	253770	It is the act of development and collaboration.
253830	257793	Sometimes I do learn things from reading source code, even though I don't totally understand it.
257973	262656	At work, there's a lot of Visual Basic tied into Microsoft Office, like macros and things like that.
262716	265397	We actually did talk about this before, and you made that exact point.
265777	273262	Any macros or anything Visual Basic-based could... Well, you know, after 520 episodes, some topics repeat themselves once in a while.
273302	274743	100 episodes ago, you know...
276685	282189	Well, okay, I don't know if I've talked about this, but I will use this as an opportunity to give a cheap plug to my YouTube channel.
282390	283871	Because I've been using that more and more, right?
283971	286373	My Rob Roberts plays and do my Let's Remember videos.
286713	289095	One of the games I did this week, Dragonfire on the Atari 2600.
289335	290075	Did you ever play this game?
290276	290736	I did not.
290756	292377	We run across the bridge, run through the treasure room.
292397	293278	Practically all of the Atari.
293698	294559	You're probably too young.
295920	301787	The reason why I bring that game up specifically is that the guy actually released the source code.
301907	304930	You can go to AtariAge.com and check out the source code for Dragonfire.
305571	308273	I find those Atari 2600 source codes amazing.
308614	314320	I don't understand it whatsoever, but the cool thing about Dragonfire in particular is that it's all commented.
314600	318763	Like here is the code that shows the sprite for the chalice, you know, something like that.
319063	330489	And so you can actually kind of see like, wow, this is like when they have to cram all this crap into 4K, 4 kilobytes or 8 kilobytes were like the average Atari 2600 size if you think about it.
330509	332631	4 kilobytes, that's nothing.
333294	337716	We have a... I write Word documents that are like 200 kilobytes easy.
338076	338416	Easy!
338636	343138	That's because there's more background data in a Word document that there is actual text that you type into it.
343258	343578	True.
343799	346700	But there is a similar feat, as a matter of fact, for the classic game of the week.
347400	352782	A similar feat of how in the hell did they do this back in the day with such restricted file sizes and everything else.
353663	353803	So...
354483	355044	Well, very cool.
355084	358610	Sorry, we digressed a little bit there, but I find the source code stuff really fascinating.
358950	361154	I also want to introduce our chat room, of course.
361214	362956	We always have our live chatters with us.
363197	369387	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network.
369847	396889	VOG Network.com and you can join us if you are listening live in our chat room live.vognetwork.com our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf in fact starts us off tonight because I love this comment here he says the source code to Pac-Man on Atari 2600 is a piece of art even though everyone considers it a terrible game to play well yes Pac-Man on the Atari 2600 was really garbage but if you think about the time constraints the guy had to work with it's really astonishing
397549	399550	You know, like, yeah, it does some weird shit.
399570	403193	Like, the fact that the ghost can only draw one, like, it has to cycle.
403433	404414	That's why the ghosts blink.
404694	407796	Because it can't, like, the Atari 2600 literally cannot draw all of them at once.
408157	411399	So it draws these two in one frame, these two in, or maybe one each frame.
411419	412179	I don't remember what it does.
412500	414961	But it's crazy shit to get it to work.
414981	416282	And he had to do it in mere months.
416723	420445	And that's what fucked up a lot of those Atari 2600 games, is that they had no time.
421166	422347	E.T., same story.
422367	422807	Yeah.
423347	426169	Well, there were maybe some other decisions along with E.T.
426289	433954	as well, but not to digress yet again on another detailed... I could talk about old shit all day long.
434094	439778	And considering that I have not bought the Xbox One or the PlayStation 4 yet, I'd prefer to focus on the old stuff.
439998	451795	It was the 7th guest and the 11th hour that are in a really similar state that because they were made in that Windows 95, DOS, transitional kind of world where the modern... What are the words that I'm even looking for?
452556	456061	The modern conveniences in libraries and DirectX didn't exist yet.
456562	479021	and in order to be widely compatible with all the hardware that was blossoming in the Windows era the developer had to do these really, really, really nasty low-level assembly tricks to just eke out that last bit of performance for all of the visuals and the smooth video and everything that that game employed alongside Myst and Riven as well just to take something that is
480931	484272	Still images with depth and the transitions and everything else.
485273	489414	Yeah, human ingenuity and what computers have done for the last decade is unreal.
489574	493816	Well, you know, there is a way to kind of tie all this talk into what's going on with the new consoles.
493836	498738	Because we were listening to Bobby's show here in studio and just the general talk as well out there on the internet.
499058	507601	I know one of the topics that came up on Bobby's show tonight was the fact that some of the launch games that you have right now kind of look like they could be done on current consoles.
507901	508502	Dead Rising 3 Dead Rising 3
531202	538243	People have the expectation, because last gen, well, even before last gen began, or this gen, I'm getting confused which gen we're on now.
540504	546665	This gen, I guess, they were talking about, oh, yeah, 1080p, it's going to be 60 frames per second.
547145	550606	And then the next gen, okay, that's how we're going to differentiate ourselves.
550646	553546	It's going to be higher resolutions, better frame rates, and stuff like that.
553866	558127	And then you have Dead Rising 3 come out, that 720p running at 30 frames per second.
558807	563352	and it chugs and there's like long ass load screens.
563712	565694	It's like, dude, what the hell?
565854	571019	I mean, you could have done this shit on an Xbox 360 and had the same kind of results.
571359	576444	I mean, why are there games out now that have higher frame rates, look better and you can't pull this shit off on next gen?
576644	580827	Well, because, and to tie it into what Jason was just talking about, it's learning the tricks.
581147	586071	And I think there's still a lot of tricks that the developers are going to have to learn with these consoles.
586211	591455	And we'll see it in about a year where these games start to look better and better.
592156	594858	You even see it with the current-gen stuff.
595738	598320	What's a really good-looking game that came out in the past year?
599061	601783	Something like Tomb Raider, let's say, looks fantastic.
602062	602803	Thanks for watching!
622606	636751	I am still bugged at the fact that, you know, and this I guess is even the same situation with, you know, the Xbox 360 when it launched that they want people to spend money on these systems and they haven't really shown what's different about these systems.
637152	641913	Okay, cool, so the Xbox One can display more zombies on screen, but the game still runs like shit.
642194	651157	I mean, you know, why don't you, I don't know, instead of pumping out a thousand zombies on the screen, maybe do 500 and then the frame rate's better.
651457	652398	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
674491	674811	I don't know.
674972	679658	I mean, I never had a problem with there being too few zombies in Dead Rising games, to be honest.
679718	683582	So, I don't really know why it's an issue.
683743	684864	Are you being a little harsh?
684884	687888	Because DKB in the chatroom says, Runs like shit, really?
688168	688989	And even I have to go.
689169	689470	Okay.
689770	691773	Real... Isn't that a little harsh?
691933	693134	It's 30 frames per second.
694216	698000	30 frames per second, you know, with... Once again, I have an expectation.
698020	706211	If they want me to spend $500 on a new console, then I better see some... I better see a fucking difference between this gen and next gen.
706591	708532	I want to see... They have to wow me.
708552	709513	They have to sell it to me.
710093	718357	And honestly, if they're showing me a game that looks like Dead Rising 2, but, oh, the map's slightly bigger this time, and, oh, there's some more zombies, I don't fucking care.
718397	719518	I'm not buying that system.
719578	731624	To be fair, and to be devil's advocate a little bit here, didn't we kind of know that going into this round of consoles that they weren't going to be pushing the graphical envelope and all this as much because there's not a lot more you can do.
732404	733485	with the current TVs.
733565	737188	Intel 4K TVs are the standard, which we don't even know if that will be.
737508	740671	You know, there's not a lot else to do visually.
740971	752141	When we were talking PlayStation 2 to PlayStation 3, the entire world was in the process, well, at least this country and probably most of the rest of the world, was transitioning between SDTV and HDTV.
752181	753362	I mean, that was a huge jump.
753542	767191	Okay, I understand that, but we've had a whole generation of games that have been running at 720p and now with hardware that's definitely a lot better than this current generation systems, and they can't fucking pull out 1080p native?
768251	769052	I mean, and...
769652	790606	and a decent frame rate I mean shit Rise runs at 30 frames per second if you're lucky it's locked in there or they even did dumbass shit with Need for Speed Rivals where even on PC it's fucking locked at 30 frames per second you try to unlock it and the game goes crazy because it's just the way they did their physics or something in the game it's just all messed up
791306	797408	That's my problem though, is that they are... Once again, there's no... And I think this is going to be a problem with these consoles.
797548	798209	There's no hook.
798549	799889	There's no hook to get me in there.
800170	804371	Whereas with the Wii, it took off because it was a new way to play games.
805732	806692	Microsoft's trying to sell it.
806732	808093	Hey, Kinect is important.
809273	811435	But it doesn't really do a whole ton.
812035	818560	Once again, it's like these fucking promises that they made when Kinect originally came out and we're seeing the same shit not quite work right again.
819261	821442	And it's like, well, we're going to patch it.
821462	822243	It's going to get better.
822583	825745	No, it didn't fucking get better with the original Kinect.
826006	827287	And same with Smart Glass stuff.
827327	830309	I haven't seen how they've really implemented these second screen things other than
830609	831349	Thanks for watching!
848136	855618	I'm trying to figure out where your head's at right now with these new consoles because you're coming off to me right now more negative than I kind of thought you were at.
855978	869321	I kind of thought you were in a similar place that I was at where, okay, you might not be on board with Xbox One and PlayStation 4 right now because the games aren't really there to substantiate the several hundred dollars purchase, but I kind of thought you'd be jumping on board a year or two from now.
869461	870021	Am I wrong?
870041	870121	Yeah.
871201	876228	I mean, maybe if there's some better games come out that actually show off the hardware.
877049	882636	But right now, there's not really anything coming out that's going to be like that.
882696	885018	I mean, it just all seems like promises right now.
885319	888062	That we're getting a lot of promised things and...
890169	890670	That's it.
890790	891530	It just promises.
891590	893072	I mean, even like, look at these launches.
893232	894153	It's pathetic.
894473	898316	The amount of features that aren't in there that are going to be patched in later on.
898776	900078	It just screams rushed.
900318	901719	The whole thing screams rushed.
901779	905882	It really, these consoles should have come out six months from now and not now.
907644	909626	I don't know why bother rushing everything.
910286	913209	I guess because you have to react to the other, you know...
913709	914870	Well, the holidays too.
915311	915691	So what?
915991	916532	It doesn't matter.
916572	917553	The holidays don't matter.
918494	921577	Hold on now.
921677	924480	No, the holidays don't matter as far as selling these consoles.
924520	929726	You'll sell a million consoles regardless of the... Are these people really saving them for the holidays?
929826	934551	I mean, maybe a small percentage of them, but put it out six months from now and people would still be buying them.
935231	937293	Oh, fiscal year performance is important too.
937673	945718	And you and I both know you're going to sell more consoles, way more consoles between October and December than you're going to sell between January and March, which is the end of the fiscal year.
946159	950602	So, I mean, in that sense, it's logical, right?
951132	951873	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
968693	984341	I'm not picking one up anytime soon because there's no games on there that I'm really interested in and so far everything they've shown they haven't really changed anything it's all the same shit that they're pulling right now on the current gen consoles and to be honest there's more games coming out in current gen anyways
985482	993648	I want to see some significant differences between Assassin's Creed 4 on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3.
994468	1001973	Hell, even when Titanfall comes out, I kind of want to see what they're going to do as far as the Xbox 360 version.
1001993	1005715	Let's see how different that is compared to the Xbox One version.
1006636	1011442	I just, I need to see what these vast differences are in order for me to, you know, justify me in purchasing.
1011462	1017410	Because, to be honest, I mean, might as well just dump that $500 into a PC because at least those games are going to be running at a higher resolution than 720p.
1019531	1027954	Alright, I don't know, I think you might be being a little too harsh, but I also understand the frustrations, you know, I get it.
1027994	1031895	Alright, live.vognetwork.com, it is the show where every gamer has a voice.
1032435	1038717	Bobby Blackwolf, wanting to challenge you on one of these points here, saying they rush it because gamers don't want to wait.
1039078	1041678	How much did you complain when Grand Theft Auto V was delayed?
1042519	1043139	It was worth it.
1045157	1045817	It was worth it.
1046237	1047718	And let me be honest.
1047838	1049018	Let me be honest with Grand Theft Auto 5.
1049558	1053419	Grand Theft Auto 5 has a lot more content than some of these other fucking next-gen games.
1053739	1057720	I would be a horrible, irresponsible person if I did not ask this question.
1057980	1063782	Could you be sitting here a year from now going, it was worth it for Xbox One?
1065345	1067826	when that Grand Theft Auto 6 or whatever happens.
1067846	1072629	I can't predict the future, and it's going to be Grand Theft Auto 5 again on next year is what it's going to be.
1073289	1075350	No, I can't predict the future.
1075430	1080153	I mean, I would like for them, I'd like to be wrong on these consoles.
1080193	1091078	I mean, honestly, I would, but as we're going to get into later on, there's some things that we've complained about, like, dude, it's a fucking $60 game, and you're treating it like a free-to-play game.
1092179	1093140	And shit's not going away.
1093160	1094001	It's only getting worse.
1094382	1104814	And so why should I buy into these brand new consoles if they're just going to turn them into some sort of sieve for me to just basically take more money from me?
1106476	1108459	They need to have something to really sell me on it.
1108479	1111002	Like, Kinect 2.0 was supposed to be so...
1112363	1134450	integral to you know the Xbox experience and aside from voice commands and shit for I don't really fucking care about voice commands okay yeah that's cool and all but um I hear I mean I don't know again there's a lot of mixed opinions out there but I'm hearing that people really are enjoying the interface once they finally get down there in there and use it that the whole like you know screen and screen stuff and and all that kind of kind of works pretty good
1135891	1154591	I still don't... For me, the screen and screen stuff, once again, you're telling me that it's important for me to have a tablet so I can do the second screen stuff, so why do I need a little tiny sliver of my screen when I can do the same shit on my tablet that's right in front of me because you're having me use this tablet to play the games as well.
1155051	1156272	Except for Grand Theft Auto 5.
1179265	1181548	Well, eventually.
1181628	1182309	It's coming.
1182329	1185632	They already have PC documentation inside.
1185712	1185932	All right.
1186213	1188035	We got into a kickoff topic anyway.
1188295	1190798	I originally wanted to talk about the Xbox One's launch.
1191158	1192660	I wanted to talk about those sales figures.
1192720	1195583	I don't know, Loki, do you want to kind of go over the sales figures?
1195623	1197785	Because, as Bobby said, they're trying to make some money.
1198065	1199507	Sounds like they did after all, right, Loki?
1199747	1200688	Yeah, they did pretty well.
1202470	1210977	Both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One sold a million units, or they're phrasing it as over a million units.
1212459	1217644	I'm trying not to sound biased here, but I really fucking hate PR speak.
1218084	1223849	I got down on Activision about Call of Duty and their one million units ship bullshit and stuff.
1224810	1231474	Yes, they sold a million units worldwide versus one million units North America for the PlayStation 4.
1232175	1232935	But hey, you know what?
1233315	1234536	No one's knocking a million units.
1234556	1239719	A million units of a console within 24 hours is fantastic.
1240019	1241360	Sorry, I have to say this.
1241500	1242181	I'm sorry, Loki.
1242221	1243021	It's kind of interrupting.
1243061	1246703	But Tech2030 in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Fuck this.
1247044	1249445	Let's just not buy any of them and only play Cookie Clicker.
1249585	1250265	And 66% of the room is...
1252827	1253490	I'm multitasking.
1258092	1262415	Hey, and I have my phone off, Jason, because mine will produce cookies while it's not on.
1262475	1263055	Alright, anyway.
1263716	1264536	All joking aside.
1265637	1267298	So, one million on both consoles.
1267358	1268799	But, okay, I have to go there.
1268879	1270660	And I'm not trying to knock Xbox.
1270700	1272461	Because I'm going to be real with you guys.
1272822	1279926	Based on all that internet stuff and all the rabble-rabble angry mobs we saw six months ago, I wasn't expecting Xbox One to do that well.
1280206	1280987	So, yay for them.
1281167	1283128	I think competition is healthy across the board.
1283449	1283889	However...
1284409	1289413	It is worth pointing out, Xbox One might have sold a million, but they did it in, what, 13 countries?
1289433	1291215	Whereas PlayStation 4 was only U.S.
1291255	1291935	and Canada, right?
1292095	1296679	I still think it's very skewed as far as, you know, it's good for day one.
1296839	1298801	Don't get me wrong, it's good for day one.
1298841	1309289	But if you're going to play the console wars here, you have to understand that we're talking a couple countries versus basically all their launch territories at once.
1309329	1311411	But it's not like doom and gloom for Xbox.
1311451	1312012	No, not at all.
1312032	1312552	Far from it.
1312632	1313012	Not at all.
1313233	1322481	But at the end of the day, once they do finally launch in all their countries or whatever, I think you're going to see a significant number more PlayStation 4s than you are the Xbox One.
1322521	1325224	Because I don't think they've still recovered completely from...
1327066	1349422	I think it's just the price I think at the end of the day for a lot of people I mean not the ones listening to this podcast or participating I think the folks you know active gamers participating in this kind of have a lot more issues to juggle but I think for a lot of people for a lot of parents sitting there going what do I buy for my teenage son or daughter which oh this one's cheaper I'm gonna get that I think for a lot of people that's what it's gonna come down to
1349642	1350182	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1372870	1374951	But it's certainly applicable in the broader sense.
1374991	1386538	There's still massive legions of people, parents that aren't into gaming, and they do add up to that majority of the people that would have gotten the console for their child, teen, anything along those lines.
1386818	1390240	And when it comes to the parents, I don't think you can totally count out Wii U either.
1390839	1391459	No, not at all.
1391479	1393380	I mean, they have some good games on there.
1394781	1396442	I mean, if you like Nintendo games, it's good.
1396842	1397602	Wii is going to be great.
1397662	1404066	If you're looking for other games from other companies, you may be having some issues.
1404986	1406127	We'll come back to this later.
1406907	1416131	But I'm just saying, though, as far as Nintendo games go, yeah, it's fantastic because a lot of people look forward to Nintendo games on those consoles.
1416231	1417032	But it's just...
1420399	1440318	I don't know they're kind of in their own thing they don't even want to compete in this next gen and that's why I always kind of laugh when they show okay the next generation is starting they show the Wii I'm like yeah okay whatever but it's just I don't know it'll be interesting to see what happens with all these consoles and stuff but it's just it's a rocky start I think
1441588	1448678	Doom Plague in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says Wii U currently has better games than either new console, just probably not for long.
1449018	1455367	I think that's a very good yes, I agree with you point because I would agree.
1455507	1458972	I think Wii U right now has better games than either one of those consoles.
1459432	1462254	But are we going to be able to say the same a year from now?
1462474	1462994	I don't know.
1463134	1466076	Because you're going to get some heavy, heavy hitters next year.
1466496	1469757	I imagine, you know, we already know there's going to be Destiny, Titanfall.
1470138	1473679	I imagine Microsoft's going to push out their new Halo for next holiday.
1473759	1475340	Or at least, you know, you're going to see a lot on that.
1475761	1480543	Sony, I don't know what they're... They'll probably have a new LittleBigPlanet or something.
1480623	1482184	They've got plenty of stuff they can rely on.
1482364	1486286	All of those games that they had to delay into first or second quarter 2015 that we've been talking about.
1486326	1488347	Uncharted 4 is coming.
1488507	1513219	and then so Nintendo's challenge is going to really be how are they going to stay afloat without all the third party support but they will throw out a new Zelda on Wii U next year I think we're all anticipating that if they don't honestly if they don't do a Zelda on Wii U next year there's going to be a lot of people that are disappointed that's the reality where we're at right now and Smash Brothers
1513760	1520922	Nintendo has a big 2014 for its namesake titles as does the rollout of the Xbox One and PS4 even Smash Bros.
1521002	1541589	I was kind of excited about it for the Wii and stuff but the new one just doesn't really it's kind of like hey look it's the same characters we had last time don't knock it until you see it a little more in motion I don't think we've really seen I mean yes we've had some teasers but you haven't seen the game really in motion getting your hands on it and all that and I think there's a lot to come with that
1541989	1567101	I think back to the Wii one when it was in development you know there was a big difference between the early early stages and hearing about the characters and then like really getting to play that thing you know those Smash Brothers games have a lot of depth to them and there's so much in the in the regards to the unlockables collectibles and all that stuff I just I I really hope they don't rush this Wii U one but it's been in development a hell of a long time so I would think we're gonna be ready in 2014 but we'll see
1568081	1573785	All right, anyhow, I think that's enough of our kickoff topic of Xbox One and everything else going on.
1574265	1579548	Let's talk a little more specifically about what you yourself have been doing in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week?
1579808	1582770	I would usually let ladies go first, but we don't have any tonight.
1582850	1585432	But Jason, since you are sitting in Jamie's chair, go for it.
1585472	1586412	How was your gaming week?
1586912	1588694	I have been playing a lot of real-life the game.
1589074	1594737	It's a epic training simulator and workout simulator and driving simulator and walking simulator.
1594757	1597039	You even sound like Jamie with that gaming week.
1598896	1606343	It's been a really light couple of weeks because I, as I'm sure many people remember, I was here a couple episodes ago.
1607344	1611207	I've been to Arizona and back in that time I was training a new coworker this week.
1612889	1613970	Incredibly busy times.
1614310	1619535	I'm basically just grinding a little bit more, by which I mean getting completely obliterated by...
1619835	1622437	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1638668	1641869	They didn't just come out last week, but I noticed within the past month or so.
1641929	1643149	Since the last time you were on, I think.
1643709	1655112	Yeah, just casual grinding of games with a very defined start and end, and are also very friendly to just stop what I'm doing wherever I am with no penalty to speak of.
1656672	1660813	Yeah, that's honestly really about all I've had time for this past week.
1661107	1661507	Dexter Dexter
1683257	1687379	I was just trying to take a break from Grand Theft Auto for a little bit.
1687499	1692842	I'm going to go back into it, obviously, really soon.
1694163	1698165	Once again, I know the new Steam sale is coming up soon, and I'm like...
1699417	1700097	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1729652	1730512	Oh, sorry, yeah, yeah.
1730952	1733153	But yeah, you can get all that.
1734473	1734994	I picked that up.
1735014	1737654	I haven't played it yet, but I was very excited to see that in there.
1737874	1741035	I don't recall all the details, but I stumbled across something the other day.
1741235	1743376	It was basically a make-your-own Humble Bundle.
1744776	1746077	Well, they launched the store now.
1746197	1748337	There's a lot of different websites that have it.
1748397	1753719	Yeah, I've seen the improvements that Humble Bundle has been rolling out in that regard, but I thought it was something unique.
1753979	1754279	Yeah.
1755899	1756119	Damn.
1756360	1758363	No, I came across it.
1758383	1761608	I was like, I don't have time and I don't have money.
1761688	1761988	Bye.
1762048	1763570	And so I didn't take in enough of the details.
1764204	1764664	Sorry, Loki.
1764805	1768107	No, there's a bunch of different Humble Bundle-esque sites.
1769288	1770509	There's one of them that does that.
1771030	1772231	I don't know.
1772511	1773732	But yeah, so that's pretty much that.
1774112	1779477	And I've just been messing around with Clicker today just because, I don't know, I'm just bored.
1780017	1788264	And I can't start Fallout right now because it's in the middle of the show and this doesn't take any intelligence at all other than clicking a mouse.
1788384	1791487	So yeah, that's pretty much where I've been.
1791952	1794475	All right, well, I've been very busy with a couple new games.
1794795	1799440	I've been playing the usual stuff as well, including, you know, helping Alan and stuff.
1799861	1803745	But this Friday, obviously, was the release of the Xbox One.
1804085	1806528	I feel the same way about the one that I do about the PlayStation 4.
1807149	1808730	The games aren't there for me right now.
1809071	1812555	Next year, I'm probably going to have to pick up both because you're going to have things like...
1813415	1835840	Final Fantasy XIV and Destiny on PlayStation 4 things I definitely want over there and then on Xbox One I'm sure they'll announce Forza Horizon 2 which will be enough for me to want to get an Xbox One so I'll get those in 2014 but for now being a Wii U owner I was very excited about the release of Super Mario 3D World on the Nintendo Wii and Wii U thank you yes Wii U
1836880	1862259	and I will tell you this the game delivers it's it's outstanding I I love it it's it's what you would kind of expect I don't think it really like to me it feels a lot different than 3d land on the 3ds did because obviously for one it's not really in 3d but for two I think just the larger screen the more diverse characters I feel like there's kind of more going on in each stage because of it
1862839	1870631	I'm gonna tell you the thing I like most about Mario 3D World is the attention to detail and it's the little things that really make that game.
1871171	1878222	The things from you get really close to a Goomba and the Goomba spots you and makes angry Goomba face and starts charging at you.
1878742	1904558	or when you step on a turtle and there's that literal moment you can actually see the little koopa of the whole like where'd my pants go type of thing and running over to try to get the shell as fast as they can to the little sound when you walk on a glass you hear the clink clink clink clink when you're actually walking on glass pipes to when you're underwater the background music actually changes completely to when you come back above the water it goes back to where it was at to when you're kitty Mario
1905618	1931085	which really is the best thing ever that was a great power-up love it when you're climbing up a wall and you go as far as you can because you can't just climb the wall infinitely finally you get to a certain point where you can't climb anymore and they're just like they claw onto the wall and they start slipping and they leave little claw marks behind like as they're falling and look really sad like it's those little details that really do it for me and yeah I mean the level design obviously is great
1931605	1938129	There's things to collect in every level, so just because you beat it once doesn't mean you're going to collect all three green stars and the stamp and everything.
1938810	1941531	The social elements are very interesting.
1941571	1950697	I know we give Nintendo a hard time about not understanding online, but the way they've integrated Miiverse into this and the ghost Miis and everything is interesting.
1952718	1954980	I think in some ways it's kind of give or take.
1955680	1966423	But just to kind of give you an example, while you're walking around the world map, you'll see these random Miis on the map, and if you walk up to them, they'll have a little picture of something they wrote on Miiverse about that world.
1967003	1977266	When you beat a stage, you'll actually see, scrolling across the top of the screen, Miiverse posts from people who also played that stage and posted something about it on Miiverse.
1977906	1980867	And I'll give you an example of how this can work, is that...
1981647	1983949	I was playing a level in World 3 not long ago.
1984009	1988473	It's a water level, and we all love water levels, but they're a necessary part of any Mario game, right?
1988873	1991455	And I couldn't find two of the stars in the level.
1991495	1993397	I could find the last one, but I couldn't find the first two.
1993837	2001483	So when I beat the level, it shows me all the Miiverse posts, and one of the first ones that comes up is, Where are the first and second stars?
2001543	2003645	And I'm like, thank God it's not just me.
2004085	2005627	That was literally my reaction, right?
2005947	2008809	So that was kind of, I don't know, that was a neat reaction.
2009930	2024617	I can't think of that I get in any other game right now and I'm not saying it's like a huge deal or a game changer or OMG Nintendo's pushing the envelope but I will say that was a unique reaction that immediate instant feedback that I can't say I get anywhere else right now.
2024657	2028178	That instant attachment to another individual somewhere out there in the universe.
2028218	2028818	Me too!
2029259	2029859	Me too!
2030039	2033480	Stranger Danger 10357 or whatever your name is, right?
2034121	2039243	You know, there was that instance where I did kind of feel like oh okay, so I'm not the only crazy one.
2040023	2056669	Yeah, it's a very interesting case to think about the fact that, yeah, Nintendo is not necessarily getting the always-on, multi-world, MMO, universe-style network services, but they're pushing a really damn good community.
2057290	2060351	And as long as they keep up the moderator actions and filtering... It's moderated.
2060531	2061891	It's a moderated community.
2062532	2062612	And...
2063912	2071515	That works and it doesn't work because again, you know, we criticized Nintendo last week about the whole swap note thing, which I think was completely valid.
2071895	2074616	I think it was ridiculous the way they threw the baby out with the bathwater with that.
2075036	2090583	But I mean, there's a difference between these type of public communications you have in a game like Mario, you know, Super Mario 3D World and the private communications where essentially if, you know, me and a friend are both over the age of 18, we should be able to send whatever we want because we could do it on an email anyway.
2090703	2090843	Right.
2090983	2091603	You know, so.
2092004	2098407	These emotions and expressions that they're capturing in the public eye is quite unique and very worthy and very fun to see.
2099777	2126417	level design again have I mentioned how great the level design is in the game because I will tell you what also in world 3 there's a level and this might be a minor spoiler so mute for about 60 seconds if you don't want to hear it I don't think it's a big deal but some people are nutso about spoilers so mute it if you don't want to hear it there's a level in the third world that invokes Mario Kart like right on down to the level actually looks like a Mario circuit track and you're running over these little dash squares that was so much fun to play
2127438	2155660	and I didn't even play it in multiplayer which can you imagine I've only played this game in single player but the whole thing is designed for four people to play and I can only imagine what a riot some of these games are in multiplayer and some of these levels and so forth one of the things that I hear about the game is that whoever does the best in a level wears a little crown in the next level so you know people are going to be trying to steal that crown and pick on the player who has the crown and I'm sure it makes for amazing
2157401	2184689	multiplayer experiences but I have yet to do those so anyway Mario 3D World if you are a Wii U owner I don't know why you don't have this game yet you need to make it a priority to get your hands on this game because it is the best Wii U game available now I already thought the one they released last year was pretty good but this one blows it out of the water it really does this is great so Mario 3D World is a must have if you're a Wii U owner is it a system seller?
2186650	2189092	If you like Nintendo systems, yeah.
2189272	2189972	It's getting there.
2190493	2191474	It's definitely getting there.
2191654	2197118	It's yet another game now where it's like, alright, now Wii U is starting to really build up that library.
2197378	2207045	If I drop the money on a Wii U, now I have two solid Mario games, Zombie U, Nintendo Land, maybe Wonderful 101 if you're into that, or Pikmin.
2207065	2212849	It is strengthening Nintendo's library, but is it going to be a system seller?
2213369	2215291	It really depends on what type of games you're into.
2216011	2242818	it's a real bummer Mario Kart 8 didn't make it this year because I think and I'm all for take the time to get it right and also that's part of how they're going to make 2014 not feel like the desert that 2013 was but I think if Mario Kart 8 had come out and it was solid and they were able to deliver that one-two punch on the Wii U I would be like you gotta buy a Wii U because there's all these games now but with only the
2243278	2253515	one huge great game it's a little harder to say because I think you really have to say like how much do I want to play Mario 3D World but I'm telling you it's really good
2255251	2264395	So, um... The other Nintendo game I happened to pick up this week, I actually went and bought a 3DS XL because I'm that big of a whore for 2D Zelda.
2265195	2269757	And I love Link to the Past, so of course I was all over Link Between Worlds.
2269797	2272759	And yes, I've seen the stories about how it's really 3D and all this stuff.
2273019	2273579	You know what I mean.
2273639	2275780	It still plays like Link to the Past and all that.
2276080	2284024	So I bought a new Zelda 3DS XL, which has the Triforce, the, you know, high rule and low rule Triforces on it, and I've been playing the game, and I...
2285505	2287106	Thanks for watching!
2303499	2304799	and so on and so on.
2331724	2334825	I also have to hand it to the team that created this.
2335325	2337446	The 3D effects are great.
2338286	2352250	And considering a lot of us thought Nintendo was abandoning 3D when they released the 2DS, it was quite pleasing to see a 3D game that really benefits from having the 3D switch on if you are into viewing the 3D and everything.
2352610	2355471	Like just from the little creatures jumping, the little...
2356631	2357272	What were their names?
2357332	2358793	The Octoroks shoot the rocks, right?
2358813	2360594	What are the little jumping spider things called?
2360635	2361035	Tektites?
2361055	2361515	Were those Tektites?
2361535	2361815	I don't know.
2361835	2366279	Those guys that jump up and you actually kind of see that in 3D is great.
2366880	2370843	When you jump off a cliff, you see that little 3D kind of enhancement.
2371564	2377208	You definitely see it in dungeons when, you know, you're on a level, but there's like an upstairs and a downstairs within the same level.
2377468	2380431	You definitely get a sense of that 3D effect and it's done tastefully.
2381091	2381171	Um...
2381952	2383112	Yeah, it's great.
2383513	2388675	And I've heard a lot of talk about how, well, it's really weird that you can kind of rent everything from the shop in the beginning.
2390195	2391476	It's just a different way of doing it.
2391776	2393416	It didn't really change things for me.
2393677	2396958	There's still definitely points and things that you get in the dungeons.
2397939	2400721	There will be ways that you will want to play things in a certain order.
2401202	2403344	I wasn't really bothered by the rental system at all.
2403624	2404145	You know what?
2404325	2413695	It also helps differentiate it from Link to the Past and make it its own game, which is one of the better Zelda games that will be out there in the franchise for sure.
2415657	2420101	Ranma says, Zelda A Link Between Worlds is essentially a Link to the Past second quest.
2420842	2421442	Don't agree with you.
2422203	2430848	I think they've changed enough where it... Especially once you get that ability where you can actually kind of glue yourself to walls and walk around and all that.
2430968	2434170	It really changes a lot of the puzzles and so forth.
2434210	2436711	And just such the graphical upgrade and everything.
2437211	2439072	I don't know if I would call it a second quest.
2439693	2439813	It's...
2441274	2441575	I don't know.
2441875	2442616	It's like I said earlier.
2442636	2444458	It's like revisiting an old friend.
2444578	2445920	Are there elements of Link to the Past?
2446060	2446621	Absolutely.
2446941	2451186	But it is definitely its own game and it is worth the price that they're asking for it.
2451226	2452308	The $40 or whatever.
2453129	2454270	I don't know because I bought the bundle.
2454491	2455011	But I think it's what?
2455031	2455452	$40 retail, Loki?
2456753	2458194	Yeah, it's worth it.
2459294	2459654	There it goes.
2461154	2461455	Let's see.
2461475	2462395	I'm trying to look at our chat room.
2462415	2466056	Sorry, I was talking so much I have been falling behind on our chat room.
2466076	2466796	He was fanboying.
2467056	2467837	Yeah, a little bit.
2467977	2468477	A little bit.
2468537	2473438	Which, you know, it's funny because I've been accused of the whole Nintendo fanboy thing, which whatever.
2473458	2474579	I'm going to like what I like.
2475399	2479345	But, I'd like to think I'm also critical of Nintendo when they need it too.
2479906	2490923	So, and, you know, the whole online thing last week and the fact that, you know, yes, Super Mario World, Super Mario 3D World is great, but is it going to be enough to really push the Wii U's this year?
2492310	2492911	I don't know.
2493711	2494031	I don't know.
2494051	2497174	I think Nintendo really needed that one other game, but we'll see.
2497334	2497674	We'll see.
2498355	2501778	I'm rooting for them, though, but I'm rooting for Microsoft and Sony as well.
2501918	2502998	Is that so wrong?
2503719	2505861	Aren't I allowed to like all the games?
2506721	2508263	Is something wrong with me?
2509143	2509504	Everything.
2509984	2510785	So says the internet.
2512990	2517674	Yes, I'll complain about things that need complaining about, but I'm going to cheer on the things that need cheering of.
2517954	2522899	And these Mario and Zelda games are accomplishments that are worthy of the cheering.
2523539	2524100	Absolutely.
2525836	2532377	Alright, let's see, live.vognetwork.com TigerClaw says, Zelda becomes shorter if you have the guide for it.
2532657	2533657	Try playing without one.
2533677	2535538	You'll spend hours trying to figure stuff out.
2535578	2537398	Well, I mean, couldn't that be said about any game?
2537898	2541119	I mean, if you use the guide, you're gonna have all the puzzles answered for you.
2542279	2547840	Zelda does have an interesting system in it where you can use the play coins that you get from walking around on the 3DS.
2548160	2550780	You can use those to buy hints from a ghost.
2551120	2555061	Like, you get these little glasses in the beginning, hint glasses, and you can use them to buy hints.
2555561	2566534	so up to you if you want to use them or not I think that's interesting some people will probably get really turned off by that but then I just say don't equip them and then they won't be there so um
2568143	2568843	Let's see.
2569083	2572644	Also looking for some more chats at live.vognetwork.com.
2573064	2578626	Actdeft says, I'm forgetting Zelda Wind Waker HD, Rayman Legends, and some other games.
2579066	2579566	You're right.
2579706	2583827	I probably am forgetting those games, but let's also not kid ourselves.
2583927	2588548	Both those games you mentioned are available on other consoles, especially in the case of Rayman Legends.
2589168	2595850	I know the game was developed for Wii U, and it's probably best on Wii U, but the reality is it's not exclusive to Wii U anymore.
2596790	2616726	uh Zelda Wind Waker HD I haven't played that yet I'm very much looking forward to it but I even if the game is outstanding which I'm sure it's great it's really hard to call a reimagining of a GameCube game something that's going to really sell a lot of consoles although maybe it did for some people I don't know maybe I'm being too hard on it
2618604	2622065	It was the earlier Zelda release on the Wii U. Yeah, you did.
2622625	2625805	Taste tester before... Or it's the only Wii U release.
2625825	2626405	What am I saying?
2626525	2627826	Link Between Worlds is 3DS.
2627966	2628326	Right, right.
2628406	2632346	It was also extremely quickly put together.
2632366	2633487	And I'm not saying that in a bad way.
2633547	2635827	From what I understand, everybody that I know that's played it really loves it.
2636347	2638587	But they essentially threw it together.
2639248	2641148	And I'm not sure how to take that.
2641208	2644428	I mean, I guess that's a good thing that you can put out a quality product so fast.
2644468	2646629	But they did have to reimagine an old game to do it.
2647109	2647329	So...
2648349	2673998	um but you're right I shouldn't totally count out when Waker HD is something that is available there are going to be you know the game is 10 years old there are going to be a lot of people out there especially in their teens that probably never touched the first game so you know anyway all right uh I've I've gushed enough about new Mario new Zelda but I'm telling you they're great and honestly is there an Xbox One or PlayStation 4 launch game as good as Mario 3D World
2675778	2676238	I doubt it.
2676679	2678239	I highly, highly doubt it.
2679600	2683202	Now, a year from now, will we be able to say the same thing?
2683422	2683902	Probably not.
2684443	2686364	Wii U also came out a year ago.
2686404	2688365	They had a year to make this game, or more.
2688845	2697450	So, I'm sure a year from now it'll be a different story, but I'm telling you, this really makes this whole next-gen console war... I'm using my little quotey fingers...
2698610	2702874	I like to consider the holiday season starting on September 17th, but that's just me.
2717205	2720546	Yeah, I have to mention, of course, Grand Theft Auto 5.
2721226	2722307	Which you haven't played yet.
2723067	2726868	But I recognize that a lot of people are going to call that the game of the year.
2728188	2734230	I don't think it's in the show world tonight, but those Spike TV award things that they announce a lot of games at.
2734290	2734650	Yeah, VGX.
2734690	2736331	Bioshock Infinite Bioshock Infinite
2754687	2755929	Depends what kind of games you're into.
2756049	2756970	I don't know.
2757030	2758292	It's a popularity contest.
2758312	2758833	It is a little bit.
2758953	2761696	And then I saw Tomb Raider in there, too, which was a pleasant surprise.
2761756	2767124	I think Tomb Raider's great and a good kick in the butt for the franchise, so I was happy to see that in there.
2767504	2769086	Did anybody else remember what else was in there?
2769166	2769987	Maybe our chatters do.
2770088	2771670	Live.vognetwork.com.
2773117	2773437	I don't know.
2797828	2799610	Oh my god, there's so many hours.
2799770	2803733	That's kind of one of the reasons I'm like, do I really want to start Fallout New Vegas?
2803753	2806936	Because Skyrim, holy shit, did that take off a lot of my time.
2806996	2809578	Yeah, yeah.
2809858	2818245	Speaking of those games, Loki, when they inevitably announced Elder Scrolls 6 for next generation consoles, will you be on board?
2818506	2819927	Oh no, you'll be like, it's on PC.
2820367	2821268	I can mod it on PC.
2822709	2825932	Yeah, I might actually... I don't blame you, I don't blame you.
2826417	2826857	Thanks for watching!
2841966	2857279	TigerClaw having that same thought at live.vognetwork.com what if they announce Elder Scrolls 6 for next gen not before the next Fallout because it kind of seems like they're going in that pattern Elder Scrolls 6 is not coming for another couple years at least because they have also online which is at some point
2857719	2868344	Which I think is good news because I think they need some time to... Again, the games that came out right during the launch window, a little bit not the full potential of the system.
2868704	2873266	So I think the more time that Elder Scrolls 6 has to incubate a little bit, I think that's actually a good thing.
2873646	2874786	We don't want it right away.
2875587	2878128	Trust me, it's a good thing.
2879629	2880589	There is that part of me.
2880629	2881509	And here is where...
2883090	2883950	Mass Effect 4 Mass Effect 4?
2884010	2884891	Yeah, what if it's current gen?
2908544	2909105	Thanks for watching!
2924335	2926217	I play Mass Effect 3 multiplayer on PC myself and it's great.
2926257	2927018	So I could just keep the PC.
2927038	2927819	I think for me though, having that
2941892	2967990	Graphic and my first experience with Mass Effect was on the Xbox 360 so I still associated my mind with consoles I just kind of think for me Mass Effect 4 is only going to sweeten the pot for the next gen consoles it's not really going to be the reason I get a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One or whatever but it's just I'm just going to be like just add that to the list of why just put that in all caps there in the pro column Mass Effect 4 right there so
2968730	2969031	Alright.
2970492	2975839	I'm saying Mass Effect 4 but whatever they end up calling it because obviously the Shepard series is over.
2975859	2976620	Y'all know what I mean.
2977081	2977821	Y'all know what I meant.
2980264	2980665	Let's see.
2980765	2985171	Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com BlackWolf says, I just don't want to see Sky on a table.
2985411	2986732	Well then don't come to the mall with me.
2989075	2993740	Alright, let's get into some housekeeping and then we'll do gaming news of course.
2994040	2997824	Just real quick, don't forget you can follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
2998164	3003229	We are also available on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google+.
3003709	3007053	Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.
3007093	3009936	We finally got one of those short URLs like a lot of people are getting now.
3010676	3014439	Also, I think this is something we're going to do starting this week.
3015520	3019623	Finally, thanks to Jason's help, I was able to get the keys to the YouTube channel back.
3020224	3023847	So we are going to look at posting episodes of Orange Launch Radio on YouTube.
3025748	3029391	We're not Orange Launch Video all of a sudden, so that is not something that's going to be there.
3029771	3033014	It will just be the audio with a static picture.
3033754	3035316	Maybe at a later date we could...
3036616	3061848	if we talk about screenshots we can enhance the videos of that or something it depends how well received the YouTube thing is this is just a crazy experiment we have to try to get the show out to more people because YouTube does have a very big audience I think the show can get more exposure so hello to all you YouTubers and thanks for checking out the show depending on how well the show is received on YouTube we might see what else we can kind of do to enhance the show that way
3062548	3066130	But yeah, right now it's just about trying to get the show out there.
3066650	3070792	And plus the news that YouTube is coming to things like the 3DS.
3071172	3072892	YouTube's available on the Vita.
3073513	3078075	Anything that is another way that people can easily listen to OLR, we want to get in on that.
3078315	3081336	So that is coming, I think, starting this week.
3081376	3084857	I think this very episode will go up on YouTube if everything goes in my favor.
3085177	3085618	So there we go.
3087318	3087598	All right.
3088538	3089539	Let's move on.
3090259	3094620	TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, you ever played around with Google Hangout?
3094880	3095140	Yes.
3095560	3097401	Perhaps you can try doing OLR with it.
3097481	3098661	It would archive to YouTube.
3099101	3099321	No.
3101081	3102062	I'm going to be honest.
3102202	3104742	And maybe I'm just being a stickler with this.
3105382	3107043	This isn't interesting to watch.
3108604	3112286	We're all just sitting around a table with our microphones in hand.
3112306	3114847	Oh, I'm not interested in watching any of this.
3115567	3117208	It's really not that interesting to watch.
3117568	3124891	And I would need a director to sit here with us if we were to push video to its full potential.
3124911	3130654	I guess my point I'm trying to get at is if we make that jump to video, I kind of don't want it to be like half-assed.
3131014	3137457	I want somebody to actually be able to, if we talk about a game, throw up the B-roll footage of the game, be able to show that there.
3137797	3141219	And that's just kind of too much for us to be able to put out right now.
3142400	3157607	I think, and I've been on this show for many, I think this show is best consumed, listen to it in the background while you play video games, or while you chat in our chat room, or while you're at work doing whatever data entry or writing or whatever it is you do that doesn't require you to be listening at work right now.
3157947	3166596	I think our show is best consumed that way I think if you were to sit here and watch Talking Heads for three hours talk about video games that would be the most boring thing in the world to me
3167932	3168713	But that's just my thought.
3169053	3170133	Convince me I'm wrong.
3170394	3172015	And maybe I am just being stubborn.
3172075	3175617	And keep in mind, I've done radio for the past 10 plus years.
3175697	3178139	So this just might be my old fuddy-duddy way of thought.
3179159	3180120	Convince me I'm wrong.
3180180	3180821	I'm all ears.
3181241	3182482	I've been wrong before.
3182642	3183162	Lord knows.
3184743	3185023	All right.
3187725	3190167	Let's get into gaming news tonight.
3190827	3191908	Now that that's all out of the way.
3193746	3194206	One hour in.
3194287	3194827	One hour in.
3212941	3213221	For us.
3213662	3213842	Yeah.
3213942	3214382	For this show.
3214562	3214742	Yeah.
3214782	3216844	You do what works for you.
3216924	3217664	And I will say this.
3217744	3221066	Google Hangout is a great way to produce a podcast.
3221687	3222367	Super easy.
3223108	3223768	Super easy.
3224228	3227931	And I am all for more voices getting out there and more people being heard.
3228191	3231253	So if Google Hangout's the way you do that, go for it.
3231733	3232274	Absolutely.
3234335	3239899	I will brace myself for the angry emails I'm sure to incur from all that, but know that I am trying to be well-intentioned.
3240159	3241100	All right, Loki.
3242000	3257891	All right, so like with any console launch, there's a little bit of hiccups usually with console launches, and that was definitely the case of the PlayStation 4 with the random blinking blue light of doom or whatever you want to call it.
3258231	3264657	Well, now the Xbox One is also running into similar issues, except no blinking lights this time around.
3264977	3276087	Instead, it's the sound... Yes, much like the Xbox 360, except at least it's not actually carving a nice ring into your disc this time.
3276287	3280271	It's just making a grinding noise and not reading discs.
3280471	3282593	And so people are running into those issues.
3283774	3284796	Thanks for watching!
3300795	3301235	I don't know.
3302216	3316023	Once again, the console's only been out a few days, so it's hard to say how widespread anything is, but I think it's important for Microsoft at this point to do some damage control.
3316223	3324687	I saw their response, which is basically, hey, if you have an issue with your system, call the customer support, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3325648	3327609	Okay, that's very...
3331184	3331564	I don't know.
3331584	3348616	That's very scripted of you to say that and instead addressing how many units might be affected versus last week when a similar situation was happening where different systems were breaking or DOA from Sony, you heard...
3349597	3350157	DarkSakura.com
3368466	3376411	I think right there that's addressing everything instead of, you know, not commenting on it and letting everyone speculate how bad the issue is.
3376492	3384297	And I'm worried that, I mean, and I don't want to sound doom and gloom, but I'm worried that it may be a little bit more widespread than it seems.
3384737	3397005	Hopefully it's not because I would hope that, you know, they would test their hardware, you know, well and figure out that these problems, hopefully, you know, some sort of bad run on these disk drives or something.
3400228	3403230	Be wary at console launches that you're going to run into issues.
3405171	3411556	Kind of a fair warning for any console launch that there's going to be speed bumps.
3411916	3414818	But we don't think this is as bad as the Red Ring of Death yet.
3415699	3416760	So far, yeah.
3416840	3419382	Not as big of an issue, but we'll see.
3419682	3420162	Time will tell.
3420723	3422244	And really, once again, it's...
3423866	3444120	It's, see how they respond to it, you know, how they, I think it would be nice if they came out and said something similar to what Sony said, where it's like, hey, listen, it's only this, it's not a widespread thing, we've only received, you know, you know, it's .04% or whatever, you know, compared to the system, you know, it's within standards, this is what, you know, we were expecting.
3446081	3449303	I just wish there was more coming from them other than very scripted, you know.
3449583	3451625	To be fair, this is what we were expecting.
3451865	3453986	Is it going to work if I'm one of those people?
3454206	3460491	Not what we were expecting, but it's within regular electronics yields as far as defectives go.
3460531	3463133	I mean, it's such a low percentage that...
3464940	3467562	It sounds like they're making it easy at least on the Microsoft side.
3467582	3474285	I don't know about Sony's side, but on the Microsoft side, they just ship you a new one and then you have to ship the old one back in two weeks or you get charged.
3474445	3475026	That's what they're doing.
3475046	3476106	They make it easy.
3476226	3478768	That's easier than the 360 replacement was, to be honest.
3479108	3479768	And that's great.
3479808	3480949	I'm glad that they're doing that.
3481189	3482650	And I think that's what they need to do.
3482750	3484591	But at the same time, I think that they need to...
3485271	3511332	especially come on Microsoft you need to know like after all of the fallout and stuff from even when you're announcing the Xbox One stuff I think you need to talk more to your customers more directly and not sound like it's some scripted PR thing make it more candid I guess interesting kind of two good comments in the chat room but a little different Gene at live.vognetwork.com says damage control will freak out and make it a bigger deal though
3512293	3515335	It could have that effect where... It didn't seem like that was the effect, though.
3515435	3516556	The media would pick up on that.
3517176	3520038	Tal says, if they acknowledge it, the problem will disappear.
3520118	3522540	If they attempt to deny and deny, then the issue will balloon.
3523921	3529184	But they're just not... I mean, all they're doing is just saying, hey, you have a defective system, contact customer support.
3529484	3533287	I could have figured that out without reading anything from them.
3533907	3536769	It's not like, oh, well, shit, I don't know what to do with this console.
3537469	3541652	I mean, come on, if you're buying an Xbox console, you know what to do with your console if it's going to be broken.
3542279	3548105	I'm just saying because, you know, especially if you bought it launched last year or not last year, last time around.
3548745	3549026	All right.
3549066	3554411	Well, to be fair, you know, we're talking about Xbox One problems, but PlayStation 4 also had problems.
3554431	3555352	So let's talk about those.
3556613	3563480	And Sony talked about in an interview with Engadget this week exactly where those numbers are at, which Loki referred to a minute ago.
3564180	3574665	Quote, the number of effective PlayStation 4 systems is less than 1%, which represents a very small percentage of total units shipped to date and is within the expected range for a new product introduction.
3574685	3576266	So that's almost exactly what you were saying, Loki.
3577006	3585311	We understand the frustration of consumers that have had a problem and are working with them and our retail partners to help troubleshoot issues and ensure affected units are exchanged.
3585571	3586011	So, you know...
3586971	3590752	I really don't know how they can give you a better answer than that.
3591172	3595014	Although, again, if I'm one of those 1%, I'm still not going to be happy.
3595454	3597734	But, I mean, I guess what else can they do?
3597794	3598915	If there's a problem, there's a problem.
3599075	3601336	I mean, who's actually happy about the effect of electronics?
3602056	3602356	Nobody.
3603316	3606897	But you know, I think about it, you know, it's really not just video game consoles.
3606977	3610718	I mean, iPhones are kind of notorious for having a lot of problems too.
3611238	3616699	Like the freaking switches, like on my first iPhone 5, that little switch, or what was it?
3616979	3619639	Something broke on, oh my, my sleep button, that's what it was.
3619959	3621280	The sleep button stopped clicking.
3621640	3626701	You know, those things start breaking pretty easy and I wasn't using my phone for anything too strenuous.
3626741	3632322	So, you know, it's not like only game consoles are broken all the time, but it's still irritating.
3632742	3633382	and DarkSakura.
3657407	3660288	Jason is going to be doing some stories for us tonight since Jamie's not here.
3660628	3668170	I am, and easily, per the organization, you don't even have to change the initial because Jason and Jamie start with the same letter.
3669571	3684355	Perhaps a relic of back when the Xbox was still a check-in every 24 hours if the system is offline, achievements will not unlock if you're playing a game while it's offline, presumably also if your internet connection is down, anything along those lines.
3686075	3705039	The common consensus is just that this is simply a holdover for achievement verification on the web and not some kind of... It'd be nice if this were some kind of like a buying achievement deterrent or something of the sort, but it's more likely just that it fell within the same expectations of the system always being online.
3705519	3707780	One of the really fun things with this article is that...
3709521	3721609	So this was an announcement posted on Xbox 360 Achievements that when they realized that I was playing one game, I got achievements for another one because apparently their internet connection had died for some period of time.
3722310	3725852	And so they link to a help article on support.xbox.com.
3726773	3733877	And I thought this was... I guess I've always known that we've been headed in this direction, but it makes me laugh and cry equal amounts.
3734097	3748005	If you get no gamer score earned from app achievements, the prescribed resolution says, "...you can earn app achievements for basic use of an app, such as watching a movie on Netflix, at the app developer's discretion.
3748465	3752748	App achievements do not affect gamer score, though they may bring other in-app awards."
3753548	3758534	And this stuff is starting to go into things that don't have anything to do with gaming at all.
3759334	3760796	I'm going to give you a great example.
3770706	3775048	Target, the store, has a brand new app on iPhone, probably on Android too.
3775088	3775889	I can't imagine why it wouldn't be.
3775909	3776789	It's called Cartwheel.
3777049	3778710	It's like their new little coupon thing, right?
3779110	3785234	And you go into this big Target database that they have of all these coupons and you add them to your barcode.
3785254	3787155	You have to have a Facebook, I think, to sign up for it.
3787755	3790556	And you put all the little coupons on your thing, right?
3790656	3794638	And then you have your barcode and they scan your phone at the store and you get money back with it.
3794658	3795299	But here's the thing.
3796508	3798830	Game Center Achievements Game Center Achievements
3819627	3832636	I get it, and Foursquare very largely pioneered a lot of this with its badges and just the continued increase of them.
3833196	3835278	And there was also a camera app.
3836158	3851905	Not terribly unlike Instagram in 2009 that when Game Center and Custom Achievement Integration first hit, they would give you achievements and scores for filterless and filtered photos and all of these other snazzy framing and other things that you can do with the app.
3852545	3860189	I get it, and on a game console, if there's actually a merit to the reward, sure, but I... I don't know.
3860709	3862990	The generation's here, it's finally starting, whatever.
3863970	3865531	Just made me laugh and also cry.
3866480	3868941	Alright, some people in chat are asking questions here.
3869721	3870081	Let's see.
3872662	3874382	Tiger Claw says, yeah, that does sound weird.
3874422	3876643	What if they give you achievement for watching certain movies?
3876983	3883125	What if you unlock an achievement of a movie you didn't want people know you, which cause, I don't know where the grammar went there.
3883325	3883866	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3899506	3904868	So I could save on panties if I want, but it was marked with a little padlock.
3904908	3906028	And I was like, what does that mean?
3906088	3907369	It's, oh, it's private.
3907749	3913951	So if I'm buying women's panties, I'm not going to have to answer that question with my friends who see that I'm using that to save money.
3914211	3915651	Rob, why are you buying women's panties?
3916411	3918992	You watched Jersey Shore behind the scenes.
3919012	3921153	100 points for your lost sanity.
3923615	3951748	so I would imagine certain things would be private or you could lock away or what have you so there you go Bobby Blackwolf in chat wants to remind you VOG gives achievements that's right our lovely network vognetwork.com gamified with the achievements it's true and now in case you haven't heard me pimp this enough that whole gamification is turning into prizes if you haven't checked that out the raffle at vognetwork.com we're giving away cards against humanity this month next month we're giving away tune in next week to find out
3952708	3981333	I finally got my first comment based achievement on VOG Network the other day I don't comment too terribly much but I was posting addendums and explaining things on a previous episode and I got enough cumulative likes that I'm finally starting to get some loot for the task BlackWolfInChat says the app achievements are general they're like watch 10 videos about your favorite team in the NFL app not watch 10 videos about the Jacksonville Jaguars laughter
3982236	3982436	Good.
4012396	4015257	A good... Maybe not so much NHL.
4015277	4015978	I take that one back.
4016518	4021600	But most everything else that I've played, a good 70%, 80% of them are local.
4021820	4026082	But if you want to show off those achievements to anybody, you're going to have to connect online eventually.
4026162	4027483	So it can talk to the server.
4027883	4029784	360 and PlayStation 3 both do that today.
4029804	4029984	Sure.
4030364	4031985	So, I mean, I think...
4032545	4043133	It's the same group of people that were complaining about the 24-hour requirement because shoddy internet, internet instability, not having broadband.
4046917	4050479	Alright, so looking at Bobby really wants me to read this.
4050519	4051659	He sent me a private message.
4051999	4056601	Please note the Xbox One achievements seem to be a combination of achievements and rewards on the 360.
4057542	4066166	The rewards bring avatar items on the 360 and on Xbox One some of those zero point achievements bring in-game badges and titles.
4066946	4071988	So yeah, I mean, and that's kind of like the whole, you know, like I was talking about Cartwheel a minute ago.
4072048	4077329	You're not playing anything, but you're still getting those rewards for using it.
4077389	4081190	And I imagine even things like Twitch, because Twitch sent an email out.
4081250	4085071	They blasted all their broadcasters and said, hey, you can get achievements in our new app.
4085552	4086172	And maybe...
4087132	4114998	and I'm making shit up here but it would not be outside the realm of possibility that Twitch could be like and if you were in these achievements you can archive X more hours of video or your videos will be saved for X many more hours or your YouTubes will export this much faster or whatever they want to do you can chat in this color you know they could whatever little achievements they wanted to get they could do and it wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility for their power users quote unquote so
4116300	4118181	Alright, let's move on.
4118221	4120421	Loki, speaking of Twitch, right?
4120701	4121942	Yes, speaking of Twitch.
4123942	4131385	I just have to say, before you get into this, it's so fascinating to me how much that site is now really...
4132125	4156759	like we have mentioned that site easily 20 times more the past month than we did last year like it's the way it's so integrated into gaming culture now fascinates me and again I'm gonna say this again it really fascinates me nobody's competing with them do they have patents I don't know about I mean I guess there's Ustream but you don't hear Ustream as much as you hear about Twitch fascinates me
4158139	4161562	I would say the only other thing I can think of that comes close is YouTube.
4162222	4164524	But that is obviously... YouTube's different as well.
4165385	4166766	It's more video on demand.
4167606	4170849	Twitch, as most know, was born out of Justin.TV.
4170929	4173331	Justin.TV is in the same class as Ustream.
4173731	4177914	They're all very general and they have incredibly diverse content and it's a very broad service.
4178375	4181797	Twitch did something incredibly significant for gaming...
4183218	4184719	It just isolated it to gaming.
4185099	4194865	And that alone, and featured the biggest games that everybody goes into, Spectate, Dota, League of Legends, StarCraft, WoW to a lesser extent, Hearthstone now.
4196326	4211114	They did something that was very specific, perhaps because they started signing contracts with these big companies a year or two ago, but they have a dedicated, significant gaming experience, and now they are reaping the fruits of those contracts.
4212934	4214376	It's just fascinating to me.
4214996	4222783	And I think I joked last week, maybe Microsoft should delay Twitch TV so they can launch their whole Skype broadcast or Skype game room.
4224184	4229388	I'm really surprised nobody else is trying to kind of get in on that.
4229428	4230830	But anyway, that's a whole other show.
4230870	4237735	Sorry, Loki, I didn't mean to derail you, but it fascinates me how much we're talking about this and how much of a gaming culture it is now.
4238716	4265079	Well, so, you know, like we've said before, and actually I think more talking about, like, Nintendo even, just, you know, hey, look at all the bad things that could possibly happen with, you know, because we were talking about the whole swap note thing, and now you're saying, hey, well, you know, what's to stop somebody from, you know, showing their penis over the video chat on, you know, Nintendo Wii U?
4266340	4269722	Well, people found out that, hey, guess what?
4269762	4280169	You know, a really cool thing that you can do with the PlayStation 4 is that you can stream stuff with that wonderful Playroom app that's on there.
4281070	4287474	So, you know, you could basically sit down in a room and have those little robots running around and stuff, and you can almost create your own talk show.
4287814	4295940	That's what, like, some people have been doing, is they've been sitting there filming themselves doing stupid shit within the Playroom app.
4296800	4308509	and unfortunately it only takes you know one person to realize hey you can stream stuff out of there to have someone else realize hey I can stream really nasty weird shit from there and that's what happened so
4310456	4312238	Twitch has been trying to crack down on it.
4312258	4312478	It says,
4333874	4343144	However, what does not fall under the terms of service would be some dude having sex with his girlfriend on a couch in the middle of the Playroom app.
4343825	4344206	You know what?
4344306	4349331	Twitch had to have a way to deal with this anyway, though, because you could do all that shit on a PC if you wanted with your webcam.
4349391	4354177	So it's not like this is a foreign territory for Twitch to have to deal with, but...
4355718	4365104	Certainly, the PlayStation 4 and it broadening the Twitch community like that is kind of the interesting element of this.
4365865	4370108	The unfortunate thing about it, I really hope they don't disable Playroom for streaming.
4370128	4370488	No, there's...
4370788	4374591	because just like I talked about the Google Plus thing earlier is a great way to get your foot in the door.
4375132	4380156	I think, and I think it's really fun when there's a lot of people, you know, part of what I like about this show too is that we're all in the same room.
4380196	4381677	We all get to react to each other and so forth.
4382077	4385120	I think it would be awesome if people could do like broadcasts.
4385180	4385860	They were, yeah.
4385880	4386481	On Twitch, yeah.
4387202	4393847	There was one example of that.
4393867	4407918	There was someone doing a show called The Spartan Show and they were sitting down at a desk and they were talking about the PlayStation 4 and stuff and I think they were even taking Skype calls on a computer that was in there and they had the setup and stuff so that's kind of cool.
4408798	4415884	Having sex with somebody or in this case there was one that's like some guy motorboating somebody in a horse head mask but
4416591	4420393	Not... That's a little weird, but... Hasn't that happened on this show, though?
4421874	4423195	Not a horse head mask yet.
4423235	4427037	Maybe not a horse head mask, but I'm pretty sure one of the times... Motorboating has probably happened.
4427637	4430619	Motorboating has definitely happened on this show.
4430659	4434621	All those times Princess Irene has been here, I know motorboating has happened on this show.
4435982	4439684	Is this when I interject and say that Bobby Blackwell was just a little bit ahead of his time?
4440445	4441585	Friday Night Gaming?
4441725	4442446	Friday Night Gaming?
4443266	4444526	That was pre-Twitch.
4445067	4446207	I'm fairly confident.
4446247	4448748	He was doing it on Ustream, the other site.
4451208	4458430	Anyway, so outside of this crazy stuff, something of course that's being worked in right now is archiving.
4458530	4460171	They're planning on doing it for the PlayStation 4.
4461394	4466296	Considering for the Xbox One, I think probably just right now because the Xbox One Twitch service hasn't launched yet.
4466477	4469658	So once that does, we'll see what, you know, the feasibility of all stuff.
4469858	4472500	I'm sure that they're going to have archiving on both sides at some point.
4473340	4478482	And of course, you know, like I mentioned, the Xbox One does not have the Twitch service that launched and that is coming later on.
4479343	4480303	Sometime in the first part of 2014.
4483359	4484000	GameStreamer
4505823	4508905	And I would say the answer is obviously yes.
4508985	4516410	And it's even getting bigger with all this in, you know, kind of enrichments into the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4516830	4519812	But the question was more like, you know, well, why?
4519973	4523975	Why do people watch other people play games when you can be playing them themselves?
4524916	4530800	And I respect that position because I was there myself just a couple years ago, maybe even last year.
4530820	4532341	And I'm sure I've said that on this show.
4532881	4535143	Why the hell would I live stream when I can play something myself?
4535883	4549594	But I have found through trying it and kind of getting into other people's streams and seeing more and more of my friends easily be able to live stream as you know, it's so easy on PlayStation 4 and helping friends of mine be able to stream.
4550215	4554699	It's somewhat the modern day equivalent of being able to go plop down next to somebody on the couch.
4554959	4555679	What you doing?
4557180	4560482	Even across long distances, because that's almost like what it's become.
4560542	4565565	Like, Extifer might be streaming Rezagun one night, and I can just virtually go plop on him next to the couch.
4565845	4566605	What you doing?
4566625	4567366	What you playing?
4567406	4567826	How you doing?
4567846	4568586	You're dying.
4568727	4568987	You know?
4570327	4573009	It's like kind of the modern equivalent of that, in a way.
4573369	4574550	I think, for me, is like why...
4575570	4602358	for some people they get to see the best of the best they might have some other reasons too but for me I just love the fact that there's people that would even want to watch it and I can make something that can be a single player experience sometimes be more social a friend of mine was streaming a bunch of fighting games which normally I've been to a couple fighting game tournaments in my area yeah okay I haven't played a fighting game in a really long time but then he switched to dive kick
4603527	4608629	That game is completely freaking fascinating, and I'm mildly obsessed with it now.
4608829	4613651	And, you know, I know him, I have known him for a number of years, so I was just kind of coming in to socialize.
4614151	4620974	I've heard how good he is at Persona 3 Arena, so I was just kind of seeing what he's up to and seeing the other games he wants to play.
4621554	4628397	And just happenstance, I saw, you know, a new game that I literally never heard about before that day, and now every time I see it, it's just...
4630084	4655449	so simple on the face yet so incredibly deep and just a very you know dive kick is unlike any other fighting game out there so it was just a good random occurrence I go to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com lots of comments on this uh bonds006 says hear me out on this I don't care to watch others play games because I will be missing out on playing games I have two TVs in my living room and I have zero interest of watching a game stream while I am in the living room uh
4656409	4666331	It's like watching a friend play a game you don't have interest in playing, but curious enough to see how he or she plays it.
4667291	4671492	Dan at live.vognetwork.com says, I told my wife, this is like my football.
4671672	4673572	That's why I watch people stream games.
4674012	4681633	And now that these apps are showing up on TVs and in the devices and so forth, you watch it almost the same way you watch football now.
4682114	4684154	Instead of a cable box, it's an Xbox One box.
4684174	4684974	Yep.
4685414	4694439	Doom Plague says some games are really fun to watch, particularly open world type games like Grand Theft Auto.
4694779	4702203	Or Twitch games like, this wasn't particularly a big one, but imagine the modern equivalent of Geometry Wars.
4702503	4710167	Incredible Twitch action, once your brain can actually adapt to everything that's going on, it turns into a very fun spectator event incredibly quickly.
4711378	4716539	Mast Bishop in the chatroom says, when live streaming on the next gen consoles, can you see your viewer count?
4717019	4719660	Well, we don't know about Xbox One just yet because that app's not out.
4719940	4721360	But on PlayStation 4, yes.
4721640	4729162	When you do the whole little like where it has the side and the bottom bar and it kind of shrinks the screen just slightly, you can actually see how many people are watching the stream.
4729182	4732883	And it also counts how many chat lines have been spoken so far, which is interesting.
4733323	4735083	You can see how active your chatroom is.
4735383	4738704	But you can also see at the very bottom, you see the last two lines of chat.
4739304	4761672	which if you don't have a lot of people watching you can probably stay on top of very easy but imagine if you're one of the more popular broadcasters and you wouldn't be able to stay on top of the chat that way so I don't know 20 messages a second that thing will never stop moving that would be tough so I don't know but I think a lot of people probably don't interact with their chat rooms as much if you get that many comments because it's just impossible to stay on top of so
4762472	4764133	Alright, anyhow, let's move on.
4764213	4766993	Sorry, we're running really long tonight, but hey, it's one of those nights.
4768354	4772215	I guess we dabbled on this a little earlier in the show, but I want to talk about it a little more now.
4772315	4776556	This is about Nintendo talking about their Wii U lineup for 2014.
4777156	4786619	Basically, in an interview with Game Trailers, Reggie Fils-Aimé, who of course is Nintendo of America's president, said that there will not be a Wii U software drought like we saw in 2013.
4786659	4787079	Here it is, quote,
4789560	4795263	The way we're going to be different is we're going to certainly have a steadier pace of games, both for Wii U and for 3DS.
4795703	4798804	The marketing activity is going to be constant throughout the entire year.
4799164	4803106	You tease me a little bit that, boy, the first half of 2013 was a little quiet.
4803246	4804086	And you know what?
4804106	4805127	You look back and it was.
4805407	4807368	We're not going to be making that same mistake in 2014.
4808428	4809108	Hmm, admission.
4809749	4814231	So the pace, the ongoing activity, touching the consumer and messaging is what we're all about.
4814531	4816492	That's going to be a big difference next year.
4817532	4821578	I will say this, I went and saw Catching Fire on Friday, which by the way, amazing!
4822178	4825723	But they had a Wii U commercial, actually.
4825803	4833473	You know how they do, they do like the, this is the first look of the movies at the cinema, enjoy the, you know, basically the act.
4833473	4833873	and DarkSakura.com.
4860069	4870089	but I digress so Nintendo is trying to get the word out there in other ways for sure so they have the movie ads if nothing else but Reggie promising you're not going to see that same drought
4871465	4875087	Well, I bet that's why Donkey Kong and Mario Kart 8 aren't coming out right now.
4875708	4876908	I think that's a huge part of it.
4877349	4879270	I think the Donkey Kong delay was strategical.
4879790	4882011	I don't think it had anything to do with the game not being done.
4882552	4888976	I think Mario Kart maybe needed a little more tweaks because pushing that all the way back to April is quite a ways and maybe further.
4889896	4892898	But I think the Donkey Kong's now, what, February?
4893358	4895019	I think that is a strategical delay.
4895600	4900703	I think you didn't want to have two platformers out back-to-back and Mario 3D World is so damn good
4901363	4927755	You don't want to release Donkey Kong at the same time And then it's like, oh yeah, there's two good platformers It's because there's not a lot of Wii U titles coming out Seriously, there's not a lot of Wii U titles coming out So when Reggie talks about this whole There's not going to be a drought He's full of shit He's absolutely 100% full of shit Because here are the games coming out in February On the Wii U The Lego Movie and Donkey Kong
4929420	4931382	So does that sound like full of shit to me?
4931542	4933324	That sounds like a whole heap of shit.
4934645	4937548	Could there be stuff we just don't know about yet?
4937688	4942252	Because let's be real, they cranked out that Zelda Wind Waker HD thing fast.
4942413	4947357	Could they have other little... I mean, and we've heard the rumors before about the 64 revisited.
4947377	4949880	I don't remember what the hell they call that.
4950160	4950781	I even read that article.
4950801	4954244	I think I joked it was re-imagined, like they call RuPaul's Drag Race or something.
4954564	4957006	It was something similar to that, but you know what I'm talking about, right?
4957046	4957586	Re-imagined.
4957606	4958607	Re-imagined or something.
4958928	4963091	Could that be something that's in their pocket that they haven't quite played those cards yet?
4964072	4968175	I don't think that they've... They've already announced their first quarter.
4968216	4968616	I'm sorry.
4968696	4970437	They have one other title in...
4972760	4992239	so they have a title in January they are one of the only Wii U titles in January it's Wii Fit U but it's a disc based version for the game that's out already right now so that doesn't I don't really count that because you could get it right now but yes disc based version of Wii Fit U will be out in January
4993640	5019902	but come on it's just which was supposed to be out this year if I'm not mistaken it is out right now no the disc was supposed to be out this year that was pushed back but there is a drought there's not a whole ton of games coming out it's just the Lego movie and that's it so far for February March there's going to be some stuff but that's it Gene in chat brings up a good point live.vognetwork.com PlayStation 4 and Xbox One drought though
5021584	5024567	Could those systems be... Not for as long, period.
5024628	5025769	Launch window, whatever.
5026069	5032536	Well, I mean, at least we know... Is Destiny first quarter, or is that further back?
5032576	5033798	We're looking at summer for Destiny.
5034078	5036981	Right now, I think Placeholder is first quarter.
5037102	5039004	Okay, but Titanfall is first quarter for sure, right?
5039024	5039965	Titanfall is March.
5040325	5044248	So, there's some things trickling in there, at least.
5044408	5046069	But, I mean, Gene could have a good point.
5046149	5049511	I mean, what do the other systems have that's so great?
5050692	5052553	Well, there's a lot of placeholder stuff right now.
5054094	5056996	And to be fair, LEGO Movie is on all platforms.
5057356	5061418	So, there's that.
5061759	5062719	They do have some other titles.
5064080	5066422	I don't remember off the top of my head, so I'm going to actually go look.
5067322	5071967	Um, but, uh, I know a lot of the stuff I have right now is Placeholder Thief.
5072387	5074189	It's supposed to be, um, pretty soon.
5074789	5077532	I don't know if that's still gonna be first quarter, if that'll get pushed back.
5078353	5081216	Um, I was gonna say, um...
5082369	5111959	I think at least in PlayStation's camp I don't know so much about Xbox One but PlayStation's camp they're teasing a lot of oh yeah Infamous that's March I think they're teasing a lot of like betas you know there's the Destiny beta there's the Final Fantasy 14 beta there's the Elder Scrolls Online beta they're kind of trying to fill in the gap with all these like well the games won't be out but all these awesome previews you're waiting for will be so give or take that so anyway all right
5113866	5114987	Step Evolution Announces ReRave Plus Arcade
5129984	5140568	I have not seen the current ReRave arcade game, but I'm going to assume it's very similar to the rest of the touch-based attractions that Dave & Buster has.
5141028	5148831	So it is a big 40-inch touchscreen at about just above waist level and a nice placard sign to advertise what the game is.
5149451	5157534	But at a trade show in just the last couple of days, IAAPA, they announced ReRave Plus with a new cabinet design.
5158454	5162995	Very similar to how a lot of other games, notably DJ Max Technica, are going about it.
5164116	5169577	Standing cabinet taller than you with a little miniature platform where the subwoofer is that you step up onto.
5169997	5176179	You have the lean-in touchscreen that you go into play, and then a spectator's touchscreen above your face.
5178419	5195409	The improvements that come to ReRave+, notably any graphical changes or song lists, will be available for current ReRave arcade installations, but this new cabinet will look a hell of a lot better for people that want to plunk that money in again.
5196850	5203394	I've played ReRave a couple times just on my phone, probably more likely my iPad because the phone's a little bit difficult.
5204975	5209739	Just a quick overview of the game is that you have touch targets with timing.
5210279	5211260	It is a music rhythm game.
5211280	5212421	You touch them at a particular time.
5212461	5213442	It's elite beat agents.
5214183	5215083	It's elite beat agents.
5216404	5217225	Without the dancers.
5219087	5221388	It's been a really long time since I played that game.
5221849	5223870	It's virtually elite beat agents.
5223910	5229515	The only difference is that you can kind of better see when the things are going to hit with the clock formations, but that's really it.
5229735	5230516	And multiple taps.
5231650	5232671	Didn't League of Legends have those?
5232691	5233151	No.
5233211	5235353	Okay, then it's DJ Max Technica.
5236594	5237835	I wouldn't make that comparison.
5238196	5239357	A combination of the two.
5239777	5240197	Yeah, whatever.
5240437	5245121	Anyways, ReRave Plus, massive improvements for the arcade installations next year.
5245742	5246803	And it's a very pretty game.
5247103	5251247	I would like to see this in my local Dave & Buster's or elsewhere that I've been that I can't think
5252568	5260812	I loved and hated at the same time how they have to make sure that it's going to be relevant for an arcade by putting tickets spitting into it.
5272406	5274607	And it's one of those things where it's like, ah, gross.
5274727	5278868	But then at the same time, you're like, well, it's actually a worthy game to do that kind of thing.
5278928	5283510	Well, but the reality is that's the only way it's going to get into arcades, which sucks.
5284470	5285050	Don't hear me wrong.
5285070	5285931	Imagine if DDR gave tickets.
5286531	5289592	All those noobs failing to getting their free song on Beginner would get like one.
5290112	5294093	But then everybody else that plays the super hard songs, hey, we just raped the whole machine.
5294113	5295314	I'd have a ton of fucking tickets.
5295434	5296194	I just got to tell you.
5296534	5297235	Outro Outro Outro
5314278	5314698	Don't trip.
5314718	5315539	Don't trip.
5339465	5340346	So, there's your drought.
5340666	5345691	So, yeah, if you want to call it non-drought by delaying games, yeah, sure, why not?
5345931	5346752	Let's play that way.
5347753	5359224	There are some confirmed, like, for example, Drive Club is supposed to be coming out in February and also confirmed the Xbox One version of Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare is going to be coming out.
5359424	5360044	Oh, there you go.
5361105	5361426	All right.
5362006	5362647	So, it's...
5363948	5365529	If you want to talk drought, look at January.
5365809	5370593	There is We Fit You and Dragon Ball Z Battle of Z. That's it.
5370673	5374136	You could look at January almost every year and it's the same story.
5374196	5374896	No, it's not.
5375176	5375437	Really?
5375457	5376257	This is ridiculous.
5376277	5380100	Well, I do remember one year... When did Bioshock Infinite come out this year?
5380140	5380741	It was pretty early.
5380781	5383723	And then sometimes you get the Final Fantasy 13-2.
5383743	5384924	13-2 was January.
5384984	5389147	And now Lightning Returns, I think, is February or March.
5389907	5390228	But that's...
5390868	5393969	It's very unusual to have two games only.
5394249	5395630	In December, it's also two games.
5395670	5397250	Gran Turismo 6 and then the Vita game.
5397750	5399051	But you were supposed to have the South Park game.
5399631	5400191	That didn't happen.
5400231	5401492	That would have only been three games.
5401652	5402772	A lot of the games left.
5403692	5408174	All right, let's talk about what's coming out now as we travel around the world and check out release dates.
5408494	5414316	Now, this was a pretty lengthy segment in previous weeks, but as Loki's indicating, it's going to start to dry up a little bit.
5414376	5416697	But let's see if there's anything for this week anyway.
5417057	5417317	Loki?
5417818	5418298	A little bit.
5418318	5421081	It's more like someone took a fucking ShamWow to this shit.
5423503	5427567	No, seriously, this week there's a whole lot of nothing.
5427787	5433252	It's basically Ys Memory of Celceta, which is going to be coming out on Vita.
5434753	5440258	One super late announcement, Air Conflicts Vietnam on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
5440298	5440358	And...
5444728	5446509	And I almost think that's it.
5447590	5448670	I'm trying to look here real quick.
5448950	5454854	I know there's that Frozen pack for Disney Infinity supposed to be coming out this week.
5455694	5456575	That was another one.
5457195	5458596	But yeah, it's sad.
5463058	5463938	God, is that it?
5464759	5465699	Atari Flashback 4.
5466659	5467239	That's coming out?
5467379	5467840	Oh, really?
5468080	5468260	Yeah.
5468460	5469700	What's cool about the Flashback 4?
5469740	5470400	What does that have in it?
5470420	5471161	Fuck if I know.
5471221	5472181	I want to know more about that.
5472221	5473481	Those consoles are pretty neat.
5473861	5474362	Let's see.
5474642	5475422	I love retro games.
5475442	5475822	What can I say?
5475842	5481984	Yeah, Disney Infinity, the Frozen toy box set in PowerDisc Pack 2 is going to be coming out now if you're into that shit.
5483866	5485168	Good Black Friday deals.
5485309	5486731	Oh, one very late one.
5486971	5493561	Halo Origins bundle, which is basically just a re-bundling of the Halo Anniversary and Halo Reach.
5494322	5496044	So that'll be coming out this week as well.
5497246	5497487	And...
5499912	5509443	Black Friday, I know there's a new PlayStation 3 skew for $1.99 that comes with The Last of Us and Batman Arkham Origins.
5510104	5510745	So that's pretty good.
5510985	5513348	Girls Fashion Shoot got delayed again, so that's on 3DS.
5515771	5516933	And that is literally it.
5517577	5521700	Alright, let's travel to Japan where things are a little more active this week.
5521761	5527185	On the PlayStation 3, you have Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag being released in Japan on November the 28th.
5527705	5531869	Also, Shin Sangoku Musou 7 Moshuden comes out this week.
5532650	5535772	There's a lot of different versions of that limited edition.
5535952	5537314	That's Dynasty Warriors, isn't it?
5537334	5537914	I think it is.
5537974	5539095	Koei did that one.
5539495	5541457	So that's a pretty big release out there.
5541837	5543439	Also, Himawari no Kyu...
5543959	5551244	Kyokai to Nagai Natsuyasumi Extra Vacation comes out this week, regular and limited edition.
5551284	5552525	That's, again, all PlayStation 3.
5553565	5558629	And Super Robot Taisen OG Infinite Battle comes out as well this week.
5558669	5560950	So pretty busy week on the PlayStation 3 in Japan.
5561391	5569096	Taking a look at the Xbox 360 in Japan, we have just Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag is it on the 360 in Japan.
5569176	5573699	So sounds like plenty more games coming out on the PlayStation 3 there, but that's kind of the norm.
5574640	5575680	on the PlayStation Vita.
5575800	5578422	Bitter Smile comes out this week in regular and limited edition.
5579143	5580844	Criminal Girls Invitation.
5582365	5583446	Invitation to what?
5584919	5585660	All sorts of criminal things.
5585680	5586801	That is the name of the game.
5586861	5588642	Criminal Girl Invitation.
5588722	5592325	And it's all these anime chicks in jail outfits.
5592345	5593346	This is cracking me up.
5593746	5595388	It's definitely some type of RPG.
5595648	5597269	I was going to say this is looking tactics-like.
5597309	5598710	It's got the whole hit points.
5598771	5599111	Not anymore.
5599131	5600152	It's not looking like tactics.
5600332	5601793	It's the hit points and magic points.
5601813	5603735	Is she spreading eagle in that shot?
5604755	5605995	This is for sick people.
5606816	5607996	I shouldn't say that.
5608376	5608756	All right.
5610616	5612217	Other releases in Japan.
5612277	5613537	Moving on beyond that.
5614437	5617938	Shin Sangoku Musou 7 comes out on the PlayStation Vita as well.
5618558	5624679	And White Album 2, Shiwase no Mukugawa comes out in Japan as well this week.
5625039	5628120	Pretty busy on the PlayStation Vita.
5629060	5643437	um looking at the Wii U quickly to see if there's anything this week uh Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag and Disney Infinity Toy Box Challenge I don't know if that's the initial release of Disney Infinity in Japan that's the 3DS one yeah no it's Wii U
5643937	5644338	Toy Box Challenge
5667920	5672947	A new orange and black 3DS XL and a turquoise and black 3DS XL, or as they call it over there, LL.
5673568	5675070	A couple other quick titles here.
5675791	5683301	Toriko, Ultimate Survival, Pretty Rhythm, Rainbow Live, Kirakira My Design, and Kamen Rider come out this week.
5683914	5686916	and a whole hell of a lot of system and game accessories.
5687176	5689377	Yes, but that's nothing new for Japan.
5689597	5691238	How about the UK, Jason?
5691479	5701865	Alright, well, unlike the Xbox One, Europe is just now getting its PlayStation 4 so the lineup that we've come to know is just stacking up for this week in Europe.
5702245	5719148	Angry Bird, Star Wars, Battlefield 4, Contrast, FIFA 14, Injustice Gods Among Us for both PlayStation 4 and Vita, Madden NFL 25, Need for Speed Rivals, Putty Squad, Super Motherload, the Pinball Arcade, and then Tiny Brains on the PlayStation 3.
5720910	5722292	Very quiet for the other systems.
5722352	5724674	Injustice Gods Among Us is, of course, cross-platform.
5724734	5730220	PS4, PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PS Vita as well, I think I already mentioned.
5730861	5732763	And there was one more.
5732943	5735967	I said Super Mario 3D World is coming to Wii U over there.
5736828	5738390	And that's pretty much it.
5739170	5740592	Definitely the PlayStation 4 week this week.
5743658	5747040	Alrighty, just a few more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.
5747920	5751281	Let's run through these quickly because we're running long Part A here.
5751321	5751682	So, Loki.
5751902	5754923	Alright, there's a brand new firmware for PlayStation 4.
5755343	5757164	System Update 1.51.
5757284	5769930	That's going to make some, I guess, minor refinements to the system UI and also, I guess, indicating when a user is downloading a game and a game patch at the same time.
5770791	5774795	And I guess... Wow, that's really it.
5775796	5776857	System stability.
5778219	5778900	Yay, patch!
5779340	5780582	As it goes, with new releases.
5783208	5785350	Yeah, it's nice though that they're coming out pretty quick.
5785970	5789033	That's pretty fast since the release of the system, so I guess that's kind of cool.
5789813	5794677	I wouldn't expect a major content right now, but good that they're at least fixing some things.
5796459	5808088	One other story here about Tomb Raider, and yes, there is a Tomb Raider sequel in development, and this is because Crystal Dynamics' senior art director Brian Horton was talking about this during a lecture yesterday.
5808448	5829324	and some a statement that is grabbing some headlines was the fact that it was well financed but let me let me bring some clarity to that statement here there was a European trademark registered for Tomb Raider Reflections could that be the sequel's title who knows but certainly when trademarks and people run wild with those but that could be it
5830845	5834829	Square has also confirmed that there's going to be a reveal in early December.
5835690	5837532	So possibly Spike TV.
5837652	5841075	This is one of the things that will be announced during the Video Game Awards there.
5841616	5850665	And then during the UK's Bradford Animation Festival, the aforementioned art director was taking some questions from the audience.
5851225	5871966	and he said in regards to the Tomb Raider sequel quote we've announced the sequel I'm glad I can finally talk about the Tomb Raider sequel is the next chapter of Laura's development her life is changing she can't go back to the way she was I seem to recall they did announce the sequel after there was the whole like there was the comic book that was being made and the comic book maker mentioned something so it kind of led to this but anyway
5873086	5873546	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5891795	5894817	We're not spending any more on a sequel than on the original game.
5921975	5928721	What they do with her now, because obviously the first one was all kinds of scary and really had that caves environment and all that.
5929001	5934045	So I'm curious, are they going to now do the whole exotic worlds and that?
5934225	5936247	Will that be the... She'll become a pirate.
5936367	5938529	It'll be just like Assassin's Creed 4.
5939049	5940551	Uncharted, Lara Croft edition.
5940751	5948937	Or will it still be super scary and the whole, as Jamie calls it on the show, the game called Girl.
5951115	5951996	Girl Girl Girl Girl Girl
5967628	5986982	Alright, let's get to the classic game of the week, because as you know, every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, we ask DarkSakura to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful brats, put down your Xbox One and your PlayStation 4 and Wii U's and go check out a real classic this week.
5987802	5989944	Yeah, definitely put that shit down.
5989964	5991145	You don't even need a reason to put that down.
5991505	5991765	DarkSakura.com
6016917	6017358	All right.
6017858	6020941	And I'm just going to warn people right off.
6022943	6025125	That is the noise with this game.
6025185	6027147	It uses like PC speaker, right?
6027167	6028569	And only PC speaker.
6028589	6029229	PC speaker.
6029289	6035015	So there's not a lot of music with this, and it's a lot of incidental break squeaks.
6035736	6039479	But I will, as I always do, let the music play in the background, whatever it is.
6039499	6039960	You didn't.
6040761	6046045	It is quite literally just break squeals and police sirens and yeah.
6046305	6050629	Anyways, developed by Sphere and published by Spectrum Hollowbyte.
6051169	6056634	First and foremost, I will say that this game is spelled V-E-T-T-E, VET as in short for Corvette.
6057575	6058556	With an exclamation point.
6058576	6059276	With an exclamation point.
6059296	6060017	Don't forget about that.
6060377	6064922	That is an incredibly early and incredibly crude racing simulation game.
6065002	6071889	It was originally released in 1989, coming out on IBM PCs running MS-DOS and Macintosh computers.
6072489	6073290	Thanks for watching!
6088723	6092205	This game is 100% a relic of times past.
6092825	6097547	When the game starts, you have to answer a question based off details in the instruction manual in order to play the game.
6110356	6124202	What's really fun about this game is that if you do, if you answer the question incorrectly, you get all the way to the start of the race and as soon as go is waved, a police siren is heard and you are arrested in game for driving a stolen vet.
6125842	6126302	That's funny.
6126322	6126762	That's creative.
6126782	6127142	I like that.
6129563	6134985	Can I just say quickly, though, it always blows me away how all these racing games are set in San Francisco, which I get to an extent.
6135025	6141647	You have the landmarks and the hills of San Francisco make it interesting and everything, but just as somebody who drives a lot in San Francisco,
6143147	6147711	Real racing in San Francisco is being stuck in traffic all fucking day.
6147791	6149552	You don't race in San Francisco.
6150113	6151194	There's too many cars.
6151234	6156077	You race to make it down five miles on the 101 in like 30 minutes when you're already late for your appointment.
6156318	6158319	And heaven help you if Bart is striking.
6160141	6162603	As I learned when I came into town last time.
6163163	6165025	Yes, 100% correct.
6166046	6167528	The core of the game, it is a racing game.
6167568	6174716	You pick one of four types of Corvettes, age appropriate, and choose one of four European sports cars as your opponent.
6174816	6182425	There are four key destinations to race, the fourth being a worldwide tour encompassing the three previous levels.
6183165	6194469	and despite the display of American Corvette dickwagging, the funnier part of this game is that if you lose to your opponent, one of the most often messages you get is, don't feel bad, I programmed this game.
6194869	6199010	So apparently the developers may have been more in love with the European sports cars than the Corvette.
6199090	6202531	I don't know, it's a very interesting mix of cultures there.
6203711	6208113	There are degrees of difficulty and realism on the easiest mode called Trainee.
6208213	6211574	There will be no car damage, police will not be a factor.
6212194	6217178	Uh, turns will be tight and cruise control will just be full speed at all times.
6217278	6223002	Even if you collide with something, you will instantly go back up to your cruise control speed when the object moves out of your way.
6223382	6228846	Yes, there are collisions, there are damage, there is realism to the extent you can call it for 1989.
6231047	6254304	as you increase in difficulty these various options will start becoming more and more realistic if you speed go down a wrong way go down a one-way street the wrong way oh hey look at that Bay Bridge or I assume that's the Golden Gate Bridge yeah run through red lights and police will start to pursue you you will get pulled over and you will even have to give your excuse to the officer before he writes you a citation
6254924	6256604	There is even manslaughter.
6256784	6265446	There are characters in the city of San Francisco that you can run into and they go from a standing crude sprite to a flattened crude sprite.
6266627	6269907	The pro difficulty level turns all of these on on full realism.
6270007	6273788	Damage, traction, police, and cruise control are all said to be realistic.
6274228	6275989	Pretty convincingly too, I will say.
6276009	6281290	Oh, and by the way, your opponent is immune to all of this and is damn fast.
6281330	6282630	He's incredibly frustrating.
6283050	6290160	This game was oodles of fun for me when I was, well, it came out when I was four, but I'm sure I was playing it more when I was five, six, or seven.
6290841	6299272	And despite how crude it is, there's just something colorful, fun, defined, and really, really incredibly interesting about this game.
6299412	6299712	Stunt Racing
6316408	6320450	Movie Stunts, where you go over the loop and all that shit.
6320610	6329295	That game looks like utter garbage now, but back in the day, we were plunking down a dollar because, dude, you could drive around a loop.
6330695	6331416	And we loved it.
6331476	6333177	And fail every single time.
6333317	6334537	In its VR realness.
6334557	6336258	Test drive 3, man.
6337419	6340360	So anyway, sorry, Jason.
6340420	6345323	This game is as zany as it is shockingly deep to the point that it can actually represent it.
6345783	6357596	If you don't want to race, there's also a tour mode which will immediately warp you to time period appropriate landmarks, the Coit Tower, the Ferry Building, Fisherman's Wharf, and the Piers, the Transamerica Pyramid, and of course, Lombard Street.
6357776	6360018	And all of its glory completely represented in this game.
6360879	6386982	The kicker of this game is that there's a lot of crude and silly elements, like for example, I'm staring at the video right now, and there's a gear, there's a shifter, there's the gear box, no, there's the shifter, with the character's hand on it, and the gear is represented by a little notch in, you know, one is top left, two is bottom left, et cetera, et cetera, but the hand never moves, there's just this little switch that goes through the image.
6388223	6390246	YouTube for VET, you'll see what I'm talking about.
6390426	6391968	Automatic or manual, you can do it both.
6393430	6401640	The kicker of all this game, and we were talking about this before with Atari and everything else, this game was less than one megabyte in size.
6402420	6407366	One single floppy disk for the whole of the Upper Peninsula.
6407987	6411630	And yeah, these objects are crude, but they're frickin' 3D standing objects.
6411930	6415613	This game actually does have terrain, so you actually go sloped roads.
6416053	6419755	The background images are cute, there's EGA dithering.
6419775	6422637	There were some serious polygons on that Golden Gate Bridge.
6422677	6423078	There are.
6423138	6428321	It's amazing the objects that they put together to make this game for less than one megabyte.
6429022	6430183	Completely astounding.
6431354	6432895	All right, there it is.
6433435	6438177	Look into racing games on the PCs passed with the classic game of the week, Vette.
6439118	6439858	All right, there it is.
6439958	6444480	That's Vette with an explanation point, not like, you know, my first pet vet.
6444560	6445640	Yeah, or something like that.
6445720	6447001	My first pet accident.
6447121	6448042	All right, there it is.
6449382	6450182	Thank you very much, Jason.
6450202	6450843	That was a good pick.
6450963	6451343	You know what?
6451403	6454444	Because I like hearing about games that I would have never looked up otherwise.
6454524	6457766	And considering that I did play a lot of old school games, I'd actually never heard of this game.
6458186	6460088	So you stumped me on that one.
6460128	6460708	Good job, Jason.
6461289	6461529	All right.
6461969	6465432	That does it for Part A, but we have plenty more show to come after a quick break.
6465752	6467694	We have rapid-fire news coming at you.
6467754	6470917	The Fugle Question of the Week, talking about sales and frugal gaming.
6471577	6473439	News about current racing games.
6473739	6477462	So going from a classic racer to things like Forza 5 and Gran Turismo 6.
6478183	6485109	Your emails, your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR and plenty more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6491929	6502138	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday night, November the 24th of 2013, with our 528th episode already in progress.
6502659	6504260	We've had a heck of a show so far tonight.
6504400	6504981	We have.
6505061	6506042	Jason's joining us here.
6506102	6509265	If you are just joining us live, DarkSakura out for the night.
6509305	6513789	She had a prior engagement, a family affair, as those things tend to happen this time of year.
6513809	6514089	Mm-hmm.
6514409	6523741	And real quickly, since Thanksgiving week is this coming week here in America, I just want to wish all of our listeners who are celebrating Thanksgiving this coming week, I want to wish you all a happy Thanksgiving.
6524622	6531210	And we here at Orange Launch Radio, as cheesy as it sounds, we really are thankful for all of you guys who take the time out of your day to listen.
6531590	6533733	Those of you that participate with the show here live on Sunday nights,
6534253	6544558	Those of you that listen via the podcast, those of you that leave comments at vognetwork.com, those of you that email, those of you that leave the kind reviews on iTunes and Stitcher and all that, we just really appreciate you guys.
6544658	6546098	Thank you for being a part of the community.
6546418	6547819	You are our motivation.
6548139	6549720	That is why we've been here for the past
6550460	6551440	God, how long has it been?
6551460	6552541	11 plus years at this point.
6552881	6553761	I have lost count.
6554161	6554961	It has hit that point.
6554981	6556961	I have lost count of how many episodes we've had.
6557021	6560962	But since June of 2002, we've been here at Orange Laundry.
6560982	6562042	We are thankful for you guys.
6562383	6563103	You keep us going.
6563423	6565143	So happy Thanksgiving to all you out there.
6565403	6579006	And if you aren't in America, you're Canadian or you're British or Australian or from another country that doesn't have Thanksgiving this week, then I will say enjoy your week making fun of us and our Black Friday mania and all that crap.
6579486	6602886	So enjoy your week making fun of us for all of that We deserve it, quite frankly But I'm hoping for some good deals come Cyber Monday I'm crossing my fingers and my toes Maybe I can get Diablo 3 on PlayStation 3 at a steel price on Cyber Monday Because I'm certainly not braving those crowds on Black Friday I will say this, I have gone out on Black Friday late at night And it's just like any other day
6603526	6629046	if you go at like 7 or 8 o'clock at night to Target or whatever it's just like any other day because all the crazies are done they went to bed all the TVs for 99 bucks or whatever crazy shit's going on they're all long since sold out so nobody's around for those anymore so Black Friday's not so bad in that regard which is good because sometimes I realize I need toothpaste and then oh shit I don't want to be anywhere near a store on Black Friday but there you go
6630247	6652988	I'm just hoping there's been enough pushback that stores don't make a habit of actually being open on Thanksgiving night like prior to midnight Friday's rough and the 4am starts and the midnight starts and all that kind of crap is rough but at least it's on Friday companies that have talked about being open on Thanksgiving night like 8pm or some nonsense like that
6653608	6659293	I seriously hope that that is not prolific and does not trend in future years.
6659513	6667700	Not to deviate too much from the topic of video games, but since a lot of video games are on sale during this special period, we'll go into this a little bit.
6667760	6669801	I do kind of understand both sides of it.
6670342	6672263	If the audience wasn't there for it, they wouldn't do it.
6673044	6676307	They do have to get the particular sales and all that.
6676447	6677868	I do to some extent...
6678328	6678928	Thanks for watching!
6699474	6726906	and that's that no no no no we do not get two days off of work to celebrate Black Friday and that's starting to be what it's becoming and that's the part that gets me more than anything is when we're starting to eclipse Thanksgiving and you know that's that's where things get a little little I don't like it for me but you know there's a lot of places that don't hospitals don't stop running on Thanksgiving so let's give thanks to those folks that you know work hard when the
6728140	6730461	and then deal with the trampling crazies the day afterwards.
6730521	6731021	Yeah, yeah.
6731241	6731662	No kidding.
6731962	6732662	I've had four hours.
6732682	6734363	That's what I'm talking about.
6734443	6736724	Not even 24 hours goes by before that stuff happens.
6736824	6737064	Yeah.
6737684	6738425	So, all right.
6739165	6739745	Let's move on.
6739805	6741466	Let's get back into some rapid fire news.
6741506	6743587	Get back to what the games are all about.
6743647	6743887	Loki.
6744187	6752569	Yes, so there was a lot of Persona announcements after a countdown, and it was funny, they had some videos that go along with it.
6753609	6765392	Trolling Persona fans, they had a video with this old woman that was announcing something, and they had a trailer in the background of it playing in Akihabara, and...
6766872	6771153	Persona 5 Announced for PS3 Winter 2014 Persona Q Shadow of the Labyrinth 3DS June 5th in Japan North America
6795699	6803361	Persona, or P4U, Persona 4, the Ultimax Ultra Suplex Hold on PS3.
6803441	6807043	That is going to be a follow-up to Persona 4 Arena.
6808283	6815465	And then there's Persona 4 Dancing All Night that's going to be coming to Vita.
6815925	6820107	And it's supposed to be a music game, a rhythm action game, I guess.
6820567	6821287	Oh, that should be fun.
6821767	6823369	Yes, and that's coming in autumn of 2014.
6823769	6827333	So lots of Persona for you.
6827533	6832759	Persona fans still not satisfied, even though that's probably like literally 5,000 hours of gameplay.
6833439	6835001	No, I'm teasing, obviously.
6835061	6836142	But no, that is exciting.
6837223	6852664	considering the lack of good games based on this franchise Game of Thrones is going to be getting a brand new series of games or at least a game from Telltale and that's pretty awesome
6853638	6855139	There's no way it will be less than one game.
6855239	6856761	This will be a series like everything else.
6857381	6859343	So I'm... I don't know.
6859363	6860244	I think it's pretty awesome.
6860304	6863386	Because I know they've had the strategy game, which is alright.
6863426	6868090	And then they had that Game of Thrones game that came out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
6868130	6868931	It was kind of lame.
6869411	6871633	But you can't go wrong with Telltale.
6872134	6873255	There's no way they can fuck that up.
6873355	6873475	So...
6873894	6882398	Well, I'm just going to say this, as much as I agree and Telltale's put out a lot of quality stuff, I'm a little sad that that King's Quest thing didn't happen.
6882618	6883919	That's a little irritating.
6884119	6889801	I was really looking forward to the Telltale King's Quest game, so the fact that that kind of didn't happen is sad.
6889861	6891662	But yay Game of Thrones, I guess.
6891862	6896044	I'm totally using this story as an excuse to bitch about King's Quest not happening.
6896064	6897505	I'm sorry, but I had to.
6898445	6901668	Well, I would think probably Activision's gonna be at fault there.
6902788	6905190	Because, you know, they're the ones that have the license, don't they?
6905210	6911155	Um, yeah, but, you know, fuck them.
6911175	6912076	What are they gonna do with it?
6912276	6914898	Treyarch, First Person Shooter, King's Quest.
6916199	6917780	I'd still play that, but yeah.
6918320	6918561	Arrgh.
6919922	6920262	No idea.
6920282	6922804	Um, and then, of course, um...
6926229	6930570	I guess it's sort of a surprise that John Carmack is leaving id Software.
6930590	6939474	I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that he's working with the Oculus folks as their chief technology officer.
6939754	6943676	I'm not sure what else he's doing, but he is resigning.
6946737	6949598	He's been at the company for 17 years, but it's too bad.
6951189	6952990	That seems short for some reason.
6954091	6954371	Was that?
6954391	6956733	17 puts it back to 1996.
6958274	6962277	But didn't... That was like after Doom and everything.
6962297	6964799	Wasn't he there for... I thought so too.
6964819	6966520	I think I'm just fucking up my ID software history.
6966781	6967061	Maybe.
6967779	6971440	My question is, so is that why Rage was on sale this weekend?
6974880	6977441	Your golden parachute is made up of the sales of this game.
6977681	6978861	Oculus Rift, though.
6979341	6980682	Jason, have you played Oculus Rift?
6981502	6982382	Oh, and I didn't mention that.
6984122	6996785	Since I got back into town, if I didn't mention this, I don't remember when I actually played it, so I may or may not have mentioned it last time I was on the show, but I've been wanting to get my hands on an Oculus Rift, but not out of my own pocket.
6997806	7007794	There is an Oculus Rift at the office owned by a co-worker of mine that leaves it there because he and a friend of his sometimes stay late and do, you know, hack on 3D projects and that kind of stuff.
7009055	7014080	I don't know if I have... Hack on 3D projects, play 3D pornography games, you know.
7014360	7016482	Well, play 3D games most definitely.
7017082	7017923	I won't doubt that one.
7018183	7018724	Anything else?
7018864	7021146	Well, that's a whole other discussion.
7021186	7022987	Just remember what the internet's for, Jason.
7023007	7023087	Yeah.
7024008	7026750	A for the awesome, A for the awesome
7043803	7045824	That game is fucking fantastic with the Oculus Rift.
7046344	7047564	Oh my dear sweet God.
7047624	7058867	I love that game just in general, but having, you know, there's contention about which display mode to use with the Oculus Rift, whether head tracking should be where you're aiming is.
7059028	7059608	I don't think so.
7059688	7060708	Other people do whatever.
7060748	7061728	That's what the choice is for.
7062248	7069411	But for, you know, the skydiving simulator in a freaking Oculus Rift, oh my God, that is so much fun.
7069871	7070591	Absolutely love it.
7073041	7073742	I've been, uh...
7093894	7107242	Two weeks ago, also, obviously still when I was in San Francisco, because that's where the Rift is, like I said, a couple of coworkers stayed late and one individual was demoing it to two other people.
7107602	7117288	And it was kind of funny because one of them didn't understand that it was head tracking and not like... She said afterwards that she thought it was like augmented reality or something like that, that she'd be able to see through.
7117708	7122851	So when somebody else is playing, she would go up and, hey, hey, wave on the other side of the Rift and we're like...
7123972	7149109	It doesn't work that way, she can't see you And then when she actually put it on, she still had that mentality And so she was doing the Italy house demo, if you saw just the basic FPS I did, I did And so there were like wispy things in the air, like the torches would let out those little quick flames I think she said butterflies and maybe even leaves, I actually kind of don't remember it myself
7149549	7161353	but she was walking around and she would, you know, she would wave her arm at him and she would flick, she would try to hit him and obviously nothing happened except for adjusted
7163035	7164236	Thank you for watching!
7188473	7189114	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7215493	7217835	other than game console with better specs.
7218316	7219857	That's fucking PC with better specs.
7219897	7220477	I mean, come on.
7221518	7223600	That is something that has a little bit more of a hook.
7223920	7228664	Interesting way to look at it.
7229225	7243257	All right, let's move on with some more rapid fire news, though, including here's another story about fucking Twitch, but it's about Minecraft, which that's a game that won't die in a community that won't die.
7243417	7243657	And with
7243697	7244177	and Oculus Support.
7269410	7272152	This was kind of outlined at MineCon recently.
7272512	7277016	But now in Minecraft, you do a quick visit to enable streaming in the account settings.
7277296	7278637	All you have to do, press F6.
7278837	7279318	There you go.
7279938	7283501	And if you need to walk through the features, that's available, of course, on YouTube.
7283521	7285723	Because, you know, people can stream and then archive to YouTube.
7286203	7286624	That's that.
7287024	7289346	So many more Minecraft streams to come.
7289666	7292489	The creators of Minecraft, very good about...
7293910	7300275	They do not try to enforce copyrights on any of their stuff on Twitch or YouTube or any of that.
7300295	7301877	They're like, go forth and mine.
7302237	7304279	It's just make all the Minecraft stuff you want.
7304319	7308603	And of course, Hunger Games, Minecraft, YouTubes, they're everywhere.
7309043	7309724	Those are huge.
7309824	7310404	They look fun.
7310664	7312806	I just never could find something to join in with.
7313547	7317230	I wish we could do one of those, but I know it's a lot of work.
7317611	7318832	They have a script for it, but...
7319707	7322489	I want to play Final Fantasy XIV and World of Warcraft.
7340462	7365368	and uh don't know if these are a limited time deal or what have you it costs 500 coins if you want these posters so there you go by the way you can also get a Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past for 150 coins uh for the Wii Virtual Console because it's not out on Wii U yet but I'm sure it will be before too long in fact I haven't looked at what Virtual Console games came out for Wii U recently but there was a lot of um let's just say scraping the bottom of the barrel
7366548	7370291	Some of the really old Nintendo launch titles that people don't care about anymore, like Clue Clueland.
7370691	7374134	Sorry, fans of Clue Clueland, but let's be real, no one care.
7374495	7377477	But that's been what some of the virtual console releases have been lately.
7379318	7382601	The next-gen console wars did continue in South Park.
7382741	7386444	We talked about this a little bit last week when the first half of South Park aired.
7386744	7390768	Well, sure enough, it was a two-part episode, and the second half did air this week.
7391508	7393910	It was the continued story of Black Friday...
7395171	7398292	A Song of Ass and Fire apparently was the name of the episodes.
7399072	7399592	Go figure.
7400132	7401052	And there you go.
7401212	7403492	They are dressed in a little bit of product placement.
7403513	7408753	The characters in South Park were dressed up like the characters in the RPG which is coming out now March of 2014.
7409133	7412114	A lot of people talking about the Princess Kenny anime intro.
7412614	7413314	I'm going to be honest.
7413554	7415135	I didn't watch this week's yet.
7415355	7416035	It's pretty funny.
7416195	7416935	I plum forgot.
7417615	7418995	Who won the console war in the end?
7419115	7419495	Spoilers.
7419655	7420235	I didn't watch it.
7420335	7422756	But I saw that sequence so I watched it on YouTube.
7423036	7423296	God damn.
7423476	7423796	Damn it.
7423816	7425098	Probably better we don't answer that for spoilers.
7425118	7425698	Yeah, I guess that's true.
7425738	7426299	For spoilers.
7426359	7428181	Some people are going to be like, your show spoils things.
7429562	7429882	All right.
7430263	7430783	Let's move on.
7430923	7431724	Jason, what do you have for us?
7432004	7432625	All right.
7433146	7436108	Polyphony Digital are attempting to do the impossible.
7437043	7437563	Thanks for watching!
7455652	7455932	We'll see.
7477019	7481621	Uh, three PS1 games are available for free on a PlayStation Home scavenger hunt.
7482041	7486183	It's a short little 13 hidden card minigame in home.
7486523	7497527	Shouldn't take you more than 10-20 minutes tops, but the games are Twisted Metal, Warhawk, and Destruction Derby, which are frickin' great titles to add to your collection, so why not?
7498707	7526165	and lastly Strider 2014 the reboot will also include the original version Strider 1 and 2 the PS1 versions rather not arcade or anything like that Strider 2014 is slated to be released on February 22nd will include the first two get your history on and enjoy these games oh I lied it's not just PlayStation 4 I'm crazy Strider 2014 is going to be on PC, Xbox 360 and Xbox One
7528208	7528948	When's that out?
7529768	7530348	I missed the date.
7530448	7530808	February 22.
7531029	7534169	Yay, there's something to look forward to in that early window.
7535429	7537310	I totally forgot one of the games I played this week.
7537330	7538410	I'll have to name it next week.
7538750	7539110	It's alright.
7540390	7542611	There was a download game I totally played earlier this week.
7542671	7545631	I spent like an entire night playing it and then it was like, oh, new games to play.
7546471	7547612	I do that way too much.
7547692	7550332	But I'll just say the download games really help bridge the gap.
7552312	7555113	Alrighty, let's get to the Fugo question of the week.
7556790	7562912	Every week here, we take Facebook and Google+, slam it together, you get FOOGLE!
7564753	7566174	Let's get to the question of the week.
7567554	7572056	And I will read some of the answers from Facebook and Google+, because we are running a little long tonight.
7572116	7572696	Sorry, guys.
7574697	7576658	Where the hell are the posts on Google+, I can't see them.
7577618	7578838	All right, fine, we'll go to Facebook first.
7580559	7583240	For some reason, my computer is running so slow, too.
7583260	7584821	I'm sorry if it's causing the feed to skip.
7587159	7590680	Also, all the account madness that we did earlier today may have been a factor in this.
7590920	7591841	That very well could be.
7591861	7592181	Who knows?
7592961	7594482	Well, I had to get the YouTube channel back.
7594522	7595962	We haven't posted to it for like four years.
7596363	7596603	All right.
7596623	7597903	Anyway, here we go.
7597983	7598804	The Fugle Question of the Week.
7598884	7599664	Brace yourselves.
7599724	7601304	Holiday shopping season is coming.
7602125	7606607	Are there any holiday gaming deals you plan to pick up over the next few weeks?
7607107	7612549	Do you typically wait for games to go on sale before buying them, or does the desire to play them right away usually win out?
7613149	7615731	So let's go to some of the answers from Facebook.
7615831	7617873	RedTheHaze says, For the Fallen Dreams says, America!
7638600	7653925	Andy R says the desire to play right away wins out almost all the time that and pre-order bonuses stupid as they sometimes are I'll probably still take a look at the deals coming up but buying a Playstation 4 last week and a 3DS a couple months ago means I'm holding off on spending too much at the moment
7654905	7656707	Um, let's see.
7656947	7663574	Daniel S says, there aren't any specific games I want to buy per se, but if they're a really good deal on something, I'll snatch it up.
7663914	7670080	Those are usually Steam sales, but outlets have been known to clear their inventory of large, large collector's edition boxes.
7670440	7671301	Ooh, that's really true.
7672222	7676246	Um, DJ Synthetic says, I'm just hoping for a purple 3DS bundle type thing.
7676586	7679248	I need to start playing something not Call of Duty Ghosts.
7680129	7684173	and DJ Ranma S says GameStop has some sweet deals I plan to pick up.
7684513	7689658	I do try to wait for games to go on sale but on the same token I'm in no rush to play a lot of the games that are coming out.
7689959	7691700	So by the time I get that game it's usually under $30.
7691740	7691860	Score!
7694031	7698034	Alright, now going over to Google+, now that it's loaded, let's look at just a few comments over there.
7698794	7707141	Actdeft says, I already jumped the gun on getting a Zelda Wind Waker Wii U on the Mexican version of Black Friday, which is El Buen Fin, or The Great Weekend.
7707701	7708802	I did not know that was a thing.
7709382	7711264	I learned something tonight.
7711284	7718389	Tech2030 says, Even though I just bought a PlayStation 4, if there is a killer Black Friday deal for a Wii U, I'll probably pull the trigger on that one.
7718789	7722672	It's killing me that I'm not playing Super Mario 3D World and Wind Waker HD already.
7723393	7731690	and lastly Sam H says Xbox Live and PlayStation Plus 12 month sub cards for 30 bucks at GameStop that's right Rob I'm going to GameStop
7732594	7733514	Well, you know what?
7733555	7735215	I can't really blame you for that, Sam, though.
7735235	7736236	That's a pretty good deal.
7736756	7741218	Even I want to go get the PlayStation Plus card at that rate because it's a really good deal.
7741939	7745180	Those are some of the answers from our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.
7745480	7747922	By all means, please go read the rest of them.
7747982	7754045	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.
7755145	7755886	How about you guys?
7756186	7763632	I think we might have dabbled into this a little bit, but do you have any Black Friday, Cyber Monday deals you guys are looking into?
7763732	7768096	I already mentioned Diablo 3 is something I want to grab if I can get it dirt cheap.
7768116	7770438	I'm not paying $60 for a game I already have for free.
7771038	7773961	But for the console version, yeah, I'm tempted.
7774641	7774921	Jason?
7774941	7775742	Jason?
7776242	7778324	No, unless there's something on Steam that I have to have, which
7806158	7808359	I say there probably isn't going to be, but you never know.
7808419	7809219	There always will be.
7809559	7812360	There's some indie title that wasn't on your radar that will be eventually.
7813480	7815520	Spelunkies, I know one I really want to get.
7816821	7819762	I'm sure the minute that goes on a deep steam sale, it'll be mine.
7820782	7822382	I forgot about steam sales, Jason.
7822402	7822762	You're right.
7822922	7824183	That's going to hurt.
7824483	7825263	It's going to hurt this year.
7826277	7827578	You already said it once in this episode.
7827818	7828519	Winter is coming.
7828659	7829559	I can only mean one thing.
7829579	7830100	That's right.
7830160	7830700	Steam sale.
7831521	7831861	All right.
7832301	7839507	I still haven't even picked up, like, Bioshock Infinite, even though they had it for, like, $11 for, like, you know, all three games.
7839747	7841368	Bioshock 1, 2, and Infinite.
7841468	7842529	Ooh, I gotta get that, too.
7843250	7843830	That's a good point.
7844130	7846212	So it'll be, like, five bucks by the time.
7847193	7847453	All right.
7847813	7852697	Let's move on with some other news, and then we'll get to the mailbag, the FU's of the week, and all that other good stuff.
7852737	7853017	Loki.
7853037	7853117	Loki.
7853866	7864480	Forza 5 Forza 5, as people realize once they purchase the game, has a bit of a monetization business model to it.
7865941	7868284	Granted, you can play the game and unlock stuff.
7869525	7896057	or you can buy some tokens and the tokens um they cost their price email for the tokens is really stupid actually because they have different bundles you can get and you're you know you usually think oh I'm buying more so I get a better deal on it it's actually the opposite if you buy less you get better deal on it um but they have um I guess they were talking about different cars and stuff for example if you were to buy like um
7898491	7900533	The McLaren or something like that, the P1.
7901353	7905396	The cost of that, the token pack, they're saying, well, this is all in euros, of course.
7905977	7912121	So they're saying $15.99 would be, I guess it would cover both of those cars.
7914042	7916664	$100 is like $79 euro.
7917264	7918525	I don't know what that is over here.
7918545	7919146	I think it's like $0.89 over here.
7919166	7919346	$79 euros is $107. $107.
7925421	7929363	I'm sorry, 0.79 euros, not 79 euros.
7929423	7929703	Yeah, $1.
7930463	7932384	So about a dollar.
7934525	7941807	Basically, I think they did the same thing with Real Driving 3 when that came out or something, where they added it all together.
7941947	7943048	I want to say it was like $2,200 is what they...
7947309	7955613	Token costs in the US 100 tokens runs you 99 cents If you want 325 tokens, it's going to run you $5 Yes, you heard correctly 325 tokens is $5 Whereas if I spent $5 on the 100 tokens, I get 500 tokens Because that makes fucking sense
7969588	7973531	Thanks for letting me bundle easily, guys.
7973911	7974071	$5.75 is $10.
7974912	7977594	Let me throw this out there because the chat's being a little adamant about this point.
7977914	7981817	Actdeft and chat at live.vognetwork.com First, I love this.
7981877	7986400	Blackwolf at live.vognetwork.com says, The monetization ain't as bad as whatever Loki's about to say.
7987701	7993087	and then Actdeft said monetization as in buying tokens and credits, those exist since Forza 3.
7993868	7997752	I seriously don't know why people are making a big fuzz about this monetization thing.
7999113	8004339	I do think in some extent it is an opportunity for people to pounce on a new system and
8004879	8007020	Oh my god, this is the route we're going down.
8007040	8015364	I think it's because this game has half the cars that the last game had is more like it, and that they're offering... Oh, you can get more cars in DLC.
8015605	8030412	Yes, I understand that's because the cars are modeled in higher resolution or whatever excuse they want to use, but it's a little shady when you're buying a system for $500, and then you're buying a game for $60, and then they are saying...
8030652	8031233	Hey, you know what?
8031253	8034575	You can also buy some cars too if you want to spend another $100 on them.
8034816	8044403	I kind of think that's where it's at is that people have hit their saturation point with seeing the freemium model in the premium games.
8045044	8055353	And I kind of just think the reason why this is all catching fire and you're seeing it, it's not like we're the first ones to get out there and make it sound like it's all new because there's a lot of gaming blogs that are running this like it's...
8056213	8062960	Xbox One Poison I don't have a problem with it being on this game I have a problem with it being on any game that you're paying retail price for If it's a free to play game
8075393	8076634	Okay, fine.
8077374	8079175	That's fine, because they've got to make their money somehow.
8079255	8085077	But you've already made your money selling me this game, and now you're saying, oh, well, we need more money.
8085357	8088839	Like, for example, they were saying, though, that, I guess...
8091303	8095267	One of the cars was like $100.
8097549	8103815	Lotus E21 is 6 million credits or 10,000 tokens.
8104676	8113484	So yes, 10,000 tokens would be $100 in real money if you wanted to just buy the car and not play the game to unlock those tokens or credits.
8115418	8115999	That's kind of lame.
8116259	8116820	I mean, fuck.
8116960	8122306	I thought it was kind of lame in Forza Horizon where they had this shit you could unlock for tokens.
8122866	8123087	Yeah.
8123547	8126230	So I think it's lame everywhere.
8126671	8127331	And come on.
8128152	8129013	This is ridiculous.
8129113	8130775	There's no excuse that this needs to be in there.
8131116	8135761	And I hate when the developers or publishers go, but the people wanted it.
8137338	8138779	It's like, no one fucking wants it.
8138799	8142602	Yeah, I remember a day when UpUpDownDown, LeftRightLeftRightBA, Stark gave me all that shit.
8142962	8143903	So, you know.
8144343	8150848	But I will say, at least in the case of Forza Horizon, I still love that game an awful lot.
8150948	8157313	So it's not like this ruins the game, per se, and I haven't played Forza 5, so I can't speak to it, but I have played Forza Horizon a lot.
8158014	8165079	It didn't ruin the game, per se, but it's just one of those things where you kind of, you just, it's a disappointing sigh, I guess is really the only way I can phrase it.
8166383	8166623	Anyway.
8167464	8167724	All right.
8169224	8169825	Let's move on.
8169885	8175728	By the way, if you think this is specific to Xbox and Forza, you would be incorrect.
8176208	8176588	Why?
8176888	8185373	Because Gran Turismo 6 on the PlayStation 3, not 4, 3, will also have a system for in-game microtransactions.
8185413	8190035	So again, this isn't something you can really pick on Forza specifically.
8190395	8193537	This is just people starting to kind of hit their point where, you know...
8193977	8194558	I've had it!
8194678	8195278	Officially!
8195819	8196259	With these.
8196780	8201545	So, uh, purchasable as credits from PlayStation Network and physical retailers.
8201565	8205508	You can get in-game credits to get vehicles, parts, and related accessories.
8206329	8213136	Uh, we don't know exactly how much this is gonna be in the game and so forth, but it sounds like almost the exact same model that you see in Forza...
8213596	8221578	also in Gran Turismo 6 which will be launching early December so you can see for yourself exactly if there's $100 cars to buy in this game as well.
8221598	8240864	It's stupid that people even allow and unfortunately you're buying these games because they're good racing games but at the same time they're not putting I mean I guess the best advice you could say is just don't buy these but I'm sure to some extent people are going to buy some of them because they want oh you know maybe not necessarily $100 for a car but you know maybe they want just
8241965	8257360	extra money or something I don't know they have it in Grand Theft Auto Grand Theft Auto 5 has where you can pay to get money online and they keep nerfing all the fucking payouts on everything so trying to convince people to spend money on that
8258306	8262390	DarkTetsuya in chat says, I'd assume in Gran Turismo you can still earn credits the old-fashioned way.
8263371	8264932	I'm also assuming that to be the case.
8264992	8268815	It's almost identical to what we just talked about with Forza 5, it seems.
8269116	8275641	So how long is it that we're going to get that fucking energy meter for, you know, these games where, oh, my driver's tired now.
8275722	8280526	He can't drive anymore, you know, for today because... In this case, it'll be a gas tank.
8280886	8285190	Some Mountain Dew, you know, because they're going to have the product tie-in in there as well, and...
8285458	8286299	Thanks for watching!
8306579	8309021	Jason, maybe you have some better news in the racing game world?
8309141	8315227	Wrapping up our trifecta of racing, Mario Kart Arcade Grand Prix Deluxe is confirmed for US release.
8316168	8328599	It's been in Japan since the summer of this year, and it will make its way to North America, well, rather just outside Japan, winter 2013, so imminently in the next month for arcades that are actually going to make the investment.
8329479	8335925	It was also showcased at IAAPA as was re-raved that we mentioned earlier in the show.
8336505	8346173	A little bit of technical discussion about the fact that it can retrofit in existing cabinets, reuse Dead Heat, I believe it was called.
8346233	8348275	Dead Heat Riders motorcycle game.
8349195	8354319	Cute trailer video that also includes the Taiko Drum character from Taiko Natasajin.
8355080	8361307	Other various bits about what it's going to be powered by as far as the system internal.
8361928	8376685	The really, really weird part about this article is that the author wrote this saying, One thing we are also sure about is that this is not the same game as what Nintendo will be releasing for Wii U later that they are calling Mario Kart 8.
8378325	8385331	I remember back in the day when you would have Crystal Castles in the arcade, Crystal Castles on the 2600.
8395298	8397460	It's technically supposed to be a port of the arcade game.
8397940	8401282	It's not uncommon to think that home versions of games are ports of the arcade game.
8401543	8404324	So I can see why they're like, this is different than Mario Kart 8.
8404444	8407787	In large part, we are so far removed from that.
8408107	8417193	I don't know, it just struck me in the realization that these games are that different, that the Mario Kart arcade experience is that distinct.
8417793	8424318	But it's just like, minus music games, what else has been similar console and arcade?
8425218	8429620	Time Crisis doesn't really exist in the console space anymore so far as I know.
8430000	8432201	Sadly, it's because the arcades are dying out.
8432301	8434121	It's, what, Super Street Fighter?
8434542	8438403	But that's where the arcade game was almost based off the console.
8438523	8439964	I guess the answer to this question is...
8441204	8448909	and Hydro Thunder and H2 Overdrive and that kind of stuff that did show up on the Xbox 360 Marketplace, Xbox Live Arcade Marketplace rather.
8449070	8454773	Or a game I talked about a couple weeks ago on the show, Midway Arcade Origins, which is actual arcade ports of the emulators.
8455114	8457195	From two decades ago, sure.
8457675	8462619	Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, the new arcade Mario Kart has Taiko Drum as a character.
8462659	8463359	I want to play that.
8463399	8464000	That sounds awesome.
8464020	8464440	I said that.
8465140	8465881	I said it was in the trailer.
8466314	8466914	It's very cute.
8466954	8467955	It's very awesome to see.
8469036	8476220	This Nintendo Namco mutual happiness is really, really worthwhile.
8476700	8479862	DarkTetsuya says, I played the first Mario Kart arcade game and it was fun.
8479902	8481143	Would love to play the third one.
8481783	8484645	I actually did too when I was in Arizona.
8485426	8490308	Mesa Golf Land has... Don't get it at Golf Land, whoopee.
8490429	8491869	I believe it was Grand Prix 1.
8491929	8492590	It was very old.
8492610	8494111	The cameras were shot to hell.
8494191	8495712	The display was a little dim.
8496392	8498495	And it was also very, very easy, which was kind of weird.
8498655	8506204	But yeah, for being completely original gameplay mechanics, Mario Kart Grand Prix Arcade is quite fun.
8506244	8508447	If you happen to come across it, definitely check it out.
8510293	8511074	Alright, let's move on.
8511214	8511454	Loki.
8512114	8515856	It's also great for when you're drunk during your bachelor party.
8516737	8518978	Is that one of the YouTubes on the Originals Radio account?
8518998	8519318	I think it is.
8519379	8520099	I think it's still there.
8520559	8522901	I think that one still gets views.
8522941	8524622	I should make ad money off that.
8524642	8525042	You should.
8525502	8526343	I get a portion though.
8527424	8527824	We'll see.
8528224	8529205	The show still runs.
8529265	8529926	That's your portion.
8532829	8536272	Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about NCAA again.
8537273	8545421	Oh my god, speaking of a publisher that's really having a karma sink or whatever, EA, holy shit.
8546182	8548864	First, losing the NCAA...
8550846	8551106	Game.
8551627	8562292	Now, uh, NBA Live, you know, that game has been, you know, waiting to come out for years now, and they retooled it, retooled it, and the reviews have been fucking terrible.
8562713	8564133	It just looks terrible.
8566135	8568376	Ah, they gotta be hurting over EDA Sports.
8568416	8574099	But anyways, NCAA, um, they have sued EA now over the Lightness settlement.
8574959	8577821	And, um, you know, I guess, uh,
8580168	8590896	with the $40 million settlement that was going, I guess, to students or student-athletes like this is in their legal dispute going back all the way to 2009.
8591197	8600644	And, of course, this is, I guess, regarding they've not renewed the license.
8601004	8605187	I think they're trying to put it out now as some sort of EA Sports college football or something like that.
8607269	8607589	Excuse me.
8608650	8619581	They're saying the Collegiate Licensing Company, the CLC, is caught in the middle of a dispute between NCAA and EA, which should not involve us.
8620041	8623525	And the CLC has valued the relationship with both NCAA and EA.
8624125	8629891	While we hope that they can soon resolve their dispute, we see no reason for the CLC to be involved.
8630111	8631893	And, of course, EA has declined...
8632513	8639778	A sort of comments regarding the CELC being involved in this lawsuit in the first place.
8639818	8646702	So either way, it doesn't look like the NCAA is going to be coming back for a college football game next year.
8649024	8653006	That's too bad because that was one of the only good titles in the month of July.
8653307	8654788	Now, I guess it's going to be Persona.
8655168	8655768	Lots of Persona.
8656469	8658010	Persona all year long.
8659150	8659711	Your Persona.
8661283	8661864	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8679078	8683039	I believe they are already out in Japan or about to come out right before the end of the year.
8683279	8684179	December or something, right?
8684520	8685740	Well, we're getting them in March 2014.
8687180	8690381	Specifically March 18th, 2014 is when North America gets it.
8690781	8692702	Europe gets it on March 21st.
8693142	8696123	Now that is the PlayStation 3 versions of the remaster.
8696483	8697783	If you're looking to the Vita version...
8698325	8700027	Well, there's been no announcement on that.
8700648	8708198	And a press release from Square Enix Europe said, quote, full details of the PlayStation Vita version and release timing will be revealed at a future date.
8708879	8709760	Hmm.
8711022	8711543	Hmm.
8712624	8713225	Well, we'll see.
8714787	8715267	We'll see.
8715607	8716127	Poor Vita.
8717108	8719868	You know, it would have been great for the Vita if the Vita version came out first.
8720408	8724269	That would have been really good for the Vita, but oh well, I guess I shouldn't encourage that.
8724289	8726470	Does the Vita have a fully fledged Final Fantasy yet?
8727090	8727530	No, it wouldn't.
8727790	8729550	13 predated it by a long shot.
8729650	8741373	Yeah, no, Vita doesn't really have anything Final Fantasy per se, unless you'd want to count PSP games that you can play on Vita, like Tactics was a PlayStation Plus title at one point, and there's plenty of PS1 games.
8741846	8764433	I still have the physical disc, the UMD of that alright, let's get to the mailbag every week you guys email us at mailbag at orange launch radio dot com and usually DarkSakura jumps in the mailbag both are applicable well if she sees things she doesn't like she might but no, she jumps in the mailbag head first but since she's not here tonight I will get the hazmat suit on and jump into the mailbag for you
8765253	8793780	just two emails tonight to read here and the first one comes to us from a person who said please don't read my name so fine I will not so Anonymous writes us and says why I am getting an Xbox One instead of PlayStation 4 the Xbox One is better the Xbox doesn't require you to pay for a $5 a month PlayStation Plus membership for online multiplayer the PlayStation 4 however does require a $5 a month PlayStation Plus membership for online multiplayer
8794878	8800603	The Xbox One version of Assassin's Creed, the Xbox One version of Watch Dogs.
8820720	8821501	I can't argue with that.
8821521	8822122	That's solid.
8822302	8823182	That is a solid argument.
8823202	8825324	That is some NeoGAF logic right there.
8825444	8827245	Good job, anonymous emailer.
8827886	8828506	Good job.
8830087	8836172	I'm having one of those moments where it's like, not sure if troll or... You know, you laugh about that.
8836592	8839815	But like over this week, I've been actually, I've had some downtime at work.
8839855	8842677	So I've been going through the Microsoft retail training program.
8843037	8845579	In fact, I've been actually giving away some DLC codes I got from the...
8847420	8848942	But holy shit, man.
8849122	8852605	That is some of their arguments for the Xbox One.
8852865	8854147	Hey, you can play used games on it.
8854527	8857510	I'm like, yeah, cool.
8858991	8863575	All those games that have just sat around for years and years and I don't really feel like bringing them out again.
8863595	8865037	You know what would have really been news?
8865517	8868400	You can play all your last generation games on it as well.
8868480	8869661	It's backwards compatible.
8870682	8871162	I'm telling you.
8872103	8878665	From people I know that are more casual gamers, like they like gaming, but they don't seek out shows like this or post to internet websites and things like that.
8879245	8884106	That's the number one bitch I hear is that, well, I don't want to get a PlayStation 4 if it's not going to play PlayStation 3 games.
8884766	8887287	Or, well, does the new Xbox play the other Xbox game?
8887347	8887927	Why not?
8888927	8890828	I hear that more than anything else.
8891528	8892608	I understand why.
8893248	8898750	You probably understand why because of all the graphic chips upgrades and the parts inside that have changed where that's not possible.
8899070	8900010	But I'm just telling you,
8902188	8910033	The general public doesn't give a fuck because there's been other consoles that were backwards compatible that kind of instilled that in us.
8910333	8911653	The Wii played the GameCube games.
8911693	8913034	The Wii U plays the Wii games.
8913054	8915455	The Game Boys are usually backwards compatible and so forth.
8915475	8918537	And even Xbox 360 played some Xbox games.
8918617	8921659	PlayStation 3s, when they were new, would play PlayStation 2 games.
8921939	8924900	PS2 did play PS1 games.
8924921	8925441	Yeah, exactly.
8925521	8927462	So there were some consoles in the past that kind of did that.
8927862	8940677	So I'm just saying the funny thing is that those consoles are the minority and especially like Nintendo history up until the Wii had no backwards compatibility console wise because they didn't fit in slots anymore.
8941418	8945223	And not to mention that shift from, you know, cartridge to disk just in general.
8946624	8948305	Yeah, same experience here.
8948425	8951427	I went out to brunch, lunch, something with a friend of mine.
8951687	8958531	And that was one of the very first things out of his mouth is that the PlayStation 4 isn't... And this was before I knew about the architecture switch.
8959091	8963954	And he said, yeah, I hate Sony now because they're not playing all the games that I already own.
8964455	8964675	I said...
8964975	8967778	That's very strange, especially not even digital versions.
8968579	8972063	As soon as I figured out why that's the case, it all made sense.
8972744	8973685	Same argument you just made.
8974286	8975668	Had another point, slipped my mind.
8976048	8976569	You know how it goes.
8977000	8977260	All right.
8978061	8979262	Well, we have another email here.
8979323	8980564	It's from RossDealUT.
8982125	8984048	RossDeal has a tendency to send the show novels.
8984548	8988973	RossDeal, I'm going to invite you to post this on our forums in its entirety because it's a little bit long.
8988993	8992056	Hey, I'm all about where every gamer has a voice, but it is still a three-hour show.
8992136	8993838	So this is quite the little novel here.
8993858	8996961	I'm going to try to get the gist of it here, but I'm going to be extremely paraphrasing.
8996981	8998283	Or if you do that, remember TLDL.
8999884	9000705	and TLDR.
9001065	9003407	Yeah, bullet points are great.
9003787	9006369	Like that last email was a bunch of bullet points, right?
9006770	9010272	No, I don't want to... It's not that the email is bad.
9010373	9012094	It's just I only have a certain amount of time.
9012114	9014596	But the more I talk about the time frames, the longer we drag things out.
9014616	9016778	So let me read a portion of this email here from RossDLUT.
9017478	9022601	who basically was emailing us to talk about who won the last console generation.
9022641	9026903	He talked about that there were a few things that he kind of, you know, a few points he wanted to make about this.
9026963	9031365	And first off was, I learned the most popular system may not fit your particular needs.
9031726	9035928	While the Wii sold like absolute gangbusters, the games were stupidly few and far between.
9036208	9043312	And while I don't speak for anyone else, I found myself fighting against the controls in games like Super Mario Galaxy where I should have been having a stupendous time.
9044832	9047494	Secondly, I gave up AAA PC gaming.
9047794	9055880	This was the generation where it became 100% impossible to buy a PC game that didn't require an online authentication or other form of invasive DRM.
9056320	9070029	I won't bring myself so low as to pirate games, but between Steam's offline mode failing me numerous times and the PlayStation Network outage, I don't feel like any of the stuff I buy on a DRM platform is actually mine, so I abandoned those libraries and counted the loss as a lesson learned.
9071090	9074012	I learned not to trust one iota of what I'm told in the gaming media.
9074392	9075593	This show accepted, of course.
9076354	9080559	I don't really consider ourselves gaming media, because we're not trying to break news.
9081139	9083582	We're just trying to talk about it.
9083882	9087826	But I also hate the term gaming enthusiast, because some news doesn't make us enthusiastic.
9087866	9089668	We're just gaming talkers.
9090749	9090989	Outro Music
9108139	9122996	he says in his email here this generation we saw gaming journalism degrade into the worst state it's been in since the crash of 83 reviews are made based on how big a franchise is not to appease publishers but to keep the fanboys off their asses um
9123576	9143032	I learned to love Killzone was something he said the franchise started office and also ran on the PlayStation 2 a laughable attempt at a Halo killer however the ensuing games have shown remarkable improvement both in gameplay and storytelling and it's been an absolute pleasure to see the progress Guerrilla Games has made let's see um
9145394	9146415	P.S.
9146595	9149857	You guys were wondering about what made a cult game.
9150278	9157923	I like to think of it in the same way as a cult movie, where it doesn't have a huge mainstream success, but instead finds a smaller, more dedicated, and enduring fanbase.
9158323	9167290	Showgirls and Rocky Horror may not have made a lot of money at the box office, but they'll likely be remembered long after people have forgotten about the latest superhero fad movie.
9168090	9170612	and PPS, the most important part of the entire email.
9170632	9170892	You ready?
9171332	9171893	PPS.
9172433	9173074	Really, Loki?
9173454	9176096	You gotta up your game when it comes to parody porn names.
9176916	9180098	Here's some you can use next time the topic comes up on the house.
9180959	9182460	The Dark Knight Hardens.
9183721	9185002	Shaving Private Ryan.
9185472	9186932	I don't even remember what the hell this was in reference to.
9187012	9191034	The Shawskank Redemption or the Cock of Steel.
9192314	9193894	We were talking about porn on the last show.
9193934	9194775	I'm sure we were.
9194835	9195655	It was OLR.
9195715	9196675	We were talking about porn.
9197195	9197715	It happens.
9198115	9198596	There you go.
9199076	9199296	All right.
9199336	9200376	Thank you, RawSteelUT.
9200436	9205758	Sorry I had to edit, but we got to keep things moving here because the show is already running long.
9205858	9210759	If you want to email us some thoughts, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to do so.
9211239	9214040	You can also send us a tweet, twitter.com slash OLR.
9214660	9216602	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
9217022	9217382	Why?
9217923	9222266	Because we're mad and stuff and we're not gonna take it anymore.
9239017	9240458	Jason, would you like to start us off tonight?
9241238	9242098	I shall.
9242478	9247921	F you to traffic, F you to parking, F you to critical mass.
9248361	9261526	I mean, I love the human ingenuity and the things that, especially in San Francisco and Manhattan and any other completely over-full-to-the-brim location, what they have to deal with.
9261666	9264207	God bless people's ingenuity and the way that they make things work.
9265047	9266547	God damn, fuck Critical Mass.
9266968	9269268	That stuff's just frustrating.
9269288	9270008	Yeah, that's it.
9271989	9272389	Uh, Loki.
9273629	9275950	Um, F you the cookie clicker.
9276850	9278070	I don't know why I'm still playing this.
9278350	9278710	Amen.
9280091	9285192	Uh, my F you of the week goes to my scale, because it told me something I didn't want to hear yesterday.
9286152	9287112	I'm very angry at it.
9288012	9289913	Um, so also F you to the, uh,
9290273	9291014	We'll see you next time.
9302836	9308160	Alright, let's get back into a few more gaming news stories and Twitter topics and Skype line and all that good stuff.
9308180	9311783	1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9312043	9313744	But first, a couple more quick stories.
9313784	9314004	Loki.
9314104	9317787	You know, you could just pick up one of those Wii Fit meters and then you could download Wii Fit U for free.
9317887	9322931	I know, and I could get the balance board out from under the TV, but Loki, it's so hard.
9325858	9326158	Cablebox
9338530	9339431	Don't you have a story to read?
9341172	9344774	Today I've walked 7,500 miles and three and a half.
9345675	9348096	Wow, not that many miles.
9348116	9350938	7,500 steps and three and a half miles.
9351158	9352139	What is that, a Fitbit?
9352840	9353520	You've got a Fitbit?
9353760	9354301	Do you like that?
9354621	9356302	I really do.
9356402	9357863	Does it actually get you to walk more though?
9357883	9360985	Because I could get a Fitbit and be like, hey, look how much I walked today.
9361325	9361705	But like...
9362506	9363407	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9385720	9393749	Maybe not bragging rights, but I was actually just commenting on something of our good old buddy BigRedPim's post a couple days ago.
9393849	9397032	He's on a fitness kick right now, and he's already lighter than me.
9397193	9401758	He started a couple months ago, he's already lighter than me, and I need to really do the same.
9402598	9406403	But he's been the top of the Fitbit leaderboards for weeks now, and it's...
9407143	9409304	So there are Fitbit leaderboards?
9409444	9410664	Yes, absolutely.
9411964	9416686	I'm in my employer's group as well as I have my selection of friends.
9416846	9418326	So there is EPing to it?
9418366	9420266	There is EPing to it.
9420326	9425768	There are badges, there are goals, there is a good combination of everything to increase the...
9426568	9427950	Lower the barrier to entry.
9428070	9431594	Raise the motivation enough that you might actually get off your lazy ass and do it.
9431714	9432535	How much is a Fitbit?
9433295	9434617	Ranges from $70 to $120.
9434657	9436138	There's a couple different models.
9436158	9436138	$70?
9436238	9436419	What?
9440399	9441240	Laura, that's a lot of money.
9441300	9442041	That's a lot of money.
9442401	9445004	That's a lot of money for bragging rights about I walked more than you.
9445965	9449809	Then again, not getting thinner, just sitting here doing a radio show.
9449829	9453112	I would say just use your DS, but that unfortunately doesn't, that negates Fitbit at all.
9453152	9454153	It's fucking snacking too.
9454233	9455695	Snacking is my worst enemy.
9455795	9457737	Should I slap you when you go up to go get some more of them?
9457797	9458758	No, because I'm hungry.
9459399	9461541	Me too, but I'm not going to eat until freaking midnight.
9461801	9462462	Anyways, Loki.
9462482	9463263	Do you want some pretzels?
9464003	9465164	and Loki.
9465844	9469806	Alright, so the inevitable has happened.
9470546	9480731	They're going to bundle a Vita with a PlayStation 4 and sell it in the UK for an undetermined amount of money at some point.
9482552	9482912	That's it.
9483432	9484873	They're really pushing that second screen thing.
9485113	9486694	Remote play and all that fun stuff.
9487454	9490856	Hopefully you get a good price because I don't think they had a price on it.
9493379	9494000	That's it, huh?
9494020	9495962	Do you think this will actually sell?
9495982	9498145	Because that's an expensive bundle.
9498546	9505395	If it's at a good price, if you're saving quite a bit of money on it, then yeah, it should sell.
9506636	9509219	If there is no price break on it, then fuck them.
9510581	9516649	Alright, this last story I have here doesn't totally have to do with gaming, but you know what?
9517530	9523978	It definitely has to do with tech, and it's got a lot of people talking this week, and I wanted to bring it up here on the show.
9525419	9528984	Y'all know the famous MP3 player, Winamp, right?
9529244	9530445	It really whips the llama's ass.
9530465	9536287	That's right, with this little demo story about whooping the llama's ass or whatever Wesley Willis reject lyric that was.
9537668	9540589	Winamp was bought by America Online in June 1999.
9540649	9542750	America Online's still around.
9542870	9544270	And that's when the troubles began.
9544290	9548272	Yeah, guess who owns Joystick Blog and Wow Insider and all that?
9548692	9554838	TUAW and the Weblogs Network is owned by AOL Time Warner.
9555079	9558002	And Huffington Post is part of AOL now or the other way around, right?
9558122	9559763	So they've got some stuff.
9559783	9562146	They just, you know, dial up isn't really what they're known for anymore.
9562186	9565289	But anyway, they did have Winamp and they bought it in June 1999.
9565409	9568292	It is going to be shutting down.
9568693	9571115	Winamp is shutting down in exactly one month.
9573077	9573478	Sadness.
9573538	9575901	By the way, this also includes Shoutcast, apparently.
9576101	9585052	Now, what was exciting is that there were some rumors going around, I don't know if there's any truth to this, that Microsoft was looking at buying them once AOL announced that they were going to shut them down.
9585412	9589517	I don't know why Microsoft would necessarily want them, but as somebody who, you know...
9590498	9591178	Thanks for watching!
9612588	9613048	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9637242	9637742	Nothing changes.
9637842	9642984	So VOG Network's not going anywhere, but does this motivate us to possibly explore other options in 2014?
9643685	9645005	Eh, sure.
9645545	9651288	But I'll tell you, Bobby and I are both very much of the school of thought of, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
9653168	9655089	And why are you wagging your finger at me, Jason?
9656829	9658070	Because I'm very counter to that.
9658090	9659610	I like new features and new things.
9659630	9662251	Jason was like, you're using Winamp 2.0.
9663912	9664692	You're using Winamp 2.0.
9664752	9667233	We had multiple revelations today.
9667313	9669733	He's using a 7-year-old MIRC.
9670053	9674475	He's using no shit Winamp 2.0, not even 5 with the 2.0 style.
9674775	9678336	He's using Internet Explorer 6 on this PC for fuck's sake.
9679296	9681377	I'm using Firefox to browse.
9681497	9683237	I don't actually use Internet Explorer.
9683297	9688879	Internet Explorer 6 is still present and I saw it jump up and I was almost in tears.
9689739	9693740	And XP, which has been dead for how many years?
9694020	9694820	Okay, hold on, hold on.
9694880	9697381	This says that this Winamp is 5.572.
9697741	9698281	You lied to me.
9698621	9699662	It's just using the 2 style.
9701722	9702163	I get it.
9702243	9704684	There are certain situations that call for it.
9704904	9710526	5.5 is not the newest though because I get a pop-up window every time I launch it saying, shouldn't you update your Winamp?
9710566	9713547	I'm like, no, fucking leave me alone because when I update things, they break.
9714808	9715168	Always.
9715268	9716409	I like doing new things.
9716509	9717369	I like new features.
9718650	9721231	I'm not a bleeding edge kind of guy, but I'm not far from it.
9723115	9750661	so alright anyhow VOG will continue until it really does break and we are forced to switch to something else or somebody sells us real good on the advantages of using something else which is always a possibility too possible Jason's eyes lit up I'm gonna get an email tomorrow reasons why you should be on IceCast alright that's what's gonna happen yeah anyways
9751441	9753102	Alright, that was it.
9753182	9761546	Let me now switch our status on our un-updated Skype, which I'm still using 6.6, even though I think there's a 7.0 now.
9761646	9762946	I refuse to update Skype.
9764847	9765808	I was on a call.
9766068	9767008	You can call us now.
9767028	9769289	1-877-GAME-OLR or use the name on Skype, Orange Laundry.
9769749	9770810	I refuse to update Skype.
9770850	9772931	Are we going to get any calls from an Xbox One?
9773630	9774230	I hope so.
9774450	9774870	Let's see.
9775110	9777031	If you've got an Xbox One, fire it up and give us a call.
9777311	9778031	But we're going to go to the phone.
9778051	9780131	The phone lines are already lighting up, so let's go to it.
9780531	9781631	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9781691	9782292	Who's this?
9782952	9783992	This is Raven Stolfen.
9784092	9784652	Can you hear me?
9784952	9785852	Oh, yes, we can.
9785892	9787232	Hi, and your video just popped up.
9787292	9787773	What's up?
9787873	9788293	Oh, good.
9788533	9788993	I got it.
9789673	9791113	You got your gold 3DS.
9791153	9792013	You just held it up there.
9792613	9793894	Yeah, and I also got the game with it.
9794034	9794174	Nice.
9794194	9794854	I must be stupid.
9795574	9795974	Wait a minute.
9795994	9801015	You got the game and the console, even though the game's already on the console?
9801761	9812328	Yeah, well, what happened was, I was listening to your last week's show, and then I went like, you know, I bought the game at midnight with the rest of the Xbone people, and then I said, you know what, I'm gonna go buy it.
9813683	9814964	Raven's Dolphin Gets Naked
9843983	9844383	I'm kidding.
9844903	9846864	Wish for what you don't need to know.
9849505	9854806	Raven, I can't help but notice behind you, I love that little Pikachu Pokemon banner thing you've got.
9855566	9858527	Yeah, this is my little room that I broadcast on.
9858547	9860788	I know you have a little room, but this is the setup.
9861468	9864709	Some people call it a dining room, but we call it the broadcast room, yes.
9865478	9869602	Yeah, it's just a little room that I have posters of Grand Theft Auto and all that stuff.
9869642	9874986	So all the consoles are in here so I can just chill out, just shut the door and go like, go away!
9875427	9875787	Nice.
9876608	9877769	Every man needs a man cave.
9878789	9880571	Yeah, this one's pretty small, but it's awesome.
9881011	9882312	It's not the size, it's how you use it.
9883113	9887317	Yeah, I was calling because I'm sure you played Zelda.
9888698	9890800	Does it make the case for 3D for you as well?
9892330	9897073	I was already kind of like, I don't hate 3D.
9898074	9905718	It was always kind of a neat effect to me, but I don't think games should really rely on it either because there's so many people that can't see it, too.
9906519	9909681	But does it have impressive graphics?
9910161	9914064	Does it really show what 3DS can do with the 3D?
9914324	9914984	Absolutely.
9915404	9917506	I was really impressed with just like...
9918466	9933379	in the dungeons where you have the multiple levels how you can really see that top and bottom and just like when you jump off cliffs or my absolute favorite when you when you grab a chicken and then jump off a cliff and slowly fly down like yeah that stuff looks rad on a on the 3ds
9934580	9937963	Yeah, I really enjoyed a lot of this game.
9937983	9946050	I like that it's top-down, and it really does look like you're looking down on the action, and it really looks very nice.
9946290	9946491	Yeah.
9946911	9947591	No, it's great.
9947672	9948112	I love it.
9948292	9951975	And I think it makes a good case for not getting a 2DS.
9953743	9954403	It really does.
9955044	9958286	If anyone's playing on a 2DS, I feel you're missing out on something.
9958866	9961748	Just the depth of just seeing that go deeper.
9961848	9966491	It's something that... How are you liking the bigger screens now that you have a big DS?
9966711	9973135	Oh, now it's like... I'm doing one of those things where it's like, how did I go so long with my regular 3DS?
9973235	9974776	How did I manage that?
9974796	9977438	Because now that I'm on the 3DS XL, I'm like, oh my god, this is so beautiful.
9977498	9977838	I love it.
9979179	9979719	Yeah, so...
9981000	9982682	But that's like a lot of different upgrade things.
9982822	9984003	It's like the iPhones, right?
9984404	9991090	When I'm on the 4 for so long and then when I finally get the 5, it's like, God damn, how did I use that shitty phone for so long?
9991150	9992692	But that's the way tech works.
9993479	9994239	Tech is like that.
9994920	9995700	One last thing.
9996120	9998801	I'm still keeping my purple 3DS because I'm still attached to it.
9998901	10001702	I can't transfer anything over because I have the circle pad.
10002122	10004943	So I have to keep everything nice and clean on this one.
10005023	10007004	So Mario Kart 7 can't come over.
10007564	10008244	Oh, dang.
10008704	10010885	That's right because there's no circle pad for the XL, is there?
10011685	10011866	There is.
10011886	10014466	It's just I only have the circle pad for the 3DS.
10014547	10014727	Gotcha.
10016087	10023552	Oh no, I moved everything over and I bought a 32 gig card, 30 bucks at RadioShack, so I will never run into storage issues again.
10024153	10024593	That's the goal.
10024613	10025374	That's what I need to do.
10025454	10038563	I have an 8 and a 16 and I'm debating like, alright, this is my default one and it looks like I might have to just make everything from scratch or either beat Revelations on the 3DS and then move it all over later.
10038783	10042946	I was rocking a 2 gig SD card on my original 3DS and I don't know how I did it.
10043126	10044107	I don't know how the hell I did it.
10044247	10045388	Fairly sure, I still am.
10046008	10046288	Wow.
10047129	10047729	It's not enough.
10048390	10052392	Alright, well Raven, I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls, but thank you so much for the call and the video chat.
10052432	10052933	We appreciate it.
10052993	10053593	Oh, not at all.
10053793	10055074	I'm glad you can answer my call.
10055134	10055374	Bye.
10055454	10055755	Peace.
10056115	10056315	Later.
10057216	10058096	Always good to hear from Raven.
10058136	10060057	I do love the fact that you wave into the monitor.
10060178	10061078	I know, I still wave.
10061398	10067322	God, here I am talking about we don't need a stinking video show and then I'm like, I keep playing into the video stuff.
10067923	10068023	Ugh.
10069335	10070396	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10093310	10098614	I'm right by the fridge, I still have leftover vanilla vodka Fuck yes, what's the old saying?
10098935	10114987	Here's to you, here's to me, best of friends will always be But if we should ever disagree, fuck you and here's to me You got that right Yes, cling, alright, sorry Ranma You didn't call in to sing drinking songs with me Even though it's probably a nice little sidebar But what is really on your mind tonight?
10116664	10119967	Rob, it's happy hour somewhere, right?
10120107	10122689	It's happy hour at OLR, at vognetwork.com.
10123030	10131377	Between, well, we have the family-friendly bar between 5 o'clock and 6 o'clock Pacific, and then we have adults only, you know, 18 and up.
10133079	10134720	Oh, you're so bad.
10134920	10135861	You're so bad.
10136081	10137022	I'm not bad.
10137102	10140105	I'm just, we have a family-friendly bar from 5 to 6.
10140145	10140225	True.
10141286	10145208	The Legend of Zelda A Link Between Worlds The Legend of Zelda A Link Between Worlds
10163516	10167079	Yes, let's just say there was a reason why I was late to work on Friday.
10168159	10169260	Wow, really?
10170441	10171602	Yes, yeah.
10171942	10177146	I was on the line amongst the people that were picking up PlayStation 4s and Xbox Ones.
10179347	10185952	So were you like Raven where there was like four people there, like little Nintendo camps in the line or was it just you or what?
10187389	10188810	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10217402	10218002	Oh!
10218983	10221024	It's a steampunk first person shooter.
10221364	10223445	That's the reason why I want to pick it up.
10224105	10227247	As a convention goer, I can see where that's relevant to your interests.
10229108	10230608	Alright, so tell me more about Zelda.
10230628	10232169	What do you think about the game itself?
10234250	10237151	It's so surreal, especially on the XL.
10237532	10243915	It's like a total throwback for me sitting there on the Super NES playing through the game from start to finish.
10244315	10246596	The music is just phenomenal.
10247739	10251862	I just have a couple of gripes with the game, but other than that, I'm enjoying it.
10273427	10285635	Well, for me, I like the top-down view, but I remember from the Super NES version, from the top-down view, you could see more of Link's face and body, so it was more like the angle.
10286375	10292279	But in this version, all you can pretty much see is the top of the hero's head and his hair.
10293374	10294475	Super Nintendo Zelda
10315151	10328445	But I do know that I think it was with the first N64 game is when the lore of Zelda, the storyline split where you have adventures where it's just Link in the games and then there's a storyline where it's the hero.
10329066	10333491	I'm putting the game in thinking it's Link in a brand new adventure.
10333511	10334792	I'm thinking it's going to pick up
10336351	10337131	Link to the Past
10356139	10356940	All the games are like that.
10356960	10361763	I mean, even from the Super NES one, you can name whatever, but you were still Link.
10361984	10364065	Can you do that on Twilight Princess and stuff?
10364285	10367207	I thought you couldn't, but it's just been so long.
10367928	10369409	I always name them Link anyway.
10369449	10370830	I kind of just don't notice it.
10371671	10371871	Mm-hmm.
10373839	10400855	that was like that was like my issue I'm like I'd rather play as Link I mean I don't mean to split hairs but that's how I kind of feel but you're the hero but the hero looks just like Link well it's like in Final Fantasy you can technically rename all the characters as well in almost all the Final Fantasy games you can rename the characters well at least until the instituted voice acting but like you know I can't play Final Fantasy 6 and not have like Terra and Locke and all that
10402096	10408179	I think everybody does that one playthrough where you start naming your characters butts, fart, penis.
10409800	10420205	See, for me, I renamed them as characters from Ranma 1.5, and I'm following through the storyline, and I'm picturing the personalities in the game.
10420545	10421666	It fits so well.
10422046	10423167	I mean, it's just that...
10424537	10425739	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10438277	10440958	Well, that is a minor gripe, though, right?
10440978	10444578	Because at the end of the day, it doesn't really impact the game, which is fantastic.
10445218	10445418	Right.
10446099	10458721	And as I was saying earlier in a chat about it, when I called A Link Between Worlds Second Quest, I say it's Second Quest, whereas if you remember in the first game, if you played through Second Quest, everything was different.
10458921	10459101	Yeah.
10459181	10461221	Where you thought one thing was something else.
10461602	10463082	That's how I'm seeing this game.
10463122	10463362	It's like...
10464471	10468615	Everything is there, but when you go into certain locations, things have changed.
10468695	10474641	It's like, wow, it's been 10, 15 years since I've been here, so there's more for me to explore.
10474901	10477684	Or if I go into this store, oh, this is something else.
10479085	10487153	That is true, but there's also the new mechanics to consider, especially the flattening yourself on the wall really kind of changes things and shows you more parts of the world that weren't even there.
10487233	10487994	But I guess that's the point.
10488632	10488772	Mm-hmm.
10488792	10489172	All right.
10489493	10492975	All right, well, Ranma, I'm going to let you go to try and squeeze in another call, but thanks for the call.
10493636	10494397	Hey, anytime, bro.
10494497	10495137	All right, take care, buddy.
10495738	10496779	You too.
10496799	10497139	Bye.
10497159	10500842	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give us a call.
10501202	10505746	We have time for at least one more call here if you are interested in talking with us tonight.
10506746	10507907	I want to get to Twitter topics.
10507967	10513492	I also want to ask Loki if he has any last-minute stories or if you are too busy clicking cookies over there.
10513914	10514855	No, I have last minute stories.
10514955	10515716	Okay.
10515776	10532377	Apparently there's been reports that you can have some issues, maybe even possibly a band if you upload stuff to the upload studio on Xbox One with obscenities in there.
10535078	10540099	So maybe it was a glitch or something, but there has been some reports regarding that.
10541299	10541560	All right.
10542320	10548462	We got another call coming in, so let's get to it, and then we'll take whatever last-minute stories otherwise that Loki has.
10548842	10549282	Let's get to it.
10549322	10550162	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
10550182	10550522	Who's this?
10553663	10554083	Hola.
10554143	10555564	Bienvenidos a Orange Sounds Radio.
10556444	10556704	You there?
10556744	10557084	Call her.
10559780	10560701	Hello, I don't know.
10560721	10565023	Yeah, Skype seems to think the caller isn't there, so I'm going to have to let that call go.
10565523	10567804	Sorry about it, but go ahead and try again.
10567824	10573527	Remember, Echo123 is your friend to test before you call.
10573547	10574868	I haven't heard that in years.
10575068	10576308	What?
10576488	10576688	Echo123.
10576828	10577209	Echo123.
10578769	10584032	I would love to see an Xbox One call, so please, if you have your Xbox One, I want to see what the quality looks like.
10585613	10587974	See you sitting on your couch there, giving a call.
10590406	10592528	Maybe I can give the voice command and it'll work.
10592988	10596690	Xbox, Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10596850	10599292	Now if somebody is playing, it's going to fuck them up.
10599372	10600733	Sorry, I had to.
10601013	10602114	Xbox, open Skype.
10604675	10606076	Now everybody's going to go hit stop.
10606156	10607237	Oh, we're getting another call here.
10607857	10608938	If I did, I apologize.
10609058	10610019	All right, yeah, I know, right?
10610519	10611340	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10611360	10611680	Who's this?
10615346	10616067	Hello!
10616307	10619408	Go ahead and mute the... I think they got scared.
10620909	10622569	Mute your radio before you call in.
10622609	10623650	That's always a good idea.
10624810	10626111	Otherwise we hear ourselves echoing.
10626151	10626831	It's a little awkward.
10626891	10628031	That was the name I didn't recognize.
10628111	10628412	Echo 1, 2, 3 again.
10628432	10628492	And...
10634754	10638096	or maybe that person just accidentally called us because of what you did.
10638116	10642418	Hey, you're the one that said Skype or is on radio.
10642599	10643959	I just said open Skype.
10644219	10644600	That's true.
10644620	10644960	Come on.
10645020	10646261	You went the whole nine yards.
10646461	10649122	It would be really funny because that person hung up right away.
10649222	10650403	Maybe that really did dial.
10650523	10650943	I don't know.
10651764	10652644	Should we try it again?
10653465	10655366	No, don't do it again.
10655406	10656446	I'm going to get hate mail.
10656486	10657047	Loki, go ahead.
10657627	10658648	If you have more last minute stories.
10660228	10660509	I don't.
10661469	10662130	Oh, well, goddamn.
10662470	10662650	Sorry.
10663328	10669069	Alright, let me... I'm trying to pull up our Twitter, but I got sidetracked.
10669289	10670790	But I know we had some tweets here tonight.
10671870	10672310	Let's see.
10673250	10677731	YYR tweets us, Guess what comes out for 3DS in North America and Europe in four days?
10678431	10681692	Space Harrier and Super Hang-On in glorious 3D.
10681912	10682472	Insta-buy.
10682893	10683993	I forgot about those.
10684153	10685373	I'm excited about that as well.
10685413	10688194	Too bad DarkSakura's not here tonight to give you a little squee, but...
10689734	10690815	Squeak, squeak.
10690995	10693156	Here you go.
10693216	10693716	Let's see.
10695457	10700580	Gally89 tweeted us this little acapella Mega Man 2 Wily stage.
10700940	10703622	I didn't screen the YouTube first, so I'm not going to play it right now.
10704542	10708864	But I love seeing that type of remixed homegrown stuff on YouTube.
10709305	10709825	Always fun.
10710505	10725472	uh CatastrophicMagi also excited about Atlas announcing Persona 5 giving us the links just in case we missed it um Dungeon Buster says first thing I thought of listening to Yakuza 5's Battle of Pride was OLR makes me sad it's not getting localized
10726312	10727713	Oh, I got to give this as a shout out too.
10727733	10729973	This came in through our Twitter and I got to say hi to this.
10730313	10732094	This came from Video Game Bang.
10732854	10736215	And they said, hi, you're a Sacramento Gaming podcast.
10736616	10738336	We're a Sacramento Gaming podcast.
10738696	10739777	Let's be friends.
10740597	10743778	So shout out to our new frenzies at Video Game Bang.
10744078	10746619	And I did reply and said, okay, BFFs forever.
10747019	10747719	So there you go.
10747799	10748640	So there you go.
10748700	10749900	Hello to Video Game Bang.
10750200	10757784	Although I'm going to be honest, it's just the Pervo in me, but every time I look at the name, I see Video Gangbang, and I'm like, I need to get glasses there.
10757844	10759045	No, I'm not.
10759245	10760525	I'm sure it's a fantastic show.
10760585	10761646	I will check it out this week.
10762066	10763447	Both are fantastic shows.
10764047	10764227	What?
10764247	10765288	I said both of those.
10765308	10766709	Both are fantastic shows.
10767489	10769710	I'm sure that is true as well.
10769731	10772572	I will check out Video Game Bang later this week.
10773013	10774814	Wouldn't it be funny if they live next door?
10776115	10776995	You never know.
10777215	10778276	They're in Sac somewhere.
10778296	10780657	Should we knock on the wall and find out?
10780918	10786241	I'm not far from Sac State, so I'm sure there's a lot of stuff that brews out of the college there.
10788542	10789663	The phones are ringing one more time.
10789763	10792745	We're going to try and take this call and then we'll wrap up.
10792805	10793686	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10793706	10794006	Who's this?
10797537	10799178	Hello, you're on Orange Sounds Radio, who's this?
10799959	10804283	Hello, this is Amiga777, one year later.
10804703	10807906	There you are, you made it, Amiga777, what's up buddy?
10809728	10819857	That was me that I guess tried to call earlier and ended up with the sound from the radio coming in and it didn't.
10820532	10823075	Well, 50 points from Gryffindor, but what's on your mind?
10823796	10834450	Okay, basically I figured out the reason why there wasn't a whole lot of midnight releases or campouts for Wii U last year.
10835071	10835872	And basically...
10837288	10855669	as it turns out because it was done on a Sunday I guess as it usually is a lot of the big box retail stores didn't want to do any midnight releases I guess they figured it wouldn't be you know like a commercially safe thing to do Jesus would not approve
10857230	10858530	Yeah, definitely.
10860591	10862092	I'm assuming that's what it is.
10862212	10865313	Especially in some parts of the company, you don't mess around with Sundays.
10865453	10869975	Especially asking people to stay up all night till midnight when there's church the next day.
10870535	10871616	That is asking too much.
10872336	10873437	Especially in some places.
10875417	10877638	It's not a far-fetched theory, to be honest.
10877999	10880640	But could it also be true that maybe the demand just wasn't there?
10881720	10885182	I seem to think the Wii U sold pretty well initially.
10885902	10886723	Thanks for watching!
10905423	10914926	BlackWolf in our chatroom wants to point out, I got my Wii U at a midnight release, so there were stores that did a midnight release for the Wii U, so maybe it just depends on where you were at.
10915447	10919448	But Amiga777, where are you at with these next-gen consoles?
10919468	10920748	Have you picked any of them up?
10921209	10924630	Are you Team Sony, Team Nintendo, Team Microsoft, or all teams?
10924850	10925850	Where's your head at with this?
10927531	10927591	Um...
10929154	10930954	I'm personally not on any team yet.
10932275	10938376	I guess you could say federally enough, I'm probably just still Team Sega.
10938756	10939716	Dreamcast, that is.

11117960	11118200	20 is suck.
11122591	11123592	Is that a cookie clicker thing?
11123792	11124292	No, no.
