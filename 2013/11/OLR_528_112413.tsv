7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	28000	Hot on the heels of the Playstation 4, Microsoft releases the Xbox One Million. No, Xbox releases the Microsoft One. I mean, millionaires buy one Xbox. You know what I mean. And if you don't, just stay tuned. This, Nintendo, and all your comments begin right now.
28000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	45000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Episode number 528 for this November the 24th of 2013.
45000	64000	You're here and we're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle. And it's me, Rob Roberts, and my co-hosts not here tonight, unfortunately, the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers. She has the night off. You know, we are getting into that busy holiday period. She had some family stuff going on tonight she had to attend.
64000	68000	But, he is joining us in the studio. Say hello to Tech Master, Loki!
68000	84000	Hi. How you doing, Loki? I'm back playing cookie clicker again, I guess. I thought you swore that off last week. I did, but then I realized you could prestige in it. So you get, you know, I guess you get some heavenly chips or some bullshit. You got sucked right back in.
84000	102000	Yeah, it's just because I had nothing better to do right now. Are you an achievement whore? Is that what this is about? No, it's because I had nothing better to do while we were playing or waiting for the show to start. Because I was going to start Fallout New Vegas and I have that installed. I just haven't got a chance to play it yet. So, you know, I don't have time to start New Vegas right now. So, you know.
103000	119000	So, why not click some cookies? Yep. Then you'll find a new time waster game after that, who knows. Alright, joining us here tonight, helping to fill in for host since we are down Dark Sakura tonight. You guys should be familiar with this guy by now. After all, he is the voice of the show. Say hello to Jason!
119000	122000	I may not be the happiest bunny on the farm, but I certainly am the gassiest.
123000	135000	Ew. No. We haven't referred to Dark Sakura as the happiest bunny on the farm since like episode 31 or something. I don't know. Don't you usually intermingle that every once in a while? I swear to God. Not for the past like seven years. Maybe. I don't know.
135000	149000	She used to be obsessed with that little happy bunny, but then happy bunny is all over like Hot Topic and everywhere. Like, you know, it was kind of like Hipster. She was more hipster with happy bunny and then like she liked it before it was cool. But I will back her up on that. She really did.
149000	159000	But now it's everywhere, so we don't really do that anymore. But how are you, Gassy Bunny? You better watch out or you'll get that nickname. How are you?
159000	170000	I'm quite exhausted. It's been a surprisingly non-gamey but still kind of gamey but also lots of movement in the literal sense this week.
171000	186000	Oh yeah, you've been traveling around everywhere, right? Lots of travel. My employer, coworkers of mine participate in a corporate league and the opponents did not come up with enough players to play this week.
186000	195000	And everybody still had all their gear and dressed up and they wanted to play soccer anyways, so I went out to the field to scrimmage with them and subsequently ached for like three days.
195000	201000	Are we allowed to say where you work on air? Because it's a pretty cool company. It's a pretty cool company a lot of people have heard of, I'm sure.
201000	213000	I work for GitHub down there in San Francisco, which is my excuse for coming into town constantly and it doesn't hurt that it's on their dime. So, you know, why not come out to Sacramento too?
213000	221000	We don't mind at all. We don't mind at all. Now, GitHub, I don't know a lot about it, but I also don't program. And my understanding of the site, and feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.
221000	227000	My understanding of the site is it's kind of like for people like open source code type of things, like websites.
227000	239000	Predominantly. And even if things aren't open source and you're doing the active development in private, GitHub still applies because it's the entire suite of collaboration.
239000	248000	And even people that are not developers, issues, managers, people that just need to go in for reviews and need to be a part of the process, it's all applicable to them as well.
248000	254000	So, open source, public, private, whatever, it all works out. It is the active development and collaboration.
254000	262000	Sometimes I do learn things from reading source code, even though I don't totally understand it. Like, you know, at work, there's a lot of Visual Basic tied into Microsoft Office, like macros and things like that.
262000	268000	We actually did talk about this before, and you made that exact point, that any macros or anything Visual Basic based could...
268000	273000	Well, you know, after 520 episodes, some topics repeat themselves once in a while.
273000	275000	A hundred episodes ago, you know.
276000	282000	Well, okay, I don't know if I've talked about this, but I will use this as an opportunity to give a cheap plug to my YouTube channel.
282000	286000	Because I've been using that more and more, right? My Rob Roberts plays and do my Let's Remember videos.
286000	290000	One of the games I did this week, Dragon Fire on the Atari 2600. Did you ever play this game?
290000	291000	I did not.
291000	292000	Run across the bridge, run through the...
292000	293000	Practically all of the Atari.
293000	296000	You're probably too young. But anyway, the Atari...
296000	302000	Okay, so the reason why I bring that game up specifically is that the guy actually released the source code.
302000	305000	And you can go to Atariage.com and check out the source code for Dragon Fire.
305000	308000	And I find those Atari 2600 source codes amazing.
308000	311000	I don't understand it whatsoever, but it's like...
311000	314000	The cool thing about Dragon Fire in particular is that it's all commented.
314000	319000	Like, here is the code that shows the sprite for the chalice, you know, something like that.
319000	322000	And so you can actually kind of see, like, wow, this is...
322000	325000	Like, when they have to cram all this crap into 4K.
325000	327000	4 kilobytes! Or 8 kilobytes.
327000	330000	We're like the average Atari 2600 size, if you think about it.
330000	333000	4 kilobytes! That's nothing.
333000	334000	We have a...
334000	338000	I write Word documents that are like 200 kilobytes. Easy. Easy!
338000	343000	That's because there's more background data in a Word document than there is actual text that you type into it.
343000	344000	True.
344000	347000	But there is a similar feat, as a matter of fact, for the classic game of the week.
347000	353000	A similar feat of how in the hell did they do this back in the day with such restricted file sizes and everything else.
353000	359000	Well, very cool. Sorry, we digressed a little bit there, but I find the source code stuff really fascinating.
359000	361000	I also want to introduce our chat room, of course.
361000	363000	We always have our live chatters with us.
363000	370000	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network.
370000	372000	vognetwork.com
372000	374000	And you can join us, if you are listening live, in our chat room.
374000	376000	live.vognetwork.com
376000	380000	Our good buddy, Bobby Black Wolf, in fact, starts us off tonight, because I love this comment here.
380000	388000	He says, the source code to Pac-Man on Atari 2600 is a piece of art, even though everyone considers it a terrible game to play.
388000	397000	Well, yes, Pac-Man on the Atari 2600 was really garbage, but if you think about the time constraints the guy had to work with, it's really astonishing.
397000	403000	You know, like, yeah, it does some weird shit, like the fact that the ghost can only draw one, like it has to cycle.
403000	408000	That's why the ghosts blink, because it can't, like the Atari 2600 literally cannot draw all of them at once.
408000	412000	So it draws these two in one frame, these two in, or maybe one each frame, I don't remember what it does.
412000	416000	But it's crazy shit that, to get it to work, and he had to do it in mere months.
416000	420000	And that's what fucked up a lot of those Atari 2600 games, is that they had no time.
420000	422000	E.T., same story.
422000	430000	Well, there were maybe some other decisions along with E.T. as well, but not to digress yet again on another detail, though.
430000	439000	I could talk about old shit all day long, and considering that I have not bought the Xbox One or the PlayStation 4 yet, I'd prefer to focus on the old.
439000	448000	It was the seventh guest in the eleventh hour that are in a really similar state, that because they were made in that Windows 95, DOS, transitional kind of world,
448000	456000	where, you know, the modern, what are the words that I'm even looking for, the modern conveniences in libraries and DirectX didn't exist yet,
456000	467000	and in order to be widely compatible with all the hardware that was blossoming in the Windows era, they had to, the developer had to do these really, really, really nasty, low-level, like, assembly tricks
467000	477000	to just eke out that last bit of performance for all of the visuals and the smooth video and everything that that game employed, alongside Myst and Riven as well,
477000	484000	just to take something that is still images with depth and the transitions and everything else.
484000	489000	Yeah, human ingenuity and what computers have done for the last decade is unreal.
489000	496000	Well, you know, there is a way to kind of tie all this talk into what's going on with the new consoles, because we were listening to Bobby's show here in studio,
496000	504000	and just the general talk as well out there on the internet, I know one of the topics that came up on Bobby's show tonight was the fact that some of the launch games that you have right now
504000	509000	kind of look like they could be done on current consoles, and that could be done for a variety of reasons.
509000	516000	For example, I would argue a game like Assassin's Creed 4, well, that game was always planned to be on the current and the new consoles,
516000	521000	so of course you're not going to see much of an upgrade there. But then you hear talks about a game like Dead Rising 3.
521000	529000	You know, Dead Rising 3, some people say, kind of looks like a 360 game, even though more sprites, more things they're doing.
529000	538000	But Dead Rising, I think the problem is, you know, people have the expectation, because last gen, well, even before last gen began, or this gen, getting confused which gen we're on now,
538000	547000	you know, this gen I guess, they were talking about, oh yeah, 1080p, you know, it's going to be 60 frames per second and stuff,
547000	553000	and then the next gen, okay, that's how we're going to differentiate ourselves, it's going to be higher resolutions, better frame rates and stuff like that,
553000	563000	and then you have Dead Rising 3 come out, that's 720p running at 30 frames per second, and it chugs, and there's like long ass load screens.
563000	571000	It's like, dude, what the hell, I mean, you could have done this shit on Xbox 360 and had the same kind of results.
571000	576000	I mean, why are there games out now that have higher frame rates, look better, and you can't pull this shit off on the next gen?
576000	581000	Well, because, and to tie it into what Jason was just talking about, it's learning the tricks,
581000	586000	and I think there's still a lot of tricks that the developers are going to have to learn with these consoles,
586000	591000	and we'll see it in about, you know, a year, where these games start to look better and better.
591000	598000	Like, you even see it with the current gen stuff, like a game like, what's like a really good looking game that came out in the past year?
598000	605000	Something like Tomb Raider, let's say, looks frickin' phenomenal, and you put that side by side with Cameo.
605000	615000	You know, Cameo didn't really, I mean, sure it was HD, but it was kind of a glorified PS2 game.
615000	621000	Well, there was a lot of games that came out even at the launch of the Xbox 360 that, you know, definitely looked like Xbox games and stuff,
621000	630000	but I am still bugged at the fact that, you know, and this I guess is even the same situation with, you know, the Xbox 360 when it launched,
630000	637000	that they want people to spend money on these systems and they haven't really shown what's different about these systems.
637000	642000	Okay, cool, so the Xbox One can display more zombies on screen, but the game still runs like shit.
642000	651000	I mean, you know, why don't you, I don't know, instead of pumping out a thousand zombies on the screen, maybe do 500, and then the frame rate's better.
651000	659000	You know, yes, I understand that you can run all these, but obviously at some sort of expense because, you know, you're not running at 60 frames per second.
659000	667000	You know, the graphics aren't 1080p, so maybe it's just not really worth it. It's almost like a gimmick, like this is the bullet point.
667000	673000	Yeah, it's the most zombies ever, but, you know, it's just not very good. That's the thing.
673000	683000	I don't know. I mean, I never had a problem with there being too few zombies in Dead Rising games, to be honest, so I don't really know why it's an issue.
683000	692000	Are you being a little harsh? Because DKB in the chatroom says, runs like shit, really? And even I have to go, isn't that a little harsh?
692000	706000	It's 30 frames per second. 30 frames per second. Once again, I have an expectation. If they want me to spend $500 on a new console, then I better see a fucking difference between this gen and next gen.
706000	717000	Like, I wanna see, they have to wow me, they have to sell it to me. And honestly, they're showing me a game that looks like Dead Rising 2, but oh, the map's slightly bigger this time, and oh, there's some more zombies.
717000	719000	I don't fucking care, I'm not buying that system.
719000	729000	To be fair, and to be devil's advocate a little bit here, didn't we kinda know that going into this round of consoles, that they weren't gonna be pushing the graphical envelope and all this as much?
729000	737000	Because there's not a lot more you can do with the current TVs, and Intel 4K TVs are the standard, which we don't even know if that will be.
737000	753000	You know, there's not a lot else to do visually. When we were talking PlayStation 2 to PlayStation 3, the entire world was in the process, well, at least this country, and probably most of the rest of the world, was transitioning between SDTV and HDTV. I mean, that was a huge jump.
753000	767000	Okay, I understand that, but we've had a whole generation of games that have been running at 720p and now with hardware that's definitely a lot better than this current generation systems, and they can't fucking pull out 1080p native?
767000	790000	I mean, and a decent frame rate? I mean, shit, Rise runs at 30 frames per second, if you're lucky, it's locked in there, or it even did dumbass shit with Need for Speed Rivals, where even on PC it's fucking locked at 30 frames per second, you try to unlock it and the game goes crazy because it's just the way they did their physics or something in the game, it's just all messed up.
791000	804000	That's my problem, though, is that they are, once again, there's no, and I think this is gonna be a problem with these consoles, there's no hook, there's no hook to get me in there, whereas like, you know, with the Wii, it took off because it was like a new way to play games.
804000	818000	You know, Microsoft's trying to sell it, hey, Kinect is important, but it doesn't really do a whole ton. Once again, it's like these fucking promises that they made when Kinect originally came out, and we're seeing the same shit not quite work right again.
819000	834000	And it's like, well, we're gonna patch it, it's gonna get better. No, it didn't fucking get better with the original Kinect, and same with smart glass stuff, I haven't seen how they've really implemented these second screen things other than, ooh, you can call it an airstrike by hitting a button on your tablet or something.
835000	847000	Why does that need to be on a tablet? Why do we need a separate app to do that on a tablet when you can hit start, pull up a pause menu or some shit like that, and do it on that? I don't understand why they have to overcomplicate everything.
847000	855000	Okay, I'm trying to figure out where your head's at right now with these new consoles, because you're coming off to me right now like more negative than I kind of thought you were at.
855000	870000	Like, I kind of thought you were in a similar place that I was at where, okay, you might not be on board with Xbox One and PlayStation 4 right now because the games aren't really there to substantiate the several hundred dollars purchase, but I kind of thought you'd be jumping on board a year or two from now. Am I wrong?
871000	882000	I mean, maybe if there's some better games coming out that actually show off the hardware, but right now there's not really anything coming out that's going to be like that.
882000	891000	I mean, it just all seems like promises right now, that we're getting a lot of promised things, and that's it. It's just promises.
891000	901000	I mean, even like, look at these launches. It's pathetic, the amount of features that are in there that are going to be patched in later on. It just screams rushed. The whole thing screams rushed.
901000	913000	It really, these consoles should have come out six months from now, and not now. I don't know why bother rushing everything. I guess because they have to react to the other, you know...
913000	915000	Well, the holidays too.
915000	919000	So what? It doesn't matter. The holidays don't matter. If the console comes out...
919000	921000	Well, hold on now. Hold on now.
921000	935000	No, the holidays don't matter as far as selling these consoles. You'll sell a million consoles regardless of the... Are these people really saving them for the holidays? I mean, maybe a small percentage of them, but put it out six months from now and people would still be buying them.
935000	947000	Oh, fiscal year performance is important too, and you and I both know you're going to sell more consoles, way more consoles between October and December than you're going to sell between January and March, which is the end of the fiscal year. So...
947000	951000	I mean, in that sense it's logical, right?
951000	967000	Well, for their investors, I guess they have to do whatever they can to please them and spin whatever they can PR-wise. But I'm just saying, for me, it's... Unless I get one for free, in which case I'm not turning down free.
967000	985000	You know, I'm not picking one up anytime soon because there's no games on there that I'm really interested in, and so far everything they've shown, they haven't really changed anything. It's all the same shit that they're pulling right now on the current gen consoles, and to be honest, there's more games coming out in current gen anyways.
985000	1006000	I want to see some significant differences between Assassin's Creed IV on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3, or hell, even when Titanfall comes out, I kind of want to see what they're going to do as far as the Xbox 360 version. Let's see how different that is compared to the Xbox One version.
1006000	1018000	I just... I need to see what these vast differences are in order for me to justify me purchasing, because, to be honest, might as well just dump that $500 into a PC, because at least those games are going to be running at a higher resolution than 720p.
1018000	1028000	Alright, I don't know. I think you might be being a little too harsh, but I also understand the frustrations. I get it.
1028000	1042000	Alright, live.vognetware.com. It is the show where every gamer has a voice. Bobby Blackwolf, wanting to challenge you on one of these points here, saying they rush it because gamers don't want to wait. How much did you complain when Grand Theft Auto 5 was delayed?
1042000	1054000	It was worth it. It was worth it. And let me be honest, let me be honest with Grand Theft Auto 5. Grand Theft Auto 5 has a lot more content than some of these other fucking next-gen games coming out.
1054000	1064000	I would be a horrible, irresponsible person if I did not ask this question. Could you be sitting here, a year from now, going, it was worth it for Xbox One?
1065000	1068000	When that Grand Theft Auto 6 or whatever happens.
1068000	1073000	I can't predict the future, and it's going to be Grand Theft Auto 5 again on next-gen is what it's going to be.
1073000	1087000	No, I can't predict the future. I mean, I would like for them, I'd like to be wrong on these consoles. I mean, honestly I would, but as we're going to get into later on, there's some things that we've complained about, like,
1087000	1094000	Dude, it's a fucking $60 game and you're treating it like a free-to-play game, and shit's not going away. It's only getting worse.
1094000	1105000	And so why should I buy into these brand new consoles if they're just going to turn them into some sort of sieve for me to basically take more money from me?
1106000	1119000	They need to have something to really sell me on it. Like, Kinect 2.0 is supposed to be so integral to the Xbox experience, and aside from voice commands and shit, I don't really fucking care about voice commands, okay?
1119000	1121000	Yeah, that's cool and all, but...
1121000	1129000	I hear, I mean, I don't know. Again, there's a lot of mixed opinions out there, but I'm hearing that people really are enjoying the interface once they finally get down in there and use it.
1129000	1134000	That the whole, like, you know, screen and screen stuff and all that kind of works pretty good.
1135000	1154000	I still don't, for me, the screen and screen stuff, once again, you're telling me that it's important for me to have, like, a tablet so I can do the second screen stuff, so why do I need a little tiny sliver of my screen when I can do the same shit on my tablet that's right in front of me because you're having me, you know, use this tablet to play the games as well.
1155000	1167000	Alright, alright. Bobby making another good point, so I just want to get this out there. Bobby says the Xbox One had to come out now because there are investors wanting to close the Xbox division, so it had to come out to try to make some money so they didn't get shut down.
1167000	1177000	You have your fans too, Loki. MM2K says Loki is absolutely right. Right now, plug money into a PC. Best games are multi-platform anyway and will be on Steam.
1177000	1179000	Except for Grand Theft Auto 5.
1179000	1181000	Eventually, eventually.
1181000	1185000	It is coming. They already have PC documentation inside.
1185000	1199000	Alright, we got into a kickoff topic anyway. I originally wanted to talk about the Xbox One's launch. I wanted to talk about those sales figures. I don't know, Loki, do you want to kind of go over the sales figures because, as Bobby said, they're trying to make some money. Sounds like they did after all, right, Loki?
1200000	1209000	Yeah, they did pretty well. They sold, you know, both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One sold a million units, or they say they're phrasing it as over a million units.
1209000	1216000	So, of course, I'm trying not to sound biased here, but I really fucking hate PR speak.
1216000	1224000	And I got back, you know, I got down on Activision about Call of Duty and their one million units shipped, you know, bullshit and stuff.
1224000	1232000	Yes, they sold a million units worldwide versus one million units North America for the PlayStation 4.
1232000	1240000	But, hey, you know what? No one's knocking a million units. A million units of a console, you know, within 24 hours is fantastic.
1240000	1249000	Sorry, I have to say this. I'm sorry, Loki, it's kind of interrupting, but Tech2030 in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, fuck this, let's just not buy any of them and only play Cookie Clicker.
1249000	1253000	And 66% of the room is.
1254000	1255000	I'm multitasking.
1258000	1265000	Hey, and I have my phone off, Jason, because mine will produce cookies while it's not on. All right, anyway, all joking aside.
1265000	1273000	So, one million on both consoles, but, okay, I have to go there and I'm not trying to knock Xbox because I'm going to be real with you guys.
1273000	1280000	Based on all that internet stuff and all the rabble rabble angry mobs we saw six months ago, I wasn't expecting Xbox One to do that well.
1280000	1290000	So, yay for them. I think competition is healthy across the board. However, it is worth pointing out, Xbox One might have sold a million, but they did it in, what, 13 countries?
1290000	1292000	Whereas PlayStation 4 was only US and Canada, right?
1292000	1299000	I still think it's very skewed as far as, you know, it's good for day one. Don't get me wrong, it's good for day one.
1299000	1309000	But if you're going to play the console wars here, you have to understand that we're talking, you know, a couple countries versus basically all their launch territories at once.
1309000	1312000	But it's not like doom and gloom for Xbox. Far from it.
1312000	1322000	Not at all. But at the end of the day, once they do finally launch in all their countries or whatever, I think you're going to see a significant number of more PlayStation 4s than you are in the Xbox One.
1322000	1327000	Because I don't think they still recovered completely from, you know, all the bullshit.
1327000	1333000	I think it's just the price. I think at the end of the day, for a lot of people, I mean, not the ones listening to this podcast or participating.
1333000	1339000	I think the folks, you know, active gamers participating in this kind of thing have a lot more issues to juggle.
1339000	1344000	But I think for a lot of people, for a lot of parents sitting there going, what do I buy for my teenage son or daughter?
1344000	1349000	Oh, this one's cheaper, I'm going to get that. I think for a lot of people that's what it's going to come down to.
1349000	1356000	If there's not already one of the previous gen consoles in the house, or if they have both, then they'll start with the cheaper one.
1356000	1363000	Plus, it's a little different now than when we were growing up and our parents, most of our parents didn't know anything about video games.
1363000	1368000	Now, the parents, a lot of them did play video games. A lot of people listening to this show are parents.
1368000	1372000	So it is, you know, it is a little different. I might not be being fair either.
1372000	1378000	But it's certainly applicable in the broader sense. There's still massive legions of people that, parents that aren't into gaming,
1379000	1386000	and they do add up to that majority of the people that would have gotten the console for their child, teen, anything along those lines.
1386000	1390000	And when it comes to the parents, I don't think you can totally count out Wii U either.
1390000	1393000	No, not at all. I mean, they have some good games on there.
1393000	1397000	I mean, if you like Nintendo games, they're good. Wii U is going to be great.
1397000	1404000	If you're looking for other games from other companies, you may be having some issues.
1404000	1406000	We'll come back to this later.
1406000	1411000	But I'm just saying, as far as Nintendo games go, yeah, it's fantastic.
1411000	1416000	Because a lot of people look forward to Nintendo games on those consoles.
1416000	1423000	But it's just... I don't know. They're kind of in their own thing.
1423000	1425000	They don't even want to compete in this next gen.
1425000	1428000	And that's why I always kind of laugh when they show, okay, the next generation is starting.
1428000	1431000	They show the Wii U. I'm like, ha ha ha. Yeah, okay, whatever.
1431000	1437000	But it's just... I don't know. It'll be interesting to see what happens with all these consoles and stuff.
1437000	1441000	But it's just... it's a rocky start, I think.
1441000	1444000	Doomplague in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,
1444000	1449000	Wii U currently has better games than either new console, just probably not for long.
1449000	1454000	I think that's a very good, yes, I agree with you point.
1454000	1459000	Because I would agree. I think Wii U right now has better games than either one of those consoles.
1459000	1463000	But are we going to be able to say the same a year from now? I don't know.
1463000	1466000	Because you're going to get some heavy, heavy hitters next year.
1466000	1470000	I imagine, you know, we already know there's going to be Destiny, Titanfall.
1470000	1473000	I imagine Microsoft's going to push out their new Halo for next holiday.
1473000	1475000	Or at least, you know, you're going to see a lot on that.
1475000	1480000	Sony, I don't know what their... they'll probably have a new LittleBigPlanet or something.
1480000	1482000	They've got plenty of stuff they can rely on.
1482000	1485000	All of those games that they had to delay into first or second quarter.
1485000	1487000	Well, they have an Uncharted 4.
1487000	1488000	Right.
1488000	1495000	And then so Nintendo's challenge is going to really be how are they going to stay afloat without all the third party support.
1495000	1499000	But they will throw out a new Zelda on Wii U next year.
1499000	1501000	I think we're all anticipating that.
1501000	1508000	If they don't, honestly, if they don't do a Zelda on Wii U next year, there's going to be a lot of people that are disappointed.
1508000	1511000	That's the reality of where we're at right now.
1511000	1513000	And Smash Brothers.
1513000	1517000	Nintendo has a big 2014 for its namesake titles.
1517000	1519000	As does the roll out of the Xbox One and PS4.
1519000	1525000	Even Smash Bros though, I was kind of excited about it for the Wii and stuff, but the new one just doesn't really...
1525000	1528000	It's kind of like, hey, look, it's the same characters we had last time.
1528000	1531000	Don't knock it till you see it a little more in motion.
1531000	1537000	I don't think we've really seen... I mean, yes, we've had some teasers, but you haven't seen the game really in motion.
1537000	1539000	Getting your hands on it and all that.
1539000	1541000	And I think there's a lot to come with that.
1541000	1544000	I think back to the Wii one when it was in development, you know?
1544000	1549000	There was a big difference between the early, early stages and hearing about the characters and then really getting to play that thing.
1549000	1553000	Those Smash Bros games have a lot of depth to them.
1553000	1558000	And there's so much in regards to the unlockables, collectables, and all that stuff.
1558000	1564000	I really hope they don't rush this Wii U one, but it's been in development a hell of a long time.
1564000	1567000	So I would think we're going to be ready in 2014, but we'll see.
1567000	1573000	Alright, anyhow, I think that's enough of our kickoff topic of Xbox One and everything else going on.
1573000	1579000	Let's talk a little more specifically about what you yourself have been doing in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week?
1579000	1582000	I would usually let ladies go first, but we don't have any tonight.
1582000	1586000	But Jason, since you are sitting in Jamie's chair, go for it. How was your gaming week?
1586000	1588000	I have been playing a lot of real life the game.
1588000	1594000	It's an epic training simulator and workout simulator and driving simulator and walking simulator.
1594000	1597000	You even sound like Jamie with that gaming week.
1597000	1606000	It's been a really light couple of weeks because I, as I'm sure many people remember, I was here a couple episodes ago.
1606000	1611000	I've been to Arizona and back in that time I was training a new coworker this week.
1611000	1620000	Incredibly busy times. I'm basically just grinding a little bit more, by which I mean getting completely obliterated on FTL.
1620000	1629000	And then a couple new upgrades in Rogue Legacy and just trying to progress that game further so I can actually get into the third and fourth regions a little bit more consistently.
1629000	1633000	And Rogue Legacy now has the Steam trading cards, which is even more incentive to play that crap.
1633000	1638000	I got some time ago, I'm sure.
1638000	1643000	They didn't just come out last week, but I noticed within the past month or so, since the last time you were on it.
1644000	1655000	Just casual grinding of games with a very defined start and end and are also very friendly to just stop what I'm doing wherever I am with no penalty to speak of.
1655000	1661000	Yeah, that's honestly really about all I've had time for this past week.
1661000	1663000	Fair enough. At least you dabbled in a couple things.
1663000	1665000	Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?
1665000	1673000	It was pretty pathetic. I haven't really played anything this week other than Call of Duty, actually. I played a little bit of that at work.
1673000	1682000	I didn't even play any Grand Theft Auto this week. I meant to play some other things with it. I started Dexter, so I've been watching TV.
1682000	1684000	More TV than games right now.
1684000	1691000	I was just trying to take a break from Grand Theft Auto for a little bit. I'm going to go back into it, obviously, really soon.
1692000	1702000	I'm trying to start. Once again, I know the new Steam sale is coming up soon, and I'm like, man, there's a lot of games I haven't played yet that I've bought.
1702000	1705000	Winter is coming. Brace yourselves for the Steam sale.
1705000	1711000	I'm like, oh, shit, man, there's a lot of games I haven't played. Even with the Humble Bundles, they had some Warner games won.
1711000	1717000	I'm just like, maybe I should buy that, even though they have no interest in the Batman games.
1717000	1722000	Speaking of Humble Bundle, did you see the pinball collection that's on the Humble Bundle?
1722000	1729000	Which one is it? Zen Pinball. It's not the actual Humble Bundle, it's the weekly sale.
1729000	1738000	Oh, sorry, yeah, yeah. You can get all that. I picked that up, I haven't played it yet, but I was very excited to see that in there.
1738000	1744000	I don't recall all the details, but I stumbled across something the other day. It was basically a make-your-own Humble Bundle.
1744000	1746000	Well, they launched the store now.
1746000	1748000	There's a lot of different websites that have that kind of stuff.
1748000	1756000	Yeah, I've seen the improvements that Humble Bundle has been rolling out in that regard, but I thought it was something unique. Damn.
1756000	1764000	No, I came across it, I was like, I don't have time, and I don't have money, buy in, so I didn't take in enough of the details.
1764000	1765000	Sorry, Loki.
1765000	1772000	No, there's a bunch of different Humble Bundle-esque sites that, you know, there's one of them that does that, I don't know.
1772000	1780000	But yeah, so that's pretty much that, and I've just been messing around with Clicker today, just because, I don't know, I'm just bored.
1780000	1788000	I can't start Fallout right now, because it's in the middle of the show, and this doesn't take any intelligence at all, other than clicking a mouse.
1788000	1792000	So yeah, that's pretty much where I've been.
1792000	1797000	Alright, well, I've been very busy with a couple new games. I've been playing the usual stuff as well,
1798000	1803000	helping Alan and stuff. But this Friday, obviously, was the release of the Xbox One.
1803000	1808000	I feel the same way about the One that I do about the PlayStation 4. The games aren't there for me right now.
1808000	1817000	Next year, I'm probably going to have to pick up both, because you're going to have things like Final Fantasy XIV and Destiny on PlayStation 4, things that I definitely want over there.
1817000	1822000	And then on Xbox One, I'm sure they'll announce Forza Horizon 2, which will be enough for me to get an Xbox One.
1822000	1832000	So I'll get those in 2014, but for now, being a Wii U owner, I was very excited about the release of Super Mario 3D World on the Nintendo Wii.
1832000	1834000	Wii U.
1834000	1842000	Thank you, yes, Wii U. And I will tell you this, the game delivers. It's outstanding. I love it.
1842000	1851000	It's what you would kind of expect. I don't think it really, to me it feels a lot different than 3D Land on the 3DS did,
1851000	1858000	because obviously, for one, it's not really in 3D, but for two, I think just the larger screen, the more diverse characters,
1858000	1862000	I feel like there's kind of more going on in each stage because of it.
1862000	1870000	I'm going to tell you the thing I like most about Mario 3D World is the attention to detail, and it's the little things that really make that game.
1870000	1878000	The things from you get really close to a Goomba, and the Goomba spots you and makes angry Goomba face and starts charging at you.
1878000	1885000	Or when you step on a turtle, and there's that literal moment you can actually see the little Koopa of the whole, like, where'd my pants go?
1885000	1889000	type of thing, and running over to try to get the shell as fast as they can.
1889000	1895000	To the little sound when you walk on a glass, you hear the clink, clink, clink, clink when you're actually walking on glass pipes.
1895000	1902000	To when you're underwater, the background music actually changes completely to when you come back above the water, it goes back to where it was at.
1902000	1909000	To when you're kitty Mario, which really is the best thing ever, that was a great power-up, love it.
1909000	1914000	When you're climbing up a wall, and you go as far as you can, because you can't just climb the wall infinitely,
1914000	1920000	finally you get to a certain point where you can't climb anymore, and they just claw onto the wall and they start slipping,
1920000	1924000	and they leave little claw marks behind as they're falling and look really sad.
1924000	1931000	It's those little details that really do it for me, and yeah, the level design obviously is great.
1931000	1938000	There's things to collect in every level, so just because you beat it once doesn't mean you're going to collect all three green stars and the stamp and everything.
1938000	1941000	The social elements are very interesting.
1941000	1951000	I know we give Nintendo a hard time about not understanding online, but the way they've integrated Miiverse into this and the ghost Miis and everything is interesting.
1951000	1957000	I think in some ways it's kind of give or take, but just to kind of give you an example,
1957000	1961000	while you're walking around the world map, you'll see these random Miis on the map,
1961000	1966000	and if you walk up to them, they'll have a little picture of something they wrote on Miiverse about that world.
1966000	1977000	When you beat a stage, you'll actually see scrolling across the top of the screen, Miiverse posts from people who also played that stage and posted something about it on Miiverse.
1977000	1984000	I'll give you an example of how this can work. I was playing a level in World 3 not long ago.
1984000	1988000	It's a water level, and we all love water levels, but they're a necessary part of any Mario game, right?
1988000	1993000	I couldn't find two of the stars in the level. I could find the last one, but I couldn't find the first two.
1993000	1998000	So when I beat the level, it shows me all the Miiverse posts, and one of the first ones that comes up is,
1998000	2001000	Where are the first and second stars?
2001000	2005000	I'm like, thank god it's not just me. That was literally my reaction, right?
2005000	2012000	So that was kind of, I don't know, that was a neat reaction I can't think of that I get in any other game right now.
2012000	2017000	And I'm not saying it's like a huge deal or a game changer, or OMG Nintendo is pushing the envelope,
2017000	2024000	but I will say that was a unique reaction, that immediate instant feedback that I can't say I get anywhere else right now.
2024000	2027000	That instant attachment to another individual somewhere out there in the universe.
2027000	2033000	Yes, like the whole, like, me too, me too, stranger danger 10357 or whatever your name is, right?
2033000	2039000	You know, there was that instance where I did kind of feel like, oh okay, so I'm not the only crazy one.
2039000	2043000	Yeah, it's a very interesting, it's a very interesting case to think about the fact that,
2043000	2053000	yeah, Nintendo is not necessarily getting the always-on, multi-world, MMO, universe-style network services,
2053000	2059000	but they're pushing a really damn good community, and as long as they keep up the moderator action,
2059000	2065000	It's moderated, it's a moderated community, and that works and it doesn't work,
2065000	2070000	because again, you know, we criticized Nintendo last week about the whole swap note thing,
2070000	2074000	which I think was completely valid, I think it was ridiculous the way they threw the baby out with the bathwater with that,
2074000	2080000	but, I mean, there's a difference between these type of public communications you have in a game like Mario,
2080000	2085000	you know, Super Mario 3D World, and the private communications where essentially if, you know,
2085000	2089000	me and a friend are both over the age of 18, we should be able to send whatever we want,
2089000	2092000	because we could do it on an email anyway, you know, so.
2092000	2099000	These emotions and expressions that they're capturing in the public eye is quite unique and very worthy, very fun to see.
2099000	2103000	Level design, again, have I mentioned how great the level design is in the game?
2103000	2109000	Because I will tell you what, also in World 3, there's a level, and this might be a minor spoiler,
2109000	2112000	so mute for about 60 seconds if you don't want to hear it, I don't think it's a big deal,
2112000	2115000	some people are nutso about spoilers, so mute it if you don't want to hear it,
2115000	2122000	there's a level in the third world that invokes Mario Kart, like right on down to the level actually looks like a Mario circuit track,
2122000	2126000	and you're running over these little dash squares, that was so much fun to play,
2126000	2132000	and I didn't even play it in multiplayer, which, can you imagine, I've only played this game in single player,
2132000	2138000	but the whole thing is designed for four people to play, and I can only imagine what a riot some of these games are in multiplayer,
2138000	2140000	and some of these levels and so forth.
2140000	2145000	One of the things that I hear about the game is that whoever does the best in a level,
2145000	2151000	wears a little crown in the next level, so you know people are going to be trying to steal that crown,
2151000	2158000	and pick on the player who has the crown, and I'm sure it makes for amazing multiplayer experiences,
2158000	2160000	but I have yet to do those, so.
2160000	2166000	Anyway, Mario 3D World, if you are a Wii U owner, I don't know why you don't have this game yet,
2166000	2172000	you need to make it a priority to get your hands on this game, because it is the best Wii U game available now.
2172000	2178000	I already thought the one they released last year was pretty good, but this one blows it out of the water, it really does.
2178000	2183000	This is great. So Mario 3D World is a must have if you're a Wii U owner.
2183000	2185000	Is it a system seller?
2185000	2188000	If you like Nintendo systems, yeah.
2188000	2191000	It's getting there. It's definitely getting there.
2191000	2197000	It's yet another game now where it's like, alright, now Wii U is starting to really build up that library.
2197000	2201000	If I drop the money on a Wii U, now I have two solid Mario games.
2201000	2206000	Zombie U, Nintendo Land, you know, maybe Wonderful 101 if you're into that, or Pikmin.
2206000	2213000	You know, it is strengthening Nintendo's library, but is it going to be a system seller?
2213000	2215000	It really depends on what type of games you're into.
2215000	2222000	It's a real bummer Mario Kart 8 didn't make it this year, because I think, and I'm all for take the time to get it right,
2222000	2229000	and also that's part of how they're going to make 2014 not feel like the desert that 2013 was.
2229000	2236000	But I think if Mario Kart 8 had come out and it was solid and they were able to deliver that 1-2 punch on the Wii U,
2236000	2242000	I would be like, you gotta buy a Wii U, because there's all these games now.
2242000	2247000	But with only the one huge, great game, it's a little harder to say.
2247000	2252000	Because I think you really have to say, like, how much do I want to play Mario 3D World?
2252000	2254000	But I'm telling you, it's really good.
2254000	2262000	So, the other Nintendo game I happened to pick up this week, I actually went and bought a 3DS XL,
2262000	2270000	because I'm that big of a whore for 2D Zelda, and I love Link to the Past, so of course I was all over Link Between Worlds.
2270000	2273000	And yes, I've seen the stories about how it's really 3D and all this stuff.
2273000	2276000	You know what I mean, it still plays like Link to the Past and all that.
2276000	2282000	So I bought a new Zelda 3DS XL, which has the Triforce, the high rule and low rule Triforces on it,
2282000	2289000	and I've been playing the game, and I, again, it's outstanding.
2289000	2291000	It's an outstanding game.
2291000	2299000	It's, like, for somebody who loves Link to the Past as much as I do, I was so giddy the way they've pulled it off.
2300000	2306000	Here's the thing, it's not a remake, but it invokes so much of the old series.
2306000	2308000	It's like going back and visiting an old friend.
2308000	2311000	Hi, how you doing? And here's what's changed.
2311000	2316000	And it's not that, again, it's not telling the same story, but it's using a really similar map,
2316000	2322000	and it's telling an all new story, and it feels like you're discovering all these places over again,
2322000	2327000	because obviously the graphic upgrades from a Super Nintendo to a 3DS are huge,
2327000	2330000	and the music's great, and so on and so on.
2330000	2335000	I also have to hand it to the team that created this.
2335000	2343000	The 3D effects are great, and considering a lot of us thought Nintendo was abandoning 3D when they released the 2DS,
2343000	2349000	it was quite pleasing to see a 3D game that really benefits from having the 3D switch on,
2349000	2352000	if you are into viewing the 3D and everything.
2352000	2357000	Like just from the little creatures jumping, the little... what were their names?
2357000	2360000	The Octoroks shoot the rocks, right? What are the little jumping spider things called?
2360000	2362000	Tektites, were those Tektites? I don't know.
2362000	2366000	Those guys that jump up and you actually kind of see that in 3D is great.
2366000	2371000	When you jump off a cliff, you see that little 3D kind of enhancement.
2371000	2377000	You definitely see it in dungeons when you're on a level, but there's an upstairs and a downstairs within the same level.
2377000	2381000	You definitely get a sense of that 3D effect, and it's done tastefully.
2382000	2383000	Yeah, it's great.
2383000	2389000	And I've heard a lot of talk about how, well, it's really weird that you can kind of rent everything from the shop in the beginning.
2389000	2393000	It's just a different way of doing it. It didn't really change things for me.
2393000	2397000	There's still definitely points and things that you get in the dungeons,
2397000	2401000	and there will be ways that you will want to play things in a certain order.
2401000	2403000	I wasn't really bothered by the rental system at all.
2403000	2409000	You know what? It also helps differentiate it from Link to the Past and make it its own game,
2409000	2414000	which is one of the better Zelda games that will be out there in the franchise, for sure.
2415000	2416000	Rama says,
2416000	2420000	Zelda A Link Between Worlds is essentially a Link to the Past second quest.
2420000	2422000	Don't agree with you.
2422000	2431000	I think they've changed enough where, especially once you get that ability where you can actually kind of glue yourself to walls and walk around and all that,
2431000	2437000	it really changes a lot of the puzzles and so forth, and just such the graphical upgrade and everything.
2437000	2439000	I don't know if I would call it a second quest.
2441000	2444000	I don't know. It's like I said earlier. It's like revisiting an old friend.
2444000	2446000	Are there elements of Link to the Past? Absolutely.
2446000	2451000	But it is definitely its own game, and it is worth the price that they're asking for it.
2451000	2454000	The $40 or whatever. I don't know, because I bought the bundle.
2454000	2456000	But I think it's what? $40 retail, Loki?
2456000	2457000	Yeah.
2457000	2458000	It's worth it.
2459000	2460000	There it goes.
2461000	2464000	Let's see. I'm trying to look at our chat room. Sorry, I was talking so much.
2464000	2466000	I have been falling behind on our chat room.
2466000	2467000	He was fanboying.
2467000	2473000	Yeah, a little bit. A little bit. Which, you know, it's funny, because I've been accused of the whole Nintendo fanboy thing, which, whatever.
2473000	2475000	You know, I'm gonna like what I like.
2475000	2479000	But I'd like to think I'm also critical of Nintendo when they need it too.
2479000	2488000	So, and, you know, the whole online thing last week, and the fact that, you know, yes, Super Mario World, Super Mario 3D World is great,
2488000	2491000	but is it gonna be enough to really push the Wii U's this year?
2492000	2497000	I don't know. I don't know. I think Nintendo really needed that one other game, but we'll see. We'll see.
2497000	2501000	I'm rooting for them though, but I'm rooting for Microsoft and Sony as well.
2501000	2503000	Is that so wrong?
2503000	2506000	Aren't I allowed to like all the games?
2506000	2508000	Is that, is something wrong with me?
2508000	2510000	Everything. So says the internet.
2512000	2517000	Yes, I'll complain about things that need complaining about, but I'm gonna cheer on the things that need cheering of.
2517000	2524000	And these Mario and Zelda games are accomplishments that are worthy of the cheering. Absolutely.
2525000	2530000	Alright, let's see. Live.vognetwork.com. Tigerclaw says,
2530000	2535000	Zelda becomes shorter if you have the guide for it. Try playing without one. You'll spend hours trying to figure stuff out.
2535000	2537000	Well, I mean, couldn't that be said about any game?
2537000	2541000	I mean, if you use the guide, you're gonna have all the puzzles answered for you.
2542000	2548000	Zelda does have an interesting system in it where you can use the play coins that you get from walking around on the 3DS.
2548000	2555000	You can use those to buy hints from a ghost. Like, you get these little glasses in the beginning, hint glasses, and you can use them to buy hints.
2555000	2559000	So, up to you if you want to use them or not. I think that's interesting.
2559000	2563000	Some people will probably get really turned off by that, but then I just say, don't equip them.
2563000	2565000	And then they won't be there.
2565000	2572000	Let's see. Also looking for some more chats at live.vognetwork.com.
2572000	2578000	ActDeaf says, I'm forgetting Zelda Wind Waker HD, Rayman Legends, and some other games.
2578000	2583000	You're right. I probably am forgetting those games, but let's also not kid ourselves.
2583000	2588000	Both those games you mentioned are available on other consoles, especially in the case of Rayman Legends.
2589000	2596000	I know the game was developed for Wii U, and it's probably best on Wii U, but the reality is it's not exclusive to Wii U anymore.
2596000	2602000	Zelda Wind Waker HD, I haven't played that yet. I'm very much looking forward to it.
2602000	2614000	But even if the game is outstanding, which I'm sure it's great, it's really hard to call a reimagining of a GameCube game something that's gonna really sell a lot of consoles.
2614000	2617000	Although maybe it did for some people. I don't know. Maybe I'm being too hard on it.
2618000	2621000	It was the earlier Zelda release on the Wii U.
2621000	2622000	Yeah, you did.
2622000	2628000	Taste tester before... or it's the only Wii U release. What am I saying? Link Between Worlds is 3DS.
2628000	2633000	Right, right. It was also extremely quickly put together. And I'm not saying that in a bad way.
2633000	2636000	From what I understand, everybody that I know that's played it really loves it.
2636000	2641000	But they essentially threw it together, and I'm not sure how to take that.
2641000	2647000	I mean, I guess that's a good thing that you can put out a quality product so fast, but they did have to reimagine an old game to do it.
2647000	2653000	But you're right. I shouldn't totally count out when Waker HD is something that is available.
2653000	2659000	There are gonna be... you know, the game is ten years old. There are gonna be a lot of people out there, especially in their teens, that probably never touched the first game.
2659000	2666000	Anyway. Alright. I've gushed enough about New Mario and New Zelda, but I'm telling you, they're great.
2666000	2674000	And honestly, is there an Xbox One or PlayStation 4 launch game as good as Mario 3D World?
2674000	2676000	No.
2676000	2679000	I highly, highly doubt it.
2679000	2684000	Now, a year from now, will we be able to say the same thing? Probably not.
2684000	2688000	You know, Wii U also came out a year ago. They had a year to make this game, or more.
2688000	2696000	So I'm sure a year from now it'll be a different story, but I'm telling you, this really makes this whole next-gen console war...
2696000	2705000	I'm using my little quotey fingers... console war that much more interesting when I would argue the best game that came out for the holiday season
2705000	2712000	is on the Wii U. Although, to be fair, there's still a lot of games that came out earlier that are also really good, like I know...
2712000	2717000	I like to consider the holiday season starting on September 17th, but you know, that's just me.
2717000	2721000	Yeah, I have to mention, of course, Grand Theft Auto 5...
2721000	2723000	Which you haven't played yet.
2723000	2728000	But I recognize that a lot of people are gonna call that the game of the year, and that's...
2728000	2738000	I don't think it's in the show world tonight, but those Spike TV award things that they announce a lot of games at, which I think are irrelevant, but a lot of people seem to care...
2738000	2742000	They did announce their game of the year picks, right? And I know both those games we just made.
2742000	2744000	Mario 3D World's in there, and Grand Theft Auto's in there.
2744000	2746000	Yeah, Last of Us, and some other stuff.
2746000	2750000	Which, again... Oh, Bioshock Infinite, all the way back in February.
2750000	2757000	So, is Mario 3D World a better game than that? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
2757000	2758000	It's a popularity contest.
2758000	2767000	It is a little bit. And then I saw Tomb Raider in there too, which was a pleasant surprise. I think Tomb Raider's great, and a good kick in the butt for the franchise, so I was happy to see that in there.
2767000	2772000	Did anybody else remember what else was in there? Maybe our chatters do. Live.vognetwork.com.
2772000	2776000	They're supposed to have a trailer for Fallout 4, that's the rumor.
2776000	2786000	It'll be interesting to see what trailers do come out. We got some big game reveals at these awards, even though I'm kind of in whatever on the Spike Awards.
2786000	2794000	I always like to look at YouTube the next day, because there's a lot of trailers. Skyrim was announced at one of those. I remember that. That was a pretty big deal.
2794000	2796000	Little did we know.
2797000	2807000	Oh my god, there's so many. That's kind of one of the reasons I'm like, do I really want to start Fallout New Vegas? Because Skyrim, holy shit, did that take off a lot of my time.
2807000	2821000	Speaking of those games, Loki, when they inevitably announce Elder Scrolls VI for next generation consoles, will you be on board? Oh no, you'll be like, eh, it's on PC. I can mod it on PC.
2822000	2826000	Yeah, I might actually... I don't blame you. I don't blame you.
2826000	2837000	I mean, they have a lot of games that are coming out that are comparing them to that, like The Witcher 3. I don't know if Thief has so much open world, but there's a lot of sandbox games like that.
2837000	2842000	But, it's hard.
2842000	2851000	Tigerclaw having that same thought at live.vognetwork.com. What if they announce Elder Scrolls VI for next gen? Not before the next Fallout, because it kind of seems like they're going in that pattern.
2851000	2858000	Elder Scrolls VI is not coming for another couple years at least. Because they have also online, which is at some point.
2858000	2869000	Which I think is good news, because I think they need some time to, you know, again, the games that came out right during the launch window, little bit not the full potential of the system.
2869000	2877000	I think the more time that Elder Scrolls VI has to incubate a little bit, I think that's actually a good thing. We don't want it right away. Trust me, it's a good thing.
2877000	2890000	So, there is that part of me, and here is where I run into Best Buy or Target and throw myself on the counter to get a Playstation 4 or Xbox One.
2890000	2896000	Anyone know the big announcement trailer to get me to throw myself on the counter? Mass Effect 4.
2897000	2903000	Because you know it's just a matter of time before the details start coming out on that, and that is...
2903000	2905000	What if it's current gen too?
2905000	2906000	Mass Effect 4?
2906000	2911000	Yeah, what if it's current gen? Because there's a good chance that will be current gen as well.
2911000	2919000	Although it is stupid EA, and they will try to, you know, try to do that. Because it works so well for an NBA Live 14.
2919000	2931000	That's a very good question. I don't think it will. But you're right, it could happen, and I think we also need to consider the fact that there's tons of people who play those games on PCs and are perfectly happy.
2931000	2937000	I play Mass Effect 3 multiplayer on PC myself, and it's great. So I could just keep the PC.
2938000	2948000	I think for me though, having that graphic... My first experience with Mass Effect was on the Xbox 360, so I still associate in my mind with consoles.
2948000	2954000	I just kind of think for me Mass Effect 4 is only going to sweeten the pot for the next gen consoles.
2954000	2962000	It's not really going to be the reason I get a Playstation 4 or Xbox One or whatever, but I'm just going to add that to the list of why.
2962000	2967000	Just put that in all caps there in the Pro column. Mass Effect 4 right there.
2967000	2978000	I'm saying Mass Effect 4, but whatever they end up calling it, because obviously the Shepard series is over. You all know what I meant.
2978000	2987000	Let's see, going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com. BlackWolf says, I just don't want to see Sky on a table. Well then don't come to the mall with me.
2988000	2994000	Alright, let's get into some housekeeping and then we'll do gaming news of course.
2994000	2998000	Just real quick, don't forget you can follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2998000	3007000	We are also available on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google Plus. Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.
3007000	3010000	We finally got one of those short URLs like a lot of people are getting now.
3010000	3014000	Also, I think this is something we're going to do starting this week.
3014000	3019000	Finally, thanks to Jason's help, I was able to get the keys to the YouTube channel back.
3019000	3023000	So we are going to look at posting episodes of Orange Lounge Radio on YouTube.
3023000	3029000	We're not Orange Lounge Video all of a sudden, so that is not something that's going to be there.
3029000	3039000	It will just be the audio with a static picture. Maybe at a later date we could, if we talk about screenshots we can enhance the videos of that or something.
3039000	3047000	It depends how well received the YouTube thing is. This is just a crazy experiment we have to try to get the show out to more people.
3047000	3051000	Because YouTube does have a very big audience, I think the show can get more exposure.
3051000	3055000	So hello to all you YouTubers and thanks for checking out the show.
3055000	3062000	Depending on how well the show is received on YouTube we might see what else we can kind of do to enhance the show that way.
3062000	3066000	But yeah, right now it's just about trying to get the show out there.
3066000	3073000	And plus the news that YouTube is coming to things like the 3DS, YouTube is available on the Vita.
3073000	3078000	Anything that is another way that people can easily listen to OLR we want to get in on that.
3078000	3085000	So that is coming, I think starting this week. I think this very episode will go up on YouTube if everything goes in my favor.
3085000	3086000	So there we go.
3086000	3090000	Alright, let's move on.
3090000	3095000	Tigerclaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, you ever played around with Google Hangout? Yes.
3095000	3100000	Perhaps you can try doing OLR with it. It would archive to YouTube. No.
3100000	3108000	I'm going to be honest, and maybe I'm just being a stickler with this. This isn't interesting to watch.
3108000	3112000	We're all just sitting around a table with our microphones in hand.
3112000	3115000	No, I'm not interested in watching any of this.
3115000	3118000	It's really not that interesting to watch.
3118000	3125000	And I would need a director to sit here with us if we were to push video to its full potential.
3125000	3131000	I guess my point I'm trying to get at is, if we make that jump to video, I kind of don't want it to be half-assed.
3131000	3136000	I want somebody to actually be able to, if we talk about a game, throw up the b-roll footage of the game.
3136000	3141000	Be able to show that there. And that's just kind of too much for us to be able to put out right now.
3141000	3148000	I think, and I've been on this show for many, I think this show is best consumed, listen to it in the background,
3148000	3153000	while you play video games, or while you chat in our chat room, or while you're at work doing whatever,
3153000	3157000	you know, data entry or writing or whatever it is you do that doesn't require you to be listening at work right now.
3157000	3164000	I think our show is best consumed that way. I think if you were to sit here and watch Talking Heads for three hours,
3164000	3167000	talk about video games, that would be the most boring thing in the world to me.
3167000	3172000	But that's just my thought. Convince me I'm wrong, and maybe I am just being stubborn,
3172000	3178000	and keep in mind I've done radio for the past ten plus years, so this just might be my old fuddy-duddy way of thought.
3178000	3183000	Convince me I'm wrong, I'm all ears. I've been wrong before, lord knows.
3183000	3192000	So, alright. Let's get into gaming news tonight, now that that's all out of the way.
3192000	3194000	One hour in.
3195000	3201000	Here's the thing, and now I'm worried about this, I've probably offended some people who do do the Talking Heads thing,
3201000	3206000	and it's like, I'm not trying to offend people, it's just the whole thing where it's like,
3206000	3212000	I just, for me, and the show we're trying to produce, I just don't think that's particularly interesting. For me.
3212000	3216000	For us. For this show. Other people pulled off eloquently.
3216000	3221000	You do what works for you, and I will say this, Google Hangout is a great way to produce a podcast.
3221000	3228000	Super easy. Super easy. And I am all for more voices getting out there, and more people being heard.
3228000	3232000	So if Google Hangouts the way you do that, go for it. Absolutely.
3232000	3240000	So, I will brace myself for the angry emails I'm sure to incur from all that, but know that I am trying to be well-intentioned.
3240000	3242000	Alright, Loki.
3242000	3250000	Alright, so, like with any console launch, there's a little bit of hiccups usually with, well, usually with console launches,
3250000	3258000	and that was definitely the case with the PlayStation 4, with the random blinking blue light of Doom, or whatever you want to call it.
3258000	3264000	Well, now the Xbox One is also running the similar issues, except no blinking lights this time around.
3264000	3272000	Instead, it's the Soundra. Yes, much like the Xbox 360, except at least it's not actually, you know,
3272000	3280000	carving a nice ring into your disc this time. It's just making a grinding noise, and not reading discs.
3280000	3291000	And so people are running into those quite a bit, and it's kind of interesting because, you know, the reports seem to be all over the place,
3291000	3299000	and a lot of people are talking about it, and even, you know, there's some articles saying that they've received, you know, hundreds of tips regarding it.
3299000	3308000	So, I don't know. Once again, I mean, the console's only been out a few days, so it's hard to say how widespread anything is,
3308000	3315000	but I think it's important for Microsoft at this point to do kind of some damage control.
3315000	3319000	I think, you know, because I saw their response, which is basically, you know,
3319000	3325000	hey, if you have an issue with your system, call the customer support, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3325000	3338000	OK, that's very, I don't know, that's very scripted of you to say that, and instead of dressing, you know, how many units might be affected,
3338000	3348000	versus, you know, last week when the similar situation was happening where different systems were, you know, breaking or DOA from Sony,
3348000	3355000	you heard, you know, the top Sony execs come out and say, hey, listen, OK, we've received, you know, reports from people,
3355000	3362000	you know, saying that their systems are bad, you know, based on what we've shipped out so far, it's affecting less than 1% of our systems,
3362000	3368000	and, you know, just to let you know that we are replacing those systems immediately and expediting them to customers.
3368000	3376000	I think right there that's addressing everything instead of, you know, not commenting on it and letting everyone speculate how bad the issue is,
3376000	3384000	and I'm worried that, I mean, and I don't want to sound doom and gloom, but I'm worried that it may be a little bit more widespread than it seems.
3384000	3393000	Hopefully it's not, because I would hope that, you know, they would test their hardware, you know, well and figure out that these problems,
3393000	3403000	hopefully, you know, some sort of bad run on these disk drives or something, but be wary at console launches that you're going to run into issues.
3404000	3411000	Kind of a fair warning for any console launch that there's going to be speed bumps.
3411000	3415000	But we don't think this is as bad as the Red Ring of Death yet.
3415000	3420000	So far, yeah, not as big of an issue, but we'll see. Time will tell.
3420000	3427000	You know, and really, once again, you know, it's, see how they respond to it, how, you know, how they,
3427000	3432000	I think it would be nice if they came out and, you know, said something similar to what Sony said, where it's like,
3432000	3439000	hey, listen, it's only this, it's not a widespread thing. We've only received, you know, you know, it's 0.04% or whatever,
3439000	3444000	you know, compared to the system, you know, it's within standards. This is what, you know, we were expecting.
3444000	3449000	I just wish there was more coming from them other than very scripted, you know.
3449000	3451000	To be fair, this is what we were expecting.
3451000	3452000	Well, no.
3452000	3454000	Is it going to work if I'm one of those people?
3454000	3460000	Not what we're expecting, but it's within regular electronics yields as far as defectives go.
3460000	3465000	I mean, it's such a low percentage that, you know, it's with...
3465000	3468000	It sounds like they're making it easy, at least, on the Microsoft side. I don't know about Sony's side,
3468000	3473000	but on the Microsoft side, they just kind of, they just ship you a new one, and then you have to ship the old one back in two weeks,
3473000	3474000	or you get charged.
3474000	3475000	That's what they're doing, yeah.
3475000	3476000	They make it easy, yeah.
3476000	3478000	That's easier than the 360 replacement was, to be honest.
3478000	3482000	Yeah, and that's great. I'm glad that they're doing that, and I think that's what they need to do,
3482000	3484000	but at the same time, I think that they need to...
3484000	3490000	Especially, come on, Microsoft, you need to know, like, after all of the fallout and stuff from...
3490000	3497000	Even when you're announcing the Xbox One stuff, I think you need to talk more to your customers more directly,
3497000	3501000	and not sound like it's some scripted PR thing. Make it more candid, I guess.
3501000	3505000	Interesting, kind of two good comments in the chat room, but a little different.
3505000	3507000	Gene at Live.vognetware.com says,
3508000	3512000	Damage control will freak out and make it a bigger deal, though.
3512000	3513000	It could have that effect where...
3513000	3515000	It didn't seem like that was the effect, though.
3515000	3517000	The media would pick up on that.
3517000	3518000	Tao says,
3524000	3526000	But they're just not... I mean, all they're doing is just saying,
3526000	3529000	hey, you have a defective system, contact customer support.
3529000	3533000	I could have figured that out without reading anything from them.
3533000	3536000	It's not like, oh, well, shit, I don't know what to do with this console.
3536000	3541000	I mean, come on, if you buy an Xbox console, you know what to do with your console if it's gonna be broken.
3541000	3546000	I'm just saying, because, you know, especially if you bought it launched last year.
3546000	3548000	Or, not last year, last time around.
3548000	3552000	All right, well, to be fair, you know, we were talking about Xbox One problems,
3552000	3555000	but PlayStation 4 also had problems, so let's talk about those.
3555000	3561000	And Sony talked about, in an interview with Engadget this week, exactly where those numbers are at,
3561000	3563000	which Loki referred to a minute ago.
3574000	3576000	So that's almost exactly what you were saying, Loki.
3577000	3580000	We understand the frustration of consumers that have had a problem,
3580000	3583000	and are working with them and our retail partners to help troubleshoot issues,
3583000	3585000	and ensure affected units are exchanged.
3585000	3591000	So, you know, I really don't know how they can give you a better answer than that.
3591000	3595000	Although, again, if I'm one of those 1%, I'm still not gonna be happy.
3595000	3599000	But, I mean, I guess, what else can they do? If there's a problem, there's a problem.
3599000	3602000	I mean, who's actually happy about defective electronics? Nobody.
3602000	3606000	But, you know, I think about it, you know, it's really not just video game consoles.
3606000	3610000	I mean, iPhones are kind of notorious for having a lot of problems, too.
3610000	3615000	Like, the frickin' switches, like, on my first iPhone 5, that little switch.
3615000	3619000	Or what was it? Something broke. Oh, my sleep button, that's what it was.
3619000	3621000	The sleep button stopped clicking.
3621000	3626000	You know, those things start breaking pretty easy, and I wasn't using my phone for anything too strenuous.
3626000	3631000	So, you know, it's not like only game consoles are broken all the time,
3631000	3637000	but it's still irritating. Luckily, Apple had a pretty good program where I called, went to the Apple store.
3637000	3639000	Guy looked at my thing and said, yep, we're gonna give you a new one.
3639000	3643000	Gave me a new one, and boop, just switched it right out. Pretty painless.
3643000	3646000	So, we detected water damage on that. We're not gonna...
3646000	3650000	Well, luckily, I didn't have that problem. They were pretty cool about it.
3650000	3656000	So, I usually find that if you're nice to them, they're nice to you, but I guess it really depends on who you get. I don't know.
3656000	3660000	Jason's gonna be doing some stories for us tonight, since Jamie's not here.
3660000	3668000	I am, and easily, per the organization, you don't even have to change the initial, because Jason and Jamie start with the same letter.
3668000	3676000	Perhaps a relic of back when the Xbox was still a check-in every 24 hours if the system is offline,
3676000	3685000	achievements will not unlock if you're playing a game while it's offline, presumably also if your internet connection's down, anything along those lines.
3686000	3694000	The common consensus is just that this is simply a holdover for achievement verification on the web, and not some kind of...
3694000	3700000	It'd be nice if this were some kind of, like, a buying achievement deterrent or something of the sort,
3700000	3705000	but it's more likely just that it fell within the same expectations of the system always being online.
3705000	3709000	One of the really fun things with this article is that...
3709000	3716000	So this was an article, this was an announcement posted on Xbox 360 achievements that when they realized that I was playing one game,
3716000	3722000	I got achievements for another one, because apparently their internet connection had died for some period of time.
3722000	3728000	And so they linked to a help article on support.xbox.com, and I thought this was...
3728000	3733000	I guess I've always known that we've been headed in this direction, but it makes me laugh and cry equal amounts.
3733000	3740000	If you get no gamer score earned from app achievements, the prescribed resolution says,
3740000	3748000	you can earn app achievements for basic use of an app, such as watching a movie on Netflix, at the app developer's discretion.
3748000	3753000	App achievements do not affect gamer score, though they may bring other in-app awards.
3753000	3759000	Emphasis more on the award and less the score, but the whole...
3760000	3763000	Games have parodied this with a press start achievement.
3763000	3769000	Well, this stuff is starting to go into things that don't have anything to do with gaming at all.
3769000	3774000	I'm going to give you a great example. Target, the store, has a brand new app on iPhone,
3774000	3777000	probably on Android too, I can't imagine why it wouldn't be. It's called Cartwheel.
3777000	3779000	It's like their new little coupon thing, right?
3779000	3785000	And you go into this big Target database that they have of all these coupons, and you add them to your barcode.
3785000	3787000	You have to have a Facebook, I think, to sign up for it.
3787000	3790000	And you put all the little coupons on your thing, right?
3790000	3794000	And then you have your barcode, and they scan your phone at the store, and you get money back with it.
3794000	3803000	But here's the thing. You get achievements, little achievements in Cartwheel that give you more slots to put more coupons on.
3803000	3810000	I shit you not. So you link up with a Facebook friend, ka-ching! Achievement unlocked, and you get one more coupon slot.
3810000	3815000	So all I'm saying with that is that this whole thing, gaming achievements and everything, the app achievements,
3815000	3823000	it is now something Grandma uses to save money at Target. That's what achievements have become.
3823000	3832000	I mean, I get it, and Foursquare very largely pioneered a lot of this with its badges, and just the continued increase of them.
3832000	3841000	And there was also a camera app, not terribly unlike Instagram in 2009, that when Game Center and Custom Achievement integration first hit,
3842000	3852000	they would give you achievements and scores for filterless and filtered photos and all of these other snazzy framing and other things that you can do with the app.
3852000	3860000	I get it, and on a game console, if there's actually a merit to the reward, sure, but I... I don't know.
3860000	3866000	The generation's here. It's finally starting. Whatever. Just made me laugh and also cry.
3866000	3873000	All right. Some people in chat are asking questions here. Let's see. Tigerclaw says,
3873000	3877000	Yeah, that does sound weird. What if they give you achievement for watching certain movies?
3877000	3882000	What if you unlock an achievement of a movie you didn't want people to know you... which cause?
3882000	3886000	I don't know where the grammar went there. One is a guilty pleasure and afraid to tell anyone.
3886000	3891000	My assumption is certain things could be private by default, or in the case of the cartwheel thing,
3892000	3899000	I was just scanning through what the deepest discounts were, so I was looking at everything, and one of the things that came up was panties.
3899000	3907000	So I could save on panties if I want, but it was marked with a little padlock, and I was like, what does that mean? Oh, it's private.
3907000	3914000	So if I'm buying women's panties, I'm not going to have to answer that question with my friends who see that I'm using the app to save money.
3914000	3916000	Rob, why are you buying women's panties?
3916000	3921000	You watched Jersey Shore behind the scenes. A hundred points for your lost sanity.
3923000	3929000	So I would imagine certain things would be private, or you could lock away, or what have you, so there you go.
3929000	3936000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat wants to remind you, VOG gives achievements. That's right, our lovely network, vognetwork.com.
3936000	3941000	Gamified with the achievements, it's true. And now, in case you haven't heard me pimp this enough,
3941000	3947000	that whole gamification is turning into prizes. If you haven't checked that out, the raffle at vognetwork.com.
3947000	3952000	We're giving away cards against humanity this month. Next month we're giving away. Tune in next week to find out.
3952000	3956000	I finally got my first comment-based achievement on VOG Network the other day.
3956000	3957000	Did you?
3957000	3963000	Yeah, I don't comment too terribly much, but I was posting addendums and explaining things on a previous episode,
3963000	3968000	and I got enough cumulative likes that I'm finally starting to get some loot for the task.
3969000	3979000	Blackwolf in chat says, the app achievements are general. They're like, watch ten videos about your favorite team in the NFL app, not watch ten videos about the Jacksonville Jaguars.
3982000	3983000	Good.
3983000	3988000	I think I saw a little shade there. Alright, anyway, so achievements, you have to get them online and all that.
3988000	3993000	I think there's some people out there that might be making a bigger deal out of this than it needs to be, because my thought is,
3993000	4000000	well, aren't achievements mostly an online thing anyway? I mean, I realize some people might be like-
4000000	4008000	No, I wouldn't say so. Like, for games that have an expansive multiplayer experience, more so than any other, sure,
4008000	4016000	but the majority of the games that I play that have single-player career, NHL, a good- maybe not so much NHL, I take that one back,
4016000	4021000	but most everything else that I've played, a good 70%, 80% of them are local.
4021000	4027000	But if you want to show off those achievements to anybody, you're going to have to connect online eventually, so it can talk to the server.
4027000	4029000	360 and Playstation 3 both do that today.
4029000	4030000	Sure.
4030000	4032000	So, I mean, I think-
4032000	4044000	It's the same group of people that complain, that were complaining about the 24-hour requirement because shoddy internet, internet instability, you know, not having broadband, yeah.
4044000	4051000	All right. So, looking at- Bobby really wants me to read this. He sent me a private message.
4051000	4057000	Please note, the Xbox One achievements seem to be a combination of achievements and rewards on the 360.
4057000	4066000	The rewards bring avatar items on the 360. On Xbox One, some of those zero-point achievements bring in-game badges and titles.
4066000	4072000	So, yeah, I mean, and that's kind of like the whole, you know, like I was talking about Cartwheel a minute ago.
4072000	4077000	You're not playing anything, but you're still getting those rewards for using it.
4077000	4081000	And I imagine even things like Twitch and so- because Twitch sent an email out.
4081000	4085000	They blasted all their broadcasters and said, hey, you can get achievements in our new app.
4085000	4096000	And maybe- and I'm making shit up here, but it would not be outside the realm of possibility that Twitch could be like, and if you were in these achievements, you can archive X more hours of video.
4096000	4102000	Or your videos will be saved for X many more hours. Or your YouTubes will export this much faster.
4102000	4110000	Or whatever they want to do. You can chat in this color. You know, they could- whatever little achievements they wanted to get, they could do.
4110000	4114000	And it wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility for their power users, quote unquote.
4114000	4120000	So, all right. Let's move on. Loki. Speaking of Twitch, right?
4120000	4123000	Yes. Speaking of Twitch, I mean-
4123000	4138000	It's- I just have to say, before you get into this, it's so fascinating to me how much that site is now really, like, we have mentioned that site easily 20 times more the past month than we did last year.
4138000	4148000	Like, it's- the way it's so integrated into gaming culture now fascinates me. And again, I'm gonna say this again, it really fascinates me. Nobody's competing with them.
4148000	4157000	Do they have patents I don't know about? I mean, I guess there's Ustream, but you don't hear Ustream as much as you hear about Twitch. Fascinates me.
4157000	4167000	I mean, I would say the only other thing I can think of that comes close is, like, YouTube. But that is obviously- YouTube's different as well. You know, it's more video on demand and-
4167000	4173000	Twitch, as most know, was born out of Justin TV. Justin TV is in the same class as Ustream.
4174000	4178000	They're all very general and they have incredibly diverse content and it's a very broad service.
4178000	4185000	Twitch did something incredibly significant for gaming. It just isolated it to gaming.
4185000	4195000	And that alone, and, you know, featured the biggest games that everybody goes into. Spectate, Dota, League of Legends, Starcraft, WoW to a lesser extent, Hearthstone now.
4196000	4203000	They did something that was very specific, perhaps because they started signing contracts with these big companies a year or two ago.
4203000	4211000	But they have a dedicated, significant gaming experience and now they are reaping the fruits of those contracts.
4212000	4222000	It's just fascinating to me. And I think I joked last week, maybe Microsoft should delay Twitch TV so they can launch their whole Skype broadcast or Skype game room.
4222000	4230000	You know, I'm really surprised nobody else is trying to kind of get in on that. But anyway, that's a whole other show.
4230000	4238000	Sorry, Loki, I didn't mean to derail you, but it fascinates me how much we're talking about this and how much of a gaming culture it is now.
4238000	4247000	Well, so, you know, like we've said before, and actually I think more talking about Nintendo even.
4247000	4256000	Just, you know, hey, look at all the bad things that could possibly happen with, you know, because we were talking about the whole SwapNo thing and now you're saying,
4256000	4265000	hey, well, you know, what's to stop somebody from showing their penis over the video chat on Nintendo Wii U?
4265000	4280000	Well, people found out that, hey, guess what, you know, a really cool thing that you can do with the PlayStation 4 is that you can stream stuff with that wonderful Playroom app that's on there.
4280000	4287000	So, you know, you can basically sit down in a room and have those little robots running around and stuff and you can almost create your own talk show.
4287000	4296000	That's what, like, some people have been doing is they've been sitting there filming themselves doing stupid shit within the Playroom app.
4296000	4308000	And, unfortunately, it only takes, you know, one person to realize, hey, you can stream stuff out of there to have someone else realize, hey, I can stream really nasty, weird shit from there and that's what happens.
4308000	4312000	So, Twitch has been trying to crack down on it.
4312000	4318000	You know, they're continuing, it says, we continue to moderate according to the terms of service, non-gaming content is not allowed.
4318000	4325000	Non-gaming content, if using PlayStation 4 Playroom, the content must be about games or gaming within our terms of service.
4325000	4329000	Thanks for understanding. Discussing gaming is gaming content.
4329000	4332000	There are numerous such channels on Twitch such as One More Game.
4333000	4343000	However, what does not fall under the terms of service would be some dude having sex with his girlfriend on a couch in the middle of the Playroom app.
4343000	4349000	You know what? Twitch had to have a way to deal with this anyway, though, because you could do all that shit on a PC if you wanted with your webcam.
4349000	4365000	So, it's not like this is a foreign territory for Twitch to have to deal with, but, certainly, the PlayStation 4 and it broadening the Twitch community like that maybe is kind of the interesting element of this.
4365000	4374000	The unfortunate thing about, I really hope they don't disable Playroom for streaming, because just like I talked about the Google Plus thing earlier is a great way to get your foot in the door.
4375000	4382000	I think, and I think it's really fun when there's a lot of people, you know, part of what I like about this show too is that we're all in the same room, we all get to react to each other and so forth.
4382000	4392000	I think it would be awesome if people could do like broadcasts on Twitch through Playroom where they're all in the same room and, you know, confiding with each other and gesturing at each other and all that.
4392000	4406000	There was one example of that. There was someone doing a show called The Spartan Show and they were sitting down at a desk and they were talking about, you know, the PlayStation 4 and stuff and I think they were even taking Skype calls on a computer that was in there and they had like the setup and stuff.
4406000	4415000	So, that's kind of cool. Having sex with somebody or in this case, you know, there was one that's like some guy motorboating somebody in a horse head mask.
4415000	4419000	Not, that's a little weird, but.
4419000	4421000	Hasn't that happened on this show, though?
4421000	4423000	Not a horse head mask yet.
4423000	4426000	Maybe not a horse head mask, but I'm pretty sure one of the times.
4426000	4427000	Motorboating has probably happened.
4427000	4430000	Motorboating has definitely happened on this show.
4430000	4435000	I'm like, all those times Princess Irene has been here, I know motorboating has happened on this show.
4435000	4440000	Is this when I interject and say that Bobby Blackwell was just a little bit ahead of his time?
4440000	4442000	Friday Night Gaming?
4442000	4443000	Friday Night Gaming.
4443000	4447000	That was pre-Twitch. I'm fairly confident the entire age of that show.
4447000	4449000	He was doing it on Ustream, the other site.
4450000	4458000	Anyway, so outside of this crazy stuff, something of course that's being worked in right now is archiving.
4458000	4461000	They're planning on doing it for the Playstation 4.
4461000	4466000	Considering for the Xbox One, I think probably just right now because the Xbox One Twitch service hasn't launched yet.
4466000	4469000	So, once that does, we'll see what, you know, the feasibility of all that stuff.
4469000	4472000	I'm sure that they're going to have archiving on both sides at some point.
4472000	4478000	And of course, like I mentioned, the Xbox One does not have the Twitch service that launched and that is coming later on.
4478000	4480000	Sometime in the first part of 2014.
4483000	4484000	Yeah.
4484000	4488000	Alright. Lots of news with that. It's getting to be very social.
4488000	4492000	You know, there was an interesting Twitter discussion that happened this week.
4492000	4497000	And it was kind of about somebody was basically saying, like, what's the big fucking deal about game streaming?
4497000	4501000	I'm paraphrasing here really bad, but what's the big fucking deal about game streaming?
4501000	4504000	Like, do people really watch that stuff?
4505000	4508000	And I would say the answer is obviously yes.
4508000	4516000	And it's even getting bigger with all this in, you know, kind of enrichments into the Playstation 4 and Xbox One.
4516000	4519000	But the question was more like, you know, well, why?
4519000	4524000	Why do people watch other people play games when you can be playing them themselves?
4524000	4530000	And I respect that position because I was there myself just a couple years ago, maybe even last year.
4530000	4532000	And I'm sure I've said that on this show.
4532000	4535000	Why the hell would I livestream when I can play something myself?
4535000	4541000	But I have found through trying it and kind of getting into other people's streams
4541000	4545000	and seeing more and more of my friends easily be able to livestream.
4545000	4549000	It's, you know, it's so easy on Playstation 4 and helping friends of mine be able to stream.
4549000	4554000	It's somewhat the modern day equivalent of being able to go plop down next to somebody on the couch.
4554000	4556000	Whatcha doin'?
4556000	4558000	Even across, like, long distances.
4558000	4560000	Because that's almost like what it's become.
4560000	4565000	Like, Xtaphir might be streaming Resogun one night and I can just virtually go plop on him next to the couch.
4565000	4568000	Whatcha doin'? Whatcha playin'? How you doin'? You're dyin'.
4568000	4573000	You know, it's like kind of the modern equivalent of that in a way.
4573000	4575000	I think for me it's like, why?
4575000	4577000	You know, for some people they get to see the best of the best.
4577000	4579000	They might have some other reasons too.
4579000	4584000	But, you know, for me I just love the fact that there's people that would even want to watch it.
4584000	4590000	And I can make something that can be a single player experience sometimes be more social.
4590000	4597000	A friend of mine was streaming a bunch of fighting games, which normally I've been to a couple fighting game tournaments in my area.
4597000	4600000	Yeah, okay, I haven't played a fighting game in a really long time.
4600000	4603000	But then he switched to Divekick.
4603000	4607000	That game is completely frickin' fascinating.
4607000	4609000	And I'm mildly obsessed with it now.
4610000	4614000	I know him, I have known him for a number of years, so I was just kind of coming in to socialize.
4614000	4621000	I've heard how good he is at Persona 3 Arena, so I was just kind of seeing what he's up to and seeing the other games he wants to play.
4621000	4626000	And just happenstance, I saw a new game that I literally never heard about before that day.
4626000	4633000	And now every time I see it, it's just so simple on the face, yet so incredibly deep.
4633000	4637000	And just a very, you know, Divekick is unlike any other fighting game out there.
4637000	4640000	So it was just a good, random occurrence.
4667000	4669000	Dan at Live.vongnetwork.com says,
4669000	4674000	I told my wife, this is like my football. That's why I watch people stream games.
4674000	4682000	And now that these apps are showing up on TVs and the devices and so forth, you watch it almost the same way you watch football now.
4682000	4685000	Instead of a cable box, it's an Xbox One box.
4685000	4687000	Is that redundant? Xbox One box?
4687000	4688000	Mildly.
4688000	4689000	Mildly redundant.
4689000	4695000	Doomplaig says, some games are really fun to watch, particularly open world type games like Grand Theft Auto.
4696000	4701000	This wasn't particularly a big one, but imagine the modern equivalent of Geometry Wars.
4701000	4707000	Incredible twitch action, you know, once your brain can actually adapt to everything that's going on.
4707000	4710000	It turns into a very fun spectator event incredibly quickly.
4710000	4713000	MaskedBishop in the chatroom says,
4713000	4716000	When live streaming on the next gen consoles, can you see your viewer count?
4716000	4719000	Well, we don't know about Xbox One just yet, because that app's not out.
4719000	4721000	But on PlayStation 4, yes.
4721000	4726000	When you do the whole little, like, where it has the side and the bottom bar and it kind of shrinks the screen just slightly,
4726000	4729000	you can actually see how many people are watching the stream.
4729000	4733000	And it also counts how many chat lines have been spoken so far, which is interesting.
4733000	4735000	You can see how active your chatroom is.
4735000	4739000	But you can also see at the very bottom, you see the last two lines of chat.
4739000	4743000	Which, if you don't have a lot of people watching, you can probably stay on top of very easy.
4743000	4748000	But imagine if you're one of the more popular broadcasters, and you wouldn't be able to stay on top of the chat that way.
4748000	4749000	So I don't know.
4749000	4752000	20 messages a second? That thing will never stop moving.
4752000	4754000	That would be tough, so I don't know.
4754000	4759000	But I think a lot of people probably don't interact with their chatrooms as much if you get that many comments,
4759000	4762000	because it's just impossible to stay on top of, so.
4762000	4764000	Alright, anyhow, let's move on.
4764000	4767000	Sorry, we're running really long tonight, but hey, it's one of those nights.
4767000	4772000	I guess we dabble on this a little earlier in the show, but I want to talk about it a little more now.
4772000	4776000	This is about Nintendo talking about their Wii U lineup for 2014.
4777000	4782000	Basically, in an interview with Game Trailers, Reggie Fils-Aime, who of course is Nintendo of America's president,
4782000	4787000	said that there will not be a Wii U software drought like we saw in 2013.
4787000	4789000	Here it is, quote,
4789000	4795000	The way we're going to be different is, we're going to certainly have a steadier pace of games, both for Wii U and for 3DS.
4795000	4799000	The marketing activity is going to be constant throughout the entire year.
4799000	4803000	You tease me a little bit that, boy, the first half of 2013 was a little quiet.
4803000	4805000	And you know what, you look back and it was.
4805000	4808000	We're not going to be making that same mistake in 2014.
4808000	4809000	Hmm, admission.
4809000	4814000	So the pace, the ongoing activity, touching the consumer and messaging is what we're all about.
4814000	4817000	That's going to be a big difference next year.
4817000	4822000	I will say this, I went and saw Catching Fire on Friday, which by the way, amazing.
4822000	4825000	But they had a Wii U commercial, actually.
4825000	4831000	You know how they do, they do like the, this is the first look of the movies at the cinema.
4831000	4835000	Enjoy the, you know, basically the ads thrown at you while you're waiting for the movie to start.
4835000	4839000	Well, one of them was a big Wii U ad that actually was Mario 3D World.
4839000	4842000	And I laughed at it because it had a girl in a cat suit.
4842000	4845000	And I was like, this is like some weird furry action going on here.
4845000	4849000	No offense to furries, but it was just a little weird to see that in the commercial and so forth.
4849000	4850000	I was just laughing.
4850000	4851000	And it even said, out now.
4851000	4854000	And I was like, wow, that commercial must have just come out today.
4854000	4859000	Just in time for Catching Fire, which, you know, is obviously doing huge box office this weekend.
4859000	4860000	But I digress.
4860000	4864000	So Nintendo is trying to get the word out there in other ways, for sure.
4864000	4866000	So they have the movie ads, if nothing else.
4866000	4870000	But Reggie promising you're not going to see that same drought.
4870000	4875000	Well, I bet that's why Donkey Kong and Mario Kart 8 aren't coming out right now.
4875000	4877000	I think that's a huge part of it.
4877000	4879000	I think the Donkey Kong delay was strategical.
4879000	4882000	I don't think it had anything to do with the game not being done.
4882000	4889000	I think Mario Kart maybe needed a little more tweaks, because pushing that all the way back to April is quite a ways, maybe further.
4889000	4895000	But I think the Donkey Kong's now what? February? I think that is a strategical delay.
4895000	4898000	I think you didn't want to have two platformers out back to back.
4898000	4903000	And Mario 3D World is so damn good, you don't want to release Donkey Kong at the same time.
4903000	4906000	And then it's like, oh yeah, there's two good platformers.
4906000	4908000	It's because there's not a lot of Wii U titles coming out.
4908000	4909000	Yeah.
4909000	4911000	Seriously, there's not a lot of Wii U titles coming out.
4911000	4915000	So when Reggie talks about this whole, there's not going to be a drought, are you saying?
4915000	4916000	He's full of shit.
4916000	4917000	He's full of shit.
4917000	4925000	He's absolutely 100% full of shit, because here are the games coming out in February on the Wii U.
4925000	4928000	The Lego Movie and Donkey Kong.
4928000	4933000	So, does that sound like full of shit to me? That sounds like a whole heap of shit.
4933000	4937000	Could there be stuff we just don't know about yet?
4937000	4942000	Because, let's be real, they cranked out that Zelda Wind Waker HD thing fast.
4942000	4947000	Could they have other little, I mean, and we've heard the rumors before about the 64 revisited.
4947000	4950000	I don't remember what the, what the hell did they call that?
4950000	4951000	I even read that article.
4951000	4954000	I think I joked it was Wii U Imagine, like they call RuPaul's Drag Race or something.
4954000	4957000	It was something similar to that, but you know what I'm talking about, right?
4957000	4958000	Wii U Imagine.
4958000	4959000	Wii U Imagine or something.
4959000	4963000	Could that be something that's in their pocket that they haven't quite played those cards yet?
4964000	4968000	I don't think that they've, they've already announced their first quarter stuff.
4968000	4974000	I'm sorry, they have one other title in, so they have a title in January.
4974000	4977000	They are one of the only Wii U titles in January.
4977000	4982000	It's Wii Fit U, but it's a disc-based version for the game that's out already right now.
4982000	4987000	So that doesn't, I don't really count that because you could get it right now.
4987000	4992000	But yes, disc-based version of Wii Fit U will be out in January.
4993000	4995000	But come on, it's just...
4995000	4997000	Which was supposed to be out this year, if I'm not mistaken.
4997000	4998000	It is out right now.
4998000	5000000	No, the disc was supposed to be out this year, wasn't it?
5000000	5002000	Yeah, that was pushed back.
5002000	5004000	But there is a drought.
5004000	5006000	They're third-party, there's not a whole ton of games coming out.
5006000	5009000	It's just like the Lego movie.
5009000	5012000	And that's it so far for February.
5012000	5014000	March, there's gonna be some stuff, but that's it.
5014000	5016000	Gene in chat brings up a good point.
5016000	5018000	Live.fognetwork.com.
5018000	5020000	PlayStation 4 and Xbox One drought, though.
5020000	5022000	Could those systems be...
5022000	5024000	Not for as long, period.
5024000	5026000	Launch window, whatever.
5026000	5029000	Well, I mean, at least we know...
5029000	5032000	Is Destiny first quarter, or is that further back?
5032000	5034000	We look at it somewhere for Destiny.
5034000	5037000	Right now, I think placeholder is first quarter.
5037000	5039000	Okay, but Titanfall is first quarter for sure, right?
5039000	5040000	Titanfall is March.
5040000	5044000	So, there's some things trickling in there, at least.
5044000	5046000	But, I mean, Gene could have a good point.
5046000	5047000	I mean, could the other system...
5047000	5050000	I mean, what do the other systems have that's so great?
5050000	5053000	Well, there's a lot of placeholder stuff right now.
5053000	5057000	And to be fair, Lego Movie is on all platforms.
5057000	5060000	So, there's that.
5060000	5063000	They do have some other titles.
5063000	5065000	You know, because I don't remember off the top of my head,
5065000	5067000	so I'm gonna actually go look.
5067000	5071000	But, I know a lot of the stuff I have right now is placeholder.
5071000	5074000	Thief is supposed to be pretty soon.
5074000	5076000	I don't know if that's still gonna be first quarter,
5076000	5079000	if that'll get pushed back.
5079000	5082000	I was gonna say...
5082000	5084000	I think, at least in PlayStation's camp,
5084000	5085000	I don't know so much about Xbox One,
5085000	5087000	but PlayStation's camp, they're teasing a lot of...
5087000	5088000	Infamous.
5088000	5089000	Well, they're teasing a lot of... Oh, yeah, Infamous.
5089000	5091000	Well, that's...
5091000	5093000	That's March, I think.
5093000	5095000	They're teasing a lot of, like, betas.
5095000	5096000	You know, there's the Destiny beta.
5096000	5098000	There's the Final Fantasy XIV beta.
5098000	5100000	There's the Elder Scrolls Online beta.
5100000	5102000	Like, they're kind of trying to fill in the gap with all these,
5102000	5104000	like, well, the games won't be out,
5104000	5106000	but all these awesome previews you're waiting for will be.
5106000	5109000	So, give or take that.
5109000	5111000	So, anyway.
5111000	5113000	Alright.
5113000	5116000	So, if you don't have any other games to report on,
5116000	5117000	we'll move over to the next story.
5117000	5118000	I'll look it up.
5118000	5119000	I'll talk about it in a release.
5119000	5120000	You work on that.
5120000	5122000	Moving on to Jason.
5122000	5123000	Leaving the consoles,
5123000	5126000	as this game has never made a release on one so far,
5126000	5129000	Step Evolution announces ReRave Plus Arcade.
5129000	5134000	I have not seen the current ReRave arcade game,
5134000	5136000	but I'm going to assume it's very similar
5136000	5139000	to the rest of the touch-based attractions
5139000	5141000	that Dave & Buster has.
5141000	5143000	So, it is a big 40-inch touchscreen
5143000	5145000	at about just above waist level
5145000	5149000	and a nice placard sign to advertise what the game is.
5149000	5152000	But at a trade show in just the last couple of days,
5152000	5156000	IAAPA, they announced ReRave Plus
5156000	5158000	with a new cabinet design.
5158000	5160000	Very similar to how a lot of other games,
5160000	5163000	notably DJ Max Technica, are going about it.
5163000	5166000	Standing cabinet, taller than you,
5166000	5168000	with a little miniature platform
5168000	5170000	where the subwoofer is that you step up onto.
5170000	5173000	You have the lean-in touchscreen that you go into play
5173000	5176000	and then a spectator's touchscreen above your face.
5176000	5182000	The improvements that come to ReRave Plus,
5182000	5185000	notably any graphical changes or song lists,
5185000	5190000	will be available for current ReRave arcade installations,
5190000	5193000	but this new cabinet will look a hell of a lot better
5193000	5195000	for people that want to plunk that money in again.
5195000	5199000	I've played ReRave a couple times just on my phone.
5199000	5201000	Probably more likely my iPad
5201000	5203000	because phone's a little bit difficult.
5203000	5206000	Just a quick overview of the game
5206000	5209000	is that you have touch targets with timing.
5209000	5211000	It is a music rhythm game.
5211000	5212000	You touch them at a particular time.
5212000	5213000	It's Elite Beat Agents.
5213000	5217000	It's Elite Beat Agents without the dancers.
5218000	5221000	It's been a really long time since I played that game.
5221000	5223000	It's virtually Elite Beat Agents.
5223000	5226000	The only difference is that you can kind of better see
5226000	5228000	when the things are going to hit with the clock formations,
5228000	5229000	but that's really it.
5229000	5231000	And multiple taps.
5231000	5232000	Didn't Elite Beat Agents have those?
5232000	5233000	No.
5233000	5235000	Okay, then it's DJ Max Technica.
5235000	5237000	I wouldn't make that comparison.
5237000	5239000	A combination of the two...
5239000	5241000	Anyways, ReRave Plus,
5241000	5245000	massive improvements for the arcade installations next year,
5245000	5246000	and it's a very pretty game.
5246000	5248000	I would like to see this in my local Dave & Busters
5248000	5252000	or elsewhere that I've been that I can't think even has games.
5252000	5255000	I loved and hated at the same time
5255000	5258000	how they have to make sure that it's going to be relevant
5258000	5260000	for an arcade by putting ticket spitting into it.
5260000	5262000	Yeah, I completely glossed over that
5262000	5264000	even though I commented on it when I was watching the video.
5264000	5266000	This is going to be the first touch attraction game
5266000	5268000	that I've seen that is a redemption game
5268000	5270000	and actually spews tickets.
5271000	5273000	And it's one of those things where it's like,
5273000	5275000	ah, gross, but then at the same time you're like,
5275000	5278000	well, it's actually a worthy game to do that kind of thing.
5278000	5280000	Well, but the reality is that's the only way
5280000	5283000	it's going to get into arcades, which sucks.
5283000	5284000	Don't hear me wrong.
5284000	5286000	Imagine if DDR gave tickets.
5286000	5288000	All those noobs getting their free song on Beginner
5288000	5290000	would get like one, but then everybody else
5290000	5292000	that plays the super hard songs,
5292000	5294000	hey, we just raped the whole machine of tickets.
5294000	5296000	I'd have a ton of fucking tickets, I just gotta tell you.
5296000	5298000	I would have a ton of fucking tickets.
5298000	5300000	Well, I think the way you would do it is that
5300000	5303000	you would still have a ticket spin at the end of the game,
5303000	5305000	but depending on how hard the difficulty was
5305000	5306000	is how big the jackpot is.
5306000	5308000	It should be for every step that you make
5308000	5310000	that's on a perfect song.
5310000	5313000	It's like spitting them out, like shooting out of there.
5314000	5315000	Don't trip.
5315000	5319000	And I stand corrected, there are a lot more delayed Wii U games.
5319000	5321000	I forgot about which, put it this way,
5321000	5323000	they're not that mentionable.
5323000	5327000	There's Jet Tail Fin Racers,
5327000	5330000	which is based off an iOS Android game.
5331000	5333000	Although there is Game of the Year contender
5333000	5336000	Hello Kitty Cruisers that got delayed.
5336000	5337000	It got delayed?
5337000	5338000	Yeah, it got delayed.
5338000	5339000	Fuckers.
5339000	5341000	So there's your drought.
5341000	5343000	So yeah, if you want to call it non-drought
5343000	5346000	by delaying games, yeah sure, why not.
5346000	5347000	Let's play that way.
5347000	5350000	There are some confirmed, like for example
5350000	5352000	Drive Club is supposed to be coming out in February
5352000	5356000	and also confirmed the Xbox One version
5356000	5359000	of Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare is gonna be coming out.
5359000	5360000	Oh, there you go.
5360000	5361000	Alright.
5361000	5365000	So, if you want to talk drought, look at January.
5365000	5369000	There is Wii Fit U and Dragon Ball Z Battle of Z.
5369000	5370000	That's it.
5370000	5373000	You could look at January almost every year
5373000	5374000	and it's the same story.
5374000	5375000	No it's not.
5375000	5376000	Really?
5376000	5377000	This is ridiculous.
5377000	5378000	Well I do remember one year,
5378000	5380000	when did Bioshock Infinite come out this year?
5380000	5381000	It was pretty early.
5381000	5384000	And then sometimes you get the Final Fantasy 13, 2.
5384000	5385000	13, 2 was January.
5385000	5388000	And now Lightning Returns I think is February or March, yeah.
5389000	5391000	But that's encouraging.
5391000	5394000	It's very unusual to have two games only.
5394000	5395000	In December it's also two games.
5395000	5397000	Gran Turismo 6 and then the Vita game.
5397000	5399000	But you were supposed to have the South Park game.
5399000	5400000	That didn't happen.
5400000	5401000	That would have only been three games.
5401000	5403000	A lot of the games left.
5403000	5406000	Alright, let's talk about what's coming out now
5406000	5408000	as we travel around the world and check out release dates.
5408000	5411000	Now this was a pretty lengthy segment in previous weeks
5411000	5414000	but as Loki's indicating it's gonna start to dry up a little bit
5414000	5417000	but let's see if there's anything for this week anyway.
5417000	5418000	Loki?
5418000	5419000	A little bit.
5419000	5422000	It's more like someone took a fucking ShamWow to this shit.
5424000	5428000	No seriously, this week there's a whole lot of nothing.
5428000	5432000	It's basically Ys Memory of Celceta
5432000	5434000	which is gonna be coming out on Vita.
5434000	5436000	One super late announcement.
5436000	5441000	Air Conflicts Vietnam on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
5442000	5446000	And I almost think that's it.
5446000	5449000	I'm trying to lick it real quick.
5449000	5455000	I know that Frozen pack for Disney Infinity is supposed to be coming out this week.
5455000	5457000	That was another one.
5457000	5461000	But yeah, it's sad.
5463000	5464000	God, is that it?
5464000	5466000	Atari Flashback 4?
5466000	5467000	That's coming out?
5467000	5468000	Oh really?
5468000	5470000	What's cool about the Flashback 4?
5470000	5471000	Fuck if I know.
5471000	5472000	I wanna know more about that.
5472000	5473000	Those consoles are pretty neat.
5473000	5474000	Let's see.
5474000	5475000	I love retro games.
5475000	5476000	What can I say?
5476000	5479000	Yeah, Disney Infinity, the Frozen Toy Box set in Power Disc Pack 2
5479000	5482000	is gonna be coming out now if you're into that shit.
5483000	5485000	Good Black Friday deals.
5485000	5486000	Oh, one very late one.
5486000	5491000	A Halo Origins bundle which is basically just a rebundling of the Halo Anniversary
5491000	5493000	and Halo Reach.
5493000	5496000	So that'll be coming out this week as well.
5497000	5502000	And Black Friday, there is gonna be some...
5502000	5505000	I know there's a new PlayStation 3 SKU for $1.99
5505000	5510000	that comes with The Last of Us and Batman Arkham Origins.
5510000	5511000	So that's pretty good.
5511000	5513000	Girls fashion shoot got delayed again.
5513000	5515000	So that's on 3DS.
5515000	5517000	And that is literally it.
5517000	5522000	Alright, let's travel to Japan where things are a little more active this week.
5522000	5525000	For PlayStation 3, you have Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag
5525000	5527000	being released in Japan on November the 28th.
5527000	5532000	Also, Shin Sangoku Musou 7 Moshuden comes out this week.
5532000	5536000	There's a lot of different versions of that limited edition.
5536000	5537000	That's Dynasty Warriors, isn't it?
5537000	5538000	I think it is.
5538000	5539000	Koei did that one.
5539000	5542000	So that's a pretty big release out there.
5542000	5550000	Also, Himawari no Kyokai no Nagai Natsu Yasumi Extra Vacation comes out this week.
5550000	5551000	Regular and limited edition.
5551000	5553000	That's, again, all PlayStation 3.
5553000	5558000	And Super Robot Taisen OG Infinite Battle comes out as well this week.
5558000	5561000	So pretty busy week on the PlayStation 3 in Japan.
5561000	5564000	Taking a look at the Xbox 360 in Japan,
5564000	5569000	we have just Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is it on the 360 in Japan.
5569000	5572000	So sounds like plenty more games coming out on the PlayStation 3 there,
5572000	5574000	but that's kind of the norm.
5574000	5579000	On the PlayStation Vita, Bitter Smile comes out this week in regular and limited edition.
5579000	5582000	Criminal Girls Invitation.
5582000	5585000	Invitation to what?
5585000	5586000	All sorts of criminal things.
5586000	5587000	That is the name of the game.
5587000	5589000	Criminal Girl Invitation.
5589000	5592000	And it's all these anime chicks in jail outfits.
5592000	5594000	This is cracking me up.
5594000	5596000	It's definitely some type of RPG.
5596000	5598000	I was going to say this is looking tactics-like.
5598000	5599000	It's got the whole hit points.
5599000	5601000	Not anymore it's not looking like tactics.
5601000	5602000	It's the hit points and magic points.
5602000	5604000	Is she spreading eagle in that shot?
5604000	5607000	This is for sick people.
5607000	5608000	I shouldn't say that.
5608000	5610000	All right.
5610000	5612000	Other releases in Japan.
5612000	5614000	Moving on beyond that.
5614000	5618000	Shing Sengoku Musou 7 comes out on the PlayStation Vita as well.
5618000	5625000	And White Album 2, Shiwase no Mukugawa comes out in Japan as well this week.
5625000	5629000	Pretty busy on the PlayStation Vita.
5629000	5633000	Looking at the Wii U quickly to see if there's anything this week.
5633000	5637000	Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag and Disney Infinity Toy Box Challenge.
5637000	5640000	I don't know if that's the initial release of Disney Infinity in Japan.
5640000	5642000	That's the 3DS one, yeah.
5642000	5645000	No, it's Wii U comes out in Japan this week.
5645000	5647000	That is the original.
5647000	5650000	So that's finally out in Japan this week it sounds like.
5650000	5653000	I guess they don't really have any content in there.
5653000	5656000	And on Nintendo 3DS they have that as well.
5656000	5659000	And this is exciting if you have a Japanese 3DS.
5659000	5662000	Hatsune Miku Project Mirai 2 comes out.
5662000	5666000	And there's all these little accessories to go with that if you're into that.
5666000	5667000	Surprise.
5667000	5673000	A new orange and black 3DS XL and a turquoise and black 3DS XL or as they call it over there, LL.
5673000	5675000	Couple other quick titles here.
5675000	5683000	Toriko Ultimate Survival, Pretty Rhythm Rainbow Live Kirikirami Design, and Kamen Rider come out this week.
5683000	5687000	And a whole hell of a lot of system and game accessories.
5687000	5689000	Yes, but that's nothing new for Japan.
5689000	5691000	How about the UK, Jason?
5691000	5697000	Alright, well unlike the Xbox One, Europe is just now getting its PlayStation 4.
5697000	5702000	So the lineup that we've come to know is just stacking up for this week in Europe.
5702000	5710000	Angry Birds Star Wars, Battlefield 4, Contrast, FIFA 14, Injustice Gods Among Us for both PlayStation 4 and Vita.
5710000	5720000	Madden NFL 25, Need for Speed Rivals, Putty Squad, that's Wii U, Super Motherload, the Pinball Arcade, and then Tiny Brains on the PlayStation 3.
5720000	5722000	Very quiet for the other systems.
5722000	5730000	Injustice Gods Among Us is of course cross platform, PS4, PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PS Vita as well I think I already mentioned.
5730000	5736000	And there was one more, I said Super Mario 3D World is coming to Wii U over there.
5736000	5738000	And that's pretty much it.
5738000	5743000	Definitely the PlayStation 4 week this week.
5743000	5747000	Alrighty, just a few more news stories for you guys than the classic game of the week.
5747000	5752000	Let's run through these quickly because we're running long part A here. So, Loki.
5752000	5755000	Alright, there's a brand new firmware for PlayStation 4.
5755000	5763000	System Update 1.51 that's going to make some, I guess, minor refinements to the system UI.
5763000	5770000	And also, I guess, indicating when a user is downloading a game and a game patch at the same time.
5771000	5775000	And I guess, wow that's really it.
5775000	5777000	System Stability.
5777000	5779000	So, yay patch!
5779000	5781000	As it goes with new releases.
5781000	5785000	Yeah, it's nice though that they're coming out pretty quick.
5785000	5789000	That's pretty fast since the release of the system so I guess that's kind of cool.
5789000	5795000	I wouldn't expect a major content right now but good that they're at least fixing some things.
5796000	5799000	One other story here about Tomb Raider.
5799000	5802000	And yes, there is a Tomb Raider sequel in development.
5802000	5808000	And this is because Crystal Dynamics' Senior Art Director Brian Horton was talking about this during a lecture.
5808000	5814000	And a statement that is grabbing some headlines was the fact that it was well financed.
5814000	5818000	But let me bring some clarity to that statement here.
5818000	5823000	There was a European trademark registered for Tomb Raider Reflections.
5823000	5825000	Could that be the sequel's title? Who knows.
5825000	5830000	But certainly when trademarks, people run wild with those, but that could be it.
5830000	5835000	Square has also confirmed that there's going to be a reveal in early December.
5835000	5837000	So possibly Spike TV.
5837000	5841000	This is one of the things that will be announced during the video game awards there.
5841000	5845000	And then during the UK's Bradford Animation Festival,
5845000	5851000	the aforementioned art director was taking some questions from the audience.
5851000	5854000	And he said in regards to the Tomb Raider sequel, quote,
5854000	5857000	We've announced the sequel. I'm glad I can finally talk about.
5857000	5860000	The Tomb Raider sequel is the next chapter of Laura's development.
5860000	5863000	Her life is changing. She can't go back to the way she was.
5863000	5867000	It seemed to recall they did announce the sequel after there was the whole, like,
5867000	5870000	there was the comic book that was being made and the comic book maker mentioned something.
5870000	5871000	So it kind of led to this.
5871000	5875000	But anyway, then a question was asked by the audience about, you know,
5875000	5879000	Square Enix had called the game a failure earlier this year,
5879000	5882000	which many of us looked at that and went, You guys smoking crap?
5882000	5884000	Because Tomb Raider is kind of awesome and it sold millions.
5884000	5886000	So what do you mean it's a failure?
5886000	5888000	Well, the reply from Brian Horton was, quote,
5888000	5892000	We don't talk about our budgets. It's a well-financed game.
5892000	5895000	We're not spending any more on a sequel than on the original game.
5895000	5899000	So I wouldn't take well-financed to mean like, Oh, they're just throwing money at it.
5899000	5902000	I think I would just take that to mean, Don't worry.
5902000	5905000	The game will come out and it will be like they're not going to cut corners.
5905000	5908000	And, you know, it's going to be a crappy quality because of that.
5908000	5910000	I think that's what they're trying to reassure people of.
5910000	5913000	So, um, the Tomb Raider reboot was great.
5913000	5917000	And I think if the sequel can kind of capture that magic, uh, I'm looking forward to it.
5917000	5920000	I would be interested in this. So I'm looking forward to the reveal.
5920000	5924000	I'm curious to see what they do with her now, because obviously the first one was,
5924000	5929000	was all kinds of scary and really had that like caves environment and all that.
5929000	5934000	So I'm curious, are they going to now do the whole like exotic worlds and that like,
5934000	5936000	will that be the, she'll become a pirate.
5936000	5940000	It'll be just like Assassin's Creed four or, or well charted Lara Croft edition,
5940000	5944000	or will it still be like super scary and, and the whole, like, you know,
5944000	5949000	as, as Jamie calls it on the show, the game called girl,
5950000	5955000	you know, will the sequel be girl who knows girl.
5956000	5959000	All right. So we'll see what happens with the two Raiders sequel, but, um,
5959000	5962000	they're, they're trying to reassure us.
5962000	5965000	It's taken care of and, and don't you worry.
5965000	5968000	You'll be hearing more on it soon. All right. Uh,
5968000	5972000	let's get to the classic game of the week because as you know,
5973000	5975000	every week here on orange lounge radio,
5975000	5978000	we asked stark soccer to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that she
5978000	5981000	thinks, Hey, you ungrateful brats,
5981000	5985000	put down your Xbox one and your PlayStation four and we use and go check out a
5985000	5988000	real classic this week. Yeah.
5988000	5991000	Definitely put that shit down. You don't even need a reason to put that out.
5991000	5995000	Yeah. All right. But dark soccer is not here tonight. So, uh, we invited, uh,
5995000	5998000	Jason to pick this week cause Jason's never got to pick the classic in the
5998000	6002000	week. I guess I can. You've done a lot for the show over the years.
6002000	6004000	So we kind of view this as a, a, a,
6004000	6008000	a present of sorts that you can pick the game of the week this week.
6008000	6009000	So Jason,
6009000	6012000	what have you picked tonight for the classic game of the week tonight?
6012000	6015000	I picked vets by spectrum Holobytes.
6016000	6018000	All right. And I just going to warn,
6018000	6020000	I'm going to warn people right off.
6021000	6024000	That is the noise with this game.
6024000	6026000	It uses like PC speaker, right?
6026000	6027000	Only PC speaker.
6027000	6028000	PC speaker.
6028000	6033000	So there's not a lot of music with this and it's a lot of incidental break
6033000	6036000	squeaks. So, but I will, as I always do,
6036000	6038000	let the music play in the background, whatever it is.
6038000	6044000	So it is quite literally just a break squeals and a police sirens.
6044000	6046000	And yeah. Anyways, here you go.
6046000	6049000	Developed by sphere and published by spectrum Holobyte.
6049000	6050000	First and foremost,
6050000	6055000	I will say that this game is spelled V E T T E vet as in short for Corvette.
6055000	6057000	It is an with an exclamation point with an exclamation.
6057000	6058000	Don't forget about that.
6058000	6063000	That is an incredibly early and incredibly crude race in simulation game.
6063000	6066000	It was originally released in 1989 coming,
6066000	6070000	coming out on IBM PCs running MS-DOS and Macintosh computers.
6070000	6074000	It is set in San Francisco. It features terrain,
6075000	6076000	notable landmarks,
6076000	6081000	high speed racing across all of the upper peninsula of San Francisco.
6081000	6085000	It'll take you to landmarks anywhere from the San Francisco zoo across both
6085000	6088000	bridges and plenty of notable landmarks in between.
6088000	6092000	This game is 100% a relic of times past.
6092000	6093000	When the game starts,
6093000	6096000	you have to answer a question based off details in the instruction manual in
6096000	6097000	order to play the game.
6097000	6101000	It asks you things like specific tuning parameters of,
6101000	6103000	I think it's all actually Corvettes.
6103000	6105000	There may be the European sports cars too in there.
6105000	6106000	I don't entirely remember.
6106000	6109000	It was a long time ago when I played it.
6109000	6113000	Um, what's really fun about this game is that if you do,
6113000	6115000	if you answer the question incorrectly,
6115000	6117000	you get all the way to the start of the race.
6117000	6119000	And as soon as go is waived,
6119000	6124000	a police siren is heard and you are arrested in game for driving a stolen vet.
6125000	6127000	That's funny. That's great. I like that.
6127000	6128000	Just the, Oh man.
6129000	6130000	Can I just say quickly though,
6130000	6133000	it always blows me away how all these racing games are set in San Francisco,
6133000	6136000	which I get to an extent, you know, you have the landmarks and,
6136000	6139000	and the Hills of San Francisco make it interesting and everything,
6139000	6142000	but just as somebody who drives a lot in San Francisco, um,
6142000	6147000	real racing in San Francisco is being stuck in traffic all fucking day.
6147000	6149000	You don't race in San Francisco.
6149000	6151000	There's too many cars.
6151000	6154000	You race to make it down five miles on the one-on-one in like 30 minutes when
6154000	6156000	you're already late for your appointment.
6156000	6158000	And heaven help you if Bart is striking.
6159000	6162000	As, as I learned when I came into town last time.
6162000	6163000	Yes.
6163000	6165000	Yes. 100% correct.
6165000	6167000	Uh, the core of the game, it is a racing game.
6167000	6169000	You pick one of four types of Corvettes,
6169000	6173000	age appropriate and choose one of four European sports cars as your opponent.
6173000	6178000	Uh, one of the four, there are four key destinations to race.
6178000	6182000	The fourth being a worldwide tour encompassing the three previous levels.
6182000	6187000	And despite the display of American Corvette dickwagging,
6187000	6190000	the funnier part of this game is that if you lose to your opponent,
6190000	6193000	one of the most often messages you get is don't feel bad.
6193000	6194000	I programmed this game.
6194000	6197000	So apparently the developers may have been more in love with the European
6197000	6199000	sports cars in the Corvette. I don't know.
6199000	6202000	It's a very, it's very interesting mix of cultures there.
6202000	6207000	Um, there are degrees of difficulty and realism on the easiest mode called
6207000	6209000	trainee. There will be no car damage.
6209000	6211000	Police will not be a factor.
6211000	6216000	Uh, turns will be tight and cruise control will just be full speed at all
6216000	6218000	times. Even if you collide with something,
6218000	6221000	you will instantly go back up to your cruise control speed.
6221000	6224000	When the object moves out of your way. Yes, there are collisions.
6224000	6229000	There are damage. There is realism to the extent you can call it for 1989.
6229000	6232000	Um, as you increase in difficulty,
6232000	6235000	these various options will start becoming more and more realistic.
6235000	6239000	If you speed go down the wrong way, uh, go down a one way street,
6239000	6241000	the wrong way. Um, uh,
6241000	6243000	Oh, Hey, look at that Bay bridge.
6244000	6248000	That's the golden gate bridge lights and police will start to pursue you.
6248000	6252000	You will get pulled over and you will even have to give your excuse to the
6252000	6256000	officer before he writes you a citation. There is even manslaughter.
6256000	6260000	There are characters in the city of San Francisco that you can run into and
6260000	6265000	they go from a standing crude Sprite to a flattened crude Sprite.
6265000	6269000	Um, the pro difficulty level turns all of these on, on full realism,
6269000	6273000	damage, traction, police, and cruise control are all said to be realistic.
6273000	6277000	Pretty convincingly too, I will say. Um, Oh, and by the way,
6277000	6280000	your opponent is immune to all of this and is damn fast.
6280000	6284000	He's incredibly frustrating. This game was oodles of fun for me when I was,
6284000	6287000	uh, well it came out when I was four,
6287000	6290000	but I'm sure I was playing it more when I was five, six or seven.
6290000	6294000	And despite how crude it is, there's just something colorful,
6294000	6297000	wonderful, fun, defined, and really,
6297000	6299000	really incredibly interesting about this game.
6299000	6302000	Yeah. When you look at these old racing games, you're kind of like, wow,
6302000	6307000	this looks like shit. But I mean, at the time this is, I mean,
6307000	6310000	you think, I think of an Epic game, like what was that? Not hard drive in,
6310000	6312000	but what was the sequel? The stunt racing one where you do,
6312000	6313000	or was it hard drive in?
6313000	6316000	Are you thinking the big sitting cabinet?
6316000	6317000	Was it maybe stunts? Yeah.
6317000	6322000	Where you would go over the loop and all that shit like that game looks like
6322000	6325000	utter garbage now. But back in the day,
6325000	6329000	we were plunking down a dollar because dude, you could drive around a loop.
6329000	6334000	And we loved it. And it's VR realness.
6334000	6336000	Test drive three, man.
6336000	6338000	So anyway, sorry, Jason.
6338000	6344000	This game, this game is as zany as it is shockingly deep to the point that it
6344000	6346000	can actually represent it. If you don't want to race,
6346000	6347000	there's also a tour mode,
6347000	6350000	which will immediately warp you to time period appropriate landmarks,
6350000	6353000	the Coit tower, the ferry building, Fisherman's wharf and the piers,
6353000	6355000	the trans America pyramid. Yup.
6355000	6359000	And of course Lombard street and all of its glory completely represented in
6359000	6360000	this game.
6360000	6364000	The kicker of this game is that there's a lot of crude and silly elements.
6364000	6365000	Like for example,
6365000	6368000	I'm staring at the video right now and there's a gear there's there's a
6368000	6371000	shifter. There's the gear box. No,
6371000	6375000	there's the shifter with the character's hand on it. And the,
6375000	6379000	and the gear is represented by a little notch in, you know,
6379000	6382000	one is top left, two is bottom left, et cetera, et cetera.
6382000	6384000	But the hand never moves.
6384000	6389000	There's just this little switch that goes through the image YouTube for vet.
6389000	6391000	You'll see what I'm talking about. Automatic or manual.
6391000	6393000	You can do it both. Um, the,
6393000	6396000	the kicker of all this game and we were talking about this before with Atari
6396000	6401000	and everything else. This game was less than one megabyte in size,
6401000	6407000	one single floppy disk for the whole of the upper peninsula.
6407000	6411000	And yeah, these objects are crude, but they're fricking 3d standing objects.
6411000	6415000	This game actually does have terrain. So you actually go sloped roads.
6415000	6418000	The background images are cute. There's a,
6418000	6422000	there were some serious polygons on that golden gate bridge.
6422000	6426000	It's amazing the objects that they put together to make this game for less
6426000	6430000	than one megabyte, completely astounding.
6430000	6432000	All right, there it is.
6432000	6437000	There it is a look into racing games on the PCs passed with the classic game
6437000	6440000	of the week vet. All right, there it is.
6440000	6443000	That's vet with an explanation point, not like, you know,
6443000	6446000	my first pet vet. Yeah. Or something like that.
6446000	6447000	My first pet accident.
6447000	6451000	Hey, there it is. Uh, thank you very much, Jason. That was a good pick.
6451000	6454000	You know what? Because I like hearing about games that like I would have never
6454000	6457000	looked up otherwise. And considering that I did play a lot of old school games,
6457000	6460000	I'd actually never heard of this game. So you, you stumped me on that one.
6460000	6463000	Good job, Jason. All right. That does it for part a,
6463000	6465000	but we have plenty more show to come after a quick break.
6465000	6467000	We have a rapid fire news coming at you.
6467000	6472000	The focal question of the week talking about sales and frugal gaming news about
6472000	6474000	current racing games. So, uh,
6474000	6477000	going from a classic racer to things like fours of five and Gran Turismo six,
6477000	6480000	your emails, your calls at one eight seven seven game,
6480000	6485000	O L R and plenty more when we come back with more of orange lounge radio.
6491000	6496000	Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live on this Sunday night,
6496000	6502000	November the 24th of 2013 with our 528th episode already in progress.
6502000	6506000	We've had a heck of a show so far tonight. Yeah. Jason's joining us here.
6506000	6509000	If you are just joining us live, dark soccer out for the night,
6509000	6510000	she had a prior engagement,
6510000	6515000	a family affair as those things tend to happen this time of year and a real
6515000	6519000	quickly since you know, Thanksgiving week is this coming week here in America.
6519000	6522000	I just want to wish all of our listeners who are celebrating Thanksgiving this
6522000	6525000	coming week. I want to wish you all a happy Thanksgiving. Uh, and you know,
6525000	6528000	we here at orange launch radio, as cheesy as this sounds,
6528000	6531000	we really are thankful for all of you guys who take the time out of your day to
6531000	6534000	listen. Those of you that participate with the show here live on Sunday nights.
6534000	6536000	Uh, those of you that listen, uh, via the podcast,
6536000	6539000	those of you that leave comments at vog network.com, those of you that email,
6539000	6543000	those of you that leave the kind reviews on iTunes and Stitcher and all that.
6543000	6546000	We just really appreciate you guys. Thank you for being a part of the community.
6546000	6550000	You are our motivation. That is why we've been here for the past. God,
6550000	6553000	how long has it been? 11 plus years at this point. I have lost count.
6553000	6556000	It has hit that point. I have lost count of how many episodes we've had,
6556000	6560000	but since, since June of 2002, we've been here at orange launch radio.
6560000	6564000	We are thankful for you guys. You keep us going. So a happy Thanksgiving to all
6564000	6566000	you out there. And if you aren't in America, you know,
6566000	6570000	you're Canadian or you're, you're British or Australian or from another country
6570000	6574000	that doesn't have Thanksgiving this week, then I will say, enjoy your week,
6574000	6579000	making fun of us and our black Friday mania and all that crap.
6579000	6582000	So enjoy your week, making fun of us for all of that. Uh, we,
6582000	6585000	we deserve it quite frankly. Um,
6585000	6587000	but I'm hoping for some good deals come cyber Monday.
6587000	6589000	I'm crossing my fingers and my toes. Maybe I can get,
6589000	6593000	maybe I can get Diablo three on PlayStation three at a steel price on cyber
6593000	6598000	Monday. And because I'm certainly not braving those crowds on black Friday.
6598000	6600000	I will say this. I have gone out on black Friday,
6600000	6603000	like late at night and it's just like any other day. Like if you,
6603000	6606000	if you go at like seven or eight o'clock at night to target or whatever,
6606000	6609000	it's just like any other day because all the, all the crazies are done.
6609000	6610000	They went to bed, all the,
6610000	6615000	all the TVs for 99 bucks or whatever crazy shit's going on.
6615000	6618000	They're all long since sold out. So nobody's around for those anymore. So, uh,
6618000	6620000	black Friday is not so bad in that regard,
6620000	6624000	which is good because sometimes I realize I need toothpaste and then, Oh shit,
6624000	6629000	I don't want to be anywhere near a store on black Friday, but there you go.
6629000	6630000	All right.
6630000	6634000	I'm just hoping there's been enough pushback that stores don't make a habit of
6634000	6638000	actually being open on Thanksgiving night. Like prior to midnight Fridays,
6638000	6640000	Fridays rough and you know, the five,
6640000	6644000	the 4am starts and the midnight starts and all that kind of crap is, is rough.
6644000	6648000	But at least it's on Friday. People that have companies that have talked about
6648000	6650000	being open on Thanksgiving night, like eight o'clock,
6650000	6653000	8pm or some nonsense like that.
6653000	6659000	I seriously hope that that is not prolific and does not trend in future years.
6659000	6661000	Not to deviate too much from the topic of video games,
6661000	6664000	but since a lot of video games are on sale during this special period,
6664000	6667000	we'll go into this a little bit. But, um, you know,
6667000	6669000	I do kind of understand both sides of it is that, you know, there,
6669000	6672000	if the audience wasn't there for it, they wouldn't do it.
6672000	6676000	And they do have to get the particular sales and all that. You know,
6676000	6679000	I do to some extent understand that, you know,
6679000	6683000	and that is what you sign up for where you work at when you work in retail.
6683000	6687000	And there is other industries like policemen don't get the day off.
6687000	6689000	Firefighters don't get the day off. You know, it just,
6689000	6692000	sometimes it comes with the territory. I'm not defending it totally.
6692000	6694000	I'm just trying to look at both sides.
6694000	6695000	I'm going to tell you what I don't like about it.
6695000	6699000	This is why I don't like about it is that it's starting to eclipse Thanksgiving.
6699000	6701000	And that's that, no, no, no, no, no.
6701000	6703000	We do not get two days off of work to celebrate Black Friday.
6703000	6706000	And that's starting to be what it's becoming.
6706000	6709000	And that's the part that gets me more than anything is well,
6709000	6712000	we're starting to eclipse Thanksgiving. And you know, that's,
6712000	6716000	that's where things get a little, little, I don't like it for me,
6716000	6720000	but you know, there's a lot of places that don't,
6720000	6722000	hospitals don't stop running on Thanksgiving.
6722000	6726000	So let's give thanks to those folks that, you know,
6726000	6728000	work hard when the rest of us have a day off.
6728000	6730000	And then deal with the trampling crazies the day afterwards.
6730000	6732000	Yeah. Yeah. No kidding.
6732000	6736000	Four hours. Not even 24 hours goes by before that stuff happens.
6736000	6739000	Yeah. So, all right. Let's move on.
6739000	6741000	Let's get back into some rapid fire news.
6741000	6744000	Get back to what the games are all about. Loki.
6744000	6748000	Yes. So there was a lot of Persona announcements after, you know,
6748000	6750000	a countdown. And I kind of, it was funny,
6750000	6752000	they had some videos that go along with it.
6752000	6756000	Trolling, you know, Persona fans,
6756000	6760000	you know, they had a video with this old woman that was announcing something.
6760000	6763000	And they had a trailer in the background of, you know,
6763000	6765000	it playing in Akibahara.
6765000	6769000	And you couldn't see it because her head was in the way.
6769000	6771000	On purpose.
6771000	6774000	Anyways, Persona 5 announced for PlayStation 3.
6774000	6777000	I'm assuming coming out, it says Winter 2014.
6777000	6780000	So, pretty soon.
6780000	6783000	Persona Q, Shadow of the Labyrinth.
6783000	6787000	That's coming out on 3DS, was that?
6787000	6791000	Yeah, 3DS. So it's supposed to be June 5th in Japan.
6791000	6795000	So, probably sometime during the summer in North America.
6795000	6798000	Persona, or P4U, Persona 4,
6798000	6803000	the Ultimax Ultra Suplex hold on PS3.
6803000	6807000	That is going to be a follow up to Persona 4 Arena.
6807000	6811000	And then there's Persona 4,
6811000	6814000	Dancing All Night.
6814000	6816000	That's going to be coming to Vita.
6816000	6818000	And it's supposed to be a music game.
6818000	6820000	A rhythm action game, I guess.
6820000	6822000	Oh, that should be fun.
6822000	6824000	Yes, and that's coming Autumn of 2014.
6824000	6826000	So, lots of Persona for you.
6827000	6829000	Persona fans, still not satisfied.
6829000	6833000	Even though that's probably like, literally 5,000 hours of gameplay.
6833000	6835000	No, I'm teasing, obviously.
6835000	6837000	But no, that is exciting.
6837000	6843000	Considering the lack of good games based on this franchise,
6843000	6848000	Game of Thrones is going to be getting a brand new series of games,
6848000	6851000	or at least a game, from Telltale.
6851000	6853000	And that's pretty awesome.
6853000	6855000	There's no way it will be less than one game.
6855000	6857000	This will be a series like everything else.
6857000	6860000	So, I don't know, I think it's pretty awesome.
6860000	6863000	Because I know they've had the strategy game, which is alright,
6863000	6868000	and then they had that Game of Thrones game that came out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
6868000	6869000	It was kind of lame.
6869000	6872000	But, can't go wrong with Telltale.
6872000	6874000	There's no way they can fuck that up.
6874000	6876000	Well, I'm just going to say this,
6876000	6879000	as much as I agree, and Telltale's put out a lot of quality stuff,
6879000	6882000	I'm a little sad that that King's Quest thing didn't happen.
6882000	6884000	That's a little irritating.
6884000	6886000	I was really looking forward to the Telltale King's Quest game,
6886000	6889000	so the fact that that kind of didn't happen is sad.
6889000	6891000	But, yay, Game of Thrones, I guess.
6891000	6896000	I'm totally using this story as an excuse to bitch about King's Quest not happening.
6896000	6898000	I'm sorry, but I had to.
6898000	6902000	Well, I would think probably Activision's going to be at fault there.
6902000	6905000	Because, you know, they're the ones that have the license, don't they?
6905000	6910000	Um, yeah, but, you know, fuck them.
6911000	6912000	What are they going to do with it?
6912000	6916000	Treyarch, first person shooter, King's Quest.
6916000	6918000	I'd still play that, but yeah.
6918000	6919000	Argh.
6919000	6921000	No idea.
6921000	6926000	And then, of course, you know, not a huge...
6926000	6930000	I guess it's sort of a surprise that John Carmack is leaving id Software.
6930000	6933000	And I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that, you know,
6933000	6939000	he's working with the Oculus folks as their chief technology officer.
6939000	6946000	And I'm not sure what else he's doing, but he is resigning.
6946000	6951000	And he's been at the company for 17 years, but it's too bad.
6951000	6954000	That seems short for some reason.
6954000	6955000	Was that...?
6955000	6958000	17 puts it back to 1996.
6958000	6960000	But didn't...
6960000	6964000	That was like, after Doom and everything, wasn't he there for...?
6964000	6965000	I thought so too.
6965000	6967000	I think I'm just fucking up my id Software history.
6967000	6968000	Maybe.
6968000	6975000	My question is, though, is that why Rage was on sale this weekend?
6975000	6978000	Your golden parachute is made up of the sales of this game.
6978000	6980000	Oculus Rift, though.
6980000	6981000	Jason, have you played Oculus Rift?
6981000	6982000	I have.
6982000	6984000	Oh, and I didn't mention that.
6984000	6988000	Since I got back into town, if I didn't mention this,
6988000	6989000	I don't remember when I actually played it,
6989000	6992000	so I may or may not have mentioned it last time I was on the show,
6992000	6995000	but I've been wanting to get my hands on an Oculus Rift,
6996000	6998000	not out of my own pocket.
6998000	7001000	There is an Oculus Rift at the office, owned by a coworker of mine,
7001000	7005000	that leaves it there because he and a friend of his sometimes stay late
7005000	7009000	and do, you know, hack on 3D projects and that kind of stuff.
7009000	7010000	I don't know if I have...
7010000	7014000	Hack on 3D projects, play 3D pornography games, you know.
7014000	7017000	Well, play 3D games, most definitely.
7017000	7018000	I won't doubt that one.
7018000	7019000	Anything else?
7019000	7021000	Well, that's a whole other discussion.
7021000	7024000	Just remember what the Internet's for, Jason.
7024000	7029000	But I do have A for the Awesome, R for the Awesome,
7029000	7031000	and I have played that in Oculus mode.
7031000	7035000	And with the exception of one level that had a really, really weird visual bug
7035000	7038000	where the sky was, like, bleeding out,
7038000	7043000	the backdrop of the ground was bleeding out a lot of the buildings and whatnot,
7043000	7046000	that game is fucking fantastic with the Oculus Rift.
7046000	7047000	Oh, my dear sweet God.
7047000	7050000	I love that game just in general, but having...
7050000	7055000	You know, there's contention about which display mode to use with the Oculus Rift,
7055000	7059000	whether head tracking should be where your aiming is.
7059000	7060000	I don't think so.
7060000	7061000	Other people do whatever.
7061000	7062000	That's what the choice is for.
7062000	7066000	But for, you know, the skydiving simulator in a freaking Oculus Rift,
7066000	7069000	oh, my God, that is so much fun.
7069000	7071000	Absolutely love it.
7073000	7074000	I love the Oculus Rift, too.
7074000	7077000	That demo that Bobby gave me at Dragon Con was pretty awesome.
7077000	7080000	I'm excited to see some more, you know, game development talent go over there,
7080000	7083000	because obviously you have a lot of concepts on Rift right now
7083000	7085000	and a lot of really cool demos,
7085000	7089000	but to hear that there could be some great games that come out of that,
7089000	7091000	it's good news.
7091000	7096000	I've been two weeks ago,
7096000	7098000	also obviously still when I was in San Francisco,
7098000	7101000	because that's where the Rift is, like I said.
7101000	7104000	A couple of coworkers stayed late,
7104000	7107000	and one individual was demoing it to other people,
7107000	7110000	and it was kind of funny because one of them didn't understand
7110000	7112000	that it was head tracking and not, like,
7112000	7114000	she said afterwards that she thought it was, like,
7114000	7116000	augmented reality or something like that,
7116000	7117000	that she'd be able to see through.
7117000	7120000	So when somebody else is playing, she would go up and,
7120000	7122000	hey, hey, wave on the other side of the Rift,
7122000	7125000	and we're like, it doesn't work that way.
7125000	7127000	She can't see you.
7127000	7129000	And then when she actually put it on,
7129000	7131000	she still had that mentality,
7131000	7134000	and so she was doing the Italy house demo,
7134000	7136000	if you saw just the basic FPS.
7136000	7138000	I did, yeah.
7138000	7141000	And so there were, like, wispy things in the air,
7141000	7144000	like the torches would let out those little quick flames.
7144000	7147000	I think she said butterflies and maybe even leaves.
7147000	7149000	I actually kind of don't remember it myself.
7149000	7152000	But she was walking around, and she would, you know,
7152000	7154000	she would wave her arm at him, and she would flick,
7154000	7157000	she would try to hit him,
7157000	7163000	and obviously nothing happened except for adjusted angle
7163000	7165000	and viewing.
7165000	7169000	But afterwards, after they had both understood
7169000	7171000	what was actually going on, they were like,
7171000	7173000	yeah, that's cool, but what about immersion?
7173000	7175000	And so I just kind of turned to them, and I said,
7175000	7179000	well, that's what the treadmill attachment is for
7179000	7182000	that was demoed at PAX so that you can actually,
7182000	7185000	you have a game pad or some other joystick in hand,
7185000	7189000	you have the Oculus on your head, and then you suit yourself,
7189000	7191000	you strap yourself in, and you start walking on a treadmill,
7191000	7195000	and that's as close to immersion as you're going to get
7195000	7197000	until the holodeck comes.
7197000	7198000	We've got to watch the Oculus Rift talk,
7198000	7200000	or we're going to be the Bobby Black Wolf show.
7200000	7201000	So love you, Bobby.
7201000	7203000	Honestly, TLDR, amazing, as always.
7203000	7205000	Honestly, if the Oculus Rift was a new console
7205000	7207000	that was coming out in November,
7207000	7209000	that would probably be more exciting than some,
7209000	7211000	see, that at least has a hook.
7211000	7212000	That's a new way to play games.
7212000	7215000	It's kind of a push forward in technology
7215000	7218000	other than game console with better specs.
7218000	7220000	That's fucking PC with better specs.
7220000	7221000	I mean, come on.
7221000	7224000	That is something that has a little bit more of a hook.
7224000	7225000	Interesting way to look at it.
7226000	7228000	To register participation for this week's episode
7228000	7230000	of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
7230000	7232000	use the passphrase, illegal.
7232000	7234000	All right, let's move on with some more rapid-fire news, though,
7234000	7237000	including, here's another story about fucking Twitch,
7237000	7240000	but it's about Minecraft,
7240000	7243000	which that's a game that won't die in a community that won't die,
7243000	7244000	and with good reason.
7244000	7245000	I'm not saying it should.
7245000	7246000	And Oculus support.
7246000	7247000	And does it have Oculus?
7247000	7248000	Of course it does.
7248000	7249000	Why am I even asking?
7249000	7251000	Of course it has Oculus support.
7251000	7253000	But anyway, one-click Twitch streaming
7253000	7257000	is now coming to the PC and Mac versions of Minecraft.
7257000	7260000	I know Path of Exile, which is a game I played not that long ago,
7260000	7261000	has this as well.
7261000	7263000	You're starting to see this built into the game.
7263000	7265000	You don't even need open broadcast software
7265000	7267000	or any of those programs to stream.
7267000	7269000	You just click in the game and there you go.
7269000	7272000	This was kind of outlined at MineCon recently,
7272000	7275000	but now in Minecraft you do a quick visit
7275000	7277000	to enable streaming in the account settings.
7277000	7279000	All you have to do, press F6, there you go.
7279000	7282000	And if you need to walk through the features,
7282000	7283000	that's available, of course, on YouTube,
7283000	7286000	because, you know, people can stream and then archive to YouTube.
7286000	7287000	That's that.
7287000	7289000	So many more Minecraft streams to come.
7289000	7293000	The creators of Minecraft, very good about,
7294000	7299000	they do not try to enforce copyrights on any of their stuff
7299000	7300000	on Twitch or YouTube or any of that.
7300000	7302000	They're like, go forth and mine.
7302000	7304000	It's just make all the Minecraft stuff you want.
7304000	7307000	And of course, Hunger Games, Minecraft, YouTube,
7307000	7309000	they're everywhere.
7309000	7310000	Those are huge.
7310000	7311000	They look fun.
7311000	7313000	I just never could find something to join in with.
7313000	7315000	I wish we could do one of those, but I know.
7315000	7317000	We could, but it's a lot of work.
7317000	7319000	They have a script for it.
7319000	7322000	I want to play Final Fantasy XIV and World of Warcraft.
7323000	7325000	Moving on, I want to play A Legend of Zelda,
7325000	7327000	A Link Between Worlds.
7327000	7329000	And now that I've registered it to my club Nintendo account,
7329000	7332000	maybe I can get these rewards, which is pretty neat.
7332000	7337000	Three posters based on the game is a new club Nintendo reward.
7337000	7339000	They measure 22 by 28.
7339000	7342000	And I don't know if these are a limited time deal or what have you.
7342000	7345000	It costs 500 coins if you want these posters.
7345000	7347000	So there you go.
7347000	7349000	By the way, you can also get A Legend of Zelda,
7349000	7353000	A Link to the Past for 150 coins for the Wii Virtual Console,
7353000	7356000	because it's not out on Wii U yet,
7356000	7358000	but I'm sure it will be before too long.
7358000	7361000	In fact, I haven't looked at what Virtual Console games came out for Wii U recently,
7361000	7365000	but there was a lot of, let's just say, scraping the bottom of the barrel,
7365000	7369000	some of the really old Nintendo launch titles that people don't care about anymore,
7369000	7370000	like Clu Clu Land.
7370000	7374000	Sorry fans of Clu Clu Land, but let's be real, no one cur,
7374000	7377000	but that's been what some of the Virtual Console releases have been lately.
7378000	7382000	The next gen console wars did continue in South Park.
7382000	7384000	We talked about this a little bit last week,
7384000	7386000	when the first half of South Park aired.
7386000	7388000	Well, sure enough, it was a two-part episode,
7388000	7390000	and the second half did air this week.
7390000	7393000	It was the continued story of Black Friday.
7393000	7398000	A Song of Ass and Fire apparently was the name of the episodes.
7398000	7399000	Go figure.
7399000	7401000	And there you go.
7401000	7403000	They are dressed in a little bit of product placement.
7403000	7406000	The characters of South Park were dressed up like the characters in the RPG,
7406000	7409000	which is coming out now March of 2014.
7409000	7412000	A lot of people talking about the Princess Kenny anime intro.
7412000	7415000	I'm gonna be honest, I didn't watch this week's yet.
7415000	7416000	It's pretty funny.
7416000	7417000	I plum forgot.
7417000	7419000	Who won the console war in the end?
7419000	7420000	Spoilers.
7420000	7423000	I didn't watch it, but I saw that sequence, so I watched it on YouTube.
7423000	7424000	God dammit.
7424000	7425000	Probably better we don't answer that for spoilers.
7425000	7426000	Yeah, I guess that's true.
7426000	7427000	For spoilers, some people are gonna be like,
7427000	7429000	your shows spoil things.
7429000	7431000	Alright, let's move on.
7431000	7432000	Jason, what do you have for us?
7432000	7433000	Alright.
7433000	7437000	Polyphony Digital are attempting to do the impossible.
7437000	7439000	Release a Gran Turismo in a timely manner.
7439000	7444000	The best case scenario will be that Gran Turismo 7 will come out next year,
7444000	7447000	with Gran Turismo 6 finally releasing on December 6th.
7447000	7450000	But that is the best case, and things get bumped,
7450000	7454000	and new generation, and new consoles, and feasibility.
7454000	7457000	Well, you know, we'll see.
7457000	7462000	This is considerably impressive considering that the wait between Gran Turismo 5 and 6
7462000	7466000	was three years, and the wait between 4 and 5 was nearly six years.
7466000	7470000	Best of luck to them, and especially making it look completely awesome
7470000	7475000	on modern...modern consoles, I say, as they just came out this week.
7475000	7477000	Hello.
7477000	7482000	Three PS1 games are available for free on a PlayStation Home scavenger hunt.
7482000	7486000	It's a short little 13-hidden card minigame in Home.
7486000	7489000	Shouldn't take you more than 10, 20 minutes tops,
7489000	7492000	but the games are Twisted Metal, Warhawk, and Destruction Derby,
7492000	7498000	which are frickin' great titles to add to your collection, so why not?
7498000	7504000	And lastly, Strider 2014, the reboot, will also include the original version,
7504000	7509000	Strider 1 and 2, the PS1 versions rather, not Arcade or anything like that.
7509000	7513000	Strider 2014 is slated to be released on February 22nd,
7513000	7519000	will include the first two. Get your history on and enjoy these games.
7519000	7522000	Oh, I lied, it's not just PlayStation 4, I'm crazy.
7522000	7528000	Strider 2014 is going to be on PC, Xbox 360, and Xbox One.
7528000	7530000	When's that out? I missed the date.
7530000	7532000	February 22.
7532000	7535000	Yay, there's something to look forward to in that early window.
7535000	7537000	I totally forgot one of the games I played this week.
7537000	7540000	I'll have to name it next week. It's alright.
7540000	7542000	There was a download game I totally played earlier this week.
7542000	7546000	I spent an entire night playing it, and then it was like, oh, new games to play.
7546000	7550000	I do that way too much, but I would just say the download games really help bridge the gap.
7550000	7556000	Alrighty, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.
7556000	7564000	Every week here, we take Facebook and Google+, slam it together, you get FUGL.
7564000	7567000	Let's get to the question of the week.
7567000	7574000	And I will read some of the answers from Facebook and Google+, because we are running a little long tonight. Sorry, guys.
7574000	7577000	Where the hell are the posts on Google+, I can't see them.
7577000	7580000	Alright, fine, we'll go to Facebook first.
7580000	7587000	For some reason, my computer is running so slow too. I'm sorry if it's causing the feed to skip.
7587000	7591000	Also, all the account madness that we did earlier today may have been a factor in this.
7591000	7593000	That very well could be, who knows.
7593000	7596000	Well, I had to get the YouTube channel back. We haven't posted to it for like four years.
7596000	7599000	Alright, anyway, here we go, the FUGL question of the week.
7599000	7602000	Brace yourselves, holiday shopping season is coming.
7602000	7607000	Are there any holiday gaming deals you plan to pick up over the next few weeks?
7607000	7613000	Do you typically wait for games to go on sale before buying them, or does the desire to play them right away usually win out?
7613000	7616000	So let's go to some of the answers from Facebook.
7616000	7621000	Redthehay says, I plan to buy older games online or at the store that are usually under $10.
7621000	7629000	It depends on the game. If it's a single-player game I really, really want, or something I can play with my regular online buddies, or a mix of both like Grand Theft Auto 5, I usually get it at launch.
7629000	7636000	Forthefallendreams says, Cyber Monday sales rule because it can wait and come to me, dammit.
7636000	7638000	Murica!
7638000	7643000	Andy R. says, the desire to play right away wins out almost all the time.
7643000	7646000	That and pre-order bonuses, stupid as they sometimes are.
7646000	7654000	I'll probably still take a look at the deals coming up, but buying a PlayStation 4 last week and a 3DS a couple months ago means I'm holding off on spending too much at the moment.
7654000	7663000	Daniel S. says, there aren't any specific games I want to buy per se, but if they're a really good deal on something I'll snatch it up.
7663000	7670000	Those are usually Steam sales, but outlets have been known to clear their inventory of large collector's edition boxes.
7670000	7672000	Ooh, that's really true.
7672000	7680000	DJ Synthetic says, I'm just hoping for a purple 3DS bundle type thing. I need to start playing something not Call of Duty Ghosts.
7680000	7690000	DJ Rama S. says, Gamestop has some sweet deals I plan to pick up. I do try to wait for games to go on sale, but on the same token I'm in no rush to play a lot of the games that are coming out.
7690000	7694000	So by the time I get that game it's usually under $30. Score!
7694000	7698000	Alright, now going over to Google+, now that it's loaded, let's look at just a few comments over there.
7698000	7707000	Act Def says, I already jumped the gun on getting a Zelda Wind Waker Wii U on the Mexican version of Black Friday, which is El Buen Fin, or The Great Weekend.
7707000	7710000	I did not know that was a thing. I learned something tonight.
7710000	7718000	Tech 2030 says, even though I just bought a Playstation 4, if there is a killer Black Friday deal for a Wii U, I'll probably pull the trigger on that one.
7718000	7723000	It's killing me that I'm not playing Super Mario 3D World in Wind Waker HD already.
7723000	7730000	And lastly, Sam H. says, Xbox Live and Playstation Plus 12 month subcards for $30 at Gamestop.
7730000	7732000	That's right, Rob. I'm going to Gamestop.
7732000	7736000	Well, you know what, I can't really blame you for that, Sam, though. That's a pretty good deal.
7736000	7741000	Even I want to go get the Playstation Plus card at that rate, because it's a really good deal.
7741000	7745000	Those are some of the answers from our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.
7746000	7748000	By all means, please go read the rest of them.
7755000	7764000	How about you guys? I think we might have dabbled into this a little bit, but do you have any Black Friday, Cyber Monday deals you guys are looking into?
7764000	7768000	I already mentioned Diablo 3 as something I want to grab if I can get it dirt cheap.
7768000	7771000	I'm not paying $60 for a game I already have for free.
7771000	7774000	But for the console version, yeah, I'm tempted.
7774000	7775000	Jason?
7775000	7780000	Invariably, Steam's going to have something that's interesting. I have a pretty big wish list.
7780000	7784000	But specifically, I just haven't had the time to even consider this kind of stuff.
7784000	7791000	Not to mention all of the... not that the newest things are going to be too deeply discounted, but I have exactly none of the newer consoles.
7791000	7794000	And so those are saving for those as higher up on my radar.
7794000	7799000	Something Steam, it'll happen. Other than that, ask me next year.
7799000	7801000	Loki?
7801000	7808000	No. Unless there's something on Steam that I have to have, which I say there probably isn't going to be, but you never know.
7808000	7813000	There always will be. There's some indie title that wasn't on your radar that will be eventually.
7813000	7820000	Splunkies! I know one I really want to get that I just haven't... I'm sure the minute that goes on a deep Steam sale, it'll be mine.
7820000	7826000	I forgot about Steam sales, Jason, you're right. That's gonna hurt. It's gonna hurt this year.
7826000	7829000	You already said it once in this episode. Winter is coming. That can only mean one thing.
7829000	7831000	That's right. Steam sale!
7831000	7839000	I still haven't even picked up Bioshock Infinite, even though they had it for like $11 for all three games.
7839000	7841000	Bioshock 1, 2, and Infinite.
7841000	7844000	Ooh, I gotta get that too. That's a good point.
7844000	7846000	So it'll be like five bucks by the time.
7846000	7853000	Alright, let's move on with some other news, and then we'll get to the mailbag, the FUs of the Week, and all that other good stuff. Loki?
7853000	7865000	So Fours of Five. Fours of Five, as people realize once they purchase a game, has a bit of a monetization business model to it.
7865000	7871000	Granted, you can play the game and unlock stuff, or you can buy some tokens.
7872000	7880000	And the tokens, their pricing model for the tokens is really stupid, actually, because they have different bundles you can get.
7880000	7884000	And you usually think, oh, I'm buying more so I get a better deal on it.
7884000	7887000	It's actually the opposite. If you buy less, you get a better deal on it.
7887000	7893000	But they have, I guess they were talking about different cars and stuff.
7893000	7906000	For example, if you were to buy the McLaren or something like that, the P1, the cost of that, the token pack, they're saying, well, this is all in Euros, of course.
7906000	7913000	So they're saying $15.99 would be, I guess it would cover both of those cars.
7913000	7920000	100 is like 79 Euro? I don't know what that is over here. I think it's like 89 cents over here.
7920000	7924000	79 Euros is $107.
7924000	7928000	I'm sorry, .79 Euros, not 79 Euros.
7928000	7930000	Yeah, $1.
7930000	7932000	So about a dollar.
7932000	7942000	So basically, I think they did the same thing with Real Driving 3 when that came out or something, where they added it all together.
7942000	7949000	I want to say it was like $2,200 is what they came up with as far as what's going to cost.
7949000	7952000	Oh, here we go. Token costs in the US.
7952000	7954000	So 100 tokens runs you 99 cents.
7954000	7959000	If you want 325 tokens, it's going to run you $5.
7959000	7963000	Yes, you heard correctly, 325 tokens is $5.
7963000	7969000	Whereas if I spent $5 on the 100 tokens, I get 500 tokens because that makes fucking sense.
7969000	7971000	Thanks for letting me bundle easily, guys.
7971000	7974000	$575 is $10.
7974000	7977000	Let me throw this out there because the chat's being a little adamant about this point.
7977000	7981000	ActDeft in chat at live.vognetwork.com. First, I love this.
7981000	7986000	BlackWolf at live.vognetwork.com says, the monetization ain't as bad as whatever Loki's about to say.
7986000	7993000	And then ActDeft said, monetization as in buying tokens and credits, those exist since fours of three.
7993000	7997000	I seriously don't know why people are making a big fuzz about this monetization thing.
7998000	8004000	I do think in some extent it is an opportunity for people to pounce on a new system and,
8004000	8007000	oh my God, this is the route we're going down.
8007000	8012000	I think it's because this game has half the cars that the last game had is more like it.
8012000	8015000	And that they're offering, oh, you can get more cars than DLC.
8015000	8021000	Yes, I understand that's because the cars are modeled in higher resolution or whatever excuse they want to use.
8021000	8029000	But it's a little shady when you're buying a system for $500 and then you're buying a game for $60.
8029000	8034000	And then they are saying, hey, you know what, you can also buy some cars too if you want to spend another $100 on it.
8034000	8044000	I kind of think that's where it's at is that people have hit their saturation point with seeing the freemium model in the premium games.
8044000	8049000	And I kind of just think the reason why this is all catching fire and you're seeing it,
8049000	8055000	it's not like we're the first ones to get out there and make it sound like it's all new because there's a lot of gaming blogs that are running this,
8055000	8060000	like it's Xbox One poison. You know you guys have read that out there somewhere.
8060000	8066000	I think it's because people are just hitting their saturation point where it's like, okay, stop injecting freemium models into premium games.
8066000	8069000	It's not, yeah, I don't have a problem with it being on this game.
8069000	8073000	I have a problem with it being on any game that you're paying retail price for.
8073000	8079000	If it's a free-to-play game, okay, fine. That's fine because they've got to make their money somehow.
8079000	8085000	But you've already made your money selling me this game and now you're saying, oh, well, we need more money.
8085000	8093000	Like for example, they were saying, though, that I guess one of the cars was like $100.
8094000	8104000	Yeah, okay, so they had the Lotus E21 is 6 million credits or 10,000 tokens.
8104000	8114000	So yes, 10,000 tokens would be $100 in real money if you wanted to just buy the car and not play the game to unlock those tokens or whatever, or credits.
8114000	8122000	That's kind of lame. I mean, fuck, I thought it was kind of lame in Forza Horizon where they had the shit you could unlock for tokens.
8123000	8131000	So I think it's lame everywhere. And come on, this is ridiculous. There's no excuse that this needs to be in there.
8131000	8139000	And I hate when the developers or publishers go, but the people wanted it. It's like, no one fucking wants it.
8139000	8143000	Yeah, I remember a day when UpUpDownDownLeftRightLeftRightBA Start gave me all that shit.
8144000	8151000	But I will say, at least in the case of Forza Horizon, I still love that game an awful lot.
8151000	8157000	So it's not like this ruins the game per se, and I haven't played Forza 5 so I can't speak to it, but I have played Forza Horizon a lot.
8157000	8163000	It didn't ruin the game per se, but it's just one of those things where you kind of, you just, it's a disappointing sigh.
8163000	8167000	I guess it's really the only way I can phrase it. Anyway.
8167000	8176000	Alright, let's move on. By the way, if you think this is specific to Xbox and Forza, you would be incorrect.
8176000	8185000	Why? Because Gran Turismo 6 on the PlayStation 3, not 4, 3, will also have a system for in-game microtransactions.
8185000	8190000	So again, this isn't something you can really pick on Forza specifically.
8190000	8196000	This is just people starting to kind of hit their point where, you know, I've had it officially with these.
8196000	8205000	So, purchasable as credits from PlayStation Network and physical retailers, you can get in-game credits to get vehicles, parts, and related accessories.
8205000	8215000	We don't know exactly how much this is going to be in the game and so forth, but it sounds like almost the exact same model that you see in Forza, also in Gran Turismo 6.
8215000	8221000	Which will be launching early December, so you can see for yourself exactly if there's $100 cars to buy in this game as well.
8221000	8228000	It's stupid that people even allow that, and unfortunately you're buying these games because they're good racing games, but at the same time, they're not putting the...
8228000	8235000	I mean, I guess the best advice you could say is just don't buy these, but I'm sure to some extent people are going to buy some of them.
8235000	8243000	Because they want, oh, maybe not necessarily $100 for a car, but you know, maybe they want just extra money or something, I don't know.
8244000	8245000	Alright.
8245000	8257000	They have it in Grand Theft Auto. Grand Theft Auto 5 has where you can pay to get money online, and they keep nerfing all the fucking payouts on everything, so trying to convince people to spend money on that.
8257000	8269000	Dr. Tzuyu in chat says, I'd assume in Gran Turismo you can still earn credits the old-fashioned way. I'm also assuming that to be the case. It's almost identical to what we just talked about with Forza 5, it seems.
8269000	8278000	So how long is it that we're going to get that fucking energy meter for these games, where, oh, my driver's tired now. He can't drive anymore for today.
8278000	8280000	In this case, it'll be a gas tank.
8280000	8285000	Unless they buy him some Mountain Dew, because they're going to have the product tie-in in there as well.
8285000	8294000	Can you imagine if they came out with a new Gradius game, and you could no longer hit up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA, start, but you could for 99 cents?
8294000	8298000	No, you hit it, and then it pops up a little window saying in the marketplace, hey, do you wish to buy extra lines?
8298000	8305000	That's where us old curmungians get a little sad when we read news like this, just to put it in perspective.
8305000	8309000	Anyway, Jason, maybe you have some better news in the racing game world?
8309000	8315000	Wrapping up our trifecta of racing, Mario Kart Arcade Grand Prix Deluxe is confirmed for US release.
8316000	8329000	It's been in Japan since the summer this year, and it will make its way to North America, well, rather, just outside Japan, winter 2013, so imminently in the next month for arcades that are actually going to make the investment.
8329000	8336000	It was also showcased at IAAPA, as was ReRave that we mentioned earlier in the show.
8336000	8348000	A little bit of technical discussion about the fact that it can retrofit in existing cabinets, reuse Dead Heat, I believe it was called, Dead Heat Riders motorcycle game.
8348000	8361000	Cute trailer video that also includes the Taiko Drum character from Taiko Netasigen, other various bits about what it's going to be powered by as far as the system internal.
8361000	8369000	The really, really weird part about this article is that the author wrote this saying,
8369000	8377000	One thing we are also sure about is that this is not the same game as what Nintendo will be releasing for Wii U later that they are calling Mario Kart 8.
8377000	8379000	Duh?
8379000	8385000	Grand Prix 1 and 2 were NOTHING like ANY existing Mario Kart game.
8385000	8389000	Similar locales, but the active racing was NOTHING.
8389000	8397000	I remember back in the day when you would have Crystal Castles in the arcade, Crystal Castles on the 2600, it's technically supposed to be a port of the arcade game.
8397000	8401000	It's not uncommon to think that home versions of games are ports of the arcade game.
8401000	8404000	So I can see why they're like, this is different than Mario Kart 8.
8404000	8417000	In large part, we are so far removed from that, I don't know, it just struck me in the realization that these games are that different, that the Mario Kart arcade experience is that distinct.
8417000	8424000	But it's just like, minus music games, what else has been similar console and arcade?
8424000	8429000	Time Crisis doesn't really exist in the console space anymore, so far as I know.
8429000	8437000	Sadly, it's because the arcades are dying out. It's Super Street Fighter, but that's where the arcade game was almost based off the console.
8438000	8447000	I guess the answer to this question is Hydro Thunder and H2 Overdrive and that kind of stuff that did show up on the Xbox 360 Marketplace.
8447000	8449000	Xbox Live Arcade Marketplace, rather.
8449000	8455000	Or a game I talked about a couple weeks ago on the show, Midway Arcade Origins, which is actual arcade ports of the emulators.
8455000	8457000	From two decades ago, sure.
8457000	8460000	ActDeafner in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com says,
8460000	8464000	The new arcade Mario Kart has Taiko Drum as a character. I want to play that. That sounds awesome.
8464000	8466000	I said that. I said it was in the trailer.
8466000	8468000	It's very cute. It's very awesome to see.
8468000	8476000	This Nintendo Namco mutual happiness is really, really worthwhile.
8476000	8481000	Dr. Tetsuya says, I played the first Mario Kart arcade game and it was fun. Would love to play the third one.
8481000	8482000	So there you go.
8482000	8487000	Yeah, I actually did too when I was in Arizona. Mesa Golf Land has...
8487000	8489000	They'll get it at Golf Land, whoopee.
8490000	8496000	I believe it was Grand Prix 1. It was very old. The cameras were shot to hell. The display was a little dim.
8496000	8499000	And it was also very, very easy, which was kind of weird.
8499000	8506000	But yeah, for being completely original gameplay mechanics, Mario Kart Grand Prix Arcade is quite fun.
8506000	8509000	If you happen to come across it, definitely check it out.
8510000	8512000	Alright, let's move on. Loki.
8512000	8514000	It's also great for when you're drunk.
8514000	8516000	During your bachelor party.
8516000	8520000	Is that one of the YouTubes on the Orange House video game? I think it is. I think it's still there.
8520000	8524000	It's one of the few. I think that one still gets views. I should make ad money off that.
8524000	8526000	You should. I get a portion though.
8526000	8530000	We'll see. The show still runs. That's your portion.
8532000	8536000	Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about NCAA game.
8536000	8545000	Speaking of a publisher that's really having a karma sink or whatever, EA, holy shit.
8545000	8553000	First, losing the NCAA game. Now, NBA Live.
8553000	8557000	That game has been waiting to come out for years now.
8557000	8562000	They retooled it, retooled it, and the reviews have been fucking terrible.
8562000	8564000	It just looks terrible.
8566000	8568000	They gotta be hurting over EA Sports.
8568000	8574000	Anyways, NCAA. They have sued EA now over the Lightness settlement.
8574000	8585000	And, you know, I guess the $40 million settlement that was going, I guess, to students.
8585000	8589000	Our student athlete. Like this is in their legal dispute.
8589000	8591000	Going back all the way to 2009.
8594000	8600000	And, you know, of course, this is, I guess, regarding, they've not renewed the license.
8600000	8605000	I think they're trying to put it out now as like some sort of EA Sports college football or something like that.
8605000	8607000	Excuse me.
8607000	8619000	They're saying, the collegiate licensing company, the CLC is caught in the middle of a dispute between NCAA and EA, which should not involve us.
8619000	8623000	And the CLC has valued the relationship with both NCAA and EA.
8623000	8629000	While we hope that they can soon resolve their dispute, we see no reason for the CLC to be involved.
8629000	8639000	And, of course, EA has declined a sort of comments regarding, you know, the CLC being involved in this lawsuit in the first place.
8639000	8646000	So, either way, it doesn't look like NCAA is going to be coming back for a college football game next year.
8647000	8653000	That's too bad because that was one of the only good titles in the month of July.
8653000	8656000	Now, I guess it's going to be Persona. Lots of Persona.
8656000	8660000	Persona all year long. You're a Persona.
8660000	8662000	You say that like it's a bad thing.
8662000	8664000	I'm not saying it's like a bad thing.
8664000	8669000	I mean, if you didn't like sports, Persona is what you got.
8669000	8675000	Alright. Well, one thing you can look forward to early next year is the remasters of Final Fantasy X and X-2.
8675000	8678000	Because those remasters are finally dated here for the U.S.
8678000	8683000	I believe they are already out in Japan or about to come out right before the end of the year.
8683000	8684000	December.
8684000	8685000	December something, right?
8685000	8687000	Well, we're getting them in March 2014.
8687000	8690000	Specifically, March 18th, 2014 is when North America gets it.
8690000	8693000	Europe gets it on March 21st.
8693000	8696000	Now, that is the PlayStation 3 versions of the remaster.
8696000	8700000	If you're looking to the Vita version, well, there's been no announcement on that.
8700000	8703000	And a press release from Square Enix Europe said, quote,
8703000	8708000	Full details of the PlayStation Vita version and release timing will be revealed at a future date.
8708000	8712000	Hmm. Hmm.
8712000	8716000	Well, we'll see. We'll see. Poor Vita.
8716000	8720000	You know, it would have been great for the Vita if the Vita version came out first.
8720000	8724000	That would have been really good for the Vita, but, oh well, I guess I shouldn't encourage that.
8724000	8726000	Does the Vita have a fully-fledged Final Fantasy yet?
8726000	8729000	No, it wouldn't have. 13 pre-dated it by a long shot.
8729000	8736000	Yeah, no, Vita doesn't really have anything Final Fantasy, per se, unless you want to count PSP games that you can play on Vita.
8736000	8741000	Like, Tactics was a PlayStation Plus title at one point, and there's plenty of PS1 games.
8741000	8744000	I still have the physical disc, the UMD of that.
8744000	8745000	Yeah.
8745000	8750000	All right, let's get to the mailbag. Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orange.orangeradio.com.
8750000	8754000	And usually DarkSakura jumps in the mailbag.
8754000	8755000	Both are applicable.
8755000	8757000	Well, if she sees things she doesn't like, she might.
8757000	8764000	No, she jumps in the mailbag head first, but since she's not here tonight, I will get the hazmat suit on and jump into the mailbag for you.
8764000	8767000	Just two emails tonight to read here.
8767000	8773000	And the first one comes to us from a person who said, please don't read my name. So, fine, I will not.
8773000	8778000	So, anonymous writes us and says, why I am getting an Xbox One instead of PlayStation 4.
8778000	8781000	The Xbox One is better.
8782000	8788000	The Xbox doesn't require you to pay for a $5 a month PlayStation Plus membership for online multiplayer.
8788000	8794000	The PlayStation 4, however, does require a $5 a month PlayStation Plus membership for online multiplayer.
8794000	8799000	The Xbox One can play used Xbox One games.
8799000	8805000	The PlayStation 4, however, cannot play used Xbox One games.
8805000	8810000	The Xbox will have many exclusive games, such as Killer Instinct, Halo.
8810000	8815000	The Xbox One version of Battlefield 4 will be exclusive to the Xbox One.
8815000	8820000	The Xbox One version of Assassin's Creed, the Xbox One version of Watch Dogs.
8820000	8823000	I can't argue with that. That's solid. That is a solid argument.
8823000	8829000	That is some NeoGaf logic right there. Good job, anonymous emailer. Good job.
8829000	8834000	I'm having one of those moments where it's like, not sure if troll or...
8835000	8840000	You know, you laugh about that, but like, over this week, I've been actually, I've had some downtime at work,
8840000	8843000	so I've been going through the Microsoft retail training program.
8843000	8846000	In fact, I've been actually giving away some DLC codes I got from that.
8846000	8853000	But holy shit, man, that is some of their arguments for the Xbox One.
8853000	8858000	Hey, you can play used games on it. I'm like, yeah. Cool.
8858000	8863000	All those games that have just sat around for years and years, and I don't really feel like bringing them out again.
8863000	8868000	You know what would have really been news? You can play all your last generation games on it as well.
8868000	8874000	It's backwards compatible. I'm telling you, from people I know that are more casual gamers,
8874000	8879000	like they like gaming, but they don't seek out shows like this or post to internet websites and things like that,
8879000	8884000	that's the number one bitch I hear is that, well, I don't want to get a PlayStation 4 if it's not going to play PlayStation 3 games.
8884000	8888000	Or, well, does the new Xbox play the other Xbox games? Why not?
8888000	8894000	I hear that more than anything else. I understand why. You probably understand why,
8894000	8899000	because of all the graphic chips upgrades and the parts inside that have changed, where that's not possible.
8899000	8904000	But I'm just telling you, the general public doesn't give a fuck,
8904000	8910000	because there's been other consoles that were backwards compatible that kind of instilled that in us.
8910000	8913000	The Wii played the GameCube games. The Wii U plays the Wii games.
8913000	8915000	The Game Boys are usually backwards compatible and so forth.
8915000	8921000	And even what, Xbox 360 played some Xbox games. PlayStation 3s, when they were new, would play PlayStation 2 games.
8921000	8923000	Mmm, zippy.
8923000	8925000	PS2 did play PS1 games.
8925000	8929000	Yeah, exactly. So there were some consoles in the past that kind of did that. So, I'm just saying.
8929000	8935000	The funny thing is that those consoles are the minority, and especially Nintendo history up until the Wii
8935000	8941000	had no backwards compatibility console-wise, because they didn't fit in slots anymore.
8941000	8946000	And not to mention the shift from cartridge to disc just in general.
8946000	8951000	Yeah, same experience here. I went out to brunch, lunch, something with a friend of mine,
8951000	8956000	and that was one of the very first things out of his mouth, is that the PlayStation 4 isn't...
8956000	8959000	And this was before I knew about the architecture switch.
8959000	8964000	And he said, yeah, I hate Sony now because they're not playing all the games that I already own.
8964000	8968000	I said, that's very strange, especially not even digital versions.
8968000	8972000	As soon as I figured out why that's the case, it all made sense.
8972000	8977000	Same argument you just made. Had another point. Slipped my mind. You know how it goes.
8977000	8981000	Alright. Well, we have another email here. It's from Ross Steel, UT.
8981000	8984000	Ross Steel has a tendency to send the show novels.
8984000	8989000	Ross Steel, I'm going to invite you to post this on our forums in its entirety, because it's a little bit long.
8989000	8994000	Hey, I'm all about where every gamer has a voice, but it is still a three-hour show, so this is quite the little novel here.
8994000	8997000	I'm going to try to get the gist of it here, but I'm going to be extremely paraphrasing.
8997000	9001000	If you do that, remember, TLDR.
9001000	9007000	Yeah, bullet points are great. Like, that last email was a bunch of bullet points, right?
9007000	9012000	No, I don't want to... It's not that the email is bad. It's just I only have a certain amount of time.
9012000	9015000	But the more I talk about the time frames, the longer we drag things out.
9015000	9023000	So let me read a portion of this email here from Ross Steel, UT, who basically was emailing us to talk about who won the last console generation.
9023000	9027000	And first off was,
9053000	9063000	I won't bring myself so low as to pirate games, but between Steam's offline mode failing me numerous times and the PlayStation Network outage,
9063000	9070000	I don't feel like any of the stuff I buy on a DRM platform is actually mine, so I abandoned those libraries and counted the loss as a lesson learned.
9070000	9076000	I learned not to trust one iota of what I'm told in the gaming media. This show accepted, of course.
9076000	9083000	I don't really consider ourselves gaming media, because we're not trying to break... Just an aside here, I don't consider ourselves gaming media, because we're not trying to break news, we're just trying to talk about it.
9083000	9090000	But I also hate the term gaming enthusiast, because some news doesn't make us enthusiastic. We're just gaming talkers.
9090000	9099000	What else would you call it? I guess Bobby uses the term gaming commentator, but then I feel like I'm talking about a sports ball.
9099000	9101000	Casting, casting, Starcraft, and all that kind of stuff.
9101000	9105000	We're just people talking shit. That's what we are. We're people talking shit.
9105000	9109000	Alright, anyhow. He says in his email here,
9109000	9115000	This generation, we saw gaming journalism degrade into the worst state it's been in since the crash of 83.
9115000	9122000	Reviews are made based on how big a franchise is, not to appease publishers, but to keep the fanboys off their asses.
9122000	9125000	I learned to love Killzone, was something he said.
9125000	9130000	The franchise started off as an also ran on the PlayStation 2, a laughable attempt at a Halo killer.
9130000	9135000	However, the ensuing games have shown remarkable improvement, both in gameplay and storytelling,
9135000	9139000	and it's been an absolute pleasure to see the progress Guerrilla Games has made.
9139000	9147000	Let's see. I want to read some of these PS's too, because they're really good.
9147000	9150000	PS, you guys were wondering about what made a cult game.
9150000	9154000	I like to think of it in the same way as a cult movie, where it doesn't have a huge mainstream success,
9154000	9158000	but instead finds a smaller, more dedicated, and enduring fan base.
9158000	9162000	Showgirls and Rocky Horror may not have made a lot of money at the box office,
9162000	9167000	but they'll likely be remembered long after people have forgotten about the latest superhero fad movie.
9167000	9171000	And PPS, the most important part of the entire email. You ready?
9171000	9176000	PPS. Really, Loki? You gotta up your game when it comes to parody porn names.
9176000	9180000	Here's some you can use next time the topic comes up on the house.
9180000	9183000	The Dark Knight Hardens.
9183000	9185000	Shaving Private Ryan.
9185000	9187000	I don't remember what the hell this was in reference to.
9187000	9189000	The Shaw-Skank Redemption.
9189000	9191000	Or the Cock of Steel.
9191000	9194000	We were talking about porn on the last show.
9194000	9198000	It was OLR. We were talking about porn. It happens.
9198000	9199000	Here you go.
9199000	9204000	Alright, thank you RawsteelUT. Sorry I had to edit, but we gotta keep things moving here,
9204000	9206000	because the show is already running long.
9206000	9211000	If you want to email us some thoughts, mailbag at orangelaunchreader.com is the place to do so.
9211000	9214000	You can also send us a tweet, twitter.com slash OLR.
9214000	9217000	Let's get to the FUs of the week. Why?
9217000	9222000	Because we're mad and stuff and we're not going to take it anymore.
9239000	9241000	Jason, would you like to start us off tonight?
9241000	9246000	I shall. FU to traffic. FU to parking.
9246000	9248000	FU to critical mass.
9248000	9253000	I mean, I love the human ingenuity and the things that especially in San Francisco and Manhattan
9253000	9261000	and any other completely over-full to the brim location, what they have to deal with.
9261000	9265000	You know, God bless people's ingenuity and the way that they make things work.
9265000	9267000	God damn, fuck critical mass.
9267000	9270000	That stuff's just frustrating. Yeah, that's it.
9271000	9273000	Uh, Logie?
9273000	9278000	Um, FU cookie quicker. I don't know why I'm so famous.
9278000	9280000	Amen.
9280000	9286000	My FU of the week goes to my scale, because it told me something I didn't want to hear yesterday.
9286000	9288000	I'm very angry at it.
9288000	9293000	So also FU to the lack of motivation I have when it comes to doing something about that.
9293000	9297000	So I've really got to hunker down and do something about it, so we'll see.
9297000	9301000	So stay tuned to figure out what fad diet I go on in our next episode.
9301000	9303000	We'll see.
9303000	9308000	Alright, let's get back into a few more gaming news stories than Twitter topics and Skype line and all that good stuff.
9308000	9312000	1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9312000	9314000	But first, a couple more quick stories.
9314000	9315000	Logie?
9315000	9318000	You know, you could just pick up one of those Wii Fit meters and then you could download Wii Fit U for free.
9318000	9326000	I know, and I could get the balance board out from under the TV, but Logie, it's so hard.
9326000	9330000	You have to lift that TV and then the TV will be lower, Logie.
9330000	9336000	What else is going to raise the TV up that perfect amount that the Wii Balance Board does?
9336000	9338000	Cable box.
9338000	9340000	Don't you have a story to read?
9340000	9345000	Today I've walked 7,500 miles and three and a half...
9345000	9347000	Wow, not that many miles.
9347000	9351000	7,500 steps and three and a half miles.
9351000	9353000	What is that? Fitbit?
9353000	9355000	Oh, you've got a Fitbit? Do you like that?
9355000	9357000	I really do. It's actually...
9357000	9361000	Does it actually get you to walk more though? Because I could get a Fitbit and be like, hey, look how much I walked today.
9361000	9367000	But it doesn't matter if I'm not doing more than what I did already.
9367000	9372000	Inherently no, but it makes the motivation easier when I go to actually do it.
9372000	9379000	Does Fitbit have a social thing where I can go like, let's say you and I both have Fitbit and I get a higher score than you.
9379000	9384000	I walk more steps. I can send you a text message that's like, haha, I'm better than you. Here's proof.
9385000	9394000	Maybe not bragging rights, but I was actually just commenting on something of our good old buddy Big Red Pimps post a couple days ago.
9394000	9397000	He's on a fitness kick right now and he's already lighter than me.
9397000	9402000	He started a couple months ago. He's already lighter than me and I need to really do the same.
9402000	9408000	But he's been the top of the Fitbit leaderboards for weeks now and it's him talking about that.
9408000	9410000	Oh, so there are Fitbit leaderboards?
9410000	9417000	Absolutely. I'm in my employer's group as well as I have my selection of friends.
9417000	9419000	So there is E-peen to it. There is E-peen to it.
9419000	9426000	Absolutely. There are badges. There are goals. There is a good combination of everything to increase the...
9426000	9432000	Lower the barrier to entry, raise the motivation enough that you might actually get off your lazy ass and do it.
9432000	9433000	How much is a Fitbit?
9433000	9437000	Ranges from $70 to $120. There's a couple different moments.
9437000	9439000	$70?
9440000	9441000	Lord, that's a lot of money.
9441000	9445000	That's a lot of money. That's a lot of money for bragging rights about I walked more than you.
9445000	9449000	Then again, not getting thinner just sitting here doing a radio show.
9449000	9453000	I would say just use your DS, but that unfortunately doesn't... that negates Fitbit at all.
9453000	9455000	It's fucking snacking too. Snacking is my worst enemy.
9455000	9457000	Should I slap you when you go up to go get some more of them?
9457000	9459000	No, because I'm hungry.
9459000	9461000	Me too, but I'm not going to eat until frickin' midnight.
9461000	9462000	Anyways, Loki.
9462000	9463000	Do you want some pretzels?
9463000	9464000	Sorry, no.
9464000	9465000	Loki.
9466000	9470000	Alright, so the inevitable has happened.
9470000	9481000	They're going to bundle a Vita with a PlayStation 4 and sell it in the UK for an undetermined amount of money at some point.
9482000	9487000	That's it. They're really pushing that second screen thing. Remote play and all that fun stuff.
9487000	9491000	Hopefully you get a good price, because I don't think they had a price on it.
9492000	9498000	That's it, huh? Do you think this will actually sell? Because that's an expensive bundle.
9498000	9505000	If it's at a good price, if you're like, you know, saving quite a bit of money on it, then yeah, it should sell.
9505000	9509000	If there is no price break on it, then fuck them.
9509000	9516000	Alright, this last story I have here doesn't totally have to do with gaming, but you know what?
9516000	9524000	It definitely has to do with tech, and it's got a lot of people talking this week, and I wanted to bring it up here on the show.
9524000	9529000	Y'all know the famous MP3 player Winamp, right?
9529000	9531000	It really whips the llama's ass.
9531000	9536000	That's right, with this little demo story about whooping the llama's ass or whatever Wesley Willis reject lyric that was.
9536000	9541000	Winamp was bought by America Online in June 1999.
9541000	9543000	America Online is still around?
9543000	9548000	And that's when the troubles began. Yeah, guess who owns Joystiq blog, and WoW Insider and all that.
9548000	9555000	TUAW, and the weblog's network is owned by AOL Time Warner.
9555000	9558000	And Huffington Post is part of AOL now, or the other way around, right?
9558000	9562000	So, they've got some stuff. They just, you know, dial-up isn't really what they're known for anymore.
9562000	9566000	But anyway, they did have Winamp, and they bought it in June 1999.
9566000	9571000	It is going to be shutting down. Winamp is shutting down in exactly one month.
9571000	9576000	Sadness. By the way, this also includes Shoutcast, apparently.
9576000	9580000	Now, what was exciting is that there were some rumors going around, I don't know if there's any truth to this,
9580000	9585000	that Microsoft was looking at buying them once AOL announced that they were going to shut them down.
9585000	9589000	I don't know why Microsoft would necessarily want them, but as somebody who, you know,
9589000	9595000	helps to run a Shoutcast network, like vognetwork.com is on a Shoutcast server,
9595000	9601000	I would like to see Microsoft buy it and then implement it onto Xbox One,
9601000	9605000	because I think it would be great if you could get Vognetwork directly onto Xbox One.
9605000	9608000	But I sadly don't think that's going to be happening.
9608000	9612000	So yeah, Winamp is going to be closing. Now, here's the thing.
9612000	9615000	They can't go and uninstall the program off your computer.
9615000	9619000	So a lot of people have been asking, like, well, what's going to happen to all the Shoutcasters?
9619000	9621000	Once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet.
9621000	9625000	As far as we know, nothing is going to happen to the Shoutcasters.
9625000	9629000	As long as there's people still selling Shoutcast server spaces over, we have a place to go.
9629000	9633000	Yeah, it'll take down the official Shoutcast stream directory,
9633000	9637000	but if you still have your own server, you still have the technology, nothing changes.
9637000	9643000	So vognetwork's not going anywhere, but does this motivate us to possibly explore other options in 2014?
9643000	9648000	Eh, sure. But I'll tell you, Bobby and I are both very much at the school of thought of,
9648000	9651000	if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
9651000	9655000	And why are you wagging your finger at me, Jason?
9655000	9659000	Because I'm very counter to that. I like new features and new things.
9659000	9662000	Jason was like, you're using Winamp 2.0.
9662000	9669000	We had multiple revelations today. He's using a 7-year-old MIRC.
9670000	9675000	He's using no-shit Winamp 2.0, not even 5 with the 2.0 style.
9675000	9679000	He's using Internet Explorer 6 on this PC, for fuck's sake.
9679000	9683000	I'm using Firefox to browse. I don't actually use Internet Explorer.
9683000	9689000	Internet Explorer 6 is still present, and I saw it jump up, and I was almost in tears.
9689000	9694000	And XP, which has been dead for how many years?
9694000	9697000	Okay, hold on, hold on. This Winamp is 5.572.
9698000	9701000	You lied to me. It's just using the 2.0 style.
9701000	9704000	I get it, there are certain situations that call for it.
9704000	9708000	5.5 is not the newest, though, because I get a pop-up window every time I launch it saying,
9708000	9712000	shouldn't you update your Winamp? I'm like, no, fucking leave me alone,
9712000	9715000	because when I update things, they break. Always.
9715000	9718000	I like doing new things, I like new features.
9718000	9722000	I'm not a bleeding-edge kind of guy, but I'm not far from it.
9723000	9729000	Alright, anyhow, VoG will continue until it really does break,
9729000	9731000	and we are forced to switch to something else.
9731000	9736000	Or, somebody sells us real good on the advantages of using something else,
9736000	9738000	which is always a possibility, too.
9738000	9739000	Possible.
9739000	9743000	Jason's eyes lit up. I'm gonna get an email tomorrow.
9743000	9745000	Reasons why you should be on Icecast.
9745000	9749000	That's what's gonna happen.
9750000	9751000	Yeah, anyways.
9751000	9758000	Alright, that was it. Let me now switch our status on our un-updated Skype,
9758000	9761000	which I'm still using 6.6, even though I think there's a 7.0 now.
9761000	9764000	I refuse to update Skype.
9764000	9768000	I was on a call, you can call us now, 1877-GameOLR,
9768000	9770000	or username on Skype, orangeandandrea.
9770000	9771000	I refuse to update Skype.
9771000	9773000	Are we gonna get any calls from an Xbox One?
9773000	9775000	I hope so. Let's see.
9775000	9777000	If you've got an Xbox One, fire it up and give us a call.
9777000	9780000	Phone lines are already lighting up, so let's go to it.
9780000	9782000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9782000	9784000	This is Ravenstaufen. Can you hear me?
9784000	9787000	Oh, yes, we can. Hi, and your video just popped up. What's up?
9787000	9789000	Oh, good. I got it.
9789000	9792000	You got your gold 3DS. You just held it up there.
9792000	9795000	Yeah, and I also got the game with it. I must be stupid.
9795000	9801000	Wait a minute. You got the game and the console, even though the game's already on the console?
9801000	9805000	Yeah, well, what happened was, I was listening to your last week's show,
9805000	9810000	and then I went like, you know, I bought the game at midnight with the rest of the X-Bone people,
9810000	9813000	and then I said, you know what, I'm gonna go buy it.
9813000	9816000	How was that, being the Nintendo guy in the line?
9816000	9818000	Oh, there was four of us.
9818000	9821000	There was four of us there. We're all shouting at Zelda.
9821000	9825000	It was actually a little powwow. It was absolutely cool. I loved it.
9825000	9828000	I even got the X-Bone shirt to prove. Sorry for showing off.
9828000	9832000	That's all right. Ravenstaufen is taking off his clothes on cam right now.
9833000	9835000	Banned from Twitch TV.
9835000	9839000	I will put this on the list of reasons why Orange Launch Radio should have a video.
9839000	9842000	I will add that Ravenstaufen gets naked.
9843000	9844000	Just, I'm kidding.
9844000	9847000	Wish for what you don't need to know.
9849000	9855000	Raven, I can't help but notice behind you, I love that little Pikachu Pokemon banner thing you've got.
9855000	9858000	Yeah, this is my little room that I broadcast on.
9858000	9861000	I know you have a little room, but this is the setup.
9861000	9865000	Some people call it a dining room, but we call it the broadcast room, yes.
9865000	9870000	Yeah, it's just a little room that I have posters of Grand Theft Auto and all that stuff.
9870000	9874000	All the consoles are in here so I can just chill out, just shut the door and go like,
9874000	9875000	GO AWAY!
9875000	9878000	Nice. Every man needs a man cave.
9878000	9881000	Yeah, this one's pretty small, but it's awesome.
9881000	9883000	It's not the size, it's how you use it.
9883000	9888000	Yeah, I was calling because I'm sure you played Zelda.
9888000	9891000	Does it make the case for 3D for you as well?
9893000	9897000	I was already kind of like, I don't hate 3D.
9897000	9903000	It was always kind of a neat effect to me, but I don't think games should really rely on it either,
9903000	9906000	because there's so many people that can't see it, you know, too.
9906000	9909000	But does it have impressive graphics?
9909000	9914000	Does it really show what 3DS can do with the 3D?
9914000	9915000	Absolutely.
9915000	9920000	I was really impressed with, just like in the dungeons where you have the multiple levels,
9920000	9925000	how you can really see that top and bottom, and just like when you jump off cliffs,
9925000	9931000	or my absolute favorite, when you grab a chicken and then jump off a cliff and slowly fly down,
9931000	9934000	like yeah, that stuff looks rad on the 3DS.
9934000	9938000	Yeah, I really enjoyed a lot of this game.
9938000	9944000	I like that it's top down, and it really does look like you're looking down on the action,
9944000	9946000	and it really looks very nice.
9946000	9948000	Yeah. No, it's great. I love it.
9948000	9953000	And I think it makes a good case for not getting a 2DS.
9953000	9954000	It really does.
9954000	9958000	I mean, if anyone's playing on a 2DS, I feel you're missing out on something.
9958000	9962000	Like, just the death of just seeing that go deeper is just, it's something that,
9962000	9966000	even with the, how are you liking the bigger screens now that you have a big DS?
9966000	9969000	Oh, and now it's like, I'm doing one of those things where it's like,
9969000	9973000	how did I go so long with my regular 3DS?
9973000	9975000	Like, how did I manage that?
9975000	9978000	Because now that I'm on the 3DS XL, I'm like, oh my God, this is so beautiful. I love it.
9978000	9983000	Yeah, so, but that's like a lot of different upgrade things.
9983000	9984000	It's like the iPhones, right?
9984000	9988000	When I'm on the 4 for so long, and then when I finally get the 5, it's like,
9988000	9991000	God damn, how did I use that shitty phone for so long?
9991000	9993000	But it's just, that's the way tech works.
9993000	9994000	Tech is like that.
9994000	9999000	One last thing, I mean, I'm still keeping my purple 3DS because I'm still attached to it.
9999000	10002000	I can't transfer anything over because I have the circle pad.
10002000	10005000	So I have to keep everything nice and clean on this one.
10005000	10007000	So Fire Card 7 can't come over.
10007000	10011000	Oh, dang, that's right, because there's no circle pad for the XL, is there?
10011000	10015000	There is, it's just, I only have the circle pad for the 3DS.
10015000	10016000	Gotcha.
10016000	10021000	Oh no, I moved everything over and I bought a 32 gig card, 30 bucks at Radio Shack,
10021000	10024000	so I will never run into storage issues again.
10024000	10025000	That's the goal.
10025000	10026000	That's what I need to do.
10026000	10031000	I have an 8 and a 16, and I'm like debating like, all right, this is my default one,
10031000	10034000	and it looks like I might have to just make everything from scratch
10034000	10038000	or either beat Revelations on the 3DS and then move it all over later.
10038000	10043000	I was rocking a 2 gig SD card on my original 3DS and I don't know how I did it.
10043000	10044000	I don't know how the hell I did it.
10044000	10045000	I'm rocking.
10045000	10046000	I still am.
10046000	10047000	Wow.
10047000	10048000	It's not enough.
10048000	10050000	All right, well, Raven, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls,
10050000	10052000	but thank you so much for the call and the video chat.
10052000	10053000	We appreciate it.
10053000	10054000	Oh, not at all.
10054000	10055000	I'm glad you can answer my call.
10055000	10056000	Bye, peace.
10056000	10057000	Later.
10057000	10058000	Always good to hear from Raven.
10058000	10060000	I do love the fact that you wave into the monitor.
10060000	10061000	I know, I still wave.
10061000	10064000	God, here I am talking about, we don't need a stinking video show,
10064000	10069000	and then I'm like, I keep playing into the video stuff.
10069000	10071000	Clearly, I don't know what I'm talking about,
10071000	10073000	but if you've been listening for 11 years, you already know that.
10073000	10074000	Hi, you're on the phone, sir.
10074000	10075000	Who's there?
10075000	10077000	It's the one and only DJ Ron Mess.
10077000	10078000	Hi, Rama.
10078000	10079000	How are you?
10079000	10080000	I am good.
10080000	10081000	How about you, good sir?
10081000	10085000	Good, except I'm learning slowly tonight that I'm always wrong.
10085000	10089000	That's been like pretty much my entire life, so I feel for you.
10089000	10090000	Let's start a club.
10090000	10092000	Ooh, and booze should be involved.
10092000	10094000	I'm right by the fridge.
10094000	10096000	I still have leftover vanilla vodka.
10096000	10097000	Fuck yes.
10097000	10098000	What's the old saying?
10098000	10101000	Here's to you, here's to me, best of friends will always be,
10101000	10105000	but if we should ever disagree, fuck you, and here's to me.
10105000	10106000	You got that right.
10106000	10107000	Yes, cling.
10107000	10108000	All right.
10108000	10109000	Sorry, Rama.
10109000	10111000	You didn't call in to sing drinking songs with me,
10111000	10113000	even though it's probably a nice little sidebar,
10113000	10115000	but what is really on your mind tonight?
10115000	10116000	Any...
10116000	10118000	Rob, it's happy hour somewhere, right?
10118000	10123000	It's happy hour at OLR, at vognetwork.com, between...
10123000	10129000	Well, we have the family friendly bar at between 5 o'clock and 6 o'clock Pacific,
10129000	10132000	and then we have adults only 18 and up after...
10132000	10134000	Oh, you're so bad.
10134000	10135000	You're so bad.
10135000	10137000	I'm not bad, I'm just...
10137000	10140000	We have a family friendly bar from 5 to 6.
10140000	10142000	That's not wrong.
10142000	10145000	No, the funny thing is when we open up the bar in the chat room,
10145000	10147000	someone gets kind of upset because it's family friendly.
10148000	10152000	I get in trouble when I'm not family friendly between 5 and 6,
10152000	10154000	so I've got to be careful.
10154000	10155000	All right.
10155000	10157000	What's really on your mind, Rama?
10157000	10161000	The Legend of Zelda I link between worlds.
10161000	10162000	You've been playing it?
10162000	10167000	Yes, let's just say there was a reason why I was late to work one Friday.
10167000	10169000	Wow, really?
10169000	10171000	Yes, yeah.
10171000	10176000	I was underlined amongst the people that were picking up PlayStation 4s and Xbox Ones,
10176000	10178000	so...
10178000	10182000	So were you like Raven where there was like four people there,
10182000	10186000	like little Nintendo camps in the line, or was it just you or what?
10186000	10189000	No, it was just one line for everything pretty much,
10189000	10195000	but I did notice that there were some people changing their minds in their PS4 pickups,
10195000	10198000	and they were asking people, does anyone want a PS4?
10198000	10200000	We have like three here.
10200000	10201000	Nobody said anything.
10201000	10202000	Oh, wow.
10202000	10203000	Interesting.
10203000	10205000	Well, where's your head at with the...
10205000	10207000	I mean, I know you've been playing Zelda.
10207000	10208000	I'll grow you more on that in a minute,
10208000	10211000	but where's your head at with the whole PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and all that?
10211000	10213000	Are you getting one, or what are you doing?
10213000	10217000	I plan on getting a PlayStation 4 when the order comes out.
10217000	10218000	Oh.
10218000	10221000	It's a steampunk first-person shooter.
10221000	10223000	That's the reason why I want to pick it up.
10223000	10227000	As a convention-goer, I can see where that's relevant to your interests.
10227000	10229000	Mm-hmm.
10229000	10230000	All right, so tell me more about Zelda.
10230000	10234000	What do you think about the game itself?
10234000	10237000	It's so surreal, especially on the XL.
10237000	10241000	It's like a total throwback from me sitting there on the Super NES,
10241000	10244000	playing through the game from start to finish.
10244000	10247000	The music is just phenomenal.
10247000	10252000	I just have a couple of gripes with the game, but other than that, I'm enjoying it.
10252000	10255000	What are the gripes, because in order to be,
10255000	10257000	and I hate to use this term, fair and balanced,
10257000	10259000	but I don't know what else to say, in order to be fair...
10259000	10261000	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
10261000	10262000	Why did it just become Fox News?
10262000	10263000	Come on.
10263000	10265000	This is actually a fair and balanced discussion.
10265000	10267000	I know, I know.
10267000	10271000	To try and bring a little balance to all the positivity I was barfing on the game earlier,
10271000	10273000	what are the gripes you have?
10273000	10276000	Well, for me, I like the top-down view,
10276000	10280000	but I remember from the Super NES version, from the top-down view,
10280000	10286000	you could see more of Link's face and body, so it was more like the angle.
10286000	10292000	But in this version, all you can pretty much see is the top of the hero's head and his hair.
10293000	10296000	I do feel like we saw a little more,
10296000	10301000	like the view radius was a little more on the Super Nintendo as well,
10301000	10303000	but maybe I'm crazy.
10303000	10306000	I mean, it's not like a game-ruiner, but I noticed it.
10306000	10308000	Yeah.
10308000	10311000	And the second issue I have is that now,
10311000	10315000	I've never really followed the lore of Zelda,
10315000	10318000	but I do know that I think it was with the first N64 game,
10318000	10322000	is when the lore of Zelda, the storyline split,
10322000	10326000	where you have adventures where it's just Link in the game,
10326000	10329000	and then there's a storyline where it's the hero.
10329000	10333000	I'm putting the game in thinking it's Link and a brand new adventure.
10333000	10339000	I'm thinking it's going to pick up sort of where A Link to the Past left off, per se.
10339000	10342000	But no, you're playing as the hero.
10342000	10346000	Because you can name the hero whatever you want.
10346000	10348000	That's the difference.
10348000	10351000	No, I guess you could do that in some of the other ones,
10351000	10355000	but I think that plays into it somehow, that you don't have to name him Link.
10355000	10357000	Sure. All the games are like that.
10357000	10360000	Even from the Super NES one, you can name whatever,
10360000	10362000	but you were still Link.
10362000	10364000	Can you do that on Twilight Princess and stuff?
10364000	10367000	I thought you couldn't, but it's just been so long.
10367000	10371000	I always name them Link anyway. I kind of just don't notice it.
10372000	10378000	That was my issue. I'd rather play as Link.
10378000	10381000	I don't mean to split hands, but that's how I kind of feel.
10381000	10385000	You're the hero, but the hero looks just like Link.
10385000	10390000	In Final Fantasy, you can technically rename all the characters as well.
10390000	10392000	In almost all the Final Fantasy games, you can rename the characters,
10392000	10394000	at least until the instituted voice acting.
10394000	10401000	I can't play Final Fantasy VI and not have Terra and Locke and all that.
10401000	10408000	I think everybody does that one playthrough where you start naming your characters butts, fart, penis.
10408000	10415000	For me, I renamed them as characters from Ronda and the What Happened.
10415000	10420000	I'm following through the storyline, and I'm picturing the personalities in the game.
10420000	10422000	It fits so well.
10422000	10430000	It's just that I'd like to be Link, but with a different name, but I know the game is around him,
10430000	10436000	not the games around the hero that's supposed to be filling the shoes that belonged to Link.
10438000	10441000	That is a minor gripe though, right?
10441000	10445000	At the end of the day, it doesn't really impact the game, which is fantastic.
10445000	10453000	Right. As I was saying earlier in the chat about it, when I called A Link Between Worlds Second Quest,
10453000	10456000	I say it's Second Quest, whereas if you remember in the first game,
10456000	10459000	if you played through Second Quest, everything was different.
10459000	10461000	One thing was it was something else.
10461000	10463000	That's how I'm seeing this game.
10463000	10468000	Everything is there, but when you go into certain locations, things have changed.
10468000	10472000	It's like, wow, it's been 10, 15 years since I've been here,
10472000	10478000	so there's more for me to explore, or if I go into this store, oh, this is something else.
10478000	10481000	That is true, but there's also the new mechanics to consider,
10481000	10485000	especially the flattening yourself on the wall really kind of changes things
10485000	10488000	and shows you more parts of the world that weren't even there, but I guess that's the point.
10488000	10489000	Mm-hmm.
10489000	10490000	All right.
10490000	10493000	I'm going to let you go to try and squeeze in another call, but thanks for the call.
10493000	10494000	Hey, anytime, bro.
10494000	10495000	All right, take care, buddy.
10495000	10496000	You too.
10496000	10501000	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you'd like to give us a call.
10501000	10506000	We have time for at least one more call here if you are interested in talking with us tonight.
10506000	10508000	I want to get to Twitter topics.
10508000	10510000	I also want to ask Loki if he has any last-minute stories
10510000	10514000	or if you are too busy clicking cookies over there.
10514000	10515000	No, I have last-minute stories.
10515000	10516000	Okay.
10516000	10525000	Apparently, there's been reports that you can have some issues,
10525000	10533000	maybe even possibly a band if you upload stuff to the upload studio on Xbox One with obscenities in there.
10533000	10535000	Mm-hmm.
10535000	10541000	So maybe as a glitch or something, but there has been some reports regarding that.
10541000	10542000	All right.
10542000	10543000	Be careful.
10543000	10549000	We got another call coming in, so let's get to it, and then we'll take whatever last-minute stories otherwise that Loki has.
10549000	10550000	Let's get to it.
10550000	10551000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
10551000	10554000	Who's this?
10554000	10556000	Bienvenidos a OrangeLoungeRadio.
10556000	10557000	You there?
10557000	10559000	Caller.
10559000	10560000	Hello.
10560000	10561000	I don't know.
10561000	10565000	Yeah, Skype seems to think the caller isn't there, so I'm going to have to let that call go.
10565000	10568000	Sorry about it, but go ahead and try again.
10568000	10573000	Remember, Echo123 is your friend to test before you call.
10573000	10575000	I haven't heard that name in years.
10575000	10576000	What?
10576000	10577000	Echo123.
10577000	10578000	Echo123.
10578000	10582000	I would love to see an Xbox One call, so please, if you have your Xbox One,
10582000	10585000	I want to see what the quality looks like.
10585000	10590000	See you sitting on your couch there, giving a call.
10590000	10593000	Maybe I can give the voice command, and it'll work.
10593000	10596000	Xbox, Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
10596000	10599000	Now if somebody is playing, it's going to fuck them up.
10599000	10600000	Sorry.
10600000	10601000	I had to.
10601000	10604000	Xbox, open Skype.
10604000	10606000	Now everybody's going to go hit stop.
10606000	10608000	Oh, we're getting another call here.
10608000	10609000	If I did, I apologize.
10609000	10610000	All right, yeah.
10610000	10611000	I know, right?
10611000	10612000	Who's this?
10612000	10615000	Maybe I can give the voice command, and it'll work.
10615000	10616000	Xbox, Skype.
10616000	10617000	Hello?
10617000	10618000	Go ahead and mute the...
10618000	10620000	I think they got scared.
10620000	10622000	Mute your radio before you call in.
10622000	10624000	That's always a good idea.
10624000	10626000	Otherwise, we hear ourselves echoing.
10626000	10627000	It's a little awkward.
10627000	10628000	Or just headphones.
10628000	10631000	That was the name I didn't recognize, so...
10631000	10634000	Echo123 again, and...
10634000	10638000	Or maybe that person just accidentally called us because of what you did.
10639000	10642000	Hey, you're the one that said Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
10642000	10644000	I just said open Skype.
10644000	10645000	That's true.
10645000	10646000	Come on, you went the whole nine yards.
10646000	10647000	That's true.
10647000	10649000	It would be really funny, because that person hung up right away.
10649000	10650000	Maybe that really did dial.
10650000	10651000	I don't know.
10651000	10653000	Should we try it again?
10653000	10655000	No, don't do it again.
10655000	10656000	I'm going to get hate mail.
10656000	10657000	Loki, go ahead.
10657000	10659000	If you have more last minute stories.
10659000	10661000	I don't.
10661000	10662000	Oh, well, goddamn.
10662000	10663000	Sorry.
10663000	10664000	All right.
10664000	10666000	Let me...
10666000	10669000	I'm trying to pull up our Twitter, but I got sidetracked.
10669000	10672000	But I know we had some tweets here tonight.
10672000	10673000	Let's see.
10673000	10674000	YYR tweets us.
10674000	10678000	Guess what comes out for 3DS in North America and Europe in four days?
10678000	10682000	Space Harrier and Super Hang-On and Glorious 3D.
10682000	10683000	Instabuy.
10683000	10684000	I forgot about those.
10684000	10685000	I'm excited about that as well.
10685000	10688000	Too Bad Dark Soccer's not here tonight to give you a little squee.
10688000	10689000	But...
10689000	10690000	Squeak!
10690000	10691000	Squeak!
10691000	10693000	Here you go.
10693000	10695000	Let's see.
10695000	10700000	Gali89 tweeted us this little acapella Mega Man 2 Wily stage.
10700000	10704000	I didn't screen the YouTube first, so I'm not going to play it right now.
10704000	10709000	But I love seeing that type of remixed homegrown stuff on YouTube.
10709000	10710000	Always fun.
10710000	10716000	CatastrophicMoggie also excited about Atlus announcing Persona 5, giving us the links just in case we missed it.
10716000	10718000	Dungeonbuster says,
10719000	10723000	First thing I thought of listening to Yakuza 5's Battle of Pride was OLR.
10723000	10726000	Makes me sad it's not getting localized.
10726000	10728000	Oh, I got to give this as a shoutout too.
10728000	10730000	This came in through our Twitter and I got to say hi to this.
10730000	10733000	This came from Video Game Bang.
10733000	10734000	And they said,
10734000	10736000	Hi, you're a Sacramento gaming podcast.
10736000	10738000	We're a Sacramento gaming podcast.
10738000	10740000	Let's be friends.
10740000	10744000	So shoutout to our new frenzies at Video Game Bang.
10744000	10745000	And I did reply and said,
10745000	10747000	Okay, BFF's forever.
10747000	10750000	So there you go. Hello to Video Game Bang.
10750000	10752000	Although I'm going to be honest, it's just the pervo in me.
10752000	10755000	But every time I look at the name, I see Video Gang Bang.
10755000	10757000	And I'm like, I need to get glasses there.
10757000	10760000	No, I'm not. I'm sure it's a fantastic show.
10760000	10762000	I will check it out this week.
10762000	10764000	Both are fantastic shows.
10764000	10765000	What?
10765000	10767000	Both are fantastic shows.
10767000	10769000	I'm sure that is true as well.
10769000	10773000	I will check out Video Game Bang later this week.
10773000	10775000	Wouldn't it be funny if they lived next door?
10775000	10778000	You never know. They're in Sac somewhere.
10778000	10780000	Should we knock on the wall and find out?
10780000	10783000	Well, I'm not far from Sac State.
10783000	10786000	So I'm sure there's a lot of stuff that brews out of the college there.
10786000	10788000	Alright, anyhow.
10788000	10790000	The phones are ringing one more time.
10790000	10793000	We're going to try and take this call and then we'll wrap up.
10793000	10795000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
10797000	10800000	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
10800000	10803000	Hello, this is Omega777.
10803000	10804000	Hello.
10804000	10808000	There you are. You made it, Omega777. What's up, buddy?
10808000	10820000	That was me that I guess tried to call earlier and ended up with the sound from the radio coming in and it didn't...
10820000	10823000	Well, 50 points from Gryffindor, but what's on your mind?
10823000	10834000	Okay, basically I figured out the reason why there wasn't a whole lot of... was it midnight releases or camp outs for Wii U last year.
10834000	10848000	And basically, as it turns out, because it was done on a Sunday, I guess as it usually is, a lot of the big box retail stores didn't want to do any midnight releases.
10848000	10854000	I guess they figured it wouldn't be a commercially safe thing to do.
10854000	10856000	Jesus would not approve.
10856000	10859000	Yeah, definitely.
10859000	10865000	I'm assuming that's what it is. Well, you know what, especially in some parts of the company, you don't mess around with Sundays.
10865000	10870000	Especially asking people to stay up all night till midnight when there's church the next day.
10870000	10873000	That is asking too much, especially in some places.
10873000	10880000	So it's not a far-fetched theory, to be honest. But could it also be true that maybe the demand just wasn't there?
10880000	10889000	But I seem to think the Wii U sold pretty well initially. It was what happened after the initial release that was problematic.
10890000	10900000	Yeah, a lot of the consoles, they'll have their glitches and whatnot, but in the end, they'll overcome them.
10900000	10905000	And I'm sure Wii U will definitely catch up with everyone else in the future.
10905000	10912000	BlackWolf in our chat room wants to point out, I got my Wii U at a midnight release, so there were stores that did a midnight release for the Wii U.
10912000	10915000	Maybe it just depends on where you were at.
10915000	10921000	But Amiga777, where are you at with these next-gen consoles? Have you picked any of them up?
10921000	10926000	Are you Team Sony, Team Nintendo, Team Microsoft, or all teams? Where's your head at with this?
10926000	10937000	I'm not a person of that on any team yet. I guess you could say, funnily enough, I'm probably just still Team Sega.
10937000	10940000	Dreamcast, that is.
10941000	10948000	Fair enough. I think there's a lot of people that can't let go. You do know they remake all those games for the newer consoles? No, I understand.
10948000	10955000	Oh, yes, definitely. I do know that. I mean, I do have a 360 now. I play it every once in a while.
10955000	10961000	So that's what it's going to take? First console to get Shenmue 3 announced for it? Instant win?
10961000	10963000	Definitely.
10963000	10968000	Fair enough. Alright, AmigaBuddy, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for the call.
10968000	10969000	Alright, take care.
10969000	10970000	Alright, take care. Bye-bye.
10970000	10975000	So there you go. First console to get Shenmue 3 is an exclusive. You win.
10975000	10982000	Alright, that's it for Last Minute Stories. That's it for Skypline tonight. Thank you guys very much for calling and participating.
10982000	10988000	If you didn't get through, but you wanted to call, 1-877-GATE... You can leave a voicemail, I guess, even though no one ever does.
10988000	10994000	Or you can email us. Mailbag at orangelandsradio.com or tweet us twitter.com slash O-L-R.
10995000	11000000	That's it. We're here at the close of the show. We're done with Last Minute Stories.
11000000	11003000	But before we go tonight, I do want to thank our listeners once again.
11003000	11007000	I know I did this after the break, but I like to, at the end of every show, say thank you guys very much for listening.
11007000	11010000	Thanks for tuning in. Support independent broadcasting.
11010000	11014000	If you like what you heard here at Orange Lawns Radio tonight, we don't charge for the show.
11014000	11021000	Just tell a friend or 5 or 20 about the show. Help spread the word about Orange Lawns Radio. It is much, much appreciated.
11022000	11028000	Leave us a nice review is always appreciated, too. iTunes, Stitcher, or wherever you heard about this show.
11028000	11032000	Help spread the word, because word of mouth is all we got.
11032000	11036000	Jason, speaking of mouths, thank you for loaning yours to the show tonight.
11036000	11040000	That sounds a little awkward, but thank you very much for being here. I really appreciate it.
11040000	11043000	Do you have anything you want to plug while you're here?
11043000	11047000	I... not specifically. Not really of my own anymore.
11047000	11049000	I mean, this is kind of my focus, and otherwise...
11049000	11053000	Do you have a Twitter or some ego site if you have fans that want to follow you?
11053000	11055000	VXJsonXV, practically everywhere.
11055000	11057000	There you go. Practically everywhere.
11057000	11060000	Alright, thank you very much for being here, Jason. I'm sure we'll be seeing...
11060000	11065000	You said you're going to be here in San Francisco through the holidays, so we might be seeing more of you in the coming weeks.
11065000	11068000	You're always welcome here at Studio OLR. Thanks for being here.
11068000	11070000	I will certainly take you up on that.
11070000	11074000	Alright, sounds good. As I always ask people, do you have a final thought tonight on the show?
11075000	11081000	No. Get this podcast up so I can re-listen to it for the two-hour drive back to San Francisco.
11081000	11086000	I will work on it, but tonight I'm going to have the YouTube challenge too, so we'll see.
11086000	11092000	I've been here. I also have a backlog of like 30 hours of music podcasts that I have to get there to.
11092000	11096000	Well, you know, support whatever independent podcast you can think of. I'm sure this isn't the only one you listen to.
11096000	11098000	Yes, absolutely.
11098000	11101000	Of course, I'm quick to recommend those at vognetwork.com.
11101000	11103000	You can always listen to the video game Bang.
11103000	11108000	That's right. There's a new one for you to try. Tell me how it is. I haven't listened to it yet, but I will.
11108000	11114000	Alright. Loki, thank you as always for being here, even though, you know, you don't have a choice.
11114000	11117000	But any final thoughts for us tonight?
11117000	11119000	Uh, tornadoes suck.
11122000	11124000	Is that a cookie clicker thing?
11124000	11126000	No, no. It's a real thing.
11126000	11128000	I hope everybody's okay.
11129000	11135000	I mentioned on Twitter, my company I work for, their warehouse is going to hit by a tornado.
11135000	11138000	Yeah, I saw that earlier in the week. That's so awful.
11138000	11140000	Is that the Ohio stuff?
11140000	11144000	Yeah, there was a lot of really unfortunate stuff in the Midwest this week.
11147000	11153000	Three damaged PS4s out of the whole thing got crushed by the roof. Well, damaged by the roof.
11153000	11160000	The roof fell on the whole pallet of them, and I'm trying again to send them to me.
11160000	11162000	I'll fix them.
11162000	11167000	Between three systems, I'm sure there's enough parts, if not to get at least one of those working.
11167000	11168000	Fix it, Loki.
11168000	11173000	Besides, I mean, the insurance is covering the cost of those anyways. It's not like they're losing money.
11173000	11175000	They're just going to throw them away anyways.
11175000	11177000	Alright, and last but not least, my final thought tonight.
11177000	11183000	And my final thought would be, you know what, I know there's been a lot of positivity and negativity on tonight's show,
11183000	11188000	and there is a lot out there in the gaming industry, but there's a lot of good stuff going on right now.
11188000	11195000	So whether you're Team Wii, Team Sony, Team Xbox, or what have you, just go have fun.
11195000	11199000	There's like a million games to play right now. It's the best time of year to be a gamer. Have fun.
11199000	11200000	Team PC.
11200000	11202000	Team Wii.
11202000	11203000	Shut up.
11203000	11206000	Whatever team you're on, have fun, and don't be a dick.
11206000	11212000	We'll see you next week. Have a safe holiday, those of you in the US, and we'll talk to you again in seven days.
11212000	11213000	Have a wonderful night. Bye.
