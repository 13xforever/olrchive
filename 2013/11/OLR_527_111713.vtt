Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 527 for this November the 17th of 2013

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
My name is Rob Roberts joining over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and gaming lolz

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
And thank you for being here by the way after a week off

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
But I'm joined this week in studio as I am every single stinking week except last week when we were off

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
By the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
How are you doing? Did you have a good week off last week?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
What did you end up doing?

01:07.000 --> 01:15.000
I was in a car the whole time but you know like it's about a 6 or 6 and a half hour drive back from L.A.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
So I'm in the car the whole time and Alan's there too but there's only so much talking you can do and at some point

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
And playing what game am I thinking of?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Yeah that kind of thing

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
We did listen to Bobby's show I will say that we were somewhere in the middle of I don't freaking know

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Probably about an hour south of Santa Nella probably Harris Ranch

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
You California people that know your I5 was around Harris Ranch when Bobby's show came on

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
So that entertained us a little ways but then the whole way home I'm just going

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
And this is where OLR will be starting

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
And here's where Jamie will be doing the Classic Game of the Week

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
And here's where she'd be throwing a fit about reading emails

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I don't throw a fit

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
But just kind of going through that whole like you know after so many years of doing something

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
It's kind of like I should be doing this right now but I'm not

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
We know when we're behind and we know when we're ahead

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
That's right

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Well I hope you had a good week off it was restful and all that stuff

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
I slept

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
That is a great way to spend the time

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Sleep is good

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
That's what Sundays are for

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Also say hello to Tech Master Loki

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Hi

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Hi Loki how are you?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Fine

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
You sound like you might need to be doing a little more sleeping yourself

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
What happened? Did you catch a cold?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Uh yeah

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Did you bring disease to the show tonight?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
I've been staying up late at night

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
Oh is that because of Josh or just you're just doing projects?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Yes it's because of Josh

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
And totally not because I was playing Cookie Clicker last night

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Wait a minute

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Cookie Clicker? Really Loki?

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
I got bored I got bored last night

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
I got bored last night because

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Nellie was messing around with Reddit

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
And so I was talking with her

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
And I was like I don't want to browse Reddit anymore

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
I remember hearing about Cookie Clicker

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Or reading about Cookie Clicker

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
And then I'm like let's see what this thing is

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
So I tried it out

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
And yeah

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
You kind of missed the train Loki

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Because Cookie Clicker was all the rage on my other show

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Horde House about two months ago

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
And I think we're all over it now but

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
You're late to the party that's alright

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
It's alright I just need to finish it and it'll be done

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I didn't realize there was an end to Cookie Clicker

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Oh

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I played the iPhone knock off one

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
That's not the same

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
It isn't the same they really need to put out an official one

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
For the record?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
It's addicting none the less

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
No

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
You're not going to get into Cookie Clicker?

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Hell no

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
What about the other iPhone game I've been playing

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
I can't believe I got sucked into this garbage all over again

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
I really want to thank Kethervis if she's out there listening

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
I don't think she listens to OLR but if she is

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Like I'm doing that whole warning shots at you right now

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
She got me addicted to Tiny Death Star

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Have you seen this?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Yes and I'm not playing it either

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
It's Tiny Tower with the LucasArts franchise

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
With all the Vader and Palpatine and all the characters

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
And cute little midi style Death Star music

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
While it's playing

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
I still refuse

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
You refuse?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
I refuse

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
It's probably for the best

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
The only thing that makes me upset about Tiny Death Star

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
We'll get into real games in a minute I promise

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
The only thing that makes me upset about Tiny Death Star

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Is that you can't rename all the stores

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Because that was the best part of Tiny Tower

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Which is based off his renaming the stores

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
Because Allen would always rename his stores to these hilarious things

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Of course I can't even remember any of them off the top of my head

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Allen what were some of your funny stores

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
You remember any of them on Tiny Tower

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
He's shaking his head I wish I could bring it up and see

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
I know I had a restaurant called Poops R Us

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Yeah

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Just because I was thinking that it gave people diarrhea

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Well there was a

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
The apartment complex I built in the Death Star

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
The Death Star was

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Let me look I'm trying to

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
I'm actually pulling it up as we are live here

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
You can pull up our chat room if you're listening live

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Oh you named it Ewok Shits

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
You can't participate with this show live every Sunday night

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
At the Voice of Geeks Network

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Vognetwork.com

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
And if you are listening live come join us and chat

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Live.vognetwork.com

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Ah here it is the Felucia apartments

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Is one of the apartments I have

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
So I was going to rename it to by Felucia

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
But I couldn't rename it

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Very sad

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Sad trombone

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Womp womp

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Alright anyhow

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
We're going to get into our gaming weeks and all that good stuff

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
We'll talk about all that

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
And what we've been doing with the week

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
But we got a lot of stuff to catch up on too

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
After being gone last week

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Oh Alan came and he brought in his Tiny Tower

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Let me read

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
What? It's still loading

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Live radio everybody

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
I think I deleted it like

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Yeah I finally deleted mine off the phone too

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Let me look at our chat room

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Live.vognetwork.com

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Tim Tripp in chat says

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
I actually played Tiny Death Star for about 30 minutes

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Which is 25 more minutes

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Than I usually spend with an iPhone game

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Dungeon Buster says

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
I'm playing Tiny Death Star

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Never played Tiny Towers before so this is new to me

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
So I guess if it hasn't worn off yet

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Then that's good

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Sandy Ball Gym is called Sandy Balls

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
The Glassworks is called Here Blow This

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
The Breakfast Place is called Enough Fucking Pancakes

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
The Greenhouse

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Florist is called Dankweed 420

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
So yeah

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
And I see your computer lab is called Sierra Online

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
In a nod

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
There you go

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Those weren't even his funniest ones but that's alright

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
There's some funny ones in there

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
We have to settle a few things

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
From when we were gone last week

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
We weren't here last week

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
I was in Anaheim

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Sort of at Blizzcon

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Meaning I didn't go to actual Blizzcon

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I just went to all the parties and then I went to Disneyland

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Which is right next door

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
That was the way to do it

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
I had a great time

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
I met a lot of awesome people

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I'll talk more about Blizzcon later in the show

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
When we get to some of that news

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
One of the cliffhangers we left last week

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Or excuse me, two weeks ago

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Was that we were talking about the end

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Of the last generation with PlayStation 3

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
And so forth

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
And the start of the new one

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
And I mentioned that I was waffling on the PlayStation 4

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
And I wasn't sure if I was going to get one

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
And I had my pre-order through Amazon

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Was I going to keep it, was I going to cancel it

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Wii U, you might remember a year ago

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I never bothered pre-ordering a Wii U

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
I said I'm not going to get it

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
The day the Wii U comes out, what did I do?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
I got one at Target

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
So what happened with the PlayStation 4?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
I did not buy the PlayStation 4

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
I cancelled my pre-order

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
When I got back from Disneyland

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
You were a wise, wise fellow

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Well, here's the thing

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
A part of me actually feels kind of bad

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Because at Disney

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
I had a great time at Disney

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Alan and I had a great time on Friday

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
And the park wasn't very crowded

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
But then Saturday, randomly

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
An old friend of mine

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
A few years ago

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Who actually works for Sony now

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Was hanging out with me at the park

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
And we were talking, of course we have to talk

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
I don't want to bug him with work

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
But we have to talk a little bit about PlayStation 4

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
And he was telling me all the good stuff

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
And I was leaving Saturday feeling really jazzed

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
About PlayStation 4, like, okay

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
I gotta get one when I get home, I gotta get one when I get home

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
But then I'll tell you what

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Swamee was that drive home Sunday

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
And I don't know what it was

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
I don't know if it was kind of listening to Bobby's show

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
You know, it's

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
A video game system is only as good as the games that are on it

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Or what have you

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
But I really realized, guys

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
There's just nothing I really, really want to get

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
On PlayStation 4 right now

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Now, early next year

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Absolutely

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Diablo 3 on PlayStation 4 looks great

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Even though I already played it on PC

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
I enjoy the controls on PlayStation 3's demo

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
And I will give the game another try on PlayStation 4

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Absolutely

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Final Fantasy 14 will be in beta

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
In the PlayStation 4

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
And then

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I do want to get the Need for Speed game at some point

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
But next year, some other things to look forward to

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Infamous Second Son, obviously

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
And Destiny

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
I mean, that's all in the first half next year

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
So I'm sure between now and then

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
I will end up buying a PlayStation 4

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
But I'm gonna be perfectly honest with you guys

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Despite all this, like, console wars

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
And whether you're cheering me or booing me

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
For my decision

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Money played a big part of it, too

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Might have gone over budget a little bit

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
When we were in Anaheim, so

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Whoops, womp, womp

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Going to the chat room

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
At live.vognetwork.com

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
RawstealUT says

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
So the Wii U is worth more at launch

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Than the PlayStation 4?

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I'm

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
This is not gonna be a popular answer

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Yes

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
And the reason why I say yes

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Is at least

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
On the Wii U

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
And you can call me fanboy all you want

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
I don't give a fuck

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
But on the Wii U at least, there was the Mario Brothers

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Which I really wanted to play, the Super Mario Brothers Wii U

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
And there was Zombie U

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
And yeah, I wanted to play Nintendo Land, too

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
I mean, that was three games

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
At launch that I said, I really want to play these games

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
I couldn't do that with PlayStation 4

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
I couldn't sit there and go

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
These are four games I have to play

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Right now

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
I couldn't do that

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
And honestly, we all know that Wii U lost a lot of steam

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Over its first year release

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
And I'm not gonna try and defend that

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
You know, there should have been more in the pipeline

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Or what have you

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
I think that's where PlayStation 4 will outpace Wii U

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Is because I'm looking at the first half of next year

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Going, this looks very exciting

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
For PlayStation 4

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
With all those games I just named

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
So in that regard

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Which I would argue

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Is more crucial

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
To the system

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
In the future than the launch

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
The next six months look very good for PlayStation 4

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
So

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Let's see, also going to the chat room

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
I didn't get one either

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Yeah, neither did Loki

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
You guys had already kind of locked that in a couple weeks ago

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
But I know I was waffling

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
It just has to do with the bullshit of system launches

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
The way they go these days

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
If there aren't the games that are gonna be out

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Let me rephrase that

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Because I can't apparently speak proper English today

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
If the games that I want to play

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Are not out when the system launches

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Then buying the system is buying a giant paperweight

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
I would rather wait

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Till the issues get worked out

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
I would rather wait until there's a library that's worth me

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Actually putting some money on

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
And my $100 gift card will last me a while

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Yeah

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
I am still planning on

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
And this again

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Probably won't be a popular statement

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
But I don't care

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
I am still planning on getting that Zelda 3DS I want

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
And Mario 3D World next week

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
You know when Fire Emblem's out?

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
It didn't Fire Emblem already

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
It did?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Yeah, it came out a while ago

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Unless there's a new one I'm not aware of

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
But that's

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Yes, I am still planning on keeping that

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
But the good news is I can actually sell my old 3DS

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
To recoup some of the money

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
That's what I plan on doing

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Yep, yep

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Let's see

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
RawsteelUT says

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
There's never been a system that had a five star launch lineup

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
I'm really trying to think that through

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Oh, the Xbox 360 I thought had a pretty great launch

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
360 wasn't bad

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
360 wasn't bad at all

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Dreamcast had good games when it came out

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Dreamcast was decent, yeah

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Sonic Adventure by itself

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Was a great game

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
I remember

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Super Nintendo was really weak

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
But it had Mario World

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Nobody cared there's Mario World

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
There's another one I'm trying to think through

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Genesis launch was really crappy as far as games go

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Because it was just the standard Sega fare

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
There was no Sonic

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Was it like an Alex Kidd game?

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Yeah

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Altered Beast I'm pretty sure was the launch title

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
columns

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Alan's here

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
I was trying to think pop quiz wise

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
There were five or six launch week Super Nintendo games

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
It was SimCity, Pilotwings

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Super Mario World

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I want to say Final Fantasy 2

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
But no that came out a couple months later

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
It was Launch Window

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Within like six months of it

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
There were just like the four or five

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
There was also the Super Scope games

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
No, Super Scope games way later

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Actually, Alan, I think those ones you named

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
I don't remember

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Was F-Zero at launch?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
But I think the ones you named

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
I think first party were the only ones

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
There was Pilotwings

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
The Nintendo

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
The Green Hair Professor port

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Of SimCity

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
And Mario World

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Those were the big three from Nintendo

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
I thought that first week there were five

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I'm trying to think of what the other two were

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Someone Wikipedia it in chat

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Now I'm trying to

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
I'm getting asked some questions about the Xbox One

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
And where my head's at with that

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
I'm going to be honest guys

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
I kind of counted that out a while ago

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Because the $100 price tag gets a little more up there

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
And the launch games to me

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Didn't counter balance that

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Yes, I know it's getting Killer Instinct

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
But I'm kind of eh on that

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
I think the launch games sound a little bit better

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Four to five sounds pretty awesome

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
And Dead Rising 3

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
It's just like the whole series

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Dead Rising, I bought it

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
I have fun with it for about

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
A week and then I get bored with it

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Really fast

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
The same thing happened

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
I got Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising 2 off the record

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
And I got bored with it so fast

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
You'd think that would be impossible

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Being that it's a sandbox zombie game

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
But Dead Rising 3 I think I'd just get bored with

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Really fast

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Just so you know Alan, looking at chat

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Bobby Blackwolf went and looked it up for you

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Super Nintendo launch titles were indeed

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Mario World F-Zero was a launch title

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Pilotwings, SimCity, Gradius 3

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Was the only other one that was there the day it launched

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Yeah, that was the one you were missing

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
So yeah, here's the thing

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I actually kind of agree that I think

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
The Xbox One lineup and those things you just said

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Forza, The Crimson Dragon, not so much Rise

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
In fact, very much not so much Rise

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Yeah, Rise is kind of...

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
But a lot of those other games you're talking about

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Actually, I think the Xbox lineup out the gate

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Sounds a little stronger than Playstation 4

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
But do I want to pay another $100 for the privilege

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Of playing those games?

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Is it that much a must-have title?

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Not for me, and not the stuff I play

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
So

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
I still think it's weird seeing

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
I saw a TV commercial again today

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
They had some football on at Chili's

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
And it was talking about

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
How to watch TV with the Xbox One

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
And how that's a selling feature

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
I'm like, I just don't get

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
I guess if you're really hardcore into

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Fancy football, cool

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
But other than that, why the hell

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Would you purchase that system to watch

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
TV on it? It just doesn't seem like

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
That makes sense

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
I will say this now

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Now that it's been a week

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Do I regret my decision to not get a

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Playstation 4?

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
It's

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
It is really

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Taking a lot of willpower

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
To make me not go

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Isn't there something we could sell to get the money

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Don't we have hidden money somewhere

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
That I could dig up and help pay for the

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Playstation 4? Do I have a rewards card

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Or an unspent gift certificate?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Watching other people

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
On their Twitch streams

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
I've been watching Exeter was streaming

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Some stuff, and that was fun, and Bobby was streaming

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Some stuff, and it was neat to watch

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
It kind of made me go, oh

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
That's right, I could have played like DC Universe

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Online with all the new textures would have been really cool

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
And flowers really pretty

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
And all that

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
And the Twitch stuff looks great

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
So there is that whole like, I want to be in the cool kids club

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Type of thing going on

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
But I'm doing alright

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
I'm pretty sure I'm going to make it till

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
2014 without breaking down

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
And buying a Playstation 4

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
We'll see

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Alright, so yeah, that's it

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
No Playstation 4 for me

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
For now, but I am still going to

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Of course be following it as are we all

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
And doing the news and all that

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
And I'll get one eventually

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Just so you know guys

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Just to kind of put it in perspective

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
I did not buy an Xbox 360

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
At launch either, nor did I buy a

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Playstation 3 at launch

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
I actually bought the Xbox 360 first

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I bought that about 4 months after it launched

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
They were still really hard to find

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
When I bought it, like I had to

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
And when they got the new

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Shipments, and I remember I had to get

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
The not fancy 360

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
And had to buy the extra stuff

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Separately

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Excuse me, they were still hard to come by

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
And my Xbox 360 died within a week

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Of me buying it, and that pissed me off

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
But whatever, it's old news now

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Playstation 3 I didn't buy

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
For like a year, I didn't buy Playstation 3

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Until LittleBigPlanet I think had been announced

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Or came out or something

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Was when I finally got the Playstation 3

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
So, just because I don't buy a console at launch

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Doesn't mean I won't love the system eventually

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Like I said before, if Killzone

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Wasn't Killzone, if it was a new

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Resistance game, next gen

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
I would buy that

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Because, well, I would want that game

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
But

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
I just, I don't like Killzone

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
I really don't like Killzone

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
And looking at like, you know, what the next gen

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Games, I guess, you know, like Call of Duty

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
And Battlefield and stuff, I mean, Call of Duty

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Just, first off, Call of Duty I'm not excited about

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
At all

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
I had actually gotten a copy and I'm like

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Fuck this, I'm not opening this, I'm selling it

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
And so I did

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
But I still have another copy

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
But, you know, it's just

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I haven't even bothered to want to play that

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
And, you know, it just didn't look that

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Great on

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
It just doesn't show off

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
The power of that system at all

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
It just kind of, you know, okay

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
This looks like a Playstation 3 game

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
I don't know

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Alright, well, let's see

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
What else should I talk about here? I want to get into our gaming weeks

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
But I should mention BlizzCon real quick

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
I did talk a little more in depth about this

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Over on Horde House, my other show, which is on Wednesdays

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
With Xtavor, Shana Linko

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
And Grandpa Matt

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
That is on Wednesdays

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
And the latest episode, which is called

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Outworld is Mortal Combat

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
The name of it, long story

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
You'll figure it out when you listen

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
I talked a little more about BlizzCon, but I just want to reiterate

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
I did have a good time at the parties

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I met all the people

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
There was this fun little event called World of Podcasts

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
They did Thursday night where they tried to get all the podcasters

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Together to kind of like do these panels and things

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
And that was neat for networking

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
And just getting to meet different people

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
So yeah, I had a good time at the event

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
And, you know, you definitely feel that buzz

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
In the air, all the excitement for the new products

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
You know, obviously

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
A big Warcraft expansion was announced

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
We'll get into some of the details a little later on when we get to the news

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
But there was a lot of buzz about that

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
And the many other things that they announced

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
But, you know, remember guys

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
BlizzCon costs $175 to go to

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
And I just, I got to be honest

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I think the way I did it was great

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Where we went to Disneyland

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
And I got to go to the parties, so I got to do all the networking

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Yeah, I didn't get to play the new stuff

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
But that's okay

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I'll play it eventually, it'll come out

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
$175, hmm

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
I don't know about that

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Alright, let's get into our gaming weeks

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
What types of video games have we been playing this week

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
On the consoles we do own?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
I'm actually defending RossTLUT

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Give me a second

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Oh, chat stuff going on right now

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
At live.hugnetwork.com

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
If he wants attention, then don't give attention

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Let me, go ahead

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
No, my point is that he left the room

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
He's not there to defend himself

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
I don't see any point in talking about him behind his back

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
The end

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Let's get into our gaming weeks

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Um, my gaming week

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Was nice

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
I

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
I actually

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Have twice finished the Stanley Parable

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Sorry, I didn't mean to kick you

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Then I'll kick you harder

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
I finished the Stanley Parable

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Which you play it through once the way you're told to play it

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
And then you do different things that keep you

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
From actually finishing the game

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
So it's a very interesting kind of twist

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
On the walk through

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
First person adventure

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
I really like it

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
It was very well done

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
I don't know that it was worth the full charge price

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Of it, but it was definitely worth the sale price

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
It was a very good game

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
And I haven't finished exploring it

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
It's pretty neat

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
I hear the game has a funny sense of humor

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
It does, it has a really funny sense of humor

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Compared to GLaDOS from Portal a lot

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Yeah, the narrator is just Mr. Snark

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
As long as you don't do

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
What Mr. Narrator says

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
So you can rebel against the narrator

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
It's encouraged

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
That you do so from time to time

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
I also

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Have been playing

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Mass Effect 2

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
And Mass Effect 3

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Because I have

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
I'm actually trying once again to get textures

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Imported on my Mass Effect 3

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
By doing mods myself from scratch

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Using textures and meshes that other people

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Have made and I've got

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Meshes working just fine

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Not textures and I do not want to use text mod

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Because that means it would be a pain in the ass

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
So, moving on from that

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I also played Final Fantasy 14

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
And I'm taking my sweet time with it

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
But I finally got Thaumaturge leveled up

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Once someone reminded me

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
That I could actually

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Pick some of my Arcana stability

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
And use them with my Thaumaturge

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
The class became less shitty

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
I'm sorry, physic is like

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Thaumaturges are like

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Squish, squish, squish, squish

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
No mana, squish, squish

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
And then I was like

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Oh yeah, physic

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Being able to heal yourself is a great little perk

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
But now I'm back to

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Arcanist and I'm going to

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Work up to 34 and then do that stupid quest again

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
That one that I'm trying to finish

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
So I'm just wandering around doing fates

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Right now anyway, so

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Kind of boring, but...

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Are you excited about the content patch coming in December?

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Yeah, I did enjoy the lightning

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Thing

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
I got the quest

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
And I actually hung out

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Basically you just find

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Where all the people are camping and that's where lightning

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Is going to show up eventually

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
In one of the little random

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Fates that pop up in that area

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
So I actually got the lightning

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Thing, her showing there and being all kind of

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Broody to herself and

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Is this my fate?

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
I'm lightning angst

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
I just liked how all the fonts turned to Final Fantasy

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
13 and the music

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
I gotta be honest

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
I sat there waiting for the fate to pop

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
And I was like, this is so boring I didn't even

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
See it through

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I was like, fuck this I'll do it later

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
I was a little bit late because I was trying to get a good

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
View to screen capper

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
You know because

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
They turned it off, regular screen caps

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
But I use steam for it

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
So I was going to turn off all my stuff in screen capper

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
But I didn't get it done

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
I did like though that you can get

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Some of the outfits and armor

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
And that's what I'm kind of working on right now

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Because I like pretty stuff

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I've been playing Animal Crossing

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
I am going to be probably playing

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Animal Crossing because I have one

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Lone left

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
For my second character

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
And then there's Julian's but I'm using his as bribery

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
So that he actually behaves in

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
He's a good boy but he doesn't listen

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Another one of your animals moved to my village

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Really?

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Agnes I think it was?

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Oh the pig? Yeah

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
I know Portia just moved too so I don't know who she moved to

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
I don't think she came to mine, I got Agnes

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
I got Mitzi finally

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
The white cat with the blue face

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
That was on the cover of the first game

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
I have Mitzi now

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
And I like her better than Ed

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
And I want Ed to leave because he's fucking creepy

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
It's like they're real people

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
I was actually

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I started listening

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
To the Night Vale podcast

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Which is fun

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
But I was thinking about doing an Animal Crossing

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Parody with Night Vale type

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Stuff that's called Welcome to Normandy

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Or something

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
A particular person at VOG has

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Openly voiced the fact that they would love to have

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Some type of fiction based podcast

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Thing here, it would be a lot of fun

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Well you know I've

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
I've been working on stories already so

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Make it happen

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Make it work

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
I actually have a very extreme story I'm already working on

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
For a webcomic but it would tie in very nicely with the podcast

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Talk to me, talk to me person

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Alright

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Crap I played other shit

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
But I don't remember what the fuck it was

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
It's kind of hard though I've noticed

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
To play MMOs

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
When you have a very needy cat

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Midna has now taken

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
To climbing up my side

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
And patting me on the shoulder when she wants me to play with her

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Not just you know

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
The climbing up part

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
But she pats me on the shoulder and waits till I look at her

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
And then she goes

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
And then she hops up in my lap

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
And tries to eat my mouse so whatever

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Not an actual mouse

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Like your computer mouse

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Cat and mouse

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
You know what's stupid about my mouse by the way

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Because Microsoft doesn't make that thumb track ball anymore

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
People on Amazon sell them for 200 bucks

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
And I own two of them

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
They don't make thumb track balls anymore?

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Not the wired Microsoft thumb track ball

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Oh like different brands

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Logitech makes one like it

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
But people are actually spending the 200 bucks

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
And it makes me think maybe I should sell one of mine

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
But then again I wouldn't be able to get another

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Loki how was your gaming week?

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
I played a lot of Grand Theft Auto

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Of course you did

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
So I played more of online

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
I think I'm like level 28 now

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
On PS3

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
I didn't play any online on 360

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
But I did 100% 360

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
So I'm all done with that

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
And actually I'm kind of

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
I was trying to black out everything on 360

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
As far as the 100% checklist

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Because there's more stuff you can do

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Than actually get 100% for

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Doesn't make any sense but

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
That's the way they have it

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
So what did I do?

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
I did all the

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Epsilon tracks the other day

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
And

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
I don't know just messing around

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
I'll probably play more online

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Because they're gonna have a content patch

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Coming out

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
This week

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
And

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Then

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Then I played Cookie Clicker

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
I started that last night

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
It's only been a few hours

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
I can hear you over there clicking while you're talking by the way

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Of course

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
You got an intervention

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
It'll be over soon don't worry

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
There is an end

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Alright

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
How many cookies do you have right now?

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Well I'm producing

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Looks like just under

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
30 million per second

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
It's not enough

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Alright anything else?

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Um

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
No that's it

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Alright my gaming wheel

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Real quick actually

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
A little bit of Forza Horizon but I wasn't actually playing it

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
My son was playing it

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
I saw the stuff on Facebook

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
With the pictures and everything

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Yeah he likes playing with my Microsoft

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Racing wheel

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
He likes pretending it's a steering wheel

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
And goes and plays around that

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
So I'm like hey what about the

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Then he wants to sit in my car and stuff

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
And tell him how the car works

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
And I'm like yeah you push the pedals to go

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
And stuff and well I'll tell you what I can set up

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
A game for you and you can go drive a car in that

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
And so

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
He had trouble at first because I had the

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Force feedback on and stuff

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
It's hella hard to drive that stupid steering wheel

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
With the force feedback on so I turned it all off

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
And then I finally

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Switched him into a Honda Fit

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Because the car I picked for him

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Because it was a class C car

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Just was all over the road but for some reason

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
The Fit doesn't

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
It's more stable I guess or something

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
And so he

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
He was doing alright

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
He got it up to like 35

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
And he was staying on the road

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
But there was like a turn

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
It was like an S turn and he was able to stay on the road

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
So it was pretty cool

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Let's see look at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Dark Tetsuya saw the video

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
And said that was a great video Loki

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Ciao wants to know

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Sorry I always mispronounce your name

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Says what's the subscription fee

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
For the Final Fantasy MMO

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
I believe it's $12.95 a month for the basic

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Which gives you 1 character a server

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Think $14.95 for the advanced

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Which is 8 characters a server

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
I only had 1 plan

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
And that was the $14.99 plan

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Go take a look

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Because I think there's a $12.95 plan

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
I didn't see any of it but I don't care

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Because I wanted all the stuff and whatever

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
It's what I was paying for a while anyway so it's fine

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
It's not that big a difference

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Anything else Loki? Or do I get to go?

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Alright my gaming week

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Honestly not a whole lot of

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Different stuff because I was out of town for a few days

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
But you know the typical Final Fantasy 14

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
I'm addicted to that

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
And also played some World of Warcraft

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
I think the whole BlizzCon thing might have energized

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Me a little bit to at least log in and check out my character

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
And go yep still

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Still got no friends left playing this game that's too bad

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
But I did play

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Some actual new stuff

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
I did play a little more of the Midway Arcade

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Because I was trophy hunting in that game

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
And I talked about that a couple weeks ago on the show

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
But another game I played

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
On Playstation 3, you ready for this?

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
While all you guys were busy with your

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Newfangled Playstation 4's

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Playing one of the big launch titles, Assassin's Creed 4

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
I played Assassin's Creed 3

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
On Playstation 3

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Which by the way is my first

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Assassin's Creed game I've ever played

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
To which everybody is telling me

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
You're doing it wrong!

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
I want two, I actually have two for PC

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Do you?

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
But I hated playing it without a controller

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
I like

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
I've been playing Assassin's Creed 3

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
I like it well enough

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
I've only gotten through that first little chapter

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Where you're in the Opera House, then the boat and everything

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
I liked the way that it was telling

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
A story and I thought the environments were really

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Kind of neat, like I really liked that

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Opera House was really pretty

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
To be scaling all around and jumping all around

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
So I was kind of having fun with that

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
But did you fight Ultros?

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
No, I did not fight Ultros

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
But I did

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
I did have to walk in the

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Rafters and all that stuff

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
The way the sequence was done was really

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Neat, like you would hop over to this stage

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Piece that would fall because of your weight

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
But not all the way onto the stage

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Yeah, I was

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Having fun with it

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
I want to play a little more of it

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
I probably will, I didn't get to play a lot a lot this week

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
But I played enough to get through that first

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Chapter, it was exciting enough

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Considering it was a series

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
I never really, I've had a lot of people

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Tell me like, Rob, you should play Assassin's Creed

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Why don't you talk about Assassin's Creed on your show?

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Why aren't you playing this game?

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
I tried Assassin's Creed 1, nah

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
It was just kind of not for me

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
I just wanted to play 2

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Simply because it was Renaissance Italy

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
And you get to kill

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Dometicis and that's always fun

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Because when they weren't busy

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Being Pope or killing each other off

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
They're a very interesting family

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
But yeah, all those same people telling me to play Assassin's Creed

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
I'm sure when they hear I started with a third game

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
They're gonna be like, what are you doing?

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Don't do that one

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
But too late, and I'm enjoying it well enough

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
So, hey, the good news is if 3

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Is like the worst one, then

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
That gives me incentive to go play 1 and 2 again

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
I don't think 3 was the worst one

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
It sold way better than 4 did

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Well, wait a minute though

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
4's only been out, what, since Friday?

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
I'm talking the first 4 days

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Oh wait, that's right, 4 was out on the other consoles

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Well, but could that be because

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Of the spread where some people are waiting for

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and all that?

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
It's funny because actually for work

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
I was doing some comparisons

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Between launch

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Basically from that Tuesday to

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
The Saturday launch

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Week

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Versus their previous

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Iterations and stuff

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Just a little bit

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Of a spoiler here

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Call of Duty and Ghost did not sell

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Every 1 billion copies, they sold

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Into retail 1 billion copies

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
They sold through maybe about

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
177 million dollars

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Worth of that, not 1 billion dollars

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
And then

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Assassin's Creed 4

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
I don't remember what it was, but it was about

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
It was less than half

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Of Assassin's Creed 3

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Assassin's Creed 3 sold really well

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
My idea with that is because they changed

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Up the locale and it was a little bit of a different

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Type of game, so it was a lot more interesting

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Warriors 4 is very similar

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
To Assassin's Creed 3 except now it's

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Pirates and there's more of the ship

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Stuff in there, but

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
I don't know, no one cares about

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Call of Duty for some reason this year

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Looking at our chatroom at

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Live.vognetwork.com, Tim Tripp

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Says, I'm loving Assassin's Creed 4

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Sexy pirate adventure time

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Assassin's Creed 3, the part

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
I played, didn't have pirates, but it had a little bit

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Of the boat

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
I don't know if you've been

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Marking yourself for download for all those free

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Xbox games

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Right? No, I don't think I have

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
They had Assassin's Creed 2 on there

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Did they? Yeah

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Stupid me

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Other comments on Assassin's Creed

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
DKB says I couldn't get through the first one

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
But the rest were great

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Let's see

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Burr says the Assassin's Creed 2 trilogy is good

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Or you could go right into Assassin's Creed 4

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
And

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Let's see

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Well they had it out on PS3

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
And now it's out on 360 as well

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Gene in our chatroom at Live.vognetwork.com says

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Maybe the second one, it's cheap

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Easily sets up how to play

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
So here you go

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Some comments and suggestions from our chatroom at Live.vognetwork.com

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
That's pretty much it for my gaming week

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
I have some other Playstation Network things to get into

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
But I didn't play them enough

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
So I'll get into them a little later on next week

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
So let's

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Move into gaming news

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
But first we'll do some housekeeping

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
So I should say one other thing

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
And this kind of goes to housekeeping too

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Cheat plug time, you ready? Ready for cheat plug?

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Yay

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
So one other game I played this week

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Was the retro-tastic Jumpman Jr.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
On Commodore 64

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Which is one of my earliest gaming memories

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
And I played it because I'm toying around with this new project

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
For my YouTube channel

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
So if you want to see me playing

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
A good 20-25 minutes of Jumpman Jr.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Go check out my YouTube channel

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
My username over there is RobRobertsPlays

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
All one word

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
You will get my YouTube page to come right up

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Because I have some other newer stuff

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Like I did some streaming and typing in the dead

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
That old Slenderman video from a few months ago

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
That's all there

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
But you can check out my Let's Remember series with Jumpman Jr.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
First video is up

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
I started to do a second video tonight

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
But I couldn't use it because

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Get this, I was trying to do

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
I don't want to say the game because I'll probably end up doing it later

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
But it was an Atari 2600 game, I'll say that much

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
And when I was recording

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Because the old Atari 2600 games

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
When there was too much on the screen

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
It would have the flicker

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
So when it was recorded

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
It recorded at just the right frames a second

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
That when I was doing one part of the game

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
My character just disappears in the video

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
So you can't even see it

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Because of the flicker

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
I'm starting to learn about all that fun stuff

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
But the Jumpman Jr. one looks great

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
So check that out over at YouTube

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
And I will be adding more videos to it

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
I had a really nice response to that first video

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
There are classic games

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Both mainstream stuff and neglected stuff

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
I'm kind of starting with a bunch of games

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
That don't get talked enough about

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
But I have a shit ton of Commodore 64 stuff

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
I want to play

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
And even older stuff, Atari 2600 and so on

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Alright

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Let's get into some other housekeeping

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Is where you can follow the show

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
And we're also on Facebook

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
We crossed 600 likes this week

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Thank you guys very much

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Nice little milestone on Facebook

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
But we could use more

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
So please give us your likes over on Facebook

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
You can also listen to this program

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Not just via iTunes

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
And the app store and all that

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
But we are also available on streaming sites

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
So just tune in and Stitcher Radio

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
And that's an opportunity for me to say

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
That Stitcher Radio does have reviews now

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
And those really help with exposure

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
They do have a direct impact on that

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
So please, if you enjoy the show

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
We really, really appreciate it

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Alright, let's get into

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Some gaming news now

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
It's been a very busy week with the launch of a system

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
And everything, right Loki?

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Yeah, so

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
As with any console launching

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
There's sometimes hiccups with things

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
One of which is people encountering

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
The blinking blue light

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Which is a

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Error indicator

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
It can mean a bunch of different things

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Including

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
An issue with TV compatibility

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
An issue with the power supply

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
The hard drive, or something else

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
So

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Yeah, and they kind of

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Go through some of the things to try

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Of course, you know

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Turn it off, turn it back on

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Number one thing that you do with anything

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
That's mechanical

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Is reboot

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Of course, there's

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
One of the things I know that people

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Are mentioning is sometimes there's an issue

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Where the HDMI port that they have on there

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
That part of the metal shielding

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
On there is popped up

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
And you have to push it down because your

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
HDMI cable might not go all the way

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Into the port and make a bad connection

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Then that

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
You know, causes that wonderful light

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
To pop up as well

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Or, your hard drive might not be seated properly

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
And you need to go pop that out

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
And maybe put it back in

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
And see if that works

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
So they have a lot of stuff

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Obviously through Sony's support site

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
You can check it out

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
If you have a problem

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Or just fucking complain and say

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Hey, my shit's not working, I just bought this system

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
What the fuck

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
And they'll send you a coffin to

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Send your system back and fix it

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
But don't do what everybody else does

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Which is just write an angry post on the internet

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Because that's not really going to fix anything

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
No

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
So what do you think? I don't know

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Is it doom and gloom for Sony?

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
No, because they were saying

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
That it's a lot of these issues

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
So far that they've charted

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
As far as people calling it

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
It's only been about

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
You know, was it

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
0.04%

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Or something like that

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Of the systems that are out there

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
So that's about like

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
I think we're going to get the numbers later on

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
But it's only a few thousand systems out of

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
About a million systems launched

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
So

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Yeah, obviously

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Those people are very vocal

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
So it's making it sound like a larger issue

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
But until

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
It becomes a larger issue

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Like the Xbox 360 launch

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
That's actually well within

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Usual

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Hardware tolerances

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Here's the thing though

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
Just to play devil's advocate a little bit

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Didn't the 360 and Microsoft and all that

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Grossly understate the amount of 360

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Consoles that were having problems

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Because I think they said what

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
I don't know, the number was really low

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
And then at one point they said it was 30%

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Like they went as high as it was

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
But just the people I know

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
It's more like 75%

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Of those things had problems

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
For real

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Considering how many consoles I went through

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
On the Xbox 360 and how

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
My Playstation systems

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
1, 2, and 3

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
Not a problem at all

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
I actually took apart my Playstation 3

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
A couple weeks ago

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
When I thought

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Oh it's pretty hot

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
I'm sure there's a ton of fucking cat hair

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
In there

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Surprisingly there's no cat hair in there

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
How the fuck did that happen?

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
My computer is full of cat hair

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
But that system for some reason

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Nothing

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
I don't know what they did to it

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
It's a magic cat hair repellent

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
I've never had a problem with any of the

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Microsoft would be the one I'd be very wary about

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Because like I said I went through about 12 systems

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
With them so

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Yeah I'm a little bit more skeptical

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
With Microsoft hardware

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
But

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
It's not to say that it's

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Not possible that there is

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
A widespread thing but

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
So far it doesn't seem to be that

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
With the Xbox 360 at launch

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Everybody was being affected by it

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
You knew someone that had

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Something go wrong with their system

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
It's very obvious

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
But we'll see

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Once they just went through

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
And sold a ton of systems

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
We'll see if we start hearing more about this

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
If it's going to be a widespread thing

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
But I don't think it is

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
At the moment

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Yet another reason I avoid launch

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Well you know what though

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
I bought my 360 like 4 months after launch

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
And it still wasn't fixed

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
So I worry that if there is a problem

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
It's not going to get fixed overnight

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Go into our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
ShadowNextGen says Loki was

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
One of the lucky ones not to have a Playstation 1

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Or Playstation 2 without problems

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Very nice I have a launch 20 gig PS3

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
And it works just fine

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
I'm just hoping that it doesn't crap out someday

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Because that would suck I've never had a problem

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
With any of my systems except the 360

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
My Playstation 1

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
And Japanese Playstation 2 and American

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
One were fine Well my

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
JPS2 is a launch one too

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
And it's been working just fine perfectly

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
And my PS3 was a launch PS3

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
And it's zero problems

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
You know how apt those were

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
To having issues

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
But we did

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
One of our Xboxes red ringed

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
But we haven't had the problem since

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
And they were still making them under those same specs

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
So

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
I think they've learned their lesson a lot

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Especially with the red ring thing

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Was the whole overheating of those chips

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
And technology has gotten so much better

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
In the years now that they're not using

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
30 nanometer chips anymore

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
They're using 20, 30 nanometer chips

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
That are way cooler, way more

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Energy efficient

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
So running into

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Heating problems nowadays isn't

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
As much of an issue anymore

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Because technology has improved

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
So much in the years

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
I think unless

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Of course you're shoving your system

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Into a closed look area

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
The red light of doom was one of the ones

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
That people were saying on the

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
PlayStation 4, that's from overheating

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
But

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
I just don't think right now we haven't heard enough

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
To where

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
I think it's widespread yet

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
We'll see, I mean if we hear that there's a ton of people being affected

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
By it or if it's something that

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
It's fine now

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
But like you know

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Two weeks down the road all of a sudden everyone's systems start dying

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Then that's something different

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Alright well

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Moving on to more talk about

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
PlayStation 4

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
When they released that giant FAQ on Sony's side

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
A few weeks ago

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Some people were very upset to hear that there was not going to be

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Any type of playback in the games

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
And that the PlayStation 4 for some weird reason

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Won't even play CDs

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
I guess CDs are a dying thing

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Which is ironic because this is Sony

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Like didn't Sony start the CD player stuff?

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Like it's kind of weird

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
That their own device wouldn't even play CDs

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
But whatever

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Anyhow

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
So Sony is hearing the

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Loud vocal internet people

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
That are bitching a lot about the MP3s

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Being missing in the CDs and so forth

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
It was in the form of a response

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
From the president of Sony Worldwide Studios

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Shuhei Yoshida

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Who said the biggest surprise for us

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
All internally at Sony was that there are so many

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
People who passionately reacted

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
To our announcements that there's no MP3

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Support or CD support on day one

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
It's not like we actively decided

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Let's not do this feature so people

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Will have to subscribe to Music Unlimited

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Except that's the way I saw it

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
It's interesting that

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
He fires that direct shot

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
There's a lot of people saying that

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Whether you want

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
I'm just saying believe him or not

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
But he did come out and say we did not

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Do it because of this

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Let me finish the quote

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
The focus has been more on the game features

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Some of the features we wanted

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
But couldn't get in on day one

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
I would like to explain why he did put it out

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
If they said

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
You guys could have had CD MP3 playback

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
But then we wouldn't have had game streaming

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Or something like that

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
It just sounds

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Odd

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
That they would just omit this stuff

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Yet

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Hey that Music Unlimited service works just fine

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
It's just a little odd

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Is it working though?

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Have any of the PlayStation 4 adopters

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Signed up for Music Unlimited just because

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
They had to hear their Lady Gaga

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
While they're playing?

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
There's a lot of detail in there

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
With all the launch systems

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
One of the things I did like

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Just kind of reminded me based off that picture

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Is

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
One of the things I don't even know if they've really been talking about

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Those controllers have a headphone out on them

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
For game audio

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Like actual game audio from

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Your TV

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Before

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
About a month ago or so

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
I didn't have a wireless headset for my PlayStation 3

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
I just had headphones

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
And that would work fantastic

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Just being able to

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Have that audio without having to bug anybody

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
But I thought that was kind of a neat feature

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
That I wish all consoles had

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
It's neat to see that on there

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
But yeah it would be cool

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
If I could play MP3's back

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Or put MP4's

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
On a jump drive or something

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
And watch them on my system like I can

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
On my PlayStation 3

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
It's kind of dumb that they don't have that

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
But hey if it's something that

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
They can get this out on time

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
And so they just focus on game related features

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Now and then they're going to add that all in

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Quarter one next year or something

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Ok I'm fine with that

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Yeah he did go on to say

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
As we speak the people in Japan

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
The system guys are discussing

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
When we can put these features in

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Ok well then it sounds like that's what it is

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
But you know

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
It is a little

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Perplexing that oh hey Music Unlimited

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Works

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
You know we couldn't

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Possibly squeeze out

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
The one programmer

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
That's going to take to implement MP3

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Playback on

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
I mean come on how fucking hard is it

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Going to be to implement MP3 Playback

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
On a goddamn PS4

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
I don't think it's going to be that hard to write

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
An MP3 Playback

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
App

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
It just doesn't seem like it would be that difficult

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
I don't know

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Alright by the way some folks in chat

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
ActDef says

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Philips did the CD but Sony jumped on the CD quickly too

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Rama says it was a joint venture

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Between Philips and Sony

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
I do remember that Philips was heavily involved

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
And Philips had the CDI back in the day

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
So they got into gaming at one point

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
You remember that Sony worked on the

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Super Nintendo's processor and I believe was supposed to make

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
A CD unit

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
And then like no let's do our own thing

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
I think it was Nintendo didn't want to do it

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Something to that effect

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
But at any rate Sony took what they

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Had from having worked with Nintendo

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
And jumped on their own little

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Bit of the wagon

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Gaming history y'all

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Alright well so you'll get

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
To have your or as

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
What is it sg100matt in chat says

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
If I can't listen to Kesha while I'm gaming

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Then that's a deal breaker

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
You'll get your

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
We are who we are

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Or whatever songs it is she does

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
You'll get those to play those songs

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
In Need for Speed or whatever soon enough

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Help because I like Kesha

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
I blame you for showing me that video

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Oh now the video

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
She did with James Van Der Beek

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
That was great

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
You know I checked out the directors other videos

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
And they are equally as brilliant

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
But I blame you

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
To register participation for this weeks episode of

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Use the pass phrase hate

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Let's move on

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Chakra you're next actually

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Well how about some wank

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Wank wank and more wank

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
God damn you blizzard

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
During the show it's gross

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Blizzard is a bunch of fuckers

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Why? Because they put out an expansion

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
I'm actually interested in

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Warlords of Draenor

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Blah blah blah level 90 blah blah blah

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
I mean actually level 100

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
But they're doing an instant level 90 now

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
With the expansion which I think is stupid

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
But I'll talk about that in a minute

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
So basically you get to go into the past

48:59.000 --> 49:03.000
And learn more stuff about the space goats

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
And explore the land of the space goats

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
And hang out with the space goats

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
And hopefully play more space goats

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Because that was my favorite race

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
I'm glad to hear the Draenei aren't getting

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Fucked over in this expansion

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Because in the last couple of expansions

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
They've just been absent

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Like straight up not a part of it

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Fuck your pandas

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Fuck all these other people

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
We're gonna go here and be Russian

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Or at least sound

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Like

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Eastern European accent

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
And honestly I actually

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
They're my favorite race

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
In the entire anything

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Having to do with Warcraft

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
My first character

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
When I actually decided to play

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Longer than level 20

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Was Erisa remember?

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
My arcane mage

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
And I had so much fun with it

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
I played through all of Cataclysm

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Without any help practically

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Except for just being in the guild

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
I didn't do dungeons, I didn't craft

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
I didn't discover crafting until like

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
I had already started raiding I think

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
So it was kind of funny

50:09.000 --> 50:13.000
But yeah they're boosting level cap to 100

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
And you can instantly upgrade

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
One character to level 90

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
So that you can start

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Playing the new content

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Which I would like to see

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
If there are other restrictions

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
On this just because keep in mind

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
People

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Part of the reason that you level

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Is to not just

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Gain the experience and the

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Abilities of your character in game

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
But so that you learn the mechanics

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Of your character in game

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
And by learning those mechanics

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
It makes you an overall

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Better rounded player

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
You know how you fit in

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Should you decide to do instances

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Which some are fun, some are not

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
You know but

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
And people will give you unwanted tips

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
On how to play your class

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Even when you don't give a shit

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Which assholes

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
We were talking a little bit about this on Horde House

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Just at that point

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
There's supposed to be some type of like

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Scenarios or something that help you

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Like if you're a brand new level one

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
That boosts to 90

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
You get some type of scenario

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
But that's still I don't think gonna be good enough

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
It's an interesting

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Band-aid

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
You know like even

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
I always kind of like approach that

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Because I don't play World of Warcraft

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
And I don't know too much about it

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
And this announcement just

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Nothing, I feel nothing

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Jumped out and saying hey that looks really cool

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
I just like kind of eh whatever

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
They didn't really do anything to attract

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
New players to be honest

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Which kind of sounds like a mistake to me

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
And this is the crappy thing because I really

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Want to play it for the lore

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
You know I really want to

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
See what the new stuff is

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
It's very interesting to me

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
But I just completely dropped

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
World of Warcraft for Final Fantasy

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
And I'm really enjoying Final Fantasy

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
I enjoy not having to rep grind

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
I don't care about doing all the what is it the

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Titan crap or

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
What's the other stuff that you guys have been doing

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
The primal fights basically

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
I can get those later

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
I haven't had this wild urge

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
To like massively level I've been

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Able to sit back and enjoy the game

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
And that's kind of what I dug about playing through Cataclysm

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
The first time but then when I got to all the

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Panda shit I was like it really

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Was literally steaming piles of panda shit

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
That's all it was

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Rep grinding, the rep grinding got worse

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
With the freaking pandas

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
And I hated the arena

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
And I hated the Pokemon battle

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
Because it was fine for like a week

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
And I got sick of it

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
But yeah along with this too there of course will be new

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Zones, dungeons, new raids, scenarios

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Battlegrounds

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
There's supposed to be improvements like a

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Reskinned character models

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
And new animation

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
But I hope that they never change the night elf

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Dance because that shit's funny

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
So you can watch the trailer online it's pretty

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
I

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
Part of me just does not want to give a shit

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
The other part of me is like

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Goats

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
You know I'm not super into

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
World war class lore I never have been

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Which is funny you know with the podcast and everything

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
But I was always more about the social aspect

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
And the garrison sounds really neat

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
The whole player cities

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Or whatever sound really neat

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Well it almost sounds like they're trying to give a nod back to

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
The original Warcraft games

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Because you pretty much had your

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Own towns and your defensible areas

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
You know when you did places

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
That's a good point

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
The other thing that's just really

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
I'm wondering

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
The updates I think

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
As far as characters and animation

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Are necessary

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
They are long overdue

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
And I realize they've been trying to cater to people

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
On older systems that might not be able to

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Keep up with it but at the same

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Time I think that keeping like

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
A window of about maybe

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Five years worth of

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Computer

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
What's the word I'm trying to think of

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Being friendly to older systems

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Is a safe bet rather than

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
How long has the game been out now like what

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Oh nine years almost

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
And they were still catering to people

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
From computers still on

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
I mean I was playing

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Whatever you had

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Installed on your

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Macbook

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
I was playing that stuff on your

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Macbook and it was still

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Just fine

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
So I mean

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
I don't know I really

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Really really really

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Want to see the new stuff

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
It's just I don't know if it's so

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Worth it to me I've been well you know I read

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
All the books that came out during

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Cataclysm I got all of those books

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
I love the freaking thrall book I didn't read the Jaina

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Book though because I'm just pissed off about what they did to her

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
I mean I hate how her

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Character has become she used to be like one of my favorites

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Even though I made fun of her

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
But because I do have a character named

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Jaina

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Who I made look like her

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
But other than that

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
I can

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Get the lore stuff from my friends or I can

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Get it on YouTube I watched the whole ending

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Of the Garrosh bullshit

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
On YouTube

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Yeah oh there's two versions right? I've watched both of them

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
No I'm

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Mildly surprised but not

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Majorly I just like Jaina shut up

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Your trauma's showing

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Granted

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
It's well earned trauma but still

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
I don't want to repeat myself too much

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
From Wednesday's word house but some of my co-hosts

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Really got into how they

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Feel that this is being charged for a patch

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
That a lot of this stuff should have been

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Taken care of in a patch

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
But I said that you know I'm

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Really looking forward to five man's coming back

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Thank god because I've been really pissed

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Off that Pandaria neglected them

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
And that's probably the reason I'm not playing right now

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
It's because I really can't fucking stand LFR

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
And but

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Five man's you can tolerate it's much easier

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
When it's five people versus twenty five

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
It's something about that social dynamic

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
But I am really jazzed to hear about these

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Rating changes where now you can

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
LFR with eleven people

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
So if you can put a group together and

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
You know when I say eleven that's an arbitrary

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Number between ten and twenty five

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
You can now do LFR difficulty with

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
A pre-established group of like eleven twelve people

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Everything flexes now

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
And for the hardcore players they're getting a new

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Difficulty called mythic rating

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
That's all twenty man that's it no more tens and

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Twenty fives twenty man

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
That part's cool

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
I do actually miss the rating but you know

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
The big crappy part of it was at the end

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Was that I like to

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Chat with all my friends you know

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
In the guild

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
And it just sort of got to be a ghost

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Town sort of I mean I was fine doing all the

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Stuff by myself it's a you can easily

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Play through anything in

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
World of Warcraft as a solo game

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Right and it's the actually

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
That's one advantage it has over Final Fantasy

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Fourteen to me because you have to

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Have other people to do the

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
The duty

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Things like what's

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
The like the dungeons

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
The dungeons yeah you have to do those yeah

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
I like the better that they're four people

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
And not five but still it's

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
I liked having the option of

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Me being able to do this shit by myself and

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Then going back and doing

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Dungeons alone

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
So that I could see what they were like because you know

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
That's how I was farming for

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
And you can't do that

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
In Final Fantasy Fourteen because it level sinks you

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Exactly which is you know

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
It's good and bad

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
So yeah pluses and minuses

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
I don't know for right now there's

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
As much as I

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Really really want to see the new content

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
I can't justify it so

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Well we don't even know the date anyway so you have a long time

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
To make up your mind

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
So if Final Fantasy Fourteen turns crusty and old then maybe I'll be back

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Which it might and Blizzard's probably

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Banking on that a little bit so we'll see

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
Alright moving on

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Loki

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
So let's talk a little bit

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
About the

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Let's go back and talk about gold

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
As I mentioned before

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
You know there's the Xbox Live

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Games with Gold thing that you get

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Some free games and originally

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
It was oh hey we're gonna like

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Stop it you know once

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Xbox One comes out and everyone's like

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Why the fuck aren't you just continuing

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
That well now they're like well hey we're gonna

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
We're gonna do it again and uh

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
We're gonna keep it going through

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
2014 and we're gonna include

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Xbox One games on a monthly basis

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Which makes me

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Believe that that's

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Probably gonna be digital games

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Cause I don't see them

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Giving away

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Well I could see them giving away

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
Rise cause that game looks like crap but

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
There's no way they're giving away retail games for the first year

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Or for at least six months

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Probably a lot of download stuff

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
So yeah it'll be a while

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
But um hey

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Still though it's good to see that that's gonna be continuing

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
On I would not be surprised

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Though even if they did retail games

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
That that doesn't change to be more like

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
The Playstation Network program where

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
You have to continue being a live member

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
In order to I mean cause come on they

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Put everything else behind the fucking paywall

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
What makes you think that they're all of a sudden gonna just

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Continue on with oh sure are we generous

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
To give you free games that you can have forever

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Nah nah this is Microsoft

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Sony's doing it and people

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Are happy with it they're gonna do it too

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Um I guess

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Yeah I'm excited to go

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
In there and see what they're gonna give away on 360

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
And maybe flag some of the

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Games but at the same time my

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Account's coming up for renewal

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Soon I don't know if I'm gonna do it

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Cause I'm just like there's really nothing

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
I'm playing online on 360 anymore

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
I've been playing Mass Effect 3 pretty heavily for a while

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
But now most of the people I play with are on PC

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
And we haven't really done

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Forzen forever and

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
There's really not a lot to play on 360 right now

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Even on PS to be fair on Playstation 3

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
There's not a lot I play online either it's all PC

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Or really nothing

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
It's all free now so I mean it's free

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
True

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Mine's renewing soon too but I do

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Play quite a bit on 360

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
So I'll probably keep mine but

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
You know it

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
The free games aren't really

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
A benefit right now it's just kinda like

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Oh cool old ass shit I don't

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Want anyways but I'll take it

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Because you're giving it to me for free

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
You know it's like I already have Halo

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Or I already have Crackdown but

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Now I have a digital version of it

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Fable 3 another one

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Oh fantastic

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Fable 3 was kinda crap anyway

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Alright let's move on

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Nintendo put out a bit of news

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
This week they did another one of their

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Nintendo Directs which is how they get the news out

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
These days taking their case

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Directly to their fans and

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Cutting out all the skeptics in between

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
This is the news that came out

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
On their Direct on November 13th

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
A release date for Mario Party Island Tour

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
In Europe that will be January even though we're

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Getting that next week right? Sorry Europe

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
You gotta wait till the new year

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
The 3DS will be getting YouTube

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Which is kinda one of those things they announced it and I went

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
It's not already there and I

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Oh yeah it's really not already there so

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Finally YouTube on the 3DS

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Grasping the internet

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Which by the way let me throw this out there

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
See what the live chatters think I was gonna keep this a

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Secret but what the hell

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
I'm thinking about putting OLR episodes up in full

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
On YouTube and no this will not involve

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Video but just like a static picture

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
While you have because now you don't have to break

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Things up into 15 minutes anymore so you just do 3 hours

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
And my

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Big problem right now I can't get in the Orange

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Zaun's radio account so I need Jason's help

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Getting me back in there I don't remember how to get in

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
They switched YouTube so many times now

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
With the integration I can't log into the account

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
So hopefully Jason can figure it out or he might be

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Screwed I'm gonna have to get a new name but I am thinking about

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Putting up episodes in full on

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
YouTube which when I hear things like

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
This like oh YouTube on the 3DS

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
I go oh that would be really cool

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Because people can't like

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Download MP3's on their

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
DS or at least I don't think they can right

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
That's not really a thing you can't like do podcasts

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
On a 3DS otherwise yeah I think it does have a

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Sound player but I'm not sure if it's

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
MP3's or if it's like

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
MPA or that

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
iTunes format or whatever it is

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Regardless you can't do podcasts we know that

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Even though the PSP did that website on the

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
PSP that did it you can't really do it easy

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
So that is something we're toying with

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
So that's really cool to hear that YouTube

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Will be on the 3DS so that you know

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
For whatever it is on YouTube you want to look at

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
And YouTube on the 3DS

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
I believe that there is a YouTube

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Player for the Playstation 4 as well

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
So there you go

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Hey it's all over the place there you go

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Alright um other things

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
3DS and Wii U

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
There's going to be a system update for both

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
And finally the eShops will be

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Combined thank god it's about

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Time right they're going to combine the

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
eShops not the games

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Sorry but the account balances

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Will be one and the same so the good news

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Is if you have like 23 cents sitting

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
In your wallet on 3DS and like you know

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
23 cents on your all that leftover

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Change you'll be able to combine it

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Yay buy something

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
And not have that leftover change anymore

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
DLC coming to

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Pikmin 3

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
DLC worked out pretty well for Mario Wii U

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Last year with the Super Luigi Brothers

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
So it will be interesting to see what comes to the

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Pikmin 3 DLC

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Bravely Default comes to the US on

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
February 7th

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Comes out in North America on February 28th

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
And there is a new

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Hero mode in Zelda A Link Between

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Worlds and

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
There's also something

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
About and I'm not finding here Miiverse

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
On 3DS but I know we have a

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Kind of a follow up on that in a little bit here

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
So I'll wait for that but one other

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Big thing I wanted to mention here is Super Mario 3D

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
World the rumors

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
From a couple weeks ago that Rosalina is going to be

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
A playable character turned out to be true

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
You will not only have your classic

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Mario Brothers 2 characters meaning

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Mario, Luigi, Toad and Princess Toadstool

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
But Rosalina will be unlocked

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
And she does like a little

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Spin attack type thing

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
So she will be available in Super Mario

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
3D World I missed what the

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Qualifications were to unlock her

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I want to say that if you had like a

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Save file from the old game you get it right away

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
No no that's um

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
If you have Super Luigi Brothers you get the

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Classic Mario Brothers

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Reskinned into Luigi Brothers you get

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
That but

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Yeah that's really cool Rosalina is another character there

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
So hooray

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Yeah I'm very excited about Mario

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
3D World

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
I'm glad

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Yay excitement

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Alright DarkSakura what do you have for us

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Well speaking of

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
3DS stuff Miiverse

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Has got a few restrictions on it that may

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Not please people

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
It's the Wii U social network

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
That they're doing

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
It's going to be out on 3DS in December

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
But they are not going to allow

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Private messages or

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Friend requests they don't have those

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Features basically I think

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
That's kind of going along with what

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Happened with

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Not PictoChat

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Swapnote

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
To avoid

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
You know getting out anything

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
That may not be safe for little kitties

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
And you know

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
An easily offendable adult

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
So it's

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
They're still

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Going to be able to use this for

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Consolidating their eShop

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Balances like you were saying

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
And

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
But they can leave

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Comments about games

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
There's a sort of a bulletin board thing about that

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
But you're not going to be able to

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Do the actual private

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Message person to person

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Cause there might be a penis

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
If you allow that

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
You know what

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
If they're allowing you to put comments on a bulletin

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Board it is very

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Easy to do an ASCII cock

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Yeah but Miiverse is moderated

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
That stuff gets poor

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
It'll be on there for 5 seconds Rob

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
That's right somebody might see it in 5 seconds

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Someone will see the penis

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
They will touch it they will love it

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
With their little stylus

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Boop it

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Boop it

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Boop the penis

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Boop

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Oh I thought you meant to say boppet

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Like I'm thinking about those old like

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Boppet twist it throw it

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Turn it

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
I saw one of those at the thrift store the other day and some kid was playing with it

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
And was like this toy

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Sucks

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
I was like that's what we thought

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
When it came out

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Didn't they make like boppet for the Nintendo Wii

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Am I crazy or wasn't there like actually

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
A boppet game

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
No there wasn't a boppet game

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
There was like Jenga

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
They had a few Jenga games

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
And I was like what the

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
That's dumb

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
People can barely play Jenga in real life

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
No I guess there was

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
There was a family game night

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
That came out

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
That boppet I guess

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Why did I think there was a boppet game

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Because that would be a retarded enough idea

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Where they might do something like that

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I mean they made Jenga

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Wow really S2 under Matt says there's a boppet TV show

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I didn't know that

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Why?

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
I had no idea

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
If it was like chicks topless

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
And dudes pantsless playing

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Bop it

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
That might be the reason to watch the TV show right

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Fair enough

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Maybe

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Cinemax needs to get in on the boppet TV show

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Bop it

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Twist it

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Turn it

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Touch it

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
I'm sorry you were talking about

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
I don't like where this shows going

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
You were talking about pantsless guys

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Hilarious mental imagery

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Equal opportunity

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
If you gotta have topless chicks

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
But I imagine that male dangly bits look a lot more hilarious

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Than boobs bouncing

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Alright

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Moving on

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
I don't like where this shows going

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
It's going to a dark place

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Let's go to release dates

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000

But not Rocksmith

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Although hey that game did have a cameo

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
In what was it

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Or whatever that was

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Isn't that movie awful?

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
I heard horrible things

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Oh it wasn't very good

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
I know there's some Nintendo games coming out as well

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000

They're still claiming they're coming out that week

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
So maybe that'll be out

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000

Golden Black with

The Legend of Zelda The Link Between Worlds

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
That's it

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
And then it officially dies to nothing

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I was gonna say last big week of the year

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
It goes into a coma for the next

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Two months

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Last big week of the year because then

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
After that you've got Black Friday

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
And that's when all the stuff is supposed to be out by

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Well actually there's like

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
The first week in December you've got

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Gran Turismo 6

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
And then it literally

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
There is nothing

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Well the South Park game was supposed to be there

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Yeah the South Park was supposed to be on the 10th

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Now on the 10th there's

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Some game about Curry

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
That's coming out on the Vita

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
And then January there's literally

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
The disc version of Wii Fit U

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
The pedometer and you want to buy

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
The disc version of the game

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
And then the bundle with the

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Balance board

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
That's it

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
That's literally everything between now and January

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
And February

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
It's like nothing

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
This segment will go by quickly

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
What's coming out?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Nothing

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Let's see go into our chatroom at

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Live.vognetwork.com

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
I'm all over that shit

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Cause I'm a classy bitch

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
You and me both Cody

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
By the way speaking of classy bitch

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
I want to thank Alan for bringing me the wine

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
To drink during the show

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Can I smell it? Yes you may

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
You could have a little taste if you want

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
I don't know if it's against your

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
What you can and can't eat right now

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
You know what I have to try that stuff that Victoria told me about

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
The Fravolo?

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Yeah

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
I need some of that in my life

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Actually we're looking at going out to the winery in a couple weeks

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
To do that

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Kidnap me. I don't know if Lady Victoria will be here

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
But she hasn't been on the show in forever

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
She was on like one show in the old studio

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
None of the listeners here probably know her

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
We need to kidnap her. We do

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Victoria would be great on this show

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Because she's a wow widow

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
In one of her relationships many years ago

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
The guy cared about World of Warcraft

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
More than her

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
And so she's got all these stories about how much she hates

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
The storming the castle game

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
I've wanted to get her on Horde House because of that

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
But anyway, I digress

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Let's talk about Japanese release dates

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
On the Playstation 4 this week

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
You guys don't get the Playstation 4 until February

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
I'm so mean. Why did I say that?

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Well actually

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
I will bring this around because

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
I kind of think that whole

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Delay in Japan kind of plays

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Into part of the reason why I'm not feeling

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
The Playstation 4 here right now

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Because I think a lot of stuff isn't coming out

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Until Japan has the Playstation 4

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
So I think that plays into it more

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Than we might want to admit here in the US

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
I don't know, but anyway

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
That just kind of was a little reminder there

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
As I was looking at the release dates

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Oh yeah, Japan didn't have all this craziness that we had here this week

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
With Playstation 4

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
However, on the Playstation 3

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Still kicking this week in Japan

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Hey, if you're mad at me about what I said about the Playstation 4

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
You can get your revenge this week

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
With Lightning Returns Final Fantasy 13

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
I really want that game

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
I can't play it until like February

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
It takes me revenge because after the last one

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
It might be just like

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
I thought Final Fantasy 13 2 was good

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
It was good

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Whatever

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Final Fantasy 13 Lightning Returns

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
It'll be interesting, we'll say that much one way or the other

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
That is out in Japan this week on the Playstation 3

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Hanasaku Mani Mani also comes out

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Monster Hunter Frontier G

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
In like a beginners package

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Is out this week as well

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
In Japan

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Need for Speed Rivals makes its way to Japan as well

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.000
And Shin Atelier Rorona Hajimari no Morgatari

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
The Alchemist of Arland

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Comes out this week on Playstation 3

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
As well

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
There's also by the way like a special

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Ultimate box for Lightning Returns

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
I guess that's some type of collector's edition I didn't really read up on

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Because I don't plan on importing it

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000
On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Looking there real quick

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Just Lightning Returns on the 360 as well

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
And Need for Speed Rivals

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Also comes out in Japan this week on the 360

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Going over to the Playstation Vita

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
The Shin Atelier Rorona game I mentioned earlier

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Is also on the Playstation Vita

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
And that's really it this week on the Vita

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
And the Wii U this week

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Gets Super Mario 3D World

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Taiko no Tatujin on the Wii U

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Damn the Wii U for not being region-free

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Damn it because I would so import that game

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
I love Taiko no Tatujin

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
It's so cute

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
It still had the inflatable drum

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Although it probably doesn't

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
It probably uses the touchpad and the stylus

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Oh no I guess they're selling a bundle set

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
That has a Taiko with it

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
And a bocce

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
They don't have a picture of what it looks like

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Oh there it is

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
There's a tiny tiny little picture of it

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
I love the little Taiko on the thing

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
They're so cute

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
And they look like kitty faces

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
I want to take one of the little

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
I have a Taiko plushie

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
And I wanted to put kitty ears on it

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Just because it looks like cat faces

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
So cute

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
On the Nintendo 3DS

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
This week in Japan

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
We have a Nintendo 3DS XL

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
In Chopper Pink

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
And Luffy Red

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
In conjunction with

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
One Piece Unlimited World R

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
From Bandai Namco

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
And gets those special 3DS's with that

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
There's also Tongari Bushi

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
To Maho Nomachi

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
And Atsufutari

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
No My Princess

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Biohazard Revelations

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Or Resident Evil of course

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Gets a price reduction this week

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
And most importantly on the 3DS

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
If you screw up on all those other games

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Don't worry

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Mama will fix it

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
And Cooking Mama 5 out this week in Japan

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
I'm glad Mama's going back to her roots

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
After all that gardening shit

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
What the hell else did Mama fix?

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
What were all those spinoff games?

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
I know there was Gardening Mama

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
I thought there was one other one

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
There's Crafting Mama

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Babysitting Mama

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Remember with the creepy one

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Yeah they put the Wii Remote inside

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
It's ass

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
I remember that

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
There was Crafting Mama

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Gardening Mama

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Babysitting Mama

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
And then 3 or 4 Cooking Mamas

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Alright

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
There you go

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
By AkumaJP in our chatroom

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
I have no problem understanding that

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Good job

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Yay I pronounced at least one of those games correctly

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
12 years

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Will do a lot

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Never had a class believe it or not

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Let's go around for the

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
UK releases Dark Sakura

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
There were a few things

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Actually a few things coming out

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
It's a pretty long list

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
So I'm just going to start from the 19th

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
We have on the 19th NBA Live 14

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Then on the 20th we have

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Contrast and Soul Calibur 2 HD Online

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
And then on the 21st

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
There is Battlefield 4

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
FIFA 14

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Madden XL

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
I got the 3DS thing on the head

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Madden NFL 25

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
And Shiva Kosher Edition

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Wait

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
I need to check this out

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Then on the 22nd

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Angry Birds Star Wars

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Assassin's Creed 4

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Basically all the new release stuff

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
The system release stuff

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
So there's Crimson Dragon, Dead Rising 3

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Connect Sports Rivals

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Preseason, Need for Speed Rivals

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Blah blah blah

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Tearaway

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Legend of Zelda, Link Between Worlds, Watch Dogs

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Young Justice Legacy

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Power Star Golf and Zoo Tycoon

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Alright, that's it

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Yarp

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Busy busy week, that segment is going to slow down

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
In the coming weeks

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Have fun with all the games

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
There's a lot to choose from

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
It's a great time to be a gamer

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
No matter what system it is you're backing right now

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Or if it's several, lots of great stuff to look forward to

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
And PC gamers

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Not leaving you guys out because

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
There's that rumored Steam sale coming right after Thanksgiving

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
There's a fall sale and then there's an

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Actual

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Xmas or holiday sale

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Prepare your wallets

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Winter is coming

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Winter Sale is coming

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Alright

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Let's do a few more news stories

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
And then the classic game of the week, Loki

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
So Nintendo has actually

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Purchased some stake in

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
I guess this company

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Dwango

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Dwango owns Nico Nico

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Which is a video

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Delivery service

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
And I guess

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Maybe they're planning on

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Using that to

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
I don't know, either deliver

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Games or

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
No idea

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
But it's interesting

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
To see that they

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Purchase

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
612,000 shares

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
So

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Interesting, web services

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
It's a web service company that provides

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Content through mobile phones

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
I don't know if that means

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Streaming videos or something

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Interesting that they're getting involved

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Hmmm

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Tinfoil hat

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Tinfoil hat time

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Could this be a clue

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Just buying stock in the company doesn't necessarily mean

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
It's not buying the company

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Could this be a clue

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
About where Nintendo wants to go

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
With their next handheld system

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Not going to say that they're going to make it a phone

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Because I don't think that's correct

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
But maybe something about

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
What if it

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Could get data

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
I think it's like an iPad

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
It does 4G and it does streaming video

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
That's the one thing we didn't really see

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
On the 3DS that I thought we would

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Like I know it's got Netflix and that stuff

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Well they had that at first

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Remember they were going to do 3D movies on there

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Yeah, whatever happened to that

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
They kind of fizzled out I guess

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
I remember when they were showing the demos

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
The very first E3 or whatever

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
I think they had the trailer for Tangled

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Was the one thing we saw in 3D

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
On the 3DS

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
An animated movie that was in there

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
And Tron was like something I was like, fuck yeah

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
They need to put Tron and 3D out on the 3DS

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
But that never happened, it fizzled

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Maybe not enough demand

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Could there be a hint there

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
If this is some type of streaming service

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Could there be some type of movie thing

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Being built into the next DS

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
I'm totally tinfoil-hatting

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
But I don't, I mean

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
The 3D movie thing sounded cool

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
But now that they're getting away from 3D

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
I don't know

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.000
It's true because maybe 3D isn't going to be such a big deal

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
WhatupG even agrees with you there

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
I think Nintendo's next handheld will be 2D

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.000
That comment from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Alright

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
We'll see if anything comes of my tinfoil-hatting

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
This will be happening for sure though

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Heroes of the Storm

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Was another game that Blizzard announced at BlizzCon

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
I'm excited about this

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
I'm not super into MOBAs

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
But even though I'm terrible at them

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
I've tried to play them and they are fun

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
League of Legends and Dota 2

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
This is Blizzard's answer to that whole craze

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Because after all, one of the first MOBAs

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Defense of the Ancients

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
An add-on for Warcraft 3

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
So it kind of, in a way, started with a Blizzard game

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
But obviously spun out in all these different directions

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Heroes of the Storm

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
The beta sign-ups are available

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
So if there's something you're interested in beta testing

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
You don't have to be an active WoW player

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Or anything like that

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
You just have to have a battle.net account

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
And you can update your beta preferences

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
For Heroes of the Storm

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
So that's something I know I did right away

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
But if you guys are interested in this

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Don't forget to update your battle.net accounts for the same thing

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Now, they announced

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Some of the heroes that are going to be in the game

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
And I have to admit

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Even though cinematic trailers kind of bother me

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Because you literally see none of the game

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
In these Blizzard cinematic trailers

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
As far as fan wank goes

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
It was pretty awesome

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
To see all these characters just out and outright

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
And each other here

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Did you see this cinematic trailer they were doing for Heroes of the Storm

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
That had some of these bad guys

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
And good guys in it all kind of coming together

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
It was pretty neat

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
To see everybody in that one video

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
But I noticed, the first thing I said

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Is I said, where are the lost Vikings?

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Exactly, they're still hanging out in that cave

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
I looked at this trailer

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
And I said, where are the lost Vikings?

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
It's like an old school Blizzard property

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
A lot of people remember, right?

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Well apparently I'm not the only one

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Who came out this week

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
During Blizzcon

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
While Dustin Browder, who's a Blizzard game designer

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Was being interviewed with GameSpot

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
He said, quote, there's a good chance for lost Vikings

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
That's one of the characters we've been really interested in doing

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
It's a way we can do three characters

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
And you're controlling them and swapping back and forth

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
I think we've really got some ideas

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
That we might be able to make work

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
But we're going to have to test it first

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
To really see

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
That's interesting, they don't want to put in the Vikings separately

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
They want to have like ice climbers

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
That's some shit

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
One character that you control one of

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
And it's all three of them type of thing

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
That could be very interesting

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
So don't count the lost Vikings out

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Another one not to count out

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
What's that Super Nintendo game, Blackthorn?

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Whatever's the one they did on Super Nintendo

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
They released that for free on Battle.net

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
You just go download it, totally for free

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
And have a blast with that

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
I have a feeling they could be putting him

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
In Heroes of the Storm 2

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Why not?

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
More than just World of Warcraft

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
For the record, I do absolutely

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Love that the lost Vikings

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Are in World of Warcraft

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
You can just go hang out with them if you're Alliance

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
And you can kill the shit out of them if you're Horde

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
That part's pretty cool

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Very cool

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Alright, let's

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Travel to a time that was simpler

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
We're going to go back to a time when lost Vikings

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Might have actually been out

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
It's the classic game of the week

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
No, Dark Sakura didn't pick lost Vikings

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
But she did pick something else that's very cool

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
I picked something that my autocorrect

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Tried to change to Zantac

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
I picked Zanac

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Zanac is the classic game of the week

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Zanac, and if you ever

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Have played this game or have seen it played

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
You can definitely tell it's a freaking compile game

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
I mean, seriously

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
It's fucking compile

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Um, it is

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Um, like I said, designed by

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Compile and released in Japan by

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Pony Canyon and by FCI

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
In the US

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
It was first an MSX game as was

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Gardic

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Um, which we got

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
We got Gardic Gaiden as the guardian legend

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Um, and

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
It came out on the Famicom Disk System

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
And the NES

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
And later on came out for the Virtual Console

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
And it also came out

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
On MSX2 as

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Zanac EX and PlayStation as Zanac

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
X Zanac

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
So basically you play one ship called the

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
X502 Zanac through twelve levels

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
And you have to destroy the system

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Ooh, taking down the system

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
So you have

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Um, it was

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Actually developed by

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Some of the main developers at Compile

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Um, these are the

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Same ones who went in to do the guardian legend

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Blazing lasers and Puyo Puyo

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Um, it was basically

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
And

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
This is where I say you can tell it's a freaking compile shooter

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Because watching it looks like

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Playing through those shooting levels of guardian legend

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
I mean down to graphical style and everything

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
The music

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Is definitely compile stuff

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
And just watching it through

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
It's a very fast

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
And kind of difficult game

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
It's really not super easy

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
And uh, you know you've got your

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Weapons boost, you have uh

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
You either, you know

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Game over when you lose your lives or you beat

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
The game, you do get

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Extra lives as you go

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Excuse me

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
You do also

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Have like

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Your special weapons

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
That are based off of whatever number

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Is labeled

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
And you lose all of your powerups

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Of course if you get hit

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Your enemies are

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
You have meteors

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
You have different aircraft

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
You have these discs

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
That are

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
You can't shoot them, they're impervious

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
You have ground turrets

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Different planes, you have your different bosses

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Can I just say real quick, those discs come right out

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Or are in guardian legend, I swear

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Like, I have to admit

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Dark Sakura, I know of Xanac

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
And I know some of the stuff with the lunar

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Lander and all that, which we'll probably get into in a minute

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
But I've never actually played it

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
And I'm watching this

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Little video here and I'm like, wow

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
This really does look like a shooter stage out of the guardian legend

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
I mean the sprites are a little different

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
But just the way, like the sound

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Is very similar

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
And that's the thing about compile

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
You notice they did have the little

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Ground things that you shoot there

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Those exact things were in

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Guardian legend that had your powerup

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Your little

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
And even the way those bullets look, those are bullets

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Straight out of guardian legend too, so this is interesting

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt that

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
It's good that you did because compile

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
I mean basically until

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
For all of their NES shooters, compile really did

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Or, I shouldn't just say NES

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
They're 8-bit shooters

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Really did stick

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
With a certain style, even blazing lasers

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
To an extent, has that

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Overwhelming compile look

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
To it, and I hate to say

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
If you play one compile shooter, you've played most of them

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
You know, except

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Guardian legend actually happened to have

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
A really cool adventure sequences

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
And so much to do

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Now, there was that

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Compilation, like I mentioned for Playstation

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
That was Xanac, ex-Xanac

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
And

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
As far as

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
That's concerned

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
It also had an updated version of Xanac

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Called Xanac Neo

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
And the different NES versions

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
So I'd definitely say if someone can find that

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
They should go ahead and do it because

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
All in all, even if you get over

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
It's striking similarities to the

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Other games

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Then

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
It's still, you know

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
It's still

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
It's still a very

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Good shooter to play

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
And I'd definitely say

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
It's worth adding to any library

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
So, that's it, Xanac

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
There it is

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
If anyone's wondering if I've done this before, I think you might be getting

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Confused with Zexes

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Yes, you did do Zexes, I remember that

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
But you've never done Xanac

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Wow, somebody has already updated

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
I was on the wiki, because somebody in chat was suggesting

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
That you do Shenmue

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
And I was like, yeah I know, Act F was like

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
And I'm like, really, when?

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
And sure enough, you did do that in episode

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
326, somebody that was long, 356

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
You did a long time ago

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Yes, this list is getting very long

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
But as I'm on the list, already updated

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
To say Xanac there, episode 527

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Well done, wiki editors

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
And honestly, and I have to say

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
For the people who update the wiki, I seriously do rely on you

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Because, I mean

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
If you guys are having trouble remembering what I've picked

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Imagine the trouble I'm having

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
When, no no no, I have to describe

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
This, I've got

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
A wall of shelves behind me

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
At my house that's loaded with video games

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
And I have to look at this shit

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Going, what have I not done?

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
So I've just started picking games

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
By freaking year, and I picked 1986 this time

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
So it worked

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Fun OLR trivia

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
The very first Classic Game of the Week

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Episode 250

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Was the very first Classic Game of the Week

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
And we all know what it was

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Do we? Do you remember? What was it?

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
It was Vibribin, no it wasn't

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
It was Fantasy Zone

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
It was Fantasy Zone, was the very first Classic Game of the Week

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Because Fantasy Zone is my favorite

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
No, my second favorite video game ever

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
My first favorite being

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Guardian Legend, and my third favorite being

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Space Harrier

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
You did end up doing Guardian Legend later, and I remember you came in here and you were like

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Ah, fuck it, we're doing Guardian Legend tonight

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
I was saving it, but

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
You were very much like, you know what?

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
The hell with it, episode 256

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
I kind of go through this thing where I don't

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Want to do things that are too expected

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Or too much of the

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Everybody loves this fucking game, ooh

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
You know, I want to do something

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
That maybe people haven't heard of

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Or good games that people just

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
May have overlooked

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Sometimes you have to do Final Fantasy 6 twice

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
No, sometimes

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Yeah

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Well, like I said

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
It's hard to remember

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
You know, I'm probably going to have to do Kickle Cubicle

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Just because

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Dan was playing it the other day

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
I still have a list like a mile long of Commodore 64 games

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Whenever you're ready

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
You need to show me some of these games

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
I'm going to do Oregon Trail next week, guys

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
That would be awesome, why don't you do Oregon Trail?

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
I might

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
If you have some suggestions for Dark Soccer

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Oregon Trail is stuck in my head because I just got finished reading

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Problem Sleuth

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
And there's a whole tribute to Oregon Trail in there

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Nice

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
You can hit Dark Soccer up on Tumblr

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
I usually would give out your Twitter

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
You know what, I make sure to check Twitter at least once a week

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
So my Twitter is

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
DarkSakura

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
My Tumblr is Kurotsubasa

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Blackwing

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Because I'm so dark

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Or, uh, shoot

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Harass me on the mailbag

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
I'll complain about it and then critique your grammar

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
And then I'll probably do it

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Alright, mailbag at orangeonstrader.com

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
We're going to take a break, though

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
I think I've done Twinbee

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
We're going to take a break, then we're going to come back

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
And we're going to do the mailbag

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
And the FUs of the Week

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
And your live phone calls

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Rapid Fire News

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
PS4 sales

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Politics and games

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
And pornography in part B tonight

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Yes, a legit porn story

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Coming up in part B tonight

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
So you definitely don't want to go anywhere

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
We will be right back after this

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live on this Sunday evening

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
November the 17th, 2013

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000
With the 527th episode of our show already in progress

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:39.000
And some good classic songs from some old games there during our break

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Which sadly we can't play during the podcast

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
But we do play live

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
We had the epilogue from Final Fantasy IV

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Which I always love that ending

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
And then Mega Man 7's introduction

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Which, you know, I think there's mixed opinions on Mega Man 7

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
But I thought it was pretty cool

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
During the break, a lot of folks in our chat room

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
I noticed over at live.vognetwork.com

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Talking about weight loss and a lot of successes

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Which is interesting

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Because Thanksgiving is not usually the time of year

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
When you hear about weight loss

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
But a lot of people have been successful with their various things

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Including Dark Soccer

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
You've been doing very well

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Yeah, I'm actually

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
And I know it's going to sound fad-like and everything

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
But I've done similar stuff before

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
And I honestly feel better doing it

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.000
As I'm doing this whole ketogenic eating thing

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Where it's like really low carb

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
But you also have a percentage of like how much fat you eat

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
And how much protein you eat

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
And that's a lot of protein

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:36.000
But I also go to the gym at least once a week

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.000
And I do body weight exercises in my house

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
If I don't go to the gym

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
So it's working out with weights three times a week

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
And walking on the opposite days

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
I really couldn't do low carb

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Because I just love bread

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Is there a diet where I can eat nothing but bread?

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Well, I did find a recipe to make bread

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Out of coconut flour

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Oh, I like coconut

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:02.000
And Tiara sent me a recipe to do red velvet cupcakes

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Which I'm going to be trying

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
I have actually found a lot of people

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Speak very highly of almond flour bread

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
And coconut flour bread

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Interesting

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
I haven't missed it, honestly

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
I need to get motivated

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
I need to get Wii Fit U

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Well, to be honest

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
It was just sort of like

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
You remember when I moved out here

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
How much I put on

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
I'm going to say it on air, I was a size 20

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
I don't mind saying it

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
And I dropped down to a 12

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
And then I put back on some

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
So it's like

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
I could just continue

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
To eat all of the stuff that makes me feel like shit

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Because I've got digestion problems

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Eating too much sugar

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Actually makes me

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Have a harder time concentrating

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
And since cutting all of it out

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
I'm actually feeling infinitely better than I ever did

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
And plus, I have more energy for

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Stuff I want to do

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
I'm planning on playing DDR again

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Gene in our chat room at Live.vongnetwork.com says

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Wow, we are all so healthy

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Not me, no, not me

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
AgDef says Wii Fit U up

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
I need to figure out something to get into

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
We'll see

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Alright, moving on

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Let's get into some rapid fire news

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Back to games

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
This is another reason why I'm not losing any weight

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Because I'm too busy playing video games

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Although, no, I shouldn't play into that stereotype

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Because there's a lot of people

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
That play an awful lot of video games

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
It's about finding the balance, absolutely

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
And for those of you guys who don't listen to Hoard House

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
I know Extrovert has a great story there

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
He plays a lot of video games

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
But he lost a lot of weight

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
It's really quite something

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Well, what I've started doing now

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
I have set times now

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
For me to play my games

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
I play Animal Crossing in the morning

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
So that I can go to the island and get a tan

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Because fuck

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
But I play while walking around the house

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
And feeding the cat

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
And putting up dishes

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
And doing chores in the house

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
I'll do parts of it

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
And then the hour while my character is on the island

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Is when I go do yoga

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
I'm actually using my games

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
To help me set my exercise times

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Okay

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
So I know that when an hour is up

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:16.000
I do about maybe 30 minutes of yoga

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
And then I do

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Just wandering around the house and some housework

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Because housework counts as exercise, fuck it

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
And by the time I'm done with that

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
I know it's time to come back from the island

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
And hit Ed with a bug net

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Because fuck him

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Yeah, I guess maybe there's a way I could

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Get on the treadmill and have a 3DS

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
With an iPad or something

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
I used to play Pokemon on the recumbent bike

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Nice, maybe I could figure something like that out

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Oh well, for now, let's get back into video games

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Because that's what the show's about

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
So, Loki, some rapid fire news for us

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Yes, Infamous Second Son

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Which was supposed to be coming out

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
First quarter

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
They finally announced that it will be launching

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
March 21st in North America

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
And they had a wonderful trailer

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
That was during their whole launch special

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
That they did

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Definitely one of the only games I'm looking forward to

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Another interesting one

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Towerfall Ascension

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
You may remember Towerfall from being one of the

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
More popular Ouya games

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Now it's coming to PC

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
And it's going to be coming to Playstation 4 as well

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
That's gonna suck for Ouya a little bit

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Also brand new levels

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
And they've got 50 new levels coming

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
And 50 new versus levels

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
4 more playable characters

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:32.000
And 12 player cooperative quest mode

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
6 additional power ups and more

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
And last but not least

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Rayman Legends is supposed to be coming to

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Next gen consoles in February

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
That's so funny

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
It's like when the Wii U

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Was supposed to be coming out in the Wii U in February

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
And it never did

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Are you throwing shade that that might not actually happen?

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
I don't know if it's going to be in February

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Yeah, it's going to be coming out in next gen consoles

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
I don't know how they're going to make that

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
It's going to look as good

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
I would think on a next gen console

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
They're going to have to

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Yeah, maybe they don't do anything with the graphics

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
They might just up rez some things

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
And do some new textures and things to make it

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Look a little sharper

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Frame rate would be really good

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
All I can think of in my head is that

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Extrofer will have yet another reason to do a stream

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Of Rayman Legends over on his little Twitch channel

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
That he does

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
I think he played the thing start to finish on Twitch

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Interesting

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Moving on, some stuff that I hear

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
I hear click click click click

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Click click click from Loki

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
As soon as he's done with his story

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Cookie cookie cookie cookie cookie cookie

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
I'm going to be done with this game today

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Your addiction is affecting your life in the following ways

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
I may have cheated a little bit

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Look at your life, look at your choices

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
That's a teensy bit

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Well maybe the next thing that Loki can get addicted to

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Is Hatsune Miku Project D.Va

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Nope

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Ah hey, now this game is really cute

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
And if you missed it on the Playstation 3

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
For whatever reason, A buy it on sale

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Or something, but B it will be coming out

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
On the Vita in early 2014

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Very cool, so yeah

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Hatsune Miku coming out in the North America and Europe

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
In early 2014

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
On the Vita, so that was announced this week

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Very exciting

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
When we were getting into it a couple weeks ago

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
On our last episode about the whole fact that

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Swap Note was

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Disabled on the 3DS, somebody had brought up

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Well, we karaoke you

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Has some, you know, F words

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
And things in it, so why is it that

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
You know, you can't send

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Pictures of

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Dongs on Swap Note, but yet you can

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Have fucking shit and all these words

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
In songs on We Karaoke You

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Well, apparently this week it was

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Announced that warnings

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Will be added to the game's eShop

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Page when you get an access

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Token for We Karaoke You

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
And in the app itself

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
That will warn people

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
We Karaoke You by JoySound

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Is intended to provide users with

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Access to a large catalog of songs

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
From a broad range of music labels across a variety

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Of musical genres designed to appeal

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
To all musical tastes

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
As such, Nintendo does not restrict which songs

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Are included in the catalog of songs

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Featured within the We Karaoke You by JoySound

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Application

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Blah blah blah blah blah, the songs aren't rated by

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Peggy, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
So

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Interesting little

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Retcon they had to do

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
For lack of a better word on some of their

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Other games that have adult themes

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
I find this

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Fascinating and I've got to check this out this week

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
I heard about this before

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
And I'm sure you all did too

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
There was a Chinese hack a couple years ago

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Of Final Fantasy 7

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
That they shoved it into an NES

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Cartridge, I don't know which Final Fantasy game they had

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Hacked or if they programmed a new game or something

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
But somebody took Final Fantasy 7 and put it

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
In an NES cart, well that was a

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Couple years ago that that happened but

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
This week it was

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Actually a translation

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Patch that happened by

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Modder Luigia

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
I'm tempted to say Luigia

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
But it's Luigia 2009

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Actually it was a whole team it wasn't just one guy

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
But this modder led this team to

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Actually translate the game but at the same

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Time they actually fixed

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Some things, they redrew some of the graphics

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Improved the music

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Did an actual ending, bug fixes

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Improvements, this is kind of crazy

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Now it's like a legit game

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
That you can play through and check out if you

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Want to check it out in English because I guess it was super broken

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
In its original form but now it's

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Able to play so really

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Curious to see what that looks like

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Yeah

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Their next project that they're working on

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
A

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Unlicensed NES port of

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Pokemon Yellow that came out from

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
The same company on the NES

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
They're going to redo that one in English and fix some of those

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Issues next

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
That's pretty awesome

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Dark Sakura

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Sounds fairly cool

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Well in other news there is some information about

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Metal Gear Solid 5

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Ground Zeroes there's going to be

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
A

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Snake skin

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
A solid snake skin

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
So that you can run around as actual

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Snake

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
And there's going to be a Playstation exclusive

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Mission called Deja Vu

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
There's a trailer for it that's been out

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
And this is supposed to come out in the spring of 2014

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
For the various systems

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Of Microsoft and Sony persuasions

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
In

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Other news

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
There is

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Going to be

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
It looks like a third

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
A new third person game that's coming out by Monolith

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Called Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
That is going to be based

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
In the Lord of the Rings universe and

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
You play as a ranger

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
A ranger named Talion

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
So

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
He's resurrected

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
As a vengeful spirit

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
And he gets to be a wraith

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Like person

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
And then last but not least

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
In the

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Thing that refuses to load on my

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
iPad

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
There is a new character that has been confirmed

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
For the next Smash Brothers and that's Marth

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Not really a new

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Character but you know

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Marth fans will be happy that he's back

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
As long as we get Roy too

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
I think some of the

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Partner characters are the ones in danger

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Like you know it's no

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
It's no surprise

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
That Star Fox will be a character

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
That's in the game but will

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Captain Falcon come back or not Captain Falcon

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
God dammit

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Captain Falcon from F-Zero will absolutely

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Be there

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
This bird Falco

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
He may not be back

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Good

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
But I would think that those are the characters in danger

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Of the partner characters

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
He is kind of a bitch isn't he

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Yeah he's totally a bitch not even a good kind of bitch

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Only good Falco did music in the 1980's

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Hey Rob

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Show me your moves

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
I will show you the FUGO

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Question of the week

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Every week over at

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Facebook and Google Plus

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
You take those words and slam it together you get FUGO

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
We ask a question of our listeners

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
And we read some of the answers here for y'all

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Here on the show

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
This week's question as asked of our communities

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Since the Playstation 4 came out

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
We've noticed an increase of social media

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Posts coming from the device

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
This can include tweets or Facebook

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Posts when someone starts playing the game

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Have y'all noticed this cause I sure did

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Lots more Facebook posts coming from the Playstation 4

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
I ignore Facebook

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Kind of, well I haven't blocked it

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
But I haven't really paid attention

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
I noticed a big increase in the amount of posts

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
I see posts now when people start

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Playing a game

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
So I was very surprised at the increased

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Amount of

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
You know I don't want to say spam

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
But automated posts

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
Coming from the Playstation

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Anyway so that led into our question this week

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
For the Playstation 4 owners

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Do you use social media posting features on your new device

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Why or why not

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
For the non Playstation 4 owners

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Do you like seeing the social media posts

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Made from the Playstation 4

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
So let's get to some of the answers

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
There's so many tonight I'm not going to be able to read them all

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
We'll start with a couple from Google Plus

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Colin M replied and said

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
I only like to see posts when a person starts a game

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
For the first time

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
That way I know what games they're playing

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
And maybe join in or talk to them about it

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
I do not need to see every time an achievement

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Or trophy unlocks

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
I would agree especially if you're meaning

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Not to say like the first and

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Not the subsequent times

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
They start the game but the very first time

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Just to kind of know that they have it

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
And you can ask them questions about it

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
But I don't need to see like

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
So and so is playing Resogun for the 7000th time today

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
I don't need to see that

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Redertainment says

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
As a non Playstation 4 owner

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Posts of people having fun with their PS4

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Serve as a taunt to me

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
A taunt of things that they have that I don't

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
I'm experiencing this more and more as I pursue

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
When but not if but when

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
I buy my house and I begin to fill

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Social media with pictures of my house

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Those pictures will taunt people with what I have

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
And they don't

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
That's true

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
What's the whole point of doing it though?

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Is to say oh so and so has this

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
I want that

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Is that why people post pictures of their kids too?

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
My kids the cutest

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Happy face

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Well I personally think that for some people

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Having children is an unspoken competition

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Don't get me started on that

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
For some people I've met

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Buying a house is an unspoken competition

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
So I'm just saying

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
In the past

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
A good friend of mine just bought a house

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
I'm not shading that I'm talking about in the past

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Many years ago

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
And Alan

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Alan knows exactly what I'm talking about and he's over there

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Saying it too. Alright anyway

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Let's see

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Act Def says I only try to use any

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Social media sharing when it's something like

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Truly special or great

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Like getting a really hard achievement or trophy

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Or telling people that I'll stream a game

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Since now that's possible with the new consoles

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Let's go over to Facebook and get some

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Of the answers over on Facebook

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
And see what people said there

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
How about Burr who said

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
So far as a PS4 owner I've only posted one

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Gameplay clip to Facebook

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Mostly just to see if it worked

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Nobody responded though so I'll probably save it for funny bugs

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Or things that are actually interesting

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
People probably don't want to hear about every little thing I do

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
So I shut off the automatic posting

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
The real fun so far has been the Twitch streaming

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
It's actually an incentive to keep playing

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Since you're entertaining others as much as yourself

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Scott W said

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
I've just started trying it out with screenshots

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
I like it

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Code Man says I don't have a PS4 yet

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
But I don't mind posts if they are from consoles

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
What frustrates me is when people invite me to

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Facebook games and Candy Crush

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
But I enjoy seeing what my friends are playing

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
And it's a chance to get an unbiased opinion

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Rather than the media companies

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Telling me what to play

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
I like that answer

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Tiger Claw says

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
While having those features on the PS4 is good

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
When you want to post something

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
The only downside is your Twitter or Facebook posts

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Would be spammed with so and so playing this game

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Or unlock a trophy

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
If they give the player the ability to control

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
What is posted on Twitter and Facebook

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Then some people won't be bombarded with PS4 spam

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
I kind of agree

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
I don't like the whole idea of all or nothing

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Let me

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
I know on the PS3 you don't get to pick

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Either you turn it on or you turn it off

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
And you can turn on certain types of posts

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
But I can't tell it

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Only post these trophies or what have you

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
That would be a little better I would think

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Or they could have the trophy pop up

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
And say hey do you want to post this to your wall

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Gene W replied

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
I currently do not have a PS4

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
However I'm against these messages

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Because I dislike them already on Facebook

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
And don't really have a desire to have a friends list

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Flaming Toilet

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Flaming Toilet

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
God I love that name

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Responds and says I may be a grumpy old man

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
But I think we've gone way overboard with social media

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Integration everywhere not just gaming

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
The world doesn't need to know my business

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
I certainly don't want to annoy people with it

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Anymore than I have to

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
And I don't really care what trophies other people get or whatever

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
And yes there's every bit of irony

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
In using social media to bitch

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
About social media's ever growing presence

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
In our lives

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
So that's a good way to end it

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
I only read like half the answers

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
So please do check out Facebook and Google Plus for more answers

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Facebook.com slash

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Orange Lounge Radio

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
Or Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
That's right we finally have a short URL

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
And then there's the whole like you know

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Google Plus shoved down throat

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
YouTube comments thing

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
All tweaked and stuff and how people love that

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Yeah I'm not sure how I feel about all that

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Like I'm trying to embrace it

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
I'm trying to do the whole hug it for 15 minutes

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
And see if I like it

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
I will tell you this the fact that I

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Hug it for 15 minutes and see if you get a skin disease

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
I'm trying to

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Trying to embrace it

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
With the whole fact that I'm getting into YouTube

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
More which is unrelated but I'm like alright

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Well maybe this is an incentive to use Google Plus

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
To do more like gaming style posts

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
That tie into the YouTube's ideas

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
I'm like I'm trying to like it that way

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
But obviously it's a very

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Unpopular change

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
But I don't know

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Google used to be the company that you know

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Could do no wrong and

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Lately between

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
You know what was that

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Before they had Google Plus they had

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
What was that social net Buzz oh god

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
That network yeah that was

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
Just bad and then you know

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
They've done some weird things lately

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
No hmm

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
I still love them but I question some of their

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Choices alright let's

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Let's get back into some long gaming news

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Loki Buzz

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
I forgot about that

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Anyways

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Let's talk about PlayStation 4 again

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Why not

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Sold 1 million units the first day

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
So that's got to be pretty good

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
And kind of

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Along the lines of their

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Prediction which is or I should say

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Projection

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
3 million units sold by the end of the year

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
The estimate by Jack Tritten

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
So

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Yeah so that's

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Pretty good and you know definitely

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
I think availability is gonna

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
You know factor in quite

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Heavily especially with the

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Systems coming I don't think it's gonna be an issue

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Where I'm not really sure

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
With the Wii U whether it was you know

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Availability as a problem

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Or demand not being

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Actually I think it's demand not being that high because

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
I remember there was a bunch of systems

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
Sitting at retail

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
In piles and no one gave

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
A shit but

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
PlayStation 4 you know and if

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
There's any sort of indicator whatsoever

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
The grey market

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Is pretty profitable right now so

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
There is demand for the system

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
It's just gonna be availability is gonna kind of

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Slim until

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
I don't know a few months from now

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
And actually it may even be a few months more

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Because you know with the launch and other territories

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
You know they're gonna

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Have to ramp up production more

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Or you know there's just gonna be less systems

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
That go around

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
What types of shortages though that we saw

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Like with the Wii and the 360

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
I don't think it's gonna be as bad

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
As you know the Wii

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
You know what I've been hearing is like a few weeks

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Out or probably a month from

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Launch we're gonna see some more shipments

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Coming in although

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
You know this is completely one other side

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Of you know the spectrum

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
If you're you know consumer trying to

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Pre-order one of those things

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Keep in mind that these places taking pre-orders

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
May have already sold out their second

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Third fourth shipments so

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
You know whereas I've been saying four weeks

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
When we're you know expecting to see some more

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
They yeah

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Are gonna expect them you know more systems in

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
But those may be for customers that already have it

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
You may in fact I think a lot of

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Like the game subs and stuff are saying

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
February now if you haven't pre-ordered yet so

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
You know keep an eye on that and Amazon

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Yeah but you know what GameStop

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Loves to use scare tactics to get people to

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Pre-order so fuck that I don't believe anything

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
They say as far as the pre-order

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
I think Amazon had bundles available

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
You know game system bundles

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
It's probably people like me that cancel their pre-orders honestly

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
They probably had a few of those

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
To go so somebody bought my PlayStation 4

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Which is fine

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
But yeah that's probably what that was

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
To be honest

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Alright um

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
How do you think the Xbox One will sell?

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
I mean I don't want to get too fanboy wars-ish

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
But what do you think?

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
I think it'll sell alright

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
I'm worried that they're gonna have a bigger problem

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Because as of right now

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
They're really

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Shrinking down who's getting the system

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
And you're not gonna see it

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
You're not gonna see it at all

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Independent retailers you're gonna see it at

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
The big stores and that's it

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
So if they're having an issue with production

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
On that stuff then

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Yeah they could be a problem but

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
I think they've got a pretty decent lineup

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
At launch and I think they'll do about as well as the

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
PlayStation or the Xbox One

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Or the PlayStation 4 and the

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Xbox One will do about the same

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Really it comes down to exclusives and

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Let's be honest going

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Forward you know in the least immediate future

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
A lot of the games that are coming out next gen

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Are on both systems so it's

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
There's not a whole lot differentiating

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
One from the other

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
As far as games go I mean

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
So I don't know

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Titanfall I guess I mean there's that

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
But that's on 360 even

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
And PC so I don't know

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Alright well um going back to

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
A story we talked about on our last episode before

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
We had a break we talked about Pocketstation

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Remember the Pocketstation was that

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Cool little portable thing that they

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Had on the PlayStation

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
With the kitty mascot

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
And that there were rumors

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
That it was making a comeback because of some

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Trademarks that had been registered well guess what

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Pocketstation came out as a

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Free app for the PlayStation Vita

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
In Japan and

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Yeah the app is free for

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Japanese PlayStation Plus members

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
They say it includes Crash Bandicoot 3

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Mega Man, Ape Escape and other

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Original PlayStation titles I don't know if that's some type of

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Perk for the PlayStation Plus

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Some free PS1 titles that actually maybe used

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
The Pocketstation

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
But that's pretty cool

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
On December 3rd non PlayStation Plus

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Japanese owners will be able to get it

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
There's also

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
A PlayStation title that's going to be added

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
To that Dokodemo Isho

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Comes out no word about

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
When this is being released in the US but

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
You gotta think that hey if it happened over there

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
It will probably happen here too at some point

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
That's pretty cool

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
That'll be a fun little perk for PlayStation Plus

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Users over here especially if those free games

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Are still involved

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
The other thing I was going to mention and we kind of forgot to mention

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Is the PS Vita

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
TV came out over in Japan

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Oh yeah!

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
The other thing that I heard

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
That kind of sucked about it is it's region locked

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Oh come on!

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
The Vita doesn't normally do that

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
It's a little strange that it's like that

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
They're trying to stop us from

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
I'm not sure

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
I don't know if it's region locked

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
I don't know, I had to read up

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
I didn't really look into it too much

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
I gotta be honest when that thing comes over here

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
I kind of want one

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Especially with all these free games I'm getting

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
From the PlayStation Plus

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
I could play these PSP

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
And Vita and PlayStation games

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
And stuff on there

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
I don't know, I think that'd be pretty awesome

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
You know Jean has a good question in our chatroom

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
At live.vognetwork.com saying

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
I wonder if the Vita sales went up with the PlayStation 4 release

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
You know we're not hearing a lot about that

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
But I'm hearing about the second screen

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
People are really loving that, those that do have a Vita

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
I do have to tell you that Dan was telling me that

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Vita actually went on sale at Radio Shack

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
For 120

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
That did happen the week we were gone, yeah

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
I remember reading about that

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Loki, have you heard anything about the sales for Vita?

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
I mean I can't imagine there's a lot of people

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
That can afford to buy both at once

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
I haven't really been seeing, we haven't been seeing

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
A lot of Vita sales

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
I mean it'd be interesting to see

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
If it does go up at retail

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
I'm thinking if anything people just clearing out

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
Inventory because they probably are sitting on a bunch of them

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
I'm sure with Black Friday you're gonna see

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Some special deals on that stuff

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
There was supposed to be one that was with Tearaway

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
But that got retailer exclusive

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Well it will

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
Also still be interesting to see what happens with

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
The PlayStation Vita in Japan

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Versus here because I realize that Christmas

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Has been quite the same in Japan as it is here

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
But it's still, you know, a deal

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
And there's gonna be the PlayStation Vita

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
That new, the new colors

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
And the new redesign

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Of it already happened

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
So that's kind of what Sony's pushing in Japan right now

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
So I'm really curious to see how that kind of affects things

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Cause you could look at potentially

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
There being more Vitas

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Per person in Japan

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Than there are here

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
It'll be very interesting to see how that affects the development of the games

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
So

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Go to our channel at live.vognetwork.com

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Who has renamed himself

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
PS4 Culture tonight

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Says his co-host Glenn bought a Vita

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Just for the PlayStation 4 tie-in stuff

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Wow

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
That's a heck of a purchase

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
But hey, if you can do it, why not?

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Alright

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
More news, Dark Sakura

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Taking a different turn here

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Well, game politics has alerted us to something

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Remember how we kept talking about

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
The 38 Studios and their

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Sort of

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Down turn with the

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Local economy in Rhode Island

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Yes, that was the one that was owned by

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
What was the name, Curt Schilling, the baseball player, right?

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
You are correct

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
The kingdom of Amalur

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Exactly

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Which was free on PlayStation Plus

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Now there's State Senator Dawson

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Hodgson

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Who is a Republican, so whatever

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Is putting out legislation to

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Basically keep pushing to

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Have an independent commission investigate

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
What happened with 38 Studios

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Which, I mean

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
100 million on the state's

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Debt

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Is a pretty big deal, especially for such a tiny

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
State, I mean

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
I don't know too much more about Rhode Island

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
I've known people from there

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
The state loaned them money

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Which is probably the reason for this

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Which comes right out of

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
You know, tax funds

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
To pay for

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
State improvement

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Help benefits, that type of thing

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
So I can see them wanting to

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
To

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Investigate this

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
And one thing that he said

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
I know that I'm not alone

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
In the belief that the response of our government

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Has been wholly insufficient to the task of delivering

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Answers, accountability, and leadership

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
In the wake of this massive destruction

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Of public resources

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Swift enactment of the bill and diligent

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
Prosecution of its mandate would vindicate these needs

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
And I get where they're coming from

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
At the same time

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
I wonder

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
If it's just something that

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Is time to let go

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Let go, move forward, find other ways of raising

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
The funds, because you can't

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
Get water from a stone

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Unless you happen to be squeezing cheese

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Yeah, I mean I understand the reason why

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
They might want to do the investigation

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
But at the same time, it's like one of those

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Well, it's not going to get the money back

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
You know, what

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Ultimate good is it really going to do

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
I mean, I guess they can

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Make sure this never happens again

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
But I kind of think a lesson

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Has certainly already been learned somewhere

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
But maybe it's about holding certain people accountable

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
I don't know

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
I do think accountability is something

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
To look into

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
But at the same time, I'm wondering if perhaps

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
The state might have been a little short-sighted

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
With the company in the middle of a recession

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Were they starry-eyed

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
At the fact it was a sports star?

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Probably

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Did you hear that they found a full

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Finished game on their servers

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
That they're going to now auction off in December

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Really? No

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
There was another game that was literally done

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
It was for Mac, actually

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
It was a PC game

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Weird, some sort of tactics game

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
Well, they should do it

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
I thought that was kind of funny

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Well, Rhode Island paid for it

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Why didn't you sell it?

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
You could have made some money back

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Yeah, a little bit

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
The sad thing is it probably won't sell for very much money

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
Because nobody knows about it

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
It's got not a lot behind it

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Probably go at bargain-basement prices

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
And somebody will flip it and do pretty well with it

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
We'll see

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
Alright, let's move on

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Loki

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
So let's talk about

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Zune

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
And the fact that

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
I think we already knew it was kind of shutting down

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
But it's

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
It's going away

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
As soon as the Xbox One launch

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
And yeah

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
They're not going to support rental purchasing

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
Or browsing of content

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
And it's going to be

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
I guess now everything is being taken care of

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Through Xbox Music

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
I guess if you're a previous Zune user

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
And you log into the

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Xbox Music service

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
It will show your library

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
As a virtual collector

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
And I guess any previous purchase

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Video content

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
Will transfer over

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
So that's good

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
It's too bad

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
They really tried to

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
They tried to make Zune happen

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
They really tried

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
They sort of tried to compete with the iPods

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
And it just didn't quite happen

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
We had a nice listing in the Zune Cast Store

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
For a while

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
Thanks to the new listeners we got through Zune Cast

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Sorry to hear about what happened to your Zune

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
But you know, it is what it is

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
So

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Alright, well in

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Somewhat brighter news I guess on the Microsoft

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Front, one of the games that people are

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Very excited about on Xbox One

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Killer Instinct

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
And almost more so because of Killer Instinct Classic

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
It's not just the fact that there's the new Killer Instinct

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
Heck yeah

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
But that you can play the classic Killer Instinct as well

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
The Ultra Edition

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Is coming out of the classic Killer Instinct

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
It will have two versions

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Of the arcade version

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
Of Killer Instinct, obviously it's not the

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Super Nintendo version, I mean right

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
So Killer Instinct will get

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
The arcade versions

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Killer Instinct Classic will have the original

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Arcade version, version 1.4

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
And the upgraded

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
ROM revision 1.5D

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Which has glitch fixes

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Infinite combos that were discovered

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
After the game's initial releases

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
Were fixed

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Also some emulating scamline

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Options

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
A training mode is there now though

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
And sprite galleries will be available

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
So that's pretty cool

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
The Killer Instinct Classic

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
It is only available in Killer Instinct

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Ultra Edition

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
And the boxed pin Ultimate Edition

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
You will not be able to buy it separately

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
So if you want this, you have to buy

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
The free to play Killer Instinct game

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
That's the only way to do it

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
But there's definitely a lot of

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
I know people that are going to be buying it

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Just so they can have the classic version

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Because you know what, Killer Instinct

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Especially the classic version was awesome

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
And it will have more characters than the new one

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
That's the sad part

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
They announced

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
Full Gore

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
For what it's worth, Full Gore

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
The classic one is way better than the new one

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Alright

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
You know what's way better each and every week

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Is our mailbag

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
Guys at our email address

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
Dark Soccer

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Is going to dive into the mailbag head first

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
And find some emails that she

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Deems worthy of reading on the show

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
And I imagine after a week off we have quite the backlog

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:22.000
No?

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
A few

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
There is a really

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Long one that I'm just

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
Going to

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
Only read the first paragraph

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Because this is really

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
Fucking long

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
And I'm not going to read the uber novel

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Sorry

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
It's from

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
RawStillUT

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Well in a few hours I'll be waiting

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
In a midnight line for the PS4 at my local GameStop

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
So I thought I would shoot you guys an email before that

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Anyway when talking about the news

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
That define the generation

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
I am surprised that Brown vs Entertainment Merchants Association

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Wasn't brought up

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
With all the talk of blaming video games for society's ills

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
It's hard to argue with a 7 to 2 decision

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
When the time comes

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
For another state to try and strip the gaming industry

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Of its right to free expression

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
After all, even if a law could be narrowly

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Tailored to

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Alito and Roberts

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
I am not sure

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Which I'm not sure

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Even can happen in the current political climate

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
It still leaves 5 justices

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
Who were pretty much close to the idea

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Outright

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
Whoever eventually replaces the older members of the court

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Will almost certainly be more aware of gaming as a medium

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
And California's already beaten economy

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
Was done no favors

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
By the massive reimbursement they had to give the EMA

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
No doubt we'll continue to see

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Scumbag politicians try to pass

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
Feel-good legislations restricting game content

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
We're probably not going to see

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Yet another case go to the Supreme Court

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
Anytime soon

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
As they tend not to listen to the same issues

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
That often

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
This case has given us a huge buffer

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
And while we can't take anything for granted

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
It's hard to see where we'll see

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
Much more than summary dismissals

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
Of the sort of poorly written

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
Headline chasing tripe legislation

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
I love that term, tripe legislation

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
That had defined the previous

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
Decade

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
I'll go so far as to say this will define the next generation

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
As well

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
That is a good pick of something

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
That kind of fell off of our radars

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
I'm not going to deny that that is a very good selection

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
I think one reason

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
That maybe we don't think

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Of it right away compared to some of the other things

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
We talked about last week is because we did kind of dodge a bullet

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
And I think in a lot of our minds

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
Yeah, this is the way it should be

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Duh!

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
Oh, the whole fact that the Supreme Court

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Decided to say that this is a bad idea

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Duh! We all knew it was a bad idea

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
So no harm no foul, right?

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
I'm not belittling

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
The response because I think

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
Yeah, absolutely, this is a decision

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
By the Supreme Court that impacts

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Gaming, period

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
But I think that's why

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
A lot of us kind of neglect to remember it

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
Because it's kind of like, well, they ended up

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
On our side like they should have been

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
So, la di da, didn't really change anything

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
At the end of the day, hooray

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Anyway

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
And I always have to give it

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
To Rossdale, UT for

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Definitely bringing up points

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
That are

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Definitely apt

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
When it comes to comparing

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
What you see in

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
The current generation of gaming

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
Especially with bringing up how

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
We are on that line from changing

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
Sort of how we're thinking

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Of our games

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
To how we used to think of our games

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
It really is a line that's been crossed

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Too many of the people now

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
That are in charge of the industry

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
Were people like us

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Who grew up with it and now see it

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
As a true medium of expression

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
As opposed to

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
You know, just bang bang

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Yeah, I seem to remember that whole

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Supreme Court decision thing

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
I think the justice knew what Mortal Kombat was

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Because he or she

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
I don't remember which justice it was

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Had interns or people

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
In the office that knew the game and played it a lot

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
So, I remember

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
I just remember that that was

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
I don't have the story in front of me so I don't remember the details

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
I remember that was something out of it that I found fascinating

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
It's like, hey, the Supreme Court knows Mortal Kombat

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
It's not just a niche thing

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
Dan's old boss named his daughter

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
Melina

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
Because his wife wouldn't let him name her Katana

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
This is corporate boss

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
I like the name Melina a lot

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Not even just because of Mortal Kombat

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
I actually met the guy, he's pretty cool

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
But still, you know

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Robin Williams named his daughter Zelda

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
True

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
So

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Moving on, and sorry Russell

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
You'd see the rest of the email was just way too long

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
But I did glance over it

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
This comes from

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Nark

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Which was a great 90's arcade

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
90's arcade game by the way

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
But this is with a Q and not with a C

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Oh, you're like Joystick

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
The AOL block

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Well, I'm weighing in a little late on the matter

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
But I believe there is an overarching theme

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
That connects the defining game

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
With the defining news for the past generation

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
That is online everything

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Someone mentioned crowdfunding

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
And an ME3 multiplayer

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
It hasn't been that long

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Since well launched

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
Now there are so many MMOs

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
That once had spins

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Although Ragnarok Online was the best of them

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
And now you have MMOs being funded

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
Produced by the community

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
Star Citizen doesn't even exist

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
And the players are already pumped for over

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
Already pumped over 25 million dollars

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Into it

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
And that's not the news story of the generation

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
And if that's not, I can't read today

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
If that's not the news story of the generation

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
I don't know what would be more poignant

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
So online everything

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
But if I had to narrow it down

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
World of Warcraft is the defining game of our generation

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Like the game or not

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
And even the Star Citizen crowdfunding

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
Story is this generation's defining news event

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Great topic, game on

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
Nark

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
I'm thinking of Pinky

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
From Pinky and the Brain

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
Instead of Nark

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Here's the one reason

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
I respectfully disagree with your choice

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
Of World of Warcraft is because the game

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Came out in 2004

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Was it 2003? 2004? I think it was 2004

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
During the last generation

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
Because this generation didn't really start till

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
2005-06 depending on

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
You know, if PS3 or 360 kicked it off

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
So that's my one

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Slight

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Dispute with that, but otherwise

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
Honestly, I'm not invalidating any of your points

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
Because the rest of it's all very good

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
And you know, with the Kickstarter

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
And all that, absolutely

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
And Gene says, he's naming his first child

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
Baraka

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Which is better, Baraka or Blanca?

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
Food for thought

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
If you want your kid going around being named white

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
No with a K

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
Wasn't that uh

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
Yeah, but still

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
Hello peoples

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
I'd like to extend my gratitude for Loki

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
For the VoG Grand Theft Auto online community event

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
That was held tonight, Friday night

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
I'm sure it was a good time for those of you

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
Who could stay connected to the game

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
Unfortunately, I could not

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
The reason for this lies not with Rockstar Games

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Anyone I was attempting to play with

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
The reason I couldn't stay connected is due to my

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
So-called broadband

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
Uh

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
DS fucking L

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Okay, oh never mind

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
DS fucking L

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
My failed attempts to play Grand Theft Auto online

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
With the VoG community has only given me more

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Incentive to achieve my long-held goal

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
I will accomplish project buy a house

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
And when I do, I will get

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
Cable internet, string cat5

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
Throughout my house, and finally achieve the true

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Broadband gaming dream

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
I have only dreamed of

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
I will do this, I will stay

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Blackwatertainment trainer

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
You know what

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Um, you also want to look into your router

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
If you're going to do the ultimate

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Uh

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
The ultimate uh

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Wi-Fi or

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Internet experience

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Don't use whatever your

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Provider gives you

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
Goodbye your own

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
It's also partially, I think, Rockstar as well

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
I had trouble connecting it

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
Some of the times I was getting disconnected from stuff

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
I blame everything on

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
Rockstars because they make me too jittery

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
Anyway, um

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
This one, uh, here is

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
An update for OLR

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
It's been six months since my wife Tracy

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
Passed away from a stroke at 47

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
Uh, when I called in

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
I was being- Oh, I remember this one

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
Yes, when I called in I was being

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Evicted from the house I was renting and had to

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Move in with a friend, the sad part is

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
That re-

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Is that really happened and I thought I was

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
Going to have to get a second job just to survive

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
I was getting depressed but was surviving

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
I still listen to the podcast regularly for

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
A smile, I got more

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
From the retirement system she was in than I figured

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Being a responsible adult

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Bites, I could have flown to Vegas and partied

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
I paid off my SUV five years early

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
And now I have no car payment, I paid off the bills

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Left over from the last place, I bought

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
Myself a new 55

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Inch 3D TV, I will be getting

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
An Xbox One and I

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
Find one and a new

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
No, when I find one and a new laptop

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
For gaming, thank you for all your prayers

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
It looks like I will be okay, I would call in

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
But I am East Coast and work Monday

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
I'm happy

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
To hear that follow up, those of you that were here

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Six months ago I'm sure remember that was

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
I think in the 12 years that we've been doing OLR

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
It was the hardest phone call we've ever taken on the show

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
Yeah, I'm just gonna guess on a

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Nickname that's a name in lights

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
I believe that's right

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
He's a really good guy

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
We chat on Facebook all the damn time

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Yeah, he used to do wow with us too

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:45.000
So that whole thing though was really a testament to the power of community

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:53.000
Yeah, I get warm fuzzies hearing that it's gonna be okay for him

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:56.000
And I'm glad to hear it's gonna be okay

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
And I'm sure the listeners appreciate it

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Even if it's six months later it's really nice to know

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
Thank you

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Stay in touch

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
One more email

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Howdy guys and gal, smile

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Yes, thank you for acknowledging my womanhood

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:15.000
Nice tits

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:18.000
I was acknowledging your womanhood

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Yes, they are quite nice

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
I have a gorgeous rack

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
I get complimented on it daily

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Firstly, although we missed you last week

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
I hope you all had a fantastic week off

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
I did sleeping so that was great

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
I went to Disneyland and BlizzCon

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
It was amazing

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Okay, now that we have the touchy feely bullshit out of the way

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Oh hey

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
A couple weeks ago I was watching Under Sedation Live

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Which you can view and participate live every Saturday night

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:46.000
At 10pm EST on vognetwork.com

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
Are you on Travis Donovan's payroll?

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Are you on his payroll?

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
Who is this?

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Are you on Travis' payroll?

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
Did he offer you vog points?

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
Travis and Jessica were talking about cult movies

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Of the 90's, Boondock Saints, Cutthroat Island and Hackers

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:05.000
This conversation got me to thinking of cult video games

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
And what makes a cult game

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Is a cult game a game that people enjoy

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
Despite the low review scores like Too Human?

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:14.000
Is a cult game a game that did not have a stellar launch

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:17.000
But managed to gain a huge following such as Demon's Souls?

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
Is a cult game a game that people like to play

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:22.000
Despite the low sales numbers such as Bulletstorm and Shadows of the Damned?

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:27.000
And I'm eager to find out what you consider a cult game

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:30.000
I'm also interested in finding out what your favorite cult game is

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
Not so sincerely, Degenerate Johnny

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
AKA Rob's Parody Songwriter

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Thanks

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
Thank you for not bringing that to this show

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
That's a really good question

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:44.000
And for the record, even though Travis gives me shit all the time on Under Sedation Live

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
You really all should check out that show

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
They have a lot of fun over there

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:51.000
It's a bummer though y'all missed episode 6-66

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:55.000
Because I live for DJ Satan who was on that show

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
Anyway, sorry

02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:01.000
But I just wanted to go ahead and let that plug air a little bit

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
As far as the question on hand

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
What makes a cult video game?

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:08.000
Degenerate Johnny, I think it's kind of all those things that you named

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
I don't think, there's no definition

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:13.000
You don't go to the dictionary and see what makes a cult game

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
I think it's a little bit of all those things

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
And I think the definition is a little different for everybody

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
Well that and also when you have

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:22.000
I think you should also look at the factor of

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:25.000
Well this is more like hipster game I would think

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:30.000
When you have people outside of an age group the game is intended for

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
Playing the game

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
Like, I hate to say it

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Pokemon

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
Pokemon's totally a cult game

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:42.000
But does that label really fit when Pokemon is like a hugely selling game

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:45.000
See that's why I relabeled it a hipster game

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
Definitely a cult of Pokemon

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
I was going to say one of the biggest cult games there is is World of Warcraft

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:53.000
Yeah, but now it's doing well

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
It's such a huge game

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
I feel weird calling that a cult game too

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
This is how I look at it too

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:02.000
Maybe when you have something's popularity

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:05.000
Emerge after it was supposed to have its heyday

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
For example, look at Rocky

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Rocky Horror Picture Show

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Yeah, the play was pretty good

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
And had pretty decent following when the movie came out

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
Didn't it tank?

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Yes, the movie originally tanked

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
It was based on a play

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
But the movie originally tanked

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
Which I've seen the play finally

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
They noticed that in New York or somewhere

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
A lot of the same people were going to see it over and over again

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
And they started doing the midnight showing

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:33.000
And the minute that somebody yelled

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
Buy an umbrella you cheap bitch

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
At the screen, things changed forever

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
Well yeah, but I mean that's the thing that you have

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Popularity is of a different sort

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Than what was intended when the movie came out

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Correct?

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
So I think that if you look at

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
For example

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Portal, okay

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:56.000
I think Portal was just sort of a throw in kind of game

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:59.000
It was meant to be a fun little puzzler

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
But it's the whole

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:04.000
Quirkiness of it that really got it a huge following

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
And maybe got people

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Got people moving outside of whatever was written in the game

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Into the retarded vant-

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
I hate using that word, why am I saying it?

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
Into the crazy-

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
Leo-tarded

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Leo-tarded

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
That's what they say on Drag Race, totally Leo-tarded

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:26.000
But I hate using that word because I do know people who

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Anyway

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
Sorry

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
Oh yeah, and if you want to go for

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
Like Jean just said, Shock Treatment, Ultra Cult

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
Oh my god, Shock Treatment

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Shock Treatment's fucking hilarious

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
You have to watch Shock Treatment like seven times before it even makes sense

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
But the music is really good

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
I need a bit of ooh

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
Shock Treatment

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
You remember when we ate the hacker cookies

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
When Evan lived with Jessica

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:54.000
And these were cookies that were made with so much chocolate and no doughs

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
That I was shaking after two of them

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
I remember when I got really sick

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
In 2008

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
I was actually supposed to be in a shadow cast

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
Of Shock Treatment playing Ricky from the Rest Home

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
I had to drop out because

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
That was the year I got really sick and I had to go to the hospital

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
So somebody replaced me

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
But anyway

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Well, SSJ100Matt is saying that Darkstalkers is a cult franchise

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
But- Kinda

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
Yeah, kinda, it wasn't as

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Overly successful as most of Capcom's other things

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
But see, it was always in the circles

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
I lived in arcades with fighting games

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
So they always had people on it

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
I think a cult game is that game

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
Is that game that everybody

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
Asks for a sequel for

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
That you're never gonna get

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
Like Shenmue is a great example of a cult game

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
Like Half Life

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
Half Life by that definition

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Is definitely a cult game

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
Or I was gonna joke Mega Man is now a cult game

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
As of recent

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
You know what a good example though of the

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
I think

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Blaster Master is a great example of a cult game

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Yes, it got some sequels

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
But they were worse than Shock Treatment

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Let's be real

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
It's hard to be worse unless you're Yaris

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
What if Yaris got a sequel?

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
The Wii remake wasn't awful

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
But that's not saying much

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
I'll give you another example of a great cult game

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Because I don't think people know this one

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Very well, Cultcept

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
Talked about this in the game before

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
It's that whole like Magic the Gathering meets Monopoly

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
I love that game

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
But there's like one on the 360

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
And on the Playstation 2 and that's really it

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
I think it's bigger in Japan

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
There's a lot of points in the chat

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Rama brings up Rival Schools

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
Being more than Darkstalkers

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Which I fully agree with

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
And I fucking love Rival Schools

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
And the people who love Rival Schools

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
Really fucking love Rival Schools

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
And Jean says PSO2 in the US

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Which I was totally into PSO2 for a little while

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
And then there's Final Fantasy

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
And Queen Samia says

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Any Bimani game

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
In America, yes

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
I would say

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
VR got super super popular

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
And now it's fallen into

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Because of the cult status the imports had over here

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
Now it's more in the mainstream

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
But as far as I was aware

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
In Japan, popin' music is everywhere

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
And everyone fucking plays popin' music

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
I love this

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
Technus says those Burger King games

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
Yeah, those

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
Sneak King was a cult game of sorts

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
Or fuck, everyone I knew that played Ragnarok online

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Because that game was like

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
Oh, we have 3D games

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
No, fuck you, we're playing our 2D little MMO

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
SSG100Matt says

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
So Chrono Trigger would be considered cult

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
No, because you got Chrono Cross

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
I'm just trollin'

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Chrono Trigger was pretty popular

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
It is a cult game of sorts

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Rageinator says Earthbound

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Kinda, yeah

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Kid Icarus for a long time

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
I would definitely call it a cult game

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
In fact, in some ways it still is

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
I would not consider that one a cult

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Um

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Pig bumpin'

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
We had that

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
Because the Parappa series

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
For what it was

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
It took off, I think, bigger

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
In a way than it was supposed to

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
And then Umjramalami

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
And Parappa 2, those are sequels

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
So I'm not gonna really count them as much

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
Now I will agree with Skullgirls

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
Because that game is

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
Pretty fun

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
It wasn't getting a whole lot of attention

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
But you have your dedicated

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Fan base to it

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
And because of that, we've had the Kickstarter go in

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
A lot more of that too

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
So yeah, Skullgirls is a pretty recent one

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
Or maybe even La Mulana

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
You know

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
La Mulana is definitely a cult game

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
If your name is Dark Tetsuya

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Cave Story

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
Ooh, that's a good one too

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
This is a great topic, but we are dragging it out

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Yeah, it's time to move it on

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
But great question, love it

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Yeah, and we definitely

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:53.000
Sort of discussed a little bit of what defines a cult game

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
And Travis will now be able to say

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
Yet again, they jacked another segment for my show

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
And you know what I say?

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
Nothing, because it's a gesture

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
And just remember, that saying

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
Love you, just a really strong love you

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
Love it

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
It's a very deep kind of love

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
It's a very thrusty, deep kind of love

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
Alright

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
Speaking of thrusty, deep kind of love

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
Thank you to all you guys that emailed us tonight

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
And those of you that will email next week

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
In advance, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
Is the place to send those emails

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Well, right along with that gesture

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
We'll cue a new segment

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
Or not a new segment, a new segment?

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
We need a new segment

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
It's a brand new segment here on the show

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
We've been doing it since episode one

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
We're growing segments like bugs

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
You wanna get a new segment on the show?

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
We should get a new segment for OLR

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
What should the new OLR segment be?

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
Tweet us ideas

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
We'll crowdsource this

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
The OLR shit list

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
New OLR segment

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
Tweet us your ideas

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
And I'm not bringing you back website of the week

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
But, if we get a new segment

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
Then an old segment's gotta go

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
No

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
We'll just live here forever

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
I'm just gonna live under your table here

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
And eventually Sanrio will like me

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Fuck you to me

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
Not having a job yet

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
And I'm still waiting back to hear

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
From Cool Job

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
As I've been referring to it

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
In writing Cool Job with a trademark

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
Um

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
It's really just very difficult

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
To find work

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
And, you know, Dan and I

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
Are actually gonna be going out looking at houses next week

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Cause

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
We feel we're wasting money on rent

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
And trying to

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
You know, it's really hard

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
To improve your situation when you are not

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
Given the means to improve your situation

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
And all those people who are

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Bootstrap theorists

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
Fuck you very much

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
Fuck you

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
Loki?

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
Fuck you to Cookie Clicker

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
I agree, fuck you to Cookie Clicker

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
Do you have a permanent dent in your finger now?

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
Uh, no, but I'm almost done

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
Seriously, I'm almost done

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Cosdula has somehow arisen

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
I don't know how this has happened

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
But

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
It's part of the game, I guess

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
But he's in the devil

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Grandmas turn evil

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
Have to do an ancient practice

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
To stop them from being evil

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
Um

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
And I'm cheating, a lot

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
Of course you're cheating, this is Loki we're talking about

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
It's to get done with the game, it's all about the end game

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
You know?

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
Alright, uh, my FU of the week

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Um, I guess I don't have a lot I'm mad at

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
My FU of the week goes to these holiday candies

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
But

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
And, it's, Alan says they're grandma candy

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
And they totally are

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
It's like the mix, the holiday mix

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
Of those hard candies

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
That grandma always had in a glass jar

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
At her house

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
Kinda, but they're not like

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
Butterscotch or anything

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Everybody knows, you've seen these, they all clunk

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Together too, like the hard candies

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
These things are so addicting, I eat them and I've almost

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
Eaten like an entire bag

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
And I wonder why I can't lose weight

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
So FU to

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
Candy for being delicious

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
Bob, you suck

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
What? You can do anything

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
You put your mind to

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
Okay, I wanna be a princess

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
I'm thinking really hard

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
It's not working, Dark Sakura

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
I'm taking this home

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
Are you compensating it?

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
It looks nasty

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
It's really good though

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
It's just that candy pink in it

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
You know? Uh, Codeman in chat says

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
So I come to your house, you will offer me candy

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
Absolutely, if you're gonna make the trip out here

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
From Oklahoma or wherever you are

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
I will absolutely get you candy

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
He only uses it to get people in his car

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Not his house, in the van

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
You don't have a van yet

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
That's what you think

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
Can I have a bite?

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
That's the perfect alibi right there too

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
I don't have a van, what are you talking about?

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
Alright, that does it for the FUs of the Week

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Let's get to some more stories and then

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
We are not that far away from the Skype line

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
I'm excited to talk to some folks tonight

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
I hope we get calls tonight

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
1877 Game OLR

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Or I use the name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
But first, a couple stories for you

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Sadly we missed a wonderful transition that we would have had

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Had we gone into the story straight from the mailbag

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
But, you know, whatever

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
So hey, in case you need some more information

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
About which system you should buy

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
For the next generation

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Pornhub would let you know

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
That hey, they're fully supporting

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
The Playstation 4

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
And you'll be able to view Pornhub

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
And all of its video content

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Through the Playstation 4's web browser

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Nice

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
So that's why I was joking

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
Does Pornhub offer the freaky porn though?

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
I only like the really crazy stuff

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
I will never forget that New Years

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
It was like 2007 or something

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
With the pterodactyl porn on the Wii

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
That was the most hilarious thing I've ever seen in my life

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
That is a good question

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
One that we should just look up the answer to

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Why not?

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
You have to do some research here

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
It's, you know, it's strange

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
But let's see

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
Dinosaur

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Hey, that's weird that that came up as a recommended

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
Yes, it has dinosaur porn on there

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
So you are all set

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Dinosaurs? Like the old ABC sitcom?

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
Dinosaurs as in like CG dinosaurs

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
And they even

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
And

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
And someone that's dressed in green

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
I don't know

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
But yes, they do have dinosaur

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
Pornography

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
You'll be happy to know

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
Alright, anyway

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Very happy to hear that

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Congratulations Playstation 4 for

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
Definitively winning the console wars with that

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
Although, we all know

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
If there's any way to do it

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Pornhub will also show up on Xbox One

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Of course, well it is Internet Explorer

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
It'll have to happen

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
But here's the thing

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
I always bring triple X rated

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Video

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
To the actual web stores

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Like I can go rent a copy of

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
You know, the Dark Knight

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
Returns or

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
The Dark Knight bones some chick

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
In the ass too

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
You know, that's

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
That's how you win the console wars right there

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
Alright, speaking of vulgarities

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Did you know that South Park

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
Is still on the air? It's in its 17th

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Season

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
South Park is kind of hit and miss these days

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
It's still worth watching once in a while

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
Especially this past week

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
And I actually watched this episode

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
A friend of mine alerted me to the fact that

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
The latest South Park episode was about the

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
Playstation 4 and Xbox One

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Console wars

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
They kind of put a Game of Thrones parody into it too

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
It also looks very much like

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
It does

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Look like their game which made it funny

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Because there was a part where they totally

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Shade the fact that their game got delayed

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
Like something about

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
Someone says, who wants to sit around and wait for a stupid

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
Game, a game that's not even that good

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Oh, then they slam the pre-order

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
Thing, that's what it was, they say like

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
You know, pre-orders are just

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
The way of them dicking you over every time

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
Like they go

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
The five dollars you spend on a pre-order

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
Is just going to some guy who hasn't even

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Finished the game yet and da da da, like that was the

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
Part, I'm totally not doing it justice

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
Sorry, I don't have it queued up right now

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
But it was worth watching

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
I lulled a couple times

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
I think it's going to be a two-parter

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
Because it didn't really, the ending wasn't really

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
An ending, so

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
It makes sense because they have both consoles coming out

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
Yeah, I'm curious to see if maybe they're going to end it after the

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
Consoles actually come out, I don't know

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
Yes, they actually

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Split up and choose a side and it's

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Going to be Playstation 4 fans

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Versus Xbox One fans

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
And an epic throw down at the mall

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
And they're actually recruiting other clicks for their side

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Like I think the Sony click had

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
Kyle in it

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
And they recruited the Goth kids

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
I thought they were trying to recruit them

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
But it didn't work, I don't know

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
I don't know, this is way

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Too much seriousness for an episode of South Park

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
But it's always fun to see

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
This whole stuff get kind of made fun of

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
In the media, who better to make fun of it

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
Than South Park

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
By the way, if you do want to watch the whole episode

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
And actually get the quote that I butchered

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
South Park Studios

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
Has the full episode

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
And Dark Tetsuya in our chat room

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
Says they did confirm on Facebook

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Part 2 is this coming week

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
So there will be a

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Part 2, so check that out

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
Jean asks, was Wii U ignored?

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
Of course, of course it was ignored

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
Just like real life

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
This is next gen wars

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Well

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Maybe that'll be the twist in the second part

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Is that they all come together and buy Wii Us

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
I doubt it

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
I highly doubt it

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
I don't think so

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
Alright

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
That's it for stories

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
So I think we can open up the Skype line now

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
1877 Game OLR

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
Or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
If you'd like to give us a call on Skype

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
The Skype line is open

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
And in the meantime

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
We can go to some Twitter topics

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
I know we had a few good ones tonight

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
Also, last minute stories

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
Loki, I don't know if you had any last minute stories

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
No

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
I was gonna mention that there's this teaser site

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Now it's the Survivor

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
2299

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
That people are thinking might be for Fallout

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
Originally it was thought

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
Oh, maybe it's a fan site because it wasn't registered

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
To the usual Bethesda stuff

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
However, Bethesda

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
Just recently trademarked

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Fallout 4

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
And also the timing kinda

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
Coincides with the Spike

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
VGX stuff

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
Oh lordy

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
Expect an announcement maybe in December

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
Most likely, let's go to the phones

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
They're lighting up now, we shouldn't have a problem with calls tonight

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
This is Codeman

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
Hey Codeman, how you doing? What's up?

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
Not much, I got some candy here waiting for you

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
I learned that you like

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
Freaky porn on this episode

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
That was kinda weird

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
Freaky porn makes it sound like

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
I'm like this lecherous creepy

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
dude that lives in a basement

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
There's a tonki punch video where they actually dress up

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
Like a donkey, that's funny

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
I like funny porn, Codeman

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
My favorite are the parodies

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
Have you seen the Batman ones?

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
The Batman ones are great because

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
They do it sort of the old

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
Adam West style Batman

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
But it's with the actual

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
characters from now on

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
I think the last one I saw was a parody of Lord of the Rings

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
It literally had a bunch of midgets

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
I remember when you invited me over

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
To see Ali McFeel

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
Ron Jeremy was actually in that

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
And for the record

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
The last one I watched was the Mork and Mindy one

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:06.000
I wanted to see the one that was called

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
This Ain't Glee

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
Because now they don't even bother

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
They just say, this ain't whatever

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
Oh wait, I did see another one

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
More recent, I saw Nalen Palin

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
Which is hilarious

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
I know you must have seen

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
Not the Cosby's because we were so fascinated

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
We were so fascinated by the guy

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
The guy that played Bill Cosby

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
In there

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
He never got into any of the scenes

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
But his impression was fantastic

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
And that was the part

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
It was like, we don't give a shit about the porn

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
His impression was just dead on

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
It was hilarious

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
Codeman, I don't know if you actually called to talk about porn

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
But clearly we could do that all night

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
But what's on your mind, buddy?

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
It's all porn and orange lounge radio tonight

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
Orange lounge radio?

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
No, I haven't called in a while

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
I haven't called in a while actually

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
I've been pretty busy with life

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
I guess you could say

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
But no, I just figured I was up tonight

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
And figured I'd call in and just talk

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
PS4, because I

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
I cancelled my pre-order like you did, Rob

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
I'm glad I'm not alone

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
Would you give out your Twitter on the show

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
So that the people that are about to

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
Send me angry tweets after tonight's episode

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
Can send them to you too?

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Yeah, it's Codeman Games

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
Look it up

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
But I will tell you

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
Xtifer

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
I've been keeping up with his

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
He posted, I think, a RezaGun

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
On Facebook

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
And I'm just like

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
I'm seeing all these videos and I'm like

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
God

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
I should have kept it

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
That's the exact same thing I've been doing

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
And you know what that means

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
All that social media shit that Sony

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
Infused into its console is working

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
This is exactly what they want people to do

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
Actually, for me, it's the opposite

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
Another video of the stupid robot

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
I've already seen that

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
I know what it looks like

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
Well, it's just

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
You see all this stuff and you

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
Cancel it because you know, okay

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
I kind of go with the same thing

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
A console is good at what

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
Games are on them

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
But then you see all these people playing it

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
And you just get this feeling of

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
God, I need this because it's new

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
It's different

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
In a sense, and so you get to this point where you're like

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
Oh my God, I just need this console

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
But you know you have other

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
Things to do and you can't spend that much money

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
On something, but you're just like, oh my God

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
I need it, but at the time, I had the money

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
And I was like, okay, well I have the

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
Pre-order, I'm going to get it and all this stuff

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
And I got to the point where I was just like

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
You know what, there's just no games that are selling

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
The system for me right now

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
About the only thing that was

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
Selling was the RezaGun

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
I wanted to check out

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
What was the

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
What was the little

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
With the little guys

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
And the

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
Playroom? No, not the Playroom

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
It starts with a K

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
Knack

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
I wanted to play Knack because I played

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
A demo of it at Target and I thought it was kind of fun

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
I've heard it's kind of repetitive, but at the same time

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
I don't really care

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
I felt fun when I played it

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
And the controller just felt so

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
Amazing when I played it

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
It's like, oh my God, I should have got one of these

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
But I do have to make a confession

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
I did

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Sell my Xbox 360

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
And got like

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Well, and some games and got like

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
300 something dollars for it, so

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
That will be going towards a PS4

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
So I probably will be getting one

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
How about the old and the new and the new?

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
I got some extra systems at my

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
Office that I'm not using, I might as well

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
Just take those in

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
You know, I'm not a big advocate

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
Of the evil G, but today they had

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
A 90% trade-in

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
Value on console, so I was just like

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
Oh wow, why not?

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Oh dang, I wish I had known that

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
I might have done that

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
Alan and I actually have two

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
Because, you know, when we got together and moved in

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
Together, we both had 360s and PlayStation 3s

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
So we have two PlayStation 3s and two

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
Xbox 360s and there's really no reason for us

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
To do that, so we really should sell my

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
Systems because they're the older ones

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
And keep Alan's

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
Oh well, maybe they'll do something like that again

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
Although yes, I'm with you, I really don't like

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
The evil G, but if they're willing to give me a lot of money

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
I can cross picket lines

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
We've got extra

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
Systems lying around

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
Why not?

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
And also, lastly, before I go

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
I wanted to tell you guys about a game I've been

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
Playing that I think kind of fell under

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
The radar a little bit because I don't think

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
A lot of people play this game anymore, but maybe

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
They do, I don't know, but the Ratchet and Clank

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
The new Ratchet and Clank game that just came out

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
It's like super fun

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
It's the first full length type

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
I guess Ratchet and Clank that they released

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
Because they released the All For One

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
Which is like the multiplayer, which kind of

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
Wasn't that good, and then they released

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
A full frontal assault

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
Which was the

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
It was like a tower defense Ratchet and Clank

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
But this one that they just released

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
Into the Nexus was fantastic

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
And I'm playing it right now

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
And I actually, with the game

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
Got a

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
A code for a downloadable

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
Game for the Quest for Booty game

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
Which was like the first downloadable

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Game that they released or whatever

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
And I'm willing to give it to

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
Somebody in chat if they want it because

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
I already own it

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
But I have a free

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
Code here, so if anybody in chat likes

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
The Ratchet and Clank games and they

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Don't own this game

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
It's really fun, it was a full length downloadable

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Ratchet and Clank game, it's all like pirate themed

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
And stuff, so

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
So if you, anybody

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
The first person to

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
Direct message me in chat

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
Maybe, I want it, I wish you told me

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
I want it, no it's fine, give it to a listener

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
Do you want it Rob?

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
Of course, no no, give it to a listener, I have so many games to play

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
I'll never get around to it, give it to a listener

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
Who will actually play it

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
Alright cool, and welcome back guys

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
After a week of being off

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
Thank you, appreciate it

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
One more thing I just want to leave you with is that

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
You're not the first to talk about porn here on Orange

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
Radio, you need to go back in the archives

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
On the OL archive or whatever

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
And find the episode where we did review

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
And we watched live on air

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Because our show was a lot different back in the early days

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
We actually watched live on air

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
Final Fuck X, which I still have

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
Somewhere, and Dance Dance

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
Fuck

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
Where some Japanese

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
Where some Japanese porn we

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
Watched, and for the record

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
All Final Fuck X's is

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
Really good cosplay with fucking

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
I remember I was looking for Dance Dance Revolution

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
Like stuff, like games on eBay

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
And I'm like, hey what's this?

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
I gotta buy that

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
Dance Dance Fuck has nothing to do with the games

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
So it just, which was hilarious

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
So, anyway

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
I'm just gonna have to channel my inner Shane on this one

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
And go, I don't care

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
Alright, well said

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
Alright, take care buddy

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
Alright Rob, everybody

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
Thanks for the call

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
I will talk to y'all later

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
Alright, that was a good call

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
Is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
I wanna do some quick Twitter topics while we wait for another call

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
Tigerclaw tweets us

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
And says, Mortal Kombat producer

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
Hector Sanchez leaves NetherRealm Studios

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
That's right, I did see this

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
Coming out today

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
That one of the guys over there at NetherRealm did leave the company

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
As of I think yesterday

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
Was his departure, no word yet where he

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
Went, but obviously he was a big

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
Part of not only the new Mortal Kombat

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
But Injustice, so

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
Very interesting to see him

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
Take another job somewhere

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
So let's go to the phones and go to another call

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
Hi, this is Def

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
I see your picture has changed

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
It's a little, is that your new Wii U?

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
It's a Kirby

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
Yeah, it's the screen of my Wii U

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
It's actually a video

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
Of it

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
Oh, it's live video

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Oh, no wonder I hear myself echoing a little bit

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
Oh yeah, I can see the pixels

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
Oh, there it goes

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
Alright, it is live video

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
Nice, love that

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
Even though I'm hearing myself echo

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
But that's okay, what's on your mind buddy?

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
Basically

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
Sorry

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
I was gonna talk about

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
Basically

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
Or ask you

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
Why do people still

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
Say that Nintendo is gonna

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
Be in ruins

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
I don't know

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
Lucky, why do people say

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
Nintendo is gonna be in ruins

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
It's doom and gloom, doom and gloom

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
It's just because the Wii U is not selling well

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
So they assume that because the Wii U is not selling well

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
That Nintendo doesn't have anything else

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
That they're selling that's not doing well

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
Except

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
They have this thing called the 3DS

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
That seems to sell like crazy

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
I don't know, I don't think they're in ruins

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
But as far as getting the platform

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
Of Wii U

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
Ehhhh, that's not

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
Doing so hot

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
That's about it

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
And actually right now they don't really have any

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
EA games

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
At all, and there's nothing on the slate for next year

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
So that's gonna hurt

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
Well to paraphrase something

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
That someone very aptly put on

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
The tumblers

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
The Virtual Boy

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
Didn't tank it

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
The Micro didn't tank it

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
The 64DD didn't tank it

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
So

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
They're just not going to

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
Recapture what

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Happened with the Wii

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
I think the Wii set the bar so high

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
It was such a successful console

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
That expectations are very high

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
Is the Wii U going to win

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
This generation?

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
Not likely, but never say never

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
I mean, I think we also have to remember

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
In the last generation

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
PlayStation 3 didn't come out the gate too hot

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
And PlayStation 3 took a while

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
To turn around

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
PlayStation 3 took a good two years

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
And when did Little Big Planet

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
Come out? Because that's when things really started

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
Turning around for PlayStation 3

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
That was almost two years into it, right?

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
I think it was 2007, so it was a year after it came out

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
I think it's still just

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
A little too soon to write off

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
Nintendo completely

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
Are they having a bad day?

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
Absolutely. Are they done?

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
I don't think so. Are they going to be number one?

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
Probably not

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
I think it's going to be a little more even

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
Steven across all three of them this time

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
Because let's be real, last generation

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
Nintendo blew the other two out of the water

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
Whether you like it or not

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
This time I don't think it's going to be

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
I think Nintendo may actually be the one that lags behind a little bit

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
But we'll see

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
Xbox One's out next week

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
We've got to see where things are at six months out

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
We'll see

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
But it's not over for Nintendo

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
3DS will always keep them afloat

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
And whatever else they've got up their sleeve

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
It's going to be a Wii U next year

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
It's going to sell systems

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
Along with Super Smash Brothers

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
Just wait

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
But what about you Actif?

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
You just bought a Wii U

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
So what finally made you decide to take the plunge?

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
Basically

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
First of all, Super Mario 3D World

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
It's

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
Seeing the videos

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
Over and over again

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
It looks like it's going to be a pretty fun game to play

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
And I really

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
Wanted to play it

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
As soon as it comes out

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
So

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
I pretty much wanted that

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
And also

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
I topped this with Bobby

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
Rayman Legends

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
Even though it's a multi-platform

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
Game

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
I still want it on the Wii U

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
And it's even on sale right now

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
On Steam for 20 bucks

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
I want to purchase that

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
But now that I have the Wii U

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
I really

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
Want to get it for this console

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
So yeah

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
Basically those are my two main reasons right now

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
To get one

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
And even then

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
Something that you said on the beginning of the show

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
It's like pretty much

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
Right now Wii U

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
Has the games

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
Has at least

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
More games to play

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
Right now

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
Since it has

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
The

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
Year

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
Since it launched

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
So yeah

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
It already has

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
A big library so it

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
Doesn't have that many games

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
Maybe to play but

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
At least you have more of a selection

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
Right now than the

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
PS4 or even the

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
Xbox One

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
Even though there's not a lot of games on Wii U

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
There will be some really great

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
A-list titles on it

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
That help keep the system afloat

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
Which I'm not sure PS4 or Xbox One

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
Has as much of right now anyway

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
Alright

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
Well Akdef, thanks so much for the call

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
And enjoy your new Wii U, have fun

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
Thanks

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
Alright you're welcome, take care buddy, have a good night

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
See ya

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
1877 Game OLR

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
Or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
If you want to give us a call

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
Guess what, nobody sent

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
CodeMan a direct message for that code

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
So he ended up giving it to me anyway

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
Haha, suckers

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
Alright

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
Let's go to the phones one more time hopefully

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
OrangeLoungeRadio

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
While we wait for a call to come in

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
There's a call coming in right now so let's go to it

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
Hi on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
It's Legend, Zaku here

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
Hey Zaku buddy, how you doing?

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
Long time no see

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
What do you do?

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
Nothing much, just shuffling between

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
Battlefield 4 and GTA 5

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
I love that you're calling in when you're in your

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
camo shirt, I couldn't see you for a minute

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
That's my PJ's

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
What, what's that? Those are my PJ's

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
I was going to say it kind of looked like a PJ top

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
You call in when you're in your camo jammies

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
To talk about Battlefield, so please by all means

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
How is Battlefield?

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
Well I haven't, to be honest I haven't

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
gotten into the multiplayer yet

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
Because I'm still, you know, it's always

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
A thing of mine to always do single player first

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
Then just jump into multiplayer

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
Same thing I did for Battlefield 3

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
But so far

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
I mean, if you want single player

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
It is kind of like very

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
Cinematic

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
But that's all I can say about it other than

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
It looks like it's gonna

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
It looks pretty short than the

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
One for Battlefield 3

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
But I'm hearing a lot of great things about

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
Online, except of course when you

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
Have people

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
Crashing the servers maliciously

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
Like what happened this weekend

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
Yeah I heard about that, what's up with that?

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
Did the DDoS

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
Attacks go against

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
Battlefield 4 today or something?

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
Apparently from what I'm hearing

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
When I'm glancing through Kotaku

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
Right now

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
Yeah they were getting

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
They were basically getting hammered

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
By denial of service, yeah they were getting

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
DDoS'd

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
I guess

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
Now that the PS4 is out

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
This kind of opens the floodgates

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
Since most of the

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
PS4 games will have dedicated servers

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
Whether or not that will actually

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
Translate over to consoles

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
Assuming one can just

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
Slightly sniff

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
Outgoing packets

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
Outgoing network packets

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
To see if they can

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
Find an IP to exploit

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
I mean that's one way to do it

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
You just snip the traffic

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
Between the private dedicated

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
Servers and the console and you might

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
Be able to get some info

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
Assuming it's not encrypted

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
But if it is

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
Then they're still a bit lucky

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
I'm assuming you

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
Did not jump on the PlayStation 4 bandwagon

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
Did you, you've been doing that?

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
Not yet, I still have a PS3 to go over

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
As I said I still have GTA 5

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
That I played yesterday, last night

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
And I've been juggling

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
Battlefield 4 so those are the two things

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
Those two gaming things are going on right now

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
So you're sitting out

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
This new

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
Consoles for a little bit too

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
You're not planning on Xbox One either?

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
Not yet, as I said I'd rather give it

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
At least a couple of years

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
Or until the prices start dropping

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
I mean when I

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
Got my Xbox two years after it came out

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
That was the first

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
The first 360

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
And then after that

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
That one crapped out and then I bought another

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
But yeah, it was

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
I waited at least two years before buying

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
That current generation of

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
Console

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
And PS3 I got last year so

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
Yeah

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
Still juggling, but as I

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
You know, I'd rather, it's not

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
It's not really good to be an early adopter

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
In this stage

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
Especially for a new generation console

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
Because you're pretty much dealt with

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
What you have already and not

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
What improvements Sony

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
Or Microsoft will make on their hardware

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
Yeah, but

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
Other than having to deal with that aftermath initially

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
I'd rather just see how they find

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
How they flesh it out

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
But you can be the cool kid on the block with your cool new toy

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
You're the coolest kid in school

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
Sure

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
That is true, but

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
I know it's $400

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
That I could put to good use

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
You know, like

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
Buying myself a new video card

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
Or basically getting

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
Two terabyte hard drives

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000
I could set up on RAID so I could put all my

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
Steam games and get a lot

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
More of them so I don't max out my current drive

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
Stuff like that, like putting stuff

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000
On my PC

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
As opposed to the PS3 which I still

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
Invest, but it's not as

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
It's not as urgent as

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
Something that's almost like reaching

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
Two years old

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.000
And I still need to get a new video card for it

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000
But other than that

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
I mean, it's not like my

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
My head is Seth Child called the 360

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000
Which I barely put anything

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000
Except for an Xbox Live membership earlier this year

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
And that's it

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.000
Alright

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000
Well, Zaku, we're gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
But have fun with your Battlefield

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
And get in that multiplayer and let us know how it is

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.000
You know, when the servers work

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.000
Maybe you guys do need to

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:02.000
Jump on it

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:04.000
I'm certain there are Battlefield PC players

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
The best argument

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
I heard for playing Battlefield 4

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
And Jamie, you'll appreciate this

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
The best argument I heard for Battlefield 4 and playing it

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
Is it's using the same engine the new Mass Effect

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
Game's gonna be using

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
Of course, it's Frostbite

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.000
And you can actually do

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.000
Countering knife attacks

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
I don't hate shooters

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
I'm so bad at them, Zaku

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:28.000
I am so, so bad

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
Do you want to play with a scrub?

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
Do you want to?

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
I will lower your team's

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.000
Collective performance

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000
Other than that, I barely see VOG network on GTA Online

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:40.000
What's up with that?

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
I don't see many on the PS3

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
I'm on all the time

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.000
Except I'm on two different Sims

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.000
Good day, though

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.000
Can't you hit me up on a social club?

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:52.000
Don't they have messaging systems?

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000
I have it through my phone now

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.000
Because I'm not

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.000
Doing my best to dodge, chop

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:00.000
I put messages on there

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000
Are you friended on

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.000
PlayStation Network with me?

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
It's there

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
My profile should have my PSN ID

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
I'll even post it up right now

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
After this call

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
But yeah

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
Hopefully

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
OLR can get a VOG network

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
Group on Origin for Battlefield

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
3 and or 4

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
Yeah

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
That requires me to install Origin

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
It's not that bad

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
Oh my god

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
I basically bit the bullet and did that

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000
Alright, Zaku

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000
I gotta wrap up

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:40.000
We're running long

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:42.000
Have a good one, buddy

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:44.000
Thanks for the call

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000
I love it when we get the webcam calls

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000
It's always good to be able to see our people

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
I should probably put a webcam on the computer

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:52.000
Just for Skype

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.000
So that way when they call in

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:56.000
I can remember the one I've been using

02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:58.000
For my drawing

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:00.000
It's more incentive for people to call

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.000
Microsoft would like to let you know

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.000
That you can get your free Skype camera

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.000
With the purchase of an Xbox One

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:08.000
In the form of a Kinect

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.000
I am so sorry, the phones are still lighting up

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.000
I've gotta wrap up because we're running long

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:14.000
We're 15 minutes past midnight on the East Coast

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:16.000
I still have some Twitter topics

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:18.000
So one of these is a really good question I want to get to

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:20.000
So please, please tweet, email

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:22.000
And we'll get to you guys in a later week, hopefully

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:24.000
I want to get this tweet from

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:26.000
ActDeaf who sent us a tweet

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:28.000
This is something I totally missed from the Nintendo Direct

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000
I'm so sorry

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.000
I get Kirby, how very dare I

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000
I'm mad at myself, y'all

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.000
Kirby Triple Deluxe

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.000
Will be coming out in Japan on

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:40.000
January 11th

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000
And there's a teaser site for that

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:44.000
Kirby Triple Deluxe

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:46.000
Get it? Kirby 3D

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:48.000
Get it?

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000
Oh my gosh

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000
Alright

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:54.000
And one other question here

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000
That I really like this

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.000
This is from AJ Twist

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.000
So, in O.L.R.'s opinion

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.000
Who won

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
The last gen

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.000
Console Wars?

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:08.000
Dreamcast

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.000
The dramas are still not over

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000
So, I mean, it's still going

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.000
It's still going?

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.000
Alright

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000
Define when, do you mean by sales

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:20.000
Do you mean by units

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:22.000
Specifically sold, do you mean

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
By what country, do you mean by

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000
Gallup poll, I don't know

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
I think the question is vague on purpose

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000
It's his opinion, in your opinion

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000
Who won

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
My 3DS

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.000
The 3DS won the last console

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.000
I think that's a perfectly valid answer

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.000
See, that's a console, not a handheld

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:42.000
Ah, alright

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:44.000
You know what I think won?

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000
My computer, the end

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:48.000
PC's

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.000
PC's won

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.000
You know what, there's a lot of people

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.000
There would be a lot of people in that camp

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000
It would be a home run with the Ouya

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.000
I mean, the Ouya won the last gen console wars

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.000
There's just no doubt about it

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.000
No

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000
Loki, who won?

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:06.000
Who won?

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000
Probably Xbox, just because they had

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.000
A lot of units out there

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000
They still have the strongest support, I think

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000
From all third parties

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:16.000
I mean, it's still going strong

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:18.000
The Wii's gone

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.000
I mean, the support for Wii U

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:22.000
Is gone, and now it's Wii U

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.000
So, they're in their own

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.000
Gen, I guess

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:28.000
It's the way they want to classify themselves because they can't compete

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:30.000
With the Wii U now

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000
So, I think Xbox, but

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.000
I mean, PlayStation 3 did turn it around

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.000
And now they're selling

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000
Quite heavily, so that's

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.000
Pretty neck and neck, I mean, it's not like

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000
One clear winner

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.000
I think, it depends on your criteria

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.000
I think, for me

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000
If you're going by sales, specifically

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:50.000
Nintendo won, clearly

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.000
Like it or not, love or hate what they brought to the table

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:54.000
Just speaking by the numbers

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.000
And no, that's not me being a fanboy

02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:58.000
I mean, Wii Sports is the

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:00.000
Biggest video game of all time, period

02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:02.000
You can't dispute that

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:04.000
But, the answer

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:06.000
That was in my head

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000
Was actually something Bobby said in chat here

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.000
Who said, who won? The gamers

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000
Absolutely believe it, the gamers won

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.000
The last generation

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:16.000
There's a lot of choice available out there now

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:18.000
And more ways to

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:20.000
Connect with each other, and our voices

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.000
Are really having an impact

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:24.000
For better or for worse

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:28.000
And so, yeah, I think the gamers won

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.000
Absolutely, if I had to pick a

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.000
Company though, Netflix

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.000
Won, big time

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000
Netflix won the last generation

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:38.000
Huge, because

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.000
That's what a lot of these gaming boxes are

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:42.000
They're Netflix devices and so forth

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:44.000
Gene in chat says

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:46.000
Apple won, you know, that's

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:48.000
Not a stretch

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:50.000
It just depends on what you look at

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.000
Alright, great tweet, great question

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:54.000
Maybe we'll get some emails on that

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:56.000
Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:58.000
Again, sorry to the call

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000
So I didn't get through, but we do want to wrap up

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.000
We are after

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:04.000
9.15 on the west coast

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:06.000
Which means it's 15 past midnight on the east coast

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:08.000
So it is about time that we wrap up

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.000
But before we say

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:12.000
Goodnight for good, we gotta go around and get everybody's

02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:14.000
Final thought

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:16.000
And I do want to also say one more time

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:18.000
Thank you very much for downloading us

It's what keeps us motivated to do this

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000
I know we've had some very strong opinions

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000
And devil's advocate positions

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:32.000
And things like that throughout the night

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.000
So I really appreciate you guys that stick with the whole thing

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.000

We do perform this show for free

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:46.000
All we ask is help spread the word

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.000
Help grow our family

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:50.000

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:52.000

And support independent broadcasting

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:56.000
There's so many great people that do this

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:58.000
If you hated our show

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.000
Yet you made it all this way

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:02.000
There's probably some other indie shows out there

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:04.000
That are for you

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:06.000
So check them out

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:08.000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:10.000
Loki, we'll start with you, your final thought tonight

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:12.000
I'm done with Cookie Clicker

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:14.000
I'm done

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:16.000
My 24 hour foray into Cookie Clicker

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:18.000
Is now complete

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:20.000
You divorced it, so it's done

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.000
You're over it

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:24.000
Party's over, get out

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:26.000
My final thought tonight is

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:28.000
That

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:30.000
Game capture card I bought

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:32.000
Really ended up being a waste of money

02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:34.000
Because I don't have a TV next to my PC

02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:36.000
Which means I need to buy a TV

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:38.000
No, I need to buy a Playstation 4

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:40.000
Which means you need to lend it to me

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:42.000
No, I need to buy a 3DS XL

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:44.000
I need to buy all the things

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:46.000
But I'm broke

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:48.000
You need a roof over your head

02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:50.000
Food in your stomach and water and shelter

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:52.000
I already said shelter

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:54.000
And fucking

02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:56.000
And sex

02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:58.000
And a kitty

02:59:58.000 --> 03:00:00.000
Dark Soccer

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:02.000
Your final thought tonight

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:04.000
I got up to go grab my shoes

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:06.000
Because my feet were cold

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:08.000
And um

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:10.000
My legs hurt from doing squats

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:12.000
I was walking like the hunched

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:14.000
Back old woman

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:16.000
And also tonight's cookie is fun

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:18.000
Alright, that's it you guys

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:20.000
Thank you very much for listening to our show

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:22.000
And I was also going to say all you need to do is

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:24.000
Get a really long HDMI cable

03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:26.000
And you're problem solved

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:28.000
Maybe I will do that, that's a good idea

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:30.000
Might as well instead of

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:32.000
I didn't even think to get

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:34.000
A 50 foot HD cable

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:36.000
Just what we need in this apartment

03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:38.000
I don't know about 50 feet

03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:40.000
I don't remember how long it is

03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:42.000
You can make an HDMI cable before you have to have

03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:44.000
Some sort of signal booster

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:46.000
You should be able to get at least 20 feet

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.000
I think without having to do that

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.000
And that should be enough

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:52.000
Yay, just what we need, another big cable in the house

03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:54.000
Alan will be so happy

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:56.000
Alright, he's cheering you live here

03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:58.000
Alright, that really is going to do it

03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:00.000
Thank you guys again for listening

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:02.000
Well again, next week's not Thanksgiving right?

03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:04.000
No, that's two weeks

03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:06.000
But I'll have to bring over sweet potato latkes

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:08.000
That are left over

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:10.000
Oh my god

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:12.000
It is the latke feast, the OLR latke feast

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:14.000
We ate like a whole bag of those fucking latkes

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:16.000
Last year, they're so good

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:18.000
Well then maybe I'll bring jelly donuts

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:20.000
Alright, that's it, we're done, we're out

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:22.000
