Greetings and Salutations
I feel better than I have in a very long time
Good. It's nice to feel great, in a good mood
Well, except for the day's just been so weird because of ye olde time change, arr
And to be honest, and just keeping it real y'all, I'm a little hungover today
So I'm a little, I'm a little like dragon
Rob, you look amazing for a hungover
Well thank you
Did you enjoy the vodka presence?
I haven't, I haven't partaken in the vodka presence, I actually was planning to drink during tonight's show, which I'm sure the listeners would have loved, but now that I've, I kind of drank a lot last night
You should try a shot of it, if you feel up to it later
We'll see, we'll see, if the, if listeners, if y'all behave, and especially knowing that I don't have to get Alan after work now, he's on his way home right now, so I don't have to drive tonight at all, so I can be responsible
Indeed
If listeners behave, I will take a shot, maybe at the beginning of part B, and the wine was already starting to get me to slur my words at the end of last week's show, so this should be hilarious
I'm gonna have to get you a bottle of the honey run, because that stuff was, I love that stuff
Good times
And you were funny, but I have to say, I just forgot what I was gonna say, so please, oh yeah, I'm drunk on coffee and high on life
Woohoo, alright, also say hello to somebody else who I'm sure is high on life, say hello to Techmaster Loki
And actually, November's not a very busy month for games, although there are a couple big games coming out
You've gotta be kidding, I was just thinking today, I was like, oh my god, November 22nd is the day the Xbox One comes out, right?
Yeah
Well, okay, on November 22nd, I've already bought, at Best Buy, and have to go pick up my Zelda 3DS, because I'm not getting the Xbox One right away, just probably next year, and then, you know what else comes out November 22nd is the Mario 3D World Land Cube
It's still not that much, really October was a busier month because you had a lot more releases
Was it really? I just would have thought, well, you've got two consoles launching this month
Yeah, but, so, are you gonna count every single re-release of each of these games on different platforms as a separate title?
I suppose not
It's just the same titles, they're just, oh hey, one comes out one week, one comes out the other week, and whatever
So, really, you only have two major releases, next gen console and first party games aside, you pretty much just have Call of Duty, and Need for Speed, and then, I guess, the Mario, Super Mario 3D World, and that's about it
Well, to be honest, I'm just keeping it real, I mean, I know everybody's excited about this new generation of games, but I'm probably, the single game I'm most excited about is that Wii U Mario game
That, I think, is the game to be most excited about right now, I think those Mario games are, 90% of the time, solid as heck, and all the good, all the kind of early previews and reviews on that thing are really positive, so I don't think I have any reason not to be super excited about that game
I'm more excited about that than anything I can think of on Playstation 4 or Xbox One, to be quite honest
But the resolution that it played on the Xbox One was just terrible, zero P, I mean, it's same with the Playstation 4, zero P
Is that why the fan wank fantasy of Nintendo making Xbox One games can't come true, because Xbox One wouldn't run away?
I get no picture and sound at all, all I get is a stupid arrow that comes on the screen that says this disc is not compatible or it's dirty or something, I just don't get it, but
Now, to be real, I don't really need the Zelda 3DS XL, I really don't need it, and my money could be better spent on other things
Spray paint the damn, but, if you buy it, you can sell me your old one for Dan
Oh, Dan wants a 3DS?
Because he wants to play Zelda!
Why doesn't he buy a Zelda 3DS?
Because I have no job!
What about a 2DS?
I have a buyer earmarked right now, but if that falls through, certainly, that would be a good thing
Dan, if you're listening to the show, which you're not, I'm not getting it for you at all, ever, no, I'm not, you don't need it
So, yeah, anyway, I just want that Zelda 3DS, because it looks so dang cool, and I was so happy that it didn't end up being a GameStop exclusive and I could buy it at a bunch of other retailers
So, yeah, I pre-ordered it at Best Buy, because I don't know if it's going to be limited quantity or what, and I just want to make sure I can
Yeah, they're always limited launch, like those Pokemon 3DS XLs, they're gone, they were gone after their first initial launch
I still saw some on the shelf at Fry's
Yeah, they probably bought a ton and didn't sell them, but it's still, they only do them one batch and that's it
Interesting, alright, well, let's see, I do want to also introduce our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com, because of course we are the show where every gamer has a voice
You guys join us in the chatroom every week, and we like to read some of the comments from the chatroom
Let's see, actdeft saying, I'm considering selling my Pikachu 3DS XL to get a Wii U, it would certainly be a start
Brad from Pod Culture says, Skye, I'm such a sucker, I ordered Injustice for the PlayStation 4, already imported it for PlayStation 3
But yeah, I mean, I know the reviews on that game were mixed, but you, Brad, really liked it, and, you know, I don't, if you like a game, then you like a game
And I don't think there's anything wrong with getting it on multiple consoles if you truly enjoy a game
Even though it's freaking weird
Well, but that's, you know, opinions
I know him, and I have to give him a hard time ever being a DC fanboy anyway
Yeah, well that's an age-old battle YouTube has been having forever
But for me, I have Final Fantasy XIV on PlayStation 3 and PC, and some people think I'm weird for that
Because you are
You bet, I'm playing it on PlayStation 4 when that's available, so I'm excited about that
Xtafur, our buddy from Horde House, is in chat tonight and says, That's one thing about Nintendo, you can bet that all their games will always run and look amazing on their systems
This is why Mario 3D World looks so much better than most other things
I don't know if they knock it out of the park 100% of the time with their games, because sometimes there's some misfires
Like what, Steel Diver wasn't really the hottest 3DS game
But not to totally dismiss your point, because it's one of the biggest perks of Nintendo and one of the biggest drawbacks
Nobody does Nintendo better than Nintendo
The bar is not really set very high for Nintendo either, I mean, because we're talking
No, I'm serious, so the type of game, though, it doesn't have to be that, it's cartoony
It doesn't have to be that realistic
And also it's a lot easier for them because they're developing on one platform as opposed to multi-platform
But that kind of goes with any first party game that you're only going to have on one platform and it might look better
Well, I was going to say, as theJ100Matt was saying, how many multiple copies of DDR do we have
Except that they actually were kind of different from system to system and release to release, so it doesn't matter
I was just about to read that same comment and go, well, it's very similar to the Madden games every year
I mean, DDR was a type of Madden game
Yeah, that actually burned calories instead of making you put them on eating chips
But still, it was music instead of players that changed
That's all you had to change, though, was the music. The music changed the whole game
The game itself, that's like saying, well, hey, Monopoly and another game that uses dice
Monopoly and Dungeons and Dragons are exactly the same because they use dice
Well, the whole point is that it's the content that makes the game, not the style
Well, part of it is the content and the style
Well, I mean, to use the D&D analogy, you use the same method every time you play
But your content's different every time you play
It's the same with DDR and same, I hope, with the sports ball stuff
Alright, well, we're having a fun conversation here at the top of the show
But I wanted to get into the official kickoff topic that I had earmarked for tonight before we get into our gaming weeks
And the kickoff topic I wanted to talk about tonight is, as I've mentioned in prior weeks on the show
We are not going to be here next week, and it's kind of sort of because of BlizzCon
I'm going to be out of town, even though I'm technically not going to BlizzCon
Long story, but I'm going to DizCon and some of the parties, so there you go
So we're not going to be here next week, so no show November 10th, sorry
But we will be back on November 17th
And if you think about it, when we're back with our first live show on November 17th
We will now live in a world that has a PlayStation 4 in it
The next system for, you know, the next generation
Although I know some people may say Wii U is in there, but, you know, well
We all know Nintendo marches to the beat of their own drum
Right? So, you know, okay, yeah, Wii U is there
But PlayStation 4 is, like, you know, and Xbox One are like really kind of like that next level of power and graphics and so forth
So this is really kind of the last episode of OLR to kind of put a cap on this generation
Now, it's not that this generation is done, because obviously there's still plenty of 360 and PlayStation 3 games to come
You don't kill your first child when you have your next child
Yeah, but, and there's even some speculation that this generation could continue if these new consoles tank, which is a possibility
If you were going to use that analogy, I would just be like this great, great, great, great, great grandmother
But for most practical purposes, this generation is probably peaked
And we're in a unique situation here at OLR that when these consoles launched in, what, 2005, 2006, we were around
So we've actually been able to cover this entire generation of gaming from start to finish, you know, having done this show as long as we have
So I'm kind of curious what my co-hosts feel, and I'll share my thoughts too
I want to know, I want to know kind of what you think the most defining game of the generation was
And I don't necessarily mean the best game of the generation, although that certainly may end up being for you the most defining
But what do you think the most defining game of the generation was?
And then I'm also going to ask so you can be thinking about it, and the chatters, you can think about this too
What do you think was the most important thing that happened news-wise in this generation?
Dark Soccer, you're already taking mic to mouth, what are your thoughts?
Well, I'm going to go with the Mass Effect series, I mean, all three of them together because they're a series
No surprise hearing this from you
Well, yeah, but I'm going to say this, that specifically it got me back into gaming this generation
Because I, you know, I had my surgery, and you know, I played a bunch of games and, you know, was, I'm okay, oh this is fun
Oh, this is neat, I'm going to go back and play Puyo Puyo, I always go back and play like my old games
Because I am a classic gamer, but I have to say that since picking up the series and getting into the story again
I've started checking out more and more new things as they've come out, I've started looking at other companies that do similar things
That, well, as opposed to the sucky things that Bioware has done, but you know, companies that have similar types of titles
I've got, I've been playing Dragon Age, I've been really expanding, and I think that it's just, it's the first series that's been out
That had so engaging a story that I really, it's, and I've used this quote before, a friend of mine in Becky's
Has said it's the best movie I've ever played, and you know how you go back and watch your favorite, how often have we seen Showgirls?
But you know, you go back and you watch your, you know, your favorite show over and over even if part of it, you know, has sucked
You know, even if you didn't like part of this story or didn't, or thought this could have been better
You still go back and watch it if it's something that you love, especially if it's the universe that you like
And I had actually gotten pretty kind of bored with it for a little while, and then I just went back and started over
And I was like, well, you know what, this is kind of fun again, and started finding new things to enjoy
And you know, so I'm actually kind of getting back into it, it's really funny
But it was, you know, especially, you know, now I play it on PC, mind you, but it still goes in with the same generation
And, you know, my second choice is actually up there too, I don't know if I can mention my second choice
Sure, of course
The Portal series, Portal and Portal 2, because those added in all kinds of different mechanics
And made you use your brain as well as having just a delicious, starky humor in it that was fantastic
And, you know, but the big two things about both of those is that you also have this community built up around it
I hate to use the word fandom, but it really is just that
It's funny that you bring up Portal, because I'm looking at our chatroom, and of course we've got people naming their games
Act Def says, the game that defined this generation, Portal
And definitely probably in my top five, I would have put the orange box as one of the defining games of this generation
Because it was such that immense value, but it also brought us Portal, it brought us, I think in many ways the orange box kind of set up Steam in a lot of ways
And I realize Steam was around before, but I think a lot of people really got onto Steam in large part because of those orange box games
And Steam has been, you know, I don't want to leave the PC and how they've been pacing alongside consoles out of this necessarily
So I think the orange box really heavily contributed, that would definitely be my top five, it's not my number one, but yeah
Well, here's the point I was going back to, why I call them defining games
Is first of all, you do have, like you were just mentioning that side by side with PC, you're actually with so much crossover between consoles and PC
You're expanding the fan base, you are building an actual bigger community instead of this us versus them mentality that's existed forever
You've actually got both people playing these games, you know, how often have I modded Becky's save files for Mass Effect 2 and 3?
Plenty of times, and you know, you've got this level of crossover, but it's, when you've got people who are so invested in the story that they've expanded around it
That I think that you've made, you've really gotten a success story out of it
I was really considering, I wasn't going to say the Mass Effect, I was really considering saying Mass Effect 3 is my game of the generation
I knew you would say it though, so I'm going to pick something else, and I know a lot of people would say, why not 2?
How could you pick 3 over 2? And this is where I go, well it's not necessarily about the best, but it's about what defined this generation
And I think in a lot of ways, you know, Mass Effect 3 introduced the multiplayer element of it, you know, which I love, and still get a lot of replayability out of it
And I want to play again soon
Yeah, and it's still a great game, but then you get into that whole debacle about the ending
And I think the internet backlash to that, whether you like it or not, was definitely one of the more noteworthy things to happen
You know, the way that the fans in many ways revolted against what they put out for the game was something you wouldn't have seen in previous generations
You know, like I think we all said around the time, Final Fantasy VII, thank god the internet wasn't out when people saw Final Fantasy VII's ending for the first time
You probably would have seen something similar, and so I think that in many ways
I liked the ending for that game
I think that in many ways, for better or for worse, defined the generation
So, I'll save my pick for just a minute here, Loki, what do you think was the game that defined the generation for better or for worse?
Well, here's kind of a weird take on it, but I'm going to say Saints Row the Third
And, unfortunately
Is that just because it's you, though?
No, no, and hold on, let me explain
It's deep
Where every gamer has a voice
Deep
It's deep
Saints Row deep
Well, no, this is, and watch, hold on, you'll understand in just a sec
So, here's why
Saints Row was a great series, and I really enjoyed it
And, I mean, pretty much the whole series has been in this generation so far
Well, the reason why Third is most defining of this generation is because of all the business tactics that are being used in games nowadays
It kind of introduced a lot of these things, at least to that series
Like, for example, on disc DLC
DLC whoring
Really terrible DLC that they charge a lot of money for and you get very little content out of
Basically gutting what was a really good series and then turning it into some big monetization fest
That is this generation of games
It's basically something that you, they've done so much to where you actually hate the series
And yet you'll still buy it the next year that it comes out
That's basically this series, this generation in gaming
You take the abuse and you still come back
Very interesting pick
I have, I can't really get around it
I have two picks for the game of the generation, but one of them is not really a game
So let me start with, and I know people are going to roll their eyes at this
But it really is, I think in many ways, the game that defined this generation, for better or worse
I believe that game is Wii Fit
Get off your ass the game?
Kind of
And I think that whole exer-gaming thing
Now some might go, well why not Wii Sports?
And believe me, I was thinking Wii Sports big time
But I really was thinking about more Wii Fit
How that really took what Wii Sports did for the whole get up off your butt and move gaming
And really pushed that forward
And really for the first time, didn't make video games look like something for lazy people
And I think that was a very important turning point in this generation
But DDR didn't?
DDR didn't catch on the way Wii Fit did because Konami didn't believe in it the way Nintendo did
Whether we like it or not
What's your point?
I think when Nintendo really pushing Wii Fit and really getting it out there
I think they really brought this counterbalance and moved the Wiis and exercise gaming altogether
Into the commonplace
Soccer moms were eating it up
Retirement homes, grandmas were playing video games
And this was like, you know, a huge thing
I have another one by the way
You can't just have one because it's hard to define a whole generation of that
And yes this is not going to grant the thought of 5 again because that's just too easy
Minecraft is another example of a thing that defines this generation
You have an indie game that just goes crazy, just blows up
You have basically all of the content out there
The community, the YouTube videos, just all that sort of stuff
And kind of almost kick starting I think a little bit of the indie resurgence you've seen
Where, hey, these indie games can actually be very good
And now you're seeing a lot more focus on indie titles and stuff that's not coming from a big publisher or developer
Well that and the genre of sandbox games in general
That's been around forever
But it really brought that back up into the limelight
My other pick for the game, and I'm using my quotey fingers
That define this generation of games is Netflix
I'm sorry, I didn't expect that, but yeah
But think about it, okay Netflix isn't a game, yes I know that
But didn't all our game consoles turn into something else, a little something else because of Netflix?
Yes there's Hulu and all this other stuff too, but Netflix obviously being the biggest one
And me just being a big fan of Orange is the New Black
Isn't that the one that really just turned game consoles into entertainment centers?
Not at my house
But we had a dedicated computer set up just for that, we didn't need to use any of that
But admittedly you're different
And again, I'm thinking about the soccer mom families and so forth
There's people that go out there and buy Wii's because they're cheap Netflix boxes
Yeah there is that, I mean it's for the same reason that people bought PS2's because of them being a DVD player
And the Blu-ray player for PS3
And one of the other games I would throw out there
And then we'll change topics here, I want to get into news stories
One of the other games that really define the generation
And you know I say for better or for worse and in this case it's definitely for worse
I think Farmville
I just burped a bit
But whether you like it or not, mobile and Facebook gaming has become bigger and bigger lately
And again it's the whole fact that it gets these people to play games
Not just play them but obsess over them
Like grandma's going out of town because she's going on a cruise for a week
Can somebody watch her farm so her frickin' cows don't die or whatever it is
That's my mother
See?
Yeah
Did your mother ever play video games before Farmville?
Yes
Oh
We used to have
Damn you ruined my point I was trying to make
My mom and I used to get into screaming matches over Dr. Mario
Which by the way her birthday is in two days so happy birthday
Alright SSG100Matt says angry birds also, definitely for those same reasons
Extover says I think Wii Sports would be more defining than Wii Fit to be honest
It really was the defining moment for all motion control games
I do agree to a point Extover and I think Wii Sports obviously was
Well it was the biggest game this generation as far as sales go
But I think Wii Fit really took what Wii Sports started and just kind of put an exclamation point on it
And that's kind of why I said Wii Fit
I mean especially you start to look at how the Kinect and the Move really got a piece of that
It was a lot more the exercise gaming and all that
I mean look at all those games that come out they're all exercise games
So anyway
Tigerclaw says two words horse armor which you know definitely Skyrim I think is a game of the generation in some ways
There's a lot of people you know that can play that game and only that game and never anything but that game
I just don't think that Skyrim brought anything really new
Tal says or maybe that's Tal sorry for mispronouncing that says at least no one mentioned Journey
You know Journey is a pretty incredible game though and I just Journey kind of stands on its own
I don't think we've yet seen how Journey has inspired other games yet
But that might be coming in the next generation
But Journey I think Journey was an amazing game and one of the best of the generation
But I don't know if it necessarily defined it
Kind of the difference there
Or if it had to be something that added definition to this generation of gaming
I would say that it added it brought back an artistic element that had been missing
Call of Duty Modern Warfare
Why?
Because that just it basically steamrolled the franchise that they have now
And then there was that whole divorce after that right or was that Modern Warfare 2?
That was after that
That was after Modern Warfare 2 I think
One more comment here and then I'll switch topics here
Extrovert says for me The Last of Us is the epitome of the defining game of this generation
To me it was this generation's series finale
That's an interesting analogy there
You know I can see that I mean I've wanted to play the game I haven't played it yet
But for everything that I've seen come up around it I'd have to agree with that
Sort of like the cherry on top of the sundae
I do like that analogy that it's the series finale
I think that's a neat way of putting it
And then we wake up and it's Bob Newhart in his bed
It was all a dream
Alright how about the news that defined this generation
You might really have to rack your brain a little bit
But what do you think was the news story that really defined this generation?
I'd say it was a series of news stories
There might be more than one that you can think of
But something off the top of your head
And I ask this to chat as well
Well I'm really going to go with a series of them
Because they all go back to the same thing
It's all those stupid violence blaming video games
Which we've got psychological studies proving the exact opposite
We have statistics showing that crime has decreased since the
When did the Nintendo come out? Was it 91? 90?
The original Nintendo? 85
I don't know why I was saying that, but Super Nintendo
I think you said Super Nintendo was 90 to 91
Because we've had a decrease in armed crime amongst youth
Over the last 20-30 years
But they still go back and try to do this as scapegoat
It's still turning into this misunderstood thing
When in reality it's just another mask for what the real problem is
So I think we're seeing a bigger increase of scapegoatism
In the news about video games
Loki, any thoughts?
It's a tough question, especially live
I can't even remember what happened last year
Like you guys, I seriously told Loki in Dark Soccer
Like 5 minutes before the show what was going to come up
As usually happens here in the world of live radio
Well I'm just trying to think of big stuff
There's the PlayStation Network hacking thing
Since you brought it up, that was my number one
The PlayStation Network hack
I wouldn't even do that
I don't know, it's just kind of to me
Maybe the Xbox One announcement
And kind of all the stuff that went wrong
Like during E3 and kind of the reversal of that stuff
It's kind of like this generation's
Almost, I don't know, some people like the specs and stuff
That they have on the console and all the different DRM things and stuff
But it's almost like for the majority of the people
I think it's like this kind of nightmare situation
Like this is the way things are going
And kind of demonstrating all the stuff that's kind of gone wrong in this generation
I don't know, I can't really think of anything that's super defining in this
It's hard to say, there hasn't really been any huge, huge, huge changes I think
I do think of two things that I would like to have been defining
And one of them was how they were networking the PS3s as a computer to
What was it, leukemia or cancer research?
Oh, the folding at home?
Yeah, I thought that's something that should have been defining
But people like to look at the negative instead of the positive
But that and all of the charities that popped up around next generation gaming
I'm not saying that they popped up with this generation
But they've certainly come to higher prevalence with this generation
We have Child's Play, Extra Life
A lot of them are going back and playing older consoles
But we're seeing a lot more of these popping up and getting attention
I kind of tie that to the emergence of streaming your gameplay online
And kind of Twitch TV and Ustream and all that
I think that's one of the big things about this generation
I think you see a lot of charity drives able to be done a lot easier
And a lot more ground roots, ground level types of fundraising
Grassroots?
Thank you, that's the word I was looking for
Types of fundraising because of being able to stream your games online
And just have that instant audience
I kind of think that story is evolving as we move into PlayStation 4
And Xbox 360 going to have that stuff in there
So we'll get into the news in a minute here where there's some borders with that
And what it will and won't do
But I think that is definitely a big story that's kind of bridging the two generations
I would really like for stuff like that to be the defining news of the generation
Really?
The most defining, I think the most defining thing ever of this generation
President Cat
I more want to put it as you have communities of people coming together for a good cause through video games
I love some of these answers here in chat
And this is a great one that I didn't even think of
And I'm sitting here going why, why didn't I think of this
Tal in our chat room says Kickstarter
Any Kickstarter related game
And Black Wolf adds to that
The news story of this generation is either the emergence of Kickstarter
Or the internet bitching enough that a storyteller changed the ending of the story they wanted to tell
But you know both those things have something in common
And that is the voice of the internet has become a huge thing this generation
If you think about it, I don't want to toot our own horn a little bit
But podcasting wasn't around last time
Heck yeah
And it is now
And that's all a part of that
It's just the voice of the gamer getting a little louder
And those barriers, you know it used to be the magazine would come to my home
And that was the only way I kind of kept tabs on what was going on in the gaming industry
But those barriers between us and the gaming industry are really coming down
Twitter is a big part of that
I can interact with developers directly for better or for worse
Well in general though that would be an evolution of communication itself
Where many communities are coming together
And having that interactivity that we didn't have you know 30 years ago
Or that we barely had 30 years ago I'll put it that way
I mean I met my husband online
I've made tons, like the chat room is full of you know friends of mine now
You know people I can call friends so
And that I might not have met otherwise
Absolutely
And Tigerclaw says you could also add the whole thing with PSN being hacked and down for a few weeks
I said it briefly but yeah that would actually be my number one most defining thing
I think was when Playstation Network was hacked
Because I think in a lot of ways how much information we're putting out there about ourselves easily
I think a very tough lesson was learned in many ways all around the board
Just like I think the last generation, the Xbox and Playstation 2
I think the defining thing of that generation was Xbox Live
It's almost like the defining thing of this generation was when the trust there kind of fails us
If that makes sense
Well that's how you were over the Xbox thing
Well sure
And you really do understand a lot more of the nature of marketing
Watching the reactions between the two companies, how they responded to their respective hackings
Also digital, I mean because there was a big push for Xbox Live Arcade
And I mean that was something that happened
And also you know full size digital games
I mean granted I'm sure it was on the PC stuff a long time ago
But console wise you know digital has been a big thing
So it was that
Alright well I'm sure you guys sitting there listening to the show have plenty more to add to this
So I invite you to email us or tweet us especially while we're down during the week
And let us know what defined this generation be it game or news for you
That's mailbag at orangelandtrader.com or you can tweet us at OLR
One final thought Jamie
I'd say the crappiest thing about this generation
Manuals! We need manuals to come back
And we need these companies to hire me to design them
So in other words it's the downside to the digital stuff
Exactly
The content is so beautiful I love manuals and I love posters
And I love getting stuff with my game that I can put on my wall
Or you know keep Midna from eating
Alright let's move on
I want to talk about our gaming weeks quickly we're running a little long tonight
Because that was a great kick off topic thank you guys
Let's quickly talk about our gaming week start Sakura
I'm not playing Animal Crossing right now
At all, am I?
Final Fantasy 14 I've been kind of stalling on that
Just because I'm on my second job and it's so slow
I was gifted thanks to DNL Dreams who is so sweet
I gave her a box of yarn a while back
And she has in return given me the Stanley parable
So I will be playing it very soon
I played some fractal
I have been playing a little bit more of the Super Mario 3D world
But like I said 3D kind of eh for me
And Dan is playing Legend of Zelda
Which ever the Oracle of Seasons ones is
Our thing
He just finished Mimish Cap
Is he doing Mimish Cap now?
He's doing one of them anyway
But Dan's going on this big Zelda kick lately
So my house has been full of Zelda music
And lots of loud cursing
And then in addition to that
It's just been me hunting down stuff on Steam that I haven't played in a while
And actually trying to get some use out of these games
And stuff I've gotten on sale before
So what about you?
I'm sorry I really read it
Oh Reddit's funny
What have I played this week?
Grand Theft Auto 5
Yeah that would have been Grand Theft Auto 5
So I played a bit of online
We did a very short Va game night this week
Thanks to the one person that came out
I guess everybody else is doing more important things
But next week though
Next week on Friday we will be doing
Another Va game night
This time on Playstation 3
So if you have the Playstation 3 version of Grand Theft Auto 5
And wish to play with us online
We will be doing that
8.15 on Friday
I should get Dan in on that
Because he would be hilarious
I mean he's hilarious anyway
And he's also funny looking
It'll be fun and I'm gonna try to get my coworkers
That are not too old
That won't fall asleep
I swear to god
It's just like
You know my boss half the time
Yeah I totally forgot to play last time
Because I got home and I just fell asleep
How fucking old are you?
You're not that old I mean seriously
Naps are awesome what are you talking about?
It's like I was just so tired I couldn't play
And then my other coworkers
You were like Raz and Mike
You know our one IT guy
Who just got the game
You're like I'll play you gotta make sure you're there
Make sure you're there
He shows up everybody else does not
It's like what the hell man
But yeah we'll be there
I'm still working on my 100% stuff
I'm doing the knife flights now
Which I'm stuck on
One that's very near the
Near the film lot
And it's a pain in the ass
I can't get the plane low enough
To trigger it
So I don't know
But I got all my stunt jumps done
And all my collectables done
And I'm at 96% or 7% now
So I just have to do knife flights
Fly under some bridges
And go to the strip club with my friends
That's actually one of the things I have to do
Alright
That it?
That's not a night in Los Santos without boobs
My gaming week was
A lot of Final Fantasy 14
As is to be expected as of late
But I'm having a great time in that game
And Shane is bugging me
As are other members of my free company
Are bugging me to finish my relic plus one
Quest so I do really need to do that
But otherwise just having a good time
Getting my darklight gear completed and all that
As far as other new games to talk about
Well this one's not new
But it's like a fresh coat of paint
On an old classic and that would be the Wii U
Virtual console release of Super Castlevania 4
And I was playing
Because that came out
Was it on Halloween or the day before?
It was this week
And since I already had it on Wii
It was only like a dollar to get the Wii U version
Which was great
And before tonight's show I was sitting here playing it
And it was on the TV behind me
And Dark Soccer goes
It's so weird that when your TV moves by itself
Hey you know I was really proud of myself
When I stepped in and I recognized it just where you had it paused
I was like
I look super Nintendo
Absolutely
So yeah
An amazing classic
And if for whatever reason you miss this game
And you happen to own a Wii U
I really urge you to pick it up
I imagine most people that are on the Wii U
Probably already played this at some point
But it is so worth it
I mean even the fact that they charge $8 for it
I think it's a worthy
I mean the game was just ahead of its time
As far as platformers are concerned
I love it so much
Super Castlevania IV
Love it
Also earlier this week
And I know we're going to get into this in the news
So it might be a little bit redundant
But on Monday, I think it was Monday
The Typing of the Dead Overkill came out
Which is the new Typing of the Dead
Based on the House of the Dead Overkill
Which was the Wii version of the game
So when I heard there was a new Typing of the Dead
I was like yes please buy
Because it's what 50% off on Steam during the week
10 bucks yeah
20 bucks instead of 20 during the week
So I bought it and I actually did some streaming
Which you can see the archive on my YouTube
Under user RobRobertsPlays
I think it's my YouTube
I'm having to get used to having a YouTube channel now
But I think the archive is at RobRobertsPlays
On YouTube and you can see me
And I think Shane and Xtopher at some point
Joined the call and we were just kind of playing through
The Typing of the Dead Overkill
Which I remember Typing of the Dead on Dreamcast
And I loved that game
So I was a little sad in this new one
Because the game's broadcast packs don't show on people's backs
And there's not even the PC or whatever
It's just kind of a straight up port of the Wii version
But I didn't play the Wii version
So I honestly thought it was like a brand new game
And I imagine there's a lot of you out there
That probably missed the Wii version
It was also on PlayStation 3
Was it really? I don't remember at all
Was it like a move game or something?
It was move enabled
I think it also allowed you to use the analog sticks
If you really wanted to
I guess I never really get into those games
On the home console
The last shooter game I really truly loved
At home was Point Blank
And that was a long time ago
That needs to come back
Those games were amazing
I never really got into Time Crisis
Or any of the on-rails shooters at home
That's more of an arcade thing to me
I never really played House of the Dead
It sounded like you said Ass of the Dead for a minute
There's actually a reason I did not buy it
Because I need bad voice acting
In my House of the Dead
We're beating G over there
I do believe that this is the one
That had the most uses of fuck in it
Oh my gosh
It's so over the top
And it's really dirty, nasty
Dialogue and exploitation
Films of the past
Like Quentin Tarantino style
70s
It's crazy
So it was like House of 1000 Corpses the game?
Kind of
If you're in the right mood for it, it's pretty funny
Of course, the phrases that you type in
Hilarious, the things that come up
We got one on the livestream that was
Walrus Punch
I don't know why that was so funny, but it was great
And I saw a screenshot of one on the internet
Where in the hospital level, there's a zombie
That gets up out of the bed and you have to type
Thanks Obama
That was funny
Ok, that's pretty cool
Loved it
And a hitstun in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
Says, I was also disappointed in the lack of
And yes, it contains House of the Dead
Overkill extended cut
Yes, if you want to use your mouse and play the clicky click
Version, you can do that too
But for me, it's all about the typing
You know what though, I do have to say
That the best thing to ever come
Out of Typing of the Dead
Was Cosplay I saw at AX one year
That had the Dreamcast pack
And the keyboard and everything, that was awesome
That's awesome, amazing
Alright, let's get into
Gaming news
In housekeeping real quick though, before we get there
Once again, I said this earlier, but just a reminder
We will not be here live next week
But I will be here live, just not on air
Maybe you'll do a twitch thing
Or something, I don't know
I'll do my homework
And let you guys watch
We're taking a night off, because you know what
Sometimes we want a night off
Sneaking myself off in Rob's luggage
Also
In housekeeping tonight, I want to mention
That we unveiled something new
At vognetwork.com tonight
You can hear the in-depth discussion on the Bobby Blackwolf
Show when he posts his episode mid-week
But in a nutshell
The game at vognetwork.com
Now includes a
Raffle element
So in other words, when you check into shows, you get your points
You do all that
You can potentially earn
Real crap that we will ship to you
And this month's crap
Is pretty good, it's Cards Against Humanity
It's a sealed version of a very hard to get game
So yeah, I'm sure there'll be some people that want to get that
So all you have to do
You have to enter though, you're not automatically put in
Just because you get points, you do have to enter
And you can check that out at vognetwork.com
Slash raffles, and I think that also shows up now
On the left side of the page
Under your user info
Contributors to the network
And people that have won in the past
Few months will be ineligible
And unfortunately
This particular month's raffle
Is only open to US residents
Because it's really expensive to ship overseas
And it's coming out of our own pocket
So we can't have it yet overseas
But we're really hoping that some of the rewards
In future month will be digital oriented
Which will be much easier for us to give to our overseas friends
Because we want the game to be something
Everybody can participate in
And many of you have been until now
So we just want to say thank you very much
And hope you enjoy this new little twist
On the VOG Network game
One other thing I gotta say
And then we can get into news
But this is important
And I want to wish a very happy episode number 400
To our friends over at Pod Culture
Because they are hitting episodes
It's already been taped
But they are putting out episode number 400 this week
It debuts at VOG Network tomorrow
At 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern
That's Monday
But then it will be on their feed right after that
And obviously 400 episodes is an amazing milestone
Brad and his gang over there at Pod Culture
Christina, Adam, all those guys
Have been a great support of OLR
Especially, especially Brad
And the support that he's given
These projects here at OLR
He supports Horde House in a huge way
Like he helped set up the website
And get that show hosted
At Horde House
So I'm so appreciative for that
The microphones that we use here now at OLR
Were kind of handed down from
Brad from Pod Culture
So yeah, they've just been such a great support
And they're squishy
And they're squishy
With the little foamy hats, yes they are
They're squishy, mine's red, I like it
It's for our listeners protection
That's right, that's right
So yeah, I just want to say a big thank you and congratulations
Because 400 is an epic milestone
I remember when you were just a wee hundred and fifty
Alright
There you go, so congrats to all those guys
Over there at Pod Culture
To register participation
For this week's episode of Orange Launch Radio
At vognetwork.com
Alright, let's start with the gaming news tonight
Loki, please, if you would, start us off with the news
Well, you know, one of the
Taglines for the Playstation 3
Uh, this generation was
It only does, and then they list a ton of shit
Well, this week they decided to put out a fact
Or, they being Sony
They decided to put out a fact
Outlining the stuff that the Playstation 4
Won't do
And that includes a few things at launch
Which, you know, of course you're gonna have to update
Your system and stuff
It's gonna lack DLNA support
So you're not really gonna be able to
Stream stuff from media servers too easily
Also, no support
It doesn't feature a music visualizer
And that's
Probably because it doesn't play any CDs
And also
Dynamic themes are not supported
Which makes sense because it kind of
Changed the whole user interface anyways
And MP3 playback
Is not gonna happen
And if you want to
Listen to music
Or see videos or that kind of thing
You can do that through
Sony Musics
With their unlimited service
And video unlimited service
You know, actually
Here's the thing
I'm not entirely sure that you can't stream stuff
To your PS4
Because I remember the Wii
Had that kind of problem too
Where you couldn't stream stuff
But they had a lot of services set up
And it creates a web page on your network
And you just do it through the web browser
So there might be a work around
But that's essentially a hack
I mean, not like a hack
Like you think we gotta do it
But it's a work around
It's still annoying that they did that
And the other thing they were saying too
The PlayStation 4 share button
Record capabilities
Apparently that is gonna be
Kind of limited to
Twitch
They're gonna upload videos to YouTube
And um
Yeah but couldn't you just export your video to Twitch
And then publish it to YouTube
Like that's what I would think you would just be able to do
Well right now it says all the archiving's gonna be done
Through um
Twitch
Yeah it's very easy on Twitch to take an archive and post it to YouTube
That's how I got like the House of the Dead things on YouTube now
So I don't know
I don't think that's a big deal
They have to have something in place if they want to protect
Whatever they're doing
That makes sense
They're also saying Ustream footage will not be saved for later playback
So whatever
Um
The other thing I was gonna mention
One of the things actually when Bobby was talking about on the show
And I had mentioned on the show
Rob said, hey stay there for the show
My thoughts about the MP3 playback
Cause it kinda sucks
And you know I've been seeing the conspiracy theory out there
Where they're like, well they're just trying to get people to
Participate in Sony's music unlimited service
Or something like that
And there's probably another reason behind it
If you think about it
First off they have to build it in the game
So that you know to have MP3 playback
But let's just assume that it works with games
Kind of like how it does now
When you're doing the streaming
And granted they could probably create a way to
I mean filter it out
But let's say they can't
So when you're doing your streaming
With your share button and all that stuff
There's possibility that licensed music is gonna be
Part of the audio that's on that
And so maybe to get around that
That's why you can't do MP3's anymore
Because if you have the Sony music unlimited stuff
That stuff's licensed by Sony
Perhaps they've licensed it for broadcast
And you know if it's in your video
Or whatever that you've made
It's not such a big deal
It's a very interesting thought
I should probably just throw out there
The point that there are many streams
On Twitch TV today
Where the person's playing Warcraft
Or League of Legends
And they're listening to iTunes in the background
So you do hear licensed music go out through Twitch TV
All the time and it's kind of a gray area
And Twitch kind of says I think in their legal fact
And I'm going off my memory so I apologize if I'm wrong
Or misrepresenting
But I want to say it just kind of says
You know we don't really
We consider it kind of like fair use or whatever
As long as they don't complain about it
Type of thing
They have no reason to go out and take it down
Because it's just part of a broadcast
So it's kind of a gray area right now
But I think that's an interesting perspective
Sony as a record label
As well as this
Maybe has a vested interest in not having you
Be able to stream your music
And it could be that they are just trying to sell more subscriptions
To Music Unlimited but let's be honest
If I have a PlayStation 4
I don't think I need to really
Necessarily do that
Oh the other thing too is it's not going to support USB
Hard drive support or memory sticks
At launch
I don't understand the reason behind it
Especially when it's something that's already in the PlayStation 3
I don't know why
But whatever the case
This is just at launch
Stuff can change
One other thing though
That's come out
Is the Xbox One will support
Playback of CDs
It will also support
DLNA streaming as well
Although
There
I guess
It's a little different
MP3 playback you can't do
They're saying to do that
The system I guess is set up as a Play 2 receiver
And that means you can
Use your Windows 7
Or Windows 8 PC
Or Windows Phone
I guess just stream to it
Kind of like the Windows Media Center
Buy our products
Basically yeah it's kind of locked into that
So
I don't know I mean that's kind of annoying
But
Whatever the reasons
It is a little disappointing
That you can't
Out of the box use it as a media server
Or something like that because that's why I use my PlayStation 3 for a lot
But I guess their thoughts
Would be oh well just use your
PlayStation 3 for that or buy a PlayStation 3
For that specific purpose
It's still annoying
And hopefully later on maybe a year
From now or hey whenever I decide to actually buy
A console because I'm definitely not getting one launch
That these features will be added
Back in so
I think it's just it's a matter of time
Especially if people complain about it enough
They are listening so
It could change
Some comments from our chat room live.vognetwork.com
PKJunior92 says I would think it would be
Super easy to just not allow anything
Playing locally to stream
I would think too
They are rushing to
This stuff is kind of in rush mode right now
Maybe that's kind of like okay let's not worry
About that right now let's just
Do this and then we'll fix it later
My thought with that is
That they might also be managing it
Some of the similar way that
I've been using live stream lately
For a lot of my drawing stuff
And you actually can choose what channels
You have input into your stream
So I mean they probably have
Like maybe a channel selector of some sort
Brad from Pop Culture says
It's better to not have features to start out
And then add later
Versus launch with features that get taken away
Like other OS on Playstation 3
That is very much the truth
Very much the truth
Alright well let's move on with some other stories
This is
I have no better way to put this
And this is the tweet that was heard
Around the world this week
And it was actually a
Twit longer because it was too much for one tweet
That happened and
The person who wrote the tweet
Was Mark Rubin
Who I believe he's behind
The studio that makes Call of Duty Ghost
So that's Infinity Ward right?
So he made this tweet and it says
Hey been on the road last couple weeks
So I haven't had the chance to update
But wanted to confirm that for Xbox One
We're 1080p upscaled from 720p
And we're native 1080p
On the Playstation 4
We optimized each console to hit 60 frames
Per second and the game looks great on both
Still on the road but glad to see the great
Reception to extinction can't wait for next
Week's launch
And yeah that went over
Huge because
It was a huge opportunity for people to jump
On and say oh Xbox One's
Inferior to Playstation 4 case in point
It's not just that either it's also Battlefield 4
Battlefield 4 is
900 because they do this weird
Shit where they always upscale stuff
It's been a thing that they've had on
Halo 3 and Halo 4
A lot of other games they upscale
But like Battlefield 4
720p on the Xbox One
900p on the Playstation 4
So
I mean based on those
Two games and speculating like
Crazy it sounds like the
Xbox One it's harder to get
You know
The graphics and stuff to be
Where they need to be in order to get
The performance that you have on that system
That's what it sounds like it's easier to do it on the
Playstation 4
Let me ask a couple devil's advocate questions that are important
One 720p versus 900p
Is there really
A difference
Can I really see the difference between the two
Is it that big of a deal
You'll note
Well it was hard because they did
Some side by side comparisons
But the problem is that the Xbox One version
Doesn't have a patch for some of the anti-aliasing
Stuff that they're going to have in there
So
Right now it does look more
Jaggy on the Xbox One
Is that going to change when that patch comes out?
Probably
So is it very hard to tell the difference between the two
Yeah for most people
You're not going to notice a huge difference
But you know the more detail
That you have in there especially with these consoles
Pushing more detail
You're going to notice it eventually
And also the other thing is
It's a next gen fucking game
It should be running at 1080p
In my opinion
I mean because what else
If it's running at the same resolution as a regular
Xbox 360 game
And some Xbox 360 games
Are probably running at higher resolutions
Why am I spending $500
On this fucking system in the first place
What am I getting out of it that's different
Than the Xbox 360 version
Look at our chat
At live.vognetwork.com
Rama says also if you're gaming on a 32 inch TV
You will not see the difference
Bonds006 says though
Yes there is a difference
Rama also speculates
I think that because of the usage of system memory
PlayStation 4 is using GDDR5
And Xbox One is using DDR3
That could be it
GDDR memory is for video cards
The other devil's advocate point I wanted to bring up
Is weren't we in this exact reverse
Situation last generation
And I specifically think
Of the game Oblivion
Cause I seem to remember
When that came out for PlayStation 3
People
And it came out a year after it was out on 360
And people were like it sucks
And the slowness of the blu-ray drive
Holds it back and it's graphically not as good
It's buggy
But did that really ruin the PlayStation 3?
No
So
Well I will say this
It didn't help the PlayStation 3
Get a great start out the gate
That generation. PlayStation 3
Had some really kick ass exclusives
To finally close the gap a little bit
And come out looking okay at the end of the generation
But here's the thing
Yeah they're gonna find tricks to
Make it better and stuff
But out the gate though
There is an advantage already
It's not as even as it might be
And I mean
For some people that's not a big deal
But when you're spending
$500, $400 on a new system
You're gonna be paying attention to
Every single
Especially when you're looking at games
Like if I'm looking to play Call of Duty
That's a game that's not exclusive to one of those consoles
I'm gonna be looking at every damn thing
And if it runs better on one system than another one
Like for example if I was buying a next gen system
For Oblivion or Skyrim
I wouldn't be buying a PlayStation 3
Cause it ran like shit
On the PlayStation 3 until about
8 patches later
Then it finally ran okay for Skyrim
I'm not sure if they ever fixed Oblivion
It took a long time
Well
I think
I do understand that point
Of wanting to have the capability to run
Higher
But there also I mean you gotta think about the average person
Who's gonna be able to afford having the huge
TV that will show it off
Like I mean
For me
Yeah I would want all of that
But if the average player isn't gonna have the TV
To show it off
It's still going to look great either way
More comments from our chatroom at
live.vognetwork.com
DungeonBuster says Bethesda had little experience with the
PlayStation 3 at the time too
They've gotten better though the problems with Skyrim's
DLC still point out issues they have with it
And Extover says
I say it's too early to tell, let's wait until next year
When next gen exclusives come out more often
You know that is true
These are launch games and every other generation
We've seen that you put the launch games
Next to the games that come out
At the end of the generation and you see
The progress, you see how far
You know developers learn to push the limitations
Of the system
So yeah maybe
The Xbox One lags a little behind
Here but they could catch up as developers
Learn how to work with them more right?
Let's be honest officially between the current gen
And next gen games you're not gonna see a huge
Difference especially on these multi-platform games
I mean granted they're gonna have some better physics
And stuff like ooh moving grass
Oooh you know
Leaves are rustling but you know
For a lot of people it doesn't matter
They're gonna, the majority of the copies
Of Call of Duty are gonna
Be sold on the Xbox 360
Like they are every other year
Last comment from our chat then we'll go to Dark Soccer
Story, BlackWolf says
Frames per second or FPS is more
Important than resolution anyway
A constant 60 frames a second
Outways the number of pixels on the screen
Amen I agree with that
Immensely because like I'll play Final Fantasy
14 and crappier graphics settings
Just to get it to run smooth
That's more important than it being pretty
So anyhow let's move on
We could debate this all day long as people
Have been doing on the internet for a long time
But we have a lot of show still to go
Who remembers the pocket station?
Me. Do you remember the pocket station?
I have one. I need to steal Julie's
I mean borrow Julie's. Isn't that how you
Like raised a chocobo in Final Fantasy 8 or something like that?
Hell yeah. Yeah and it also had a
Stat mode for um
What was that game?
She reads Justice Gakuen
Evolution, the rival school's
Second edition that came out on
Playstation. And it had, I don't remember if it was official
Or non-official but it had a wonderful
DDR you know
Non-stop course editor for
The fourth mix. Yes. Yes.
Well um
There was a teaser that came out
There's basically this
Four minute Playstation
Japan video
That's out that teases
The uh pocket station
Um so we could
Possibly see something
Similar to it coming out with PS4
I mean of course this is just a hint
At it. Nothing you know
Etched in stone or engraved
In metal I should say. But
Who knows? I mean
I used the hell out of my VMU on my
Dreamcast. I think I carried like three VMUs
On my keychain at one time. Cause I had my
Chow, Dan's Chow and um
Godzilla. It could make a very
Interesting iPhone or Android app
I was gonna say it's gonna be an app. It's not
Gonna be a device. It just seems very
Obvious to be a great use
For the app. I think it would be fun
Mhmm. Especially if they have the little cat
Cause I love the cat
The little uh
Mascot that's like shown up
Ever since. It would be
Awesome because you know they can
The Playstation 3
Can play the older games which I'm assuming
Is a matter of time before you see that on Playstation 4
As well. That they you know bring out
The library of old PS1 and 2 games
That would be really awesome if you could get a
Pocket station emulator on your phone
I know that might be asking too much but I think it would be
Really cool. You know what would be nice is
Using if you get that emulator
And um
They start you know bringing out
Localized games that we never saw
Sort of like how Nintendo's doing with the
Wii U. True. True.
That'd be fun. Alright.
Let's move on. Loki.
Alright. Um
So Microsoft has put out a brand new
Privacy policy
They were talking about
How they collect data
And this is mainly referring to
The Kinect
And talking about
What features they record
Basically
The Kinect camera
Actually records some information as far
As like you know your facial recognition
And stuff. But it saves that to your console
So that's actually not shared
They did say though that you could
I guess turn off
You know of course the Kinect features at any time
And the voice I guess
Commands are captured but I don't think those are
Shared. Skype though on the other hand
Well nothing's guaranteed to be
Private there. So
I guess they can get that
If you want. Which is not surprising
Cause I think they're already sharing it at the end
So anyways
And then
The thing that's kind of been the bane of my
Existence at least on the Xbox 360
Right now
They want some updated
Contact information for your safety
So like second
Ways to contact you via like
Email or
Texting you or phone calls and stuff like that
I've tried to put
My information in there a few times now
And it never fucking takes
It just says
Oh I don't have it. So now I just back out
Of it every god damn time because
I've already put that stuff in there
The website said it was confirmed
Yet it keeps nagging me for fucking information
Over and over. It'll send me the text. I'll confirm it
It even sent me the text
And I was gonna confirm it on
The Xbox 360
No sorry you have to visit this website to do that
Like then why the fuck are you nagging me through this
But yeah
So anyways now if you
I guess you could link your service account with
You know some other stuff
And you have to have some sort of like
Name, address, email and all that stuff
And that's just to
Protect the hacks and all that right
Yeah they claim
Yeah it can text you if somebody's trying to spend a lot of money or something like that right
I think it's more of like
Second way to authenticate yourself
You know cause Google does that
Now Steam does it
With emails
Makes sense I mean I appreciate
Them at least you know trying to
Protect things like especially after having money stolen
In the Xbox 360 very easily
I appreciate that they're taking the extra step
Even if it's a little sloppy
From Loki's perspective
And also you know just as a reminder
You know you probably
Want to make sure that you go to
Xbox.com and go to your account
Settings to make sure that
You opt out of all of the
Sharing of that information with
Microsoft parties and company affiliates
Resellers, distributors, etc, etc, etc
Cause I'm sure that they
Conveniently left that on
Of course, of course
Alright
Moving on to some highly controversial
News this week and
This one just really blew me away
And
Oh boy this is
We just had a comment earlier in the show
About somebody said
It's better to add a feature after the console
Comes out than to take something away
I believe that was Brad
We are seeing
This week something getting taken away
And it's Nintendo who
Disabled the swap note application
On their
3DS and it's due to
The exchange of quote
Explicit material
Now it should be pointed out
I may have overdone
It there cause they didn't disable the entire app
But they disabled the spot pass feature
Which for most people was the
App that means sending the notes through the internet
So you can no longer send pictures
Of your cats through the internet
Because some kids
Were exchanging explicit material
And I guess they just found this out
What two years after the app launched
Some users were exchanging
Offensive material
The feature was deactivated to quote
Limit the risk of any inappropriate
Activity or misuse of
A service
Further quotes from Nintendo's notice quote
Nintendo has learned that some consumers
Including miners
Have been exchanging their friend codes
On internet bulletin boards and then using
Swap note known as Nintendo letter box
In other regions to exchange offensive
Material
Nintendo has been investigating ways of preventing this
And determined it is best to stop the
Spot pass feature of swap note
Because it allows the direct exchange of photos
And was actively misused
Nintendo always wants to provide a positive
Experience for all consumers
And limit the risk of any inappropriate activity
Or misuse of a service
We feel it is important on this occasion
To take this action
We are very sorry for any inconvenience
To the many consumers who have been using this service
Nintendo will continue to work to ensure
More consumers are aware of our parental control
Features which allow parents to manage
Their children's experience on our systems
Okay
Nintendo just now learned this
Two afters after the fact
That if you give teenagers
Access to the internet
They are going to take pictures of their penis
And send it to their friends
It took you two years to figure that out
This is why
Everybody drags Nintendo
Over the fact that they don't understand
Online
This news story certainly doesn't do them any favors
I am
I am just shocked
At the
Like
I don't even know what word to use
A degree of naivety
Naive
God dammit
I keep wanting to say naivety
Because it's Christmas
Naivety
It is not remotely Christmas it's Hanukkah first
I mean Thanksgiving
But I'm just
Blown away by
Honestly
Honest to god it took you two years to get to that point
And now you're taken away
Because kids look up porn online
And yet
You leave the internet browser
Which you've made, I'm sure you've made
Terrible on purpose
The first thing I did when I saw this news story
Is I went to my DS browser
I pulled up gay porn
And I took a picture of it and put it on Twitter saying
Well Nintendo didn't really remove the porn from my DS
Now did they?
But they removed the child porn
Well what is it
That I told Bobby
When he tasked
The shows over to us
There are two things you can have
On a device the moment it comes out
And that's porn in Linux
It's true
I just
I was talking
I was at a fun little party last night
Which is why I'm a little hungover today
I was at a fun little party last night with Captain Spike
From Game Buoy and Slidekick was there
We love those guys
Matt or Grandpa from Hoardhouse was there
So some podcasting friends and some other people
Were all at this party
Spike and I were talking about this a lot
Spike's a big Nintendo fan and I understand why
Nintendo does make some great games
As I said earlier
The game I'm most looking forward to this holiday season
Is a Nintendo game
A Nintendo game in many ways to find last generation
He was throwing out a theory
That maybe this has to do with the 2DS
The fact that the 2DS is marketed
A bit more towards children
Because Nintendo is more actively
Pursuing the kid market
And they have to pay a little more attention to
What kids can actually do with the device
And although I totally understand that point
And respect it
There's a part of me that goes
Well god damn it
When are we going to put some onus on the parents
Because a kid doesn't walk into Toys R Us
And plop down $130 on a 2DS
Somebody drove them there if they do
There is a lot of irresponsibility on the part of parents I think
So put the 2DS in a giant envelope
That says parental warning
In big red letters
To disable internet
On this device
But you know the thing
And this goes a little bit into marketing too
Is that when you have a system
With a warning label on it
You have a chance
That a parent is going to
Just see the warning
And go oh well I don't want to do this
Risk it's easier not to deal with it
Than have to work for it
I've got too much else on my plate with my kid
Or how can I watch everything all the time
It's better just to not get it
I see it that way too
And here's the other interesting thing
Swapnote for all practical purposes
I think is one of the more innocent applications
I love to use it for cat pics
And writing little notes
I get excited about
Seeing the stuff that comes through
Meanwhile they've shut this down
But guess what still works on my Wii U
Video chat
So right at this moment
I could go on and I could call
Whoever's on their Wii U right now
And I could say hey look at this
And pull down my pants and show them my balls
I mean is Nintendo
Going to shut down the video chat too
Because heaven forbid
A child unsupervised
Uses the device because the parents were too lazy
To enable parental controls
And starts showing their goods
To predators
Which again
I'm not
Don't misunderstand me
That's the terrible thing
And people who prey on kids like that
Should have horrible horrible things done to them
But I think there has to be responsibility
On the parents part
That if you put a device like this in the home
You need to watch what your kids are doing
I would like to respond to hitstun by the way
And what does hitstun say in our chatroom
At live.vognetwork.com
They just patch out photos
Well I mean it's not stopping people from
Drawing things either
And photos were the best part
So how are you supposed to share your photos now?
I like photos of pussy
What's the point of having a 3D camera on the thing
If you can't share it with anyone
Because you can
Take them off on your SD card
And email them
Swapnote came after the launch anyway
So you can technically still view them on your card
And I guess hypothetically
Yeah you could email them or something
But it really did
And I saw the word used in chat here
PKJunior92
Nintendo neutered the service
It really neutered the photography
And even Nintendo's own
You can take the screenshots
In Animal Crossing
And they touted that as a big feature
And how you could like
I'll be honest
I've done one screencap through Swapnote
And all the rest of them I pulled off my SD card
And put on my Tumblr
I need the ones that are on my
Fan page on Facebook
I took those
On my game
And just copied them over
Because they come across as I believe as JPEGs
If you don't use the 3D mode
Alright so
There you go
I'm just very disappointed in this news
It's like every time you think
Nintendo gets it
They don't
Oh by the way
There's an app called WeKaraokeU
And I don't believe that's here in the US
I think that's something that's only available in Japan
Because you know
Karaoke is a little bigger overseas
WeSing or something
I don't think that has any karaoke in it
Yeah but there's this WeKaraokeU app
And by the way this app contains mature language
Songs in it
There was some tweet that was going around that was really funny
Where it shows the little me in it singing
We fucking in the bed
We fucking on the floor
I don't know what song that is but it's just really funny
Sure that's not a Lily Allen song
You know Reddit's blowing up with all this
So it's just
And people are just making a point out of this
It's like Nintendo
You still can do many adult things
If you want to with your console
It's JoySound is the
Karaoke thing
And if I remember correctly I do believe a JoySound game has come out over here
For the Wii
I don't believe it's on the Wii U yet
I think I remember that
But it's just
It's a little ridiculous
And unfortunately just you know
Extenuates the reason why Nintendo
Constantly gets ridiculed
For not understanding online
And this doesn't make me feel a little more comfortable about their situation
Sorry to say
Alright
Let's move on
With more news, DarkSakura
You know I feel a little bit like
I don't want to take from
Bobby's interview earlier
Think of it as giving him a cheap plug
Yeah so I'm actually gonna say
Hey everyone if you want more of the information
On this make sure that you go listen to Bobby's show
Which you can download on iTunes and blah blah blah
And blognetwork.com
So but I am gonna go ahead
And tell you what happened
And there's a
A company called Wadjet Eye
And that's
W-A-D-J-E-T and I love
Companies with mythological names
Just cool
So anyway
There was a game put out called
And it was put out for free
There were codes that you could download to play the game
Well people were taking those free codes
And setting them up to resell them
Which I think is shitty
So
Basically they just took them all down
And said well no
We don't want that to happen but
It wasn't necessarily the codes that went down
It was the page that went down
So well the link to the page that went down
So basically people were still going to that
And getting all the codes
So there's about
30,000 codes worth of games now that have been
Removed from Steam
And I believe it was 30,000?
Didn't he say? Yeah he said this during the interview too
That you know he just did those last
30,000 from like the time he went to bed
Cause he was up for 30 hours because of the situation
On his anniversary that's shitty
But um
But anyway um
It
It just
I'm not gonna say it baffles me that people will
Use the generosity of others
Because it happens I'm sorry
If you've got people
Who think they can make a profit off of
Other people they're going to do it
Humble Bundle all the time this happens with Humble Bundle
Which is why that changed
Yeah we talked about it on the show that people are eBay-ing
Their codes on the Humble Bundle
To people that don't know any better
It's really tacky
It's
I wouldn't just say tacky
It's I would put it up
In the realm of purely unethical
We just have
This faction of greedy people
Which I'm not going to go into detail on that one
Um
But I think that it was
What
What Dave Gilbert did
That was who Bobby interviewed before
I think that was purely necessary
I think it was the right step to take under the situation
And yeah there's people pissed off about it
But
Look at it as
The rotten apple spoiling the bunch
You have a lot of bad apples
Spoiling all of it
For everybody
So if you want to be mad at anybody
Be mad at the people that were abusing the system
Not at the person who was the victim of the abuse
Yeah I and
One interesting thing we learned from all this too is that
Steam can pull games from the library I thought that was interesting
We haven't really heard of a case of that happening before
But he does talk in his interview with Bobby about
You know the ethics
Behind doing that and that you know
You don't want to abuse something like that or Steam's never
Going to let you sell games or want to work with you again
So I thought that was very interesting
And there was another point with people
Being angry because they couldn't get their game
On Steam
But that doesn't stop you
From linking your game with your Steam account
You can still run everything through Steam if you want
Your functionality of Steam with your game
How do you think I get all those pretty cut scene
Screen caps of Final Fantasy 14
Right
Alright well let's travel around the world
And check out some release dates
That you can buy
And then you can resell if you want
Because it's a little more ethical
When you actually bought it in the first place
But anyway let's travel around the world and check out release dates
And what's coming out soon
Alright so this week we have Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures
On 3DS
Also the Castlevania Lords of Shadows collection
On Playstation 3, Xbox 360
Moshi Monsters
Katsuma Unleashed
On 3DS and DS
Call of Duty Ghosts
On Playstation 3, Xbox 360
Believe it or not the Playstation 4
Wii U and PC
Because you know
You gotta be cool
And get those Playstation 4 discs
A week before they come out
Hey look I got this game
I'm totally gonna not play it for a week
So it's gonna take some getting used to
That now we have to throw in Playstation 4 releases into the mix
But I guess this happened before with Wii U
Zumba Fitness World Party
On the Wii U, Xbox 360
And Wii
Power Rangers Megaforce on 3DS
The Guided Fate Paradox
On PS3
And what else
Ben 10 Omniverse 2
On Playstation 3, Xbox 360
Wii, Wii U and 3DS
Frozen on the DS
And 3DS
And
Last but not least
Um
The Travel Adventures with Hello Kitty
On 3DS
Oh yay
And the game stick
I sure know what I'm getting Rob
No no no hold off
You gotta wait for Hello Kitty Cruisers
Or whatever that was
The Mario Kart-esque game
Oh yeah right
That'll be fun
20 bucks
Rob I think you're worth at least 20 bucks
Alright I'm covered for Hanukkah
Alright
Alright let's move on
Going to Japan I would read Playstation 4 dates
But remember they're not getting theirs until next year
So we still have a little while before we start
Getting those dates in Japan
But we can read what's going on on the Playstation 3
And coming out on November 7
We have Akiba's Trip 2
Battlefield 4
Book of Spells
2K14
And Oni Chambara Z Kagura
With No No No
Comes out
Oh Rocksmith 2014 X4 will be happy to hear
That Rocksmith 2014 get exposed to Japan
As well
It's going to be big in Japan
Is it big in Japan? I don't know how well
Music games are still doing in Japan
Was Rockband and those other games really
Selling in Japan?
Rockband I don't remember
I think they did get a release
Well regardless
If you happen to have a friend
In Japan who wants to learn how to play the guitar
Rocksmith 2014 is out this week on November 7
Oh my god you know what I'm suddenly
Thinking of in my mind
Rockband Visual K Edition
Where it's all like
Malismizer and
I don't think they localize the music
Or anything when they put it out there
I just think it would be fun
Alright so there are some price reductions
As well in games like Tekken Tag Tournament 2
But I want to get to the
Xbox 360 and some of the games coming out there
Battlefield 4 is out there as well
And NBA 2K14
And Rocksmith 2014 out in Japan
This week as well on the Xbox 360
Going to the Playstation Vita
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Battle
Destiny gets a price reduction
It's already out, but there is a new game called
X-Tetra
Comes out this week on the Playstation Vita
Going to the Wii U this week
Nothing
But you do get Call of Duty Ghost
Next week since we'll be here next week
And Super Mario 3D World
In a couple weeks, I guess I'll be touching on that
Again when we come back
And on the Nintendo 3DS this week
Metal Max 4 Gekko no D.Va
X-Tetra
Comes out there as well
And there is a Monster Hunter 4 Hunter Pack
Limited Console Bundle out this week

For practically everything
And Castle Storm for the Sony consoles
On the 7th is Wii Sports Club
And the 8th is Mario & Sonic
At the Sochi
2014 Olympic Winter Games
The end
The end
Bobby Blackwolf bringing some clarity in chat
Blackwolf says
Rock Band Japan was a thing that failed in development
They talked about it at their PAX East panel
Licensing was a mess and they wound up
Giving up on it
I thought they got some version of Rock Band in Japan
But maybe it's just
Maybe they got our version subtitled
Yeah licensing was probably a mess
Maybe the import store
That I see Japanese releases on
Maybe they were kind of going the other way
And helping Japan get the English version if they so wanted
Because Japan imports stuff from us sometimes
Alright
Before we get to the classic game of the week
Just a few more stories for you guys
Loki
Here we thought we were
All done with the online pass
Because EA gave up on it
That was that
And
THQ went out of business
There's two companies
But nope
Ubisoft decided hey you know what
We're going to put a brand new online pass
I'm sorry
Uplay Passport
That's going to be part of
Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag
And then that not only will
Grant you access to the online
Portions of the game
But it also locks away
The game's fleet management system
That was part of the single player campaign
Now
That's not such a big deal if you're buying the game new
But of course if you're going to buy it second hand
It's going to cost you ten bucks
It's still kind of like really
You put that in there really
I mean come on
And people got pissed off about it
Well
Ubisoft decided hey you know what
We're going to get rid of it
And we're going to actually start now with Assassin's Creed IV
So they went ahead and
They're going to
Now have that code
You still have to get the code for
The Uplay Passport
But it'll be a free download
You just go to the PlayStation Network
Or the
Xbox Live Marketplace and you just
Download it and basically
It allows you to do that for free
And they're not going to have it in any future games
It says the Uplay Passport was initiated
As a means of giving the customer full access
And support for online multiplayer
And features along with
Exclusive content bonuses and rewards
However
Games today are blurring the lines between
Offline and online
And single player and wiz multiplayer
Come on man it was a single player campaign
There's no blurring anything there
And based on that
And feedback received
We recognize that the Passport is no longer
The best approach
Maybe just because people are calling you out and you're fucking money
Grubbing you know tactics
Is what it is you know
Yeah it's not the approach so now we're just going to have to
Microtransaction everything to be continued
Is basically the way I see it
So um
Good on them I guess
Now we only have to get on Warner Games
And Deep Silver
I mean seriously
What the fuck with Saints Row 4
You know I thought
We were done with that when THQ went out of business
And if it's not
Deep Silver I'm going to blame Volition
Those motherfuckers you know with
You know here I thought it was THQ
Forcing them to you know
Hoard the DLC for that game
Nope it was them
Alright well um
Before we get to the classic game of the week
This is this is I don't
Words escape me and I think a lot of us
Again here's another story
This week where a lot of us kind of looked at this
And went like how can this happen
This is awful
During this weekend a lot of folks
Out there were participating in a charity fundraiser
Known as Extra Life which is a
Video game fundraiser
It's gamers doing good which is the stuff we like to report
On it's raising money for the Children's Miracle
Network Hospital
Well during the fundraiser
The website for Extra Life came under
A DDOS attack which is
Denial of Service
Directed Denial of Service Attack
Basically meaning a bunch of people
Hitting it all at once to try and take it down
But they they and you know
I think the first thought that comes with this is
Well was it just too popular and all these people were trying to hit it
No they came out and said
We believe we were under DDOS attack
And somebody took down the charity website
For a couple of hours
And luckily they were able to get it back up
Only to have it taken down again
At 4.45 pm
I believe that was yesterday
It did come back up at 5.48
So after about an hour
But if you think about it
By the way Black Wolf says the first E is distributed
Whatever
Anyway
Whatever it stands for
It's a pretty shitty thing to do to a charity organization
Especially when it's gamers trying to do good
And you know all these people
Were trying to donate
And they couldn't through the site
Because everybody that's doing the stream is trying to point people to the site
And you know they couldn't
Make the donations
So you know obviously there was a lot of pissed off people
Online about like how could somebody
Be so shitty to take down
A charity
And I have a couple schools of thought on this
Is that one there's shitty people
Out there period
And you know just like we had an unfortunate
Horrible incident in the real world
Where a guy went and shot a guy at an airport
And shut down LAX for a few hours
Like how could somebody be that shitty
You know there are shitty people out there
And we have to do whatever we can to
You know stop these people
Whether that's through getting help
Or through you know whatever
I'm just curious
What there is to gain
From taking this down
Because I can't think there would be an internet organization out there
That would be like heck yeah
That would be rude over all these sick kids
Like who would want to take pride in that
I'm not sure
There are people who enjoy being assholes
Yes and I
I think it could be
And I don't want to sound like too tinfoil hatty
But it could honestly be a cyber
Terrorist organization
Or it could be someone who has a vested interest
In making gamers look bad
That sounds like a script kitty to me
You think it was just one crazy person
I think it's some juvenile kid
That's like hehehe
My other thought was that maybe they were trying to
Intercept the credit cards somehow
Maybe but I don't know how you
But I would think
You know again
I think this whole situation is shitty
And I feel shitty for even going here
But is it possible that somebody
Was after the credit card transactions
And somebody wanted to get all
All these instant credit card numbers
And things coming in in a very short
Amount of time people wanted access to that
You wouldn't DDoS a site to do that though
That would be like installing
A trojan or something
Or somehow getting access to their database
Or something
DDoSing something is not going to really do anything
As far as I'm aware
ActDeft quoting a movie
Saying there's people that just want to
See the world burn
And BlackWolf says
Sky the lulz
I don't think anyone's laughing
No
You know it's one thing when
You know maybe they take down
CNN.com or
Hack an LA Times article to say
Butts butts butts butts or whatever
They do
That's one thing
But you know charity organization
Raising money for sick kids
I don't think anybody's going to laugh at that
That's just a special kind of dickery
Yeah
The whole butts thing is an awesome dickery
Just macro every single
Key on your keyboard to type butts
When you type it
BlackWolf says I think the people who did it
Were laughing
I think it's important to make sure
If they're laughing
What sick individuals
Would be laughing at this particular situation
I think it's important that if
For whatever reason we know these people
We hang out with these people
We talk to these people
That we let them know they're sick
If you
Endorse this or you laugh at it
Too then that's just
Encouraging it to happen and I think you need
To kind of put your foot down and be like this is not
Okay
I think it was an attention grab
I mean seriously the reason why people
Do asshole things like that is because they know
It's going to rile someone up it's the worst kind
Of troll
It's why I don't give
PETA any attention anymore
It's why I hate
Bringing
Yeah it's a big thing and definitely needs to be spoken out against
But I also don't want to give these people the time of day
You know I'd like to think that
All of us and the people who listen to our show
Wouldn't hang around that kind of person
Right
That's why I'm not sitting here going
If you're the person that did this you're an asshole
Because I'm like no that person's not listening to this program
But I would like to think
That our listeners are decent people who have good taste
Absolutely
And definitely a
Higher level of ethics
Than these people do
But you know
It is a small world I learn that every day
And even though you might
Not know somebody directly who is involved with this
You might know someone that knows someone
So you know
Be that change
And let people know it's not funny
And it's not okay
Alright
Let's move on let's move on to happier things
Such as gaming history and
You know the things that brought us to where we are today
Every week here on the show
Dark Soccer likes to take a step into
The classic gaming vault
And find a game that she thinks hey
You kids out there you should be playing
This video game
Stop learning how to put butts on the
L.A. Times and play this
Classic game
Dark Soccer what is the classic game of the week?
The classic game of the week is Shin Megami Tensei
You'll make a lot of friends
With that choice
I'm pretty sure plus I have to say
That as I have not spoken to
My dear friend who is such a fan of this game
CatastrophicMagi
On
Steam for a while
I dedicate this one to you because you were the one who
Introduced me to the series
As in depth as I know it now
Shin Megami Tensei
Means true goddess reincarnation
And I am referring to the first one
That came out on October 30th
1992 for the Super Famicom
And it is based off of Megami Tensei
Which is a novel
Infamicom game
This one is the
First of the series
At least in the Shin Megami Tensei series
To be put out by Atlus
This one in particular
Starts off
It's a first person RPG
So
In fact it actually is a lot like
What was the series? Wizardry
So you go through different dungeons
And you have up to six characters
And it's turn based
A field of vision
So basically you walk up to the corner
You turn the corner
You have two types of characters
You have humans and demons
And you have to collect demons like pokemons
So your human
Will acquire the demon
By either negotiating, bribing, or coercion
During a battle
You have them
You can store them in your computer
And summon them for money
To use in battle
And they feed off of a secondary currency
Called magnetite
So
If your demon is defeated
In battle then they have to be revived
So like I said it's got that Pokemon element to it
It has
A
A method of controlling
Multiple demons
By calling them Akumagata
Which is demon fusion
So you can
Basically use
You can combine your demons to be
Like this powerful gestalt
You also have firearms
You have special ammo that goes with it
Melee weapons, you have armor
You have only certain things
That can be wielded by certain alignments
And as far as your demons go
Each of them have their own different statistics
Like I said it's kind of Pokemon like
They all have permanent
Abilities in this game
That changes with the later two
And they can't
Be changed at all
So with this
Your demons are
Are basically
Your tools for fighting
In the game along with your regular armaments
You have
Different types
You have
Pixies
You have angels
You have all kinds of
You have ghouls, you have all kinds of different ones
So the alignment of your demons
Are two different types
You have light neutral dark
And light neutral chaos
Or law neutral chaos
So basically it's kind of a D&D style
Alignment system
So you can have true neutral
You can have chaotic dark
Which I guess would be chaotic evil
Law is associated with God order and peace
Chaos is with you know
The devil and freedom and war
And then balance
Is the neutral one too
So your human characters also have
Alignment as well
Now I'm not gonna go
Too much into the stories basically it's demons
On earth and they're changing the balance of power
And you have to stop them
So you have your characters
You have your hero that you name
Yourself
In sort of the game
In Apocrypha there has been
A name given of Kazuya
In the Steven
Report 1
There is a heroine
Which in that same thing she was given
The name Yuka
You have a law hero, a chaos hero
You have a girl named Yuriko
You have Steven which is a disabled computer programmer
Who writes the demon summoning program
You have a character named Goto
Ozawa
You have just a bunch of characters in this game
I'm not gonna go into it but those are like the major characters
It also was imported later on
For the PC Engine Super CD ROM
And Mega CD
And then re-released for Playstation
And Game Boy Advance
To build hype
For Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne
Famitsu gave it a 30 out of 40
The original
That was the Playstation 1 by the way
The original version got a 36 out of 40
From Famitsu
There's also a manga spin-off
It's out in English
All kinds of stuff
And of course we have
So many different games now in the series
And that have
Come out in English that anyone
Can enjoy it but I do know for a fact
There's a translated ROM
Out of the first one so you can
Find it
And play it through whatever means you deem
Necessary
Is Shin Megami Tensei
Yeah sorry about all the beeping I was trying to find some better music
Because the first three YouTube
Videos I found were all like the same music
And it's happy
Well that's what the game sounded like
So there it is your classic game of the week
Shin Megami Tensei on the Super Nintendo
Originally
Going way back
We're going old school up in here
I was in high school
Alright we're gonna take a quick break here
And when we come back there's plenty more
Orange lounge ready to come including the FUGL question of the week
Some rapid fire news
And your emails
And your phone calls
And yeah all that's coming up
When we come back after a quick break here
At Orange Lounge Radio
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio
Live on this Sunday evening
November the 3rd
2013 with episode number 526
Of our show
And we were
Talking a lot about kind of like this
Generation of gaming earlier on in the show
Because we're not gonna be here next week
So when we are back in two weeks
The Playstation 4 will be out
And then the week after that the Xbox One will be out
So we will be living in the next
Gaming generation and it'll be
Interesting to see what the reception
Is of those systems when they launch
I'm surprised you didn't play my generation
Oh maybe at the end
Maybe at the end
Yeah we always do little break songs here
At the voice of geeks network where we do tape live of course
Sunday nights at 6 Pacific 9 Eastern
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
And you know I hope some night you'll
Be able to check us out live
I know we're up against the walking dead
Or some award show usually or whatever's
Going on but you know you could
Always TiVo those shows but
I also know that some people just wait and download us
On the podcast which is just fine too
We appreciate all you guys that stop
And check us out and I'll say this again
At the end of the show but we do always appreciate
Any feedback you guys leave us
Helping us to spread the word about our show
You know whether that be on
iTunes like a nice five star review
Or you know
Liking us on Facebook and sharing the page
Or you know I don't know if you guys know this
Stitcher now does the reviews and the
Star ratings and Stitcher is a great
App as well that's
Got a lot of people to be able to access our show
Without having to worry about downloading and
Syncing podcasts and yeah Stitcher's a
Great application so
Awesome and Bobby Blackwolf
In our chat room says speaking of award
Shows tonight Bobby Blackwolf says you were
Up against the YouTube music awards
But apparently those were a big old
Bag of dicks
I
Yeah I heard it was going to be very experimental
And I'm sure
It went wrong but we'll see alright
Let's go back and do some gaming news
Rapid fire news here Loki
Did that one Chinese food
Song win or whatever it was
One can only hope
I mean that's what I think
Of when I think of YouTube
Best lyric of our generation
Chow ma ma ma main
Ah yes anyways
So let's talk a little bit about
South Park
South Park
Seriously what's going on with you
Delayed
To March
Unfortunately
And I was so hoping
That it would come out in December
Because there was nothing coming out in December but
Yeah
And uh
Just because it's not done yet
Really and they showed some gameplay and I
Thought it would be pretty cool
Yeah I'm very much looking forward to this game
I'm a little disappointed about the delay but
You know get it right take the time you need to get it right
Don't rush it it's fine
If it comes out finally we'll all forget about the delay
So it definitely happens
Right Grand Theft Auto fans?
Speaking of Grand Theft Auto 5
29 million fans
Have already forgiven it
And it's already um
Well they shipped that many to retail
But they pretty much sold
And that means if
And that's within 6 weeks
So couple more weeks
It will have outsold
Grand Theft Auto 4's
Time sales so that's
Not bad for 6 weeks
And last but not least
Something I'm kind of excited about
The 7th guest 3
Is going to be a
Possible game that will be coming out
Full motion video and all
The 7th guest if you're not aware is a
Pretty old PC game
It was a puzzle game
And the 11th hour
The second game in the series
They're trying to kick start a third
For $435,000
Oh my god is there a reward
Tier level where I can be in the game
In one of those cheesy full motion videos
Because it's kind of awesome if so
If I had money I would so
Want to do that
I don't know let me check
They're at $39,000 right now
And they have 35 days to go
And
It would like literally be my dream
To be one of those corny full motion video actors
In one of these games
$1,000 get your name on an object
In the mansion
$5,000
Your name and likeness in a painting
Or photograph in the mansion
You could be in the game Rob
$75,000
$75,000
Scary animated portrait
Of you in the mansion and producer
In game credit
And no there is not a way to be
An actual
An actual
Can I campaign to be
One of the cheesy full motion
Video actors in the game
You would have to like probably contact
The
Creator and just give them lots
Of money and say hey
Can I forgo all those things
That be like actually in the game as like
A character
Nice
Alright yeah so if
Anybody behind that game and that Kickstarter is listening
We'd love to get you on for an interview
Wink wink or maybe I can hassle you about being
In the game wink wink alright
I'll do it dressed as Frank
No alright
Moving on I'm being a little bit
Reductive here talking about something I already
Talked about earlier in the show but I will
Mention The Typing of the Dead Overkill
Was a surprise that was brought
Out this week Sega didn't
Really mention that they were working on it there was a
Few teasers here and there but it did come out as
A surprise so Typing of the Dead Overkill
Was released it was available
For $10 but you might have missed the sale
That was only through November 1st so now
It's going to cost you $20 but you know what
Doesn't Steam always have a
Christmas sale or excuse me a winter
Holiday sale or whatever at the end of the year
Yeah so you know if you really
It is almost December ween
Yeah if you really have to get it cheap you have that to look forward
To so but honestly
It's still worth even $20 if you want to play it
Right now good times and
Yeah there it is Typing of the Dead Overkill
It is out and I'll give
A cheap plug for my YouTube channel one more time
Rob Robert just plays and you can watch me actually play
The first hour or so of the game
Um it has been announced that the
Male Wii Fit Trainer will also
Be a playable character in
Smash Brothers for Wii U and the
3DS just like you have
I don't know you kind of have like Zelda and
And Sheik are kind of the same
But not really you know
That's what they're kind of doing with the trainers
Model swap yeah the male Wii Fit
Trainer is the exact same character as the female
One it's just like a it's a costume
Swap of sorts I am so
Looking forward to beating people up with the power of yoga
Right but now you can do
That I think it would actually be cooler if they
Just left the male trainer out
I know they're just trying to pad the roster but
Whatever yeah I don't know
It's just kind of one of those oh neat
You know yeah but it's not like
Oh well now I have to pre-order this
Knowing that I can play a male Wii Fit Trainer
Just changes everything not really
It's just kind of one of those like oh neat
Type of things and it would be kind of neat for those
2 vs 2 matches to like you know
You could play Wii Fit Trainer vs Wii Fit Trainer
But you guys actually look different
And it's not just a pallet swap that's
Kind of neat for what it is
But yeah little news piece there
And lastly a follow up to an
Interview we had a couple weeks ago you might remember that
We had the guy behind
Retro Magazine that Kickstarter was here
On the show and he's with Game Gavel as well
So Cal Mike was what he went by
And he was trying to raise the money there for Retro Magazine
And was having a little bit of a hard time
Getting coverage because
Apparently a lot of commercial websites
Won't run the story
Because it's competitive
And I guess I didn't really realize
This but it should be obvious that
In these commercial for profit
Blogs and things they literally have anti
Competitive clauses they will not run a piece
That could promote something that competes against it
That's one of the great things about the indie
World because we are the exact opposite
You know when an indie podcast asks
Me to plug them I'm like heck yeah sure
Let's help each other out right
In fact we grow more
From helping each other out than trying to like
I have no tolerance for people that try to take each other down
I have no tolerance for that
The only clause we believe in is the Santa clause
I do worship Santa this is true
But anyway
We got off on a little tangent but my point I was really trying
To make is that thanks to the
Indie scene and all the people that were helping get the
Word out about this they met their goal
Yay and I think
If I'm not mistaken they might have hit
One of their stretch goals even they really
Shot up in the last few days
Now hire me
They ended up with $75,000
All together and I believe
That was going to cover a couple of the
Stretch goals
Dang look at all these people here
I'm trying to find it
$62,000 was met meaning everyone
Gets a collectible sticker with the first print
Issue and there will be an increased page
Count yay
For me
Alright anyhow
So congrats to Retro Magazine I look forward to
Having my first issue I did back it
I kicked back like $35 or so just enough
To get the year subscription of the magazine
I look forward to having that on my
Strewn on my kitchen table
Where we table LR very soon
Along with Kid Icarus Rising and
What's that pink thing?
This man bag? No
I know what the man bag is
This is a little game called Pink Hijinx
It was in my GamerX loot bag
That I just haven't played yet
It's like this game involving little pink pyramids
I thought it was a pink Tootsie roll
No I would have eaten it
Chocolate
Less chocolate more news
Well we do have some news
There was a hack
Into the Pokemans
And there are two
Mega Evolutions were
Released
We have
Let's see what they are
It was released by Smeelum
Who created the first
Homebrew Portal game for the DS
Said that there is a Mega Evolution for
Latios and Latias
Um
They are
Ugly
Ugly mon
I don't know what they're called
But they're kind of ugly
So yeah you can look online and find them
Also there is an ESR
B rating saying that Gradius 5
Might be going to PS3
Which I freaking love me some Gradius 5
But that game is some hard shit
But that would be awesome
There is a T for Teen
Rating on it
So uh who knows
I would like to see it there
Maybe with some goodies like maybe doing Gradius 2
As a throw in you know
Because Gradius 2 is the best
And then Steam has hit a milestone
65 million active
Users
That's a lot of people Rob
That's a country
A small country
Not a medium sized country I'd say
Way to go Steam
Good job
Congrats
The winner is you
Didn't they say that's bigger than Xbox Live now
Yeah
Alright let's get to the FUGL question of the week
Ladies and gentlemen
You take Facebook
You take Google Plus
You slam those words together
You get FUGL
Which by the way I'm happy to announce
You can reach our Facebook page
At Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio
But you can now reach our Google Plus page
At Google.com
Slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio
They finally have those short URLs
And we were able to get one for OrangeLoungeRadio
It's weird though because you do slash plus
But if you've seen the Google URLs
Go to Google.com slash plus
OrangeLoungeRadio
No more disgusting sequence of numbers at the end there
So you can be our friend on Google Plus
And do those things that Google users do
And when I figure out what that is
I'll let you know
Alright let's
You answer FUGL questions of the week
That's what you do and this week's FUGL question of the week
Is probably similar to something we asked before
Admittedly when these systems were first announced
But
With us not having a show on 1110
The next time we have a live show the Playstation 4
Will be out so
This is the last unofficial poll to see what systems
Our listeners are getting this holiday season
Are you or do you plan to buy
Before the end of the year
A Playstation 4
An Xbox One
A Wii U
A 3DS or a Vita
Or something else or none of the above
And why
Did you ultimately decide the way you did
I will try to read everybody's
Answers but some of the longer ones
I'm going to cut really short
Just for time's sake because we did get a lot of answers
Tonight and I don't want to go on forever so I hope you'll
Understand and read all the answers in their
Entirety at Facebook or Google Plus
Redertainment says due to
Project Buy a House
None of the above
Soutoure says none of the above
Because the Playstation 3
Gran Turismo excuse me
Gran Turismo 6 is enough for me for now
Sam H says none of the above
I have too many current gen games
To go buy and play
E3VL says
Already pre-ordered the Playstation 4
Since it's the cheaper console
May purchase the Xbox One
After it has a price drop to play the
Exclusives
Act Def says I plan on getting a Wii U
And upgrading my PC
Why do I want a Wii U?
I think there's enough games I would actually play
Like Super Mario 3D World and Rayman Legends being the main ones
And Cyber Judge says
I planned on purchasing a Playstation 4
But with recent good and bad news I received
I'm no longer purchasing an
Next gen console in the foreseeable future
I do have a Vita I'll end up getting a
Playstation 4 when I am again able
So that was about half nothing
Half mixture of Playstation 4 and Wii U
Xbox One a little later
We got a lot of people on Facebook
Let me try to get through these
Andy R says buying a Playstation 4 at launch
Mostly because it's new and shiny
And I'm a consumer whore
That's my reason too
KJ says I preordered a Playstation 4
The timing of the release of the console
Is my main reason
I paid off the Playstation 4 little by little
Not in one lump sum
Xbox One will have to wait for a price drop
Renji2214 says
I'm thinking of getting a Wii U
For the holidays this year
I haven't seen anything that interests me on Playstation 4
Xbox One and with Super Mario 3D World
And Mario Kart 9 and the new Smash Brothers
Next year I think the Wii U has a little more
That I'd be interested in
Our old pal 23rd Magus
Or what is it, Drunami
Drunami replied and said
I know better than to buy a system
At launch, even the DS took a year
Before it had more than tech demos
X2fer, our pal from Hoardhouse
Said we're getting a Playstation 4
Already have a Wii U, no Xbox
One yet, no plans to get a 3DS or Vita
LOLU
He just threw that in there to
Kick them
Matt says other
Every year around or on Cyber Monday
I spend money that I've saved towards upgrades
To my PC
I figure if I spend a little money every year
I can keep my PC at near optimal settings
This year I'm gonna get a new graphics card
A second monitor, whatever's left over will go towards
A device to help me stream games
Our friend Sil from Girls Gone Wow
I love Sil
I love you Sil
And I love your hair, it looks so cute
She's amazing
Girls Gone Wow is on our network
Wednesdays at 9am Pacific
Noon Eastern
They're really early because in the UK it's 5
I want Sil to kidnap me
Not the other way around, I want her to kidnap me
Fair enough
Anyhow, Sil says I really want a Playstation 4
But can't afford one now
I'll wait until much later when they have newer versions
And I can get it second hand
Or perhaps I should just livestream with more cleavage on display
So I can get money
But it's important to note she put a little angry face
What do you call that line underscore line face
Like the grrr face
Unfortunately she had some ignoramus on Twitter
Say something about her livestreams
And it's like
People
Grow up
Giovedea from Anime Jam Session says
Which you can hear Tuesdays here at VOG
Says 3DS with a few games
Not interested in the Wii U
And I'll probably pick up the Playstation 4
After a price drop so I can play Kingdom Hearts
Xbox One hasn't impressed me so far
Degenerate Johnny says
3DS because of Pokémon XY
And I don't want to be pressured into getting the next gen
I still have a pile of current gen games
I haven't even touched yet
When I finish this shrink wrap pile and I'm feeling comfortable moving forward
I'll consider a next gen console
Until then, I'd rather bask in the here and now
AZHP says
None of the above
My backlog of games is so huge that I honestly don't need a new system
And none of the games are really drawing me
My friend is lending me her 3DS
So I can play Ace Attorney
But other than that, there's nothing I want to play badly enough
To buy a system at this time
Burr says
I'm getting both the Playstation 4 and Xbox One
Because I have the money to get in on this console launch party madness
I know it's not the most objectively smart thing to do
But I'm going to enjoy some enthusiasm
For the next generation for now
Well, you know, I think
That's a good way of looking at it
I know this is a lot to be spending
But I'm going to have fun with this
JVMonset also says
I'm getting both
Though the Playstation 4 had zero interesting games at launch
I believe it has potential in 2014
CriticalMyths says
I cancelled my Playstation 4 pre-order
And I'll be holding off on any new consoles until 2014
I'm too backlogged on games
For my Playstation 3, Vita, and 360
As it is
Doug T says
I'm buying the Playstation 4
My preference is Sony
I have massive Playstation 2, 3, and Vita game libraries
I'm still buying the Xbox One next year
But decided to pass
Due to Microsoft's initial stance
And then over a few weeks
Constantly changing what they were doing with the system
I don't trust their position with Xbox One
They could change their stance again
GamerGirl says
I'm not bothering to buy one until further down the road
I enjoy my Playstation 3 too much
And the first batches always have glitches
So I'm going to wait
I don't even have a Wii U
DDRDollarBill says
That's a good rule
Hitstun says
Screw all that, I want a Retron 5
I've got plenty of old games
I still have to finish
And the Retron 5 makes them look nice over HDMI
That's a very creative answer
Reginator says
I'm a ways off before I buy a next gen system
I want to replace my Playstation 3 first
If I were to buy one
I'd lean towards a Playstation 4
Fifth Dream says
I have my Playstation 4 pre-ordered with release day delivery
If I were to arrive
I've just always liked Playstation
I never got a Playstation 3 because I was required to have a 360
For a tech support job
And never saw the reason to get both
Blood Drunk says
None of the above
Going for a good old fashioned video card upgrade
PC is where it's at
And James S says
I have my Playstation 4 paid off
And I'm ready to go
As well as the special edition Zelda 3DS
And I'm going to ask for a Vita for Christmas
The reason is because
I'm simply just one giant man child
Well said
Considering I'm in a very similar position
Although I've got to admit
I'm starting to waffle a little bit on the Playstation 4
I might cancel it
Because a combination of things
I think it's the three game rule
That one of our listeners said
In their response
And just the fact that
I would really be interested in upgrading my PC
A little more
And that you start to weigh what's more important
A Playstation 4
Or being able to do more stuff on your PC
And if I look at where I really spend most of my time
Gaming, it's on the PC
Dan and I have had a similar discussion
Because I'm really working on trying to up
My own design stuff
And I need a computer that's going to handle it better
Plus I play on the PC
More than anything anyway
Just don't be surprised if you guys come back in two weeks
On the show and hear that I cancelled my pre-order
Because it's something I'm strongly leaning towards right now
It's likely going to happen
Keep in mind, buying a game at launch
Is not usually a good idea
Or a system I should say
So that's interesting
None of us are
Assuming I cancel my Playstation 4
Which is the likely case at this point
I said on this show right up until the day it came out
I'm not getting a Wii U
And then of course what happened about a Wii U?
None of us will own a next gen system except my Wii U
Does this mean we have-
That doesn't count
Wii U is not a next gen system
I'm sorry
It could be like a separate parallel
Dimension system
But it's not a next
Generation system
Regardless of where you place it or how you feel about it
This is a ride shoe compared to a Pikachu
Does this mean we have to stop doing a video game podcast
Because we're not gaming enough
To be on the cutting edge of the new generation
No
No I also
Obviously I agree with you
I have a PC I can run games
I have a PC
At least a third to half of those answers
Where people saying nope not right now
Or getting systems that are like 3DS's
And Vita's and things that are already out there
Well and Dan and I already said we're gonna wait until
There's more stuff out for it that we want
We're sitting on a $100 gift card
That we're gonna put to our-
We've decided it's going to our PS4
We're just not getting it yet
Besides I wanna make sure there's no shapes or lights of death
On anything that I'm planning on purchasing
Probably if I get a PlayStation 4 this year
It's gonna be because I got it for free
I'm not actually gonna buy one
I'll wanna get one before February of next year
When Final Fantasy XIV starts on PlayStation 4
But um
You know I don't- by then I'll have a tax refund
I can spend on it too
So it's something I have to put in perspective
So keep in mind guys
I know we've been doing this podcast a long time
And some of you have stuck by us a very long time
And I really really appreciate that but the reality is
We don't make our lives off this show
Once in a great while we are extremely lucky
To get a review copy of a game from an independent studio
Or something but the reality is
It's not like they're shipping us free consoles and things like that
So just like you have to think about
Do I have the money to spend on this console
We have to ask ourselves the same question
And sometimes the answer is
No I'd rather spend the money on a ticket to Atlanta
So I can go to Dragon Con next year
You know type of thing
Or whatever it is
Alright
Anyhow moving on
We'll do some more news and then we'll get to
Our phone calls pretty soon here
At 1877 Game OLR
You can yell at me for changing my mind if you want
Although I'm not, again
You're allowed to waffle
Again
Waffles are delicious
Waffles are fucking good
And I said here on the show
I'm not getting a Wii U
I'm not getting a Wii U
What happened that Sunday when you all came to the studio
I'm playing my Wii U
So you never know
Because you're a consumer whore
And how
Back to news, Loki
Alright so Minecraft has
Done something quite interesting
There's an update I guess is going to be coming
And it was announced at Minecon
Apparently if you have the PC or Mac version of it
You will be able to
Soon
Stream to Twitch straight from the game
And you'll be able to link your
You know
Twitch TV account
To the actual game
And it'll allow you to stream I guess natively
Which I think is kind of interesting
And of course you know
I guess you'll be able to do it on
You know the Xbox One as well
Because I think they're going to have
Twitch integration
But that's kind of something separate
Speaking of the Xbox
There is some new
DLC coming in
Yet another
Reskin of the game
Much like the Mass Effect
Minecraft mod that they had
Now they have the Elder Scrolls Skyrim
Texture set
It comes with 40 character skins
Themed menus
User interface
And craftable items
Also 20 songs from Skyrim as well
And
The best part about it
Is it comes with a pre-made map
That
I guess recreates areas of
Bleak Falls Barrow
Whiterun and Riverwood
So that's pretty sweet
That is pretty neat
I need to check out some of these themed
DLCs they have going on on Xbox
Because I know they have the Mass Effect one
I never checked that out
But the Skyrim one sounds cute too
Yeah so
I think that's pretty sweet
At some point I need to go back to Minecraft
But I'm just too busy with Grand Theft Auto
Alright
Moving on to information about Wii Sports Club
Remember Wii Sports Club?
This is the thing they're doing on Wii U
That's kind of the reinvention of
What many were saying were
The game of last generation, Wii Sports
And I had no idea about this
But there was an article
That they run called
Owada Asks
That was talking about the release of Wii Sports Club
And he said quote
I'm sorry actually this is not
Owada that said this
But this is developers behind the game
Kozo Makino and
Takayuki Shimamura
Said about Namco Bandai
Being involved in the development of this
I had no idea they were involved
But Makino says
We asked Namco Bandai Studios
To develop it
So I first participated as a coordinator
But in the end I got into just about anything
I mainly worked on the network aspect of the game
But at times I made suggestions
On how some features should turn out to be
And Shimamura says
From the middle of development
Makino-san and Suzuki-san
Were also working as full fledged planners
We did ask Namco Bandai Studios
To develop the game this time
But staff and Nintendo's
Network development and operations department
The software planning and development department
That those two are in
And EAD also chipped in
So that's kind of neat
That Namco Bandai is involved
Confirmed Pac-Man a playable character
No I'm just kidding that's not confirmed
But you know
I'm a little disappointed that Nintendo chipped in
On the network portion of it
Right
That's not exactly where they're the strongest I think
Yeah a little
Especially after this week's news
I'm a little worried about that
But if it really works
I think the idea of a Wii Sports
That's online is really cool
It's a bummer
You know they can't use that camera
To be able to like show my friend
Playing Wii Sports
Although I'm sure there'd be people out there
That'd be like look I'm gonna swing around naked
I'm doing a helicopter
Rob don't worry
This is plan B
You do understand
This is plan B
Because remember this holiday
They do have a brand new Wii U skew
That has the new Super Mario Brothers U
And you know
New Luigi U as well
If that fucking fails
And can't sell the game system
You better believe
They are going to include this
With the next skew that comes out there
To try to drive sales
Oh I'm sure
And they just dropped the price
Nintendo land pretty heavy too right
Did they drop that down to 29 bucks this week
I think happened too
Or it's coming up very soon
Not surprised the game's coming in
Yeah well if it's not the packing game anymore too
You know it's gotta
Getting its price dropped
Would really help it sell
One other interesting note
You may not want to read too much into this
But there's a Wii U exclusive trailer
That Nintendo has
It's for the 2013 and 2014 lineup
That shows Wii U exclusives
Bayonetta 2 was in the trailer at one time
It's not there now
Some people are reading into this that
Uh oh
It slipped to 2015
I don't
I don't know
I think people might be reading a bit too much
Especially the people that are saying
Oh well this means it's no longer exclusive
No
They've said many times
This game would not be happening
If it wasn't for Nintendo
And it's going to be exclusive
So um
Yeah
But uh
It could just be that there's nothing new to show
You know they want to keep the game a secret
I don't know but it wouldn't
It honestly wouldn't surprise me whatsoever
If it's going to be pushed back all the way to 2015
Wouldn't surprise me
I hope they have a strong enough 2014 lineup
To keep selling Wii U's
I'm sure they've got something under their hat
Maybe the Zelda game will be this year
They'll probably be this year
Yeah maybe the Zelda game will come out sooner than we think
I'm still thinking holiday next year
I don't think it's going to be any sooner than that
I'm pretty sure it's all hands on deck for Zelda Wii U
But we'll see
Anyway
Let's move on
Dark Sakura
Well in other news
We do have
As soon as it actually works for me
There we go
There is a new Neo Geo game coming out
We have Neo XYX for Neo Geo MVS
And yeah for the longest time
The last one out was Samurai Shadow 5
So we're starting to see new ones
It was actually done by NG Dev Team
And it is a shooter
That's their third scrolling shooter
That's going to be out on the MVS
And their fourth overall MVS release
So I watched a little bit of this earlier
And it looks pretty neat I have to say
Fun shooting game
But it's nothing SNK of course
It's always fun to hear about
New games coming out for old consoles
There's still love out there for it
I love when people do Dreamcast games
Yeah right
I want some of them still
Act Def in our chat room
Reminds me of a very obvious Nintendo game
I should have remembered for 2014
Smash Brothers
I'm sure that's a given for next year too
I think that'll finally be done
That'll be good
And Mario Kart 8
Yeah there is Mario Kart 8
Wasn't there a rumor that it is
I think the date was out there
April 25th I want to say
Now granted that was a UK date if I'm not mistaken
But isn't that later than it was originally said
And remember I said when Donkey Kong got delayed
It could have been a sign that Mario Kart was delayed too
I think they have a
They're probably going to try to
Make sure they have a release every month
So they got Donkey Kong in February
There's still no real date for
I mean
They have Wii Fit U
They have the meter out for that
But they don't actually have a physical bundle for it yet
That's been announced
Unless that's December
Because there's really nothing in December
Gran Turismo
It's your month
Oh yeah don't forget Wii U owners
If you have a balance board Wii Fit U is out
Yeah
I should check that out at some point
And if you have a balance board
You already pretty much have Wii Fit U
I mean it's only a little bit different
You have to buy a meter though
So make sure you get your fit meter thing
I'm trying to think what else there was
Smash Brothers and Mario Kart
I mean those are supposed to be some point
And then
Nintendo has a tendency though to kind of surprise us
With little things
You know and they're doing their own thing now
With these Nintendo Directs
They're not adhering to any schedule
For release of news
I mean granted they'll save some of their biggest stuff
For E3 week
But I wouldn't be surprised if they don't do a press conference
Again next year
And do what they did this year
So anyway
Let's move on with some other news
Alright
Logie
Final Fantasy XIV
Doing pretty well now that they
Rebooted
Has it gone up a level?
Yes
Yes I'd say
1.5 million registered accounts
That's not bad
I'd say that's worth
You know
The reboot
Dark Soccer is doing the Final Fantasy 1 victory animation
With the hands
Up and down
Do do do do do
You know what just went into my head
Was the Brentalfloss thing
You just got pwned
FTW
So yeah
That's cool
And definitely I think it'll be neat
When the PlayStation
They say the PlayStation 4
Beta version is playing
I guess the same day as the Japanese PlayStation 4
So
February
Yep
Cool
Very cool
Yeah
We just heard not that long ago
There was a million Final Fantasy XIV
So it's going up in subscribers
That's gonna
You know
That's gonna make this year's BlizzCon
Very interesting
Because you know
There's a little
You know
This MMO
Final Fantasy XIV
Has still got some steam behind it
Now granted
You had Star Wars
And you had
Rift
And you know
Some of these other ones too
But
You know
Blizzard
I wonder if they're starting to feel the pressure this year
There's a lot of pressure
To make or break World of Warcraft this year
With this next expansion
Eventually the bubble's gotta burst
Yeah
It does for everything
Well some have said it
It burst a long time ago
Cataclysm burst that bubble
I think this year
For example
Call of Duty Ghost
Is not gonna outsell
Black Ops 2
It's not gonna happen
And I think
I don't think
It might not even be the top
Game of the year
Because of Grand Theft Auto coming out
That was huge
29 million copies in 6 weeks
Good luck
I mean that's just gonna be hard to do anyways
Even if it was an excellent game
But just
I don't think anyone really cares
And I think
The same with
Wow
There's a lot of
Other things
Competing for attention out there
In the
You know
MMO space
So
They have to do something
To really
Interest people in playing it
And I just don't think
They're really doing that a lot anymore
Alright
Well
Moving on
To the final
Final Fantasy XIV
Final Fantasy XIV
Final Fantasy XIV
Final Fantasy XIV
Alright
Well moving on to
One of those
You know
This is a case of a tweet
Giving people a lot more hope
Than maybe they should have
But you never know
And
It's also about a Square Enix game
You know
Like Final Fantasy XIV
It's about
The Dragon Quest series
And I don't believe
There's been a Dragon Quest game
Out here in a while
We did get
We did get Dragon Quest IX
Right
We did get that
But then
What there was
Dragon Quest Monsters
Joker 2
That was like 2011
That's the last time we've seen
A Dragon Quest game out here
Now
I know this
But they've been remaking
Dragon Quest games in Japan
There's actually two remakes
That have happened
A third is coming out as well
They have Dragon Quest Monsters
Wonderland 3D
And
What's the other one that they had?
They have Dragon Quest VII
That's right
Being remade for the 3DS
Ooh
Awesome
And then of course
There's Dragon Quest X
The MMO
Never happened here in the US
Right
But there's a lot of people
That want to see it happen
Well
There was a tweet
On the Nintendo of America account
With hashtag Reginator
Implying that it was from Reggie
Fils-Aime himself saying
I'd love to see a new Dragon Quest game too
And so a lot of people are like
Oh well if Reggie wants it
You know
He can make that happen
So
I don't know if he solely can make that happen
But
I'd be a fan of seeing some of these remakes
Come out over here
I'm very curious about Dragon Quest X
I'm kind of sad that just didn't happen
So
Who knows
By the way
This is the stuff now
That Operation Rainfall and that whole group
Has their eyes on
Cause you know
They've got nothing left
On their original 3
They all came out
They got their way
So now they're hoping to get this as well
So
Good luck
Hope Nintendo listens to you guys
Cause I'd like to see it
Well
Speaking of listening to you guys
Every week you guys can email us
At mailbag
At orangeloungeradio.com
In Dark Soccer
She dives into the mailbag
And picks out an email or two
To read for you guys
Here on the show
Or if it's like last week
There'll be five emails
Nah it's just one
And I had to use my radioactive gloves
To slip through the Mandarin text
So
Yes we're still getting the spam
Bleh
Alright so
What is
So we got one email tonight
One
Alright well what is it
With Twitter links
And I'm just gonna
Go ahead and read this
Hi O.L.R.
Enlightened Nintendo's recent closure of Swapnote
I'd like to bring to your attention
Some funny as hell comments
Made by Sony Computer Entertainment
Shuhei Yoshida
Enjoy
And the first one
Says
Do you want me to read these
Cause I know you're on your iPad
Or
Uh sure
Okay
Uh
The first one is a reply
To somebody saying
Oh
Uh
Okay
Why
Yoshida says
Thanks for the feedback
To the lack of MP3
And DLNA support
At the launch of PS4
I'll share with the PS4 dev team
For future consideration
And somebody replied to that
I need to listen to porn
Whilst playing Battlefield
And Yoshida replied to that
I know
Yeah
And then there was another tweet
Where
Uh
Somebody tweeted at him
Hey
I wanna know why my dick
Got caught in my PlayStation 3's
Disc tray
When I tried to play
Killzone Shadow Fall
On my PlayStation 3
It really hurts
And yes
I tried turning it on and off again
Yoshida replied
Shut up
Shut up
To which the original guy replied
K
That's cute
Okay
Also please pardon me for a brief
Orange Lounge foodie-o tangent
But do you guys have a Del Taco in the area?
Yes, we have plenty of them
Yeah
They have some
There's literally one up the street
From OLR Studios
And
You better bet
I go there all the time
It's fantastic
They have some great chicken tacos
And this is true
Signed
The Nasty Canasta
Oh
One of my favorite handles
Yes
It always makes me think of like strip poker
But it's Nasty Canasta
It's the Nasty Canasta
Nasty Canasta does need a theme song huh
Yeah
I need to um
It should be like um
It should be like
I don't know
Like something set to a Burt Bacharach song
Or something
Well Nasty Canasta kind of makes me think
Like Copacabana
Yeah
Which makes me think of like those
So I don't know
When I go
Cause you know we love to use
I kind of think of this song
That's the Nasty Canasta song now
We're not sponsored by Del Taco
We're sponsored by Pinkberry
I wish
I wish we had official sponsorship
I want sugar free Pinkberry
They had a new app come out this week
But I'm not going to plug it
Because they don't sponsor us
Hey Pinkberry
Free samples over here
Alright
Even though I cannot partake of your deliciousness for a while
Okay
There you go
So that was our email
Mailbag at orangeontraded.com
You guys didn't make our soccer work very hard this week
Act deft
Why Del Taco and not of taco?
Cause you know Americans gotta be stupid
So
Alright uh
Mailbag at orangeontraded.com
And uh
You have a week
You have an extra week this week
And you had an extra hour last night
I'm going to sleep
To really fill up that mailbag
I'm going to sleep
What?
During the show next week?
Yeah
Oh
Cause we're not having one
That's right
I'm going to sleep
Alright
Let's get to the FUs of the week
Because before we can sleep
We have to get all the angst out of our system
So we'll do the FUs of the week
FU to my state of unemployment
Um
And not hearing back on the one I really wanted to hear back on at all
Um
Yeah
This is an FU to that
And also being sore from the gym
Cause I want to go back tomorrow
And uh
Yeah
And Tom Nook
Cause he's an ass
Loki?
Um
I guess after the fact I get to have my wisdom teeth out
So that's going to be fun
Oh god that's right
Aren't you going to miss a show because of that?
Or you don't know yet?
I hope your situation isn't like mine was
Cause you remember my wisdom teeth coming out don't you?
Yeah
Where I had
Cause I got mine out when I was a teenager
So it was no big deal
I've got pictures of it
Where I look like I've been in a prize fight for three months
Gross
I hope yours is better
Uh
My FU goes to the fact that I don't have tacos right now
And that really sucks
But
That was the best
That was
We were drinking at this party last night that we went to
Which by the way it was the meme party I talked about on the show before
And now I can tell you because
You know I'm not keeping a secret from any of the listeners anymore
I witnessed the what lady?
Which you know that you know that that jpeg of the
What?
The really old lady that's missing her teeth or something
And just says W A T
So I went as the what lady to the party
And it got a great reaction
And I drank a lot
Where were some of the other costumes there?
Uh
Alan and somebody else ended up as the ridiculously hot photogenic runner guy
So it was really funny that they duplicated the costume
That was really funny
Uh
Slag Kick from Game Buoy was doing funeral selfies
He was doing selfies at funerals
So of course he walked over to me and took a picture of me
And put hashtag this bitch soon
By the way I have to tell you
A trick or treater did come to my door dressed as an internet meme
Oh yeah?
He was wearing one of the rage comic shirts
Wearing a horse head
He was an internet meme
Nice nice
Well and the other one I would say
Captain Spike also from gamebuoy.org
Uh did the he wore this like grey hoodie
But he had it stuffed with pillows so he was round
And he had a little barbie doll swinging on a chain
He was the wrecking ball
Uh
Get it?
Get it?
I thought it was funny
And he kept saying all night like how comfortable he was
Cause he had to build him pillows and I was laughing so
There you go
Uh grandpa did not dress up
So we he said something really off
As grandpa tends to do if you've ever listened to Hoard House
He said something really unpolitically correct later on in the evening
So he said he was a YouTube commenter
So that's that
So anyway
Um I don't remember why I was telling that story
But oh yes because we got tacos last night
While I had been drinking
And I'll tell you what there is no better food
When you've been drinking than tacos
Even though
Unless they come from Jack in the Box
Eff you to the fact that I'm too fat
And uh need to eat less tacos
You should try some of that vodka
I'm oh yeah I was supposed to have some of that at the start of part B huh
Mhmm
Well we'll see
Rab
Rab vodka
Maybe maybe I'll do a shot for each call we get tonight
To try to entice
Everyone call
Nice
Do I have to mix it with anything or do I just take it as shots
It it's it's already mixed it's infused with juice
Nice
Alright uh let's go to a couple more stories
And then we'll open up the phones and take some calls
At 1877 Game OLR
Uh Logie
So Sony has now announced a new Sony rewards uh plan
Apparently it allows you to earn points for money that you spend on the Playstation store
So you earn for every dollar spent you earn one point
And each of those points equals up to be about one penny versus you know towards something else
So for example if you want to get a brand new Playstation 3 game or Playstation 4 game for $59.99
It's gonna cost you $5,999
Um
Granted there are other ways you can earn money um or points I should say in there
Not just with you know purchasing stuff but you can also I think they have um money spent on this
For every dollar you spend on the Sony store
Every dollar you spend on the purchase or the uh Playstation store
Um when you upload your ticket stubs for Sony pictures, movies and also registered DVDs and Blu-ray discs
Um they're also gonna have promotions through retail partners
Also if you you know sign up for offers you earn 100 points
Buy a PS3 bundle you earn up to 270 points
Um they said for movie tickets you earn up to 400 points
I'm not sure if that's per ticket or whatever but I mean right there that's a good way there
And um basically for every 1000 points you earn a $10 uh Playstation store code
Um and then uh 250 points for uh buying the year of Playstation Plus
So yeah lots of ways to earn points and they have rewards including you know not just games and stuff
But you can also get Sony products and they have like other things, digital downloads, musics, you know movie tickets
VIP experiences they say
Oh yay
So you know prostitutes I guess
That's one I'm led to believe in
Pole dances
Good times
Hunting human beings you know that that kind of stuff
Awesome
Alright uh hey this is a new story about a free game so listen up
Um this is a game that came out on the Super Nintendo in the mid 90s it's called Blackthorn
I don't know how many
Oh god that game
Do you remember this game?
Yes I do I have that game
What you may not remember about this game it was a blizzard game
Yes
Yes
The blizzard that makes Starcraft, Diablo, Warcraft they made a few other games in the heyday
Blackthorn
Oh yeah oh yeah so Blackthorn is one of them and um what's interesting is if you have a battle.net account
You can go get Blackthorn from Blizzard for free
That's it once you've downloaded the game it's yours to keep it's a free game
I'm gonna speculate here it's to try and get more people on their battle net downloader
Cause if they can give away you know this you know what they're not making any money off this anymore
You mean all that crap I uninstalled
Well but but if you were to go download the battle net downloader so you can get Blackthorn
Then hey how easy is it to get a hearthstone on your computer when that comes out which is probably this week during Blizzcon
And how easy is it to get a Starcraft demo and a Diablo demo cause all that shit will automatically download if you don't tell it not to
So uh they know what they're doing with this they're just trying to get that battle net thing on more computers
But hey free game and for those of you that are already playing Warcraft and Diablo and all that stuff anyway
And you know shit you already have that stuff on your computer so why not add Blackthorn to that
So check that out at battle.net
Alright we are uh we're ready to open up the skype line at 1877 game OLR or username on skype orange lounge radio
Let me just make sure we are set to accept calls yes we are
And I do have my uh my bottle here of what is this vodka that you made
Jamie made this vodka she's making moonshine in her basement
Not the vodka itself the vodka is actually um actual potato vodka that I filtered myself
And it this one has I believe plum nectarine and um a couple of other fruits in it I don't remember I made it a while back so it's pretty potent
Nice alright so the skype line is open 1877 game OLR or username on skype orange lounge radio
And I will do a shot for each call that we get tonight uh but you can't just call in and say I'm only calling cause I want you to do a shot
You have to tell us something uh we've had a lot of topics tonight including the games of the generation and so forth
So there's plenty to discuss and uh I have my shot glass here I have a tall shot glass uh Alan collects shot glasses
And I just happened to grab this one it says Canada on it so I guess shout out
So it will be a polite shot
It will be it will be a very polite shot shout out to all our Canadian listeners up north
I know um I know one of the guys at least one of the guys from video game realness they're all Canadian over there in Toronto
I know at least one of them listens pretty regularly and uh Alan wait since you're walking by where's the shot glass from is this when you went to Toronto?
That's when you went to Toronto
Alan went to Toronto once and we really really want to go well I've never been I've only been to Vancouver so I really want to go back to Toronto
Oh wait I lied when I was 17 I went to Niagara Falls but you know that wasn't seeing very much of Canada
Cause I really want to go to Toronto so I know we've got listeners up there so these shots are for you guys if anybody calls
Oh no the phone line's not lighting up
Call
It's gonna be a sober night tonight
Call let's have some new voices
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
We're talking about food
Are they talking about food?
We're talking about restaurant chains and where they are in the country
I noticed somebody said racks roast beef earlier I was like oh my god that's a blast from the past
You know what was a big blast for me that they don't have anymore was Kenny Rogers Roasters
That's a thing?
Yeah it's basically like Boston Market it's almost exactly the same so in Boston Market I was like oh that's neat
That is awesome alright we are starting to get some calls here so let's go to it
Hi you're on Orange Tons Radio who's this?
Hey this is Tech Q
Hey Tech Q?
Yes
What is on your mind Tech Q? Oh wait first before I get to what's on your mind let me hold on
Oh god this bottle's hard to open hold on
Did everyone hear that?
Will you talk to Tech Q for me while I pour a shot here?
Rob is pouring himself some pink liquor so what do you have to talk about tonight?
I wanted to comment about the news of this generation that you did earlier
Y'all forgot to mention the red ring 360
Yeah there was the red ring
Oh yeah the 360 red ring
Why do you, I mean obviously I can answer this too but why do you feel this was a defining moment of the generation?
I think it affected like 90% of all 360s that were sold up to a point until they finally admitted that they shot the hardware that they sold
What do you think Microsoft's learned from this going into the next generation? Do you trust that the Xbox One's not going to have these similar types of problems or what?
I would hope they would, they wouldn't get my money if I were going to get Xbone
What are your thoughts on the upcoming generation? I know we had the Fugu question of the week earlier
Are you jumping in on any of these new consoles? Are you taking a wait and see approach or what?
Since I traded in my 360 why not get a PS4 cheap
But that is interesting that you traded in the Microsoft console to get the Sony console
What weighed in on that decision? Was that just about price or what?
It's basically before they did the 180 mantra back in July I was just disgusted with them on their policy especially on that used game DRM crap that they tried to pull
So it was probably one of those things where by the time they reversed course it was too late you'd pre-ordered your PS4 right?
Yeah
Yeah makes sense
Alright well TechQ anything else you want to share with us tonight?
Don't get too drunk
Alright I'll try I will drink responsibly
This is Rob of course he will no I'm kidding
Alright take care buddy thanks for calling
Thanks
Alright bye
Bye bye
Yes the liquor is good and what you didn't, during that call Alan came in here and took a shot as well and he approved too
What shot glass did he use? Oh how appropriate he used the Hard Rock Atlanta shot glass that I brought him from this year's DragonCon
How appropriate
So yeah I don't remember what else I put in I think it had mango too
It has yumminess in it I'll tell you that but we've got surprise surprise now we're getting tons of calls we got another call coming in
Hi you're on Orange Lawn's radio who's this?
This is Ron and I am going to do a shot with you
Buck yes alright Dark Soccer's my bartender right now she's pouring me a shot
She's such a good friend she not only makes me the liquor but then she pours it out for me that's a true friend right there
Yes yes indeed and I have my whipped cream vodka right here
When I'm old and in a wheelchair she'll be switching out my IV bag with liquor
Alright
Heck yeah
Here we go I got the shot you ready buddy?
Shit I just took a shot let me do another one okay whatever you're ready
Alright let me know when you're ready
Ready
1, 2, 3
3
Down and 1
Does it burn nicely?
That's good
I like to drop you a glass
Oh that you can't have that
My bad
Alright now that that's taken care of what's on your mind buddy?
I'm just amused by the whole PlayStation FAQ it just amuses the living shit out of me
It's like when the next when the prior gen came in it was like it can play video games it can do this this and that and I'm like
Can it play Street Fighter?
Yes but it can also do this
Can it play Street Fighter?
Yes it can play Street Fighter
Thank you
PlayStation 4 it can only play Street Fighter
But I want to do all of this
But you can only play Street Fighter
But I want to do this
Well you should have kept your prior gen console now shouldn't you?
That sounds too much like a Microsoft line
See that's the funny part it's like when Microsoft came out the gate running their mouth with everything that they're going to do
Everyone had their guns ready they were going to Microsoft castle and just hang Dracula
And Sony's like they're like Gendo they're like we're just gonna wait this out
Now they're waiting it out and Sony's like we're gonna do a little bit of this we're gonna do a little bit of that we're gonna do a little bit of this
And the people like wait a minute this is what Microsoft's were doing but it's Sony so it's okay
Well that and Sony was a little bit smarter about how they delivered the bad news to be honest
They really waited until the last minute and just kind of snuck it in under the radar
And to be real all of these features while they're disappointing at the end of the day they don't really ruin the gaming experience
And you know one place where people really razzed the shit out of Microsoft was that they were talking about TV and all this other stuff that wasn't games
At that original Xbox reveal and Sony is basically now saying like yeah we're games and not a lot else at this point with the removal of some of these media things
So it's very interesting like Sony is still delivering on the games part of it and Microsoft's getting there too with their policy adjustments and so forth
Yeah true true I can't hate on them for that but I'm amused where they say no DLNA
My train of thought is well you know what if I can't watch my anime on the PlayStation 4 I'll just fire up my PlayStation 3
I kind of feel like that's one of the first things you're gonna see get reversed I really think they're listening and I think they're gonna come back and be like
Whoa we didn't realize people were was like gonna make a big deal out of this and miss this so I kind of suspect you're gonna see it
I believe it I believe it it's just a little bit of time which is why I am not running out in the next 12 days to buy one
And that's also part of the reason I mean not just the video it's just the expense and everything and the whole fact that you know the games are disappearing that I was gonna pick up
Well from the trailer I mean when the promo for the console I'm not really a first person shooter type of guy
If I play those I'm playing it for the story which is why I like Battlefield 3 the hell with the multiplayer I like the story mode from start to finish
Interesting I don't usually hear people talk about the story in that game
That's how I am cause if I'm gonna do multiplayer it's gonna be with you and whoever else we're gonna be running our mouths like dumbasses but you know
Yeah of course
There's only one game on the PS4 that I want it's The Order it's a first person shooter that's full steampunk that's it
That was like fun
Yeah and I can that's not coming until like 2014 I can wait same thing with the Wii U Bayonetta 2 and Mario Kart 8 I can wait
X1 still waiting
Mario 3D World though that's starting to up the urgency a little bit you gotta admit a little bit
Not with me cause as G of Day I can tell you I'm more of a Mario Kart hoard than anything else
You know what that's totally fair totally fair I wish Nintendo would announce an F-Zero but as somebody said in chat earlier with all the upside downness of Mario Kart 8
Mario Kart is starting to take F-Zero's features I kinda think that says what we need to know about F-Zero
Yes and no but I'll tell you this now F-Zero on 3DS would be sick because we've played F-Zero
The game plays a lot faster than Mario Kart it's a lot faster speed it's tighter controls I mean like I said I have the XL
And there's no fucking blue shells
Exactly I mean all the 3DS games I play on my XL now they feel a lot more surreal a lot more in depth I have a lot more fun playing them
So F-Zero on that Mario Kart on it I'm sold I'm like yes
Alright well I don't know about you Rama I'm starting to feel this liquor a little bit feels good
Not me man and I shouldn't even be taking another shot cause I gotta get up at 630 for work and I have like a near 90 minute commute to work now so
You have a way better tolerance than I that's all I can say
I will send you some of my liver powers
Well my liver powers have been adhered through Patty cause she's heavy handed when she pours so Rob when you come out here to the east coast
You'll spend a week with her when you come back you'll have an iron liver
I really am hoping to get back out to New York in 2014 it is one of the goals if for nothing else than to see NPH and Hedvig that's gotta happen
If worst case scenario it's a box
As who?
Hedvig
Willy
Yeah I know right?
Alright
I want to send two boxes now huh?
Alright buddy I'm gonna let you go so we can get some more calls
You got it stay fabulous
Take care of course stay black
Of course brother
Alright bye
Bye
Alright 1877 game OLR our username on Skype orange lounge radio you know the New York I love the New York listeners the orange lounge radio
It's a fun group and it's been way too long
I wanna go back out there
Speaking of the New York orange lounge radio listeners I know this guy hasn't listened for a while but I just saw this in chat
SJ100Matt said this in chat and I was like no way really apparently Sephiroth1215 won one of the Playstation 4's through Taco Bell
Yeah
Nice
So congrats I think that's awesome
I just wanna win tacos really
Yeah?
Yeah just tacos
I'm starting to feel a little bit like spitty these are spitty and look
Pouring another
Skyplines lighting up pretty soon I'm not even gonna be able to click on the answer button
Hi orange lounge radio who's this?
Hey this is act deaf
Hey act deaf hold on we'll get to your call in a minute but there's something I gotta do first
Yeah we have a name for that when you drink a shot it's called Idago
When you take a shot of all the glass so yeah do it
What does it mean Idago?
Idago it's a name it's actually the name of one of the founding fathers of the nation
So Idago
I don't know where the name comes from for taking a shot but it's something I've heard throughout the years
You know what fair enough I gave a shout out to the Canadians earlier so this one goes out to my Mexicans down below here we go
And I did put the stuff in a petrol bottle
There you go act deaf
So maybe does it count that I put it in a petrol bottle?
Perhaps alright what's on your mind buddy I took the shot what's up
Well I wanted to talk about the influential game of the generation or most influential
Yeah what do you believe is the most influential game of the generation?
Portal
Portal oh yeah you mentioned this in chat earlier and Jamie somewhat agreed with you is her number two pick
Why did you pick Portal?
Basically well Portal didn't do anything that well how to say that special or that original
Besides the portals or the physics in the game that's something that we have we already seen in other games especially like Half Life and stuff like that
But it was influential because of the storytelling basically it's most of the games after Portal try to imitate something in the storytelling in them
Like games at least in a more serious and more detailed well not detailed sorry I'm trying to gather my words
That's alright was that because of GLaDOS you think? Like everybody loves that character
Yeah part of that and part of Shell being mute it's basically like playing Zelda or playing Mario where the main characters are mute
But since this is a first person game so basically they're talking to you so it's a more personal maybe
And all the experience around it because it's like especially because of that it's a first person it's a more personal experience all around
You're the one doing the stuff all the stuff happens to you directly so it's a lot of games after Portal have kind of imitated that
So it's not maybe in a first person perspective but more in what happens in the decisions that you make or the other stuff that you do in the game
Well basically it's you
You know what also was great about first person shooter I'm starting to slur a little bit about Portal you know what was great about Portal besides just what you're talking about like the immersion and all that
The thing that was great about Portal is that it was a first person shooter game for people that hate first person shooters
Yeah basically
I mean really like everybody I know that like hates first person shooters still loves Portal because it's more of like it's more a puzzle obviously but it's yet it is that first person
And especially that because I got the orange box on the 360 basically for Portal I didn't finish even the Half Life 2 and didn't even start episode 1 and 2
I played Team Fortress and I still play it that's a game I enjoy but basically I got the orange box because of Portal and I played a hell a lot of it
There's a lot of people that do that
I have three different copies of it two on the Xbox I got the orange box and still alive and then I got the copy on Steam so I love that game a lot
Like you said it's an immersive game it's totally immersive and like I said a lot of games have tried to replicate that immersion and a few have succeeded in it
Not all of them but it's basically the legacy that Portal has handed down to gaming and I think it's a pretty important thing too in this generation and probably the next
And very important with Portal and Jonathan Coulton
Oh yeah
Alright well Act F I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show but thank you so much for your call buddy
Thank you
Alright take care
Bye
Alright that does it for calls tonight oh I know more you wanted to call in to get me to take more shots but you guys it's a school night I got to work tomorrow and I'm already feeling a little bit tipsy so I asked the bartender to call me off

I'm a little scatterbrained right now because I just had three shots in a very short amount of time
And I have no alcohol tolerance to begin with
Um I want to thank all you guys for listening to the show
And uh encourage you to keep spreading the word about Orange Orange Radio
We appreciate all the feedback and all the good good stuff you guys leave out there for us
Sorry we won't be here next week but you know what once in a while we're gonna take a week off it happens
Um if you are gonna be at Blizzcon I'm unfortunately not going to the convention itself
Which I talked about why on a previous episode of the show
But I will be at the World of Podcasts event that's Thursday night
Um I will be there as will grandpa from Horde House so come find us and say hello
I swear we are very open and like don't be shy we're really friendly
And we'll probably be at the bar so I'll probably be a little out of it like I am right now and that makes me extra friendly
So come see us at World of Podcasts otherwise you'll have to catch me at Blizzcon the next day
Uh so for those of you that are going to Blizzcon
For the rest of you we'll see you in two weeks back here on November 17th
When we will be living in a world with the Playstation 4 and soon the Xbox One
Yes
A new era of gaming a new era of Orange Orange Radio in a way
Even though none of us are gonna get it but I imagine we'll all be playing somebody else's at least
You know what we need to do?
We need to have a PS4 QQ party
That would be fun and we'll just play Playstation 1 games all night
Jumping Flash Marathon
I thought of Jumping Flash 2
Oh my god
This is why we're friends
You have to play Playstation 1 games on your PS3 because it's 1 plus 3 and there you go 4
I like the way you think even though it's kinda ridiculous but that's why we keep you around
I still have to get a battery for the Saturn
I've been telling Dan to bring one home from work and he hasn't
Alright we're gonna wrap up the show
Um thank you guys very much I guess we gotta go around and get everybody's final thoughts
I feel like I'm forgetting something at the end of the show but it's just because things are spinning a little bit right now
So uh Loki your final thought tonight
I wonder if the memory card adapter for the Playstation 3 that they had at launch or whatever works with the PocketStation
Wait did you have last minute stories? I forgot to ask you
No like I have last minute stories
