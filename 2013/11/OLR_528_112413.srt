1
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:17,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot on the heels of the PlayStation 4, Microsoft releases the Xbox One Million.

2
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,561
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Xbox releases the Microsoft One.

3
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:21,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, millionaires buy one Xbox.

4
00:00:22,462 --> 00:00:23,043
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean.

5
00:00:23,303 --> 00:00:24,463
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't, just stay tuned.

6
00:00:24,603 --> 00:00:27,185
[SPEAKER_03]: This, Nintendo, and all your comments begin right now.

7
00:00:31,854 --> 00:00:36,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,857 --> 00:00:43,741
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 528 for this November the 24th of 2013.

9
00:00:45,802 --> 00:00:53,506
[SPEAKER_05]: You're here and we're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and it's me, Rob Roberts, and my co-hosts,

10
00:00:53,946 --> 00:00:56,529
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

11
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:13,346
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm back playing cookie clicker again, I guess.

12
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:14,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you swore that off last week.

13
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:17,108
[SPEAKER_06]: I did, but then I realized you can prestige in it.

14
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:22,292
[SPEAKER_06]: So you get, you know, I guess you get some, like, heavenly chips or some bullshit.

15
00:01:22,312 --> 00:01:23,792
[SPEAKER_05]: You got sucked right back in.

16
00:01:24,413 --> 00:01:26,334
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just because I have nothing better to do right now.

17
00:01:26,414 --> 00:01:27,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you an achievement whore?

18
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:27,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what this is?

19
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:28,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

20
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:53,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, joining us here tonight, helping to fill in for hosts since we are down DarkSakura tonight.

21
00:01:53,974 --> 00:01:55,715
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys should be familiar with this guy by now.

22
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,295
[SPEAKER_05]: After all, he is the voice of the show.

23
00:01:57,415 --> 00:01:58,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello to Jason!

24
00:01:58,976 --> 00:02:01,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I may not be the happiest bunny on the farm, but I certainly am the gassiest.

25
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:03,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew.

26
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,700
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

27
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,932
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but now it's everywhere, so we don't really do that anymore.

28
00:02:33,232 --> 00:02:34,933
[SPEAKER_05]: But how are you, Gassy Bunny?

29
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:37,574
[SPEAKER_05]: I am... You better watch out or you'll get that nickname.

30
00:02:37,835 --> 00:02:38,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, probably.

31
00:02:39,115 --> 00:02:39,496
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

32
00:02:39,856 --> 00:02:41,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm quite exhausted.

33
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:42,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

34
00:02:42,857 --> 00:02:50,181
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a surprisingly non-gamey, but still kind of gamey, but also lots of movement in the literal sense this week.

35
00:02:50,402 --> 00:02:50,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?

36
00:02:50,902 --> 00:02:51,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

37
00:02:51,162 --> 00:02:53,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, you've been traveling around everywhere, right?

38
00:02:53,143 --> 00:02:54,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of travel, yeah.

39
00:02:54,744 --> 00:02:57,527
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

40
00:03:15,965 --> 00:03:17,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we allowed to say where you work on air?

41
00:03:17,587 --> 00:03:19,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure I've said it once or twice.

42
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,513
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a pretty cool company a lot of people have heard of, I'm sure.

43
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:27,601
[SPEAKER_03]: I work for GitHub down there in San Francisco, which is my excuse for coming into town constantly.

44
00:03:27,861 --> 00:03:30,164
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't hurt that it's on their dime.

45
00:03:30,304 --> 00:03:33,048
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, why not come out to Sacramento too?

46
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,029
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't mind at all.

47
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:34,610
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't mind at all.

48
00:03:49,447 --> 00:03:59,117
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if things aren't open source and you're doing the active development in private, GitHub still applies because it's the entire suite of collaboration.

49
00:03:59,758 --> 00:04:08,147
[SPEAKER_03]: And even people that are not developers, issues managers, people that just need to go in for reviews and need to be a part of the process, it's all applicable to them as well.

50
00:04:08,927 --> 00:04:10,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Open source, public, private, whatever.

51
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:11,609
[SPEAKER_03]: It all works out.

52
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,770
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the act of development and collaboration.

53
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I do learn things from reading source code, even though I don't totally understand it.

54
00:04:17,973 --> 00:04:22,656
[SPEAKER_05]: At work, there's a lot of Visual Basic tied into Microsoft Office, like macros and things like that.

55
00:04:22,716 --> 00:04:25,397
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually did talk about this before, and you made that exact point.

56
00:04:25,777 --> 00:04:33,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Any macros or anything Visual Basic-based could... Well, you know, after 520 episodes, some topics repeat themselves once in a while.

57
00:04:33,302 --> 00:04:34,743
[SPEAKER_03]: 100 episodes ago, you know...

58
00:04:36,685 --> 00:04:42,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, okay, I don't know if I've talked about this, but I will use this as an opportunity to give a cheap plug to my YouTube channel.

59
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I've been using that more and more, right?

60
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:46,373
[SPEAKER_05]: My Rob Roberts plays and do my Let's Remember videos.

61
00:04:46,713 --> 00:04:49,095
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the games I did this week, Dragonfire on the Atari 2600.

62
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:50,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you ever play this game?

63
00:04:50,276 --> 00:04:50,736
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not.

64
00:04:50,756 --> 00:04:52,377
[SPEAKER_03]: We run across the bridge, run through the treasure room.

65
00:04:52,397 --> 00:04:53,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Practically all of the Atari.

66
00:04:53,698 --> 00:04:54,559
[SPEAKER_05]: You're probably too young.

67
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,787
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason why I bring that game up specifically is that the guy actually released the source code.

68
00:05:01,907 --> 00:05:04,930
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go to AtariAge.com and check out the source code for Dragonfire.

69
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:08,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I find those Atari 2600 source codes amazing.

70
00:05:08,614 --> 00:05:14,320
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand it whatsoever, but the cool thing about Dragonfire in particular is that it's all commented.

71
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Like here is the code that shows the sprite for the chalice, you know, something like that.

72
00:05:19,063 --> 00:05:30,489
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you can actually kind of see like, wow, this is like when they have to cram all this crap into 4K, 4 kilobytes or 8 kilobytes were like the average Atari 2600 size if you think about it.

73
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:32,631
[SPEAKER_05]: 4 kilobytes, that's nothing.

74
00:05:33,294 --> 00:05:37,716
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a... I write Word documents that are like 200 kilobytes easy.

75
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:38,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy!

76
00:05:38,636 --> 00:05:43,138
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because there's more background data in a Word document that there is actual text that you type into it.

77
00:05:43,258 --> 00:05:43,578
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

78
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:46,700
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is a similar feat, as a matter of fact, for the classic game of the week.

79
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,782
[SPEAKER_03]: A similar feat of how in the hell did they do this back in the day with such restricted file sizes and everything else.

80
00:05:53,663 --> 00:05:53,803
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

81
00:05:54,483 --> 00:05:55,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, very cool.

82
00:05:55,084 --> 00:05:58,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, we digressed a little bit there, but I find the source code stuff really fascinating.

83
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,154
[SPEAKER_05]: I also want to introduce our chat room, of course.

84
00:06:01,214 --> 00:06:02,956
[SPEAKER_05]: We always have our live chatters with us.

85
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:09,387
[SPEAKER_05]: We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network.

86
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:36,889
[SPEAKER_05]: VOG Network.com and you can join us if you are listening live in our chat room live.vognetwork.com our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf in fact starts us off tonight because I love this comment here he says the source code to Pac-Man on Atari 2600 is a piece of art even though everyone considers it a terrible game to play well yes Pac-Man on the Atari 2600 was really garbage but if you think about the time constraints the guy had to work with it's really astonishing

87
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:39,550
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like, yeah, it does some weird shit.

88
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:43,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, the fact that the ghost can only draw one, like, it has to cycle.

89
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:44,414
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why the ghosts blink.

90
00:06:44,694 --> 00:06:47,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it can't, like, the Atari 2600 literally cannot draw all of them at once.

91
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:51,399
[SPEAKER_05]: So it draws these two in one frame, these two in, or maybe one each frame.

92
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:52,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember what it does.

93
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,961
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's crazy shit to get it to work.

94
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,282
[SPEAKER_05]: And he had to do it in mere months.

95
00:06:56,723 --> 00:07:00,445
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what fucked up a lot of those Atari 2600 games, is that they had no time.

96
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,347
[SPEAKER_05]: E.T., same story.

97
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:02,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

98
00:07:03,347 --> 00:07:06,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there were maybe some other decisions along with E.T.

99
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:13,954
[SPEAKER_03]: as well, but not to digress yet again on another detailed... I could talk about old shit all day long.

100
00:07:14,094 --> 00:07:19,778
[SPEAKER_05]: And considering that I have not bought the Xbox One or the PlayStation 4 yet, I'd prefer to focus on the old stuff.

101
00:07:19,998 --> 00:07:31,795
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the 7th guest and the 11th hour that are in a really similar state that because they were made in that Windows 95, DOS, transitional kind of world where the modern... What are the words that I'm even looking for?

102
00:07:32,556 --> 00:07:36,061
[SPEAKER_03]: The modern conveniences in libraries and DirectX didn't exist yet.

103
00:07:36,562 --> 00:07:59,021
[SPEAKER_03]: and in order to be widely compatible with all the hardware that was blossoming in the Windows era the developer had to do these really, really, really nasty low-level assembly tricks to just eke out that last bit of performance for all of the visuals and the smooth video and everything that that game employed alongside Myst and Riven as well just to take something that is

104
00:08:00,931 --> 00:08:04,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Still images with depth and the transitions and everything else.

105
00:08:05,273 --> 00:08:09,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, human ingenuity and what computers have done for the last decade is unreal.

106
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:13,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, there is a way to kind of tie all this talk into what's going on with the new consoles.

107
00:08:13,836 --> 00:08:18,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we were listening to Bobby's show here in studio and just the general talk as well out there on the internet.

108
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:27,601
[SPEAKER_05]: I know one of the topics that came up on Bobby's show tonight was the fact that some of the launch games that you have right now kind of look like they could be done on current consoles.

109
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:28,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Dead Rising 3 Dead Rising 3

110
00:08:51,202 --> 00:08:58,243
[SPEAKER_06]: People have the expectation, because last gen, well, even before last gen began, or this gen, I'm getting confused which gen we're on now.

111
00:09:00,504 --> 00:09:06,665
[SPEAKER_06]: This gen, I guess, they were talking about, oh, yeah, 1080p, it's going to be 60 frames per second.

112
00:09:07,145 --> 00:09:10,606
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the next gen, okay, that's how we're going to differentiate ourselves.

113
00:09:10,646 --> 00:09:13,546
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be higher resolutions, better frame rates, and stuff like that.

114
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:18,127
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have Dead Rising 3 come out, that 720p running at 30 frames per second.

115
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:23,352
[SPEAKER_06]: and it chugs and there's like long ass load screens.

116
00:09:23,712 --> 00:09:25,694
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, dude, what the hell?

117
00:09:25,854 --> 00:09:31,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you could have done this shit on an Xbox 360 and had the same kind of results.

118
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:36,444
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, why are there games out now that have higher frame rates, look better and you can't pull this shit off on next gen?

119
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:40,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, because, and to tie it into what Jason was just talking about, it's learning the tricks.

120
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:46,071
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think there's still a lot of tricks that the developers are going to have to learn with these consoles.

121
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:51,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll see it in about a year where these games start to look better and better.

122
00:09:52,156 --> 00:09:54,858
[SPEAKER_05]: You even see it with the current-gen stuff.

123
00:09:55,738 --> 00:09:58,320
[SPEAKER_05]: What's a really good-looking game that came out in the past year?

124
00:09:59,061 --> 00:10:01,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like Tomb Raider, let's say, looks fantastic.

125
00:10:02,062 --> 00:10:02,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

126
00:10:22,606 --> 00:10:36,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I am still bugged at the fact that, you know, and this I guess is even the same situation with, you know, the Xbox 360 when it launched that they want people to spend money on these systems and they haven't really shown what's different about these systems.

127
00:10:37,152 --> 00:10:41,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, cool, so the Xbox One can display more zombies on screen, but the game still runs like shit.

128
00:10:42,194 --> 00:10:51,157
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, why don't you, I don't know, instead of pumping out a thousand zombies on the screen, maybe do 500 and then the frame rate's better.

129
00:10:51,457 --> 00:10:52,398
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

130
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:14,811
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

131
00:11:14,972 --> 00:11:19,658
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I never had a problem with there being too few zombies in Dead Rising games, to be honest.

132
00:11:19,718 --> 00:11:23,582
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't really know why it's an issue.

133
00:11:23,743 --> 00:11:24,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you being a little harsh?

134
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Because DKB in the chatroom says, Runs like shit, really?

135
00:11:28,168 --> 00:11:28,989
[SPEAKER_05]: And even I have to go.

136
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:29,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

137
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Real... Isn't that a little harsh?

138
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:33,134
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 30 frames per second.

139
00:11:34,216 --> 00:11:38,000
[SPEAKER_06]: 30 frames per second, you know, with... Once again, I have an expectation.

140
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:46,211
[SPEAKER_06]: If they want me to spend $500 on a new console, then I better see some... I better see a fucking difference between this gen and next gen.

141
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:48,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see... They have to wow me.

142
00:11:48,552 --> 00:11:49,513
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to sell it to me.

143
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:58,357
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, if they're showing me a game that looks like Dead Rising 2, but, oh, the map's slightly bigger this time, and, oh, there's some more zombies, I don't fucking care.

144
00:11:58,397 --> 00:11:59,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not buying that system.

145
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:11,624
[SPEAKER_05]: To be fair, and to be devil's advocate a little bit here, didn't we kind of know that going into this round of consoles that they weren't going to be pushing the graphical envelope and all this as much because there's not a lot more you can do.

146
00:12:12,404 --> 00:12:13,485
[SPEAKER_05]: with the current TVs.

147
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:17,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Intel 4K TVs are the standard, which we don't even know if that will be.

148
00:12:17,508 --> 00:12:20,671
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's not a lot else to do visually.

149
00:12:20,971 --> 00:12:32,141
[SPEAKER_05]: When we were talking PlayStation 2 to PlayStation 3, the entire world was in the process, well, at least this country and probably most of the rest of the world, was transitioning between SDTV and HDTV.

150
00:12:32,181 --> 00:12:33,362
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that was a huge jump.

151
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:47,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I understand that, but we've had a whole generation of games that have been running at 720p and now with hardware that's definitely a lot better than this current generation systems, and they can't fucking pull out 1080p native?

152
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:49,052
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, and...

153
00:12:49,652 --> 00:13:10,606
[SPEAKER_06]: and a decent frame rate I mean shit Rise runs at 30 frames per second if you're lucky it's locked in there or they even did dumbass shit with Need for Speed Rivals where even on PC it's fucking locked at 30 frames per second you try to unlock it and the game goes crazy because it's just the way they did their physics or something in the game it's just all messed up

154
00:13:11,306 --> 00:13:17,408
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my problem though, is that they are... Once again, there's no... And I think this is going to be a problem with these consoles.

155
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:18,209
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no hook.

156
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:19,889
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no hook to get me in there.

157
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:24,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas with the Wii, it took off because it was a new way to play games.

158
00:13:25,732 --> 00:13:26,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft's trying to sell it.

159
00:13:26,732 --> 00:13:28,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Kinect is important.

160
00:13:29,273 --> 00:13:31,435
[SPEAKER_06]: But it doesn't really do a whole ton.

161
00:13:32,035 --> 00:13:38,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, it's like these fucking promises that they made when Kinect originally came out and we're seeing the same shit not quite work right again.

162
00:13:39,261 --> 00:13:41,442
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, well, we're going to patch it.

163
00:13:41,462 --> 00:13:42,243
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to get better.

164
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,745
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it didn't fucking get better with the original Kinect.

165
00:13:46,006 --> 00:13:47,287
[SPEAKER_06]: And same with Smart Glass stuff.

166
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen how they've really implemented these second screen things other than

167
00:13:50,609 --> 00:13:51,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

168
00:14:08,136 --> 00:14:15,618
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to figure out where your head's at right now with these new consoles because you're coming off to me right now more negative than I kind of thought you were at.

169
00:14:15,978 --> 00:14:29,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of thought you were in a similar place that I was at where, okay, you might not be on board with Xbox One and PlayStation 4 right now because the games aren't really there to substantiate the several hundred dollars purchase, but I kind of thought you'd be jumping on board a year or two from now.

170
00:14:29,461 --> 00:14:30,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I wrong?

171
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:30,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

172
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:36,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, maybe if there's some better games come out that actually show off the hardware.

173
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:42,636
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now, there's not really anything coming out that's going to be like that.

174
00:14:42,696 --> 00:14:45,018
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it just all seems like promises right now.

175
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:48,062
[SPEAKER_06]: That we're getting a lot of promised things and...

176
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:50,670
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

177
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,530
[SPEAKER_06]: It just promises.

178
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,072
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, even like, look at these launches.

179
00:14:53,232 --> 00:14:54,153
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pathetic.

180
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:58,316
[SPEAKER_06]: The amount of features that aren't in there that are going to be patched in later on.

181
00:14:58,776 --> 00:15:00,078
[SPEAKER_06]: It just screams rushed.

182
00:15:00,318 --> 00:15:01,719
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole thing screams rushed.

183
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:05,882
[SPEAKER_06]: It really, these consoles should have come out six months from now and not now.

184
00:15:07,644 --> 00:15:09,626
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why bother rushing everything.

185
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:13,209
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess because you have to react to the other, you know...

186
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:14,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the holidays too.

187
00:15:15,311 --> 00:15:15,691
[SPEAKER_06]: So what?

188
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:16,532
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter.

189
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:17,553
[SPEAKER_06]: The holidays don't matter.

190
00:15:18,494 --> 00:15:21,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on now.

191
00:15:21,677 --> 00:15:24,480
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the holidays don't matter as far as selling these consoles.

192
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:29,726
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll sell a million consoles regardless of the... Are these people really saving them for the holidays?

193
00:15:29,826 --> 00:15:34,551
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, maybe a small percentage of them, but put it out six months from now and people would still be buying them.

194
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:37,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, fiscal year performance is important too.

195
00:15:37,673 --> 00:15:45,718
[SPEAKER_05]: And you and I both know you're going to sell more consoles, way more consoles between October and December than you're going to sell between January and March, which is the end of the fiscal year.

196
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:50,602
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, in that sense, it's logical, right?

197
00:15:51,132 --> 00:15:51,873
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

198
00:16:08,693 --> 00:16:24,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not picking one up anytime soon because there's no games on there that I'm really interested in and so far everything they've shown they haven't really changed anything it's all the same shit that they're pulling right now on the current gen consoles and to be honest there's more games coming out in current gen anyways

199
00:16:25,482 --> 00:16:33,648
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see some significant differences between Assassin's Creed 4 on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3.

200
00:16:34,468 --> 00:16:41,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell, even when Titanfall comes out, I kind of want to see what they're going to do as far as the Xbox 360 version.

201
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:45,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see how different that is compared to the Xbox One version.

202
00:16:46,636 --> 00:16:51,442
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I need to see what these vast differences are in order for me to, you know, justify me in purchasing.

203
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:57,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, to be honest, I mean, might as well just dump that $500 into a PC because at least those games are going to be running at a higher resolution than 720p.

204
00:16:59,531 --> 00:17:07,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I don't know, I think you might be being a little too harsh, but I also understand the frustrations, you know, I get it.

205
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:11,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, live.vognetwork.com, it is the show where every gamer has a voice.

206
00:17:12,435 --> 00:17:18,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwolf, wanting to challenge you on one of these points here, saying they rush it because gamers don't want to wait.

207
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:21,678
[SPEAKER_05]: How much did you complain when Grand Theft Auto V was delayed?

208
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,139
[SPEAKER_05]: It was worth it.

209
00:17:25,157 --> 00:17:25,817
[SPEAKER_06]: It was worth it.

210
00:17:26,237 --> 00:17:27,718
[SPEAKER_06]: And let me be honest.

211
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me be honest with Grand Theft Auto 5.

212
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:33,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Grand Theft Auto 5 has a lot more content than some of these other fucking next-gen games.

213
00:17:33,739 --> 00:17:37,720
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be a horrible, irresponsible person if I did not ask this question.

214
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:43,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you be sitting here a year from now going, it was worth it for Xbox One?

215
00:17:45,345 --> 00:17:47,826
[SPEAKER_05]: when that Grand Theft Auto 6 or whatever happens.

216
00:17:47,846 --> 00:17:52,629
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't predict the future, and it's going to be Grand Theft Auto 5 again on next year is what it's going to be.

217
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,350
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I can't predict the future.

218
00:17:55,430 --> 00:18:00,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I would like for them, I'd like to be wrong on these consoles.

219
00:18:00,193 --> 00:18:11,078
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, honestly, I would, but as we're going to get into later on, there's some things that we've complained about, like, dude, it's a fucking $60 game, and you're treating it like a free-to-play game.

220
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:13,140
[SPEAKER_06]: And shit's not going away.

221
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,001
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only getting worse.

222
00:18:14,382 --> 00:18:24,814
[SPEAKER_06]: And so why should I buy into these brand new consoles if they're just going to turn them into some sort of sieve for me to just basically take more money from me?

223
00:18:26,476 --> 00:18:28,459
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to have something to really sell me on it.

224
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, Kinect 2.0 was supposed to be so...

225
00:18:32,363 --> 00:18:54,450
[SPEAKER_05]: integral to you know the Xbox experience and aside from voice commands and shit for I don't really fucking care about voice commands okay yeah that's cool and all but um I hear I mean I don't know again there's a lot of mixed opinions out there but I'm hearing that people really are enjoying the interface once they finally get down there in there and use it that the whole like you know screen and screen stuff and and all that kind of kind of works pretty good

226
00:18:55,891 --> 00:19:14,591
[SPEAKER_06]: I still don't... For me, the screen and screen stuff, once again, you're telling me that it's important for me to have a tablet so I can do the second screen stuff, so why do I need a little tiny sliver of my screen when I can do the same shit on my tablet that's right in front of me because you're having me use this tablet to play the games as well.

227
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:16,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Except for Grand Theft Auto 5.

228
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:41,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, eventually.

229
00:19:41,628 --> 00:19:42,309
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming.

230
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:45,632
[SPEAKER_06]: They already have PC documentation inside.

231
00:19:45,712 --> 00:19:45,932
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

232
00:19:46,213 --> 00:19:48,035
[SPEAKER_05]: We got into a kickoff topic anyway.

233
00:19:48,295 --> 00:19:50,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I originally wanted to talk about the Xbox One's launch.

234
00:19:51,158 --> 00:19:52,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to talk about those sales figures.

235
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, Loki, do you want to kind of go over the sales figures?

236
00:19:55,623 --> 00:19:57,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, as Bobby said, they're trying to make some money.

237
00:19:58,065 --> 00:19:59,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like they did after all, right, Loki?

238
00:19:59,747 --> 00:20:00,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they did pretty well.

239
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:10,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One sold a million units, or they're phrasing it as over a million units.

240
00:20:12,459 --> 00:20:17,644
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying not to sound biased here, but I really fucking hate PR speak.

241
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:23,849
[SPEAKER_06]: I got down on Activision about Call of Duty and their one million units ship bullshit and stuff.

242
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:31,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they sold a million units worldwide versus one million units North America for the PlayStation 4.

243
00:20:32,175 --> 00:20:32,935
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey, you know what?

244
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,536
[SPEAKER_06]: No one's knocking a million units.

245
00:20:34,556 --> 00:20:39,719
[SPEAKER_06]: A million units of a console within 24 hours is fantastic.

246
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:41,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I have to say this.

247
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Loki.

248
00:20:42,221 --> 00:20:43,021
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of interrupting.

249
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:46,703
[SPEAKER_05]: But Tech2030 in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Fuck this.

250
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:49,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just not buy any of them and only play Cookie Clicker.

251
00:20:49,585 --> 00:20:50,265
[SPEAKER_03]: And 66% of the room is...

252
00:20:52,827 --> 00:20:53,490
I'm multitasking.

253
00:20:58,092 --> 00:21:02,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, and I have my phone off, Jason, because mine will produce cookies while it's not on.

254
00:21:02,475 --> 00:21:03,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyway.

255
00:21:03,716 --> 00:21:04,536
[SPEAKER_05]: All joking aside.

256
00:21:05,637 --> 00:21:07,298
[SPEAKER_05]: So, one million on both consoles.

257
00:21:07,358 --> 00:21:08,799
[SPEAKER_05]: But, okay, I have to go there.

258
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:10,660
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not trying to knock Xbox.

259
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm going to be real with you guys.

260
00:21:12,822 --> 00:21:19,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Based on all that internet stuff and all the rabble-rabble angry mobs we saw six months ago, I wasn't expecting Xbox One to do that well.

261
00:21:20,206 --> 00:21:20,987
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yay for them.

262
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:23,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I think competition is healthy across the board.

263
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:23,889
[SPEAKER_05]: However...

264
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:29,413
[SPEAKER_05]: It is worth pointing out, Xbox One might have sold a million, but they did it in, what, 13 countries?

265
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:31,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas PlayStation 4 was only U.S.

266
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:31,935
[SPEAKER_05]: and Canada, right?

267
00:21:32,095 --> 00:21:36,679
[SPEAKER_06]: I still think it's very skewed as far as, you know, it's good for day one.

268
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get me wrong, it's good for day one.

269
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:49,289
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're going to play the console wars here, you have to understand that we're talking a couple countries versus basically all their launch territories at once.

270
00:21:49,329 --> 00:21:51,411
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not like doom and gloom for Xbox.

271
00:21:51,451 --> 00:21:52,012
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not at all.

272
00:21:52,032 --> 00:21:52,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Far from it.

273
00:21:52,632 --> 00:21:53,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Not at all.

274
00:21:53,233 --> 00:22:02,481
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the end of the day, once they do finally launch in all their countries or whatever, I think you're going to see a significant number more PlayStation 4s than you are the Xbox One.

275
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:05,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I don't think they've still recovered completely from...

276
00:22:07,066 --> 00:22:29,422
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just the price I think at the end of the day for a lot of people I mean not the ones listening to this podcast or participating I think the folks you know active gamers participating in this kind of have a lot more issues to juggle but I think for a lot of people for a lot of parents sitting there going what do I buy for my teenage son or daughter which oh this one's cheaper I'm gonna get that I think for a lot of people that's what it's gonna come down to

277
00:22:29,642 --> 00:22:30,182
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

278
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,951
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's certainly applicable in the broader sense.

279
00:22:54,991 --> 00:23:06,538
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still massive legions of people, parents that aren't into gaming, and they do add up to that majority of the people that would have gotten the console for their child, teen, anything along those lines.

280
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:10,240
[SPEAKER_05]: And when it comes to the parents, I don't think you can totally count out Wii U either.

281
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:11,459
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not at all.

282
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:13,380
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they have some good games on there.

283
00:23:14,781 --> 00:23:16,442
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you like Nintendo games, it's good.

284
00:23:16,842 --> 00:23:17,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii is going to be great.

285
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:24,066
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're looking for other games from other companies, you may be having some issues.

286
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,127
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll come back to this later.

287
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:36,131
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm just saying, though, as far as Nintendo games go, yeah, it's fantastic because a lot of people look forward to Nintendo games on those consoles.

288
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:37,032
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just...

289
00:23:40,399 --> 00:24:00,318
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know they're kind of in their own thing they don't even want to compete in this next gen and that's why I always kind of laugh when they show okay the next generation is starting they show the Wii I'm like yeah okay whatever but it's just I don't know it'll be interesting to see what happens with all these consoles and stuff but it's just it's a rocky start I think

290
00:24:01,588 --> 00:24:08,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Doom Plague in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says Wii U currently has better games than either new console, just probably not for long.

291
00:24:09,018 --> 00:24:15,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a very good yes, I agree with you point because I would agree.

292
00:24:15,507 --> 00:24:18,972
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Wii U right now has better games than either one of those consoles.

293
00:24:19,432 --> 00:24:22,254
[SPEAKER_05]: But are we going to be able to say the same a year from now?

294
00:24:22,474 --> 00:24:22,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

295
00:24:23,134 --> 00:24:26,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you're going to get some heavy, heavy hitters next year.

296
00:24:26,496 --> 00:24:29,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine, you know, we already know there's going to be Destiny, Titanfall.

297
00:24:30,138 --> 00:24:33,679
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine Microsoft's going to push out their new Halo for next holiday.

298
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:35,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Or at least, you know, you're going to see a lot on that.

299
00:24:35,761 --> 00:24:40,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony, I don't know what they're... They'll probably have a new LittleBigPlanet or something.

300
00:24:40,623 --> 00:24:42,184
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got plenty of stuff they can rely on.

301
00:24:42,364 --> 00:24:46,286
[SPEAKER_03]: All of those games that they had to delay into first or second quarter 2015 that we've been talking about.

302
00:24:46,326 --> 00:24:48,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Uncharted 4 is coming.

303
00:24:48,507 --> 00:25:13,219
[SPEAKER_05]: and then so Nintendo's challenge is going to really be how are they going to stay afloat without all the third party support but they will throw out a new Zelda on Wii U next year I think we're all anticipating that if they don't honestly if they don't do a Zelda on Wii U next year there's going to be a lot of people that are disappointed that's the reality where we're at right now and Smash Brothers

304
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:20,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo has a big 2014 for its namesake titles as does the rollout of the Xbox One and PS4 even Smash Bros.

305
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:41,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I was kind of excited about it for the Wii and stuff but the new one just doesn't really it's kind of like hey look it's the same characters we had last time don't knock it until you see it a little more in motion I don't think we've really seen I mean yes we've had some teasers but you haven't seen the game really in motion getting your hands on it and all that and I think there's a lot to come with that

306
00:25:41,989 --> 00:26:07,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I think back to the Wii one when it was in development you know there was a big difference between the early early stages and hearing about the characters and then like really getting to play that thing you know those Smash Brothers games have a lot of depth to them and there's so much in the in the regards to the unlockables collectibles and all that stuff I just I I really hope they don't rush this Wii U one but it's been in development a hell of a long time so I would think we're gonna be ready in 2014 but we'll see

307
00:26:08,081 --> 00:26:13,785
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyhow, I think that's enough of our kickoff topic of Xbox One and everything else going on.

308
00:26:14,265 --> 00:26:19,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk a little more specifically about what you yourself have been doing in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week?

309
00:26:19,808 --> 00:26:22,770
[SPEAKER_05]: I would usually let ladies go first, but we don't have any tonight.

310
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,432
[SPEAKER_05]: But Jason, since you are sitting in Jamie's chair, go for it.

311
00:26:25,472 --> 00:26:26,412
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your gaming week?

312
00:26:26,912 --> 00:26:28,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been playing a lot of real-life the game.

313
00:26:29,074 --> 00:26:34,737
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a epic training simulator and workout simulator and driving simulator and walking simulator.

314
00:26:34,757 --> 00:26:37,039
[SPEAKER_05]: You even sound like Jamie with that gaming week.

315
00:26:38,896 --> 00:26:46,343
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a really light couple of weeks because I, as I'm sure many people remember, I was here a couple episodes ago.

316
00:26:47,344 --> 00:26:51,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been to Arizona and back in that time I was training a new coworker this week.

317
00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:53,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Incredibly busy times.

318
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:59,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm basically just grinding a little bit more, by which I mean getting completely obliterated by...

319
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:02,437
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

320
00:27:18,668 --> 00:27:21,869
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't just come out last week, but I noticed within the past month or so.

321
00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:23,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Since the last time you were on, I think.

322
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:35,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just casual grinding of games with a very defined start and end, and are also very friendly to just stop what I'm doing wherever I am with no penalty to speak of.

323
00:27:36,672 --> 00:27:40,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's honestly really about all I've had time for this past week.

324
00:27:41,107 --> 00:27:41,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Dexter Dexter

325
00:28:03,257 --> 00:28:07,379
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just trying to take a break from Grand Theft Auto for a little bit.

326
00:28:07,499 --> 00:28:12,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go back into it, obviously, really soon.

327
00:28:14,163 --> 00:28:18,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, I know the new Steam sale is coming up soon, and I'm like...

328
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:20,097
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

329
00:28:49,652 --> 00:28:50,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry, yeah, yeah.

330
00:28:50,952 --> 00:28:53,153
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, you can get all that.

331
00:28:54,473 --> 00:28:54,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked that up.

332
00:28:55,014 --> 00:28:57,654
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't played it yet, but I was very excited to see that in there.

333
00:28:57,874 --> 00:29:01,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't recall all the details, but I stumbled across something the other day.

334
00:29:01,235 --> 00:29:03,376
[SPEAKER_03]: It was basically a make-your-own Humble Bundle.

335
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they launched the store now.

336
00:29:06,197 --> 00:29:08,337
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of different websites that have it.

337
00:29:08,397 --> 00:29:13,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've seen the improvements that Humble Bundle has been rolling out in that regard, but I thought it was something unique.

338
00:29:13,979 --> 00:29:14,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

339
00:29:15,899 --> 00:29:16,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.

340
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,363
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I came across it.

341
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:21,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I don't have time and I don't have money.

342
00:29:21,688 --> 00:29:21,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

343
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,570
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I didn't take in enough of the details.

344
00:29:24,204 --> 00:29:24,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Loki.

345
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:28,107
[SPEAKER_06]: No, there's a bunch of different Humble Bundle-esque sites.

346
00:29:29,288 --> 00:29:30,509
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one of them that does that.

347
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

348
00:29:32,511 --> 00:29:33,732
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, so that's pretty much that.

349
00:29:34,112 --> 00:29:39,477
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've just been messing around with Clicker today just because, I don't know, I'm just bored.

350
00:29:40,017 --> 00:29:48,264
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't start Fallout right now because it's in the middle of the show and this doesn't take any intelligence at all other than clicking a mouse.

351
00:29:48,384 --> 00:29:51,487
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, that's pretty much where I've been.

352
00:29:51,952 --> 00:29:54,475
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, I've been very busy with a couple new games.

353
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:59,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing the usual stuff as well, including, you know, helping Alan and stuff.

354
00:29:59,861 --> 00:30:03,745
[SPEAKER_05]: But this Friday, obviously, was the release of the Xbox One.

355
00:30:04,085 --> 00:30:06,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel the same way about the one that I do about the PlayStation 4.

356
00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:08,730
[SPEAKER_05]: The games aren't there for me right now.

357
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:12,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Next year, I'm probably going to have to pick up both because you're going to have things like...

358
00:30:13,415 --> 00:30:35,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XIV and Destiny on PlayStation 4 things I definitely want over there and then on Xbox One I'm sure they'll announce Forza Horizon 2 which will be enough for me to want to get an Xbox One so I'll get those in 2014 but for now being a Wii U owner I was very excited about the release of Super Mario 3D World on the Nintendo Wii and Wii U thank you yes Wii U

359
00:30:36,880 --> 00:31:02,259
[SPEAKER_05]: and I will tell you this the game delivers it's it's outstanding I I love it it's it's what you would kind of expect I don't think it really like to me it feels a lot different than 3d land on the 3ds did because obviously for one it's not really in 3d but for two I think just the larger screen the more diverse characters I feel like there's kind of more going on in each stage because of it

360
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:10,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna tell you the thing I like most about Mario 3D World is the attention to detail and it's the little things that really make that game.

361
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:18,222
[SPEAKER_05]: The things from you get really close to a Goomba and the Goomba spots you and makes angry Goomba face and starts charging at you.

362
00:31:18,742 --> 00:31:44,558
[SPEAKER_05]: or when you step on a turtle and there's that literal moment you can actually see the little koopa of the whole like where'd my pants go type of thing and running over to try to get the shell as fast as they can to the little sound when you walk on a glass you hear the clink clink clink clink when you're actually walking on glass pipes to when you're underwater the background music actually changes completely to when you come back above the water it goes back to where it was at to when you're kitty Mario

363
00:31:45,618 --> 00:32:11,085
[SPEAKER_05]: which really is the best thing ever that was a great power-up love it when you're climbing up a wall and you go as far as you can because you can't just climb the wall infinitely finally you get to a certain point where you can't climb anymore and they're just like they claw onto the wall and they start slipping and they leave little claw marks behind like as they're falling and look really sad like it's those little details that really do it for me and yeah I mean the level design obviously is great

364
00:32:11,605 --> 00:32:18,129
[SPEAKER_05]: There's things to collect in every level, so just because you beat it once doesn't mean you're going to collect all three green stars and the stamp and everything.

365
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,531
[SPEAKER_05]: The social elements are very interesting.

366
00:32:21,571 --> 00:32:30,697
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we give Nintendo a hard time about not understanding online, but the way they've integrated Miiverse into this and the ghost Miis and everything is interesting.

367
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:34,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in some ways it's kind of give or take.

368
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:46,423
[SPEAKER_05]: But just to kind of give you an example, while you're walking around the world map, you'll see these random Miis on the map, and if you walk up to them, they'll have a little picture of something they wrote on Miiverse about that world.

369
00:32:47,003 --> 00:32:57,266
[SPEAKER_05]: When you beat a stage, you'll actually see, scrolling across the top of the screen, Miiverse posts from people who also played that stage and posted something about it on Miiverse.

370
00:32:57,906 --> 00:33:00,867
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll give you an example of how this can work, is that...

371
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I was playing a level in World 3 not long ago.

372
00:33:04,009 --> 00:33:08,473
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a water level, and we all love water levels, but they're a necessary part of any Mario game, right?

373
00:33:08,873 --> 00:33:11,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And I couldn't find two of the stars in the level.

374
00:33:11,495 --> 00:33:13,397
[SPEAKER_05]: I could find the last one, but I couldn't find the first two.

375
00:33:13,837 --> 00:33:21,483
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I beat the level, it shows me all the Miiverse posts, and one of the first ones that comes up is, Where are the first and second stars?

376
00:33:21,543 --> 00:33:23,645
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, thank God it's not just me.

377
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,627
[SPEAKER_05]: That was literally my reaction, right?

378
00:33:25,947 --> 00:33:28,809
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was kind of, I don't know, that was a neat reaction.

379
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:44,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't think of that I get in any other game right now and I'm not saying it's like a huge deal or a game changer or OMG Nintendo's pushing the envelope but I will say that was a unique reaction that immediate instant feedback that I can't say I get anywhere else right now.

380
00:33:44,657 --> 00:33:48,178
[SPEAKER_03]: That instant attachment to another individual somewhere out there in the universe.

381
00:33:48,218 --> 00:33:48,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Me too!

382
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:49,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Me too!

383
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:53,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Stranger Danger 10357 or whatever your name is, right?

384
00:33:54,121 --> 00:33:59,243
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there was that instance where I did kind of feel like oh okay, so I'm not the only crazy one.

385
00:34:00,023 --> 00:34:16,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a very interesting case to think about the fact that, yeah, Nintendo is not necessarily getting the always-on, multi-world, MMO, universe-style network services, but they're pushing a really damn good community.

386
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:20,351
[SPEAKER_03]: And as long as they keep up the moderator actions and filtering... It's moderated.

387
00:34:20,531 --> 00:34:21,891
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a moderated community.

388
00:34:22,532 --> 00:34:22,612
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

389
00:34:23,912 --> 00:34:31,515
[SPEAKER_05]: That works and it doesn't work because again, you know, we criticized Nintendo last week about the whole swap note thing, which I think was completely valid.

390
00:34:31,895 --> 00:34:34,616
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was ridiculous the way they threw the baby out with the bathwater with that.

391
00:34:35,036 --> 00:34:50,583
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, there's a difference between these type of public communications you have in a game like Mario, you know, Super Mario 3D World and the private communications where essentially if, you know, me and a friend are both over the age of 18, we should be able to send whatever we want because we could do it on an email anyway.

392
00:34:50,703 --> 00:34:50,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

393
00:34:50,983 --> 00:34:51,603
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so.

394
00:34:52,004 --> 00:34:58,407
[SPEAKER_03]: These emotions and expressions that they're capturing in the public eye is quite unique and very worthy and very fun to see.

395
00:34:59,777 --> 00:35:26,417
[SPEAKER_05]: level design again have I mentioned how great the level design is in the game because I will tell you what also in world 3 there's a level and this might be a minor spoiler so mute for about 60 seconds if you don't want to hear it I don't think it's a big deal but some people are nutso about spoilers so mute it if you don't want to hear it there's a level in the third world that invokes Mario Kart like right on down to the level actually looks like a Mario circuit track and you're running over these little dash squares that was so much fun to play

396
00:35:27,438 --> 00:35:55,660
[SPEAKER_05]: and I didn't even play it in multiplayer which can you imagine I've only played this game in single player but the whole thing is designed for four people to play and I can only imagine what a riot some of these games are in multiplayer and some of these levels and so forth one of the things that I hear about the game is that whoever does the best in a level wears a little crown in the next level so you know people are going to be trying to steal that crown and pick on the player who has the crown and I'm sure it makes for amazing

397
00:35:57,401 --> 00:36:24,689
[SPEAKER_05]: multiplayer experiences but I have yet to do those so anyway Mario 3D World if you are a Wii U owner I don't know why you don't have this game yet you need to make it a priority to get your hands on this game because it is the best Wii U game available now I already thought the one they released last year was pretty good but this one blows it out of the water it really does this is great so Mario 3D World is a must have if you're a Wii U owner is it a system seller?

398
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,092
[SPEAKER_05]: If you like Nintendo systems, yeah.

399
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:29,972
[SPEAKER_05]: It's getting there.

400
00:36:30,493 --> 00:36:31,474
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely getting there.

401
00:36:31,654 --> 00:36:37,118
[SPEAKER_05]: It's yet another game now where it's like, alright, now Wii U is starting to really build up that library.

402
00:36:37,378 --> 00:36:47,045
[SPEAKER_05]: If I drop the money on a Wii U, now I have two solid Mario games, Zombie U, Nintendo Land, maybe Wonderful 101 if you're into that, or Pikmin.

403
00:36:47,065 --> 00:36:52,849
[SPEAKER_05]: It is strengthening Nintendo's library, but is it going to be a system seller?

404
00:36:53,369 --> 00:36:55,291
[SPEAKER_05]: It really depends on what type of games you're into.

405
00:36:56,011 --> 00:37:22,818
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a real bummer Mario Kart 8 didn't make it this year because I think and I'm all for take the time to get it right and also that's part of how they're going to make 2014 not feel like the desert that 2013 was but I think if Mario Kart 8 had come out and it was solid and they were able to deliver that one-two punch on the Wii U I would be like you gotta buy a Wii U because there's all these games now but with only the

406
00:37:23,278 --> 00:37:33,515
[SPEAKER_05]: one huge great game it's a little harder to say because I think you really have to say like how much do I want to play Mario 3D World but I'm telling you it's really good

407
00:37:35,251 --> 00:37:44,395
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um... The other Nintendo game I happened to pick up this week, I actually went and bought a 3DS XL because I'm that big of a whore for 2D Zelda.

408
00:37:45,195 --> 00:37:49,757
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love Link to the Past, so of course I was all over Link Between Worlds.

409
00:37:49,797 --> 00:37:52,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, I've seen the stories about how it's really 3D and all this stuff.

410
00:37:53,019 --> 00:37:53,579
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean.

411
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,780
[SPEAKER_05]: It still plays like Link to the Past and all that.

412
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:04,024
[SPEAKER_05]: So I bought a new Zelda 3DS XL, which has the Triforce, the, you know, high rule and low rule Triforces on it, and I've been playing the game, and I...

413
00:38:05,505 --> 00:38:07,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

414
00:38:23,499 --> 00:38:24,799
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on and so on.

415
00:38:51,724 --> 00:38:54,825
[SPEAKER_05]: I also have to hand it to the team that created this.

416
00:38:55,325 --> 00:38:57,446
[SPEAKER_05]: The 3D effects are great.

417
00:38:58,286 --> 00:39:12,250
[SPEAKER_05]: And considering a lot of us thought Nintendo was abandoning 3D when they released the 2DS, it was quite pleasing to see a 3D game that really benefits from having the 3D switch on if you are into viewing the 3D and everything.

418
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:15,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Like just from the little creatures jumping, the little...

419
00:39:16,631 --> 00:39:17,272
[SPEAKER_05]: What were their names?

420
00:39:17,332 --> 00:39:18,793
[SPEAKER_05]: The Octoroks shoot the rocks, right?

421
00:39:18,813 --> 00:39:20,594
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the little jumping spider things called?

422
00:39:20,635 --> 00:39:21,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Tektites?

423
00:39:21,055 --> 00:39:21,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Were those Tektites?

424
00:39:21,535 --> 00:39:21,815
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

425
00:39:21,835 --> 00:39:26,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Those guys that jump up and you actually kind of see that in 3D is great.

426
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,843
[SPEAKER_05]: When you jump off a cliff, you see that little 3D kind of enhancement.

427
00:39:31,564 --> 00:39:37,208
[SPEAKER_05]: You definitely see it in dungeons when, you know, you're on a level, but there's like an upstairs and a downstairs within the same level.

428
00:39:37,468 --> 00:39:40,431
[SPEAKER_05]: You definitely get a sense of that 3D effect and it's done tastefully.

429
00:39:41,091 --> 00:39:41,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

430
00:39:41,952 --> 00:39:43,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's great.

431
00:39:43,513 --> 00:39:48,675
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've heard a lot of talk about how, well, it's really weird that you can kind of rent everything from the shop in the beginning.

432
00:39:50,195 --> 00:39:51,476
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a different way of doing it.

433
00:39:51,776 --> 00:39:53,416
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't really change things for me.

434
00:39:53,677 --> 00:39:56,958
[SPEAKER_05]: There's still definitely points and things that you get in the dungeons.

435
00:39:57,939 --> 00:40:00,721
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be ways that you will want to play things in a certain order.

436
00:40:01,202 --> 00:40:03,344
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't really bothered by the rental system at all.

437
00:40:03,624 --> 00:40:04,145
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

438
00:40:04,325 --> 00:40:13,695
[SPEAKER_05]: It also helps differentiate it from Link to the Past and make it its own game, which is one of the better Zelda games that will be out there in the franchise for sure.

439
00:40:15,657 --> 00:40:20,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma says, Zelda A Link Between Worlds is essentially a Link to the Past second quest.

440
00:40:20,842 --> 00:40:21,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't agree with you.

441
00:40:22,203 --> 00:40:30,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they've changed enough where it... Especially once you get that ability where you can actually kind of glue yourself to walls and walk around and all that.

442
00:40:30,968 --> 00:40:34,170
[SPEAKER_05]: It really changes a lot of the puzzles and so forth.

443
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:36,711
[SPEAKER_05]: And just such the graphical upgrade and everything.

444
00:40:37,211 --> 00:40:39,072
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I would call it a second quest.

445
00:40:39,693 --> 00:40:39,813
[SPEAKER_05]: It's...

446
00:40:41,274 --> 00:40:41,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

447
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:42,616
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like I said earlier.

448
00:40:42,636 --> 00:40:44,458
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like revisiting an old friend.

449
00:40:44,578 --> 00:40:45,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there elements of Link to the Past?

450
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:46,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

451
00:40:46,941 --> 00:40:51,186
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is definitely its own game and it is worth the price that they're asking for it.

452
00:40:51,226 --> 00:40:52,308
[SPEAKER_05]: The $40 or whatever.

453
00:40:53,129 --> 00:40:54,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know because I bought the bundle.

454
00:40:54,491 --> 00:40:55,011
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's what?

455
00:40:55,031 --> 00:40:55,452
[SPEAKER_05]: $40 retail, Loki?

456
00:40:56,753 --> 00:40:58,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's worth it.

457
00:40:59,294 --> 00:40:59,654
[SPEAKER_05]: There it goes.

458
00:41:01,154 --> 00:41:01,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

459
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:02,395
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to look at our chat room.

460
00:41:02,415 --> 00:41:06,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I was talking so much I have been falling behind on our chat room.

461
00:41:06,076 --> 00:41:06,796
[SPEAKER_03]: He was fanboying.

462
00:41:07,056 --> 00:41:07,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, a little bit.

463
00:41:07,977 --> 00:41:08,477
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit.

464
00:41:08,537 --> 00:41:13,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, you know, it's funny because I've been accused of the whole Nintendo fanboy thing, which whatever.

465
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:14,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to like what I like.

466
00:41:15,399 --> 00:41:19,345
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I'd like to think I'm also critical of Nintendo when they need it too.

467
00:41:19,906 --> 00:41:30,923
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and, you know, the whole online thing last week and the fact that, you know, yes, Super Mario World, Super Mario 3D World is great, but is it going to be enough to really push the Wii U's this year?

468
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:32,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

469
00:41:33,711 --> 00:41:34,031
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

470
00:41:34,051 --> 00:41:37,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Nintendo really needed that one other game, but we'll see.

471
00:41:37,334 --> 00:41:37,674
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

472
00:41:38,355 --> 00:41:41,778
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm rooting for them, though, but I'm rooting for Microsoft and Sony as well.

473
00:41:41,918 --> 00:41:42,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that so wrong?

474
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:45,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Aren't I allowed to like all the games?

475
00:41:46,721 --> 00:41:48,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Is something wrong with me?

476
00:41:49,143 --> 00:41:49,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything.

477
00:41:49,984 --> 00:41:50,785
[SPEAKER_03]: So says the internet.

478
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:57,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I'll complain about things that need complaining about, but I'm going to cheer on the things that need cheering of.

479
00:41:57,954 --> 00:42:02,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And these Mario and Zelda games are accomplishments that are worthy of the cheering.

480
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:04,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

481
00:42:05,836 --> 00:42:12,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's see, live.vognetwork.com TigerClaw says, Zelda becomes shorter if you have the guide for it.

482
00:42:12,657 --> 00:42:13,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Try playing without one.

483
00:42:13,677 --> 00:42:15,538
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll spend hours trying to figure stuff out.

484
00:42:15,578 --> 00:42:17,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, couldn't that be said about any game?

485
00:42:17,898 --> 00:42:21,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you use the guide, you're gonna have all the puzzles answered for you.

486
00:42:22,279 --> 00:42:27,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Zelda does have an interesting system in it where you can use the play coins that you get from walking around on the 3DS.

487
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,780
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use those to buy hints from a ghost.

488
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you get these little glasses in the beginning, hint glasses, and you can use them to buy hints.

489
00:42:35,561 --> 00:42:46,534
[SPEAKER_05]: so up to you if you want to use them or not I think that's interesting some people will probably get really turned off by that but then I just say don't equip them and then they won't be there so um

490
00:42:48,143 --> 00:42:48,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

491
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:52,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Also looking for some more chats at live.vognetwork.com.

492
00:42:53,064 --> 00:42:58,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft says, I'm forgetting Zelda Wind Waker HD, Rayman Legends, and some other games.

493
00:42:59,066 --> 00:42:59,566
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.

494
00:42:59,706 --> 00:43:03,827
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably am forgetting those games, but let's also not kid ourselves.

495
00:43:03,927 --> 00:43:08,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Both those games you mentioned are available on other consoles, especially in the case of Rayman Legends.

496
00:43:09,168 --> 00:43:15,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the game was developed for Wii U, and it's probably best on Wii U, but the reality is it's not exclusive to Wii U anymore.

497
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:36,726
[SPEAKER_05]: uh Zelda Wind Waker HD I haven't played that yet I'm very much looking forward to it but I even if the game is outstanding which I'm sure it's great it's really hard to call a reimagining of a GameCube game something that's going to really sell a lot of consoles although maybe it did for some people I don't know maybe I'm being too hard on it

498
00:43:38,604 --> 00:43:42,065
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the earlier Zelda release on the Wii U. Yeah, you did.

499
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:45,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Taste tester before... Or it's the only Wii U release.

500
00:43:45,825 --> 00:43:46,405
[SPEAKER_03]: What am I saying?

501
00:43:46,525 --> 00:43:47,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Link Between Worlds is 3DS.

502
00:43:47,966 --> 00:43:48,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, right.

503
00:43:48,406 --> 00:43:52,346
[SPEAKER_05]: It was also extremely quickly put together.

504
00:43:52,366 --> 00:43:53,487
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not saying that in a bad way.

505
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,827
[SPEAKER_05]: From what I understand, everybody that I know that's played it really loves it.

506
00:43:56,347 --> 00:43:58,587
[SPEAKER_05]: But they essentially threw it together.

507
00:43:59,248 --> 00:44:01,148
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not sure how to take that.

508
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:04,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I guess that's a good thing that you can put out a quality product so fast.

509
00:44:04,468 --> 00:44:06,629
[SPEAKER_05]: But they did have to reimagine an old game to do it.

510
00:44:07,109 --> 00:44:07,329
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

511
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:33,998
[SPEAKER_05]: um but you're right I shouldn't totally count out when Waker HD is something that is available there are going to be you know the game is 10 years old there are going to be a lot of people out there especially in their teens that probably never touched the first game so you know anyway all right uh I've I've gushed enough about new Mario new Zelda but I'm telling you they're great and honestly is there an Xbox One or PlayStation 4 launch game as good as Mario 3D World

512
00:44:35,778 --> 00:44:36,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I doubt it.

513
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:38,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I highly, highly doubt it.

514
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, a year from now, will we be able to say the same thing?

515
00:44:43,422 --> 00:44:43,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not.

516
00:44:44,443 --> 00:44:46,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Wii U also came out a year ago.

517
00:44:46,404 --> 00:44:48,365
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a year to make this game, or more.

518
00:44:48,845 --> 00:44:57,450
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'm sure a year from now it'll be a different story, but I'm telling you, this really makes this whole next-gen console war... I'm using my little quotey fingers...

519
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:02,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to consider the holiday season starting on September 17th, but that's just me.

520
00:45:17,205 --> 00:45:20,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I have to mention, of course, Grand Theft Auto 5.

521
00:45:21,226 --> 00:45:22,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Which you haven't played yet.

522
00:45:23,067 --> 00:45:26,868
[SPEAKER_05]: But I recognize that a lot of people are going to call that the game of the year.

523
00:45:28,188 --> 00:45:34,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's in the show world tonight, but those Spike TV award things that they announce a lot of games at.

524
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:34,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, VGX.

525
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Bioshock Infinite Bioshock Infinite

526
00:45:54,687 --> 00:45:55,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Depends what kind of games you're into.

527
00:45:56,049 --> 00:45:56,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

528
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:58,292
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a popularity contest.

529
00:45:58,312 --> 00:45:58,833
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a little bit.

530
00:45:58,953 --> 00:46:01,696
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I saw Tomb Raider in there, too, which was a pleasant surprise.

531
00:46:01,756 --> 00:46:07,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Tomb Raider's great and a good kick in the butt for the franchise, so I was happy to see that in there.

532
00:46:07,504 --> 00:46:09,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Did anybody else remember what else was in there?

533
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:09,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe our chatters do.

534
00:46:10,088 --> 00:46:11,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Live.vognetwork.com.

535
00:46:13,117 --> 00:46:13,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

536
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:39,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, there's so many hours.

537
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:43,733
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of one of the reasons I'm like, do I really want to start Fallout New Vegas?

538
00:46:43,753 --> 00:46:46,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Skyrim, holy shit, did that take off a lot of my time.

539
00:46:46,996 --> 00:46:49,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

540
00:46:49,858 --> 00:46:58,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of those games, Loki, when they inevitably announced Elder Scrolls 6 for next generation consoles, will you be on board?

541
00:46:58,506 --> 00:46:59,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, you'll be like, it's on PC.

542
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:01,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I can mod it on PC.

543
00:47:02,709 --> 00:47:05,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I might actually... I don't blame you, I don't blame you.

544
00:47:06,417 --> 00:47:06,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

545
00:47:21,966 --> 00:47:37,279
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw having that same thought at live.vognetwork.com what if they announce Elder Scrolls 6 for next gen not before the next Fallout because it kind of seems like they're going in that pattern Elder Scrolls 6 is not coming for another couple years at least because they have also online which is at some point

546
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:48,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I think is good news because I think they need some time to... Again, the games that came out right during the launch window, a little bit not the full potential of the system.

547
00:47:48,704 --> 00:47:53,266
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the more time that Elder Scrolls 6 has to incubate a little bit, I think that's actually a good thing.

548
00:47:53,646 --> 00:47:54,786
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want it right away.

549
00:47:55,587 --> 00:47:58,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Trust me, it's a good thing.

550
00:47:59,629 --> 00:48:00,589
[SPEAKER_05]: There is that part of me.

551
00:48:00,629 --> 00:48:01,509
[SPEAKER_05]: And here is where...

552
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:03,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Mass Effect 4 Mass Effect 4?

553
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:04,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, what if it's current gen?

554
00:48:28,544 --> 00:48:29,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

555
00:48:44,335 --> 00:48:46,217
[SPEAKER_05]: I play Mass Effect 3 multiplayer on PC myself and it's great.

556
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:47,018
[SPEAKER_05]: So I could just keep the PC.

557
00:48:47,038 --> 00:48:47,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I think for me though, having that

558
00:49:01,892 --> 00:49:27,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Graphic and my first experience with Mass Effect was on the Xbox 360 so I still associated my mind with consoles I just kind of think for me Mass Effect 4 is only going to sweeten the pot for the next gen consoles it's not really going to be the reason I get a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One or whatever but it's just I'm just going to be like just add that to the list of why just put that in all caps there in the pro column Mass Effect 4 right there so

559
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:29,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

560
00:49:30,492 --> 00:49:35,839
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm saying Mass Effect 4 but whatever they end up calling it because obviously the Shepard series is over.

561
00:49:35,859 --> 00:49:36,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Y'all know what I mean.

562
00:49:37,081 --> 00:49:37,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Y'all know what I meant.

563
00:49:40,264 --> 00:49:40,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

564
00:49:40,765 --> 00:49:45,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com BlackWolf says, I just don't want to see Sky on a table.

565
00:49:45,411 --> 00:49:46,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Well then don't come to the mall with me.

566
00:49:49,075 --> 00:49:53,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get into some housekeeping and then we'll do gaming news of course.

567
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Just real quick, don't forget you can follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

568
00:49:58,164 --> 00:50:03,229
[SPEAKER_05]: We are also available on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google+.

569
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:07,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

570
00:50:07,093 --> 00:50:09,936
[SPEAKER_05]: We finally got one of those short URLs like a lot of people are getting now.

571
00:50:10,676 --> 00:50:14,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I think this is something we're going to do starting this week.

572
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, thanks to Jason's help, I was able to get the keys to the YouTube channel back.

573
00:50:20,224 --> 00:50:23,847
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are going to look at posting episodes of Orange Launch Radio on YouTube.

574
00:50:25,748 --> 00:50:29,391
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not Orange Launch Video all of a sudden, so that is not something that's going to be there.

575
00:50:29,771 --> 00:50:33,014
[SPEAKER_05]: It will just be the audio with a static picture.

576
00:50:33,754 --> 00:50:35,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe at a later date we could...

577
00:50:36,616 --> 00:51:01,848
[SPEAKER_05]: if we talk about screenshots we can enhance the videos of that or something it depends how well received the YouTube thing is this is just a crazy experiment we have to try to get the show out to more people because YouTube does have a very big audience I think the show can get more exposure so hello to all you YouTubers and thanks for checking out the show depending on how well the show is received on YouTube we might see what else we can kind of do to enhance the show that way

578
00:51:02,548 --> 00:51:06,130
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, right now it's just about trying to get the show out there.

579
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:10,792
[SPEAKER_05]: And plus the news that YouTube is coming to things like the 3DS.

580
00:51:11,172 --> 00:51:12,892
[SPEAKER_05]: YouTube's available on the Vita.

581
00:51:13,513 --> 00:51:18,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything that is another way that people can easily listen to OLR, we want to get in on that.

582
00:51:18,315 --> 00:51:21,336
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is coming, I think, starting this week.

583
00:51:21,376 --> 00:51:24,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this very episode will go up on YouTube if everything goes in my favor.

584
00:51:25,177 --> 00:51:25,618
[SPEAKER_05]: So there we go.

585
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:27,598
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

586
00:51:28,538 --> 00:51:29,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

587
00:51:30,259 --> 00:51:34,620
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, you ever played around with Google Hangout?

588
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:35,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

589
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Perhaps you can try doing OLR with it.

590
00:51:37,481 --> 00:51:38,661
[SPEAKER_05]: It would archive to YouTube.

591
00:51:39,101 --> 00:51:39,321
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

592
00:51:41,081 --> 00:51:42,062
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be honest.

593
00:51:42,202 --> 00:51:44,742
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe I'm just being a stickler with this.

594
00:51:45,382 --> 00:51:47,043
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't interesting to watch.

595
00:51:48,604 --> 00:51:52,286
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all just sitting around a table with our microphones in hand.

596
00:51:52,306 --> 00:51:54,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm not interested in watching any of this.

597
00:51:55,567 --> 00:51:57,208
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really not that interesting to watch.

598
00:51:57,568 --> 00:52:04,891
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would need a director to sit here with us if we were to push video to its full potential.

599
00:52:04,911 --> 00:52:10,654
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess my point I'm trying to get at is if we make that jump to video, I kind of don't want it to be like half-assed.

600
00:52:11,014 --> 00:52:17,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I want somebody to actually be able to, if we talk about a game, throw up the B-roll footage of the game, be able to show that there.

601
00:52:17,797 --> 00:52:21,219
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just kind of too much for us to be able to put out right now.

602
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:37,607
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, and I've been on this show for many, I think this show is best consumed, listen to it in the background while you play video games, or while you chat in our chat room, or while you're at work doing whatever data entry or writing or whatever it is you do that doesn't require you to be listening at work right now.

603
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:46,596
[SPEAKER_05]: I think our show is best consumed that way I think if you were to sit here and watch Talking Heads for three hours talk about video games that would be the most boring thing in the world to me

604
00:52:47,932 --> 00:52:48,713
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's just my thought.

605
00:52:49,053 --> 00:52:50,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Convince me I'm wrong.

606
00:52:50,394 --> 00:52:52,015
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe I am just being stubborn.

607
00:52:52,075 --> 00:52:55,617
[SPEAKER_05]: And keep in mind, I've done radio for the past 10 plus years.

608
00:52:55,697 --> 00:52:58,139
[SPEAKER_05]: So this just might be my old fuddy-duddy way of thought.

609
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:00,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Convince me I'm wrong.

610
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:00,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all ears.

611
00:53:01,241 --> 00:53:02,482
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been wrong before.

612
00:53:02,642 --> 00:53:03,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Lord knows.

613
00:53:04,743 --> 00:53:05,023
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

614
00:53:07,725 --> 00:53:10,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into gaming news tonight.

615
00:53:10,827 --> 00:53:11,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that that's all out of the way.

616
00:53:13,746 --> 00:53:14,206
[SPEAKER_03]: One hour in.

617
00:53:14,287 --> 00:53:14,827
[SPEAKER_05]: One hour in.

618
00:53:32,941 --> 00:53:33,221
[SPEAKER_02]: For us.

619
00:53:33,662 --> 00:53:33,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

620
00:53:33,942 --> 00:53:34,382
[SPEAKER_03]: For this show.

621
00:53:34,562 --> 00:53:34,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

622
00:53:34,782 --> 00:53:36,844
[SPEAKER_05]: You do what works for you.

623
00:53:36,924 --> 00:53:37,664
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will say this.

624
00:53:37,744 --> 00:53:41,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Google Hangout is a great way to produce a podcast.

625
00:53:41,687 --> 00:53:42,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Super easy.

626
00:53:43,108 --> 00:53:43,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Super easy.

627
00:53:44,228 --> 00:53:47,931
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am all for more voices getting out there and more people being heard.

628
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:51,253
[SPEAKER_05]: So if Google Hangout's the way you do that, go for it.

629
00:53:51,733 --> 00:53:52,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

630
00:53:54,335 --> 00:53:59,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I will brace myself for the angry emails I'm sure to incur from all that, but know that I am trying to be well-intentioned.

631
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:01,100
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Loki.

632
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:17,891
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so like with any console launch, there's a little bit of hiccups usually with console launches, and that was definitely the case of the PlayStation 4 with the random blinking blue light of doom or whatever you want to call it.

633
00:54:18,231 --> 00:54:24,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now the Xbox One is also running into similar issues, except no blinking lights this time around.

634
00:54:24,977 --> 00:54:36,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead, it's the sound... Yes, much like the Xbox 360, except at least it's not actually carving a nice ring into your disc this time.

635
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:40,271
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just making a grinding noise and not reading discs.

636
00:54:40,471 --> 00:54:42,593
[SPEAKER_06]: And so people are running into those issues.

637
00:54:43,774 --> 00:54:44,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

638
00:55:00,795 --> 00:55:01,235
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

639
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:16,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, the console's only been out a few days, so it's hard to say how widespread anything is, but I think it's important for Microsoft at this point to do some damage control.

640
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:24,687
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw their response, which is basically, hey, if you have an issue with your system, call the customer support, blah, blah, blah, blah.

641
00:55:25,648 --> 00:55:27,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's very...

642
00:55:31,184 --> 00:55:31,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

643
00:55:31,584 --> 00:55:48,616
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very scripted of you to say that and instead addressing how many units might be affected versus last week when a similar situation was happening where different systems were breaking or DOA from Sony, you heard...

644
00:55:49,597 --> 00:55:50,157
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

645
00:56:08,466 --> 00:56:16,411
[SPEAKER_06]: I think right there that's addressing everything instead of, you know, not commenting on it and letting everyone speculate how bad the issue is.

646
00:56:16,492 --> 00:56:24,297
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm worried that, I mean, and I don't want to sound doom and gloom, but I'm worried that it may be a little bit more widespread than it seems.

647
00:56:24,737 --> 00:56:37,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully it's not because I would hope that, you know, they would test their hardware, you know, well and figure out that these problems, hopefully, you know, some sort of bad run on these disk drives or something.

648
00:56:40,228 --> 00:56:43,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Be wary at console launches that you're going to run into issues.

649
00:56:45,171 --> 00:56:51,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of a fair warning for any console launch that there's going to be speed bumps.

650
00:56:51,916 --> 00:56:54,818
[SPEAKER_05]: But we don't think this is as bad as the Red Ring of Death yet.

651
00:56:55,699 --> 00:56:56,760
[SPEAKER_06]: So far, yeah.

652
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Not as big of an issue, but we'll see.

653
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:00,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Time will tell.

654
00:57:00,723 --> 00:57:02,244
[SPEAKER_06]: And really, once again, it's...

655
00:57:03,866 --> 00:57:24,120
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, see how they respond to it, you know, how they, I think it would be nice if they came out and said something similar to what Sony said, where it's like, hey, listen, it's only this, it's not a widespread thing, we've only received, you know, you know, it's .04% or whatever, you know, compared to the system, you know, it's within standards, this is what, you know, we were expecting.

656
00:57:26,081 --> 00:57:29,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wish there was more coming from them other than very scripted, you know.

657
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:31,625
[SPEAKER_06]: To be fair, this is what we were expecting.

658
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it going to work if I'm one of those people?

659
00:57:34,206 --> 00:57:40,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Not what we were expecting, but it's within regular electronics yields as far as defectives go.

660
00:57:40,531 --> 00:57:43,133
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's such a low percentage that...

661
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:47,562
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like they're making it easy at least on the Microsoft side.

662
00:57:47,582 --> 00:57:54,285
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about Sony's side, but on the Microsoft side, they just ship you a new one and then you have to ship the old one back in two weeks or you get charged.

663
00:57:54,445 --> 00:57:55,026
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they're doing.

664
00:57:55,046 --> 00:57:56,106
[SPEAKER_05]: They make it easy.

665
00:57:56,226 --> 00:57:58,768
[SPEAKER_05]: That's easier than the 360 replacement was, to be honest.

666
00:57:59,108 --> 00:57:59,768
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's great.

667
00:57:59,808 --> 00:58:00,949
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad that they're doing that.

668
00:58:01,189 --> 00:58:02,650
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's what they need to do.

669
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:04,591
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, I think that they need to...

670
00:58:05,271 --> 00:58:31,332
[SPEAKER_06]: especially come on Microsoft you need to know like after all of the fallout and stuff from even when you're announcing the Xbox One stuff I think you need to talk more to your customers more directly and not sound like it's some scripted PR thing make it more candid I guess interesting kind of two good comments in the chat room but a little different Gene at live.vognetwork.com says damage control will freak out and make it a bigger deal though

671
00:58:32,293 --> 00:58:35,335
[SPEAKER_05]: It could have that effect where... It didn't seem like that was the effect, though.

672
00:58:35,435 --> 00:58:36,556
[SPEAKER_05]: The media would pick up on that.

673
00:58:37,176 --> 00:58:40,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Tal says, if they acknowledge it, the problem will disappear.

674
00:58:40,118 --> 00:58:42,540
[SPEAKER_05]: If they attempt to deny and deny, then the issue will balloon.

675
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:49,184
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're just not... I mean, all they're doing is just saying, hey, you have a defective system, contact customer support.

676
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:53,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I could have figured that out without reading anything from them.

677
00:58:53,907 --> 00:58:56,769
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like, oh, well, shit, I don't know what to do with this console.

678
00:58:57,469 --> 00:59:01,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on, if you're buying an Xbox console, you know what to do with your console if it's going to be broken.

679
00:59:02,279 --> 00:59:08,105
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying because, you know, especially if you bought it launched last year or not last year, last time around.

680
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:09,026
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

681
00:59:09,066 --> 00:59:14,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, to be fair, you know, we're talking about Xbox One problems, but PlayStation 4 also had problems.

682
00:59:14,431 --> 00:59:15,352
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk about those.

683
00:59:16,613 --> 00:59:23,480
[SPEAKER_05]: And Sony talked about in an interview with Engadget this week exactly where those numbers are at, which Loki referred to a minute ago.

684
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:34,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Quote, the number of effective PlayStation 4 systems is less than 1%, which represents a very small percentage of total units shipped to date and is within the expected range for a new product introduction.

685
00:59:34,685 --> 00:59:36,266
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's almost exactly what you were saying, Loki.

686
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:45,311
[SPEAKER_05]: We understand the frustration of consumers that have had a problem and are working with them and our retail partners to help troubleshoot issues and ensure affected units are exchanged.

687
00:59:45,571 --> 00:59:46,011
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know...

688
00:59:46,971 --> 00:59:50,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't know how they can give you a better answer than that.

689
00:59:51,172 --> 00:59:55,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, again, if I'm one of those 1%, I'm still not going to be happy.

690
00:59:55,454 --> 00:59:57,734
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, I guess what else can they do?

691
00:59:57,794 --> 00:59:58,915
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's a problem, there's a problem.

692
00:59:59,075 --> 01:00:01,336
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, who's actually happy about the effect of electronics?

693
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:02,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody.

694
01:00:03,316 --> 01:00:06,897
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, I think about it, you know, it's really not just video game consoles.

695
01:00:06,977 --> 01:00:10,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, iPhones are kind of notorious for having a lot of problems too.

696
01:00:11,238 --> 01:00:16,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the freaking switches, like on my first iPhone 5, that little switch, or what was it?

697
01:00:16,979 --> 01:00:19,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Something broke on, oh my, my sleep button, that's what it was.

698
01:00:19,959 --> 01:00:21,280
[SPEAKER_05]: The sleep button stopped clicking.

699
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:26,701
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, those things start breaking pretty easy and I wasn't using my phone for anything too strenuous.

700
01:00:26,741 --> 01:00:32,322
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, it's not like only game consoles are broken all the time, but it's still irritating.

701
01:00:32,742 --> 01:00:33,382
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

702
01:00:57,407 --> 01:01:00,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason is going to be doing some stories for us tonight since Jamie's not here.

703
01:01:00,628 --> 01:01:08,170
[SPEAKER_03]: I am, and easily, per the organization, you don't even have to change the initial because Jason and Jamie start with the same letter.

704
01:01:09,571 --> 01:01:24,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps a relic of back when the Xbox was still a check-in every 24 hours if the system is offline, achievements will not unlock if you're playing a game while it's offline, presumably also if your internet connection is down, anything along those lines.

705
01:01:26,075 --> 01:01:45,039
[SPEAKER_03]: The common consensus is just that this is simply a holdover for achievement verification on the web and not some kind of... It'd be nice if this were some kind of like a buying achievement deterrent or something of the sort, but it's more likely just that it fell within the same expectations of the system always being online.

706
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:47,780
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the really fun things with this article is that...

707
01:01:49,521 --> 01:02:01,609
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was an announcement posted on Xbox 360 Achievements that when they realized that I was playing one game, I got achievements for another one because apparently their internet connection had died for some period of time.

708
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:05,852
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they link to a help article on support.xbox.com.

709
01:02:06,773 --> 01:02:13,877
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought this was... I guess I've always known that we've been headed in this direction, but it makes me laugh and cry equal amounts.

710
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:28,005
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get no gamer score earned from app achievements, the prescribed resolution says, "...you can earn app achievements for basic use of an app, such as watching a movie on Netflix, at the app developer's discretion.

711
01:02:28,465 --> 01:02:32,748
[SPEAKER_03]: App achievements do not affect gamer score, though they may bring other in-app awards."

712
01:02:33,548 --> 01:02:38,534
[SPEAKER_03]: And this stuff is starting to go into things that don't have anything to do with gaming at all.

713
01:02:39,334 --> 01:02:40,796
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give you a great example.

714
01:02:50,706 --> 01:02:55,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Target, the store, has a brand new app on iPhone, probably on Android too.

715
01:02:55,088 --> 01:02:55,889
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't imagine why it wouldn't be.

716
01:02:55,909 --> 01:02:56,789
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Cartwheel.

717
01:02:57,049 --> 01:02:58,710
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like their new little coupon thing, right?

718
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:05,234
[SPEAKER_05]: And you go into this big Target database that they have of all these coupons and you add them to your barcode.

719
01:03:05,254 --> 01:03:07,155
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to have a Facebook, I think, to sign up for it.

720
01:03:07,755 --> 01:03:10,556
[SPEAKER_05]: And you put all the little coupons on your thing, right?

721
01:03:10,656 --> 01:03:14,638
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have your barcode and they scan your phone at the store and you get money back with it.

722
01:03:14,658 --> 01:03:15,299
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the thing.

723
01:03:16,508 --> 01:03:18,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Game Center Achievements Game Center Achievements

724
01:03:39,627 --> 01:03:52,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it, and Foursquare very largely pioneered a lot of this with its badges and just the continued increase of them.

725
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:55,278
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was also a camera app.

726
01:03:56,158 --> 01:04:11,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Not terribly unlike Instagram in 2009 that when Game Center and Custom Achievement Integration first hit, they would give you achievements and scores for filterless and filtered photos and all of these other snazzy framing and other things that you can do with the app.

727
01:04:12,545 --> 01:04:20,189
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it, and on a game console, if there's actually a merit to the reward, sure, but I... I don't know.

728
01:04:20,709 --> 01:04:22,990
[SPEAKER_03]: The generation's here, it's finally starting, whatever.

729
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:25,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Just made me laugh and also cry.

730
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, some people in chat are asking questions here.

731
01:04:29,721 --> 01:04:30,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

732
01:04:32,662 --> 01:04:34,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiger Claw says, yeah, that does sound weird.

733
01:04:34,422 --> 01:04:36,643
[SPEAKER_05]: What if they give you achievement for watching certain movies?

734
01:04:36,983 --> 01:04:43,125
[SPEAKER_05]: What if you unlock an achievement of a movie you didn't want people know you, which cause, I don't know where the grammar went there.

735
01:04:43,325 --> 01:04:43,866
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

736
01:04:59,506 --> 01:05:04,868
[SPEAKER_05]: So I could save on panties if I want, but it was marked with a little padlock.

737
01:05:04,908 --> 01:05:06,028
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, what does that mean?

738
01:05:06,088 --> 01:05:07,369
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, oh, it's private.

739
01:05:07,749 --> 01:05:13,951
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I'm buying women's panties, I'm not going to have to answer that question with my friends who see that I'm using that to save money.

740
01:05:14,211 --> 01:05:15,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, why are you buying women's panties?

741
01:05:16,411 --> 01:05:18,992
[SPEAKER_03]: You watched Jersey Shore behind the scenes.

742
01:05:19,012 --> 01:05:21,153
[SPEAKER_03]: 100 points for your lost sanity.

743
01:05:23,615 --> 01:05:51,748
[SPEAKER_05]: so I would imagine certain things would be private or you could lock away or what have you so there you go Bobby Blackwolf in chat wants to remind you VOG gives achievements that's right our lovely network vognetwork.com gamified with the achievements it's true and now in case you haven't heard me pimp this enough that whole gamification is turning into prizes if you haven't checked that out the raffle at vognetwork.com we're giving away cards against humanity this month next month we're giving away tune in next week to find out

744
01:05:52,708 --> 01:06:21,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I finally got my first comment based achievement on VOG Network the other day I don't comment too terribly much but I was posting addendums and explaining things on a previous episode and I got enough cumulative likes that I'm finally starting to get some loot for the task BlackWolfInChat says the app achievements are general they're like watch 10 videos about your favorite team in the NFL app not watch 10 videos about the Jacksonville Jaguars laughter

745
01:06:22,236 --> 01:06:22,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

746
01:06:52,396 --> 01:06:55,257
[SPEAKER_03]: A good... Maybe not so much NHL.

747
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:55,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I take that one back.

748
01:06:56,518 --> 01:07:01,600
[SPEAKER_03]: But most everything else that I've played, a good 70%, 80% of them are local.

749
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:06,082
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you want to show off those achievements to anybody, you're going to have to connect online eventually.

750
01:07:06,162 --> 01:07:07,483
[SPEAKER_05]: So it can talk to the server.

751
01:07:07,883 --> 01:07:09,784
[SPEAKER_05]: 360 and PlayStation 3 both do that today.

752
01:07:09,804 --> 01:07:09,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

753
01:07:10,364 --> 01:07:11,985
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, I think...

754
01:07:12,545 --> 01:07:23,133
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same group of people that were complaining about the 24-hour requirement because shoddy internet, internet instability, not having broadband.

755
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:30,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so looking at Bobby really wants me to read this.

756
01:07:30,519 --> 01:07:31,659
[SPEAKER_05]: He sent me a private message.

757
01:07:31,999 --> 01:07:36,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Please note the Xbox One achievements seem to be a combination of achievements and rewards on the 360.

758
01:07:37,542 --> 01:07:46,166
[SPEAKER_05]: The rewards bring avatar items on the 360 and on Xbox One some of those zero point achievements bring in-game badges and titles.

759
01:07:46,946 --> 01:07:51,988
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I mean, and that's kind of like the whole, you know, like I was talking about Cartwheel a minute ago.

760
01:07:52,048 --> 01:07:57,329
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not playing anything, but you're still getting those rewards for using it.

761
01:07:57,389 --> 01:08:01,190
[SPEAKER_05]: And I imagine even things like Twitch, because Twitch sent an email out.

762
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:05,071
[SPEAKER_05]: They blasted all their broadcasters and said, hey, you can get achievements in our new app.

763
01:08:05,552 --> 01:08:06,172
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe...

764
01:08:07,132 --> 01:08:34,998
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm making shit up here but it would not be outside the realm of possibility that Twitch could be like and if you were in these achievements you can archive X more hours of video or your videos will be saved for X many more hours or your YouTubes will export this much faster or whatever they want to do you can chat in this color you know they could whatever little achievements they wanted to get they could do and it wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility for their power users quote unquote so

765
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on.

766
01:08:38,221 --> 01:08:40,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, speaking of Twitch, right?

767
01:08:40,701 --> 01:08:41,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, speaking of Twitch.

768
01:08:43,942 --> 01:08:51,385
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have to say, before you get into this, it's so fascinating to me how much that site is now really...

769
01:08:52,125 --> 01:09:16,759
[SPEAKER_05]: like we have mentioned that site easily 20 times more the past month than we did last year like it's the way it's so integrated into gaming culture now fascinates me and again I'm gonna say this again it really fascinates me nobody's competing with them do they have patents I don't know about I mean I guess there's Ustream but you don't hear Ustream as much as you hear about Twitch fascinates me

770
01:09:18,139 --> 01:09:21,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say the only other thing I can think of that comes close is YouTube.

771
01:09:22,222 --> 01:09:24,524
[SPEAKER_05]: But that is obviously... YouTube's different as well.

772
01:09:25,385 --> 01:09:26,766
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more video on demand.

773
01:09:27,606 --> 01:09:30,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitch, as most know, was born out of Justin.TV.

774
01:09:30,929 --> 01:09:33,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin.TV is in the same class as Ustream.

775
01:09:33,731 --> 01:09:37,914
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all very general and they have incredibly diverse content and it's a very broad service.

776
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:41,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitch did something incredibly significant for gaming...

777
01:09:43,218 --> 01:09:44,719
[SPEAKER_03]: It just isolated it to gaming.

778
01:09:45,099 --> 01:09:54,865
[SPEAKER_03]: And that alone, and featured the biggest games that everybody goes into, Spectate, Dota, League of Legends, StarCraft, WoW to a lesser extent, Hearthstone now.

779
01:09:56,326 --> 01:10:11,114
[SPEAKER_03]: They did something that was very specific, perhaps because they started signing contracts with these big companies a year or two ago, but they have a dedicated, significant gaming experience, and now they are reaping the fruits of those contracts.

780
01:10:12,934 --> 01:10:14,376
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just fascinating to me.

781
01:10:14,996 --> 01:10:22,783
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I joked last week, maybe Microsoft should delay Twitch TV so they can launch their whole Skype broadcast or Skype game room.

782
01:10:24,184 --> 01:10:29,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really surprised nobody else is trying to kind of get in on that.

783
01:10:29,428 --> 01:10:30,830
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, that's a whole other show.

784
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:37,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Loki, I didn't mean to derail you, but it fascinates me how much we're talking about this and how much of a gaming culture it is now.

785
01:10:38,716 --> 01:11:05,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, so, you know, like we've said before, and actually I think more talking about, like, Nintendo even, just, you know, hey, look at all the bad things that could possibly happen with, you know, because we were talking about the whole swap note thing, and now you're saying, hey, well, you know, what's to stop somebody from, you know, showing their penis over the video chat on, you know, Nintendo Wii U?

786
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:09,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, people found out that, hey, guess what?

787
01:11:09,762 --> 01:11:20,169
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a really cool thing that you can do with the PlayStation 4 is that you can stream stuff with that wonderful Playroom app that's on there.

788
01:11:21,070 --> 01:11:27,474
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, you could basically sit down in a room and have those little robots running around and stuff, and you can almost create your own talk show.

789
01:11:27,814 --> 01:11:35,940
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what, like, some people have been doing, is they've been sitting there filming themselves doing stupid shit within the Playroom app.

790
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:48,509
[SPEAKER_06]: and unfortunately it only takes you know one person to realize hey you can stream stuff out of there to have someone else realize hey I can stream really nasty weird shit from there and that's what happened so

791
01:11:50,456 --> 01:11:52,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitch has been trying to crack down on it.

792
01:11:52,258 --> 01:11:52,478
[SPEAKER_06]: It says,

793
01:12:13,874 --> 01:12:23,144
[SPEAKER_06]: However, what does not fall under the terms of service would be some dude having sex with his girlfriend on a couch in the middle of the Playroom app.

794
01:12:23,825 --> 01:12:24,206
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

795
01:12:24,306 --> 01:12:29,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitch had to have a way to deal with this anyway, though, because you could do all that shit on a PC if you wanted with your webcam.

796
01:12:29,391 --> 01:12:34,177
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not like this is a foreign territory for Twitch to have to deal with, but...

797
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:45,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly, the PlayStation 4 and it broadening the Twitch community like that is kind of the interesting element of this.

798
01:12:45,865 --> 01:12:50,108
[SPEAKER_05]: The unfortunate thing about it, I really hope they don't disable Playroom for streaming.

799
01:12:50,128 --> 01:12:50,488
[SPEAKER_05]: No, there's...

800
01:12:50,788 --> 01:12:54,591
[SPEAKER_05]: because just like I talked about the Google Plus thing earlier is a great way to get your foot in the door.

801
01:12:55,132 --> 01:13:00,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, and I think it's really fun when there's a lot of people, you know, part of what I like about this show too is that we're all in the same room.

802
01:13:00,196 --> 01:13:01,677
[SPEAKER_05]: We all get to react to each other and so forth.

803
01:13:02,077 --> 01:13:05,120
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be awesome if people could do like broadcasts.

804
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:05,860
[SPEAKER_05]: They were, yeah.

805
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:06,481
[SPEAKER_05]: On Twitch, yeah.

806
01:13:07,202 --> 01:13:13,847
[SPEAKER_05]: There was one example of that.

807
01:13:13,867 --> 01:13:27,918
[SPEAKER_06]: There was someone doing a show called The Spartan Show and they were sitting down at a desk and they were talking about the PlayStation 4 and stuff and I think they were even taking Skype calls on a computer that was in there and they had the setup and stuff so that's kind of cool.

808
01:13:28,798 --> 01:13:35,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Having sex with somebody or in this case there was one that's like some guy motorboating somebody in a horse head mask but

809
01:13:36,591 --> 01:13:40,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Not... That's a little weird, but... Hasn't that happened on this show, though?

810
01:13:41,874 --> 01:13:43,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a horse head mask yet.

811
01:13:43,235 --> 01:13:47,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe not a horse head mask, but I'm pretty sure one of the times... Motorboating has probably happened.

812
01:13:47,637 --> 01:13:50,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Motorboating has definitely happened on this show.

813
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:54,621
[SPEAKER_05]: All those times Princess Irene has been here, I know motorboating has happened on this show.

814
01:13:55,982 --> 01:13:59,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this when I interject and say that Bobby Blackwell was just a little bit ahead of his time?

815
01:14:00,445 --> 01:14:01,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Friday Night Gaming?

816
01:14:01,725 --> 01:14:02,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Friday Night Gaming?

817
01:14:03,266 --> 01:14:04,526
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pre-Twitch.

818
01:14:05,067 --> 01:14:06,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fairly confident.

819
01:14:06,247 --> 01:14:08,748
[SPEAKER_06]: He was doing it on Ustream, the other site.

820
01:14:11,208 --> 01:14:18,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so outside of this crazy stuff, something of course that's being worked in right now is archiving.

821
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:20,171
[SPEAKER_06]: They're planning on doing it for the PlayStation 4.

822
01:14:21,394 --> 01:14:26,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Considering for the Xbox One, I think probably just right now because the Xbox One Twitch service hasn't launched yet.

823
01:14:26,477 --> 01:14:29,658
[SPEAKER_06]: So once that does, we'll see what, you know, the feasibility of all stuff.

824
01:14:29,858 --> 01:14:32,500
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure that they're going to have archiving on both sides at some point.

825
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:38,482
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, you know, like I mentioned, the Xbox One does not have the Twitch service that launched and that is coming later on.

826
01:14:39,343 --> 01:14:40,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometime in the first part of 2014.

827
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:44,000
[SPEAKER_05]: GameStreamer

828
01:15:05,823 --> 01:15:08,905
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say the answer is obviously yes.

829
01:15:08,985 --> 01:15:16,410
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's even getting bigger with all this in, you know, kind of enrichments into the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

830
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:19,812
[SPEAKER_05]: But the question was more like, you know, well, why?

831
01:15:19,973 --> 01:15:23,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do people watch other people play games when you can be playing them themselves?

832
01:15:24,916 --> 01:15:30,800
[SPEAKER_05]: And I respect that position because I was there myself just a couple years ago, maybe even last year.

833
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:32,341
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure I've said that on this show.

834
01:15:32,881 --> 01:15:35,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Why the hell would I live stream when I can play something myself?

835
01:15:35,883 --> 01:15:49,594
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have found through trying it and kind of getting into other people's streams and seeing more and more of my friends easily be able to live stream as you know, it's so easy on PlayStation 4 and helping friends of mine be able to stream.

836
01:15:50,215 --> 01:15:54,699
[SPEAKER_05]: It's somewhat the modern day equivalent of being able to go plop down next to somebody on the couch.

837
01:15:54,959 --> 01:15:55,679
[SPEAKER_05]: What you doing?

838
01:15:57,180 --> 01:16:00,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Even across long distances, because that's almost like what it's become.

839
01:16:00,542 --> 01:16:05,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, Extifer might be streaming Rezagun one night, and I can just virtually go plop on him next to the couch.

840
01:16:05,845 --> 01:16:06,605
[SPEAKER_05]: What you doing?

841
01:16:06,625 --> 01:16:07,366
[SPEAKER_05]: What you playing?

842
01:16:07,406 --> 01:16:07,826
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing?

843
01:16:07,846 --> 01:16:08,586
[SPEAKER_05]: You're dying.

844
01:16:08,727 --> 01:16:08,987
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?

845
01:16:10,327 --> 01:16:13,009
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like kind of the modern equivalent of that, in a way.

846
01:16:13,369 --> 01:16:14,550
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, for me, is like why...

847
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:42,358
[SPEAKER_05]: for some people they get to see the best of the best they might have some other reasons too but for me I just love the fact that there's people that would even want to watch it and I can make something that can be a single player experience sometimes be more social a friend of mine was streaming a bunch of fighting games which normally I've been to a couple fighting game tournaments in my area yeah okay I haven't played a fighting game in a really long time but then he switched to dive kick

848
01:16:43,527 --> 01:16:48,629
[SPEAKER_03]: That game is completely freaking fascinating, and I'm mildly obsessed with it now.

849
01:16:48,829 --> 01:16:53,651
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I know him, I have known him for a number of years, so I was just kind of coming in to socialize.

850
01:16:54,151 --> 01:17:00,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard how good he is at Persona 3 Arena, so I was just kind of seeing what he's up to and seeing the other games he wants to play.

851
01:17:01,554 --> 01:17:08,397
[SPEAKER_03]: And just happenstance, I saw, you know, a new game that I literally never heard about before that day, and now every time I see it, it's just...

852
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:35,449
[SPEAKER_05]: so simple on the face yet so incredibly deep and just a very you know dive kick is unlike any other fighting game out there so it was just a good random occurrence I go to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com lots of comments on this uh bonds006 says hear me out on this I don't care to watch others play games because I will be missing out on playing games I have two TVs in my living room and I have zero interest of watching a game stream while I am in the living room uh

853
01:17:36,409 --> 01:17:46,331
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like watching a friend play a game you don't have interest in playing, but curious enough to see how he or she plays it.

854
01:17:47,291 --> 01:17:51,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan at live.vognetwork.com says, I told my wife, this is like my football.

855
01:17:51,672 --> 01:17:53,572
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I watch people stream games.

856
01:17:54,012 --> 01:18:01,633
[SPEAKER_05]: And now that these apps are showing up on TVs and in the devices and so forth, you watch it almost the same way you watch football now.

857
01:18:02,114 --> 01:18:04,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of a cable box, it's an Xbox One box.

858
01:18:04,174 --> 01:18:04,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

859
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:14,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Doom Plague says some games are really fun to watch, particularly open world type games like Grand Theft Auto.

860
01:18:14,779 --> 01:18:22,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Twitch games like, this wasn't particularly a big one, but imagine the modern equivalent of Geometry Wars.

861
01:18:22,503 --> 01:18:30,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Incredible Twitch action, once your brain can actually adapt to everything that's going on, it turns into a very fun spectator event incredibly quickly.

862
01:18:31,378 --> 01:18:36,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Mast Bishop in the chatroom says, when live streaming on the next gen consoles, can you see your viewer count?

863
01:18:37,019 --> 01:18:39,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we don't know about Xbox One just yet because that app's not out.

864
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:41,360
[SPEAKER_05]: But on PlayStation 4, yes.

865
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:49,162
[SPEAKER_05]: When you do the whole little like where it has the side and the bottom bar and it kind of shrinks the screen just slightly, you can actually see how many people are watching the stream.

866
01:18:49,182 --> 01:18:52,883
[SPEAKER_05]: And it also counts how many chat lines have been spoken so far, which is interesting.

867
01:18:53,323 --> 01:18:55,083
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see how active your chatroom is.

868
01:18:55,383 --> 01:18:58,704
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can also see at the very bottom, you see the last two lines of chat.

869
01:18:59,304 --> 01:19:21,672
[SPEAKER_05]: which if you don't have a lot of people watching you can probably stay on top of very easy but imagine if you're one of the more popular broadcasters and you wouldn't be able to stay on top of the chat that way so I don't know 20 messages a second that thing will never stop moving that would be tough so I don't know but I think a lot of people probably don't interact with their chat rooms as much if you get that many comments because it's just impossible to stay on top of so

870
01:19:22,472 --> 01:19:24,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyhow, let's move on.

871
01:19:24,213 --> 01:19:26,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, we're running really long tonight, but hey, it's one of those nights.

872
01:19:28,354 --> 01:19:32,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we dabbled on this a little earlier in the show, but I want to talk about it a little more now.

873
01:19:32,315 --> 01:19:36,556
[SPEAKER_05]: This is about Nintendo talking about their Wii U lineup for 2014.

874
01:19:37,156 --> 01:19:46,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, in an interview with Game Trailers, Reggie Fils-Aimé, who of course is Nintendo of America's president, said that there will not be a Wii U software drought like we saw in 2013.

875
01:19:46,659 --> 01:19:47,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is, quote,

876
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:55,263
[SPEAKER_05]: The way we're going to be different is we're going to certainly have a steadier pace of games, both for Wii U and for 3DS.

877
01:19:55,703 --> 01:19:58,804
[SPEAKER_05]: The marketing activity is going to be constant throughout the entire year.

878
01:19:59,164 --> 01:20:03,106
[SPEAKER_05]: You tease me a little bit that, boy, the first half of 2013 was a little quiet.

879
01:20:03,246 --> 01:20:04,086
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what?

880
01:20:04,106 --> 01:20:05,127
[SPEAKER_05]: You look back and it was.

881
01:20:05,407 --> 01:20:07,368
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to be making that same mistake in 2014.

882
01:20:08,428 --> 01:20:09,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm, admission.

883
01:20:09,749 --> 01:20:14,231
[SPEAKER_05]: So the pace, the ongoing activity, touching the consumer and messaging is what we're all about.

884
01:20:14,531 --> 01:20:16,492
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be a big difference next year.

885
01:20:17,532 --> 01:20:21,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say this, I went and saw Catching Fire on Friday, which by the way, amazing!

886
01:20:22,178 --> 01:20:25,723
[SPEAKER_05]: But they had a Wii U commercial, actually.

887
01:20:25,803 --> 01:20:33,473
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how they do, they do like the, this is the first look of the movies at the cinema, enjoy the, you know, basically the act.

888
01:20:33,473 --> 01:20:33,873
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com.

889
01:21:00,069 --> 01:21:10,089
[SPEAKER_05]: but I digress so Nintendo is trying to get the word out there in other ways for sure so they have the movie ads if nothing else but Reggie promising you're not going to see that same drought

890
01:21:11,465 --> 01:21:15,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I bet that's why Donkey Kong and Mario Kart 8 aren't coming out right now.

891
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:16,908
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a huge part of it.

892
01:21:17,349 --> 01:21:19,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the Donkey Kong delay was strategical.

893
01:21:19,790 --> 01:21:22,011
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it had anything to do with the game not being done.

894
01:21:22,552 --> 01:21:28,976
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Mario Kart maybe needed a little more tweaks because pushing that all the way back to April is quite a ways and maybe further.

895
01:21:29,896 --> 01:21:32,898
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think the Donkey Kong's now, what, February?

896
01:21:33,358 --> 01:21:35,019
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that is a strategical delay.

897
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:40,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you didn't want to have two platformers out back-to-back and Mario 3D World is so damn good

898
01:21:41,363 --> 01:22:07,755
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to release Donkey Kong at the same time And then it's like, oh yeah, there's two good platformers It's because there's not a lot of Wii U titles coming out Seriously, there's not a lot of Wii U titles coming out So when Reggie talks about this whole There's not going to be a drought He's full of shit He's absolutely 100% full of shit Because here are the games coming out in February On the Wii U The Lego Movie and Donkey Kong

899
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:11,382
[SPEAKER_06]: So does that sound like full of shit to me?

900
01:22:11,542 --> 01:22:13,324
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like a whole heap of shit.

901
01:22:14,645 --> 01:22:17,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Could there be stuff we just don't know about yet?

902
01:22:17,688 --> 01:22:22,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Because let's be real, they cranked out that Zelda Wind Waker HD thing fast.

903
01:22:22,413 --> 01:22:27,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Could they have other little... I mean, and we've heard the rumors before about the 64 revisited.

904
01:22:27,377 --> 01:22:29,880
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember what the hell they call that.

905
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:30,781
[SPEAKER_03]: I even read that article.

906
01:22:30,801 --> 01:22:34,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I joked it was re-imagined, like they call RuPaul's Drag Race or something.

907
01:22:34,564 --> 01:22:37,006
[SPEAKER_05]: It was something similar to that, but you know what I'm talking about, right?

908
01:22:37,046 --> 01:22:37,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Re-imagined.

909
01:22:37,606 --> 01:22:38,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Re-imagined or something.

910
01:22:38,928 --> 01:22:43,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Could that be something that's in their pocket that they haven't quite played those cards yet?

911
01:22:44,072 --> 01:22:48,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that they've... They've already announced their first quarter.

912
01:22:48,216 --> 01:22:48,616
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

913
01:22:48,696 --> 01:22:50,437
[SPEAKER_06]: They have one other title in...

914
01:22:52,760 --> 01:23:12,239
[SPEAKER_06]: so they have a title in January they are one of the only Wii U titles in January it's Wii Fit U but it's a disc based version for the game that's out already right now so that doesn't I don't really count that because you could get it right now but yes disc based version of Wii Fit U will be out in January

915
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:39,902
[SPEAKER_06]: but come on it's just which was supposed to be out this year if I'm not mistaken it is out right now no the disc was supposed to be out this year that was pushed back but there is a drought there's not a whole ton of games coming out it's just the Lego movie and that's it so far for February March there's going to be some stuff but that's it Gene in chat brings up a good point live.vognetwork.com PlayStation 4 and Xbox One drought though

916
01:23:41,584 --> 01:23:44,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Could those systems be... Not for as long, period.

917
01:23:44,628 --> 01:23:45,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Launch window, whatever.

918
01:23:46,069 --> 01:23:52,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, at least we know... Is Destiny first quarter, or is that further back?

919
01:23:52,576 --> 01:23:53,798
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking at summer for Destiny.

920
01:23:54,078 --> 01:23:56,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, I think Placeholder is first quarter.

921
01:23:57,102 --> 01:23:59,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, but Titanfall is first quarter for sure, right?

922
01:23:59,024 --> 01:23:59,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Titanfall is March.

923
01:24:00,325 --> 01:24:04,248
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there's some things trickling in there, at least.

924
01:24:04,408 --> 01:24:06,069
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, Gene could have a good point.

925
01:24:06,149 --> 01:24:09,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what do the other systems have that's so great?

926
01:24:10,692 --> 01:24:12,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's a lot of placeholder stuff right now.

927
01:24:14,094 --> 01:24:16,996
[SPEAKER_06]: And to be fair, LEGO Movie is on all platforms.

928
01:24:17,356 --> 01:24:21,418
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there's that.

929
01:24:21,759 --> 01:24:22,719
[SPEAKER_06]: They do have some other titles.

930
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:26,422
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember off the top of my head, so I'm going to actually go look.

931
01:24:27,322 --> 01:24:31,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but, uh, I know a lot of the stuff I have right now is Placeholder Thief.

932
01:24:32,387 --> 01:24:34,189
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to be, um, pretty soon.

933
01:24:34,789 --> 01:24:37,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that's still gonna be first quarter, if that'll get pushed back.

934
01:24:38,353 --> 01:24:41,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I was gonna say, um...

935
01:24:42,369 --> 01:25:11,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I think at least in PlayStation's camp I don't know so much about Xbox One but PlayStation's camp they're teasing a lot of oh yeah Infamous that's March I think they're teasing a lot of like betas you know there's the Destiny beta there's the Final Fantasy 14 beta there's the Elder Scrolls Online beta they're kind of trying to fill in the gap with all these like well the games won't be out but all these awesome previews you're waiting for will be so give or take that so anyway all right

936
01:25:13,866 --> 01:25:14,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Step Evolution Announces ReRave Plus Arcade

937
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:40,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not seen the current ReRave arcade game, but I'm going to assume it's very similar to the rest of the touch-based attractions that Dave & Buster has.

938
01:25:41,028 --> 01:25:48,831
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is a big 40-inch touchscreen at about just above waist level and a nice placard sign to advertise what the game is.

939
01:25:49,451 --> 01:25:57,534
[SPEAKER_03]: But at a trade show in just the last couple of days, IAAPA, they announced ReRave Plus with a new cabinet design.

940
01:25:58,454 --> 01:26:02,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Very similar to how a lot of other games, notably DJ Max Technica, are going about it.

941
01:26:04,116 --> 01:26:09,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Standing cabinet taller than you with a little miniature platform where the subwoofer is that you step up onto.

942
01:26:09,997 --> 01:26:16,179
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the lean-in touchscreen that you go into play, and then a spectator's touchscreen above your face.

943
01:26:18,419 --> 01:26:35,409
[SPEAKER_03]: The improvements that come to ReRave+, notably any graphical changes or song lists, will be available for current ReRave arcade installations, but this new cabinet will look a hell of a lot better for people that want to plunk that money in again.

944
01:26:36,850 --> 01:26:43,394
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played ReRave a couple times just on my phone, probably more likely my iPad because the phone's a little bit difficult.

945
01:26:44,975 --> 01:26:49,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a quick overview of the game is that you have touch targets with timing.

946
01:26:50,279 --> 01:26:51,260
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a music rhythm game.

947
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,421
[SPEAKER_03]: You touch them at a particular time.

948
01:26:52,461 --> 01:26:53,442
[SPEAKER_05]: It's elite beat agents.

949
01:26:54,183 --> 01:26:55,083
[SPEAKER_05]: It's elite beat agents.

950
01:26:56,404 --> 01:26:57,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Without the dancers.

951
01:26:59,087 --> 01:27:01,388
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a really long time since I played that game.

952
01:27:01,849 --> 01:27:03,870
[SPEAKER_03]: It's virtually elite beat agents.

953
01:27:03,910 --> 01:27:09,515
[SPEAKER_05]: The only difference is that you can kind of better see when the things are going to hit with the clock formations, but that's really it.

954
01:27:09,735 --> 01:27:10,516
[SPEAKER_05]: And multiple taps.

955
01:27:11,650 --> 01:27:12,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't League of Legends have those?

956
01:27:12,691 --> 01:27:13,151
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

957
01:27:13,211 --> 01:27:15,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, then it's DJ Max Technica.

958
01:27:16,594 --> 01:27:17,835
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't make that comparison.

959
01:27:18,196 --> 01:27:19,357
[SPEAKER_03]: A combination of the two.

960
01:27:19,777 --> 01:27:20,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, whatever.

961
01:27:20,437 --> 01:27:25,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, ReRave Plus, massive improvements for the arcade installations next year.

962
01:27:25,742 --> 01:27:26,803
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a very pretty game.

963
01:27:27,103 --> 01:27:31,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to see this in my local Dave & Buster's or elsewhere that I've been that I can't think

964
01:27:32,568 --> 01:27:40,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved and hated at the same time how they have to make sure that it's going to be relevant for an arcade by putting tickets spitting into it.

965
01:27:52,406 --> 01:27:54,607
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's one of those things where it's like, ah, gross.

966
01:27:54,727 --> 01:27:58,868
[SPEAKER_05]: But then at the same time, you're like, well, it's actually a worthy game to do that kind of thing.

967
01:27:58,928 --> 01:28:03,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, but the reality is that's the only way it's going to get into arcades, which sucks.

968
01:28:04,470 --> 01:28:05,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't hear me wrong.

969
01:28:05,070 --> 01:28:05,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine if DDR gave tickets.

970
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:09,592
[SPEAKER_03]: All those noobs failing to getting their free song on Beginner would get like one.

971
01:28:10,112 --> 01:28:14,093
[SPEAKER_03]: But then everybody else that plays the super hard songs, hey, we just raped the whole machine.

972
01:28:14,113 --> 01:28:15,314
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have a ton of fucking tickets.

973
01:28:15,434 --> 01:28:16,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I just got to tell you.

974
01:28:16,534 --> 01:28:17,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Outro Outro Outro

975
01:28:34,278 --> 01:28:34,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't trip.

976
01:28:34,718 --> 01:28:35,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't trip.

977
01:28:59,465 --> 01:29:00,346
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there's your drought.

978
01:29:00,666 --> 01:29:05,691
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, if you want to call it non-drought by delaying games, yeah, sure, why not?

979
01:29:05,931 --> 01:29:06,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's play that way.

980
01:29:07,753 --> 01:29:19,224
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some confirmed, like, for example, Drive Club is supposed to be coming out in February and also confirmed the Xbox One version of Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare is going to be coming out.

981
01:29:19,424 --> 01:29:20,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there you go.

982
01:29:21,105 --> 01:29:21,426
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

983
01:29:22,006 --> 01:29:22,647
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's...

984
01:29:23,948 --> 01:29:25,529
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to talk drought, look at January.

985
01:29:25,809 --> 01:29:30,593
[SPEAKER_06]: There is We Fit You and Dragon Ball Z Battle of Z. That's it.

986
01:29:30,673 --> 01:29:34,136
[SPEAKER_05]: You could look at January almost every year and it's the same story.

987
01:29:34,196 --> 01:29:34,896
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not.

988
01:29:35,176 --> 01:29:35,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

989
01:29:35,457 --> 01:29:36,257
[SPEAKER_05]: This is ridiculous.

990
01:29:36,277 --> 01:29:40,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I do remember one year... When did Bioshock Infinite come out this year?

991
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:40,741
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty early.

992
01:29:40,781 --> 01:29:43,723
[SPEAKER_05]: And then sometimes you get the Final Fantasy 13-2.

993
01:29:43,743 --> 01:29:44,924
[SPEAKER_05]: 13-2 was January.

994
01:29:44,984 --> 01:29:49,147
[SPEAKER_05]: And now Lightning Returns, I think, is February or March.

995
01:29:49,907 --> 01:29:50,228
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's...

996
01:29:50,868 --> 01:29:53,969
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very unusual to have two games only.

997
01:29:54,249 --> 01:29:55,630
[SPEAKER_06]: In December, it's also two games.

998
01:29:55,670 --> 01:29:57,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Gran Turismo 6 and then the Vita game.

999
01:29:57,750 --> 01:29:59,051
[SPEAKER_05]: But you were supposed to have the South Park game.

1000
01:29:59,631 --> 01:30:00,191
[SPEAKER_06]: That didn't happen.

1001
01:30:00,231 --> 01:30:01,492
[SPEAKER_06]: That would have only been three games.

1002
01:30:01,652 --> 01:30:02,772
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the games left.

1003
01:30:03,692 --> 01:30:08,174
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's talk about what's coming out now as we travel around the world and check out release dates.

1004
01:30:08,494 --> 01:30:14,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, this was a pretty lengthy segment in previous weeks, but as Loki's indicating, it's going to start to dry up a little bit.

1005
01:30:14,376 --> 01:30:16,697
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's see if there's anything for this week anyway.

1006
01:30:17,057 --> 01:30:17,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

1007
01:30:17,818 --> 01:30:18,298
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit.

1008
01:30:18,318 --> 01:30:21,081
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more like someone took a fucking ShamWow to this shit.

1009
01:30:23,503 --> 01:30:27,567
[SPEAKER_06]: No, seriously, this week there's a whole lot of nothing.

1010
01:30:27,787 --> 01:30:33,252
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically Ys Memory of Celceta, which is going to be coming out on Vita.

1011
01:30:34,753 --> 01:30:40,258
[SPEAKER_06]: One super late announcement, Air Conflicts Vietnam on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1012
01:30:40,298 --> 01:30:40,358
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

1013
01:30:44,728 --> 01:30:46,509
[SPEAKER_06]: And I almost think that's it.

1014
01:30:47,590 --> 01:30:48,670
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to look here real quick.

1015
01:30:48,950 --> 01:30:54,854
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's that Frozen pack for Disney Infinity supposed to be coming out this week.

1016
01:30:55,694 --> 01:30:56,575
[SPEAKER_06]: That was another one.

1017
01:30:57,195 --> 01:30:58,596
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's sad.

1018
01:31:03,058 --> 01:31:03,938
[SPEAKER_06]: God, is that it?

1019
01:31:04,759 --> 01:31:05,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Atari Flashback 4.

1020
01:31:06,659 --> 01:31:07,239
[SPEAKER_06]: That's coming out?

1021
01:31:07,379 --> 01:31:07,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

1022
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:08,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1023
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:09,700
[SPEAKER_05]: What's cool about the Flashback 4?

1024
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:10,400
[SPEAKER_05]: What does that have in it?

1025
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:11,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck if I know.

1026
01:31:11,221 --> 01:31:12,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to know more about that.

1027
01:31:12,221 --> 01:31:13,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Those consoles are pretty neat.

1028
01:31:13,861 --> 01:31:14,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1029
01:31:14,642 --> 01:31:15,422
[SPEAKER_05]: I love retro games.

1030
01:31:15,442 --> 01:31:15,822
[SPEAKER_05]: What can I say?

1031
01:31:15,842 --> 01:31:21,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Disney Infinity, the Frozen toy box set in PowerDisc Pack 2 is going to be coming out now if you're into that shit.

1032
01:31:23,866 --> 01:31:25,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Good Black Friday deals.

1033
01:31:25,309 --> 01:31:26,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, one very late one.

1034
01:31:26,971 --> 01:31:33,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo Origins bundle, which is basically just a re-bundling of the Halo Anniversary and Halo Reach.

1035
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:36,044
[SPEAKER_06]: So that'll be coming out this week as well.

1036
01:31:37,246 --> 01:31:37,487
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

1037
01:31:39,912 --> 01:31:49,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Black Friday, I know there's a new PlayStation 3 skew for $1.99 that comes with The Last of Us and Batman Arkham Origins.

1038
01:31:50,104 --> 01:31:50,745
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty good.

1039
01:31:50,985 --> 01:31:53,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Girls Fashion Shoot got delayed again, so that's on 3DS.

1040
01:31:55,771 --> 01:31:56,933
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is literally it.

1041
01:31:57,577 --> 01:32:01,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's travel to Japan where things are a little more active this week.

1042
01:32:01,761 --> 01:32:07,185
[SPEAKER_05]: On the PlayStation 3, you have Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag being released in Japan on November the 28th.

1043
01:32:07,705 --> 01:32:11,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Shin Sangoku Musou 7 Moshuden comes out this week.

1044
01:32:12,650 --> 01:32:15,772
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of different versions of that limited edition.

1045
01:32:15,952 --> 01:32:17,314
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Dynasty Warriors, isn't it?

1046
01:32:17,334 --> 01:32:17,914
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is.

1047
01:32:17,974 --> 01:32:19,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Koei did that one.

1048
01:32:19,495 --> 01:32:21,457
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a pretty big release out there.

1049
01:32:21,837 --> 01:32:23,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Himawari no Kyu...

1050
01:32:23,959 --> 01:32:31,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Kyokai to Nagai Natsuyasumi Extra Vacation comes out this week, regular and limited edition.

1051
01:32:31,284 --> 01:32:32,525
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, again, all PlayStation 3.

1052
01:32:33,565 --> 01:32:38,629
[SPEAKER_05]: And Super Robot Taisen OG Infinite Battle comes out as well this week.

1053
01:32:38,669 --> 01:32:40,950
[SPEAKER_05]: So pretty busy week on the PlayStation 3 in Japan.

1054
01:32:41,391 --> 01:32:49,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Taking a look at the Xbox 360 in Japan, we have just Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag is it on the 360 in Japan.

1055
01:32:49,176 --> 01:32:53,699
[SPEAKER_05]: So sounds like plenty more games coming out on the PlayStation 3 there, but that's kind of the norm.

1056
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:55,680
[SPEAKER_05]: on the PlayStation Vita.

1057
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:58,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Bitter Smile comes out this week in regular and limited edition.

1058
01:32:59,143 --> 01:33:00,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Criminal Girls Invitation.

1059
01:33:02,365 --> 01:33:03,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Invitation to what?

1060
01:33:04,919 --> 01:33:05,660
[SPEAKER_06]: All sorts of criminal things.

1061
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:06,801
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the name of the game.

1062
01:33:06,861 --> 01:33:08,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Criminal Girl Invitation.

1063
01:33:08,722 --> 01:33:12,325
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's all these anime chicks in jail outfits.

1064
01:33:12,345 --> 01:33:13,346
[SPEAKER_05]: This is cracking me up.

1065
01:33:13,746 --> 01:33:15,388
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely some type of RPG.

1066
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:17,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say this is looking tactics-like.

1067
01:33:17,309 --> 01:33:18,710
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the whole hit points.

1068
01:33:18,771 --> 01:33:19,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Not anymore.

1069
01:33:19,131 --> 01:33:20,152
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not looking like tactics.

1070
01:33:20,332 --> 01:33:21,793
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the hit points and magic points.

1071
01:33:21,813 --> 01:33:23,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Is she spreading eagle in that shot?

1072
01:33:24,755 --> 01:33:25,995
[SPEAKER_05]: This is for sick people.

1073
01:33:26,816 --> 01:33:27,996
[SPEAKER_05]: I shouldn't say that.

1074
01:33:28,376 --> 01:33:28,756
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1075
01:33:30,616 --> 01:33:32,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Other releases in Japan.

1076
01:33:32,277 --> 01:33:33,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on beyond that.

1077
01:33:34,437 --> 01:33:37,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Shin Sangoku Musou 7 comes out on the PlayStation Vita as well.

1078
01:33:38,558 --> 01:33:44,679
[SPEAKER_05]: And White Album 2, Shiwase no Mukugawa comes out in Japan as well this week.

1079
01:33:45,039 --> 01:33:48,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty busy on the PlayStation Vita.

1080
01:33:49,060 --> 01:34:03,437
[SPEAKER_05]: um looking at the Wii U quickly to see if there's anything this week uh Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag and Disney Infinity Toy Box Challenge I don't know if that's the initial release of Disney Infinity in Japan that's the 3DS one yeah no it's Wii U

1081
01:34:03,937 --> 01:34:04,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Toy Box Challenge

1082
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:32,947
[SPEAKER_05]: A new orange and black 3DS XL and a turquoise and black 3DS XL, or as they call it over there, LL.

1083
01:34:33,568 --> 01:34:35,070
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple other quick titles here.

1084
01:34:35,791 --> 01:34:43,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Toriko, Ultimate Survival, Pretty Rhythm, Rainbow Live, Kirakira My Design, and Kamen Rider come out this week.

1085
01:34:43,914 --> 01:34:46,916
[SPEAKER_03]: and a whole hell of a lot of system and game accessories.

1086
01:34:47,176 --> 01:34:49,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, but that's nothing new for Japan.

1087
01:34:49,597 --> 01:34:51,238
[SPEAKER_05]: How about the UK, Jason?

1088
01:34:51,479 --> 01:35:01,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, unlike the Xbox One, Europe is just now getting its PlayStation 4 so the lineup that we've come to know is just stacking up for this week in Europe.

1089
01:35:02,245 --> 01:35:19,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Angry Bird, Star Wars, Battlefield 4, Contrast, FIFA 14, Injustice Gods Among Us for both PlayStation 4 and Vita, Madden NFL 25, Need for Speed Rivals, Putty Squad, Super Motherload, the Pinball Arcade, and then Tiny Brains on the PlayStation 3.

1090
01:35:20,910 --> 01:35:22,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Very quiet for the other systems.

1091
01:35:22,352 --> 01:35:24,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Injustice Gods Among Us is, of course, cross-platform.

1092
01:35:24,734 --> 01:35:30,220
[SPEAKER_03]: PS4, PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PS Vita as well, I think I already mentioned.

1093
01:35:30,861 --> 01:35:32,763
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was one more.

1094
01:35:32,943 --> 01:35:35,967
[SPEAKER_03]: I said Super Mario 3D World is coming to Wii U over there.

1095
01:35:36,828 --> 01:35:38,390
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's pretty much it.

1096
01:35:39,170 --> 01:35:40,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely the PlayStation 4 week this week.

1097
01:35:43,658 --> 01:35:47,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Alrighty, just a few more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

1098
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:51,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's run through these quickly because we're running long Part A here.

1099
01:35:51,321 --> 01:35:51,682
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Loki.

1100
01:35:51,902 --> 01:35:54,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, there's a brand new firmware for PlayStation 4.

1101
01:35:55,343 --> 01:35:57,164
[SPEAKER_06]: System Update 1.51.

1102
01:35:57,284 --> 01:36:09,930
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to make some, I guess, minor refinements to the system UI and also, I guess, indicating when a user is downloading a game and a game patch at the same time.

1103
01:36:10,791 --> 01:36:14,795
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess... Wow, that's really it.

1104
01:36:15,796 --> 01:36:16,857
[SPEAKER_06]: System stability.

1105
01:36:18,219 --> 01:36:18,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, patch!

1106
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:20,582
[SPEAKER_03]: As it goes, with new releases.

1107
01:36:23,208 --> 01:36:25,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's nice though that they're coming out pretty quick.

1108
01:36:25,970 --> 01:36:29,033
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty fast since the release of the system, so I guess that's kind of cool.

1109
01:36:29,813 --> 01:36:34,677
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't expect a major content right now, but good that they're at least fixing some things.

1110
01:36:36,459 --> 01:36:48,088
[SPEAKER_05]: One other story here about Tomb Raider, and yes, there is a Tomb Raider sequel in development, and this is because Crystal Dynamics' senior art director Brian Horton was talking about this during a lecture yesterday.

1111
01:36:48,448 --> 01:37:09,324
[SPEAKER_05]: and some a statement that is grabbing some headlines was the fact that it was well financed but let me let me bring some clarity to that statement here there was a European trademark registered for Tomb Raider Reflections could that be the sequel's title who knows but certainly when trademarks and people run wild with those but that could be it

1112
01:37:10,845 --> 01:37:14,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Square has also confirmed that there's going to be a reveal in early December.

1113
01:37:15,690 --> 01:37:17,532
[SPEAKER_05]: So possibly Spike TV.

1114
01:37:17,652 --> 01:37:21,075
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of the things that will be announced during the Video Game Awards there.

1115
01:37:21,616 --> 01:37:30,665
[SPEAKER_05]: And then during the UK's Bradford Animation Festival, the aforementioned art director was taking some questions from the audience.

1116
01:37:31,225 --> 01:37:51,966
[SPEAKER_05]: and he said in regards to the Tomb Raider sequel quote we've announced the sequel I'm glad I can finally talk about the Tomb Raider sequel is the next chapter of Laura's development her life is changing she can't go back to the way she was I seem to recall they did announce the sequel after there was the whole like there was the comic book that was being made and the comic book maker mentioned something so it kind of led to this but anyway

1117
01:37:53,086 --> 01:37:53,546
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1118
01:38:11,795 --> 01:38:14,817
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not spending any more on a sequel than on the original game.

1119
01:38:41,975 --> 01:38:48,721
[SPEAKER_05]: What they do with her now, because obviously the first one was all kinds of scary and really had that caves environment and all that.

1120
01:38:49,001 --> 01:38:54,045
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm curious, are they going to now do the whole exotic worlds and that?

1121
01:38:54,225 --> 01:38:56,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Will that be the... She'll become a pirate.

1122
01:38:56,367 --> 01:38:58,529
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be just like Assassin's Creed 4.

1123
01:38:59,049 --> 01:39:00,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Uncharted, Lara Croft edition.

1124
01:39:00,751 --> 01:39:08,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Or will it still be super scary and the whole, as Jamie calls it on the show, the game called Girl.

1125
01:39:11,115 --> 01:39:11,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Girl Girl Girl Girl Girl

1126
01:39:27,628 --> 01:39:46,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get to the classic game of the week, because as you know, every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, we ask DarkSakura to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful brats, put down your Xbox One and your PlayStation 4 and Wii U's and go check out a real classic this week.

1127
01:39:47,802 --> 01:39:49,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely put that shit down.

1128
01:39:49,964 --> 01:39:51,145
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't even need a reason to put that down.

1129
01:39:51,505 --> 01:39:51,765
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1130
01:40:16,917 --> 01:40:17,358
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1131
01:40:17,858 --> 01:40:20,941
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just going to warn people right off.

1132
01:40:22,943 --> 01:40:25,125
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the noise with this game.

1133
01:40:25,185 --> 01:40:27,147
[SPEAKER_05]: It uses like PC speaker, right?

1134
01:40:27,167 --> 01:40:28,569
[SPEAKER_03]: And only PC speaker.

1135
01:40:28,589 --> 01:40:29,229
[SPEAKER_05]: PC speaker.

1136
01:40:29,289 --> 01:40:35,015
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's not a lot of music with this, and it's a lot of incidental break squeaks.

1137
01:40:35,736 --> 01:40:39,479
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will, as I always do, let the music play in the background, whatever it is.

1138
01:40:39,499 --> 01:40:39,960
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't.

1139
01:40:40,761 --> 01:40:46,045
[SPEAKER_03]: It is quite literally just break squeals and police sirens and yeah.

1140
01:40:46,305 --> 01:40:50,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, developed by Sphere and published by Spectrum Hollowbyte.

1141
01:40:51,169 --> 01:40:56,634
[SPEAKER_03]: First and foremost, I will say that this game is spelled V-E-T-T-E, VET as in short for Corvette.

1142
01:40:57,575 --> 01:40:58,556
[SPEAKER_05]: With an exclamation point.

1143
01:40:58,576 --> 01:40:59,276
[SPEAKER_03]: With an exclamation point.

1144
01:40:59,296 --> 01:41:00,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget about that.

1145
01:41:00,377 --> 01:41:04,922
[SPEAKER_03]: That is an incredibly early and incredibly crude racing simulation game.

1146
01:41:05,002 --> 01:41:11,889
[SPEAKER_03]: It was originally released in 1989, coming out on IBM PCs running MS-DOS and Macintosh computers.

1147
01:41:12,489 --> 01:41:13,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1148
01:41:28,723 --> 01:41:32,205
[SPEAKER_03]: This game is 100% a relic of times past.

1149
01:41:32,825 --> 01:41:37,547
[SPEAKER_03]: When the game starts, you have to answer a question based off details in the instruction manual in order to play the game.

1150
01:41:50,356 --> 01:42:04,202
[SPEAKER_03]: What's really fun about this game is that if you do, if you answer the question incorrectly, you get all the way to the start of the race and as soon as go is waved, a police siren is heard and you are arrested in game for driving a stolen vet.

1151
01:42:05,842 --> 01:42:06,302
[SPEAKER_05]: That's funny.

1152
01:42:06,322 --> 01:42:06,762
[SPEAKER_05]: That's creative.

1153
01:42:06,782 --> 01:42:07,142
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.

1154
01:42:09,563 --> 01:42:14,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just say quickly, though, it always blows me away how all these racing games are set in San Francisco, which I get to an extent.

1155
01:42:15,025 --> 01:42:21,647
[SPEAKER_05]: You have the landmarks and the hills of San Francisco make it interesting and everything, but just as somebody who drives a lot in San Francisco,

1156
01:42:23,147 --> 01:42:27,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Real racing in San Francisco is being stuck in traffic all fucking day.

1157
01:42:27,791 --> 01:42:29,552
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't race in San Francisco.

1158
01:42:30,113 --> 01:42:31,194
[SPEAKER_05]: There's too many cars.

1159
01:42:31,234 --> 01:42:36,077
[SPEAKER_03]: You race to make it down five miles on the 101 in like 30 minutes when you're already late for your appointment.

1160
01:42:36,318 --> 01:42:38,319
[SPEAKER_05]: And heaven help you if Bart is striking.

1161
01:42:40,141 --> 01:42:42,603
[SPEAKER_03]: As I learned when I came into town last time.

1162
01:42:43,163 --> 01:42:45,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, 100% correct.

1163
01:42:46,046 --> 01:42:47,528
[SPEAKER_03]: The core of the game, it is a racing game.

1164
01:42:47,568 --> 01:42:54,716
[SPEAKER_03]: You pick one of four types of Corvettes, age appropriate, and choose one of four European sports cars as your opponent.

1165
01:42:54,816 --> 01:43:02,425
[SPEAKER_03]: There are four key destinations to race, the fourth being a worldwide tour encompassing the three previous levels.

1166
01:43:03,165 --> 01:43:14,469
[SPEAKER_03]: and despite the display of American Corvette dickwagging, the funnier part of this game is that if you lose to your opponent, one of the most often messages you get is, don't feel bad, I programmed this game.

1167
01:43:14,869 --> 01:43:19,010
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently the developers may have been more in love with the European sports cars than the Corvette.

1168
01:43:19,090 --> 01:43:22,531
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's a very interesting mix of cultures there.

1169
01:43:23,711 --> 01:43:28,113
[SPEAKER_03]: There are degrees of difficulty and realism on the easiest mode called Trainee.

1170
01:43:28,213 --> 01:43:31,574
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be no car damage, police will not be a factor.

1171
01:43:32,194 --> 01:43:37,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, turns will be tight and cruise control will just be full speed at all times.

1172
01:43:37,278 --> 01:43:43,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you collide with something, you will instantly go back up to your cruise control speed when the object moves out of your way.

1173
01:43:43,382 --> 01:43:48,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there are collisions, there are damage, there is realism to the extent you can call it for 1989.

1174
01:43:51,047 --> 01:44:14,304
[SPEAKER_03]: as you increase in difficulty these various options will start becoming more and more realistic if you speed go down a wrong way go down a one-way street the wrong way oh hey look at that Bay Bridge or I assume that's the Golden Gate Bridge yeah run through red lights and police will start to pursue you you will get pulled over and you will even have to give your excuse to the officer before he writes you a citation

1175
01:44:14,924 --> 01:44:16,604
[SPEAKER_03]: There is even manslaughter.

1176
01:44:16,784 --> 01:44:25,446
[SPEAKER_03]: There are characters in the city of San Francisco that you can run into and they go from a standing crude sprite to a flattened crude sprite.

1177
01:44:26,627 --> 01:44:29,907
[SPEAKER_03]: The pro difficulty level turns all of these on on full realism.

1178
01:44:30,007 --> 01:44:33,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Damage, traction, police, and cruise control are all said to be realistic.

1179
01:44:34,228 --> 01:44:35,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty convincingly too, I will say.

1180
01:44:36,009 --> 01:44:41,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and by the way, your opponent is immune to all of this and is damn fast.

1181
01:44:41,330 --> 01:44:42,630
[SPEAKER_03]: He's incredibly frustrating.

1182
01:44:43,050 --> 01:44:50,160
[SPEAKER_03]: This game was oodles of fun for me when I was, well, it came out when I was four, but I'm sure I was playing it more when I was five, six, or seven.

1183
01:44:50,841 --> 01:44:59,272
[SPEAKER_03]: And despite how crude it is, there's just something colorful, fun, defined, and really, really incredibly interesting about this game.

1184
01:44:59,412 --> 01:44:59,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Stunt Racing

1185
01:45:16,408 --> 01:45:20,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Movie Stunts, where you go over the loop and all that shit.

1186
01:45:20,610 --> 01:45:29,295
[SPEAKER_05]: That game looks like utter garbage now, but back in the day, we were plunking down a dollar because, dude, you could drive around a loop.

1187
01:45:30,695 --> 01:45:31,416
[SPEAKER_05]: And we loved it.

1188
01:45:31,476 --> 01:45:33,177
[SPEAKER_05]: And fail every single time.

1189
01:45:33,317 --> 01:45:34,537
[SPEAKER_05]: In its VR realness.

1190
01:45:34,557 --> 01:45:36,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Test drive 3, man.

1191
01:45:37,419 --> 01:45:40,360
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, sorry, Jason.

1192
01:45:40,420 --> 01:45:45,323
[SPEAKER_03]: This game is as zany as it is shockingly deep to the point that it can actually represent it.

1193
01:45:45,783 --> 01:45:57,596
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't want to race, there's also a tour mode which will immediately warp you to time period appropriate landmarks, the Coit Tower, the Ferry Building, Fisherman's Wharf, and the Piers, the Transamerica Pyramid, and of course, Lombard Street.

1194
01:45:57,776 --> 01:46:00,018
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of its glory completely represented in this game.

1195
01:46:00,879 --> 01:46:26,982
[SPEAKER_03]: The kicker of this game is that there's a lot of crude and silly elements, like for example, I'm staring at the video right now, and there's a gear, there's a shifter, there's the gear box, no, there's the shifter, with the character's hand on it, and the gear is represented by a little notch in, you know, one is top left, two is bottom left, et cetera, et cetera, but the hand never moves, there's just this little switch that goes through the image.

1196
01:46:28,223 --> 01:46:30,246
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube for VET, you'll see what I'm talking about.

1197
01:46:30,426 --> 01:46:31,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Automatic or manual, you can do it both.

1198
01:46:33,430 --> 01:46:41,640
[SPEAKER_03]: The kicker of all this game, and we were talking about this before with Atari and everything else, this game was less than one megabyte in size.

1199
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:47,366
[SPEAKER_03]: One single floppy disk for the whole of the Upper Peninsula.

1200
01:46:47,987 --> 01:46:51,630
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, these objects are crude, but they're frickin' 3D standing objects.

1201
01:46:51,930 --> 01:46:55,613
[SPEAKER_03]: This game actually does have terrain, so you actually go sloped roads.

1202
01:46:56,053 --> 01:46:59,755
[SPEAKER_03]: The background images are cute, there's EGA dithering.

1203
01:46:59,775 --> 01:47:02,637
[SPEAKER_05]: There were some serious polygons on that Golden Gate Bridge.

1204
01:47:02,677 --> 01:47:03,078
[SPEAKER_03]: There are.

1205
01:47:03,138 --> 01:47:08,321
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing the objects that they put together to make this game for less than one megabyte.

1206
01:47:09,022 --> 01:47:10,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Completely astounding.

1207
01:47:11,354 --> 01:47:12,895
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, there it is.

1208
01:47:13,435 --> 01:47:18,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Look into racing games on the PCs passed with the classic game of the week, Vette.

1209
01:47:19,118 --> 01:47:19,858
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, there it is.

1210
01:47:19,958 --> 01:47:24,480
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Vette with an explanation point, not like, you know, my first pet vet.

1211
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:25,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, or something like that.

1212
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:27,001
[SPEAKER_03]: My first pet accident.

1213
01:47:27,121 --> 01:47:28,042
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, there it is.

1214
01:47:29,382 --> 01:47:30,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much, Jason.

1215
01:47:30,202 --> 01:47:30,843
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a good pick.

1216
01:47:30,963 --> 01:47:31,343
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1217
01:47:31,403 --> 01:47:34,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I like hearing about games that I would have never looked up otherwise.

1218
01:47:34,524 --> 01:47:37,766
[SPEAKER_05]: And considering that I did play a lot of old school games, I'd actually never heard of this game.

1219
01:47:38,186 --> 01:47:40,088
[SPEAKER_05]: So you stumped me on that one.

1220
01:47:40,128 --> 01:47:40,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job, Jason.

1221
01:47:41,289 --> 01:47:41,529
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1222
01:47:41,969 --> 01:47:45,432
[SPEAKER_05]: That does it for Part A, but we have plenty more show to come after a quick break.

1223
01:47:45,752 --> 01:47:47,694
[SPEAKER_05]: We have rapid-fire news coming at you.

1224
01:47:47,754 --> 01:47:50,917
[SPEAKER_05]: The Fugle Question of the Week, talking about sales and frugal gaming.

1225
01:47:51,577 --> 01:47:53,439
[SPEAKER_05]: News about current racing games.

1226
01:47:53,739 --> 01:47:57,462
[SPEAKER_05]: So going from a classic racer to things like Forza 5 and Gran Turismo 6.

1227
01:47:58,183 --> 01:48:05,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Your emails, your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR and plenty more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1228
01:48:11,929 --> 01:48:22,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday night, November the 24th of 2013, with our 528th episode already in progress.

1229
01:48:22,659 --> 01:48:24,260
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had a heck of a show so far tonight.

1230
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:24,981
[SPEAKER_05]: We have.

1231
01:48:25,061 --> 01:48:26,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason's joining us here.

1232
01:48:26,102 --> 01:48:29,265
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are just joining us live, DarkSakura out for the night.

1233
01:48:29,305 --> 01:48:33,789
[SPEAKER_05]: She had a prior engagement, a family affair, as those things tend to happen this time of year.

1234
01:48:33,809 --> 01:48:34,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.

1235
01:48:34,409 --> 01:48:43,741
[SPEAKER_05]: And real quickly, since Thanksgiving week is this coming week here in America, I just want to wish all of our listeners who are celebrating Thanksgiving this coming week, I want to wish you all a happy Thanksgiving.

1236
01:48:44,622 --> 01:48:51,210
[SPEAKER_05]: And we here at Orange Launch Radio, as cheesy as it sounds, we really are thankful for all of you guys who take the time out of your day to listen.

1237
01:48:51,590 --> 01:48:53,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Those of you that participate with the show here live on Sunday nights,

1238
01:48:54,253 --> 01:49:04,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Those of you that listen via the podcast, those of you that leave comments at vognetwork.com, those of you that email, those of you that leave the kind reviews on iTunes and Stitcher and all that, we just really appreciate you guys.

1239
01:49:04,658 --> 01:49:06,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for being a part of the community.

1240
01:49:06,418 --> 01:49:07,819
[SPEAKER_05]: You are our motivation.

1241
01:49:08,139 --> 01:49:09,720
[SPEAKER_05]: That is why we've been here for the past

1242
01:49:10,460 --> 01:49:11,440
[SPEAKER_05]: God, how long has it been?

1243
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:12,541
[SPEAKER_05]: 11 plus years at this point.

1244
01:49:12,881 --> 01:49:13,761
[SPEAKER_05]: I have lost count.

1245
01:49:14,161 --> 01:49:14,961
[SPEAKER_05]: It has hit that point.

1246
01:49:14,981 --> 01:49:16,961
[SPEAKER_05]: I have lost count of how many episodes we've had.

1247
01:49:17,021 --> 01:49:20,962
[SPEAKER_05]: But since June of 2002, we've been here at Orange Laundry.

1248
01:49:20,982 --> 01:49:22,042
[SPEAKER_05]: We are thankful for you guys.

1249
01:49:22,383 --> 01:49:23,103
[SPEAKER_05]: You keep us going.

1250
01:49:23,423 --> 01:49:25,143
[SPEAKER_05]: So happy Thanksgiving to all you out there.

1251
01:49:25,403 --> 01:49:39,006
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you aren't in America, you're Canadian or you're British or Australian or from another country that doesn't have Thanksgiving this week, then I will say enjoy your week making fun of us and our Black Friday mania and all that crap.

1252
01:49:39,486 --> 01:50:02,886
[SPEAKER_05]: So enjoy your week making fun of us for all of that We deserve it, quite frankly But I'm hoping for some good deals come Cyber Monday I'm crossing my fingers and my toes Maybe I can get Diablo 3 on PlayStation 3 at a steel price on Cyber Monday Because I'm certainly not braving those crowds on Black Friday I will say this, I have gone out on Black Friday late at night And it's just like any other day

1253
01:50:03,526 --> 01:50:29,046
[SPEAKER_05]: if you go at like 7 or 8 o'clock at night to Target or whatever it's just like any other day because all the crazies are done they went to bed all the TVs for 99 bucks or whatever crazy shit's going on they're all long since sold out so nobody's around for those anymore so Black Friday's not so bad in that regard which is good because sometimes I realize I need toothpaste and then oh shit I don't want to be anywhere near a store on Black Friday but there you go

1254
01:50:30,247 --> 01:50:52,988
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just hoping there's been enough pushback that stores don't make a habit of actually being open on Thanksgiving night like prior to midnight Friday's rough and the 4am starts and the midnight starts and all that kind of crap is rough but at least it's on Friday companies that have talked about being open on Thanksgiving night like 8pm or some nonsense like that

1255
01:50:53,608 --> 01:50:59,293
[SPEAKER_03]: I seriously hope that that is not prolific and does not trend in future years.

1256
01:50:59,513 --> 01:51:07,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to deviate too much from the topic of video games, but since a lot of video games are on sale during this special period, we'll go into this a little bit.

1257
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:09,801
[SPEAKER_05]: I do kind of understand both sides of it.

1258
01:51:10,342 --> 01:51:12,263
[SPEAKER_05]: If the audience wasn't there for it, they wouldn't do it.

1259
01:51:13,044 --> 01:51:16,307
[SPEAKER_05]: They do have to get the particular sales and all that.

1260
01:51:16,447 --> 01:51:17,868
[SPEAKER_05]: I do to some extent...

1261
01:51:18,328 --> 01:51:18,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1262
01:51:39,474 --> 01:52:06,906
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's that no no no no we do not get two days off of work to celebrate Black Friday and that's starting to be what it's becoming and that's the part that gets me more than anything is when we're starting to eclipse Thanksgiving and you know that's that's where things get a little little I don't like it for me but you know there's a lot of places that don't hospitals don't stop running on Thanksgiving so let's give thanks to those folks that you know work hard when the

1263
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:10,461
[SPEAKER_03]: and then deal with the trampling crazies the day afterwards.

1264
01:52:10,521 --> 01:52:11,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

1265
01:52:11,241 --> 01:52:11,662
[SPEAKER_03]: No kidding.

1266
01:52:11,962 --> 01:52:12,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had four hours.

1267
01:52:12,682 --> 01:52:14,363
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm talking about.

1268
01:52:14,443 --> 01:52:16,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Not even 24 hours goes by before that stuff happens.

1269
01:52:16,824 --> 01:52:17,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1270
01:52:17,684 --> 01:52:18,425
[SPEAKER_05]: So, all right.

1271
01:52:19,165 --> 01:52:19,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

1272
01:52:19,805 --> 01:52:21,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get back into some rapid fire news.

1273
01:52:21,506 --> 01:52:23,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Get back to what the games are all about.

1274
01:52:23,647 --> 01:52:23,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1275
01:52:24,187 --> 01:52:32,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so there was a lot of Persona announcements after a countdown, and it was funny, they had some videos that go along with it.

1276
01:52:33,609 --> 01:52:45,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Trolling Persona fans, they had a video with this old woman that was announcing something, and they had a trailer in the background of it playing in Akihabara, and...

1277
01:52:46,872 --> 01:52:51,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Persona 5 Announced for PS3 Winter 2014 Persona Q Shadow of the Labyrinth 3DS June 5th in Japan North America

1278
01:53:15,699 --> 01:53:23,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Persona, or P4U, Persona 4, the Ultimax Ultra Suplex Hold on PS3.

1279
01:53:23,441 --> 01:53:27,043
[SPEAKER_06]: That is going to be a follow-up to Persona 4 Arena.

1280
01:53:28,283 --> 01:53:35,465
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's Persona 4 Dancing All Night that's going to be coming to Vita.

1281
01:53:35,925 --> 01:53:40,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's supposed to be a music game, a rhythm action game, I guess.

1282
01:53:40,567 --> 01:53:41,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that should be fun.

1283
01:53:41,767 --> 01:53:43,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and that's coming in autumn of 2014.

1284
01:53:43,769 --> 01:53:47,333
[SPEAKER_05]: So lots of Persona for you.

1285
01:53:47,533 --> 01:53:52,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Persona fans still not satisfied, even though that's probably like literally 5,000 hours of gameplay.

1286
01:53:53,439 --> 01:53:55,001
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm teasing, obviously.

1287
01:53:55,061 --> 01:53:56,142
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, that is exciting.

1288
01:53:57,223 --> 01:54:12,664
[SPEAKER_06]: considering the lack of good games based on this franchise Game of Thrones is going to be getting a brand new series of games or at least a game from Telltale and that's pretty awesome

1289
01:54:13,638 --> 01:54:15,139
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way it will be less than one game.

1290
01:54:15,239 --> 01:54:16,761
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be a series like everything else.

1291
01:54:17,381 --> 01:54:19,343
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm... I don't know.

1292
01:54:19,363 --> 01:54:20,244
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's pretty awesome.

1293
01:54:20,304 --> 01:54:23,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know they've had the strategy game, which is alright.

1294
01:54:23,426 --> 01:54:28,090
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they had that Game of Thrones game that came out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1295
01:54:28,130 --> 01:54:28,931
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of lame.

1296
01:54:29,411 --> 01:54:31,633
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can't go wrong with Telltale.

1297
01:54:32,134 --> 01:54:33,255
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no way they can fuck that up.

1298
01:54:33,355 --> 01:54:33,475
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1299
01:54:33,894 --> 01:54:42,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm just going to say this, as much as I agree and Telltale's put out a lot of quality stuff, I'm a little sad that that King's Quest thing didn't happen.

1300
01:54:42,618 --> 01:54:43,919
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little irritating.

1301
01:54:44,119 --> 01:54:49,801
[SPEAKER_05]: I was really looking forward to the Telltale King's Quest game, so the fact that that kind of didn't happen is sad.

1302
01:54:49,861 --> 01:54:51,662
[SPEAKER_05]: But yay Game of Thrones, I guess.

1303
01:54:51,862 --> 01:54:56,044
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm totally using this story as an excuse to bitch about King's Quest not happening.

1304
01:54:56,064 --> 01:54:57,505
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, but I had to.

1305
01:54:58,445 --> 01:55:01,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I would think probably Activision's gonna be at fault there.

1306
01:55:02,788 --> 01:55:05,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, they're the ones that have the license, don't they?

1307
01:55:05,210 --> 01:55:11,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, but, you know, fuck them.

1308
01:55:11,175 --> 01:55:12,076
[SPEAKER_06]: What are they gonna do with it?

1309
01:55:12,276 --> 01:55:14,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Treyarch, First Person Shooter, King's Quest.

1310
01:55:16,199 --> 01:55:17,780
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd still play that, but yeah.

1311
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:18,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Arrgh.

1312
01:55:19,922 --> 01:55:20,262
[SPEAKER_06]: No idea.

1313
01:55:20,282 --> 01:55:22,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then, of course, um...

1314
01:55:26,229 --> 01:55:30,570
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it's sort of a surprise that John Carmack is leaving id Software.

1315
01:55:30,590 --> 01:55:39,474
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that he's working with the Oculus folks as their chief technology officer.

1316
01:55:39,754 --> 01:55:43,676
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure what else he's doing, but he is resigning.

1317
01:55:46,737 --> 01:55:49,598
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been at the company for 17 years, but it's too bad.

1318
01:55:51,189 --> 01:55:52,990
[SPEAKER_03]: That seems short for some reason.

1319
01:55:54,091 --> 01:55:54,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that?

1320
01:55:54,391 --> 01:55:56,733
[SPEAKER_03]: 17 puts it back to 1996.

1321
01:55:58,274 --> 01:56:02,277
[SPEAKER_03]: But didn't... That was like after Doom and everything.

1322
01:56:02,297 --> 01:56:04,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't he there for... I thought so too.

1323
01:56:04,819 --> 01:56:06,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm just fucking up my ID software history.

1324
01:56:06,781 --> 01:56:07,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1325
01:56:07,779 --> 01:56:11,440
[SPEAKER_06]: My question is, so is that why Rage was on sale this weekend?

1326
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:17,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Your golden parachute is made up of the sales of this game.

1327
01:56:17,681 --> 01:56:18,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Oculus Rift, though.

1328
01:56:19,341 --> 01:56:20,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason, have you played Oculus Rift?

1329
01:56:21,502 --> 01:56:22,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and I didn't mention that.

1330
01:56:24,122 --> 01:56:36,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I got back into town, if I didn't mention this, I don't remember when I actually played it, so I may or may not have mentioned it last time I was on the show, but I've been wanting to get my hands on an Oculus Rift, but not out of my own pocket.

1331
01:56:37,806 --> 01:56:47,794
[SPEAKER_03]: There is an Oculus Rift at the office owned by a co-worker of mine that leaves it there because he and a friend of his sometimes stay late and do, you know, hack on 3D projects and that kind of stuff.

1332
01:56:49,055 --> 01:56:54,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I have... Hack on 3D projects, play 3D pornography games, you know.

1333
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:56,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, play 3D games most definitely.

1334
01:56:57,082 --> 01:56:57,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't doubt that one.

1335
01:56:58,183 --> 01:56:58,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?

1336
01:56:58,864 --> 01:57:01,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's a whole other discussion.

1337
01:57:01,186 --> 01:57:02,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Just remember what the internet's for, Jason.

1338
01:57:03,007 --> 01:57:03,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1339
01:57:04,008 --> 01:57:06,750
[SPEAKER_03]: A for the awesome, A for the awesome

1340
01:57:23,803 --> 01:57:25,824
[SPEAKER_03]: That game is fucking fantastic with the Oculus Rift.

1341
01:57:26,344 --> 01:57:27,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my dear sweet God.

1342
01:57:27,624 --> 01:57:38,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that game just in general, but having, you know, there's contention about which display mode to use with the Oculus Rift, whether head tracking should be where you're aiming is.

1343
01:57:39,028 --> 01:57:39,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

1344
01:57:39,688 --> 01:57:40,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Other people do whatever.

1345
01:57:40,748 --> 01:57:41,728
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what the choice is for.

1346
01:57:42,248 --> 01:57:49,411
[SPEAKER_03]: But for, you know, the skydiving simulator in a freaking Oculus Rift, oh my God, that is so much fun.

1347
01:57:49,871 --> 01:57:50,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely love it.

1348
01:57:53,041 --> 01:57:53,742
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been, uh...

1349
01:58:13,894 --> 01:58:27,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Two weeks ago, also, obviously still when I was in San Francisco, because that's where the Rift is, like I said, a couple of coworkers stayed late and one individual was demoing it to two other people.

1350
01:58:27,602 --> 01:58:37,288
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was kind of funny because one of them didn't understand that it was head tracking and not like... She said afterwards that she thought it was like augmented reality or something like that, that she'd be able to see through.

1351
01:58:37,708 --> 01:58:42,851
[SPEAKER_03]: So when somebody else is playing, she would go up and, hey, hey, wave on the other side of the Rift and we're like...

1352
01:58:43,972 --> 01:59:09,109
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't work that way, she can't see you And then when she actually put it on, she still had that mentality And so she was doing the Italy house demo, if you saw just the basic FPS I did, I did And so there were like wispy things in the air, like the torches would let out those little quick flames I think she said butterflies and maybe even leaves, I actually kind of don't remember it myself

1353
01:59:09,549 --> 01:59:21,353
[SPEAKER_03]: but she was walking around and she would, you know, she would wave her arm at him and she would flick, she would try to hit him and obviously nothing happened except for adjusted

1354
01:59:23,035 --> 01:59:24,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1355
01:59:48,473 --> 01:59:49,114
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1356
02:00:15,493 --> 02:00:17,835
[SPEAKER_06]: other than game console with better specs.

1357
02:00:18,316 --> 02:00:19,857
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fucking PC with better specs.

1358
02:00:19,897 --> 02:00:20,477
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

1359
02:00:21,518 --> 02:00:23,600
[SPEAKER_06]: That is something that has a little bit more of a hook.

1360
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:28,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting way to look at it.

1361
02:00:29,225 --> 02:00:43,257
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on with some more rapid fire news, though, including here's another story about fucking Twitch, but it's about Minecraft, which that's a game that won't die in a community that won't die.

1362
02:00:43,417 --> 02:00:43,657
[SPEAKER_05]: And with

1363
02:00:43,697 --> 02:00:44,177
[SPEAKER_05]: and Oculus Support.

1364
02:01:09,410 --> 02:01:12,152
[SPEAKER_05]: This was kind of outlined at MineCon recently.

1365
02:01:12,512 --> 02:01:17,016
[SPEAKER_05]: But now in Minecraft, you do a quick visit to enable streaming in the account settings.

1366
02:01:17,296 --> 02:01:18,637
[SPEAKER_05]: All you have to do, press F6.

1367
02:01:18,837 --> 02:01:19,318
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1368
02:01:19,938 --> 02:01:23,501
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you need to walk through the features, that's available, of course, on YouTube.

1369
02:01:23,521 --> 02:01:25,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, people can stream and then archive to YouTube.

1370
02:01:26,203 --> 02:01:26,624
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that.

1371
02:01:27,024 --> 02:01:29,346
[SPEAKER_05]: So many more Minecraft streams to come.

1372
02:01:29,666 --> 02:01:32,489
[SPEAKER_05]: The creators of Minecraft, very good about...

1373
02:01:33,910 --> 02:01:40,275
[SPEAKER_05]: They do not try to enforce copyrights on any of their stuff on Twitch or YouTube or any of that.

1374
02:01:40,295 --> 02:01:41,877
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, go forth and mine.

1375
02:01:42,237 --> 02:01:44,279
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just make all the Minecraft stuff you want.

1376
02:01:44,319 --> 02:01:48,603
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, Hunger Games, Minecraft, YouTubes, they're everywhere.

1377
02:01:49,043 --> 02:01:49,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are huge.

1378
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:50,404
[SPEAKER_05]: They look fun.

1379
02:01:50,664 --> 02:01:52,806
[SPEAKER_06]: I just never could find something to join in with.

1380
02:01:53,547 --> 02:01:57,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish we could do one of those, but I know it's a lot of work.

1381
02:01:57,611 --> 02:01:58,832
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a script for it, but...

1382
02:01:59,707 --> 02:02:02,489
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to play Final Fantasy XIV and World of Warcraft.

1383
02:02:20,462 --> 02:02:45,368
[SPEAKER_05]: and uh don't know if these are a limited time deal or what have you it costs 500 coins if you want these posters so there you go by the way you can also get a Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past for 150 coins uh for the Wii Virtual Console because it's not out on Wii U yet but I'm sure it will be before too long in fact I haven't looked at what Virtual Console games came out for Wii U recently but there was a lot of um let's just say scraping the bottom of the barrel

1384
02:02:46,548 --> 02:02:50,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the really old Nintendo launch titles that people don't care about anymore, like Clue Clueland.

1385
02:02:50,691 --> 02:02:54,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, fans of Clue Clueland, but let's be real, no one care.

1386
02:02:54,495 --> 02:02:57,477
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's been what some of the virtual console releases have been lately.

1387
02:02:59,318 --> 02:03:02,601
[SPEAKER_05]: The next-gen console wars did continue in South Park.

1388
02:03:02,741 --> 02:03:06,444
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about this a little bit last week when the first half of South Park aired.

1389
02:03:06,744 --> 02:03:10,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, sure enough, it was a two-part episode, and the second half did air this week.

1390
02:03:11,508 --> 02:03:13,910
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the continued story of Black Friday...

1391
02:03:15,171 --> 02:03:18,292
[SPEAKER_05]: A Song of Ass and Fire apparently was the name of the episodes.

1392
02:03:19,072 --> 02:03:19,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Go figure.

1393
02:03:20,132 --> 02:03:21,052
[SPEAKER_05]: And there you go.

1394
02:03:21,212 --> 02:03:23,492
[SPEAKER_05]: They are dressed in a little bit of product placement.

1395
02:03:23,513 --> 02:03:28,753
[SPEAKER_05]: The characters in South Park were dressed up like the characters in the RPG which is coming out now March of 2014.

1396
02:03:29,133 --> 02:03:32,114
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people talking about the Princess Kenny anime intro.

1397
02:03:32,614 --> 02:03:33,314
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be honest.

1398
02:03:33,554 --> 02:03:35,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't watch this week's yet.

1399
02:03:35,355 --> 02:03:36,035
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty funny.

1400
02:03:36,195 --> 02:03:36,935
[SPEAKER_05]: I plum forgot.

1401
02:03:37,615 --> 02:03:38,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Who won the console war in the end?

1402
02:03:39,115 --> 02:03:39,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Spoilers.

1403
02:03:39,655 --> 02:03:40,235
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't watch it.

1404
02:03:40,335 --> 02:03:42,756
[SPEAKER_06]: But I saw that sequence so I watched it on YouTube.

1405
02:03:43,036 --> 02:03:43,296
[SPEAKER_06]: God damn.

1406
02:03:43,476 --> 02:03:43,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn it.

1407
02:03:43,816 --> 02:03:45,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably better we don't answer that for spoilers.

1408
02:03:45,118 --> 02:03:45,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I guess that's true.

1409
02:03:45,738 --> 02:03:46,299
[SPEAKER_05]: For spoilers.

1410
02:03:46,359 --> 02:03:48,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people are going to be like, your show spoils things.

1411
02:03:49,562 --> 02:03:49,882
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1412
02:03:50,263 --> 02:03:50,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.

1413
02:03:50,923 --> 02:03:51,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Jason, what do you have for us?

1414
02:03:52,004 --> 02:03:52,625
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1415
02:03:53,146 --> 02:03:56,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Polyphony Digital are attempting to do the impossible.

1416
02:03:57,043 --> 02:03:57,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1417
02:04:15,652 --> 02:04:15,932
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1418
02:04:37,019 --> 02:04:41,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, three PS1 games are available for free on a PlayStation Home scavenger hunt.

1419
02:04:42,041 --> 02:04:46,183
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a short little 13 hidden card minigame in home.

1420
02:04:46,523 --> 02:04:57,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Shouldn't take you more than 10-20 minutes tops, but the games are Twisted Metal, Warhawk, and Destruction Derby, which are frickin' great titles to add to your collection, so why not?

1421
02:04:58,707 --> 02:05:26,165
[SPEAKER_03]: and lastly Strider 2014 the reboot will also include the original version Strider 1 and 2 the PS1 versions rather not arcade or anything like that Strider 2014 is slated to be released on February 22nd will include the first two get your history on and enjoy these games oh I lied it's not just PlayStation 4 I'm crazy Strider 2014 is going to be on PC, Xbox 360 and Xbox One

1422
02:05:28,208 --> 02:05:28,948
[SPEAKER_05]: When's that out?

1423
02:05:29,768 --> 02:05:30,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed the date.

1424
02:05:30,448 --> 02:05:30,808
[SPEAKER_03]: February 22.

1425
02:05:31,029 --> 02:05:34,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay, there's something to look forward to in that early window.

1426
02:05:35,429 --> 02:05:37,310
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally forgot one of the games I played this week.

1427
02:05:37,330 --> 02:05:38,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to name it next week.

1428
02:05:38,750 --> 02:05:39,110
[SPEAKER_05]: It's alright.

1429
02:05:40,390 --> 02:05:42,611
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a download game I totally played earlier this week.

1430
02:05:42,671 --> 02:05:45,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I spent like an entire night playing it and then it was like, oh, new games to play.

1431
02:05:46,471 --> 02:05:47,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I do that way too much.

1432
02:05:47,692 --> 02:05:50,332
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll just say the download games really help bridge the gap.

1433
02:05:52,312 --> 02:05:55,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Alrighty, let's get to the Fugo question of the week.

1434
02:05:56,790 --> 02:06:02,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week here, we take Facebook and Google+, slam it together, you get FOOGLE!

1435
02:06:04,753 --> 02:06:06,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to the question of the week.

1436
02:06:07,554 --> 02:06:12,056
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will read some of the answers from Facebook and Google+, because we are running a little long tonight.

1437
02:06:12,116 --> 02:06:12,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, guys.

1438
02:06:14,697 --> 02:06:16,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the hell are the posts on Google+, I can't see them.

1439
02:06:17,618 --> 02:06:18,838
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, fine, we'll go to Facebook first.

1440
02:06:20,559 --> 02:06:23,240
[SPEAKER_05]: For some reason, my computer is running so slow, too.

1441
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:24,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry if it's causing the feed to skip.

1442
02:06:27,159 --> 02:06:30,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, all the account madness that we did earlier today may have been a factor in this.

1443
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:31,841
[SPEAKER_05]: That very well could be.

1444
02:06:31,861 --> 02:06:32,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

1445
02:06:32,961 --> 02:06:34,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I had to get the YouTube channel back.

1446
02:06:34,522 --> 02:06:35,962
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't posted to it for like four years.

1447
02:06:36,363 --> 02:06:36,603
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1448
02:06:36,623 --> 02:06:37,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, here we go.

1449
02:06:37,983 --> 02:06:38,804
[SPEAKER_05]: The Fugle Question of the Week.

1450
02:06:38,884 --> 02:06:39,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Brace yourselves.

1451
02:06:39,724 --> 02:06:41,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Holiday shopping season is coming.

1452
02:06:42,125 --> 02:06:46,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any holiday gaming deals you plan to pick up over the next few weeks?

1453
02:06:47,107 --> 02:06:52,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you typically wait for games to go on sale before buying them, or does the desire to play them right away usually win out?

1454
02:06:53,149 --> 02:06:55,731
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's go to some of the answers from Facebook.

1455
02:06:55,831 --> 02:06:57,873
[SPEAKER_05]: RedTheHaze says, For the Fallen Dreams says, America!

1456
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:33,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Andy R says the desire to play right away wins out almost all the time that and pre-order bonuses stupid as they sometimes are I'll probably still take a look at the deals coming up but buying a Playstation 4 last week and a 3DS a couple months ago means I'm holding off on spending too much at the moment

1457
02:07:34,905 --> 02:07:36,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, let's see.

1458
02:07:36,947 --> 02:07:43,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Daniel S says, there aren't any specific games I want to buy per se, but if they're a really good deal on something, I'll snatch it up.

1459
02:07:43,914 --> 02:07:50,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are usually Steam sales, but outlets have been known to clear their inventory of large, large collector's edition boxes.

1460
02:07:50,440 --> 02:07:51,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, that's really true.

1461
02:07:52,222 --> 02:07:56,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, DJ Synthetic says, I'm just hoping for a purple 3DS bundle type thing.

1462
02:07:56,586 --> 02:07:59,248
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to start playing something not Call of Duty Ghosts.

1463
02:08:00,129 --> 02:08:04,173
[SPEAKER_05]: and DJ Ranma S says GameStop has some sweet deals I plan to pick up.

1464
02:08:04,513 --> 02:08:09,658
[SPEAKER_05]: I do try to wait for games to go on sale but on the same token I'm in no rush to play a lot of the games that are coming out.

1465
02:08:09,959 --> 02:08:11,700
[SPEAKER_05]: So by the time I get that game it's usually under $30.

1466
02:08:11,740 --> 02:08:11,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Score!

1467
02:08:14,031 --> 02:08:18,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, now going over to Google+, now that it's loaded, let's look at just a few comments over there.

1468
02:08:18,794 --> 02:08:27,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft says, I already jumped the gun on getting a Zelda Wind Waker Wii U on the Mexican version of Black Friday, which is El Buen Fin, or The Great Weekend.

1469
02:08:27,701 --> 02:08:28,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not know that was a thing.

1470
02:08:29,382 --> 02:08:31,264
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned something tonight.

1471
02:08:31,284 --> 02:08:38,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Tech2030 says, Even though I just bought a PlayStation 4, if there is a killer Black Friday deal for a Wii U, I'll probably pull the trigger on that one.

1472
02:08:38,789 --> 02:08:42,672
[SPEAKER_05]: It's killing me that I'm not playing Super Mario 3D World and Wind Waker HD already.

1473
02:08:43,393 --> 02:08:51,690
[SPEAKER_05]: and lastly Sam H says Xbox Live and PlayStation Plus 12 month sub cards for 30 bucks at GameStop that's right Rob I'm going to GameStop

1474
02:08:52,594 --> 02:08:53,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what?

1475
02:08:53,555 --> 02:08:55,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't really blame you for that, Sam, though.

1476
02:08:55,235 --> 02:08:56,236
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a pretty good deal.

1477
02:08:56,756 --> 02:09:01,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Even I want to go get the PlayStation Plus card at that rate because it's a really good deal.

1478
02:09:01,939 --> 02:09:05,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are some of the answers from our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

1479
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:07,922
[SPEAKER_05]: By all means, please go read the rest of them.

1480
02:09:07,982 --> 02:09:14,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

1481
02:09:15,145 --> 02:09:15,886
[SPEAKER_05]: How about you guys?

1482
02:09:16,186 --> 02:09:23,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we might have dabbled into this a little bit, but do you have any Black Friday, Cyber Monday deals you guys are looking into?

1483
02:09:23,732 --> 02:09:28,096
[SPEAKER_05]: I already mentioned Diablo 3 is something I want to grab if I can get it dirt cheap.

1484
02:09:28,116 --> 02:09:30,438
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not paying $60 for a game I already have for free.

1485
02:09:31,038 --> 02:09:33,961
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the console version, yeah, I'm tempted.

1486
02:09:34,641 --> 02:09:34,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason?

1487
02:09:34,941 --> 02:09:35,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason?

1488
02:09:36,242 --> 02:09:38,324
[SPEAKER_03]: No, unless there's something on Steam that I have to have, which

1489
02:10:06,158 --> 02:10:08,359
[SPEAKER_06]: I say there probably isn't going to be, but you never know.

1490
02:10:08,419 --> 02:10:09,219
[SPEAKER_05]: There always will be.

1491
02:10:09,559 --> 02:10:12,360
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some indie title that wasn't on your radar that will be eventually.

1492
02:10:13,480 --> 02:10:15,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Spelunkies, I know one I really want to get.

1493
02:10:16,821 --> 02:10:19,762
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure the minute that goes on a deep steam sale, it'll be mine.

1494
02:10:20,782 --> 02:10:22,382
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot about steam sales, Jason.

1495
02:10:22,402 --> 02:10:22,762
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.

1496
02:10:22,922 --> 02:10:24,183
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to hurt.

1497
02:10:24,483 --> 02:10:25,263
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to hurt this year.

1498
02:10:26,277 --> 02:10:27,578
[SPEAKER_03]: You already said it once in this episode.

1499
02:10:27,818 --> 02:10:28,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Winter is coming.

1500
02:10:28,659 --> 02:10:29,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I can only mean one thing.

1501
02:10:29,579 --> 02:10:30,100
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1502
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:30,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Steam sale.

1503
02:10:31,521 --> 02:10:31,861
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1504
02:10:32,301 --> 02:10:39,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I still haven't even picked up, like, Bioshock Infinite, even though they had it for, like, $11 for, like, you know, all three games.

1505
02:10:39,747 --> 02:10:41,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Bioshock 1, 2, and Infinite.

1506
02:10:41,468 --> 02:10:42,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, I gotta get that, too.

1507
02:10:43,250 --> 02:10:43,830
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good point.

1508
02:10:44,130 --> 02:10:46,212
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be, like, five bucks by the time.

1509
02:10:47,193 --> 02:10:47,453
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1510
02:10:47,813 --> 02:10:52,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on with some other news, and then we'll get to the mailbag, the FU's of the week, and all that other good stuff.

1511
02:10:52,737 --> 02:10:53,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1512
02:10:53,037 --> 02:10:53,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1513
02:10:53,866 --> 02:11:04,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Forza 5 Forza 5, as people realize once they purchase the game, has a bit of a monetization business model to it.

1514
02:11:05,941 --> 02:11:08,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, you can play the game and unlock stuff.

1515
02:11:09,525 --> 02:11:36,057
[SPEAKER_06]: or you can buy some tokens and the tokens um they cost their price email for the tokens is really stupid actually because they have different bundles you can get and you're you know you usually think oh I'm buying more so I get a better deal on it it's actually the opposite if you buy less you get better deal on it um but they have um I guess they were talking about different cars and stuff for example if you were to buy like um

1516
02:11:38,491 --> 02:11:40,533
[SPEAKER_06]: The McLaren or something like that, the P1.

1517
02:11:41,353 --> 02:11:45,396
[SPEAKER_06]: The cost of that, the token pack, they're saying, well, this is all in euros, of course.

1518
02:11:45,977 --> 02:11:52,121
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're saying $15.99 would be, I guess it would cover both of those cars.

1519
02:11:54,042 --> 02:11:56,664
[SPEAKER_06]: $100 is like $79 euro.

1520
02:11:57,264 --> 02:11:58,525
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what that is over here.

1521
02:11:58,545 --> 02:11:59,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's like $0.89 over here.

1522
02:11:59,166 --> 02:11:59,346
[SPEAKER_06]: $79 euros is $107. $107.

1523
02:12:05,421 --> 02:12:09,363
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, 0.79 euros, not 79 euros.

1524
02:12:09,423 --> 02:12:09,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, $1.

1525
02:12:10,463 --> 02:12:12,384
[SPEAKER_06]: So about a dollar.

1526
02:12:14,525 --> 02:12:21,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, I think they did the same thing with Real Driving 3 when that came out or something, where they added it all together.

1527
02:12:21,947 --> 02:12:23,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say it was like $2,200 is what they...

1528
02:12:27,309 --> 02:12:35,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Token costs in the US 100 tokens runs you 99 cents If you want 325 tokens, it's going to run you $5 Yes, you heard correctly 325 tokens is $5 Whereas if I spent $5 on the 100 tokens, I get 500 tokens Because that makes fucking sense

1529
02:12:49,588 --> 02:12:53,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for letting me bundle easily, guys.

1530
02:12:53,911 --> 02:12:54,071
[SPEAKER_06]: $5.75 is $10.

1531
02:12:54,912 --> 02:12:57,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me throw this out there because the chat's being a little adamant about this point.

1532
02:12:57,914 --> 02:13:01,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft and chat at live.vognetwork.com First, I love this.

1533
02:13:01,877 --> 02:13:06,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Blackwolf at live.vognetwork.com says, The monetization ain't as bad as whatever Loki's about to say.

1534
02:13:07,701 --> 02:13:13,087
[SPEAKER_05]: and then Actdeft said monetization as in buying tokens and credits, those exist since Forza 3.

1535
02:13:13,868 --> 02:13:17,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I seriously don't know why people are making a big fuzz about this monetization thing.

1536
02:13:19,113 --> 02:13:24,339
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think in some extent it is an opportunity for people to pounce on a new system and

1537
02:13:24,879 --> 02:13:27,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, this is the route we're going down.

1538
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:35,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's because this game has half the cars that the last game had is more like it, and that they're offering... Oh, you can get more cars in DLC.

1539
02:13:35,605 --> 02:13:50,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I understand that's because the cars are modeled in higher resolution or whatever excuse they want to use, but it's a little shady when you're buying a system for $500, and then you're buying a game for $60, and then they are saying...

1540
02:13:50,652 --> 02:13:51,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you know what?

1541
02:13:51,253 --> 02:13:54,575
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also buy some cars too if you want to spend another $100 on them.

1542
02:13:54,816 --> 02:14:04,403
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of think that's where it's at is that people have hit their saturation point with seeing the freemium model in the premium games.

1543
02:14:05,044 --> 02:14:15,353
[SPEAKER_05]: And I kind of just think the reason why this is all catching fire and you're seeing it, it's not like we're the first ones to get out there and make it sound like it's all new because there's a lot of gaming blogs that are running this like it's...

1544
02:14:16,213 --> 02:14:22,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox One Poison I don't have a problem with it being on this game I have a problem with it being on any game that you're paying retail price for If it's a free to play game

1545
02:14:35,393 --> 02:14:36,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, fine.

1546
02:14:37,374 --> 02:14:39,175
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine, because they've got to make their money somehow.

1547
02:14:39,255 --> 02:14:45,077
[SPEAKER_06]: But you've already made your money selling me this game, and now you're saying, oh, well, we need more money.

1548
02:14:45,357 --> 02:14:48,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, for example, they were saying, though, that, I guess...

1549
02:14:51,303 --> 02:14:55,267
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the cars was like $100.

1550
02:14:57,549 --> 02:15:03,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Lotus E21 is 6 million credits or 10,000 tokens.

1551
02:15:04,676 --> 02:15:13,484
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, 10,000 tokens would be $100 in real money if you wanted to just buy the car and not play the game to unlock those tokens or credits.

1552
02:15:15,418 --> 02:15:15,999
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of lame.

1553
02:15:16,259 --> 02:15:16,820
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, fuck.

1554
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:22,306
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was kind of lame in Forza Horizon where they had this shit you could unlock for tokens.

1555
02:15:22,866 --> 02:15:23,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1556
02:15:23,547 --> 02:15:26,230
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's lame everywhere.

1557
02:15:26,671 --> 02:15:27,331
[SPEAKER_06]: And come on.

1558
02:15:28,152 --> 02:15:29,013
[SPEAKER_06]: This is ridiculous.

1559
02:15:29,113 --> 02:15:30,775
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no excuse that this needs to be in there.

1560
02:15:31,116 --> 02:15:35,761
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hate when the developers or publishers go, but the people wanted it.

1561
02:15:37,338 --> 02:15:38,779
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, no one fucking wants it.

1562
02:15:38,799 --> 02:15:42,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I remember a day when UpUpDownDown, LeftRightLeftRightBA, Stark gave me all that shit.

1563
02:15:42,962 --> 02:15:43,903
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know.

1564
02:15:44,343 --> 02:15:50,848
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will say, at least in the case of Forza Horizon, I still love that game an awful lot.

1565
02:15:50,948 --> 02:15:57,313
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not like this ruins the game, per se, and I haven't played Forza 5, so I can't speak to it, but I have played Forza Horizon a lot.

1566
02:15:58,014 --> 02:16:05,079
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't ruin the game, per se, but it's just one of those things where you kind of, you just, it's a disappointing sigh, I guess is really the only way I can phrase it.

1567
02:16:06,383 --> 02:16:06,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1568
02:16:07,464 --> 02:16:07,724
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1569
02:16:09,224 --> 02:16:09,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

1570
02:16:09,885 --> 02:16:15,728
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, if you think this is specific to Xbox and Forza, you would be incorrect.

1571
02:16:16,208 --> 02:16:16,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

1572
02:16:16,888 --> 02:16:25,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Gran Turismo 6 on the PlayStation 3, not 4, 3, will also have a system for in-game microtransactions.

1573
02:16:25,413 --> 02:16:30,035
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, this isn't something you can really pick on Forza specifically.

1574
02:16:30,395 --> 02:16:33,537
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just people starting to kind of hit their point where, you know...

1575
02:16:33,977 --> 02:16:34,558
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had it!

1576
02:16:34,678 --> 02:16:35,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Officially!

1577
02:16:35,819 --> 02:16:36,259
[SPEAKER_05]: With these.

1578
02:16:36,780 --> 02:16:41,545
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, purchasable as credits from PlayStation Network and physical retailers.

1579
02:16:41,565 --> 02:16:45,508
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get in-game credits to get vehicles, parts, and related accessories.

1580
02:16:46,329 --> 02:16:53,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we don't know exactly how much this is gonna be in the game and so forth, but it sounds like almost the exact same model that you see in Forza...

1581
02:16:53,596 --> 02:17:01,578
[SPEAKER_05]: also in Gran Turismo 6 which will be launching early December so you can see for yourself exactly if there's $100 cars to buy in this game as well.

1582
02:17:01,598 --> 02:17:20,864
[SPEAKER_06]: It's stupid that people even allow and unfortunately you're buying these games because they're good racing games but at the same time they're not putting I mean I guess the best advice you could say is just don't buy these but I'm sure to some extent people are going to buy some of them because they want oh you know maybe not necessarily $100 for a car but you know maybe they want just

1583
02:17:21,965 --> 02:17:37,360
[SPEAKER_06]: extra money or something I don't know they have it in Grand Theft Auto Grand Theft Auto 5 has where you can pay to get money online and they keep nerfing all the fucking payouts on everything so trying to convince people to spend money on that

1584
02:17:38,306 --> 02:17:42,390
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya in chat says, I'd assume in Gran Turismo you can still earn credits the old-fashioned way.

1585
02:17:43,371 --> 02:17:44,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also assuming that to be the case.

1586
02:17:44,992 --> 02:17:48,815
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost identical to what we just talked about with Forza 5, it seems.

1587
02:17:49,116 --> 02:17:55,641
[SPEAKER_06]: So how long is it that we're going to get that fucking energy meter for, you know, these games where, oh, my driver's tired now.

1588
02:17:55,722 --> 02:18:00,526
[SPEAKER_06]: He can't drive anymore, you know, for today because... In this case, it'll be a gas tank.

1589
02:18:00,886 --> 02:18:05,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Some Mountain Dew, you know, because they're going to have the product tie-in in there as well, and...

1590
02:18:05,458 --> 02:18:06,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1591
02:18:26,579 --> 02:18:29,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason, maybe you have some better news in the racing game world?

1592
02:18:29,141 --> 02:18:35,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Wrapping up our trifecta of racing, Mario Kart Arcade Grand Prix Deluxe is confirmed for US release.

1593
02:18:36,168 --> 02:18:48,599
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been in Japan since the summer of this year, and it will make its way to North America, well, rather just outside Japan, winter 2013, so imminently in the next month for arcades that are actually going to make the investment.

1594
02:18:49,479 --> 02:18:55,925
[SPEAKER_03]: It was also showcased at IAAPA as was re-raved that we mentioned earlier in the show.

1595
02:18:56,505 --> 02:19:06,173
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of technical discussion about the fact that it can retrofit in existing cabinets, reuse Dead Heat, I believe it was called.

1596
02:19:06,233 --> 02:19:08,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead Heat Riders motorcycle game.

1597
02:19:09,195 --> 02:19:14,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Cute trailer video that also includes the Taiko Drum character from Taiko Natasajin.

1598
02:19:15,080 --> 02:19:21,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Other various bits about what it's going to be powered by as far as the system internal.

1599
02:19:21,928 --> 02:19:36,685
[SPEAKER_03]: The really, really weird part about this article is that the author wrote this saying, One thing we are also sure about is that this is not the same game as what Nintendo will be releasing for Wii U later that they are calling Mario Kart 8.

1600
02:19:38,325 --> 02:19:45,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember back in the day when you would have Crystal Castles in the arcade, Crystal Castles on the 2600.

1601
02:19:55,298 --> 02:19:57,460
[SPEAKER_05]: It's technically supposed to be a port of the arcade game.

1602
02:19:57,940 --> 02:20:01,282
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not uncommon to think that home versions of games are ports of the arcade game.

1603
02:20:01,543 --> 02:20:04,324
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can see why they're like, this is different than Mario Kart 8.

1604
02:20:04,444 --> 02:20:07,787
[SPEAKER_03]: In large part, we are so far removed from that.

1605
02:20:08,107 --> 02:20:17,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it just struck me in the realization that these games are that different, that the Mario Kart arcade experience is that distinct.

1606
02:20:17,793 --> 02:20:24,318
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just like, minus music games, what else has been similar console and arcade?

1607
02:20:25,218 --> 02:20:29,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Time Crisis doesn't really exist in the console space anymore so far as I know.

1608
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly, it's because the arcades are dying out.

1609
02:20:32,301 --> 02:20:34,121
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, what, Super Street Fighter?

1610
02:20:34,542 --> 02:20:38,403
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's where the arcade game was almost based off the console.

1611
02:20:38,523 --> 02:20:39,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the answer to this question is...

1612
02:20:41,204 --> 02:20:48,909
[SPEAKER_03]: and Hydro Thunder and H2 Overdrive and that kind of stuff that did show up on the Xbox 360 Marketplace, Xbox Live Arcade Marketplace rather.

1613
02:20:49,070 --> 02:20:54,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a game I talked about a couple weeks ago on the show, Midway Arcade Origins, which is actual arcade ports of the emulators.

1614
02:20:55,114 --> 02:20:57,195
[SPEAKER_03]: From two decades ago, sure.

1615
02:20:57,675 --> 02:21:02,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, the new arcade Mario Kart has Taiko Drum as a character.

1616
02:21:02,659 --> 02:21:03,359
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to play that.

1617
02:21:03,399 --> 02:21:04,000
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds awesome.

1618
02:21:04,020 --> 02:21:04,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I said that.

1619
02:21:05,140 --> 02:21:05,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I said it was in the trailer.

1620
02:21:06,314 --> 02:21:06,914
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very cute.

1621
02:21:06,954 --> 02:21:07,955
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very awesome to see.

1622
02:21:09,036 --> 02:21:16,220
[SPEAKER_03]: This Nintendo Namco mutual happiness is really, really worthwhile.

1623
02:21:16,700 --> 02:21:19,862
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya says, I played the first Mario Kart arcade game and it was fun.

1624
02:21:19,902 --> 02:21:21,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Would love to play the third one.

1625
02:21:21,783 --> 02:21:24,645
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually did too when I was in Arizona.

1626
02:21:25,426 --> 02:21:30,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Mesa Golf Land has... Don't get it at Golf Land, whoopee.

1627
02:21:30,429 --> 02:21:31,869
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it was Grand Prix 1.

1628
02:21:31,929 --> 02:21:32,590
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very old.

1629
02:21:32,610 --> 02:21:34,111
[SPEAKER_03]: The cameras were shot to hell.

1630
02:21:34,191 --> 02:21:35,712
[SPEAKER_03]: The display was a little dim.

1631
02:21:36,392 --> 02:21:38,495
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was also very, very easy, which was kind of weird.

1632
02:21:38,655 --> 02:21:46,204
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, for being completely original gameplay mechanics, Mario Kart Grand Prix Arcade is quite fun.

1633
02:21:46,244 --> 02:21:48,447
[SPEAKER_03]: If you happen to come across it, definitely check it out.

1634
02:21:50,293 --> 02:21:51,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on.

1635
02:21:51,214 --> 02:21:51,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1636
02:21:52,114 --> 02:21:55,856
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also great for when you're drunk during your bachelor party.

1637
02:21:56,737 --> 02:21:58,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that one of the YouTubes on the Originals Radio account?

1638
02:21:58,998 --> 02:21:59,318
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is.

1639
02:21:59,379 --> 02:22:00,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's still there.

1640
02:22:00,559 --> 02:22:02,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that one still gets views.

1641
02:22:02,941 --> 02:22:04,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I should make ad money off that.

1642
02:22:04,642 --> 02:22:05,042
[SPEAKER_05]: You should.

1643
02:22:05,502 --> 02:22:06,343
[SPEAKER_06]: I get a portion though.

1644
02:22:07,424 --> 02:22:07,824
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1645
02:22:08,224 --> 02:22:09,205
[SPEAKER_05]: The show still runs.

1646
02:22:09,265 --> 02:22:09,926
[SPEAKER_05]: That's your portion.

1647
02:22:12,829 --> 02:22:16,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about NCAA again.

1648
02:22:17,273 --> 02:22:25,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, speaking of a publisher that's really having a karma sink or whatever, EA, holy shit.

1649
02:22:26,182 --> 02:22:28,864
[SPEAKER_06]: First, losing the NCAA...

1650
02:22:30,846 --> 02:22:31,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Game.

1651
02:22:31,627 --> 02:22:42,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, uh, NBA Live, you know, that game has been, you know, waiting to come out for years now, and they retooled it, retooled it, and the reviews have been fucking terrible.

1652
02:22:42,713 --> 02:22:44,133
[SPEAKER_06]: It just looks terrible.

1653
02:22:46,135 --> 02:22:48,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, they gotta be hurting over EDA Sports.

1654
02:22:48,416 --> 02:22:54,099
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, NCAA, um, they have sued EA now over the Lightness settlement.

1655
02:22:54,959 --> 02:22:57,821
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, you know, I guess, uh,

1656
02:23:00,168 --> 02:23:10,896
[SPEAKER_06]: with the $40 million settlement that was going, I guess, to students or student-athletes like this is in their legal dispute going back all the way to 2009.

1657
02:23:11,197 --> 02:23:20,644
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, this is, I guess, regarding they've not renewed the license.

1658
02:23:21,004 --> 02:23:25,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're trying to put it out now as some sort of EA Sports college football or something like that.

1659
02:23:27,269 --> 02:23:27,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me.

1660
02:23:28,650 --> 02:23:39,581
[SPEAKER_06]: They're saying the Collegiate Licensing Company, the CLC, is caught in the middle of a dispute between NCAA and EA, which should not involve us.

1661
02:23:40,041 --> 02:23:43,525
[SPEAKER_06]: And the CLC has valued the relationship with both NCAA and EA.

1662
02:23:44,125 --> 02:23:49,891
[SPEAKER_06]: While we hope that they can soon resolve their dispute, we see no reason for the CLC to be involved.

1663
02:23:50,111 --> 02:23:51,893
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, EA has declined...

1664
02:23:52,513 --> 02:23:59,778
[SPEAKER_06]: A sort of comments regarding the CELC being involved in this lawsuit in the first place.

1665
02:23:59,818 --> 02:24:06,702
[SPEAKER_06]: So either way, it doesn't look like the NCAA is going to be coming back for a college football game next year.

1666
02:24:09,024 --> 02:24:13,006
[SPEAKER_06]: That's too bad because that was one of the only good titles in the month of July.

1667
02:24:13,307 --> 02:24:14,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I guess it's going to be Persona.

1668
02:24:15,168 --> 02:24:15,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of Persona.

1669
02:24:16,469 --> 02:24:18,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Persona all year long.

1670
02:24:19,150 --> 02:24:19,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Your Persona.

1671
02:24:21,283 --> 02:24:21,864
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1672
02:24:39,078 --> 02:24:43,039
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe they are already out in Japan or about to come out right before the end of the year.

1673
02:24:43,279 --> 02:24:44,179
[SPEAKER_05]: December or something, right?

1674
02:24:44,520 --> 02:24:45,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we're getting them in March 2014.

1675
02:24:47,180 --> 02:24:50,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Specifically March 18th, 2014 is when North America gets it.

1676
02:24:50,781 --> 02:24:52,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Europe gets it on March 21st.

1677
02:24:53,142 --> 02:24:56,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that is the PlayStation 3 versions of the remaster.

1678
02:24:56,483 --> 02:24:57,783
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're looking to the Vita version...

1679
02:24:58,325 --> 02:25:00,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's been no announcement on that.

1680
02:25:00,648 --> 02:25:08,198
[SPEAKER_05]: And a press release from Square Enix Europe said, quote, full details of the PlayStation Vita version and release timing will be revealed at a future date.

1681
02:25:08,879 --> 02:25:09,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

1682
02:25:11,022 --> 02:25:11,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

1683
02:25:12,624 --> 02:25:13,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we'll see.

1684
02:25:14,787 --> 02:25:15,267
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1685
02:25:15,607 --> 02:25:16,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Poor Vita.

1686
02:25:17,108 --> 02:25:19,868
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it would have been great for the Vita if the Vita version came out first.

1687
02:25:20,408 --> 02:25:24,269
[SPEAKER_05]: That would have been really good for the Vita, but oh well, I guess I shouldn't encourage that.

1688
02:25:24,289 --> 02:25:26,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the Vita have a fully fledged Final Fantasy yet?

1689
02:25:27,090 --> 02:25:27,530
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it wouldn't.

1690
02:25:27,790 --> 02:25:29,550
[SPEAKER_03]: 13 predated it by a long shot.

1691
02:25:29,650 --> 02:25:41,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, Vita doesn't really have anything Final Fantasy per se, unless you'd want to count PSP games that you can play on Vita, like Tactics was a PlayStation Plus title at one point, and there's plenty of PS1 games.

1692
02:25:41,846 --> 02:26:04,433
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have the physical disc, the UMD of that alright, let's get to the mailbag every week you guys email us at mailbag at orange launch radio dot com and usually DarkSakura jumps in the mailbag both are applicable well if she sees things she doesn't like she might but no, she jumps in the mailbag head first but since she's not here tonight I will get the hazmat suit on and jump into the mailbag for you

1693
02:26:05,253 --> 02:26:33,780
[SPEAKER_05]: just two emails tonight to read here and the first one comes to us from a person who said please don't read my name so fine I will not so Anonymous writes us and says why I am getting an Xbox One instead of PlayStation 4 the Xbox One is better the Xbox doesn't require you to pay for a $5 a month PlayStation Plus membership for online multiplayer the PlayStation 4 however does require a $5 a month PlayStation Plus membership for online multiplayer

1694
02:26:34,878 --> 02:26:40,603
[SPEAKER_05]: The Xbox One version of Assassin's Creed, the Xbox One version of Watch Dogs.

1695
02:27:00,720 --> 02:27:01,501
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't argue with that.

1696
02:27:01,521 --> 02:27:02,122
[SPEAKER_06]: That's solid.

1697
02:27:02,302 --> 02:27:03,182
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a solid argument.

1698
02:27:03,202 --> 02:27:05,324
[SPEAKER_05]: That is some NeoGAF logic right there.

1699
02:27:05,444 --> 02:27:07,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job, anonymous emailer.

1700
02:27:07,886 --> 02:27:08,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job.

1701
02:27:10,087 --> 02:27:16,172
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm having one of those moments where it's like, not sure if troll or... You know, you laugh about that.

1702
02:27:16,592 --> 02:27:19,815
[SPEAKER_06]: But like over this week, I've been actually, I've had some downtime at work.

1703
02:27:19,855 --> 02:27:22,677
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been going through the Microsoft retail training program.

1704
02:27:23,037 --> 02:27:25,579
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I've been actually giving away some DLC codes I got from the...

1705
02:27:27,420 --> 02:27:28,942
[SPEAKER_06]: But holy shit, man.

1706
02:27:29,122 --> 02:27:32,605
[SPEAKER_06]: That is some of their arguments for the Xbox One.

1707
02:27:32,865 --> 02:27:34,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you can play used games on it.

1708
02:27:34,527 --> 02:27:37,510
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, yeah, cool.

1709
02:27:38,991 --> 02:27:43,575
[SPEAKER_03]: All those games that have just sat around for years and years and I don't really feel like bringing them out again.

1710
02:27:43,595 --> 02:27:45,037
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what would have really been news?

1711
02:27:45,517 --> 02:27:48,400
[SPEAKER_05]: You can play all your last generation games on it as well.

1712
02:27:48,480 --> 02:27:49,661
[SPEAKER_05]: It's backwards compatible.

1713
02:27:50,682 --> 02:27:51,162
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you.

1714
02:27:52,103 --> 02:27:58,665
[SPEAKER_05]: From people I know that are more casual gamers, like they like gaming, but they don't seek out shows like this or post to internet websites and things like that.

1715
02:27:59,245 --> 02:28:04,106
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the number one bitch I hear is that, well, I don't want to get a PlayStation 4 if it's not going to play PlayStation 3 games.

1716
02:28:04,766 --> 02:28:07,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, well, does the new Xbox play the other Xbox game?

1717
02:28:07,347 --> 02:28:07,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

1718
02:28:08,927 --> 02:28:10,828
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear that more than anything else.

1719
02:28:11,528 --> 02:28:12,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand why.

1720
02:28:13,248 --> 02:28:18,750
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably understand why because of all the graphic chips upgrades and the parts inside that have changed where that's not possible.

1721
02:28:19,070 --> 02:28:20,010
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm just telling you,

1722
02:28:22,188 --> 02:28:30,033
[SPEAKER_05]: The general public doesn't give a fuck because there's been other consoles that were backwards compatible that kind of instilled that in us.

1723
02:28:30,333 --> 02:28:31,653
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii played the GameCube games.

1724
02:28:31,693 --> 02:28:33,034
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii U plays the Wii games.

1725
02:28:33,054 --> 02:28:35,455
[SPEAKER_05]: The Game Boys are usually backwards compatible and so forth.

1726
02:28:35,475 --> 02:28:38,537
[SPEAKER_05]: And even Xbox 360 played some Xbox games.

1727
02:28:38,617 --> 02:28:41,659
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 3s, when they were new, would play PlayStation 2 games.

1728
02:28:41,939 --> 02:28:44,900
[SPEAKER_05]: PS2 did play PS1 games.

1729
02:28:44,921 --> 02:28:45,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.

1730
02:28:45,521 --> 02:28:47,462
[SPEAKER_05]: So there were some consoles in the past that kind of did that.

1731
02:28:47,862 --> 02:29:00,677
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just saying the funny thing is that those consoles are the minority and especially like Nintendo history up until the Wii had no backwards compatibility console wise because they didn't fit in slots anymore.

1732
02:29:01,418 --> 02:29:05,223
[SPEAKER_03]: And not to mention that shift from, you know, cartridge to disk just in general.

1733
02:29:06,624 --> 02:29:08,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, same experience here.

1734
02:29:08,425 --> 02:29:11,427
[SPEAKER_03]: I went out to brunch, lunch, something with a friend of mine.

1735
02:29:11,687 --> 02:29:18,531
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was one of the very first things out of his mouth is that the PlayStation 4 isn't... And this was before I knew about the architecture switch.

1736
02:29:19,091 --> 02:29:23,954
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, yeah, I hate Sony now because they're not playing all the games that I already own.

1737
02:29:24,455 --> 02:29:24,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I said...

1738
02:29:24,975 --> 02:29:27,778
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very strange, especially not even digital versions.

1739
02:29:28,579 --> 02:29:32,063
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as I figured out why that's the case, it all made sense.

1740
02:29:32,744 --> 02:29:33,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Same argument you just made.

1741
02:29:34,286 --> 02:29:35,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Had another point, slipped my mind.

1742
02:29:36,048 --> 02:29:36,569
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how it goes.

1743
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:37,260
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1744
02:29:38,061 --> 02:29:39,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we have another email here.

1745
02:29:39,323 --> 02:29:40,564
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from RossDealUT.

1746
02:29:42,125 --> 02:29:44,048
[SPEAKER_05]: RossDeal has a tendency to send the show novels.

1747
02:29:44,548 --> 02:29:48,973
[SPEAKER_05]: RossDeal, I'm going to invite you to post this on our forums in its entirety because it's a little bit long.

1748
02:29:48,993 --> 02:29:52,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I'm all about where every gamer has a voice, but it is still a three-hour show.

1749
02:29:52,136 --> 02:29:53,838
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is quite the little novel here.

1750
02:29:53,858 --> 02:29:56,961
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to try to get the gist of it here, but I'm going to be extremely paraphrasing.

1751
02:29:56,981 --> 02:29:58,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you do that, remember TLDL.

1752
02:29:59,884 --> 02:30:00,705
[SPEAKER_06]: and TLDR.

1753
02:30:01,065 --> 02:30:03,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, bullet points are great.

1754
02:30:03,787 --> 02:30:06,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that last email was a bunch of bullet points, right?

1755
02:30:06,770 --> 02:30:10,272
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't want to... It's not that the email is bad.

1756
02:30:10,373 --> 02:30:12,094
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just I only have a certain amount of time.

1757
02:30:12,114 --> 02:30:14,596
[SPEAKER_05]: But the more I talk about the time frames, the longer we drag things out.

1758
02:30:14,616 --> 02:30:16,778
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me read a portion of this email here from RossDLUT.

1759
02:30:17,478 --> 02:30:22,601
[SPEAKER_05]: who basically was emailing us to talk about who won the last console generation.

1760
02:30:22,641 --> 02:30:26,903
[SPEAKER_05]: He talked about that there were a few things that he kind of, you know, a few points he wanted to make about this.

1761
02:30:26,963 --> 02:30:31,365
[SPEAKER_05]: And first off was, I learned the most popular system may not fit your particular needs.

1762
02:30:31,726 --> 02:30:35,928
[SPEAKER_05]: While the Wii sold like absolute gangbusters, the games were stupidly few and far between.

1763
02:30:36,208 --> 02:30:43,312
[SPEAKER_05]: And while I don't speak for anyone else, I found myself fighting against the controls in games like Super Mario Galaxy where I should have been having a stupendous time.

1764
02:30:44,832 --> 02:30:47,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Secondly, I gave up AAA PC gaming.

1765
02:30:47,794 --> 02:30:55,880
[SPEAKER_05]: This was the generation where it became 100% impossible to buy a PC game that didn't require an online authentication or other form of invasive DRM.

1766
02:30:56,320 --> 02:31:10,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't bring myself so low as to pirate games, but between Steam's offline mode failing me numerous times and the PlayStation Network outage, I don't feel like any of the stuff I buy on a DRM platform is actually mine, so I abandoned those libraries and counted the loss as a lesson learned.

1767
02:31:11,090 --> 02:31:14,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned not to trust one iota of what I'm told in the gaming media.

1768
02:31:14,392 --> 02:31:15,593
[SPEAKER_05]: This show accepted, of course.

1769
02:31:16,354 --> 02:31:20,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really consider ourselves gaming media, because we're not trying to break news.

1770
02:31:21,139 --> 02:31:23,582
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just trying to talk about it.

1771
02:31:23,882 --> 02:31:27,826
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also hate the term gaming enthusiast, because some news doesn't make us enthusiastic.

1772
02:31:27,866 --> 02:31:29,668
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just gaming talkers.

1773
02:31:30,749 --> 02:31:30,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Outro Music

1774
02:31:48,139 --> 02:32:02,996
[SPEAKER_05]: he says in his email here this generation we saw gaming journalism degrade into the worst state it's been in since the crash of 83 reviews are made based on how big a franchise is not to appease publishers but to keep the fanboys off their asses um

1775
02:32:03,576 --> 02:32:23,032
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned to love Killzone was something he said the franchise started office and also ran on the PlayStation 2 a laughable attempt at a Halo killer however the ensuing games have shown remarkable improvement both in gameplay and storytelling and it's been an absolute pleasure to see the progress Guerrilla Games has made let's see um

1776
02:32:25,394 --> 02:32:26,415
[SPEAKER_05]: P.S.

1777
02:32:26,595 --> 02:32:29,857
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys were wondering about what made a cult game.

1778
02:32:30,278 --> 02:32:37,923
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to think of it in the same way as a cult movie, where it doesn't have a huge mainstream success, but instead finds a smaller, more dedicated, and enduring fanbase.

1779
02:32:38,323 --> 02:32:47,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Showgirls and Rocky Horror may not have made a lot of money at the box office, but they'll likely be remembered long after people have forgotten about the latest superhero fad movie.

1780
02:32:48,090 --> 02:32:50,612
[SPEAKER_05]: and PPS, the most important part of the entire email.

1781
02:32:50,632 --> 02:32:50,892
[SPEAKER_05]: You ready?

1782
02:32:51,332 --> 02:32:51,893
[SPEAKER_05]: PPS.

1783
02:32:52,433 --> 02:32:53,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, Loki?

1784
02:32:53,454 --> 02:32:56,096
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta up your game when it comes to parody porn names.

1785
02:32:56,916 --> 02:33:00,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's some you can use next time the topic comes up on the house.

1786
02:33:00,959 --> 02:33:02,460
[SPEAKER_05]: The Dark Knight Hardens.

1787
02:33:03,721 --> 02:33:05,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Shaving Private Ryan.

1788
02:33:05,472 --> 02:33:06,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even remember what the hell this was in reference to.

1789
02:33:07,012 --> 02:33:11,034
[SPEAKER_05]: The Shawskank Redemption or the Cock of Steel.

1790
02:33:12,314 --> 02:33:13,894
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking about porn on the last show.

1791
02:33:13,934 --> 02:33:14,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure we were.

1792
02:33:14,835 --> 02:33:15,655
[SPEAKER_05]: It was OLR.

1793
02:33:15,715 --> 02:33:16,675
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking about porn.

1794
02:33:17,195 --> 02:33:17,715
[SPEAKER_05]: It happens.

1795
02:33:18,115 --> 02:33:18,596
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1796
02:33:19,076 --> 02:33:19,296
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1797
02:33:19,336 --> 02:33:20,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, RawSteelUT.

1798
02:33:20,436 --> 02:33:25,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry I had to edit, but we got to keep things moving here because the show is already running long.

1799
02:33:25,858 --> 02:33:30,759
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to email us some thoughts, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to do so.

1800
02:33:31,239 --> 02:33:34,040
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also send us a tweet, twitter.com slash OLR.

1801
02:33:34,660 --> 02:33:36,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to the FUs of the week.

1802
02:33:37,022 --> 02:33:37,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

1803
02:33:37,923 --> 02:33:42,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we're mad and stuff and we're not gonna take it anymore.

1804
02:33:59,017 --> 02:34:00,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason, would you like to start us off tonight?

1805
02:34:01,238 --> 02:34:02,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I shall.

1806
02:34:02,478 --> 02:34:07,921
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to traffic, F you to parking, F you to critical mass.

1807
02:34:08,361 --> 02:34:21,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I love the human ingenuity and the things that, especially in San Francisco and Manhattan and any other completely over-full-to-the-brim location, what they have to deal with.

1808
02:34:21,666 --> 02:34:24,207
[SPEAKER_03]: God bless people's ingenuity and the way that they make things work.

1809
02:34:25,047 --> 02:34:26,547
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn, fuck Critical Mass.

1810
02:34:26,968 --> 02:34:29,268
[SPEAKER_03]: That stuff's just frustrating.

1811
02:34:29,288 --> 02:34:30,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's it.

1812
02:34:31,989 --> 02:34:32,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Loki.

1813
02:34:33,629 --> 02:34:35,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, F you the cookie clicker.

1814
02:34:36,850 --> 02:34:38,070
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why I'm still playing this.

1815
02:34:38,350 --> 02:34:38,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Amen.

1816
02:34:40,091 --> 02:34:45,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, my F you of the week goes to my scale, because it told me something I didn't want to hear yesterday.

1817
02:34:46,152 --> 02:34:47,112
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very angry at it.

1818
02:34:48,012 --> 02:34:49,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so also F you to the, uh,

1819
02:34:50,273 --> 02:34:51,014
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you next time.

1820
02:35:02,836 --> 02:35:08,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get back into a few more gaming news stories and Twitter topics and Skype line and all that good stuff.

1821
02:35:08,180 --> 02:35:11,783
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1822
02:35:12,043 --> 02:35:13,744
[SPEAKER_05]: But first, a couple more quick stories.

1823
02:35:13,784 --> 02:35:14,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1824
02:35:14,104 --> 02:35:17,787
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you could just pick up one of those Wii Fit meters and then you could download Wii Fit U for free.

1825
02:35:17,887 --> 02:35:22,931
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, and I could get the balance board out from under the TV, but Loki, it's so hard.

1826
02:35:25,858 --> 02:35:26,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Cablebox

1827
02:35:38,530 --> 02:35:39,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you have a story to read?

1828
02:35:41,172 --> 02:35:44,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Today I've walked 7,500 miles and three and a half.

1829
02:35:45,675 --> 02:35:48,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, not that many miles.

1830
02:35:48,116 --> 02:35:50,938
[SPEAKER_03]: 7,500 steps and three and a half miles.

1831
02:35:51,158 --> 02:35:52,139
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that, a Fitbit?

1832
02:35:52,840 --> 02:35:53,520
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got a Fitbit?

1833
02:35:53,760 --> 02:35:54,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you like that?

1834
02:35:54,621 --> 02:35:56,302
[SPEAKER_05]: I really do.

1835
02:35:56,402 --> 02:35:57,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it actually get you to walk more though?

1836
02:35:57,883 --> 02:36:00,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I could get a Fitbit and be like, hey, look how much I walked today.

1837
02:36:01,325 --> 02:36:01,705
[SPEAKER_05]: But like...

1838
02:36:02,506 --> 02:36:03,407
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1839
02:36:25,720 --> 02:36:33,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not bragging rights, but I was actually just commenting on something of our good old buddy BigRedPim's post a couple days ago.

1840
02:36:33,849 --> 02:36:37,032
[SPEAKER_03]: He's on a fitness kick right now, and he's already lighter than me.

1841
02:36:37,193 --> 02:36:41,758
[SPEAKER_03]: He started a couple months ago, he's already lighter than me, and I need to really do the same.

1842
02:36:42,598 --> 02:36:46,403
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's been the top of the Fitbit leaderboards for weeks now, and it's...

1843
02:36:47,143 --> 02:36:49,304
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are Fitbit leaderboards?

1844
02:36:49,444 --> 02:36:50,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, absolutely.

1845
02:36:51,964 --> 02:36:56,686
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in my employer's group as well as I have my selection of friends.

1846
02:36:56,846 --> 02:36:58,326
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is EPing to it?

1847
02:36:58,366 --> 02:37:00,266
[SPEAKER_03]: There is EPing to it.

1848
02:37:00,326 --> 02:37:05,768
[SPEAKER_03]: There are badges, there are goals, there is a good combination of everything to increase the...

1849
02:37:06,568 --> 02:37:07,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Lower the barrier to entry.

1850
02:37:08,070 --> 02:37:11,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Raise the motivation enough that you might actually get off your lazy ass and do it.

1851
02:37:11,714 --> 02:37:12,535
[SPEAKER_05]: How much is a Fitbit?

1852
02:37:13,295 --> 02:37:14,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranges from $70 to $120.

1853
02:37:14,657 --> 02:37:16,138
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple different models.

1854
02:37:16,158 --> 02:37:16,138
$70?

1855
02:37:16,238 --> 02:37:16,419
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1856
02:37:20,399 --> 02:37:21,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Laura, that's a lot of money.

1857
02:37:21,300 --> 02:37:22,041
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of money.

1858
02:37:22,401 --> 02:37:25,004
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot of money for bragging rights about I walked more than you.

1859
02:37:25,965 --> 02:37:29,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Then again, not getting thinner, just sitting here doing a radio show.

1860
02:37:29,829 --> 02:37:33,112
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say just use your DS, but that unfortunately doesn't, that negates Fitbit at all.

1861
02:37:33,152 --> 02:37:34,153
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking snacking too.

1862
02:37:34,233 --> 02:37:35,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Snacking is my worst enemy.

1863
02:37:35,795 --> 02:37:37,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I slap you when you go up to go get some more of them?

1864
02:37:37,797 --> 02:37:38,758
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because I'm hungry.

1865
02:37:39,399 --> 02:37:41,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too, but I'm not going to eat until freaking midnight.

1866
02:37:41,801 --> 02:37:42,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, Loki.

1867
02:37:42,482 --> 02:37:43,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want some pretzels?

1868
02:37:44,003 --> 02:37:45,164
[SPEAKER_06]: and Loki.

1869
02:37:45,844 --> 02:37:49,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so the inevitable has happened.

1870
02:37:50,546 --> 02:38:00,731
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to bundle a Vita with a PlayStation 4 and sell it in the UK for an undetermined amount of money at some point.

1871
02:38:02,552 --> 02:38:02,912
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1872
02:38:03,432 --> 02:38:04,873
[SPEAKER_06]: They're really pushing that second screen thing.

1873
02:38:05,113 --> 02:38:06,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Remote play and all that fun stuff.

1874
02:38:07,454 --> 02:38:10,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully you get a good price because I don't think they had a price on it.

1875
02:38:13,379 --> 02:38:14,000
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it, huh?

1876
02:38:14,020 --> 02:38:15,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think this will actually sell?

1877
02:38:15,982 --> 02:38:18,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's an expensive bundle.

1878
02:38:18,546 --> 02:38:25,395
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's at a good price, if you're saving quite a bit of money on it, then yeah, it should sell.

1879
02:38:26,636 --> 02:38:29,219
[SPEAKER_06]: If there is no price break on it, then fuck them.

1880
02:38:30,581 --> 02:38:36,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, this last story I have here doesn't totally have to do with gaming, but you know what?

1881
02:38:37,530 --> 02:38:43,978
[SPEAKER_05]: It definitely has to do with tech, and it's got a lot of people talking this week, and I wanted to bring it up here on the show.

1882
02:38:45,419 --> 02:38:48,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Y'all know the famous MP3 player, Winamp, right?

1883
02:38:49,244 --> 02:38:50,445
[SPEAKER_03]: It really whips the llama's ass.

1884
02:38:50,465 --> 02:38:56,287
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, with this little demo story about whooping the llama's ass or whatever Wesley Willis reject lyric that was.

1885
02:38:57,668 --> 02:39:00,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Winamp was bought by America Online in June 1999.

1886
02:39:00,649 --> 02:39:02,750
[SPEAKER_05]: America Online's still around.

1887
02:39:02,870 --> 02:39:04,270
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's when the troubles began.

1888
02:39:04,290 --> 02:39:08,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, guess who owns Joystick Blog and Wow Insider and all that?

1889
02:39:08,692 --> 02:39:14,838
[SPEAKER_03]: TUAW and the Weblogs Network is owned by AOL Time Warner.

1890
02:39:15,079 --> 02:39:18,002
[SPEAKER_05]: And Huffington Post is part of AOL now or the other way around, right?

1891
02:39:18,122 --> 02:39:19,763
[SPEAKER_05]: So they've got some stuff.

1892
02:39:19,783 --> 02:39:22,146
[SPEAKER_05]: They just, you know, dial up isn't really what they're known for anymore.

1893
02:39:22,186 --> 02:39:25,289
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, they did have Winamp and they bought it in June 1999.

1894
02:39:25,409 --> 02:39:28,292
[SPEAKER_05]: It is going to be shutting down.

1895
02:39:28,693 --> 02:39:31,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Winamp is shutting down in exactly one month.

1896
02:39:33,077 --> 02:39:33,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadness.

1897
02:39:33,538 --> 02:39:35,901
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, this also includes Shoutcast, apparently.

1898
02:39:36,101 --> 02:39:45,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, what was exciting is that there were some rumors going around, I don't know if there's any truth to this, that Microsoft was looking at buying them once AOL announced that they were going to shut them down.

1899
02:39:45,412 --> 02:39:49,517
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why Microsoft would necessarily want them, but as somebody who, you know...

1900
02:39:50,498 --> 02:39:51,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1901
02:40:12,588 --> 02:40:13,048
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1902
02:40:37,242 --> 02:40:37,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing changes.

1903
02:40:37,842 --> 02:40:42,984
[SPEAKER_05]: So VOG Network's not going anywhere, but does this motivate us to possibly explore other options in 2014?

1904
02:40:43,685 --> 02:40:45,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Eh, sure.

1905
02:40:45,545 --> 02:40:51,288
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll tell you, Bobby and I are both very much of the school of thought of, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

1906
02:40:53,168 --> 02:40:55,089
[SPEAKER_05]: And why are you wagging your finger at me, Jason?

1907
02:40:56,829 --> 02:40:58,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm very counter to that.

1908
02:40:58,090 --> 02:40:59,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I like new features and new things.

1909
02:40:59,630 --> 02:41:02,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason was like, you're using Winamp 2.0.

1910
02:41:03,912 --> 02:41:04,692
[SPEAKER_03]: You're using Winamp 2.0.

1911
02:41:04,752 --> 02:41:07,233
[SPEAKER_03]: We had multiple revelations today.

1912
02:41:07,313 --> 02:41:09,733
[SPEAKER_03]: He's using a 7-year-old MIRC.

1913
02:41:10,053 --> 02:41:14,475
[SPEAKER_03]: He's using no shit Winamp 2.0, not even 5 with the 2.0 style.

1914
02:41:14,775 --> 02:41:18,336
[SPEAKER_03]: He's using Internet Explorer 6 on this PC for fuck's sake.

1915
02:41:19,296 --> 02:41:21,377
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm using Firefox to browse.

1916
02:41:21,497 --> 02:41:23,237
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't actually use Internet Explorer.

1917
02:41:23,297 --> 02:41:28,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Internet Explorer 6 is still present and I saw it jump up and I was almost in tears.

1918
02:41:29,739 --> 02:41:33,740
[SPEAKER_03]: And XP, which has been dead for how many years?

1919
02:41:34,020 --> 02:41:34,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, hold on, hold on.

1920
02:41:34,880 --> 02:41:37,381
[SPEAKER_05]: This says that this Winamp is 5.572.

1921
02:41:37,741 --> 02:41:38,281
[SPEAKER_05]: You lied to me.

1922
02:41:38,621 --> 02:41:39,662
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just using the 2 style.

1923
02:41:41,722 --> 02:41:42,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it.

1924
02:41:42,243 --> 02:41:44,684
[SPEAKER_03]: There are certain situations that call for it.

1925
02:41:44,904 --> 02:41:50,526
[SPEAKER_05]: 5.5 is not the newest though because I get a pop-up window every time I launch it saying, shouldn't you update your Winamp?

1926
02:41:50,566 --> 02:41:53,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, no, fucking leave me alone because when I update things, they break.

1927
02:41:54,808 --> 02:41:55,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Always.

1928
02:41:55,268 --> 02:41:56,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I like doing new things.

1929
02:41:56,509 --> 02:41:57,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I like new features.

1930
02:41:58,650 --> 02:42:01,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a bleeding edge kind of guy, but I'm not far from it.

1931
02:42:03,115 --> 02:42:30,661
[SPEAKER_05]: so alright anyhow VOG will continue until it really does break and we are forced to switch to something else or somebody sells us real good on the advantages of using something else which is always a possibility too possible Jason's eyes lit up I'm gonna get an email tomorrow reasons why you should be on IceCast alright that's what's gonna happen yeah anyways

1932
02:42:31,441 --> 02:42:33,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that was it.

1933
02:42:33,182 --> 02:42:41,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me now switch our status on our un-updated Skype, which I'm still using 6.6, even though I think there's a 7.0 now.

1934
02:42:41,646 --> 02:42:42,946
[SPEAKER_05]: I refuse to update Skype.

1935
02:42:44,847 --> 02:42:45,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I was on a call.

1936
02:42:46,068 --> 02:42:47,008
[SPEAKER_05]: You can call us now.

1937
02:42:47,028 --> 02:42:49,289
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or use the name on Skype, Orange Laundry.

1938
02:42:49,749 --> 02:42:50,810
[SPEAKER_05]: I refuse to update Skype.

1939
02:42:50,850 --> 02:42:52,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to get any calls from an Xbox One?

1940
02:42:53,630 --> 02:42:54,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope so.

1941
02:42:54,450 --> 02:42:54,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1942
02:42:55,110 --> 02:42:57,031
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've got an Xbox One, fire it up and give us a call.

1943
02:42:57,311 --> 02:42:58,031
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're going to go to the phone.

1944
02:42:58,051 --> 02:43:00,131
[SPEAKER_05]: The phone lines are already lighting up, so let's go to it.

1945
02:43:00,531 --> 02:43:01,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1946
02:43:01,691 --> 02:43:02,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

1947
02:43:02,952 --> 02:43:03,992
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Raven Stolfen.

1948
02:43:04,092 --> 02:43:04,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me?

1949
02:43:04,952 --> 02:43:05,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes, we can.

1950
02:43:05,892 --> 02:43:07,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, and your video just popped up.

1951
02:43:07,292 --> 02:43:07,773
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?

1952
02:43:07,873 --> 02:43:08,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, good.

1953
02:43:08,533 --> 02:43:08,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I got it.

1954
02:43:09,673 --> 02:43:11,113
[SPEAKER_05]: You got your gold 3DS.

1955
02:43:11,153 --> 02:43:12,013
[SPEAKER_05]: You just held it up there.

1956
02:43:12,613 --> 02:43:13,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I also got the game with it.

1957
02:43:14,034 --> 02:43:14,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

1958
02:43:14,194 --> 02:43:14,854
[SPEAKER_08]: I must be stupid.

1959
02:43:15,574 --> 02:43:15,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute.

1960
02:43:15,994 --> 02:43:21,015
[SPEAKER_05]: You got the game and the console, even though the game's already on the console?

1961
02:43:21,761 --> 02:43:32,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, what happened was, I was listening to your last week's show, and then I went like, you know, I bought the game at midnight with the rest of the Xbone people, and then I said, you know what, I'm gonna go buy it.

1962
02:43:33,683 --> 02:43:34,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Raven's Dolphin Gets Naked

1963
02:44:03,983 --> 02:44:04,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

1964
02:44:04,903 --> 02:44:06,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Wish for what you don't need to know.

1965
02:44:09,505 --> 02:44:14,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Raven, I can't help but notice behind you, I love that little Pikachu Pokemon banner thing you've got.

1966
02:44:15,566 --> 02:44:18,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this is my little room that I broadcast on.

1967
02:44:18,547 --> 02:44:20,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you have a little room, but this is the setup.

1968
02:44:21,468 --> 02:44:24,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people call it a dining room, but we call it the broadcast room, yes.

1969
02:44:25,478 --> 02:44:29,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's just a little room that I have posters of Grand Theft Auto and all that stuff.

1970
02:44:29,642 --> 02:44:34,986
[SPEAKER_08]: So all the consoles are in here so I can just chill out, just shut the door and go like, go away!

1971
02:44:35,427 --> 02:44:35,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1972
02:44:36,608 --> 02:44:37,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Every man needs a man cave.

1973
02:44:38,789 --> 02:44:40,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this one's pretty small, but it's awesome.

1974
02:44:41,011 --> 02:44:42,312
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the size, it's how you use it.

1975
02:44:43,113 --> 02:44:47,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was calling because I'm sure you played Zelda.

1976
02:44:48,698 --> 02:44:50,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it make the case for 3D for you as well?

1977
02:44:52,330 --> 02:44:57,073
[SPEAKER_05]: I was already kind of like, I don't hate 3D.

1978
02:44:58,074 --> 02:45:05,718
[SPEAKER_05]: It was always kind of a neat effect to me, but I don't think games should really rely on it either because there's so many people that can't see it, too.

1979
02:45:06,519 --> 02:45:09,681
[SPEAKER_05]: But does it have impressive graphics?

1980
02:45:10,161 --> 02:45:14,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it really show what 3DS can do with the 3D?

1981
02:45:14,324 --> 02:45:14,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

1982
02:45:15,404 --> 02:45:17,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I was really impressed with just like...

1983
02:45:18,466 --> 02:45:33,379
[SPEAKER_05]: in the dungeons where you have the multiple levels how you can really see that top and bottom and just like when you jump off cliffs or my absolute favorite when you when you grab a chicken and then jump off a cliff and slowly fly down like yeah that stuff looks rad on a on the 3ds

1984
02:45:34,580 --> 02:45:37,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I really enjoyed a lot of this game.

1985
02:45:37,983 --> 02:45:46,050
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that it's top-down, and it really does look like you're looking down on the action, and it really looks very nice.

1986
02:45:46,290 --> 02:45:46,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1987
02:45:46,911 --> 02:45:47,591
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's great.

1988
02:45:47,672 --> 02:45:48,112
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

1989
02:45:48,292 --> 02:45:51,975
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it makes a good case for not getting a 2DS.

1990
02:45:53,743 --> 02:45:54,403
[SPEAKER_08]: It really does.

1991
02:45:55,044 --> 02:45:58,286
[SPEAKER_08]: If anyone's playing on a 2DS, I feel you're missing out on something.

1992
02:45:58,866 --> 02:46:01,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Just the depth of just seeing that go deeper.

1993
02:46:01,848 --> 02:46:06,491
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something that... How are you liking the bigger screens now that you have a big DS?

1994
02:46:06,711 --> 02:46:13,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, now it's like... I'm doing one of those things where it's like, how did I go so long with my regular 3DS?

1995
02:46:13,235 --> 02:46:14,776
[SPEAKER_05]: How did I manage that?

1996
02:46:14,796 --> 02:46:17,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Because now that I'm on the 3DS XL, I'm like, oh my god, this is so beautiful.

1997
02:46:17,498 --> 02:46:17,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

1998
02:46:19,179 --> 02:46:19,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so...

1999
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:22,682
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's like a lot of different upgrade things.

2000
02:46:22,822 --> 02:46:24,003
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the iPhones, right?

2001
02:46:24,404 --> 02:46:31,090
[SPEAKER_05]: When I'm on the 4 for so long and then when I finally get the 5, it's like, God damn, how did I use that shitty phone for so long?

2002
02:46:31,150 --> 02:46:32,692
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's the way tech works.

2003
02:46:33,479 --> 02:46:34,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Tech is like that.

2004
02:46:34,920 --> 02:46:35,700
[SPEAKER_08]: One last thing.

2005
02:46:36,120 --> 02:46:38,801
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still keeping my purple 3DS because I'm still attached to it.

2006
02:46:38,901 --> 02:46:41,702
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't transfer anything over because I have the circle pad.

2007
02:46:42,122 --> 02:46:44,943
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have to keep everything nice and clean on this one.

2008
02:46:45,023 --> 02:46:47,004
[SPEAKER_08]: So Mario Kart 7 can't come over.

2009
02:46:47,564 --> 02:46:48,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, dang.

2010
02:46:48,704 --> 02:46:50,885
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right because there's no circle pad for the XL, is there?

2011
02:46:51,685 --> 02:46:51,866
[SPEAKER_05]: There is.

2012
02:46:51,886 --> 02:46:54,466
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just I only have the circle pad for the 3DS.

2013
02:46:54,547 --> 02:46:54,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotcha.

2014
02:46:56,087 --> 02:47:03,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, I moved everything over and I bought a 32 gig card, 30 bucks at RadioShack, so I will never run into storage issues again.

2015
02:47:04,153 --> 02:47:04,593
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the goal.

2016
02:47:04,613 --> 02:47:05,374
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I need to do.

2017
02:47:05,454 --> 02:47:18,563
[SPEAKER_08]: I have an 8 and a 16 and I'm debating like, alright, this is my default one and it looks like I might have to just make everything from scratch or either beat Revelations on the 3DS and then move it all over later.

2018
02:47:18,783 --> 02:47:22,946
[SPEAKER_05]: I was rocking a 2 gig SD card on my original 3DS and I don't know how I did it.

2019
02:47:23,126 --> 02:47:24,107
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how the hell I did it.

2020
02:47:24,247 --> 02:47:25,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Fairly sure, I still am.

2021
02:47:26,008 --> 02:47:26,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

2022
02:47:27,129 --> 02:47:27,729
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not enough.

2023
02:47:28,390 --> 02:47:32,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well Raven, I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls, but thank you so much for the call and the video chat.

2024
02:47:32,432 --> 02:47:32,933
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate it.

2025
02:47:32,993 --> 02:47:33,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, not at all.

2026
02:47:33,793 --> 02:47:35,074
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad you can answer my call.

2027
02:47:35,134 --> 02:47:35,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

2028
02:47:35,454 --> 02:47:35,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace.

2029
02:47:36,115 --> 02:47:36,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Later.

2030
02:47:37,216 --> 02:47:38,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Always good to hear from Raven.

2031
02:47:38,136 --> 02:47:40,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I do love the fact that you wave into the monitor.

2032
02:47:40,178 --> 02:47:41,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I still wave.

2033
02:47:41,398 --> 02:47:47,322
[SPEAKER_05]: God, here I am talking about we don't need a stinking video show and then I'm like, I keep playing into the video stuff.

2034
02:47:47,923 --> 02:47:48,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Ugh.

2035
02:47:49,335 --> 02:47:50,396
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2036
02:48:13,310 --> 02:48:18,614
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm right by the fridge, I still have leftover vanilla vodka Fuck yes, what's the old saying?

2037
02:48:18,935 --> 02:48:34,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's to you, here's to me, best of friends will always be But if we should ever disagree, fuck you and here's to me You got that right Yes, cling, alright, sorry Ranma You didn't call in to sing drinking songs with me Even though it's probably a nice little sidebar But what is really on your mind tonight?

2038
02:48:36,664 --> 02:48:39,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, it's happy hour somewhere, right?

2039
02:48:40,107 --> 02:48:42,689
[SPEAKER_05]: It's happy hour at OLR, at vognetwork.com.

2040
02:48:43,030 --> 02:48:51,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Between, well, we have the family-friendly bar between 5 o'clock and 6 o'clock Pacific, and then we have adults only, you know, 18 and up.

2041
02:48:53,079 --> 02:48:54,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're so bad.

2042
02:48:54,920 --> 02:48:55,861
[SPEAKER_01]: You're so bad.

2043
02:48:56,081 --> 02:48:57,022
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not bad.

2044
02:48:57,102 --> 02:49:00,105
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just, we have a family-friendly bar from 5 to 6.

2045
02:49:00,145 --> 02:49:00,225
[SPEAKER_05]: True.

2046
02:49:01,286 --> 02:49:05,208
[SPEAKER_01]: The Legend of Zelda A Link Between Worlds The Legend of Zelda A Link Between Worlds

2047
02:49:23,516 --> 02:49:27,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, let's just say there was a reason why I was late to work on Friday.

2048
02:49:28,159 --> 02:49:29,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, really?

2049
02:49:30,441 --> 02:49:31,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yeah.

2050
02:49:31,942 --> 02:49:37,146
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on the line amongst the people that were picking up PlayStation 4s and Xbox Ones.

2051
02:49:39,347 --> 02:49:45,952
[SPEAKER_05]: So were you like Raven where there was like four people there, like little Nintendo camps in the line or was it just you or what?

2052
02:49:47,389 --> 02:49:48,810
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2053
02:50:17,402 --> 02:50:18,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh!

2054
02:50:18,983 --> 02:50:21,024
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a steampunk first person shooter.

2055
02:50:21,364 --> 02:50:23,445
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reason why I want to pick it up.

2056
02:50:24,105 --> 02:50:27,247
[SPEAKER_05]: As a convention goer, I can see where that's relevant to your interests.

2057
02:50:29,108 --> 02:50:30,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so tell me more about Zelda.

2058
02:50:30,628 --> 02:50:32,169
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about the game itself?

2059
02:50:34,250 --> 02:50:37,151
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so surreal, especially on the XL.

2060
02:50:37,532 --> 02:50:43,915
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a total throwback for me sitting there on the Super NES playing through the game from start to finish.

2061
02:50:44,315 --> 02:50:46,596
[SPEAKER_01]: The music is just phenomenal.

2062
02:50:47,739 --> 02:50:51,862
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have a couple of gripes with the game, but other than that, I'm enjoying it.

2063
02:51:13,427 --> 02:51:25,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for me, I like the top-down view, but I remember from the Super NES version, from the top-down view, you could see more of Link's face and body, so it was more like the angle.

2064
02:51:26,375 --> 02:51:32,279
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this version, all you can pretty much see is the top of the hero's head and his hair.

2065
02:51:33,374 --> 02:51:34,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Nintendo Zelda

2066
02:51:55,151 --> 02:52:08,445
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do know that I think it was with the first N64 game is when the lore of Zelda, the storyline split where you have adventures where it's just Link in the games and then there's a storyline where it's the hero.

2067
02:52:09,066 --> 02:52:13,491
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm putting the game in thinking it's Link in a brand new adventure.

2068
02:52:13,511 --> 02:52:14,792
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking it's going to pick up

2069
02:52:16,351 --> 02:52:17,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Link to the Past

2070
02:52:36,139 --> 02:52:36,940
[SPEAKER_01]: All the games are like that.

2071
02:52:36,960 --> 02:52:41,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even from the Super NES one, you can name whatever, but you were still Link.

2072
02:52:41,984 --> 02:52:44,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you do that on Twilight Princess and stuff?

2073
02:52:44,285 --> 02:52:47,207
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you couldn't, but it's just been so long.

2074
02:52:47,928 --> 02:52:49,409
[SPEAKER_05]: I always name them Link anyway.

2075
02:52:49,449 --> 02:52:50,830
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of just don't notice it.

2076
02:52:51,671 --> 02:52:51,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

2077
02:52:53,839 --> 02:53:20,855
[SPEAKER_05]: that was like that was like my issue I'm like I'd rather play as Link I mean I don't mean to split hairs but that's how I kind of feel but you're the hero but the hero looks just like Link well it's like in Final Fantasy you can technically rename all the characters as well in almost all the Final Fantasy games you can rename the characters well at least until the instituted voice acting but like you know I can't play Final Fantasy 6 and not have like Terra and Locke and all that

2078
02:53:22,096 --> 02:53:28,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I think everybody does that one playthrough where you start naming your characters butts, fart, penis.

2079
02:53:29,800 --> 02:53:40,205
[SPEAKER_01]: See, for me, I renamed them as characters from Ranma 1.5, and I'm following through the storyline, and I'm picturing the personalities in the game.

2080
02:53:40,545 --> 02:53:41,666
[SPEAKER_01]: It fits so well.

2081
02:53:42,046 --> 02:53:43,167
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just that...

2082
02:53:44,537 --> 02:53:45,739
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2083
02:53:58,277 --> 02:54:00,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that is a minor gripe, though, right?

2084
02:54:00,978 --> 02:54:04,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Because at the end of the day, it doesn't really impact the game, which is fantastic.

2085
02:54:05,218 --> 02:54:05,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

2086
02:54:06,099 --> 02:54:18,721
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I was saying earlier in a chat about it, when I called A Link Between Worlds Second Quest, I say it's Second Quest, whereas if you remember in the first game, if you played through Second Quest, everything was different.

2087
02:54:18,921 --> 02:54:19,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2088
02:54:19,181 --> 02:54:21,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you thought one thing was something else.

2089
02:54:21,602 --> 02:54:23,082
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I'm seeing this game.

2090
02:54:23,122 --> 02:54:23,362
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like...

2091
02:54:24,471 --> 02:54:28,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is there, but when you go into certain locations, things have changed.

2092
02:54:28,695 --> 02:54:34,641
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, wow, it's been 10, 15 years since I've been here, so there's more for me to explore.

2093
02:54:34,901 --> 02:54:37,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if I go into this store, oh, this is something else.

2094
02:54:39,085 --> 02:54:47,153
[SPEAKER_05]: That is true, but there's also the new mechanics to consider, especially the flattening yourself on the wall really kind of changes things and shows you more parts of the world that weren't even there.

2095
02:54:47,233 --> 02:54:47,994
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess that's the point.

2096
02:54:48,632 --> 02:54:48,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

2097
02:54:48,792 --> 02:54:49,172
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2098
02:54:49,493 --> 02:54:52,975
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, Ranma, I'm going to let you go to try and squeeze in another call, but thanks for the call.

2099
02:54:53,636 --> 02:54:54,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, anytime, bro.

2100
02:54:54,497 --> 02:54:55,137
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, take care, buddy.

2101
02:54:55,738 --> 02:54:56,779
[SPEAKER_05]: You too.

2102
02:54:56,799 --> 02:54:57,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

2103
02:54:57,159 --> 02:55:00,842
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give us a call.

2104
02:55:01,202 --> 02:55:05,746
[SPEAKER_05]: We have time for at least one more call here if you are interested in talking with us tonight.

2105
02:55:06,746 --> 02:55:07,907
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to get to Twitter topics.

2106
02:55:07,967 --> 02:55:13,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I also want to ask Loki if he has any last-minute stories or if you are too busy clicking cookies over there.

2107
02:55:13,914 --> 02:55:14,855
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I have last minute stories.

2108
02:55:14,955 --> 02:55:15,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2109
02:55:15,776 --> 02:55:32,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently there's been reports that you can have some issues, maybe even possibly a band if you upload stuff to the upload studio on Xbox One with obscenities in there.

2110
02:55:35,078 --> 02:55:40,099
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe it was a glitch or something, but there has been some reports regarding that.

2111
02:55:41,299 --> 02:55:41,560
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2112
02:55:42,320 --> 02:55:48,462
[SPEAKER_05]: We got another call coming in, so let's get to it, and then we'll take whatever last-minute stories otherwise that Loki has.

2113
02:55:48,842 --> 02:55:49,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to it.

2114
02:55:49,322 --> 02:55:50,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

2115
02:55:50,182 --> 02:55:50,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2116
02:55:53,663 --> 02:55:54,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Hola.

2117
02:55:54,143 --> 02:55:55,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Bienvenidos a Orange Sounds Radio.

2118
02:55:56,444 --> 02:55:56,704
[SPEAKER_05]: You there?

2119
02:55:56,744 --> 02:55:57,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Call her.

2120
02:55:59,780 --> 02:56:00,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, I don't know.

2121
02:56:00,721 --> 02:56:05,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Skype seems to think the caller isn't there, so I'm going to have to let that call go.

2122
02:56:05,523 --> 02:56:07,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about it, but go ahead and try again.

2123
02:56:07,824 --> 02:56:13,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, Echo123 is your friend to test before you call.

2124
02:56:13,547 --> 02:56:14,868
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't heard that in years.

2125
02:56:15,068 --> 02:56:16,308
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2126
02:56:16,488 --> 02:56:16,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Echo123.

2127
02:56:16,828 --> 02:56:17,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Echo123.

2128
02:56:18,769 --> 02:56:24,032
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to see an Xbox One call, so please, if you have your Xbox One, I want to see what the quality looks like.

2129
02:56:25,613 --> 02:56:27,974
[SPEAKER_05]: See you sitting on your couch there, giving a call.

2130
02:56:30,406 --> 02:56:32,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I can give the voice command and it'll work.

2131
02:56:32,988 --> 02:56:36,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox, Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2132
02:56:36,850 --> 02:56:39,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Now if somebody is playing, it's going to fuck them up.

2133
02:56:39,372 --> 02:56:40,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I had to.

2134
02:56:41,013 --> 02:56:42,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox, open Skype.

2135
02:56:44,675 --> 02:56:46,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Now everybody's going to go hit stop.

2136
02:56:46,156 --> 02:56:47,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we're getting another call here.

2137
02:56:47,857 --> 02:56:48,938
[SPEAKER_03]: If I did, I apologize.

2138
02:56:49,058 --> 02:56:50,019
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, yeah, I know, right?

2139
02:56:50,519 --> 02:56:51,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2140
02:56:51,360 --> 02:56:51,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2141
02:56:55,346 --> 02:56:56,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello!

2142
02:56:56,307 --> 02:56:59,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead and mute the... I think they got scared.

2143
02:57:00,909 --> 02:57:02,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Mute your radio before you call in.

2144
02:57:02,609 --> 02:57:03,650
[SPEAKER_05]: That's always a good idea.

2145
02:57:04,810 --> 02:57:06,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise we hear ourselves echoing.

2146
02:57:06,151 --> 02:57:06,831
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little awkward.

2147
02:57:06,891 --> 02:57:08,031
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the name I didn't recognize.

2148
02:57:08,111 --> 02:57:08,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Echo 1, 2, 3 again.

2149
02:57:08,432 --> 02:57:08,492
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

2150
02:57:14,754 --> 02:57:18,096
[SPEAKER_05]: or maybe that person just accidentally called us because of what you did.

2151
02:57:18,116 --> 02:57:22,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you're the one that said Skype or is on radio.

2152
02:57:22,599 --> 02:57:23,959
[SPEAKER_03]: I just said open Skype.

2153
02:57:24,219 --> 02:57:24,600
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

2154
02:57:24,620 --> 02:57:24,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

2155
02:57:25,020 --> 02:57:26,261
[SPEAKER_03]: You went the whole nine yards.

2156
02:57:26,461 --> 02:57:29,122
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be really funny because that person hung up right away.

2157
02:57:29,222 --> 02:57:30,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that really did dial.

2158
02:57:30,523 --> 02:57:30,943
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2159
02:57:31,764 --> 02:57:32,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we try it again?

2160
02:57:33,465 --> 02:57:35,366
[SPEAKER_05]: No, don't do it again.

2161
02:57:35,406 --> 02:57:36,446
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to get hate mail.

2162
02:57:36,486 --> 02:57:37,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, go ahead.

2163
02:57:37,627 --> 02:57:38,648
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have more last minute stories.

2164
02:57:40,228 --> 02:57:40,509
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't.

2165
02:57:41,469 --> 02:57:42,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, goddamn.

2166
02:57:42,470 --> 02:57:42,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

2167
02:57:43,328 --> 02:57:49,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let me... I'm trying to pull up our Twitter, but I got sidetracked.

2168
02:57:49,289 --> 02:57:50,790
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know we had some tweets here tonight.

2169
02:57:51,870 --> 02:57:52,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

2170
02:57:53,250 --> 02:57:57,731
[SPEAKER_05]: YYR tweets us, Guess what comes out for 3DS in North America and Europe in four days?

2171
02:57:58,431 --> 02:58:01,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Space Harrier and Super Hang-On in glorious 3D.

2172
02:58:01,912 --> 02:58:02,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Insta-buy.

2173
02:58:02,893 --> 02:58:03,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot about those.

2174
02:58:04,153 --> 02:58:05,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited about that as well.

2175
02:58:05,413 --> 02:58:08,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Too bad DarkSakura's not here tonight to give you a little squee, but...

2176
02:58:09,734 --> 02:58:10,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Squeak, squeak.

2177
02:58:10,995 --> 02:58:13,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you go.

2178
02:58:13,216 --> 02:58:13,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

2179
02:58:15,457 --> 02:58:20,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Gally89 tweeted us this little acapella Mega Man 2 Wily stage.

2180
02:58:20,940 --> 02:58:23,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't screen the YouTube first, so I'm not going to play it right now.

2181
02:58:24,542 --> 02:58:28,864
[SPEAKER_05]: But I love seeing that type of remixed homegrown stuff on YouTube.

2182
02:58:29,305 --> 02:58:29,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Always fun.

2183
02:58:30,505 --> 02:58:45,472
[SPEAKER_05]: uh CatastrophicMagi also excited about Atlas announcing Persona 5 giving us the links just in case we missed it um Dungeon Buster says first thing I thought of listening to Yakuza 5's Battle of Pride was OLR makes me sad it's not getting localized

2184
02:58:46,312 --> 02:58:47,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I got to give this as a shout out too.

2185
02:58:47,733 --> 02:58:49,973
[SPEAKER_05]: This came in through our Twitter and I got to say hi to this.

2186
02:58:50,313 --> 02:58:52,094
[SPEAKER_05]: This came from Video Game Bang.

2187
02:58:52,854 --> 02:58:56,215
[SPEAKER_05]: And they said, hi, you're a Sacramento Gaming podcast.

2188
02:58:56,616 --> 02:58:58,336
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a Sacramento Gaming podcast.

2189
02:58:58,696 --> 02:58:59,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's be friends.

2190
02:59:00,597 --> 02:59:03,778
[SPEAKER_05]: So shout out to our new frenzies at Video Game Bang.

2191
02:59:04,078 --> 02:59:06,619
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did reply and said, okay, BFFs forever.

2192
02:59:07,019 --> 02:59:07,719
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

2193
02:59:07,799 --> 02:59:08,640
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

2194
02:59:08,700 --> 02:59:09,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello to Video Game Bang.

2195
02:59:10,200 --> 02:59:17,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I'm going to be honest, it's just the Pervo in me, but every time I look at the name, I see Video Gangbang, and I'm like, I need to get glasses there.

2196
02:59:17,844 --> 02:59:19,045
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not.

2197
02:59:19,245 --> 02:59:20,525
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it's a fantastic show.

2198
02:59:20,585 --> 02:59:21,646
[SPEAKER_05]: I will check it out this week.

2199
02:59:22,066 --> 02:59:23,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Both are fantastic shows.

2200
02:59:24,047 --> 02:59:24,227
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

2201
02:59:24,247 --> 02:59:25,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I said both of those.

2202
02:59:25,308 --> 02:59:26,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Both are fantastic shows.

2203
02:59:27,489 --> 02:59:29,710
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure that is true as well.

2204
02:59:29,731 --> 02:59:32,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I will check out Video Game Bang later this week.

2205
02:59:33,013 --> 02:59:34,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't it be funny if they live next door?

2206
02:59:36,115 --> 02:59:36,995
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.

2207
02:59:37,215 --> 02:59:38,276
[SPEAKER_05]: They're in Sac somewhere.

2208
02:59:38,296 --> 02:59:40,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we knock on the wall and find out?

2209
02:59:40,918 --> 02:59:46,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not far from Sac State, so I'm sure there's a lot of stuff that brews out of the college there.

2210
02:59:48,542 --> 02:59:49,663
[SPEAKER_05]: The phones are ringing one more time.

2211
02:59:49,763 --> 02:59:52,745
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to try and take this call and then we'll wrap up.

2212
02:59:52,805 --> 02:59:53,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2213
02:59:53,706 --> 02:59:54,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2214
02:59:57,537 --> 02:59:59,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, you're on Orange Sounds Radio, who's this?

2215
02:59:59,959 --> 03:00:04,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, this is Amiga777, one year later.

2216
03:00:04,703 --> 03:00:07,906
[SPEAKER_04]: There you are, you made it, Amiga777, what's up buddy?

2217
03:00:09,728 --> 03:00:19,857
[SPEAKER_00]: That was me that I guess tried to call earlier and ended up with the sound from the radio coming in and it didn't.

2218
03:00:20,532 --> 03:00:23,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, 50 points from Gryffindor, but what's on your mind?

2219
03:00:23,796 --> 03:00:34,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, basically I figured out the reason why there wasn't a whole lot of midnight releases or campouts for Wii U last year.

2220
03:00:35,071 --> 03:00:35,872
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically...

2221
03:00:37,288 --> 03:00:55,669
[SPEAKER_00]: as it turns out because it was done on a Sunday I guess as it usually is a lot of the big box retail stores didn't want to do any midnight releases I guess they figured it wouldn't be you know like a commercially safe thing to do Jesus would not approve

2222
03:00:57,230 --> 03:00:58,530
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.

2223
03:01:00,591 --> 03:01:02,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming that's what it is.

2224
03:01:02,212 --> 03:01:05,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially in some parts of the company, you don't mess around with Sundays.

2225
03:01:05,453 --> 03:01:09,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially asking people to stay up all night till midnight when there's church the next day.

2226
03:01:10,535 --> 03:01:11,616
[SPEAKER_05]: That is asking too much.

2227
03:01:12,336 --> 03:01:13,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially in some places.

2228
03:01:15,417 --> 03:01:17,638
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a far-fetched theory, to be honest.

2229
03:01:17,999 --> 03:01:20,640
[SPEAKER_05]: But could it also be true that maybe the demand just wasn't there?

2230
03:01:21,720 --> 03:01:25,182
[SPEAKER_05]: I seem to think the Wii U sold pretty well initially.

2231
03:01:25,902 --> 03:01:26,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

2232
03:01:45,423 --> 03:01:54,926
[SPEAKER_05]: BlackWolf in our chatroom wants to point out, I got my Wii U at a midnight release, so there were stores that did a midnight release for the Wii U, so maybe it just depends on where you were at.

2233
03:01:55,447 --> 03:01:59,448
[SPEAKER_05]: But Amiga777, where are you at with these next-gen consoles?

2234
03:01:59,468 --> 03:02:00,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you picked any of them up?

2235
03:02:01,209 --> 03:02:04,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you Team Sony, Team Nintendo, Team Microsoft, or all teams?

2236
03:02:04,850 --> 03:02:05,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's your head at with this?

2237
03:02:07,531 --> 03:02:07,591
[SPEAKER_00]: Um...

2238
03:02:09,154 --> 03:02:10,954
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm personally not on any team yet.

2239
03:02:12,275 --> 03:02:18,376
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you could say federally enough, I'm probably just still Team Sega.

2240
03:02:18,756 --> 03:02:19,716
[SPEAKER_00]: Dreamcast, that is.

2241
03:02:21,216 --> 03:02:21,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

2242
03:02:21,836 --> 03:02:23,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a lot of people that can't let go.

2243
03:02:24,677 --> 03:02:27,438
[SPEAKER_05]: You do know they remake all those games for the newer consoles, right?

2244
03:02:27,478 --> 03:02:28,178
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I understand.

2245
03:02:28,518 --> 03:02:29,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes, definitely.

2246
03:02:29,658 --> 03:02:30,378
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that.

2247
03:02:30,658 --> 03:02:33,259
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I do have a 360 now.

2248
03:02:33,699 --> 03:02:35,159
[SPEAKER_00]: I play it once in a while, but...

2249
03:02:35,900 --> 03:02:37,181
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what it's going to take?

2250
03:02:37,561 --> 03:02:40,304
[SPEAKER_05]: First console to get Shenmue 3 announced for it?

2251
03:02:40,564 --> 03:02:41,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Instant win?

2252
03:02:41,685 --> 03:02:42,386
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.

2253
03:02:43,467 --> 03:02:43,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

2254
03:02:44,388 --> 03:02:47,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, AmigaBuddy, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for the call.

2255
03:02:48,492 --> 03:02:49,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, take care.

2256
03:02:50,534 --> 03:02:51,054
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

2257
03:02:52,336 --> 03:02:54,438
[SPEAKER_05]: First console to get Shenmue 3 as an exclusive.

2258
03:02:54,658 --> 03:02:54,978
[SPEAKER_05]: You win.

2259
03:02:56,219 --> 03:02:56,560
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2260
03:02:57,040 --> 03:02:58,101
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for Last Minute Stories.

2261
03:02:58,402 --> 03:02:59,923
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for Skype Line tonight.

[SPEAKER_05]: I will certainly take you up on that.

2285
03:04:29,790 --> 03:04:30,410
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, sounds good.

2286
03:04:31,110 --> 03:04:33,551
[SPEAKER_05]: As I always ask people, do you have a final thought tonight on the show?

2287
03:04:35,129 --> 03:04:41,613
[SPEAKER_03]: No, get this podcast up so I can re-listen to it for the two-hour drive back to San Francisco.

2288
03:04:41,813 --> 03:04:46,255
[SPEAKER_05]: I will work on it, but tonight I'm going to have the YouTube challenge too, so we'll see.

03:04:46,295 --> 03:04:47,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been here.

2290
03:04:47,836 --> 03:04:52,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I also have a backlog of 30 hours of music podcasts that I have to get through too.

2291
03:04:52,438 --> 03:04:55,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Support whatever independent podcast you can think of.

2292
03:04:55,100 --> 03:04:56,641
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure this isn't the only one you listen to.

2293
03:04:56,661 --> 03:04:57,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, absolutely.

2294
03:04:57,981 --> 03:05:00,963

03:05:00,983 --> 03:05:02,364
[SPEAKER_05]: You can always listen to Video Game Bang.

2296
03:05:03,204 --> 03:05:04,646
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

2297
03:05:04,666 --> 03:05:05,727
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a new one for you to try.

2298
03:05:06,207 --> 03:05:06,788

2302
03:05:17,960 --> 03:05:18,200

03:05:23,792 --> 03:05:24,292
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

2305
03:05:24,933 --> 03:05:25,594
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a real thing.

2306
03:05:25,774 --> 03:05:27,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I hope everybody's okay.

2307
03:05:27,495 --> 03:05:28,956
[SPEAKER_06]: No, everything's fine.

2308
03:05:29,097 --> 03:05:34,961
[SPEAKER_06]: I mentioned on Twitter, my company that I work for, their warehouse got hit by a fire.

2309
03:05:34,981 --> 03:05:36,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I saw that earlier in the week.

2310
03:05:36,883 --> 03:05:38,164
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so awful.

2311
03:05:38,184 --> 03:05:39,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the Ohio stuff?

[SPEAKER_06]: 3 damaged PS4s out of the whole thing got crushed by the roof well, damaged by the roof because the roof fell on the whole pallet of them and I'm trying again to send them to me I'll fix them between 3 systems I'm sure there's enough parts if not to get at least one of those working fix it Loki besides, the insurance is covering the cost of those anyways it's not like they're losing money they're just going to throw them away anyways
