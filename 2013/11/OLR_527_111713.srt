00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 527 for this November the 17th of 2013

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My name is Rob Roberts joining over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and gaming lolz

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And thank you for being here by the way after a week off

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But I'm joined this week in studio as I am every single stinking week except last week when we were off

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
By the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
How are you doing? Did you have a good week off last week?

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What did you end up doing?

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I was in a car the whole time but you know like it's about a 6 or 6 and a half hour drive back from L.A.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So I'm in the car the whole time and Alan's there too but there's only so much talking you can do and at some point

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And playing what game am I thinking of?

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah that kind of thing

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We did listen to Bobby's show I will say that we were somewhere in the middle of I don't freaking know

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Probably about an hour south of Santa Nella probably Harris Ranch

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You California people that know your I5 was around Harris Ranch when Bobby's show came on

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So that entertained us a little ways but then the whole way home I'm just going

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And this is where OLR will be starting

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And here's where Jamie will be doing the Classic Game of the Week

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And here's where she'd be throwing a fit about reading emails

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I don't throw a fit

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But just kind of going through that whole like you know after so many years of doing something

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's kind of like I should be doing this right now but I'm not

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We know when we're behind and we know when we're ahead

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That's right

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Well I hope you had a good week off it was restful and all that stuff

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I slept

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That is a great way to spend the time

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Sleep is good

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's what Sundays are for

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Also say hello to Tech Master Loki

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Hi

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Hi Loki how are you?

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Fine

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You sound like you might need to be doing a little more sleeping yourself

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What happened? Did you catch a cold?

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Uh yeah

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Did you bring disease to the show tonight?

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I've been staying up late at night

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh is that because of Josh or just you're just doing projects?

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes it's because of Josh

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And totally not because I was playing Cookie Clicker last night

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Wait a minute

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Cookie Clicker? Really Loki?

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I got bored I got bored last night

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I got bored last night because

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Nellie was messing around with Reddit

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And so I was talking with her

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And I was like I don't want to browse Reddit anymore

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I remember hearing about Cookie Clicker

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Or reading about Cookie Clicker

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And then I'm like let's see what this thing is

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So I tried it out

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And yeah

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You kind of missed the train Loki

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Because Cookie Clicker was all the rage on my other show

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Horde House about two months ago

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And I think we're all over it now but

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You're late to the party that's alright

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's alright I just need to finish it and it'll be done

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I didn't realize there was an end to Cookie Clicker

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Oh

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I played the iPhone knock off one

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's not the same

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It isn't the same they really need to put out an official one

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
For the record?

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's addicting none the less

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
No

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You're not going to get into Cookie Clicker?

75
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Hell no

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What about the other iPhone game I've been playing

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I can't believe I got sucked into this garbage all over again

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I really want to thank Kethervis if she's out there listening

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I don't think she listens to OLR but if she is

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Like I'm doing that whole warning shots at you right now

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
She got me addicted to Tiny Death Star

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Have you seen this?

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes and I'm not playing it either

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's Tiny Tower with the LucasArts franchise

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
With all the Vader and Palpatine and all the characters

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And cute little midi style Death Star music

87
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
While it's playing

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I still refuse

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You refuse?

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I refuse

91
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's probably for the best

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The only thing that makes me upset about Tiny Death Star

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We'll get into real games in a minute I promise

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The only thing that makes me upset about Tiny Death Star

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Is that you can't rename all the stores

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Because that was the best part of Tiny Tower

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Which is based off his renaming the stores

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Because Allen would always rename his stores to these hilarious things

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Of course I can't even remember any of them off the top of my head

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Allen what were some of your funny stores

101
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You remember any of them on Tiny Tower

102
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He's shaking his head I wish I could bring it up and see

103
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I know I had a restaurant called Poops R Us

104
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Just because I was thinking that it gave people diarrhea

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Well there was a

107
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The apartment complex I built in the Death Star

108
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The Death Star was

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Let me look I'm trying to

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm actually pulling it up as we are live here

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You can pull up our chat room if you're listening live

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Oh you named it Ewok Shits

113

You can't participate with this show live every Sunday night

Ah here it is the Felucia apartments

121
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Is one of the apartments I have

122
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So I was going to rename it to by Felucia

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But I couldn't rename it

124
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Very sad

125
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Sad trombone

126
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Womp womp

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Alright anyhow

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We're going to get into our gaming weeks and all that good stuff

129
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
We'll talk about all that

130
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And what we've been doing with the week

131
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But we got a lot of stuff to catch up on too

132
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
After being gone last week

133
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh Alan came and he brought in his Tiny Tower

134
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Let me read

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What? It's still loading

136
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Live radio everybody

137
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I think I deleted it like

138
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yeah I finally deleted mine off the phone too

139
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let me look at our chat room

140
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Live.vognetwork.com

141
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Tim Tripp in chat says

142
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I actually played Tiny Death Star for about 30 minutes

143
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Which is 25 more minutes

144
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Than I usually spend with an iPhone game

145
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Dungeon Buster says

146
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm playing Tiny Death Star

147
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Never played Tiny Towers before so this is new to me

148
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So I guess if it hasn't worn off yet

149
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Then that's good

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Sandy Ball Gym is called Sandy Balls

151
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The Glassworks is called Here Blow This

152
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The Breakfast Place is called Enough Fucking Pancakes

153
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The Greenhouse

154
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Florist is called Dankweed 420

155
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So yeah

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And I see your computer lab is called Sierra Online

157
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
In a nod

158
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
There you go

159
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Those weren't even his funniest ones but that's alright

160
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
There's some funny ones in there

161
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We have to settle a few things

162
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
From when we were gone last week

163
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
We weren't here last week

164
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I was in Anaheim

165
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Sort of at Blizzcon

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Meaning I didn't go to actual Blizzcon

167
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I just went to all the parties and then I went to Disneyland

168
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Which is right next door

169
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That was the way to do it

170
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I had a great time

171
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I met a lot of awesome people

172
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'll talk more about Blizzcon later in the show

173
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
When we get to some of that news

174
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
One of the cliffhangers we left last week

175
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Or excuse me, two weeks ago

176
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Was that we were talking about the end

177
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Of the last generation with PlayStation 3

178
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And so forth

179
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And the start of the new one

180
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And I mentioned that I was waffling on the PlayStation 4

181
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And I wasn't sure if I was going to get one

182
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And I had my pre-order through Amazon

183
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Was I going to keep it, was I going to cancel it

184
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Wii U, you might remember a year ago

185
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I never bothered pre-ordering a Wii U

186
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I said I'm not going to get it

187
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The day the Wii U comes out, what did I do?

188
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I got one at Target

189
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So what happened with the PlayStation 4?

190
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I did not buy the PlayStation 4

191
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I cancelled my pre-order

192
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
When I got back from Disneyland

193
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You were a wise, wise fellow

194
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Well, here's the thing

195
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
A part of me actually feels kind of bad

196
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Because at Disney

197
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I had a great time at Disney

198
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Alan and I had a great time on Friday

199
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And the park wasn't very crowded

200
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
But then Saturday, randomly

201
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
An old friend of mine

202
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
A few years ago

203
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Who actually works for Sony now

204
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Was hanging out with me at the park

205
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And we were talking, of course we have to talk

206
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't want to bug him with work

207
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But we have to talk a little bit about PlayStation 4

208
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And he was telling me all the good stuff

209
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And I was leaving Saturday feeling really jazzed

210
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
About PlayStation 4, like, okay

211
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I gotta get one when I get home, I gotta get one when I get home

212
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But then I'll tell you what

213
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Swamee was that drive home Sunday

214
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And I don't know what it was

215
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I don't know if it was kind of listening to Bobby's show

216
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You know, it's

217
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
A video game system is only as good as the games that are on it

218
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Or what have you

219
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But I really realized, guys

220
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
There's just nothing I really, really want to get

221
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
On PlayStation 4 right now

222
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Now, early next year

223
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Absolutely

224
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Diablo 3 on PlayStation 4 looks great

225
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Even though I already played it on PC

226
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I enjoy the controls on PlayStation 3's demo

227
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And I will give the game another try on PlayStation 4

228
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Absolutely

229
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Final Fantasy 14 will be in beta

230
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
In the PlayStation 4

231
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And then

232
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I do want to get the Need for Speed game at some point

233
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But next year, some other things to look forward to

234
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Infamous Second Son, obviously

235
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And Destiny

236
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I mean, that's all in the first half next year

237
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So I'm sure between now and then

238
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I will end up buying a PlayStation 4

239
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But I'm gonna be perfectly honest with you guys

240
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Despite all this, like, console wars

241
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And whether you're cheering me or booing me

242
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
For my decision

243
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Money played a big part of it, too

244
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Might have gone over budget a little bit

245
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
When we were in Anaheim, so

246
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Whoops, womp, womp

247
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Going to the chat room

248
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
At live.vognetwork.com

249
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
RawstealUT says

250
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So the Wii U is worth more at launch

251
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Than the PlayStation 4?

252
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm

253
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
This is not gonna be a popular answer

254
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yes

255
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And the reason why I say yes

256
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Is at least

257
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
On the Wii U

258
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And you can call me fanboy all you want

259
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I don't give a fuck

260
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But on the Wii U at least, there was the Mario Brothers

261
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Which I really wanted to play, the Super Mario Brothers Wii U

262
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And there was Zombie U

263
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And yeah, I wanted to play Nintendo Land, too

264
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I mean, that was three games

265
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
At launch that I said, I really want to play these games

266
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I couldn't do that with PlayStation 4

267
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I couldn't sit there and go

268
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
These are four games I have to play

269
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Right now

270
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I couldn't do that

271
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And honestly, we all know that Wii U lost a lot of steam

272
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Over its first year release

273
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And I'm not gonna try and defend that

274
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You know, there should have been more in the pipeline

275
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Or what have you

276
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I think that's where PlayStation 4 will outpace Wii U

277
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Is because I'm looking at the first half of next year

278
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Going, this looks very exciting

279
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
For PlayStation 4

280
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
With all those games I just named

281
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So in that regard

282
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Which I would argue

283
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Is more crucial

284
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
To the system

285
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
In the future than the launch

286
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The next six months look very good for PlayStation 4

287
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So

288
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Let's see, also going to the chat room

289
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I didn't get one either

290
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yeah, neither did Loki

291
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You guys had already kind of locked that in a couple weeks ago

292
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But I know I was waffling

293
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It just has to do with the bullshit of system launches

294
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The way they go these days

295
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
If there aren't the games that are gonna be out

296
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Let me rephrase that

297
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Because I can't apparently speak proper English today

298
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
If the games that I want to play

299
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Are not out when the system launches

300
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Then buying the system is buying a giant paperweight

301
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I would rather wait

302
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Till the issues get worked out

303
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I would rather wait until there's a library that's worth me

304
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Actually putting some money on

305
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And my $100 gift card will last me a while

306
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah

307
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I am still planning on

308
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And this again

309
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Probably won't be a popular statement

310
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But I don't care

311
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I am still planning on getting that Zelda 3DS I want

312
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And Mario 3D World next week

313
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You know when Fire Emblem's out?

314
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It didn't Fire Emblem already

315
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It did?

316
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah, it came out a while ago

317
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Unless there's a new one I'm not aware of

318
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But that's

319
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yes, I am still planning on keeping that

320
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But the good news is I can actually sell my old 3DS

321
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
To recoup some of the money

322
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That's what I plan on doing

323
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yep, yep

324
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Let's see

325
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

326
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
RawsteelUT says

327
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
There's never been a system that had a five star launch lineup

328
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm really trying to think that through

329
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Oh, the Xbox 360 I thought had a pretty great launch

330
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
360 wasn't bad

331
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
360 wasn't bad at all

332
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Dreamcast had good games when it came out

333
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Dreamcast was decent, yeah

334
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Sonic Adventure by itself

335
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Was a great game

336
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I remember

337
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Super Nintendo was really weak

338
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But it had Mario World

339
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Nobody cared there's Mario World

340
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
There's another one I'm trying to think through

341
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Genesis launch was really crappy as far as games go

342
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Because it was just the standard Sega fare

343
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
There was no Sonic

344
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Was it like an Alex Kidd game?

345
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah

346
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Altered Beast I'm pretty sure was the launch title

347
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
columns

348
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Alan's here

349
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I was trying to think pop quiz wise

350
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
There were five or six launch week Super Nintendo games

351
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It was SimCity, Pilotwings

352
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Super Mario World

353
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I want to say Final Fantasy 2

354
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But no that came out a couple months later

355
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It was Launch Window

356
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Within like six months of it

357
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
There were just like the four or five

358
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
There was also the Super Scope games

359
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
No, Super Scope games way later

360
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Actually, Alan, I think those ones you named

361
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I don't remember

362
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Was F-Zero at launch?

363
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But I think the ones you named

364
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I think first party were the only ones

365
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
There was Pilotwings

366
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The Nintendo

367
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The Green Hair Professor port

368
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Of SimCity

369
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And Mario World

370
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Those were the big three from Nintendo

371
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I thought that first week there were five

372
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm trying to think of what the other two were

373
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Someone Wikipedia it in chat

374
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Now I'm trying to

375
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm getting asked some questions about the Xbox One

376
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And where my head's at with that

377
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm going to be honest guys

378
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I kind of counted that out a while ago

379
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Because the $100 price tag gets a little more up there

380
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And the launch games to me

381
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Didn't counter balance that

382
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yes, I know it's getting Killer Instinct

383
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But I'm kind of eh on that

384
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I think the launch games sound a little bit better

385
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Four to five sounds pretty awesome

386
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And Dead Rising 3

387
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's just like the whole series

388
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Dead Rising, I bought it

389
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I have fun with it for about

390
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
A week and then I get bored with it

391
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Really fast

392
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The same thing happened

393
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I got Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising 2 off the record

394
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And I got bored with it so fast

395
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You'd think that would be impossible

396
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Being that it's a sandbox zombie game

397
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But Dead Rising 3 I think I'd just get bored with

398
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Really fast

399
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Just so you know Alan, looking at chat

400
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Bobby Blackwolf went and looked it up for you

401
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Super Nintendo launch titles were indeed

402
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Mario World F-Zero was a launch title

403
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Pilotwings, SimCity, Gradius 3

404
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Was the only other one that was there the day it launched

405
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Yeah, that was the one you were missing

406
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So yeah, here's the thing

407
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I actually kind of agree that I think

408
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The Xbox One lineup and those things you just said

409
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Forza, The Crimson Dragon, not so much Rise

410
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
In fact, very much not so much Rise

411
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah, Rise is kind of...

412
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But a lot of those other games you're talking about

413
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Actually, I think the Xbox lineup out the gate

414
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Sounds a little stronger than Playstation 4

415
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
But do I want to pay another $100 for the privilege

416
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Of playing those games?

417
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Is it that much a must-have title?

418
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Not for me, and not the stuff I play

419
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So

420
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I still think it's weird seeing

421
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I saw a TV commercial again today

422
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
They had some football on at Chili's

423
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And it was talking about

424
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
How to watch TV with the Xbox One

425
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And how that's a selling feature

426
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm like, I just don't get

427
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I guess if you're really hardcore into

428
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Fancy football, cool

429
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
But other than that, why the hell

430
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Would you purchase that system to watch

431
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
TV on it? It just doesn't seem like

432
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
That makes sense

433
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I will say this now

434
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Now that it's been a week

435
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Do I regret my decision to not get a

436
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Playstation 4?

437
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's

438
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It is really

439
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Taking a lot of willpower

440
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
To make me not go

441
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Isn't there something we could sell to get the money

442
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Don't we have hidden money somewhere

443
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That I could dig up and help pay for the

444
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Playstation 4? Do I have a rewards card

445
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Or an unspent gift certificate?

446
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Watching other people

447
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
On their Twitch streams

448
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I've been watching Exeter was streaming

449
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Some stuff, and that was fun, and Bobby was streaming

450
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Some stuff, and it was neat to watch

451
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It kind of made me go, oh

452
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That's right, I could have played like DC Universe

453
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Online with all the new textures would have been really cool

454
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And flowers really pretty

455
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And all that

456
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And the Twitch stuff looks great

457
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So there is that whole like, I want to be in the cool kids club

458
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Type of thing going on

459
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
But I'm doing alright

460
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm pretty sure I'm going to make it till

461
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
2014 without breaking down

462
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And buying a Playstation 4

463
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
We'll see

464
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Alright, so yeah, that's it

465
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
No Playstation 4 for me

466
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
For now, but I am still going to

467
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Of course be following it as are we all

468
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And doing the news and all that

469
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And I'll get one eventually

470
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Just so you know guys

471
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Just to kind of put it in perspective

472
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I did not buy an Xbox 360

473
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
At launch either, nor did I buy a

474
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Playstation 3 at launch

475
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I actually bought the Xbox 360 first

476
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I bought that about 4 months after it launched

477
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
They were still really hard to find

478
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
When I bought it, like I had to

479
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And when they got the new

480
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Shipments, and I remember I had to get

481
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The not fancy 360

482
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And had to buy the extra stuff

483
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Separately

484
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Excuse me, they were still hard to come by

485
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And my Xbox 360 died within a week

486
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Of me buying it, and that pissed me off

487
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
But whatever, it's old news now

488
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Playstation 3 I didn't buy

489
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
For like a year, I didn't buy Playstation 3

490
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Until LittleBigPlanet I think had been announced

491
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Or came out or something

492
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Was when I finally got the Playstation 3

493
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So, just because I don't buy a console at launch

494
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Doesn't mean I won't love the system eventually

495
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Like I said before, if Killzone

496
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Wasn't Killzone, if it was a new

497
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Resistance game, next gen

498
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I would buy that

499
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Because, well, I would want that game

500
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
But

501
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I just, I don't like Killzone

502
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I really don't like Killzone

503
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And looking at like, you know, what the next gen

504
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Games, I guess, you know, like Call of Duty

505
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And Battlefield and stuff, I mean, Call of Duty

506
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Just, first off, Call of Duty I'm not excited about

507
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
At all

508
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I had actually gotten a copy and I'm like

509
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Fuck this, I'm not opening this, I'm selling it

510
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And so I did

511
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But I still have another copy

512
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
But, you know, it's just

513
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I haven't even bothered to want to play that

514
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And, you know, it just didn't look that

515
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Great on

516
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It just doesn't show off

517
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
The power of that system at all

518
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It just kind of, you know, okay

519
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
This looks like a Playstation 3 game

520
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't know

521
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Alright, well, let's see

522
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
What else should I talk about here? I want to get into our gaming weeks

523
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
But I should mention BlizzCon real quick

524
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I did talk a little more in depth about this

525
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Over on Horde House, my other show, which is on Wednesdays

526
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
With Xtavor, Shana Linko

527
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And Grandpa Matt

528
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That is on Wednesdays

529
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And the latest episode, which is called

530
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Outworld is Mortal Combat

531
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The name of it, long story

532
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You'll figure it out when you listen

533
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I talked a little more about BlizzCon, but I just want to reiterate

534
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I did have a good time at the parties

535
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I met all the people

536
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
There was this fun little event called World of Podcasts

537
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
They did Thursday night where they tried to get all the podcasters

538
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Together to kind of like do these panels and things

539
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And that was neat for networking

540
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And just getting to meet different people

541
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
So yeah, I had a good time at the event

542
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And, you know, you definitely feel that buzz

543
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
In the air, all the excitement for the new products

544
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You know, obviously

545
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
A big Warcraft expansion was announced

546
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
We'll get into some of the details a little later on when we get to the news

547
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But there was a lot of buzz about that

548
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And the many other things that they announced

549
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
But, you know, remember guys

550
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
BlizzCon costs $175 to go to

551
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And I just, I got to be honest

552
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I think the way I did it was great

553
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Where we went to Disneyland

554
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And I got to go to the parties, so I got to do all the networking

555
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Yeah, I didn't get to play the new stuff

556
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But that's okay

557
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'll play it eventually, it'll come out

558
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
$175, hmm

559
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I don't know about that

560
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Alright, let's get into our gaming weeks

561
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What types of video games have we been playing this week

562
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
On the consoles we do own?

563
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

564
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm actually defending RossTLUT

565
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Give me a second

566
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Oh, chat stuff going on right now

567
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
At live.hugnetwork.com

568
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
If he wants attention, then don't give attention

569
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Let me, go ahead

570
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
No, my point is that he left the room

571
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
He's not there to defend himself

572
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I don't see any point in talking about him behind his back

573
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
The end

574
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Let's get into our gaming weeks

575
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

576
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Um, my gaming week

577
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Was nice

578
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I

579
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I actually

580
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Have twice finished the Stanley Parable

581
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Sorry, I didn't mean to kick you

582
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Then I'll kick you harder

583
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I finished the Stanley Parable

584
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Which you play it through once the way you're told to play it

585
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And then you do different things that keep you

586
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
From actually finishing the game

587
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So it's a very interesting kind of twist

588
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
On the walk through

589
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
First person adventure

590
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I really like it

591
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It was very well done

592
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I don't know that it was worth the full charge price

593
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Of it, but it was definitely worth the sale price

594
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It was a very good game

595
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And I haven't finished exploring it

596
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's pretty neat

597
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I hear the game has a funny sense of humor

598
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It does, it has a really funny sense of humor

599
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Compared to GLaDOS from Portal a lot

600
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Yeah, the narrator is just Mr. Snark

601
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
As long as you don't do

602
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What Mr. Narrator says

603
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
So you can rebel against the narrator

604
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's encouraged

605
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
That you do so from time to time

606
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I also

607
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Have been playing

608
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Mass Effect 2

609
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And Mass Effect 3

610
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Because I have

611
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm actually trying once again to get textures

612
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Imported on my Mass Effect 3

613
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
By doing mods myself from scratch

614
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Using textures and meshes that other people

615
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Have made and I've got

616
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Meshes working just fine

617
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Not textures and I do not want to use text mod

618
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Because that means it would be a pain in the ass

619
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So, moving on from that

620
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I also played Final Fantasy 14

621
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And I'm taking my sweet time with it

622
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
But I finally got Thaumaturge leveled up

623
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Once someone reminded me

624
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
That I could actually

625
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Pick some of my Arcana stability

626
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And use them with my Thaumaturge

627
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
The class became less shitty

628
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm sorry, physic is like

629
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Thaumaturges are like

630
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Squish, squish, squish, squish

631
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
No mana, squish, squish

632
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And then I was like

633
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Oh yeah, physic

634
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Being able to heal yourself is a great little perk

635
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
But now I'm back to

636
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Arcanist and I'm going to

637
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Work up to 34 and then do that stupid quest again

638
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
That one that I'm trying to finish

639
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
So I'm just wandering around doing fates

640
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Right now anyway, so

641
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Kind of boring, but...

642
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Are you excited about the content patch coming in December?

643
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Yeah, I did enjoy the lightning

644
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Thing

645
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I got the quest

646
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And I actually hung out

647
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Basically you just find

648
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Where all the people are camping and that's where lightning

649
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Is going to show up eventually

650
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
In one of the little random

651
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Fates that pop up in that area

652
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So I actually got the lightning

653
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Thing, her showing there and being all kind of

654
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Broody to herself and

655
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Is this my fate?

656
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm lightning angst

657
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I just liked how all the fonts turned to Final Fantasy

658
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
13 and the music

659
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I gotta be honest

660
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I sat there waiting for the fate to pop

661
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And I was like, this is so boring I didn't even

662
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
See it through

663
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I was like, fuck this I'll do it later

664
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I was a little bit late because I was trying to get a good

665
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
View to screen capper

666
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You know because

667
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
They turned it off, regular screen caps

668
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
But I use steam for it

669
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
So I was going to turn off all my stuff in screen capper

670
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
But I didn't get it done

671
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I did like though that you can get

672
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Some of the outfits and armor

673
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
And that's what I'm kind of working on right now

674
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Because I like pretty stuff

675
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I've been playing Animal Crossing

676
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I am going to be probably playing

677
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Animal Crossing because I have one

678
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Lone left

679
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
For my second character

680
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And then there's Julian's but I'm using his as bribery

681
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So that he actually behaves in

682
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
He's a good boy but he doesn't listen

683
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Another one of your animals moved to my village

684
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Really?

685
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Agnes I think it was?

686
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Oh the pig? Yeah

687
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I know Portia just moved too so I don't know who she moved to

688
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I don't think she came to mine, I got Agnes

689
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I got Mitzi finally

690
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
The white cat with the blue face

691
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
That was on the cover of the first game

692
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I have Mitzi now

693
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And I like her better than Ed

694
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And I want Ed to leave because he's fucking creepy

695
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It's like they're real people

696
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I was actually

697
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I started listening

698
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
To the Night Vale podcast

699
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Which is fun

700
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
But I was thinking about doing an Animal Crossing

701
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Parody with Night Vale type

702
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Stuff that's called Welcome to Normandy

703
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Or something

704
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
A particular person at VOG has

705
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Openly voiced the fact that they would love to have

706
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Some type of fiction based podcast

707
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Thing here, it would be a lot of fun

708
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Well you know I've

709
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I've been working on stories already so

710
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Make it happen

711
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Make it work

712
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I actually have a very extreme story I'm already working on

713
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
For a webcomic but it would tie in very nicely with the podcast

714
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Talk to me, talk to me person

715
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Alright

716
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Crap I played other shit

717
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
But I don't remember what the fuck it was

718
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It's kind of hard though I've noticed

719
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
To play MMOs

720
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
When you have a very needy cat

721
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Midna has now taken

722
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
To climbing up my side

723
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And patting me on the shoulder when she wants me to play with her

724
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Not just you know

725
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
The climbing up part

726
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
But she pats me on the shoulder and waits till I look at her

727
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And then she goes

728
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And then she hops up in my lap

729
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And tries to eat my mouse so whatever

730
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Not an actual mouse

731
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Like your computer mouse

732
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Cat and mouse

733
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
You know what's stupid about my mouse by the way

734
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Because Microsoft doesn't make that thumb track ball anymore

735
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
People on Amazon sell them for 200 bucks

736
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And I own two of them

737
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
They don't make thumb track balls anymore?

738
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Not the wired Microsoft thumb track ball

739
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Oh like different brands

740
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Logitech makes one like it

741
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
But people are actually spending the 200 bucks

742
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And it makes me think maybe I should sell one of mine

743
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
But then again I wouldn't be able to get another

744
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Loki how was your gaming week?

745
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I played a lot of Grand Theft Auto

746
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Of course you did

747
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
So I played more of online

748
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I think I'm like level 28 now

749
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
On PS3

750
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I didn't play any online on 360

751
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But I did 100% 360

752
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So I'm all done with that

753
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And actually I'm kind of

754
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I was trying to black out everything on 360

755
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
As far as the 100% checklist

756
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Because there's more stuff you can do

757
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Than actually get 100% for

758
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Doesn't make any sense but

759
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
That's the way they have it

760
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
So what did I do?

761
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I did all the

762
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Epsilon tracks the other day

763
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And

764
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I don't know just messing around

765
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I'll probably play more online

766
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Because they're gonna have a content patch

767
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Coming out

768
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
This week

769
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And

770
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Then

771
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Then I played Cookie Clicker

772
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I started that last night

773
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It's only been a few hours

774
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I can hear you over there clicking while you're talking by the way

775
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Of course

776
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
You got an intervention

777
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It'll be over soon don't worry

778
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
There is an end

779
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Alright

780
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
How many cookies do you have right now?

781
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Well I'm producing

782
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Looks like just under

783
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
30 million per second

784
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It's not enough

785
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Alright anything else?

786
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Um

787
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
No that's it

788
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Alright my gaming wheel

789
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Real quick actually

790
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
A little bit of Forza Horizon but I wasn't actually playing it

791
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
My son was playing it

792
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I saw the stuff on Facebook

793
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
With the pictures and everything

794
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Yeah he likes playing with my Microsoft

795
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Racing wheel

796
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
He likes pretending it's a steering wheel

797
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And goes and plays around that

798
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So I'm like hey what about the

799
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Then he wants to sit in my car and stuff

800
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And tell him how the car works

801
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And I'm like yeah you push the pedals to go

802
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And stuff and well I'll tell you what I can set up

803
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
A game for you and you can go drive a car in that

804
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And so

805
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
He had trouble at first because I had the

806
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Force feedback on and stuff

807
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
It's hella hard to drive that stupid steering wheel

808
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
With the force feedback on so I turned it all off

809
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And then I finally

810
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Switched him into a Honda Fit

811
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Because the car I picked for him

812
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Because it was a class C car

813
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Just was all over the road but for some reason

814
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
The Fit doesn't

815
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It's more stable I guess or something

816
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And so he

817
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
He was doing alright

818
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
He got it up to like 35

819
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And he was staying on the road

820
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
But there was like a turn

821
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
It was like an S turn and he was able to stay on the road

822
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
So it was pretty cool

823
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Let's see look at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

824
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Dark Tetsuya saw the video

825
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And said that was a great video Loki

826
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Ciao wants to know

827
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Sorry I always mispronounce your name

828
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Says what's the subscription fee

829
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
For the Final Fantasy MMO

830
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I believe it's $12.95 a month for the basic

831
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Which gives you 1 character a server

832
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Think $14.95 for the advanced

833
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Which is 8 characters a server

834
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I only had 1 plan

835
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And that was the $14.99 plan

836
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Go take a look

837
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Because I think there's a $12.95 plan

838
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I didn't see any of it but I don't care

839
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Because I wanted all the stuff and whatever

840
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It's what I was paying for a while anyway so it's fine

841
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It's not that big a difference

842
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Anything else Loki? Or do I get to go?

843
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Alright my gaming week

844
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Honestly not a whole lot of

845
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Different stuff because I was out of town for a few days

846
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
But you know the typical Final Fantasy 14

847
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I'm addicted to that

848
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And also played some World of Warcraft

849
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I think the whole BlizzCon thing might have energized

850
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Me a little bit to at least log in and check out my character

851
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And go yep still

852
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Still got no friends left playing this game that's too bad

853
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
But I did play

854
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Some actual new stuff

855
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I did play a little more of the Midway Arcade

856
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Because I was trophy hunting in that game

857
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And I talked about that a couple weeks ago on the show

858
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But another game I played

859
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
On Playstation 3, you ready for this?

860
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
While all you guys were busy with your

861
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Newfangled Playstation 4's

862
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Playing one of the big launch titles, Assassin's Creed 4

863
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I played Assassin's Creed 3

864
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
On Playstation 3

865
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Which by the way is my first

866
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Assassin's Creed game I've ever played

867
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
To which everybody is telling me

868
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You're doing it wrong!

869
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I want two, I actually have two for PC

870
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Do you?

871
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
But I hated playing it without a controller

872
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I like

873
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I've been playing Assassin's Creed 3

874
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I like it well enough

875
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I've only gotten through that first little chapter

876
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Where you're in the Opera House, then the boat and everything

877
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I liked the way that it was telling

878
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
A story and I thought the environments were really

879
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Kind of neat, like I really liked that

880
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Opera House was really pretty

881
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
To be scaling all around and jumping all around

882
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
So I was kind of having fun with that

883
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
But did you fight Ultros?

884
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
No, I did not fight Ultros

885
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
But I did

886
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I did have to walk in the

887
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Rafters and all that stuff

888
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
The way the sequence was done was really

889
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Neat, like you would hop over to this stage

890
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Piece that would fall because of your weight

891
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
But not all the way onto the stage

892
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Yeah, I was

893
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Having fun with it

894
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I want to play a little more of it

895
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I probably will, I didn't get to play a lot a lot this week

896
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
But I played enough to get through that first

897
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Chapter, it was exciting enough

898
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Considering it was a series

899
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I never really, I've had a lot of people

900
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Tell me like, Rob, you should play Assassin's Creed

901
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Why don't you talk about Assassin's Creed on your show?

902
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Why aren't you playing this game?

903
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I tried Assassin's Creed 1, nah

904
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
It was just kind of not for me

905
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I just wanted to play 2

906
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Simply because it was Renaissance Italy

907
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And you get to kill

908
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Dometicis and that's always fun

909
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Because when they weren't busy

910
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Being Pope or killing each other off

911
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
They're a very interesting family

912
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
But yeah, all those same people telling me to play Assassin's Creed

913
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm sure when they hear I started with a third game

914
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
They're gonna be like, what are you doing?

915
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Don't do that one

916
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
But too late, and I'm enjoying it well enough

917
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
So, hey, the good news is if 3

918
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Is like the worst one, then

919
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
That gives me incentive to go play 1 and 2 again

920
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I don't think 3 was the worst one

921
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
It sold way better than 4 did

922
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Well, wait a minute though

923
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
4's only been out, what, since Friday?

924
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I'm talking the first 4 days

925
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Oh wait, that's right, 4 was out on the other consoles

926
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Well, but could that be because

927
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Of the spread where some people are waiting for

928
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and all that?

929
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
It's funny because actually for work

930
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I was doing some comparisons

931
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Between launch

932
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Basically from that Tuesday to

933
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
The Saturday launch

934
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Week

935
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Versus their previous

936
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Iterations and stuff

937
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Just a little bit

938
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Of a spoiler here

939
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Call of Duty and Ghost did not sell

940
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Every 1 billion copies, they sold

941
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Into retail 1 billion copies

942
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
They sold through maybe about

943
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
177 million dollars

944
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Worth of that, not 1 billion dollars

945
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And then

946
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Assassin's Creed 4

947
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I don't remember what it was, but it was about

948
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It was less than half

949
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Of Assassin's Creed 3

950
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Assassin's Creed 3 sold really well

951
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
My idea with that is because they changed

952
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Up the locale and it was a little bit of a different

953
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Type of game, so it was a lot more interesting

954
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Warriors 4 is very similar

955
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
To Assassin's Creed 3 except now it's

956
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Pirates and there's more of the ship

957
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Stuff in there, but

958
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I don't know, no one cares about

959
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Call of Duty for some reason this year

960
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Looking at our chatroom at

961
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Live.vognetwork.com, Tim Tripp

962
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Says, I'm loving Assassin's Creed 4

963
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Sexy pirate adventure time

964
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Assassin's Creed 3, the part

965
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I played, didn't have pirates, but it had a little bit

966
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Of the boat

967
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I don't know if you've been

968
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Marking yourself for download for all those free

969
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Xbox games

970
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Right? No, I don't think I have

971
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
They had Assassin's Creed 2 on there

972
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Did they? Yeah

973
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Stupid me

974
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Other comments on Assassin's Creed

975
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
DKB says I couldn't get through the first one

976
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
But the rest were great

977
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Let's see

978
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Burr says the Assassin's Creed 2 trilogy is good

979
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Or you could go right into Assassin's Creed 4

980
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And

981
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Let's see

982
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Well they had it out on PS3

983
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And now it's out on 360 as well

984
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Gene in our chatroom at Live.vognetwork.com says

985
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Maybe the second one, it's cheap

986
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Easily sets up how to play

987
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
So here you go

988
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Some comments and suggestions from our chatroom at Live.vognetwork.com

989
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
That's pretty much it for my gaming week

990
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I have some other Playstation Network things to get into

991
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
But I didn't play them enough

992
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So I'll get into them a little later on next week

993
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
So let's

994
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Move into gaming news

995
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
But first we'll do some housekeeping

996
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
So I should say one other thing

997
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And this kind of goes to housekeeping too

998
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Cheat plug time, you ready? Ready for cheat plug?

999
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Yay

1000
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
So one other game I played this week

1001
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Was the retro-tastic Jumpman Jr.

1002
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
On Commodore 64

1003
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Which is one of my earliest gaming memories

1004
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
And I played it because I'm toying around with this new project

1005
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
For my YouTube channel

1006
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
So if you want to see me playing

1007
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
A good 20-25 minutes of Jumpman Jr.

1008
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Go check out my YouTube channel

1009
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
My username over there is RobRobertsPlays

1010
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
All one word

1011
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
You will get my YouTube page to come right up

1012
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Because I have some other newer stuff

1013
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Like I did some streaming and typing in the dead

1014
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
That old Slenderman video from a few months ago

1015
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
That's all there

1016
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
But you can check out my Let's Remember series with Jumpman Jr.

1017
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
First video is up

1018
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I started to do a second video tonight

1019
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
But I couldn't use it because

1020
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Get this, I was trying to do

1021
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I don't want to say the game because I'll probably end up doing it later

1022
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
But it was an Atari 2600 game, I'll say that much

1023
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And when I was recording

1024
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Because the old Atari 2600 games

1025
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
When there was too much on the screen

1026
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It would have the flicker

1027
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
So when it was recorded

1028
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
It recorded at just the right frames a second

1029
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
That when I was doing one part of the game

1030
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
My character just disappears in the video

1031
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
So you can't even see it

1032
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Because of the flicker

1033
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I'm starting to learn about all that fun stuff

1034
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
But the Jumpman Jr. one looks great

1035
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
So check that out over at YouTube

1036
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And I will be adding more videos to it

1037
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I had a really nice response to that first video

1038
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
There are classic games

1039
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Both mainstream stuff and neglected stuff

1040
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I'm kind of starting with a bunch of games

1041
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
That don't get talked enough about

1042
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
But I have a shit ton of Commodore 64 stuff

1043
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I want to play

1044
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And even older stuff, Atari 2600 and so on

1045
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Alright

1046
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Let's get into some other housekeeping

1047
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R

1048
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Is where you can follow the show

1049
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And we're also on Facebook

1050
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio

1051
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
We crossed 600 likes this week

1052
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Thank you guys very much

1053
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Nice little milestone on Facebook

1054
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
But we could use more

1055
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
So please give us your likes over on Facebook

1056
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
You can also listen to this program

1057
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Not just via iTunes

1058
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And the app store and all that

1059
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But we are also available on streaming sites

1060
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
So just tune in and Stitcher Radio

1061
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
And that's an opportunity for me to say

1062
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
That Stitcher Radio does have reviews now

1063
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And those really help with exposure

1064
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
They do have a direct impact on that

1065
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
So please, if you enjoy the show

1066
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
We really, really appreciate it

1067
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Alright, let's get into

1068
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Some gaming news now

1069
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
It's been a very busy week with the launch of a system

1070
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
And everything, right Loki?

1071
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Yeah, so

1072
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
As with any console launching

1073
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
There's sometimes hiccups with things

1074
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
One of which is people encountering

1075
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
The blinking blue light

1076
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Which is a

1077
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Error indicator

1078
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It can mean a bunch of different things

1079
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Including

1080
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
An issue with TV compatibility

1081
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
An issue with the power supply

1082
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
The hard drive, or something else

1083
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
So

1084
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Yeah, and they kind of

1085
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Go through some of the things to try

1086
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Of course, you know

1087
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Turn it off, turn it back on

1088
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Number one thing that you do with anything

1089
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
That's mechanical

1090
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Is reboot

1091
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Of course, there's

1092
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
One of the things I know that people

1093
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Are mentioning is sometimes there's an issue

1094
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Where the HDMI port that they have on there

1095
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
That part of the metal shielding

1096
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
On there is popped up

1097
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And you have to push it down because your

1098
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
HDMI cable might not go all the way

1099
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Into the port and make a bad connection

1100
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Then that

1101
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
You know, causes that wonderful light

1102
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
To pop up as well

1103
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Or, your hard drive might not be seated properly

1104
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And you need to go pop that out

1105
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And maybe put it back in

1106
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And see if that works

1107
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
So they have a lot of stuff

1108
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Obviously through Sony's support site

1109
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
You can check it out

1110
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
If you have a problem

1111
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Or just fucking complain and say

1112
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Hey, my shit's not working, I just bought this system

1113
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
What the fuck

1114
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And they'll send you a coffin to

1115
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Send your system back and fix it

1116
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
But don't do what everybody else does

1117
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Which is just write an angry post on the internet

1118
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Because that's not really going to fix anything

1119
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
No

1120
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
So what do you think? I don't know

1121
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Is it doom and gloom for Sony?

1122
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
No, because they were saying

1123
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
That it's a lot of these issues

1124
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
So far that they've charted

1125
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
As far as people calling it

1126
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
It's only been about

1127
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
You know, was it

1128
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
0.04%

1129
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Or something like that

1130
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Of the systems that are out there

1131
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
So that's about like

1132
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I think we're going to get the numbers later on

1133
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
But it's only a few thousand systems out of

1134
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
About a million systems launched

1135
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So

1136
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Yeah, obviously

1137
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Those people are very vocal

1138
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
So it's making it sound like a larger issue

1139
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
But until

1140
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
It becomes a larger issue

1141
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Like the Xbox 360 launch

1142
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
That's actually well within

1143
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Usual

1144
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Hardware tolerances

1145
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Here's the thing though

1146
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Just to play devil's advocate a little bit

1147
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Didn't the 360 and Microsoft and all that

1148
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Grossly understate the amount of 360

1149
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Consoles that were having problems

1150
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Because I think they said what

1151
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I don't know, the number was really low

1152
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And then at one point they said it was 30%

1153
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Like they went as high as it was

1154
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
But just the people I know

1155
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It's more like 75%

1156
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Of those things had problems

1157
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
For real

1158
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Considering how many consoles I went through

1159
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
On the Xbox 360 and how

1160
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
My Playstation systems

1161
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
1, 2, and 3

1162
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Not a problem at all

1163
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I actually took apart my Playstation 3

1164
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
A couple weeks ago

1165
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
When I thought

1166
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Oh it's pretty hot

1167
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I'm sure there's a ton of fucking cat hair

1168
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
In there

1169
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Surprisingly there's no cat hair in there

1170
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
How the fuck did that happen?

1171
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
My computer is full of cat hair

1172
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
But that system for some reason

1173
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Nothing

1174
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I don't know what they did to it

1175
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
It's a magic cat hair repellent

1176
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I've never had a problem with any of the

1177
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Microsoft would be the one I'd be very wary about

1178
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Because like I said I went through about 12 systems

1179
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
With them so

1180
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Yeah I'm a little bit more skeptical

1181
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
With Microsoft hardware

1182
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
But

1183
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
It's not to say that it's

1184
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Not possible that there is

1185
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
A widespread thing but

1186
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
So far it doesn't seem to be that

1187
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
With the Xbox 360 at launch

1188
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Everybody was being affected by it

1189
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
You knew someone that had

1190
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Something go wrong with their system

1191
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
It's very obvious

1192
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
But we'll see

1193
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Once they just went through

1194
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
And sold a ton of systems

1195
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
We'll see if we start hearing more about this

1196
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
If it's going to be a widespread thing

1197
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
But I don't think it is

1198
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
At the moment

1199
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Yet another reason I avoid launch

1200
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Well you know what though

1201
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I bought my 360 like 4 months after launch

1202
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And it still wasn't fixed

1203
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
So I worry that if there is a problem

1204
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
It's not going to get fixed overnight

1205
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Go into our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

1206
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
ShadowNextGen says Loki was

1207
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
One of the lucky ones not to have a Playstation 1

1208
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Or Playstation 2 without problems

1209
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Very nice I have a launch 20 gig PS3

1210
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And it works just fine

1211
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I'm just hoping that it doesn't crap out someday

1212
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Because that would suck I've never had a problem

1213
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
With any of my systems except the 360

1214
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
My Playstation 1

1215
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
And Japanese Playstation 2 and American

1216
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
One were fine Well my

1217
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
JPS2 is a launch one too

1218
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And it's been working just fine perfectly

1219
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And my PS3 was a launch PS3

1220
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
And it's zero problems

1221
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
You know how apt those were

1222
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
To having issues

1223
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
But we did

1224
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
One of our Xboxes red ringed

1225
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
But we haven't had the problem since

1226
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And they were still making them under those same specs

1227
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
So

1228
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I think they've learned their lesson a lot

1229
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Especially with the red ring thing

1230
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Was the whole overheating of those chips

1231
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
And technology has gotten so much better

1232
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
In the years now that they're not using

1233
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
30 nanometer chips anymore

1234
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
They're using 20, 30 nanometer chips

1235
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
That are way cooler, way more

1236
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Energy efficient

1237
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
So running into

1238
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Heating problems nowadays isn't

1239
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
As much of an issue anymore

1240
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Because technology has improved

1241
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
So much in the years

1242
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I think unless

1243
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Of course you're shoving your system

1244
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Into a closed look area

1245
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
The red light of doom was one of the ones

1246
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
That people were saying on the

1247
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
PlayStation 4, that's from overheating

1248
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
But

1249
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I just don't think right now we haven't heard enough

1250
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
To where

1251
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I think it's widespread yet

1252
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
We'll see, I mean if we hear that there's a ton of people being affected

1253
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
By it or if it's something that

1254
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
It's fine now

1255
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
But like you know

1256
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Two weeks down the road all of a sudden everyone's systems start dying

1257
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Then that's something different

1258
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Alright well

1259
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Moving on to more talk about

1260
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
PlayStation 4

1261
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
When they released that giant FAQ on Sony's side

1262
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
A few weeks ago

1263
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Some people were very upset to hear that there was not going to be

1264
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Any type of playback in the games

1265
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And that the PlayStation 4 for some weird reason

1266
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Won't even play CDs

1267
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I guess CDs are a dying thing

1268
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Which is ironic because this is Sony

1269
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Like didn't Sony start the CD player stuff?

1270
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Like it's kind of weird

1271
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
That their own device wouldn't even play CDs

1272
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
But whatever

1273
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Anyhow

1274
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So Sony is hearing the

1275
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Loud vocal internet people

1276
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
That are bitching a lot about the MP3s

1277
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Being missing in the CDs and so forth

1278
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
It was in the form of a response

1279
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
From the president of Sony Worldwide Studios

1280
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Shuhei Yoshida

1281
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Who said the biggest surprise for us

1282
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
All internally at Sony was that there are so many

1283
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
People who passionately reacted

1284
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
To our announcements that there's no MP3

1285
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Support or CD support on day one

1286
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
It's not like we actively decided

1287
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Let's not do this feature so people

1288
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Will have to subscribe to Music Unlimited

1289
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Except that's the way I saw it

1290
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
It's interesting that

1291
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
He fires that direct shot

1292
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
There's a lot of people saying that

1293
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Whether you want

1294
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I'm just saying believe him or not

1295
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
But he did come out and say we did not

1296
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Do it because of this

1297
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Let me finish the quote

1298
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
The focus has been more on the game features

1299
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Some of the features we wanted

1300
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
But couldn't get in on day one

1301
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I would like to explain why he did put it out

1302
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
If they said

1303
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
You guys could have had CD MP3 playback

1304
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
But then we wouldn't have had game streaming

1305
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Or something like that

1306
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
It just sounds

1307
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Odd

1308
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
That they would just omit this stuff

1309
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Yet

1310
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Hey that Music Unlimited service works just fine

1311
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
It's just a little odd

1312
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Is it working though?

1313
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Have any of the PlayStation 4 adopters

1314
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Signed up for Music Unlimited just because

1315
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
They had to hear their Lady Gaga

1316
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
While they're playing?

1317
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
There's a lot of detail in there

1318
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
With all the launch systems

1319
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
One of the things I did like

1320
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Just kind of reminded me based off that picture

1321
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Is

1322
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
One of the things I don't even know if they've really been talking about

1323
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Those controllers have a headphone out on them

1324
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
For game audio

1325
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Like actual game audio from

1326
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Your TV

1327
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Before

1328
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
About a month ago or so

1329
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I didn't have a wireless headset for my PlayStation 3

1330
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I just had headphones

1331
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
And that would work fantastic

1332
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Just being able to

1333
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Have that audio without having to bug anybody

1334
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
But I thought that was kind of a neat feature

1335
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
That I wish all consoles had

1336
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
It's neat to see that on there

1337
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
But yeah it would be cool

1338
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
If I could play MP3's back

1339
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Or put MP4's

1340
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
On a jump drive or something

1341
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
And watch them on my system like I can

1342
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
On my PlayStation 3

1343
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
It's kind of dumb that they don't have that

1344
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
But hey if it's something that

1345
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
They can get this out on time

1346
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
And so they just focus on game related features

1347
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Now and then they're going to add that all in

1348
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Quarter one next year or something

1349
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Ok I'm fine with that

1350
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Yeah he did go on to say

1351
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
As we speak the people in Japan

1352
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
The system guys are discussing

1353
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
When we can put these features in

1354
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Ok well then it sounds like that's what it is

1355
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
But you know

1356
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
It is a little

1357
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Perplexing that oh hey Music Unlimited

1358
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Works

1359
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
You know we couldn't

1360
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Possibly squeeze out

1361
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
The one programmer

1362
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
That's going to take to implement MP3

1363
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Playback on

1364
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I mean come on how fucking hard is it

1365
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Going to be to implement MP3 Playback

1366
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
On a goddamn PS4

1367
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I don't think it's going to be that hard to write

1368
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
An MP3 Playback

1369
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
App

1370
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
It just doesn't seem like it would be that difficult

1371
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I don't know

1372
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Alright by the way some folks in chat

1373
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
ActDef says

1374
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Philips did the CD but Sony jumped on the CD quickly too

1375
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Rama says it was a joint venture

1376
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Between Philips and Sony

1377
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I do remember that Philips was heavily involved

1378
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
And Philips had the CDI back in the day

1379
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
So they got into gaming at one point

1380
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
You remember that Sony worked on the

1381
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Super Nintendo's processor and I believe was supposed to make

1382
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
A CD unit

1383
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And then like no let's do our own thing

1384
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I think it was Nintendo didn't want to do it

1385
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Something to that effect

1386
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
But at any rate Sony took what they

1387
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Had from having worked with Nintendo

1388
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
And jumped on their own little

1389
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Bit of the wagon

1390
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Gaming history y'all

1391
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Alright well so you'll get

1392
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
To have your or as

1393
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
What is it sg100matt in chat says

1394
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
If I can't listen to Kesha while I'm gaming

1395
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Then that's a deal breaker

1396
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
You'll get your

1397
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
We are who we are

1398
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Or whatever songs it is she does

1399
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
You'll get those to play those songs

1400
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
In Need for Speed or whatever soon enough

1401
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Help because I like Kesha

1402
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I blame you for showing me that video

1403
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Oh now the video

1404
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
She did with James Van Der Beek

1405
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
That was great

1406
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
You know I checked out the directors other videos

1407
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
And they are equally as brilliant

1408
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
But I blame you

1409
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
To register participation for this weeks episode of

1410
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com

1411
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Use the pass phrase hate

1412
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Let's move on

1413
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Chakra you're next actually

1414
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Well how about some wank

1415
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Wank wank and more wank

1416
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
God damn you blizzard

1417
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
During the show it's gross

1418
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Blizzard is a bunch of fuckers

1419
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Why? Because they put out an expansion

1420
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I'm actually interested in

1421
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Warlords of Draenor

1422
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Blah blah blah level 90 blah blah blah

1423
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I mean actually level 100

1424
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
But they're doing an instant level 90 now

1425
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
With the expansion which I think is stupid

1426
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
But I'll talk about that in a minute

1427
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
So basically you get to go into the past

1428
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
And learn more stuff about the space goats

1429
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
And explore the land of the space goats

1430
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
And hang out with the space goats

1431
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
And hopefully play more space goats

1432
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Because that was my favorite race

1433
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I'm glad to hear the Draenei aren't getting

1434
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Fucked over in this expansion

1435
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Because in the last couple of expansions

1436
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
They've just been absent

1437
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Like straight up not a part of it

1438
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Fuck your pandas

1439
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Fuck all these other people

1440
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
We're gonna go here and be Russian

1441
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Or at least sound

1442
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Like

1443
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Eastern European accent

1444
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
And honestly I actually

1445
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
They're my favorite race

1446
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
In the entire anything

1447
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Having to do with Warcraft

1448
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
My first character

1449
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
When I actually decided to play

1450
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Longer than level 20

1451
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Was Erisa remember?

1452
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
My arcane mage

1453
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
And I had so much fun with it

1454
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I played through all of Cataclysm

1455
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Without any help practically

1456
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Except for just being in the guild

1457
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I didn't do dungeons, I didn't craft

1458
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I didn't discover crafting until like

1459
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I had already started raiding I think

1460
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
So it was kind of funny

1461
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
But yeah they're boosting level cap to 100

1462
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
And you can instantly upgrade

1463
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
One character to level 90

1464
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
So that you can start

1465
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Playing the new content

1466
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Which I would like to see

1467
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
If there are other restrictions

1468
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
On this just because keep in mind

1469
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
People

1470
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Part of the reason that you level

1471
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Is to not just

1472
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Gain the experience and the

1473
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Abilities of your character in game

1474
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
But so that you learn the mechanics

1475
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Of your character in game

1476
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
And by learning those mechanics

1477
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
It makes you an overall

1478
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Better rounded player

1479
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
You know how you fit in

1480
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Should you decide to do instances

1481
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Which some are fun, some are not

1482
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
You know but

1483
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
And people will give you unwanted tips

1484
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
On how to play your class

1485
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Even when you don't give a shit

1486
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Which assholes

1487
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
We were talking a little bit about this on Horde House

1488
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Just at that point

1489
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
There's supposed to be some type of like

1490
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Scenarios or something that help you

1491
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Like if you're a brand new level one

1492
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
That boosts to 90

1493
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
You get some type of scenario

1494
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
But that's still I don't think gonna be good enough

1495
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
It's an interesting

1496
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Band-aid

1497
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
You know like even

1498
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I always kind of like approach that

1499
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Because I don't play World of Warcraft

1500
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
And I don't know too much about it

1501
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
And this announcement just

1502
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Nothing, I feel nothing

1503
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Jumped out and saying hey that looks really cool

1504
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I just like kind of eh whatever

1505
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
They didn't really do anything to attract

1506
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
New players to be honest

1507
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Which kind of sounds like a mistake to me

1508
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
And this is the crappy thing because I really

1509
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Want to play it for the lore

1510
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
You know I really want to

1511
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
See what the new stuff is

1512
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
It's very interesting to me

1513
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
But I just completely dropped

1514
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
World of Warcraft for Final Fantasy

1515
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
And I'm really enjoying Final Fantasy

1516
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I enjoy not having to rep grind

1517
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I don't care about doing all the what is it the

1518
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Titan crap or

1519
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
What's the other stuff that you guys have been doing

1520
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
The primal fights basically

1521
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I can get those later

1522
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I haven't had this wild urge

1523
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
To like massively level I've been

1524
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Able to sit back and enjoy the game

1525
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
And that's kind of what I dug about playing through Cataclysm

1526
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
The first time but then when I got to all the

1527
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Panda shit I was like it really

1528
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Was literally steaming piles of panda shit

1529
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
That's all it was

1530
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Rep grinding, the rep grinding got worse

1531
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
With the freaking pandas

1532
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
And I hated the arena

1533
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And I hated the Pokemon battle

1534
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Because it was fine for like a week

1535
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
And I got sick of it

1536
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
But yeah along with this too there of course will be new

1537
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Zones, dungeons, new raids, scenarios

1538
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Battlegrounds

1539
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
There's supposed to be improvements like a

1540
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Reskinned character models

1541
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
And new animation

1542
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
But I hope that they never change the night elf

1543
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Dance because that shit's funny

1544
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
So you can watch the trailer online it's pretty

1545
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I

1546
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Part of me just does not want to give a shit

1547
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
The other part of me is like

1548
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Goats

1549
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
You know I'm not super into

1550
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
World war class lore I never have been

1551
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Which is funny you know with the podcast and everything

1552
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
But I was always more about the social aspect

1553
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
And the garrison sounds really neat

1554
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
The whole player cities

1555
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Or whatever sound really neat

1556
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Well it almost sounds like they're trying to give a nod back to

1557
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
The original Warcraft games

1558
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Because you pretty much had your

1559
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Own towns and your defensible areas

1560
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
You know when you did places

1561
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
That's a good point

1562
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
The other thing that's just really

1563
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I'm wondering

1564
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
The updates I think

1565
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
As far as characters and animation

1566
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Are necessary

1567
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
They are long overdue

1568
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
And I realize they've been trying to cater to people

1569
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
On older systems that might not be able to

1570
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Keep up with it but at the same

1571
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Time I think that keeping like

1572
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
A window of about maybe

1573
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Five years worth of

1574
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Computer

1575
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
What's the word I'm trying to think of

1576
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Being friendly to older systems

1577
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Is a safe bet rather than

1578
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
How long has the game been out now like what

1579
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Oh nine years almost

1580
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
And they were still catering to people

1581
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
From computers still on

1582
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I mean I was playing

1583
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Whatever you had

1584
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Installed on your

1585
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Macbook

1586
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I was playing that stuff on your

1587
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Macbook and it was still

1588
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Just fine

1589
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
So I mean

1590
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I don't know I really

1591
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Really really really

1592
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Want to see the new stuff

1593
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
It's just I don't know if it's so

1594
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Worth it to me I've been well you know I read

1595
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
All the books that came out during

1596
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Cataclysm I got all of those books

1597
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I love the freaking thrall book I didn't read the Jaina

1598
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Book though because I'm just pissed off about what they did to her

1599
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I mean I hate how her

1600
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Character has become she used to be like one of my favorites

1601
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Even though I made fun of her

1602
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
But because I do have a character named

1603
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Jaina

1604
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Who I made look like her

1605
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
But other than that

1606
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I can

1607
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Get the lore stuff from my friends or I can

1608
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Get it on YouTube I watched the whole ending

1609
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Of the Garrosh bullshit

1610
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
On YouTube

1611
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Yeah oh there's two versions right? I've watched both of them

1612
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
No I'm

1613
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Mildly surprised but not

1614
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Majorly I just like Jaina shut up

1615
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Your trauma's showing

1616
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Granted

1617
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
It's well earned trauma but still

1618
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I don't want to repeat myself too much

1619
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
From Wednesday's word house but some of my co-hosts

1620
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Really got into how they

1621
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Feel that this is being charged for a patch

1622
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
That a lot of this stuff should have been

1623
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Taken care of in a patch

1624
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
But I said that you know I'm

1625
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Really looking forward to five man's coming back

1626
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Thank god because I've been really pissed

1627
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Off that Pandaria neglected them

1628
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
And that's probably the reason I'm not playing right now

1629
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
It's because I really can't fucking stand LFR

1630
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
And but

1631
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Five man's you can tolerate it's much easier

1632
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
When it's five people versus twenty five

1633
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
It's something about that social dynamic

1634
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
But I am really jazzed to hear about these

1635
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Rating changes where now you can

1636
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
LFR with eleven people

1637
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
So if you can put a group together and

1638
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
You know when I say eleven that's an arbitrary

1639
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Number between ten and twenty five

1640
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
You can now do LFR difficulty with

1641
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
A pre-established group of like eleven twelve people

1642
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Everything flexes now

1643
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
And for the hardcore players they're getting a new

1644
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Difficulty called mythic rating

1645
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
That's all twenty man that's it no more tens and

1646
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Twenty fives twenty man

1647
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
That part's cool

1648
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I do actually miss the rating but you know

1649
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
The big crappy part of it was at the end

1650
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Was that I like to

1651
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Chat with all my friends you know

1652
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
In the guild

1653
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
And it just sort of got to be a ghost

1654
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Town sort of I mean I was fine doing all the

1655
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Stuff by myself it's a you can easily

1656
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Play through anything in

1657
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
World of Warcraft as a solo game

1658
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Right and it's the actually

1659
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
That's one advantage it has over Final Fantasy

1660
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Fourteen to me because you have to

1661
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Have other people to do the

1662
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
The duty

1663
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Things like what's

1664
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
The like the dungeons

1665
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
The dungeons yeah you have to do those yeah

1666
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I like the better that they're four people

1667
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
And not five but still it's

1668
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I liked having the option of

1669
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Me being able to do this shit by myself and

1670
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Then going back and doing

1671
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Dungeons alone

1672
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
So that I could see what they were like because you know

1673
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
That's how I was farming for

1674
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
And you can't do that

1675
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
In Final Fantasy Fourteen because it level sinks you

1676
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Exactly which is you know

1677
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
It's good and bad

1678
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
So yeah pluses and minuses

1679
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I don't know for right now there's

1680
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
As much as I

1681
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Really really want to see the new content

1682
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I can't justify it so

1683
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Well we don't even know the date anyway so you have a long time

1684
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
To make up your mind

1685
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
So if Final Fantasy Fourteen turns crusty and old then maybe I'll be back

1686
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Which it might and Blizzard's probably

1687
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Banking on that a little bit so we'll see

1688
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Alright moving on

1689
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Loki

1690
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
So let's talk a little bit

1691
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
About the

1692
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Let's go back and talk about gold

1693
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
As I mentioned before

1694
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
You know there's the Xbox Live

1695
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Games with Gold thing that you get

1696
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Some free games and originally

1697
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
It was oh hey we're gonna like

1698
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Stop it you know once

1699
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Xbox One comes out and everyone's like

1700
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Why the fuck aren't you just continuing

1701
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
That well now they're like well hey we're gonna

1702
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
We're gonna do it again and uh

1703
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
We're gonna keep it going through

1704
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
2014 and we're gonna include

1705
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Xbox One games on a monthly basis

1706
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Which makes me

1707
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Believe that that's

1708
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Probably gonna be digital games

1709
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Cause I don't see them

1710
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Giving away

1711
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Well I could see them giving away

1712
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Rise cause that game looks like crap but

1713
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
There's no way they're giving away retail games for the first year

1714
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Or for at least six months

1715
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Probably a lot of download stuff

1716
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
So yeah it'll be a while

1717
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
But um hey

1718
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Still though it's good to see that that's gonna be continuing

1719
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
On I would not be surprised

1720
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Though even if they did retail games

1721
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
That that doesn't change to be more like

1722
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
The Playstation Network program where

1723
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
You have to continue being a live member

1724
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
In order to I mean cause come on they

1725
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Put everything else behind the fucking paywall

1726
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
What makes you think that they're all of a sudden gonna just

1727
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Continue on with oh sure are we generous

1728
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
To give you free games that you can have forever

1729
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Nah nah this is Microsoft

1730
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Sony's doing it and people

1731
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Are happy with it they're gonna do it too

1732
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Um I guess

1733
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Yeah I'm excited to go

1734
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
In there and see what they're gonna give away on 360

1735
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
And maybe flag some of the

1736
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Games but at the same time my

1737
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Account's coming up for renewal

1738
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Soon I don't know if I'm gonna do it

1739
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Cause I'm just like there's really nothing

1740
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I'm playing online on 360 anymore

1741
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I've been playing Mass Effect 3 pretty heavily for a while

1742
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
But now most of the people I play with are on PC

1743
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
And we haven't really done

1744
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Forzen forever and

1745
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
There's really not a lot to play on 360 right now

1746
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Even on PS to be fair on Playstation 3

1747
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
There's not a lot I play online either it's all PC

1748
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Or really nothing

1749
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
It's all free now so I mean it's free

1750
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
True

1751
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Mine's renewing soon too but I do

1752
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Play quite a bit on 360

1753
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
So I'll probably keep mine but

1754
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
You know it

1755
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
The free games aren't really

1756
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
A benefit right now it's just kinda like

1757
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Oh cool old ass shit I don't

1758
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Want anyways but I'll take it

1759
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Because you're giving it to me for free

1760
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
You know it's like I already have Halo

1761
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Or I already have Crackdown but

1762
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Now I have a digital version of it

1763
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Fable 3 another one

1764
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Oh fantastic

1765
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Fable 3 was kinda crap anyway

1766
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Alright let's move on

1767
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Nintendo put out a bit of news

1768
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
This week they did another one of their

1769
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Nintendo Directs which is how they get the news out

1770
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
These days taking their case

1771
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Directly to their fans and

1772
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Cutting out all the skeptics in between

1773
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
This is the news that came out

1774
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
On their Direct on November 13th

1775
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
A release date for Mario Party Island Tour

1776
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
In Europe that will be January even though we're

1777
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Getting that next week right? Sorry Europe

1778
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
You gotta wait till the new year

1779
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
The 3DS will be getting YouTube

1780
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Which is kinda one of those things they announced it and I went

1781
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
It's not already there and I

1782
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Oh yeah it's really not already there so

1783
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Finally YouTube on the 3DS

1784
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Grasping the internet

1785
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Which by the way let me throw this out there

1786
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
See what the live chatters think I was gonna keep this a

1787
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Secret but what the hell

1788
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I'm thinking about putting OLR episodes up in full

1789
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
On YouTube and no this will not involve

1790
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Video but just like a static picture

1791
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
While you have because now you don't have to break

1792
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Things up into 15 minutes anymore so you just do 3 hours

1793
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
And my

1794
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Big problem right now I can't get in the Orange

1795
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Zaun's radio account so I need Jason's help

1796
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Getting me back in there I don't remember how to get in

1797
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
They switched YouTube so many times now

1798
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
With the integration I can't log into the account

1799
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
So hopefully Jason can figure it out or he might be

1800
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Screwed I'm gonna have to get a new name but I am thinking about

1801
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Putting up episodes in full on

1802
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
YouTube which when I hear things like

1803
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
This like oh YouTube on the 3DS

1804
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
I go oh that would be really cool

1805
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Because people can't like

1806
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Download MP3's on their

1807
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
DS or at least I don't think they can right

1808
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
That's not really a thing you can't like do podcasts

1809
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
On a 3DS otherwise yeah I think it does have a

1810
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Sound player but I'm not sure if it's

1811
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
MP3's or if it's like

1812
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
MPA or that

1813
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
iTunes format or whatever it is

1814
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Regardless you can't do podcasts we know that

1815
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Even though the PSP did that website on the

1816
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
PSP that did it you can't really do it easy

1817
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
So that is something we're toying with

1818
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
So that's really cool to hear that YouTube

1819
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Will be on the 3DS so that you know

1820
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
For whatever it is on YouTube you want to look at

1821
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
And YouTube on the 3DS

1822
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I believe that there is a YouTube

1823
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Player for the Playstation 4 as well

1824
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
So there you go

1825
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Hey it's all over the place there you go

1826
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Alright um other things

1827
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
3DS and Wii U

1828
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
There's going to be a system update for both

1829
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
And finally the eShops will be

1830
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Combined thank god it's about

1831
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Time right they're going to combine the

1832
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
eShops not the games

1833
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Sorry but the account balances

1834
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Will be one and the same so the good news

1835
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Is if you have like 23 cents sitting

1836
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
In your wallet on 3DS and like you know

1837
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
23 cents on your all that leftover

1838
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Change you'll be able to combine it

1839
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Yay buy something

1840
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
And not have that leftover change anymore

1841
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
DLC coming to

1842
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Pikmin 3

1843
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
DLC worked out pretty well for Mario Wii U

1844
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Last year with the Super Luigi Brothers

1845
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
So it will be interesting to see what comes to the

1846
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Pikmin 3 DLC

1847
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Bravely Default comes to the US on

1848
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
February 7th

1849
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy

1850
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Comes out in North America on February 28th

1851
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And there is a new

1852
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Hero mode in Zelda A Link Between

1853
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Worlds and

1854
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
There's also something

1855
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
About and I'm not finding here Miiverse

1856
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
On 3DS but I know we have a

1857
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Kind of a follow up on that in a little bit here

1858
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
So I'll wait for that but one other

1859
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Big thing I wanted to mention here is Super Mario 3D

1860
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
World the rumors

1861
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
From a couple weeks ago that Rosalina is going to be

1862
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
A playable character turned out to be true

1863
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
You will not only have your classic

1864
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Mario Brothers 2 characters meaning

1865
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Mario, Luigi, Toad and Princess Toadstool

1866
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
But Rosalina will be unlocked

1867
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
And she does like a little

1868
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Spin attack type thing

1869
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
So she will be available in Super Mario

1870
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
3D World I missed what the

1871
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Qualifications were to unlock her

1872
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I want to say that if you had like a

1873
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Save file from the old game you get it right away

1874
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
No no that's um

1875
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
If you have Super Luigi Brothers you get the

1876
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Classic Mario Brothers

1877
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Reskinned into Luigi Brothers you get

1878
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
That but

1879
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Yeah that's really cool Rosalina is another character there

1880
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
So hooray

1881
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Yeah I'm very excited about Mario

1882
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
3D World

1883
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I'm glad

1884
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Yay excitement

1885
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Alright DarkSakura what do you have for us

1886
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Well speaking of

1887
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
3DS stuff Miiverse

1888
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Has got a few restrictions on it that may

1889
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Not please people

1890
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
It's the Wii U social network

1891
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
That they're doing

1892
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
It's going to be out on 3DS in December

1893
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
But they are not going to allow

1894
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Private messages or

1895
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Friend requests they don't have those

1896
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Features basically I think

1897
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
That's kind of going along with what

1898
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Happened with

1899
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Not PictoChat

1900
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Swapnote

1901
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
To avoid

1902
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
You know getting out anything

1903
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
That may not be safe for little kitties

1904
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
And you know

1905
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
An easily offendable adult

1906
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
So it's

1907
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
They're still

1908
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Going to be able to use this for

1909
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Consolidating their eShop

1910
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Balances like you were saying

1911
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
And

1912
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
But they can leave

1913
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Comments about games

1914
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
There's a sort of a bulletin board thing about that

1915
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
But you're not going to be able to

1916
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Do the actual private

1917
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Message person to person

1918
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Cause there might be a penis

1919
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
If you allow that

1920
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
You know what

1921
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
If they're allowing you to put comments on a bulletin

1922
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Board it is very

1923
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Easy to do an ASCII cock

1924
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Yeah but Miiverse is moderated

1925
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
That stuff gets poor

1926
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
It'll be on there for 5 seconds Rob

1927
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
That's right somebody might see it in 5 seconds

1928
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Someone will see the penis

1929
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
They will touch it they will love it

1930
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
With their little stylus

1931
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Boop it

1932
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Boop it

1933
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Boop the penis

1934
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Boop

1935
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Oh I thought you meant to say boppet

1936
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Like I'm thinking about those old like

1937
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Boppet twist it throw it

1938
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Turn it

1939
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I saw one of those at the thrift store the other day and some kid was playing with it

1940
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
And was like this toy

1941
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Sucks

1942
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I was like that's what we thought

1943
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
When it came out

1944
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Didn't they make like boppet for the Nintendo Wii

1945
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Am I crazy or wasn't there like actually

1946
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
A boppet game

1947
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
No there wasn't a boppet game

1948
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
There was like Jenga

1949
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
They had a few Jenga games

1950
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
And I was like what the

1951
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
That's dumb

1952
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
People can barely play Jenga in real life

1953
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
No I guess there was

1954
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
There was a family game night

1955
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
That came out

1956
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
That boppet I guess

1957
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Why did I think there was a boppet game

1958
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Because that would be a retarded enough idea

1959
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Where they might do something like that

1960
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I mean they made Jenga

1961
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Wow really S2 under Matt says there's a boppet TV show

1962
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
I didn't know that

1963
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Why?

1964
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
I had no idea

1965
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
If it was like chicks topless

1966
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
And dudes pantsless playing

1967
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Bop it

1968
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
That might be the reason to watch the TV show right

1969
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Fair enough

1970
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Maybe

1971
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Cinemax needs to get in on the boppet TV show

1972
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Bop it

1973
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Twist it

1974
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Turn it

1975
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Touch it

1976
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I'm sorry you were talking about

1977
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
I don't like where this shows going

1978
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
You were talking about pantsless guys

1979
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Hilarious mental imagery

1980
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Equal opportunity

1981
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
If you gotta have topless chicks

1982
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
But I imagine that male dangly bits look a lot more hilarious

1983
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Than boobs bouncing

1984
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Alright

1985
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Moving on

1986
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I don't like where this shows going

1987
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
It's going to a dark place

1988
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Let's go to release dates

1989
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
What your pants

1990
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Loki save the show

1991
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
And please read the release dates

1992
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
See how sis think of the children

1993
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Shut up

1994
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000

I heard horrible things

They're still claiming they're coming out that week

2052
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000

01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
That's it

2068
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
And then it officially dies to nothing

2069
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I was gonna say last big week of the year

2070
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
It goes into a coma for the next

2071
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Two months

2072
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Last big week of the year because then

2073
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
After that you've got Black Friday

2074
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
And that's when all the stuff is supposed to be out by

2075
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Well actually there's like

2076
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
The first week in December you've got

2077
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Gran Turismo 6

2078
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
And then it literally

2079
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
There is nothing

2080
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Well the South Park game was supposed to be there

2081
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Yeah the South Park was supposed to be on the 10th

2082
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Now on the 10th there's

2083
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Sorcery Saga

2084
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Some game about Curry

2085
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
That's coming out on the Vita

2086
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
And then January there's literally

2087
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
The disc version of Wii Fit U

2088
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
The pedometer and you want to buy

2089
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
The disc version of the game

2090
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
And then the bundle with the

2091
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Balance board

2092
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
And Dragon Ball Z Battle for Z on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

2093
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
That's it

2094
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
That's literally everything between now and January

2095
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
And February

2096
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
It's like nothing

2097
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
This segment will go by quickly

2098
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
What's coming out?

2099
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Nothing

2100
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Let's see go into our chatroom at

2101
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Live.vognetwork.com

2102
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I'm all over that shit

2103
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Cause I'm a classy bitch

2104
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
You and me both Cody

2105
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
By the way speaking of classy bitch

2106
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
I want to thank Alan for bringing me the wine

2107
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
To drink during the show

2108
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Can I smell it? Yes you may

2109
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
You could have a little taste if you want

2110
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
I don't know if it's against your

2111
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
What you can and can't eat right now

2112
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
You know what I have to try that stuff that Victoria told me about

2113
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
The Fravolo?

2114
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Yeah

2115
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
I need some of that in my life

2116
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Actually we're looking at going out to the winery in a couple weeks

2117
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
To do that

2118
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Kidnap me. I don't know if Lady Victoria will be here

2119
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
But she hasn't been on the show in forever

2120
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
She was on like one show in the old studio

2121
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
None of the listeners here probably know her

2122
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
We need to kidnap her. We do

2123
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Victoria would be great on this show

2124
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Because she's a wow widow

2125
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
In one of her relationships many years ago

2126
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
The guy cared about World of Warcraft

2127
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
More than her

2128
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
And so she's got all these stories about how much she hates

2129
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
The storming the castle game

2130
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
I've wanted to get her on Horde House because of that

2131
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
But anyway, I digress

2132
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Let's talk about Japanese release dates

2133
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
On the Playstation 4 this week

2134
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
You guys don't get the Playstation 4 until February

2135
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
I'm so mean. Why did I say that?

2136
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Well actually

2137
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
I will bring this around because

2138
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
I kind of think that whole

2139
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Delay in Japan kind of plays

2140
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Into part of the reason why I'm not feeling

2141
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
The Playstation 4 here right now

2142
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Because I think a lot of stuff isn't coming out

2143
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Until Japan has the Playstation 4

2144
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
So I think that plays into it more

2145
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Than we might want to admit here in the US

2146
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I don't know, but anyway

2147
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
That just kind of was a little reminder there

2148
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
As I was looking at the release dates

2149
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Oh yeah, Japan didn't have all this craziness that we had here this week

2150
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
With Playstation 4

2151
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
However, on the Playstation 3

2152
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Still kicking this week in Japan

2153
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Hey, if you're mad at me about what I said about the Playstation 4

2154
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
You can get your revenge this week

2155
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
With Lightning Returns Final Fantasy 13

2156
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
I really want that game

2157
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
I can't play it until like February

2158
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
It takes me revenge because after the last one

2159
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
It might be just like

2160
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
I thought Final Fantasy 13 2 was good

2161
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
It was good

2162
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Whatever

2163
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Final Fantasy 13 Lightning Returns

2164
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
It'll be interesting, we'll say that much one way or the other

2165
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
That is out in Japan this week on the Playstation 3

2166
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Hanasaku Mani Mani also comes out

2167
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Monster Hunter Frontier G

2168
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
In like a beginners package

2169
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Is out this week as well

2170
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
In Japan

2171
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Need for Speed Rivals makes its way to Japan as well

2172
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
And Shin Atelier Rorona Hajimari no Morgatari

2173
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
The Alchemist of Arland

2174
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Comes out this week on Playstation 3

2175
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
As well

2176
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
There's also by the way like a special

2177
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Ultimate box for Lightning Returns

2178
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
I guess that's some type of collector's edition I didn't really read up on

2179
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Because I don't plan on importing it

2180
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan

2181
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Looking there real quick

2182
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Just Lightning Returns on the 360 as well

2183
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
And Need for Speed Rivals

2184
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Also comes out in Japan this week on the 360

2185
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Going over to the Playstation Vita

2186
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
The Shin Atelier Rorona game I mentioned earlier

2187
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Is also on the Playstation Vita

2188
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
And that's really it this week on the Vita

2189
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
And the Wii U this week

2190
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Gets Super Mario 3D World

2191
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Taiko no Tatujin on the Wii U

2192
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Damn the Wii U for not being region-free

2193
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Damn it because I would so import that game

2194
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I love Taiko no Tatujin

2195
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
It's so cute

2196
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
It still had the inflatable drum

2197
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Although it probably doesn't

2198
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
It probably uses the touchpad and the stylus

2199
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Oh no I guess they're selling a bundle set

2200
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
That has a Taiko with it

2201
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
And a bocce

2202
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
They don't have a picture of what it looks like

2203
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Oh there it is

2204
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
There's a tiny tiny little picture of it

2205
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I love the little Taiko on the thing

2206
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
They're so cute

2207
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
And they look like kitty faces

2208
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
I want to take one of the little

2209
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
I have a Taiko plushie

2210
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
And I wanted to put kitty ears on it

2211
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Just because it looks like cat faces

2212
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
So cute

2213
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
On the Nintendo 3DS

2214
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
This week in Japan

2215
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
We have a Nintendo 3DS XL

2216
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
In Chopper Pink

2217
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
And Luffy Red

2218
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
In conjunction with

2219
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
One Piece Unlimited World R

2220
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
From Bandai Namco

2221
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
And gets those special 3DS's with that

2222
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
There's also Tongari Bushi

2223
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
To Maho Nomachi

2224
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
And Atsufutari

2225
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
No My Princess

2226
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Biohazard Revelations

2227
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Or Resident Evil of course

2228
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Gets a price reduction this week

2229
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
And most importantly on the 3DS

2230
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
If you screw up on all those other games

2231
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Don't worry

2232
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Mama will fix it

2233
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
And Cooking Mama 5 out this week in Japan

2234
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I'm glad Mama's going back to her roots

2235
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
After all that gardening shit

2236
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
What the hell else did Mama fix?

2237
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
What were all those spinoff games?

2238
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I know there was Gardening Mama

2239
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I thought there was one other one

2240
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
There's Crafting Mama

2241
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Babysitting Mama

2242
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Remember with the creepy one

2243
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Yeah they put the Wii Remote inside

2244
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
It's ass

2245
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I remember that

2246
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
There was Crafting Mama

2247
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Gardening Mama

2248
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Babysitting Mama

2249
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
And then 3 or 4 Cooking Mamas

2250
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Alright

2251
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
There you go

2252
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
By AkumaJP in our chatroom

2253
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
I have no problem understanding that

2254
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Good job

2255
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Yay I pronounced at least one of those games correctly

2256
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
12 years

2257
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Will do a lot

2258
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Never had a class believe it or not

2259
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Let's go around for the

2260
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
UK releases Dark Sakura

2261
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
There were a few things

2262
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Actually a few things coming out

2263
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
It's a pretty long list

2264
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
So I'm just going to start from the 19th

2265
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
We have on the 19th NBA Live 14

2266
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Then on the 20th we have

2267
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Contrast and Soul Calibur 2 HD Online

2268
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
And then on the 21st

2269
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
There is Battlefield 4

2270
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
FIFA 14

2271
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Madden XL

2272
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I got the 3DS thing on the head

2273
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Madden NFL 25

2274
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
And Shiva Kosher Edition

2275
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Wait

2276
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I need to check this out

2277
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Then on the 22nd

2278
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Angry Birds Star Wars

2279
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Assassin's Creed 4

2280
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Basically all the new release stuff

2281
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
The system release stuff

2282
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
So there's Crimson Dragon, Dead Rising 3

2283
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Connect Sports Rivals

2284
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Preseason, Need for Speed Rivals

2285
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Blah blah blah

2286
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Tearaway

2287
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Legend of Zelda, Link Between Worlds, Watch Dogs

2288
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Young Justice Legacy

2289
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Power Star Golf and Zoo Tycoon

2290
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Alright, that's it

2291
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Yarp

2292
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Busy busy week, that segment is going to slow down

2293
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
In the coming weeks

2294
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Have fun with all the games

2295
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
There's a lot to choose from

2296
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
It's a great time to be a gamer

2297
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
No matter what system it is you're backing right now

2298
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Or if it's several, lots of great stuff to look forward to

2299
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
And PC gamers

2300
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Not leaving you guys out because

2301
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
There's that rumored Steam sale coming right after Thanksgiving

2302
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
There's a fall sale and then there's an

2303
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Actual

2304
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Xmas or holiday sale

2305
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Prepare your wallets

2306
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Winter is coming

2307
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Winter Sale is coming

2308
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Alright

2309
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Let's do a few more news stories

2310
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
And then the classic game of the week, Loki

2311
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
So Nintendo has actually

2312
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Purchased some stake in

2313
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
I guess this company

2314
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Dwango

2315
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Dwango owns Nico Nico

2316
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Which is a video

2317
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Delivery service

2318
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
And I guess

2319
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Maybe they're planning on

2320
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Using that to

2321
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I don't know, either deliver

2322
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Games or

2323
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
No idea

2324
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
But it's interesting

2325
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
To see that they

2326
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Purchase

2327
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
612,000 shares

2328
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
So

2329
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Interesting, web services

2330
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
It's a web service company that provides

2331
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Content through mobile phones

2332
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
I don't know if that means

2333
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Streaming videos or something

2334
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Interesting that they're getting involved

2335
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Hmmm

2336
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Tinfoil hat

2337
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Tinfoil hat time

2338
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Could this be a clue

2339
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Just buying stock in the company doesn't necessarily mean

2340
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
It's not buying the company

2341
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Could this be a clue

2342
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
About where Nintendo wants to go

2343
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
With their next handheld system

2344
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Not going to say that they're going to make it a phone

2345
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Because I don't think that's correct

2346
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
But maybe something about

2347
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
What if it

2348
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Could get data

2349
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
I think it's like an iPad

2350
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
It does 4G and it does streaming video

2351
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
That's the one thing we didn't really see

2352
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
On the 3DS that I thought we would

2353
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Like I know it's got Netflix and that stuff

2354
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Well they had that at first

2355
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Remember they were going to do 3D movies on there

2356
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Yeah, whatever happened to that

2357
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
They kind of fizzled out I guess

2358
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
I remember when they were showing the demos

2359
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
The very first E3 or whatever

2360
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I think they had the trailer for Tangled

2361
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Was the one thing we saw in 3D

2362
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
On the 3DS

2363
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
An animated movie that was in there

2364
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
And Tron was like something I was like, fuck yeah

2365
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
They need to put Tron and 3D out on the 3DS

2366
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
But that never happened, it fizzled

2367
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Maybe not enough demand

2368
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Could there be a hint there

2369
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
If this is some type of streaming service

2370
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Could there be some type of movie thing

2371
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Being built into the next DS

2372
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
I'm totally tinfoil-hatting

2373
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
But I don't, I mean

2374
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
The 3D movie thing sounded cool

2375
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
But now that they're getting away from 3D

2376
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I don't know

2377
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,000
It's true because maybe 3D isn't going to be such a big deal

2378
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
WhatupG even agrees with you there

2379
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I think Nintendo's next handheld will be 2D

2380
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,000
That comment from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

2381
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Alright

2382
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
We'll see if anything comes of my tinfoil-hatting

2383
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
This will be happening for sure though

2384
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Heroes of the Storm

2385
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Was another game that Blizzard announced at BlizzCon

2386
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
I'm excited about this

2387
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
I'm not super into MOBAs

2388
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
But even though I'm terrible at them

2389
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I've tried to play them and they are fun

2390
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
League of Legends and Dota 2

2391
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
This is Blizzard's answer to that whole craze

2392
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Because after all, one of the first MOBAs

2393
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Defense of the Ancients

2394
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
An add-on for Warcraft 3

2395
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
So it kind of, in a way, started with a Blizzard game

2396
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
But obviously spun out in all these different directions

2397
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Heroes of the Storm

2398
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
The beta sign-ups are available

2399
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
So if there's something you're interested in beta testing

2400
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
You don't have to be an active WoW player

2401
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Or anything like that

2402
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
You just have to have a battle.net account

2403
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
And you can update your beta preferences

2404
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
For Heroes of the Storm

2405
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
So that's something I know I did right away

2406
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
But if you guys are interested in this

2407
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Don't forget to update your battle.net accounts for the same thing

2408
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Now, they announced

2409
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Some of the heroes that are going to be in the game

2410
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
And I have to admit

2411
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Even though cinematic trailers kind of bother me

2412
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Because you literally see none of the game

2413
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
In these Blizzard cinematic trailers

2414
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
As far as fan wank goes

2415
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
It was pretty awesome

2416
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
To see all these characters just out and outright

2417
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
And each other here

2418
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Did you see this cinematic trailer they were doing for Heroes of the Storm

2419
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
That had some of these bad guys

2420
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
And good guys in it all kind of coming together

2421
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
It was pretty neat

2422
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
To see everybody in that one video

2423
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
But I noticed, the first thing I said

2424
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Is I said, where are the lost Vikings?

2425
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Exactly, they're still hanging out in that cave

2426
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I looked at this trailer

2427
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
And I said, where are the lost Vikings?

2428
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
It's like an old school Blizzard property

2429
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
A lot of people remember, right?

2430
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Well apparently I'm not the only one

2431
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Who came out this week

2432
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
During Blizzcon

2433
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
While Dustin Browder, who's a Blizzard game designer

2434
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Was being interviewed with GameSpot

2435
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
He said, quote, there's a good chance for lost Vikings

2436
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
That's one of the characters we've been really interested in doing

2437
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
It's a way we can do three characters

2438
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
And you're controlling them and swapping back and forth

2439
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
I think we've really got some ideas

2440
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
That we might be able to make work

2441
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
But we're going to have to test it first

2442
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
To really see

2443
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
That's interesting, they don't want to put in the Vikings separately

2444
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
They want to have like ice climbers

2445
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
That's some shit

2446
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
One character that you control one of

2447
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
And it's all three of them type of thing

2448
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
That could be very interesting

2449
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
So don't count the lost Vikings out

2450
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Another one not to count out

2451
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
What's that Super Nintendo game, Blackthorn?

2452
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Whatever's the one they did on Super Nintendo

2453
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
They released that for free on Battle.net

2454
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
You just go download it, totally for free

2455
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
And have a blast with that

2456
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
I have a feeling they could be putting him

2457
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
In Heroes of the Storm 2

2458
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Why not?

2459
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
More than just World of Warcraft

2460
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
For the record, I do absolutely

2461
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Love that the lost Vikings

2462
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Are in World of Warcraft

2463
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
You can just go hang out with them if you're Alliance

2464
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
And you can kill the shit out of them if you're Horde

2465
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
That part's pretty cool

2466
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Very cool

2467
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Alright, let's

2468
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Travel to a time that was simpler

2469
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
We're going to go back to a time when lost Vikings

2470
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Might have actually been out

2471
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
It's the classic game of the week

2472
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
No, Dark Sakura didn't pick lost Vikings

2473
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
But she did pick something else that's very cool

2474
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I picked something that my autocorrect

2475
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Tried to change to Zantac

2476
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
I picked Zanac

2477
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Zanac is the classic game of the week

2478
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Zanac, and if you ever

2479
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Have played this game or have seen it played

2480
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
You can definitely tell it's a freaking compile game

2481
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
I mean, seriously

2482
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
It's fucking compile

2483
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Um, it is

2484
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Um, like I said, designed by

2485
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Compile and released in Japan by

2486
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Pony Canyon and by FCI

2487
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
In the US

2488
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
It was first an MSX game as was

2489
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Gardic

2490
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Um, which we got

2491
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
We got Gardic Gaiden as the guardian legend

2492
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Um, and

2493
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
It came out on the Famicom Disk System

2494
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
And the NES

2495
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
And later on came out for the Virtual Console

2496
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
And it also came out

2497
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
On MSX2 as

2498
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Zanac EX and PlayStation as Zanac

2499
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
X Zanac

2500
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
So basically you play one ship called the

2501
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
X502 Zanac through twelve levels

2502
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
And you have to destroy the system

2503
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Ooh, taking down the system

2504
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
So you have

2505
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Um, it was

2506
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Actually developed by

2507
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Some of the main developers at Compile

2508
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Um, these are the

2509
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Same ones who went in to do the guardian legend

2510
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Blazing lasers and Puyo Puyo

2511
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Um, it was basically

2512
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
And

2513
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
This is where I say you can tell it's a freaking compile shooter

2514
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Because watching it looks like

2515
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Playing through those shooting levels of guardian legend

2516
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
I mean down to graphical style and everything

2517
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
The music

2518
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Is definitely compile stuff

2519
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
And just watching it through

2520
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
It's a very fast

2521
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
And kind of difficult game

2522
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
It's really not super easy

2523
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
And uh, you know you've got your

2524
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Weapons boost, you have uh

2525
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
You either, you know

2526
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Game over when you lose your lives or you beat

2527
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
The game, you do get

2528
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Extra lives as you go

2529
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Excuse me

2530
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
You do also

2531
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Have like

2532
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Your special weapons

2533
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
That are based off of whatever number

2534
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Is labeled

2535
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
And you lose all of your powerups

2536
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Of course if you get hit

2537
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Your enemies are

2538
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
You have meteors

2539
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
You have different aircraft

2540
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
You have these discs

2541
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
That are

2542
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
You can't shoot them, they're impervious

2543
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
You have ground turrets

2544
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Different planes, you have your different bosses

2545
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Can I just say real quick, those discs come right out

2546
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Or are in guardian legend, I swear

2547
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Like, I have to admit

2548
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Dark Sakura, I know of Xanac

2549
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
And I know some of the stuff with the lunar

2550
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Lander and all that, which we'll probably get into in a minute

2551
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
But I've never actually played it

2552
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
And I'm watching this

2553
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Little video here and I'm like, wow

2554
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
This really does look like a shooter stage out of the guardian legend

2555
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I mean the sprites are a little different

2556
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
But just the way, like the sound

2557
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Is very similar

2558
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
And that's the thing about compile

2559
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
You notice they did have the little

2560
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Ground things that you shoot there

2561
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Those exact things were in

2562
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Guardian legend that had your powerup

2563
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Your little

2564
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
And even the way those bullets look, those are bullets

2565
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Straight out of guardian legend too, so this is interesting

2566
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt that

2567
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
It's good that you did because compile

2568
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
I mean basically until

2569
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
For all of their NES shooters, compile really did

2570
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Or, I shouldn't just say NES

2571
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
They're 8-bit shooters

2572
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Really did stick

2573
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
With a certain style, even blazing lasers

2574
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
To an extent, has that

2575
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Overwhelming compile look

2576
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
To it, and I hate to say

2577
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
If you play one compile shooter, you've played most of them

2578
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
You know, except

2579
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Guardian legend actually happened to have

2580
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
A really cool adventure sequences

2581
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
And so much to do

2582
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Now, there was that

2583
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Compilation, like I mentioned for Playstation

2584
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
That was Xanac, ex-Xanac

2585
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
And

2586
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
As far as

2587
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
That's concerned

2588
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
It also had an updated version of Xanac

2589
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Called Xanac Neo

2590
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
And the different NES versions

2591
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
So I'd definitely say if someone can find that

2592
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
They should go ahead and do it because

2593
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
All in all, even if you get over

2594
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
It's striking similarities to the

2595
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Other games

2596
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Then

2597
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
It's still, you know

2598
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
It's still

2599
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
It's still a very

2600
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Good shooter to play

2601
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
And I'd definitely say

2602
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
It's worth adding to any library

2603
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
So, that's it, Xanac

2604
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
There it is

2605
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
If anyone's wondering if I've done this before, I think you might be getting

2606
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Confused with Zexes

2607
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Yes, you did do Zexes, I remember that

2608
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
But you've never done Xanac

2609
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Wow, somebody has already updated

2610
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I was on the wiki, because somebody in chat was suggesting

2611
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
That you do Shenmue

2612
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
And I was like, yeah I know, Act F was like

2613
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
And I'm like, really, when?

2614
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
And sure enough, you did do that in episode

2615
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
326, somebody that was long, 356

2616
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
You did a long time ago

2617
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Yes, this list is getting very long

2618
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
But as I'm on the list, already updated

2619
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
To say Xanac there, episode 527

2620
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Well done, wiki editors

2621
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
And honestly, and I have to say

2622
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
For the people who update the wiki, I seriously do rely on you

2623
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Because, I mean

2624
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
If you guys are having trouble remembering what I've picked

2625
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Imagine the trouble I'm having

2626
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
When, no no no, I have to describe

2627
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
This, I've got

2628
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
A wall of shelves behind me

2629
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
At my house that's loaded with video games

2630
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
And I have to look at this shit

2631
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Going, what have I not done?

2632
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
So I've just started picking games

2633
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
By freaking year, and I picked 1986 this time

2634
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
So it worked

2635
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Fun OLR trivia

2636
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
The very first Classic Game of the Week

2637
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Episode 250

2638
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Was the very first Classic Game of the Week

2639
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
And we all know what it was

2640
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Do we? Do you remember? What was it?

2641
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
It was Vibribin, no it wasn't

2642
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
It was Fantasy Zone

2643
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
It was Fantasy Zone, was the very first Classic Game of the Week

2644
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Because Fantasy Zone is my favorite

2645
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
No, my second favorite video game ever

2646
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
My first favorite being

2647
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Guardian Legend, and my third favorite being

2648
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Space Harrier

2649
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
You did end up doing Guardian Legend later, and I remember you came in here and you were like

2650
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Ah, fuck it, we're doing Guardian Legend tonight

2651
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
I was saving it, but

2652
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
You were very much like, you know what?

2653
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
The hell with it, episode 256

2654
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
I kind of go through this thing where I don't

2655
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Want to do things that are too expected

2656
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Or too much of the

2657
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Everybody loves this fucking game, ooh

2658
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
You know, I want to do something

2659
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
That maybe people haven't heard of

2660
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Or good games that people just

2661
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
May have overlooked

2662
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Sometimes you have to do Final Fantasy 6 twice

2663
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
No, sometimes

2664
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Yeah

2665
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Well, like I said

2666
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
It's hard to remember

2667
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
You know, I'm probably going to have to do Kickle Cubicle

2668
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Just because

2669
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Dan was playing it the other day

2670
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
I still have a list like a mile long of Commodore 64 games

2671
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Whenever you're ready

2672
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
You need to show me some of these games

2673
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
I'm going to do Oregon Trail next week, guys

2674
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
That would be awesome, why don't you do Oregon Trail?

2675
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
I might

2676
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
If you have some suggestions for Dark Soccer

2677
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Oregon Trail is stuck in my head because I just got finished reading

2678
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Problem Sleuth

2679
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
And there's a whole tribute to Oregon Trail in there

2680
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Nice

2681
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
You can hit Dark Soccer up on Tumblr

2682
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
I usually would give out your Twitter

2683
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
You know what, I make sure to check Twitter at least once a week

2684
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
So my Twitter is

2685
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
DarkSakura

2686
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
My Tumblr is Kurotsubasa

2687
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A

2688
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Blackwing

2689
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Because I'm so dark

2690
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Or, uh, shoot

2691
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Harass me on the mailbag

2692
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
I'll complain about it and then critique your grammar

2693
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
And then I'll probably do it

2694
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Alright, mailbag at orangeonstrader.com

2695
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
We're going to take a break, though

2696
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
I think I've done Twinbee

2697
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
We're going to take a break, then we're going to come back

2698
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
And we're going to do the mailbag

2699
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
And the FUs of the Week

2700
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
And your live phone calls

2701
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Rapid Fire News

2702
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
PS4 sales

2703
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Politics and games

2704
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
And pornography in part B tonight

2705
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Yes, a legit porn story

2706
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Coming up in part B tonight

2707
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
So you definitely don't want to go anywhere

2708
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
We will be right back after this

2709
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live on this Sunday evening

2710
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
November the 17th, 2013

2711
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,000
With the 527th episode of our show already in progress

2712
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:39,000
And some good classic songs from some old games there during our break

2713
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Which sadly we can't play during the podcast

2714
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
But we do play live

2715
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
We had the epilogue from Final Fantasy IV

2716
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Which I always love that ending

2717
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
And then Mega Man 7's introduction

2718
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Which, you know, I think there's mixed opinions on Mega Man 7

2719
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
But I thought it was pretty cool

2720
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
During the break, a lot of folks in our chat room

2721
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
I noticed over at live.vognetwork.com

2722
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Talking about weight loss and a lot of successes

2723
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Which is interesting

2724
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Because Thanksgiving is not usually the time of year

2725
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
When you hear about weight loss

2726
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
But a lot of people have been successful with their various things

2727
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Including Dark Soccer

2728
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
You've been doing very well

2729
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Yeah, I'm actually

2730
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
And I know it's going to sound fad-like and everything

2731
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
But I've done similar stuff before

2732
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
And I honestly feel better doing it

2733
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
As I'm doing this whole ketogenic eating thing

2734
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Where it's like really low carb

2735
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
But you also have a percentage of like how much fat you eat

2736
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
And how much protein you eat

2737
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
And that's a lot of protein

2738
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:36,000
But I also go to the gym at least once a week

2739
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,000
And I do body weight exercises in my house

2740
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
If I don't go to the gym

2741
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
So it's working out with weights three times a week

2742
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
And walking on the opposite days

2743
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
I really couldn't do low carb

2744
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Because I just love bread

2745
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Is there a diet where I can eat nothing but bread?

2746
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Well, I did find a recipe to make bread

2747
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Out of coconut flour

2748
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Oh, I like coconut

2749
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:02,000
And Tiara sent me a recipe to do red velvet cupcakes

2750
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Which I'm going to be trying

2751
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
I have actually found a lot of people

2752
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Speak very highly of almond flour bread

2753
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
And coconut flour bread

2754
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Interesting

2755
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
I haven't missed it, honestly

2756
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
I need to get motivated

2757
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
I need to get Wii Fit U

2758
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Well, to be honest

2759
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
It was just sort of like

2760
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
You remember when I moved out here

2761
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
How much I put on

2762
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
I'm going to say it on air, I was a size 20

2763
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
I don't mind saying it

2764
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
And I dropped down to a 12

2765
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
And then I put back on some

2766
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
So it's like

2767
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
I could just continue

2768
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
To eat all of the stuff that makes me feel like shit

2769
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Because I've got digestion problems

2770
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Eating too much sugar

2771
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Actually makes me

2772
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Have a harder time concentrating

2773
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
And since cutting all of it out

2774
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
I'm actually feeling infinitely better than I ever did

2775
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
And plus, I have more energy for

2776
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Stuff I want to do

2777
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
I'm planning on playing DDR again

2778
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Gene in our chat room at Live.vongnetwork.com says

2779
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Wow, we are all so healthy

2780
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Not me, no, not me

2781
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
AgDef says Wii Fit U up

2782
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I need to figure out something to get into

2783
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
We'll see

2784
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Alright, moving on

2785
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Let's get into some rapid fire news

2786
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Back to games

2787
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
This is another reason why I'm not losing any weight

2788
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Because I'm too busy playing video games

2789
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Although, no, I shouldn't play into that stereotype

2790
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Because there's a lot of people

2791
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
That play an awful lot of video games

2792
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
It's about finding the balance, absolutely

2793
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
And for those of you guys who don't listen to Hoard House

2794
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
I know Extrovert has a great story there

2795
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
He plays a lot of video games

2796
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
But he lost a lot of weight

2797
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
It's really quite something

2798
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Well, what I've started doing now

2799
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
I have set times now

2800
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
For me to play my games

2801
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
I play Animal Crossing in the morning

2802
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
So that I can go to the island and get a tan

2803
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Because fuck

2804
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
But I play while walking around the house

2805
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
And feeding the cat

2806
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
And putting up dishes

2807
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
And doing chores in the house

2808
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
I'll do parts of it

2809
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
And then the hour while my character is on the island

2810
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Is when I go do yoga

2811
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
I'm actually using my games

2812
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
To help me set my exercise times

2813
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Okay

2814
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
So I know that when an hour is up

2815
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I do about maybe 30 minutes of yoga

2816
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
And then I do

2817
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Just wandering around the house and some housework

2818
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Because housework counts as exercise, fuck it

2819
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
And by the time I'm done with that

2820
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
I know it's time to come back from the island

2821
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
And hit Ed with a bug net

2822
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Because fuck him

2823
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Yeah, I guess maybe there's a way I could

2824
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Get on the treadmill and have a 3DS

2825
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
With an iPad or something

2826
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
I used to play Pokemon on the recumbent bike

2827
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Nice, maybe I could figure something like that out

2828
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Oh well, for now, let's get back into video games

2829
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Because that's what the show's about

2830
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
So, Loki, some rapid fire news for us

2831
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Yes, Infamous Second Son

2832
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Which was supposed to be coming out

2833
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
First quarter

2834
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
They finally announced that it will be launching

2835
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
March 21st in North America

2836
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
And they had a wonderful trailer

2837
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
That was during their whole launch special

2838
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
That they did

2839
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Definitely one of the only games I'm looking forward to

2840
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Another interesting one

2841
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Towerfall Ascension

2842
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
You may remember Towerfall from being one of the

2843
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
More popular Ouya games

2844
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Now it's coming to PC

2845
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
And it's going to be coming to Playstation 4 as well

2846
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
That's gonna suck for Ouya a little bit

2847
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Also brand new levels

2848
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
And they've got 50 new levels coming

2849
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
And 50 new versus levels

2850
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
4 more playable characters

2851
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,000
And 12 player cooperative quest mode

2852
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
6 additional power ups and more

2853
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
And last but not least

2854
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Rayman Legends is supposed to be coming to

2855
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Next gen consoles in February

2856
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
That's so funny

2857
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
It's like when the Wii U

2858
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Was supposed to be coming out in the Wii U in February

2859
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
And it never did

2860
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Are you throwing shade that that might not actually happen?

2861
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
I don't know if it's going to be in February

2862
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Yeah, it's going to be coming out in next gen consoles

2863
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
I don't know how they're going to make that

2864
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
It's going to look as good

2865
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
I would think on a next gen console

2866
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
They're going to have to

2867
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Yeah, maybe they don't do anything with the graphics

2868
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
They might just up rez some things

2869
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
And do some new textures and things to make it

2870
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Look a little sharper

2871
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Frame rate would be really good

2872
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
All I can think of in my head is that

2873
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Extrofer will have yet another reason to do a stream

2874
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Of Rayman Legends over on his little Twitch channel

2875
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
That he does

2876
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
I think he played the thing start to finish on Twitch

2877
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Interesting

2878
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Moving on, some stuff that I hear

2879
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
I hear click click click click

2880
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Click click click from Loki

2881
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
As soon as he's done with his story

2882
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Cookie cookie cookie cookie cookie cookie

2883
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
I'm going to be done with this game today

2884
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Your addiction is affecting your life in the following ways

2885
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
I may have cheated a little bit

2886
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Look at your life, look at your choices

2887
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
That's a teensy bit

2888
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Well maybe the next thing that Loki can get addicted to

2889
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Is Hatsune Miku Project D.Va

2890
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Nope

2891
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Ah hey, now this game is really cute

2892
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
And if you missed it on the Playstation 3

2893
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
For whatever reason, A buy it on sale

2894
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Or something, but B it will be coming out

2895
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
On the Vita in early 2014

2896
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Very cool, so yeah

2897
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Hatsune Miku coming out in the North America and Europe

2898
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
In early 2014

2899
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
On the Vita, so that was announced this week

2900
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Very exciting

2901
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
When we were getting into it a couple weeks ago

2902
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
On our last episode about the whole fact that

2903
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Swap Note was

2904
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Disabled on the 3DS, somebody had brought up

2905
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Well, we karaoke you

2906
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Has some, you know, F words

2907
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
And things in it, so why is it that

2908
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
You know, you can't send

2909
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Pictures of

2910
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Dongs on Swap Note, but yet you can

2911
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Have fucking shit and all these words

2912
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
In songs on We Karaoke You

2913
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Well, apparently this week it was

2914
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Announced that warnings

2915
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Will be added to the game's eShop

2916
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Page when you get an access

2917
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Token for We Karaoke You

2918
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
And in the app itself

2919
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
That will warn people

2920
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
We Karaoke You by JoySound

2921
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Is intended to provide users with

2922
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Access to a large catalog of songs

2923
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
From a broad range of music labels across a variety

2924
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Of musical genres designed to appeal

2925
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
To all musical tastes

2926
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
As such, Nintendo does not restrict which songs

2927
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Are included in the catalog of songs

2928
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Featured within the We Karaoke You by JoySound

2929
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Application

2930
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Blah blah blah blah blah, the songs aren't rated by

2931
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Peggy, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

2932
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
So

2933
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Interesting little

2934
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Retcon they had to do

2935
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
For lack of a better word on some of their

2936
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Other games that have adult themes

2937
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
I find this

2938
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Fascinating and I've got to check this out this week

2939
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
I heard about this before

2940
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
And I'm sure you all did too

2941
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
There was a Chinese hack a couple years ago

2942
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Of Final Fantasy 7

2943
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
That they shoved it into an NES

2944
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Cartridge, I don't know which Final Fantasy game they had

2945
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Hacked or if they programmed a new game or something

2946
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
But somebody took Final Fantasy 7 and put it

2947
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
In an NES cart, well that was a

2948
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Couple years ago that that happened but

2949
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
This week it was

2950
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Actually a translation

2951
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Patch that happened by

2952
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Modder Luigia

2953
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
I'm tempted to say Luigia

2954
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
But it's Luigia 2009

2955
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Actually it was a whole team it wasn't just one guy

2956
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
But this modder led this team to

2957
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Actually translate the game but at the same

2958
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Time they actually fixed

2959
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Some things, they redrew some of the graphics

2960
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Improved the music

2961
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Did an actual ending, bug fixes

2962
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Improvements, this is kind of crazy

2963
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Now it's like a legit game

2964
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
That you can play through and check out if you

2965
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Want to check it out in English because I guess it was super broken

2966
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
In its original form but now it's

2967
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Able to play so really

2968
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Curious to see what that looks like

2969
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Yeah

2970
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Their next project that they're working on

2971
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
A

2972
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Unlicensed NES port of

2973
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Pokemon Yellow that came out from

2974
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
The same company on the NES

2975
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
They're going to redo that one in English and fix some of those

2976
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Issues next

2977
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
That's pretty awesome

2978
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Dark Sakura

2979
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Sounds fairly cool

2980
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Well in other news there is some information about

2981
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Metal Gear Solid 5

2982
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Ground Zeroes there's going to be

2983
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
A

2984
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Snake skin

2985
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
A solid snake skin

2986
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
So that you can run around as actual

2987
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Snake

2988
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
And there's going to be a Playstation exclusive

2989
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Mission called Deja Vu

2990
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
There's a trailer for it that's been out

2991
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
And this is supposed to come out in the spring of 2014

2992
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
For the various systems

2993
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Of Microsoft and Sony persuasions

2994
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
In

2995
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Other news

2996
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
There is

2997
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Going to be

2998
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
It looks like a third

2999
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
A new third person game that's coming out by Monolith

3000
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Called Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor

3001
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
That is going to be based

3002
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
In the Lord of the Rings universe and

3003
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
You play as a ranger

3004
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
A ranger named Talion

3005
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
So

3006
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
He's resurrected

3007
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
As a vengeful spirit

3008
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
And he gets to be a wraith

3009
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Like person

3010
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
And then last but not least

3011
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
In the

3012
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Thing that refuses to load on my

3013
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
iPad

3014
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
There is a new character that has been confirmed

3015
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
For the next Smash Brothers and that's Marth

3016
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Not really a new

3017
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Character but you know

3018
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Marth fans will be happy that he's back

3019
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
As long as we get Roy too

3020
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
I think some of the

3021
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Partner characters are the ones in danger

3022
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Like you know it's no

3023
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
It's no surprise

3024
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
That Star Fox will be a character

3025
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
That's in the game but will

3026
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Captain Falcon come back or not Captain Falcon

3027
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
God dammit

3028
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Captain Falcon from F-Zero will absolutely

3029
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Be there

3030
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
This bird Falco

3031
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
He may not be back

3032
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Good

3033
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
But I would think that those are the characters in danger

3034
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Of the partner characters

3035
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
He is kind of a bitch isn't he

3036
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Yeah he's totally a bitch not even a good kind of bitch

3037
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Only good Falco did music in the 1980's

3038
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Hey Rob

3039
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Show me your moves

3040
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
I will show you the FUGO

3041
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Question of the week

3042
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Every week over at

3043
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Facebook and Google Plus

3044
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
You take those words and slam it together you get FUGO

3045
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
We ask a question of our listeners

3046
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
And we read some of the answers here for y'all

3047
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Here on the show

3048
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
This week's question as asked of our communities

3049
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Since the Playstation 4 came out

3050
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
We've noticed an increase of social media

3051
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Posts coming from the device

3052
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
This can include tweets or Facebook

3053
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Posts when someone starts playing the game

3054
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Have y'all noticed this cause I sure did

3055
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Lots more Facebook posts coming from the Playstation 4

3056
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
I ignore Facebook

3057
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Kind of, well I haven't blocked it

3058
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
But I haven't really paid attention

3059
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
I noticed a big increase in the amount of posts

3060
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
I see posts now when people start

3061
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Playing a game

3062
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
So I was very surprised at the increased

3063
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Amount of

3064
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
You know I don't want to say spam

3065
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
But automated posts

3066
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Coming from the Playstation

3067
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Anyway so that led into our question this week

3068
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
For the Playstation 4 owners

3069
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Do you use social media posting features on your new device

3070
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Why or why not

3071
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
For the non Playstation 4 owners

3072
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Do you like seeing the social media posts

3073
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Made from the Playstation 4

3074
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
So let's get to some of the answers

3075
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
There's so many tonight I'm not going to be able to read them all

3076
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
We'll start with a couple from Google Plus

Colin M replied and said

3078
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
I only like to see posts when a person starts a game

3079
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
For the first time

3080
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
That way I know what games they're playing

3081
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
And maybe join in or talk to them about it

3082
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
I do not need to see every time an achievement

3083
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Or trophy unlocks

3084
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
I would agree especially if you're meaning

3085
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Not to say like the first and

3086
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Not the subsequent times

3087
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
They start the game but the very first time

3088
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Just to kind of know that they have it

3089
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
And you can ask them questions about it

3090
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
But I don't need to see like

3091
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
So and so is playing Resogun for the 7000th time today

3092
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
I don't need to see that

3093
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Redertainment says

3094
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
As a non Playstation 4 owner

3095
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Posts of people having fun with their PS4

3096
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Serve as a taunt to me

3097
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
A taunt of things that they have that I don't

3098
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I'm experiencing this more and more as I pursue

3099
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
When but not if but when

3100
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
I buy my house and I begin to fill

3101
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Social media with pictures of my house

3102
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Those pictures will taunt people with what I have

3103
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
And they don't

3104
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
That's true

3105
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
What's the whole point of doing it though?

3106
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Is to say oh so and so has this

3107
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
I want that

3108
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Is that why people post pictures of their kids too?

3109
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
My kids the cutest

3110
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Happy face

3111
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Well I personally think that for some people

3112
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Having children is an unspoken competition

3113
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Don't get me started on that

3114
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
For some people I've met

3115
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Buying a house is an unspoken competition

3116
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
So I'm just saying

3117
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
In the past

3118
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
A good friend of mine just bought a house

3119
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
I'm not shading that I'm talking about in the past

3120
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Many years ago

3121
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
And Alan

3122
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Alan knows exactly what I'm talking about and he's over there

3123
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Saying it too. Alright anyway

3124
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Let's see

3125
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Act Def says I only try to use any

3126
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Social media sharing when it's something like

3127
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Truly special or great

3128
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Like getting a really hard achievement or trophy

3129
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Or telling people that I'll stream a game

3130
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Since now that's possible with the new consoles

3131
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Let's go over to Facebook and get some

3132
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Of the answers over on Facebook

3133
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
And see what people said there

3134
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
How about Burr who said

3135
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
So far as a PS4 owner I've only posted one

3136
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Gameplay clip to Facebook

3137
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Mostly just to see if it worked

3138
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Nobody responded though so I'll probably save it for funny bugs

3139
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Or things that are actually interesting

3140
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
People probably don't want to hear about every little thing I do

3141
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
So I shut off the automatic posting

3142
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
The real fun so far has been the Twitch streaming

3143
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
It's actually an incentive to keep playing

3144
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Since you're entertaining others as much as yourself

3145
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Scott W said

3146
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
I've just started trying it out with screenshots

3147
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
I like it

3148
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Code Man says I don't have a PS4 yet

3149
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
But I don't mind posts if they are from consoles

3150
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
What frustrates me is when people invite me to

3151
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Facebook games and Candy Crush

3152
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
But I enjoy seeing what my friends are playing

3153
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
And it's a chance to get an unbiased opinion

3154
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Rather than the media companies

3155
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Telling me what to play

3156
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
I like that answer

3157
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Tiger Claw says

3158
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
While having those features on the PS4 is good

3159
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
When you want to post something

3160
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
The only downside is your Twitter or Facebook posts

3161
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Would be spammed with so and so playing this game

3162
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Or unlock a trophy

3163
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
If they give the player the ability to control

3164
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
What is posted on Twitter and Facebook

3165
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Then some people won't be bombarded with PS4 spam

3166
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
I kind of agree

3167
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
I don't like the whole idea of all or nothing

3168
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Let me

3169
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
I know on the PS3 you don't get to pick

3170
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Either you turn it on or you turn it off

3171
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
And you can turn on certain types of posts

3172
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
But I can't tell it

3173
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Only post these trophies or what have you

3174
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
That would be a little better I would think

3175
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Or they could have the trophy pop up

3176
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
And say hey do you want to post this to your wall

3177
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Gene W replied

3178
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
I currently do not have a PS4

3179
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
However I'm against these messages

3180
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Because I dislike them already on Facebook

3181
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
And don't really have a desire to have a friends list

3182
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Flaming Toilet

3183
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Flaming Toilet

3184
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
God I love that name

3185
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Responds and says I may be a grumpy old man

3186
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
But I think we've gone way overboard with social media

3187
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Integration everywhere not just gaming

3188
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
The world doesn't need to know my business

3189
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
I certainly don't want to annoy people with it

3190
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Anymore than I have to

3191
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
And I don't really care what trophies other people get or whatever

3192
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
And yes there's every bit of irony

3193
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
In using social media to bitch

3194
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
About social media's ever growing presence

3195
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
In our lives

3196
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
So that's a good way to end it

3197
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
I only read like half the answers

3198
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
So please do check out Facebook and Google Plus for more answers

3199
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Facebook.com slash

3200
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Orange Lounge Radio

3201
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Or Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio

3202
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
That's right we finally have a short URL

3203
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio

3204
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
And then there's the whole like you know

3205
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Google Plus shoved down throat

3206
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
YouTube comments thing

3207
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
All tweaked and stuff and how people love that

3208
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Yeah I'm not sure how I feel about all that

3209
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Like I'm trying to embrace it

3210
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
I'm trying to do the whole hug it for 15 minutes

3211
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
And see if I like it

3212
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
I will tell you this the fact that I

3213
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Hug it for 15 minutes and see if you get a skin disease

3214
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
I'm trying to

3215
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Trying to embrace it

3216
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
With the whole fact that I'm getting into YouTube

3217
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
More which is unrelated but I'm like alright

3218
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Well maybe this is an incentive to use Google Plus

3219
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
To do more like gaming style posts

3220
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
That tie into the YouTube's ideas

3221
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
I'm like I'm trying to like it that way

3222
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
But obviously it's a very

3223
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Unpopular change

3224
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
But I don't know

3225
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Google used to be the company that you know

3226
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Could do no wrong and

3227
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Lately between

3228
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
You know what was that

3229
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Before they had Google Plus they had

3230
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
What was that social net Buzz oh god

3231
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
That network yeah that was

3232
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Just bad and then you know

3233
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
They've done some weird things lately

3234
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
No hmm

3235
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
I still love them but I question some of their

3236
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Choices alright let's

3237
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Let's get back into some long gaming news

3238
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Loki Buzz

3239
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
I forgot about that

3240
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Anyways

3241
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Let's talk about PlayStation 4 again

3242
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Why not

3243
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Sold 1 million units the first day

3244
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
So that's got to be pretty good

3245
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
And kind of

3246
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Along the lines of their

3247
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Prediction which is or I should say

3248
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Projection

3249
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
3 million units sold by the end of the year

3250
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
The estimate by Jack Tritten

3251
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
So

3252
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Yeah so that's

3253
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Pretty good and you know definitely

3254
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
I think availability is gonna

3255
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
You know factor in quite

3256
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Heavily especially with the

3257
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Systems coming I don't think it's gonna be an issue

3258
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Where I'm not really sure

3259
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
With the Wii U whether it was you know

3260
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Availability as a problem

3261
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Or demand not being

3262
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Actually I think it's demand not being that high because

3263
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
I remember there was a bunch of systems

3264
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Sitting at retail

3265
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
In piles and no one gave

3266
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
A shit but

3267
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
PlayStation 4 you know and if

3268
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
There's any sort of indicator whatsoever

3269
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
The grey market

3270
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Is pretty profitable right now so

3271
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
There is demand for the system

3272
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
It's just gonna be availability is gonna kind of

3273
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Slim until

3274
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
I don't know a few months from now

3275
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
And actually it may even be a few months more

3276
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Because you know with the launch and other territories

3277
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
You know they're gonna

3278
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Have to ramp up production more

3279
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Or you know there's just gonna be less systems

3280
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
That go around

3281
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
What types of shortages though that we saw

3282
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Like with the Wii and the 360

3283
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
I don't think it's gonna be as bad

3284
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
As you know the Wii

3285
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
You know what I've been hearing is like a few weeks

3286
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Out or probably a month from

3287
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Launch we're gonna see some more shipments

3288
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Coming in although

3289
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
You know this is completely one other side

3290
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Of you know the spectrum

3291
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
If you're you know consumer trying to

3292
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Pre-order one of those things

3293
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Keep in mind that these places taking pre-orders

3294
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
May have already sold out their second

3295
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Third fourth shipments so

3296
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
You know whereas I've been saying four weeks

3297
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
When we're you know expecting to see some more

3298
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
They yeah

3299
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Are gonna expect them you know more systems in

3300
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
But those may be for customers that already have it

3301
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
You may in fact I think a lot of

3302
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Like the game subs and stuff are saying

3303
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
February now if you haven't pre-ordered yet so

3304
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
You know keep an eye on that and Amazon

3305
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Yeah but you know what GameStop

3306
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Loves to use scare tactics to get people to

3307
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Pre-order so fuck that I don't believe anything

3308
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
They say as far as the pre-order

3309
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
I think Amazon had bundles available

3310
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
You know game system bundles

3311
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
It's probably people like me that cancel their pre-orders honestly

3312
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
They probably had a few of those

3313
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
To go so somebody bought my PlayStation 4

3314
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Which is fine

3315
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
But yeah that's probably what that was

3316
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
To be honest

3317
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Alright um

3318
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
How do you think the Xbox One will sell?

3319
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
I mean I don't want to get too fanboy wars-ish

3320
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
But what do you think?

3321
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
I think it'll sell alright

3322
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
I'm worried that they're gonna have a bigger problem

3323
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Because as of right now

3324
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
They're really

3325
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Shrinking down who's getting the system

3326
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
And you're not gonna see it

3327
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
You're not gonna see it at all

3328
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Independent retailers you're gonna see it at

3329
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
The big stores and that's it

3330
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
So if they're having an issue with production

3331
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
On that stuff then

3332
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Yeah they could be a problem but

3333
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
I think they've got a pretty decent lineup

3334
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
At launch and I think they'll do about as well as the

3335
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
PlayStation or the Xbox One

3336
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Or the PlayStation 4 and the

3337
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Xbox One will do about the same

3338
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Really it comes down to exclusives and

3339
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Let's be honest going

3340
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Forward you know in the least immediate future

3341
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
A lot of the games that are coming out next gen

3342
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Are on both systems so it's

3343
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
There's not a whole lot differentiating

3344
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
One from the other

3345
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
As far as games go I mean

3346
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
So I don't know

3347
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Titanfall I guess I mean there's that

3348
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
But that's on 360 even

3349
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
And PC so I don't know

3350
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Alright well um going back to

3351
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
A story we talked about on our last episode before

3352
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
We had a break we talked about Pocketstation

3353
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Remember the Pocketstation was that

3354
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Cool little portable thing that they

3355
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Had on the PlayStation

3356
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
With the kitty mascot

3357
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
And that there were rumors

3358
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
That it was making a comeback because of some

3359
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Trademarks that had been registered well guess what

3360
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Pocketstation came out as a

3361
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Free app for the PlayStation Vita

3362
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
In Japan and

3363
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Yeah the app is free for

3364
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Japanese PlayStation Plus members

3365
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
They say it includes Crash Bandicoot 3

3366
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Mega Man, Ape Escape and other

3367
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Original PlayStation titles I don't know if that's some type of

3368
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Perk for the PlayStation Plus

3369
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Some free PS1 titles that actually maybe used

3370
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
The Pocketstation

3371
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
But that's pretty cool

3372
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
On December 3rd non PlayStation Plus

3373
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Japanese owners will be able to get it

3374
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
There's also

3375
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
A PlayStation title that's going to be added

3376
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
To that Dokodemo Isho

3377
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Comes out no word about

3378
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
When this is being released in the US but

3379
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
You gotta think that hey if it happened over there

3380
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
It will probably happen here too at some point

3381
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
That's pretty cool

3382
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
That'll be a fun little perk for PlayStation Plus

3383
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Users over here especially if those free games

3384
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Are still involved

3385
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
The other thing I was going to mention and we kind of forgot to mention

3386
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Is the PS Vita

3387
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
TV came out over in Japan

3388
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Oh yeah!

3389
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
The other thing that I heard

3390
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
That kind of sucked about it is it's region locked

3391
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Oh come on!

3392
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
The Vita doesn't normally do that

3393
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
It's a little strange that it's like that

3394
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
They're trying to stop us from

3395
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
I'm not sure

3396
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
I don't know if it's region locked

3397
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
I don't know, I had to read up

3398
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
I didn't really look into it too much

3399
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
I gotta be honest when that thing comes over here

3400
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
I kind of want one

3401
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Especially with all these free games I'm getting

3402
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
From the PlayStation Plus

3403
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
I could play these PSP

3404
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
And Vita and PlayStation games

3405
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
And stuff on there

3406
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
I don't know, I think that'd be pretty awesome

3407
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
You know Jean has a good question in our chatroom

3408
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
At live.vognetwork.com saying

3409
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
I wonder if the Vita sales went up with the PlayStation 4 release

3410
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
You know we're not hearing a lot about that

3411
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
But I'm hearing about the second screen

3412
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
People are really loving that, those that do have a Vita

3413
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
I do have to tell you that Dan was telling me that

3414
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Vita actually went on sale at Radio Shack

3415
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
For 120

3416
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
That did happen the week we were gone, yeah

3417
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
I remember reading about that

3418
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Loki, have you heard anything about the sales for Vita?

3419
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
I mean I can't imagine there's a lot of people

3420
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
That can afford to buy both at once

3421
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
I haven't really been seeing, we haven't been seeing

3422
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
A lot of Vita sales

3423
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
I mean it'd be interesting to see

3424
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
If it does go up at retail

3425
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
I'm thinking if anything people just clearing out

3426
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Inventory because they probably are sitting on a bunch of them

3427
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
I'm sure with Black Friday you're gonna see

3428
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Some special deals on that stuff

3429
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
There was supposed to be one that was with Tearaway

3430
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
But that got retailer exclusive

3431
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Well it will

3432
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Also still be interesting to see what happens with

3433
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
The PlayStation Vita in Japan

3434
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Versus here because I realize that Christmas

3435
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Has been quite the same in Japan as it is here

3436
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
But it's still, you know, a deal

3437
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
And there's gonna be the PlayStation Vita

3438
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
That new, the new colors

3439
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
And the new redesign

3440
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Of it already happened

3441
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
So that's kind of what Sony's pushing in Japan right now

3442
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
So I'm really curious to see how that kind of affects things

3443
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Cause you could look at potentially

3444
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
There being more Vitas

3445
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Per person in Japan

3446
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Than there are here

3447
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
It'll be very interesting to see how that affects the development of the games

3448
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
So

3449
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Go to our channel at live.vognetwork.com

3450
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Brad, our buddy from Pod Culture

3451
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Who has renamed himself

3452
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
PS4 Culture tonight

3453
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Says his co-host Glenn bought a Vita

3454
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Just for the PlayStation 4 tie-in stuff

3455
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Wow

3456
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
That's a heck of a purchase

3457
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
But hey, if you can do it, why not?

3458
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Alright

3459
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
More news, Dark Sakura

3460
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Taking a different turn here

3461
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Well, game politics has alerted us to something

3462
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Remember how we kept talking about

3463
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
The 38 Studios and their

3464
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Sort of

3465
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Down turn with the

3466
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Local economy in Rhode Island

3467
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Yes, that was the one that was owned by

3468
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
What was the name, Curt Schilling, the baseball player, right?

3469
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
You are correct

3470
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
The kingdom of Amalur

3471
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Exactly

3472
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Which was free on PlayStation Plus

3473
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Now there's State Senator Dawson

3474
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Hodgson

3475
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Who is a Republican, so whatever

3476
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Is putting out legislation to

3477
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Basically keep pushing to

3478
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Have an independent commission investigate

3479
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
What happened with 38 Studios

3480
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Which, I mean

3481
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
100 million on the state's

3482
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Debt

3483
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Is a pretty big deal, especially for such a tiny

3484
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
State, I mean

3485
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
I don't know too much more about Rhode Island

3486
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
I've known people from there

3487
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
The state loaned them money

3488
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Which is probably the reason for this

3489
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Which comes right out of

3490
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
You know, tax funds

3491
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
To pay for

3492
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
State improvement

3493
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Help benefits, that type of thing

3494
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
So I can see them wanting to

3495
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
To

3496
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Investigate this

3497
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
And one thing that he said

3498
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
I know that I'm not alone

3499
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
In the belief that the response of our government

3500
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Has been wholly insufficient to the task of delivering

3501
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Answers, accountability, and leadership

3502
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
In the wake of this massive destruction

3503
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
Of public resources

3504
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Swift enactment of the bill and diligent

3505
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
Prosecution of its mandate would vindicate these needs

3506
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
And I get where they're coming from

3507
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
At the same time

3508
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
I wonder

3509
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
If it's just something that

3510
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Is time to let go

3511
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Let go, move forward, find other ways of raising

3512
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
The funds, because you can't

3513
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Get water from a stone

3514
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Unless you happen to be squeezing cheese

3515
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Yeah, I mean I understand the reason why

3516
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
They might want to do the investigation

3517
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
But at the same time, it's like one of those

3518
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Well, it's not going to get the money back

3519
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
You know, what

3520
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Ultimate good is it really going to do

3521
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
I mean, I guess they can

3522
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Make sure this never happens again

3523
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
But I kind of think a lesson

3524
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Has certainly already been learned somewhere

3525
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
But maybe it's about holding certain people accountable

3526
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
I don't know

3527
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
I do think accountability is something

3528
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
To look into

3529
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
But at the same time, I'm wondering if perhaps

3530
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
The state might have been a little short-sighted

3531
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
With the company in the middle of a recession

3532
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Were they starry-eyed

3533
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
At the fact it was a sports star?

3534
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Probably

3535
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Did you hear that they found a full

3536
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Finished game on their servers

3537
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
That they're going to now auction off in December

3538
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Really? No

3539
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
There was another game that was literally done

3540
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
It was for Mac, actually

3541
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
It was a PC game

3542
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Weird, some sort of tactics game

3543
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
Well, they should do it

3544
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
I thought that was kind of funny

3545
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Well, Rhode Island paid for it

3546
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Why didn't you sell it?

3547
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
You could have made some money back

3548
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Yeah, a little bit

3549
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
The sad thing is it probably won't sell for very much money

3550
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
Because nobody knows about it

3551
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
It's got not a lot behind it

3552
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Probably go at bargain-basement prices

3553
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
And somebody will flip it and do pretty well with it

3554
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
We'll see

3555
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Alright, let's move on

3556
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Loki

3557
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
So let's talk about

3558
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Zune

3559
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
And the fact that

3560
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
I think we already knew it was kind of shutting down

3561
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
But it's

3562
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
It's going away

3563
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
As soon as the Xbox One launch

3564
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
And yeah

3565
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
They're not going to support rental purchasing

3566
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Or browsing of content

3567
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
And it's going to be

3568
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
I guess now everything is being taken care of

3569
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Through Xbox Music

3570
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
I guess if you're a previous Zune user

3571
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
And you log into the

3572
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Xbox Music service

3573
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
It will show your library

3574
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
As a virtual collector

3575
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
And I guess any previous purchase

3576
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Video content

3577
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Will transfer over

3578
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
So that's good

3579
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
It's too bad

3580
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
They really tried to

3581
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
They tried to make Zune happen

3582
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
They really tried

3583
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
They sort of tried to compete with the iPods

3584
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
And it just didn't quite happen

3585
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
We had a nice listing in the Zune Cast Store

3586
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
For a while

3587
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Thanks to the new listeners we got through Zune Cast

3588
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Sorry to hear about what happened to your Zune

3589
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
But you know, it is what it is

3590
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
So

3591
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Alright, well in

3592
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Somewhat brighter news I guess on the Microsoft

3593
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Front, one of the games that people are

3594
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Very excited about on Xbox One

3595
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Killer Instinct

3596
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
And almost more so because of Killer Instinct Classic

3597
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
It's not just the fact that there's the new Killer Instinct

3598
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
Heck yeah

3599
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
But that you can play the classic Killer Instinct as well

3600
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
The Ultra Edition

3601
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Is coming out of the classic Killer Instinct

3602
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
It will have two versions

3603
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Of the arcade version

3604
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Of Killer Instinct, obviously it's not the

3605
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Super Nintendo version, I mean right

3606
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
So Killer Instinct will get

3607
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
The arcade versions

3608
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Killer Instinct Classic will have the original

3609
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Arcade version, version 1.4

3610
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
And the upgraded

3611
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
ROM revision 1.5D

3612
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Which has glitch fixes

3613
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Infinite combos that were discovered

3614
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
After the game's initial releases

3615
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Were fixed

3616
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Also some emulating scamline

3617
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Options

3618
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
A training mode is there now though

3619
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
And sprite galleries will be available

3620
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
So that's pretty cool

3621
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
The Killer Instinct Classic

3622
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
It is only available in Killer Instinct

3623
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Ultra Edition

3624
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
And the boxed pin Ultimate Edition

3625
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
You will not be able to buy it separately

3626
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
So if you want this, you have to buy

3627
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
The free to play Killer Instinct game

3628
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
That's the only way to do it

3629
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
But there's definitely a lot of

3630
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
I know people that are going to be buying it

3631
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Just so they can have the classic version

3632
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Because you know what, Killer Instinct

3633
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Especially the classic version was awesome

3634
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
And it will have more characters than the new one

3635
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
That's the sad part

3636
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
They announced

3637
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
Full Gore

3638
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
For what it's worth, Full Gore

3639
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
The classic one is way better than the new one

3640
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Alright

3641
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
You know what's way better each and every week

3642
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Is our mailbag

3643
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Guys at our email address

3644
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

3645
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Dark Soccer

3646
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Is going to dive into the mailbag head first

3647
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
And find some emails that she

3648
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Deems worthy of reading on the show

3649
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
And I imagine after a week off we have quite the backlog

3650
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:22,000
No?

3651
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
A few

3652
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
There is a really

3653
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Long one that I'm just

3654
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Going to

3655
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Only read the first paragraph

3656
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Because this is really

3657
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Fucking long

3658
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
And I'm not going to read the uber novel

3659
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Sorry

3660
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
It's from

3661
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
RawStillUT

3662
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Well in a few hours I'll be waiting

3663
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
In a midnight line for the PS4 at my local GameStop

3664
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
So I thought I would shoot you guys an email before that

3665
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Anyway when talking about the news

3666
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
That define the generation

3667
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
I am surprised that Brown vs Entertainment Merchants Association

3668
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Wasn't brought up

3669
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
With all the talk of blaming video games for society's ills

3670
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
It's hard to argue with a 7 to 2 decision

3671
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
When the time comes

3672
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
For another state to try and strip the gaming industry

3673
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Of its right to free expression

3674
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
After all, even if a law could be narrowly

3675
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Tailored to

3676
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Alito and Roberts

3677
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
I am not sure

3678
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Which I'm not sure

3679
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Even can happen in the current political climate

3680
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
It still leaves 5 justices

3681
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
Who were pretty much close to the idea

3682
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Outright

3683
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Whoever eventually replaces the older members of the court

3684
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Will almost certainly be more aware of gaming as a medium

3685
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
And California's already beaten economy

3686
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Was done no favors

3687
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
By the massive reimbursement they had to give the EMA

3688
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
No doubt we'll continue to see

3689
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Scumbag politicians try to pass

3690
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
Feel-good legislations restricting game content

3691
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
We're probably not going to see

3692
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Yet another case go to the Supreme Court

3693
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
Anytime soon

3694
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
As they tend not to listen to the same issues

3695
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
That often

3696
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
This case has given us a huge buffer

3697
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
And while we can't take anything for granted

3698
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
It's hard to see where we'll see

3699
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Much more than summary dismissals

3700
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Of the sort of poorly written

3701
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Headline chasing tripe legislation

3702
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
I love that term, tripe legislation

3703
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
That had defined the previous

3704
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Decade

3705
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
I'll go so far as to say this will define the next generation

3706
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
As well

3707
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
That is a good pick of something

3708
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
That kind of fell off of our radars

3709
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
I'm not going to deny that that is a very good selection

3710
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
I think one reason

3711
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
That maybe we don't think

3712
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Of it right away compared to some of the other things

3713
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
We talked about last week is because we did kind of dodge a bullet

3714
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
And I think in a lot of our minds

3715
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Yeah, this is the way it should be

3716
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Duh!

3717
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Oh, the whole fact that the Supreme Court

3718
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Decided to say that this is a bad idea

3719
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Duh! We all knew it was a bad idea

3720
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
So no harm no foul, right?

3721
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
I'm not belittling

3722
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
The response because I think

3723
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Yeah, absolutely, this is a decision

3724
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
By the Supreme Court that impacts

3725
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Gaming, period

3726
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
But I think that's why

3727
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
A lot of us kind of neglect to remember it

3728
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Because it's kind of like, well, they ended up

3729
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
On our side like they should have been

3730
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
So, la di da, didn't really change anything

3731
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
At the end of the day, hooray

3732
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Anyway

3733
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
And I always have to give it

3734
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
To Rossdale, UT for

3735
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Definitely bringing up points

3736
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
That are

3737
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Definitely apt

3738
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
When it comes to comparing

3739
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
What you see in

3740
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
The current generation of gaming

3741
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Especially with bringing up how

3742
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
We are on that line from changing

3743
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Sort of how we're thinking

3744
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Of our games

3745
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
To how we used to think of our games

3746
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
It really is a line that's been crossed

3747
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Too many of the people now

3748
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
That are in charge of the industry

3749
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Were people like us

3750
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Who grew up with it and now see it

3751
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
As a true medium of expression

3752
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
As opposed to

3753
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
You know, just bang bang

3754
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Yeah, I seem to remember that whole

3755
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Supreme Court decision thing

3756
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
I think the justice knew what Mortal Kombat was

3757
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Because he or she

3758
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
I don't remember which justice it was

3759
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Had interns or people

3760
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
In the office that knew the game and played it a lot

3761
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
So, I remember

3762
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
I just remember that that was

3763
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
I don't have the story in front of me so I don't remember the details

3764
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
I remember that was something out of it that I found fascinating

3765
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
It's like, hey, the Supreme Court knows Mortal Kombat

3766
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
It's not just a niche thing

3767
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
Dan's old boss named his daughter

3768
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Melina

3769
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Because his wife wouldn't let him name her Katana

3770
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
This is corporate boss

3771
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
I like the name Melina a lot

3772
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Not even just because of Mortal Kombat

3773
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
I actually met the guy, he's pretty cool

3774
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
But still, you know

3775
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
Robin Williams named his daughter Zelda

3776
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
True

3777
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
So

3778
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Moving on, and sorry Russell

3779
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
You'd see the rest of the email was just way too long

3780
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
But I did glance over it

3781
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
This comes from

3782
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Nark

3783
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Which was a great 90's arcade

3784
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
90's arcade game by the way

3785
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
But this is with a Q and not with a C

3786
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Oh, you're like Joystick

3787
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
The AOL block

3788
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Well, I'm weighing in a little late on the matter

3789
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
But I believe there is an overarching theme

3790
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
That connects the defining game

3791
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
With the defining news for the past generation

3792
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
That is online everything

3793
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Someone mentioned crowdfunding

3794
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
And an ME3 multiplayer

3795
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
It hasn't been that long

3796
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Since well launched

3797
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Now there are so many MMOs

3798
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
That once had spins

3799
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Although Ragnarok Online was the best of them

3800
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
And now you have MMOs being funded

3801
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Produced by the community

3802
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Star Citizen doesn't even exist

3803
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
And the players are already pumped for over

3804
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Already pumped over 25 million dollars

3805
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Into it

3806
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
And that's not the news story of the generation

3807
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
And if that's not, I can't read today

3808
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
If that's not the news story of the generation

3809
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
I don't know what would be more poignant

3810
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
So online everything

3811
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
But if I had to narrow it down

3812
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
World of Warcraft is the defining game of our generation

3813
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Like the game or not

3814
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
And even the Star Citizen crowdfunding

3815
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
Story is this generation's defining news event

3816
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
Great topic, game on

3817
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Nark

3818
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
I'm thinking of Pinky

3819
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
From Pinky and the Brain

3820
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
Instead of Nark

3821
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Here's the one reason

3822
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
I respectfully disagree with your choice

3823
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Of World of Warcraft is because the game

3824
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Came out in 2004

3825
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Was it 2003? 2004? I think it was 2004

3826
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
During the last generation

3827
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Because this generation didn't really start till

3828
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
2005-06 depending on

3829
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
You know, if PS3 or 360 kicked it off

3830
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
So that's my one

3831
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Slight

3832
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Dispute with that, but otherwise

3833
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
Honestly, I'm not invalidating any of your points

3834
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Because the rest of it's all very good

3835
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
And you know, with the Kickstarter

3836
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
And all that, absolutely

3837
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
And Gene says, he's naming his first child

3838
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Baraka

3839
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Which is better, Baraka or Blanca?

3840
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
Food for thought

3841
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
If you want your kid going around being named white

3842
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
No with a K

3843
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Wasn't that uh

3844
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
Yeah, but still

3845
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Hello peoples

3846
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
I'd like to extend my gratitude for Loki

3847
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
For the VoG Grand Theft Auto online community event

3848
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
That was held tonight, Friday night

3849
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
I'm sure it was a good time for those of you

3850
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Who could stay connected to the game

3851
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
Unfortunately, I could not

3852
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
The reason for this lies not with Rockstar Games

3853
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Anyone I was attempting to play with

3854
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
The reason I couldn't stay connected is due to my

3855
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
So-called broadband

3856
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Uh

3857
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
DS fucking L

3858
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
Okay, oh never mind

3859
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
DS fucking L

3860
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
My failed attempts to play Grand Theft Auto online

3861
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
With the VoG community has only given me more

3862
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Incentive to achieve my long-held goal

3863
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
I will accomplish project buy a house

3864
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
And when I do, I will get

3865
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
Cable internet, string cat5

3866
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Throughout my house, and finally achieve the true

3867
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Broadband gaming dream

3868
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
I have only dreamed of

3869
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
I will do this, I will stay

3870
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Blackwatertainment trainer

3871
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
You know what

3872
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
Um, you also want to look into your router

3873
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
If you're going to do the ultimate

3874
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Uh

3875
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
The ultimate uh

3876
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Wi-Fi or

3877
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Internet experience

3878
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Don't use whatever your

3879
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Provider gives you

3880
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
Goodbye your own

3881
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
It's also partially, I think, Rockstar as well

3882
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
I had trouble connecting it

3883
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
Some of the times I was getting disconnected from stuff

3884
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
I blame everything on

3885
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
Rockstars because they make me too jittery

3886
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
Anyway, um

3887
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
This one, uh, here is

3888
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
An update for OLR

3889
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
It's been six months since my wife Tracy

3890
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Passed away from a stroke at 47

3891
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
Uh, when I called in

3892
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
I was being- Oh, I remember this one

3893
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
Yes, when I called in I was being

3894
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
Evicted from the house I was renting and had to

3895
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Move in with a friend, the sad part is

3896
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
That re-

3897
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Is that really happened and I thought I was

3898
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Going to have to get a second job just to survive

3899
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
I was getting depressed but was surviving

3900
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
I still listen to the podcast regularly for

3901
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
A smile, I got more

3902
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
From the retirement system she was in than I figured

3903
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Being a responsible adult

3904
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Bites, I could have flown to Vegas and partied

3905
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
I paid off my SUV five years early

3906
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
And now I have no car payment, I paid off the bills

3907
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Left over from the last place, I bought

3908
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
Myself a new 55

3909
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Inch 3D TV, I will be getting

3910
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
An Xbox One and I

3911
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
Find one and a new

3912
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
No, when I find one and a new laptop

3913
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
For gaming, thank you for all your prayers

3914
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
It looks like I will be okay, I would call in

3915
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
But I am East Coast and work Monday

3916
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
I'm happy

3917
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
To hear that follow up, those of you that were here

3918
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Six months ago I'm sure remember that was

3919
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
I think in the 12 years that we've been doing OLR

3920
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
It was the hardest phone call we've ever taken on the show

3921
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
Yeah, I'm just gonna guess on a

3922
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Nickname that's a name in lights

3923
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
I believe that's right

3924
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
He's a really good guy

3925
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
We chat on Facebook all the damn time

3926
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Yeah, he used to do wow with us too

3927
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:45,000
So that whole thing though was really a testament to the power of community

3928
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Yeah, I get warm fuzzies hearing that it's gonna be okay for him

3929
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:56,000
And I'm glad to hear it's gonna be okay

3930
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
And I'm sure the listeners appreciate it

3931
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Even if it's six months later it's really nice to know

3932
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
Thank you

3933
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Stay in touch

3934
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
One more email

3935
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Howdy guys and gal, smile

3936
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
Yes, thank you for acknowledging my womanhood

3937
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Nice tits

3938
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:18,000
I was acknowledging your womanhood

3939
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Yes, they are quite nice

3940
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
I have a gorgeous rack

3941
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
I get complimented on it daily

3942
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Firstly, although we missed you last week

3943
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
I hope you all had a fantastic week off

3944
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
I did sleeping so that was great

3945
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
I went to Disneyland and BlizzCon

3946
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
It was amazing

3947
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Okay, now that we have the touchy feely bullshit out of the way

3948
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Oh hey

3949
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
A couple weeks ago I was watching Under Sedation Live

3950
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Which you can view and participate live every Saturday night

3951
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:46,000
At 10pm EST on vognetwork.com

3952
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Are you on Travis Donovan's payroll?

3953
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
Are you on his payroll?

3954
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Who is this?

3955
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Are you on Travis' payroll?

3956
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Did he offer you vog points?

3957
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
Travis and Jessica were talking about cult movies

3958
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Of the 90's, Boondock Saints, Cutthroat Island and Hackers

3959
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:05,000
This conversation got me to thinking of cult video games

3960
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
And what makes a cult game

3961
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
Is a cult game a game that people enjoy

3962
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
Despite the low review scores like Too Human?

3963
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:14,000
Is a cult game a game that did not have a stellar launch

3964
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:17,000
But managed to gain a huge following such as Demon's Souls?

3965
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
Is a cult game a game that people like to play

3966
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:22,000
Despite the low sales numbers such as Bulletstorm and Shadows of the Damned?

3967
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this

3968
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:27,000
And I'm eager to find out what you consider a cult game

3969
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:30,000
I'm also interested in finding out what your favorite cult game is

3970
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Not so sincerely, Degenerate Johnny

3971
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
AKA Rob's Parody Songwriter

3972
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Thanks

3973
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Thank you for not bringing that to this show

3974
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
That's a really good question

3975
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:44,000
And for the record, even though Travis gives me shit all the time on Under Sedation Live

3976
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
You really all should check out that show

3977
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
They have a lot of fun over there

3978
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:51,000
It's a bummer though y'all missed episode 6-66

3979
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Because I live for DJ Satan who was on that show

3980
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
Anyway, sorry

3981
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:01,000
But I just wanted to go ahead and let that plug air a little bit

3982
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
As far as the question on hand

3983
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
What makes a cult video game?

3984
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:08,000
Degenerate Johnny, I think it's kind of all those things that you named

3985
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
I don't think, there's no definition

3986
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:13,000
You don't go to the dictionary and see what makes a cult game

3987
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
I think it's a little bit of all those things

3988
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
And I think the definition is a little different for everybody

3989
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Well that and also when you have

3990
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:22,000
I think you should also look at the factor of

3991
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Well this is more like hipster game I would think

3992
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:30,000
When you have people outside of an age group the game is intended for

3993
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Playing the game

3994
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Like, I hate to say it

3995
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Pokemon

3996
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Pokemon's totally a cult game

3997
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:42,000
But does that label really fit when Pokemon is like a hugely selling game

3998
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:45,000
See that's why I relabeled it a hipster game

3999
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Definitely a cult of Pokemon

4000
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
I was going to say one of the biggest cult games there is is World of Warcraft

4001
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:53,000
Yeah, but now it's doing well

4002
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
It's such a huge game

4003
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
I feel weird calling that a cult game too

4004
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
This is how I look at it too

4005
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Maybe when you have something's popularity

4006
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Emerge after it was supposed to have its heyday

4007
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
For example, look at Rocky

4008
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Rocky Horror Picture Show

4009
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Yeah, the play was pretty good

4010
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
And had pretty decent following when the movie came out

4011
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Didn't it tank?

4012
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Yes, the movie originally tanked

4013
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
It was based on a play

4014
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
But the movie originally tanked

4015
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Which I've seen the play finally

4016
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
They noticed that in New York or somewhere

4017
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
A lot of the same people were going to see it over and over again

4018
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
And they started doing the midnight showing

4019
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:33,000
And the minute that somebody yelled

4020
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Buy an umbrella you cheap bitch

4021
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
At the screen, things changed forever

4022
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Well yeah, but I mean that's the thing that you have

4023
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Popularity is of a different sort

4024
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Than what was intended when the movie came out

4025
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Correct?

4026
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
So I think that if you look at

4027
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
For example

4028
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Portal, okay

4029
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:56,000
I think Portal was just sort of a throw in kind of game

4030
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:59,000
It was meant to be a fun little puzzler

4031
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
But it's the whole

4032
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Quirkiness of it that really got it a huge following

4033
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
And maybe got people

4034
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Got people moving outside of whatever was written in the game

4035
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Into the retarded vant-

4036
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
I hate using that word, why am I saying it?

4037
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Into the crazy-

4038
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
Leo-tarded

4039
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Leo-tarded

4040
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
That's what they say on Drag Race, totally Leo-tarded

4041
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:26,000
But I hate using that word because I do know people who

4042
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Anyway

4043
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Sorry

4044
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Oh yeah, and if you want to go for

4045
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
Like Jean just said, Shock Treatment, Ultra Cult

4046
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Oh my god, Shock Treatment

4047
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Shock Treatment's fucking hilarious

4048
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
You have to watch Shock Treatment like seven times before it even makes sense

4049
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
But the music is really good

4050
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
I need a bit of ooh

4051
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Shock Treatment

4052
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
You remember when we ate the hacker cookies

4053
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
When Evan lived with Jessica

4054
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:54,000
And these were cookies that were made with so much chocolate and no doughs

4055
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
That I was shaking after two of them

4056
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
I remember when I got really sick

4057
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
In 2008

4058
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
I was actually supposed to be in a shadow cast

4059
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Of Shock Treatment playing Ricky from the Rest Home

4060
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
I had to drop out because

4061
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
That was the year I got really sick and I had to go to the hospital

4062
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
So somebody replaced me

4063
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
But anyway

4064
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Well, SSJ100Matt is saying that Darkstalkers is a cult franchise

4065
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
But- Kinda

4066
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
Yeah, kinda, it wasn't as

4067
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Overly successful as most of Capcom's other things

4068
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
But see, it was always in the circles

4069
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
I lived in arcades with fighting games

4070
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
So they always had people on it

4071
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
I think a cult game is that game

4072
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Is that game that everybody

4073
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
Asks for a sequel for

4074
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
That you're never gonna get

4075
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Like Shenmue is a great example of a cult game

4076
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Like Half Life

4077
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Half Life by that definition

4078
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Is definitely a cult game

4079
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Or I was gonna joke Mega Man is now a cult game

4080
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
As of recent

4081
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
You know what a good example though of the

4082
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
I think

4083
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Blaster Master is a great example of a cult game

4084
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Yes, it got some sequels

4085
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
But they were worse than Shock Treatment

4086
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Let's be real

4087
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
It's hard to be worse unless you're Yaris

4088
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
What if Yaris got a sequel?

4089
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
The Wii remake wasn't awful

4090
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
But that's not saying much

4091
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
I'll give you another example of a great cult game

4092
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Because I don't think people know this one

4093
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Very well, Cultcept

4094
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Talked about this in the game before

4095
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
It's that whole like Magic the Gathering meets Monopoly

4096
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
I love that game

4097
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
But there's like one on the 360

4098
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
And on the Playstation 2 and that's really it

4099
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
I think it's bigger in Japan

4100
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
There's a lot of points in the chat

4101
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Rama brings up Rival Schools

4102
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Being more than Darkstalkers

4103
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Which I fully agree with

4104
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
And I fucking love Rival Schools

4105
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
And the people who love Rival Schools

4106
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
Really fucking love Rival Schools

4107
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
And Jean says PSO2 in the US

4108
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Which I was totally into PSO2 for a little while

4109
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
And then there's Final Fantasy

4110
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
And Queen Samia says

4111
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Any Bimani game

4112
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
In America, yes

4113
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
I would say

4114
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
VR got super super popular

4115
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
And now it's fallen into

4116
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Because of the cult status the imports had over here

4117
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
Now it's more in the mainstream

4118
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
But as far as I was aware

4119
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
In Japan, popin' music is everywhere

4120
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
And everyone fucking plays popin' music

4121
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
I love this

4122
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
Technus says those Burger King games

4123
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
Yeah, those

4124
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
Sneak King was a cult game of sorts

4125
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
Or fuck, everyone I knew that played Ragnarok online

4126
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Because that game was like

4127
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Oh, we have 3D games

4128
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
No, fuck you, we're playing our 2D little MMO

4129
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
SSG100Matt says

4130
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
So Chrono Trigger would be considered cult

4131
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
No, because you got Chrono Cross

4132
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
I'm just trollin'

4133
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Chrono Trigger was pretty popular

4134
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
It is a cult game of sorts

4135
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
Rageinator says Earthbound

4136
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
Kinda, yeah

4137
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Kid Icarus for a long time

4138
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
I would definitely call it a cult game

4139
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
In fact, in some ways it still is

4140
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
I would not consider that one a cult

4141
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Um

4142
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Pig bumpin'

4143
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
We had that

4144
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
Because the Parappa series

4145
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
For what it was

4146
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
It took off, I think, bigger

4147
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
In a way than it was supposed to

4148
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
And then Umjramalami

4149
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
And Parappa 2, those are sequels

4150
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
So I'm not gonna really count them as much

4151
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Now I will agree with Skullgirls

4152
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Because that game is

4153
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Pretty fun

4154
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
It wasn't getting a whole lot of attention

4155
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
But you have your dedicated

4156
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Fan base to it

4157
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
And because of that, we've had the Kickstarter go in

4158
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
A lot more of that too

4159
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
So yeah, Skullgirls is a pretty recent one

4160
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
Or maybe even La Mulana

4161
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
You know

4162
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
La Mulana is definitely a cult game

4163
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
If your name is Dark Tetsuya

4164
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Cave Story

4165
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Ooh, that's a good one too

4166
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
This is a great topic, but we are dragging it out

4167
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Yeah, it's time to move it on

4168
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
But great question, love it

4169
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Yeah, and we definitely

4170
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:53,000
Sort of discussed a little bit of what defines a cult game

4171
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
And Travis will now be able to say

4172
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
Yet again, they jacked another segment for my show

4173
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
And you know what I say?

4174
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Nothing, because it's a gesture

4175
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
And just remember, that saying

4176
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Love you, just a really strong love you

4177
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Love it

4178
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
It's a very deep kind of love

4179
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
It's a very thrusty, deep kind of love

4180
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
Alright

4181
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
Speaking of thrusty, deep kind of love

4182
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Thank you to all you guys that emailed us tonight

4183
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
And those of you that will email next week

4184
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
In advance, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com

4185
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Is the place to send those emails

4186
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Well, right along with that gesture

4187
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
We'll cue a new segment

4188
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Or not a new segment, a new segment?

4189
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
We need a new segment

4190
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
It's a brand new segment here on the show

4191
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
We've been doing it since episode one

4192
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
We're growing segments like bugs

4193
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
You wanna get a new segment on the show?

4194
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
We should get a new segment for OLR

4195
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
What should the new OLR segment be?

4196
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
Tweet us ideas

4197
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
We'll crowdsource this

4198
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
The OLR shit list

4199
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
New OLR segment

4200
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
Tweet us your ideas

4201
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
And I'm not bringing you back website of the week

4202
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
But, if we get a new segment

4203
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
Then an old segment's gotta go

4204
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
No

4205
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
We'll just live here forever

4206
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
I'm just gonna live under your table here

4207
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
And eventually Sanrio will like me

4208
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week

4209
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Fuck you to me

4210
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
Not having a job yet

4211
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
And I'm still waiting back to hear

4212
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
From Cool Job

4213
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
As I've been referring to it

4214
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
In writing Cool Job with a trademark

4215
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
Um

4216
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
It's really just very difficult

4217
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
To find work

4218
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
And, you know, Dan and I

4219
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
Are actually gonna be going out looking at houses next week

4220
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Cause

4221
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
We feel we're wasting money on rent

4222
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
And trying to

4223
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
You know, it's really hard

4224
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
To improve your situation when you are not

4225
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
Given the means to improve your situation

4226
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
And all those people who are

4227
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Bootstrap theorists

4228
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
Fuck you very much

4229
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Fuck you

4230
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Loki?

4231
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
Fuck you to Cookie Clicker

4232
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
I agree, fuck you to Cookie Clicker

4233
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
Do you have a permanent dent in your finger now?

4234
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Uh, no, but I'm almost done

4235
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
Seriously, I'm almost done

4236
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Cosdula has somehow arisen

4237
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
I don't know how this has happened

4238
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
But

4239
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
It's part of the game, I guess

4240
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
But he's in the devil

4241
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Grandmas turn evil

4242
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
Have to do an ancient practice

4243
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
To stop them from being evil

4244
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Um

4245
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
And I'm cheating, a lot

4246
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Of course you're cheating, this is Loki we're talking about

4247
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
It's to get done with the game, it's all about the end game

4248
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
You know?

4249
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
Alright, uh, my FU of the week

4250
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
Um, I guess I don't have a lot I'm mad at

4251
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
My FU of the week goes to these holiday candies

4252
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
But

4253
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
And, it's, Alan says they're grandma candy

4254
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
And they totally are

4255
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
It's like the mix, the holiday mix

4256
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Of those hard candies

4257
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
That grandma always had in a glass jar

4258
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
At her house

4259
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
Kinda, but they're not like

4260
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Butterscotch or anything

4261
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Everybody knows, you've seen these, they all clunk

4262
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Together too, like the hard candies

4263
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
These things are so addicting, I eat them and I've almost

4264
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Eaten like an entire bag

4265
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
And I wonder why I can't lose weight

4266
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
So FU to

4267
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
Candy for being delicious

4268
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
Bob, you suck

4269
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
What? You can do anything

4270
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
You put your mind to

4271
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
Okay, I wanna be a princess

4272
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
I'm thinking really hard

4273
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
It's not working, Dark Sakura

4274
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
I'm taking this home

4275
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
Are you compensating it?

4276
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
It looks nasty

4277
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
It's really good though

4278
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
It's just that candy pink in it

4279
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
You know? Uh, Codeman in chat says

4280
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
So I come to your house, you will offer me candy

4281
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Absolutely, if you're gonna make the trip out here

4282
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
From Oklahoma or wherever you are

4283
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
I will absolutely get you candy

4284
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
He only uses it to get people in his car

4285
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
Not his house, in the van

4286
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
You don't have a van yet

4287
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
That's what you think

4288
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
Can I have a bite?

4289
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
That's the perfect alibi right there too

4290
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
I don't have a van, what are you talking about?

4291
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Alright, that does it for the FUs of the Week

4292
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Let's get to some more stories and then

4293
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
We are not that far away from the Skype line

4294
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
I'm excited to talk to some folks tonight

4295
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
I hope we get calls tonight

4296
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
1877 Game OLR

4297
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Or I use the name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio

4298
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
But first, a couple stories for you

4299
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Sadly we missed a wonderful transition that we would have had

4300
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Had we gone into the story straight from the mailbag

4301
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
But, you know, whatever

4302
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
So hey, in case you need some more information

4303
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
About which system you should buy

4304
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
For the next generation

4305
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Pornhub would let you know

4306
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
That hey, they're fully supporting

4307
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
The Playstation 4

4308
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
And you'll be able to view Pornhub

4309
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
And all of its video content

4310
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Through the Playstation 4's web browser

4311
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Nice

4312
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
So that's why I was joking

4313
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Does Pornhub offer the freaky porn though?

4314
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
I only like the really crazy stuff

4315
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
I will never forget that New Years

4316
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
It was like 2007 or something

4317
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
With the pterodactyl porn on the Wii

4318
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
That was the most hilarious thing I've ever seen in my life

4319
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
That is a good question

4320
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
One that we should just look up the answer to

4321
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
Why not?

4322
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
You have to do some research here

4323
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
It's, you know, it's strange

4324
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
But let's see

4325
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Dinosaur

4326
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Hey, that's weird that that came up as a recommended

4327
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Yes, it has dinosaur porn on there

4328
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
So you are all set

4329
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Dinosaurs? Like the old ABC sitcom?

4330
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
Dinosaurs as in like CG dinosaurs

4331
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
And they even

4332
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
And

4333
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
And someone that's dressed in green

4334
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
I don't know

4335
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
But yes, they do have dinosaur

4336
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
Pornography

4337
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
You'll be happy to know

4338
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Alright, anyway

4339
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Very happy to hear that

4340
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Congratulations Playstation 4 for

4341
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
Definitively winning the console wars with that

4342
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Although, we all know

4343
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
If there's any way to do it

4344
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Pornhub will also show up on Xbox One

4345
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
Of course, well it is Internet Explorer

4346
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
It'll have to happen

4347
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
But here's the thing

4348
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
I always bring triple X rated

4349
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
Video

4350
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
To the actual web stores

4351
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Like I can go rent a copy of

4352
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
You know, the Dark Knight

4353
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
Returns or

4354
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
The Dark Knight bones some chick

4355
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
In the ass too

4356
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
You know, that's

4357
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
That's how you win the console wars right there

4358
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
Alright, speaking of vulgarities

4359
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Did you know that South Park

4360
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
Is still on the air? It's in its 17th

4361
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Season

4362
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
South Park is kind of hit and miss these days

4363
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
It's still worth watching once in a while

4364
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
Especially this past week

4365
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
And I actually watched this episode

4366
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
A friend of mine alerted me to the fact that

4367
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
The latest South Park episode was about the

4368
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Playstation 4 and Xbox One

4369
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
Console wars

4370
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
They kind of put a Game of Thrones parody into it too

4371
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
It also looks very much like

4372
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
It does

4373
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
Look like their game which made it funny

4374
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Because there was a part where they totally

4375
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
Shade the fact that their game got delayed

4376
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Like something about

4377
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Someone says, who wants to sit around and wait for a stupid

4378
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
Game, a game that's not even that good

4379
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Oh, then they slam the pre-order

4380
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
Thing, that's what it was, they say like

4381
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
You know, pre-orders are just

4382
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
The way of them dicking you over every time

4383
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Like they go

4384
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
The five dollars you spend on a pre-order

4385
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Is just going to some guy who hasn't even

4386
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Finished the game yet and da da da, like that was the

4387
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
Part, I'm totally not doing it justice

4388
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
Sorry, I don't have it queued up right now

4389
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
But it was worth watching

4390
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
I lulled a couple times

4391
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
I think it's going to be a two-parter

4392
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
Because it didn't really, the ending wasn't really

4393
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
An ending, so

4394
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
It makes sense because they have both consoles coming out

4395
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
Yeah, I'm curious to see if maybe they're going to end it after the

4396
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Consoles actually come out, I don't know

4397
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
Yes, they actually

4398
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Split up and choose a side and it's

4399
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Going to be Playstation 4 fans

4400
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Versus Xbox One fans

4401
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
And an epic throw down at the mall

4402
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
And they're actually recruiting other clicks for their side

4403
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Like I think the Sony click had

4404
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
Kyle in it

4405
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
And they recruited the Goth kids

4406
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
I thought they were trying to recruit them

4407
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
But it didn't work, I don't know

4408
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
I don't know, this is way

4409
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Too much seriousness for an episode of South Park

4410
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
But it's always fun to see

4411
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
This whole stuff get kind of made fun of

4412
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
In the media, who better to make fun of it

4413
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
Than South Park

4414
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
By the way, if you do want to watch the whole episode

4415
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
And actually get the quote that I butchered

4416
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
South Park Studios

4417
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
Has the full episode

4418
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
And Dark Tetsuya in our chat room

4419
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
Says they did confirm on Facebook

4420
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Part 2 is this coming week

4421
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
So there will be a

4422
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
Part 2, so check that out

4423
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
Jean asks, was Wii U ignored?

4424
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
Of course, of course it was ignored

4425
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
Just like real life

4426
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
This is next gen wars

4427
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Well

4428
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
Maybe that'll be the twist in the second part

4429
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
Is that they all come together and buy Wii Us

4430
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
I doubt it

4431
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
I highly doubt it

4432
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
I don't think so

4433
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
Alright

4434
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
That's it for stories

4435
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
So I think we can open up the Skype line now

4436
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
1877 Game OLR

4437
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
Or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio

4438
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
If you'd like to give us a call on Skype

4439
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
The Skype line is open

4440
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
And in the meantime

4441
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
We can go to some Twitter topics

4442
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
I know we had a few good ones tonight

4443
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Also, last minute stories

4444
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
Loki, I don't know if you had any last minute stories

4445
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
No

4446
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
I was gonna mention that there's this teaser site

4447
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Now it's the Survivor

4448
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
2299

4449
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
That people are thinking might be for Fallout

4450
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
Originally it was thought

4451
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Oh, maybe it's a fan site because it wasn't registered

4452
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
To the usual Bethesda stuff

4453
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
However, Bethesda

4454
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
Just recently trademarked

4455
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
Fallout 4

4456
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
And also the timing kinda

4457
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
Coincides with the Spike

4458
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
VGX stuff

4459
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Oh lordy

4460
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
Expect an announcement maybe in December

4461
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
Most likely, let's go to the phones

4462
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
They're lighting up now, we shouldn't have a problem with calls tonight

4463
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

4464
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
This is Codeman

4465
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
Hey Codeman, how you doing? What's up?

4466
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
Not much, I got some candy here waiting for you

4467
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
I learned that you like

4468
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
Freaky porn on this episode

4469
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
That was kinda weird

4470
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
Freaky porn makes it sound like

4471
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
I'm like this lecherous creepy

4472
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
dude that lives in a basement

4473
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
There's a tonki punch video where they actually dress up

4474
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
Like a donkey, that's funny

4475
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
I like funny porn, Codeman

4476
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
My favorite are the parodies

4477
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
Have you seen the Batman ones?

4478
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
The Batman ones are great because

4479
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
They do it sort of the old

4480
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
Adam West style Batman

4481
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
But it's with the actual

4482
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
characters from now on

4483
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
I think the last one I saw was a parody of Lord of the Rings

4484
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
It literally had a bunch of midgets

4485
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
I remember when you invited me over

4486
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
To see Ali McFeel

4487
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
Ron Jeremy was actually in that

4488
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
And for the record

4489
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
The last one I watched was the Mork and Mindy one

4490
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:06,000
I wanted to see the one that was called

4491
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
This Ain't Glee

4492
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
Because now they don't even bother

4493
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
They just say, this ain't whatever

4494
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
Oh wait, I did see another one

4495
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
More recent, I saw Nalen Palin

4496
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
Which is hilarious

4497
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
I know you must have seen

4498
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
Not the Cosby's because we were so fascinated

4499
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
We were so fascinated by the guy

4500
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
The guy that played Bill Cosby

4501
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
In there

4502
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
He never got into any of the scenes

4503
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
But his impression was fantastic

4504
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
And that was the part

4505
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
It was like, we don't give a shit about the porn

4506
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
His impression was just dead on

4507
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
It was hilarious

4508
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
Codeman, I don't know if you actually called to talk about porn

4509
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
But clearly we could do that all night

4510
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
But what's on your mind, buddy?

4511
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
It's all porn and orange lounge radio tonight

4512
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
Orange lounge radio?

4513
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
No, I haven't called in a while

4514
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
I haven't called in a while actually

4515
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
I've been pretty busy with life

4516
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
I guess you could say

4517
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
But no, I just figured I was up tonight

4518
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
And figured I'd call in and just talk

4519
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
PS4, because I

4520
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
I cancelled my pre-order like you did, Rob

4521
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
I'm glad I'm not alone

4522
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
Would you give out your Twitter on the show

4523
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
So that the people that are about to

4524
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
Send me angry tweets after tonight's episode

4525
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
Can send them to you too?

4526
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Yeah, it's Codeman Games

4527
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Look it up

4528
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
But I will tell you

4529
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Xtifer

4530
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
I've been keeping up with his

4531
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
He posted, I think, a RezaGun

4532
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
On Facebook

4533
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
And I'm just like

4534
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
I'm seeing all these videos and I'm like

4535
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
God

4536
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
I should have kept it

4537
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
That's the exact same thing I've been doing

4538
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
And you know what that means

4539
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
All that social media shit that Sony

4540
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
Infused into its console is working

4541
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
This is exactly what they want people to do

4542
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Actually, for me, it's the opposite

4543
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
Another video of the stupid robot

4544
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
I've already seen that

4545
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
I know what it looks like

4546
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Well, it's just

4547
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
You see all this stuff and you

4548
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
Cancel it because you know, okay

4549
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
I kind of go with the same thing

4550
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
A console is good at what

4551
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
Games are on them

4552
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
But then you see all these people playing it

4553
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
And you just get this feeling of

4554
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
God, I need this because it's new

4555
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
It's different

4556
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
In a sense, and so you get to this point where you're like

4557
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
Oh my God, I just need this console

4558
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
But you know you have other

4559
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
Things to do and you can't spend that much money

4560
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
On something, but you're just like, oh my God

4561
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
I need it, but at the time, I had the money

4562
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
And I was like, okay, well I have the

4563
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Pre-order, I'm going to get it and all this stuff

4564
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
And I got to the point where I was just like

4565
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
You know what, there's just no games that are selling

4566
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
The system for me right now

4567
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
About the only thing that was

4568
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
Selling was the RezaGun

4569
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
I wanted to check out

4570
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
What was the

4571
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
What was the little

4572
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
With the little guys

4573
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
And the

4574
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
Playroom? No, not the Playroom

4575
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
It starts with a K

4576
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
Knack

4577
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
I wanted to play Knack because I played

4578
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
A demo of it at Target and I thought it was kind of fun

4579
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
I've heard it's kind of repetitive, but at the same time

4580
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
I don't really care

4581
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
I felt fun when I played it

4582
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
And the controller just felt so

4583
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
Amazing when I played it

4584
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
It's like, oh my God, I should have got one of these

4585
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
But I do have to make a confession

4586
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
I did

4587
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
Sell my Xbox 360

4588
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
And got like

4589
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
Well, and some games and got like

4590
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
300 something dollars for it, so

4591
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
That will be going towards a PS4

4592
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
So I probably will be getting one

4593
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
How about the old and the new and the new?

4594
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
I got some extra systems at my

4595
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
Office that I'm not using, I might as well

4596
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
Just take those in

4597
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
You know, I'm not a big advocate

4598
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
Of the evil G, but today they had

4599
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
A 90% trade-in

4600
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
Value on console, so I was just like

4601
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
Oh wow, why not?

4602
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
Oh dang, I wish I had known that

4603
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
I might have done that

4604
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
Alan and I actually have two

4605
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
Because, you know, when we got together and moved in

4606
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
Together, we both had 360s and PlayStation 3s

4607
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
So we have two PlayStation 3s and two

4608
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Xbox 360s and there's really no reason for us

4609
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
To do that, so we really should sell my

4610
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
Systems because they're the older ones

4611
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
And keep Alan's

4612
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
Oh well, maybe they'll do something like that again

4613
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
Although yes, I'm with you, I really don't like

4614
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
The evil G, but if they're willing to give me a lot of money

4615
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
I can cross picket lines

4616
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
We've got extra

4617
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Systems lying around

4618
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
Why not?

4619
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
And also, lastly, before I go

4620
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
I wanted to tell you guys about a game I've been

4621
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
Playing that I think kind of fell under

4622
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
The radar a little bit because I don't think

4623
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
A lot of people play this game anymore, but maybe

4624
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
They do, I don't know, but the Ratchet and Clank

4625
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
The new Ratchet and Clank game that just came out

4626
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
It's like super fun

4627
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
It's the first full length type

4628
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
I guess Ratchet and Clank that they released

4629
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
Because they released the All For One

4630
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
Which is like the multiplayer, which kind of

4631
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
Wasn't that good, and then they released

4632
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
A full frontal assault

4633
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
Which was the

4634
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
It was like a tower defense Ratchet and Clank

4635
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
But this one that they just released

4636
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
Into the Nexus was fantastic

4637
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
And I'm playing it right now

4638
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
And I actually, with the game

4639
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Got a

4640
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
A code for a downloadable

4641
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
Game for the Quest for Booty game

4642
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
Which was like the first downloadable

4643
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Game that they released or whatever

4644
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
And I'm willing to give it to

4645
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
Somebody in chat if they want it because

4646
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
I already own it

4647
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
But I have a free

4648
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Code here, so if anybody in chat likes

4649
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
The Ratchet and Clank games and they

4650
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Don't own this game

4651
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
It's really fun, it was a full length downloadable

4652
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Ratchet and Clank game, it's all like pirate themed

4653
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
And stuff, so

4654
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
So if you, anybody

4655
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
The first person to

4656
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
Direct message me in chat

4657
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
Maybe, I want it, I wish you told me

4658
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
I want it, no it's fine, give it to a listener

4659
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
Do you want it Rob?

4660
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
Of course, no no, give it to a listener, I have so many games to play

4661
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
I'll never get around to it, give it to a listener

4662
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
Who will actually play it

4663
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
Alright cool, and welcome back guys

4664
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
After a week of being off

4665
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
Thank you, appreciate it

4666
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
One more thing I just want to leave you with is that

4667
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
You're not the first to talk about porn here on Orange

4668
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
Radio, you need to go back in the archives

4669
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
On the OL archive or whatever

4670
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
And find the episode where we did review

4671
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
And we watched live on air

4672
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
Because our show was a lot different back in the early days

4673
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
We actually watched live on air

4674
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
Final Fuck X, which I still have

4675
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
Somewhere, and Dance Dance

4676
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
Fuck

4677
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
Where some Japanese

4678
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
Where some Japanese porn we

4679
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
Watched, and for the record

4680
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
All Final Fuck X's is

4681
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
Really good cosplay with fucking

4682
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
I remember I was looking for Dance Dance Revolution

4683
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
Like stuff, like games on eBay

4684
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
And I'm like, hey what's this?

4685
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
I gotta buy that

4686
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
Dance Dance Fuck has nothing to do with the games

4687
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
So it just, which was hilarious

4688
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
So, anyway

4689
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
I'm just gonna have to channel my inner Shane on this one

4690
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
And go, I don't care

4691
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
Alright, well said

4692
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
Alright, take care buddy

4693
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
Alright Rob, everybody

4694
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
Thanks for the call

4695
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
I will talk to y'all later

4696
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
Alright, that was a good call

4697
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype

4698
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
Is OrangeLoungeRadio

4699
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
I wanna do some quick Twitter topics while we wait for another call

4700
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
Tigerclaw tweets us

4701
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
And says, Mortal Kombat producer

4702
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
Hector Sanchez leaves NetherRealm Studios

4703
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
That's right, I did see this

4704
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
Coming out today

4705
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
That one of the guys over there at NetherRealm did leave the company

4706
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
As of I think yesterday

4707
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
Was his departure, no word yet where he

4708
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Went, but obviously he was a big

4709
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
Part of not only the new Mortal Kombat

4710
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
But Injustice, so

4711
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
Very interesting to see him

4712
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
Take another job somewhere

4713
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
So let's go to the phones and go to another call

4714
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

4715
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
Hi, this is Def

4716
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
I see your picture has changed

4717
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
It's a little, is that your new Wii U?

4718
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
It's a Kirby

4719
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
Yeah, it's the screen of my Wii U

4720
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
It's actually a video

4721
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
Of it

4722
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Oh, it's live video

4723
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Oh, no wonder I hear myself echoing a little bit

4724
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
Oh yeah, I can see the pixels

4725
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
Oh, there it goes

4726
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
Alright, it is live video

4727
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
Nice, love that

4728
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
Even though I'm hearing myself echo

4729
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
But that's okay, what's on your mind buddy?

4730
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
Basically

4731
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
Sorry

4732
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
I was gonna talk about

4733
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
Basically

4734
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Or ask you

4735
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Why do people still

4736
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
Say that Nintendo is gonna

4737
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
Be in ruins

4738
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
I don't know

4739
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
Lucky, why do people say

4740
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
Nintendo is gonna be in ruins

4741
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
It's doom and gloom, doom and gloom

4742
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
It's just because the Wii U is not selling well

4743
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
So they assume that because the Wii U is not selling well

4744
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
That Nintendo doesn't have anything else

4745
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
That they're selling that's not doing well

4746
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
Except

4747
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
They have this thing called the 3DS

4748
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
That seems to sell like crazy

4749
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
I don't know, I don't think they're in ruins

4750
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
But as far as getting the platform

4751
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
Of Wii U

4752
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
Ehhhh, that's not

4753
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
Doing so hot

4754
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
That's about it

4755
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
And actually right now they don't really have any

4756
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
EA games

4757
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
At all, and there's nothing on the slate for next year

4758
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
So that's gonna hurt

4759
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
Well to paraphrase something

4760
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
That someone very aptly put on

4761
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
The tumblers

4762
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
The Virtual Boy

4763
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
Didn't tank it

4764
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
The Micro didn't tank it

4765
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
The 64DD didn't tank it

4766
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
So

4767
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
They're just not going to

4768
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
Recapture what

4769
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
Happened with the Wii

4770
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
I think the Wii set the bar so high

4771
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
It was such a successful console

4772
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
That expectations are very high

4773
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
Is the Wii U going to win

4774
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
This generation?

4775
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
Not likely, but never say never

4776
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
I mean, I think we also have to remember

4777
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
In the last generation

4778
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
PlayStation 3 didn't come out the gate too hot

4779
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
And PlayStation 3 took a while

4780
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
To turn around

4781
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
PlayStation 3 took a good two years

4782
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
And when did Little Big Planet

4783
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
Come out? Because that's when things really started

4784
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
Turning around for PlayStation 3

4785
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
That was almost two years into it, right?

4786
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
I think it was 2007, so it was a year after it came out

4787
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
I think it's still just

4788
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
A little too soon to write off

4789
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
Nintendo completely

4790
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
Are they having a bad day?

4791
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
Absolutely. Are they done?

4792
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
I don't think so. Are they going to be number one?

4793
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
Probably not

4794
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
I think it's going to be a little more even

4795
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
Steven across all three of them this time

4796
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
Because let's be real, last generation

4797
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
Nintendo blew the other two out of the water

4798
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
Whether you like it or not

4799
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
This time I don't think it's going to be

4800
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
I think Nintendo may actually be the one that lags behind a little bit

4801
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
But we'll see

4802
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
Xbox One's out next week

4803
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
We've got to see where things are at six months out

4804
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
We'll see

4805
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
But it's not over for Nintendo

4806
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
3DS will always keep them afloat

4807
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
And whatever else they've got up their sleeve

4808
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
It's going to be a Wii U next year

4809
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
It's going to sell systems

4810
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
Along with Super Smash Brothers

4811
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
Just wait

4812
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
But what about you Actif?

4813
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
You just bought a Wii U

4814
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
So what finally made you decide to take the plunge?

4815
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
Basically

4816
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
First of all, Super Mario 3D World

4817
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
It's

4818
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
Seeing the videos

4819
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
Over and over again

4820
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
It looks like it's going to be a pretty fun game to play

4821
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
And I really

4822
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
Wanted to play it

4823
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
As soon as it comes out

4824
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
So

4825
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
I pretty much wanted that

4826
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
And also

4827
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
I topped this with Bobby

4828
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
Rayman Legends

4829
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
Even though it's a multi-platform

4830
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
Game

4831
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
I still want it on the Wii U

4832
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
And it's even on sale right now

4833
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
On Steam for 20 bucks

4834
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
I want to purchase that

4835
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
But now that I have the Wii U

4836
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
I really

4837
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
Want to get it for this console

4838
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
So yeah

4839
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
Basically those are my two main reasons right now

4840
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
To get one

4841
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
And even then

4842
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
Something that you said on the beginning of the show

4843
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
It's like pretty much

4844
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
Right now Wii U

4845
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
Has the games

4846
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
Has at least

4847
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
More games to play

4848
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
Right now

4849
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
Since it has

4850
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
The

4851
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
Year

4852
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
Since it launched

4853
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
So yeah

4854
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
It already has

4855
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
A big library so it

4856
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
Doesn't have that many games

4857
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
Maybe to play but

4858
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
At least you have more of a selection

4859
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
Right now than the

4860
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
PS4 or even the

4861
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
Xbox One

4862
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
Even though there's not a lot of games on Wii U

4863
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
There will be some really great

4864
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
A-list titles on it

4865
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
That help keep the system afloat

4866
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
Which I'm not sure PS4 or Xbox One

4867
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
Has as much of right now anyway

4868
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
Alright

4869
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
Well Akdef, thanks so much for the call

4870
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
And enjoy your new Wii U, have fun

4871
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
Thanks

4872
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
Alright you're welcome, take care buddy, have a good night

4873
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
See ya

4874
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
1877 Game OLR

4875
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
Or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

4876
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
If you want to give us a call

4877
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
Guess what, nobody sent

4878
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
CodeMan a direct message for that code

4879
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
So he ended up giving it to me anyway

4880
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
Haha, suckers

4881
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
Alright

4882
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
Let's go to the phones one more time hopefully

4883
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype

4884
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
OrangeLoungeRadio

4885
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
While we wait for a call to come in

4886
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
There's a call coming in right now so let's go to it

4887
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
Hi on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

4888
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
It's Legend, Zaku here

4889
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
Hey Zaku buddy, how you doing?

4890
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
Long time no see

4891
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
What do you do?

4892
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
Nothing much, just shuffling between

4893
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
Battlefield 4 and GTA 5

4894
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
I love that you're calling in when you're in your

4895
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
camo shirt, I couldn't see you for a minute

4896
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
That's my PJ's

4897
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
What, what's that? Those are my PJ's

4898
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
I was going to say it kind of looked like a PJ top

4899
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
You call in when you're in your camo jammies

4900
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
To talk about Battlefield, so please by all means

4901
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
How is Battlefield?

4902
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
Well I haven't, to be honest I haven't

4903
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
gotten into the multiplayer yet

4904
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
Because I'm still, you know, it's always

4905
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
A thing of mine to always do single player first

4906
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
Then just jump into multiplayer

4907
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
Same thing I did for Battlefield 3

4908
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
But so far

4909
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
I mean, if you want single player

4910
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
It is kind of like very

4911
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
Cinematic

4912
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
But that's all I can say about it other than

4913
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
It looks like it's gonna

4914
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
It looks pretty short than the

4915
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
One for Battlefield 3

4916
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
But I'm hearing a lot of great things about

4917
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
Online, except of course when you

4918
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
Have people

4919
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
Crashing the servers maliciously

4920
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
Like what happened this weekend

4921
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
Yeah I heard about that, what's up with that?

4922
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
Did the DDoS

4923
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
Attacks go against

4924
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
Battlefield 4 today or something?

4925
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
Apparently from what I'm hearing

4926
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
When I'm glancing through Kotaku

4927
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
Right now

4928
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
Yeah they were getting

4929
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
They were basically getting hammered

4930
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
By denial of service, yeah they were getting

4931
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
DDoS'd

4932
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
I guess

4933
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
Now that the PS4 is out

4934
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
This kind of opens the floodgates

4935
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
Since most of the

4936
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
PS4 games will have dedicated servers

4937
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
Whether or not that will actually

4938
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
Translate over to consoles

4939
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
Assuming one can just

4940
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
Slightly sniff

4941
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
Outgoing packets

4942
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
Outgoing network packets

4943
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
To see if they can

4944
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
Find an IP to exploit

4945
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
I mean that's one way to do it

4946
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
You just snip the traffic

4947
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
Between the private dedicated

4948
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
Servers and the console and you might

4949
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
Be able to get some info

4950
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
Assuming it's not encrypted

4951
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
But if it is

4952
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
Then they're still a bit lucky

4953
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
I'm assuming you

4954
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
Did not jump on the PlayStation 4 bandwagon

4955
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
Did you, you've been doing that?

4956
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
Not yet, I still have a PS3 to go over

4957
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
As I said I still have GTA 5

4958
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
That I played yesterday, last night

4959
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
And I've been juggling

4960
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
Battlefield 4 so those are the two things

4961
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
Those two gaming things are going on right now

4962
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
So you're sitting out

4963
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
This new

4964
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
Consoles for a little bit too

4965
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
You're not planning on Xbox One either?

4966
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
Not yet, as I said I'd rather give it

4967
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
At least a couple of years

4968
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
Or until the prices start dropping

4969
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
I mean when I

4970
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
Got my Xbox two years after it came out

4971
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
That was the first

4972
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
The first 360

4973
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
And then after that

4974
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
That one crapped out and then I bought another

4975
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
But yeah, it was

4976
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
I waited at least two years before buying

4977
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
That current generation of

4978
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
Console

4979
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
And PS3 I got last year so

4980
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
Yeah

4981
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
Still juggling, but as I

4982
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
You know, I'd rather, it's not

4983
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
It's not really good to be an early adopter

4984
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
In this stage

4985
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
Especially for a new generation console

4986
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
Because you're pretty much dealt with

4987
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
What you have already and not

4988
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
What improvements Sony

4989
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
Or Microsoft will make on their hardware

4990
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
Yeah, but

4991
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
Other than having to deal with that aftermath initially

4992
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
I'd rather just see how they find

4993
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
How they flesh it out

4994
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
But you can be the cool kid on the block with your cool new toy

4995
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
You're the coolest kid in school

4996
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
Sure

4997
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
That is true, but

4998
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
I know it's $400

4999
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
That I could put to good use

5000
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
You know, like

5001
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
Buying myself a new video card

5002
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
Or basically getting

5003
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
Two terabyte hard drives

5004
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
I could set up on RAID so I could put all my

5005
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
Steam games and get a lot

5006
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
More of them so I don't max out my current drive

5007
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
Stuff like that, like putting stuff

5008
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
On my PC

5009
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
As opposed to the PS3 which I still

5010
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
Invest, but it's not as

5011
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
It's not as urgent as

5012
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
Something that's almost like reaching

5013
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
Two years old

5014
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
And I still need to get a new video card for it

5015
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
But other than that

5016
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
I mean, it's not like my

5017
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
My head is Seth Child called the 360

5018
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
Which I barely put anything

5019
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
Except for an Xbox Live membership earlier this year

5020
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,000
And that's it

5021
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000
Alright

5022
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
Well, Zaku, we're gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show

5023
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
But have fun with your Battlefield

5024
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
And get in that multiplayer and let us know how it is

5025
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,000
You know, when the servers work

5026
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:00,000
Maybe you guys do need to

5027
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000
Jump on it

5028
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
I'm certain there are Battlefield PC players

5029
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
The best argument

5030
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
I heard for playing Battlefield 4

5031
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
And Jamie, you'll appreciate this

5032
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
The best argument I heard for Battlefield 4 and playing it

5033
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,000
Is it's using the same engine the new Mass Effect

5034
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
Game's gonna be using

5035
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
Of course, it's Frostbite

5036
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,000
And you can actually do

5037
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,000
Countering knife attacks

5038
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
I don't hate shooters

5039
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
I'm so bad at them, Zaku

5040
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
I am so, so bad

5041
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
Do you want to play with a scrub?

5042
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,000
Do you want to?

5043
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
I will lower your team's

5044
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,000
Collective performance

5045
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
Other than that, I barely see VOG network on GTA Online

5046
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:40,000
What's up with that?

5047
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
I don't see many on the PS3

5048
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
I'm on all the time

5049
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,000
Except I'm on two different Sims

5050
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
Good day, though

5051
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
Can't you hit me up on a social club?

5052
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
Don't they have messaging systems?

5053
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
I have it through my phone now

5054
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
Because I'm not

5055
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
Doing my best to dodge, chop

5056
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,000
I put messages on there

5057
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
Are you friended on

5058
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
PlayStation Network with me?

5059
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
It's there

5060
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
My profile should have my PSN ID

5061
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
I'll even post it up right now

5062
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
After this call

5063
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
But yeah

5064
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
Hopefully

5065
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
OLR can get a VOG network

5066
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
Group on Origin for Battlefield

5067
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
3 and or 4

5068
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
Yeah

5069
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
That requires me to install Origin

5070
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
It's not that bad

5071
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
Oh my god

5072
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
I basically bit the bullet and did that

5073
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,000
Alright, Zaku

5074
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
I gotta wrap up

5075
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:40,000
We're running long

5076
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
Have a good one, buddy

5077
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
Thanks for the call

5078
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
I love it when we get the webcam calls

5079
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
It's always good to be able to see our people

5080
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
I should probably put a webcam on the computer

5081
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000
Just for Skype

5082
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
So that way when they call in

5083
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:56,000
I can remember the one I've been using

5084
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
For my drawing

5085
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,000
It's more incentive for people to call

5086
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:02,000
Microsoft would like to let you know

5087
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,000
That you can get your free Skype camera

5088
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,000
With the purchase of an Xbox One

5089
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
In the form of a Kinect

5090
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,000
I am so sorry, the phones are still lighting up

5091
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:12,000
I've gotta wrap up because we're running long

5092
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:14,000
We're 15 minutes past midnight on the East Coast

5093
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:16,000
I still have some Twitter topics

5094
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:18,000
So one of these is a really good question I want to get to

5095
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:20,000
So please, please tweet, email

5096
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,000
And we'll get to you guys in a later week, hopefully

5097
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:24,000
I want to get this tweet from

5098
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,000
ActDeaf who sent us a tweet

5099
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:28,000
This is something I totally missed from the Nintendo Direct

5100
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,000
I'm so sorry

5101
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,000
I get Kirby, how very dare I

5102
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:34,000
I'm mad at myself, y'all

5103
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,000
Kirby Triple Deluxe

5104
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,000
Will be coming out in Japan on

5105
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:40,000
January 11th

5106
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:42,000
And there's a teaser site for that

5107
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:44,000
Kirby Triple Deluxe

5108
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:46,000
Get it? Kirby 3D

5109
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:48,000
Get it?

5110
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,000
Oh my gosh

5111
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
Alright

5112
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,000
And one other question here

5113
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,000
That I really like this

5114
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
This is from AJ Twist

5115
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:00,000
So, in O.L.R.'s opinion

5116
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,000
Who won

5117
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:04,000
The last gen

5118
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,000
Console Wars?

5119
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,000
Dreamcast

5120
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,000
The dramas are still not over

5121
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:12,000
So, I mean, it's still going

5122
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:14,000
It's still going?

5123
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,000
Alright

5124
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,000
Define when, do you mean by sales

5125
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,000
Do you mean by units

5126
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
Specifically sold, do you mean

5127
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,000
By what country, do you mean by

5128
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:26,000
Gallup poll, I don't know

5129
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,000
I think the question is vague on purpose

5130
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
It's his opinion, in your opinion

5131
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
Who won

5132
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
My 3DS

5133
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:36,000
The 3DS won the last console

5134
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,000
I think that's a perfectly valid answer

5135
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
See, that's a console, not a handheld

5136
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
Ah, alright

5137
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,000
You know what I think won?

5138
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:46,000
My computer, the end

5139
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,000
PC's

5140
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
PC's won

5141
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,000
You know what, there's a lot of people

5142
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:54,000
There would be a lot of people in that camp

5143
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,000
It would be a home run with the Ouya

5144
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:58,000
I mean, the Ouya won the last gen console wars

5145
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:00,000
There's just no doubt about it

5146
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:02,000
No

5147
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,000
Loki, who won?

5148
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,000
Who won?

5149
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:08,000
Probably Xbox, just because they had

5150
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,000
A lot of units out there

5151
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:12,000
They still have the strongest support, I think

5152
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:14,000
From all third parties

5153
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,000
I mean, it's still going strong

5154
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:18,000
The Wii's gone

5155
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:20,000
I mean, the support for Wii U

5156
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:22,000
Is gone, and now it's Wii U

5157
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,000
So, they're in their own

5158
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
Gen, I guess

5159
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:28,000
It's the way they want to classify themselves because they can't compete

5160
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:30,000
With the Wii U now

5161
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
So, I think Xbox, but

5162
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:34,000
I mean, PlayStation 3 did turn it around

5163
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,000
And now they're selling

5164
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,000
Quite heavily, so that's

5165
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:40,000
Pretty neck and neck, I mean, it's not like

5166
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,000
One clear winner

5167
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:44,000
I think, it depends on your criteria

5168
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:46,000
I think, for me

5169
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:48,000
If you're going by sales, specifically

5170
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:50,000
Nintendo won, clearly

5171
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:52,000
Like it or not, love or hate what they brought to the table

5172
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:54,000
Just speaking by the numbers

5173
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:56,000
And no, that's not me being a fanboy

5174
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:58,000
I mean, Wii Sports is the

5175
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:00,000
Biggest video game of all time, period

5176
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:02,000
You can't dispute that

5177
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,000
But, the answer

5178
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:06,000
That was in my head

5179
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
Was actually something Bobby said in chat here

5180
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,000
Who said, who won? The gamers

5181
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:12,000
Absolutely believe it, the gamers won

5182
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,000
The last generation

5183
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,000
There's a lot of choice available out there now

5184
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:18,000
And more ways to

5185
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:20,000
Connect with each other, and our voices

5186
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:22,000
Are really having an impact

5187
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:24,000
For better or for worse

5188
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:28,000
And so, yeah, I think the gamers won

5189
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:30,000
Absolutely, if I had to pick a

5190
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:32,000
Company though, Netflix

5191
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:34,000
Won, big time

5192
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:36,000
Netflix won the last generation

5193
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,000
Huge, because

5194
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:40,000
That's what a lot of these gaming boxes are

5195
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:42,000
They're Netflix devices and so forth

5196
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:44,000
Gene in chat says

5197
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:46,000
Apple won, you know, that's

5198
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:48,000
Not a stretch

5199
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,000
It just depends on what you look at

5200
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,000
Alright, great tweet, great question

5201
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,000
Maybe we'll get some emails on that

5202
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:56,000
Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com

5203
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000
Again, sorry to the call

5204
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,000
So I didn't get through, but we do want to wrap up

5205
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:02,000
We are after

5206
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:04,000
9.15 on the west coast

5207
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:06,000
Which means it's 15 past midnight on the east coast

5208
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:08,000
So it is about time that we wrap up

5209
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:10,000
But before we say

5210
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,000
Goodnight for good, we gotta go around and get everybody's

5211
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:14,000
Final thought

5212
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:16,000
And I do want to also say one more time

5213
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:18,000
Thank you very much for downloading us

5214
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:20,000
Thank you for supporting independent radio

5215
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,000
You made it this far in the show

5216
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:24,000
I just, I really appreciate you guys' support of the show

5217
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:26,000
It's what keeps us motivated to do this

5218
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:28,000
I know we've had some very strong opinions

5219
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:30,000
And devil's advocate positions

5220
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:32,000
And things like that throughout the night

5221
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:34,000
So I really appreciate you guys that stick with the whole thing

5222
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:36,000
To listen to it

5223
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:38,000
If you do like what you hear, please tell a friend or two about the show

5224
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:40,000
Help spread the word

5225
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:42,000
We do do this show for free

5226
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,000
We do perform this show for free

5227
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:46,000
All we ask is help spread the word

5228
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:48,000
Help grow our family

5229
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:50,000
Get some more awesome people into our community

5230
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:52,000
It is so appreciated

5231
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:54,000
And support independent broadcasting

5232
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:56,000
There's so many great people that do this

5233
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,000
If you hated our show

5234
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:00,000
Yet you made it all this way

5235
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:02,000
There's probably some other indie shows out there

5236
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:04,000
That are for you

5237
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:06,000
So check them out

5238
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:08,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought

5239
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:10,000
Loki, we'll start with you, your final thought tonight

5240
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:12,000
I'm done with Cookie Clicker

5241
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:14,000
I'm done

5242
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:16,000
My 24 hour foray into Cookie Clicker

5243
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:18,000
Is now complete

5244
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:20,000
You divorced it, so it's done

5245
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:22,000
You're over it

5246
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:24,000
Party's over, get out

5247
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:26,000
My final thought tonight is

5248
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:28,000
That

5249
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:30,000
Game capture card I bought

5250
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:32,000
Really ended up being a waste of money

5251
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:34,000
Because I don't have a TV next to my PC

5252
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:36,000
Which means I need to buy a TV

5253
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:38,000
No, I need to buy a Playstation 4

5254
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:40,000
Which means you need to lend it to me

5255
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:42,000
No, I need to buy a 3DS XL

5256
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:44,000
I need to buy all the things

5257
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:46,000
But I'm broke

5258
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:48,000
You need a roof over your head

5259
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:50,000
Food in your stomach and water and shelter

5260
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:52,000
I already said shelter

5261
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:54,000
And fucking

5262
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:56,000
And sex

5263
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:58,000
And a kitty

5264
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,000
Dark Soccer

5265
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:02,000
Your final thought tonight

5266
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:04,000
I got up to go grab my shoes

5267
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:06,000
Because my feet were cold

5268
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:08,000
And um

5269
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:10,000
My legs hurt from doing squats

5270
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:12,000
I was walking like the hunched

5271
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:14,000
Back old woman

5272
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:16,000
And also tonight's cookie is fun

5273
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:18,000
Alright, that's it you guys

5274
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:20,000
Thank you very much for listening to our show

5275
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:22,000
And I was also going to say all you need to do is

5276
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:24,000
Get a really long HDMI cable

5277
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:26,000
And you're problem solved

5278
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:28,000
Maybe I will do that, that's a good idea

5279
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:30,000
Might as well instead of

5280
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:32,000
I didn't even think to get

5281
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:34,000
A 50 foot HD cable

5282
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:36,000
Just what we need in this apartment

5283
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:38,000
I don't know about 50 feet

5284
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:40,000
I don't remember how long it is

5285
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:42,000
You can make an HDMI cable before you have to have

5286
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:44,000
Some sort of signal booster

5287
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:46,000
You should be able to get at least 20 feet

5288
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:48,000
I think without having to do that

5289
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:50,000
And that should be enough

5290
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:52,000
Yay, just what we need, another big cable in the house

5291
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:54,000
Alan will be so happy

5292
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:56,000
Alright, he's cheering you live here

5293
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:58,000
Alright, that really is going to do it

5294
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:00,000
Thank you guys again for listening

5295
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:02,000
Well again, next week's not Thanksgiving right?

5296
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:04,000
No, that's two weeks

5297
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:06,000
But I'll have to bring over sweet potato latkes

5298
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:08,000
That are left over

5299
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:10,000
Oh my god

5300
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:12,000
It is the latke feast, the OLR latke feast

5301
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:14,000
We ate like a whole bag of those fucking latkes

5302
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:16,000
Last year, they're so good

5303
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:18,000
Well then maybe I'll bring jelly donuts

5304
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:20,000
Alright, that's it, we're done, we're out

5305
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:22,000
