00:00:14,517 --> 00:00:26,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo Kills Swapnode via SpotPass because children and penises Ubisoft turns tail and drops its passport system for Assassin's Creed and the Pocket Station rumors get stronger with an impending announcement this week All these plosives and more begin...

2
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:36,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:36,507 --> 00:00:41,010
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with this episode number 526 for November the 3rd, 2013.

4
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, we're in that start of November, which is that month when...

5
00:00:49,415 --> 00:00:50,136
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

6
00:01:08,331 --> 00:01:13,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, except for the day's just been so weird because of ye olde time change.

7
00:01:14,078 --> 00:01:18,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and to be honest, and just keeping it real, y'all, I'm a little hungover today.

8
00:01:18,523 --> 00:01:20,666
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm a little, I'm a little like dragging.

9
00:01:20,686 --> 00:01:22,388
[SPEAKER_03]: You look amazing for a hungover.

10
00:01:22,408 --> 00:01:25,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you.

11
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:26,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you enjoy the vodka presents?

12
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't partaken in the vodka presence.

13
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:36,276
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually was planning to drink during tonight's show, which I'm sure the listeners would have loved, but now that I'm... I kind of drank a lot last night.

14
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:39,437
[SPEAKER_03]: You should try a shot of it if you feel up to it later.

15
00:01:39,477 --> 00:01:39,837
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

16
00:01:39,897 --> 00:01:48,139
[SPEAKER_07]: If listeners, if y'all behave, and especially knowing that I don't have to get Alan after work now, he's on his way home right now, so I don't have to drive tonight at all, so I can be responsible.

17
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:57,686
[SPEAKER_07]: If listeners behave, I'll take a shot maybe at the beginning of part B. And the wine was already starting to get me to slur my words at the end of last week's show.

18
00:01:57,927 --> 00:02:02,030
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to get you a bottle of the Honey Run because that stuff was... I love that stuff.

19
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:03,551
[SPEAKER_03]: And you were funny.

20
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:06,734
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have to say, I just forgot what I was going to say.

21
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:09,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I'm drunk on coffee and high on life.

22
00:02:09,976 --> 00:02:10,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Woohoo!

23
00:02:10,896 --> 00:02:11,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

24
00:02:12,037 --> 00:02:14,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Also say hello to somebody else who I'm sure is high on life.

25
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

26
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,659
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually November is not a very busy month for games.

27
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:21,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Although there are a couple big games coming out.

28
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,961
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to be kidding.

29
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:22,861
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just thinking today.

30
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:23,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, oh my god.

31
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:26,942
[SPEAKER_07]: November 22nd is the day the Xbox One comes out, right?

32
00:02:27,062 --> 00:02:27,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

33
00:02:27,403 --> 00:02:27,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, okay.

34
00:02:27,943 --> 00:02:32,384
[SPEAKER_07]: On November 22nd, I've already bought at Best Buy and have to go pick up my Zelda 3DS.

35
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:34,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Mario 3D World Land View Week

36
00:02:51,035 --> 00:02:58,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but so are you going to count every single re-release of each of these games on different platforms as a separate title?

37
00:02:58,784 --> 00:02:59,805
[SPEAKER_08]: I suppose not.

38
00:03:00,025 --> 00:03:05,552
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just the same titles are just, oh, hey, one comes out one week, one comes out the other week, and whatever.

39
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:05,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

40
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:09,036
[SPEAKER_08]: So, really, you only have two major releases.

41
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:19,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Next-gen console and first-party games aside, you pretty much just have Call of Duty, Ending for Speed, and then, I guess, the Super Mario 3D World.

42
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:21,353
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's about it.

43
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:21,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, to be honest...

44
00:03:21,914 --> 00:03:22,734
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

45
00:03:38,563 --> 00:03:53,264
[SPEAKER_07]: 90% of the time solid as heck and all the good or all the kind of early previews and reviews on that thing are really positive so I don't think I have any reason not to be super excited about that game I'm more excited about that than anything I can think of on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One to be quite honest

46
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:56,287
[SPEAKER_08]: But the resolution that it played on the Xbox One was just terrible.

47
00:03:56,687 --> 00:04:08,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Zero, zero P. I mean, same with the PlayStation 4, zero P. Is that why the fan wank fantasy of Nintendo making Xbox One games can't come true because Xbox One wouldn't run it?

48
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:10,961
[SPEAKER_08]: I get no picture and sound at all.

49
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:16,386
[SPEAKER_08]: All it gets is a stupid error that comes on the screen and says this disc is not compatible or it's dirty or something.

50
00:04:16,406 --> 00:04:17,648
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't get it, but...

51
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:22,110
[SPEAKER_07]: To be real, I don't really need the Zelda 3DS XL.

52
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,091
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't need it.

53
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:23,651
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need it.

54
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:25,732
[SPEAKER_07]: And my money could be better spent on other things.

55
00:04:25,752 --> 00:04:30,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Spray paint the damn... But... If you buy it, you can sell me your old one for Dan.

56
00:04:31,368 --> 00:04:32,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Dan wants a 3DS?

57
00:04:32,869 --> 00:04:33,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he wants to play Zelda.

58
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Why doesn't he buy a Zelda 3DS?

59
00:04:36,391 --> 00:04:37,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I have no job.

60
00:04:38,032 --> 00:04:38,873
[SPEAKER_07]: What about a 2DS?

61
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:42,575
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a buyer earmarked right now, but if that falls through, certainly.

62
00:04:42,756 --> 00:04:43,816
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be a good thing.

63
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:48,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan, if you're listening to the show, which you're not, I'm not getting it for you at all.

64
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:48,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever.

65
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,500
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not.

66
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,080
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need it.

67
00:04:51,201 --> 00:05:13,985
[SPEAKER_07]: so uh yeah so it's uh anyway i just want that zelda 3ds because it looks so dang cool and i was so happy that it didn't end up being a gamestop exclusive and i can buy it at a bunch of other retailers so yeah i pre-ordered it at best buy because i just i don't know if it's going to be limited quantity or what and i just want to make sure i can yeah they're always limited launch like uh those pokemon 3ds xls they're gone they were gone after their first initial launch

68
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:42,402
[SPEAKER_07]: I still saw some on the shelf at Fry's yeah they probably bought a ton and didn't sell them but it's still they only do them one batch and that's it interesting alright well let's see I do want to also introduce our chat room live.vognetwork.com because of course we are the show where every gamer has a voice you guys join us in the chat room every week and we like to read some of the comments from the chat room let's see Actdeft saying I'm considering selling my Pikachu 3DS XL to get a Wii U

69
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,083
[SPEAKER_07]: It would certainly be a start.

70
00:05:45,183 --> 00:05:47,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Brad from PodCulture says, Sky, I'm such a sucker.

71
00:05:48,025 --> 00:05:52,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I ordered Injustice for the PlayStation 4, already imported it for PlayStation 3.

72
00:05:52,947 --> 00:05:57,229
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I mean, I know the reviews on that game were mixed, but you, Brad, really liked it.

73
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,511
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, if you like a game, then you like a game.

74
00:06:00,911 --> 00:06:04,333
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think there's anything wrong with getting it on multiple consoles if you truly enjoy a game.

75
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:05,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though it was freaking weird.

76
00:06:05,694 --> 00:06:07,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, but that's, you know, opinions.

77
00:06:07,555 --> 00:06:08,535
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I know.

78
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:11,157
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to give him a hard time over being a DC fanboy anyway.

79
00:06:11,177 --> 00:06:11,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

80
00:06:11,817 --> 00:06:12,137
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.

81
00:06:29,245 --> 00:06:33,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Xtifer, our buddy from Horde House, is in chat tonight and says, That's one thing about Nintendo.

82
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:37,712
[SPEAKER_07]: You can bet that all their games will always run and look amazing on their systems.

83
00:06:38,012 --> 00:06:41,875
[SPEAKER_07]: This is why Mario 3D World looks so much better than most other things.

84
00:06:42,675 --> 00:06:50,201
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if they knock it out of the park 100% of the time with their games, because sometimes there's some misfires, like what Steel Diver wasn't really the hottest 3DS game.

85
00:06:50,782 --> 00:06:54,625
[SPEAKER_07]: But not to totally dismiss your point, because...

86
00:06:55,405 --> 00:06:59,087
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of the biggest perks of Nintendo and one of the biggest drawbacks.

87
00:07:00,268 --> 00:07:01,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody does Nintendo better than Nintendo.

88
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:05,571
[SPEAKER_08]: The bar is not really set very high for Nintendo either.

89
00:07:06,672 --> 00:07:07,592
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm serious.

90
00:07:07,632 --> 00:07:11,295
[SPEAKER_08]: The type of game, though, it doesn't have to be that it's cartoony.

91
00:07:11,335 --> 00:07:12,976
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't have to be that realistic.

92
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:18,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, it's a lot easier for them because they're developing on one platform as opposed to multi-platform.

93
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:23,122
[SPEAKER_08]: That kind of goes with any first-party game that you're only going to have on one platform.

94
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:23,782
[SPEAKER_08]: It might look better.

95
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:35,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was going to say, SSJ100Matt was saying how many multiple copies of DDR do we have, except that they actually were kind of different from system to system and release to release, so it doesn't matter.

96
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:41,350
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just about to read that same comment and go, well, it's very similar to the Madden games every year.

97
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,751
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, DDR was a type of Madden game.

98
00:07:44,971 --> 00:07:46,232
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it was different.

99
00:07:46,272 --> 00:07:49,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that actually burned calories instead of making you put them on eating chips.

100
00:07:49,914 --> 00:07:52,455
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, but still, it was music instead of players.

101
00:07:52,595 --> 00:07:54,336
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all you had to change, though, was the music.

102
00:07:54,376 --> 00:07:55,557
[SPEAKER_08]: The music changed the whole game.

103
00:07:55,637 --> 00:08:07,263
[SPEAKER_08]: The game itself, it's like, that's like saying, well, hey, you know, Monopoly and, you know, another game that uses dice are exactly... Monopoly and Dungeons & Dragons are exactly the same because they use dice.

104
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:07,963
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, you know...

105
00:08:08,323 --> 00:08:13,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the whole point is that it's the content that makes the game, not the style.

106
00:08:13,248 --> 00:08:15,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, part of it is the content and the style.

107
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:23,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, to use the D&D analogy, you use the same method every time you play, but your content's different every time you play.

108
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:28,104
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same with DDR and same, I hope, with the sports ball stuff.

109
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:32,246
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, we're having a fun conversation here at the top of the show.

110
00:08:32,326 --> 00:08:36,928
[SPEAKER_07]: But I wanted to get into the official kickoff topic that I had earmarked for tonight before we get into our gaming weeks.

111
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:44,191
[SPEAKER_07]: And the kickoff topic I wanted to talk about tonight is, as I've mentioned in prior weeks on the show, we are not going to be here next week.

112
00:08:44,351 --> 00:08:46,252
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's kind of sort of because of BlizzCon.

113
00:08:46,412 --> 00:08:49,993
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be out of town, even though I'm technically not going to BlizzCon.

114
00:08:50,053 --> 00:08:53,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Long story, but I'm going to DizCon and some of the parties.

115
00:08:53,755 --> 00:08:54,295
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

116
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,096
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're not going to be here next week.

117
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,317
[SPEAKER_07]: So no show November 10th.

118
00:08:57,517 --> 00:08:57,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

119
00:08:58,537 --> 00:09:00,879
[SPEAKER_07]: But we will be back on November 17th.

120
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:07,786
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you think about it, when we're back with our first live show on November 17th, we will now live in a world that has a PlayStation 4 in it.

121
00:09:08,086 --> 00:09:10,908
[SPEAKER_07]: The next system for, you know, the next generation.

122
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:14,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I know some people may say Wii U is in there, but you know, well...

123
00:09:16,353 --> 00:09:43,174
[SPEAKER_07]: we all know Nintendo marches to the beat of their own drum right so you know okay yeah we use there but PlayStation 4 is like you know in Xbox One or like really kind of like that next level of power and graphics and so forth so this is really kind of the last episode of OLR to kind of put a cap on this generation now it's not that this generation is done because obviously there's still plenty of 360 and PlayStation 3 games to come

124
00:09:43,254 --> 00:09:45,775
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't kill your first child when you have your next child.

125
00:09:46,735 --> 00:09:53,037
[SPEAKER_07]: But, and there's even some speculation that this generation could continue if these new consoles tank, which is a possibility.

126
00:09:53,557 --> 00:09:59,078
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were going to use that analogy, I would just be like this great, great, great, great, great grandmother.

127
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,000
[SPEAKER_07]: But for most practical purposes, this generation is probably peaked.

128
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:09,521
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're in a unique situation here at OLR that when these consoles launched in, what, 2005, 2006, we were around.

129
00:10:12,222 --> 00:10:13,683
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

130
00:10:31,155 --> 00:10:32,735
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, you already take a mic to mouth.

131
00:10:32,795 --> 00:10:33,536
[SPEAKER_07]: What are your thoughts?

132
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm going to go with the Mass Effect series.

133
00:10:55,181 --> 00:10:57,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, all three of them together because they're a series.

134
00:10:57,862 --> 00:10:58,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

135
00:10:58,462 --> 00:10:59,682
[SPEAKER_07]: No surprise hearing this from you.

136
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I'm going to say this.

137
00:11:01,663 --> 00:11:07,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Specifically, it got me back into gaming this generation because I had my surgery.

138
00:11:07,925 --> 00:11:10,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a bunch of games and it was, I'm okay.

139
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:11,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is fun.

140
00:11:12,207 --> 00:11:12,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is neat.

141
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:14,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go back and play Puyo Puyo.

142
00:11:14,268 --> 00:11:18,349
[SPEAKER_03]: I always go back and play my old games because I'm a classic gamer.

143
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:18,890
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

144
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:27,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say that since picking up the series and getting into the story again, I've started checking out more and more new things as they've come out.

145
00:11:27,473 --> 00:11:29,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I've started looking at other companies that do similar things.

146
00:11:31,435 --> 00:11:37,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as opposed to the sucky things that Bioware has done, but companies that have similar types of titles.

147
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:39,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing Dragon Age.

148
00:11:39,338 --> 00:11:48,362
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been really expanding, and I think that it's just the first series that's been out that had so engaging a story that I really...

149
00:11:50,563 --> 00:11:51,803
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've used this quote before.

150
00:11:51,943 --> 00:11:55,385
[SPEAKER_03]: A friend of mine in Becky's has said it's the best movie I've ever played.

151
00:11:56,585 --> 00:11:59,487
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know how you go back and watch your favorite... How often have we seen Showgirls?

152
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:05,869
[SPEAKER_03]: But you go back and you watch your favorite show over and over even if part of it has sucked.

153
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you didn't like part of this story or thought this could have been better.

154
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:14,613
[SPEAKER_03]: You still go back and watch it if it's something that you love.

155
00:12:14,673 --> 00:12:16,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if it's the universe that you like.

156
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:33,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I had actually gotten pretty kind of bored with it for a little while and then I just went back and started over and I was like well you know what this is kind of fun again and started finding new things to enjoy and you know so I'm actually kind of getting back into it it's really funny but it was

157
00:12:34,526 --> 00:12:37,487
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, especially, you know, now I play it on PC, mind you.

158
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:42,069
[SPEAKER_03]: But it still goes in with the same generation.

159
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:46,571
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, my second choice is actually up there too.

160
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:48,632
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I can mention my second choice.

161
00:12:48,652 --> 00:12:49,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, of course.

162
00:12:49,613 --> 00:12:50,253
[SPEAKER_03]: The Portal series.

163
00:12:51,314 --> 00:13:00,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Portal and Portal 2 because those added in all kinds of different mechanics and made you use your brain as well as having just a delicious snarky humor in it that was...

164
00:13:01,498 --> 00:13:02,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.

165
00:13:03,461 --> 00:13:09,128
[SPEAKER_03]: But the big two things about both of those is that you also have this community built up around it.

166
00:13:09,228 --> 00:13:12,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate to use the word fandom, but it really is just that.

167
00:13:13,195 --> 00:13:17,217
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny that you bring up Portal because I'm looking at our chat room and of course we've got people naming their games.

168
00:13:17,377 --> 00:13:19,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft says the game that defined this generation, Portal.

169
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:30,704
[SPEAKER_07]: And definitely probably in my top five, I would have put the Orange Box as one of the defining games of this generation because it was such that immense value, but it also brought us Portal.

170
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:31,365
[SPEAKER_07]: It brought us...

171
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:38,006
[SPEAKER_07]: I think in many ways the Orange Box kind of set up Steam in a lot of ways.

172
00:13:38,046 --> 00:13:45,248
[SPEAKER_07]: And I realize Steam was around before, but I think a lot of people really got onto Steam in large part because of those Orange Box games.

173
00:13:45,288 --> 00:13:50,490
[SPEAKER_07]: And Steam has been, you know, I don't want to leave the PC and how they've been pacing alongside consoles out of this necessarily.

174
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,450
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think the Orange Box really heavily contributed.

175
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,691
[SPEAKER_07]: That would definitely be my top five.

176
00:13:54,711 --> 00:13:56,151
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not my number one, but yeah.

177
00:13:56,411 --> 00:14:00,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the point I was going back to with what I call them defining games.

178
00:14:01,253 --> 00:14:10,936
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, you do have, like you were just mentioning that side-by-side with PC, you're actually, with so much crossover between consoles and PC, you're expanding the fan base.

179
00:14:11,456 --> 00:14:17,958
[SPEAKER_03]: You are building an actual bigger community instead of this us-versus-them mentality that's existed forever.

180
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:20,399
[SPEAKER_03]: You've actually got both people playing these games.

181
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:25,481
[SPEAKER_03]: How often have I modded Becky's save files for Mass Effect 2 and 3?

182
00:14:26,101 --> 00:14:40,475
[SPEAKER_03]: plenty of times and you know you've got this level of crossover but it's when you've got people who are so invested in the story that they've expanded around it that I think that you've made you've really gotten a success story out of it

183
00:14:41,662 --> 00:14:42,942
[SPEAKER_07]: I was really considering.

184
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:44,744
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't going to say the Mass Effect.

185
00:14:45,404 --> 00:14:48,567
[SPEAKER_07]: I was really considering saying Mass Effect 3 is my game of the generation.

186
00:14:49,707 --> 00:14:52,189
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew you would say it, though, so I'm going to pick something else.

187
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:52,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

188
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,972
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know a lot of people would say, why not 2?

189
00:14:56,873 --> 00:14:58,454
[SPEAKER_07]: How could you pick 3 over 2?

190
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:04,438
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is where I go, well, it's not necessarily about the best, but it's about what defined this generation.

191
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:09,102
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think in a lot of ways, you know, Mass Effect 3 introduced the multiplayer element of it.

192
00:15:09,182 --> 00:15:09,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

193
00:15:09,582 --> 00:15:10,764
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to play again soon.

194
00:15:25,055 --> 00:15:28,016
[SPEAKER_07]: was definitely one of the more noteworthy things to happen.

195
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:29,116
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

196
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:37,799
[SPEAKER_07]: The way that the fans, in many ways, revolted against what they'd put out for the game was something you wouldn't have seen in previous generations.

197
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:45,542
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we all said around the time, Final Fantasy VII, thank God the internet wasn't out when people saw Final Fantasy VII's ending for the first time.

198
00:15:45,602 --> 00:15:46,902
[SPEAKER_07]: You probably would have seen something similar.

199
00:15:46,922 --> 00:15:48,222
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked the ending for that game.

200
00:15:50,063 --> 00:15:53,726
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that in many ways, for better or for worse, defined the generation.

201
00:15:53,946 --> 00:15:54,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

202
00:15:54,406 --> 00:15:57,629
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll save my pick for just a minute here.

203
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:01,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what do you think was the game that defined the generation for better or for worse?

204
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:07,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, well, here's kind of a weird take on it, but I'm going to say Saints Row the Third.

205
00:16:08,678 --> 00:16:11,680
[SPEAKER_08]: And, unfortunately... It's not just because it's you, though.

206
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,262
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, and hold on, let me explain.

207
00:16:15,322 --> 00:16:15,823
[SPEAKER_08]: It's deep.

208
00:16:15,963 --> 00:16:17,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Where every gamer has a voice.

209
00:16:17,524 --> 00:16:18,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Deep.

210
00:16:18,424 --> 00:16:18,804
[SPEAKER_08]: It's deep.

211
00:16:18,985 --> 00:16:19,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Saints Row deep.

212
00:16:20,165 --> 00:16:20,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

213
00:16:21,526 --> 00:16:24,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Watch, hold on, you'll understand in just a second.

214
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:25,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so here's why.

215
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:28,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Saints Row was a great series, and I really enjoyed it.

216
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:33,171
[SPEAKER_08]: And, I mean, pretty much the whole series has been in this generation so far.

217
00:16:33,631 --> 00:16:43,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the reason why third is most defining of this generation is because of all the business tactics that are being used in games nowadays.

218
00:16:43,973 --> 00:16:46,994
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of introduced a lot of these things, at least to that series.

219
00:16:47,414 --> 00:16:49,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, for example, on-disc DLC.

220
00:16:49,234 --> 00:16:50,815
[SPEAKER_08]: DLC whoring.

221
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:52,115
[SPEAKER_08]: DLC whoring.

222
00:16:52,615 --> 00:17:17,806
[SPEAKER_08]: really terrible DLC that they charge a lot of money for and you get very little content out of basically gutting what was a really good series and then turning it into some big monetization fest that is this generation of games it's basically something that you they've done so much to where you actually hate the series and yet you'll still buy it the next year that it comes out

223
00:17:18,866 --> 00:17:22,049
[SPEAKER_08]: That's basically this generation in gaming.

224
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,091
[SPEAKER_08]: You take the abuse and you still come back.

225
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:27,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Very interesting pick.

226
00:17:31,136 --> 00:17:33,338
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't really get around it.

227
00:17:33,378 --> 00:17:37,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I have two picks for the game of the generation, but one of them is not really a game.

228
00:17:37,081 --> 00:17:45,548
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me start with, and I know people are going to roll their eyes at this, but it really is, I think in many ways, the game that defined this generation for better or worse.

229
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,710
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe that game is Wii Fit.

230
00:17:49,707 --> 00:17:50,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Get Off Your Ass The Game?

231
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:52,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of.

232
00:17:53,168 --> 00:17:57,650
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that whole exergaming thing.

233
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, some might go, well, why not Wii Sports?

234
00:18:01,271 --> 00:18:04,212
[SPEAKER_07]: And believe me, I was thinking Wii Sports big time.

235
00:18:04,772 --> 00:18:14,456
[SPEAKER_07]: But I really was thinking about more Wii Fit, how that really took what Wii Sports did for the whole get up off your butt and move gaming and really push that forward.

236
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:16,817
[SPEAKER_07]: And really for the first time,

237
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:24,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't make video games look like something for lazy people And I think that was a very important turning point in this generation But DDR didn't?

238
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:32,280
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR didn't catch on the way Wii Fit did Because Konami didn't believe in it the way Nintendo did Whether we like it or not Good point

239
00:18:34,657 --> 00:19:00,500
[SPEAKER_07]: I think when Nintendo really pushing Wii Fit and really getting it out there I think they really brought this counterbalance and moved the Wiis and exercise gaming altogether into the commonplace soccer moms were eating it up retirement homes, grandmas were playing video games and this was like a huge thing

240
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:01,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I have another one, by the way.

241
00:19:03,313 --> 00:19:06,756
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't just have one because it's hard to define a whole generation of that.

242
00:19:07,097 --> 00:19:10,099
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, this is not going to grant the thought of five again because that's just too easy.

243
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:15,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Minecraft is another example of a thing that defines a generation.

244
00:19:15,965 --> 00:19:17,846
[SPEAKER_08]: You have an indie game that just goes...

245
00:19:19,267 --> 00:19:19,587
[SPEAKER_08]: and so on.

246
00:19:39,734 --> 00:19:42,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, these indie games can actually be very good.

247
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:49,077
[SPEAKER_08]: And now you're seeing a lot more focus on indie titles and stuff that's not coming from a big publisher or developer.

248
00:19:49,257 --> 00:19:51,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that and the genre of sandbox games in general.

249
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:53,719
[SPEAKER_08]: That's been around forever.

250
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,699
[SPEAKER_08]: But yes, definitely.

251
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:59,061
[SPEAKER_03]: But it really brought that back up into the limelight.

252
00:19:59,441 --> 00:19:59,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

253
00:20:00,321 --> 00:20:07,424
[SPEAKER_07]: My other pick for the game, and I'm using my quotey fingers, that define this generation of games is Netflix.

254
00:20:07,444 --> 00:20:07,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

255
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't expect that, but yeah.

256
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:37,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at my house.

257
00:20:38,893 --> 00:20:41,795
[SPEAKER_03]: But we had a dedicated computer set up just for that.

258
00:20:42,155 --> 00:20:43,455
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't need to use any of that.

259
00:20:43,516 --> 00:20:44,696
[SPEAKER_07]: But admittedly, you're different.

260
00:20:45,216 --> 00:20:48,778
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, again, I'm thinking about the soccer mom families and so forth.

261
00:20:48,858 --> 00:20:54,341
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, really, there's people that go out there and buy Wii's because they're cheap Netflix boxes.

262
00:20:56,282 --> 00:20:57,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there is that.

263
00:20:57,163 --> 00:21:04,547
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's for the same reason that people bought PS3's or PS2's because of them being a DVD player and the Blu-ray player for PS3, so...

264
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:21,675
[SPEAKER_07]: and one of the games one of the other games I would throw out there and then we'll change topics here I want to get into news stories one of the other games that really define the generation and you know I say for better or for worse and in this case it's definitely for worse I think Farmville

265
00:21:23,596 --> 00:21:24,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I just verped a bit.

266
00:21:25,357 --> 00:21:30,978
[SPEAKER_07]: But whether you like it or not, mobile and Facebook gaming has become bigger and bigger lately.

267
00:21:31,258 --> 00:21:34,539
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, it's the whole fact that it gets these people to play games.

268
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:37,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Not just play them, but obsess over them.

269
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Like grandma's going out of town because she's going on a cruise for a week.

270
00:21:42,221 --> 00:21:46,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Can somebody watch her farm so her freaking cows don't die or whatever it is.

271
00:21:46,462 --> 00:21:47,183
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my mother.

272
00:21:47,843 --> 00:21:48,083
[SPEAKER_07]: See?

273
00:21:49,181 --> 00:21:49,902
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

274
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:08,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, SSJ100Matt says Angry Birds also, definitely for those same reasons.

275
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:12,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Extover says I think Wii Sports would be more defining than Wii Fit to be honest.

276
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,535
[SPEAKER_07]: It really was the defining moment for all motion control games.

277
00:22:16,496 --> 00:22:21,262
[SPEAKER_07]: I do agree to a point Extover and I think Wii Sports, you know, obviously was, well it was

278
00:22:21,963 --> 00:22:25,745
[SPEAKER_07]: The biggest game this generation as far as sales go, you know.

279
00:22:26,005 --> 00:22:30,927
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think Wii Fit really took what Wii Sports started and just kind of put an exclamation point on it.

280
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:32,608
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's kind of why I said Wii Fit.

281
00:22:32,968 --> 00:22:37,730
[SPEAKER_07]: And especially you start to look at how the connect and the move really got a piece of that.

282
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,971
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a lot more the exercise gaming and all that.

283
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,052
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, look at all those games that come out.

284
00:22:41,072 --> 00:22:42,072
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all exercise games.

285
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,053
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anyway.

286
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:50,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiger Claw says two words, Horse Armor, which, you know, definitely Skyrim, I think is a game of the generation in some ways.

287
00:22:51,381 --> 00:22:55,906
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of people, you know, that can play that game and only that game and never anything but that game.

288
00:22:56,086 --> 00:22:58,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't think that Skyrim brought anything really new.

289
00:22:58,803 --> 00:23:03,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Tal says, or maybe that's Tal, sorry if I'm mispronouncing that, says at least no one mentioned Journey.

290
00:23:04,307 --> 00:23:07,029
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Journey is a pretty incredible game though.

291
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:11,813
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just, Journey kind of stands on its own.

292
00:23:12,874 --> 00:23:16,937
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we've yet seen how Journey has inspired other games yet.

293
00:23:17,957 --> 00:23:19,819
[SPEAKER_07]: But that might be coming in the next generation.

294
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:24,062
[SPEAKER_07]: But Journey, I think Journey was an amazing game and one of the best of the generation.

295
00:23:24,502 --> 00:23:26,484
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know if it necessarily defined it.

296
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of the difference there.

297
00:23:29,093 --> 00:23:41,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if it had to be something that added definition to this generation of gaming, I would say that it brought back an artistic element that had been missing.

298
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Call of Duty Modern Warfare.

299
00:23:43,842 --> 00:23:44,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

300
00:23:44,582 --> 00:23:50,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it basically steamrolled the franchise that they have now.

301
00:23:51,566 --> 00:23:53,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Then there was that whole divorce after that, right?

302
00:23:53,908 --> 00:23:55,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Or was that Modern Warfare 2 that was after that?

303
00:23:56,069 --> 00:23:57,690
[SPEAKER_08]: That was after Modern Warfare 2, I think.

304
00:23:58,547 --> 00:24:00,749
[SPEAKER_07]: One more comment here and then I'll switch topics here.

305
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:05,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Extover says, for me, The Last of Us is the epitome of the defining game of this generation.

306
00:24:05,992 --> 00:24:08,934
[SPEAKER_07]: To me, it was this generation's series finale.

307
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:11,996
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an interesting analogy there.

308
00:24:12,997 --> 00:24:14,378
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I can see that.

309
00:24:14,418 --> 00:24:15,959
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've wanted to play the game.

310
00:24:15,999 --> 00:24:16,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played it yet.

311
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,663
[SPEAKER_03]: But for everything that I've seen come up around it, I'd have to agree with that.

312
00:24:21,683 --> 00:24:23,984
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sort of like the cherry on top of the sundae.

313
00:24:24,885 --> 00:24:27,727
[SPEAKER_07]: I do like that analogy that it's the series finale.

314
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,769
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a neat way of putting it.

315
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:32,091
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we wake up and it's Bob Newhart in his bed.

316
00:24:32,932 --> 00:24:33,692
[SPEAKER_07]: It was all a dream.

317
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:34,413
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

318
00:24:34,854 --> 00:24:38,117
[SPEAKER_07]: How about the news that defined this generation?

319
00:24:38,717 --> 00:24:44,563
[SPEAKER_07]: You might really have to rack your brain a little bit, but what do you think was the news story that really defined this generation?

320
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say it was a series of news stories.

321
00:24:46,705 --> 00:24:50,468
[SPEAKER_07]: There might be more than one that you can think of, but something off the top of your head.

322
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:52,030
[SPEAKER_07]: And I ask this to Chad as well.

323
00:24:52,967 --> 00:24:58,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm really going to go with a series of them because they all go back to the same thing.

324
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:05,718
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all the stupid, violence-blaming video games, which we've got psychological studies proving the exact opposite.

325
00:25:05,758 --> 00:25:11,102
[SPEAKER_03]: We have statistics showing that crime has decreased since the... When did the Nintendo come out?

326
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:11,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it 91, 90?

327
00:25:11,363 --> 00:25:11,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

328
00:25:13,244 --> 00:25:14,865
[SPEAKER_03]: The original Nintendo?

329
00:25:15,065 --> 00:25:15,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

330
00:25:15,325 --> 00:25:15,165
85.

331
00:25:15,345 --> 00:25:16,406
[SPEAKER_03]: 85.

332
00:25:15,425 --> 00:25:16,406
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why I was saying that.

333
00:25:16,546 --> 00:25:17,166
[SPEAKER_03]: The Super Nintendo.

334
00:25:17,206 --> 00:25:18,607
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you said Super Nintendo was 1991.

335
00:25:19,027 --> 00:25:26,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we've had a decrease in armed crime amongst youth over the last 20, 30 years.

336
00:25:28,692 --> 00:25:32,054
[SPEAKER_03]: But they still go back and try to do this as scapegoat.

337
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:35,396
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still turning into this misunderstood thing.

338
00:25:35,896 --> 00:25:36,957
[SPEAKER_03]: When in reality...

339
00:25:37,757 --> 00:25:38,479
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

340
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, any thoughts?

341
00:25:51,281 --> 00:25:53,223
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a tough question, especially live.

342
00:25:53,423 --> 00:25:55,184
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't even remember what happened last year.

343
00:25:56,024 --> 00:26:02,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you guys, I seriously told Loki and DarkSakura like five minutes before the show what was going to come up, as usually happens here in the world of live radio.

344
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm just trying to think of stuff.

345
00:26:05,209 --> 00:26:09,272
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's the PlayStation Network hacking thing.

346
00:26:09,352 --> 00:26:10,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Since you brought it up, that was my number one.

347
00:26:10,993 --> 00:26:12,414
[SPEAKER_08]: The PlayStation Network hack.

348
00:26:12,774 --> 00:26:13,774
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't even do that.

349
00:26:13,995 --> 00:26:14,135
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm

350
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:37,641
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, it's just kind of, to me, maybe the Xbox One announcement and kind of all the stuff that went wrong during E3 and kind of the reversal of that stuff is kind of like this generation's almost, I don't know, some people like the specs and stuff that they have on the console and all the different DRM things and stuff.

351
00:26:38,061 --> 00:26:51,208
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's almost like, for the majority of the people, I think it's like this kind of nightmare situation, like this is the way things are going, and kind of, you know, demonstrating all the wrongs, all the stuff that's kind of gone wrong in this generation.

352
00:26:51,588 --> 00:26:55,790
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, I can't really think of anything that's super defining in this.

353
00:26:56,431 --> 00:26:57,091
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard to say.

354
00:26:57,111 --> 00:27:02,574
[SPEAKER_08]: There hasn't really been any huge, huge, huge, like, changes, I would think.

355
00:27:03,447 --> 00:27:06,049
[SPEAKER_03]: I did think of two things that I would like to have been defining.

356
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:12,835
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of them was how they were networking the PS3s as a computer to, what was it, leukemia or cancer research?

357
00:27:13,528 --> 00:27:14,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the Folding at Home?

358
00:27:14,829 --> 00:27:15,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

359
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:21,573
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that's something that should have been defining, but people like to look at the negative instead of the positive.

360
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,475
[SPEAKER_03]: But that and all of the charities that popped up around Next Generation Gaming.

361
00:27:27,196 --> 00:27:32,859
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying that they popped up with this generation, but they've certainly come to higher prevalence with this generation.

362
00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:35,781
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Child's Play, Extra Life.

363
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:44,365
[SPEAKER_03]: and I mean, yeah, a lot of them are going back and playing older consoles but we're seeing a lot more of these popping up and getting attention.

364
00:27:44,505 --> 00:27:52,829
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I kind of tie that to the emergence of streaming your gameplay online and kind of Twitch TV and all the, you know, Ustream and all that.

365
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:56,371
[SPEAKER_07]: as kind of, you know, I think that's one of the big things about this generation.

366
00:27:56,391 --> 00:28:08,738
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you see a lot of charity drives, you know, able to be done a lot easier and a lot more ground roots, you know, ground level types of fundraising.

367
00:28:08,778 --> 00:28:09,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Grassroots.

368
00:28:09,758 --> 00:28:09,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

369
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:10,739
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the word I was looking for.

370
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:17,861
[SPEAKER_07]: types of fundraising because of being able to stream your games online and just have that instant audience.

371
00:28:18,241 --> 00:28:29,064
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of think that story is evolving as we move into the PlayStation 4 and Xbox 360, going to have that stuff in there, although we'll get into the news in a minute here where there's some borders with that and what it will and won't do.

372
00:28:29,564 --> 00:28:34,846
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that is definitely a big story that's kind of bridging the two generations.

373
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:40,949
[SPEAKER_03]: I would really like for stuff like that to be the defining news of the generation.

374
00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:41,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

375
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:45,851
[SPEAKER_08]: The most defining, I think the most defining thing ever of this generation?

376
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:47,352
[SPEAKER_08]: President Cat.

377
00:28:50,053 --> 00:28:54,555
[SPEAKER_03]: I more want to put it as you have communities of people coming together for a good cause through video games.

378
00:28:55,681 --> 00:29:01,906
[SPEAKER_07]: I love some of these answers here in chat, and this is a great one that I didn't even think of, and I'm sitting here going, why?

379
00:29:01,966 --> 00:29:02,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Why didn't I think of this?

380
00:29:03,748 --> 00:29:05,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Tal in our chatroom says, Kickstarter.

381
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Any Kickstarter-related game.

382
00:29:07,832 --> 00:29:17,180
[SPEAKER_07]: And BlackWolf adds to that, the new story of this generation is either the emergence of Kickstarter or the internet bitching enough that a storyteller changed the ending of the story they wanted to tell.

383
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,103
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know, both those things have something in common, and that is...

384
00:29:20,723 --> 00:29:23,844
[SPEAKER_07]: The voice of the internet has become a huge thing this generation.

385
00:29:24,164 --> 00:29:31,946
[SPEAKER_07]: If you think about it, I don't want to toot our own horn a little bit, but podcasting wasn't around last time.

386
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:32,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Heck yeah.

387
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:33,227
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is now.

388
00:29:33,987 --> 00:29:35,607
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's all a part of that.

389
00:29:35,687 --> 00:29:48,011
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the voice of the gamer getting a little louder and those barriers, you know, it used to be the magazine would come to my home and that was the only way I kind of kept tabs on what was going on in the gaming industry.

390
00:29:48,351 --> 00:29:52,075
[SPEAKER_07]: But those barriers between us and the gaming industry are really coming down.

391
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:53,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Twitter is a big part of that.

392
00:29:53,937 --> 00:29:57,160
[SPEAKER_07]: I can interact with developers directly for better or for worse.

393
00:29:58,028 --> 00:30:11,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in general, though, that would be an evolution of communication itself, where many communities are coming together and having that interactivity that we didn't have, you know, 30 years ago, or that we barely had 30 years ago, I'll put it that way.

394
00:30:12,332 --> 00:30:13,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I met my husband online.

395
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:22,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I've made tons, like the chat room is full of, you know, friends of mine now, you know, people I can call friends, so, and that I might not have met otherwise.

396
00:30:23,075 --> 00:30:23,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

397
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:23,795
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

398
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:29,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and Tigerclaw says you could also add the whole thing with PSN being hacked and down for a few weeks.

399
00:30:29,841 --> 00:30:42,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I said it briefly, but yeah, that would actually be my number one most defining thing I think was when PlayStation Network was hacked because I think in a lot of ways it, you know, how much information we're putting out there about ourselves easily.

400
00:30:42,494 --> 00:30:46,298
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a very tough lesson was learned in many ways all around the board.

401
00:30:47,299 --> 00:31:04,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like I think the last generation, the Xbox and PlayStation 2, I think the defining thing of that generation was Xbox Live It's almost like the defining thing of this generation was when the trust there kind of fails us, if that makes sense

402
00:31:04,895 --> 00:31:06,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's how you were over the Xbox thing.

403
00:31:06,876 --> 00:31:07,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sure.

404
00:31:07,897 --> 00:31:18,924
[SPEAKER_03]: And you really do understand a lot more of the nature of marketing, watching the reactions between the two companies, how they responded to their respective hackings.

405
00:31:19,325 --> 00:31:20,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, digital.

406
00:31:20,565 --> 00:31:26,129
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, because there was a big push for Xbox Live Arcade, and I mean, that was something that happened.

407
00:31:26,229 --> 00:31:28,511
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, full-size digital games.

408
00:31:28,551 --> 00:31:34,155
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, granted, I'm sure it was on the PC stuff a long time ago, but console-wise, digital's been a big thing.

409
00:31:35,215 --> 00:31:35,796
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that?

410
00:31:36,756 --> 00:31:48,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, I'm sure you guys sitting there listening to the show have plenty more to add to this, so I invite you to email us or tweet us, especially while we're down during the week, and let us know what defined this generation, be it game or news, for you.

411
00:31:48,584 --> 00:31:52,787
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com, or you can tweet us at OLR.

412
00:31:53,007 --> 00:31:53,808
[SPEAKER_07]: One final thought, Jamie?

413
00:31:54,068 --> 00:31:56,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say the crappiest thing about this generation?

414
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Manuals!

415
00:31:58,491 --> 00:31:59,972
[SPEAKER_03]: We need manuals to come back!

416
00:32:00,232 --> 00:32:02,454
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need these companies to hire me to design them!

417
00:32:03,334 --> 00:32:29,856
[SPEAKER_07]: so in other words it's the downside to the digital exactly print is so beautiful I love manuals and I love posters and I love getting stuff with my game that I can put on my wall or you know keep Midna from eating alright let's move on I want to talk about our gaming weeks quickly we're running a little long tonight because that was a great kickoff topic thank you guys let's quickly talk about our gaming weeks Dark Sakura I'm not playing Animal Crossing right now at all am I

418
00:32:30,937 --> 00:32:59,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy XIV I've been kind of stalling on that just because I'm on my second job and it's so slow I was gifted thanks to D&L Dreams who is so sweet I gave her a box of yarn a while back and she has in return given me the Stanley Parable so I will be playing it very soon I played some Fractal I have been playing a little bit more of the Super Mario 3D world but like I said 3D kind of for me

419
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:08,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and Dan is playing, um, uh, Legend of Zelda, whichever the Oracle of Seasons ones is, our thing.

420
00:33:09,005 --> 00:33:13,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Dan's, uh, he just finished, uh, Mimish Cap and he's, no, is he doing Mimish Cap now?

421
00:33:13,488 --> 00:33:16,910
[SPEAKER_03]: He's doing, he's doing one of them anyway, but Dan's going on this big Zelda kick lately.

422
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:23,595
[SPEAKER_03]: So my, my house has been full of, uh, Zelda music and, uh, and lots of loud cursing.

423
00:33:25,234 --> 00:33:36,963
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, in addition to that, it's just been me hunting down stuff on Steam that I haven't played in a while and actually trying to get some use out of these games and stuff I've gotten on sale before.

424
00:33:37,504 --> 00:33:38,424
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

425
00:33:38,564 --> 00:33:38,945
[SPEAKER_03]: What about you?

426
00:33:40,486 --> 00:33:42,367
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

427
00:33:42,427 --> 00:33:43,248
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm reading Reddit.

428
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:44,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Reddit's funny.

429
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

430
00:33:47,812 --> 00:33:48,772
[SPEAKER_08]: What have I played this week?

431
00:33:49,913 --> 00:33:53,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Grand Theft Auto V. Yeah, that would have been Grand Theft Auto V, yes.

432
00:33:54,111 --> 00:33:55,972
[SPEAKER_08]: So I played a bit of online.

433
00:33:56,272 --> 00:34:01,373
[SPEAKER_08]: We did a very short VOG game night this week, thanks to the one person that came out.

434
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,214
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess everybody else is doing more important things.

435
00:34:05,434 --> 00:34:11,235
[SPEAKER_08]: But next week, though, next week on Friday, we will be doing another VOG game night, this time on PlayStation 3.

436
00:34:11,976 --> 00:34:19,438
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you have the PlayStation 3 version of Grand Theft Auto V and wish to play with us online, we will be doing that 8.15 on Friday.

437
00:34:19,598 --> 00:34:19,858
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

438
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:20,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I should get Dan in on that.

439
00:34:21,306 --> 00:34:21,786
[SPEAKER_08]: You should.

440
00:34:21,806 --> 00:34:22,847
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good time.

441
00:34:22,867 --> 00:34:24,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he would be hilarious.

442
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:28,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he's hilarious anyway, and he's also funny looking, but he'd be even funnier.

443
00:34:28,508 --> 00:34:28,969
[SPEAKER_08]: He'd be fun.

444
00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:34,370
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm going to try to get my coworkers that are not too old that won't fall asleep.

445
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:44,334
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear to God, it's just like, you know, my boss had to, yeah, I totally forgot to play last time because I got home and I just fell asleep.

446
00:34:44,354 --> 00:34:44,374
[SPEAKER_08]: I

447
00:34:45,034 --> 00:34:45,654
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

448
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:05,841
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

449
00:35:21,454 --> 00:35:24,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Pain in the ass, I can't get the plane low enough to trigger it.

450
00:35:25,095 --> 00:35:26,876
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

451
00:35:27,196 --> 00:35:32,838
[SPEAKER_08]: But I got all my stunt jumps done and all my collectibles done and I'm at 96 or 7% now.

452
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:40,321
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just have to do night flights, fly under some bridges, and go to the strip club with my friends.

453
00:35:40,361 --> 00:35:41,802
[SPEAKER_08]: That's actually one of the things I have to do.

454
00:35:43,883 --> 00:35:45,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that it?

455
00:35:45,603 --> 00:35:47,644
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a night in Los Santos without boobs.

456
00:35:48,747 --> 00:36:07,650
[SPEAKER_07]: um my gaming week was you know a lot of Final Fantasy 14 as is to be expected as of late but I'm having a great time in that game and uh Shane is bugging me and as as our other members of my free company are bugging me to finish my relic plus one quest so I do really need to do that uh but otherwise just having a good time uh you know getting my dark light gear completed and all that

457
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:23,053
[SPEAKER_07]: as far as other new games to talk about well this one's not new but it's like a fresh coat of paint on an old classic and that would be the Wii U virtual console release of Super Castlevania 4 and I was playing that because that came out was it on Halloween or the day before?

458
00:36:23,093 --> 00:36:36,676
[SPEAKER_07]: It was this week and since I already had it on Wii it was only like a dollar to get the Wii U version which was great because I can even and before tonight's show I was sitting here playing it and it was on the TV behind me and DarkSakura goes it's so weird that when your TV moves by itself

459
00:36:37,515 --> 00:36:42,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you know, I was really proud of myself when I stepped in and I recognized it just where you had it paused.

460
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, that looks Super Nintendo.

461
00:36:45,182 --> 00:36:46,383
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not Richter.

462
00:36:46,543 --> 00:36:47,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, it's Super Castlevania 4.

463
00:36:47,524 --> 00:36:48,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, absolutely.

464
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:52,889
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, an amazing classic.

465
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:57,874
[SPEAKER_07]: And if for whatever reason you missed this game and you happen to own a Wii U, I really urge you to pick it up.

466
00:36:58,034 --> 00:37:02,638
[SPEAKER_07]: I imagine most people that are on the Wii U probably already played this at some point, but...

467
00:37:02,898 --> 00:37:03,659
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

468
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:35,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, earlier this week, and I know we're going to get into this in the news, so it might be a little bit redundant, but on Monday, I think it was Monday, the Typing of the Dead Overkill came out, which is the new Typing of the Dead based on the House of the Dead Overkill, which was the Wii version of the game.

469
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:42,057
[SPEAKER_07]: So, when I heard there was a new Typing of the Dead, I was like, yes, please, buy, because it's, what, 50% off on Steam during the week?

470
00:37:42,077 --> 00:37:42,717
[SPEAKER_07]: 10 bucks, yeah.

471
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:49,623
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

472
00:38:09,918 --> 00:38:11,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Dreamcast packs don't show on people's backs

473
00:38:31,506 --> 00:39:00,009
[SPEAKER_07]: they had a move it was move enabled I think it also allowed you to you could use the analog sticks if you really want to I just I guess I never really get into those games on the home console like the last shooter game I really truly loved at home was point-blank okay and that was a long time ago oh that needs to come back I know those games were amazing but anyway um you know I never really got into time crisis or any of the on-rails shooters at home that's more of an arcade thing to me so I never really played house of the dead but I love timing of the

474
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:01,750
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounded like you said Ask the Dead for a minute.

475
00:39:02,651 --> 00:39:04,252
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's actually a reason I did not buy it.

476
00:39:05,393 --> 00:39:07,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I need bad voice acting in my House of the Dead.

477
00:39:08,856 --> 00:39:11,058
[SPEAKER_03]: We're beating G over there.

478
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:15,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I do believe that this is the one that had the most uses of fuck in it.

479
00:39:15,741 --> 00:39:26,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my gosh, it's so over the top and it's really dirty, nasty dialogue and exploitation films of the past and like Quentin Tarantino style 70s.

480
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:26,670
[SPEAKER_07]: It's...

481
00:39:28,431 --> 00:39:29,152
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy.

482
00:39:52,689 --> 00:39:54,030
[SPEAKER_07]: I just thought that was funny.

483
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:54,850
[SPEAKER_03]: That was funny.

484
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that's pretty cool.

485
00:39:56,171 --> 00:39:57,532
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anyway, yeah.

486
00:39:57,632 --> 00:39:57,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Loved it.

487
00:39:58,632 --> 00:40:07,297
[SPEAKER_07]: And HitStun in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, I was also disappointed in the lack of visible keyboards, and yes, it contains House of the Dead Overkill Extended Cut.

488
00:40:07,597 --> 00:40:11,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, if you want to use your mouse and play the clicky-click version, you can do that too.

489
00:40:12,019 --> 00:40:13,580
[SPEAKER_07]: But for me, it's all about the typing.

490
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,380
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, though?

491
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:25,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have to say that the best thing to ever come out of Typing of the Dead was cosplay I saw at AX one year that had the Dreamcast pack and the keyboard and everything.

492
00:40:25,443 --> 00:40:26,003
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.

493
00:40:26,103 --> 00:40:26,643
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

494
00:40:27,164 --> 00:40:27,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing.

495
00:40:28,164 --> 00:40:28,504
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

496
00:40:29,284 --> 00:40:31,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get into gaming news.

497
00:40:31,425 --> 00:40:33,585
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to do some housekeeping real quick, though, before we get there.

498
00:40:34,246 --> 00:40:37,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, I said this earlier, but just a reminder, we will not be here live next week.

499
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:38,887
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

500
00:40:40,117 --> 00:40:42,140
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will be here live, just not on air.

501
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Just not on air.

502
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:44,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you'll do a Twitch thing or something.

503
00:40:44,463 --> 00:40:45,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

504
00:40:45,385 --> 00:40:45,505
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

505
00:40:45,525 --> 00:40:45,945
[SPEAKER_07]: No, probably not.

506
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,348
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

507
00:40:47,388 --> 00:40:49,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do my homework and let you guys watch.

508
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:51,413
[SPEAKER_07]: We're taking a night off because you know what?

509
00:40:51,614 --> 00:40:53,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes we want a night off.

510
00:40:53,917 --> 00:40:55,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sneaking myself off in Rob's luggage.

511
00:40:57,701 --> 00:41:03,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Also in housekeeping tonight, I want to mention that we unveiled something new at vognetwork.com tonight.

512
00:41:03,943 --> 00:41:08,045
[SPEAKER_07]: You can hear the in-depth discussion on the Bobby Blackwolf show when he posts his episode midweek.

513
00:41:08,845 --> 00:41:15,147
[SPEAKER_07]: But in a nutshell, the game at vognetwork.com now includes a raffle element.

514
00:41:15,547 --> 00:41:24,393
[SPEAKER_07]: So in other words, when you check into shows, you get your points, you do all that, you can potentially earn real crap that we will ship to you.

515
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:26,735
[SPEAKER_07]: And this month's crap is pretty good.

516
00:41:26,835 --> 00:41:27,935
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Cards Against Humanity.

517
00:41:27,995 --> 00:41:29,937
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a sealed version of a very hard-to-get game.

518
00:41:30,317 --> 00:41:32,378
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I'm sure there'll be some people that want to get that.

519
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:34,480
[SPEAKER_07]: So all you have to do, you have to enter, though.

520
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,601
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not automatically put in just because you get points.

521
00:41:36,641 --> 00:41:40,824
[SPEAKER_07]: You do have to enter, and you can check that out at vognetwork.com slash raffles.

522
00:41:40,844 --> 00:41:45,167
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that also shows up now on the left side of the page under your user info.

523
00:41:45,607 --> 00:41:47,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

524
00:42:10,743 --> 00:42:21,015
[SPEAKER_07]: and many of you have been until now so we just want to say thank you very much and hope you enjoy this new little twist on the VOG Network game.

525
00:42:23,318 --> 00:42:28,525
[SPEAKER_07]: One other thing I gotta say and then we can get into news but this is important and I want to wish a very happy

526
00:42:28,985 --> 00:42:29,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

527
00:42:48,747 --> 00:43:17,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Brad and his gang over there at PodCulture Christina, Adam, all those guys have been a great support of OLR especially Brad in the support that he's given these projects here at OLR he supports Horde House in a huge way he helped set up the website and get that show hosted at Horde House so I'm so appreciative for that the microphones that we use here now at OLR were kind of handed down from Brad from PodCulture

528
00:43:17,981 --> 00:43:20,302
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, they've just been such a great support over the years.

529
00:43:20,322 --> 00:43:22,042
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're squishy.

530
00:43:22,062 --> 00:43:23,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, with the little foamy hats.

531
00:43:23,282 --> 00:43:23,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they are.

532
00:43:23,722 --> 00:43:24,142
[SPEAKER_03]: They're squishy.

533
00:43:24,362 --> 00:43:24,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine's red.

534
00:43:24,943 --> 00:43:25,903
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.

535
00:43:26,143 --> 00:43:27,463
[SPEAKER_08]: It's for our listeners' protection.

536
00:43:27,863 --> 00:43:28,283
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

537
00:43:28,343 --> 00:43:28,723
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

538
00:43:29,483 --> 00:43:33,264
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, I just want to say a big thank you and congratulations because 400 is an epic milestone.

539
00:43:33,384 --> 00:43:35,405
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember when you were just a wee 150.

540
00:43:35,445 --> 00:43:37,525
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

541
00:43:38,385 --> 00:43:38,785
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

542
00:43:38,925 --> 00:43:41,586
[SPEAKER_07]: So congrats to all those guys over there at PodCulture.

543
00:43:43,737 --> 00:43:49,182
[SPEAKER_05]: To register for participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VOGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, TURN.

544
00:43:49,362 --> 00:43:51,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's start with the gaming news tonight.

545
00:43:51,544 --> 00:43:53,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, please, if you would, start us off with the news.

546
00:43:53,805 --> 00:44:01,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, one of the taglines for the PlayStation 3 this generation was, it only does, and then they list a ton of shit.

547
00:44:01,812 --> 00:44:09,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this week they decided to put out a fact, or they being Sony, decided to put out a fact outlining the stuff that the PlayStation 4 won't do.

548
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:16,302
[SPEAKER_08]: And that includes a few things at launch, which of course you're going to have to update your system and stuff.

549
00:44:17,142 --> 00:44:23,446
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to lack DLNA support, so you're not really going to be able to stream stuff from media servers too easily.

550
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:31,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, it doesn't feature a music visualizer, and that's probably because it doesn't play any CDs.

551
00:44:32,811 --> 00:44:38,616
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, dynamic themes are not supported, which makes sense because it kind of changed the whole user interface anyways.

552
00:44:40,218 --> 00:44:42,380
[SPEAKER_08]: And MP3 playback is not going to happen.

553
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:56,373
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you want to listen to music or see videos or that kind of thing, you can do that through Sony Music's unlimited service and video unlimited service.

554
00:44:58,069 --> 00:44:59,430
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, actually, here's the thing.

555
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not entirely sure that you can't stream stuff to your PS4.

556
00:45:04,414 --> 00:45:08,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I remember the Wii had that kind of problem, too, where you couldn't stream stuff.

557
00:45:08,256 --> 00:45:17,163
[SPEAKER_08]: But they had a lot of services set up where you go to a web page, or you set up, like, a server, and it creates a web page on your network, and then you just do it through the web browser.

558
00:45:17,463 --> 00:45:19,024
[SPEAKER_08]: So there might be a workaround there.

559
00:45:19,304 --> 00:45:21,005
[SPEAKER_08]: That's essentially a hack.

560
00:45:21,105 --> 00:45:25,246
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, not like a hack like you think, but it's a workaround.

561
00:45:25,466 --> 00:45:26,767
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still annoying that they did that.

562
00:45:27,347 --> 00:45:39,011
[SPEAKER_08]: And the other thing they were saying too, the PlayStation 4 share button and record capabilities, apparently that is going to be kind of limited to Twitch.

563
00:45:39,391 --> 00:45:42,692
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not going to be able to upload videos to YouTube.

564
00:45:43,733 --> 00:45:43,893
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

565
00:45:45,011 --> 00:45:45,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

566
00:46:01,005 --> 00:46:02,066
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know.

567
00:46:03,106 --> 00:46:04,046
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that's a big deal.

568
00:46:04,066 --> 00:46:07,008
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to have something in place if they want to protect whatever they're doing.

569
00:46:07,028 --> 00:46:09,289
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is at launch, so, I mean, it makes sense.

570
00:46:10,129 --> 00:46:14,511
[SPEAKER_08]: They're also saying Ustream footage will not be saved for later playback, so, whatever.

571
00:46:16,392 --> 00:46:23,055
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing I was going to mention, one of the things, actually, when Bobby was talking about it on the show, and I had mentioned it on the show, and Rob said, hey, save that for the show.

572
00:46:25,036 --> 00:46:27,377
[SPEAKER_08]: My thoughts about the MP3 playback, because it kind of sucks.

573
00:46:27,757 --> 00:46:47,451
[SPEAKER_08]: and you know I've been seeing the conspiracy theory out there where they're like well they're just trying to get people to you know participate in Sony's music unlimited service or something like that I think there might be actually another reason behind it if you think about it first off they have to build it in the game so that you know to have mp3 playback but let's just assume that it works with games kind of like how it does now

574
00:46:48,686 --> 00:46:49,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

575
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony Music Unlimited

576
00:47:24,185 --> 00:47:25,426
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very interesting thought.

577
00:47:25,527 --> 00:47:36,356
[SPEAKER_07]: I should probably just throw out there the point that there are many streams on Twitch TV today where the person's playing Warcraft or League of Legends, and they're listening to iTunes in the background.

578
00:47:36,657 --> 00:47:40,540
[SPEAKER_07]: So you do hear licensed music go out through Twitch TV all the time, and it's kind of a gray area.

579
00:47:40,921 --> 00:47:49,769
[SPEAKER_07]: And Twitch kind of says, I think in their legal fact, and I'm going off my memory, so I apologize if I'm wrong or misrepresenting, but I want to say it just kind of says, you know, we don't really...

580
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:55,413
[SPEAKER_07]: We consider it kind of like fair use or whatever as long as they don't complain about it type of thing.

581
00:47:56,814 --> 00:48:00,737
[SPEAKER_07]: They have no reason to go out and take it down because it's just part of a broadcast.

582
00:48:01,217 --> 00:48:03,919
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of a gray area right now.

583
00:48:03,979 --> 00:48:05,941
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that's an interesting perspective.

584
00:48:06,001 --> 00:48:12,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony, as a record label as well as this, maybe has a vested interest in not having you be able to stream your music.

585
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:15,728
[SPEAKER_08]: And it could be that they are just trying to sell more subscriptions to Music Unlimited.

586
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:16,449
[SPEAKER_08]: But let's be honest.

587
00:48:16,509 --> 00:48:18,310
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if I have a PlayStation 4...

588
00:48:20,072 --> 00:48:22,694
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I need to really necessarily do that.

589
00:48:23,014 --> 00:48:28,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the other thing too, it's not going to support USB hard drive support or memory sticks at launch.

590
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:29,860
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like that.

591
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,804
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't understand the reason behind it, especially when it's something that's already in the PlayStation 3.

592
00:48:35,564 --> 00:48:39,588
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why, but whatever the case, this is just at launch.

593
00:48:40,308 --> 00:48:40,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Stuff can change.

594
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:49,200
[SPEAKER_08]: One other thing though that's come out is the Xbox One will support playback of CDs.

595
00:48:49,781 --> 00:48:53,346
[SPEAKER_08]: It will also support DLNA streaming as well.

596
00:48:54,007 --> 00:48:54,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Although

597
00:48:58,804 --> 00:49:00,185
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it's a little different.

598
00:49:00,645 --> 00:49:02,305
[SPEAKER_08]: MP3 playback you can't do.

599
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:06,607
[SPEAKER_08]: They're saying to do that, the system I guess is set up as like a Play 2 receiver.

600
00:49:07,287 --> 00:49:16,610
[SPEAKER_08]: And that means you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 PC or Windows Phone I guess to stream to it.

601
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:19,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of like the Windows Media Center or something like that.

602
00:49:19,271 --> 00:49:19,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy our products.

603
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:21,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, yeah.

604
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:22,612
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of locked into that.

605
00:49:23,072 --> 00:49:23,332
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

606
00:49:25,151 --> 00:49:47,331
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, I mean, that's kind of annoying, but whatever the reasons, you know, it is a little disappointing that you can't out of the box use it as like a media server or something like that, because that's why I use my PlayStation 3 for a lot, but I guess their thoughts would be, oh, well, just use your PlayStation 3 for that, or buy a PlayStation 3 for that specific purpose.

607
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:51,575
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still annoying, and hopefully later on, maybe a year from now, or

608
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:54,457
[SPEAKER_08]: PKJr92 says I would think it would be super easy to just not allow anything playing locally to stream.

609
00:50:14,813 --> 00:50:15,534
[SPEAKER_07]: I would think two.

610
00:50:15,654 --> 00:50:17,917
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so too, but they are rushing.

611
00:50:18,718 --> 00:50:20,700
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of stuff is kind of in rush mode right now.

612
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:23,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that's kind of like, okay, let's not worry about that right now.

613
00:50:24,003 --> 00:50:27,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just do this and then we'll fix it later.

614
00:50:28,256 --> 00:50:36,520
[SPEAKER_03]: My thought with that is that they might also be managing it some of the similar way that I've been using live stream lately for a lot of my drawing stuff.

615
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,742
[SPEAKER_03]: And you actually can choose what channels you have input into your stream.

616
00:50:41,502 --> 00:50:45,084
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, they probably have like maybe a channel selector of some sort.

617
00:50:46,104 --> 00:50:54,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Brad from PodCulture says, it's better to not have features to start out and then add later versus launch with features that get taken away like other OS on PlayStation 3.

618
00:50:54,989 --> 00:50:56,069
[SPEAKER_07]: That is very much the truth.

619
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:57,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Very much the truth.

620
00:50:59,191 --> 00:50:59,491
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

621
00:50:59,591 --> 00:51:01,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's move on with some other stories.

622
00:51:02,052 --> 00:51:08,415
[SPEAKER_07]: This is – I have no better way to put this than this was the tweet that was heard around the world this week.

623
00:51:09,076 --> 00:51:13,498
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was actually a twit longer because it was too much for one tweet actually.

624
00:51:13,658 --> 00:51:16,580
[SPEAKER_07]: XBOX ONE XBOX ONE XBOX ONE XBOX ONE XBOX ONE

625
00:51:35,849 --> 00:51:38,251
[SPEAKER_07]: and were native 1080p on the PlayStation 4.

626
00:51:39,011 --> 00:51:43,074
[SPEAKER_07]: We optimized each console to hit 60 frames per second and the game looks great on both.

627
00:51:43,454 --> 00:51:46,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Still on the road, but glad to see the great reception to Extinction.

628
00:51:46,396 --> 00:51:47,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't wait for next week's launch.

629
00:51:48,577 --> 00:51:50,639
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, that went over...

630
00:51:52,082 --> 00:51:53,023
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

631
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:36,825
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, based on those two games and speculating like crazy, it sounds like the Xbox One, it's harder to get the graphics and stuff to be where they need to be in order to get the performance that you have on that system.

632
00:52:36,985 --> 00:52:37,826
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it sounds like.

633
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:39,466
[SPEAKER_08]: It's easier to do it on the PlayStation 4.

634
00:52:39,606 --> 00:52:42,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me ask a couple devil's advocate questions that are important.

635
00:52:42,888 --> 00:52:43,908
[SPEAKER_07]: One, 720p versus 900p.

636
00:52:46,409 --> 00:52:48,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there really a difference?

637
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:51,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I really see the difference between the two?

638
00:52:51,711 --> 00:52:52,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it that big of a deal?

639
00:52:54,132 --> 00:53:05,236
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll note, well, it was hard because they did some side-by-side comparisons, but the problem is that the Xbox One version doesn't have a patch for some of the anti-aliasing stuff that they're going to have in there.

640
00:53:06,857 --> 00:53:10,638
[SPEAKER_08]: So right now it does look more jaggy on the Xbox One.

641
00:53:11,098 --> 00:53:12,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that going to change when that patch comes out?

642
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:17,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably, so is it very hard to tell the difference between the two?

643
00:53:18,121 --> 00:53:29,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, for most people, you're not going to notice a huge difference, but the more detail that you have in there, especially with these consoles pushing more detail, you're going to notice it eventually.

644
00:53:29,865 --> 00:53:32,926
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, the other thing is, it's a next-gen fucking game!

645
00:53:33,326 --> 00:53:36,548
[SPEAKER_08]: It should be running at 1080p in my opinion.

646
00:53:38,289 --> 00:53:50,876
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's running at the same resolution as a regular Xbox 360 game, and some Xbox 360 games are probably running higher resolutions, why am I spending $500 on this fucking system in the first place?

647
00:53:51,196 --> 00:53:54,337
[SPEAKER_08]: What am I getting out of it that's different than the Xbox 360 version?

648
00:53:56,018 --> 00:54:02,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking at our chat at live.vognetwork.com, Ranma says, also, if you're gaming on a 32-inch TV, you will not see the difference.

649
00:54:03,244 --> 00:54:05,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Bonds006 says, though, yes, there is a difference.

650
00:54:06,766 --> 00:54:14,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma also speculates, I think that because of the usage of system memory, PlayStation 4 is using GDDR5 and Xbox One is using DDR3.

651
00:54:14,932 --> 00:54:15,532
[SPEAKER_07]: That could be it.

652
00:54:15,612 --> 00:54:17,333
[SPEAKER_07]: GDDR memory is for video cards.

653
00:54:18,754 --> 00:54:24,339
[SPEAKER_07]: The other devil's advocate point I wanted to bring up is, weren't we in this exact reverse situation last generation?

654
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:44,294
[SPEAKER_07]: And I specifically think of the game Oblivion, because I seem to remember when that came out for PlayStation 3, and it came out a year after it was out on 360, and people were like, it sucks, and the slowness of the Blu-ray drive holds it back, and it's graphically not as good, it's buggy.

655
00:54:45,655 --> 00:54:47,277
[SPEAKER_07]: But did that really ruin the PlayStation 3?

656
00:54:47,901 --> 00:54:48,001
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

657
00:55:18,284 --> 00:55:34,295
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, for some people that's not a big deal, but when you're spending $500, $400 on a new system, you're going to be paying attention to every single... Especially when you're looking at games, like if I'm looking to play Call of Duty, that's a game that's not exclusive to one of those consoles.

658
00:55:34,916 --> 00:55:43,202
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be looking at every damn thing, and if it runs better on one system than another one... Like, for example, if I was buying a next-gen system for Oblivion or Skyrim...

659
00:55:44,082 --> 00:55:58,199
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't be buying a Playstation 3 because it ran like shit on the Playstation 3 until about 8 patches later then it finally ran okay for Skyrim I'm not sure if they ever fixed Oblivion but it took a long time well

660
00:55:59,973 --> 00:56:05,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I think... I do understand that point of wanting to have the capability to run higher.

661
00:56:06,338 --> 00:56:12,663
[SPEAKER_03]: But there also, I mean, you got to think about the average person who's going to be able to afford having the huge TV that will show it off.

662
00:56:13,464 --> 00:56:17,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I mean, for me, yeah, I would want all of that.

663
00:56:17,908 --> 00:56:23,192
[SPEAKER_03]: But if the average player isn't going to have the TV to show it off, why worry about it?

664
00:56:23,252 --> 00:56:24,633
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still going to look great either way.

665
00:56:25,729 --> 00:56:53,705
[SPEAKER_07]: more comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Dungeon Buster says Bethesda had little experience with the Playstation 3 at the time too they've gotten better though the problems with Skyrim's DLC still point out issues they have with it and Extover says I say it's too early to tell let's wait until next year when next gen exclusives come out more often you know that is true these are launch games and every other generation we've seen that you put the launch games next to the games that come out at the end of the generation and you see the progress

666
00:56:54,185 --> 00:56:55,627
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

667
00:57:13,484 --> 00:57:19,968
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, granted, they're going to have some better physics and stuff, like, ooh, moving grass, ooh, you know, leaves are rustling.

668
00:57:20,248 --> 00:57:22,990
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, for a lot of people, it doesn't matter.

669
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:30,595
[SPEAKER_08]: The majority of the copies of Call of Duty are going to be sold on the Xbox 360, like they are every other year.

670
00:57:31,495 --> 00:57:33,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Last comment from our chat, then we'll go to DarkSakura's story.

671
00:57:34,037 --> 00:57:38,701
[SPEAKER_07]: BlackWolf says frames per second, or FPS, is more important than resolution anyway.

672
00:57:39,061 --> 00:57:42,884
[SPEAKER_07]: A constant 60 frames a second outweighs the number of pixels on the screen.

673
00:57:43,265 --> 00:57:43,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Amen.

674
00:57:43,885 --> 00:57:50,170
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with that immensely, because I'll play Final Fantasy XIV in crappier graphics settings just to get it to run smooth.

675
00:57:50,451 --> 00:57:53,173
[SPEAKER_07]: That's more important than it being pretty.

676
00:57:53,853 --> 00:57:55,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, let's move on.

677
00:57:55,335 --> 00:58:00,639
[SPEAKER_07]: We could debate this all day long, as people have been doing on the internet for a long time, but we have a lot of shows still to go.

678
00:58:01,257 --> 00:58:02,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Who remembers the pocket station?

679
00:58:02,882 --> 00:58:04,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Me Do you remember the pocket station?

680
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,409
[SPEAKER_07]: I have one

681
00:58:06,195 --> 00:58:07,076
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to steal Jewelies.

682
00:58:07,156 --> 00:58:08,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, borrow Jewelies.

683
00:58:08,297 --> 00:58:11,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that how you raised a Chocobo in Final Fantasy VIII or something like that?

684
00:58:11,219 --> 00:58:11,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell yeah.

685
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:16,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it also had a stat mode for... What was that game?

686
00:58:17,904 --> 00:58:23,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Shitty Justice Gakuen Evolution, the Rival Schools second edition that came out on PlayStation.

687
00:58:23,828 --> 00:58:31,714
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember if it was official or non-official, but it had a wonderful DDR non-stop course editor for the fourth mix.

688
00:58:31,934 --> 00:58:32,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes.

689
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:36,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there was a teaser that came out.

690
00:58:36,818 --> 00:58:46,845
[SPEAKER_03]: There's basically this four-minute PlayStation Japan video that's out that teases the Pocket Station.

691
00:58:48,006 --> 00:58:53,230
[SPEAKER_03]: So we could possibly see something similar to it coming out with PS4.

692
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:55,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, of course, this is just a hint at it.

693
00:58:55,551 --> 00:59:00,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing etched in stone or engraved in metal, I should say.

694
00:59:00,856 --> 00:59:02,077
[SPEAKER_03]: But who knows?

695
00:59:02,157 --> 00:59:05,442
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I used the hell out of my VMU on my Dreamcast.

696
00:59:05,462 --> 00:59:11,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I carried like three VMUs on my keychain at one time because I had my Chao, Dan's Chao, and my Godzilla.

697
00:59:12,361 --> 00:59:15,103
[SPEAKER_07]: It could make a very interesting iPhone or Android app.

698
00:59:15,123 --> 00:59:16,645
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, it's going to be an app.

699
00:59:16,705 --> 00:59:17,906
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to be a device.

700
00:59:18,286 --> 00:59:21,569
[SPEAKER_07]: It just seems very obvious to be a great use for the app.

701
00:59:22,329 --> 00:59:23,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be fun.

702
00:59:24,111 --> 00:59:25,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if they have the little cat.

703
00:59:26,033 --> 00:59:26,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I love the cat.

704
00:59:27,594 --> 00:59:30,376
[SPEAKER_03]: The little mascot that's shown up

705
00:59:31,557 --> 00:59:51,393
[SPEAKER_07]: ever since it would be awesome because you know they can the Playstation 3 can play the older games which I'm assuming is a matter of time before you see that on Playstation 4 as well that they you know bring out the library of old PS1 and 2 games that would be really awesome if you could get a Pocket Station emulator on your phone I know that might be asking too much but I think it would be really cool

706
00:59:51,775 --> 01:00:04,678
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what would be nice is using, if you get that emulator and they start bringing out localized games that we never saw, sort of like how Nintendo's doing with the Wii U. True.

707
01:00:04,758 --> 01:00:05,339
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be fun.

708
01:00:05,999 --> 01:00:06,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

709
01:00:06,879 --> 01:00:07,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on, Loki.

710
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:08,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

711
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:15,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft has put out a brand new privacy policy.

712
01:00:15,882 --> 01:00:19,002
[SPEAKER_08]: They're talking about how they collect data.

713
01:00:19,142 --> 01:00:27,285
[SPEAKER_08]: This is mainly referring to the Kinect and talking about what features they record.

714
01:00:27,725 --> 01:00:38,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, the Kinect camera actually records some information as far as your facial recognition and stuff, but it saves that to your console, so that's actually not shared.

715
01:00:39,229 --> 01:00:44,954
[SPEAKER_08]: They did say, though, that you could, I guess, turn off, of course, the Kinect features at any time.

716
01:00:45,995 --> 01:00:49,258
[SPEAKER_08]: And the voice, I guess, commands are captured, but I don't think those are shared.

717
01:00:49,939 --> 01:00:53,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Skype, though, on the other hand, well, nothing's guaranteed to be private there.

718
01:00:54,242 --> 01:01:01,169
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess they can get that if you want, which is not surprising because I think they're already sharing it at the NSA anyways.

719
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:03,811
[SPEAKER_08]: And then...

720
01:01:04,625 --> 01:01:14,472
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing that's kind of been the bane of my existence, at least on the Xbox 360 right now, they want some updated contact information for your safety.

721
01:01:14,812 --> 01:01:23,198
[SPEAKER_08]: So like second ways to contact you via email or texting you or phone calls and stuff like that.

722
01:01:24,279 --> 01:01:28,561
[SPEAKER_08]: I've tried to put my information in there a few times now, and it never fucking takes.

723
01:01:28,922 --> 01:01:30,142
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember you bitching about this before.

724
01:01:30,222 --> 01:01:31,663
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, oh, I don't have it.

725
01:01:31,703 --> 01:01:36,085
[SPEAKER_08]: So now I just back out of it every goddamn time because I've already put that stuff in there.

726
01:01:36,205 --> 01:01:41,268
[SPEAKER_08]: The website said it was confirmed, yet it keeps nagging me for fucking information over and over.

727
01:01:41,328 --> 01:01:42,148
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll send me the text.

728
01:01:42,168 --> 01:01:42,849
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll confirm it.

729
01:01:43,329 --> 01:01:47,351
[SPEAKER_08]: It fucking even sent me the text, and I was going to confirm it on the Xbox 360.

730
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:50,553
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, no, sorry, you have to visit this website to do that.

731
01:01:50,913 --> 01:01:52,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Then why the fuck are you nagging me through this?

732
01:01:54,201 --> 01:02:05,044
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, so anyways, now if you, I guess you could link your service account with, you know, some other stuff and you have to have some sort of like name, address, email and all that stuff.

733
01:02:06,504 --> 01:02:09,065
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's just to protect the hacks and all that, right?

734
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they claim.

735
01:02:10,425 --> 01:02:13,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it can text you if somebody's trying to spend a lot of money or something like that, right?

736
01:02:13,426 --> 01:02:20,067
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's more of like, you know, second way to authenticate yourself, you know, because Google does that now, Steam does it.

737
01:02:20,107 --> 01:02:21,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, sure.

738
01:02:21,608 --> 01:02:22,488
[SPEAKER_08]: With emails, so.

739
01:02:23,008 --> 01:02:23,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Makes sense.

740
01:02:23,788 --> 01:02:30,211
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate them at least trying to protect things, especially after having money stolen in the Xbox 360 very easily.

741
01:02:30,871 --> 01:02:35,894
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that they're taking the extra step, even if it's a little sloppy from Loki's perspective.

742
01:02:36,514 --> 01:02:48,219
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, just as a reminder, you probably want to make sure that you go to Xbox.com and go to your account settings to make sure that you opt out of all of the

743
01:02:48,699 --> 01:02:55,041
[SPEAKER_08]: sharing of that information with Microsoft Parties and company affiliates, resellers, distributors, etc., etc., etc.

744
01:02:55,261 --> 01:02:59,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm sure that they conveniently left that on, you know.

745
01:02:59,482 --> 01:03:00,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, of course.

746
01:03:01,842 --> 01:03:08,764
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, moving on to some highly controversial news this week, and this one just really blew me away.

747
01:03:09,064 --> 01:03:09,224
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

748
01:03:10,784 --> 01:03:11,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh boy.

749
01:03:13,125 --> 01:03:20,567
[SPEAKER_07]: We just had a comment earlier in the show about somebody said it's better to add a feature after the console comes out than to take something away.

750
01:03:20,767 --> 01:03:21,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that was Brad.

751
01:03:21,767 --> 01:03:22,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it was Brad.

752
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:26,889
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are seeing this week something getting taken away.

753
01:03:27,149 --> 01:03:33,531
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's Nintendo who disabled the Swap Note application on their 3DS.

754
01:03:34,351 --> 01:03:36,332
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's due to the exchange of, quote,

755
01:03:37,012 --> 01:04:03,216
[SPEAKER_07]: explicit material now it should be pointed out I may have overdone it there because they didn't disable the entire app but they disabled the spot pass feature which for most people was the app that means sending the notes through the internet so you can no longer send pictures of your cats through the internet because some kids were exchanging explicit material and I guess they just found this out what two years after the app launched and

756
01:04:03,936 --> 01:04:06,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Some users were exchanging offensive material.

757
01:04:07,437 --> 01:04:13,658
[SPEAKER_07]: The feature was deactivated to, quote, limit the risk of any inappropriate activity or misuse of a service.

758
01:04:14,739 --> 01:04:29,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Further quotes from Nintendo's notice, quote, Nintendo has learned that some consumers, including miners, have been exchanging their friend codes on internet bulletin boards and then using Swapnote, known as Nintendo Letterboxd in other regions, to exchange offensive material.

759
01:04:29,722 --> 01:04:40,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo has been investigating ways of preventing this and determined it is best to stop the spot pass feature of swap note because it allows the direct exchange of photos and was actively misused.

760
01:04:40,732 --> 01:04:48,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo always wants to provide a positive experience for all consumers and limit the risk of any inappropriate activity or misuse of a service.

761
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:51,441
[SPEAKER_07]: We feel it is important on this occasion to take this action.

762
01:04:52,182 --> 01:04:56,386
[SPEAKER_07]: We are very sorry for any inconvenience to the many consumers who have been using this service.

763
01:04:56,806 --> 01:05:04,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo will continue to work to ensure more consumers are aware of our parental control features which allow parents to manage their children's experience on our systems.

764
01:05:06,234 --> 01:05:07,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo just now learned this.

765
01:05:08,216 --> 01:05:09,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Two afters after the fact.

766
01:05:10,157 --> 01:05:18,464
[SPEAKER_07]: That if you give teenagers access to the internet they're going to take pictures of their penis and send it to their friends.

767
01:05:18,865 --> 01:05:20,386
[SPEAKER_07]: It took you two years to figure that out?

768
01:05:21,994 --> 01:05:23,236
[SPEAKER_07]: I am just shocked.

769
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:40,411
[SPEAKER_07]: at the... Like, I don't even know what word to use with it.

770
01:05:40,431 --> 01:05:41,651
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a degree of naivety.

771
01:05:41,991 --> 01:05:48,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I think naivety... God damn it, I keep wanting to say naivety because it's Christmas.

772
01:05:49,713 --> 01:05:50,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Naivety.

773
01:05:50,493 --> 01:05:53,354
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not remotely Christmas, it's Hanukkah first.

774
01:05:53,914 --> 01:05:54,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean Thanksgiving.

775
01:05:55,054 --> 01:05:56,474
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean Thanksgiving-ka.

776
01:05:56,694 --> 01:05:59,775
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm just blown away by...

777
01:06:00,635 --> 01:06:08,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, honest to God, it took you two years to get to that point, and now you're taking it away because kids look up porn online?

778
01:06:10,879 --> 01:06:17,042
[SPEAKER_08]: And yet, you leave the internet browser, which I'm sure you've made terrible on purpose.

779
01:06:17,382 --> 01:06:27,786
[SPEAKER_07]: The first thing I did when I saw this news story is I went to my DS browser, I pulled up gay porn, and I took a picture of it and put it on Twitter saying, well, Nintendo didn't really remove the porn from my DS, now did they?

780
01:06:28,666 --> 01:06:30,087
[SPEAKER_07]: But they removed the child porn.

781
01:06:31,155 --> 01:06:37,962
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it that I told Bobby when he cast the shows over to us?

782
01:06:38,342 --> 01:06:42,787
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, there are two things that you're going to have on a device the moment it comes out.

783
01:06:43,147 --> 01:06:44,269
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's porn and Linux.

784
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:46,151
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.

785
01:06:47,671 --> 01:06:49,413
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

786
01:07:05,589 --> 01:07:08,491
[SPEAKER_07]: or all this party and Spike and I were talking about this a lot.

787
01:07:08,511 --> 01:07:10,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Spike's a big Nintendo fan and I understand why.

788
01:07:10,912 --> 01:07:13,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo does make some great games as I said earlier.

789
01:07:14,334 --> 01:07:17,035
[SPEAKER_07]: The game I'm most looking forward to this holiday season is a Nintendo game.

790
01:07:17,376 --> 01:07:19,777
[SPEAKER_07]: A Nintendo game in many ways defined last generation.

791
01:07:20,877 --> 01:07:46,633
[SPEAKER_07]: and he was throwing out a theory that maybe this has to do with the 2DS and the fact that the 2DS is marketed a bit more towards children and because Nintendo is more actively pursuing the kid market maybe they have to pay a little more attention to what kids can actually do with the device and although I totally understand that point and respect it there's a part of me that goes well god damn it when are we going to put some onus on the parents because a kid doesn't walk into Toys R Us and plop down $130 on a 2DS.

792
01:07:49,654 --> 01:07:51,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody drove them there, if they do.

793
01:07:51,875 --> 01:07:54,295
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a lot of irresponsibility on the part of parents, I think.

794
01:07:55,695 --> 01:08:00,717
[SPEAKER_07]: So put the 2DS in a giant envelope that says Parental Warning in big red letters.

795
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:03,937
[SPEAKER_07]: To disable internet on this device.

796
01:08:04,958 --> 01:08:18,301
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, the thing, and this goes a little bit into marketing too, is that when you have a system with a warning label on it, you have a chance that a parent's going to just see the warning.

797
01:08:19,281 --> 01:08:21,605
[SPEAKER_03]: and go, oh, well, I don't want to do this risk.

798
01:08:21,665 --> 01:08:24,369
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easier not to deal with it than have to work for it.

799
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:29,477
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got too much else on my plate with my kid or how can I watch everything all the time?

800
01:08:29,537 --> 01:08:30,959
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better just to not get it.

801
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,282
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I see it that way too.

802
01:08:34,585 --> 01:08:35,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Video Chat

803
01:08:56,283 --> 01:09:04,430
[SPEAKER_07]: So right at this moment, I could go on and I could call whoever's on their Wii U right now and I could say, hey, look at this, and pull down my pants and show them my balls.

804
01:09:05,411 --> 01:09:08,714
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's... I mean, is Nintendo going to shut down the video chat too?

805
01:09:09,174 --> 01:09:19,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, heaven forbid, a child unsupervised uses the device because the parents were too lazy to enable parental controls and starts, you know, showing their goods to predators.

806
01:09:20,844 --> 01:09:21,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I...

807
01:09:22,285 --> 01:09:25,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I'm not... Don't misunderstand me.

808
01:09:26,547 --> 01:09:32,050
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the terrible thing, and people who prey on kids like that should have horrible, horrible things done to them.

809
01:09:32,490 --> 01:09:39,133
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think there has to be responsibility on the parents' part that if you put a device like this in the home, you need to watch what your kids are doing.

810
01:09:40,094 --> 01:09:42,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to respond to HitStun, by the way.

811
01:09:42,535 --> 01:09:44,496
[SPEAKER_07]: And what does HitStun say in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com?

812
01:09:44,516 --> 01:09:45,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Why, they just patch out photos?

813
01:09:46,217 --> 01:09:46,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

814
01:09:46,917 --> 01:09:50,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, it's not stopping people from, you know, drawing...

815
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:54,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and photos were the best part.

816
01:09:54,822 --> 01:09:56,323
[SPEAKER_03]: So how are you supposed to share your photos now?

817
01:09:56,363 --> 01:09:57,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I like photos of pussy.

818
01:09:57,664 --> 01:10:01,847
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the point of having a 3D camera on the thing if you can't share it with anyone?

819
01:10:02,087 --> 01:10:07,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you can take them off on your SD card and email them.

820
01:10:08,011 --> 01:10:13,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Swapnote came after the launch anyway, so you can technically still view them on your card.

821
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:16,717
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess hypothetically, yeah, you could email them or something, but...

822
01:10:17,497 --> 01:10:18,297
[SPEAKER_07]: It really did.

823
01:10:18,777 --> 01:10:21,738
[SPEAKER_07]: And I saw the word used in chat here by PKJr92.

824
01:10:21,778 --> 01:10:24,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo neutered the service.

825
01:10:24,079 --> 01:10:26,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it really neutered the photography.

826
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:29,900
[SPEAKER_07]: And even Nintendo's own implementation.

827
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you can take the screenshots in Animal Crossing.

828
01:10:32,181 --> 01:10:33,561
[SPEAKER_07]: And they touted that as a big feature.

829
01:10:34,002 --> 01:10:37,042
[SPEAKER_07]: And how you could, like, you know... I'll be honest.

830
01:10:37,803 --> 01:10:42,524
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done one screen cap through Swapnote and all the rest of them I pulled off my SD card and put on my Tumblr.

831
01:10:43,164 --> 01:10:43,384
Okay.

832
01:10:45,734 --> 01:10:57,305
[SPEAKER_03]: The ones that are on my fan page on Facebook, I took those on my game and just copied them over because they come across as, I believe, as JPEGs if you don't use the 3D mode.

833
01:10:59,487 --> 01:11:01,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so there you go.

834
01:11:03,591 --> 01:11:05,433
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just very disappointed in this news.

835
01:11:05,513 --> 01:11:07,735
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like every time you think Nintendo gets it,

836
01:11:08,495 --> 01:11:08,996
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't.

837
01:11:09,116 --> 01:11:11,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, by the way, this is still a thing that's going around.

838
01:11:12,557 --> 01:11:17,160
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an app called WeKaraokeU, and I don't believe that's here in the U.S.

839
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:22,003
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's something that's only available in Japan because, you know, karaoke's a little bigger overseas.

840
01:11:22,023 --> 01:11:24,644
[SPEAKER_08]: They only have WeSing or something.

841
01:11:24,724 --> 01:11:26,385
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that has any karaoke in it.

842
01:11:26,545 --> 01:11:27,206
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

843
01:11:48,862 --> 01:11:51,823
[SPEAKER_07]: and people are just making a point out of this.

844
01:11:51,883 --> 01:11:56,905
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like Nintendo, you still can do many adult things if you want to with your console.

845
01:11:56,925 --> 01:12:05,088
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Joy Sound is the karaoke thing and if I remember correctly, I do believe a Joy Sound game has come out over here for the Wii.

846
01:12:05,229 --> 01:12:06,109
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't believe the Wii U yet.

847
01:12:06,129 --> 01:12:07,269
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's on the Wii U yet, yeah.

848
01:12:07,689 --> 01:12:08,510
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I remember that.

849
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:30,496
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's just you know again it's it's a little ridiculous and unfortunately just you know accentuates the reason why Nintendo constantly gets ridiculed for not understanding online and this doesn't make me feel a little more comfortable about their situation sorry to say well all right let's move on with more news DarkSakura

850
01:12:31,302 --> 01:12:36,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel a little bit like I don't want to take from Bobby's interview earlier.

851
01:12:37,552 --> 01:12:38,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Think of it as giving him a cheap plug.

852
01:12:39,477 --> 01:12:49,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I'm actually going to say, everyone, if you want more of the information on this, make sure that you go listen to Bobby's show, which you can download on iTunes and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and VOGnetwork.com.

853
01:12:49,882 --> 01:12:52,203
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but I am going to go ahead and tell you what happened.

854
01:12:53,484 --> 01:13:02,428
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a company called Wadjet Eye, and that's W-A-D-J-E-T, and I love companies with mythological names.

855
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:03,189
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just cool.

856
01:13:04,189 --> 01:13:10,771
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, there was a game put out called Blackwell Deception, and it was put out for free.

857
01:13:10,811 --> 01:13:13,351
[SPEAKER_03]: There were codes that you could download to play the game.

858
01:13:13,731 --> 01:13:19,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, people were taking those free codes and setting them up to resell them, which I think is shitty.

859
01:13:20,533 --> 01:13:23,894
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, they just took them all down and said...

860
01:13:24,574 --> 01:13:26,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, we don't want that to happen.

861
01:13:26,374 --> 01:13:29,355
[SPEAKER_03]: But it wasn't necessarily the codes that went down.

862
01:13:29,395 --> 01:13:30,695
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the page that went down.

863
01:13:30,916 --> 01:13:32,956
[SPEAKER_03]: So, well, the link to the page that went down.

864
01:13:33,056 --> 01:13:35,717
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically people were still going to that and getting all the codes.

865
01:13:36,497 --> 01:13:41,938
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's about 30,000 codes worth of games now that have been removed from Steam.

866
01:13:42,878 --> 01:13:44,459
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe it was 30,000, didn't he say?

867
01:13:44,479 --> 01:13:44,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

868
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:53,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he said this during the interview too, that he just did those last 30,000 from the time he went to bed because he was up for 30 hours because of the situation.

869
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:54,551
[SPEAKER_03]: On his anniversary?

870
01:13:54,571 --> 01:13:55,412
[SPEAKER_03]: That's shitty.

871
01:13:56,293 --> 01:13:57,795
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway...

872
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:08,242
[SPEAKER_03]: It just, I'm not going to say it baffles me that people will abuse the generosity of others because it happens.

873
01:14:08,343 --> 01:14:08,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

874
01:14:09,303 --> 01:14:14,624
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got people who think they can make a profit off of other people, they're going to do it.

875
01:14:14,744 --> 01:14:15,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Humble Bundle.

876
01:14:15,705 --> 01:14:17,005
[SPEAKER_07]: All the time this happens with Humble Bundle.

877
01:14:17,025 --> 01:14:18,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is why that changed.

878
01:14:18,346 --> 01:14:24,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we talked about it on the show that people are eBaying their codes on the Humble Bundle to people that don't know any better.

879
01:14:25,048 --> 01:14:26,048
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really tacky.

880
01:14:28,485 --> 01:14:31,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't just say tacky.

881
01:14:31,647 --> 01:14:35,211
[SPEAKER_03]: I would put it up in the realm of purely unethical.

882
01:14:36,132 --> 01:14:41,116
[SPEAKER_03]: We just have this faction of greedy people, which I'm not going to go into detail on that one.

883
01:14:43,418 --> 01:14:45,280
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that it was...

884
01:14:47,281 --> 01:15:15,412
[SPEAKER_03]: what Dave Gilbert did that was who Bobby interviewed before I think that was purely necessary I think it was the right step to take under the situation and yeah there's people pissed off about it but look at it as the rotten apple spoiling the bunch you have a lot of bad apples spoiling all of it for everybody so if you want to be mad at anybody be mad at the people that were abusing the system not at the person who was the victim of the abuse

885
01:15:17,694 --> 01:15:18,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Steam can pull games from the library

886
01:15:43,975 --> 01:15:46,779
[SPEAKER_03]: But that doesn't stop you from linking your game with your Steam account.

887
01:15:47,099 --> 01:15:51,023
[SPEAKER_03]: You can still run everything through Steam if you want your functionality of Steam with your game.

888
01:15:51,384 --> 01:15:54,528
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you think I get all those pretty cutscene screencaps of Final Fantasy XIV?

889
01:15:54,548 --> 01:15:54,608
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

890
01:15:57,890 --> 01:16:04,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well let's travel around the world and check out some release dates that you can buy and then you can resell if you want.

891
01:16:06,073 --> 01:16:08,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's a little more ethical when you actually bought it in the first place.

892
01:16:09,055 --> 01:16:11,736
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, let's travel around the world and check out release dates and what's coming out soon.

893
01:16:12,496 --> 01:16:16,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so this week we have Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures on 3DS.

894
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:21,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Also the Castlevania Lords of Shadows Collection on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.

895
01:16:23,061 --> 01:16:26,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Moshi Monsters Katsuma Unleashed on 3DS and DS.

896
01:16:26,822 --> 01:16:52,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Call of Duty Ghosts on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 believe it or not the PlayStation 4 and Wii U and PC cause you know you gotta be cool and get those PlayStation 4 discs a week before they come out it's so weird to me, hey look I got this game I'm totally gonna not play it for a week so it's gonna take some getting used to that now we have to throw in PlayStation 4 releases into the mix but I guess this happened before with Wii U yeah

897
01:16:53,754 --> 01:17:09,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Zumba Fitness, World Party on the Wii U, Xbox 360 and Wii, Power Rangers Megaforce on 3DS, The Guided Fate Paradox on PS3, and Ben 10 Omniverse 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Wii U, and 3DS.

898
01:17:17,365 --> 01:17:20,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Frozen on the DS and 3DS and...

899
01:17:25,859 --> 01:17:31,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Last but not least, the Travel Adventures with Hello Kitty on 3DS.

900
01:17:31,964 --> 01:17:32,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yay!

901
01:17:33,145 --> 01:17:34,126
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Game Stick.

902
01:17:34,266 --> 01:17:35,507
[SPEAKER_03]: I should know what I'm getting, Rob.

903
01:17:35,687 --> 01:17:36,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, right?

904
01:17:36,688 --> 01:17:37,589
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, hold off.

905
01:17:37,609 --> 01:17:44,675
[SPEAKER_08]: You gotta wait for Hello Kitty Cruisers or whatever that was, you know, the Mario Kart-esque game.

906
01:17:45,655 --> 01:17:46,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, right, yeah.

907
01:17:47,076 --> 01:17:47,677
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll be fun.

908
01:17:47,697 --> 01:17:49,459
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a budget title, too.

909
01:17:49,479 --> 01:17:49,799
[SPEAKER_07]: 20 bucks.

910
01:17:49,959 --> 01:17:50,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Heck yeah.

911
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:53,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Rob, I think you're worth at least 20 bucks.

912
01:17:53,482 --> 01:17:55,444
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'm covered for Hanukkah.

913
01:17:56,906 --> 01:17:57,767
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's move on.

914
01:17:58,307 --> 01:18:02,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Going to Japan, I would read PlayStation 4 dates, but remember, they're not getting theirs until next year.

915
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:03,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, as well.

916
01:18:03,692 --> 01:18:06,053
[SPEAKER_07]: So we still have a little while before we start getting those dates in Japan.

917
01:18:06,753 --> 01:18:08,854
[SPEAKER_07]: But we can read what's going on on the PlayStation 3.

918
01:18:09,315 --> 01:18:24,001
[SPEAKER_07]: And coming out on November 7th, we have Akiba's Trip 2, Battlefield 4, Book of Spells, NBA 2K14, and Onichambara Z Kagura with No No No comes out.

919
01:18:24,842 --> 01:18:25,742
[SPEAKER_07]: And, oh, Rocksmith 2014.

920
01:18:26,442 --> 01:18:28,884
[SPEAKER_07]: X4 will be happy to hear that Rocksmith 2014 get exposed to Japan as well.

921
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:30,444
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be big in Japan.

922
01:18:30,704 --> 01:18:30,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?

923
01:18:30,884 --> 01:18:31,945
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be big in Japan.

924
01:18:32,265 --> 01:18:32,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it big in Japan?

925
01:18:33,329 --> 01:18:37,281
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how well those series, or how well music games are still doing in Japan.

926
01:18:37,522 --> 01:18:39,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Was Rock Band and those other games really selling in Japan?

927
01:18:40,091 --> 01:18:41,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Rock Band, I don't remember.

928
01:18:42,472 --> 01:18:43,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it did get a release.

929
01:18:43,672 --> 01:18:44,552
[SPEAKER_07]: It did get a release?

930
01:18:44,592 --> 01:18:44,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.

931
01:18:44,872 --> 01:18:46,093
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

932
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:53,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, regardless, if you happen to have a friend in Japan who wants to learn how to play the guitar, Rocksmith 2014 is out this week on November 7th.

933
01:18:53,555 --> 01:18:55,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, you know what I'm suddenly thinking of in my mind?

934
01:18:57,376 --> 01:19:06,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Rock Band Visual K Edition, where it's all like Malice Miser and... I don't think they localized the music or anything when they put it out there, so...

935
01:19:07,339 --> 01:19:08,140
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think it would be fun.

936
01:19:25,662 --> 01:19:49,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Going to the PlayStation Vita Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Battle Destiny Gets a price reduction It's already out But there is a new game called X Tetra Comes out this week On the PlayStation Vita Going to the Wii U this week Nothing But you do get Call of Duty Ghosts next week Since we won't be here next week And Super Mario 3D World in a couple weeks I guess I'll be touching on that again when we come back

937
01:19:50,955 --> 01:20:03,725
[SPEAKER_07]: and on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Metal Max 4, Geku no Diva, Exetetra comes out there as well and there is a Monster Hunter 4 Hunter Pack limited console bundle out this week as well.

938
01:20:04,285 --> 01:20:12,531
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also another Tamagotchi game, Seishun no Dream School comes out on the 3DS this week and that does it for Japanese releases.

939
01:20:12,892 --> 01:20:14,093
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, how about the UK?

940
01:20:15,292 --> 01:20:32,659
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a few things in the UK on the 6th we have Call of Duty Ghost for practically everything and Castle Storm for the Sony consoles on the 7th is Wii Sports Club and the 8th is Mario and Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games the end

941
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:33,500
[SPEAKER_07]: The end.

942
01:20:34,141 --> 01:20:37,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwolf bringing some clarity in chat with Rock Band Japan.

943
01:20:37,865 --> 01:20:40,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Blackwolf says Rock Band Japan was a thing that failed in development.

944
01:20:41,228 --> 01:20:43,130
[SPEAKER_07]: They talked about it at their PAX East panel.

945
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:45,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Licensing was a mess and they wound up giving up on it.

946
01:20:46,173 --> 01:20:52,679
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought they got some version of Rock Band in Japan, but maybe it's just, you know, maybe they got our version subtitled.

947
01:20:52,759 --> 01:20:54,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, licensing was probably a mess.

948
01:20:55,182 --> 01:21:03,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the import store that I see Japanese releases on, maybe they were kind of going the other way and helping Japan get the English version if they so wanted.

949
01:21:03,547 --> 01:21:04,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

950
01:21:26,852 --> 01:21:53,347
[SPEAKER_08]: but nope Ubisoft decided hey you know what we're gonna put a brand new online pass I'm sorry you play passport um that's gonna be part of Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag and then that you know not only will grant you access I guess to the online portions of the game but it also locks away the game's fleet management system that was part of the single player campaign

951
01:21:54,998 --> 01:21:55,839
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

952
01:22:09,474 --> 01:22:10,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Ubisoft decided, hey, you know what?

953
01:22:11,455 --> 01:22:12,375
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to get rid of it.

954
01:22:12,635 --> 01:22:14,816
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to actually start now with Assassin's Creed 4.

955
01:22:15,436 --> 01:22:19,497
[SPEAKER_08]: So they went ahead and they're going to... I was giving them applause.

956
01:22:20,138 --> 01:22:22,198
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to now have that code.

957
01:22:22,238 --> 01:22:35,403
[SPEAKER_08]: You still have to get the code for the Uplay Passport, but it'll be a free download that you just go to PlayStation Network or the Xbox Live Marketplace and you just download it.

958
01:22:35,703 --> 01:22:38,284
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically it allows you to do that for free.

959
01:22:38,824 --> 01:22:40,645
[SPEAKER_08]: and they're not going to have it in any future games.

960
01:22:40,825 --> 01:22:51,548
[SPEAKER_08]: It says the Uplay Passport was initiated as a means of giving customers full access and support for online multiplayer and features along with exclusive content, bonuses and rewards.

961
01:22:52,048 --> 01:22:58,470
[SPEAKER_08]: However, games today are blurring the lines between offline and online between single player and Wiz multiplayer.

962
01:22:59,130 --> 01:22:59,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, man.

963
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:01,170
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a single player campaign.

964
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:02,871
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no blurring anything there.

965
01:23:03,831 --> 01:23:24,118
[SPEAKER_08]: and based on that and feedback we received we recognize that the passport is no longer the best approach maybe just because people are calling you out and you're fucking money grubbing you know tactics is what it is you know yeah it's not the approach so now we're just gonna have to microtransaction everything to be continued is basically what I the way I see it so um

966
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:26,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Good on them, I guess.

967
01:23:27,035 --> 01:23:31,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we only have to get on Warner Games and Deep Silver.

968
01:23:31,758 --> 01:23:35,641
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, seriously, what the fuck with Saints Row 4?

969
01:23:36,742 --> 01:23:39,284
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought we were done with that when THQ went out of business.

970
01:23:40,845 --> 01:23:44,328
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it's not Deep Silver, I'm going to blame Volition, those motherfuckers.

971
01:23:45,769 --> 01:23:50,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Here I thought it was THQ forcing them to hoard the DLC for that game.

972
01:23:51,293 --> 01:23:52,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope, it was them.

973
01:23:52,874 --> 01:23:53,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Blame the devs.

974
01:23:55,367 --> 01:24:07,974
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, before we get to the classic game of the week, this is, I don't know, words escape me, and I think a lot of us, again, here's another story this week where a lot of us kind of looked at this and went, like, how can this happen?

975
01:24:08,034 --> 01:24:09,094
[SPEAKER_07]: This is awful.

976
01:24:10,475 --> 01:24:17,799
[SPEAKER_07]: During this weekend, a lot of folks out there were participating in a charity fundraiser known as Extra Life, which is a video game fundraiser.

977
01:24:17,839 --> 01:24:20,380
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Gamers Doing Good, which is the stuff we like to report on.

978
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:23,042
[SPEAKER_07]: It's raising money for the Children's Miracle Network Hospital.

979
01:24:23,682 --> 01:24:30,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, during the fundraiser, the website for Extra Life came under a DDoS attack, which is what?

980
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:31,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Denial of Service?

981
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:33,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Directed Denial of Service.

982
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:40,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Directed Denial of Service attack, basically meaning a bunch of people hitting it all at once to try and take it down.

983
01:24:40,121 --> 01:24:44,166
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the first thought that comes with this is, well, was it just too popular and all these people were trying to hit it?

984
01:24:44,506 --> 01:24:44,786
[SPEAKER_07]: BlackWolf.com

985
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:37,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever, alright Anyway Whatever it stands for It's a pretty shitty thing to do to a charity organization Especially when it's gamers trying to do good And, you know, all these people were trying to donate And they couldn't through the site Because everybody that's doing the stream is trying to point people to the site And, you know, they couldn't make the donations So, you know, obviously there was a lot of pissed off people online About, like, how could somebody be so shitty to take down a charity And

986
01:25:37,638 --> 01:26:02,666
[SPEAKER_07]: and I have a couple schools of thought on this is that one there's shitty people out there period and you know just like we had an unfortunate horrible incident in the real world where a guy went and shot a guy at the airport and shut down LAX for a few hours like how could somebody be that shitty you know there are shitty people out there and we have to do whatever we can to you know stop these people whether that's through getting help or through you know whatever but

987
01:26:03,486 --> 01:26:15,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I, I, I'm just curious what there is to gain from taking this down because I can't think there would be an internet organization out there that would be like, heck yeah, we screwed over all these sick kids.

988
01:26:16,257 --> 01:26:18,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Like who would want to take pride in that?

989
01:26:18,619 --> 01:26:19,340
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure.

990
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,862
[SPEAKER_03]: There are people who enjoy being assholes.

991
01:26:22,502 --> 01:26:22,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

992
01:26:23,023 --> 01:26:31,410
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, I think it could be, and I don't want to sound like too tinfoil hatty, but it could honestly be a cyber terrorist organization.

993
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:37,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it could be someone who has a vested interest in making gamers look bad.

994
01:26:37,983 --> 01:26:39,204
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds like a script kidding to me.

995
01:26:40,145 --> 01:26:50,093
[SPEAKER_07]: You think it was just one crazy person that went... I think it's some juvenile kid that's like... My other thought was that maybe they were trying to intercept the credit cards somehow.

996
01:26:50,674 --> 01:26:54,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, but I don't know how you... But I would think, you know, again...

997
01:26:56,178 --> 01:27:24,800
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this whole situation is shitty and I feel shitty for even going here but is it possible that somebody was after the credit card transactions and somebody wanted to get all these instant credit card numbers and things coming in in a very short amount of time people wanted access to that you wouldn't DDOS a site to do that though that would be like installing a Trojan or something or somehow getting access to their database or something DDOSing something is not going to really do anything as far as I'm aware

998
01:27:25,126 --> 01:27:27,490
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think anyone's laughing.

999
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:27,570
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1000
01:27:42,128 --> 01:27:52,273
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one thing when maybe they take down CNN.com or hack an LA Times article to say butts, butts, butts, butts or whatever they do.

1001
01:27:52,413 --> 01:27:53,493
[SPEAKER_07]: That's hilarious.

1002
01:27:53,993 --> 01:27:55,074
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one thing.

1003
01:27:55,714 --> 01:28:01,636
[SPEAKER_07]: But charity organization raising money for sick kids, I don't think anybody's going to laugh at that.

1004
01:28:01,656 --> 01:28:02,837
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just a special kind of dickery.

1005
01:28:03,237 --> 01:28:03,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1006
01:28:04,337 --> 01:28:08,739
[SPEAKER_08]: That's exactly the kind of... Well, the whole butts thing is an awesome dickery thing that you could do.

1007
01:28:08,779 --> 01:28:12,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Just macro every single key on your keyboard to type butts when you type it.

1008
01:28:14,141 --> 01:28:16,822
[SPEAKER_07]: BlackWolf says, I think the people who did it were laughing.

1009
01:28:17,342 --> 01:28:26,466
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's important to make sure that if they're laughing, which, again, what sick individuals would be laughing at this particular situation?

1010
01:28:26,866 --> 01:28:31,568
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's important that if, for whatever reason, we know these people, we hang out with these people, we talk to these people...

1011
01:28:32,428 --> 01:28:46,375
[SPEAKER_07]: um that we let them know they're sick for laughing at this but if you if you endorse this or you laugh at it too then that's just encouraging it to happen and I think you need to kind of put your foot down and be like this is not okay

1012
01:28:47,648 --> 01:28:48,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was an attention grab.

1013
01:28:49,788 --> 01:28:55,329
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously, the reason why people do asshole things like that is because they know it's going to rile someone up.

1014
01:28:55,369 --> 01:28:56,409
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the worst kind of troll.

1015
01:28:57,290 --> 01:29:01,990
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's why I don't give PETA any attention anymore.

1016
01:29:02,491 --> 01:29:11,072
[SPEAKER_03]: It's why I hate bringing... I mean, yeah, it's a big thing and definitely needs to be spoken out against, but I also don't want to give these people the time of day.

1017
01:29:11,172 --> 01:29:16,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to think that all of us and the people who listen to our show wouldn't hang around that kind of person.

1018
01:29:16,553 --> 01:29:16,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1019
01:29:17,313 --> 01:29:22,016
[SPEAKER_07]: So I definitely... That's why I'm not sitting here going, if you're the person that did this, you're an asshole.

1020
01:29:22,036 --> 01:29:24,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm like, no, that person's not listening to this program.

1021
01:29:25,058 --> 01:29:28,261
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would like to think that our listeners are decent people who have good taste.

1022
01:29:28,381 --> 01:29:29,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

1023
01:29:29,662 --> 01:29:35,526
[SPEAKER_03]: And definitely at least a higher level of ethics than these people do.

1024
01:29:37,375 --> 01:29:39,455
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is a small world.

1025
01:29:39,595 --> 01:29:40,656
[SPEAKER_07]: I learn that every day.

1026
01:29:40,936 --> 01:29:46,717
[SPEAKER_07]: And even though you might not know somebody directly who is involved with this, you might know someone that knows someone.

1027
01:29:47,437 --> 01:29:52,698
[SPEAKER_07]: So be that change and let people know it's not funny and it's not okay.

1028
01:29:53,198 --> 01:29:54,018
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway.

1029
01:29:55,018 --> 01:29:55,318
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1030
01:29:56,179 --> 01:29:56,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on.

1031
01:29:56,839 --> 01:30:02,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on to happier things such as gaming history and the things that brought us to where we are today.

1032
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:12,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Every week here on the show, DarkSakura likes to take a step into the classic gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you kids out there, you should be playing this video game.

1033
01:30:13,165 --> 01:30:13,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1034
01:30:13,806 --> 01:30:16,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop learning how to put butts on the LA Times.

1035
01:30:16,487 --> 01:30:17,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1036
01:30:17,487 --> 01:30:18,848
[SPEAKER_07]: And play this classic game.

1037
01:30:19,589 --> 01:30:21,149
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1038
01:30:21,469 --> 01:30:24,191
[SPEAKER_03]: The classic game of the week is Shin Megami Tensei.

1039
01:30:24,870 --> 01:30:26,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, you'll make a lot of friends with that choice.

1040
01:30:27,132 --> 01:30:28,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

1041
01:30:28,713 --> 01:30:44,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, I have to say that as I have not spoken to my dear friend who is such a fan of this game, Catastrophic Magi, on Steam for a while, I dedicate this one to you because you were the one who introduced me to the series as in-depth as I know it now.

1042
01:30:46,549 --> 01:31:00,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Shin Megami Tensei means True Goddess Reincarnation and I am referring to the first one that came out on October 30th 1992 for the Super Famicom and it is based off of Megami Tensei which is a novel and Famicom game.

1043
01:31:01,972 --> 01:31:08,734
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is the first of the series at least in the Shin Megami Tensei series to be put out by Atlus.

1044
01:31:09,774 --> 01:31:16,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, this one in particular starts off, um, it's a first person RPG.

1045
01:31:17,237 --> 01:31:21,079
[SPEAKER_03]: So, in fact it actually is a lot like a, what was the series, Wizardry.

1046
01:31:21,759 --> 01:31:30,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so you go through different dungeons and you have up to six characters and it's turn based, um, uh, a field of vision.

1047
01:31:30,103 --> 01:31:32,484
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically you walk up to the corner, you turn the corner.

1048
01:31:33,404 --> 01:31:34,825
[SPEAKER_03]: You have two types of characters.

1049
01:31:34,845 --> 01:31:36,186
[SPEAKER_03]: You have humans and demons.

1050
01:31:36,906 --> 01:31:39,068
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to collect demons like Pokemans.

1051
01:31:40,389 --> 01:31:46,672
[SPEAKER_03]: So your human will acquire the demon by either negotiating, bribing, or coercion during a battle.

1052
01:31:47,113 --> 01:31:55,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once you have them, you can store them in your computer and summon them for money to use in battle.

1053
01:31:55,918 --> 01:31:59,220
[SPEAKER_03]: And they feed off of a secondary currency called magnetite.

1054
01:32:01,002 --> 01:32:06,123
[SPEAKER_03]: So if your demon is defeated in battle, then they have to be revived.

1055
01:32:06,143 --> 01:32:08,924
[SPEAKER_03]: So like I said, it's got that Pokemon element to it.

1056
01:32:10,504 --> 01:32:22,407
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a method of controlling multiple demons by calling Akuma Gattai, which is demon fusion.

1057
01:32:22,527 --> 01:32:29,329
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can basically use, you can combine your demons to be like this powerful gestalt.

1058
01:32:30,309 --> 01:32:39,775
[SPEAKER_03]: You also have firearms, you have special ammo that goes with it, melee weapons, you have armor, you have only certain things that can be wielded by certain alignments.

1059
01:32:40,175 --> 01:32:43,618
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as your demons go, each of them have their own different statistics.

1060
01:32:43,638 --> 01:32:45,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, it's kind of Pokemon-like.

1061
01:32:46,219 --> 01:33:00,212
[SPEAKER_03]: um you have they all have permanent um abilities in this game that changes with the later two and they can't uh yeah be changed at all so um with this your your demons are um

1062
01:33:03,109 --> 01:33:09,731
[SPEAKER_03]: are basically your tools for fighting in the game along with your regular armaments.

1063
01:33:09,751 --> 01:33:11,792
[SPEAKER_03]: You have different types.

1064
01:33:12,072 --> 01:33:15,253
[SPEAKER_03]: You have pixies.

1065
01:33:15,473 --> 01:33:16,673
[SPEAKER_03]: You have angels.

1066
01:33:16,833 --> 01:33:20,654
[SPEAKER_03]: You have all kinds of... You have ghouls.

1067
01:33:20,674 --> 01:33:21,655
[SPEAKER_03]: You have all kinds of different ones.

1068
01:33:22,135 --> 01:33:24,836
[SPEAKER_03]: So the alignment of your demons are two different types.

1069
01:33:24,876 --> 01:33:25,156
[SPEAKER_03]: You have...

1070
01:33:27,097 --> 01:33:30,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Light Neutral Dark and Law Neutral Chaos.

1071
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:34,823
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically it's kind of a D&D style alignment system.

1072
01:33:35,283 --> 01:33:41,488
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can have True Neutral, you can have Chaotic Dark, which I guess would be like Chaotic Evil.

1073
01:33:41,648 --> 01:33:43,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Law is associated with God, Order, and Peace.

1074
01:33:44,651 --> 01:33:48,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Chaos is with the Devil and Freedom and War.

1075
01:33:48,994 --> 01:33:52,056
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Balance is the Neutral one too.

1076
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:56,320
[SPEAKER_03]: So your human characters also have alignments as well.

1077
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:59,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I'm not going to go too much into the stories.

1078
01:33:59,301 --> 01:34:03,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, it's demons on Earth, and they're changing the balance of power, and you have to stop them.

1079
01:34:04,742 --> 01:34:08,683
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have your characters, you have your hero that you name yourself.

1080
01:34:10,444 --> 01:34:18,166
[SPEAKER_03]: In sort of the game Apocrypha, there has been a name given of Kazuya in the Steven Report 1.

1081
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:24,385
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a heroine, which in that same thing she was given the name Yuka.

1082
01:34:24,866 --> 01:34:34,197
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a law hero, a chaos hero, you have a girl named Yuriko, you have Steven, which is a disabled computer programmer who writes the demon summoning program.

1083
01:34:35,545 --> 01:34:56,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Goto, Ozawa, and then you have just a bunch of characters in this game I'm not going to go into it but those are like the major characters it also was imported later on for the PC Engine Super CD-ROM and Mega CD and then re-released for PlayStation and Game Boy Advance to build hype for Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne

1084
01:34:57,963 --> 01:34:59,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Fumitsu gave it a 30 out of 40.

1085
01:34:59,143 --> 01:35:02,825
[SPEAKER_03]: The original version got a 36 out of 40 from Fumitsu.

1086
01:35:02,845 --> 01:35:03,426
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also a manga spinoff.

1087
01:35:03,446 --> 01:35:04,226
[SPEAKER_03]: It's out in English.

1088
01:35:14,052 --> 01:35:33,882
[SPEAKER_03]: all kinds of stuff and of course we have so many different games now in the series that have come out in English that anyone can enjoy it but I do know for a fact that there's a translated ROM out of the first one so you can find it and play it through whatever means you deem necessary and that's it

1089
01:35:38,698 --> 01:35:39,579
[SPEAKER_03]: and Shin Megami Tensei.

1090
01:36:02,002 --> 01:36:19,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we're going to take a quick break here and when we come back there's plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come including the Fugle Question of the Week, some rapid fire news and your emails and your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR and yeah, all that's coming up when we come back after a quick break here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1091
01:36:26,136 --> 01:36:35,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this Sunday evening, November the 3rd, 2013 with episode number 526 of our show.

1092
01:36:36,699 --> 01:36:43,860
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were talking a lot about kind of like this generation of gaming earlier on in the show because we're not going to be here next week.

1093
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:45,521
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we are back in two weeks...

1094
01:36:46,428 --> 01:36:47,689
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation 4 will be out.

1095
01:36:47,770 --> 01:36:50,072
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the week after that, the Xbox One will be out.

1096
01:36:50,172 --> 01:36:57,361
[SPEAKER_07]: So we will be living in the next gaming generation and it'll be interesting to see what the reception is of those systems when they launch.

1097
01:36:57,641 --> 01:36:59,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised you didn't play my generation.

1098
01:36:59,871 --> 01:37:01,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, maybe at the end.

1099
01:37:01,312 --> 01:37:01,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1100
01:37:02,013 --> 01:37:02,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe at the end.

1101
01:37:03,514 --> 01:37:11,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we always do little break songs here at the Voice of Geeks Network where we do tape live, of course, Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

1102
01:37:12,079 --> 01:37:14,801
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I hope some night you'll be able to check us out live.

1103
01:37:15,622 --> 01:37:17,163
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we're up against The Walking Dead.

1104
01:37:17,643 --> 01:37:45,967
[SPEAKER_07]: or some award show usually or whatever's going on but you know you could always TiVo those shows but I also know that some people just wait and download us on the podcast which is just fine too we appreciate all you guys that stop and check us out and I'll say this again at the end of the show but we do always appreciate any feedback you guys leave us helping us to spread the word about our show you know whether that be on iTunes like a nice five star review or you know liking us on Facebook and sharing the page or

1105
01:37:46,327 --> 01:37:50,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you guys know this, Stitcher now does the reviews and the star ratings.

1106
01:37:50,830 --> 01:37:59,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Stitcher is a great app as well that's gotten a lot of people to be able to access our show without having to worry about downloading and syncing podcasts.

1107
01:37:59,495 --> 01:38:01,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Stitcher is a great application.

1108
01:38:02,717 --> 01:38:02,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

1109
01:38:03,678 --> 01:38:13,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom says, speaking of award shows tonight, Bobby Blackwolf says, you were up against the YouTube Music Awards, but apparently those were a big old bag of dicks.

1110
01:38:14,625 --> 01:38:17,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Best Lyric of Our Generation, Chao Ma Ma Ma Main

1111
01:38:42,146 --> 01:38:42,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1112
01:38:43,047 --> 01:38:48,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about South Park.

1113
01:38:48,972 --> 01:38:51,554
[SPEAKER_08]: South Park, seriously, what's going on with you?

1114
01:38:52,975 --> 01:38:57,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Delayed till March, unfortunately.

1115
01:38:59,441 --> 01:39:03,905
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was so hoping that it would come out in December because there was nothing coming out in December, but

1116
01:39:05,526 --> 01:39:10,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and just because it's not done yet, really.

1117
01:39:10,430 --> 01:39:12,792
[SPEAKER_08]: And they showed some gameplay, and I thought it was pretty cool.

1118
01:39:12,993 --> 01:39:15,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm very much looking forward to this game.

1119
01:39:15,335 --> 01:39:18,517
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a little disappointed about the delay, but, you know, get it right.

1120
01:39:18,658 --> 01:39:19,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Take the time you need to get it right.

1121
01:39:19,779 --> 01:39:20,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't rush it.

1122
01:39:20,839 --> 01:39:21,280
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine.

1123
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:25,123
[SPEAKER_07]: When the game comes out, finally, we'll all forget about the delay, so it inevitably happens.

1124
01:39:25,784 --> 01:39:26,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, Grand Theft Auto fans?

1125
01:39:26,885 --> 01:39:27,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1126
01:39:28,826 --> 01:39:33,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of Grand Theft Auto V, 29 million fans have already forgiven it.

1127
01:39:34,008 --> 01:39:38,930
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's already shipped to retail, but they pretty much sold.

1128
01:39:40,011 --> 01:39:43,412
[SPEAKER_08]: And that means, and that's within six weeks.

1129
01:39:44,973 --> 01:39:50,735
[SPEAKER_08]: So a couple more weeks, it will have outsold Grand Theft Auto IV's lifetime sales.

1130
01:39:51,335 --> 01:39:53,276
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's not bad for six weeks.

1131
01:39:55,020 --> 01:40:03,463
[SPEAKER_08]: And last but not least, something I'm kind of excited about, The Seventh Guest 3 is going to be a possible game that will be coming out.

1132
01:40:03,983 --> 01:40:05,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Full motion video and all.

1133
01:40:05,484 --> 01:40:10,105
[SPEAKER_08]: The Seventh Guest, if you're not aware, is a pretty old PC game.

1134
01:40:10,145 --> 01:40:10,986
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a puzzle game.

1135
01:40:11,366 --> 01:40:12,126
[SPEAKER_03]: And the 11th hour.

1136
01:40:12,446 --> 01:40:14,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, the 11th hour of the second game in the series.

1137
01:40:15,687 --> 01:40:17,067
[SPEAKER_08]: They're trying to kickstart a third.

1138
01:40:17,167 --> 01:40:18,427
[SPEAKER_08]: They're looking for $435,000.

1139
01:40:19,467 --> 01:40:25,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, is there a reward tier level where I can be in the game in one of those cheesy full motion videos?

1140
01:40:26,049 --> 01:40:27,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's kind of awesome if so.

1141
01:40:28,789 --> 01:40:30,729
[SPEAKER_07]: If I had money, I would so want to do that.

1142
01:40:31,550 --> 01:40:32,010
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1143
01:40:32,410 --> 01:40:33,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me check.

1144
01:40:33,170 --> 01:40:34,870
[SPEAKER_08]: They're at $39,000 right now and they have 35 days to go and

1145
01:40:39,852 --> 01:40:45,200
[SPEAKER_07]: It would like literally be my dream to be one of those corny full motion video actors in one of these games.

1146
01:40:46,462 --> 01:40:49,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, $1,000 gets your name on an object in the mansion.

1147
01:40:51,088 --> 01:40:55,275
[SPEAKER_08]: $5,000, your name and likeness in a painting or photograph in the mansion.

1148
01:40:55,888 --> 01:40:58,611
[SPEAKER_03]: You could be in the game, Rob.

1149
01:40:58,791 --> 01:41:01,334
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not the same.

1150
01:41:01,354 --> 01:41:01,334
$7,500.

1151
01:41:02,956 --> 01:41:06,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Scary animated portrait of you in the mansion and producer in-game credit.

1152
01:41:07,941 --> 01:41:10,604
[SPEAKER_08]: And no, there is not a way to be an actual...

1153
01:41:13,242 --> 01:41:19,828
[SPEAKER_07]: How can I campaign to be one of the cheesy full motion video actors in the game?

1154
01:41:20,088 --> 01:41:32,619
[SPEAKER_08]: You would have to probably contact the creator and just give them lots of money and say, hey, can I forego all those things that be actually in the game as a character?

1155
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:33,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1156
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:34,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1157
01:41:35,959 --> 01:41:36,319
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1158
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:37,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1159
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:42,023
[SPEAKER_07]: So if anybody behind that game and that Kickstarter is listening, we'd love to get you on for an interview.

1160
01:41:42,123 --> 01:41:42,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Wink, wink.

1161
01:41:42,763 --> 01:41:44,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Or maybe I can hassle you about being in the game.

1162
01:41:44,544 --> 01:41:44,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Wink, wink.

1163
01:41:45,145 --> 01:41:45,405
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1164
01:41:46,386 --> 01:41:47,406
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do it just as Frank.

1165
01:41:47,886 --> 01:41:48,767
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1166
01:41:48,827 --> 01:41:49,127
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1167
01:41:49,547 --> 01:41:49,868
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1168
01:41:50,528 --> 01:41:51,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

1169
01:41:51,469 --> 01:41:56,532
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm being a little bit reductive here talking about something I already talked about earlier in the show, but I will mention.

1170
01:41:57,032 --> 01:41:58,233
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1171
01:42:16,733 --> 01:42:18,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't Steam always have a Christmas sale?

1172
01:42:19,035 --> 01:42:21,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, excuse me, a winter holiday sale or whatever at the end of the year?

1173
01:42:21,897 --> 01:42:25,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so, you know, if you really... It is almost Decemberween.

1174
01:42:25,259 --> 01:42:28,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, if you really have to get it cheap, you have that to look forward to.

1175
01:42:29,202 --> 01:42:32,445
[SPEAKER_07]: But honestly, it's still worth even $20 if you want to play it right now.

1176
01:42:33,065 --> 01:42:33,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

1177
01:42:33,806 --> 01:42:35,187
[SPEAKER_07]: And, yeah, there it is.

1178
01:42:35,287 --> 01:42:36,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Typing of the Dead Overkill, it is out.

1179
01:42:37,288 --> 01:42:43,172
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll give a cheap plug for my YouTube channel one more time, Rob Roberts Plays, and you can watch me actually play the first hour or so of the game.

1180
01:42:44,934 --> 01:42:52,598
[SPEAKER_07]: It has been announced that the male Wii Fit trainer will also be a playable character in Smash Brothers for Wii U and the 3DS.

1181
01:42:53,398 --> 01:42:59,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like you have, I don't know, you kind of have like Zelda and Sheik are kind of the same, but not really, you know.

1182
01:43:00,142 --> 01:43:01,662
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what they're kind of doing with the trainers.

1183
01:43:02,043 --> 01:43:02,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Model swap.

1184
01:43:02,923 --> 01:43:06,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the male Wii Fit trainer is the exact same character as the female one.

1185
01:43:06,485 --> 01:43:09,026
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like a, it's a costume swap of sorts.

1186
01:43:09,507 --> 01:43:11,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I am so looking forward to beating people up with Power of Yoga.

1187
01:43:12,652 --> 01:43:17,616
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would have been cooler if they just left the male trainer out.

1188
01:43:17,856 --> 01:43:20,919
[SPEAKER_08]: I know they're just trying to pad the roster, but whatever.

1189
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:21,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, neat.

1190
01:43:34,850 --> 01:43:43,353
[SPEAKER_07]: And it would be kind of neat for those two versus two matches to like, you know, you could play Wii Fit Trainer versus Wii Fit Trainer, but you guys actually look different and it's not just a palette swap.

1191
01:43:43,433 --> 01:43:45,134
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of neat for what it is.

1192
01:43:45,874 --> 01:43:47,735
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, little news piece there.

1193
01:43:47,915 --> 01:43:51,297
[SPEAKER_07]: And lastly, a follow-up to an interview we had a couple weeks ago.

1194
01:43:51,337 --> 01:43:56,579
[SPEAKER_07]: You might remember that we had the guy behind Retro Magazine, that Kickstarter, was here on the show.

1195
01:43:56,919 --> 01:43:58,159
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's with Game Gavel as well.

1196
01:43:58,439 --> 01:43:59,720
[SPEAKER_07]: SoCal Mike was what he went by.

1197
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:24,422
[SPEAKER_07]: and he was trying to raise the money there for Retro Magazine and was having a little bit of a hard time getting coverage because apparently a lot of commercial websites won't run the story because it's competitive and I guess I didn't really realize this but it should be obvious that in these commercial for-profit blogs and things they literally have anti-competitive clauses they will not run a piece that could promote something that competes against it and

1198
01:44:24,542 --> 01:44:25,023
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1199
01:44:46,903 --> 01:44:47,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Now hire me

1200
01:45:04,728 --> 01:45:08,649
[SPEAKER_07]: They ended up with $75,000 altogether.

1201
01:45:09,169 --> 01:45:13,470
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe that was going to cover a couple of the stretch goals.

1202
01:45:14,110 --> 01:45:15,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Dang, look at all these people here.

1203
01:45:15,631 --> 01:45:18,011
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to find it.

1204
01:45:18,131 --> 01:45:24,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, $62,000 was met, meaning everyone gets a collectible sticker with the first print issue and there will be an increased page count.

1205
01:45:24,973 --> 01:45:25,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1206
01:45:25,414 --> 01:45:26,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, hire me.

1207
01:45:27,916 --> 01:45:28,116
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1208
01:45:28,436 --> 01:45:28,717
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1209
01:45:29,077 --> 01:45:31,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, yeah, so congrats to Retro Magazine.

1210
01:45:31,399 --> 01:45:32,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I look forward to having my first issue.

1211
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:33,401
[SPEAKER_07]: I did back it.

1212
01:45:33,601 --> 01:45:37,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I kicked back like $35 or so, just enough to get the year subscription to the magazine.

1213
01:45:37,705 --> 01:45:43,290
[SPEAKER_07]: So I look forward to having that strewn on my kitchen table where we table LR very soon.

1214
01:45:43,726 --> 01:45:46,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Along with Kid Icarus Rising and, uh, what's that pink thing?

1215
01:45:47,189 --> 01:45:49,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, what, this man bag of Alice?

1216
01:45:49,391 --> 01:45:50,532
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I know what the man bag is.

1217
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:53,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, this is a little game called Pink Hijinx that I got.

1218
01:45:53,935 --> 01:45:56,817
[SPEAKER_07]: It was in my Gamer X loot bag that I just haven't played yet.

1219
01:45:56,857 --> 01:45:58,258
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like this game involving little pink pyramids.

1220
01:45:58,278 --> 01:46:01,861
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was a pink Tootsie Roll, I mean, Tootsie, uh, Hershey Kiss at first.

1221
01:46:01,881 --> 01:46:03,683
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I would have eaten it if that was the case.

1222
01:46:03,723 --> 01:46:04,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Mmm, chocolate.

1223
01:46:04,664 --> 01:46:05,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Mmm, chocolate.

1224
01:46:05,384 --> 01:46:07,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyway, less chocolate, more news.

1225
01:46:08,564 --> 01:46:09,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we do have some news.

1226
01:46:09,965 --> 01:46:13,607
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a hack into the Pokemans.

1227
01:46:14,348 --> 01:46:20,072
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are two mega evolutions were released.

1228
01:46:21,173 --> 01:46:23,114
[SPEAKER_03]: We have, let's see what they are.

1229
01:46:24,735 --> 01:46:29,478
[SPEAKER_03]: It was released by Smilam, who created the first homebrew portal game for the DS.

1230
01:46:30,019 --> 01:46:32,901
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is a mega evolution for Latios and Latias.

1231
01:46:35,963 --> 01:46:37,684
[SPEAKER_03]: They are ugly.

1232
01:46:41,894 --> 01:46:44,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what they're called, but they're kind of butt ugly.

1233
01:46:44,738 --> 01:46:47,462
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, if you look online and find them, see if you care.

1234
01:46:48,343 --> 01:46:53,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there is an ESRB rating saying that Gradius V might be going to PS3.

1235
01:46:53,851 --> 01:46:56,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, I freaking love me some Gradius V, but that game is some hard shit.

1236
01:46:57,956 --> 01:46:59,777
[SPEAKER_03]: But that would be awesome.

1237
01:47:00,317 --> 01:47:02,758
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a T for Teen rating on it.

1238
01:47:03,418 --> 01:47:05,019
[SPEAKER_03]: So who knows?

1239
01:47:05,639 --> 01:47:07,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to see it there.

1240
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:12,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe with some goodies, like maybe doing Gradius 2 as a throw-in, you know, because Gradius 2 is the best.

1241
01:47:13,643 --> 01:47:15,643
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Steam has hit a milestone.

1242
01:47:16,404 --> 01:47:18,585
[SPEAKER_03]: 65 million active users.

1243
01:47:20,425 --> 01:47:21,486
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of people, Rob.

1244
01:47:21,626 --> 01:47:22,827
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a country.

1245
01:47:23,587 --> 01:47:24,187
[SPEAKER_03]: A small country.

1246
01:47:24,947 --> 01:47:26,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a medium-sized country, I'd say.

1247
01:47:26,567 --> 01:47:27,147
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a lot.

1248
01:47:27,507 --> 01:47:27,988
[SPEAKER_07]: That's people.

1249
01:47:29,068 --> 01:47:29,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Way to go, Steam.

1250
01:47:31,169 --> 01:47:31,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.

1251
01:47:33,250 --> 01:47:33,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Congrats.

1252
01:47:33,830 --> 01:47:34,550
[SPEAKER_07]: The winner is you.

1253
01:47:34,770 --> 01:47:35,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Mazel tov.

1254
01:47:35,571 --> 01:47:37,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't they say that that's bigger than Xbox Live now?

1255
01:47:38,012 --> 01:47:38,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1256
01:47:38,412 --> 01:47:38,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, wow.

1257
01:47:39,592 --> 01:47:39,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.

1258
01:47:40,533 --> 01:47:42,974
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week, ladies and gentlemen.

1259
01:47:50,626 --> 01:47:54,591
[SPEAKER_07]: You take Facebook, you take Google+, you slam those words together, you get FOOGLE!

1260
01:47:54,891 --> 01:48:07,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, by the way, I'm happy to announce, you can reach our Facebook page at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, but you can now reach our Google Plus page at google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.

1261
01:48:08,208 --> 01:48:08,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1262
01:48:25,064 --> 01:48:26,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Do those things that Google users do.

1263
01:48:27,807 --> 01:48:29,348
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I figure out what that is, I'll let you know.

1264
01:48:29,368 --> 01:48:29,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kidding.

1265
01:48:30,289 --> 01:48:32,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's... You answer Fugle Questions of the Week.

1266
01:48:32,932 --> 01:48:33,472
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you do.

1267
01:48:33,492 --> 01:48:41,019
[SPEAKER_07]: And this week's Fugle Question of the Week is probably similar to something we asked before, admittedly, when these systems were first announced.

1268
01:48:41,139 --> 01:48:41,359
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

1269
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:46,883
[SPEAKER_07]: With us not having a show on 11.10, the next time we have a live show, the PlayStation 4 will be out.

1270
01:48:47,003 --> 01:48:52,266
[SPEAKER_07]: So, this is the last unofficial poll to see what systems our listeners are getting this holiday season.

1271
01:48:52,766 --> 01:49:07,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you or do you plan to buy before the end of the year a PlayStation 4, an Xbox One, a Wii U, a 3DS or a Vita, because you know that Zelda XL's got some people re-buying a 3DS or buying one for the first time, or something else or none of the above?

1272
01:49:07,895 --> 01:49:08,636
[SPEAKER_07]: And why?

1273
01:49:08,976 --> 01:49:10,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you ultimately decide the way you did?

1274
01:49:11,378 --> 01:49:19,543
[SPEAKER_07]: I will try to read everybody's answers, but some of the longer ones I'm going to cut really short just for time's sake because we did get a lot of answers tonight and I don't want to go on forever.

1275
01:49:19,583 --> 01:49:23,826
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope you'll understand and read all the answers in their entirety at Facebook or Google+.

1276
01:49:24,746 --> 01:49:27,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Redertainment says, due to project buy a house?

1277
01:49:28,008 --> 01:49:28,689
[SPEAKER_07]: None of the above.

1278
01:49:30,001 --> 01:49:54,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Soutour says none of the above because the PlayStation 3 and Gran Turismo 6 is enough for me for now Sam H says none of the above I have too many current gen games to go buy and play E3VL says already pre-ordered the PlayStation 4 since it's the cheaper console May purchase the Xbox One after it has a price drop to play the exclusives

1279
01:49:55,832 --> 01:49:59,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft says, I plan on getting a Wii U and upgrading my PC.

1280
01:49:59,934 --> 01:50:01,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do I want a Wii U?

1281
01:50:01,435 --> 01:50:06,378
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's enough games I would actually play, like Super Mario 3D World and Rayman Legends being the main ones.

1282
01:50:07,038 --> 01:50:16,023
[SPEAKER_07]: And Cyberjudge says, I'd planned on purchasing a PlayStation 4, but with recent good and bad news I received, I'm no longer purchasing an next-gen console in the foreseeable future.

1283
01:50:16,443 --> 01:50:17,183
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have a Vita.

1284
01:50:17,243 --> 01:50:19,845
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll end up getting a PlayStation 4 when I am again able.

1285
01:50:20,290 --> 01:50:25,974
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was about half nothing, half mixture of PlayStation 4 and Wii U, Xbox One a little later.

1286
01:50:26,774 --> 01:50:27,975
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a lot of people on Facebook.

1287
01:50:27,995 --> 01:50:28,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me try to get through these.

1288
01:50:29,356 --> 01:50:34,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Andy R says, buying a PlayStation 4 at launch, mostly because it's new and shiny and I'm a consumer whore.

1289
01:50:36,340 --> 01:50:37,161
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my reason too.

1290
01:50:37,581 --> 01:50:38,041
[SPEAKER_07]: And hell.

1291
01:50:38,402 --> 01:50:40,503
[SPEAKER_07]: KJ says, I pre-ordered a PlayStation 4.

1292
01:50:41,163 --> 01:50:43,705
[SPEAKER_07]: The timing of the release of the console is my main reason.

1293
01:50:43,845 --> 01:50:47,427
[SPEAKER_07]: I paid off the PlayStation 4 little by little, not in one lump sum.

1294
01:50:47,948 --> 01:50:49,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox One will have to wait for a price drop.

1295
01:50:51,010 --> 01:51:05,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Renji2214 says I'm thinking of getting a Wii U for the holidays this year I haven't seen anything that interests me on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One and with Super Mario 3D World and Mario Kart 9 and the new Smash Brothers next year I think the Wii U has a little more that I'd be interested in

1296
01:51:06,250 --> 01:51:09,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, our old pal 23rd Magus, or what is it?

1297
01:51:09,533 --> 01:51:10,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Drew Nami.

1298
01:51:10,094 --> 01:51:10,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew Nami.

1299
01:51:11,034 --> 01:51:14,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Drew Nami replied and said, I know better than to buy a system at launch.

1300
01:51:15,038 --> 01:51:17,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Even the DS took a year before it had more than tech demos.

1301
01:51:18,641 --> 01:51:26,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Extifer, our pal from Horde House, said we're getting a PlayStation 4, already have a Wii U, no Xbox One yet, no plans to get a 3DS or Vita.

1302
01:51:26,928 --> 01:51:27,869
[SPEAKER_07]: LOL Uya.

1303
01:51:28,770 --> 01:51:30,632
[SPEAKER_07]: He just threw that in there to kick them.

1304
01:51:31,493 --> 01:51:48,591
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100Matt says other every year around or on Cyber Monday I spend money that I've saved towards upgrades to my PC I figure if I spend a little money every year I can keep my PC at near optimal settings this year I'm going to get a new graphics card a second monitor whatever's left over will go towards a device to help me stream games

1305
01:51:49,719 --> 01:51:51,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Our friend Syl from Girls Gone Wow.

1306
01:51:51,900 --> 01:51:52,580
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Syl.

1307
01:51:52,780 --> 01:51:53,561
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you, Syl.

1308
01:51:53,601 --> 01:51:54,461
[SPEAKER_03]: She was on this week's Courthouse.

1309
01:51:54,481 --> 01:51:55,061
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love your hair.

1310
01:51:55,141 --> 01:51:55,842
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks so cute.

1311
01:51:56,142 --> 01:51:56,722
[SPEAKER_07]: She's amazing.

1312
01:51:57,282 --> 01:51:59,503
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can hear them at Voice of Geeks Network.

1313
01:51:59,603 --> 01:52:02,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Girls Gone Wow is on our network Wednesdays at 9 a.m.

1314
01:52:02,884 --> 01:52:04,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Pacific, noon Eastern.

1315
01:52:04,565 --> 01:52:06,506
[SPEAKER_07]: They're really early because in the UK it's 5.

1316
01:52:06,986 --> 01:52:08,186
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Syl to kidnap me.

1317
01:52:09,367 --> 01:52:09,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the other way around.

1318
01:52:10,007 --> 01:52:10,787
[SPEAKER_03]: I want her to kidnap me.

1319
01:52:11,947 --> 01:52:12,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough.

1320
01:52:13,227 --> 01:52:16,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, Syl says, I really want a PlayStation 4, but can't afford one now.

1321
01:52:16,668 --> 01:52:19,909
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll wait until much later when they have newer versions and I can get it secondhand.

1322
01:52:20,409 --> 01:52:24,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Or perhaps I should just livestream with more cleavage on display so I can get money.

1323
01:52:24,750 --> 01:52:28,011
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's important to note she put a little angry face after that.

1324
01:52:28,071 --> 01:52:30,271
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you call that line underscore line face?

1325
01:52:30,311 --> 01:52:32,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the grrr face.

1326
01:52:33,092 --> 01:52:34,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox One hasn't impressed me so far.

1327
01:52:59,116 --> 01:53:14,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Degenerate Johnny says 3DS because of Pokemon XY and I don't want to be pressured into getting the next gen I still have a pile of current gen games I haven't even touched yet when I finish this shrink wrap pile and I'm feeling comfortable moving forward I'll consider a next gen console until then I'd rather bask in the here and now

1328
01:53:16,385 --> 01:53:31,096
[SPEAKER_07]: AZHP says none of the above my backlog of games is so huge that I honestly don't need a new system and none of the games are really drawing me my friend is lending me her 3DS so I can play Ace Attorney but other than that there's nothing I want to play badly enough to buy a system at this time

1329
01:53:31,937 --> 01:53:37,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Burr says, I'm getting both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One because I have the money to get in on this console launch party madness.

1330
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:43,883
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's not the most objectively smart thing to do, but I'm going to enjoy some enthusiasm for the next generation for now.

1331
01:53:44,463 --> 01:53:46,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, I think that's a good way of looking at it.

1332
01:53:46,944 --> 01:53:50,726
[SPEAKER_07]: I know this is a lot to be spending, but I'm going to have fun with this.

1333
01:53:50,766 --> 01:53:51,786
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a good way of looking at it.

1334
01:53:52,386 --> 01:53:54,367
[SPEAKER_07]: JV Monset also says, I'm getting both.

1335
01:53:54,788 --> 01:53:58,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Though the PlayStation 4 had zero interesting games at launch, I believe it has potential in 2014.

1336
01:54:00,370 --> 01:54:05,636
[SPEAKER_07]: CriticalMyth says I cancelled my PlayStation 4 pre-order and I'll be holding off on any new consoles until 2014.

1337
01:54:06,818 --> 01:54:10,802
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm too backlogged on games for my PlayStation 3, Vita, and 360 as it is.

1338
01:54:11,944 --> 01:54:13,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Doug T says I'm buying the PlayStation 4.

1339
01:54:14,366 --> 01:54:15,468
[SPEAKER_07]: My preference is Sony.

1340
01:54:15,788 --> 01:54:18,972
[SPEAKER_07]: I have massive PlayStation 2, 3, and Vita game libraries.

1341
01:54:19,292 --> 01:54:20,973
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't trust their position with Xbox One.

1342
01:54:21,013 --> 01:54:22,314
[SPEAKER_07]: They could change their stance again.

1343
01:54:33,291 --> 01:54:36,733
[SPEAKER_07]: GamerGirl says, I'm not bothering to buy one until further down the road.

1344
01:54:36,873 --> 01:54:40,135
[SPEAKER_07]: I enjoy my PlayStation 3 too much and the first batches always have glitches.

1345
01:54:40,276 --> 01:54:40,896
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to wait.

1346
01:54:41,056 --> 01:54:47,600
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even have a Wii U. DDRDollarBill says, none of the new systems because none have three must-have games for it.

1347
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:49,041
[SPEAKER_07]: A general rule I follow.

1348
01:54:49,321 --> 01:54:49,922
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good rule.

1349
01:54:51,021 --> 01:54:52,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Hitstun says, screw all that.

1350
01:54:52,783 --> 01:54:54,164
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a Retron 5.

1351
01:54:54,725 --> 01:54:55,906
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got plenty of old games.

1352
01:54:55,926 --> 01:54:56,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are great.

1353
01:54:56,426 --> 01:55:00,310
[SPEAKER_07]: I still have to finish, and the Retron 5 makes them look nice over HDMI.

1354
01:55:00,370 --> 01:55:02,272
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a very creative answer.

1355
01:55:03,433 --> 01:55:06,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Rationator says, I'm a ways off before I buy an next-gen system.

1356
01:55:06,476 --> 01:55:08,418
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to replace my PlayStation 3 first.

1357
01:55:08,758 --> 01:55:10,700
[SPEAKER_07]: If I were to buy one, I'd lean towards a PlayStation 4.

1358
01:55:11,641 --> 01:55:15,003
[SPEAKER_07]: FifthDream says, I have my PlayStation 4 pre-ordered with release day delivery.

1359
01:55:15,323 --> 01:55:16,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't wait for it to arrive.

1360
01:55:16,683 --> 01:55:17,944
[SPEAKER_07]: I've just always liked PlayStation.

1361
01:55:18,304 --> 01:55:23,387
[SPEAKER_07]: I never got PlayStation 3 because I was required to have a 360 for a tech support job and never saw the reason to get both.

1362
01:55:24,247 --> 01:55:26,128
[SPEAKER_07]: BloodDrunk says, none of the above.

1363
01:55:26,488 --> 01:55:28,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Going for a good old-fashioned video card upgrade.

1364
01:55:28,889 --> 01:55:29,850
[SPEAKER_07]: PC is where it's at.

1365
01:55:30,737 --> 01:55:53,699
[SPEAKER_07]: and James S says I have my PlayStation 4 paid off and I'm ready to go as well as the special edition Zelda 3DS and I'm going to ask for a Vita for Christmas along with the new media molecule game Tearaway because that game looks good and the reason is because I'm simply just one giant man child well said considering I'm in a very similar position although I got to admit

1366
01:55:54,724 --> 01:55:57,006
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm starting to waffle a little bit on the PlayStation 4.

1367
01:55:57,046 --> 01:55:57,947
[SPEAKER_07]: I might cancel it.

1368
01:55:58,907 --> 01:56:00,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Because a combination of things.

1369
01:56:00,949 --> 01:56:06,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's the three game rule that one of our listeners said in their response.

1370
01:56:07,094 --> 01:56:11,457
[SPEAKER_07]: And just the fact that I would really be interested in upgrading my PC a little more.

1371
01:56:11,878 --> 01:56:13,899
[SPEAKER_07]: And you start to kind of weigh what's more important.

1372
01:56:14,260 --> 01:56:17,702
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation 4 or being able to do more stuff on your PC.

1373
01:56:18,323 --> 01:56:21,325
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I look at where I really spend most of my time gaming, it's on the PC.

1374
01:56:21,906 --> 01:56:22,106
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1375
01:56:22,586 --> 01:56:27,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan and I have had a similar discussion because I'm really working on trying to up my own design stuff.

1376
01:56:28,351 --> 01:56:30,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And I need a computer that's going to handle it better.

1377
01:56:30,573 --> 01:56:33,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, I mean, I play on the PC more than anything anyway.

1378
01:56:34,356 --> 01:56:40,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Just don't be surprised if you guys come back in two weeks on the show and hear that I canceled my pre-order because it's something I'm strongly leaning towards right now.

1379
01:56:40,621 --> 01:56:43,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it's likely going to happen.

1380
01:56:43,203 --> 01:56:45,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind, buying a game at launch is not usually a good idea.

1381
01:56:46,175 --> 01:56:46,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1382
01:56:47,716 --> 01:56:47,976
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1383
01:56:48,537 --> 01:56:49,157
[SPEAKER_03]: System, I should say.

1384
01:56:49,177 --> 01:56:49,977
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's interesting.

1385
01:56:50,178 --> 01:57:00,925
[SPEAKER_07]: None of us are, assuming I cancel my PlayStation 4, which is the likely case at this point, but y'all, I said on this show right up until the day it came out, I'm not getting a Wii U. I'm not getting a Wii U. And then, of course, what happened about a Wii U?

1386
01:57:02,005 --> 01:57:04,387
[SPEAKER_07]: None of us will own an X-Gen system except my Wii U.

1387
01:57:05,802 --> 01:57:07,722
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't count.

1388
01:57:07,742 --> 01:57:09,683
[SPEAKER_08]: The Wii U is not a next-gen system.

1389
01:57:09,743 --> 01:57:10,403
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1390
01:57:10,443 --> 01:57:18,965
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be like a separate parallel dimension system, but it's not a next-generation system.

1391
01:57:19,025 --> 01:57:21,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Regardless of where you place it or how you feel about it.

1392
01:57:21,946 --> 01:57:29,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Does this mean we have to stop doing a video game podcast because we're not gaming enough to be on the cutting edge in the new generation?

1393
01:57:29,848 --> 01:57:30,008
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1394
01:57:31,048 --> 01:57:31,168
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1395
01:57:31,744 --> 01:57:34,926
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I also obviously, obviously I agree with you.

1396
01:57:35,347 --> 01:57:36,627
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think it's the realistic position.

1397
01:57:36,667 --> 01:57:37,148
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a PC.

1398
01:57:37,248 --> 01:57:38,269
[SPEAKER_07]: I can run games.

1399
01:57:38,589 --> 01:57:39,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a PC.

1400
01:57:39,770 --> 01:57:47,815
[SPEAKER_07]: At least a third to half of those answers were people saying, nope, not right now, or getting systems that are like 3DSs and Vitas and things that are already out there.

1401
01:57:47,935 --> 01:57:51,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and Dan and I already said we're going to wait until there's more stuff out for it that we want.

1402
01:57:51,418 --> 01:57:57,602
[SPEAKER_03]: We're sitting on a $100 gift card that we're going to put to our, we've decided it's going to our PS4.

1403
01:57:58,102 --> 01:57:59,163
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just not getting it yet.

1404
01:57:59,463 --> 01:57:59,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1405
01:57:59,643 --> 01:58:04,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Besides, I want to make sure there's no shapes or lights of death on anything that I'm planning on purchasing.

1406
01:58:04,688 --> 01:58:08,451
[SPEAKER_08]: I probably, if I get a PlayStation 4 this year, it's going to be because I got it for free.

1407
01:58:08,851 --> 01:58:09,952
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not actually going to buy one.

1408
01:58:10,213 --> 01:58:15,017
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll want to get one before February of next year when Final Fantasy XIV starts on PlayStation 4.

1409
01:58:15,517 --> 01:58:19,141
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, by then I'll have a tax refund I can spend on it, too.

1410
01:58:19,441 --> 01:58:21,182
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's something I have to put in perspective.

1411
01:58:21,603 --> 01:58:21,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1412
01:58:22,043 --> 01:58:32,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep in mind, guys, I know we've been doing this podcast a long time, and some of you have stuck by us a very long time, and I really, really appreciate that, but the reality is we don't make our lives off this show, and people ain't giving us free shit all the time.

1413
01:58:33,228 --> 01:58:43,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Once in a great while, we are extremely lucky to get a review copy of a game from an independent studio or something, but the reality is it's not like they're shipping us free consoles and things like that.

1414
01:58:43,432 --> 01:58:46,753
[SPEAKER_07]: So just like you have to think about, do I have the money to spend on this console?

1415
01:58:46,773 --> 01:58:49,274
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to ask ourselves the same question, and sometimes the answer is,

1416
01:58:49,734 --> 01:58:53,898
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'd rather spend the money on a ticket to Atlanta so I can go to DragonCon next year.

1417
01:58:53,978 --> 01:58:54,579
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, type of thing.

1418
01:58:54,979 --> 01:58:55,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Or whatever it is.

1419
01:58:57,582 --> 01:58:57,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1420
01:58:59,043 --> 01:59:00,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, moving on.

1421
01:59:00,585 --> 01:59:06,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get into some more news and then we'll get to our phone calls pretty soon here at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1422
01:59:06,671 --> 01:59:08,693
[SPEAKER_07]: You can yell at me for changing my mind if you want.

1423
01:59:09,053 --> 01:59:09,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I'm not, again...

1424
01:59:10,094 --> 01:59:10,234
[SPEAKER_03]: MindCon

1425
01:59:34,302 --> 01:59:44,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, if you have the PC or Mac version of it, you will be able to soon stream to Twitch straight from the game.

1426
01:59:45,406 --> 01:59:53,889
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll be able to link your Twitch TV account to the actual game and it'll allow you to stream, I guess, natively.

1427
01:59:55,529 --> 01:59:56,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Which I think is kind of interesting.

1428
01:59:57,650 --> 02:00:06,057
[SPEAKER_08]: and of course, I guess you'll be able to do it on the Xbox One as well because I think they're going to have Twitch integration, but that's kind of something separate.

1429
02:00:06,558 --> 02:00:13,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of the Xbox, there is some new DLC coming and yet another reskin of the game.

1430
02:00:14,724 --> 02:00:18,146
[SPEAKER_08]: much like the Mass Effect Minecraft mod that they had.

1431
02:00:18,546 --> 02:00:22,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Now they have the Elder Scrolls Skyrim texture set.

1432
02:00:22,448 --> 02:00:27,591
[SPEAKER_08]: It comes with 40 character skins, themed menus, user interface, and craftable items.

1433
02:00:28,091 --> 02:00:30,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Also 20 songs from Skyrim as well.

1434
02:00:30,792 --> 02:00:41,798
[SPEAKER_08]: And the best part about it is it comes with a pre-made map that I guess recreates areas of Bleak Falls Barrow, Whiterun, and Riverwood.

1435
02:00:42,138 --> 02:00:43,599
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's pretty sweet.

1436
02:00:44,724 --> 02:00:45,525
[SPEAKER_03]: That is pretty neat.

1437
02:00:47,809 --> 02:00:52,235
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to check out some of these themed DLCs they have going on on Xbox because I know they have the Mass Effect one.

1438
02:00:52,275 --> 02:00:54,919
[SPEAKER_07]: I never checked that out, but the Skyrim one sounds cute too.

1439
02:00:55,259 --> 02:00:57,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I think it's pretty sweet.

1440
02:01:01,113 --> 02:01:28,561
[SPEAKER_07]: at some point I need to go back to Minecraft but I just I'm too busy with Grand Theft Auto alright moving on to information about Wii Sports Club remember Wii Sports Club this is the thing they're doing on Wii U that's kind of the reinvention of what many were saying were the game of last generation Wii Sports and I had no idea about this but there was a article they run called Owada Asks that was talking about the release of Wii Sports Club and he said quote

1441
02:01:30,061 --> 02:01:41,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, actually this is not Iwata that said this, but this is developers behind the game, Kozo Makino and Takayuki Shimamura said about Namco Bandai being involved in the development of this.

1442
02:01:41,543 --> 02:01:42,623
[SPEAKER_07]: I had no idea they were involved.

1443
02:01:43,564 --> 02:01:51,125
[SPEAKER_07]: But Makino says, we asked Namco Bandai Studios to develop it, so I first participated as a coordinator, but in the end I got into just about anything.

1444
02:01:51,525 --> 02:01:56,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I mainly worked on the network aspect of the game, but at times I made suggestions on how some features should turn out to be.

1445
02:01:57,186 --> 02:02:03,570
[SPEAKER_07]: And Shimomura says, from the middle of development, Makino-san and Suzuki-san were also working as full-fledged planners.

1446
02:02:03,911 --> 02:02:14,858
[SPEAKER_07]: We did ask Namco Bandai Studio to develop the game this time, but staff in Nintendo's Network Development and Operations Department, the Software Planning and Development Department that those two are in, and EAD also chipped in.

1447
02:02:14,918 --> 02:02:18,160
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of neat that Namco Bandai is involved.

1448
02:02:18,420 --> 02:02:20,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Confirmed, Pac-Man a playable character.

1449
02:02:20,741 --> 02:02:21,262
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just kidding.

1450
02:02:21,282 --> 02:02:21,982
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not confirmed.

1451
02:02:22,082 --> 02:02:26,305
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a little disappointed that Nintendo chipped in on the network portion of it.

1452
02:02:26,625 --> 02:02:27,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't worry, Rob.

1453
02:02:51,303 --> 02:02:52,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, don't worry.

1454
02:02:52,184 --> 02:02:54,226
[SPEAKER_08]: This is plan B. You do understand.

1455
02:02:54,246 --> 02:03:00,412
[SPEAKER_08]: This is plan B because remember, this holiday, they do have a brand new Wii U SKU that has the new Super Mario Bros.

1456
02:03:00,653 --> 02:03:04,236
[SPEAKER_08]: U and new Luigi U as well.

1457
02:03:04,637 --> 02:03:14,026
[SPEAKER_08]: If that fucking fails and can't sell the game system, you better believe they are going to include this with the next SKU that comes out to try to drive sales.

1458
02:03:14,106 --> 02:03:14,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sure.

1459
02:03:15,508 --> 02:03:18,832
[SPEAKER_07]: and they just dropped the price in Nintendo Land pretty heavy too, right?

1460
02:03:18,852 --> 02:03:21,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't they drop that down to 29 bucks this week, I think happened too?

1461
02:03:21,796 --> 02:03:22,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Or it's coming up very soon?

1462
02:03:22,777 --> 02:03:30,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, if it's not the packing game anymore too, you know, it's gotta, you know, getting its price dropped would really help it sell.

1463
02:03:32,049 --> 02:03:33,690
[SPEAKER_07]: One other interesting note.

1464
02:03:34,291 --> 02:03:41,237
[SPEAKER_07]: You may not want to read too much into this, but there's a Wii U exclusive trailer that Nintendo has.

1465
02:03:42,077 --> 02:03:45,981
[SPEAKER_07]: It's for the 2013 and 2014 lineup that shows Wii U exclusives.

1466
02:03:46,481 --> 02:03:48,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Bayonetta 2 was in the trailer at one time.

1467
02:03:49,544 --> 02:03:50,424
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not there now.

1468
02:03:51,465 --> 02:03:54,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people are reading into this that, uh-oh, it slipped to 2015.

1469
02:03:56,349 --> 02:03:57,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1470
02:03:57,770 --> 02:04:03,511
[SPEAKER_07]: I think people might be reading a bit too much, especially the people that are saying, oh, well, this means it's no longer exclusive.

1471
02:04:04,011 --> 02:04:09,233
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they've said many times this game would not be happening if it wasn't for Nintendo, and it's going to be exclusive.

1472
02:04:09,733 --> 02:04:10,894
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

1473
02:04:11,554 --> 02:04:16,415
[SPEAKER_07]: But it could just be that there's nothing new to show.

1474
02:04:17,156 --> 02:04:19,056
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they want to keep the game a secret.

1475
02:04:19,136 --> 02:04:19,436
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1476
02:04:19,456 --> 02:04:23,338
[SPEAKER_07]: But it honestly wouldn't surprise me whatsoever if it's going to be pushed back all the way to 2015.

1477
02:04:24,058 --> 02:04:24,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't surprise me.

1478
02:04:26,374 --> 02:04:29,795
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope they have a strong enough 2014 lineup to keep selling Wii U's.

1479
02:04:31,175 --> 02:04:32,516
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure they've got something under their hat.

1480
02:04:32,556 --> 02:04:34,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the Zelda game will be this year.

1481
02:04:34,416 --> 02:04:35,616
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll probably be this year.

1482
02:04:35,656 --> 02:04:37,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, maybe the Zelda game will come out sooner than we think.

1483
02:04:38,857 --> 02:04:40,438
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still thinking holiday next year.

1484
02:04:40,578 --> 02:04:41,618
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's going to be any sooner than that.

1485
02:04:41,638 --> 02:04:44,739
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure it's all hands on deck for Zelda Wii U, but we'll see.

1486
02:04:45,659 --> 02:04:47,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, let's move on.

1487
02:04:47,320 --> 02:04:47,800
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.

1488
02:04:48,780 --> 02:04:52,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in other news, we do have...

1489
02:04:54,079 --> 02:04:54,940
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1490
02:05:09,355 --> 02:05:10,416
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1491
02:05:36,115 --> 02:05:39,540
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always fun to hear about new games coming out for old consoles.

1492
02:05:39,700 --> 02:05:41,082
[SPEAKER_07]: There's still love out there for it.

1493
02:05:41,162 --> 02:05:43,405
[SPEAKER_02]: I love when people do Dreamcast games.

1494
02:05:43,425 --> 02:05:43,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right?

1495
02:05:44,486 --> 02:05:45,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I want some of them still.

1496
02:05:46,895 --> 02:05:54,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft in our chatroom reminds me of a very obvious Nintendo game I should have remembered for 2014, Smash Bros.

1497
02:05:54,322 --> 02:05:56,004
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure that's a given for next year too.

1498
02:05:56,024 --> 02:05:57,405
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that'll finally be done.

1499
02:05:57,505 --> 02:05:57,966
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be good.

1500
02:05:58,326 --> 02:05:59,047
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mario Kart 8.

1501
02:05:59,688 --> 02:06:00,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's Mario Kart 8.

1502
02:06:00,929 --> 02:06:05,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't there a rumor that it is, I think the date was out there, April 25th, I want to say?

1503
02:06:06,274 --> 02:06:08,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, that was a UK date, if I'm not mistaken.

1504
02:06:08,997 --> 02:06:11,138
[SPEAKER_07]: But isn't that later than it was originally said?

1505
02:06:11,678 --> 02:06:15,739
[SPEAKER_07]: And remember I said when Donkey Kong got delayed, it could have been a sign that Mario Kart was delayed too?

1506
02:06:15,859 --> 02:06:20,220
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they have a... They're probably going to try to make sure they have a release every month.

1507
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:22,441
[SPEAKER_08]: So they've got Donkey Kong in February.

1508
02:06:23,041 --> 02:06:32,404
[SPEAKER_08]: There's still no real date for... I mean, say if Wii Fit U, they have the meter out for that, but they don't actually have a physical bundle for it yet that's been announced.

1509
02:06:32,884 --> 02:06:35,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless that's December, because there's really nothing in December.

1510
02:06:36,125 --> 02:06:37,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Gran Turismo, it's your month!

1511
02:06:38,385 --> 02:06:39,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, don't forget Wii U owners.

1512
02:06:39,846 --> 02:06:41,707
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have a balance board, Wii Fit U is out.

1513
02:06:42,428 --> 02:06:42,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1514
02:06:43,628 --> 02:06:44,969
[SPEAKER_07]: I should check that out at some point.

1515
02:06:45,109 --> 02:06:49,412
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you have a balance board, you already pretty much have Wii Fit U. I mean, it's only a little bit different.

1516
02:06:50,732 --> 02:06:51,673
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to buy a meter, though.

1517
02:06:51,933 --> 02:06:53,654
[SPEAKER_08]: So make sure you get your Fit Meter thing.

1518
02:06:54,595 --> 02:06:57,496
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to think what else there was.

1519
02:06:58,017 --> 02:06:58,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Smash Bros.

1520
02:06:58,597 --> 02:06:59,197
[SPEAKER_08]: and Mario Kart.

1521
02:06:59,317 --> 02:07:00,658
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, those are supposed to be at some point.

1522
02:07:00,758 --> 02:07:01,158
[SPEAKER_08]: And then...

1523
02:07:03,981 --> 02:07:29,909
[SPEAKER_07]: has a tendency though to kind of surprise us with little things you know and they're doing their own thing now with these Nintendo Directs they they're not adhering to any schedule for release of news I mean granted they'll save some of their biggest stuff for E3 week but I wouldn't be surprised if they don't do a press conference again next year and do what they did this year so anyway let's move on with some other news all right Loki Final Fantasy 14 doing pretty well now that they rebooted has it gone up a level

1524
02:07:30,663 --> 02:07:34,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I'd say 1.5 million registered accounts.

1525
02:07:35,905 --> 02:07:36,745
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not bad.

1526
02:07:36,805 --> 02:07:39,787
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd say that's worth the reboot.

1527
02:07:39,967 --> 02:07:43,728
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura's doing the Final Fantasy 1 victory animation with the hands up and down.

1528
02:07:44,308 --> 02:07:47,489
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what just went into my head was the Brental Floss thing.

1529
02:07:47,550 --> 02:07:49,430
[SPEAKER_03]: You just got pwned, FTW.

1530
02:07:52,272 --> 02:08:05,742
[SPEAKER_08]: so yeah that's cool and definitely I think it'll be neat when the PlayStation they say the PlayStation 4 beta version is planned to launch I guess the same day as the Japanese PlayStation 4 so February yep cool very cool

1531
02:08:06,621 --> 02:08:11,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we just heard not that long ago there was a million Final Fantasy XIV, so it's going up in subscribers.

1532
02:08:12,842 --> 02:08:22,244
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to make this year's BlizzCon very interesting because this MMO, Final Fantasy XIV, has still got some steam behind it.

1533
02:08:22,284 --> 02:08:30,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, granted, you had Star Wars and you had Rift and some of these other ones too, but Blizzard, I wonder if they're starting to feel the pressure this year.

1534
02:08:30,106 --> 02:08:33,947
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of pressure to make or break World of Warcraft this year.

1535
02:08:34,747 --> 02:08:35,007
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura,

1536
02:08:58,974 --> 02:08:59,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Good luck.

1537
02:08:59,835 --> 02:09:03,817
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just going to be hard to do anyways, even if it was an excellent game.

1538
02:09:03,937 --> 02:09:06,918
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think anyone really cares.

1539
02:09:07,238 --> 02:09:07,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Same with WoW.

1540
02:09:08,719 --> 02:09:14,161
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of other things competing for attention out there in the MMO space.

1541
02:09:15,182 --> 02:09:19,764
[SPEAKER_08]: They have to do something to really interest people in playing it.

1542
02:09:19,804 --> 02:09:21,965
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't think they're really doing that a lot anymore.

1543
02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:25,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2 Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2

1544
02:09:47,688 --> 02:09:48,228
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1545
02:10:12,205 --> 02:10:13,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Dragon Quest X Dragon Quest X

1546
02:10:31,795 --> 02:10:48,958
[SPEAKER_07]: and so a lot of people are like oh well if Reggie wants it you know he can he can make that happen so I don't know if he solely can make that happen but I'd be a fan of seeing some of these remakes come out over here I'm very curious about Dragon Quest X I'm kind of sad that just didn't happen so

1547
02:10:50,063 --> 02:10:50,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

1548
02:10:51,064 --> 02:10:56,027
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, this is the stuff now that Operation Rainfall and that whole group has their eyes on.

1549
02:10:56,047 --> 02:10:59,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they've got nothing left on their original three.

1550
02:10:59,189 --> 02:10:59,889
[SPEAKER_07]: They all came out.

1551
02:10:59,909 --> 02:11:00,570
[SPEAKER_07]: They got their way.

1552
02:11:01,030 --> 02:11:02,611
[SPEAKER_07]: So now they're hoping to get this as well.

1553
02:11:03,031 --> 02:11:04,072
[SPEAKER_07]: So, good luck.

1554
02:11:04,912 --> 02:11:06,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Hope Nintendo listens to you guys because I'd like to see it.

1555
02:11:07,654 --> 02:11:20,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, speaking of listening to you guys, every week you guys can email us at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura, she dives into the mailbag and picks out an email or two to read for you guys here on the show.

1556
02:11:20,401 --> 02:11:21,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if it's like last week, there'll be five emails.

1557
02:11:22,062 --> 02:11:26,144
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's just one and I had to use my radioactive gloves to slip through the Mandarin text.

1558
02:11:27,605 --> 02:11:28,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we're still getting the spam.

1559
02:11:30,734 --> 02:11:33,096
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so we've got one email tonight.

1560
02:11:33,116 --> 02:11:33,236
[SPEAKER_03]: One.

1561
02:11:33,416 --> 02:11:34,117
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, what is it?

1562
02:11:34,177 --> 02:11:38,181
[SPEAKER_03]: With Twitter links, and I'm just going to go ahead and read this.

1563
02:11:38,721 --> 02:11:39,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, OLR.

1564
02:11:40,062 --> 02:11:48,530
[SPEAKER_03]: In light of Nintendo's recent closure of Swapnote, I'd like to bring to your attention some funny as hell comments made by Sony Computer Entertainment Prez, Shuhei Yoshida.

1565
02:11:49,111 --> 02:11:49,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy.

1566
02:11:50,151 --> 02:11:52,834
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first one says... Do you want me to read these?

1567
02:11:52,854 --> 02:11:53,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know you're on your iPad.

1568
02:11:53,915 --> 02:11:55,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

1569
02:11:55,997 --> 02:11:56,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1570
02:11:56,860 --> 02:12:09,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, the first one is a reply to somebody saying, oh, okay, Yoshida says, thanks for the feedback to the lack of MP3 and DLNA supported the launch of PS4.

1571
02:12:09,484 --> 02:12:12,144
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll share with the PS4 dev team for future consideration.

1572
02:12:12,464 --> 02:12:17,126
[SPEAKER_07]: And somebody replied to that, I need to listen to porn whilst playing Battlefield.

1573
02:12:17,726 --> 02:12:19,866
[SPEAKER_07]: And Yoshida replied to that, I know.

1574
02:12:20,267 --> 02:12:20,587
Okay.

1575
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:35,964
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there was another tweet where somebody tweeted at him, Hey, I want to know why my dick got caught in my PlayStation 3's disc tray when I tried to play Killzone Shadowfall on my PlayStation 3.

1576
02:12:36,744 --> 02:12:37,564
[SPEAKER_07]: It really hurts.

1577
02:12:38,044 --> 02:12:40,445
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, I tried turning it on and off again.

1578
02:12:40,885 --> 02:12:42,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Yoshida replied, Shut up.

1579
02:12:45,194 --> 02:12:50,117
[SPEAKER_07]: To which the original guy replied, K. That's cute.

1580
02:12:52,079 --> 02:12:58,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, please pardon me for a brief Orange Lounge Foodio tangent, but do you guys have a Del Taco in the area?

1581
02:12:58,283 --> 02:13:00,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we have plenty of them.

1582
02:13:00,464 --> 02:13:06,248
[SPEAKER_07]: There's literally one up the street from OLR Studios, and you better bet I go there all the time.

1583
02:13:06,328 --> 02:13:09,770
[SPEAKER_03]: They have some great chicken tacos, and this is true.

1584
02:13:10,391 --> 02:13:12,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Signed, The Nasty Canasta.

1585
02:13:12,852 --> 02:13:13,893
[SPEAKER_07]: One of my favorite handles.

1586
02:13:14,414 --> 02:13:16,816
[SPEAKER_07]: It always makes me think of strip poker, but it's Nasty Canasta.

1587
02:13:16,836 --> 02:13:18,757
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Nasty Canasta.

1588
02:13:19,278 --> 02:13:20,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Nasty Canasta does need a theme song, huh?

1589
02:13:22,060 --> 02:13:31,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I need to... It should be like... It should be like, I don't know... Like something set to a Burt Bacharach song or something.

1590
02:13:31,649 --> 02:13:35,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Nasty Canasta kind of makes me think like Copacabana, which makes me think of those.

1591
02:13:35,492 --> 02:13:39,896
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know, when I go... Because we love to use Bomani songs for things, so I kind of think of this song.

1592
02:13:43,021 --> 02:13:44,502
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the Nasty Canasta song now.

1593
02:13:48,925 --> 02:13:56,169
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not sponsored by Del Taco.

1594
02:13:56,189 --> 02:13:57,510
[SPEAKER_03]: We're sponsored by Pinkberry.

1595
02:13:57,870 --> 02:13:58,451
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish.

1596
02:13:58,551 --> 02:13:59,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish we had official sponsorship.

1597
02:13:59,971 --> 02:14:00,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I want sugar-free Pinkberry.

1598
02:14:00,792 --> 02:14:04,374
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a new app come out this week, but I'm not going to plug it because they don't sponsor us.

1599
02:14:05,035 --> 02:14:05,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Pinkberry.

1600
02:14:06,415 --> 02:14:07,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Free samples over here.

1601
02:14:09,197 --> 02:14:09,517
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1602
02:14:09,577 --> 02:14:12,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I cannot partake of your deliciousness for a while.

1603
02:14:13,144 --> 02:14:13,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1604
02:14:14,305 --> 02:14:14,745
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1605
02:14:14,765 --> 02:14:15,446
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was our email.

1606
02:14:15,486 --> 02:14:17,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

1607
02:14:17,227 --> 02:14:19,189
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys didn't make DarkSakura work very hard this week.

1608
02:14:19,289 --> 02:14:21,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, why it's all taco and not of taco?

1609
02:14:23,933 --> 02:14:26,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, Americans gotta be stupid.

1610
02:14:28,797 --> 02:14:29,057
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

1611
02:14:30,218 --> 02:14:30,538
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1612
02:14:31,719 --> 02:14:33,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

1613
02:14:33,661 --> 02:14:35,422
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have a week.

1614
02:14:35,482 --> 02:14:36,823
[SPEAKER_07]: You have an extra week this week.

1615
02:14:37,324 --> 02:14:40,626
[SPEAKER_07]: And you had an extra hour last night to really fill up that mailbag.

1616
02:14:40,866 --> 02:14:41,527
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to sleep.

1617
02:14:42,079 --> 02:14:43,140
[SPEAKER_07]: What, during the show next week?

1618
02:14:44,081 --> 02:14:44,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1619
02:14:44,942 --> 02:14:45,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

1620
02:14:45,443 --> 02:14:46,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're not having one.

1621
02:14:46,444 --> 02:14:46,984
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1622
02:14:47,265 --> 02:14:47,985
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to sleep.

1623
02:14:49,147 --> 02:14:49,427
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1624
02:14:50,068 --> 02:14:51,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get to the FUs of the week.

1625
02:14:51,970 --> 02:14:55,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Because before we can sleep, we have to get all the angst out of our system.

1626
02:14:55,293 --> 02:14:56,555
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll do the FUs of the week.

1627
02:15:13,710 --> 02:15:21,016
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to my state of unemployment and not hearing back on the one I really wanted to hear back on at all.

1628
02:15:24,598 --> 02:15:30,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is an FU to that and also being sore from the gym because I want to go back tomorrow.

1629
02:15:32,144 --> 02:15:37,068
[SPEAKER_03]: And Tom Nook because he's an ass.

1630
02:15:38,289 --> 02:15:38,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki?

1631
02:15:41,070 --> 02:15:44,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess, after the fact, I guess I have to have my wisdom teeth out.

1632
02:15:44,653 --> 02:15:45,414
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's going to be fun.

1633
02:15:46,055 --> 02:15:46,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh god, that's right.

1634
02:15:46,655 --> 02:15:47,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you going to miss a show because of that?

1635
02:15:48,217 --> 02:15:48,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you don't know yet?

1636
02:15:50,019 --> 02:15:52,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope your situation isn't like mine was.

1637
02:15:52,561 --> 02:15:55,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you remember my wisdom teeth coming out, don't you?

1638
02:15:55,364 --> 02:15:56,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

1639
02:15:56,645 --> 02:15:58,767
[SPEAKER_07]: I got mine out when I was a teenager, so it's no big deal.

1640
02:15:59,007 --> 02:16:02,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got pictures of it where I look like I've been in a prize fight for three months.

1641
02:16:02,731 --> 02:16:03,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Gross.

1642
02:16:04,212 --> 02:16:04,933
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope yours is better.

1643
02:16:06,825 --> 02:16:07,926
[SPEAKER_07]: I win as the what lady?

1644
02:16:07,966 --> 02:16:08,746
[SPEAKER_07]: I win as the what lady?

1645
02:16:26,312 --> 02:16:26,432
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1646
02:16:26,452 --> 02:16:28,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Where were some of the other costumes there?

1647
02:16:28,995 --> 02:16:29,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh...

1648
02:16:41,489 --> 02:16:46,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan and somebody else ended up as the ridiculously hot photogenic runner guy.

1649
02:16:46,831 --> 02:16:49,072
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was really funny that they duplicated the costume.

1650
02:16:49,092 --> 02:16:49,733
[SPEAKER_07]: That was really funny.

1651
02:16:51,473 --> 02:16:55,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Slagkick from Game Buoy was doing funeral selfies.

1652
02:16:56,155 --> 02:16:57,296
[SPEAKER_07]: He was doing selfies at funerals.

1653
02:16:57,536 --> 02:17:01,217
[SPEAKER_07]: So of course he walked over to me and took a picture of me and put hashtag this bitch soon.

1654
02:17:03,484 --> 02:17:06,906
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, I have to tell you, a trick-or-treater did come to my door dressed as an internet meme.

1655
02:17:07,486 --> 02:17:07,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah?

1656
02:17:08,066 --> 02:17:11,168
[SPEAKER_03]: He was wearing one of the Rage Comics shirts, wearing a horse head.

1657
02:17:12,248 --> 02:17:13,049
[SPEAKER_03]: He was an internet meme.

1658
02:17:13,369 --> 02:17:14,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice, nice.

1659
02:17:14,409 --> 02:17:26,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and the other one, I would say Captain Spike, also from Gamebuoy.org, he wore this gray hoodie, but he had it stuffed with pillows so he was round, and he had a little Barbie doll swinging on a chain.

1660
02:17:26,715 --> 02:17:27,676
[SPEAKER_07]: He was the wrecking ball.

1661
02:17:29,297 --> 02:17:30,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it?

1662
02:17:30,497 --> 02:17:30,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it?

1663
02:17:31,278 --> 02:17:31,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was funny.

1664
02:17:32,599 --> 02:17:36,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And he kept saying all night how comfortable he was because he had the built-in pillows and I was laughing.

1665
02:17:37,202 --> 02:17:38,903
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1666
02:17:38,983 --> 02:17:40,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Grandpa did not dress up.

1667
02:17:41,024 --> 02:17:50,651
[SPEAKER_07]: So he said something really, as Grandpa tends to do if you've ever listened to Horde House, he said something really unpolitically correct later on in the evening, so he said he was a YouTube commenter.

1668
02:17:51,411 --> 02:17:52,391
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's that.

1669
02:17:52,671 --> 02:18:00,013
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, I don't remember why I was telling that story, but oh yes, because we got tacos last night while I had been drinking.

1670
02:18:00,093 --> 02:18:04,715
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll tell you what, there is no better food when you've been drinking than tacos.

1671
02:18:05,855 --> 02:18:07,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless they come from Jack in the Box.

1672
02:18:07,416 --> 02:18:11,277
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to the fact that I'm too fat and need to eat less tacos.

1673
02:18:13,397 --> 02:18:14,558
[SPEAKER_03]: You should try some of that vodka.

1674
02:18:14,578 --> 02:18:18,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I was supposed to have some of that at the start of Part B, huh?

1675
02:18:18,979 --> 02:18:19,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Well...

1676
02:18:20,305 --> 02:18:20,785
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

1677
02:18:21,026 --> 02:18:21,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Rab.

1678
02:18:22,106 --> 02:18:22,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Rab vodka.

1679
02:18:23,127 --> 02:18:26,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'll do a shot for each call we get tonight to try to entice you.

1680
02:18:26,889 --> 02:18:28,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone call.

1681
02:18:30,032 --> 02:18:32,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I have to mix it with anything or do I just take it as shots?

1682
02:18:34,127 --> 02:18:34,927
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already mixed.

1683
02:18:35,047 --> 02:18:35,808
[SPEAKER_03]: It's infused with juice.

1684
02:18:35,988 --> 02:18:36,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1685
02:18:36,408 --> 02:18:36,648
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1686
02:18:37,388 --> 02:18:41,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to a couple more stories, and then we'll open up the phones and take some calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1687
02:18:42,430 --> 02:18:42,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

1688
02:18:42,850 --> 02:18:47,011
[SPEAKER_08]: So Sony has now announced a new Sony Rewards plan.

1689
02:18:47,071 --> 02:18:53,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently it allows you to earn points for money that you spend on the PlayStation Store.

1690
02:18:54,854 --> 02:19:11,684
[SPEAKER_08]: for every dollar spent you earn one point and each of those points equals up to be about one penny versus you know towards something else so for example if you want to get a brand new playstation 3 game or playstation 4 game for $59.99 it's going to cost you $5,999 um

1691
02:19:17,648 --> 02:19:22,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, there are other ways you can earn money, or points I should say, in there.

1692
02:19:23,252 --> 02:19:45,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Not just with purchasing stuff, but you can also, I think they have money spent on, for every dollar you spend on the Sony store, every dollar you spend on the PlayStation store, when you upload your ticket stubs for Sony Pictures movies, and also registered DVDs and Blu-ray discs,

1693
02:19:46,208 --> 02:19:48,129
[SPEAKER_08]: They're also going to have promotions through retail partners.

1694
02:19:48,269 --> 02:19:51,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, if you sign up for offers, you earn 100 points.

1695
02:19:51,751 --> 02:19:54,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Buy a PS3 bundle, you earn up to 270 points.

1696
02:19:56,833 --> 02:19:59,234
[SPEAKER_08]: For movie tickets, you earn up to 400 points.

1697
02:19:59,654 --> 02:20:06,937
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if that's per ticket or whatever, but right there, that's a good way there.

1698
02:20:08,558 --> 02:20:13,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, for every 1,000 points, you earn a $10 PlayStation Store code.

1699
02:20:16,118 --> 02:20:20,461
[SPEAKER_08]: and then 250 points for buying the year of PlayStation Plus.

1700
02:20:21,041 --> 02:20:33,228
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, lots of ways to earn points and they have rewards including, you know, not just games and stuff but you can also get Sony products and they have like other things, digital downloads, music, you know, movie tickets.

1701
02:20:34,449 --> 02:20:36,369
[SPEAKER_08]: VIP experiences, they say.

1702
02:20:36,389 --> 02:20:36,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yay.

1703
02:20:37,110 --> 02:20:39,370
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, prostitutes, I guess.

1704
02:20:39,950 --> 02:20:41,170
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm led to believe in.

1705
02:20:41,190 --> 02:20:42,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Pole dances.

1706
02:20:42,231 --> 02:20:42,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

1707
02:20:44,111 --> 02:20:46,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Hunting human beings, you know, that kind of stuff.

1708
02:20:47,111 --> 02:20:47,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

1709
02:20:48,252 --> 02:20:48,592
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1710
02:20:49,092 --> 02:20:52,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, this is a new story about a free game, so listen up.

1711
02:20:53,393 --> 02:20:55,913
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a game that came out on the Super Nintendo in the mid-90s.

1712
02:20:55,953 --> 02:20:57,273
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Blackthorn.

1713
02:20:57,653 --> 02:20:58,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God, that game.

1714
02:20:58,414 --> 02:20:59,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember this game?

1715
02:20:59,254 --> 02:20:59,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I do.

1716
02:20:59,754 --> 02:21:00,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I have that game.

1717
02:21:00,754 --> 02:21:01,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Blackthorn is one of them.

1718
02:21:01,875 --> 02:21:06,497
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's interesting is if you have a Battle.net account, you can go get Blackthorn from Blizzard for free.

1719
02:21:21,425 --> 02:21:21,765
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1720
02:21:21,865 --> 02:21:23,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Once you've downloaded the game, it's yours to keep.

1721
02:21:23,707 --> 02:21:24,427
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a free game.

1722
02:21:24,988 --> 02:21:33,014
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to speculate here it's to try and get more people on their Battle.net downloader because if they can give away, you know, this, you know, they're not making any money off this anymore.

1723
02:21:33,034 --> 02:21:34,135
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean all that crap I uninstalled?

1724
02:21:34,335 --> 02:21:48,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, but if you were to go download the Battle.net downloader so you can get Blackthorn, then hey, how easy is it to get a Hearthstone on your computer when that comes out, which is probably this week during BlizzCon, and how easy is it to get a StarCraft downloader

1725
02:21:48,066 --> 02:21:49,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Check that out at battle.net

1726
02:22:12,383 --> 02:22:14,625
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1727
02:22:32,200 --> 02:22:36,922
[SPEAKER_03]: The vodka is actually actual potato vodka that I filtered myself.

1728
02:22:37,762 --> 02:22:45,344
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one has, I believe, plum, nectarine, and a couple of other fruits in it.

1729
02:22:45,384 --> 02:22:45,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

1730
02:22:45,844 --> 02:22:46,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I made it a while back.

1731
02:22:46,625 --> 02:22:47,345
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty potent.

1732
02:22:47,685 --> 02:23:15,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice, alright, so the sky plane's open, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio And I will do a shot for each call that we get tonight Everyone call You can't just call in and say, I'm only calling because I want you to do a shot You have to tell us something We've had a lot of topics tonight, including the games of the generation and so forth So there's plenty to discuss And I have my shot glass here, I have a tall shot glass Alan collects shot glasses, and I just happened to grab this one, it says Canada on it So I guess, shout out It will be a polite shot

02:24:08,024 --> 02:24:10,446
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about restaurant chains and where they are in the country.

1751
02:24:11,640 --> 02:24:14,342
[SPEAKER_07]: I noticed somebody said Rax Roast Beef earlier.

1752
02:24:14,362 --> 02:24:16,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, oh my god, that's a blast from the past.

1753
02:24:16,324 --> 02:24:20,367
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what was a big blast for me that I don't have anymore was Kenny Rogers Roasters.

1754
02:24:21,147 --> 02:24:21,868
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a thing?

1755
02:24:22,308 --> 02:24:24,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's basically like Boston Market.

1756
02:24:25,190 --> 02:24:26,411
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost exactly the same.

1757
02:24:26,451 --> 02:24:28,713
[SPEAKER_03]: So in Boston Market, I was like, oh, that's neat.

1758
02:24:29,053 --> 02:24:29,694
[SPEAKER_07]: That is awesome.

1759
02:24:29,734 --> 02:24:32,276
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we are starting to get some calls here, so let's go to it.

1760
02:24:32,536 --> 02:24:33,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Science Radio.

1761
02:24:33,456 --> 02:24:33,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1762
02:24:34,617 --> 02:24:35,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, this is TechQ.

1763
02:24:35,998 --> 02:24:36,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, TechQ?

1764
02:24:37,019 --> 02:24:37,419
[SPEAKER_07]: TechQ?

1765
02:24:38,550 --> 02:24:38,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1766
02:24:39,050 --> 02:24:40,271
[SPEAKER_07]: What is on your mind, TechQ?

1767
02:24:40,351 --> 02:24:42,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wait, first, before I get to what's on your mind, let me hold on.

1768
02:24:43,012 --> 02:24:44,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God, this bottle's hard to open.

1769
02:24:44,373 --> 02:24:44,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

1770
02:24:47,514 --> 02:24:48,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Did everyone hear that?

1771
02:24:48,855 --> 02:24:51,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Will you talk to TechQ for me, DarkSakura, while I pour a shot here?

1772
02:24:51,956 --> 02:24:53,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob is pouring himself some pink liquor.

1773
02:24:54,097 --> 02:24:56,398
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you have to talk about tonight?

1774
02:24:57,338 --> 02:25:04,162
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to comment about the News of the Generation that you did earlier.

1775
02:25:04,762 --> 02:25:06,863
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all forgot to mention the Red Ring.

1776
02:25:08,165 --> 02:25:09,585
[SPEAKER_03]: 360.

1777
02:25:08,505 --> 02:25:09,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there was the red ring.

1778
02:25:11,326 --> 02:25:13,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, the 360 red ring.

1779
02:25:14,526 --> 02:25:15,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

1780
02:25:15,846 --> 02:25:21,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do you... I mean, obviously, I can answer this too, but why do you feel this was a defining moment of the generation?

1781
02:25:22,788 --> 02:25:36,030
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it affected, like, 90% of all 360s that were sold up to a point until they finally admitted that it was shoddy...

1782
02:25:37,560 --> 02:25:42,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Hardware that they sold I would hope they would They wouldn't get my money

1783
02:25:58,196 --> 02:26:00,897
[SPEAKER_00]: if I were going to get an X-Bone.

1784
02:26:02,298 --> 02:26:04,319
[SPEAKER_07]: What are your thoughts on the upcoming generation?

1785
02:26:04,379 --> 02:26:06,359
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we had the Fugo question of the week earlier.

1786
02:26:06,719 --> 02:26:08,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you jumping in on any of these new consoles?

1787
02:26:08,600 --> 02:26:10,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you taking a wait-and-see approach or what?

1788
02:26:11,401 --> 02:26:15,843
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I traded in my 360, why not get a PS4 cheap?

1789
02:26:16,503 --> 02:26:20,105
[SPEAKER_07]: But that is interesting that you traded in the Microsoft console to get the Sony console.

1790
02:26:20,225 --> 02:26:21,865
[SPEAKER_07]: What weighed in on that decision?

1791
02:26:21,925 --> 02:26:23,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that just about price or what?

1792
02:26:24,501 --> 02:26:51,421
[SPEAKER_07]: um it's basically before they did the 180 mantra back in before in July I was just disgusted with them on their policy especially on the the used game DRM crap that they try to pull so it was probably one of those things where by the time they reversed course it was too late you'd pre-ordered your PS4 right yeah yeah makes sense all right well uh Tech Q anything else you want to share with us tonight

1793
02:26:52,557 --> 02:26:53,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't get too drunk.

1794
02:26:53,357 --> 02:26:54,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't get too drunk.

1795
02:27:20,104 --> 02:27:21,485
[SPEAKER_07]: It has yumminess in it, I'll tell you that.

1796
02:27:21,505 --> 02:27:24,287
[SPEAKER_07]: But we've got, surprise, surprise, now we're getting tons of calls.

1797
02:27:24,307 --> 02:27:25,507
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got another call coming in.

1798
02:27:25,547 --> 02:27:26,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1799
02:27:26,488 --> 02:27:26,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1800
02:27:27,488 --> 02:27:30,470
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Ranma, and I am going to do a shot with you.

1801
02:27:30,690 --> 02:27:31,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck yes.

1802
02:27:31,370 --> 02:27:33,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, DarkSakura's my bartender right now.

1803
02:27:33,351 --> 02:27:34,412
[SPEAKER_07]: She's pouring me a shot.

1804
02:27:34,912 --> 02:27:35,833
[SPEAKER_07]: She's such a good friend.

1805
02:27:35,873 --> 02:27:38,854
[SPEAKER_07]: She not only makes me the liquor, but then she pours it out for me.

1806
02:27:38,894 --> 02:27:40,015
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a true friend right there.

1807
02:27:40,375 --> 02:27:41,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes, indeed.

1808
02:27:41,376 --> 02:27:43,457
[SPEAKER_07]: I have my whipped cream vodka right here.

1809
02:27:43,717 --> 02:27:47,579
[SPEAKER_07]: When I'm old and in a wheelchair, she'll be switching out my IV bag with liquor.

1810
02:27:48,140 --> 02:27:50,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, here we go, I got the shot, you ready buddy?

1811
02:27:51,282 --> 02:28:00,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit, I just took a shot, let me do another one, okay, whenever you're ready Alright, let me know when you're ready Ready One, two, three Down in one

1812
02:28:02,628 --> 02:28:02,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

1813
02:28:02,848 --> 02:28:03,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it burn nicely?

1814
02:28:04,610 --> 02:28:04,891
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good.

1815
02:28:04,951 --> 02:28:05,872
[SPEAKER_07]: I left a drop in the glass.

1816
02:28:06,413 --> 02:28:07,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you can't have that.

1817
02:28:07,454 --> 02:28:07,754
[SPEAKER_07]: My bad.

1818
02:28:08,595 --> 02:28:08,956
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1819
02:28:09,356 --> 02:28:11,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that that's taken care of, what's on your mind, buddy?

1820
02:28:12,380 --> 02:28:14,682
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just amused by the whole PlayStation FAQ.

1821
02:28:15,063 --> 02:28:17,306
[SPEAKER_06]: It just amuses the living shit out of me.

1822
02:28:17,686 --> 02:28:18,227
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like...

1823
02:28:19,500 --> 02:28:24,842
[SPEAKER_06]: When the prior gen came in, it was like, it can play video games, it can do this, this, and that.

1824
02:28:24,882 --> 02:28:27,123
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, can it play Street Fighter?

1825
02:28:27,383 --> 02:28:28,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, but it can also do this.

1826
02:28:28,904 --> 02:28:30,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Can it play Street Fighter?

1827
02:28:30,945 --> 02:28:31,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it can play Street Fighter.

1828
02:28:31,965 --> 02:28:32,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1829
02:28:33,006 --> 02:28:35,407
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 4, it can only play Street Fighter.

1830
02:28:36,087 --> 02:28:37,408
[SPEAKER_06]: But I want to do all of this.

1831
02:28:38,028 --> 02:28:39,309
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can only play Street Fighter.

1832
02:28:39,669 --> 02:28:40,809
[SPEAKER_06]: But I want to do this.

1833
02:28:41,029 --> 02:28:43,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you should have kept your prior gen console now, shouldn't you?

1834
02:28:44,831 --> 02:28:46,532
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds too much like a Microsoft line.

1835
02:28:48,365 --> 02:28:50,247
[SPEAKER_06]: See, that's the funny part.

1836
02:28:50,567 --> 02:28:55,030
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like when Microsoft came out the gate running their mouth with everything that they're going to do.

1837
02:28:55,731 --> 02:28:57,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone had their guns ready.

1838
02:28:57,392 --> 02:29:00,755
[SPEAKER_06]: They were going to Microsoft's castle and just hang Dracula.

1839
02:29:01,696 --> 02:29:04,358
[SPEAKER_06]: And Sony's like, they're like Gendo.

1840
02:29:04,378 --> 02:29:05,999
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, we're just going to wait this out.

1841
02:29:07,080 --> 02:29:08,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Now they're waiting it out.

1842
02:29:08,541 --> 02:29:10,482
[SPEAKER_06]: And Sony's like, we're going to do a little bit of this.

1843
02:29:10,983 --> 02:29:11,924
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to do a little bit of that.

1844
02:29:12,144 --> 02:29:13,044
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to do a little bit of this.

1845
02:29:13,605 --> 02:29:14,786
[SPEAKER_06]: And the people are like, wait a minute.

1846
02:29:15,811 --> 02:29:16,752
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1847
02:29:36,809 --> 02:29:37,149
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com

1848
02:30:02,144 --> 02:30:02,724
[SPEAKER_06]: True, true.

1849
02:30:03,485 --> 02:30:08,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't hate on them for that, but I'm amused where they're saying no DLNA.

1850
02:30:08,767 --> 02:30:10,367
[SPEAKER_06]: My train of thought is, well, you know what?

1851
02:30:10,688 --> 02:30:15,169
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can't watch my anime on the PlayStation 4, I'll just fire up my PlayStation 3.

1852
02:30:16,390 --> 02:30:19,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of feel like that's one of the first things you're going to see get reversed.

1853
02:30:19,991 --> 02:30:27,014
[SPEAKER_07]: I really think they're listening, and I think they're going to come back and be like, whoa, we didn't realize people were going to make a big deal out of this and miss this.

1854
02:30:27,054 --> 02:30:29,255
[SPEAKER_07]: So I kind of suspect you're going to see it.

1855
02:30:30,123 --> 02:30:31,224
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it, I believe it.

1856
02:30:31,244 --> 02:30:36,527
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a little bit of time, which is why I am not running out in the next 12 days to buy one.

1857
02:30:37,568 --> 02:30:44,652
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's also part of the reason, I mean, not just the video, it's just the expense and everything and the whole fact that, you know, the games are disappearing that I was going to pick up.

1858
02:30:46,393 --> 02:30:49,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, from the trailer, I mean, when the promo for the console...

1859
02:30:50,814 --> 02:30:51,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1860
02:31:12,219 --> 02:31:13,099
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1861
02:31:39,434 --> 02:31:44,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Not just me, because as GF Day I can tell you, I'm more of a Mario Kart whore than anything else.

1862
02:31:44,539 --> 02:31:44,599
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1863
02:31:59,787 --> 02:32:01,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes and no, but I'll tell you this now.

1864
02:32:02,888 --> 02:32:05,348
[SPEAKER_06]: F-Zero on 3DS would be sick.

1865
02:32:05,789 --> 02:32:07,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we've played F-Zero.

1866
02:32:08,209 --> 02:32:10,970
[SPEAKER_06]: The game plays a lot faster than Mario Kart.

1867
02:32:11,010 --> 02:32:12,510
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot faster speed.

1868
02:32:12,910 --> 02:32:14,051
[SPEAKER_06]: It's tighter controls.

1869
02:32:14,551 --> 02:32:17,491
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like I said, I have the XL.

1870
02:32:17,811 --> 02:32:19,332
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's no fucking blue shells.

1871
02:32:20,112 --> 02:32:20,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1872
02:32:20,852 --> 02:32:23,393
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, all the 3DS games I play on the XL now...

1873
02:32:24,312 --> 02:32:27,853
[SPEAKER_06]: They feel a lot more surreal, a lot more in-depth, and I have a lot more fun playing them.

1874
02:32:28,133 --> 02:32:32,274
[SPEAKER_06]: So, F-Zero on that, Mario Kart on it, I'm sold.

1875
02:32:32,914 --> 02:32:33,614
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, yes.

1876
02:32:34,775 --> 02:32:35,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1877
02:32:35,915 --> 02:32:38,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, I don't know about you, Ranma, I'm starting to feel this liquor a little bit.

1878
02:32:38,956 --> 02:32:39,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Feels good.

1879
02:32:40,416 --> 02:32:41,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Not me, man.

1880
02:32:41,396 --> 02:32:49,098
[SPEAKER_06]: And I shouldn't even be taking another shot, because I gotta get up at 6.30 for work, and I have a near 90-minute commute to work now.

1881
02:32:49,238 --> 02:32:51,899
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a way better tolerance than I, that's all I can say.

1882
02:32:53,164 --> 02:32:55,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I will send you some of my liver powers.

1883
02:32:57,646 --> 02:33:02,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, my liver powers have been dared through Patty because she's heavy-handed when she pours.

1884
02:33:02,449 --> 02:33:07,171
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Rob, when you come out here to the East Coast, you'll spend a week with her.

1885
02:33:07,531 --> 02:33:09,932
[SPEAKER_06]: When you come back, you'll have an iron liver.

1886
02:33:10,613 --> 02:33:12,794
[SPEAKER_07]: I really am hoping to get back out to New York in 2014.

1887
02:33:13,294 --> 02:33:14,134
[SPEAKER_07]: It is one of the goals.

1888
02:33:14,194 --> 02:33:17,396
[SPEAKER_07]: If for nothing else than to see NPH and Hedvig.

1889
02:33:17,696 --> 02:33:18,436
[SPEAKER_07]: That's got to happen.

1890
02:33:20,596 --> 02:33:22,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Worst case scenario, send a box.

1891
02:33:22,337 --> 02:33:22,657
[SPEAKER_03]: As who?

1892
02:33:23,338 --> 02:33:23,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Hedvig.

1893
02:33:24,118 --> 02:33:24,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Willie.

1894
02:33:24,678 --> 02:33:24,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1895
02:33:25,999 --> 02:33:26,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.

1896
02:33:26,419 --> 02:33:26,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, right?

1897
02:33:27,440 --> 02:33:27,680
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1898
02:33:28,160 --> 02:33:30,581
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to send two boxes now, huh?

1899
02:33:31,182 --> 02:33:31,582
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, buddy.

1900
02:33:31,602 --> 02:33:32,943
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls.

1901
02:33:33,403 --> 02:33:33,783
[SPEAKER_07]: You got it.

1902
02:33:33,843 --> 02:33:34,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Stay fabulous.

1903
02:33:34,563 --> 02:33:34,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

1904
02:33:34,924 --> 02:33:35,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.

1905
02:33:35,344 --> 02:33:35,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Stay black.

1906
02:33:36,484 --> 02:33:37,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, brother.

1907
02:33:37,305 --> 02:33:37,585
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1908
02:33:37,665 --> 02:33:37,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1909
02:33:38,265 --> 02:33:38,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1910
02:33:39,926 --> 02:33:40,226
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1911
02:33:40,246 --> 02:33:44,148
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1912
02:33:44,168 --> 02:33:46,810
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the New York – I love the New York listeners of Orange Lounge Radio.

1913
02:33:46,910 --> 02:33:48,631
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fun group and it's been way too long.

1914
02:33:48,651 --> 02:33:49,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go back out there.

1915
02:33:49,851 --> 02:33:54,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of the New York Orange Lounge radio listeners, I know this guy hasn't listened for a while, but I just saw this in chat.

1916
02:33:54,473 --> 02:33:56,713
[SPEAKER_07]: SJ100Matt said this in chat and I was like, no way, really?

1917
02:33:57,153 --> 02:34:01,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently Sephiroth1215 won one of the PlayStation 4s through Taco Bell.

1918
02:34:02,295 --> 02:34:03,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1919
02:34:03,375 --> 02:34:03,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1920
02:34:03,976 --> 02:34:04,816
[SPEAKER_07]: So congrats.

1921
02:34:04,836 --> 02:34:05,716
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's awesome.

1922
02:34:05,916 --> 02:34:07,257
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to win tacos, really.

1923
02:34:07,537 --> 02:34:07,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah?

1924
02:34:08,417 --> 02:34:09,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just tacos.

1925
02:34:09,157 --> 02:34:10,718
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm starting to feel a little bit like spinny.

1926
02:34:10,978 --> 02:34:11,518
[SPEAKER_07]: These are spinny.

1927
02:34:11,858 --> 02:34:12,238
[SPEAKER_07]: And look.

1928
02:34:12,458 --> 02:34:12,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Pouring another.

1929
02:34:13,138 --> 02:34:14,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Skypline's lighting up.

1930
02:34:15,319 --> 02:34:17,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty soon I'm not even going to be able to click on the answer button.

1931
02:34:18,755 --> 02:34:20,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Eyes Radio, who's this?

1932
02:34:20,957 --> 02:34:21,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, this is Actdeft.

1933
02:34:22,098 --> 02:34:26,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Actdeft, hold on, we'll get to your call in a minute, but there's something I gotta do first.

1934
02:34:28,443 --> 02:34:33,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have a name for that, when you drink a shot, it's called Hidalgo.

1935
02:34:35,509 --> 02:34:38,712
[SPEAKER_01]: When you take a shot of public glass, so yeah, do it.

1936
02:34:38,872 --> 02:34:39,973
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it mean, Hidalgo?

1937
02:34:39,993 --> 02:34:42,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Hidalgo, it's a name, it's...

1938
02:34:43,476 --> 02:34:50,538
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the name of one of the founding fathers of the nation.

1939
02:34:50,698 --> 02:34:51,458
[SPEAKER_01]: So Hidalgo.

1940
02:34:51,498 --> 02:35:01,100
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where the name comes from for taking a shot, but it's something I've heard throughout the years.

1941
02:35:01,340 --> 02:35:01,720
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1942
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:02,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough.

1943
02:35:02,240 --> 02:35:06,221
[SPEAKER_07]: I gave a shout out to the Canadians earlier, so this one goes out to my Mexicans down below.

1944
02:35:06,281 --> 02:35:06,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

1945
02:35:06,761 --> 02:35:08,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did put the stuff in a Petron bottle.

1946
02:35:09,782 --> 02:35:10,122
What?

1947
02:35:11,354 --> 02:35:12,815
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go, Actdeft.

1948
02:35:12,895 --> 02:35:14,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it count that I put it in a Patron bottle?

1949
02:35:16,038 --> 02:35:16,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Perhaps.

1950
02:35:16,458 --> 02:35:17,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, what's on your mind, buddy?

1951
02:35:17,379 --> 02:35:17,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I took the shot.

1952
02:35:17,979 --> 02:35:18,279
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up?

1953
02:35:19,440 --> 02:35:25,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I wanted to talk about the influential game of the generation, or most influential.

1954
02:35:26,846 --> 02:35:29,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, what do you believe is the most influential game of the generation?

1955
02:35:30,909 --> 02:35:31,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Portal.

1956
02:35:32,089 --> 02:35:32,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Portal.

1957
02:35:32,510 --> 02:35:35,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, you mentioned this in chat earlier, and Jamie somewhat agreed with you.

1958
02:35:35,952 --> 02:35:36,873
[SPEAKER_07]: It was her number two pick.

1959
02:35:37,233 --> 02:35:38,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Why did you pick Portal?

1960
02:35:39,677 --> 02:35:59,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, while Portal didn't do anything that, well, how to say, that special or that original, besides the portals or the physics in the game, that's something that we already seen in other games, especially like Half-Life and stuff like that.

1961
02:36:00,964 --> 02:36:04,385
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was influential because of the storytelling, basically.

1962
02:36:05,618 --> 02:36:12,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the games after Portal try to imitate something in the storytelling in them.

1963
02:36:13,743 --> 02:36:21,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Like games, at least in a more serious and more detailed, well, not detailed, sorry.

1964
02:36:21,748 --> 02:36:23,389
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to gather my words.

1965
02:36:23,649 --> 02:36:24,730
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.

1966
02:36:25,390 --> 02:36:27,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that because of GLaDOS, you think?

1967
02:36:27,812 --> 02:36:29,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, everybody loves that character.

1968
02:36:31,181 --> 02:36:48,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, part of that, and part of Shell being mute, it's basically like playing Zelda or playing Mario where the main characters are mute, but since this is a first-person game,

1969
02:36:49,896 --> 02:36:55,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Game, so basically they're talking to you, so it's a more personal maybe.

1970
02:36:56,279 --> 02:37:11,406
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the experience around it, because it's like, especially because of that, it's a first person, it's a most personal, sorry, more personal experience all around.

1971
02:37:11,966 --> 02:37:17,568
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the one doing the stuff, all the stuff happens to you directly, so it's

1972
02:37:18,909 --> 02:37:23,214
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of games after Portal have kind of imitated that.

1973
02:37:24,115 --> 02:37:36,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Not maybe in a first-person perspective, but more in what happens in the decisions that you make or the other stuff that you do in the game.

1974
02:37:36,928 --> 02:37:38,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, basically, it's you.

1975
02:37:39,983 --> 02:37:43,125
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what also was great about first-person shooters?

1976
02:37:43,825 --> 02:37:45,606
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm starting to slur a little bit.

1977
02:37:46,006 --> 02:37:49,468
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what was great about Portal besides just what you're talking about, like the immersion and all that?

1978
02:37:50,428 --> 02:37:54,951
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing that was great about Portal is that it was a first-person shooter game for people that hate first-person shooters.

1979
02:37:56,151 --> 02:37:56,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, basically.

1980
02:37:57,412 --> 02:37:57,852
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, really.

1981
02:37:58,452 --> 02:38:07,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody I know that hates first-person shooters still loves Portal because it's more a puzzle, obviously, but yet it is that first-person game.

1982
02:38:09,569 --> 02:38:15,473
[SPEAKER_01]: and especially that because I got the orange box on the 360 basically for Portal.

1983
02:38:16,354 --> 02:38:21,978
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't finish even the Half-Life 2 and didn't even start episode 1 and 2.

1984
02:38:23,078 --> 02:38:25,160
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Team Fortress and I still play it.

1985
02:38:25,500 --> 02:38:26,921
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a game I enjoy.

1986
02:38:27,781 --> 02:38:31,144
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically I got the orange box

1987
02:38:31,784 --> 02:38:34,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of Portal, and I played a hell of a lot of it.

1988
02:38:35,547 --> 02:38:37,668
[SPEAKER_01]: I have three different copies of it.

1989
02:38:39,229 --> 02:38:41,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Two on the Xbox.

1990
02:38:41,130 --> 02:38:43,192
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the Orange Box and Still Alive.

1991
02:38:43,872 --> 02:38:45,913
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got the copy on Steam.

1992
02:38:46,734 --> 02:38:48,475
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love that game a lot.

1993
02:38:49,936 --> 02:38:51,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, it's an immersive game.

1994
02:38:52,778 --> 02:38:53,899
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally immersive.

1995
02:38:54,179 --> 02:38:59,022
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, a lot of games have tried to replicate that immersion.

1996
02:39:02,044 --> 02:39:03,525
[SPEAKER_01]: and succeed in it.

1997
02:39:03,805 --> 02:39:12,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all of them, but that's basically the legacy Portal has handed down to gaming.

1998
02:39:13,008 --> 02:39:18,530
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a pretty important thing in this generation and probably in the next.

1999
02:39:18,910 --> 02:39:22,392
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and, and, very important with Portal and Jonathan Colton.

2000
02:39:23,432 --> 02:39:24,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

2001
02:39:25,333 --> 02:39:25,553
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2002
02:39:25,573 --> 02:39:27,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Actdeft, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show.

2003
02:39:27,694 --> 02:39:28,954
[SPEAKER_07]: But thank you so much for your call, buddy.

2004
02:39:29,795 --> 02:39:30,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2005
02:39:30,235 --> 02:39:30,475
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2006
02:39:30,515 --> 02:39:30,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

2007
02:39:33,831 --> 02:39:34,151
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2008
02:39:34,731 --> 02:39:36,192
[SPEAKER_07]: That does it for calls tonight.

2009
02:39:36,572 --> 02:39:37,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I know.

2010
02:39:37,312 --> 02:39:39,872
[SPEAKER_07]: More of you wanted to call in to get me to take more shots.

2011
02:39:39,912 --> 02:39:41,193
[SPEAKER_07]: But you guys, it's a school night.

2012
02:39:41,233 --> 02:39:45,013
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to work tomorrow, and I'm already feeling a little bit tipsy.

2013
02:39:45,074 --> 02:39:47,814
[SPEAKER_07]: So I asked the bartender to call me off.

2014
02:39:47,874 --> 02:39:48,714
[SPEAKER_07]: To call it off.

2015
02:39:48,814 --> 02:39:49,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Close it down.

2016
02:39:49,434 --> 02:39:50,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut it down.

2017
02:39:50,075 --> 02:39:50,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Cut you off.

2018
02:39:50,775 --> 02:39:51,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Cut me off.

2019
02:39:51,455 --> 02:39:52,335
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I was looking for.

2020
02:39:52,355 --> 02:39:53,935
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got you water because I'm nice.

2021
02:39:54,015 --> 02:39:55,636
[SPEAKER_07]: You are a good friend.

2022
02:39:56,956 --> 02:39:58,196
[SPEAKER_03]: I would help you hide bodies.

2023
02:39:58,976 --> 02:40:00,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you hold my head over the toilet?

2024
02:40:00,777 --> 02:40:02,257
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd hold your hair back if you had enough.

2025
02:40:04,963 --> 02:40:06,224
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about long hair.

2026
02:40:06,284 --> 02:40:07,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Jerk.

2027
02:40:07,605 --> 02:40:08,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob.

2028
02:40:08,245 --> 02:40:09,966
[SPEAKER_07]: You know I have a complex about that.

2029
02:40:10,026 --> 02:40:10,066
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2030
02:40:10,086 --> 02:40:10,567
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just kidding.

2031
02:40:10,667 --> 02:40:10,967
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't.

2032
02:40:11,167 --> 02:40:12,348
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's funny.

2033
02:40:13,629 --> 02:40:14,929
[SPEAKER_03]: So I learned something today.

2034
02:40:15,170 --> 02:40:15,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, what?

2035
02:40:15,830 --> 02:40:17,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned what they call a comb over in Japan.

2036
02:40:18,792 --> 02:40:19,793
[SPEAKER_03]: A barcode hair.

2037
02:40:21,594 --> 02:40:22,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like that look at all.

2038
02:40:23,215 --> 02:40:26,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's kind of bad, but I still thought that was a funny thing.

2039
02:40:26,217 --> 02:40:29,279
[SPEAKER_07]: There is nothing wrong with rocking the bald look as far as I'm concerned.

2040
02:40:29,319 --> 02:40:29,839
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

2041
02:40:29,859 --> 02:40:30,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to shave it off?

2042
02:40:30,660 --> 02:40:30,800
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2043
02:40:31,040 --> 02:40:31,160
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2046
02:40:35,396 --> 02:40:37,718

2047
02:40:38,419 --> 02:40:39,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have glasses.

2048
02:40:39,260 --> 02:40:40,581

[SPEAKER_03]: Like mine.

2051
02:40:41,622 --> 02:40:42,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I try on your glasses right now?

2052
02:40:42,803 --> 02:40:43,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

2053
02:40:43,143 --> 02:40:44,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to take a picture of it.

2054
02:40:44,344 --> 02:40:44,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that's fine.

2055
02:40:45,385 --> 02:40:46,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Does my hair look okay?

2056
02:40:46,225 --> 02:40:46,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know.

2057
02:40:46,746 --> 02:40:48,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, what little hair I have?

2058
02:40:48,027 --> 02:40:50,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have any face diseases or anything.

2059
02:40:50,069 --> 02:40:51,970

[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2081
02:41:49,237 --> 02:41:52,239
[SPEAKER_07]: There were no tweets tonight that I saw that were stories or anything.

2082
02:41:52,279 --> 02:41:54,220
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to tweet us for a future week, Twitter.

[SPEAKER_07]: Once in a while we're going to take a week off.

2088
02:42:18,239 --> 02:42:18,659
[SPEAKER_07]: It happens.

2089
02:42:19,440 --> 02:42:26,283
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are going to be at BlizzCon, I'm unfortunately not going to the convention itself, which I talked about why on a previous episode of the show.

2090
02:42:26,623 --> 02:42:28,945
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will be at the World of Podcasts event.

2091
02:42:28,965 --> 02:42:29,965
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Thursday night.

2092
02:42:30,705 --> 02:42:32,787
[SPEAKER_07]: I will be there as will Grandpa from Horde House.

2095
02:42:38,670 --> 02:42:39,570
[SPEAKER_07]: We're really friendly.

2096
02:42:39,890 --> 02:42:40,951
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll probably be at the bar.

2097
02:42:41,551 --> 02:43:10,981
[SPEAKER_07]: so I'll probably be a little out of it like I am right now and that makes me extra friendly so come see us at World of Podcasts otherwise you'll have to catch me at DizCon the next day so for those of you that are going to BlizzCon for the rest of you we'll see you in two weeks back here on November 17th when we will be living in a world with the PlayStation 4 and soon the Xbox One yes a new era of gaming a new era of Orange Island Radio in a way even though none of us are going to get it but I imagine we'll all be playing somebody else's at least you know what we need to do we need to have a PS4 QQ party

2098
02:43:11,738 --> 02:43:12,399
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be fun.

2099
02:43:12,679 --> 02:43:14,521
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll just play PlayStation 1 games all night.

2100
02:43:15,301 --> 02:43:16,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Jumping Flash Marathon.

2101
02:43:16,422 --> 02:43:17,463
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought of Jumping Flash 2.

2102
02:43:17,544 --> 02:43:19,485
[SPEAKER_07]: This is why we're friends.

2103
02:43:19,625 --> 02:43:23,890
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to play PlayStation 1 games on your PS3 because it's 1 plus 3 and there you go.

2104
02:43:24,810 --> 02:43:27,473
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the way you think even though it's kind of ridiculous.

2105
02:43:27,573 --> 02:43:28,814
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's why we keep you around.

2106
02:43:28,834 --> 02:43:30,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have to get a battery for the Saturn.

2107
02:43:31,557 --> 02:43:33,779
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been telling Dan to bring one home from work and he hasn't.

2108
02:43:34,218 --> 02:43:37,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we're gonna wrap up the show.

2109
02:43:37,640 --> 02:43:38,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys very much.

2110
02:43:38,561 --> 02:43:40,322
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess we gotta go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2111
02:43:40,603 --> 02:43:44,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I'm forgetting something at the end of the show, but it's just because things are spinning a little bit right now.

2112
02:43:45,246 --> 02:43:47,427
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Loki, your final thought tonight.

2113
02:43:47,948 --> 02:43:53,492
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if the memory card adapter for the PlayStation 3 that they had at launch or whatever works with the Pocket Station.

2114
02:43:54,312 --> 02:43:55,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, did you have last minute stories?

2115
02:43:56,213 --> 02:43:56,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot to ask you.

2116
02:43:57,074 --> 02:43:57,294
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2117
02:43:57,314 --> 02:43:59,296
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't have last minute stories.

2118
02:44:00,156 --> 02:44:01,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Who does last minute stories anymore?

2119
02:44:02,298 --> 02:44:03,398
[SPEAKER_07]: It's November.

2120
02:44:04,059 --> 02:44:05,360
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.

2121
02:44:08,462 --> 02:44:09,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Words.

2122
02:44:10,203 --> 02:44:12,885
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought tonight is Disneyland.

2123
02:44:13,446 --> 02:44:14,206
[SPEAKER_07]: I missed you.

2124
02:44:14,226 --> 02:44:14,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Duffy.

2125
02:44:15,387 --> 02:44:16,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and Duffy.

2126
02:44:17,468 --> 02:44:19,970
[SPEAKER_07]: And DarkSakura gets to babysit because she's my friend.

2127
02:44:19,990 --> 02:44:20,751
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a good friend.

2128
02:44:21,051 --> 02:44:22,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we need to work out the details.

2129
02:44:22,152 --> 02:44:23,813
[SPEAKER_07]: You get me drunk and then you babysit my cat.

2130
02:44:24,653 --> 02:44:24,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2131
02:44:25,598 --> 02:44:26,639

2134
02:44:30,842 --> 02:44:36,465

2135
02:44:36,946 --> 02:44:46,732
[SPEAKER_07]: And without the three hours you have with us next week, that's at least three one-hour shows you could be listening to from some other hardworking independent podcasters.

2136
02:44:46,772 --> 02:44:48,673
[SPEAKER_07]: So please keep supporting independent podcasting.

2140
02:44:59,140 --> 02:45:00,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't even find the outro in this list.

2141
02:45:00,921 --> 02:45:01,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Where is it?

2142
02:45:02,101 --> 02:45:02,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it gone?

2143
02:45:02,701 --> 02:45:03,102
[SPEAKER_07]: There it is.
