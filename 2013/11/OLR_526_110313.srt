Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This week, Nintendo kills Swapnode via Spotpass, because children and penises!

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Ubisoft turns tail and drops its passport system for Assassin's Creed, and the PocketStation rumors get stronger with an intending announcement this week. All these plosives and more begin right now.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange, Lounge, Radio

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Greetings and Salutations

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I feel better than I have in a very long time

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Good. It's nice to feel great, in a good mood

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, except for the day's just been so weird because of ye olde time change, arr

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And to be honest, and just keeping it real y'all, I'm a little hungover today

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I'm a little, I'm a little like dragon

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Rob, you look amazing for a hungover

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well thank you

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Did you enjoy the vodka presence?

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I haven't, I haven't partaken in the vodka presence, I actually was planning to drink during tonight's show, which I'm sure the listeners would have loved, but now that I've, I kind of drank a lot last night

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You should try a shot of it, if you feel up to it later

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We'll see, we'll see, if the, if listeners, if y'all behave, and especially knowing that I don't have to get Alan after work now, he's on his way home right now, so I don't have to drive tonight at all, so I can be responsible

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Indeed

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,000
If listeners behave, I will take a shot, maybe at the beginning of part B, and the wine was already starting to get me to slur my words at the end of last week's show, so this should be hilarious

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm gonna have to get you a bottle of the honey run, because that stuff was, I love that stuff

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Good times

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And you were funny, but I have to say, I just forgot what I was gonna say, so please, oh yeah, I'm drunk on coffee and high on life

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Woohoo, alright, also say hello to somebody else who I'm sure is high on life, say hello to Techmaster Loki

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And actually, November's not a very busy month for games, although there are a couple big games coming out

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You've gotta be kidding, I was just thinking today, I was like, oh my god, November 22nd is the day the Xbox One comes out, right?

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Well, okay, on November 22nd, I've already bought, at Best Buy, and have to go pick up my Zelda 3DS, because I'm not getting the Xbox One right away, just probably next year, and then, you know what else comes out November 22nd is the Mario 3D World Land Cube

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's still not that much, really October was a busier month because you had a lot more releases

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Was it really? I just would have thought, well, you've got two consoles launching this month

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah, but, so, are you gonna count every single re-release of each of these games on different platforms as a separate title?

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I suppose not

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's just the same titles, they're just, oh hey, one comes out one week, one comes out the other week, and whatever

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So, really, you only have two major releases, next gen console and first party games aside, you pretty much just have Call of Duty, and Need for Speed, and then, I guess, the Mario, Super Mario 3D World, and that's about it

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Well, to be honest, I'm just keeping it real, I mean, I know everybody's excited about this new generation of games, but I'm probably, the single game I'm most excited about is that Wii U Mario game

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That, I think, is the game to be most excited about right now, I think those Mario games are, 90% of the time, solid as heck, and all the good, all the kind of early previews and reviews on that thing are really positive, so I don't think I have any reason not to be super excited about that game

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm more excited about that than anything I can think of on Playstation 4 or Xbox One, to be quite honest

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But the resolution that it played on the Xbox One was just terrible, zero P, I mean, it's same with the Playstation 4, zero P

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Is that why the fan wank fantasy of Nintendo making Xbox One games can't come true, because Xbox One wouldn't run away?

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I get no picture and sound at all, all I get is a stupid arrow that comes on the screen that says this disc is not compatible or it's dirty or something, I just don't get it, but

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Now, to be real, I don't really need the Zelda 3DS XL, I really don't need it, and my money could be better spent on other things

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Spray paint the damn, but, if you buy it, you can sell me your old one for Dan

42
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Oh, Dan wants a 3DS?

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Because he wants to play Zelda!

44
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Why doesn't he buy a Zelda 3DS?

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Because I have no job!

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What about a 2DS?

47
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I have a buyer earmarked right now, but if that falls through, certainly, that would be a good thing

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Dan, if you're listening to the show, which you're not, I'm not getting it for you at all, ever, no, I'm not, you don't need it

49
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So, yeah, anyway, I just want that Zelda 3DS, because it looks so dang cool, and I was so happy that it didn't end up being a GameStop exclusive and I could buy it at a bunch of other retailers

50
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So, yeah, I pre-ordered it at Best Buy, because I don't know if it's going to be limited quantity or what, and I just want to make sure I can

51
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah, they're always limited launch, like those Pokemon 3DS XLs, they're gone, they were gone after their first initial launch

52
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I still saw some on the shelf at Fry's

53
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah, they probably bought a ton and didn't sell them, but it's still, they only do them one batch and that's it

54
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Interesting, alright, well, let's see, I do want to also introduce our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com, because of course we are the show where every gamer has a voice

55
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You guys join us in the chatroom every week, and we like to read some of the comments from the chatroom

56
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's see, actdeft saying, I'm considering selling my Pikachu 3DS XL to get a Wii U, it would certainly be a start

57
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Brad from Pod Culture says, Skye, I'm such a sucker, I ordered Injustice for the PlayStation 4, already imported it for PlayStation 3

58
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But yeah, I mean, I know the reviews on that game were mixed, but you, Brad, really liked it, and, you know, I don't, if you like a game, then you like a game

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And I don't think there's anything wrong with getting it on multiple consoles if you truly enjoy a game

60
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Even though it's freaking weird

61
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Well, but that's, you know, opinions

62
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I know him, and I have to give him a hard time ever being a DC fanboy anyway

63
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah, well that's an age-old battle YouTube has been having forever

64
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But for me, I have Final Fantasy XIV on PlayStation 3 and PC, and some people think I'm weird for that

65
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Because you are

66
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You bet, I'm playing it on PlayStation 4 when that's available, so I'm excited about that

67
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Xtafur, our buddy from Horde House, is in chat tonight and says, That's one thing about Nintendo, you can bet that all their games will always run and look amazing on their systems

68
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This is why Mario 3D World looks so much better than most other things

69
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I don't know if they knock it out of the park 100% of the time with their games, because sometimes there's some misfires

70
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Like what, Steel Diver wasn't really the hottest 3DS game

71
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But not to totally dismiss your point, because it's one of the biggest perks of Nintendo and one of the biggest drawbacks

72
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Nobody does Nintendo better than Nintendo

73
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The bar is not really set very high for Nintendo either, I mean, because we're talking

74
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
No, I'm serious, so the type of game, though, it doesn't have to be that, it's cartoony

75
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It doesn't have to be that realistic

76
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And also it's a lot easier for them because they're developing on one platform as opposed to multi-platform

77
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But that kind of goes with any first party game that you're only going to have on one platform and it might look better

78
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Well, I was going to say, as theJ100Matt was saying, how many multiple copies of DDR do we have

79
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Except that they actually were kind of different from system to system and release to release, so it doesn't matter

80
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I was just about to read that same comment and go, well, it's very similar to the Madden games every year

81
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I mean, DDR was a type of Madden game

82
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah, that actually burned calories instead of making you put them on eating chips

83
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But still, it was music instead of players that changed

84
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That's all you had to change, though, was the music. The music changed the whole game

85
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The game itself, that's like saying, well, hey, Monopoly and another game that uses dice

86
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Monopoly and Dungeons and Dragons are exactly the same because they use dice

87
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Well, the whole point is that it's the content that makes the game, not the style

88
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Well, part of it is the content and the style

89
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Well, I mean, to use the D&D analogy, you use the same method every time you play

90
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But your content's different every time you play

91
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's the same with DDR and same, I hope, with the sports ball stuff

92
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Alright, well, we're having a fun conversation here at the top of the show

93
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But I wanted to get into the official kickoff topic that I had earmarked for tonight before we get into our gaming weeks

94
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And the kickoff topic I wanted to talk about tonight is, as I've mentioned in prior weeks on the show

95
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We are not going to be here next week, and it's kind of sort of because of BlizzCon

96
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm going to be out of town, even though I'm technically not going to BlizzCon

97
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Long story, but I'm going to DizCon and some of the parties, so there you go

98
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So we're not going to be here next week, so no show November 10th, sorry

99
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But we will be back on November 17th

100
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And if you think about it, when we're back with our first live show on November 17th

101
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
We will now live in a world that has a PlayStation 4 in it

102
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The next system for, you know, the next generation

103
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Although I know some people may say Wii U is in there, but, you know, well

104
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We all know Nintendo marches to the beat of their own drum

105
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Right? So, you know, okay, yeah, Wii U is there

106
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But PlayStation 4 is, like, you know, and Xbox One are like really kind of like that next level of power and graphics and so forth

107
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So this is really kind of the last episode of OLR to kind of put a cap on this generation

108
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Now, it's not that this generation is done, because obviously there's still plenty of 360 and PlayStation 3 games to come

109
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You don't kill your first child when you have your next child

110
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah, but, and there's even some speculation that this generation could continue if these new consoles tank, which is a possibility

111
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
If you were going to use that analogy, I would just be like this great, great, great, great, great grandmother

112
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But for most practical purposes, this generation is probably peaked

113
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And we're in a unique situation here at OLR that when these consoles launched in, what, 2005, 2006, we were around

114
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So we've actually been able to cover this entire generation of gaming from start to finish, you know, having done this show as long as we have

115
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So I'm kind of curious what my co-hosts feel, and I'll share my thoughts too

116
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I want to know, I want to know kind of what you think the most defining game of the generation was

117
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And I don't necessarily mean the best game of the generation, although that certainly may end up being for you the most defining

118
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But what do you think the most defining game of the generation was?

119
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And then I'm also going to ask so you can be thinking about it, and the chatters, you can think about this too

120
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What do you think was the most important thing that happened news-wise in this generation?

121
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Dark Soccer, you're already taking mic to mouth, what are your thoughts?

122
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Well, I'm going to go with the Mass Effect series, I mean, all three of them together because they're a series

123
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
No surprise hearing this from you

124
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Well, yeah, but I'm going to say this, that specifically it got me back into gaming this generation

125
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Because I, you know, I had my surgery, and you know, I played a bunch of games and, you know, was, I'm okay, oh this is fun

126
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh, this is neat, I'm going to go back and play Puyo Puyo, I always go back and play like my old games

127
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Because I am a classic gamer, but I have to say that since picking up the series and getting into the story again

128
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I've started checking out more and more new things as they've come out, I've started looking at other companies that do similar things

129
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That, well, as opposed to the sucky things that Bioware has done, but you know, companies that have similar types of titles

130
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I've got, I've been playing Dragon Age, I've been really expanding, and I think that it's just, it's the first series that's been out

131
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That had so engaging a story that I really, it's, and I've used this quote before, a friend of mine in Becky's

132
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Has said it's the best movie I've ever played, and you know how you go back and watch your favorite, how often have we seen Showgirls?

133
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But you know, you go back and you watch your, you know, your favorite show over and over even if part of it, you know, has sucked

134
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You know, even if you didn't like part of this story or didn't, or thought this could have been better

135
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You still go back and watch it if it's something that you love, especially if it's the universe that you like

136
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And I had actually gotten pretty kind of bored with it for a little while, and then I just went back and started over

137
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And I was like, well, you know what, this is kind of fun again, and started finding new things to enjoy

138
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And you know, so I'm actually kind of getting back into it, it's really funny

139
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But it was, you know, especially, you know, now I play it on PC, mind you, but it still goes in with the same generation

140
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And, you know, my second choice is actually up there too, I don't know if I can mention my second choice

141
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Sure, of course

142
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The Portal series, Portal and Portal 2, because those added in all kinds of different mechanics

143
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And made you use your brain as well as having just a delicious, starky humor in it that was fantastic

144
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And, you know, but the big two things about both of those is that you also have this community built up around it

145
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I hate to use the word fandom, but it really is just that

146
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's funny that you bring up Portal, because I'm looking at our chatroom, and of course we've got people naming their games

147
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Act Def says, the game that defined this generation, Portal

148
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And definitely probably in my top five, I would have put the orange box as one of the defining games of this generation

149
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Because it was such that immense value, but it also brought us Portal, it brought us, I think in many ways the orange box kind of set up Steam in a lot of ways

150
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And I realize Steam was around before, but I think a lot of people really got onto Steam in large part because of those orange box games

151
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And Steam has been, you know, I don't want to leave the PC and how they've been pacing alongside consoles out of this necessarily

152
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So I think the orange box really heavily contributed, that would definitely be my top five, it's not my number one, but yeah

153
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Well, here's the point I was going back to, why I call them defining games

154
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Is first of all, you do have, like you were just mentioning that side by side with PC, you're actually with so much crossover between consoles and PC

155
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You're expanding the fan base, you are building an actual bigger community instead of this us versus them mentality that's existed forever

156
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You've actually got both people playing these games, you know, how often have I modded Becky's save files for Mass Effect 2 and 3?

157
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Plenty of times, and you know, you've got this level of crossover, but it's, when you've got people who are so invested in the story that they've expanded around it

158
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That I think that you've made, you've really gotten a success story out of it

159
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I was really considering, I wasn't going to say the Mass Effect, I was really considering saying Mass Effect 3 is my game of the generation

160
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I knew you would say it though, so I'm going to pick something else, and I know a lot of people would say, why not 2?

161
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:04,000
How could you pick 3 over 2? And this is where I go, well it's not necessarily about the best, but it's about what defined this generation

162
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And I think in a lot of ways, you know, Mass Effect 3 introduced the multiplayer element of it, you know, which I love, and still get a lot of replayability out of it

163
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And I want to play again soon

164
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yeah, and it's still a great game, but then you get into that whole debacle about the ending

165
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And I think the internet backlash to that, whether you like it or not, was definitely one of the more noteworthy things to happen

166
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You know, the way that the fans in many ways revolted against what they put out for the game was something you wouldn't have seen in previous generations

167
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You know, like I think we all said around the time, Final Fantasy VII, thank god the internet wasn't out when people saw Final Fantasy VII's ending for the first time

168
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You probably would have seen something similar, and so I think that in many ways

169
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I liked the ending for that game

170
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I think that in many ways, for better or for worse, defined the generation

171
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So, I'll save my pick for just a minute here, Loki, what do you think was the game that defined the generation for better or for worse?

172
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Well, here's kind of a weird take on it, but I'm going to say Saints Row the Third

173
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And, unfortunately

174
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Is that just because it's you, though?

175
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
No, no, and hold on, let me explain

176
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's deep

177
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Where every gamer has a voice

178
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Deep

179
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's deep

180
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Saints Row deep

181
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Well, no, this is, and watch, hold on, you'll understand in just a sec

182
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So, here's why

183
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Saints Row was a great series, and I really enjoyed it

184
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And, I mean, pretty much the whole series has been in this generation so far

185
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Well, the reason why Third is most defining of this generation is because of all the business tactics that are being used in games nowadays

186
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It kind of introduced a lot of these things, at least to that series

187
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Like, for example, on disc DLC

188
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
DLC whoring

189
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Really terrible DLC that they charge a lot of money for and you get very little content out of

190
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Basically gutting what was a really good series and then turning it into some big monetization fest

191
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
That is this generation of games

192
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's basically something that you, they've done so much to where you actually hate the series

193
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And yet you'll still buy it the next year that it comes out

194
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
That's basically this series, this generation in gaming

195
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You take the abuse and you still come back

196
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Very interesting pick

197
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I have, I can't really get around it

198
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I have two picks for the game of the generation, but one of them is not really a game

199
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So let me start with, and I know people are going to roll their eyes at this

200
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But it really is, I think in many ways, the game that defined this generation, for better or worse

201
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I believe that game is Wii Fit

202
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Get off your ass the game?

203
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Kind of

204
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And I think that whole exer-gaming thing

205
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Now some might go, well why not Wii Sports?

206
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And believe me, I was thinking Wii Sports big time

207
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But I really was thinking about more Wii Fit

208
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
How that really took what Wii Sports did for the whole get up off your butt and move gaming

209
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And really pushed that forward

210
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And really for the first time, didn't make video games look like something for lazy people

211
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And I think that was a very important turning point in this generation

212
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
But DDR didn't?

213
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
DDR didn't catch on the way Wii Fit did because Konami didn't believe in it the way Nintendo did

214
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Whether we like it or not

215
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What's your point?

216
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I think when Nintendo really pushing Wii Fit and really getting it out there

217
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I think they really brought this counterbalance and moved the Wiis and exercise gaming altogether

218
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Into the commonplace

219
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Soccer moms were eating it up

220
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Retirement homes, grandmas were playing video games

221
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And this was like, you know, a huge thing

222
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I have another one by the way

223
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You can't just have one because it's hard to define a whole generation of that

224
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And yes this is not going to grant the thought of 5 again because that's just too easy

225
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Minecraft is another example of a thing that defines this generation

226
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You have an indie game that just goes crazy, just blows up

227
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You have basically all of the content out there

228
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The community, the YouTube videos, just all that sort of stuff

229
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And kind of almost kick starting I think a little bit of the indie resurgence you've seen

230
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Where, hey, these indie games can actually be very good

231
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And now you're seeing a lot more focus on indie titles and stuff that's not coming from a big publisher or developer

232
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Well that and the genre of sandbox games in general

233
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
That's been around forever

234
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
But it really brought that back up into the limelight

235
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
My other pick for the game, and I'm using my quotey fingers

236
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
That define this generation of games is Netflix

237
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm sorry, I didn't expect that, but yeah

238
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
But think about it, okay Netflix isn't a game, yes I know that

239
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,000
But didn't all our game consoles turn into something else, a little something else because of Netflix?

240
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Yes there's Hulu and all this other stuff too, but Netflix obviously being the biggest one

241
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And me just being a big fan of Orange is the New Black

242
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Isn't that the one that really just turned game consoles into entertainment centers?

243
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Not at my house

244
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
But we had a dedicated computer set up just for that, we didn't need to use any of that

245
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
But admittedly you're different

246
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And again, I'm thinking about the soccer mom families and so forth

247
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
There's people that go out there and buy Wii's because they're cheap Netflix boxes

248
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yeah there is that, I mean it's for the same reason that people bought PS2's because of them being a DVD player

249
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And the Blu-ray player for PS3

250
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And one of the other games I would throw out there

251
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And then we'll change topics here, I want to get into news stories

252
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
One of the other games that really define the generation

253
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And you know I say for better or for worse and in this case it's definitely for worse

254
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I think Farmville

255
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I just burped a bit

256
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
But whether you like it or not, mobile and Facebook gaming has become bigger and bigger lately

257
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And again it's the whole fact that it gets these people to play games

258
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Not just play them but obsess over them

259
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Like grandma's going out of town because she's going on a cruise for a week

260
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Can somebody watch her farm so her frickin' cows don't die or whatever it is

261
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That's my mother

262
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
See?

263
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Yeah

264
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Did your mother ever play video games before Farmville?

265
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Yes

266
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Oh

267
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
We used to have

268
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Damn you ruined my point I was trying to make

269
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
My mom and I used to get into screaming matches over Dr. Mario

270
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Which by the way her birthday is in two days so happy birthday

271
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Alright SSG100Matt says angry birds also, definitely for those same reasons

272
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Extover says I think Wii Sports would be more defining than Wii Fit to be honest

273
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It really was the defining moment for all motion control games

274
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I do agree to a point Extover and I think Wii Sports obviously was

275
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Well it was the biggest game this generation as far as sales go

276
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,000
But I think Wii Fit really took what Wii Sports started and just kind of put an exclamation point on it

277
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And that's kind of why I said Wii Fit

278
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I mean especially you start to look at how the Kinect and the Move really got a piece of that

279
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It was a lot more the exercise gaming and all that

280
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I mean look at all those games that come out they're all exercise games

281
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So anyway

282
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Tigerclaw says two words horse armor which you know definitely Skyrim I think is a game of the generation in some ways

283
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
There's a lot of people you know that can play that game and only that game and never anything but that game

284
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I just don't think that Skyrim brought anything really new

285
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Tal says or maybe that's Tal sorry for mispronouncing that says at least no one mentioned Journey

286
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You know Journey is a pretty incredible game though and I just Journey kind of stands on its own

287
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I don't think we've yet seen how Journey has inspired other games yet

288
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
But that might be coming in the next generation

289
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
But Journey I think Journey was an amazing game and one of the best of the generation

290
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
But I don't know if it necessarily defined it

291
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Kind of the difference there

292
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Or if it had to be something that added definition to this generation of gaming

293
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I would say that it added it brought back an artistic element that had been missing

294
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare

295
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Why?

296
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Because that just it basically steamrolled the franchise that they have now

297
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And then there was that whole divorce after that right or was that Modern Warfare 2?

298
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
That was after that

299
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
That was after Modern Warfare 2 I think

300
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
One more comment here and then I'll switch topics here

301
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Extrovert says for me The Last of Us is the epitome of the defining game of this generation

302
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
To me it was this generation's series finale

303
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
That's an interesting analogy there

304
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You know I can see that I mean I've wanted to play the game I haven't played it yet

305
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
But for everything that I've seen come up around it I'd have to agree with that

306
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Sort of like the cherry on top of the sundae

307
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I do like that analogy that it's the series finale

308
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I think that's a neat way of putting it

309
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And then we wake up and it's Bob Newhart in his bed

310
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It was all a dream

311
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Alright how about the news that defined this generation

312
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You might really have to rack your brain a little bit

313
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But what do you think was the news story that really defined this generation?

314
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I'd say it was a series of news stories

315
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
There might be more than one that you can think of

316
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But something off the top of your head

317
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And I ask this to chat as well

318
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Well I'm really going to go with a series of them

319
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Because they all go back to the same thing

320
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's all those stupid violence blaming video games

321
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Which we've got psychological studies proving the exact opposite

322
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
We have statistics showing that crime has decreased since the

323
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
When did the Nintendo come out? Was it 91? 90?

324
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
The original Nintendo? 85

325
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I don't know why I was saying that, but Super Nintendo

326
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I think you said Super Nintendo was 90 to 91

327
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Because we've had a decrease in armed crime amongst youth

328
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Over the last 20-30 years

329
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But they still go back and try to do this as scapegoat

330
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
It's still turning into this misunderstood thing

331
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
When in reality it's just another mask for what the real problem is

332
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So I think we're seeing a bigger increase of scapegoatism

333
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
In the news about video games

334
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Loki, any thoughts?

335
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
It's a tough question, especially live

336
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I can't even remember what happened last year

337
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Like you guys, I seriously told Loki in Dark Soccer

338
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Like 5 minutes before the show what was going to come up

339
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
As usually happens here in the world of live radio

340
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Well I'm just trying to think of big stuff

341
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
There's the PlayStation Network hacking thing

342
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Since you brought it up, that was my number one

343
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
The PlayStation Network hack

344
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I wouldn't even do that

345
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I don't know, it's just kind of to me

346
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Maybe the Xbox One announcement

347
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And kind of all the stuff that went wrong

348
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Like during E3 and kind of the reversal of that stuff

349
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It's kind of like this generation's

350
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Almost, I don't know, some people like the specs and stuff

351
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
That they have on the console and all the different DRM things and stuff

352
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
But it's almost like for the majority of the people

353
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I think it's like this kind of nightmare situation

354
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Like this is the way things are going

355
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And kind of demonstrating all the stuff that's kind of gone wrong in this generation

356
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I don't know, I can't really think of anything that's super defining in this

357
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
It's hard to say, there hasn't really been any huge, huge, huge changes I think

358
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I do think of two things that I would like to have been defining

359
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And one of them was how they were networking the PS3s as a computer to

360
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
What was it, leukemia or cancer research?

361
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Oh, the folding at home?

362
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Yeah, I thought that's something that should have been defining

363
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
But people like to look at the negative instead of the positive

364
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
But that and all of the charities that popped up around next generation gaming

365
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I'm not saying that they popped up with this generation

366
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
But they've certainly come to higher prevalence with this generation

367
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
We have Child's Play, Extra Life

368
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
A lot of them are going back and playing older consoles

369
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
But we're seeing a lot more of these popping up and getting attention

370
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I kind of tie that to the emergence of streaming your gameplay online

371
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And kind of Twitch TV and Ustream and all that

372
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I think that's one of the big things about this generation

373
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I think you see a lot of charity drives able to be done a lot easier

374
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
And a lot more ground roots, ground level types of fundraising

375
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Grassroots?

376
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Thank you, that's the word I was looking for

377
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Types of fundraising because of being able to stream your games online

378
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And just have that instant audience

379
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I kind of think that story is evolving as we move into PlayStation 4

380
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And Xbox 360 going to have that stuff in there

381
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So we'll get into the news in a minute here where there's some borders with that

382
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And what it will and won't do

383
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
But I think that is definitely a big story that's kind of bridging the two generations

384
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I would really like for stuff like that to be the defining news of the generation

385
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Really?

386
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
The most defining, I think the most defining thing ever of this generation

387
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
President Cat

388
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I more want to put it as you have communities of people coming together for a good cause through video games

389
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I love some of these answers here in chat

390
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And this is a great one that I didn't even think of

391
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And I'm sitting here going why, why didn't I think of this

392
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Tal in our chat room says Kickstarter

393
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Any Kickstarter related game

394
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And Black Wolf adds to that

395
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
The news story of this generation is either the emergence of Kickstarter

396
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Or the internet bitching enough that a storyteller changed the ending of the story they wanted to tell

397
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But you know both those things have something in common

398
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And that is the voice of the internet has become a huge thing this generation

399
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
If you think about it, I don't want to toot our own horn a little bit

400
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
But podcasting wasn't around last time

401
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Heck yeah

402
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And it is now

403
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And that's all a part of that

404
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
It's just the voice of the gamer getting a little louder

405
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
And those barriers, you know it used to be the magazine would come to my home

406
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And that was the only way I kind of kept tabs on what was going on in the gaming industry

407
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
But those barriers between us and the gaming industry are really coming down

408
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Twitter is a big part of that

409
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I can interact with developers directly for better or for worse

410
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Well in general though that would be an evolution of communication itself

411
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Where many communities are coming together

412
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And having that interactivity that we didn't have you know 30 years ago

413
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Or that we barely had 30 years ago I'll put it that way

414
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I mean I met my husband online

415
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I've made tons, like the chat room is full of you know friends of mine now

416
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
You know people I can call friends so

417
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And that I might not have met otherwise

418
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Absolutely

419
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And Tigerclaw says you could also add the whole thing with PSN being hacked and down for a few weeks

420
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I said it briefly but yeah that would actually be my number one most defining thing

421
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I think was when Playstation Network was hacked

422
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Because I think in a lot of ways how much information we're putting out there about ourselves easily

423
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I think a very tough lesson was learned in many ways all around the board

424
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Just like I think the last generation, the Xbox and Playstation 2

425
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I think the defining thing of that generation was Xbox Live

426
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:03,000
It's almost like the defining thing of this generation was when the trust there kind of fails us

427
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
If that makes sense

428
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Well that's how you were over the Xbox thing

429
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Well sure

430
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And you really do understand a lot more of the nature of marketing

431
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Watching the reactions between the two companies, how they responded to their respective hackings

432
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Also digital, I mean because there was a big push for Xbox Live Arcade

433
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And I mean that was something that happened

434
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And also you know full size digital games

435
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I mean granted I'm sure it was on the PC stuff a long time ago

436
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
But console wise you know digital has been a big thing

437
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
So it was that

438
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Alright well I'm sure you guys sitting there listening to the show have plenty more to add to this

439
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
So I invite you to email us or tweet us especially while we're down during the week

440
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And let us know what defined this generation be it game or news for you

441
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
That's mailbag at orangelandtrader.com or you can tweet us at OLR

442
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
One final thought Jamie

443
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I'd say the crappiest thing about this generation

444
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Manuals! We need manuals to come back

445
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And we need these companies to hire me to design them

446
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So in other words it's the downside to the digital stuff

447
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Exactly

448
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
The content is so beautiful I love manuals and I love posters

449
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And I love getting stuff with my game that I can put on my wall

450
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Or you know keep Midna from eating

451
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Alright let's move on

452
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I want to talk about our gaming weeks quickly we're running a little long tonight

453
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Because that was a great kick off topic thank you guys

454
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Let's quickly talk about our gaming week start Sakura

455
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I'm not playing Animal Crossing right now

456
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
At all, am I?

457
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Final Fantasy 14 I've been kind of stalling on that

458
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Just because I'm on my second job and it's so slow

459
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I was gifted thanks to DNL Dreams who is so sweet

460
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I gave her a box of yarn a while back

461
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And she has in return given me the Stanley parable

462
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
So I will be playing it very soon

463
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I played some fractal

464
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I have been playing a little bit more of the Super Mario 3D world

465
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
But like I said 3D kind of eh for me

466
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And Dan is playing Legend of Zelda

467
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Which ever the Oracle of Seasons ones is

468
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Our thing

469
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
He just finished Mimish Cap

470
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Is he doing Mimish Cap now?

471
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
He's doing one of them anyway

472
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
But Dan's going on this big Zelda kick lately

473
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
So my house has been full of Zelda music

474
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And lots of loud cursing

475
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And then in addition to that

476
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It's just been me hunting down stuff on Steam that I haven't played in a while

477
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And actually trying to get some use out of these games

478
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And stuff I've gotten on sale before

479
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
So what about you?

480
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I'm sorry I really read it

481
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Oh Reddit's funny

482
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
What have I played this week?

483
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Grand Theft Auto 5

484
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Yeah that would have been Grand Theft Auto 5

485
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
So I played a bit of online

486
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
We did a very short Va game night this week

487
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Thanks to the one person that came out

488
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I guess everybody else is doing more important things

489
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
But next week though

490
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Next week on Friday we will be doing

491
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Another Va game night

492
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
This time on Playstation 3

493
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So if you have the Playstation 3 version of Grand Theft Auto 5

494
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And wish to play with us online

495
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
We will be doing that

496
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
8.15 on Friday

497
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I should get Dan in on that

498
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Because he would be hilarious

499
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I mean he's hilarious anyway

500
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And he's also funny looking

501
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It'll be fun and I'm gonna try to get my coworkers

502
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
That are not too old

503
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
That won't fall asleep

504
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I swear to god

505
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
It's just like

506
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
You know my boss half the time

507
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Yeah I totally forgot to play last time

508
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Because I got home and I just fell asleep

509
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
How fucking old are you?

510
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You're not that old I mean seriously

511
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Naps are awesome what are you talking about?

512
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
It's like I was just so tired I couldn't play

513
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And then my other coworkers

514
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
You were like Raz and Mike

515
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You know our one IT guy

516
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Who just got the game

517
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
You're like I'll play you gotta make sure you're there

518
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Make sure you're there

519
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
He shows up everybody else does not

520
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It's like what the hell man

521
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
But yeah we'll be there

522
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I'm still working on my 100% stuff

523
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I'm doing the knife flights now

524
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Which I'm stuck on

525
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
One that's very near the

526
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Near the film lot

527
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
And it's a pain in the ass

528
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I can't get the plane low enough

529
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
To trigger it

530
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
So I don't know

531
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
But I got all my stunt jumps done

532
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And all my collectables done

533
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And I'm at 96% or 7% now

534
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
So I just have to do knife flights

535
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Fly under some bridges

536
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And go to the strip club with my friends

537
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
That's actually one of the things I have to do

538
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Alright

539
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
That it?

540
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
That's not a night in Los Santos without boobs

541
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
My gaming week was

542
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
A lot of Final Fantasy 14

543
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
As is to be expected as of late

544
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
But I'm having a great time in that game

545
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And Shane is bugging me

546
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
As are other members of my free company

547
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Are bugging me to finish my relic plus one

548
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Quest so I do really need to do that

549
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
But otherwise just having a good time

550
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Getting my darklight gear completed and all that

551
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
As far as other new games to talk about

552
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Well this one's not new

553
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
But it's like a fresh coat of paint

554
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
On an old classic and that would be the Wii U

555
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Virtual console release of Super Castlevania 4

556
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
And I was playing

557
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Because that came out

558
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Was it on Halloween or the day before?

559
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
It was this week

560
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And since I already had it on Wii

561
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It was only like a dollar to get the Wii U version

562
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Which was great

563
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
And before tonight's show I was sitting here playing it

564
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
And it was on the TV behind me

565
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
And Dark Soccer goes

566
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
It's so weird that when your TV moves by itself

567
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Hey you know I was really proud of myself

568
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
When I stepped in and I recognized it just where you had it paused

569
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I was like

570
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I look super Nintendo

571
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Absolutely

572
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
So yeah

573
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
An amazing classic

574
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And if for whatever reason you miss this game

575
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And you happen to own a Wii U

576
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I really urge you to pick it up

577
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I imagine most people that are on the Wii U

578
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Probably already played this at some point

579
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
But it is so worth it

580
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I mean even the fact that they charge $8 for it

581
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I think it's a worthy

582
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I mean the game was just ahead of its time

583
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
As far as platformers are concerned

584
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I love it so much

585
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Super Castlevania IV

586
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Love it

587
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Also earlier this week

588
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And I know we're going to get into this in the news

589
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
So it might be a little bit redundant

590
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
But on Monday, I think it was Monday

591
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
The Typing of the Dead Overkill came out

592
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Which is the new Typing of the Dead

593
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Based on the House of the Dead Overkill

594
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Which was the Wii version of the game

595
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
So when I heard there was a new Typing of the Dead

596
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I was like yes please buy

597
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Because it's what 50% off on Steam during the week

598
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
10 bucks yeah

599
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
20 bucks instead of 20 during the week

600
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So I bought it and I actually did some streaming

601
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Which you can see the archive on my YouTube

602
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Under user RobRobertsPlays

603
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I think it's my YouTube

604
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I'm having to get used to having a YouTube channel now

605
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
But I think the archive is at RobRobertsPlays

606
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
On YouTube and you can see me

607
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And I think Shane and Xtopher at some point

608
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Joined the call and we were just kind of playing through

609
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
The Typing of the Dead Overkill

610
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Which I remember Typing of the Dead on Dreamcast

611
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And I loved that game

612
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So I was a little sad in this new one

613
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Because the game's broadcast packs don't show on people's backs

614
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And there's not even the PC or whatever

615
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
It's just kind of a straight up port of the Wii version

616
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
But I didn't play the Wii version

617
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
So I honestly thought it was like a brand new game

618
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And I imagine there's a lot of you out there

619
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
That probably missed the Wii version

620
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
It was also on PlayStation 3

621
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Was it really? I don't remember at all

622
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Was it like a move game or something?

623
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
It was move enabled

624
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I think it also allowed you to use the analog sticks

625
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
If you really wanted to

626
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I guess I never really get into those games

627
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
On the home console

628
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
The last shooter game I really truly loved

629
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
At home was Point Blank

630
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And that was a long time ago

631
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
That needs to come back

632
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Those games were amazing

633
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I never really got into Time Crisis

634
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Or any of the on-rails shooters at home

635
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
That's more of an arcade thing to me

636
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I never really played House of the Dead

637
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
It sounded like you said Ass of the Dead for a minute

638
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
There's actually a reason I did not buy it

639
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Because I need bad voice acting

640
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
In my House of the Dead

641
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
We're beating G over there

642
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I do believe that this is the one

643
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
That had the most uses of fuck in it

644
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Oh my gosh

645
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It's so over the top

646
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And it's really dirty, nasty

647
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Dialogue and exploitation

648
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Films of the past

649
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Like Quentin Tarantino style

650
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
70s

651
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
It's crazy

652
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
So it was like House of 1000 Corpses the game?

653
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Kind of

654
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
If you're in the right mood for it, it's pretty funny

655
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Of course, the phrases that you type in

656
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Hilarious, the things that come up

657
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
We got one on the livestream that was

658
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Walrus Punch

659
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I don't know why that was so funny, but it was great

660
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And I saw a screenshot of one on the internet

661
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Where in the hospital level, there's a zombie

662
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
That gets up out of the bed and you have to type

663
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Thanks Obama

664
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
That was funny

665
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Ok, that's pretty cool

666
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Loved it

667
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
And a hitstun in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

668
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Says, I was also disappointed in the lack of

669
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And yes, it contains House of the Dead

670
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Overkill extended cut

671
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Yes, if you want to use your mouse and play the clicky click

672
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Version, you can do that too

673
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
But for me, it's all about the typing

674
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
You know what though, I do have to say

675
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
That the best thing to ever come

676
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Out of Typing of the Dead

677
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Was Cosplay I saw at AX one year

678
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
That had the Dreamcast pack

679
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And the keyboard and everything, that was awesome

680
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
That's awesome, amazing

681
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Alright, let's get into

682
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Gaming news

683
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
In housekeeping real quick though, before we get there

684
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Once again, I said this earlier, but just a reminder

685
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
We will not be here live next week

686
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
But I will be here live, just not on air

687
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Maybe you'll do a twitch thing

688
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Or something, I don't know

689
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I'll do my homework

690
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
And let you guys watch

691
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
We're taking a night off, because you know what

692
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Sometimes we want a night off

693
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Sneaking myself off in Rob's luggage

694
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Also

695
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
In housekeeping tonight, I want to mention

696
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
That we unveiled something new

697
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
At vognetwork.com tonight

698
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
You can hear the in-depth discussion on the Bobby Blackwolf

699
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Show when he posts his episode mid-week

700
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
But in a nutshell

701
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
The game at vognetwork.com

702
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Now includes a

703
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Raffle element

704
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
So in other words, when you check into shows, you get your points

705
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
You do all that

706
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
You can potentially earn

707
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Real crap that we will ship to you

708
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And this month's crap

709
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Is pretty good, it's Cards Against Humanity

710
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It's a sealed version of a very hard to get game

711
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
So yeah, I'm sure there'll be some people that want to get that

712
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
So all you have to do

713
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
You have to enter though, you're not automatically put in

714
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Just because you get points, you do have to enter

715
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And you can check that out at vognetwork.com

716
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Slash raffles, and I think that also shows up now

717
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
On the left side of the page

718
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Under your user info

719
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Contributors to the network

720
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
And people that have won in the past

721
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Few months will be ineligible

722
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And unfortunately

723
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
This particular month's raffle

724
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Is only open to US residents

725
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Because it's really expensive to ship overseas

726
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And it's coming out of our own pocket

727
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
So we can't have it yet overseas

728
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
But we're really hoping that some of the rewards

729
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
In future month will be digital oriented

730
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Which will be much easier for us to give to our overseas friends

731
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Because we want the game to be something

732
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Everybody can participate in

733
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And many of you have been until now

734
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
So we just want to say thank you very much

735
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
And hope you enjoy this new little twist

736
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
On the VOG Network game

737
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
One other thing I gotta say

738
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And then we can get into news

739
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
But this is important

740
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
And I want to wish a very happy episode number 400

741
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
To our friends over at Pod Culture

742
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Because they are hitting episodes

743
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
It's already been taped

744
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
But they are putting out episode number 400 this week

745
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
It debuts at VOG Network tomorrow

746
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
At 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern

747
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
That's Monday

748
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
But then it will be on their feed right after that

749
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And obviously 400 episodes is an amazing milestone

750
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Brad and his gang over there at Pod Culture

751
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Christina, Adam, all those guys

752
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Have been a great support of OLR

753
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Especially, especially Brad

754
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And the support that he's given

755
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
These projects here at OLR

756
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
He supports Horde House in a huge way

757
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Like he helped set up the website

758
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And get that show hosted

759
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
At Horde House

760
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
So I'm so appreciative for that

761
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
The microphones that we use here now at OLR

762
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Were kind of handed down from

763
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Brad from Pod Culture

764
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
So yeah, they've just been such a great support

765
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
And they're squishy

766
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And they're squishy

767
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
With the little foamy hats, yes they are

768
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
They're squishy, mine's red, I like it

769
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
It's for our listeners protection

770
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
That's right, that's right

771
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
So yeah, I just want to say a big thank you and congratulations

772
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Because 400 is an epic milestone

773
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I remember when you were just a wee hundred and fifty

774
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Alright

775
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
There you go, so congrats to all those guys

776
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Over there at Pod Culture

777
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
To register participation

778
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
For this week's episode of Orange Launch Radio

779
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
At vognetwork.com

780
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Alright, let's start with the gaming news tonight

781
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Loki, please, if you would, start us off with the news

782
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Well, you know, one of the

783
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Taglines for the Playstation 3

784
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Uh, this generation was

785
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
It only does, and then they list a ton of shit

786
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Well, this week they decided to put out a fact

787
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Or, they being Sony

788
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
They decided to put out a fact

789
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Outlining the stuff that the Playstation 4

790
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Won't do

791
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And that includes a few things at launch

792
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Which, you know, of course you're gonna have to update

793
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Your system and stuff

794
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
It's gonna lack DLNA support

795
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
So you're not really gonna be able to

796
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Stream stuff from media servers too easily

797
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Also, no support

798
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
It doesn't feature a music visualizer

799
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And that's

800
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Probably because it doesn't play any CDs

801
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And also

802
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Dynamic themes are not supported

803
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Which makes sense because it kind of

804
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Changed the whole user interface anyways

805
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And MP3 playback

806
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Is not gonna happen

807
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
And if you want to

808
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Listen to music

809
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Or see videos or that kind of thing

810
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
You can do that through

811
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Sony Musics

812
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
With their unlimited service

813
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
And video unlimited service

814
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
You know, actually

815
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Here's the thing

816
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I'm not entirely sure that you can't stream stuff

817
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
To your PS4

818
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Because I remember the Wii

819
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Had that kind of problem too

820
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Where you couldn't stream stuff

821
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
But they had a lot of services set up

822
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And it creates a web page on your network

823
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And you just do it through the web browser

824
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
So there might be a work around

825
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
But that's essentially a hack

826
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I mean, not like a hack

827
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Like you think we gotta do it

828
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
But it's a work around

829
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
It's still annoying that they did that

830
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
And the other thing they were saying too

831
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
The PlayStation 4 share button

832
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Record capabilities

833
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Apparently that is gonna be

834
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Kind of limited to

835
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Twitch

836
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
They're gonna upload videos to YouTube

837
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And um

838
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Yeah but couldn't you just export your video to Twitch

839
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
And then publish it to YouTube

840
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Like that's what I would think you would just be able to do

841
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Well right now it says all the archiving's gonna be done

842
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Through um

843
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Twitch

844
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Yeah it's very easy on Twitch to take an archive and post it to YouTube

845
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
That's how I got like the House of the Dead things on YouTube now

846
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
So I don't know

847
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I don't think that's a big deal

848
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
They have to have something in place if they want to protect

849
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Whatever they're doing

850
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
That makes sense

851
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
They're also saying Ustream footage will not be saved for later playback

852
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
So whatever

853
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Um

854
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
The other thing I was gonna mention

855
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
One of the things actually when Bobby was talking about on the show

856
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
And I had mentioned on the show

857
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Rob said, hey stay there for the show

858
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
My thoughts about the MP3 playback

859
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Cause it kinda sucks

860
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
And you know I've been seeing the conspiracy theory out there

861
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Where they're like, well they're just trying to get people to

862
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Participate in Sony's music unlimited service

863
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Or something like that

864
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And there's probably another reason behind it

865
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
If you think about it

866
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
First off they have to build it in the game

867
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
So that you know to have MP3 playback

868
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
But let's just assume that it works with games

869
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Kind of like how it does now

870
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
When you're doing the streaming

871
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
And granted they could probably create a way to

872
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I mean filter it out

873
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
But let's say they can't

874
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
So when you're doing your streaming

875
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
With your share button and all that stuff

876
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
There's possibility that licensed music is gonna be

877
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Part of the audio that's on that

878
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And so maybe to get around that

879
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
That's why you can't do MP3's anymore

880
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Because if you have the Sony music unlimited stuff

881
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
That stuff's licensed by Sony

882
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Perhaps they've licensed it for broadcast

883
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
And you know if it's in your video

884
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Or whatever that you've made

885
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
It's not such a big deal

886
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
It's a very interesting thought

887
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I should probably just throw out there

888
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
The point that there are many streams

889
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
On Twitch TV today

890
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Where the person's playing Warcraft

891
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Or League of Legends

892
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
And they're listening to iTunes in the background

893
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So you do hear licensed music go out through Twitch TV

894
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
All the time and it's kind of a gray area

895
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
And Twitch kind of says I think in their legal fact

896
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And I'm going off my memory so I apologize if I'm wrong

897
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Or misrepresenting

898
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
But I want to say it just kind of says

899
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
You know we don't really

900
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
We consider it kind of like fair use or whatever

901
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
As long as they don't complain about it

902
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Type of thing

903
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
They have no reason to go out and take it down

904
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Because it's just part of a broadcast

905
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
So it's kind of a gray area right now

906
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
But I think that's an interesting perspective

907
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Sony as a record label

908
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
As well as this

909
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Maybe has a vested interest in not having you

910
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Be able to stream your music

911
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
And it could be that they are just trying to sell more subscriptions

912
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
To Music Unlimited but let's be honest

913
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
If I have a PlayStation 4

914
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I don't think I need to really

915
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Necessarily do that

916
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Oh the other thing too is it's not going to support USB

917
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Hard drive support or memory sticks

918
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
At launch

919
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I don't understand the reason behind it

920
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Especially when it's something that's already in the PlayStation 3

921
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I don't know why

922
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
But whatever the case

923
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
This is just at launch

924
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Stuff can change

925
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
One other thing though

926
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
That's come out

927
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Is the Xbox One will support

928
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Playback of CDs

929
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
It will also support

930
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
DLNA streaming as well

931
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Although

932
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
There

933
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I guess

934
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
It's a little different

935
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
MP3 playback you can't do

936
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
They're saying to do that

937
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
The system I guess is set up as a Play 2 receiver

938
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
And that means you can

939
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Use your Windows 7

940
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Or Windows 8 PC

941
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Or Windows Phone

942
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I guess just stream to it

943
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Kind of like the Windows Media Center

944
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Buy our products

945
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Basically yeah it's kind of locked into that

946
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
So

947
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I don't know I mean that's kind of annoying

948
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
But

949
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Whatever the reasons

950
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
It is a little disappointing

951
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
That you can't

952
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Out of the box use it as a media server

953
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Or something like that because that's why I use my PlayStation 3 for a lot

954
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
But I guess their thoughts

955
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Would be oh well just use your

956
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
PlayStation 3 for that or buy a PlayStation 3

957
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
For that specific purpose

958
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
It's still annoying

959
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
And hopefully later on maybe a year

960
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
From now or hey whenever I decide to actually buy

961
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
A console because I'm definitely not getting one launch

962
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
That these features will be added

963
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Back in so

964
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I think it's just it's a matter of time

965
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Especially if people complain about it enough

966
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
They are listening so

967
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
It could change

968
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Some comments from our chat room live.vognetwork.com

969
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
PKJunior92 says I would think it would be

970
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Super easy to just not allow anything

971
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Playing locally to stream

972
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I would think too

973
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
They are rushing to

974
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
This stuff is kind of in rush mode right now

975
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Maybe that's kind of like okay let's not worry

976
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
About that right now let's just

977
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Do this and then we'll fix it later

978
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
My thought with that is

979
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
That they might also be managing it

980
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Some of the similar way that

981
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I've been using live stream lately

982
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
For a lot of my drawing stuff

983
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
And you actually can choose what channels

984
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
You have input into your stream

985
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
So I mean they probably have

986
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Like maybe a channel selector of some sort

987
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Brad from Pop Culture says

988
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
It's better to not have features to start out

989
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
And then add later

990
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Versus launch with features that get taken away

991
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Like other OS on Playstation 3

992
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
That is very much the truth

993
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Very much the truth

994
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Alright well let's move on with some other stories

995
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
This is

996
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I have no better way to put this

997
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
And this is the tweet that was heard

998
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Around the world this week

999
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
And it was actually a

1000
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Twit longer because it was too much for one tweet

1001
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
That happened and

1002
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
The person who wrote the tweet

1003
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Was Mark Rubin

1004
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Who I believe he's behind

1005
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
The studio that makes Call of Duty Ghost

1006
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
So that's Infinity Ward right?

1007
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
So he made this tweet and it says

1008
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Hey been on the road last couple weeks

1009
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
So I haven't had the chance to update

1010
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
But wanted to confirm that for Xbox One

1011
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
We're 1080p upscaled from 720p

1012
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And we're native 1080p

1013
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
On the Playstation 4

1014
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
We optimized each console to hit 60 frames

1015
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Per second and the game looks great on both

1016
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Still on the road but glad to see the great

1017
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Reception to extinction can't wait for next

1018
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Week's launch

1019
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
And yeah that went over

1020
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Huge because

1021
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
It was a huge opportunity for people to jump

1022
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
On and say oh Xbox One's

1023
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Inferior to Playstation 4 case in point

1024
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
It's not just that either it's also Battlefield 4

1025
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Battlefield 4 is

1026
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
900 because they do this weird

1027
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Shit where they always upscale stuff

1028
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
It's been a thing that they've had on

1029
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Halo 3 and Halo 4

1030
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
A lot of other games they upscale

1031
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
But like Battlefield 4

1032
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
720p on the Xbox One

1033
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
900p on the Playstation 4

1034
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
So

1035
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I mean based on those

1036
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Two games and speculating like

1037
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Crazy it sounds like the

1038
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Xbox One it's harder to get

1039
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
You know

1040
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
The graphics and stuff to be

1041
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Where they need to be in order to get

1042
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
The performance that you have on that system

1043
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
That's what it sounds like it's easier to do it on the

1044
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Playstation 4

1045
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Let me ask a couple devil's advocate questions that are important

1046
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
One 720p versus 900p

1047
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Is there really

1048
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
A difference

1049
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Can I really see the difference between the two

1050
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Is it that big of a deal

1051
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
You'll note

1052
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Well it was hard because they did

1053
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Some side by side comparisons

1054
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
But the problem is that the Xbox One version

1055
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Doesn't have a patch for some of the anti-aliasing

1056
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Stuff that they're going to have in there

1057
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
So

1058
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Right now it does look more

1059
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Jaggy on the Xbox One

1060
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Is that going to change when that patch comes out?

1061
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Probably

1062
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
So is it very hard to tell the difference between the two

1063
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Yeah for most people

1064
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
You're not going to notice a huge difference

1065
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
But you know the more detail

1066
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
That you have in there especially with these consoles

1067
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Pushing more detail

1068
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
You're going to notice it eventually

1069
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
And also the other thing is

1070
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
It's a next gen fucking game

1071
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
It should be running at 1080p

1072
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
In my opinion

1073
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I mean because what else

1074
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
If it's running at the same resolution as a regular

1075
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Xbox 360 game

1076
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
And some Xbox 360 games

1077
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Are probably running at higher resolutions

1078
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Why am I spending $500

1079
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
On this fucking system in the first place

1080
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
What am I getting out of it that's different

1081
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Than the Xbox 360 version

1082
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Look at our chat

1083
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
At live.vognetwork.com

1084
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Rama says also if you're gaming on a 32 inch TV

1085
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
You will not see the difference

1086
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Bonds006 says though

1087
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Yes there is a difference

1088
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Rama also speculates

1089
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I think that because of the usage of system memory

1090
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
PlayStation 4 is using GDDR5

1091
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
And Xbox One is using DDR3

1092
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
That could be it

1093
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
GDDR memory is for video cards

1094
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
The other devil's advocate point I wanted to bring up

1095
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Is weren't we in this exact reverse

1096
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Situation last generation

1097
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
And I specifically think

1098
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Of the game Oblivion

1099
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Cause I seem to remember

1100
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
When that came out for PlayStation 3

1101
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
People

1102
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
And it came out a year after it was out on 360

1103
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
And people were like it sucks

1104
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
And the slowness of the blu-ray drive

1105
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Holds it back and it's graphically not as good

1106
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
It's buggy

1107
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
But did that really ruin the PlayStation 3?

1108
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
No

1109
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
So

1110
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Well I will say this

1111
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
It didn't help the PlayStation 3

1112
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Get a great start out the gate

1113
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
That generation. PlayStation 3

1114
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Had some really kick ass exclusives

1115
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
To finally close the gap a little bit

1116
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
And come out looking okay at the end of the generation

1117
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
But here's the thing

1118
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Yeah they're gonna find tricks to

1119
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Make it better and stuff

1120
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
But out the gate though

1121
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
There is an advantage already

1122
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
It's not as even as it might be

1123
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
And I mean

1124
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
For some people that's not a big deal

1125
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
But when you're spending

1126
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
$500, $400 on a new system

1127
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
You're gonna be paying attention to

1128
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Every single

1129
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Especially when you're looking at games

1130
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Like if I'm looking to play Call of Duty

1131
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
That's a game that's not exclusive to one of those consoles

1132
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I'm gonna be looking at every damn thing

1133
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
And if it runs better on one system than another one

1134
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Like for example if I was buying a next gen system

1135
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
For Oblivion or Skyrim

1136
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I wouldn't be buying a PlayStation 3

1137
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Cause it ran like shit

1138
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
On the PlayStation 3 until about

1139
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
8 patches later

1140
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Then it finally ran okay for Skyrim

1141
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I'm not sure if they ever fixed Oblivion

1142
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
It took a long time

1143
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Well

1144
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I think

1145
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I do understand that point

1146
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Of wanting to have the capability to run

1147
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Higher

1148
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
But there also I mean you gotta think about the average person

1149
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Who's gonna be able to afford having the huge

1150
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
TV that will show it off

1151
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Like I mean

1152
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
For me

1153
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Yeah I would want all of that

1154
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
But if the average player isn't gonna have the TV

1155
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
To show it off

1156
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
It's still going to look great either way

1157
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
More comments from our chatroom at

1158
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
live.vognetwork.com

1159
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
DungeonBuster says Bethesda had little experience with the

1160
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
PlayStation 3 at the time too

1161
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
They've gotten better though the problems with Skyrim's

1162
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
DLC still point out issues they have with it

1163
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
And Extover says

1164
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I say it's too early to tell, let's wait until next year

1165
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
When next gen exclusives come out more often

1166
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
You know that is true

1167
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
These are launch games and every other generation

1168
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
We've seen that you put the launch games

1169
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Next to the games that come out

1170
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
At the end of the generation and you see

1171
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
The progress, you see how far

1172
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
You know developers learn to push the limitations

1173
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Of the system

1174
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
So yeah maybe

1175
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
The Xbox One lags a little behind

1176
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Here but they could catch up as developers

1177
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Learn how to work with them more right?

1178
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Let's be honest officially between the current gen

1179
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
And next gen games you're not gonna see a huge

1180
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Difference especially on these multi-platform games

1181
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I mean granted they're gonna have some better physics

1182
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
And stuff like ooh moving grass

1183
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Oooh you know

1184
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Leaves are rustling but you know

1185
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
For a lot of people it doesn't matter

1186
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
They're gonna, the majority of the copies

1187
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Of Call of Duty are gonna

1188
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Be sold on the Xbox 360

1189
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Like they are every other year

1190
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Last comment from our chat then we'll go to Dark Soccer

1191
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Story, BlackWolf says

1192
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Frames per second or FPS is more

1193
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Important than resolution anyway

1194
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
A constant 60 frames a second

1195
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Outways the number of pixels on the screen

1196
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Amen I agree with that

1197
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Immensely because like I'll play Final Fantasy

1198
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
14 and crappier graphics settings

1199
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Just to get it to run smooth

1200
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
That's more important than it being pretty

1201
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
So anyhow let's move on

1202
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
We could debate this all day long as people

1203
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Have been doing on the internet for a long time

1204
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
But we have a lot of show still to go

1205
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Who remembers the pocket station?

1206
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Me. Do you remember the pocket station?

1207
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I have one. I need to steal Julie's

1208
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I mean borrow Julie's. Isn't that how you

1209
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Like raised a chocobo in Final Fantasy 8 or something like that?

1210
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Hell yeah. Yeah and it also had a

1211
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Stat mode for um

1212
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
What was that game?

1213
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
She reads Justice Gakuen

1214
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Evolution, the rival school's

1215
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Second edition that came out on

1216
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Playstation. And it had, I don't remember if it was official

1217
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Or non-official but it had a wonderful

1218
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
DDR you know

1219
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Non-stop course editor for

1220
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
The fourth mix. Yes. Yes.

1221
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Well um

1222
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
There was a teaser that came out

1223
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
There's basically this

1224
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Four minute Playstation

1225
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Japan video

1226
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
That's out that teases

1227
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
The uh pocket station

1228
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Um so we could

1229
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Possibly see something

1230
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Similar to it coming out with PS4

1231
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I mean of course this is just a hint

1232
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
At it. Nothing you know

1233
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Etched in stone or engraved

1234
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
In metal I should say. But

1235
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Who knows? I mean

1236
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I used the hell out of my VMU on my

1237
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Dreamcast. I think I carried like three VMUs

1238
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
On my keychain at one time. Cause I had my

1239
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Chow, Dan's Chow and um

1240
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Godzilla. It could make a very

1241
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Interesting iPhone or Android app

1242
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I was gonna say it's gonna be an app. It's not

1243
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Gonna be a device. It just seems very

1244
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Obvious to be a great use

1245
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
For the app. I think it would be fun

1246
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Mhmm. Especially if they have the little cat

1247
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Cause I love the cat

1248
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
The little uh

1249
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Mascot that's like shown up

1250
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Ever since. It would be

1251
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Awesome because you know they can

1252
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
The Playstation 3

1253
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Can play the older games which I'm assuming

1254
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Is a matter of time before you see that on Playstation 4

1255
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
As well. That they you know bring out

1256
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
The library of old PS1 and 2 games

1257
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
That would be really awesome if you could get a

1258
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Pocket station emulator on your phone

1259
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I know that might be asking too much but I think it would be

1260
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Really cool. You know what would be nice is

1261
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Using if you get that emulator

1262
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
And um

1263
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
They start you know bringing out

1264
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Localized games that we never saw

1265
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Sort of like how Nintendo's doing with the

1266
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Wii U. True. True.

1267
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
That'd be fun. Alright.

1268
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Let's move on. Loki.

1269
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Alright. Um

1270
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
So Microsoft has put out a brand new

1271
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Privacy policy

1272
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
They were talking about

1273
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
How they collect data

1274
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
And this is mainly referring to

1275
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
The Kinect

1276
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
And talking about

1277
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
What features they record

1278
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Basically

1279
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
The Kinect camera

1280
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Actually records some information as far

1281
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
As like you know your facial recognition

1282
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
And stuff. But it saves that to your console

1283
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
So that's actually not shared

1284
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
They did say though that you could

1285
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I guess turn off

1286
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
You know of course the Kinect features at any time

1287
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
And the voice I guess

1288
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Commands are captured but I don't think those are

1289
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Shared. Skype though on the other hand

1290
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Well nothing's guaranteed to be

1291
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Private there. So

1292
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I guess they can get that

1293
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
If you want. Which is not surprising

1294
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Cause I think they're already sharing it at the end

1295
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
So anyways

1296
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
And then

1297
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
The thing that's kind of been the bane of my

1298
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Existence at least on the Xbox 360

1299
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Right now

1300
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
They want some updated

1301
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Contact information for your safety

1302
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
So like second

1303
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Ways to contact you via like

1304
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Email or

1305
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Texting you or phone calls and stuff like that

1306
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I've tried to put

1307
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
My information in there a few times now

1308
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
And it never fucking takes

1309
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
It just says

1310
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Oh I don't have it. So now I just back out

1311
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Of it every god damn time because

1312
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I've already put that stuff in there

1313
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
The website said it was confirmed

1314
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Yet it keeps nagging me for fucking information

1315
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Over and over. It'll send me the text. I'll confirm it

1316
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
It even sent me the text

1317
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
And I was gonna confirm it on

1318
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
The Xbox 360

1319
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
No sorry you have to visit this website to do that

1320
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Like then why the fuck are you nagging me through this

1321
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
But yeah

1322
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
So anyways now if you

1323
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
I guess you could link your service account with

1324
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
You know some other stuff

1325
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
And you have to have some sort of like

1326
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Name, address, email and all that stuff

1327
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
And that's just to

1328
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Protect the hacks and all that right

1329
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Yeah they claim

1330
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Yeah it can text you if somebody's trying to spend a lot of money or something like that right

1331
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I think it's more of like

1332
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Second way to authenticate yourself

1333
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
You know cause Google does that

1334
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Now Steam does it

1335
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
With emails

1336
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Makes sense I mean I appreciate

1337
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Them at least you know trying to

1338
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Protect things like especially after having money stolen

1339
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
In the Xbox 360 very easily

1340
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I appreciate that they're taking the extra step

1341
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Even if it's a little sloppy

1342
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
From Loki's perspective

1343
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
And also you know just as a reminder

1344
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
You know you probably

1345
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Want to make sure that you go to

1346
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Xbox.com and go to your account

1347
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Settings to make sure that

1348
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
You opt out of all of the

1349
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Sharing of that information with

1350
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Microsoft parties and company affiliates

1351
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Resellers, distributors, etc, etc, etc

1352
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Cause I'm sure that they

1353
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Conveniently left that on

1354
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Of course, of course

1355
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Alright

1356
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Moving on to some highly controversial

1357
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
News this week and

1358
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
This one just really blew me away

1359
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
And

1360
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Oh boy this is

1361
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
We just had a comment earlier in the show

1362
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
About somebody said

1363
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
It's better to add a feature after the console

1364
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Comes out than to take something away

1365
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I believe that was Brad

1366
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
We are seeing

1367
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
This week something getting taken away

1368
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
And it's Nintendo who

1369
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Disabled the swap note application

1370
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
On their

1371
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
3DS and it's due to

1372
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
The exchange of quote

1373
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Explicit material

1374
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Now it should be pointed out

1375
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
I may have overdone

1376
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
It there cause they didn't disable the entire app

1377
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
But they disabled the spot pass feature

1378
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Which for most people was the

1379
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
App that means sending the notes through the internet

1380
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
So you can no longer send pictures

1381
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Of your cats through the internet

1382
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Because some kids

1383
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Were exchanging explicit material

1384
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
And I guess they just found this out

1385
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
What two years after the app launched

1386
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Some users were exchanging

1387
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Offensive material

1388
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
The feature was deactivated to quote

1389
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Limit the risk of any inappropriate

1390
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Activity or misuse of

1391
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
A service

1392
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Further quotes from Nintendo's notice quote

1393
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Nintendo has learned that some consumers

1394
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Including miners

1395
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Have been exchanging their friend codes

1396
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
On internet bulletin boards and then using

1397
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Swap note known as Nintendo letter box

1398
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
In other regions to exchange offensive

1399
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Material

1400
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Nintendo has been investigating ways of preventing this

1401
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
And determined it is best to stop the

1402
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Spot pass feature of swap note

1403
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Because it allows the direct exchange of photos

1404
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
And was actively misused

1405
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Nintendo always wants to provide a positive

1406
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Experience for all consumers

1407
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
And limit the risk of any inappropriate activity

1408
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Or misuse of a service

1409
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
We feel it is important on this occasion

1410
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
To take this action

1411
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
We are very sorry for any inconvenience

1412
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
To the many consumers who have been using this service

1413
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Nintendo will continue to work to ensure

1414
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
More consumers are aware of our parental control

1415
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Features which allow parents to manage

1416
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Their children's experience on our systems

1417
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Okay

1418
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Nintendo just now learned this

1419
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Two afters after the fact

1420
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
That if you give teenagers

1421
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Access to the internet

1422
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
They are going to take pictures of their penis

1423
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
And send it to their friends

1424
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
It took you two years to figure that out

1425
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
This is why

1426
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Everybody drags Nintendo

1427
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Over the fact that they don't understand

1428
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Online

1429
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
This news story certainly doesn't do them any favors

1430
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I am

1431
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I am just shocked

1432
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
At the

1433
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Like

1434
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I don't even know what word to use

1435
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
A degree of naivety

1436
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Naive

1437
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
God dammit

1438
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I keep wanting to say naivety

1439
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Because it's Christmas

1440
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Naivety

1441
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
It is not remotely Christmas it's Hanukkah first

1442
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
I mean Thanksgiving

1443
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
But I'm just

1444
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Blown away by

1445
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Honestly

1446
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Honest to god it took you two years to get to that point

1447
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
And now you're taken away

1448
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Because kids look up porn online

1449
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
And yet

1450
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
You leave the internet browser

1451
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Which you've made, I'm sure you've made

1452
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Terrible on purpose

1453
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
The first thing I did when I saw this news story

1454
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Is I went to my DS browser

1455
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I pulled up gay porn

1456
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
And I took a picture of it and put it on Twitter saying

1457
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Well Nintendo didn't really remove the porn from my DS

1458
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Now did they?

1459
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
But they removed the child porn

1460
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Well what is it

1461
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
That I told Bobby

1462
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
When he tasked

1463
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
The shows over to us

1464
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
There are two things you can have

1465
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
On a device the moment it comes out

1466
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
And that's porn in Linux

1467
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
It's true

1468
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I just

1469
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I was talking

1470
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I was at a fun little party last night

1471
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Which is why I'm a little hungover today

1472
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I was at a fun little party last night with Captain Spike

1473
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
From Game Buoy and Slidekick was there

1474
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
We love those guys

1475
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Matt or Grandpa from Hoardhouse was there

1476
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
So some podcasting friends and some other people

1477
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Were all at this party

1478
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Spike and I were talking about this a lot

1479
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Spike's a big Nintendo fan and I understand why

1480
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Nintendo does make some great games

1481
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
As I said earlier

1482
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
The game I'm most looking forward to this holiday season

1483
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Is a Nintendo game

1484
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
A Nintendo game in many ways to find last generation

1485
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
He was throwing out a theory

1486
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
That maybe this has to do with the 2DS

1487
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
The fact that the 2DS is marketed

1488
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
A bit more towards children

1489
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Because Nintendo is more actively

1490
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Pursuing the kid market

1491
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
And they have to pay a little more attention to

1492
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
What kids can actually do with the device

1493
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
And although I totally understand that point

1494
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
And respect it

1495
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
There's a part of me that goes

1496
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Well god damn it

1497
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
When are we going to put some onus on the parents

1498
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Because a kid doesn't walk into Toys R Us

1499
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
And plop down $130 on a 2DS

1500
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Somebody drove them there if they do

1501
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
There is a lot of irresponsibility on the part of parents I think

1502
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
So put the 2DS in a giant envelope

1503
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
That says parental warning

1504
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
In big red letters

1505
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
To disable internet

1506
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
On this device

1507
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
But you know the thing

1508
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
And this goes a little bit into marketing too

1509
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Is that when you have a system

1510
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
With a warning label on it

1511
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
You have a chance

1512
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
That a parent is going to

1513
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Just see the warning

1514
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
And go oh well I don't want to do this

1515
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Risk it's easier not to deal with it

1516
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Than have to work for it

1517
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
I've got too much else on my plate with my kid

1518
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Or how can I watch everything all the time

1519
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
It's better just to not get it

1520
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
I see it that way too

1521
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
And here's the other interesting thing

1522
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Swapnote for all practical purposes

1523
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I think is one of the more innocent applications

1524
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I love to use it for cat pics

1525
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
And writing little notes

1526
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I get excited about

1527
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Seeing the stuff that comes through

1528
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Meanwhile they've shut this down

1529
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
But guess what still works on my Wii U

1530
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Video chat

1531
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
So right at this moment

1532
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I could go on and I could call

1533
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Whoever's on their Wii U right now

1534
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
And I could say hey look at this

1535
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
And pull down my pants and show them my balls

1536
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I mean is Nintendo

1537
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Going to shut down the video chat too

1538
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Because heaven forbid

1539
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
A child unsupervised

1540
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Uses the device because the parents were too lazy

1541
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
To enable parental controls

1542
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
And starts showing their goods

1543
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
To predators

1544
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Which again

1545
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I'm not

1546
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Don't misunderstand me

1547
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
That's the terrible thing

1548
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
And people who prey on kids like that

1549
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Should have horrible horrible things done to them

1550
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
But I think there has to be responsibility

1551
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
On the parents part

1552
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
That if you put a device like this in the home

1553
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
You need to watch what your kids are doing

1554
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I would like to respond to hitstun by the way

1555
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
And what does hitstun say in our chatroom

1556
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
At live.vognetwork.com

1557
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
They just patch out photos

1558
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Well I mean it's not stopping people from

1559
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Drawing things either

1560
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
And photos were the best part

1561
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
So how are you supposed to share your photos now?

1562
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
I like photos of pussy

1563
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
What's the point of having a 3D camera on the thing

1564
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
If you can't share it with anyone

1565
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Because you can

1566
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Take them off on your SD card

1567
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
And email them

1568
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Swapnote came after the launch anyway

1569
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
So you can technically still view them on your card

1570
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
And I guess hypothetically

1571
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Yeah you could email them or something

1572
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
But it really did

1573
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
And I saw the word used in chat here

1574
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
PKJunior92

1575
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Nintendo neutered the service

1576
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
It really neutered the photography

1577
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
And even Nintendo's own

1578
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
You can take the screenshots

1579
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
In Animal Crossing

1580
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
And they touted that as a big feature

1581
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
And how you could like

1582
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I'll be honest

1583
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I've done one screencap through Swapnote

1584
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
And all the rest of them I pulled off my SD card

1585
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
And put on my Tumblr

1586
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
I need the ones that are on my

1587
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Fan page on Facebook

1588
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
I took those

1589
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
On my game

1590
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
And just copied them over

1591
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Because they come across as I believe as JPEGs

1592
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
If you don't use the 3D mode

1593
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Alright so

1594
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
There you go

1595
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
I'm just very disappointed in this news

1596
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
It's like every time you think

1597
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Nintendo gets it

1598
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
They don't

1599
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Oh by the way

1600
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
There's an app called WeKaraokeU

1601
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
And I don't believe that's here in the US

1602
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I think that's something that's only available in Japan

1603
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Because you know

1604
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Karaoke is a little bigger overseas

1605
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
WeSing or something

1606
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I don't think that has any karaoke in it

1607
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Yeah but there's this WeKaraokeU app

1608
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
And by the way this app contains mature language

1609
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Songs in it

1610
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
There was some tweet that was going around that was really funny

1611
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Where it shows the little me in it singing

1612
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
We fucking in the bed

1613
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
We fucking on the floor

1614
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I don't know what song that is but it's just really funny

1615
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Sure that's not a Lily Allen song

1616
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
You know Reddit's blowing up with all this

1617
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
So it's just

1618
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
And people are just making a point out of this

1619
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
It's like Nintendo

1620
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
You still can do many adult things

1621
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
If you want to with your console

1622
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
It's JoySound is the

1623
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Karaoke thing

1624
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
And if I remember correctly I do believe a JoySound game has come out over here

1625
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
For the Wii

1626
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I don't believe it's on the Wii U yet

1627
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I think I remember that

1628
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
But it's just

1629
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
It's a little ridiculous

1630
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
And unfortunately just you know

1631
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Extenuates the reason why Nintendo

1632
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Constantly gets ridiculed

1633
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
For not understanding online

1634
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
And this doesn't make me feel a little more comfortable about their situation

1635
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Sorry to say

1636
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Alright

1637
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Let's move on

1638
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
With more news, DarkSakura

1639
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
You know I feel a little bit like

1640
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I don't want to take from

1641
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Bobby's interview earlier

1642
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Think of it as giving him a cheap plug

1643
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Yeah so I'm actually gonna say

1644
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Hey everyone if you want more of the information

1645
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
On this make sure that you go listen to Bobby's show

1646
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Which you can download on iTunes and blah blah blah

1647
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
And blognetwork.com

1648
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
So but I am gonna go ahead

1649
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
And tell you what happened

1650
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
And there's a

1651
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
A company called Wadjet Eye

1652
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
And that's

1653
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
W-A-D-J-E-T and I love

1654
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Companies with mythological names

1655
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Just cool

1656
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
So anyway

1657
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
There was a game put out called

1658
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
And it was put out for free

1659
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
There were codes that you could download to play the game

1660
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Well people were taking those free codes

1661
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
And setting them up to resell them

1662
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Which I think is shitty

1663
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
So

1664
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Basically they just took them all down

1665
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
And said well no

1666
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
We don't want that to happen but

1667
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
It wasn't necessarily the codes that went down

1668
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
It was the page that went down

1669
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
So well the link to the page that went down

1670
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
So basically people were still going to that

1671
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
And getting all the codes

1672
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
So there's about

1673
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
30,000 codes worth of games now that have been

1674
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Removed from Steam

1675
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
And I believe it was 30,000?

1676
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Didn't he say? Yeah he said this during the interview too

1677
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
That you know he just did those last

1678
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
30,000 from like the time he went to bed

1679
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Cause he was up for 30 hours because of the situation

1680
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
On his anniversary that's shitty

1681
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
But um

1682
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
But anyway um

1683
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
It

1684
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
It just

1685
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I'm not gonna say it baffles me that people will

1686
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Use the generosity of others

1687
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Because it happens I'm sorry

1688
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
If you've got people

1689
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Who think they can make a profit off of

1690
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Other people they're going to do it

1691
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Humble Bundle all the time this happens with Humble Bundle

1692
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Which is why that changed

1693
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Yeah we talked about it on the show that people are eBay-ing

1694
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Their codes on the Humble Bundle

1695
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
To people that don't know any better

1696
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
It's really tacky

1697
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
It's

1698
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I wouldn't just say tacky

1699
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
It's I would put it up

1700
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
In the realm of purely unethical

1701
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
We just have

1702
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
This faction of greedy people

1703
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Which I'm not going to go into detail on that one

1704
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Um

1705
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
But I think that it was

1706
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
What

1707
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
What Dave Gilbert did

1708
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
That was who Bobby interviewed before

1709
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
I think that was purely necessary

1710
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I think it was the right step to take under the situation

1711
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
And yeah there's people pissed off about it

1712
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
But

1713
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Look at it as

1714
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
The rotten apple spoiling the bunch

1715
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
You have a lot of bad apples

1716
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Spoiling all of it

1717
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
For everybody

1718
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
So if you want to be mad at anybody

1719
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Be mad at the people that were abusing the system

1720
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Not at the person who was the victim of the abuse

1721
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Yeah I and

1722
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
One interesting thing we learned from all this too is that

1723
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Steam can pull games from the library I thought that was interesting

1724
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
We haven't really heard of a case of that happening before

1725
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
But he does talk in his interview with Bobby about

1726
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
You know the ethics

1727
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Behind doing that and that you know

1728
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
You don't want to abuse something like that or Steam's never

1729
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Going to let you sell games or want to work with you again

1730
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
So I thought that was very interesting

1731
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
And there was another point with people

1732
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Being angry because they couldn't get their game

1733
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
On Steam

1734
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
But that doesn't stop you

1735
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
From linking your game with your Steam account

1736
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
You can still run everything through Steam if you want

1737
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Your functionality of Steam with your game

1738
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000

Screen caps of Final Fantasy 14

1740
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Right

1741
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Alright well let's travel around the world

1742
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
And check out some release dates

1743
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
That you can buy

1744
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
And then you can resell if you want

1745
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Because it's a little more ethical

1746
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
When you actually bought it in the first place

1747
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
But anyway let's travel around the world and check out release dates

1748
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
And what's coming out soon

1749
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000

I'm totally gonna not play it for a week

1766
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
So it's gonna take some getting used to

1767
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
That now we have to throw in Playstation 4 releases into the mix

1768
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000

And the game stick

1788
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
I sure know what I'm getting Rob

1789
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
No no no hold off

1790
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
You gotta wait for Hello Kitty Cruisers

1791
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Or whatever that was

1792
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000

That'll be fun

1795
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
20 bucks

1796
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Rob I think you're worth at least 20 bucks

1797
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Alright I'm covered for Hanukkah

1798
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Alright

1799
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Alright let's move on

1800
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Going to Japan I would read Playstation 4 dates

1801
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
But remember they're not getting theirs until next year

1802
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
So we still have a little while before we start

1803
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Getting those dates in Japan

1804
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
But we can read what's going on on the Playstation 3

1805
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
And coming out on November 7

1806
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
We have Akiba's Trip 2

1807
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Battlefield 4

1808
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Book of Spells

1809
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000

1810
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
And Oni Chambara Z Kagura

1811
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
With No No No

1812
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Comes out

1813
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Oh Rocksmith 2014 X4 will be happy to hear

1814
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
That Rocksmith 2014 get exposed to Japan

1815
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
As well

1816
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
It's going to be big in Japan

1817
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Is it big in Japan? I don't know how well

1818
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Music games are still doing in Japan

1819
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Was Rockband and those other games really

1820
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Selling in Japan?

1821
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Rockband I don't remember

1822
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I think they did get a release

1823
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Well regardless

1824
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
If you happen to have a friend

1825
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
In Japan who wants to learn how to play the guitar

1826
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Rocksmith 2014 is out this week on November 7

1827
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Oh my god you know what I'm suddenly

1828
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Thinking of in my mind

1829
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Rockband Visual K Edition

1830
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Where it's all like

1831
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Malismizer and

1832
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
I don't think they localize the music

1833
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Or anything when they put it out there

1834
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
I just think it would be fun

1835
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Alright so there are some price reductions

1836
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
As well in games like Tekken Tag Tournament 2

1837
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
But I want to get to the

1838
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Xbox 360 and some of the games coming out there

1839
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000

01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000

And Rocksmith 2014 out in Japan

1842
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
This week as well on the Xbox 360

1843
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Going to the Playstation Vita

1844
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Battle

1845
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Destiny gets a price reduction

1846
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
It's already out, but there is a new game called

1847
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
X-Tetra

1848
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Comes out this week on the Playstation Vita

1849
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Going to the Wii U this week

1850
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Nothing

1851
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
But you do get Call of Duty Ghost

1852
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Next week since we'll be here next week

1853
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
And Super Mario 3D World

1854
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
In a couple weeks, I guess I'll be touching on that

1855
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Again when we come back

1856
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000

And there is a Monster Hunter 4 Hunter Pack

1861
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Limited Console Bundle out this week

1862
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
As well

1863
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
There's also another Tamagotchi game

On the 3DS this week

1866
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
And that does it for Japanese releases

1867
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Dark Sakura, how about the UK?

1868
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
There's a few things in the UK

1869
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
On the 6th we have Call of Duty Ghost

1870
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
For practically everything

1871
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000

2014 Olympic Winter Games

1876
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
The end

1877
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
The end

1878
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Bobby Blackwolf bringing some clarity in chat

1879
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Blackwolf says

1880
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Rock Band Japan was a thing that failed in development

1881
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
They talked about it at their PAX East panel

1882
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Licensing was a mess and they wound up

1883
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Giving up on it

1884
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
I thought they got some version of Rock Band in Japan

1885
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
But maybe it's just

1886
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Maybe they got our version subtitled

1887
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Yeah licensing was probably a mess

1888
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Maybe the import store

1889
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
That I see Japanese releases on

1890
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Maybe they were kind of going the other way

1891
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
And helping Japan get the English version if they so wanted

1892
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Because Japan imports stuff from us sometimes

1893
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Alright

1894
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Before we get to the classic game of the week

1895
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Just a few more stories for you guys

1896
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Loki

1897
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Here we thought we were

1898
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
All done with the online pass

1899
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Because EA gave up on it

1900
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
That was that

1901
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
And

1902
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
THQ went out of business

1903
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
There's two companies

1904
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
But nope

1905
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Ubisoft decided hey you know what

1906
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
We're going to put a brand new online pass

1907
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
I'm sorry

1908
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Uplay Passport

1909
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
That's going to be part of

1910
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag

1911
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
And then that not only will

1912
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Grant you access to the online

1913
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Portions of the game

1914
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
But it also locks away

1915
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
The game's fleet management system

1916
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
That was part of the single player campaign

1917
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Now

1918
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
That's not such a big deal if you're buying the game new

1919
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
But of course if you're going to buy it second hand

1920
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
It's going to cost you ten bucks

1921
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
It's still kind of like really

1922
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
You put that in there really

1923
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
I mean come on

1924
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
And people got pissed off about it

1925
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Well

1926
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Ubisoft decided hey you know what

1927
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
We're going to get rid of it

1928
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
And we're going to actually start now with Assassin's Creed IV

1929
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
So they went ahead and

1930
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
They're going to

1931
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Now have that code

1932
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
You still have to get the code for

1933
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
The Uplay Passport

1934
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
But it'll be a free download

1935
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
You just go to the PlayStation Network

1936
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Or the

1937
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Xbox Live Marketplace and you just

1938
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Download it and basically

1939
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
It allows you to do that for free

1940
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
And they're not going to have it in any future games

1941
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
It says the Uplay Passport was initiated

1942
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
As a means of giving the customer full access

1943
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
And support for online multiplayer

1944
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
And features along with

1945
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Exclusive content bonuses and rewards

1946
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
However

1947
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Games today are blurring the lines between

1948
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Offline and online

1949
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
And single player and wiz multiplayer

1950
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Come on man it was a single player campaign

1951
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
There's no blurring anything there

1952
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
And based on that

1953
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
And feedback received

1954
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
We recognize that the Passport is no longer

1955
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
The best approach

1956
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Maybe just because people are calling you out and you're fucking money

1957
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Grubbing you know tactics

1958
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Is what it is you know

1959
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Yeah it's not the approach so now we're just going to have to

1960
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Microtransaction everything to be continued

1961
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Is basically the way I see it

1962
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
So um

1963
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Good on them I guess

1964
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Now we only have to get on Warner Games

1965
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
And Deep Silver

1966
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I mean seriously

1967
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
What the fuck with Saints Row 4

1968
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
You know I thought

1969
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
We were done with that when THQ went out of business

1970
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
And if it's not

1971
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Deep Silver I'm going to blame Volition

1972
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Those motherfuckers you know with

1973
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
You know here I thought it was THQ

1974
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Forcing them to you know

1975
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Hoard the DLC for that game

1976
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Nope it was them

1977
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Alright well um

1978
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Before we get to the classic game of the week

1979
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
This is this is I don't

1980
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Words escape me and I think a lot of us

1981
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Again here's another story

1982
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
This week where a lot of us kind of looked at this

1983
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
And went like how can this happen

1984
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
This is awful

1985
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
During this weekend a lot of folks

1986
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Out there were participating in a charity fundraiser

1987
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Known as Extra Life which is a

1988
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Video game fundraiser

1989
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
It's gamers doing good which is the stuff we like to report

1990
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
On it's raising money for the Children's Miracle

1991
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Network Hospital

1992
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Well during the fundraiser

1993
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
The website for Extra Life came under

1994
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
A DDOS attack which is

1995
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Denial of Service

1996
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Directed Denial of Service Attack

1997
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Basically meaning a bunch of people

1998
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Hitting it all at once to try and take it down

1999
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
But they they and you know

2000
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
I think the first thought that comes with this is

2001
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Well was it just too popular and all these people were trying to hit it

2002
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
No they came out and said

2003
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
We believe we were under DDOS attack

2004
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
And somebody took down the charity website

2005
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
For a couple of hours

2006
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
And luckily they were able to get it back up

2007
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Only to have it taken down again

2008
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
At 4.45 pm

2009
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
I believe that was yesterday

2010
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
It did come back up at 5.48

2011
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
So after about an hour

2012
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
But if you think about it

2013
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
By the way Black Wolf says the first E is distributed

2014
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Whatever

2015
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Anyway

2016
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Whatever it stands for

2017
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
It's a pretty shitty thing to do to a charity organization

2018
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Especially when it's gamers trying to do good

2019
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
And you know all these people

2020
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Were trying to donate

2021
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
And they couldn't through the site

2022
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Because everybody that's doing the stream is trying to point people to the site

2023
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
And you know they couldn't

2024
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Make the donations

2025
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
So you know obviously there was a lot of pissed off people

2026
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Online about like how could somebody

2027
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Be so shitty to take down

2028
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
A charity

2029
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
And I have a couple schools of thought on this

2030
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Is that one there's shitty people

2031
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Out there period

2032
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
And you know just like we had an unfortunate

2033
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Horrible incident in the real world

2034
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Where a guy went and shot a guy at an airport

2035
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
And shut down LAX for a few hours

2036
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Like how could somebody be that shitty

2037
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
You know there are shitty people out there

2038
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
And we have to do whatever we can to

2039
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
You know stop these people

2040
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Whether that's through getting help

2041
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Or through you know whatever

2042
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
I'm just curious

2043
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
What there is to gain

2044
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
From taking this down

2045
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Because I can't think there would be an internet organization out there

2046
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
That would be like heck yeah

2047
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
That would be rude over all these sick kids

2048
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Like who would want to take pride in that

2049
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
I'm not sure

2050
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
There are people who enjoy being assholes

2051
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Yes and I

2052
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
I think it could be

2053
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
And I don't want to sound like too tinfoil hatty

2054
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
But it could honestly be a cyber

2055
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Terrorist organization

2056
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Or it could be someone who has a vested interest

2057
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
In making gamers look bad

2058
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
That sounds like a script kitty to me

2059
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
You think it was just one crazy person

2060
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I think it's some juvenile kid

2061
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
That's like hehehe

2062
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
My other thought was that maybe they were trying to

2063
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Intercept the credit cards somehow

2064
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Maybe but I don't know how you

2065
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
But I would think

2066
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
You know again

2067
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I think this whole situation is shitty

2068
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
And I feel shitty for even going here

2069
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
But is it possible that somebody

2070
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Was after the credit card transactions

2071
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
And somebody wanted to get all

2072
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
All these instant credit card numbers

2073
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
And things coming in in a very short

2074
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Amount of time people wanted access to that

2075
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
You wouldn't DDoS a site to do that though

2076
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
That would be like installing

2077
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
A trojan or something

2078
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Or somehow getting access to their database

2079
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Or something

2080
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
DDoSing something is not going to really do anything

2081
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
As far as I'm aware

2082
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
ActDeft quoting a movie

2083
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Saying there's people that just want to

2084
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
See the world burn

2085
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
And BlackWolf says

2086
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Sky the lulz

2087
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
I don't think anyone's laughing

2088
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
No

2089
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
You know it's one thing when

2090
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
You know maybe they take down

2091
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
CNN.com or

2092
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Hack an LA Times article to say

2093
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Butts butts butts butts or whatever

2094
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
They do

2095
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
That's one thing

2096
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
But you know charity organization

2097
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Raising money for sick kids

2098
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
I don't think anybody's going to laugh at that

2099
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
That's just a special kind of dickery

2100
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Yeah

2101
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
The whole butts thing is an awesome dickery

2102
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Just macro every single

2103
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Key on your keyboard to type butts

2104
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
When you type it

2105
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
BlackWolf says I think the people who did it

2106
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Were laughing

2107
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
I think it's important to make sure

2108
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
If they're laughing

2109
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
What sick individuals

2110
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Would be laughing at this particular situation

2111
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
I think it's important that if

2112
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
For whatever reason we know these people

2113
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
We hang out with these people

2114
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
We talk to these people

2115
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
That we let them know they're sick

2116
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
If you

2117
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Endorse this or you laugh at it

2118
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Too then that's just

2119
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Encouraging it to happen and I think you need

2120
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
To kind of put your foot down and be like this is not

2121
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Okay

2122
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
I think it was an attention grab

2123
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I mean seriously the reason why people

2124
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Do asshole things like that is because they know

2125
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
It's going to rile someone up it's the worst kind

2126
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Of troll

2127
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
It's why I don't give

2128
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
PETA any attention anymore

2129
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
It's why I hate

2130
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Bringing

2131
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Yeah it's a big thing and definitely needs to be spoken out against

2132
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
But I also don't want to give these people the time of day

2133
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
You know I'd like to think that

2134
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
All of us and the people who listen to our show

2135
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Wouldn't hang around that kind of person

2136
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Right

2137
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
That's why I'm not sitting here going

2138
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
If you're the person that did this you're an asshole

2139
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Because I'm like no that person's not listening to this program

2140
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
But I would like to think

2141
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
That our listeners are decent people who have good taste

2142
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Absolutely

2143
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
And definitely a

2144
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Higher level of ethics

2145
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Than these people do

2146
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
But you know

2147
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
It is a small world I learn that every day

2148
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
And even though you might

2149
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Not know somebody directly who is involved with this

2150
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
You might know someone that knows someone

2151
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
So you know

2152
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Be that change

2153
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
And let people know it's not funny

2154
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
And it's not okay

2155
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Alright

2156
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Let's move on let's move on to happier things

2157
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Such as gaming history and

2158
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
You know the things that brought us to where we are today

2159
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Every week here on the show

2160
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Dark Soccer likes to take a step into

2161
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
The classic gaming vault

2162
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
And find a game that she thinks hey

2163
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
You kids out there you should be playing

2164
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
This video game

2165
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Stop learning how to put butts on the

2166
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
L.A. Times and play this

2167
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Classic game

2168
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Dark Soccer what is the classic game of the week?

2169
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
The classic game of the week is Shin Megami Tensei

2170
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
You'll make a lot of friends

2171
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
With that choice

2172
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
I'm pretty sure plus I have to say

2173
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
That as I have not spoken to

2174
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
My dear friend who is such a fan of this game

2175
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
CatastrophicMagi

2176
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
On

2177
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Steam for a while

2178
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
I dedicate this one to you because you were the one who

2179
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Introduced me to the series

2180
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
As in depth as I know it now

2181
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Shin Megami Tensei

2182
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Means true goddess reincarnation

2183
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
And I am referring to the first one

2184
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
That came out on October 30th

2185
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
1992 for the Super Famicom

2186
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
And it is based off of Megami Tensei

2187
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Which is a novel

2188
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Infamicom game

2189
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
This one is the

2190
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
First of the series

2191
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
At least in the Shin Megami Tensei series

2192
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
To be put out by Atlus

2193
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
This one in particular

2194
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Starts off

2195
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
It's a first person RPG

2196
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
So

2197
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
In fact it actually is a lot like

2198
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
What was the series? Wizardry

2199
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
So you go through different dungeons

2200
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
And you have up to six characters

2201
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
And it's turn based

2202
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
A field of vision

2203
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
So basically you walk up to the corner

2204
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
You turn the corner

2205
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
You have two types of characters

2206
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
You have humans and demons

2207
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
And you have to collect demons like pokemons

2208
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
So your human

2209
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Will acquire the demon

2210
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
By either negotiating, bribing, or coercion

2211
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
During a battle

2212
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
You have them

2213
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
You can store them in your computer

2214
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
And summon them for money

2215
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
To use in battle

2216
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
And they feed off of a secondary currency

2217
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Called magnetite

2218
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
So

2219
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
If your demon is defeated

2220
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
In battle then they have to be revived

2221
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
So like I said it's got that Pokemon element to it

2222
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
It has

2223
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
A

2224
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
A method of controlling

2225
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Multiple demons

2226
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
By calling them Akumagata

2227
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Which is demon fusion

2228
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
So you can

2229
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Basically use

2230
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
You can combine your demons to be

2231
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Like this powerful gestalt

2232
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
You also have firearms

2233
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
You have special ammo that goes with it

2234
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Melee weapons, you have armor

2235
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
You have only certain things

2236
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
That can be wielded by certain alignments

2237
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
And as far as your demons go

2238
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Each of them have their own different statistics

2239
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Like I said it's kind of Pokemon like

2240
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
They all have permanent

2241
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Abilities in this game

2242
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
That changes with the later two

2243
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
And they can't

2244
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Be changed at all

2245
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
So with this

2246
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Your demons are

2247
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Are basically

2248
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Your tools for fighting

2249
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
In the game along with your regular armaments

2250
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
You have

2251
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Different types

2252
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
You have

2253
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Pixies

2254
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
You have angels

2255
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
You have all kinds of

2256
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
You have ghouls, you have all kinds of different ones

2257
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
So the alignment of your demons

2258
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Are two different types

2259
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
You have light neutral dark

2260
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
And light neutral chaos

2261
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Or law neutral chaos

2262
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
So basically it's kind of a D&D style

2263
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Alignment system

2264
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
So you can have true neutral

2265
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
You can have chaotic dark

2266
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Which I guess would be chaotic evil

2267
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Law is associated with God order and peace

2268
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Chaos is with you know

2269
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
The devil and freedom and war

2270
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
And then balance

2271
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Is the neutral one too

2272
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
So your human characters also have

2273
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Alignment as well

2274
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Now I'm not gonna go

2275
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Too much into the stories basically it's demons

2276
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
On earth and they're changing the balance of power

2277
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
And you have to stop them

2278
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
So you have your characters

2279
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
You have your hero that you name

2280
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Yourself

2281
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
In sort of the game

2282
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
In Apocrypha there has been

2283
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
A name given of Kazuya

2284
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
In the Steven

2285
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Report 1

2286
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
There is a heroine

2287
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Which in that same thing she was given

2288
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
The name Yuka

2289
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
You have a law hero, a chaos hero

2290
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
You have a girl named Yuriko

2291
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
You have Steven which is a disabled computer programmer

2292
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Who writes the demon summoning program

2293
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
You have a character named Goto

2294
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Ozawa

2295
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
You have just a bunch of characters in this game

2296
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
I'm not gonna go into it but those are like the major characters

2297
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
It also was imported later on

2298
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
For the PC Engine Super CD ROM

2299
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000

2300
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000

2301
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
And Game Boy Advance

2302
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
To build hype

2303
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
For Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne

2304
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Famitsu gave it a 30 out of 40

2305
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
The original

2306
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
That was the Playstation 1 by the way

2307
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
The original version got a 36 out of 40

2308
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
From Famitsu

2309
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
There's also a manga spin-off

2310
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000

2311
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000

And of course we have

2313
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000

Can enjoy it but I do know for a fact

2317
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
There's a translated ROM

2318
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000

2319
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Find it

2320
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
And play it through whatever means you deem

2321
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Necessary

2322
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000

2323
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Yeah sorry about all the beeping I was trying to find some better music

2324
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Because the first three YouTube

2325
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Videos I found were all like the same music

2326
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
And it's happy

2327
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Well that's what the game sounded like

2328
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000

Talking a lot about kind of like this

2350
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Generation of gaming earlier on in the show

2351
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Because we're not gonna be here next week

2352
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
So when we are back in two weeks

2353
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
The Playstation 4 will be out

2354
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
And then the week after that the Xbox One will be out

2355
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
So we will be living in the next

2356
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Gaming generation and it'll be

2357
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Interesting to see what the reception

2358
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Is of those systems when they launch

2359
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
I'm surprised you didn't play my generation

01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Oh maybe at the end

2361
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000

2362
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000

Stitcher now does the reviews and the

01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000

2386
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
App as well that's

2387
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000

In our chat room says speaking of award

2393
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Shows tonight Bobby Blackwolf says you were

2394
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Up against the YouTube music awards

2395
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
But apparently those were a big old

2396
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Bag of dicks

2397
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
I

2398
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Yeah I heard it was going to be very experimental

2399
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
And I'm sure

2400
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
It went wrong but we'll see alright

2401
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Let's go back and do some gaming news

2402
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Rapid fire news here Loki

2403
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Did that one Chinese food

2404
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Song win or whatever it was

2405
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
One can only hope

2406
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
I mean that's what I think

2407
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Of when I think of YouTube

2408
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Best lyric of our generation

2409
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Chow ma ma ma main

2410
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Ah yes anyways

2411
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
So let's talk a little bit about

2412
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
South Park

2413
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
South Park

2414
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Seriously what's going on with you

2415
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Delayed

2416
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
To March

2417
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Unfortunately

2418
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
And I was so hoping

2419
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
That it would come out in December

2420
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Because there was nothing coming out in December but

2421
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Yeah

2422
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
And uh

2423
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Just because it's not done yet

2424
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Really and they showed some gameplay and I

2425
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Thought it would be pretty cool

2426
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Yeah I'm very much looking forward to this game

2427
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
I'm a little disappointed about the delay but

2428
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
You know get it right take the time you need to get it right

2429
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Don't rush it it's fine

2430
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
If it comes out finally we'll all forget about the delay

2431
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
So it definitely happens

2432
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Right Grand Theft Auto fans?

2433
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Speaking of Grand Theft Auto 5

2434
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
29 million fans

2435
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Have already forgiven it

2436
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
And it's already um

2437
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Well they shipped that many to retail

2438
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
But they pretty much sold

2439
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
And that means if

2440
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
And that's within 6 weeks

2441
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
So couple more weeks

2442
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
It will have outsold

2443
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Grand Theft Auto 4's

2444
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Time sales so that's

2445
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Not bad for 6 weeks

2446
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
And last but not least

2447
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Something I'm kind of excited about

2448
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
The 7th guest 3

2449
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Is going to be a

2450
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Possible game that will be coming out

2451
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Full motion video and all

2452
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
The 7th guest if you're not aware is a

2453
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Pretty old PC game

2454
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
It was a puzzle game

2455
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
And the 11th hour

2456
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
The second game in the series

2457
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
They're trying to kick start a third

2458
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
For $435,000

2459
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Oh my god is there a reward

2460
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Tier level where I can be in the game

2461
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
In one of those cheesy full motion videos

2462
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Because it's kind of awesome if so

2463
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
If I had money I would so

2464
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Want to do that

2465
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
I don't know let me check

2466
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
They're at $39,000 right now

2467
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
And they have 35 days to go

2468
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
And

2469
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
It would like literally be my dream

2470
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
To be one of those corny full motion video actors

2471
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
In one of these games

2472
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
$1,000 get your name on an object

2473
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
In the mansion

2474
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
$5,000

2475
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Your name and likeness in a painting

2476
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Or photograph in the mansion

2477
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
You could be in the game Rob

2478
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
$75,000

2479
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
$75,000

2480
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Scary animated portrait

2481
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Of you in the mansion and producer

2482
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
In game credit

2483
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
And no there is not a way to be

2484
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
An actual

2485
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
An actual

2486
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Can I campaign to be

2487
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
One of the cheesy full motion

2488
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Video actors in the game

2489
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
You would have to like probably contact

2490
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
The

2491
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Creator and just give them lots

2492
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Of money and say hey

2493
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Can I forgo all those things

2494
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
That be like actually in the game as like

2495
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
A character

2496
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Nice

2497
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Alright yeah so if

2498
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Anybody behind that game and that Kickstarter is listening

2499
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
We'd love to get you on for an interview

2500
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Wink wink or maybe I can hassle you about being

2501
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
In the game wink wink alright

2502
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
I'll do it dressed as Frank

2503
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
No alright

2504
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Moving on I'm being a little bit

2505
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Reductive here talking about something I already

2506
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Talked about earlier in the show but I will

2507
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Mention The Typing of the Dead Overkill

2508
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Was a surprise that was brought

2509
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Out this week Sega didn't

2510
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Really mention that they were working on it there was a

2511
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Few teasers here and there but it did come out as

2512
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
A surprise so Typing of the Dead Overkill

2513
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Was released it was available

2514
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
For $10 but you might have missed the sale

2515
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
That was only through November 1st so now

2516
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
It's going to cost you $20 but you know what

2517
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Doesn't Steam always have a

2518
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Christmas sale or excuse me a winter

2519
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Holiday sale or whatever at the end of the year

2520
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Yeah so you know if you really

2521
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
It is almost December ween

2522
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Yeah if you really have to get it cheap you have that to look forward

2523
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
To so but honestly

2524
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
It's still worth even $20 if you want to play it

2525
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Right now good times and

2526
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Yeah there it is Typing of the Dead Overkill

2527
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
It is out and I'll give

2528
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
A cheap plug for my YouTube channel one more time

2529
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Rob Robert just plays and you can watch me actually play

2530
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
The first hour or so of the game

2531
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Um it has been announced that the

2532
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Male Wii Fit Trainer will also

2533
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Be a playable character in

2534
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Smash Brothers for Wii U and the

2535
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
3DS just like you have

2536
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
I don't know you kind of have like Zelda and

2537
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
And Sheik are kind of the same

2538
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
But not really you know

2539
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
That's what they're kind of doing with the trainers

2540
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Model swap yeah the male Wii Fit

2541
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Trainer is the exact same character as the female

2542
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
One it's just like a it's a costume

2543
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Swap of sorts I am so

2544
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Looking forward to beating people up with the power of yoga

2545
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Right but now you can do

2546
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
That I think it would actually be cooler if they

2547
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Just left the male trainer out

2548
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
I know they're just trying to pad the roster but

2549
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Whatever yeah I don't know

2550
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
It's just kind of one of those oh neat

2551
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
You know yeah but it's not like

2552
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Oh well now I have to pre-order this

2553
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Knowing that I can play a male Wii Fit Trainer

2554
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Just changes everything not really

2555
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
It's just kind of one of those like oh neat

2556
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Type of things and it would be kind of neat for those

2557
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
2 vs 2 matches to like you know

2558
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
You could play Wii Fit Trainer vs Wii Fit Trainer

2559
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
But you guys actually look different

2560
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
And it's not just a pallet swap that's

2561
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Kind of neat for what it is

2562
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
But yeah little news piece there

2563
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
And lastly a follow up to an

2564
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Interview we had a couple weeks ago you might remember that

2565
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
We had the guy behind

2566
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Retro Magazine that Kickstarter was here

2567
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
On the show and he's with Game Gavel as well

2568
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
So Cal Mike was what he went by

2569
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
And he was trying to raise the money there for Retro Magazine

2570
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
And was having a little bit of a hard time

2571
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Getting coverage because

2572
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Apparently a lot of commercial websites

2573
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Won't run the story

2574
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Because it's competitive

2575
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
And I guess I didn't really realize

2576
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
This but it should be obvious that

2577
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
In these commercial for profit

2578
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Blogs and things they literally have anti

2579
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Competitive clauses they will not run a piece

2580
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
That could promote something that competes against it

2581
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
That's one of the great things about the indie

2582
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
World because we are the exact opposite

2583
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
You know when an indie podcast asks

2584
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Me to plug them I'm like heck yeah sure

2585
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Let's help each other out right

2586
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
In fact we grow more

2587
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
From helping each other out than trying to like

2588
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
I have no tolerance for people that try to take each other down

2589
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
I have no tolerance for that

2590
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
The only clause we believe in is the Santa clause

2591
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
I do worship Santa this is true

2592
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
But anyway

2593
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
We got off on a little tangent but my point I was really trying

2594
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
To make is that thanks to the

2595
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Indie scene and all the people that were helping get the

2596
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Word out about this they met their goal

2597
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Yay and I think

2598
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
If I'm not mistaken they might have hit

2599
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
One of their stretch goals even they really

2600
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Shot up in the last few days

2601
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Now hire me

2602
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
They ended up with $75,000

2603
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
All together and I believe

2604
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
That was going to cover a couple of the

2605
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Stretch goals

2606
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Dang look at all these people here

2607
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
I'm trying to find it

2608
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
$62,000 was met meaning everyone

2609
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Gets a collectible sticker with the first print

2610
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Issue and there will be an increased page

2611
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Count yay

2612
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
For me

2613
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Alright anyhow

2614
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
So congrats to Retro Magazine I look forward to

2615
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Having my first issue I did back it

2616
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
I kicked back like $35 or so just enough

2617
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
To get the year subscription of the magazine

2618
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
I look forward to having that on my

2619
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Strewn on my kitchen table

2620
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Where we table LR very soon

2621
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Along with Kid Icarus Rising and

2622
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
What's that pink thing?

2623
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
This man bag? No

2624
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
I know what the man bag is

2625
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
This is a little game called Pink Hijinx

2626
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
It was in my GamerX loot bag

2627
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
That I just haven't played yet

2628
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
It's like this game involving little pink pyramids

2629
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
I thought it was a pink Tootsie roll

2630
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
No I would have eaten it

2631
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Chocolate

2632
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Less chocolate more news

2633
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Well we do have some news

2634
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
There was a hack

2635
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Into the Pokemans

2636
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
And there are two

2637
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Mega Evolutions were

2638
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Released

2639
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
We have

2640
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Let's see what they are

2641
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
It was released by Smeelum

2642
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Who created the first

2643
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Homebrew Portal game for the DS

2644
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Said that there is a Mega Evolution for

2645
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Latios and Latias

2646
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Um

2647
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
They are

2648
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Ugly

2649
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Ugly mon

2650
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
I don't know what they're called

2651
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
But they're kind of ugly

2652
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
So yeah you can look online and find them

2653
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Also there is an ESR

2654
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
B rating saying that Gradius 5

2655
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Might be going to PS3

2656
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Which I freaking love me some Gradius 5

2657
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
But that game is some hard shit

2658
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
But that would be awesome

2659
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
There is a T for Teen

2660
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Rating on it

2661
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
So uh who knows

2662
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
I would like to see it there

2663
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Maybe with some goodies like maybe doing Gradius 2

2664
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
As a throw in you know

2665
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Because Gradius 2 is the best

2666
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
And then Steam has hit a milestone

2667
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
65 million active

2668
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Users

2669
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
That's a lot of people Rob

2670
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
That's a country

2671
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
A small country

2672
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Not a medium sized country I'd say

2673
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Way to go Steam

2674
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Good job

2675
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Congrats

2676
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
The winner is you

2677
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Didn't they say that's bigger than Xbox Live now

2678
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Yeah

2679
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Alright let's get to the FUGL question of the week

2680
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Ladies and gentlemen

2681
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
You take Facebook

2682
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
You take Google Plus

2683
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
You slam those words together

2684
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
You get FUGL

2685
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Which by the way I'm happy to announce

2686
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
You can reach our Facebook page

2687
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
At Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio

2688
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
But you can now reach our Google Plus page

2689
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
At Google.com

2690
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio

2691
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
They finally have those short URLs

2692
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
And we were able to get one for OrangeLoungeRadio

2693
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
It's weird though because you do slash plus

2694
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
But if you've seen the Google URLs

2695
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Go to Google.com slash plus

2696
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
OrangeLoungeRadio

2697
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
No more disgusting sequence of numbers at the end there

2698
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
So you can be our friend on Google Plus

2699
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
And do those things that Google users do

2700
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
And when I figure out what that is

2701
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
I'll let you know

2702
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Alright let's

2703
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
You answer FUGL questions of the week

2704
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
That's what you do and this week's FUGL question of the week

2705
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Is probably similar to something we asked before

2706
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Admittedly when these systems were first announced

2707
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
But

2708
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
With us not having a show on 1110

2709
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
The next time we have a live show the Playstation 4

2710
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Will be out so

2711
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
This is the last unofficial poll to see what systems

2712
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Our listeners are getting this holiday season

2713
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Are you or do you plan to buy

2714
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Before the end of the year

2715
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
A Playstation 4

2716
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
An Xbox One

2717
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
A Wii U

2718
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
A 3DS or a Vita

2719
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Or something else or none of the above

2720
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
And why

2721
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Did you ultimately decide the way you did

2722
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
I will try to read everybody's

2723
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Answers but some of the longer ones

2724
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
I'm going to cut really short

2725
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Just for time's sake because we did get a lot of answers

2726
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Tonight and I don't want to go on forever so I hope you'll

2727
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Understand and read all the answers in their

2728
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Entirety at Facebook or Google Plus

2729
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Redertainment says due to

2730
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Project Buy a House

2731
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
None of the above

2732
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Soutoure says none of the above

2733
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Because the Playstation 3

2734
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Gran Turismo excuse me

2735
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Gran Turismo 6 is enough for me for now

2736
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Sam H says none of the above

2737
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
I have too many current gen games

2738
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
To go buy and play

2739
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
E3VL says

2740
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Already pre-ordered the Playstation 4

2741
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Since it's the cheaper console

2742
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
May purchase the Xbox One

2743
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
After it has a price drop to play the

2744
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Exclusives

2745
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Act Def says I plan on getting a Wii U

2746
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
And upgrading my PC

2747
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Why do I want a Wii U?

2748
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
I think there's enough games I would actually play

2749
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Like Super Mario 3D World and Rayman Legends being the main ones

2750
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
And Cyber Judge says

2751
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
I planned on purchasing a Playstation 4

2752
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
But with recent good and bad news I received

2753
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
I'm no longer purchasing an

2754
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Next gen console in the foreseeable future

2755
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
I do have a Vita I'll end up getting a

2756
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Playstation 4 when I am again able

2757
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
So that was about half nothing

2758
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Half mixture of Playstation 4 and Wii U

2759
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Xbox One a little later

2760
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
We got a lot of people on Facebook

2761
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Let me try to get through these

2762
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Andy R says buying a Playstation 4 at launch

2763
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Mostly because it's new and shiny

2764
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
And I'm a consumer whore

2765
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
That's my reason too

2766
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
KJ says I preordered a Playstation 4

2767
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
The timing of the release of the console

2768
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Is my main reason

2769
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
I paid off the Playstation 4 little by little

2770
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Not in one lump sum

2771
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Xbox One will have to wait for a price drop

2772
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Renji2214 says

2773
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
I'm thinking of getting a Wii U

2774
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
For the holidays this year

2775
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
I haven't seen anything that interests me on Playstation 4

2776
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Xbox One and with Super Mario 3D World

2777
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
And Mario Kart 9 and the new Smash Brothers

2778
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Next year I think the Wii U has a little more

2779
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
That I'd be interested in

2780
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Our old pal 23rd Magus

2781
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Or what is it, Drunami

2782
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Drunami replied and said

2783
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
I know better than to buy a system

2784
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
At launch, even the DS took a year

2785
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Before it had more than tech demos

2786
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
X2fer, our pal from Hoardhouse

2787
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Said we're getting a Playstation 4

2788
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Already have a Wii U, no Xbox

2789
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
One yet, no plans to get a 3DS or Vita

2790
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
LOLU

2791
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
He just threw that in there to

2792
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Kick them

2793
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Matt says other

2794
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Every year around or on Cyber Monday

2795
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
I spend money that I've saved towards upgrades

2796
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
To my PC

2797
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
I figure if I spend a little money every year

2798
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
I can keep my PC at near optimal settings

2799
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
This year I'm gonna get a new graphics card

2800
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
A second monitor, whatever's left over will go towards

2801
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
A device to help me stream games

2802
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Our friend Sil from Girls Gone Wow

2803
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
I love Sil

2804
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
I love you Sil

2805
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
And I love your hair, it looks so cute

2806
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
She's amazing

2807
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Girls Gone Wow is on our network

2808
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Wednesdays at 9am Pacific

2809
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Noon Eastern

2810
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
They're really early because in the UK it's 5

2811
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
I want Sil to kidnap me

2812
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Not the other way around, I want her to kidnap me

2813
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Fair enough

2814
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Anyhow, Sil says I really want a Playstation 4

2815
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
But can't afford one now

2816
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
I'll wait until much later when they have newer versions

2817
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
And I can get it second hand

2818
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Or perhaps I should just livestream with more cleavage on display

2819
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
So I can get money

2820
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
But it's important to note she put a little angry face

2821
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
What do you call that line underscore line face

2822
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Like the grrr face

2823
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Unfortunately she had some ignoramus on Twitter

2824
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Say something about her livestreams

2825
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
And it's like

2826
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
People

2827
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Grow up

2828
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Giovedea from Anime Jam Session says

2829
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Which you can hear Tuesdays here at VOG

2830
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Says 3DS with a few games

2831
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Not interested in the Wii U

2832
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
And I'll probably pick up the Playstation 4

2833
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
After a price drop so I can play Kingdom Hearts

2834
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Xbox One hasn't impressed me so far

2835
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Degenerate Johnny says

2836
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
3DS because of Pokémon XY

2837
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
And I don't want to be pressured into getting the next gen

2838
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
I still have a pile of current gen games

2839
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
I haven't even touched yet

2840
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
When I finish this shrink wrap pile and I'm feeling comfortable moving forward

2841
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
I'll consider a next gen console

2842
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Until then, I'd rather bask in the here and now

2843
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
AZHP says

2844
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
None of the above

2845
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
My backlog of games is so huge that I honestly don't need a new system

2846
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
And none of the games are really drawing me

2847
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
My friend is lending me her 3DS

2848
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
So I can play Ace Attorney

2849
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
But other than that, there's nothing I want to play badly enough

2850
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
To buy a system at this time

2851
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Burr says

2852
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
I'm getting both the Playstation 4 and Xbox One

2853
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Because I have the money to get in on this console launch party madness

2854
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
I know it's not the most objectively smart thing to do

2855
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
But I'm going to enjoy some enthusiasm

2856
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
For the next generation for now

2857
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Well, you know, I think

2858
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
That's a good way of looking at it

2859
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
I know this is a lot to be spending

2860
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
But I'm going to have fun with this

2861
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
JVMonset also says

2862
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
I'm getting both

2863
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Though the Playstation 4 had zero interesting games at launch

2864
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
I believe it has potential in 2014

2865
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
CriticalMyths says

2866
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
I cancelled my Playstation 4 pre-order

2867
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
And I'll be holding off on any new consoles until 2014

2868
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
I'm too backlogged on games

2869
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
For my Playstation 3, Vita, and 360

2870
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
As it is

2871
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Doug T says

2872
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
I'm buying the Playstation 4

2873
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
My preference is Sony

2874
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
I have massive Playstation 2, 3, and Vita game libraries

2875
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
I'm still buying the Xbox One next year

2876
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
But decided to pass

2877
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Due to Microsoft's initial stance

2878
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
And then over a few weeks

2879
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Constantly changing what they were doing with the system

2880
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
I don't trust their position with Xbox One

2881
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
They could change their stance again

2882
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
GamerGirl says

2883
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
I'm not bothering to buy one until further down the road

2884
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
I enjoy my Playstation 3 too much

2885
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
And the first batches always have glitches

2886
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
So I'm going to wait

2887
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
I don't even have a Wii U

2888
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
DDRDollarBill says

2889
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
That's a good rule

2890
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Hitstun says

2891
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Screw all that, I want a Retron 5

2892
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
I've got plenty of old games

2893
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
I still have to finish

2894
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
And the Retron 5 makes them look nice over HDMI

2895
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
That's a very creative answer

2896
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Reginator says

2897
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
I'm a ways off before I buy a next gen system

2898
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
I want to replace my Playstation 3 first

2899
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
If I were to buy one

2900
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
I'd lean towards a Playstation 4

2901
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Fifth Dream says

2902
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
I have my Playstation 4 pre-ordered with release day delivery

2903
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
If I were to arrive

2904
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
I've just always liked Playstation

2905
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
I never got a Playstation 3 because I was required to have a 360

2906
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
For a tech support job

2907
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
And never saw the reason to get both

2908
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Blood Drunk says

2909
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
None of the above

2910
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Going for a good old fashioned video card upgrade

2911
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
PC is where it's at

2912
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
And James S says

2913
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
I have my Playstation 4 paid off

2914
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
And I'm ready to go

2915
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
As well as the special edition Zelda 3DS

2916
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
And I'm going to ask for a Vita for Christmas

2917
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
The reason is because

2918
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
I'm simply just one giant man child

2919
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Well said

2920
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Considering I'm in a very similar position

2921
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Although I've got to admit

2922
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
I'm starting to waffle a little bit on the Playstation 4

2923
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
I might cancel it

2924
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Because a combination of things

2925
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
I think it's the three game rule

2926
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
That one of our listeners said

2927
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
In their response

2928
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
And just the fact that

2929
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
I would really be interested in upgrading my PC

2930
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
A little more

2931
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
And that you start to weigh what's more important

2932
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
A Playstation 4

2933
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Or being able to do more stuff on your PC

2934
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
And if I look at where I really spend most of my time

2935
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Gaming, it's on the PC

2936
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Dan and I have had a similar discussion

2937
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Because I'm really working on trying to up

2938
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
My own design stuff

2939
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
And I need a computer that's going to handle it better

2940
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Plus I play on the PC

2941
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
More than anything anyway

2942
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Just don't be surprised if you guys come back in two weeks

2943
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
On the show and hear that I cancelled my pre-order

2944
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Because it's something I'm strongly leaning towards right now

2945
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
It's likely going to happen

2946
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Keep in mind, buying a game at launch

2947
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Is not usually a good idea

2948
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Or a system I should say

2949
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
So that's interesting

2950
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
None of us are

2951
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Assuming I cancel my Playstation 4

2952
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Which is the likely case at this point

2953
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
I said on this show right up until the day it came out

2954
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
I'm not getting a Wii U

2955
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
And then of course what happened about a Wii U?

2956
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
None of us will own a next gen system except my Wii U

2957
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Does this mean we have-

2958
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
That doesn't count

2959
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Wii U is not a next gen system

2960
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
I'm sorry

2961
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
It could be like a separate parallel

2962
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Dimension system

2963
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
But it's not a next

2964
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Generation system

2965
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Regardless of where you place it or how you feel about it

2966
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
This is a ride shoe compared to a Pikachu

2967
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Does this mean we have to stop doing a video game podcast

2968
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Because we're not gaming enough

2969
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
To be on the cutting edge of the new generation

2970
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
No

2971
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
No I also

2972
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Obviously I agree with you

2973
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
I have a PC I can run games

2974
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
I have a PC

2975
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
At least a third to half of those answers

2976
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Where people saying nope not right now

2977
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Or getting systems that are like 3DS's

2978
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
And Vita's and things that are already out there

2979
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Well and Dan and I already said we're gonna wait until

2980
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
There's more stuff out for it that we want

2981
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
We're sitting on a $100 gift card

2982
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
That we're gonna put to our-

2983
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
We've decided it's going to our PS4

2984
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
We're just not getting it yet

2985
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Besides I wanna make sure there's no shapes or lights of death

2986
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
On anything that I'm planning on purchasing

2987
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Probably if I get a PlayStation 4 this year

2988
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
It's gonna be because I got it for free

2989
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
I'm not actually gonna buy one

2990
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
I'll wanna get one before February of next year

2991
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
When Final Fantasy XIV starts on PlayStation 4

2992
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
But um

2993
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
You know I don't- by then I'll have a tax refund

2994
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
I can spend on it too

2995
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
So it's something I have to put in perspective

2996
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
So keep in mind guys

2997
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
I know we've been doing this podcast a long time

2998
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
And some of you have stuck by us a very long time

2999
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
And I really really appreciate that but the reality is

3000
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
We don't make our lives off this show

3001
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Once in a great while we are extremely lucky

3002
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:38,000
To get a review copy of a game from an independent studio

3003
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Or something but the reality is

3004
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,000
It's not like they're shipping us free consoles and things like that

3005
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
So just like you have to think about

3006
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Do I have the money to spend on this console

3007
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
We have to ask ourselves the same question

3008
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,000
And sometimes the answer is

3009
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
No I'd rather spend the money on a ticket to Atlanta

3010
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
So I can go to Dragon Con next year

3011
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,000
You know type of thing

3012
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Or whatever it is

3013
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Alright

3014
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Anyhow moving on

3015
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
We'll do some more news and then we'll get to

3016
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Our phone calls pretty soon here

3017
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
At 1877 Game OLR

3018
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
You can yell at me for changing my mind if you want

3019
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Although I'm not, again

3020
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,000
You're allowed to waffle

3021
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Again

3022
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Waffles are delicious

3023
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Waffles are fucking good

3024
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
And I said here on the show

3025
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,000
I'm not getting a Wii U

3026
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,000
I'm not getting a Wii U

3027
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
What happened that Sunday when you all came to the studio

3028
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,000
I'm playing my Wii U

3029
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,000
So you never know

3030
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Because you're a consumer whore

3031
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,000
And how

3032
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Back to news, Loki

3033
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
Alright so Minecraft has

3034
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Done something quite interesting

3035
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
There's an update I guess is going to be coming

3036
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
And it was announced at Minecon

3037
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Apparently if you have the PC or Mac version of it

3038
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
You will be able to

3039
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Soon

3040
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Stream to Twitch straight from the game

3041
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
And you'll be able to link your

3042
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:47,000
You know

3043
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Twitch TV account

3044
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
To the actual game

3045
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
And it'll allow you to stream I guess natively

3046
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Which I think is kind of interesting

3047
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
And of course you know

3048
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
I guess you'll be able to do it on

3049
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
You know the Xbox One as well

3050
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Because I think they're going to have

3051
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Twitch integration

3052
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
But that's kind of something separate

3053
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Speaking of the Xbox

3054
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
There is some new

3055
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,000
DLC coming in

3056
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Yet another

3057
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Reskin of the game

3058
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Much like the Mass Effect

3059
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Minecraft mod that they had

3060
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Now they have the Elder Scrolls Skyrim

3061
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Texture set

3062
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
It comes with 40 character skins

3063
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Themed menus

3064
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:26,000
User interface

3065
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,000
And craftable items

3066
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Also 20 songs from Skyrim as well

3067
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:30,000
And

3068
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,000
The best part about it

3069
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Is it comes with a pre-made map

3070
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
That

3071
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
I guess recreates areas of

3072
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Bleak Falls Barrow

3073
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Whiterun and Riverwood

3074
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
So that's pretty sweet

3075
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
That is pretty neat

3076
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:48,000
I need to check out some of these themed

3077
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
DLCs they have going on on Xbox

3078
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Because I know they have the Mass Effect one

3079
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,000
I never checked that out

3080
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
But the Skyrim one sounds cute too

3081
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Yeah so

3082
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
I think that's pretty sweet

3083
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
At some point I need to go back to Minecraft

3084
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
But I'm just too busy with Grand Theft Auto

3085
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Alright

3086
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Moving on to information about Wii Sports Club

3087
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Remember Wii Sports Club?

3088
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
This is the thing they're doing on Wii U

3089
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
That's kind of the reinvention of

3090
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
What many were saying were

3091
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
The game of last generation, Wii Sports

3092
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:21,000
And I had no idea about this

3093
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
But there was an article

3094
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,000
That they run called

3095
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Owada Asks

3096
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
That was talking about the release of Wii Sports Club

3097
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
And he said quote

3098
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
I'm sorry actually this is not

3099
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Owada that said this

3100
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
But this is developers behind the game

3101
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
Kozo Makino and

3102
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Takayuki Shimamura

3103
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Said about Namco Bandai

3104
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Being involved in the development of this

3105
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
I had no idea they were involved

3106
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:44,000
But Makino says

3107
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
We asked Namco Bandai Studios

3108
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,000
To develop it

3109
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
So I first participated as a coordinator

3110
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
But in the end I got into just about anything

3111
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
I mainly worked on the network aspect of the game

3112
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
But at times I made suggestions

3113
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
On how some features should turn out to be

3114
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:58,000
And Shimamura says

3115
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:59,000
From the middle of development

3116
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Makino-san and Suzuki-san

3117
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Were also working as full fledged planners

3118
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
We did ask Namco Bandai Studios

3119
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:06,000
To develop the game this time

3120
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,000
But staff and Nintendo's

3121
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Network development and operations department

3122
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
The software planning and development department

3123
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:12,000
That those two are in

3124
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
And EAD also chipped in

3125
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
So that's kind of neat

3126
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
That Namco Bandai is involved

3127
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Confirmed Pac-Man a playable character

3128
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
No I'm just kidding that's not confirmed

3129
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,000
But you know

3130
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
I'm a little disappointed that Nintendo chipped in

3131
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
On the network portion of it

3132
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:28,000
Right

3133
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
That's not exactly where they're the strongest I think

3134
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Yeah a little

3135
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Especially after this week's news

3136
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,000
I'm a little worried about that

3137
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:36,000
But if it really works

3138
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
I think the idea of a Wii Sports

3139
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
That's online is really cool

3140
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,000
It's a bummer

3141
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
You know they can't use that camera

3142
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
To be able to like show my friend

3143
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Playing Wii Sports

3144
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Although I'm sure there'd be people out there

3145
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
That'd be like look I'm gonna swing around naked

3146
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,000
I'm doing a helicopter

3147
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Rob don't worry

3148
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,000
This is plan B

3149
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,000
You do understand

3150
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,000
This is plan B

3151
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Because remember this holiday

3152
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
They do have a brand new Wii U skew

3153
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:01,000
That has the new Super Mario Brothers U

3154
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
And you know

3155
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,000
New Luigi U as well

3156
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
If that fucking fails

3157
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
And can't sell the game system

3158
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,000
You better believe

3159
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
They are going to include this

3160
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
With the next skew that comes out there

3161
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,000
To try to drive sales

3162
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Oh I'm sure

3163
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
And they just dropped the price

3164
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Nintendo land pretty heavy too right

3165
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Did they drop that down to 29 bucks this week

3166
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,000
I think happened too

3167
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Or it's coming up very soon

3168
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Not surprised the game's coming in

3169
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Yeah well if it's not the packing game anymore too

3170
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,000
You know it's gotta

3171
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Getting its price dropped

3172
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Would really help it sell

3173
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
One other interesting note

3174
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:36,000
You may not want to read too much into this

3175
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:40,000
But there's a Wii U exclusive trailer

3176
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,000
That Nintendo has

3177
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:44,000
It's for the 2013 and 2014 lineup

3178
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
That shows Wii U exclusives

3179
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Bayonetta 2 was in the trailer at one time

3180
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
It's not there now

3181
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Some people are reading into this that

3182
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Uh oh

3183
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
It slipped to 2015

3184
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:57,000
I don't

3185
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,000
I don't know

3186
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
I think people might be reading a bit too much

3187
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Especially the people that are saying

3188
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Oh well this means it's no longer exclusive

3189
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
No

3190
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:06,000
They've said many times

3191
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,000
This game would not be happening

3192
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,000
If it wasn't for Nintendo

3193
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
And it's going to be exclusive

3194
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,000
So um

3195
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Yeah

3196
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
But uh

3197
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:17,000
It could just be that there's nothing new to show

3198
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
You know they want to keep the game a secret

3199
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,000
I don't know but it wouldn't

3200
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,000
It honestly wouldn't surprise me whatsoever

3201
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:24,000
If it's going to be pushed back all the way to 2015

3202
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,000
Wouldn't surprise me

3203
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
I hope they have a strong enough 2014 lineup

3204
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
To keep selling Wii U's

3205
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:32,000
I'm sure they've got something under their hat

3206
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Maybe the Zelda game will be this year

3207
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,000
They'll probably be this year

3208
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Yeah maybe the Zelda game will come out sooner than we think

3209
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
I'm still thinking holiday next year

3210
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,000
I don't think it's going to be any sooner than that

3211
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:44,000
I'm pretty sure it's all hands on deck for Zelda Wii U

3212
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,000
But we'll see

3213
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Anyway

3214
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Let's move on

3215
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Dark Sakura

3216
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Well in other news

3217
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
We do have

3218
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
As soon as it actually works for me

3219
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:56,000
There we go

3220
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:00,000
There is a new Neo Geo game coming out

3221
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:04,000
We have Neo XYX for Neo Geo MVS

3222
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
And yeah for the longest time

3223
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:09,000
The last one out was Samurai Shadow 5

3224
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
So we're starting to see new ones

3225
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
It was actually done by NG Dev Team

3226
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:16,000
And it is a shooter

3227
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:19,000
That's their third scrolling shooter

3228
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
That's going to be out on the MVS

3229
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
And their fourth overall MVS release

3230
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:27,000
So I watched a little bit of this earlier

3231
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:30,000
And it looks pretty neat I have to say

3232
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Fun shooting game

3233
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:35,000
But it's nothing SNK of course

3234
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
It's always fun to hear about

3235
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
New games coming out for old consoles

3236
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
There's still love out there for it

3237
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
I love when people do Dreamcast games

3238
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Yeah right

3239
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
I want some of them still

3240
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Act Def in our chat room

3241
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Reminds me of a very obvious Nintendo game

3242
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
I should have remembered for 2014

3243
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Smash Brothers

3244
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
I'm sure that's a given for next year too

3245
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:57,000
I think that'll finally be done

3246
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,000
That'll be good

3247
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:59,000
And Mario Kart 8

3248
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Yeah there is Mario Kart 8

3249
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Wasn't there a rumor that it is

3250
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
I think the date was out there

3251
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
April 25th I want to say

3252
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Now granted that was a UK date if I'm not mistaken

3253
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:11,000
But isn't that later than it was originally said

3254
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
And remember I said when Donkey Kong got delayed

3255
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
It could have been a sign that Mario Kart was delayed too

3256
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,000
I think they have a

3257
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
They're probably going to try to

3258
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Make sure they have a release every month

3259
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
So they got Donkey Kong in February

3260
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:25,000
There's still no real date for

3261
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,000
I mean

3262
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,000
They have Wii Fit U

3263
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:28,000
They have the meter out for that

3264
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:31,000
But they don't actually have a physical bundle for it yet

3265
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:32,000
That's been announced

3266
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Unless that's December

3267
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Because there's really nothing in December

3268
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Gran Turismo

3269
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,000
It's your month

3270
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Oh yeah don't forget Wii U owners

3271
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
If you have a balance board Wii Fit U is out

3272
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:42,000
Yeah

3273
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
I should check that out at some point

3274
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:45,000
And if you have a balance board

3275
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
You already pretty much have Wii Fit U

3276
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
I mean it's only a little bit different

3277
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
You have to buy a meter though

3278
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
So make sure you get your fit meter thing

3279
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
I'm trying to think what else there was

3280
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Smash Brothers and Mario Kart

3281
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
I mean those are supposed to be some point

3282
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,000
And then

3283
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Nintendo has a tendency though to kind of surprise us

3284
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,000
With little things

3285
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:06,000
You know and they're doing their own thing now

3286
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,000
With these Nintendo Directs

3287
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
They're not adhering to any schedule

3288
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,000
For release of news

3289
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
I mean granted they'll save some of their biggest stuff

3290
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,000
For E3 week

3291
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
But I wouldn't be surprised if they don't do a press conference

3292
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Again next year

3293
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,000
And do what they did this year

3294
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:18,000
So anyway

3295
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Let's move on with some other news

3296
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Alright

3297
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Logie

3298
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Final Fantasy XIV

3299
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Doing pretty well now that they

3300
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Rebooted

3301
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Has it gone up a level?

3302
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Yes

3303
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Yes I'd say

3304
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
1.5 million registered accounts

3305
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,000
That's not bad

3306
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:36,000
I'd say that's worth

3307
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,000
You know

3308
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:38,000
The reboot

3309
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Dark Soccer is doing the Final Fantasy 1 victory animation

3310
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:41,000
With the hands

3311
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:42,000
Up and down

3312
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Do do do do do

3313
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:44,000
You know what just went into my head

3314
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Was the Brentalfloss thing

3315
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:46,000
You just got pwned

3316
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,000
FTW

3317
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,000
So yeah

3318
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,000
That's cool

3319
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:53,000
And definitely I think it'll be neat

3320
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:54,000
When the PlayStation

3321
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,000
They say the PlayStation 4

3322
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Beta version is playing

3323
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
I guess the same day as the Japanese PlayStation 4

3324
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:00,000
So

3325
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,000
February

3326
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:02,000
Yep

3327
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Cool

3328
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Very cool

3329
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Yeah

3330
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:06,000
We just heard not that long ago

3331
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,000
There was a million Final Fantasy XIV

3332
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
So it's going up in subscribers

3333
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,000
That's gonna

3334
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:12,000
You know

3335
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,000
That's gonna make this year's BlizzCon

3336
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Very interesting

3337
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Because you know

3338
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:16,000
There's a little

3339
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:17,000
You know

3340
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:18,000
This MMO

3341
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Final Fantasy XIV

3342
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:20,000
Has still got some steam behind it

3343
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Now granted

3344
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:22,000
You had Star Wars

3345
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:23,000
And you had

3346
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Rift

3347
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:25,000
And you know

3348
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:26,000
Some of these other ones too

3349
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:27,000
But

3350
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:28,000
You know

3351
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Blizzard

3352
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:30,000
I wonder if they're starting to feel the pressure this year

3353
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:31,000
There's a lot of pressure

3354
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:34,000
To make or break World of Warcraft this year

3355
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:35,000
With this next expansion

3356
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Eventually the bubble's gotta burst

3357
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Yeah

3358
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:39,000
It does for everything

3359
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Well some have said it

3360
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:41,000
It burst a long time ago

3361
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Cataclysm burst that bubble

3362
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,000
I think this year

3363
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:44,000
For example

3364
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Call of Duty Ghost

3365
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Is not gonna outsell

3366
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Black Ops 2

3367
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,000
It's not gonna happen

3368
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:49,000
And I think

3369
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:50,000
I don't think

3370
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:51,000
It might not even be the top

3371
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Game of the year

3372
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Because of Grand Theft Auto coming out

3373
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:54,000
That was huge

3374
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:55,000
29 million copies in 6 weeks

3375
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Good luck

3376
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,000
I mean that's just gonna be hard to do anyways

3377
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:58,000
Even if it was an excellent game

3378
02:08:58,000 --> 02:08:59,000
But just

3379
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:00,000
I don't think anyone really cares

3380
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,000
And I think

3381
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:02,000
The same with

3382
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Wow

3383
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:04,000
There's a lot of

3384
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Other things

3385
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Competing for attention out there

3386
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,000
In the

3387
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,000
You know

3388
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,000
MMO space

3389
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,000
So

3390
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:11,000
They have to do something

3391
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,000
To really

3392
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Interest people in playing it

3393
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,000
And I just don't think

3394
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,000
They're really doing that a lot anymore

3395
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Alright

3396
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Well

3397
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:18,000
Moving on

3398
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:19,000
To the final

3399
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Final Fantasy XIV

3400
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Final Fantasy XIV

3401
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:22,000
Final Fantasy XIV

3402
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Final Fantasy XIV

3403
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Alright

3404
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Well moving on to

3405
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:26,000
One of those

3406
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,000
You know

3407
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:28,000
This is a case of a tweet

3408
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Giving people a lot more hope

3409
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Than maybe they should have

3410
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,000
But you never know

3411
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:32,000
And

3412
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,000
It's also about a Square Enix game

3413
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:34,000
You know

3414
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Like Final Fantasy XIV

3415
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:36,000
It's about

3416
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,000
The Dragon Quest series

3417
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:38,000
And I don't believe

3418
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:39,000
There's been a Dragon Quest game

3419
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Out here in a while

3420
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,000
We did get

3421
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:42,000
We did get Dragon Quest IX

3422
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Right

3423
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:44,000
We did get that

3424
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:45,000
But then

3425
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:46,000
What there was

3426
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Dragon Quest Monsters

3427
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Joker 2

3428
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,000
That was like 2011

3429
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:50,000
That's the last time we've seen

3430
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:51,000
A Dragon Quest game out here

3431
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Now

3432
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:53,000
I know this

3433
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:54,000
But they've been remaking

3434
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:55,000
Dragon Quest games in Japan

3435
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:56,000
There's actually two remakes

3436
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:57,000
That have happened

3437
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
A third is coming out as well

3438
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
They have Dragon Quest Monsters

3439
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
Wonderland 3D

3440
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:04,000
And

3441
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:05,000
What's the other one that they had?

3442
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
They have Dragon Quest VII

3443
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:08,000
That's right

3444
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Being remade for the 3DS

3445
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Ooh

3446
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Awesome

3447
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:12,000
And then of course

3448
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
There's Dragon Quest X

3449
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:15,000
The MMO

3450
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Never happened here in the US

3451
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Right

3452
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:18,000
But there's a lot of people

3453
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:19,000
That want to see it happen

3454
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,000
Well

3455
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,000
There was a tweet

3456
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:22,000
On the Nintendo of America account

3457
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
With hashtag Reginator

3458
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Implying that it was from Reggie

3459
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Fils-Aime himself saying

3460
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:31,000
I'd love to see a new Dragon Quest game too

3461
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
And so a lot of people are like

3462
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Oh well if Reggie wants it

3463
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:35,000
You know

3464
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:36,000
He can make that happen

3465
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:37,000
So

3466
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:40,000
I don't know if he solely can make that happen

3467
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,000
But

3468
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
I'd be a fan of seeing some of these remakes

3469
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Come out over here

3470
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
I'm very curious about Dragon Quest X

3471
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
I'm kind of sad that just didn't happen

3472
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
So

3473
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Who knows

3474
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:52,000
By the way

3475
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:53,000
This is the stuff now

3476
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
That Operation Rainfall and that whole group

3477
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Has their eyes on

3478
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Cause you know

3479
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:58,000
They've got nothing left

3480
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,000
On their original 3

3481
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:00,000
They all came out

3482
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:01,000
They got their way

3483
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
So now they're hoping to get this as well

3484
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:04,000
So

3485
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Good luck

3486
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Hope Nintendo listens to you guys

3487
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:07,000
Cause I'd like to see it

3488
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:08,000
Well

3489
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Speaking of listening to you guys

3490
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Every week you guys can email us

3491
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:12,000
At mailbag

3492
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
At orangeloungeradio.com

3493
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:15,000
In Dark Soccer

3494
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
She dives into the mailbag

3495
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:18,000
And picks out an email or two

3496
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:19,000
To read for you guys

3497
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Here on the show

3498
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:21,000
Or if it's like last week

3499
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:22,000
There'll be five emails

3500
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Nah it's just one

3501
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:24,000
And I had to use my radioactive gloves

3502
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
To slip through the Mandarin text

3503
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:27,000
So

3504
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Yes we're still getting the spam

3505
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:30,000
Bleh

3506
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:31,000
Alright so

3507
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:32,000
What is

3508
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:33,000
So we got one email tonight

3509
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:34,000
One

3510
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:35,000
Alright well what is it

3511
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:36,000
With Twitter links

3512
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:37,000
And I'm just gonna

3513
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Go ahead and read this

3514
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
Hi O.L.R.

3515
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Enlightened Nintendo's recent closure of Swapnote

3516
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
I'd like to bring to your attention

3517
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Some funny as hell comments

3518
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
Made by Sony Computer Entertainment

3519
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:49,000
Shuhei Yoshida

3520
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Enjoy

3521
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,000
And the first one

3522
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Says

3523
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Do you want me to read these

3524
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Cause I know you're on your iPad

3525
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Or

3526
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Uh sure

3527
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Okay

3528
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Uh

3529
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:59,000
The first one is a reply

3530
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:00,000
To somebody saying

3531
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Oh

3532
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Uh

3533
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Okay

3534
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Why

3535
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:05,000
Yoshida says

3536
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Thanks for the feedback

3537
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,000
To the lack of MP3

3538
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,000
And DLNA support

3539
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,000
At the launch of PS4

3540
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
I'll share with the PS4 dev team

3541
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:12,000
For future consideration

3542
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
And somebody replied to that

3543
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:15,000
I need to listen to porn

3544
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Whilst playing Battlefield

3545
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
And Yoshida replied to that

3546
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:20,000
I know

3547
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Yeah

3548
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:25,000
And then there was another tweet

3549
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Where

3550
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Uh

3551
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Somebody tweeted at him

3552
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:29,000
Hey

3553
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:30,000
I wanna know why my dick

3554
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Got caught in my PlayStation 3's

3555
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:33,000
Disc tray

3556
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:34,000
When I tried to play

3557
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:35,000
Killzone Shadow Fall

3558
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:36,000
On my PlayStation 3

3559
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:37,000
It really hurts

3560
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:38,000
And yes

3561
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
I tried turning it on and off again

3562
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Yoshida replied

3563
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Shut up

3564
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Shut up

3565
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
To which the original guy replied

3566
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:48,000
K

3567
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:50,000
That's cute

3568
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,000
Okay

3569
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Also please pardon me for a brief

3570
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Orange Lounge foodie-o tangent

3571
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
But do you guys have a Del Taco in the area?

3572
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Yes, we have plenty of them

3573
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Yeah

3574
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:01,000
They have some

3575
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:02,000
There's literally one up the street

3576
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:03,000
From OLR Studios

3577
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:04,000
And

3578
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:05,000
You better bet

3579
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:06,000
I go there all the time

3580
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,000
It's fantastic

3581
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,000
They have some great chicken tacos

3582
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
And this is true

3583
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:11,000
Signed

3584
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:12,000
The Nasty Canasta

3585
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Oh

3586
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:14,000
One of my favorite handles

3587
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Yes

3588
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:16,000
It always makes me think of like strip poker

3589
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:17,000
But it's Nasty Canasta

3590
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
It's the Nasty Canasta

3591
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
Nasty Canasta does need a theme song huh

3592
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Yeah

3593
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
I need to um

3594
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
It should be like um

3595
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:29,000
It should be like

3596
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:30,000
I don't know

3597
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Like something set to a Burt Bacharach song

3598
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Or something

3599
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Well Nasty Canasta kind of makes me think

3600
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:34,000
Like Copacabana

3601
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Yeah

3602
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Which makes me think of like those

3603
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:37,000
So I don't know

3604
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:38,000
When I go

3605
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Cause you know we love to use

3606
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:40,000
I kind of think of this song

3607
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
That's the Nasty Canasta song now

3608
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
We're not sponsored by Del Taco

3609
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
We're sponsored by Pinkberry

3610
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,000
I wish

3611
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:00,000
I wish we had official sponsorship

3612
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:01,000
I want sugar free Pinkberry

3613
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:02,000
They had a new app come out this week

3614
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:03,000
But I'm not going to plug it

3615
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Because they don't sponsor us

3616
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:06,000
Hey Pinkberry

3617
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Free samples over here

3618
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Alright

3619
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Even though I cannot partake of your deliciousness for a while

3620
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Okay

3621
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:15,000
There you go

3622
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:16,000
So that was our email

3623
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Mailbag at orangeontraded.com

3624
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
You guys didn't make our soccer work very hard this week

3625
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Act deft

3626
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Why Del Taco and not of taco?

3627
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:27,000
Cause you know Americans gotta be stupid

3628
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:30,000
So

3629
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Alright uh

3630
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
Mailbag at orangeontraded.com

3631
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,000
And uh

3632
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,000
You have a week

3633
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
You have an extra week this week

3634
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
And you had an extra hour last night

3635
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:40,000
I'm going to sleep

3636
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:41,000
To really fill up that mailbag

3637
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:42,000
I'm going to sleep

3638
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,000
What?

3639
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,000
During the show next week?

3640
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Yeah

3641
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:46,000
Oh

3642
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Cause we're not having one

3643
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,000
That's right

3644
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,000
I'm going to sleep

3645
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:50,000
Alright

3646
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Let's get to the FUs of the week

3647
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Because before we can sleep

3648
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
We have to get all the angst out of our system

3649
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
So we'll do the FUs of the week

3650
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:16,000
FU to my state of unemployment

3651
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Um

3652
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:21,000
And not hearing back on the one I really wanted to hear back on at all

3653
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:22,000
Um

3654
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:23,000
Yeah

3655
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:27,000
This is an FU to that

3656
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
And also being sore from the gym

3657
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Cause I want to go back tomorrow

3658
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:33,000
And uh

3659
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:34,000
Yeah

3660
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
And Tom Nook

3661
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Cause he's an ass

3662
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Loki?

3663
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Um

3664
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:44,000
I guess after the fact I get to have my wisdom teeth out

3665
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
So that's going to be fun

3666
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:47,000
Oh god that's right

3667
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Aren't you going to miss a show because of that?

3668
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Or you don't know yet?

3669
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
I hope your situation isn't like mine was

3670
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Cause you remember my wisdom teeth coming out don't you?

3671
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Yeah

3672
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:57,000
Where I had

3673
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:58,000
Cause I got mine out when I was a teenager

3674
02:15:58,000 --> 02:15:59,000
So it was no big deal

3675
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:00,000
I've got pictures of it

3676
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:03,000
Where I look like I've been in a prize fight for three months

3677
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Gross

3678
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
I hope yours is better

3679
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Uh

3680
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:10,000
My FU goes to the fact that I don't have tacos right now

3681
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:11,000
And that really sucks

3682
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,000
But

3683
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:13,000
That was the best

3684
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:14,000
That was

3685
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
We were drinking at this party last night that we went to

3686
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Which by the way it was the meme party I talked about on the show before

3687
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
And now I can tell you because

3688
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:24,000
You know I'm not keeping a secret from any of the listeners anymore

3689
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
I witnessed the what lady?

3690
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Which you know that you know that that jpeg of the

3691
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:29,000
What?

3692
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
The really old lady that's missing her teeth or something

3693
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
And just says W A T

3694
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
So I went as the what lady to the party

3695
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:36,000
And it got a great reaction

3696
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
And I drank a lot

3697
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Where were some of the other costumes there?

3698
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Uh

3699
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:46,000
Alan and somebody else ended up as the ridiculously hot photogenic runner guy

3700
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:49,000
So it was really funny that they duplicated the costume

3701
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:50,000
That was really funny

3702
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Uh

3703
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Slag Kick from Game Buoy was doing funeral selfies

3704
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
He was doing selfies at funerals

3705
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
So of course he walked over to me and took a picture of me

3706
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
And put hashtag this bitch soon

3707
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
By the way I have to tell you

3708
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,000
A trick or treater did come to my door dressed as an internet meme

3709
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Oh yeah?

3710
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
He was wearing one of the rage comic shirts

3711
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Wearing a horse head

3712
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,000
He was an internet meme

3713
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Nice nice

3714
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Well and the other one I would say

3715
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Captain Spike also from gamebuoy.org

3716
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Uh did the he wore this like grey hoodie

3717
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:24,000
But he had it stuffed with pillows so he was round

3718
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
And he had a little barbie doll swinging on a chain

3719
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
He was the wrecking ball

3720
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Uh

3721
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:30,000
Get it?

3722
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Get it?

3723
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:32,000
I thought it was funny

3724
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
And he kept saying all night like how comfortable he was

3725
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Cause he had to build him pillows and I was laughing so

3726
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
There you go

3727
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Uh grandpa did not dress up

3728
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:43,000
So we he said something really off

3729
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
As grandpa tends to do if you've ever listened to Hoard House

3730
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:49,000
He said something really unpolitically correct later on in the evening

3731
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
So he said he was a YouTube commenter

3732
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:52,000
So that's that

3733
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:53,000
So anyway

3734
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
Um I don't remember why I was telling that story

3735
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:58,000
But oh yes because we got tacos last night

3736
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
While I had been drinking

3737
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:03,000
And I'll tell you what there is no better food

3738
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
When you've been drinking than tacos

3739
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Even though

3740
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Unless they come from Jack in the Box

3741
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
Eff you to the fact that I'm too fat

3742
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
And uh need to eat less tacos

3743
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
You should try some of that vodka

3744
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:18,000
I'm oh yeah I was supposed to have some of that at the start of part B huh

3745
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:19,000
Mhmm

3746
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Well we'll see

3747
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Rab

3748
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:23,000
Rab vodka

3749
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Maybe maybe I'll do a shot for each call we get tonight

3750
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:27,000
To try to entice

3751
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Everyone call

3752
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Nice

3753
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Do I have to mix it with anything or do I just take it as shots

3754
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:36,000
It it's it's already mixed it's infused with juice

3755
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Nice

3756
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Alright uh let's go to a couple more stories

3757
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
And then we'll open up the phones and take some calls

3758
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:42,000
At 1877 Game OLR

3759
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:43,000
Uh Logie

3760
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:47,000
So Sony has now announced a new Sony rewards uh plan

3761
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Apparently it allows you to earn points for money that you spend on the Playstation store

3762
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:57,000
So you earn for every dollar spent you earn one point

3763
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:03,000
And each of those points equals up to be about one penny versus you know towards something else

3764
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:11,000
So for example if you want to get a brand new Playstation 3 game or Playstation 4 game for $59.99

3765
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:16,000
It's gonna cost you $5,999

3766
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:17,000
Um

3767
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Granted there are other ways you can earn money um or points I should say in there

3768
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Not just with you know purchasing stuff but you can also I think they have um money spent on this

3769
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:33,000
For every dollar you spend on the Sony store

3770
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Every dollar you spend on the purchase or the uh Playstation store

3771
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:45,000
Um when you upload your ticket stubs for Sony pictures, movies and also registered DVDs and Blu-ray discs

3772
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Um they're also gonna have promotions through retail partners

3773
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:51,000
Also if you you know sign up for offers you earn 100 points

3774
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:55,000
Buy a PS3 bundle you earn up to 270 points

3775
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:59,000
Um they said for movie tickets you earn up to 400 points

3776
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:05,000
I'm not sure if that's per ticket or whatever but I mean right there that's a good way there

3777
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:13,000
And um basically for every 1000 points you earn a $10 uh Playstation store code

3778
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Um and then uh 250 points for uh buying the year of Playstation Plus

3779
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:26,000
So yeah lots of ways to earn points and they have rewards including you know not just games and stuff

3780
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:33,000
But you can also get Sony products and they have like other things, digital downloads, musics, you know movie tickets

3781
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:36,000
VIP experiences they say

3782
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:37,000
Oh yay

3783
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
So you know prostitutes I guess

3784
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
That's one I'm led to believe in

3785
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Pole dances

3786
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Good times

3787
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:47,000
Hunting human beings you know that that kind of stuff

3788
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:48,000
Awesome

3789
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Alright uh hey this is a new story about a free game so listen up

3790
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:57,000
Um this is a game that came out on the Super Nintendo in the mid 90s it's called Blackthorn

3791
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:58,000
I don't know how many

3792
02:20:58,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Oh god that game

3793
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Do you remember this game?

3794
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:01,000
Yes I do I have that game

3795
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:04,000
What you may not remember about this game it was a blizzard game

3796
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:05,000
Yes

3797
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Yes

3798
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:10,000
The blizzard that makes Starcraft, Diablo, Warcraft they made a few other games in the heyday

3799
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Blackthorn

3800
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:18,000
Oh yeah oh yeah so Blackthorn is one of them and um what's interesting is if you have a battle.net account

3801
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:21,000
You can go get Blackthorn from Blizzard for free

3802
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:24,000
That's it once you've downloaded the game it's yours to keep it's a free game

3803
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:29,000
I'm gonna speculate here it's to try and get more people on their battle net downloader

3804
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:33,000
Cause if they can give away you know this you know what they're not making any money off this anymore

3805
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:34,000
You mean all that crap I uninstalled

3806
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Well but but if you were to go download the battle net downloader so you can get Blackthorn

3807
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Then hey how easy is it to get a hearthstone on your computer when that comes out which is probably this week during Blizzcon

3808
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:53,000
And how easy is it to get a Starcraft demo and a Diablo demo cause all that shit will automatically download if you don't tell it not to

3809
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:58,000
So uh they know what they're doing with this they're just trying to get that battle net thing on more computers

3810
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:04,000
But hey free game and for those of you that are already playing Warcraft and Diablo and all that stuff anyway

3811
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:09,000
And you know shit you already have that stuff on your computer so why not add Blackthorn to that

3812
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:12,000
So check that out at battle.net

3813
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:20,000
Alright we are uh we're ready to open up the skype line at 1877 game OLR or username on skype orange lounge radio

Jamie made this vodka she's making moonshine in her basement

3817
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Not the vodka itself the vodka is actually um actual potato vodka that I filtered myself

3818
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:47,000
And it this one has I believe plum nectarine and um a couple of other fruits in it I don't remember I made it a while back so it's pretty potent

3819
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:52,000

So there's plenty to discuss and uh I have my shot glass here I have a tall shot glass uh Alan collects shot glasses

It will be it will be a very polite shot shout out to all our Canadian listeners up north

3826
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:26,000

3827
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:33,000
I know at least one of them listens pretty regularly and uh Alan wait since you're walking by where's the shot glass from is this when you went to Toronto?

3828
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
That's when you went to Toronto

3829
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:42,000
Alan went to Toronto once and we really really want to go well I've never been I've only been to Vancouver so I really want to go back to Toronto

3830
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Oh wait I lied when I was 17 I went to Niagara Falls but you know that wasn't seeing very much of Canada

3831
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:55,000
Cause I really want to go to Toronto so I know we've got listeners up there so these shots are for you guys if anybody calls

3832
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000

02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
We're talking about food

3838
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:08,000
Are they talking about food?

3839
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
We're talking about restaurant chains and where they are in the country

3840
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:16,000
I noticed somebody said racks roast beef earlier I was like oh my god that's a blast from the past

3841
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:20,000
You know what was a big blast for me that they don't have anymore was Kenny Rogers Roasters

3842
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
That's a thing?

3843
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:28,000
Yeah it's basically like Boston Market it's almost exactly the same so in Boston Market I was like oh that's neat

3844
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:32,000
That is awesome alright we are starting to get some calls here so let's go to it

3845
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
Hi you're on Orange Tons Radio who's this?

3846
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
Hey this is Tech Q

3847
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Hey Tech Q?

3848
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:39,000
Yes

3849
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:43,000
What is on your mind Tech Q? Oh wait first before I get to what's on your mind let me hold on

3850
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
Oh god this bottle's hard to open hold on

3851
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
Did everyone hear that?

3852
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:52,000
Will you talk to Tech Q for me while I pour a shot here?

3853
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:57,000
Rob is pouring himself some pink liquor so what do you have to talk about tonight?

3854
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:04,000
I wanted to comment about the news of this generation that you did earlier

3855
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Y'all forgot to mention the red ring 360

3856
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
Yeah there was the red ring

3857
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Oh yeah the 360 red ring

3858
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Why do you, I mean obviously I can answer this too but why do you feel this was a defining moment of the generation?

3859
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:39,000
I think it affected like 90% of all 360s that were sold up to a point until they finally admitted that they shot the hardware that they sold

3860
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:51,000
What do you think Microsoft's learned from this going into the next generation? Do you trust that the Xbox One's not going to have these similar types of problems or what?

3861
02:25:51,000 --> 02:26:01,000
I would hope they would, they wouldn't get my money if I were going to get Xbone

3862
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:06,000
What are your thoughts on the upcoming generation? I know we had the Fugu question of the week earlier

3863
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:10,000
Are you jumping in on any of these new consoles? Are you taking a wait and see approach or what?

3864
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Since I traded in my 360 why not get a PS4 cheap

3865
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:20,000
But that is interesting that you traded in the Microsoft console to get the Sony console

3866
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:24,000
What weighed in on that decision? Was that just about price or what?

3867
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:40,000
It's basically before they did the 180 mantra back in July I was just disgusted with them on their policy especially on that used game DRM crap that they tried to pull

3868
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:46,000
So it was probably one of those things where by the time they reversed course it was too late you'd pre-ordered your PS4 right?

3869
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Yeah

3870
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Yeah makes sense

3871
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:52,000
Alright well TechQ anything else you want to share with us tonight?

3872
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:53,000
Don't get too drunk

3873
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
Alright I'll try I will drink responsibly

3874
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:58,000
This is Rob of course he will no I'm kidding

3875
02:26:58,000 --> 02:26:59,000
Alright take care buddy thanks for calling

3876
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Thanks

3877
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:01,000
Alright bye

3878
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Bye bye

3879
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:07,000
Yes the liquor is good and what you didn't, during that call Alan came in here and took a shot as well and he approved too

3880
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:14,000
What shot glass did he use? Oh how appropriate he used the Hard Rock Atlanta shot glass that I brought him from this year's DragonCon

3881
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:15,000
How appropriate

3882
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:19,000
So yeah I don't remember what else I put in I think it had mango too

3883
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:25,000
It has yumminess in it I'll tell you that but we've got surprise surprise now we're getting tons of calls we got another call coming in

3884
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
Hi you're on Orange Lawn's radio who's this?

3888
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:43,000
Yes yes indeed and I have my whipped cream vodka right here

3889
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:47,000
When I'm old and in a wheelchair she'll be switching out my IV bag with liquor

3890
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Alright

3891
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:49,000

3892
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000

3

3898
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:01,000
Down and 1

3899
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Does it burn nicely?

3900
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:05,000
That's good

3901
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:06,000
I like to drop you a glass

3902
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:07,000
Oh that you can't have that

3903
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:08,000
My bad

3904
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Alright now that that's taken care of what's on your mind buddy?

3905
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:17,000
I'm just amused by the whole PlayStation FAQ it just amuses the living shit out of me

3906
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:25,000
It's like when the next when the prior gen came in it was like it can play video games it can do this this and that and I'm like

3907
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Can it play Street Fighter?

3908
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:28,000
Yes but it can also do this

3909
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
Can it play Street Fighter?

3910
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:31,000
Yes it can play Street Fighter

3911
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Thank you

3912
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:35,000
PlayStation 4 it can only play Street Fighter

3913
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
But I want to do all of this

3914
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
But you can only play Street Fighter

3915
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:40,000
But I want to do this

3916
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:44,000
Well you should have kept your prior gen console now shouldn't you?

3917
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:47,000
That sounds too much like a Microsoft line

3918
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:55,000
See that's the funny part it's like when Microsoft came out the gate running their mouth with everything that they're going to do

3919
02:28:55,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Everyone had their guns ready they were going to Microsoft castle and just hang Dracula

3920
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:06,000
And Sony's like they're like Gendo they're like we're just gonna wait this out

3921
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:13,000
Now they're waiting it out and Sony's like we're gonna do a little bit of this we're gonna do a little bit of that we're gonna do a little bit of this

3922
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:19,000
And the people like wait a minute this is what Microsoft's were doing but it's Sony so it's okay

3923
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Well that and Sony was a little bit smarter about how they delivered the bad news to be honest

3924
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:28,000
They really waited until the last minute and just kind of snuck it in under the radar

3925
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:35,000
And to be real all of these features while they're disappointing at the end of the day they don't really ruin the gaming experience

3926
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:43,000
And you know one place where people really razzed the shit out of Microsoft was that they were talking about TV and all this other stuff that wasn't games

3927
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:53,000
At that original Xbox reveal and Sony is basically now saying like yeah we're games and not a lot else at this point with the removal of some of these media things

3928
02:29:53,000 --> 02:30:01,000
So it's very interesting like Sony is still delivering on the games part of it and Microsoft's getting there too with their policy adjustments and so forth

3929
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:08,000
Yeah true true I can't hate on them for that but I'm amused where they say no DLNA

3930
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:15,000
My train of thought is well you know what if I can't watch my anime on the PlayStation 4 I'll just fire up my PlayStation 3

3931
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:23,000
I kind of feel like that's one of the first things you're gonna see get reversed I really think they're listening and I think they're gonna come back and be like

3932
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:29,000
Whoa we didn't realize people were was like gonna make a big deal out of this and miss this so I kind of suspect you're gonna see it

3933
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:36,000
I believe it I believe it it's just a little bit of time which is why I am not running out in the next 12 days to buy one

3934
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:44,000
And that's also part of the reason I mean not just the video it's just the expense and everything and the whole fact that you know the games are disappearing that I was gonna pick up

3935
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:53,000
Well from the trailer I mean when the promo for the console I'm not really a first person shooter type of guy

3936
02:30:53,000 --> 02:31:01,000
If I play those I'm playing it for the story which is why I like Battlefield 3 the hell with the multiplayer I like the story mode from start to finish

3937
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Interesting I don't usually hear people talk about the story in that game

3938
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:10,000
That's how I am cause if I'm gonna do multiplayer it's gonna be with you and whoever else we're gonna be running our mouths like dumbasses but you know

3939
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:11,000
Yeah of course

3940
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:20,000
There's only one game on the PS4 that I want it's The Order it's a first person shooter that's full steampunk that's it

3941
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
That was like fun

3942
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:31,000
Yeah and I can that's not coming until like 2014 I can wait same thing with the Wii U Bayonetta 2 and Mario Kart 8 I can wait

3943
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
X1 still waiting

3944
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:39,000
Mario 3D World though that's starting to up the urgency a little bit you gotta admit a little bit

3945
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Not with me cause as G of Day I can tell you I'm more of a Mario Kart hoard than anything else

3946
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:54,000
You know what that's totally fair totally fair I wish Nintendo would announce an F-Zero but as somebody said in chat earlier with all the upside downness of Mario Kart 8

3947
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:59,000
Mario Kart is starting to take F-Zero's features I kinda think that says what we need to know about F-Zero

3948
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:07,000
Yes and no but I'll tell you this now F-Zero on 3DS would be sick because we've played F-Zero

3949
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:17,000
The game plays a lot faster than Mario Kart it's a lot faster speed it's tighter controls I mean like I said I have the XL

3950
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
And there's no fucking blue shells

3951
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:28,000
Exactly I mean all the 3DS games I play on my XL now they feel a lot more surreal a lot more in depth I have a lot more fun playing them

3952
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:34,000
So F-Zero on that Mario Kart on it I'm sold I'm like yes

3953
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Alright well I don't know about you Rama I'm starting to feel this liquor a little bit feels good

3954
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:49,000
Not me man and I shouldn't even be taking another shot cause I gotta get up at 630 for work and I have like a near 90 minute commute to work now so

3955
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:52,000
You have a way better tolerance than I that's all I can say

3956
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:56,000
I will send you some of my liver powers

3957
02:32:57,000 --> 02:33:05,000
Well my liver powers have been adhered through Patty cause she's heavy handed when she pours so Rob when you come out here to the east coast

3958
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:10,000
You'll spend a week with her when you come back you'll have an iron liver

3959
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:19,000
I really am hoping to get back out to New York in 2014 it is one of the goals if for nothing else than to see NPH and Hedvig that's gotta happen

3960
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:22,000
If worst case scenario it's a box

3961
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:23,000
As who?

3962
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:24,000
Hedvig

3963
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:25,000
Willy

3964
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:27,000
Yeah I know right?

3965
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:28,000
Alright

3966
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000

3967
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:33,000

I wanna go back out there

3976
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:54,000
Speaking of the New York orange lounge radio listeners I know this guy hasn't listened for a while but I just saw this in chat

3977
02:33:54,000 --> 02:34:01,000
SJ100Matt said this in chat and I was like no way really apparently Sephiroth1215 won one of the Playstation 4's through Taco Bell

02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:13,000
Pouring another

3986
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:18,000
Skyplines lighting up pretty soon I'm not even gonna be able to click on the answer button

3987
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Hi orange lounge radio who's this?

3988
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
Hey this is act deaf

3989
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:27,000
Hey act deaf hold on we'll get to your call in a minute but there's something I gotta do first

3990
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:34,000
Yeah we have a name for that when you drink a shot it's called Idago

3991
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:38,000
When you take a shot of all the glass so yeah do it

3992
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
What does it mean Idago?

3993
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:50,000
Idago it's a name it's actually the name of one of the founding fathers of the nation

3994
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:51,000
So Idago

3995
02:34:51,000 --> 02:35:01,000
I don't know where the name comes from for taking a shot but it's something I've heard throughout the years

3996
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:06,000
You know what fair enough I gave a shout out to the Canadians earlier so this one goes out to my Mexicans down below here we go

3997
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:09,000
And I did put the stuff in a petrol bottle

3998
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
There you go act deaf

3999
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:15,000
So maybe does it count that I put it in a petrol bottle?

4000
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Perhaps alright what's on your mind buddy I took the shot what's up

4001
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:25,000
Well I wanted to talk about the influential game of the generation or most influential

4002
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:30,000
Yeah what do you believe is the most influential game of the generation?

4003
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:31,000
Portal

4004
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Portal oh yeah you mentioned this in chat earlier and Jamie somewhat agreed with you is her number two pick

4005
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
Why did you pick Portal?

4006
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Basically well Portal didn't do anything that well how to say that special or that original

4007
02:35:50,000 --> 02:36:00,000
Besides the portals or the physics in the game that's something that we have we already seen in other games especially like Half Life and stuff like that

4008
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:13,000
But it was influential because of the storytelling basically it's most of the games after Portal try to imitate something in the storytelling in them

4009
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:23,000
Like games at least in a more serious and more detailed well not detailed sorry I'm trying to gather my words

4010
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:30,000
That's alright was that because of GLaDOS you think? Like everybody loves that character

4011
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Yeah part of that and part of Shell being mute it's basically like playing Zelda or playing Mario where the main characters are mute

4012
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:55,000
But since this is a first person game so basically they're talking to you so it's a more personal maybe

4013
02:36:55,000 --> 02:37:11,000
And all the experience around it because it's like especially because of that it's a first person it's a more personal experience all around

4014
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:23,000
You're the one doing the stuff all the stuff happens to you directly so it's a lot of games after Portal have kind of imitated that

4015
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:36,000
So it's not maybe in a first person perspective but more in what happens in the decisions that you make or the other stuff that you do in the game

4016
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:39,000
Well basically it's you

4017
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:49,000
You know what also was great about first person shooter I'm starting to slur a little bit about Portal you know what was great about Portal besides just what you're talking about like the immersion and all that

4018
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:55,000
The thing that was great about Portal is that it was a first person shooter game for people that hate first person shooters

4019
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
Yeah basically

4020
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:08,000
I mean really like everybody I know that like hates first person shooters still loves Portal because it's more of like it's more a puzzle obviously but it's yet it is that first person

4021
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:22,000
And especially that because I got the orange box on the 360 basically for Portal I didn't finish even the Half Life 2 and didn't even start episode 1 and 2

4022
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:34,000
I played Team Fortress and I still play it that's a game I enjoy but basically I got the orange box because of Portal and I played a hell a lot of it

4023
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
There's a lot of people that do that

4024
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:48,000
I have three different copies of it two on the Xbox I got the orange box and still alive and then I got the copy on Steam so I love that game a lot

4025
02:38:49,000 --> 02:39:03,000
Like you said it's an immersive game it's totally immersive and like I said a lot of games have tried to replicate that immersion and a few have succeeded in it

4026
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:18,000
Not all of them but it's basically the legacy that Portal has handed down to gaming and I think it's a pretty important thing too in this generation and probably the next

4027
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:22,000
And very important with Portal and Jonathan Coulton

4028
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
Oh yeah

4029
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:29,000
Alright well Act F I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show but thank you so much for your call buddy

4030
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Thank you

4031
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:31,000
Alright take care

4032
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Bye

4033
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:48,000
Alright that does it for calls tonight oh I know more you wanted to call in to get me to take more shots but you guys it's a school night I got to work tomorrow and I'm already feeling a little bit tipsy so I asked the bartender to call me off

4034
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
To call it off close it down shut it down

4035
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:51,000
Cut you off

4036
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:52,000
Cut me off that's what I was looking for

4037
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
And I got you water because I'm nice

4038
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
You are a good friend

4039
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
I would help you hide bodies

4040
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
You are what would you hold my head over the toilet

4041
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
I'd hold your hair back if you had enough

4042
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
Hey

4043
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
I'm not talking I'm talking about long hair

4044
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:07,000
Jerk

4045
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:08,000
Rob

4046
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:13,000
You know I have a complex about that and I'm just kidding I don't but it's funny

4047
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
So I learned something today

4048
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:16,000
Okay what

4049
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
I learned what they call a combover in Japan

4050
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
A barcode hair

4051
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:23,000
Nah I don't like that look at all

4052
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:26,000
Yeah it's kind of bad but I still thought that was a funny name

4053
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:29,000
There is nothing wrong with rocking the bald look as far as I'm concerned

4054
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:30,000
You know what

4055

Um there were no tweets tonight that I saw that were stories or anything so if you want to tweet us for future week

4101
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:57,000
Twitter excuse me twitter.com slash olr

4102
02:41:57,000 --> 02:42:01,000
I'm a little scatterbrained right now because I just had three shots in a very short amount of time

4103
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
And I have no alcohol tolerance to begin with

4104
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:06,000
Um I want to thank all you guys for listening to the show

4105
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:10,000
And uh encourage you to keep spreading the word about Orange Orange Radio

4106
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:14,000
We appreciate all the feedback and all the good good stuff you guys leave out there for us

4107
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:18,000
Sorry we won't be here next week but you know what once in a while we're gonna take a week off it happens

4108
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:24,000
Um if you are gonna be at Blizzcon I'm unfortunately not going to the convention itself

4109
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
Which I talked about why on a previous episode of the show

4110
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:30,000
But I will be at the World of Podcasts event that's Thursday night

4111
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Um I will be there as will grandpa from Horde House so come find us and say hello

4112
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:39,000
I swear we are very open and like don't be shy we're really friendly

4113
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:44,000
And we'll probably be at the bar so I'll probably be a little out of it like I am right now and that makes me extra friendly

4114
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:49,000
So come see us at World of Podcasts otherwise you'll have to catch me at Blizzcon the next day

4115
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
Uh so for those of you that are going to Blizzcon

4116
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:55,000
For the rest of you we'll see you in two weeks back here on November 17th

4117
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:59,000
When we will be living in a world with the Playstation 4 and soon the Xbox One

4118
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:00,000
Yes

4119
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:03,000
A new era of gaming a new era of Orange Orange Radio in a way

4120
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:07,000
Even though none of us are gonna get it but I imagine we'll all be playing somebody else's at least

4121
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
You know what we need to do?

4122
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
We need to have a PS4 QQ party

4123
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:14,000
That would be fun and we'll just play Playstation 1 games all night

4124
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
Jumping Flash Marathon

4125
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
I thought of Jumping Flash 2

4126
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:19,000
Oh my god

4127
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:20,000
This is why we're friends

4128
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:24,000
You have to play Playstation 1 games on your PS3 because it's 1 plus 3 and there you go 4

4129
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:28,000
I like the way you think even though it's kinda ridiculous but that's why we keep you around

4130
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:31,000
I still have to get a battery for the Saturn

4131
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:34,000
I've been telling Dan to bring one home from work and he hasn't

4132
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
Alright we're gonna wrap up the show

4133
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:40,000
Um thank you guys very much I guess we gotta go around and get everybody's final thoughts

4134
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:45,000
I feel like I'm forgetting something at the end of the show but it's just because things are spinning a little bit right now

4135
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:48,000
So uh Loki your final thought tonight

4136
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:54,000
I wonder if the memory card adapter for the Playstation 3 that they had at launch or whatever works with the PocketStation

4137
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:57,000
Wait did you have last minute stories? I forgot to ask you

4138
02:43:57,000 --> 02:44:00,000
No like I have last minute stories

4139
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
Who does last minute stories anymore?

4140
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:03,000
Alright uh

4141
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:04,000
It's November

4142
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
Dark Soccer your final thought tonight

4143
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Uh words

4144
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:13,000
My final thought tonight is Disneyland

4145
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:14,000
I missed you

4146
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:15,000
Duffy

4147
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
Yes and Duffy

4148
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
And Dark Soccer gets to babysit

4149
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
Cause she's my friend you're a good friend

4150
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:22,000
Yeah we need to work out the details

4151
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
You get me drunk and then you babysit my cat

4152
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:25,000
Alright

4153
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
Have a good week everybody

4154
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:28,000
Enjoy the week off

4155
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
We will be back in 2 weeks

4156
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:35,000
So during the week off we really encourage you check out other great independent podcasts

4157
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:41,000
Because there's a lot of great stuff out there and uh you know without the 3 hours you have with us next week

4158
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:47,000
That's at least 3 1 hour shows you could be listening to from some other hard working independent podcasters

4159
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
So please keep supporting independent podcasting

4160
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:53,000
Thank you guys very much for tuning into our show and have a wonderful night

4161
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:56,000
We will see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio

4162
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:59,000
And I have to buy myself more time while I look for the outro

4163
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
I can't even find the outro on this list

4164
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:02,000
Where is it?

4165
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
Is it gone? There it is

4166
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
