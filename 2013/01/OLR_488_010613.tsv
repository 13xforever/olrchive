14046	15027	Tonight, January 6, 2013.
16809	20253	Could Sony be planning to block used games on the next PlayStation?
20553	22996	New hacking progress is made on the 3DS.
23396	26400	And could being an MMO player make you a better employee?
31400	40748	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week, the first of 2013 of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
41308	51918	We are here live at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, where we do tape live every Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
52038	53299	My name is Rob Roberts.
53459	55421	I'll be joining you over the next few hours.
55481	56822	Joining you, joining you.
56842	57062	Joining you.
57742	58483	Slow down, Rob.
58843	66188	I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and gamer fun with my co-hosts.
66508	67669	And gamers suck, maybe.
68230	70471	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
70771	71672	Gamer cock.
71972	72793	Gamer cock?
73213	73433	No.
73793	75675	I don't know what kind of show you're co-hosting.
76261	78722	Well, one that involves 3D, no.
78902	80662	But I bet it has a lot of subscribers.
81522	83703	Also joining us, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
83863	84223	Hello.
84423	85443	How are you, Techmaster Loki?
85703	86403	I'm doing fine.
86683	87803	All right, good times.
88023	89284	So here we are, first show, 2013.
89664	91664	I hope you all had a safe New Year.
91824	96985	Obviously, you must have because you're here listening to the show tonight, be it in its live form or in its podcast form.
97385	99686	There was a lot of crazy shit that went down on New Year's.
100186	128312	I know especially in this neighborhood well not like this very neighborhood but in SAC I think this was all over like the international news or something they had those shootings in Old Town and what a bunch of fuckery like leave your guns at home on New Year's seriously why do people feel the need like I know there's second amendments blah blah blah I don't want to get into the gun debate but why do people feel the need to fire their guns on December 31st someone was shot at at McDonald's around the corner from my house like a couple days ago ugh
129512	130193	Stop shooting people.
130213	131974	If I was at McDonald's, I'd shoot myself too.
133695	134115	Too soon?
134996	136977	Loki, how was your McDonald's that you brought to the show tonight?
137037	138098	It was delicious.
139179	139439	All right.
140239	144862	Also, the New Year's always means that Consumer Electronics Show right around the corner.
144962	146964	So CES is starting this week.
147544	150666	Not usually a lot of video game news out of CES.
150826	152648	You get some things once in a while.
152688	154849	Like I remember Game Room on the Xbox 360.
155750	158131	That was a Consumer Electronics Show announcement a couple years ago.
159632	171775	Now that we see that video game devices are becoming more and more prevalent, like these entertainment boxes that are in the living rooms, you might expect to see a little more about the other stuff that consoles do at Consumer Electronics Show.
172215	179556	I don't really know what that is, but it might be very interesting to keep an eye on it, even with Microsoft's reduced presence in Sony and so forth.
179576	186858	It would be interesting to see what kind of direction they're going in as a company might be dropping some hints about the next gaming systems.
187598	188559	Loki, any thoughts?
188839	192140	Do you think we could get any major gaming news at a consumer electronics show?
192300	196703	I know they're supposed to be doing this stuff for Disney Infinity this week.
197323	198463	So there should be an announcement of that.
198483	199804	Because it's tech, sort of.
199924	204166	Okay, because Skylanders technically is not just the game.
204206	206807	It's all those little figurines, too.
207288	208488	So they have probably that.
208528	214571	You probably see a little bit... Maybe you might see something in regards to the whole streaming...
216312	225447	IPTV stuff that Microsoft's planning on rolling out because that seems a little bit more par for CES.
227270	230596	Obviously some stuff new, maybe Android tablets, that kind of thing.
232695	234297	That's pretty much it.
235678	238940	I can't really think of anything really, really big that would be announced.
239661	241902	Wasn't Sony working on some type of network like that too?
242403	242863	I don't care.
243503	245085	They probably all are, honestly.
247006	252110	Have you played around a lot with the TV thing on the Nintendo Wii?
252150	252991	Oh, you don't have a Wii.
253331	254131	Yes, I totally have.
254191	254612	Have you?
255532	256993	I watch TV all the time.
274504	277126	Okay, I want to watch The Office.
277626	285590	And then it's like, okay, you can watch Office on Hulu, you can watch it on Netflix, you can download episodes from Vudu or something like that.
285610	290173	Or it's live on Channel 3 right now and press this button to flip your TV to check.
290533	294755	Because not only did you spend $350 on a Wii U, but it's a brand new universal remote.
294935	298818	I don't know if you knew that, but it also does those functions with all the infrared and such.
299878	300499	So yeah, the...
303320	306821	The boxy box that I have, which is very obsolete now.
306961	311342	I actually went to Walmart the other day to get some things in.
311782	315283	First thing I did, of course, is check to see how many Wii U's are sitting there, and there were eight.
316583	326085	So, you know, kind of going back to that, they're not flying off shelves because they're sitting on shelves.
327425	331646	But I noticed they had a new boxy box, which I'd never fucking buy that.
331886	335628	and I recommend anybody that's thinking about a streaming box, do not buy the fucking boxy.
335828	336949	It is fucking terrible.
337990	340691	Although, right now, it works alright for Netflix and I like the remote.
342172	347415	And you can stream porn on it pretty easily because they have porn apps that people have made for it, so it's fantastic for that.
347435	348096	Well, thank God.
348496	350817	Hey, it's gotta have some good features to it.
351678	356360	Even this weird, like, I don't know what nationality is, but it comes in an HD and it's like...
357761	360203	It's like Skinamax all the time.
361184	371813	It has that look of possibly a porn channel, and there is some nudity there, but they never really... It's kind of like, okay, we're watching hot women in skimpy clothes playing darts.
372774	373394	It doesn't make any sense.
373414	375196	Not just Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball?
375316	377437	No, it's just weird.
379239	383462	We like to look at that every now and then and go, okay, what non-sex things are they doing on this channel?
383502	384003	It's just funny.
384723	399839	um anyways but yeah so mainly for um Netflix although it's slow and I'm sure there's other things out there although I hear the Ouya works in fact there's actually been a lot of videos showing the Ouya and stuff and using different um
400700	401821	Android applications on there.
401861	404282	They showed OnLive and how that works out.
404302	405202	It works out pretty good.
405783	411045	Also, I forget the program, but it's basically Xbox Media Center.
411506	416768	It's called something else on Android, but that works pretty well.
417689	420050	You may be able to use that as a streamer as well.
420070	421030	I'm kind of looking forward to that.
422651	426313	I haven't really messed around too much with the TV app, but it looks alright.
426333	427954	It better work well.
428494	429795	That's one of the things they were pimping out on it.
430086	433609	I want to introduce the ever-present fourth guest on our show, the live chatters.
450100	464731	Later on in the week Because we want our live and our podcast folks to both be able to participate as much as possible But we love the instant gratification of live And we're talking a little bit about TV in the chat room right now One of the other parts of TV that I didn't bring up with you, Loki
465151	478203	is that, you know, when you'd watch the sports games and so forth, you actually get the little play-by-play on the, you know, second screen, and you can do the whole Miiverse, you know, liking and commenting, like, so-and-so shot a three-point shot from down the court or whatever.
478543	480225	You can actually kind of participate with that.
480625	485990	Well, Tigerclaw in chat is telling me about, I guess they did something similar for Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve.
486431	489634	They were posting little screenshots, and people were actually commenting.
489654	489734	Yeah.
490234	491335	Dick Clark's Rockin' New Year's Eve
509250	533813	It was the Dickless, Dick Clark, New Year's, Rockin' Eve, rest in peace But I was saying it's really too bad they didn't do it for the Anderson Cooper, Kathy Griffin coverage Which always gives America a lot more to talk about the next day I love them Anyhow Let's see Jason in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says Didn't OnLive die?
535703	540265	Well, yeah, the company got bought by another company, but the service is still going.
540785	541505	It's not dead.
541565	543126	It's just another company.
543166	544026	Under new management.
544166	545147	Yeah, pretty much.
545327	548448	I mean, it's just everyone likes to hype that crap up.
548668	550069	Oh, it's dead.
551069	551869	No, it's still going.
551909	554310	It's just people don't focus on it right now.
554350	555271	But hey, it works.
555671	557692	I mean, that's cool.
558172	560673	And that's console games on your... Oh, yeah.
560793	561033	I mean...
562079	564221	The more I hear about the Ouya, I am interested in it.
564261	568044	I did not back the Kickstarter because I was a little bit skeptical.
568525	570287	Some Kickstarters have not gone so well.
570867	576332	But if the Ouya continues to deliver the way people are saying it, it sounds like it would be worth checking out.
576352	578974	Hopefully, I'll have mine in March.
579014	579515	Hopefully.
579535	579775	Maybe.
579795	580196	Maybe.
582250	582990	Possibly.
583510	584011	Probably.
584111	587912	And at least I know I have one game because I backed Evilot.
587972	589532	So whenever that comes out.
590293	592573	I think I might get the Shadowgate game on that.
592633	593254	I don't remember.
593514	596215	I backed Shadowgate and I know I get it at least on the consoles.
596235	598095	But I can't remember if they said they were doing an OUYA one or not.
598175	598635	I don't remember.
599296	599396	Eh.
599676	599896	Anyway.
601117	602217	Let's see, what else do I want to talk about?
602237	605460	Speaking of March, something I was looking at before the show was a calendar.
605860	622291	Tonight is the 489th episode of our show, so assuming we don't miss any more episodes, because we took a week for the holidays off, but assuming we do all our shows between now and episode 500, that means episode 500 is March 31st of this year, the night before April Fool's Day.
623632	624133	Good lord.
624393	625233	How appropriate.
625253	626074	Yeah.
626394	627635	for our big milestone.
627975	630096	We have no idea what we're doing for our 500th episode.
630136	630676	We have no idea.
630896	635899	I mean, we always talk about... You know, we've been doing this ever since our show turned one year old.
636139	637680	Should we do a big celebration this year?
637700	639060	Should we do something for five years?
639080	640181	Should we do something for ten years?
640901	642822	It just ends up being another show.
642902	643483	So we'll see.
643803	646364	If you guys have big ideas, what should we do to celebrate episode 500?
646624	649285	How should we... Keep in mind...
650706	651447	We're on a budget.
652167	654188	This show has been done very low cost for a long time.
654208	656029	The budget is no budget.
656069	656650	That's right.
657250	660272	You better be willing to back a Kickstarter if you start to go crazy.
660292	662653	We do accept BevMo gift cards.
663354	665295	At least I do.
665595	666456	We can build a fort.
667256	669698	Actually, that would be an appropriate way to celebrate episode 500.
670258	672259	We need to find a fort to broadcast from.
672679	674200	We could build a blanket fort.
676679	681783	or as the certain individual that we saw a couple of days ago, we just climb under a table.
681903	683104	Why don't you talk about that real quick?
683124	686827	Because it is podcast related and you guessed it on another podcast.
686847	688228	I did, roundaboutly.
688748	692711	About a hundred times the subscribers, a thousand times the subscribers this show does.
693132	697255	But tell the story quickly about the podcast that you quote unquote guessed it on this week.
697974	707401	Rob and Alan were awesome and got me a ticket to go to the Smartest Man in the World podcast, which is the one that Greg Proops of Whose Line Is It fame is on.
707441	708762	You know, he was also Mr. Conductor.
709023	710043	Whose Line Is It anyway?
710283	710744	Whatever.
711544	718149	He was also a voice in that black and white game with the hacking and slashing on the Wii with the commentary.
718249	718650	Mad World.
718730	719410	Mad World, thank you.
719610	724174	But he was also Mr. Conductor on both the UK and the American version of Thomas the Tank Engine.
724514	728058	He was also a commentator in the Pod Race segment.
728659	729159	That's right.
729219	730961	He does a lot of commenting.
731041	733524	He hosted the show Versus on Comedy Central.
733784	737428	I think they should really have him commentate more on fictional things.
737529	738570	That would be awesome.
739190	740792	Wouldn't it just be comment?
741153	743155	Can he commentate on our show?
743175	744176	Wouldn't it just be comment?
744817	744957	No.
746800	749681	because comment suggests singular.
749741	752562	Are you saying episode 500 should come with a commentary track?
752922	753682	I think it should.
753862	754442	Hold on.
755782	756483	All right, anyhow.
757223	758023	What do you mean, hold on?
758283	759063	You were in the middle of the story.
759083	760404	I'm saying if commentate is an actual word.
760424	760824	All right, stop it.
761004	764885	Okay, it actually is, but it means specifically for the purpose of an user sports broadcast.
765405	794507	so Greg Proops is awesome um well he came out first and shook everybody's hands and by then I was already into my second drink and uh yeah classy guy before the thing even starts podcasting you know he walks out into the audience and shakes everybody's hand and like it's really cool I was just like you know I actually met him once like 10 years ago but I don't expect him to remember me so I you know I just kind of shook his hand I'm like hi there nice to meet you and he put you know hi I'm Greg he was just very very kind
794850	808237	Yeah, well, I actually managed to get up there during the question segment after the long, boring, preachy part, which is actually my favorite part of his podcast ever because I think there's very little he says that I don't agree with philosophically.
808377	813459	Yeah, if you think this show is political too much, you may not actually want to download Smartest Man in the World.
813539	814360	Oh, download it anyway.
814380	815220	You learned something.
815300	816941	He does do his boring, preachy part.
817001	820483	He knows more about baseball than...
821223	824005	than anyone I know, especially the old Negro Leagues.
824766	829909	Because I actually was into some of that myself because Hank Aaron's from my hometown.
831310	836253	And I knew about Satchel Paige and loved... All right, quickly, finish the damn story.
836293	837314	We've got to get to gaming news.
837534	848482	So anyway, I get up there and ask him my question comparing modern-day political action to the French Revolution and the Russian overthrow when they overthrew the Tsars.
848522	850523	But he was fixated on your name at first.
850723	851965	Yes, he was fixated on my name.
852566	854548	He said he couldn't hear my name at first.
854588	857452	So I said, Jamie, like the bionic woman, except without superpowers.
858033	860115	And then he starts serenading me to Van Halen.
862438	863880	And I'm just sitting there going, wow.
864481	864802	And then he...
869355	871017	He wrote you a letter on stage.
884295	887017	BlackWolf in our chatroom says, So if I sing Van Halen to Jamie, taking notes,
912952	916313	It's honestly not one of my favorite Van Halen songs, but you know.
916573	923176	Anyhow, the podcast is not posted yet, but it is the smartest man in the world podcast.
923216	924296	It's on iTunes and all that.
924736	931699	And you're just going to want to look for the episode that was taped at the Sacramento Punchline, which I think should be posted probably this Friday or next Friday.
931739	935080	He's a couple weeks behind production versus what's posted.
935500	936260	So we'll let you know.
936400	937621	So he was very much like Bobby.
939966	940666	Good job.
940686	941947	That was a good zing.
942067	944589	I found on my Tumblr.
944609	946851	He's gotten better, though.
947351	950714	My Tumblr, for people who don't know, is kurotsubasa.tumblr.com.
950734	951414	That's my main one.
951915	953856	It's K-U-R-O-U Tsubasa.
953876	955057	I'm not going to spell the whole thing.
955597	962102	But if you look on my 1-3-13 post, pictures of... Why don't you just ask Ranma to retumble it?
963223	965365	Can't she hit that button and it retumbles it?
965945	966826	I guess he could do it.
966886	968267	Have him do that on the Orange Launch Radio account.
968760	971922	But yeah, the pictures are there.
971942	972703	It was really cool.
972963	977926	And also someone randomly friended me on Tumblr because she was there too.
979085	979385	Awesome.
979986	981407	The internet making the world a smaller place.
981467	984309	And we found out that there's yet another friend of mine that you know from Rocky.
985249	985530	Yes.
986350	986911	Yeah.
987251	989452	It's a small Sacramento after all.
989853	990013	Yeah.
990033	990273	All right.
990313	992094	Anyhow, let's get back to video games.
992354	998599	So we wanted to plug Greg Proops because he's the world's oldest hipster, as I heard somebody say.
999139	1000080	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1024818	1025761	Jeez, Rob.
1026162	1026683	Hold my heart.
1027505	1029711	My ears are still ringing from that exclamation.
1029751	1030553	Call the paramedics.
1033996	1038199	Anyway, I downloaded a cute little RPG called To The Moon.
1038879	1043362	And it's very, it's actually really a sweet story so far.
1044122	1052187	But you go into the past through this guy's memories to give him the drive in his memories that would send him to the moon because that was his wish.
1052288	1055469	You basically grant dying people a wish inside their mind.
1056070	1062374	And it's not that you're changing their thoughts or anything, but you're giving them a drive towards a singular goal in their life.
1062914	1084564	and so their memories will be altered as a result of it right before they die and um it's it's really cool so far it doesn't have any combat except when you start fighting a squirrel when you're role-playing it was it was cute they're like why are you attacking the squirrel well we were role-playing stop being mean to the squirrel and the squirrel runs off um so anyway uh
1086340	1112351	it was uh i played that i've started on limbo which that game pisses me off already it's very pretty but difficult and uh i started on assassin's creed 2 but i'm not really getting into it so much i spent a lot of money on it so i don't care and um i played wow i actually did play some wow nothing happened it was boring um
1114252	1116573	I played something else and I can't remember what it was.
1116913	1118214	And it wasn't very solitaire.
1120515	1121695	You already talked about To the Moon.
1121895	1122236	Yeah.
1122816	1123236	Limbo.
1124557	1126397	Did you play that Gianna Sisters game?
1126818	1128578	No, I haven't played it.
1128858	1129459	Not this week.
1130219	1132140	There was another game that I started.
1132380	1133561	Was it Walking Dead?
1133601	1134761	No, I bought it.
1135321	1136302	But I didn't start it yet.
1137262	1141264	But the entire thing went on a Steam sale the last day of the sale.
1141904	1165793	so it was like six bucks something like that those steam sales are pretty evil in fact I was I sat down before the show started and I was like Loki tell me why I should not buy Dark Souls right now for 20 bucks the prepare to die Dark Souls edition is 20 bucks right now and he's like just get it on PlayStation 3 you can probably get it cheaper sure enough I look up on Amazon it's a whole dollar cheaper on Amazon right now yes or I could just rent it but
1167234	1171737	I can have it right this second through Steam How much would your shipping be on Amazon?
1172477	1190948	Free, because I have Prime Which, well, it's free in quotes Technically, I paid for that, but I've already paid for it So whatever I can't remember, so whatever You got an awe from DDR Dollar Bill Because he's really into Assassin's Creed 2
1192029	1193310	I have Assassin's Creed 3.
1194051	1204218	I realize a lot of you guys are very disappointed in it, but I saw one of Alan's relatives playing it on Christmas when we were over there, and the multiplayer looked really interesting to me.
1204679	1209402	It's kind of like you try to blend into this crowd that's walking around.
1209442	1215907	You're trying to stealthy kill people, but it's like kill or be killed, so you try to blend into the crowd so you don't get noticed.
1215927	1216768	It's very cat and mouse.
1217228	1218169	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1240609	1241430	Damn those Dometicis.
1241470	1242051	Too many popes.
1242872	1246116	Well, a very good Gaming Week segment.
1246477	1249421	It was that moment when DarkSakura I played stuff.
1249501	1253947	That moment when DarkSakura told me she played something other than Mass Effect and I was all like
1260213	1261453	You lost your zing.
1261653	1264454	You just need to have that as a sound clip.
1265154	1269376	Instead of this weird bitch talking to this disgusting looking heart.
1269516	1272877	Actually, now I'm more interested in the commercial than I was my original joke.
1274277	1275978	He's making out with her laptop.
1276218	1277038	That's scary.
1277178	1279519	Anyhow, rewind, take two.
1280179	1284541	That moment when DarkSakura told me she played something other than Mass Effect this week and I was all...
1289241	1289641	What?
1291742	1293563	Snake!
1294244	1295204	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1297366	1297926	It was okay.
1298006	1299267	I didn't play a whole ton of stuff.
1299587	1300548	It was mainly just...
1303530	1304511	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1322836	1323996	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1343294	1343934	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1362492	1364813	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1383438	1388339	And, uh, just to laugh and say we were on the former Faerie server, but I don't remember what server it was.
1388399	1389640	Maybe, is Shane listening?
1390160	1391940	Shane, where did we roll on Final Fantasy XI?
1392540	1393080	I need to know.
1393101	1394701	This is very important stuff.
1394881	1396701	I don't even know if it's going to help, honestly.
1396781	1399222	It's just, it's been very sparse.
1400102	1406924	It is kind of funny, though, the item I got for buying the collector's edition or whatever is fucking awesome.
1407384	1408005	Oh, the hat?
1428907	1444652	and um so that was kind of neat and then also it has auto re-raise so I literally you could just die raise yourself back up again you don't lose any experience die again and I was doing that for a while because I got attacked by a ghost and I was like oh I could take care of this thing and then
1446073	1447154	It didn't really work out that well.
1447814	1458363	But yeah, so I've been playing that, and I don't know if I will continue playing it after my free trial, because once again, it's just very lonely on that server.
1458503	1469792	And I just don't know, because I took for granted a lot of the stuff that I had done before when I first played it, like getting your airship pass, getting your sub jobs, getting your advanced jobs.
1469812	1470232	It's just...
1471033	1473256	That's a lot of time when you're not in a party.
1473476	1484191	Thanks to the wiki at FinalFantasy11sclopedia.org FFXIClopedia.org The fairy server was merged into the Sylph server.
1484271	1485533	That's the server we played on.
1486053	1486614	That makes sense.
1488256	1491178	So yeah, I've been just playing that a little bit.
1492258	1493599	I'll probably... I don't know.
1493679	1498062	I think I'm just holding on to it now because I'm hoping that it'll go free to play and there'll be a lot more people.
1499183	1499523	Hopefully.
1501444	1502645	So I'll just hold on to it for now.
1502785	1503486	And then whatever.
1503526	1503926	You know what?
1503946	1510130	So even if I get only a month out of it, $10 for Final Fantasy XI again for a month, that's nothing.
1510250	1511011	Just to have a flirt.
1511431	1513853	Sometimes it's fun to flirt with an MMO you once loved.
1514273	1516114	Yeah, I mean, it's still fun.
1516174	1517095	Hooking up once again.
1517975	1519236	I wish WoW was worth it.
1519497	1520738	Remembering the good times.
1521818	1534027	So other stuff I played, I didn't really play a whole ton of Skyrim, but I just kind of ran it to see if it'd run on my PC because, you know, I hadn't actually run it yet, even though I bought it last sale, the summer sale.
1534407	1534548	And...
1536365	1536865	Yeah, it runs.
1537025	1541727	So now I'm downloading a ton of mods for it, thanks to the Steam Workshop.
1541907	1545789	And I also purchased the first expansion for it.
1546129	1552052	I didn't purchase that Hearthfire one yet, but maybe I should.
1552072	1552452	I don't know.
1552812	1555793	It's down to like $2.49, so maybe.
1556333	1556654	We'll see.
1558900	1581421	and then uh what else today oh I got Cinemore today but I didn't play that yet um and then what else uh Borderlands 2 still playing some of that still lots of fun I'm glad they kind of got back into that and a little bit Modern Warfare 3 still rocking that and yeah that's I think that's pretty much it right now because um
1583800	1584140	I don't know.
1584741	1594767	I'm trying to go through and play some of these Steam games now that I've gotten, because I've gotten a lot of stuff from sales and the Humble Bundles and stuff, and I'm trying to go through and see, okay, which ones do I want to install, which ones am I going to play?
1595247	1599170	I'm really psyched about getting, eventually, like a Steam...
1601251	1608456	Like a PC for my TV basically that's really high end that'll have my Steam games on there and play big picture mode and stuff like that.
1608656	1610237	That's kind of what I'm gearing towards.
1610477	1618062	Kind of think of it as like the bomb shelter for the future gaming generation in case it all falls apart.
1618082	1623626	I have a fallout shelter to go to to play some older games that are still good.
1625915	1626556	My gaming week.
1627736	1631318	I'm going to dedicate my gaming week to the fact that DarkSakura is evil.
1632538	1632658	What?
1632678	1634119	In my gaming week, you're evil.
1634779	1634859	Huh?
1635020	1636820	All right, no, this is what it's really about.
1636920	1639542	Last week, you know the classic game of the week that you do every week, right?
1639562	1639682	Yes.
1639802	1646665	Last week you talked about Gyruss, and I mentioned, oh, yeah, because somebody joked in chat, like, oh, they should make an HD version of that.
1646685	1648686	And I'm like, they did, dude, like four years ago.
1649386	1650767	And it's on Xbox Live Arcade
1667392	1668554	Geometry Wars 2 Geometry Wars 2
1686175	1692996	Go look on the Xbox Live Arcade and go get Geometry Wars 2, which was seriously one of the best twin-stick shooters I think they ever put out.
1693256	1697317	The original Geometry Wars is great too, but Geometry Wars 2 has all those different modes.
1697917	1703998	But I'm trying to get this one achievement, Treaty, still to this day, driving me bonkers.
1705098	1713320	In King Mode, which is where you can only fire bullets from safe zones, you have to cross through 30 safe zones without firing a single bullet.
1714060	1715780	I can't tell you how many times I got to 29.
1717761	1719921	And I'm about ready to throw that controller at my TV.
1720061	1721201	But I haven't got it yet.
1721681	1724282	TigerClaw in chat asking, what achievement did you get?
1724562	1730463	I got the one that's called Rebound where you fire all the shots off the little bars that usually you fly your ship through and break.
1730843	1736184	But you can also fire bullets off of it, reflect it, and you kill like 75 enemies by doing that and you get an achievement.
1736204	1736804	That's the one I got.
1737524	1739925	And AlphaCanadagram agrees, Geometry Wars 2 is amazing.
1739945	1740385	Yes it is.
1741245	1741625	Very much is.
1742345	1745166	So, thank you, DarkSakura, for the amazing week in retroness.
1746127	1747887	I even played Game Room a little bit last week.
1747907	1749808	I was playing, like, Atari 2600 stuff, too.
1750208	1751149	Crazy, right?
1752269	1752649	Let's see.
1753270	1758312	In newer fangled games, I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft this week because there's been a lot going on.
1758632	1760553	I'll get into that more on Horde House this week.
1761053	1763094	But I did hit my second max level character.
1763114	1765975	I now have a level 90 Priest was my first one.
1765995	1768296	Now I have a level 90 Monk is my second one.
1768636	1770297	The new class, which is great.
1770837	1771657	So, yay!
1772738	1774779	Otherwise, not a whole lot else.
1775179	1780321	Forza Horizon, some other stuff, but nothing else to really talk in depth about.
1780962	1781502	Maybe next week.
1783583	1785184	Going to RawSteelUT.
1785264	1787765	Yeah, too bad Bazaar got fried by Blur.
1788365	1790746	Was it Blur or was it the 007 game they made?
1790786	1792146	It was probably both, unfortunately.
1792526	1798487	It really sucks that they got the plug pulled on them because Blur was not as bad as everybody made it out to be.
1798507	1801008	The 007 game is Activision's own damn fault.
1801128	1805008	Okay, they put a 007 game out before Modern Warfare 3.
1805168	1806609	I think it was Modern Warfare 3.
1807269	1808809	No, Modern Warfare 3 was Goldeneye 007.
1808849	1809209	So it was...
1812910	1823612	Black Ops, before Black Ops, come on, you really think that, they know better that it's gonna just eat, no one gives a shit about that when Black Ops is coming out the next week.
1825728	1852745	BlackWolf in chat says in new games I played World of Warcraft World of Warcraft Mists of Pandaria excuse me BlackWolf also says fuck Game Room not so much fuck Game Room but fuck Microsoft for closing Chrome Studios and ending Game Room and fuck Game Room for not being as good as it should have been and fuck the fact that we could have had this awesome retro and fuck the fucking fuckers what she said
1854306	1858169	All right, let's talk a little bit of housekeeping and then we can get into the news tonight.
1858249	1861432	And housekeeping, of course, join us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
1861732	1865555	And you can also join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1866136	1871780	I also want to give a nice plug to this other show, as I tend to do when other shows are kind enough to invite me on their show.
1873001	1875143	This show is called the Down for Maintenance Podcast.
1875643	1875984	Excuse me.
1876824	1877684	It's a newer show.
1878084	1878984	You'll have to excuse me.
1879064	1880705	I don't remember if they have a full website.
1880845	1882505	I know they are available on iTunes.
1882625	1888466	So you just search for Down for Maintenance and you can find the episode from January 5th that has me on it.
1888526	1891967	And they were very kind, very nice, asked me a lot of questions.
1892047	1896528	And I got to talk not just about video games, but they asked me a lot about how I got into podcasting.
1896568	1901549	So if you want to hear the full, long, very long, very long story, check out Down for Maintenance podcast this week.
1901989	1903989	Also, we talked about Disneyland quite extensively.
1904329	1918538	so I like the fact that we just like rambled on all these awesome topics so a good bunch there head down for me in this podcast and their Twitter Z's is the DFM podcast so you can follow them on the Twitters and I gave them a shout out on my personal Twitter feed as well
1919438	1919878	Check that out.
1921399	1922739	Did Tigerclaw find their website?
1923400	1924220	Yes, that's the name of it.
1924520	1925520	Down for Maintenance Podcast.
1925540	1927721	Sorry, I can only see part of that in the window behind me.
1928722	1929482	It's on iTunes.
1929542	1935324	And when I say it's on iTunes, that means whatever podcast-y program you're using, it's probably on there too.
1935904	1939746	So, you know, those things all spider out on the internet and find them all.
1940926	1941587	Big thanks to them.

1964442	1967904	But I don't know about you guys, but I love to go on other podcasts and just talk about.
1967924	1970406	I totally love it to all those invites I get.
1971826	1974647	Okay, Loki's begging for invites, you guys.
1975447	1976007	There you go.
1976728	1977048	All right.
1978108	1979448	Let's get into some gaming news.
1979648	1982809	Loki, wow the internet with your knowledge of what's going on in gaming right now.
1982829	1983209	Oh, please.
1983389	1985890	I don't care, really.
1985990	1989631	Anyways, so Microsoft has acquired R2 Studios.
1989831	1992532	R2 Studios happens to be the people behind...
1993152	1993593	and many more.
2012695	2035693	So, the thought is that, hmm, perhaps this is going to be rolled into some new things that they're going to incorporate into, say, the next Xbox system, or perhaps some of the stuff that we've seen in some of their kind of, I don't know if you'd really call them tech demos, but like the view of the future, I guess, you know, where they have, you know, the
2037355	2053990	PC's integrated into walls that are being projected upon and stuff like that which I think that's actually pretty awesome I'd really like to see that kind of technology but I don't know how expensive that would be but they had something similar with that where it's like kind of everything integrated into an interface that
2055376	2056557	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2070672	2071452	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2091341	2101712	even just for like a PC or something but I don't know how that would work I haven't gotten to actually see it other than in the videos so I'm not really sure how they would implement that kind of stuff
2103001	2125207	but yeah so I mean obviously if these guys are you know experts at like kind of home automation and entertainment then I would think that this kind of ties into all the rumors that we've heard about you know the kind of direction they want to go with you know the Xbox being this kind of center hub for entertainment and you know integrating it more into your life if possible I guess
2126058	2127418	Well, that's what these consoles want to be.
2127458	2130159	They don't just want to be a gaming center.
2130339	2133500	It wants to, well, it wants to be an entertainment center, I guess.
2133540	2136261	And we've already, I mean, that really shouldn't be a surprise at all.
2136301	2137762	I mean, look at the systems you've got now.
2138162	2141483	When the Xbox 360 first came out, it really didn't do a lot of that.
2141523	2145724	I mean, a little bit, like, you know, you used to be able to get like the trailers for movies.
2145744	2146985	You could download those types of things.
2147325	2153827	But now, like, it's really transformed into, you know, it does Netflix, it does streaming, it does all this other stuff.
2154407	2155947	and now it's just going to go a step further.
2156027	2160769	You know, we see what TV does on the Nintendo Wii U. That's just, you know, a hint.
2160869	2165170	That's just Nintendo's little, we're on our own little universe, you know, in their way of doing it.
2165430	2166270	Their own Miiverse?
2166670	2166890	Yes.
2166910	2174012	Well, they did have like, you know, that's, I mean, granted it's a lot more complex now, but they used to have, well, they still have it.
2174132	2179553	It's just the media center integration was one of the first things that they kind of put out there.
2179973	2187575	But I mean, that's all they really had at the time was, okay, you have the Windows XP Media Center Edition or whatever, which I had on my laptop.
2187635	2190175	My last laptop actually had that, which is kind of funny.
2191615	2195956	And occasionally I'd hit the button to go into it and, oh, hey, that's right, this is on here.
2197257	2198217	But yeah, that worked all right.
2198637	2203758	And so that's kind of like, you know, they took it to the next level and then kept going.
2204318	2206341	I want to see the further evolution of this.
2206422	2211450	I want to see what the next Xbox and the next PlayStation... I want to see what they do that my PC can't.
2211530	2212752	Yeah, I want to see something...
2213815	2214035	New.
2214215	2214835	See, that's the thing.
2214895	2217976	They need something brand new, like, oh, it projects crap onto your wall.
2218436	2222918	That's something that you can't get with what it is, you know, the technology that's out there right now.
2223098	2224078	I mean, projectors.
2224118	2225759	I just can't imagine that in my head.
2225819	2230760	That's like, I live in a planetarium, and it projects images on the wall.
2231860	2233821	But maybe I'm not thinking about it right, you know?
2234261	2239343	Maybe in my mind, I think, like, oh, that means the image of the game is going to be all around.
2239363	2240503	But maybe it's not really like that.
2241003	2251466	I don't even know if that would work feasibly, because if you look at it, not everyone's going to have walls that that would show up on, and they may not be playing in a room that's necessarily going to work.
2252406	2258128	Well, but couldn't they, through the infrared technology, be able to gauge the size of your room really quickly and adjust accordingly?
2258848	2259268	Maybe.
2259488	2259908	I don't know.
2260868	2265570	It would just be interesting to see how they would do something like that, or how they would try to figure out...
2266771	2269356	As we say here on OLR quite frequently, one step closer to the holodeck.
2278615	2300242	that's all that everything that happens in gaming takes us one step closer to the holodeck think about the progress we've made since the Atari 2600 and the Odyssey and all those first generations hell with the Atari 2600 the holodeck didn't even really exist and the next generation came out and everyone was like oh hey holodeck that's cool so yeah we've made a lot of progress
2301222	2307064	Alright, well, one thing that won't be making any more progress is sales of James Bond games on Steam.
2307805	2313107	Folks noticed over this past week that games from the James Bond franchise were taken down from Steam.
2313687	2317529	And the early rumors had people going, oh, Activision's up to something.
2318069	2320090	Activision's pulling their games from Steam.
2320450	2322310	Activision's gonna start their own origin.
2322330	2322570	No.
2324191	2326092	No, it's just the licenses.
2326232	2332597	The licensing that Activision held for these 007 games, they ran out on the new year, so that's why they were pulled down.
2332977	2337220	So they originally got the license to do James Bond games in May 2006.
2338901	2345525	The license was supposed to last until 2014, but for whatever reason it ended, I guess, a little sooner, or maybe it had something to do with...
2346185	2348268	The Digital Distribution, and so forth.
2348948	2357177	Some of the games that were affected would have been 007 Legends, which was the most recent game, Bloodstone, and so forth.
2357497	2362662	Let's be real, none of these games were particularly memorable anyway, so it's not like they're going to be missed.
2362863	2363243	Sorry.
2363723	2364224	Not sorry.
2364344	2364985	It's just the truth.
2365866	2366406	But there you go.
2366486	2366827	They are...
2368408	2368909	No longer there.
2369510	2371774	007 Goldeneye Reloaded was another one that Activision did.
2372234	2375880	Remember when they tried to make Lightning Strike twice with Goldeneye and it just didn't work out?
2376301	2377162	It's all okay.
2377222	2378304	It wasn't bad either.
2378824	2381909	I remember playing it at E3 and I was like, yep, it's Goldeneye.
2381929	2383051	It's just a little different.
2383729	2385790	I don't remember him being in here.
2385850	2387050	Where's Pierce Brosnan?
2387350	2388530	What's going on here?
2389491	2390131	So there you go.
2390171	2399393	You can no longer get the James Bond games on Steam, but I don't think that means anything bigger than whenever that next James Bond movie comes out.
2399493	2401474	And there will be another James Bond movie for sure.
2401934	2409676	That franchise might have been in question before, but after Skyfall... Isn't Skyfall now one of the largest grocery motion pictures ever?
2410396	2411858	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2427578	2428459	I haven't seen that yet.
2446778	2447238	Thanks for watching!
2465647	2466848	Actually, there's more than one Bond girl.
2466868	2467548	They're all hot.
2467609	2474213	But the one in particular I'm thinking of that he meets in Macau or wherever, like Hong Kong or wherever he's at, smoking hot.
2475094	2475354	Hot.
2476214	2476995	Hot Bond girl.
2477335	2477795	Just saying.
2477956	2480257	Way hotter than Denise Richards could ever dream of being.
2480757	2481718	Better than Grace Jones.
2483559	2489063	Grace Jones just fucking... Grace Jones will just demand your attention.
2489583	2491024	I love A View to a Kill.
2491165	2494587	It's not a great movie, but I love Grace Jones.
2496061	2497322	That woman is awesome.
2497463	2502608	I actually... It's one of those things that a lot of people don't really know about me, but I really do really like James Bond.
2502648	2503949	James Bond movies are just awesome.
2504289	2505331	So I just... Yeah.
2505471	2507373	I miss how cheesy they used to be.
2508073	2509074	The new ones are fine, though.
2509114	2511156	The new ones are great in their own way.
2511477	2514019	So I'm... They don't really interest me, to be honest.
2514340	2514560	Yeah.
2515341	2518124	Because, I mean, I like a little more...
2520178	2521939	A little less action, a little more suspense.
2521979	2525360	If you want a cheesy Bond, you need to go see Live and Let Die.
2525621	2526521	That one's great.
2527041	2528462	I've seen Live and Let Die.
2528482	2530723	It's the one that had Paul McCartney doing the opening.
2530823	2532083	Yeah, I've seen Live and Let Die.
2532584	2535705	That one's hilarious, the way the evil villain dies at the end.
2536460	2539341	So when are we going to get a sequel to If Looks Could Kill?
2542082	2542923	That was awesome.
2546124	2552907	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase GLUE.
2553267	2553747	Alright, anyhow.
2554708	2556328	After Bond, more gaming news.
2556388	2560090	DarkSakura, our very own Bond girl here on the show.
2562038	2564601	Sorry, I'm not about to run up on the beach in a white bikini with a knife.
2565983	2566965	She'll just run with a knife.
2567125	2567886	I'll just run with a knife.
2569717	2571518	I'll have like a really damp moomoo.
2573599	2582703	Anyway, there is a theory speculated that people can use the Wii U console to have extra games for free.
2583323	2590386	Basically what they're saying is that multiple players can make a separate user account on the Wii U and buy games through the Nintendo eShop.
2590426	2591987	They're linked just to the console.
2592487	2595349	and everyone who is on that console will be able to play them.
2595549	2606875	So the theory goes that you should be able to get an old one, a used Wii U and use all the games that have been downloaded on it for the users that are on there.
2607636	2610577	So that could be, I mean, it'd be kind of a hit and miss.
2610817	2613879	Oh, I'm going to get this used Wii U because all these games are going to be on it.
2613959	2614960	No, we didn't buy a damn thing.
2615560	2617621	You know, but there's that possibility.
2618281	2620803	Well, it's one way to make your Wii U look more attractive on eBay.
2620823	2621003	Yeah.
2621607	2621827	True.
2622287	2623628	I have all these games.
2623988	2624628	Buy it.
2625048	2625328	Whatever.
2625388	2625848	Added bonus.
2625888	2626088	Cool.
2626689	2627869	I didn't even think about that.
2628049	2633871	But when I heard about this, I was like, Nintendo somehow did not anticipate the used market.
2634491	2635191	What's going to happen?
2635251	2647115	Can you migrate your account from one Wii U to... Say, for example, if a bunch of people migrated their account to one Wii U and then somehow... Could you get games from multiple accounts onto one system?
2648475	2651037	I don't know if you couldn't do it without Nintendo's
2666864	2672489	There's that very real possibility you have people that own the regular 3DSs that want to buy the 3DS XL.
2672770	2674631	They have to have something to transfer.
2674932	2681098	Just like they have to have something to transfer Wii to Wii U. But what's the reality that somebody's going to buy a second Wii U?
2681558	2683760	At this point, not bloody likely.
2684741	2685722	So, I don't know.
2686109	2702380	I don't even have a first one but I didn't even think about that you're right when I sell my console on eBay now I can say loaded with all these great games but you gotta wonder if it's not something Nintendo is gonna patch out maybe they didn't they didn't have it in place this early because they didn't think people would be selling their Wii U's this fast
2703220	2707826	And by the way, I wouldn't read too much into that fact that Wii U's are already on the secondhand market.
2707886	2711872	I saw a friend on Facebook say, well, Wii U's are already on the secondhand market.
2711892	2713914	That doesn't sell, that doesn't bode well for the system.
2714455	2718921	I bet a lot of the Wii U's you're seeing on the secondhand market right now are actually promotional copies.
2719742	2723904	I bet it's a lot of people who got them early who didn't really want them in the first place.
2724484	2725485	That's where they're coming from.
2725525	2727346	We broke into GameStop.
2728186	2730307	You would have a couple, a handful.
2730347	2735410	We stole a truckload of Wii U systems and so we're selling ours off.
2735670	2739392	The Wii U's that were stolen out of the warehouse wouldn't have these games preloaded on it.
2739452	2746896	And I would think a second, especially a promo Wii is very likely to have it's going to be loaded with games on it already.
2747677	2752586	I think the only other way we use our on the second hand market right now is people, you know, desperate times call for desperate measures.
2752886	2757614	They have to sell them out of, you know, I was in a good financial place in November, but I'm not so much now.
2758316	2759358	So I'm looking at others actually.
2761735	2765057	There's actually some systems on eBay.
2765097	2771580	Well, not a whole ton, but I see one right here that's got less than 24 hours left and no bids on it at all.
2773841	2774722	You're getting tempted.
2774882	2775462	No, I'm not.
2776062	2785887	I'm honestly not getting tempted at all to buy a Wii U. I'm just curious to see if the gray market had actually dropped out that badly.
2788108	2788868	No, not yet.
2788908	2790849	What do you expect?
2790869	2796570	I would expect to see a whole ton of used systems a couple months after launch.
2796610	2797450	That doesn't make any sense.
2797550	2803131	Do you think that now that this is all over the internet, do you think this is something Nintendo is going to patch out?
2803171	2807792	Based on how you've observed the company's behavior in the past, what do you think is going to happen?
2807832	2809212	Do you think Nintendo is going to patch this out?
2809412	2810292	I don't know if they can.
2810892	2814333	Why would this be in here in the first place if it's still tied to the console?
2815153	2818855	I don't know if they are going to or not.
2820135	2824077	Regardless, again, it's buying a used system.
2824417	2831440	You're not going to have a way of knowing who has bought stuff unless you're buying your friend's Wii U and you've been there when they've bought stuff.
2831820	2833141	Oh, dude, I'll give you $150 for your Wii U. Here.
2835382	2839304	Really, Nintendo has no way of knowing that the console's been sold in the first place.
2839444	2845766	All they're seeing is someone else is creating an account, and they want to keep it so that you have multiple accounts, can use the same games.
2845806	2851669	Kind of like how the PlayStation 3 is, you know, where you can play on multiple different sign-ins.
2851729	2854370	Technically, doesn't the 360 work that same way as well?
2854590	2855070	Not exactly.
2855550	2856051	Sort of.
2856351	2857151	They sort of do.
2857231	2859613	I mean, there's limitations to what you can do there.
2859693	2861334	We cheated the system a little bit.
2861834	2863595	Here in the house, we have two Xboxes, right?
2863995	2864896	So here's what we did.
2866177	2871400	My system has the online pass tied to my Xbox account for Mass Effect 3.
2872461	2879425	So what we did is I signed into Alan's Xbox, and I also get to use the online pass because it's tied to my account.
2879725	2881006	Mass Effect 3 is two discs.
2881286	2882647	Multiplayer is on both discs.
2883467	2886670	I signed on to Alan's Xbox and it let me use my online pass.
2887031	2893577	He signed on to my Xbox and he was allowed to use my online pass because it's on that Xbox, even though he's on his account.
2893917	2898221	And we were both able to play Mass Effect 3 multiplayer without having to buy two online passes.
2898481	2902124	This elaborate fucking system to save ten whole dollars, it worked.
2902844	2904726	they're gonna send the police after you now
2925900	2927481	Oh, come and get me.
2928422	2929463	Come at me, bro.
2929643	2930003	That's right.
2930043	2930884	Come at me, bro.
2931184	2931585	Anyways.
2932025	2932345	All right.
2932545	2938270	So let's talk about more ridiculous ways to stop you from having fun and that kind of stuff.
2938750	2941232	So Sony has patented a new technology.
2941272	2945475	They'll basically tie RFID tags to a game disc.
2945575	2947277	So it'll actually be inside the disc.
2947737	2960384	and what that's supposed to do is that RFID tag will be read by the game system and will basically lock the disc to the system so that you can only play on that.
2960424	2967847	Basically think of it like an online pass for a game but without actually having to enter any codes in or something.
2967927	2974651	So it's gonna say, okay, this disc has been played on this system so we're gonna tie it to that and if you play it on another system,
2975392	2986609	Um, the thought is, okay, well, it's just going to be, um, you're either not going to be able to do that or it's going to have like some sort of limited functionality, like, you know, no multiplayer, you have to buy an online pass or something like that.
2988625	2994049	and everybody's flipping their shit going, you know, what the fuck, this is the end of the world, you know.
2995570	2997111	Ah, how are we going to stop this?
2997131	2997771	Let me put it this way.
2998291	2998712	It's like this.
2999232	3001073	If they do this, this is going to get hacked.
3001093	3005056	This is basically like giving people an excuse to hack this console.
3005636	3008618	You think that hacking on the PS3 took a long time?
3008738	3011360	Well, this shit is going to take no time because people are...
3012260	3018102	The way they see it is anti-consumerist, and so they will just go at it full bore.
3018403	3023505	If this were to really happen, Sony could kiss its ass goodbye in the console wars, honestly.
3023605	3027606	Because all Xbox would have to do is come out and say, our system doesn't do that.
3027806	3029767	You have the right to do whatever with your property.
3029867	3038090	And then it's like, Sony might be able to score more exclusives in a way, but I think the user base would absolutely reject that shit.
3038190	3039991	I just don't see it working.
3040631	3049593	Well, here's the problem, too, is if they find a way around it, all it's going to do is, once again, it's going to punish the actual legitimate buyers of that.
3049813	3051093	Here's an unpopular thought.
3051133	3053874	I don't see a lot of people going down this road.
3054894	3063655	Didn't we have rumors before that the new Xbox was going to do something like this, that it was going to have a burner in it that would tie the disks to your user ID?
3063695	3066296	Didn't this exact same rumor go around about Microsoft?
3066416	3066836	I think so.
3067616	3069337	Here's another thought, too.
3070318	3071219	Just to finish my thought, please.
3071379	3072039	Let me finish my thought.
3072079	3072579	No, that's okay.
3072900	3075401	But yes, those rumors went around before, right?
3075561	3075762	Yes.
3076022	3079064	Could this be a defensive patent by Sony then?
3079524	3081765	Sony patented it so that Microsoft can't do it.
3084907	3093753	I know we're all quick to jump to conclusions that it might be the worst-case scenario, but could it in fact be the best-case scenario?
3093773	3093813	No.
3095709	3098370	I know, I know, I'm going out on a limb.
3098450	3112795	I think the best case scenario, and this is just, I don't know if this is going to happen, but let's just say that they have a way that you can, it's basically to verify that the game disc hasn't been pirated, like you haven't, it's a legitimate copy.
3113235	3120198	Because, you know, you can burn copies of discs and stuff like that and play them in systems mainly on 360 and Wii and stuff like that, but it can be done.
3120998	3126142	Let's just say that this is to authenticate that this is a legitimate disc.
3126182	3130745	Although, I would think it would be pretty easy to snap an RFID tag on there somehow.
3130865	3133146	But let's just say that this is why they're doing it.
3133727	3138530	And then it stores that ID code or whatever in your system and ties the game to your system.
3138690	3145995	However, later on, say you want to get rid of that disc or if it's a rental or something like that, then you'd be able to revoke your privileges.
3147295	3155638	I love doing live shows.
3155758	3156338	This is why.
3156938	3160299	I didn't even think of this thought, and I think this is hitting the nail on the head.
3160559	3161679	I think this is a great comment.
3161799	3163900	Live.VogNetwork.com, our live chat room.
3164340	3166181	Dungeon Buster, gold star for you.
3166961	3167581	Here's the comment.
3168081	3177288	It might also be used in a non-gaming situation to lock down things like content disks containing code, demo materials, libraries, etc.
3177568	3181932	that will be passed on to developers or used in public spaces like convention floors.
3182352	3182972	Brilliant!
3183293	3184934	I bet that is exactly what it is.
3185294	3188456	It's not necessarily something that's going to be out there for everybody.
3188496	3189617	It's going to be on all the consoles.
3189918	3192399	But this is how they're going to prevent leaks of games.
3193300	3219794	because when they put out all the promotional materials and so forth and all the promo discs those are going to be tied to the accounts of the people that are reviewing them that's probably what it's really about and think about it Sony is also a motion picture studio which means they sent out screener blu-rays for the Oscars and all that stuff they want to lock that shit down too I think that's a brilliant thought what this could be this may not be for everybody this could be for a promotional case only
3220114	3235535	because if something like this only affects people that are using promotional devices and so forth, you stop the day zero leaks this way and people aren't as apt to hack it because it's affecting people that don't really have these consoles or that aren't the hackers in the first place.
3235555	3237976	Yeah, but here's the problem with that, though, is that that wouldn't work.
3238336	3244780	If it's going to be a standard Blu-ray with the RFID tag inside there, if you have a device that doesn't read the RFID tag, there's no way to lock it out.
3244860	3246400	It's just going to read it as a disc.
3246561	3250683	It's not going to go, oh, hey, I'm not going to play this because there's non-RFID code.
3250903	3251943	No, it's a Blu-ray disc.
3252063	3252944	It's just going to read it.
3254004	3257647	That would only work on a console or something where it has the technology in place to do that.
3257787	3259288	Who said the reader wouldn't be in there?
3259569	3261710	There's a difference between putting it in there and using it.
3261810	3265934	Maybe what it's looking for is that the general games would just have an open tag.
3265974	3268596	It's not going to be tied because they know it would be the kiss of death.
3268636	3269096	No, no, no.
3269496	3270277	I'm not talking about that.
3270337	3276402	I'm talking about if you're looking at a scenario where you're trying to prevent piracy with these movie leaks or something like that.
3277162	3281365	Your standard Blu-ray drive is not going to read that RFID tag, so it's going to mean nothing to it.
3281425	3284666	It's going to pretend it's not even there, and so that's not going to work.
3284867	3288209	Unless they come out with a whole new disc format that's going to do this.
3288249	3288629	Why not?
3289890	3290850	And Sony could do that.
3290950	3291350	Why not?
3291891	3302197	If you're talking about Oscar screeners and things that they want to put the clamp down on, it would not be unheard of for Sony to send everybody a new Blu-ray player.
3302797	3307202	It doesn't matter, you incorporate it into a console, you incorporate it into a disk drive, it's going to get hacked.
3307282	3309905	It's just going to get hacked.
3309965	3312588	It's going to be a target, so why even bother?
3313089	3315732	SSJ100Matt in chat says, True, I'm not saying this will necessarily prevent it from happening.
3322499	3344170	but it's all about stopping those day zero leaks that is what they hate the most because where are the most sales of games in the first week so the the better they can plug or delay the inevitable leak or hack or whatever the better they can delay that the more that game's gonna sell that's the reality so anyhow
3347028	3347468	Just a thought.
3348209	3349870	I thought that was a great thought from our chat room.
3350370	3356255	Live.VogNetwork.com And again, maybe in some ways I'm thinking best case scenario.
3356335	3358056	I think that would be a smart thing to do.
3358096	3360138	But let's look at it this way also.
3360218	3361398	I don't think that's how they're going to use it.
3361459	3363340	I think they're going to lock down game content.
3363360	3368384	I mean, they're the only first party that has online passes for their fucking games.
3368544	3371166	If they do it and Microsoft doesn't,
3371886	3373468	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3394949	3396149	They find other ways to do it.
3396609	3398690	Forza Horizon last week we were talking about.
3398750	3400410	They find other ways to nickel and dime you.
3400430	3403031	Really, that $10 is not fucking financing a goddamn network.
3403091	3407472	It's just financing them bitching about, oh, we don't get enough money.
3407672	3412053	You really think that $10 goes to the developer or that $10 goes to rain those servers?
3412193	3413673	It does not fucking go to them.
3413893	3417594	No, look at the games that have already been shut down that use those passes.
3418134	3418975	It doesn't go to shit.
3419115	3421275	It just goes to line their pockets even more.
3421475	3424456	It's $10 more they made because you bought the game used.
3424838	3428961	All right, well, moving on to hacking and so forth.
3429501	3437026	Big progress made, according to the gaming blogs and the gaming news sites this week, on hacking Nintendo's 3DS handheld.
3438027	3441409	Hacker Nemod, I hope I didn't say that wrong, but that's the name.
3441469	3446252	Nemod says that he got full control of the 3DS via a kernel mode.
3447053	3451596	One of the benefits, now the 3DS could potentially be region-free through this hack.
3451676	3454578	So you could run a Japanese, because as you know, the 3DS is region-locked.
3454878	3456159	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3476812	3505759	Nintendo of course I wouldn't expect them to sit down quietly for this I'm sure there would be a patch as soon as they can figure out how he did it that will patch it out but you could always not get said patch and possibly hack the system well the other thing too is you could lock out that update because you have full control of kernels so you just say okay you're not going to download and also the updates don't download automatically you have to accept those updates and so it'd be easy to hack that
3506656	3507637	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3524830	3527895	Well, um, the mutant mud story, right?
3528476	3528636	Mm-hmm.
3529076	3534404	Yeah, with that one, um, there was a comment made by the developer for mutant muds in Dementium.
3534444	3537328	His name is, uh, I'm hoping I'm pronouncing it right.
3537388	3540673	Is that Jules Watsham or Jules?
3541374	3552238	It's with a J. Anyway, he had concerns about piracy on the 3DS saying that if piracy gets bad, then, I'm just paraphrasing, they have no choice but to stop supporting the platform with new games.
3553098	3558980	And he goes on to say that some people say that piracy leads to more game sales, claiming it enables players to try before they buy.
3559360	3559740	Bullshit.
3561001	3589284	and a lot of people looked at it as an attack on Nintendo so he went back in and said that he's always supported it that he loves Nintendo and the 3DS but all he's saying is that if piracy gets bad on the 3DS they can't put out new games and it's not that he's taking a stand on piracy but it's more of a business action to develop games so that they can I guess save their money it'd be a business decision right
3589965	3590994	But I mean, honestly...
3593061	3598506	I really don't think that it's going to be that much of a factor in affecting the business.
3598846	3600988	The people who want it bad enough are still going to buy it.
3602129	3605311	The people who want to steal it bad enough are still going to steal it.
3605331	3606432	They're going to find a way, yeah.
3607053	3614900	And honestly, there's been a couple of times where I've sampled something and have gone out and bought it.
3615140	3616701	I think it's how a lot of people are.
3616761	3618483	I've done that with music a bunch of times.
3618503	3620925	I'll hear somebody on YouTube and I'll go buy the album.
3621513	3622894	Yeah, I do that with music a lot too.
3622974	3625836	To the industry's credit though, they've made it very easy.
3626017	3630080	I think they kind of figured out a way to combat it with things like Spotify.
3630260	3639927	Spotify makes it very easy to sample things very hassle-free and make a legal decision from there if you want or what have you.
3639968	3641409	Or you can still do it illegally if you want.
3641429	3650656	But I think the music industry is finally figuring out ways to embrace the fact that there are people that want to try it for nothing and then maybe will pay if it's good enough.
3651021	3658488	Well, one thing that he did say, and this is something we've been saying for ages, is that he doesn't think there's a solution to piracy, that it will always exist.
3658889	3659529	This is what he said.
3659729	3661791	I accept that piracy will exist on the 3DS.
3662352	3665175	The question is, how much is it affecting the market?
3665235	3668158	Some markets maintain a healthy business environment alongside piracy.
3668658	3673102	I believe this is due to many factors, not the least of which is the service provided in that market.
3674143	3674364	So...
3676289	3677049	I get what he's saying.
3677069	3683496	He's basically saying if it's just going to be open season and everybody's stealing shit back and forth on a 3DS, what's the value in me putting my game out on it?
3683796	3684136	Exactly.
3684176	3688901	Which is what the PlayStation 4 might turn into if this ends up being worst case scenario, what we talked about earlier.
3689201	3694506	Well, he did say that there's going to be a sequel to Mutant Muds and it will be an eShop release.
3695627	3695888	Okay.
3696148	3696308	Yeah.
3696708	3697169	There you go.
3699111	3699431	All right.
3701032	3703072	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
3703553	3704773	Mutant Muds might not be out.
3705373	3706674	Well, there's something else that was occurring to me.
3706914	3707414	Oh, sure.
3708514	3720278	I mean, maybe that is why there's a lot more people leaning towards digital distribution and having a key attached to it so that they can verify IP where it's downloaded.
3721519	3723059	I mean, I understand why they're doing it.
3723659	3728401	It seems with a physical copy, there's a lot more potential to crack what's there.
3729662	3729922	All right.
3731023	3738109	Mutant Muds might not be a new game this week, so let's travel around the world and see what is new this week as we check out the release dates, which might be thin.
3738710	3739650	Yeah, still thin.
3740071	3740711	Not much this week.
3741372	3752101	Thankfully, Anarchy Reigns is finally making its way out over here in North America on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and then The Sims 3 gets yet another expansion with The Sims 3 Monta Vista.
3754000	3754941	Yeah, so that's it.
3756242	3761184	Yeah, traveling to Japan, again, looks like things are kind of on a hiatus right now until a little later in the month.
3761824	3764446	There's really not a lot to look for in Japan right now.
3765286	3772790	I'm just looking at the different consoles just to make sure, but I don't see anything on the Xbox 360 or the PlayStation 3, 3DS, none of that.
3772850	3776012	Looks like we're on break until mid-January, so play what you've got.
3777132	3778353	DarkSakra, how about UK?
3778493	3779433	Hey, there's Steam, you know.
3780454	3782835	On the 11th of January, we have... Do they have Steam in Japan?
3784409	3785070	I think so.
3785810	3788312	I wouldn't see why not, but everything would have to be licensed for that reason.
3790134	3792876	On January 11th, Anarchy Reigns and Ninja Gaiden 3.
3795057	3795318	Alrighty.
3795338	3795778	That's it.
3796218	3799981	Just a couple more news stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week.
3800141	3800682	But first...
3801030	3818545	So THQ had arranged, I want to say it was last week, maybe even earlier this week, arranged a sale that tied in with their bankruptcy protection that they did to sell off their assets to, I want to say it was, what's the company, Clear Lake Capital Group.
3819145	3821608	And basically the plan, the way they put it out,
3822708	3838915	They were going to do this quick sale and this Clear Lake Capital group was going to take ownership of all that stuff and I guess that they were still going to be able to complete their games and all their IPs would kind of remain their own and it would kind of wipe out the debt that they had.
3839515	3861416	However, the people that they owe money to weren't exactly happy about the fact that, hey, their debt's going to be wiped out, and they're not going to get paid for the stuff that they owed money for, and that they're kind of trying to do this really quick sale without getting any further bids on the company.
3861497	3861757	Yeah.
3864267	3874114	What they're basically doing now is they actually have some different people interested into these IPs.
3874554	3881559	So including Warner Games is actually looking to possibly buy some of their IPs.
3882259	3889964	And they were saying that I guess the whole objection came from the...
3895342	3919678	Rather than being designed to maximize the value of the debtor's estates, the bidding procedures, by design or otherwise, render the auction process meaningless and virtually guarantee that Clearlake will be the ultimate buyer, thereby ensuring that the debtor's management retain their positions within and the operating control over the debtor's organization.
3921789	3929618	So it sounds like the whole thing was rigged, but now they're throwing a monkey wrench into it now that they've objected to the quick sale.
3930699	3932481	So what do you think this ultimately means, Loki?
3932521	3938047	Does this mean THQ is going to be nothing but Saints Row and Darksiders getting sold to somebody else?
3938728	3941011	Or what does this mean for the future, you think?
3941491	3941851	Don't know.
3942011	3945714	I mean, we'll have to see who bids on what or what happens.
3947055	3965987	It's kind of ballsy to think that they were going to organize this whole thing to just kind of... I mean, obviously they want to put themselves in a better position, but it's very risky to just kind of put yourselves out there for sale and then rely on one company to buy you without expecting anyone else to not...
3967347	3973909	It's kind of like you've arranged the buyer.
3974129	3975109	Okay, I'll tell you what.
3975369	3978910	We're going to get this clear late capital group to come in.
3979730	3986692	We told them that we're going to do this, and we're going to have the window open for five minutes for anybody else that wants to walk in and possibly place a bid.
3987312	3987372	Go.
3988846	3989506	Oh, no one's here.
3989826	3991807	Oh, I guess I just ran to sell you guys.
3991827	3995828	You know, it's just very... I don't know.
3996248	3996548	Shady?
3996928	3997148	Yes.
3997388	3997628	All right.
3997768	3998148	Fair enough.
3998869	4007971	Before I get into another news story here, just to go back to another topic before our chatters talking about Steam in Japan, Actdeft says, Rob, there is Steam in Japan.
4008491	4010572	And I was like, okay, does that mean there's different games?
4010892	4015074	RawSteelUT at live.vognetwork.com says, Rob, I imagine there's some differences.
4015814	4020336	Since Activision isn't in Japan, they probably have to wait for Square Enix to put out Call of Duty, for example.
4020756	4024578	So we don't know all the specifics, but there is Steam in Japan.
4025778	4026298	Which makes sense.
4026358	4030180	Actdeft, I know he's in Mexico, so he gets his Steam games through.
4031280	4037503	I'm pretty sure it's the same Steam that we're using here in the U.S., but it does demonstrate that Steam is available in other countries.
4037863	4040604	So I don't see why there wouldn't be a Steam in Japan.
4040964	4041805	Makes a lot of sense to me.
4042825	4043105	All right.
4043525	4046846	Well, something that's going to be right here in the U.S., maybe.
4048606	4055608	A new project from Namco, which sounds awesome to me, experimenting with a project called Level 256.
4057328	4069591	Level 256, by the way, is the very last stage in Pac-Man before you get the kiss of death, which is appropriate because this is a Namco project, talking about high-end food and entertainment all in one place.
4070051	4080775	They're talking about a prototype maybe in Chicago that could possibly become this chain that would have pool, shuffleboard, video games, and other types of immersive attractions.
4081476	4084397	A quote from the CEO of Namco Entertainment, David Bishop.
4084737	4084957	Quote,
4099063	4102847	So it's basically going to be Dave & Buster's in many ways.
4103027	4103367	Who knows?
4103407	4103667	Who knows?
4103687	4104828	It could be more upscale.
4104848	4105129	Who knows?
4106270	4107451	Sounds good to me.
4108091	4112896	You know, Namco still pumps out machines that show up in the arcades, all types of machines.
4113296	4114717	Namco does Flame & Finger.
4114998	4116679	That's one of my favorite Dave & Buster's games.
4116759	4118521	I am the master at Flame & Finger.
4118561	4119322	I hit the jackpot.
4119422	4119762	I don't know.
4119802	4124786	I'd be more excited if it was Tecmo doing an upscale entertainment business.
4125507	4127208	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4155630	4157191	Oh yeah, John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza.
4157491	4159171	But that's more for kids.
4160612	4162232	They have a roller coaster, so they count.
4162372	4163193	I like pizza.
4163233	4164233	I like arcade games.
4167514	4170135	Why don't you just open up a place that has pizza and arcade games?
4170175	4171295	Why do we have to complicate it?
4171535	4172916	Hey, Codeman, I used to work for Namco.
4174757	4175337	In an arcade.
4175557	4178498	WhatUpG in chat says, Namco is also doing work on Smash.
4178538	4179638	An arcade version of Smash?
4179798	4180118	Yes, please.
4186044	4190647	Namco also did the whole F-Zero AX.
4191368	4194390	Remember that was the Triforce between them, Sega, Nintendo?
4195271	4196431	Awesome arcade machine.
4196772	4197072	Yeah.
4197092	4200114	What about the Mario Kart arcade that had Pac-Man?
4201055	4201375	Mm-hmm.
4201495	4202956	That was Namco too, yeah.
4203016	4205998	Ranma does confirm in chat, Jillian's was sold to Dave & Buster's and converted.
4206339	4206799	That's what I thought.
4208612	4208892	DarkSakura.com
4239082	4242343	She will find a game that she thinks, hey, play this now.
4242744	4244084	DarkSakura, what is the classic of the week?
4244624	4246365	The classic game is Ninja Warriors.
4247606	4249807	And I'm not talking about the arcade version from 1988.
4251187	4256170	I'm talking about the SNES one, which in Japan was called the Ninja Warriors again.
4257370	4261332	And in Europe it was Ninja Warriors The New Generation.
4262032	4265734	It's a beat-em-up that was developed by Natsume before they went all, you know...
4266874	4294282	Harvest Moon Harvest Moon on us and when they used to release games it kicked ass and it was released by Taito it came out for the SNES in 1994 and it is indeed a remake of the 1988 arcade game The Ninja Warriors it's set in a in the future the population has been oppressed by the military and brainwashed so these androids are going out to save everybody
4296997	4299939	So, um, it is a side-scrolling beat-em-up.
4300139	4305663	It's very similar to, uh, Shinobi or, like, Bad Dudes, but it's in widescreen format.
4306284	4309366	You can be, um, the strong ninja.
4310067	4311328	You can be the Kunoichi.
4311468	4315671	You can be, um, Kamaitachi.
4316331	4317292	Those are the three characters.
4318723	4325430	Each of them has their own set of moves, different attacks, jumping attacks, throws, different defense positions, and power moves.
4326651	4334119	So the game is actually really good, but the only bad, I'd say, drawback to it is that it's only single player.
4334219	4335400	You don't have a co-op mode.
4338305	4341267	I mean, I would love this game if there was a co-op mode in it.
4341447	4344069	But, you know, I always used the Kanoichi when I played it.
4344509	4345289	It was a fun little game.
4345370	4348431	I remember the issue of EGM that they advertised this in.
4349652	4352114	And I was like, I must have this game.
4352554	4354715	What did SushiX have to say about this game?
4355196	4356857	It got a 90% in GamePro.
4357077	4357397	Okay.
4357797	4359298	I'll tell you that.
4359318	4363361	82% by EGM, with it saying, this is the best side-scrolling fighting game yet.
4365714	4366695	Final Fight Guy Final Fight 3
4383277	4385159	So I don't have really a whole lot to say about it.
4385759	4389502	I mean, it is side-scrolling fighter, but it's a fun game.
4389703	4394607	And you can probably find this pretty inexpensively at your local used store.
4395668	4396188	So get it.
4396248	4397850	Remember when Natsume made awesome games.
4400492	4401493	Not a fan of tulips?
4402093	4404115	Tulip was funny, but that's silly.
4404135	4404455	Bye.
4405740	4410145	Alright, your classic game of the week, Ninja Warriors on the Super Nintendo.
4410205	4413129	This is a rare case of DarkSakura's endorsing the remake.
4414733	4415153	You know what?
4415213	4416494	I played a crap ton of this game.
4416615	4419837	Because, yes, we had remakes on the Super Nintendo, and a lot of them were awesome.
4420297	4421959	For example, Super Mario All-Stars.
4422559	4422859	Awesome.
4423880	4426062	Where we actually could play the real Super Mario Bros.
4426242	4426062	2.
4426742	4427062	Amen.
4427323	4429724	But this game had, like, explosions and shit going on.
4430225	4431926	And I think her hair was a weapon.
4431946	4432366	The Kunoichi.
4432387	4436770	And she just threw a whole tank of cocaine at somebody.
4436790	4437771	Well, she's also an android now.
4442771	4443932	I want my hair to be a weapon.
4444132	4445533	There it is, your classic game.
4445553	4447414	My hair practically is a weapon if I let it grow.
4449135	4453738	All right, we're going to take a break here at OLR Studios, but we'll be back with more gaming news.
4453758	4455259	We've got some rapid-fire news coming up.
4455299	4458221	The Fugle Question of the Week should be a fun one this week.
4458501	4465545	And as announced in the opening of tonight's show, could playing MMOs make you more attractive to job seekers?
4467612	4468193	Port please.
4468373	4469473	Port prompt please.
4471595	4473136	Yes, on my resume.
4473296	4477698	I gave over 1,500 ports to Prontera in the 2011 fiscal year.
4478219	4479039	All right.
4479079	4481121	We'll be back after this with more of Orange Launch Radio.
4481181	4482622	Don't go anywhere, guys.
4482702	4483122	Stay tuned.
4489218	4492119	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4492199	4503503	We are live with our 488th episode on this January the 6th of 2013, live at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, as we are every Sunday night.
4504263	4508405	Live during the break tonight, they heard some music from Street Fighter X Mega Man.
4508965	4511286	We can't play that stuff during the podcast, but...
4511946	4517310	If you want to kind of like experience what it was like to be here live, you can check out the soundtrack for yourself.
4517710	4518951	It's a pay what you want thing.
4518991	4522573	So you can put zero, but DarkSakura, you say pay something.
4522913	4523154	Do it.
4523254	4524775	Seriously, the guy put a lot of work into it.
4524895	4525595	It is good music.
4525715	4527016	He did it for the community.
4527837	4529138	So just pay something.
4529318	4530318	Anyone can afford a dollar.
4530799	4535962	Rivalrivalrival.bandcamp.com is the website where you can get that.
4536002	4538804	And technically it's like slash albums, but just go to Rivalrivalrival.
4539064	4539945	And that's all his music.
4540425	4540885	Good times.
4541206	4541566	Good times.
4542546	4544407	Allen's back from work earlier than expected.
4544447	4544968	Hi, Allen.
4545468	4546488	How was your gaming week?
4546568	4547909	Did you play a lot of good games this week?
4548309	4548850	What did you play?
4550671	4552231	He's not going to yell across the room.
4552832	4554973	How much did the Steam sale damage your wallet?
4555636	4558698	How about we wait until he can actually get on the microphone to ask him these questions?
4558738	4559818	Just a quick question.
4562720	4564120	How much does Steam Sale damage your wallet?
4564280	4571604	I would say I was able to keep the Steam Holiday Sale in check for, I want to say, $35 or less, which is really good.
4571664	4573625	You did worse than me, though, if you spent that much money.
4573705	4575045	Have you played Torchlight 2 yet?
4575446	4576026	I installed it.
4576406	4578387	Okay, that's the first step.
4578587	4579027	There you go.
4580128	4580888	I did spend more.
4580968	4582869	I bought Hearthfire during their break.
4583849	4583989	It's $2.50.
4584109	4588591	Wait a minute, you talked me out of buying Dark Souls and now you bought stuff.
4588611	4595835	Well, it's because some of the mods I had required Hearthfire, so I wanted to install that so I can install those mods.
4596955	4597295	All right.
4598817	4602540	Alan also and I celebrated three years on Friday.
4602680	4604421	So congratulations, Alan.
4605202	4605742	Gross.
4606323	4608204	Squish, squish, barf.
4608244	4608524	All right.
4608564	4616230	But no, the reason why I bring that up is that we got to do dinner at Ruth Chris Steakhouse because I had won a gift card through work.
4617251	4617712	Oh, my God.
4617752	4618092	Steak.
4619093	4619493	Nom.
4619773	4620494	It was so good.
4620934	4622395	Have you ever had a Ruth Chris, Loki?
4623095	4624096	No, I haven't.
4624356	4628718	We saw that when we went to the mall the other day, but no, I haven't been there.
4628738	4631920	You need to go to a fancy... Even if it's not like Morton's or one of those fancy steakhouses.
4632020	4635161	No, I like... Was it the Daily Grill?
4636922	4639784	The nearest one that was in Modesto or San Francisco, so it's like...
4641118	4644542	I really wish they had one here because, oh, it's so good.
4644582	4645543	Their peppercorn steak.
4646284	4651069	I should actually, you know what, I should say something nice publicly about Ruth Chris and the whole experience.
4651109	4657836	And I'm okay endorsing them because they were, you know, when we originally made the reservations, we didn't really put that anything special was going on.
4657856	4661099	But as we were being seated, the gal asked, you know, are you celebrating anything?
4661159	4661520	And, you know...
4662100	4664063	I just went ahead and said that.
4679421	4708117	and they were like totally respectful and awesome and the waitress like even put roses on our table and everybody from like the the busser that came by to the other waitresses would like actually come by and say hey happy anniversary you guys and you know would ask those questions like how long and so forth and I just like I it was just they it was an awesome experience and I was I was so happy with that so I should give them publicly props so if you have a lot of money to spend on an expensive steak it's a great steak I'm not gonna lie
4708597	4718723	What I was trying to say earlier is that one of my exes worked at Ruth's Chris and their steak knives are excellent to buy.
4719543	4721264	No, you can actually buy the set of their steak knives.
4721484	4722125	They're really nice.
4723285	4724886	But I used to get food free from there all the time.
4726227	4727208	Oh, lucky lady.
4727408	4731130	Just take out stuff, you know, stuff that had been set back or...
4732569	4737394	Well, I mean, I understand you were in a different situation where you got takeout, but you don't get takeout from Ruth Chris.
4737494	4740717	No, but some of the servers could take dinner home.
4740858	4742459	Sure, like if a steak was overcooked or something.
4742479	4749948	Yeah, and, you know, so it was, I never ate in the restaurant, but I've had plenty of stuff from there.
4750849	4751449	So it was good food.
4751469	4751970	Okay.
4752270	4752570	Awesome!
4753250	4753730	Alright, anyhow.
4754951	4760373	Oh, you guys are making me hungry for yet another buttery, delicious steak, but we have more gaming news to cover.
4760413	4761253	Buttery steak?
4761593	4762453	No, that sounds gross.
4762473	4767095	There's actually a place down in Sacramento that I just saw that's called Butter and Bacon.
4770176	4774220	My friends, I do brunch almost every Sunday with a group of friends.
4774340	4777623	And they all went there and they said it's really good, but it's a long wait.
4778083	4778904	We missed that week.
4778944	4780025	We were doing something else that Sunday.
4780065	4780546	We didn't go.
4781086	4782327	We went to Poor House today.
4782547	4785550	My sister was telling me that they're doing Bacon Fest 2 down there.
4788052	4791876	Somebody was asking you earlier, and I don't know who it was in chat.
4791916	4792576	I'm sorry, chatter.
4792596	4795539	But somebody was asking you about if you've seen the show The United States of Bacon.
4796033	4796613	No, I haven't.
4796913	4798234	I guess that's a thing.
4798754	4799415	Who knew it was a thing?
4799435	4799955	But it's a thing.
4802336	4802636	All right.
4803156	4805097	All right.
4805597	4806538	Very nice comment.
4806558	4808679	Thank you from SSJ100 Matt in our chat room.
4808739	4812781	The rest of the country could learn from a steakhouse treating everyone like the same human being.
4813421	4814421	I could not agree more.
4814501	4819944	But I'm thankful that the people that participate with this show like, you know, whatever, you know.
4821104	4821404	Awesome.
4822165	4824506	Anyhow, let's get into some rapid-fire news.
4824566	4826766	Back to gaming, the thing we all enjoy when we're not eating.
4827387	4827727	Loki.
4827987	4841072	So, Lego, even though they haven't really run out of properties to make things out of, I mean, they did create that Ninjago or whatever that is, and I don't still understand that, but they have that series now.
4841172	4848855	So now they have this new Lego Legends of Kima, and it's some sort of, looks like a mythical...
4850822	4851803	Legends of Kaima Speedzores
4866121	4867382	Way to make up words.
4867943	4873248	It's a racing minigame that's on LEGO.com and on iOS.
4873548	4878753	Then they're going to have LEGO Legends of Kima Levels Journey.
4878973	4883017	That's coming to 3DS and Vita, and I guess the DS later on.
4883477	4885899	And then LEGO Legends of Kima Online.
4886420	4888862	That's going to be a free-to-play online world.
4891405	4915332	so neat I guess it's weird it looks very like fantasy mythical stuff like they have like this looks like a lion headed warrior with this sword that's all lightning and stuff and he's throwing a magic ball and this like angel hawk headed guy I don't know it's funky looking but I'm sure the toys will be cool
4915906	4921110	RossDLUT in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, We've outgrown crappy kids toys, Loki.
4921130	4922251	We'll never get this shit.
4922632	4923632	Bite your tongue, sir.
4924293	4926435	There are tons of people that are into those Lego games.
4926535	4928116	There's tons of adults that are into Legos.
4928336	4929577	No, I don't have a problem with Legos.
4929597	4930678	I still get Legos.
4930698	4934181	I don't get the Lego franchises that Lego themselves have built.
4934621	4934821	Like...
4936002	4936702	Like, what did they have?
4936742	4943544	They had that whole Lego... Well, the Ninjago stuff doesn't make any... I mean, it's ninjas, I understand that, but it's just kind of beyond that.
4943644	4946464	I don't really know the lore and crap with that.
4946864	4950325	And then they also had the... What the fuck was it?
4950365	4957687	They had some other Lego series that looked like these weird Mayan robot things or something.
4957707	4962788	It was like the Technic toys that they turned and made weird characters out of, and it was just weird.
4963288	4964568	Technica or something like that.
4964588	4967109	I don't know if it was Technica, but it was something weird like that.
4967329	4967789	And then this.
4967870	4969110	This doesn't make any sense to me.
4970110	4972811	It's just all these made-up words and shit.
4972851	4975792	I don't know who these people are.
4975812	4979433	I can understand you know Lego, Lord of the Rings, and that kind of crap.
4979453	4980213	That makes sense.
4980233	4981534	The toys make sense, but...
4982154	4983236	I don't know.
4983276	4985139	For me, it'd be hard to get into this.
4985319	4991929	I guess the reason they're doing this is probably because how they did the Lego Lord of the Rings, but there's not really another Lord of the Rings coming.
4991949	4996496	I mean, I guess there is next year, but the Lord of the Rings stuff, there's a Hobbit movie.
4996516	4997918	Technically, it's The Hobbit.
4998098	4999719	Well, they're still lumping it all in there.
4999759	5005041	I mean, they're not going to do Lego Lord of the Rings 2, The Hobbit, which is really what it's going to be probably for a couple of years.
5005061	5008182	So they're going to come out with something in the meantime for next year.
5008762	5009883	And this is what it's going to be there.
5009903	5011984	The Lego game that's three hours of nothing.
5012184	5012904	They're going to do Lego.
5012944	5013264	I don't know.
5018973	5021275	Disney owns Star Wars now, there's gonna be more Star Wars in the future
5039609	5041131	What about Lego Hunger Games?
5041932	5043033	No, that's not going to happen.
5043373	5045235	What other movie franchises could become Lego games?
5045255	5048438	Well, they have Lego Prince of Persia, which they could do something with.
5048458	5049560	They have the rights to that.
5049620	5050440	Lego Avengers?
5051041	5052242	Is this game guru in our chat room?
5052543	5053664	No, Avengers.
5053724	5055926	Remember, Avengers are Mega Bloks.
5056026	5057508	I want Lego Hunger Games.
5057848	5058348	Or Cubic.
5058409	5059149	I'm a genius.
5059530	5060511	That would be a great game.
5061231	5062533	Wouldn't you play Lego Hunger Games?
5062933	5063093	No.
5064195	5064535	Wouldn't you?
5064875	5065797	I don't like the LEGO games.
5065857	5070642	If you want to play LEGO Hunger Games, there's the Hunger Games things that you can run on Minecraft.
5070662	5071984	That's as close as you can get.
5072084	5074447	May the odds never be in your favor.
5075708	5077871	Odds are you're paying too much for this LEGO set.
5080171	5086155	All right, and then there's another game that's being released, I guess.
5087336	5102867	It was unfinished, and it was a version of the game Faceball, but it was called Niko-chan Battle in Japan, and it was for the ever-successful portable console Virtual Boy, you know, the monochrome red.
5103828	5104889	You mean the migraine machine.
5105779	5106760	He has the migraine machine.
5107380	5108161	And guess what?
5108361	5112443	If you're looking for a reproduction cartridge of the Virtual Boy game, you can get it.
5112523	5113884	It's going to be released in February for $100.
5115325	5117126	Or you can get the ROM for free.
5119327	5120788	Well, I like free.
5121049	5122189	But you know what would be kind of cool?
5122369	5125271	And this is kind of tying back into the story with the whole homebrew stuff.
5125371	5126252	Wouldn't it be awesome?
5126392	5128893	And I don't know why Nintendo hasn't done this already.
5129174	5133917	Wouldn't it be awesome if they released Virtual Boy games on the virtual console for...
5135517	5139379	The 3DS because it's in 3D and it has virtual in the name already?
5139459	5140939	That makes too much sense.
5141299	5142760	We're not gonna do that.
5143540	5146021	Well, plus, doesn't Nintendo kind of want to distance themselves from that?
5146141	5148282	Why?
5149062	5149982	Might as well embrace it.
5151743	5154004	They did it for a while, so...
5154544	5155865	I love the chatters, by the way.
5155945	5158906	Now they're just shouting out all these random-ass LEGO games.
5159526	5161807	Seg says, LEGO Cards Against Humanity.
5162327	5163668	That's how I spent my New Year's Eve, by the way.
5164729	5167009	WhatUpG, LEGO Street Fighter X Mega Man.
5167770	5168630	Degenerate Johnny.
5169350	5171011	This could be a thing, Degenerate Johnny.
5171111	5172012	LEGO Doctor Who.
5172232	5172852	I could see that.
5173852	5174433	I could see that.
5174573	5177594	Why not tap into what the big fandom's like?
5178114	5179715	LEGO Merlin, LEGO Sherlock.
5179775	5180175	Why not?
5181136	5181816	LEGO BBC.
5185231	5186251	No Lego Sherlock, please.
5187652	5189373	I am perfectly happy with just the show.
5205859	5206920	and that's what happened this week.
5207301	5210724	The Xbox Cloud wasn't available to some people.
5211325	5217051	Very interesting because only certain people were unable to access it for a certain time but that's how the internet works sometimes.
5218072	5226941	They ended up giving a one month free of Xbox Live to those that were unable to get their cloud games available.
5227081	5227242	So...
5227922	5233443	This probably also ties into, you know, Netflix was down on Christmas Eve for a lot of people, which drove them batty.
5233903	5236764	And apparently, like, someone at Amazon had pushed the wrong button.
5236784	5240485	Like, Amazon actually fessed up and kind of apologized to Netflix, which I thought was interesting.
5240745	5241925	Yeah, we didn't do that on purpose.
5242405	5242565	Yeah.
5242585	5245326	We don't have a competing video streaming service or anything.
5245546	5247106	So someone made the cloud disappear.
5247226	5251247	And so if that's where your Xbox save files were, you might not have been happy.
5252208	5261899	In other very interesting news, a father in China decided to treat his son's internet addiction to an internet game.
5261919	5264362	I don't know what game this was, but he did it in a very interesting way.
5264902	5266925	He hired an online hitman...
5268652	5269953	to take out his son.
5272054	5272614	Oh my gosh.
5272995	5275736	Apparently he was getting bad grades in school because of the gaming habit.
5275996	5277077	He couldn't land a job.
5277117	5278998	He couldn't get any work or whatever.
5279438	5284882	And the father was very annoyed that he didn't take the job at the software development company or whatever.
5284902	5287723	I mean, these are problems a lot of people go through or what have you.
5288123	5295308	So the father hired games or hired players in the son's favorite games to hunt down the kid.
5296148	5301913	and we don't know how he did it or whatever but I imagine I could just see the post on like World of Warcraft forums.
5302353	5303374	Please kill my child.
5307260	5310641	Yeah, we have a problem with... We'll pay 5,000 G for hit.
5311202	5312462	It's creative.
5313102	5313562	I don't know.
5314162	5319444	So anyway, now this is the part where I start to wonder if the story's fake because it has a happy ending.
5319844	5325006	But the child stuck up to his dad and said, I can play or I cannot play.
5325066	5325926	It doesn't bother me.
5326406	5328007	I'm not looking for any job.
5328367	5330628	I want to take some time to find one that suits me.
5331528	5333969	We don't know if that was good enough to get the hitman called off.
5335629	5336270	Hitman.
5336570	5337450	That's stupid.
5337471	5340112	I just am now imagining a gif of this kid.
5340453	5341193	Challenge accepted.
5343175	5343535	Very nice.
5343595	5344436	It would be hilarious.
5344476	5347238	Yeah, come at me with a Hitman on Grand Theft Auto.
5347278	5348439	I'll just kick the crap out of you.
5348479	5350580	Come at me, Dad.
5351641	5352462	All right, moving on.
5352502	5352822	DarkSakura.
5352842	5353703	That situation will never end.
5353763	5358326	That situation will never happen with me because I will always be more skilled than my son at any game that he plays.
5358727	5360528	I will make that my life's mission.
5361551	5368654	So, in other news, Zen Pinball 2 is supposed to come out on the Wii U, but it's been delayed to, I think, later this month.
5369674	5379038	And they're showing some of the games in it, one of them including Plants vs. Zombies, which is pretty neat.
5379918	5381379	And I'm trying to get this other one pulled up.
5381799	5384220	I think there was an Avengers one, wasn't there?
5385472	5388475	I think there was in the old pinball games, so maybe they brought it over.
5389056	5389797	I'm not sure though.
5389937	5390237	Maybe.
5390798	5395202	Anyway, also an update for Street Fighter X Mega Man is coming.
5396063	5405253	And it says that there is, let's see, on the download page, the traffic they're saying was insane and broke the site.
5405413	5407316	So they want to keep supporting it.
5408437	5411620	and the guy behind everything.
5411640	5416405	Well, Capcom Senior Community Manager says that they're not done with the celebrations yet.
5418648	5422212	That means more... Maybe we'll get Sakura...
5422895	5425457	This is going to be one of those celebrations that goes on for like a year.
5425497	5426297	Like my birthday.
5428258	5428598	All right.
5429179	5430840	That's it for Rapid Fire News tonight.
5430900	5432901	Let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.
5432961	5439945	You smash Facebook and Google together, our Facebook community, our Google Plus community, and you get Fugle.
5445889	5451512	Now, first off, Fugle people, explain to me why when I post the question the day before I get less answers.
5452645	5453305	Hacker's Gonna Hack
5470951	5476493	And it sounds like this week much progress was made towards hacking the 3DS to be able to run custom code.
5476694	5478194	We talked about this earlier in the show, of course.
5478674	5485097	When you hear stories like this, do you tend to think it's a good thing for the community to be able to work around region locks and homebrew?
5485337	5491820	Or do you think it's a bad thing for the community as it makes piracy easier and makes companies want to come up with even more DRM ideas?
5492120	5493141	Or are you indifferent?
5493985	5494445	You don't care.
5495386	5496807	Let's start with Google tonight.
5496847	5503011	Critical Myth, one of the hosts of Critical Myth here at the VOG Network, 4 o'clock, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Pacific.
5504311	5516359	Critical Myth says, Hacking only gets on my nerves when it's done maliciously, with no consideration for the impact on others, such as some of the actions of anonymous and similar movements.
5516559	5520722	I have to say, though, anonymous lately has been freaking boss.
5521802	5531226	Well, here's the thing, without getting too political, my understanding is that, you know, part of the fact that there is Anonymous is that there is a very kind of lack of organization.
5531266	5532187	No one's in charge.
5532467	5534188	Anonymous is kind of an idea, right?
5534868	5543992	So, yeah, I mean, I think we all heard about some of the stuff they were doing where they were teaming up with Roseanne, of all people, to bring to light some of these really horrific things that are going on in Ohio.
5544032	5546834	I don't want to get into it, but it's, you know, go Google it.
5547254	5549395	And combating the WBC.
5550915	5553156	But then I also get what Critical Miss saying.
5554116	5555976	They've done some other stuff that's not so great.
5556157	5557517	So, you know, anyhow.
5558117	5562338	But let's focus more on the first part of that statement.
5562398	5567079	Hacking only gets on my nerves when it's done maliciously with no consideration for the impact on others.
5568159	5574521	One could argue that there's no consideration for the impact of gaming companies when people do this.
5575902	5578363	But then again, there's some people that really want to run their homebrew.
5579364	5579644	Tricky.
5580705	5581505	Redertainment says,
5598334	5601795	Well, entertainment, you must be really pissed at what some of the companies are doing with DRM now.
5602575	5610197	Earlier, when Bobby Blackwolf gave us a call at the end of his show, we were talking about SimCity and how I predict that game's going to tank and it's going to be because of the DRM.
5610217	5611958	I think a lot of people are predicting this, honestly.
5612258	5614479	But I also think it's going to be the most pirated game of next year.
5615679	5617119	And it's all because of that DRM.
5619660	5624683	Let's go to Facebook and see what the folks on Facebook had to say, and we'll start it off on Facebook with Ragenator.
5625023	5626664	I'm against it, and I think it's a bad thing.
5627144	5630326	Bobby once talked about this kind of thing on his show, and I agree with his sentiment.
5630586	5637129	To paraphrase, people hacking their systems ultimately boils down to one thing, piracy, despite claims to the contrary.
5637549	5641612	Obviously, piracy isn't defensible and hurts everyone in the long run.
5642572	5643913	Loki, do you agree with that notion?
5644193	5648635	Hacking is about piracy only and all this... Let's cut through the bullshit.
5649155	5650176	Let's cut through the bullshit.
5650196	5651356	This isn't about homebrew.
5651797	5654058	This isn't about... It's about piracy.
5654518	5655519	No, I don't think that's so at all.
5655619	5662922	The people that normally do create these exploits and stuff to open up a system aren't doing it for stealing stuff.
5662942	5663903	They're just doing it to...
5664723	5670768	BlackWolf is in our chatroom, by the way, also kind of elaborating on this comment He says he was paraphrased poorly, which is fine
5687302	5691085	That just gives people reason to go listen to your show to get the word from the horse's mouth.
5691125	5693547	However, I will say this from Black Wolf.
5693727	5700172	Whenever I look at top homebrew apps for anything, nine of the top ten all facilitate backups.
5700693	5702174	The other one is a media server.
5702634	5715865	So if I'm putting kind of that together with what Loki says, maybe the people who author this stuff aren't necessarily doing it for piracy, but 90% of the people who go looking for it are.
5716505	5718307	Is that a fair statement, Loki?
5718928	5722152	A lot of people there, you're looking for hacks, or yes, looking for piracy.
5725595	5726695	Let's go to some more comments.
5727595	5730936	Lots of very long, very well thought out comments on Facebook.
5731016	5733816	Unfortunately, due to time, I can't read these things in their entirety.
5734136	5736237	So I really urge you guys during the week, check this out.
5736277	5741598	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or read some of these responses in their entirety.
5742258	5745778	DDR Darla Bill says, Everyone has their arguments for and against this.
5746199	5753900	You have those who want this so they can legitimately play imported games and you have those who just want to download files off the web and play it without having to pay the cent.
5754660	5755200	pay us sent.
5755240	5760782	Regardless of the morality behind it, ultimately, we have to wonder if it's good for the consumer or not.
5762043	5766104	So, you know, the way that the game companies have to respond to what happens.
5768065	5770786	Burr responds and says, I think it's a great thing for community.
5771106	5778549	It gives independent developers a chance to play with new hardware, which in the 3DS's case could be especially interesting because I feel its potential hasn't been fully tapped yet.
5780825	5783768	I think a lot of people are excited to see what type of homebrew could come up with.
5785169	5792515	Rob himself replies and says, I got an original Xbox at the end of its run and ended up getting a chip to run homebrew and of course pirated games.
5792975	5794136	I ended up with lots of games.
5794216	5797399	If I did not like a game, I would just pop a new one in and it would never be played again.
5797779	5801582	So pretty much due to being spoiled for choice, I never really gave most games a chance.
5802063	5808067	That was the last time I had a console chipped and modded and now I spend way more times on playing games that I paid for.
5809198	5810879	Very interesting conclusion.
5811740	5822068	So what I'm reading into that is that because you just would throw away all these games, you had access to anything you wanted and you ended up just throwing most of it away and never giving it a second thought.
5822088	5829493	And because of that, you just want to buy the games and focus on that as opposed to, I guess, wasting your time downloading crap.
5829934	5832195	I think that's what I'm trying to read between the lines there.
5832235	5833016	I think that's what I'm hearing.
5833056	5833937	That's what it sounds like.
5833957	5834297	Yeah.
5835960	5847933	Daniel S replies and said these things will happen no matter what all the people I know who hack and torrent are people who won't ever buy a game I feel that it's because we keep our ear to the ground that we feel like it's a big deal
5849384	5850345	Degenerate Johnny says...
5873734	5882321	They shouldn't alienate its market based on location by forcing its consumers to purchase products that are only provided within their respective regions.
5882401	5884022	That's the first half of the comment there.
5885924	5896112	While Devil's Advocate, it's Nintendo's hardware, they have the right to make whatever choices they want, but I guess what I'm hearing out of this is that this is how the community is going to respond to it.
5896792	5903017	When you try to take these things away, the community will patch it in themselves, I guess.
5905869	5907911	Tiger Claw says it's both a good thing and a bad thing.
5909173	5916100	Oftentimes a console would have certain features that a hacker would implement and those features would end up in a future update at some point as well as play imported games.
5916480	5922186	It's also bad because it encourages piracy and makes those that do not intend on playing download it for free instead.
5923772	5924533	DarkCharger.
5925433	5926414	Very interesting comment here.
5927494	5935819	As someone who has been playing games for over three decades and has worked in software development for over 15 years, this is a very difficult question to answer.
5936340	5940863	The piracy of software that one doesn't already own a license to is stealing, period.
5941423	5944325	This hurts not only game software makers, but the industry as a whole.
5944645	5950569	That being said, I do not for an instant believe that a pirated game is necessarily a lost sale.
5951269	5951610	DarkSakura.com
5969091	5973173	We all know that on the whole, the primary motive in most of these cases is piracy.
5973773	5980275	I do think, though, that these DRM restrictions only hurt legitimate buyers and are also largely ineffective.
5980435	5982296	And he closes that with slash long-winded.
5983256	5987758	I think that's a great comment, and I'd like to hear from somebody that's kind of in that industry what they think.
5988738	5990679	Any thoughts on that comment, what Dark Charger said, Loki?
5991138	5991738	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6022840	6029707	I agree that that's one of the problems when they're calculating losses with piracy.
6029767	6031909	You can't say that, oh, that was a lost sale.
6032670	6039937	And sometimes, in the cases where you may pirate the game, play it for a few weeks, and then buy the physical copy when it comes out.
6040838	6042359	How many people really do that?
6043280	6044001	There's a lot of people.
6045422	6047063	Alright.
6047183	6049203	Next comment from IamSuperLazy.
6049784	6050324	I love that name.
6050344	6050964	Me too, buddy.
6050984	6051324	Me too.
6052204	6054685	IamSuperLazy says, I want to make things clear.
6054865	6059507	I don't pirate, nor do I endorse piracy, and I do like the 3DS and have spent many hours playing the thing.
6060607	6061268	playing the thing.
6061728	6069134	That being said, I do agree with the Free Software Foundation stance on things like being able to mess with the hardware if I have the capability to.
6069294	6075518	It comes down to having control of what you buy because I own it and not being tied down to draconian TOS.
6076679	6081984	Lastly, Codeman replies and says, I think it comes down to two different kinds of people in the world, good and bad.
6082664	6087589	Good people will do something intelligent and fun with it, but bad will do something to destroy the fun for everyone else.
6088209	6092713	Either way, both will force companies to implement more restrictions so both sides lose.
6093054	6097137	So I think I'm indifferent because in the right hands, it could be used for good.
6098258	6109247	So if I were to read into Codeman's comment, he's saying that there are lawful good people in the world, and there are chaotic evil people in the world, but you're more like true neutral.
6110447	6111128	Is that what I'm hearing?
6112089	6112329	Maybe.
6113467	6113747	Alright.
6114808	6117489	In seriousness though, I think he's right.
6117950	6120111	Some people have good intentions.
6120171	6121652	Some people do not have good intentions.
6122252	6124193	I think that's true for a lot of things in life.
6124793	6125374	Anyhow, that's it.
6125394	6126434	The Fugle Question of the Week.
6127055	6131017	Participate next week by joining one of our communities either on Facebook or on Google+.
6131657	6134158	Meanwhile, if there's no other comments here in studio...
6135379	6137480	We'll get to gaming news.
6137560	6137801	Loki.
6138121	6138401	All right.
6138921	6148927	So there's another kind of Android console game, Android console coming out called the GameStick.
6148967	6155471	And what the GameStick is, is it's basically this device that plugs into your TV using the HDMI port.
6155491	6158452	It actually gets the power from the HDMI port if your TV supports that.
6158492	6162695	Otherwise, they have an external adapter you can use, either USB or a wall plug.
6163495	6178079	It's going to go for $79, and it's supposed to play different Android games, very similar to the Ouya, versus, though, I think that a lot of the games being put on this aren't necessarily being made specifically for it.
6178099	6181780	It's not like it's going to have its own separate marketplace like the Ouya did.
6182100	6188602	Although they say that PlayJam is working with more than 250 developers to get titles made for and ported to the system.
6189122	6209304	and it basically comes with a controller as well very similar to an Xbox 360 controller and what's kind of cool is the console since it's the size of a USB stick plugs into the you can actually store it in the controller so you just take the controller with you and pop it into a TV and away you go that's like one of those wireless mouse like laptop mice that have the USB dongle inside the mouse so yeah
6210024	6223126	and I guess it's going to run Jelly Bean on Android and then of course outputting at 1080p and it's powered by an ArmLogic 8726 MX mobile processor.
6223346	6231708	They actually have quite a few of these kind of all-in-one devices that you can buy now that do this sort of thing.
6232128	6237569	Not necessarily with a controller attached to it but you can get these kind of PCs on a stick
6238729	6250116	That have all this Android stuff You know, back when I was a teenager The only thing you got on a stick was a hot dog And now you can get a PC on a stick Yes
6253001	6276486	so it's expected out to um and of course it is on Kickstarter so they are they are working to um kickstart this and it's they're expecting the console to officially launch one month after the Ouya in April and as of right now just taking a quick peek to see if they've already hit their goal so oh wow um you know it should do all right but uh how many people bought an Ouya and this
6277822	6279603	Is this competition for the Ouya Loki?
6280464	6281604	I don't know.
6281724	6296273	I mean, the controller is set up, like I said, it was sort of like an Xbox 360, but it's more of like, sort of like the analog layout is set up like the Xbox 360, but the controller looks like a classic controller on the Wii.
6297133	6299395	And, I don't know, it looks kind of cheap.
6299595	6302577	But, I mean, granted, it's a prototype that they're showing the picture of.
6303437	6319077	Um, I guess it could be feasible for somebody to look at this and say, oh, hey, I'll pick it up because it's $20 cheaper than the OUYA, but I would wait and see until they have some more information about this, um, you know, versus the OUYA CSU.
6319557	6322439	I have a feeling you're going to see a lot more of these types of things coming out.
6322799	6323260	Of course.
6323300	6325001	Like I said, they already have them.
6325821	6327883	The Ouya made a ton of money on Kickstarter.
6328123	6329003	Who doesn't like money?
6329203	6329404	Exactly.
6329424	6331405	And people are throwing it everywhere on Kickstarter.
6331545	6344854	They already have different... If you actually do a search about the ArmLogic 8726 or whatever, you can actually look and find some other devices that are very similar minus the controller.
6345254	6348056	But once again, you could probably use a Bluetooth controller with it.
6348797	6351262	Um, that are very similar.
6351462	6358296	So the price point's pretty nice considering you get a controller with it, but I don't know.
6358316	6359158	It's interesting.
6361303	6370827	All right, speaking of interesting, this next story, quite the opposite of what you usually hear when you talk about the media, kind of like, or, you know, universities and so forth reporting on games.
6371468	6374969	Polygon ran a very interesting article this week about World of Warcraft players.
6375330	6377090	Could they be the ideal employee?
6377290	6384734	And this article is based on a video from researcher John Seeley Brown, did the video for Knowledge Forum Big Think.
6385514	6394958	And apparently in the video, Mr. Brown says, quote, I would rather hire a high-level World of Warcraft player than an MBA from Harvard.
6395658	6401620	Why is a game, a massive multiplayer game that has maybe 12 million people or more playing it like World of Warcraft?
6402020	6429950	so important at both the individual level and maybe at the corporate level to understand these massive multiplayer games like World of Warcraft do not think about it as just gameplay but look at the social life on the edge of the game and of course I get into talking about you know the guilds and how you gotta manage people when you're running a guild when you do well in these guilds you get the extra bonuses and so forth you have to do research and you do this because you want to you want to be better
6431834	6438396	and he calls that a self-organized ideation structure and an idea refinement structure.
6438956	6441957	These guilds are truly meritocracy based.
6442237	6452679	So even if you were the leader of this particularly high-end raid, at the end you do an after-action review and the after-action review each person is open to total criticism by everybody else.
6453559	6454219	More dots!
6454679	6455320	More dots!
6455400	6456340	It needs more dots!
6457080	6457920	Would you hire that guy?
6459181	6460201	Turn down Rob's vent.
6462486	6490677	set raw volume to 50% one more quote here the game described quote as an amazing learning environment with powerful learning tools that I think we in the education world can learn a hell of a lot about and we in the management world can learn a lot about but it gets back to this notion of passion it gets back to this notion of curiosity and it gets back to this notion this is an interest driven phenomenon that unleashes exponential learning of a dimension that's almost unimaginable any other way what do you guys think about this?
6492177	6493758	Do you think there is merit to this?
6493838	6501842	That somebody who excels at World of Warcraft may bring something to the professional corporate table that somebody with an MBA from Harvard would not?
6502142	6502322	No.
6503263	6503703	Actually, yeah.
6504223	6510906	Because there's something to be said for book learning versus real life experience for interaction with people.
6511667	6515629	You know, I often think sometimes a college degree can ruin a natural talent.
6516710	6524017	I am coming from an art field, so yeah, I've seen people's work, the more education they have.
6524037	6527320	It's important to say you're not saying all the time, you're saying some of the time.
6527360	6532505	There's people who I totally respected as artists that I think that their work was better when they were still raw and new.
6533106	6533566	I'm just saying.
6534347	6558443	that being said you have to I think have the background information to go with it but if you want somebody who's going to be a good manager of people for someone who's going to be able to give feedback in an open environment you need someone who has experience and that you just don't get immediately in school unless you've taken tons of rhetoric classes you know apart from that
6560282	6561263	Loki, you said no.
6561483	6562083	What's your take?
6562343	6566346	The no on that is because I think you could say the same in the reverse.
6566526	6570909	You know, why... You have, you know, this MMO.
6570949	6574491	And granted, there's some people that are probably going to be well-organized or whatever in this.
6574531	6577453	But at the same time, you could also have well-organized people that have an MBA.
6577873	6579774	I don't think one's necessarily better than the other.
6579834	6582416	It's just one went to college.
6583296	6586879	And that's not to say that the person playing World of Warcraft didn't go to college either.
6586919	6587499	I mean, you're just...
6589133	6589974	They play a game.
6590034	6594159	That doesn't necessarily mean anything.
6594199	6596642	I mean, hell, 10-year-olds play the game.
6596662	6599646	7-year-olds probably play World of Warcraft, and they may be good at it.
6599866	6602109	Does that mean you should hire a 7-year-old for your fucking job?
6602470	6602610	No.
6603268	6604489	I think they're referring to adults.
6605309	6606090	It doesn't matter though.
6606150	6619758	I'm saying that the people that play this and necessarily can excel at this aren't, I mean, if you're going to say they have all these team working skills and stuff like that, I'm sorry, but if you're hiring someone that can't work in a team, I mean, that's a whole other problem.
6619778	6622039	You need to just get rid of that employee anyways.
6622680	6624741	I don't think it has anything to do with their level of education.
6624761	6626362	I don't know.
6627245	6633108	Ranma in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, at my old job, we geeked it up, but you were shunned for playing WoW.
6633608	6634448	Here's my question.
6634549	6634869	Why?
6635169	6642772	I mean, I play WoW, and I get that there's that stigma that's attached to it, but no offense, you watch My Little Pony.
6645293	6645974	Here's my thing.
6646074	6646854	My point with that.
6646894	6648695	I'm not knocking the bronies and all that.
6648755	6651818	My point with that is that we've all got our thing, right?
6652318	6654659	And usually it's usually a social thing.
6654720	6656981	And a lot of it is like community and so forth, right?
6659385	6666267	I wouldn't read this article to the extreme that, oh, a person who plays WoW is better than a person with an MBA.
6666767	6667627	Not necessarily.
6667667	6668847	I wouldn't go that far with it.
6669148	6675669	But I would read into that is that this guy is saying, hey, don't laugh at the guy who runs a high-end guild in WoW.
6676049	6682051	Don't write him off automatically because he plays a computer game because actually it can take a lot of discipline.
6682331	6686552	And to that extent, I really agree with it is that running a high-end guild in WoW
6687432	6691234	You do have to manage people and you do have to learn how to settle down drama.
6691314	6694376	And yes, a lot of those experiences can carry over into the real world.
6694876	6699899	It is a social interaction I'm not sure you appropriately are exposed to in college.
6700940	6701360	No, you're not.
6701740	6703641	That's why they require you to take a speech class.
6705262	6709804	But one speech class doesn't really prepare you for that type of working with people.
6711067	6714948	So I think these two skills complement each other.
6714988	6723010	It's not necessarily that one betters the other, but I think the person who has the MBA and understands social interaction and WoW is a pretty good candidate.
6723410	6728251	Now, here's a very interesting question from Tigerclaw in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
6729092	6729792	He asks me...
6730692	6734454	You're a corporate trainer by day, a Warcraft player by night.
6735034	6738456	Has your WoW experience helped improve your experience in your job?
6739036	6740176	That's a really good question.
6741177	6745239	Probably not as much as this show has complimented my job, believe it or not.
6746179	6746700	Think about it.
6746940	6755265	In my day job, I have to get in front of a group of people and talk about subjects for seven and a half hours a day at some points.
6755966	6759388	And we do a very similar thing on this show in some ways.
6759648	6767554	I taught Customer Contact Center for a long time where we had to explain to people how to answer the phone and you never know what could be on the other side.
6767954	6770256	Guess what I do at the end of the show that will be coming up later?
6770896	6774942	Answer phone calls, and you never know what might be on the other side, and kind of having to deal with that.
6775002	6783935	Not that we necessarily get irate callers on this show, and that's not an invitation, but you know, some of those skills do kind of complement each other a bit.
6784511	6798894	After seven years of working in customer service where five of it was spent dealing with purely irate customers, I am much better dealing with people in an audio situation than I am looking at them.
6799074	6803634	I can tell practically anything from a tone of voice than how their body language is acting.
6805035	6811796	And I think in some cases, being able to infer from voice inflection is a rarer skill.
6813231	6814232	Now here's something else.
6816033	6819196	In my career, I've aspired to get into management.
6819276	6820897	You know, you want to move up the corporate ladder.
6821037	6821478	I'm sorry.
6822058	6823059	Well, shut up.
6823139	6833387	Because I would actually like to train other trainers and I'd like to manage a department of trainers because at the end of the day, I want to have a more positive impact on how people learn.
6833727	6839272	Because, you know, I like to think I'm pretty good at what I do and I want to, you know, manage other people to kind of do it very similarly.
6839732	6839872	Okay.
6840473	6845698	I have applied for management positions at various places in my own company and so forth.
6846239	6850463	Usually, I get turned down, which is rejection is something we have to face in life, right?
6850864	6854007	I get turned down because I don't have enough management experience.
6855249	6856570	In a way, it kind of ticks me off.
6856590	6860434	Well, I shouldn't say it ticks me off, but it's disappointing because...
6861946	6867948	I've been managing this show in a way, in a way, right, for 11, 12 years.
6868848	6871509	A lot of that experience I have in World of Warcraft.
6871549	6876771	I mean, I realize I can't put that on a resume, but it's kind of irritating that people don't necessarily look at that.
6876831	6884574	Like, yes, I do know how to quell dramatic situations, and I know how to handle angry people, and I know how to talk to people when people are performing badly.
6884854	6887295	You have to do all of that stuff in World of Warcraft.
6888015	6917218	so what this guy says in a way does kind of strike home maybe we should give more credit to that than we are not that I think I should get a job merely because of that there's other things I can do too and I'm working on it but I don't think you should discount some of my other things just because they're tied to video games any other thoughts guys before we move on thank you which by the way no desire to be management
6918393	6919353	Well, that's you.
6920454	6920714	All right.
6921795	6934640	SSJ100 Matt in our chat room says, here's a fact, and I'm going out on a limb, and I don't want to speak for the host, but I can say that you guys, Rob, Jamie, Loki, learned more people and speech skills from just doing this show more than any class could teach you.
6935441	6936481	In many ways, yes.
6937022	6940023	I can't speak for my co-host, but yeah, in a lot of ways.
6940363	6946286	Has this show benefited speech elements of your life?
6947506	6957388	I think that I've learned how to control vocal inflection a bit better rather than go all out, I guess.
6957728	6959509	I mean, yeah, it's helped.
6959569	6960469	It's constant practice.
6961689	6962010	Loki?
6963770	6964870	I don't know.
6965010	6965530	I guess.
6965850	6966131	Yeah?
6967551	6971132	It's hard to tell where I pick up things.
6971232	6971552	I don't know.
6972566	6975629	Alright, then again, I've been doing speech a long time.
6976049	6979532	Little known fact, I won a speech contest when I was 17, a pretty big one.
6980173	6982715	Yeah, you know, I just, I like talking.
6983936	6985257	That should be obvious, right?
6986118	6988120	Alright, let's move on with some other video game news.
6988520	6989021	DarkSakura.
6990038	6993600	In other news, see, I just controlled my vocal inflection.
6995120	6997461	There is a game out in Japan.
6997641	7002784	It's a browser game that's too hard for children and everyone else.
7003504	7004624	It's a Disney game.
7004664	7006985	It's a Disney Winnie the Pooh browser game.
7007886	7012007	And it's been making children cry in Japan.
7013248	7013828	Poor Japanese kids.
7013848	7015029	I'm laughing, but that's sad.
7015989	7019991	So basically it's a game where Pooh tries to hit pitches in baseball.
7020791	7031195	You have to aim the bat with the mouse and click to swing, but it has to be perfect timing for a home run, which is the only kind that counts, and it's making children cry.
7031275	7033896	And also keep in mind, baseball is super, super big in Japan.
7034557	7036918	So Winnie the Pooh in baseball, making children cry.
7039479	7042280	Some folks in the chat room have been saying, I've been playing this.
7043100	7045101	Ross Steel UT says, Bravo, Disney.
7046195	7046635	Now, now.
7048916	7053498	So maybe these developers didn't keep their audience in mind when they were developing the game?
7053718	7054158	I don't know.
7056098	7058439	Or maybe they're just rougher on their kids in other countries.
7058499	7058859	Who knows?
7059540	7059820	All right.
7061359	7078032	Well, American McGee has turned to Kickstarter to go ahead and fund his next project, Akaneiro Demon Hunters, which is sort of based off of Little Red Riding Hood, but with, I guess, a Japanese mythology slant or something to it.
7079353	7083876	It could be from the fact that Alice in Madness Returns kind of flopped, maybe.
7084197	7085858	No one wants to fund his game anymore.
7086738	7112854	but he's looking for $200,000 right now on Kickstarter for it and it's expected to be ported to a bunch of different platforms including Android, iOS, PC, Mac and they're seeing cross-platform support and of course also the stretch goals include Linux because that's always a stretch goal for some reason and right now they've got about 26 days to go and they're only $33,000 into it
7115776	7117277	It doesn't seem like a big response yet.
7117357	7118117	The game looks pretty.
7118818	7123921	It's kind of like an interesting art style, I guess.
7126863	7129385	Not something I would back, probably, but it looks neat.
7131326	7133528	But a lot of that would be concept stuff, right?
7133568	7136530	Because how much of the work has actually been done if they're on Kickstarter?
7136550	7136630	Yeah.
7137000	7138902	Well, I mean, I don't know.
7139662	7139962	Maybe.
7140583	7143325	I'm not sure really what he's looking for money for.
7144326	7146968	I'd have to watch the video, but I'm not going to.
7146988	7149950	Let's see.
7150030	7151271	Why is he kick-starting this?
7153092	7155154	It says it's been in development since mid-2011.
7156835	7160378	Apparently, they have had a closed beta running since November 2012.
7160518	7160939	And...
7165649	7166750	That's a great question.
7166810	7168111	Why are they kickstarting it?
7168451	7171133	I mean, it goes to ask that question.
7171173	7172434	What's Kickstarter really for?
7172474	7173455	You're not really... Oh, here we go.
7173855	7176277	Or are you kickstarting the distribution or whatever?
7176317	7176657	No, no, no.
7176857	7177738	Why do we need backing?
7177838	7183743	We need to reach $200,000 to support our current team of developers in realizing the most complete version of the game.
7185444	7186745	That's very vague.
7187465	7188566	So they need $200,000 to...
7193374	7196276	So basically, it says the backing will guarantee the following.
7196977	7204002	Android, iOS, tablet versions, co-op, multiplayer, equipment crafting system, and improved community support.
7205002	7210766	And then I guess also Karma Void Dungeons, Lockboxes, and a bunch of miscellaneous shit.
7211387	7214389	So it sounds like it's just they ran out of money for...
7217610	7222472	It looks like, judging by the description here, that it's going to be a free-to-play game.
7223192	7227954	So they're going to offer free and then they're going to have DLC, kind of like you would expect on iOS and stuff.
7229334	7231995	So, I don't know.
7232776	7238638	Seg in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, The money certainly seems to be for finishing, but maybe also marketing?
7238818	7239298	It's weird.
7239438	7241319	So they want finishing round of funding.
7244377	7250021	I would think if that's the case and the game's already practically done, it's coming out whether they meet their goal or not.
7250501	7256885	They just want the money to be able to market it and distribute it maybe a little more efficiently or to a wider potential audience.
7257406	7258206	It's an investment.
7258707	7265711	Well, they're trying to get it on Steam Greenlight because that's one of the things that they have on there.
7266492	7269033	I don't know.
7269093	7269554	It's just...
7271204	7281031	I'm kind of like, it's almost to me like his name is meaning less because Alice was so good and then everything else that's come after that hasn't been as good.
7281512	7285495	And so it's just kind of like, do we really trust American McGee?
7286695	7287016	I don't know.
7289097	7291379	Although Bad Day LA looked hilarious, but
7293180	7295641	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7320889	7323039	and I warned you guys, they're coming for the video games.
7323789	7325790	Well, here it is.
7326470	7326931	Here it is.
7328491	7329132	I warned you.
7329612	7330032	Here it is.
7330932	7332593	Running around the game blogs this week.
7333193	7337295	A January 12th event being organized by Southington.
7337495	7341577	This town is about 30 miles from where the tragedy took place.
7341978	7343078	Southington SOS.
7343498	7351022	It's a collection of representatives from the Connecticut town's organizations like YMCA, Board of Education, Fire Department, United Way, Clergy,
7351582	7353667	Chamber of Commerce, etc., etc.
7354268	7359239	They are going to be encouraging people to turn in violent video games.
7361045	7364327	and then they are going to destroy them and they're going to burn them.
7365488	7369350	Just like communities did in the past to Dixie Chicks albums.
7370891	7375453	And I'm sure books and movies and porn.
7376093	7379675	And a series of fine art in Renaissance Italy.
7380196	7381997	Witches, absolutely.
7386320	7391863	From the organization, there are youngsters who appear to be consumed with violent video games.
7392944	7401090	This is a quote from an interview with Polygon Joe Arardi from Southington School Superintendent.
7401994	7404895	There are youngsters who appear to be consumed with violent video games.
7405035	7406496	I'm not certain if that's a good thing.
7406556	7410977	If this encourages one courageous conversation with a parent and their child, it's a success.
7411657	7418059	We're suggesting that for parents who have a child or children who play violent video games to first of all view the games.
7418700	7421861	We're asking parents to better understand what their child is doing.
7422261	7424181	Have a conversation about next steps.
7424582	7427943	If parents are comfortable with their child's gaming habits, we're comfortable.
7428803	7434646	If they decide you're not so comfortable, you can go to the local drive-in movie theater on January 12th.
7434906	7441470	Turn in the games for a $25 gift voucher for a local water park or other local forms of entertainment.
7441750	7446633	Let's go see an R-rated movie with that $25 voucher.
7446913	7448694	Let's go see Django Unchained.
7448934	7452216	That'll be a good family film we could go check out.
7453456	7454617	Let's go see Les Mis.
7456978	7458199	Watch all those people die.
7463240	7482379	once those items are turned in the discs will be snapped tossed into a town dumpster and likely burned now another further statement from the organization the group's action is not intended to be construed as statement declaring that violent video games were the cause of the shocking violence in Newtown too late
7483490	7502936	Rather, we're saying that there is ample evidence that violent video games, along with violent media of all kinds, including TV and movies, portraying story after story, showing a continuous stream of violence and killing, has contributed to increasing aggressiveness, fear, anxiety, and is desensitizing our children to acts of violence, including bullying.
7503376	7507497	Social and political commentators, as well as elected officials, including the president,
7508257	7515883	are attributing violent crime to many factors including inadequate gun control laws, a culture of violence, and recreational culture of violence.
7516283	7522788	So what I'm hearing with this, how do we respond to the violence and killing and the increasing aggressiveness?
7523008	7524229	How do we respond?
7524569	7529013	We're going to get the angry mod to snap this shit in half and set it on fire.
7529533	7530794	That's not aggressive.
7530974	7536378	Well, you know, you know, Rob, fear leads to anger and anger leads to hate and hate leads to suffering.
7537199	7537559	Just saying.
7538139	7556152	But, you know, once again, the integral part of their plan is that they want parents to be responsible for their children, which is never going to fucking happen because it's just unfortunately nowadays they obviously don't want to blame the parents.
7556492	7571339	or parenting for any of this violence but because it was the parent that was supposed to view those games and figure out if it was appropriate for their child and they failed to do that because they're parents and they don't want to take responsibility for their own actions.
7571600	7572360	It's like a contradiction.
7572380	7582505	It's like we want you to take responsibility for this stuff but at the same time we're going to blame whatever on these video games instead of taking responsibility for this stuff.
7582685	7586529	I'm sure it's no surprise our chatters are lit up on this topic here.
7587130	7590794	DarkTetsuya says, so why is the bonfire just focusing on video games?
7591054	7595659	And is anybody thinking about the poor air quality that we're going to get from burning all this plastic?
7595719	7597821	I mean, that's got to be bad for the children.
7597941	7600804	What if January 12th is a winter spare the air day?
7601105	7601225	What?
7601545	7602106	Then what?
7602166	7611152	What happens if that crazy toxic fumes coming from the dump or whatever causes a child to get enraged and murder somebody?
7611332	7611873	Then what?
7612013	7612933	Then what are we going to do?
7615395	7615936	Let's see.
7617357	7621720	DKB says they should just pretend to burn them and then take them all down to GameStop for some money.
7622661	7624322	That would be a good idea for a fundraiser.
7624342	7625183	Burn the GameStop.
7625203	7626564	There's all the evil games in there.
7627764	7629766	That's like going to the... I don't know.
7630467	7635430	Ross Steel UT says, in cases like this, I'm thankful the Supreme Court ruled against Leland Yee.
7636650	7644314	Tiger Claw says, oftentimes it's the older brother who buys the game that the younger kid gets exposed to, so it's not the parents at fault.
7644841	7645822	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7662082	7663823	You may be interested in an interesting follow-up.
7686542	7695377	In another article that Polygon did later in the week, Christopher J. Ferguson, who is the chairman of the Texas A&M International University Department of Psychology and Communication, said...
7696212	7716018	Don't get me wrong, I am fully aware you are trying to do what you think is best, but there is real risk in focusing people's attention on the wrong thing as well as contributing to historical patterns of mortal panic that tend to surround new media, often despite evidence media is not harmful even if it may be offensive.
7718339	7718659	Thoughts?
7722864	7726227	Well, yeah, I mean... It's classic moral panic.
7726587	7732833	Whenever we have traumatic events like this historically going all the way back to the Greeks, people tend to blame the media.
7733133	7735895	It makes us feel like we know what happened and that we can fix it.
7736115	7738578	It's very easy to get society to focus on the media as a boogeyman.
7738798	7739278	Witch hunting.
7739598	7740119	That's all it is.
7740379	7744720	Really, at the end of the day, we just have to blame Fox News for, you know, all this anyways.
7744760	7749981	Because who would have got, who, don't tell me that these people are actually smart enough to come up with ideas on their own.
7750181	7754302	They heard Fox News, oh my god, those video games, oh my god, they are violent.
7754502	7755862	They are causing murderers.
7755982	7760463	Why aren't we doing anything about this evil, evil, non-Christian thing?
7760643	7763464	I mean, I'm sorry, it's just...
7765376	7766537	Mob Motality, I guess.
7766617	7767518	Some further quotes.
7767898	7768299	Oh, go ahead.
7768399	7772742	If I may say, there's one name in history that should totally illustrate the point.
7773122	7773563	McCarthy.
7774904	7775785	Funny you bring that up.
7776105	7777966	Let me read one more quote from the follow-up.
7779668	7783371	If you're going to have a conversation now, I'd be careful about how you broach it.
7783871	7787594	Make it clear that you understand that video games don't contribute to mass shootings.
7787935	7790797	Make it clear that you're not indulging in this moral panic.
7791638	7792498	Speaking about the 50s.
7794093	7799699	Back then, they had psychiatrists going before Congress saying comics cause not only delinquency, but homosexuality.
7799719	7802002	I know Superman totally made me gay.
7813129	7814830	I can't believe that black people couldn't marry white people.
7814850	7815370	That's so silly.
7815410	7816090	You can't marry gays.
7816130	7816470	I got nothing.
7840154	7843296	It's... Look.
7844217	7847119	It really is people not paying attention to what's not in front of them.
7847759	7854183	You know, and this is actually, I'd say, a very deep downfall of human nature.
7854844	7861348	You know, we have phrases out there about learning from history so you don't repeat it, but people really don't learn from history.
7861408	7863290	People don't like to think outside of their box.
7863790	7869794	They want something to distract them from the troubles going on around them, so they, like, oh, well,
7870615	7875379	so and so has mental health issues we have this going on we have that going on let's blame games it's easy
7876485	7876945	Here's the thing.
7876985	7877606	Here's my opinion.
7878347	7881710	If you want to snap your discs in half and set it on fire, that's fine.
7881770	7882791	That's your prerogative.
7882871	7888135	And the parents, as the ones who probably bought that disc for their kids, have every right to do so.
7888195	7892699	But in my opinion, don't do it because of a panic going on in society.
7893120	7895382	Do it because your kids aren't doing their homework.
7895582	7898144	That's why you snap the discs in half and set them on fire.
7898484	7899705	You don't do it because...
7900646	7902987	You know, or let's be smart here.
7903167	7909469	At least if you're going to, you know, do that stuff, do trade them in and sell them or something so you can get some money back or something.
7909529	7912270	I mean, a voucher to a water park, cool.
7912310	7917072	You know, if your games are worth more than $25, then, you know, you should probably take them somewhere and at least trade them in.
7917272	7919993	At least be somewhat smart about it if you're going to get rid of it.
7920253	7925495	You don't like, you know, if you think your car is evil, you don't drive it off a cliff, okay?
7925555	7926015	You would think,
7926315	7930878	Okay, if this car is not very good, I'm just going to go ahead and sell it to a dealership or something like that.
7930898	7931919	You've never driven Christine.
7933200	7936182	Well, Christine doesn't, you don't drive Christine, Christine drives you.
7937003	7942386	But, well, I mean, the thing is, too, also now let's take a look at something outside the box.
7942767	7943787	They're creating more litter.
7945188	7947830	By burning plastic items, they're releasing fumes into the air.
7948591	7952954	So they're actually creating a health and safety hazard with their little witch hunt.
7953993	7956974	To be fair, they said it would be likely incinerated.
7957174	7958234	They may not actually do it.
7958654	7960655	They may just compact it into a little cube.
7960715	7961095	Who knows?
7962015	7963155	Does it really change anything?
7963175	7964316	Would it be a GameCube?
7966936	7970537	It's still mob mentality, and it's what gets people hurt in the long run.
7970757	7975858	You're promoting violence on this show because I'm about ready to jump over this fucking table and strangle you for that joke.
7978999	7981340	In happier news, let's get to the mailbag.
7981540	7982240	Nook, nook, nook.
7984475	7987737	DarkSakura, what are the emails this week?
7987777	7988697	Yeah, we have two.
7988717	7988877	Just two.
8009102	8012743	The first one is from Nasty Canasta.
8013903	8017824	OLR Crew, hang on to your asses because I'm putting you on the spot with a question.
8018245	8020725	What is an unpopular opinion you have for a video game?
8023886	8024686	I don't know.
8026267	8029468	I don't really care if my opinion's unpopular, so I don't know.
8031708	8032408	Does that make sense?
8035469	8037650	An unpopular opinion you have on games...
8040185	8042087	Pokemon's kind of repetitive, guys.
8044910	8046712	Yet you guys are all like really into it.
8046772	8048593	It's been the same thing for how long?
8048654	8049594	It's kind of repetitive.
8049755	8051717	Just saying.
8051757	8054119	Chrono Trigger was also not the best Super Nintendo game.
8054139	8055661	That's my opinion.
8056401	8056962	I hate Kaden.
8059875	8063957	also contributing to violence on this program.
8064658	8066199	I guess that would be mine.
8066679	8070161	I don't think that Caden is a very good love interest for FemShep.
8071762	8075784	I'm not sure that's a hugely popular opinion in the first place, but that's fine.
8076945	8079386	How about Excite Truck was the best launch game for the Wii?
8080367	8080867	It's pretty good.
8083536	8084817	Okay, more email of this one.
8106118	8106458	Anyway, um...
8129085	8133509	Oh, the battle system had its interesting points, but I did not see what the hubbub was about with the story.
8133609	8135230	Sorry to all you fanboys and fangirls out there.
8135250	8135891	Okay.
8136471	8139554	To this day, the RPGs that's near and dear to me is Final Fantasy IX.
8140114	8141475	I just love everything about that game.
8141516	8146139	However, I'm looking forward to the inevitable and hopefully 3D remake of Final Fantasy VI on 3DS.
8146940	8152304	In the meantime, I should get back to my DS backlog to play the Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy IV.
8152745	8153205	Garrus!
8153485	8153766	Yes.
8154326	8155167	The nasty Canasta.
8156519	8157160	Last email.
8158161	8159021	Hey, it's Chris109.
8159302	8160223	I like the show.
8161083	8164166	Oh yeah, update PSP site.
8164246	8165768	I still use it, I guess.
8166388	8167910	Not gonna happen.
8168671	8169872	Well, I mean, I'm talking about the grammar.
8170332	8177819	But my favorite game of 2012 is PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale and my disappointing game is Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword.
8178720	8179000	Okay.
8180001	8180662	Thank you for sharing.
8183459	8184681	There's no why.
8184941	8186864	Yeah, we want to know why.
8189654	8191295	I'll tell you what this emailer did do, though.
8191775	8194116	Totally remind me of an unpopular gaming opinion.
8194156	8194636	Y'all ready?
8194696	8195476	Y'all ready?
8195616	8196057	Y'all ready?
8196797	8197117	Watch.
8197217	8198357	Watch what I'm about to say.
8198758	8200098	And you fucking come at me, bro.
8201199	8202139	Ocarina of Time?
8202779	8203319	Ain't all that.
8204040	8204760	I fucking said it.
8204980	8205380	Yeah, I did.
8205420	8206221	Yeah, I did.
8206501	8207281	Yeah, I did.
8207341	8207681	Come at me.
8208101	8208942	Majora's Mask.
8209182	8209662	Not fun.
8210462	8211843	My favorite 3D Zelda game?
8212043	8212543	Wind Waker.
8212903	8213703	Link to the Past.
8213904	8215184	Superior in every way.
8217205	8217545	Bring it.
8220253	8224454	Well, now that we just had like 50 people unsubscribe from the show, thanks for the emails, guys.
8228536	8238739	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com In a related topic, let's get to the FUs of the week, shall we?
8240060	8244061	I can just see people like listening to this show at their work, sitting at their desk going, what?
8246642	8248563	Now we're going to have an angry mob coming after us.
8265546	8266148	Fuck people.
8266569	8267391	Just seriously.
8268214	8269537	You know, I'll try.
8272145	8273386	No one likes being trolled.
8274506	8276327	No one likes being pushed.
8277208	8281951	And if someone has stated that they don't like something, don't fucking rub it in.
8282411	8284552	I'm not going to go on Facebook anymore.
8284592	8285113	I'm done with it.
8285153	8285793	I'm done with people.
8286293	8292957	There's all the more reason for me to just stay in my room and not look at people or talk to them or anything.
8293097	8294258	I don't get people anymore.
8294638	8297079	We should cut Facebook and throw it in a dumpster, honestly.
8298480	8299060	Seriously?
8299541	8299881	Loki.
8300301	8303082	But that would be throwing books away.
8303122	8304163	And not our community.
8305743	8309465	So would you throw books away and save face?
8309485	8313967	No, you'd use the paper's fire starter for the future.
8315348	8317009	Only when it's a safe day to burn, though.
8317089	8321651	Always check the burn day first.
8321851	8323952	I guess that's due to the fact that game making is hard.
8326041	8327162	Are you making a game, Loki?
8327342	8329864	No, I'm not making a game.
8330544	8332085	I don't know if I have an FU of the week.
8332986	8334827	For the most part, things are going pretty well.
8337328	8342852	I guess FU to the fact that the holidays are now totally, truly over, and so traffic will be bad once again tomorrow.
8343332	8345374	And that when it rains, nobody knows how to drive.
8345574	8346154	Come on, people.
8346174	8347795	It's been raining since the dawn of time.
8348335	8349696	We should know how to drive in it by now.
8350317	8350817	Seriously.
8351578	8351938	Stop it.
8355373	8356334	That's it for the FUs of the week.
8357014	8367961	Let's do a couple more news stories and then we will start taking your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or you can call us via Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to call us there.
8368021	8369382	But first, two more stories.
8369542	8369802	Loki?
8370103	8379629	There was some concept art that came out for an unpublished hero title from Activision, of course, Sing Hero, which was, I believe, one of the trademarks that they had
8380249	8405793	Filed a while back in 2009 it looks like And of course, you know, that never happened Because, I don't know Maybe karaoke games weren't just that popular You are absolutely right I remember reporting on those trademarks And seeing Hero was one of them Because we all theorized about What Activision's karaoke revolution ripoff would look like So this really isn't a surprise
8406673	8415059	Yeah, and they have, you know, the concept art, and it looks like they've got, I don't know, a bunch of cliche-looking characters in there.
8417080	8429588	The artist that looks like she's wearing lingerie, and the teen queen who looks like she's Kelly Clarkson, and the rocker who looks like she shops at... Kelly Clarkson's like 30 now, though.
8429929	8430149	Well...
8431448	8432909	But I guess this game was a few years old.
8435610	8438711	It's just very okay, I guess.
8440712	8441172	Alrighty.
8441792	8443032	Well, I got a story.
8443333	8444793	Try not to get too upset, you guys.
8445413	8446514	I know you guys are big fans.
8446734	8449195	Although I have to say... Oh, never mind.
8449295	8450355	Sorry, real quick, real quick.
8450375	8451136	I just want to comment.
8451936	8455857	The showman that they have on there kind of looks like Captain Jack.
8456438	8458018	You know, minus the hat.
8458758	8459579	It looks like a very...
8462017	8462978	Maybe that or M. Bison.
8463018	8463519	I can't really.
8464700	8465821	I may be confusing those.
8466081	8468003	Go left, go right, go pick up track.
8468023	8468964	Go left, go right, go yay.
8469385	8469625	All right.
8471067	8473249	Try not to get too upset at this last story tonight, everybody.
8473649	8474570	Get your Kleenexes out.
8474730	8476352	This is going to be sadder than Les Mis, y'all.
8477745	8478545	Zynga Japan Mojitomo
8506920	8508121	and Montopia.
8508882	8509182	They're gone.
8509202	8510043	You know what Montopia is?
8510284	8510744	No, what is it?
8510764	8511765	It's a Pokemon ripoff.
8516210	8516750	Poor Zynga.
8517931	8520474	Oh yes, poor Zynga and their ripoff games.
8521055	8523457	Wait, you mean copying doesn't pay?
8525239	8528322	Hey, don't copy that floppy Zynga.
8528882	8530124	Copy kills music.
8531853	8535336	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username is OrangeLaunchRadio on Skype.
8535376	8537798	The Skype line is open now if you want to give us a call.
8538819	8542622	Meanwhile, I will turn to Loki for last-minute stories, although I'm not expecting he has a lot tonight.
8543142	8547386	There's some information about Valve's Steam PC.
8547466	8550929	It's supposed to be coming out in 2013, running on Linux, as we kind of all figured.
8552470	8563258	I guess it's being reported from this German IT site Golem and that one of the Valve engineers told an audience in Germany about this thing.
8564159	8567181	And I guess it's going to be revealed soon.
8567401	8569503	either at GDC or E3.
8569844	8572726	I would be surprised if it... GDC makes sense.
8574988	8580113	I was kind of hoping it'd be next week, you know, during CES, but... Let's get to the phones.
8580133	8580934	We got a call coming in.
8581515	8582596	Hi, you're on Orange Science Radio.
8582616	8583016	Who's this?
8585419	8586299	Yo, there!
8586340	8587220	Yo, OLR!
8587381	8589583	This is that one Aker Ripper from Sweden.
8589603	8590804	I haven't called you for like...
8591904	8592985	Oh, a few years.
8593385	8594726	I have fucking missed you.
8594906	8597167	I am so glad you are back, Aki Ripper.
8597287	8597587	Welcome back.
8597607	8599388	Good evening, of sorts.
8600729	8602369	What is on your mind, my friend?
8602509	8603110	Long time.
8604010	8606311	Yeah, long time no see, or here, whatever.
8608632	8609033	What's up?
8609273	8610894	Well, good question, of sorts.
8611614	8619678	I usually, well, you already did your Game of the Year things, of sorts, and I haven't done any, so what the hell?
8621052	8640412	uh well mostly because well what how many games do i actually play that i can count that i was thought was good this year usually i have to like cut a few and i would could cut a few fingers and it's like well i'm still having trouble to come up with a few so what the hell
8643126	8645228	You're not the only one that feels that way.
8645468	8653435	There was some game outlet, and I can't remember who, and I don't remember if it was an indie or a major, and I apologize, but they did not name Journey their game of the year.
8653475	8656537	They did not name Walking Dead their game of the year or any of that other stuff.
8656577	8658739	Their game of the year was nothing.
8659159	8662122	There was nothing out this year that deserved to be called game of the year.
8662262	8668247	I thought that was a pretty ballsy thing to do, although it might have just been to get more hits and to get people like me to talk about it on their shows.
8668767	8671409	But they said there is no game of the year.
8672430	8673751	Is that the camp you think you're in?
8675733	8681637	But... Like... But, oh, well, sort of, in some way.
8682018	8683179	Because, well, here's the thing, though.
8683199	8688903	It's like, in a way, though, in a way, actually, what was it?
8688943	8698430	Someone said on Gamelit, whatever, they said, well, the year can sort of be told as, like, a few huge disappointments of sorts.
8701374	8707896	Which, in a way, though, I would say that one of them was really a disappointment.
8708036	8712777	The other one, though, after all, in a way, not so much.
8717498	8720659	Well, tell me already, what would you say was definitely a disappointment?
8721747	8722228	Diablo 3.
8722988	8723789	Oh, God, yes.
8724249	8724910	I'm with you there.
8726912	8728493	Not that, but really.
8728794	8729434	Diablo 3.
8729754	8730015	Really.
8730295	8731476	What the fucking hell?
8732537	8733658	What the fucking hell?
8733758	8734579	I agree with you there.
8734599	8735740	That's exactly what I said.
8736941	8744288	The rage has already been passed on that, but we're just going to say that, yes, it was a major, major disappointment.
8745111	8756832	In a way, sort of like, well, I have this big fancy box of sorts, but I'm never going to play you anyway, because, well, I only played for a story, which means that, well, I'm going to play you once, and then it was fun of sorts, but...
8757882	8760062	Yeah, well, now what?
8760282	8766884	Grind, like, a few hours for, like, a few, actually, game days?
8767404	8768504	Fucking hell no!
8768924	8772405	That's what the internet said when they heard there was no LAN play in Diablo 3.
8772765	8773945	What the fucking hell?
8774065	8775845	That is exactly what the internet said.
8776405	8784827	But also, maybe it would be fun of sorts if I did have any friends to play it with, but since I don't, yeah...
8790281	8791322	I know you've got friends.
8791602	8792482	I know you've got friends.
8793243	8794643	You've got friends here at the OL Army.
8794723	8808069	Oh, well, not in the... But I didn't look that... Oh, well, not in the... Okay, well, not that way, but... I wasn't looking for a sort, but... Whatever.
8809269	8812910	Anyway, what the hell was a minor disappointment, too?
8813931	8816472	Once again, though, ME3 of sorts, but then...
8817999	8825103	In a way, they have quasi-repaired it of sorts since that extended cut of sorts.
8826083	8831766	And the DLC that's been released so far has been like, Thank you!
8831866	8834807	You should have said that from the beginning, you fucks!
8835668	8836028	Thank you!
8837578	8838539	You know what?
8839159	8845081	The problem with Mass Effect 3 is that that game got dragged over the coals by the internet for the ending.
8845502	8847382	You would have thought they shot the Pope.
8847923	8852665	You would have thought BioWare shot the Pope the way people reacted to the ending of that game.
8852685	8855166	And it's like, it wasn't that bad.
8855426	8858887	And it's like, thank God.
8859148	8862049	Square Enix should be thanking based God every day.
8862489	8863390	Thanks for watching!
8886434	8888536	Is that an unpopular game opinion, DarkSakura?
8888676	8890437	The ending of Final Fantasy VII is fucking garbage?
8892058	8892479	Not really.
8892639	8894020	What had the worst ending?
8894300	8898463	Mass Effect 3's original cut, which I know you've seen on YouTube, or Final Fantasy VII?
8898483	8899184	Final Fantasy VII.
8899724	8900164	Thank you.
8900625	8902926	Except, you know what the most disappointing part of that was?
8902946	8904488	Aerith's eyes opening.
8907245	8909047	Sorry, Ake Ripper, I just... Oh, well.
8910088	8912610	Well, other than that, no, I got nothing of sorts.
8912790	8926823	It's more like, hi, I'm still a... Hi, I do exist, actually, and for some strange reason, I decided to reuptake of sorts my activities on Monday... What is it?
8926863	8928044	Monday mornings, actually.
8928064	8931267	Because you're... Because, well, you...
8932598	8936582	Have your show on Monday morning in this time.
8936722	8938123	That's right, over there in Sweden.
8938143	8942747	Well, Aki Ripper, I'm tickled pink that you called into the show tonight, so don't be a stranger.
8943748	8944589	No, no, no, we won't.
8945009	8945590	All right.
8945810	8948713	But vi har es, as we say around these parts.
8950094	8950374	All right.
8950674	8950915	Later.
8951135	8951935	Take care, my friend.
8952475	8952756	Bye-bye.
8952776	8953296	Yeah, later.
8954096	8955557	You know, I need to plan a trip to Sweden.
8955597	8959840	Not only will I visit my friend, Ake Ripper, but the ABBA Museum is opening this year.
8960320	8961140	I'm just saying.
8961461	8964743	Girl, I'm just saying.
8964763	8969085	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you would like to give us a call.
8969125	8970446	Did you have other last-minute stories?
8971452	8971712	No.
8972152	8972432	Okay.
8972853	8973813	I do have some Twitter topics.
8973873	8983916	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send some Twitter topics, which looks like Tigerclaw is the only one remembering to send these, but maybe I'm not plugging it enough in the show.
8984036	8984376	I don't know.
8984777	8986497	But he does send us a couple of news stories.
8987537	8988518	One of them I want to read here.
8989258	8992120	Majesco Boston has closed.
8992220	8993340	Oh, how did we look over that?
8993380	8994301	That is unfortunate.
8994961	8996962	Yeah, Majesco Boston did close.
8997663	9002405	This was a senior producer in a Facebook update said, I enjoyed my time at Majesco.
9002785	9007168	I hate that it ended so abruptly with the whole studio closing, but that's the way the industry is.
9007708	9009089	Anybody need a design director?
9010778	9011820	Sorry to hear about that.
9011860	9013162	You have to hire me first.
9013503	9014364	During the holidays.
9015386	9015887	Bastards.
9016468	9017409	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9017429	9017790	Who's this?
9018972	9019293	Ranma.
9019313	9019954	Who else would it be?
9020014	9020675	Ranchan!
9020695	9021456	Hey, Ranma.
9021537	9022138	How you doing?
9022890	9023671	I'm doing good.
9023691	9024391	How about you?
9024531	9024992	Good.
9025152	9026973	Were you convention going this weekend?
9027013	9029935	Were you at the, what was it, MAGFest?
9030136	9032617	Do not get me started on MAGFest.
9032718	9035360	I was supposed to go, but I didn't go.
9035800	9036881	Ooh, you sound a little ruffled.
9036921	9038422	All right, I will not go there.
9039162	9040944	Ruffled does not mean to describe.
9041004	9048389	And if you've been following my private journal and so forth, you can kind of see posts in regards to why.
9048449	9050911	But if it's your private journal, how am I supposed to follow it?
9050951	9051572	It's private.
9052165	9053106	But you're on the list.
9053787	9054607	You're in the inner circle.
9055068	9055348	Okay.
9055488	9056109	Oh, I'm special.
9056409	9056649	Yay.
9059172	9060212	So what are you calling about tonight?
9060853	9063836	I just want to say that Zelda 2 is the best Zelda game of all time.
9064810	9065510	Blasphemy!
9066251	9067351	Blasphemy nothing.
9067391	9069492	It was an awesome side-scroller for what it was.
9069512	9071233	You and my husband agree.
9071933	9073774	Zelda 2 was pretty awesome.
9074134	9077495	And part of the fact that it's awesome is that it's hard as hell.
9078175	9082077	If you beat that game when you were 9 or 10 years old, you're rad.
9083462	9085805	Hey, you want to know the main reason why Zelda 2 is the best one?
9085905	9086145	What?
9086786	9087767	You have a jump button.
9089710	9090130	Zing.
9090791	9092693	But, I'm sorry, Link to the Past.
9093013	9093594	All the way.
9093995	9094535	Link to the Past.
9094555	9096077	See, that gets a number two in my book.
9096498	9096598	Ugh.
9097779	9098840	Zelda 2 is pretty good, though.
9098880	9099401	Don't get me wrong.
9099421	9100142	Yeah.
9100302	9120668	and I don't as much as before everybody sends in all the hate mail again I'm not calling Ocarina of Time a bad game necessarily but just the wank on the internet about that game I don't know maybe I'm just old I'm old and I don't get it I'm out of tune but I think Zelda A Link to the Past was just an amazing gaming experience start to finish
9121348	9122208	Oh, it is, but you know what?
9122449	9126431	I'm an anime fandom, I'm getting old, and I don't understand what the hell's going on there either.
9126751	9130633	I just show up, take pictures, go back to the room and party, and that's it.
9132273	9134334	What cons are on your calendar for 2013?
9135235	9143279	Well, this weekend we have Katori Cons, a small convention on a college campus, and I think we are on break till PAX East.
9145933	9148374	Pax East would be fun, but I don't do traveling right now.
9148494	9149874	I'm hoping I can do Pax East.
9149894	9150234	We'll see.
9150294	9152195	I heard the media reg opened up, so I'll let you know.
9152715	9157777	But, you know, they have a local convention here in Sacramento, Sak Anime, and it's been blowing up.
9158157	9160438	They are finally officially in the Sacramento Convention Center.
9160458	9162298	They had something like 5,000 people this weekend.
9162418	9162958	That's good.
9163599	9165999	One of my friends, Kyle Hebert, he was there as a guest.
9166319	9166820	Oh, very nice.
9167380	9167660	Very cool.
9169479	9172021	Sadly, we didn't go.
9172181	9181548	Originally, I had been scheduled to volunteer, but then some things changed, and I didn't end up getting to do that, and it was my anniversary Friday anyway, so it kind of didn't end up working out.
9184070	9184350	Wow.
9184431	9189574	Well, I hope to see you at PAX East, but if not, maybe I can convince you to come to Fanime.
9189815	9190215	Maybe.
9190788	9199652	Well, I can't because I'll be going to Animazer because a friend of mine, she's retiring from cosplay, a complete Sailor Moon troop.
9200012	9203734	I'm showing up as Human Artemis, so yeah.
9203974	9206135	What about DragonCon?
9206155	9210898	Because I have not been asked, I've been told I'm going to DragonCon.
9211478	9217681	Well, if none of my peeps are going to AWA, which is at the end of the month in Atlanta, I may just show up at DragonCon.
9219614	9220555	Make it happen, bro.
9221335	9222236	We'll see what we can do.
9222276	9224017	We'll have to play The Boys Are Back in Town.
9226198	9232321	Before I let you go, anything to plug on Anime Jam Session coming up on your show that's on Tuesdays here at VOG?
9233082	9239065	No, not yet, but I didn't know I was going so long because I have an awesome gaming story to tell you from what's going on in my family.
9239125	9239766	Please, go ahead.
9240430	9250180	Okay, now my sister, she has a baby girl, and they were playing Kingdom Hearts together, so she gave my niece a controller that's not working so she can help fight the Heartless.
9251343	9258964	Okay, so after one of the battles was finished, my sister told her that they need to fight a few more so they can get more money to buy new armor.
9259264	9265085	So my niece went, oh right, she jumps up, ran to the kitchen where my sister heard something rummaging.
9265766	9273527	My niece comes back and dumps down a fistful of coins on her lap with a smile and says, let's go buy some more armors, mommy.
9274767	9275867	That is adorable.
9276587	9279388	Yes, and this kid is only two and a half.
9282881	9283982	Potential future gamer?
9284683	9285744	Oh, you got that right.
9286605	9287626	Well said, well said.
9288006	9288286	All right.
9288707	9291089	Well, Ranma, I should probably let you go so we can try to hit one more call.
9291429	9292510	But thank you very much for the call tonight.
9293191	9293571	Anytime.
9293712	9294392	All right, take care, buddy.
9294973	9295173	Later.
9296274	9298456	Later, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9298997	9301819	Or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.
9302700	9307064	Checking the Twitters real quick for one more Twitter topic because I know Tiger Claude sent us something else.
9308165	9314169	Ed, the FTC orders Google to stop charging high royalties on Frand-related patents.
9315250	9321674	There was a lot in the news this week about Google and so forth and antitrust decisions and all this stuff.
9322495	9331961	The FTC issued a consent order this week forbidding Google from charging a lot of money for certain critical patents it gained when it bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion in May 2012.
9333942	9346971	Good news for Apple and Microsoft, but particularly for Microsoft, because Motorola Mobility wanted to charge $4 billion a year in royalties for patents Motorola holds on Wi-Fi and video technology.
9348392	9349133	Let's go to the phones.
9349153	9350213	We've got more calls coming in.
9350474	9351334	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9351354	9351735	Who's this?
9354416	9355297	Hey, what is up?
9355377	9356838	And we even see video.
9356998	9357859	A video caller.
9357939	9358419	Good job.
9358459	9359440	Hey, how you doing?
9359860	9361842	Sorry, we don't have our webcam up.
9362202	9363563	But what is on your mind, my friend?
9364520	9365080	Nothing.
9365100	9367001	This is the first time I've actually listened live.
9367041	9368482	I usually listen to it as a podcast.
9368742	9368982	Yeah?
9369703	9369943	Yeah.
9369983	9372625	It's a different experience watching the chat go by.
9372865	9373185	Yeah.
9373285	9376507	It's like having that live commentary track we were talking about earlier.
9376527	9377967	You get to have that happening.
9378608	9380689	Yeah.
9380889	9384371	So what has been most different about listening live?
9384471	9385892	Just having the chatters or –
9387165	9392147	Well, the fact that I was listening live and then you picked up right away and I was confused what was going on.
9393027	9393968	It's a little weird at first.
9394928	9395628	That's how it works.
9395668	9397269	There's not a big delay, but it's there.
9397569	9399570	Well, what are you doing in gaming these days?
9399630	9401131	What kind of video games do you play?
9403311	9407813	I typically am a... I've been switching from console gaming to PC gaming.
9408153	9414496	I don't know why I'll even buy... When we have a big Steam sale, I'll buy a lot of Steam games and then
9416409	9419871	Even if I've already played them and beat them on Xbox, I don't know what I've been doing.
9420271	9426194	I was just going to say, Steam probably made you a PC gamer in a lot of the deals that you get on Steam.
9426734	9428915	So did you get suckered in this last holiday sale?
9429615	9430396	Oh, God, yeah.
9430636	9431336	Well, what'd you get?
9432745	9439626	Well, I got both the Hummel THQ bundle, the Hummel Indie bundle, and then like 10 other games on Steam.
9440307	9440567	Oh, boy.
9440587	9441687	I haven't even played most of them.
9441947	9443067	You're a PC gamer now.
9445368	9447008	Those consoles will be collecting dust.
9447368	9449088	But, you know, this is a big year.
9449449	9451249	We might have a new Xbox out this year.
9451329	9456270	So do you think the consoles might bring you back if we get, you know, a fancy new Xbox or what have you?
9457710	9460411	Oh, of course, because I'm not spending that much money to upgrade my PC again.
9460731	9461211	Yeah.
9462017	9464038	But you dropped $400 on the new Xbox?
9464818	9465218	Of course.
9467158	9467559	Nice.
9469279	9471800	So what kind of console games do you play?
9473240	9473940	Pretty much anything.
9474060	9476861	I nerded out for like two weeks on Far Cry 3.
9478061	9479502	That's been getting a lot of good feedback.
9480742	9482323	What is it about Far Cry 3 you enjoy?
9482383	9484063	I think, Loki, you're a fan of Far Cry as well, right?
9484563	9485163	I got bored of it.
9485343	9486044	You got bored of it?
9486384	9487404	Yeah.
9488344	9488924	Let me go back.
9489445	9490625	What was Loki doing wrong?
9491499	9495003	You weren't placing mines in front of boars and making them run towards you.
9496004	9496865	I was not doing that.
9496885	9498627	I should be doing that.
9499708	9500429	Maybe next time.
9501810	9502131	Yeah.
9502971	9504513	Or killing tigers with bow and arrow.
9504673	9507717	That was the worst, worst mission ever.
9508738	9510700	What game are you most looking forward to in 2013?
9510760	9510940	Probably...
9514773	9515573	Bioshock Infinite
9536095	9539637	Well, StealthPoke, anything else on your mind tonight before I let you go, buddy?
9540197	9541517	Nope, just thought I'd call in.
9542158	9542558	All right.
9542578	9543158	Well, you made it.
9543598	9544339	Tell all your friends.
9544599	9544879	All right.
9545819	9546039	All right.
9546079	9546540	Take care, buddy.
9547000	9547220	Thanks.
9547560	9547840	All right.
9547880	9549301	Thanks for the video call as well.
9549361	9550101	You're a good listener.
9550141	9550902	We like the video calls.
9550942	9551402	Take care, buddy.
9551942	9552302	You too.
9552442	9552742	Bye.
9553923	9555404	Excellent job by StealthPoke.
9555904	9556564	Great first call.
9556684	9557004	All right.
9557545	9559285	I think that is going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9559365	9563047	I'm very sorry to those of you that didn't get through, but consider sending an email with your thoughts.
9563127	9564888	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
9565328	9591698	or send us a tweet in the future twitter.com slash OLR and I think with that we're going to start to wrap up the show I know it's not as long of a show as last week but come on guys last week's show was like practically a marathon did you know actually last week's was the biggest mp3 I've ever put to the server because the marathon show the proper one a couple years ago was split up into three parts so last week's show was the longest show we've had outside of that marathon so food for thought
9592558	9593439	So it's a little short.
9593479	9595741	It's a little under three hours this week, but that's all right.
9595761	9597363	There was a little less gaming news as well.
9597423	9605311	It's kind of still a slow week because people take the rest of this week off for the holidays sometimes too because the kids are still off from school or what have you.
9605371	9613680	So I think things will be back into full swing next week as we ramp up towards the big release of games such as Bioshock Infinite, as our last caller mentioned there.
9613860	9616401	Devil May Cry coming out very soon.
9616441	9617302	I know Tomb Raider.
9617602	9620343	We got big news over the holiday about multiplayer and Tomb Raider.
9620643	9622764	A lot of the internet was raging against that.
9622924	9627586	I'm not sure I get it because multiplayer only made Mass Effect 3 better.
9627966	9628487	But we'll see.
9628627	9629027	We'll see.
9629807	9630788	We'll see when the game comes out.
9631488	9636730	So be sure to send us an email and let us know what you think of the upcoming games and what you're looking forward to.
9636850	9645033	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com And before I go around and get everybody's final thoughts, we always say it here on the show, we really mean it.
9645673	9647594	We don't ask for your money to do this program.
9647734	9648635	But you can send it to me.
9652136	9654258	We don't try to sell you anything or what have you.
9654378	9657479	All we ask, if you enjoy the show, help us spread the word.
9657560	9659160	Bring more people into our family.
9659501	9661682	Get more people like StealthPoke to listen live.
9663003	9668626	You can always tell a friend about the show on social media, Facebook and Google Plus and so forth.
9668946	9670587	Leave us a nice review on iTunes.
9670647	9671728	That always helps us well.
9672048	9676711	Thumbs up in Stitcher and listening to us in Stitcher and giving good feedback there helps our ranking there.
9677191	9679172	All of it really goes a long way.
9679272	9681334	Please help us spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.
9681694	9683515	We really, truly appreciate it.
9683935	9686837	All right, now's the time where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9687337	9687998	I'll start tonight.
9688378	9693061	My final thought is, Jamie, you are an evil, evil, evil woman for bringing that peppermint bark into the house.
9693121	9693781	It was so delicious.
9693841	9694341	You're welcome.
9694561	9694802	All right.
9695442	9696523	Dark Sakura, your final thought.
9697423	9697943	I don't have one.
9698884	9700505	Oh, an apathetic final thought tonight.
9700545	9700925	That's all right.
9701245	9702206	Reject false icons.
9703347	9704047	I'll do that for her.
9704547	9705628	Loki, your final thought tonight.
9706429	9708932	Skyrim is going to be really goofy once I get playing it.
9709112	9711954	I've got a lot of weird mods I'm going to put on this thing.
9712955	9715898	All right, you'll have to post some lulzy pictures up on the chat.
9716078	9717499	VOG Minecraft is still going, yes?
9717779	9720202	Yeah, VOG Minecraft is going, although I haven't played it all this week.
9720542	9721663	I'm probably going to go back at some point.
9721683	9725006	I'm just time splitting between 40 different things.
9725146	9729590	And by the way, check your Twitters because there's a podcast inviting you on.
9729670	9730451	I saw on the Twitters.
9731349	9733490	I actually have a question for you about this server.
9733530	9736612	How do you put up a sign that shows where your area is?
9737332	9739413	Oh, it's a command you have to do.
9739473	9743015	I don't know if everyone has permissions to do the Dynamap stuff, but I can do that.
9743316	9751680	Well, if you found my little burrow in the ground, then it's near the big sign in the center of the map.
9751949	9754570	I'll add permissions if I haven't done that already
9781162	9787083	thank you for supporting independent podcasting, you guys are awesome we love the OL Army, goodnight
