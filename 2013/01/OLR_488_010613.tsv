7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	20000	Tonight, January 6th, 2013. Could Sony be planning to block used games on the next PlayStation?
20000	27000	New hacking progress is made on the 3DS. And could being an MMO player make you a better employee?
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	35000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week.
35000	41000	The 1st of 2013 of Orange Lounge Radio. The show where every gamer has a voice.
41000	45000	We are here live at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com
45000	49000	Where we do tape live every Sunday night. 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
49000	52000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
52000	56000	My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining you over the next few hours. Joining you.
57000	66000	Slow down Rob. I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and gamer fun with my co-hosts.
66000	70000	And gamers suck maybe. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
70000	72000	Gamer cock.
72000	73000	Gamer cock?
73000	74000	No.
74000	76000	I don't know what kind of show you're co-hosting.
76000	79000	Well, one that involves 3D. No.
79000	81000	But I bet it has a lot of subscribers.
81000	84000	Also joining us, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
84000	85000	Hello.
85000	86000	Techmaster Loki?
86000	87000	I'm doing fine.
87000	90000	Alright. Good times. So here we are. 1st show. 2013.
90000	95000	I hope you all had a safe New Year. Obviously you must have because you're here listening to the show tonight.
95000	97000	Be it in its live form or in its podcast form.
97000	100000	There was a lot of crazy shit that went down on New Years.
100000	105000	I know especially in this neighborhood. Well not like this very neighborhood but in SAC.
105000	108000	I think this was all over the international news or something.
108000	112000	They had those shootings in Old Town and what a bunch of fuckery.
112000	117000	Like leave your guns at home on New Years. Seriously. Why do people feel the need?
117000	120000	Like I know there's second amendments blah blah blah. I don't want to get into the gun debate.
120000	125000	But why do people feel the need to fire their guns on December 31st?
125000	128000	Some of them was shot at at McDonalds around the corner from my house like a couple days ago.
128000	130000	Stop shooting people.
130000	133000	If I was at McDonalds I'd shoot myself too.
133000	135000	Too soon?
135000	137000	Loki, how was your McDonalds that you brought to the show tonight?
137000	139000	It was delicious.
140000	145000	Also the New Years always means that Consumer Electronics Show right around the corner.
145000	147000	So CES is starting this week.
147000	150000	Not usually a lot of video game news out of CES.
150000	152000	You get some things once in a while.
152000	155000	Like I remember Game Room on the Xbox 360.
155000	158000	That was a Consumer Electronics Show announcement a couple years ago.
158000	163000	But now that we see that video game devices are becoming more and more prevalent.
163000	166000	Like these entertainment boxes that are in the living rooms.
166000	172000	You might expect to see a little more about the other stuff that consoles do at Consumer Electronics Show.
172000	174000	I don't really know what that is.
174000	176000	But it might be very interesting to keep an eye on it.
176000	180000	Even with Microsoft's reduced presence and Sony and so forth.
180000	184000	It would be interesting to see what kind of direction they're going in as a company.
184000	187000	Might be dropping some hints about the next gaming systems.
187000	189000	Loki, any thoughts?
189000	192000	Do you think we could get any major gaming news at a Consumer Electronics Show?
192000	197000	I know they're supposed to be doing the stuff for Disney Infinity this week.
197000	199000	So there should be an announcement of that.
199000	201000	Because it's tech sort of.
201000	204000	Okay, because Skylanders technically is not just the game.
204000	207000	It's all those little figurines too.
207000	209000	So they have probably that.
209000	221000	Maybe you might see something in regards to the whole streaming IPTV stuff that Microsoft's planning on rolling out.
221000	226000	Because that seems a little bit more par for CES.
226000	232000	Obviously some stuff new, maybe Android tablets, that kind of thing.
232000	234000	That's pretty much it.
234000	239000	I mean, I can't really think of anything really, really big that would be announced.
239000	242000	Wasn't Sony working on some type of network like that too?
242000	243000	I don't care.
243000	246000	They probably all are, honestly.
247000	252000	Have you played around a lot with the TV thing on the Nintendo Wii?
252000	253000	Oh, you don't have a Wii U.
253000	255000	Yes, I totally have.
255000	256000	Have you read about it?
256000	257000	I watch TV all the time.
257000	258000	No, you know what I mean.
258000	261000	Like the little service, the TV thing on the Wii U.
261000	262000	How much have you read about that?
262000	264000	Because it's pretty interesting.
264000	268000	And it makes me think of the whole consumer devices and stuff.
268000	274000	If I remember correctly, it's basically sort of like what I have with my box seats.
274000	277000	Okay, I want to watch The Office.
277000	281000	And then it's like, okay, you can watch Office on Hulu, you can watch it on Netflix,
281000	285000	you can download episodes from Vudu or something like that.
285000	290000	Or it's live on Channel 3 right now and press this button to flip your TV to check.
290000	295000	Because not only did you spend $350 on a Wii U, but it's a brand new universal remote.
295000	299000	I don't know if you knew that, but it also does those functions with all the infrared and such.
299000	306000	So yeah, the boxy box that I have, which is very obsolete now.
306000	311000	I actually went to Walmart the other day to get some things in.
311000	314000	First thing I did, of course, is check to see how many Wii U's are sitting there.
314000	315000	And there were eight.
315000	321000	So, you know, kind of going back to that, they're not flying off shelves
321000	326000	because they're sitting on shelves.
327000	332000	But I noticed they have a new boxy box, which I'd never fucking buy that.
332000	336000	And I recommend anybody that's thinking about a streaming box, do not buy the fucking boxy.
336000	338000	It is fucking terrible.
338000	342000	Although right now it works alright for Netflix and I like the remote.
342000	346000	And you can stream porn on it pretty easily because they have porn apps that people have made for it.
346000	348000	So it's fantastic for that.
348000	349000	Well, thank God.
349000	352000	Hey, it's got to have some good features to it.
352000	355000	Even this weird, like, I don't know what nationality is.
355000	360000	It comes in HD and it's like, it's like Skinamax all the time.
360000	367000	It has that look of like possibly porn channel and there is some nudity there, but they never really.
367000	372000	It's kind of like, OK, we're watching hot women in skimpy clothes playing darts.
372000	374000	It doesn't make any sense.
374000	375000	Dead or alive beach volleyball.
375000	377000	No, it's just weird.
377000	383000	But we like to look at that every now and then and go, OK, what non-sex things are they doing on this channel?
383000	392000	Anyways, but yeah, so mainly for Netflix, although it's slow and I'm sure there's other things out there.
392000	394000	Although I hear the Ouya works.
394000	401000	In fact, there's actually been a lot of videos showing the Ouya and stuff and using different Android applications on there.
401000	405000	They showed OnLive and how that works out and it works out pretty good.
405000	411000	And also, I forget the program, but it's basically Xbox Media Center.
411000	415000	It's called something else on Android, but that works pretty well.
415000	420000	So you may be able to use that as a streamer as well.
420000	421000	I'm kind of looking forward to that.
421000	426000	But yeah, I haven't really messed around too much with the TV app, but I mean, it looks all right.
426000	428000	I mean, they better work well.
428000	430000	I mean, that's one of the things they're pimping out on it.
430000	433000	I want to introduce the ever present fourth guest on our show, the live chatters.
433000	436000	Hello to all you guys chatting along live with our show.
436000	442000	Live.vognetwork.com is the place where you can join the chat room and you can also check into the show live and so forth.
442000	446000	But if you are listening on the podcast feed, there'll be a hidden word somewhere within the show.
446000	450000	You can put that in at vognetwork.com and get your points later on in the week.
450000	455000	Because we want our live and our podcast folks to both be able to participate as much as possible.
455000	457000	But we love the instant gratification of live.
457000	461000	And we're talking a little bit about TV in the chat room right now.
461000	468000	One of the other parts of TV that I didn't bring up with you, Loki, is that when you watch the sports games and so forth,
468000	475000	you actually get the little play-by-play on the second screen and you can do the whole Miiverse liking and commenting.
475000	478000	Like so-and-so shot a three-point shot from down the court or whatever.
478000	480000	You can actually kind of participate with that.
480000	486000	Well, Tigerclaw in chat is telling me about, I guess they did something similar for Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve.
486000	490000	They were posting little screenshots and people were actually commenting.
490000	495000	And I was saying, Dick Clark's New Year's Eve, I understand it's the first year.
495000	500000	It was the Dickless Dick Clark's Rockin' New Year's Eve, unfortunately. I'm sorry to say.
500000	503000	Who hosts it now? Ryan Seacrest?
503000	505000	The Ryan Seacrest Rockin' New Year's Eve.
505000	508000	So we changed one dick for another.
508000	512000	It was the Dickless Dick Clark New Year's Rockin' Eve, rest in peace.
512000	517000	But I was saying it's really too bad they didn't do it for the Anderson Cooper, Kathy Griffin coverage.
517000	521000	Which always gives America a lot more to talk about the next day.
521000	522000	I love them.
526000	534000	Anyhow, let's see. Jason in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, didn't OnLive die?
535000	540000	Well, yeah, the company got bought by another company, but the service is still going.
540000	543000	It's not dead, it's just another company.
543000	544000	Under new management.
544000	548000	Yeah, pretty much. It's just that everyone likes to hype that crap up.
548000	554000	Oh, it's dead. No, it's still going. People don't focus on it right now.
554000	561000	But hey, it works. That's cool. And that's console games on your Ouya.
562000	564000	The more I hear about the Ouya, I am interested in it.
564000	568000	I did not back the Kickstarter because I was a little bit skeptical.
568000	570000	Some Kickstarters have not gone so well.
570000	576000	But if the Ouya continues to deliver the way people are saying it, it sounds like it would be worth checking out.
576000	579000	Well, hopefully I'll have mine in March.
579000	583000	Hopefully. Maybe. Possibly.
583000	586000	Probably. And at least I know I have one game.
586000	590000	Because I backed evil out, so whenever that comes out.
590000	593000	I might get the Shadowgate game on that. I don't remember.
593000	596000	I backed Shadowgate and I know I get it at least on the consoles.
596000	599000	But I can't remember if they said they were doing an Ouya one or not. I don't remember.
599000	602000	Anyway. Let's see. What else do I want to talk about?
602000	605000	Speaking of March, something I was looking at before the show was a calendar.
605000	608000	Tonight is the 489th episode of our show.
608000	611000	So assuming we don't miss any more episodes.
611000	613000	Because we took a week for the holidays off.
613000	616000	But assuming we do all our shows between now and episode 500.
616000	620000	That means episode 500 is March 31st of this year.
620000	623000	The night before April Fool's Day.
623000	624000	Good lord.
624000	627000	How appropriate for our big milestone.
628000	630000	We have no idea what we're doing for our 500th episode.
630000	632000	We have no idea. I mean we always talk about.
632000	636000	You know. We've been doing this ever since our show turned one year old.
636000	639000	Should we do a big celebration this year? Should we do something for five years?
639000	641000	Should we do something for ten years?
641000	643000	We never. It just ends up being another show.
643000	647000	So we'll see. If you guys have big ideas. What should we do to celebrate episode 500?
647000	650000	How should we. Keep in mind.
650000	654000	We're on a budget. This show has been done very low cost for a long time.
654000	656000	The budget is no budget.
656000	660000	That's right. You better be willing to back a Kickstarter if you start to go crazy.
660000	663000	We do accept BevMo gift cards.
664000	665000	At least I do.
665000	670000	We can build a fort out of. Actually that would be an appropriate way to celebrate episode 500.
670000	673000	We need to find a fort to broadcast from. I think that would be.
673000	675000	We could build a blanket fort.
676000	682000	Or as the certain individual that we saw a couple of days ago. We could just climb under a table.
682000	684000	Why don't you talk about that real quick? Because it is podcast related.
684000	685000	Yes it is.
685000	687000	And you guessed it on another podcast.
687000	689000	I did. Roundaboutly.
689000	693000	About a hundred times the subscribers. A thousand times the subscribers this show does.
693000	697000	But tell the story quickly about the podcast that you quote unquote guessed it on this week.
697000	703000	Well Rob and Alan were awesome and got me a ticket to go to the Smartest Man in the World podcast.
703000	707000	Which is the one that Greg Proops of Whose Line Is It fame is on.
707000	709000	You know he was also Mr. Conductor.
709000	710000	Whose line is it anyway?
710000	711000	Whatever.
711000	718000	He was also a voice in that black and white game with the hacking and slashing on the Wii with the commentary.
718000	719000	Mad World.
719000	720000	Mad World. Thank you.
720000	724000	But he was also Mr. Conductor on both the UK and the American version of Thomas the Tank Engine.
724000	728000	He was also a commentator in the Pod Race segment of.
728000	730000	That's right. He also hosted.
730000	731000	He does a lot of commenting.
731000	733000	He hosted the show Versus on Comedy Central.
733000	737000	You know I think they should really have him commentate more on fictional things.
737000	739000	That would be awesome.
739000	740000	Anyhow, Greg Proops is just.
740000	741000	Wouldn't that just be comment?
741000	742000	Awesome.
742000	743000	Can he like commentate on our show?
743000	744000	Wouldn't that just be comment?
744000	746000	No.
746000	749000	Because comment suggests singular.
749000	752000	Are you saying episode 500 should come with a commentary track?
752000	754000	I think it should.
754000	755000	Hold on.
755000	756000	All right.
756000	757000	Anyhow.
757000	758000	What do you mean hold on?
758000	759000	You were in the middle of the story.
759000	760000	I'm saying if commentate is an actual word.
760000	761000	All right stop it.
761000	762000	Okay it actually is.
762000	765000	But it means specifically for the purpose of an user sports broadcast.
765000	768000	So Greg Proops is awesome.
769000	773000	Well he came out first and shook everybody's hands.
773000	775000	And by then I was already into my second drink.
775000	776000	And.
776000	777000	Yeah classy guy.
777000	779000	Before the thing even starts podcasting.
779000	782000	You know he walks out into the audience and shakes everybody's hand.
782000	783000	And like.
783000	784000	He's really cool.
784000	785000	I was just like.
785000	787000	I actually met him once like 10 years ago.
787000	788000	I don't expect him to remember me.
788000	790000	So I you know I just kind of shook his hand.
790000	791000	I'm like hi there. Nice to meet you.
791000	792000	And he put you know.
792000	793000	Hi I'm Greg.
793000	794000	He was just very very kind.
794000	795000	Yeah.
795000	800000	Well I actually managed to get up there during the question segment after the long boring preachy part.
800000	804000	Which is actually my favorite part of his podcast ever because.
804000	808000	I think there's like very little he says that I don't agree with philosophically.
808000	813000	If you think this show is political too much you may not actually want to download Smartest Man in the World.
813000	815000	Oh download it anyway you learn something.
815000	817000	He does do his boring preachy part.
817000	820000	He knows more about baseball.
820000	824000	Than anyone I know especially the old Negro leagues.
824000	831000	I have learned because I actually was into some of that myself because Hank Aaron's from my hometown.
831000	834000	And you know I knew about Satchel Paige and loved.
834000	836000	All right quickly finish the damn story.
836000	848000	So anyway I get up there and ask him my question comparing modern day political action to the French Revolution and Russian overthrow when they overthrew the stars.
848000	850000	But he was he was fixated on your name at first.
850000	852000	Yes he was fixated on my name.
852000	858000	He said he couldn't hear my name at first so I said Jamie like the bionic woman except without superpowers.
858000	862000	And then he starts serenading me to Van Halen.
862000	866000	And I'm just sitting there going wow.
866000	869000	And then he.
869000	871000	He wrote you a letter.
871000	881000	He said something about like like if he said I don't remember what exactly he said but like you could write me a letter and I was like well I'd give someone else's right arm if you wrote me one.
881000	885000	And he laughed and started writing me letters like I'm doing it right now.
885000	895000	So he said ask your question and I asked my question and he had a discussion and it was really cool. You know it was almost pretty much what I expected him to say but I like having it out there.
895000	900000	And then he gave me a piece of paper that says thank you for being cool.
900000	904000	And he spelled my name right even though I told him it was like the bionic woman. Nice.
904000	907000	And I'll find the picture and link it to everybody.
907000	913000	Black Wolf in our chat room says so if I sing Van Halen to Jamie taking notes.
913000	927000	It's honestly not one of my favorite Van Halen songs but you know, anyhow, the podcast is not posted yet, but it is the smartest man in the world podcast it's on iTunes and all that, and you're just going to want to look for the episode that was taped
927000	936000	on the Sacramento punch line, which I think should be posted probably this Friday or next Friday he's a couple weeks behind production versus what's posted.
936000	940000	So we'll let you know well he was very much like Bobby.
940000	947000	Good job. Good thing I found on my Tumblr, it's gotten better though.
947000	955000	My Tumblr for people who don't know is kurotsubasa.tumblr.com. That's my main one is kurotsubasa. I'm not gonna spell the whole thing.
955000	959000	But if you look on my 1313 post pictures of...
959000	965000	Why don't you just ask Rama to retumble it on the... Can't you hit that button and it retumbles it?
965000	967000	I guess he could do it.
967000	969000	How can you do that on the Orange Lawns Radio account?
969000	979000	Yeah, well, the pictures are there, it's really cool, and also someone randomly friended me on Tumblr because she was there too.
979000	981000	Awesome. The internet, making the world a smaller place.
981000	985000	And then we found out that there's yet another friend of mine that you know from Rocky.
985000	990000	Yes. It's a small Sacramento after all.
990000	999000	Alright, anyhow. Let's get back to video games. So we wanted to plug Greg Proofs because he's the world's oldest hipster as I heard somebody say.
999000	1003000	Actually you heard that from me because it was from a discussion that Becky and I had at work.
1003000	1013000	Amazing. Alright, let's get back to video games and talk about the games that we have been playing this week in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week? Dark Sakura, yet again, why don't you start us off?
1013000	1014000	I played some shit.
1014000	1016000	Did you play Mass Effect?
1016000	1020000	Yeah, and I started another game on two while I'm still playing three, so whatever.
1020000	1022000	Did you play something besides Mass Effect?
1022000	1023000	Yes!
1023000	1024000	Oh my god!
1024000	1026000	Jeez, Rob.
1026000	1027000	Hold my heart.
1027000	1030000	My ears are still ringing from that exclamation.
1030000	1031000	Call the paramedics!
1031000	1052000	Anyway, I downloaded a cute little RPG called To The Moon, and it's actually really a sweet story so far, but you go into the past through this guy's memories to give him the drive in his memories that would send him to the moon, because that was his wish.
1052000	1062000	You basically grant dying people a wish inside their mind. And it's not that you're changing their thoughts or anything, but you're giving them a drive towards a singular goal in their life.
1062000	1066000	And so their memories will be altered as a result of it right before they die.
1066000	1076000	And it's really cool so far. It doesn't have any combat except when you start fighting a squirrel when you're roleplaying. It was cute.
1076000	1078000	And they're like, why are you attacking the squirrel?
1078000	1081000	Well, we were roleplaying. Stop being mean to the squirrel!
1081000	1083000	And the squirrel runs off.
1083000	1092000	So anyway, I played that. I started on Limbo, which that game pisses me off already.
1092000	1095000	It's very pretty, but difficult.
1095000	1102000	And I started on Assassin's Creed 2, but I'm not really getting into it so much.
1102000	1105000	I spent a lot of money on it, so I don't care.
1105000	1112000	And I played WoW. I actually did play some WoW. Nothing happened. It was boring.
1112000	1120000	I played something else, and I can't remember what it was. And it wasn't very Solitaire.
1120000	1122000	You already talked about To the Moon.
1122000	1124000	Yeah. Limbo.
1124000	1127000	Did you play that Giana Sisters game?
1127000	1130000	No, I haven't played it. Not this week.
1130000	1132000	There was another game that I started.
1132000	1134000	Is there any Walking Dead? I thought you said you were talking about that.
1134000	1137000	No, I bought it, but I didn't start it yet.
1137000	1141000	But the entire thing went on a Steam sale the last day of the sale.
1141000	1144000	So it was like six bucks, something like that.
1144000	1146000	Those Steam sales are pretty evil.
1146000	1153000	In fact, I sat down before the show started, and I was like, Loki, tell me why I should not buy Dark Souls right now for 20 bucks.
1153000	1155000	The Prepare to Die Dark Souls edition is 20 bucks right now.
1155000	1159000	And he's like, just get it on PlayStation 3. You can probably get it cheaper.
1159000	1163000	Sure enough, I look up on Amazon. It's a whole dollar cheaper on Amazon right now.
1163000	1164000	Yes.
1164000	1166000	Or I could just rent it.
1166000	1167000	Yeah, but then...
1167000	1170000	I could have it right this second through Steam.
1170000	1172000	How much would your shipping be on Amazon?
1172000	1174000	Free, because I have Prime.
1174000	1182000	Which, well, it's free in quotes. Technically, I paid for that, but I've already paid for it.
1182000	1184000	So whatever.
1184000	1186000	I can't remember, so whatever.
1186000	1191000	You got an awe from DDR Dollar Bill, because he's really into Assassin's Creed 2.
1191000	1193000	I have Assassin's Creed 3.
1193000	1202000	I realize a lot of you guys are very disappointed in it, but I saw one of Alan's relatives playing it on Christmas when we were over there.
1202000	1204000	And the multiplayer looked really interesting to me.
1204000	1209000	It's kind of like you try to blend into this crowd that's walking around.
1209000	1215000	You're trying to stealthy kill people, but it's like kill or be killed, so you try to blend into the crowd so you don't get noticed.
1215000	1217000	It's very cat and mouse, is what I heard it called.
1217000	1223000	The only reason I wanted to play Assassin's Creed 2 is because it's set in Renaissance Italy.
1223000	1229000	Which I still find it completely hilarious that the Renaissance started in Italy, but it has a French name, but anyway.
1229000	1235000	Because I studied a lot of the architecture, and I want to kill some Dometicis.
1235000	1239000	I really want to just punch some Dometicis in the face and stab them in the head.
1239000	1241000	Damn those Dometicis. Too many popes.
1241000	1243000	Too many Dometicis. Too many popes.
1243000	1247000	Well, a very good Gaming Week segment. It was that moment.
1247000	1249000	I played stuff.
1249000	1253000	That moment when Dark Sakura told me she played something other than Mass Effect.
1253000	1255000	And I was all like...
1257000	1261000	Ah ha ha ha ha. You lost your zing.
1261000	1264000	You just need to have that as a sound clip.
1264000	1269000	Instead of this weird bitch talking to this disgusting looking heart.
1269000	1273000	Actually, now I'm more interested in the commercial than I was my original joke.
1273000	1276000	He's making out with her laptop.
1276000	1278000	That's scary. Anyhow.
1278000	1280000	Rewind, take two.
1280000	1285000	That moment when Dark Sakura told me she played something other than Mass Effect this week, and I was all...
1289000	1291000	What?
1291000	1294000	Snake!
1294000	1296000	Loki, how was your Gaming Week?
1297000	1299000	It was okay. I didn't play a whole ton of stuff.
1299000	1301000	It was mainly just...
1303000	1306000	I don't know. Just kind of going through a few different games.
1306000	1310000	I think I played... Well, I definitely played some Final Fantasy XI.
1310000	1319000	Once again though, kind of going back to what I said last week is that it's definitely a lot more sparsely populated now.
1320000	1322000	So...
1322000	1326000	Like, I haven't really tried looking for a party, but there's no parties to be found.
1326000	1328000	I mean, I went to the...
1328000	1337000	I've been having to solo myself the entire way as a white mage, because I decided to pick a white mage to level first.
1337000	1345000	Because I figured out, hey, I'll get in the parties, and it'll be a good sub for a black mage.
1345000	1354000	And the problem is, I have to solo everything, and so I'm actually up to level 22?
1354000	1357000	But I'm like soloing myself in the dunes.
1357000	1360000	Soloing in the dunes. Never thought I'd be doing that.
1360000	1364000	And it's just very slow.
1364000	1366000	Maybe you just need to roll on another server.
1366000	1368000	Maybe the server you're on is just not good.
1368000	1371000	Like, I can't remember what server we rolled on, though.
1371000	1373000	It was... Don't laugh.
1373000	1377000	The fairy server is gone, but it got merged with another server.
1377000	1381000	I want to say it was Garuda. Don't quote me on that. Maybe one of the chatters know.
1381000	1386000	But we rolled there, just to laugh and say we were on the former fairy server.
1386000	1388000	But I don't remember what server it was.
1388000	1390000	Is Shane listening?
1390000	1392000	Shane, where did we roll on Final Fantasy XI?
1392000	1394000	I need to know. This is very important stuff.
1394000	1396000	I don't even know if it's gonna help, honestly.
1396000	1399000	It's been very sparse.
1400000	1402000	It is kind of funny, though.
1402000	1407000	The item I got for buying the collector's edition or whatever is fucking awesome.
1407000	1408000	Oh, the hat?
1408000	1410000	The hat. It's fantastic.
1410000	1414000	You get that sprint thing, which I'm not sure if that was just a Mog.
1414000	1417000	They have these weird things now. It's like Mog enhancements or something,
1417000	1421000	where you get treasure chests and crap now, which is a little weird.
1421000	1423000	And they have this thing where if I rested for a while,
1423000	1428000	I got this sprint ability where I basically run faster until I get attacked.
1429000	1430000	So that was kind of neat.
1430000	1433000	And then also, it has auto-rerace.
1433000	1437000	So literally, you could just die, raise yourself back up again.
1437000	1439000	You don't lose any experience, die again.
1439000	1442000	And I was doing that for a while because I got attacked by a ghost.
1442000	1444000	And I was like, oh, I could take care of this thing.
1444000	1447000	And it didn't really work out that well.
1447000	1450000	But yeah, so I've been playing that.
1450000	1454000	And I don't know if I will continue playing it after my free trial,
1454000	1458000	because once again, it's just very lonely on that server.
1458000	1463000	And I just don't know, because I took for granted a lot of the stuff
1463000	1465000	that I had done before when I first played it,
1465000	1468000	like getting your airship pass, getting your sub-jobs,
1468000	1470000	getting your advanced jobs.
1470000	1473000	It's just, that's a lot of time when you're not in a party.
1473000	1480000	Thanks to the wiki at finalfantasy11sclopedia.org, ffxiclopedia.org,
1481000	1484000	the Faerie server was merged into the Silph server.
1484000	1486000	That's the server we played on, Silph.
1486000	1488000	Oh yeah, that makes sense. Okay.
1488000	1492000	So yeah, I've been just playing that a little bit.
1492000	1495000	I'll probably, I don't know, I think I'm just holding on to it now
1495000	1497000	because I'm hoping that it'll go free to play
1497000	1501000	and there'll be a lot more people, hopefully.
1501000	1503000	So I'll just hold on to it for now.
1503000	1506000	And whatever, you know what, so even if I get only a month out of it,
1506000	1509000	10 bucks for Final Fantasy XI again, for a month is, that's nothing.
1509000	1514000	Just to have a flirt. Sometimes it's fun to flirt with an MMO you once loved.
1514000	1516000	Yeah, I mean, it's still fun.
1516000	1517000	Hooking up once again.
1517000	1519000	I wish WoW was worth it.
1519000	1521000	Remembering the good times.
1521000	1525000	So other stuff I played, I didn't really play a whole ton of Skyrim,
1525000	1528000	but I just kind of ran it to see if it'd run on my PC
1528000	1530000	because, you know, I hadn't actually run it yet,
1530000	1534000	even though I bought it last sale, the summer sale.
1534000	1537000	And yeah, it runs.
1537000	1540000	So now I'm downloading a ton of mods for it
1540000	1542000	thanks to the Steam Workshop.
1542000	1546000	And I also purchased the first expansion for it.
1546000	1551000	I didn't purchase that Hearthfire one yet,
1551000	1553000	but maybe I should. I don't know.
1553000	1556000	It's down to like $249, so maybe.
1556000	1558000	We'll see.
1558000	1560000	And then what else did I...
1560000	1565000	Oh, I got Sinamori today, but I didn't play that yet.
1565000	1567000	And then what else?
1567000	1570000	Borderlands 2, still playing some of that. Still lots of fun.
1570000	1572000	I'm glad they kind of got back into that.
1572000	1576000	And a little bit of Modern Warfare 3, still rocking that.
1576000	1581000	And yeah, I think that's pretty much it right now
1581000	1584000	because, I don't know.
1584000	1587000	I'm trying to go through and play some of these Steam games now
1587000	1590000	that I've gotten, because I've gotten a lot of stuff from sales
1590000	1593000	and the Humble Bundles and stuff, and I'm trying to go through and see,
1593000	1596000	okay, which ones do I want to install? Which ones am I going to play?
1596000	1601000	I'm really psyched about getting, eventually, like a Steam,
1601000	1605000	like a PC for my TV, basically, that's really high-end
1605000	1609000	that'll have my Steam games on there and play big picture mode and stuff like that.
1609000	1611000	That's kind of what I'm gearing towards.
1611000	1616000	Kind of think of it as like the bomb shelter for the future gaming generation
1616000	1619000	that all falls apart.
1619000	1624000	I have a fallout shelter to go to to play some older games that are still good.
1626000	1628000	My Gaming Week.
1628000	1632000	I'm going to dedicate my gaming week to the fact that Dark Soccer is evil.
1632000	1633000	What?
1633000	1635000	My gaming week, you're evil.
1635000	1637000	All right, no, this is what it's really about.
1637000	1640000	Last week, you know the classic game of the week that you do every week, right?
1640000	1641000	Yes.
1641000	1643000	Last week you talked about Gyruss, and I mentioned,
1643000	1646000	because somebody joked in chat, like, oh, they should make an HD version of that.
1646000	1649000	And I'm like, they did, dude, like four years ago.
1649000	1651000	And it's on Xbox Live Arcade.
1651000	1654000	So this week I went and played Gyruss on Xbox Live Arcade.
1654000	1656000	And then that got me on this kick of like,
1656000	1660000	look at all these old-ass games I bought like four years ago.
1660000	1663000	I own over 100 arcade games on Xbox Live.
1663000	1665000	So I just started playing a lot of random shit.
1665000	1668000	I started playing like Pac-Man and just old stuff,
1668000	1670000	trying to see if I could get any new achievements.
1670000	1673000	And I'll tell you what, I did get a new achievement this week
1673000	1678000	on an old game I purchased many years ago, Geometry Wars 2,
1678000	1681000	which, by the way, is still an awesome frickin' game.
1681000	1685000	Like, if you are a more recent Xbox buyer,
1685000	1689000	go look on the Xbox Live Arcade and go get Geometry Wars 2,
1689000	1693000	which was like seriously one of the best twin-stick shooters I think they ever put out.
1693000	1695000	The original Geometry Wars is great too,
1695000	1697000	but Geometry Wars 2 has all those different modes.
1698000	1700000	But I'm trying to get this one achievement, Treaty,
1700000	1704000	like still to this day, driving me bonkers.
1704000	1709000	In King mode, which is where you can only fire bullets from safe zones,
1709000	1714000	you have to cross through 30 safe zones without firing a single bullet.
1714000	1717000	I can't tell you how many times I got to 29.
1717000	1720000	And I'm about ready to throw that controller at my TV.
1720000	1722000	But I haven't got it yet.
1722000	1724000	TigerClanChat asking, what achievement did you get?
1724000	1726000	I got the one that's called Rebound,
1726000	1728000	where you fire all the shots off the little bars
1728000	1730000	that usually you fly your ship through and break,
1730000	1733000	but you can also fire bullets off of it, reflect it,
1733000	1736000	and you kill like 75 enemies by doing that and you get an achievement.
1736000	1737000	That's the one I got.
1737000	1740000	And AlphaCananagram agrees, Geometry Wars 2 is amazing.
1740000	1742000	Yes it is. Very much is.
1742000	1745000	So, thank you DarkSakura for the amazing week in Retronis.
1745000	1748000	I even played Game Room a little bit last week.
1748000	1751000	I was playing like Atari 2600 stuff too. Crazy, right?
1751000	1754000	Let's see. In newer fangled games,
1754000	1757000	I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft this week
1757000	1758000	because there's been a lot going on.
1758000	1760000	I'll get into that more on Horde House this week.
1760000	1763000	But I did hit my second max level character.
1763000	1766000	I now have a level 90 priest, was my first one,
1766000	1768000	and now I have a level 90 monk, is my second one.
1768000	1770000	The new class, which is great.
1770000	1772000	So, yay!
1772000	1775000	Otherwise, not a whole lot else.
1775000	1777000	Forza Horizon, some other stuff,
1777000	1780000	but nothing else to really talk in depth about.
1780000	1782000	Maybe next week.
1782000	1785000	Going to RawsteelUT.
1785000	1788000	Yeah, too bad Bazaar got fried by Blur.
1788000	1790000	Was it Blur or was it the 007 game they made?
1790000	1792000	It was probably both, unfortunately.
1792000	1795000	It really sucks that they got the plug pulled on them
1795000	1798000	because Blur was not as bad as everybody made it out to be.
1798000	1801000	The 007 game is Activision's own damn fault.
1801000	1805000	They put a 007 game out before Modern Warfare 3.
1805000	1807000	I think it was Modern Warfare 3.
1807000	1809000	No, Modern Warfare 3 was Goldeneye 007.
1809000	1815000	So, it was Black Ops before Black Ops.
1815000	1818000	Come on, you really think that they know better
1818000	1820000	that it's going to just eat?
1820000	1822000	No one gives a shit about that
1822000	1824000	when Black Ops is coming up next week.
1824000	1827000	Let's see, Black Wolf in chat says,
1827000	1829000	in new games I played World of Warcraft.
1829000	1832000	Okay, World of Warcraft Mists of Pandaria.
1832000	1834000	Excuse me.
1834000	1837000	Black Wolf also says, fuck Game Room.
1837000	1839000	Well, not so much fuck Game Room,
1839000	1843000	but fuck Microsoft for closing Chrome Studios and ending Game Room.
1843000	1845000	And fuck Game Room for not being as good as it should have been.
1845000	1849000	And fuck the fact that we could have had this awesome retro...
1849000	1850000	I'm not going to...
1850000	1852000	And fuck the fucking fuckers.
1852000	1854000	Yeah, what she said.
1854000	1857000	All right, let's talk a little bit of housekeeping
1857000	1859000	and then we can get into the news tonight.
1859000	1860000	And housekeeping, of course, join us on Twitter.
1860000	1862000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
1862000	1864000	And you can also join us on Facebook.
1864000	1866000	Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
1866000	1868000	I also want to give a nice plug to this other show,
1868000	1872000	as I tend to do when other shows are kind enough to invite me on their show.
1872000	1875000	This show is called the Down for Maintenance podcast.
1875000	1876000	Excuse me.
1876000	1878000	It's a newer show.
1878000	1879000	You'll have to excuse me.
1879000	1881000	I don't remember if they have a full website.
1881000	1884000	I know they are available on iTunes, so you just search for Down for Maintenance.
1884000	1888000	And you can find the episode from January 5th that has me on it.
1888000	1892000	And they were very kind, very nice, asked me a lot of questions.
1892000	1894000	And I got to talk not just about video games,
1894000	1896000	but they asked me a lot about how I got into podcasting.
1896000	1899000	So, if you want to hear the full, long, very long, very long story,
1899000	1902000	check out Down for Maintenance podcast this week.
1902000	1904000	Also, we talked about Disneyland quite extensively.
1904000	1907000	So, I like the fact that we just rambled on all these awesome topics.
1907000	1910000	So, a good bunch there at Down for Maintenance podcast.
1910000	1914000	And their Twittersies is the DFM podcast.
1914000	1916000	So, you can follow them on the Twitters.
1916000	1919000	And they give them a shout-out on my personal Twitter feed as well.
1919000	1921000	Check that out.
1921000	1923000	Did Tiger Claw find their website?
1923000	1925000	Yes, that's the name of it. Down for Maintenance podcast.
1925000	1928000	Sorry, I can only see part of that in the window behind me.
1928000	1929000	It's on iTunes.
1929000	1934000	And when I say it's on iTunes, that means whatever podcasty program you're using,
1934000	1936000	it's probably on there too.
1936000	1940000	So, those things all spider out on the internet and find them all.
1940000	1942000	Big thanks to them.
1942000	1945000	If you have a podcast and you would like to have one of us on the show,
1945000	1947000	we love going on other podcasts.
1947000	1949000	We love being guests and so forth.
1949000	1952000	So, if you are interested, we like to think we're pretty accessible
1952000	1954000	on Twitters and Facebook and all that.
1954000	1955000	But if for whatever reason you're like,
1955000	1957000	I don't know how to get a hold of you guys,
1957000	1960000	mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want one of us to come on your show.
1960000	1963000	And we will redirect your mail to the appropriate person
1963000	1964000	and we can work out schedules.
1964000	1967000	But I don't know about you guys, but I love to go on other podcasts
1967000	1968000	and just talk about.
1968000	1971000	I totally love it too. All those invites I get.
1971000	1975000	Okay, Loki. Loki's begging for invites, you guys.
1975000	1978000	There you go. All right.
1978000	1979000	Let's get into some gaming news.
1979000	1981000	Loki, wow the internet with your knowledge
1981000	1983000	of what's going on in gaming right now.
1983000	1985000	Oh, please. I don't care, really.
1985000	1989000	Anyways, so, Microsoft has acquired R2 Studios.
1989000	1994000	R2 Studios happens to be the people behind such devices
1994000	1999000	that you would kind of see perfect for, like, smart glass.
1999000	2005000	Basically, it's sort of like home automation
2005000	2009000	and, you know, integrated into different devices
2009000	2012000	like tablets and phones and that kind of stuff.
2012000	2016000	So, the thought is that, hmm,
2016000	2019000	perhaps this is going to be rolled into some new things
2019000	2023000	that they're going to incorporate into, say, the next Xbox system.
2023000	2026000	Or perhaps some of the stuff that we've seen
2026000	2029000	in some of their kind of, I don't know if you'd really call them tech demos,
2029000	2034000	but like the view of the future, I guess,
2034000	2039000	where they have the PCs integrated into walls
2039000	2042000	that are being projected upon and stuff like that,
2042000	2044000	which I think that's actually pretty awesome.
2044000	2047000	I'd really like to see that kind of technology,
2047000	2049000	but I don't know how expensive that would be.
2049000	2051000	But they had something similar with that
2051000	2054000	where it's like kind of everything integrated into an interface
2054000	2057000	that looks good on your wall, I guess,
2057000	2060000	and it's a full wall interface type thing.
2060000	2064000	So, this seems to kind of give credit to that whole,
2064000	2066000	you know, we've heard the rumors before about the new Microsoft
2066000	2068000	is going to project shit all over your room.
2068000	2070000	Like, we've heard that before, right?
2070000	2072000	Does this kind of lend itself to that?
2072000	2074000	Well, I don't know if it's going to be the next system that's going to do that,
2074000	2076000	but they're definitely looking at technology
2076000	2078000	to do something similar to that.
2078000	2081000	And they've got, you know, something that has, you know,
2081000	2084000	where it projects stuff onto the walls.
2084000	2088000	I would imagine like some sort of ceiling mounted projector or something.
2088000	2093000	That would still be really awesome, even just for like a PC or something.
2093000	2096000	But I don't know how that would work.
2096000	2099000	I haven't gotten to actually see it other than in the videos,
2099000	2102000	so I'm not really sure how they would implement that kind of stuff.
2102000	2103000	But, yeah.
2103000	2107000	So, I mean, obviously, if these guys are, you know,
2107000	2111000	experts at like kind of home automation and entertainment,
2111000	2115000	then I would think that this kind of ties into all the rumors
2115000	2119000	that we've heard about, you know, the kind of direction they want to go with,
2119000	2122000	you know, the Xbox being this kind of center hub for entertainment
2122000	2126000	and, you know, integrating it more into your life, if possible, I guess.
2126000	2127000	Well, that's what these consoles want to be.
2127000	2130000	They don't just want to be a gaming center.
2130000	2133000	It wants to, well, it wants to be an entertainment center, I guess.
2133000	2136000	We've already, I mean, that really shouldn't be a surprise at all.
2136000	2138000	I mean, look at the systems you've got now.
2138000	2141000	When the Xbox 360 first came out, it really didn't do a lot of that.
2141000	2143000	I mean, a little bit, like, you know,
2143000	2145000	you used to be able to get like the trailers for movies.
2145000	2147000	You could download those types of things.
2147000	2150000	But now, like, it's really transformed into, you know,
2150000	2154000	it does Netflix, it does streaming, it does all this other stuff.
2154000	2156000	And now it's just going to go a step further.
2156000	2159000	You know, we see what TV does on the Nintendo Wii U.
2159000	2162000	That's just, you know, a hint that that's just Nintendo's little,
2162000	2165000	we're on our own little universe, you know, and their way of doing it.
2165000	2166000	Their own Miiverse?
2166000	2167000	Yes.
2167000	2170000	Well, they did have like, you know, that's, I mean, granted,
2170000	2173000	it's a lot more complex now, but they used to have, well,
2173000	2174000	they still have it.
2174000	2177000	It's just the Media Center integration was one of the first things
2177000	2179000	that they kind of put out there.
2179000	2182000	But, I mean, that's all they really had at the time was,
2182000	2185000	okay, you have the Windows XP Media Center edition or whatever,
2185000	2187000	which I had on my laptop.
2187000	2190000	My last laptop actually had that, which is kind of funny.
2190000	2194000	And occasionally I'd hit the button to go into it and,
2194000	2196000	oh, hey, that's right, this is on here.
2196000	2198000	But, yeah, that worked all right.
2198000	2201000	And so that's kind of like, you know,
2201000	2204000	they took it to the next level and then kept going.
2204000	2206000	I just, I want to see the further evolution of this.
2206000	2209000	I want to see what the next Xbox and the next PlayStation,
2209000	2211000	I want to see what they do that my PC can't.
2211000	2214000	Yeah, I want to see something new.
2214000	2216000	See, that's the thing is they need something brand new,
2216000	2218000	like, oh, it projects crap onto your wall.
2218000	2221000	That's something that you can't get with what it is, you know,
2221000	2223000	the technology that's out there right now.
2223000	2224000	I mean, projectors.
2224000	2226000	I just can't imagine that in my head.
2226000	2231000	I live in a planetarium and it projects images on the wall.
2231000	2234000	But maybe I'm not thinking about it right, you know?
2234000	2237000	Maybe in my mind I think, like, oh,
2237000	2239000	that means the image of the game is going to be all around.
2239000	2241000	But maybe it's not really like that, you know?
2241000	2243000	I don't even know if that would work feasibly.
2243000	2245000	Because, I mean, if you look at it, I mean,
2245000	2248000	not everyone's going to have walls that that would show up on.
2248000	2252000	And they may not be playing in a room that's necessarily going to work.
2252000	2255000	Well, but couldn't they, through the infrared technology,
2255000	2258000	be able to gauge the size of your room really quickly and adjust accordingly?
2258000	2260000	Maybe. I don't know.
2260000	2263000	It would just be interesting to see how they would do something like that
2263000	2268000	or how they would try to figure out other ways to immerse you.
2268000	2271000	That's really what it is, is they're trying to find more ways to immerse you
2271000	2273000	into whatever it is that you're doing.
2273000	2275000	As we say here on OLR quite frequently,
2275000	2278000	one step closer to the holodeck.
2278000	2283000	Everything that happens in gaming takes us one step closer to the holodeck.
2283000	2288000	Think about the progress we've made since the Atari 2600 and the Odyssey
2288000	2290000	and all those first generation gaming consoles.
2290000	2293000	Hell, with the Atari 2600, the holodeck didn't even really exist.
2293000	2296000	And then the next generation came out and everyone was like,
2296000	2298000	oh, hey, holodeck, that's cool.
2298000	2301000	So, yeah, we've made a lot of progress.
2301000	2304000	All right, well, one thing that won't be making any more progress
2304000	2308000	is sales of James Bond games on Steam.
2308000	2311000	Folks noticed over this past week that games from the James Bond franchise
2311000	2313000	were taken down from Steam.
2313000	2318000	And the early rumors had people going, oh, Activision is up to something.
2318000	2320000	Activision is pulling their games from Steam.
2320000	2323000	Activision is going to start their own origin.
2323000	2326000	No, no, it's just the licenses.
2326000	2329000	The licensing that Activision held for these 007 games,
2329000	2333000	they ran out on the New Year, so that's why they were pulled down.
2333000	2339000	So they originally got the license to do James Bond games in May 2006.
2339000	2342000	So the license was supposed to last until 2014,
2342000	2345000	but for whatever reason it ended, I guess, a little sooner,
2345000	2349000	or maybe it had something to do with the digital distribution and so forth.
2349000	2353000	Some of the games that were affected would have been, what, 007 Legends,
2353000	2357000	which was the most recent game, Bloodstone, and so forth.
2357000	2361000	Let's be real, none of these games were particularly memorable anyway,
2361000	2363000	so it's not like they're going to be missed.
2363000	2366000	Sorry, not sorry, it's just the truth.
2366000	2369000	There you go, they are no longer there.
2369000	2372000	007 GoldenEye Reloaded was another one that Activision did.
2372000	2375000	Remember when they tried to make Lightning Strike twice with GoldenEye
2375000	2377000	and it just didn't work out?
2377000	2379000	It wasn't bad either.
2379000	2382000	I remember playing it at E3 and I was like, yep, it's GoldenEye,
2382000	2384000	it's just a little different.
2384000	2388000	I don't remember him being in here. Where's Pierce Brosnan?
2388000	2390000	What's going on here?
2390000	2393000	So there you go, you can no longer get the James Bond games on Steam,
2393000	2397000	and I don't think that means anything bigger than
2397000	2399000	whenever that next James Bond movie comes out,
2399000	2402000	and there will be another James Bond movie for sure.
2402000	2406000	That franchise might have been in question before, but after Skyfall.
2406000	2410000	Isn't Skyfall now one of the largest grocery motion pictures ever?
2410000	2412000	It's like in the top 20?
2412000	2413000	Haven't seen it yet.
2413000	2414000	It is good.
2414000	2415000	I think I saw...
2415000	2418000	I hated the ending. I hated the ending.
2418000	2421000	I saw Casino Royale, I think.
2421000	2423000	Casino Royale was good.
2423000	2426000	Most of that... Was there one between that and Skyfall?
2426000	2428000	There was, Quantum of Solace.
2428000	2429000	I haven't seen that yet.
2429000	2430000	Alan summed it up perfectly.
2430000	2434000	He said that Skyfall was the sequel that Quantum of Solace should have been,
2434000	2438000	and I'd cosign that, because Casino Royale was supposed to be a reboot of sorts,
2438000	2443000	and Skyfall brings in elements of the Bond franchise
2443000	2446000	that we haven't seen since the Sean Connery days.
2446000	2448000	I won't spoil it for anybody, but just there's a lot of throwbacks
2448000	2450000	and little winks and nods.
2450000	2452000	One thing I could say that's not a spoiler,
2452000	2455000	there's a very subtle reference, very subtle reference to
2455000	2458000	shaken but not stirred when he orders his drink.
2458000	2459000	There's all these really...
2459000	2462000	And then there's some in-your-face references, too, and it's great.
2462000	2465000	And the Bond girl? Hot.
2465000	2467000	Actually, there's more than one Bond girl. They're all hot.
2467000	2471000	But the one in particular I'm thinking of that he meets in Macau or wherever,
2471000	2473000	like Hong Kong or wherever he's at?
2473000	2475000	Smokin' hot.
2475000	2476000	Hot.
2476000	2478000	Hot Bond girl. Just sayin'.
2478000	2481000	Way hotter than Denise Richards could ever dream of being. Sorry.
2481000	2483000	Better than Grace Jones.
2483000	2486000	Grace Jones just fuckin'...
2486000	2490000	Grace Jones will just demand your attention.
2490000	2493000	I love A View to a Kill. It's not a great movie,
2493000	2496000	but I love Grace Jones.
2496000	2498000	That woman is awesome.
2498000	2501000	It's one of those things that a lot of people don't really know about me,
2501000	2503000	but I really do like James Bond.
2503000	2505000	James Bond movies are just awesome.
2505000	2507000	I miss how cheesy they used to be.
2507000	2511000	The new ones are fine, though. The new ones are great in their own way.
2511000	2514000	And they don't really interest me, to be honest.
2514000	2515000	Yeah.
2515000	2519000	Because, I mean, I like a little more...
2519000	2522000	A little less action, a little more suspense.
2522000	2525000	If you want a cheesy Bond, you need to go see Live and Let Die.
2525000	2527000	That one's great.
2527000	2530000	I've seen Live and Let Die. It's the one that had Paul McCartney doing the opening.
2530000	2532000	Yeah, I've seen Live and Let Die.
2532000	2536000	That one's hilarious, the way the evil villain dies at the end.
2536000	2540000	So when are we going to get a sequel to If Looks Could Kill?
2542000	2544000	That was awesome.
2546000	2551000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
2551000	2553000	use the passphrase, glue.
2553000	2556000	All right, anyhow, after Bond, more gaming news.
2556000	2560000	Dark Sakura, our very own Bond girl, here on the show.
2560000	2562000	As if.
2562000	2565000	Sorry, I'm not about to run up on the beach in a white bikini with a knife.
2565000	2567000	She'll just run with a knife.
2567000	2569000	I'll just run with a knife.
2569000	2572000	I'll have, like, a really damp muumuu.
2573000	2583000	Anyway, there is a theory speculated that people can use the Wii U console to have extra games for free.
2583000	2588000	Basically what they're saying is that multiple players can make a separate user account on the Wii U
2588000	2592000	and buy games to the Nintendo eShop. They're linked just to the console.
2592000	2595000	And everyone who is on that console will be able to play them.
2595000	2602000	So the theory goes that you should be able to get an old one, a used Wii U,
2602000	2607000	and use all the games that have been downloaded on it for the users that are on there.
2607000	2610000	So that could be, I mean, it'd be kind of a hit and miss.
2610000	2613000	Oh, I'm going to get this used Wii U because all these games are going to be on it.
2613000	2615000	No, we didn't buy a damn thing.
2615000	2618000	You know, but there's a possibility.
2618000	2621000	Well, it's one way to make your Wii U look more attractive on eBay.
2621000	2624000	True. I have all these games. Buy it.
2624000	2626000	Whatever. Added bonus. Cool.
2626000	2630000	I didn't even think about that, but I just, when I heard about this, I was like,
2630000	2634000	Nintendo somehow did not anticipate the used market.
2634000	2638000	What's going to happen, can you, like, migrate your account from, like, one Wii U to,
2638000	2642000	like, say, for example, if, like, a bunch of people migrated their account to one Wii U,
2642000	2647000	and then, like, somehow, could you get, like, games from multiple accounts onto one system?
2647000	2651000	I don't know if you couldn't do it without Nintendo's involvement.
2651000	2654000	Like, that's how you did it on the original Wii.
2654000	2657000	If you had to, like, change, you know, the content and all that.
2657000	2660000	Like, I think it's something Nintendo had to do after a Nintendo repair.
2660000	2663000	I don't think it's something the user could easily do.
2663000	2668000	Unlike the 3DS, which is a little, but in the 3DS world, there's that very real possibility.
2668000	2672000	You have people that own the regular 3DSs that want to buy the 3DS XL.
2672000	2674000	They have to have something to transfer.
2674000	2677000	Just like they have to have something to transfer Wii to Wii U.
2677000	2681000	But what's the reality that somebody's going to buy a second Wii U?
2681000	2684000	At this point, not bloody likely.
2684000	2686000	So, I don't know.
2686000	2687000	I don't even have a first one.
2687000	2689000	But I didn't even think about that. You're right.
2689000	2693000	When I sell my console on eBay, now I can say, loaded with all these great games.
2693000	2696000	But you've got to wonder if it's not something Nintendo is going to patch out.
2696000	2702000	Maybe they didn't have it in place this early because they didn't think people would be selling their Wii U's this fast.
2702000	2707000	And by the way, I wouldn't read too much into that fact that Wii U's are already on the second-hand market.
2707000	2709000	I saw a friend on Facebook say,
2709000	2714000	Wii U's are already on the second-hand market? That doesn't bode well for the system.
2714000	2719000	I bet a lot of the Wii U's you're seeing on the second-hand market right now are actually promotional copies.
2719000	2724000	I bet it's a lot of people who got them early who didn't really want them in the first place.
2724000	2725000	That's where they're coming from.
2725000	2727000	We broke into GameStop.
2727000	2730000	You would have a couple, a handful.
2730000	2735000	We stole a pallet or truckload of Wii U's systems and so we're selling ours off.
2735000	2739000	The Wii U's that were stolen out of the warehouse wouldn't have these games preloaded on it.
2739000	2747000	And I would think a second, especially a promo Wii, is very likely to have, you know, it's going to be loaded with games on it already.
2747000	2752000	I think the only other way Wii U's are on the second-hand market right now is people, you know, desperate times call for desperate measures.
2752000	2758000	They have to sell them out of, you know, I was in a good financial place in November, but I'm not so much now.
2758000	2765000	So I'm looking at, there's actually, um, there's actually some systems actually on eBay.
2765000	2772000	Well, I mean, not a whole ton, but I see one right here that's got less than 24 hours left and no bids on it at all.
2772000	2775000	You're getting tempted.
2775000	2779000	No, I'm not. I'm honestly not getting tempted at all to buy a Wii U.
2779000	2786000	I'm just curious to see, I wanted to see what they were, if the gray market had actually dropped out that badly.
2787000	2791000	But no, not yet. There's still, I mean, what do you expect?
2791000	2797000	I would expect to see a whole ton of U systems, what, a couple months after launch? Does that make any sense?
2797000	2802000	Do you think that now that this is all over the internet, do you think this is something Nintendo's going to patch out?
2802000	2807000	What do you think, based on kind of how you've observed the company's behavior in the past, what do you think is going to happen?
2807000	2809000	Do you think Nintendo's going to patch this out?
2809000	2812000	I don't know if they can. I mean, why would this be in here in the first place?
2812000	2819000	If it's still tied to the console, then I don't know, I don't know if they are going to or not.
2819000	2827000	Regardless, you really, again, buying a U system, you're not going to have a way of knowing who has bought stuff,
2827000	2831000	unless you're buying your friend's Wii U and you've been there when they've bought stuff.
2831000	2835000	Oh dude, I'll give you 150 for your Wii U. Here.
2835000	2839000	Really, Nintendo has no way of knowing that the console's been sold in the first place.
2839000	2845000	All they're seeing is someone else is creating an account and they want to keep it so that you have multiple accounts can use the same game.
2845000	2851000	It's kind of like how the PlayStation 3 is, you know, where you can play on multiple different sign-ins.
2851000	2854000	Technically, doesn't the 360 work that same way as well?
2854000	2859000	Not sort of. They sort of do. I mean, there's limitations to what you can do there.
2859000	2863000	We cheated the system a little bit. Like, here in the house, we have two Xboxes, right?
2863000	2872000	So, here's what we did. My system has the online pass tied to my Xbox account for Mass Effect 3, okay?
2872000	2879000	So, what we did is I signed in to Alan's Xbox and I also get to use the online pass because it's tied to my account.
2879000	2886000	Mass Effect 3 is two discs. Multiplayer is on both discs. So, I signed on to Alan's Xbox and it let me use my online pass.
2886000	2893000	He signed on to my Xbox and he was allowed to use my online pass because it's on that Xbox, even though he's on his account.
2893000	2898000	And we were both able to play Mass Effect 3 multiplayer without having to buy two online passes.
2898000	2902000	This elaborate fucking system to save ten whole dollars, it worked.
2902000	2903000	Good.
2903000	2909000	Well, yeah, good. I mean, Alan and I are, you know, together. We've been together three years.
2909000	2913000	We're in the same household. We happen to own two Xbox 360s.
2913000	2918000	I plunked 60 bucks on the game. Why shouldn't we be able to play like a versus mode?
2918000	2923000	It's a little silly that we had to go to such extreme measures.
2923000	2925000	They're gonna send the police after you now.
2925000	2927000	Oh, come and get me.
2927000	2929000	Come at me, bro.
2929000	2931000	That's right, come at me, bro.
2931000	2938000	Alright, so, let's talk about more ridiculous ways to stop you from having fun and that kind of stuff.
2938000	2945000	So, Sony has patented a new technology. They'll basically tie RFID tags to a game disc.
2945000	2947000	So, it'll actually be inside the disc.
2947000	2960000	And what that's supposed to do is that RFID tag will be read by the game system and will basically lock the disc to the system so that you can only play on that.
2960000	2967000	Basically, think of it like an online pass for a game, but without actually having to enter any codes in or something.
2967000	2972000	So, it's gonna say, okay, this disc has been played on this system, so we're gonna tie it to that.
2972000	2978000	And if you play it on another system, the thought is, okay, well, it's just gonna be...
2978000	2984000	You're either not gonna be able to do that or it's gonna have some sort of limited functionality like no multiplayer.
2984000	2987000	You have to buy an online pass or something like that.
2987000	2994000	And everybody's flipping their shit going, you know, what the fuck, this is the end of the world, you know.
2995000	2999000	How are we gonna stop this? Let me put it this way. It's like this.
2999000	3005000	If they do this, this is gonna get hacked. This is basically like giving people an excuse to hack this console.
3005000	3012000	You think that hacking on the PS3 took a long time? Well, this shit is gonna take no time because people are...
3012000	3018000	The way they see it is anti-consumerist and so they will just go at it full bore.
3018000	3023000	If this were to really happen, Sony could kiss its ass goodbye in the console wars.
3023000	3028000	Honestly, because all Xbox would have to do is come out and say, our system doesn't do that.
3028000	3030000	You know, you have the right to do whatever with your property.
3030000	3038000	And then it's like, Sony might be able to score more exclusives in a way, but I think the user base would absolutely reject that shit.
3038000	3041000	You know, I just don't see it working at all.
3041000	3049000	Well, here's the problem too is if they find a way around it, all it's gonna do is, once again, it's gonna punish the actual legitimate buyers of that.
3049000	3054000	Here's an unpopular thought. I don't see a lot of people going down this road.
3054000	3059000	Didn't we have rumors before that the new Xbox was gonna do something like this?
3059000	3063000	That it was gonna have a burner in it that would tie the disks to your user ID?
3063000	3066000	Didn't this exact same rumor go around about Microsoft?
3066000	3067000	I think so.
3067000	3069000	Here's another thought too, okay?
3069000	3072000	Just to finish my thought, please let me finish my thought. No, that's okay.
3072000	3075000	But yes, those rumors went around before, right?
3075000	3076000	Yes.
3076000	3079000	Could this be a defensive patent by Sony then?
3079000	3082000	Sony patented it so that Microsoft can't do it.
3086000	3094000	I mean, I know we're all quick to jump to conclusions that it might be the worst case scenario, but could it in fact be the best case scenario?
3095000	3098000	I know, I know. I'm going out on a limb.
3098000	3106000	I think the best case scenario, and this is just, I don't know if this is gonna happen, but let's just say that they have a way that you can,
3106000	3113000	it's basically to verify that the game disk hasn't been pirated, like you haven't, it's a legitimate copy.
3113000	3120000	Because, you know, you can burn copies of disks and stuff like that and play them in systems, mainly on 360 and Wii and stuff like that, but it can be done.
3120000	3126000	So let's just say that this is to authenticate that there is, that this is a legitimate disk.
3126000	3133000	Although, I would think it'd be pretty easy to snap an RFID tag on there somehow, but let's just say that this is why they're doing it.
3133000	3138000	And then it stores that ID code or whatever in your system, and it ties the game to your system.
3138000	3146000	However, later on, say you want to get rid of that disk, or if it's a rental or something like that, then you'd be able to revoke your privileges.
3146000	3152000	Although, that wouldn't really work if you do that, because then the average consumer's not gonna know to do that when they rent a game, and so that wouldn't work.
3152000	3154000	It'll get hacked.
3154000	3160000	Okay, I love doing live shows. This is why. I didn't even think of this thought, and I think this is hitting the nail on the head.
3160000	3162000	I think this is a great comment.
3162000	3164000	Live.vognetwork.com, our live chat room.
3164000	3166000	Dungeon Buster, gold star for you.
3166000	3168000	Here's the comment.
3168000	3177000	It might also be used in a non-gaming situation to lock down things like content disks containing code, demo materials, libraries, etc.
3177000	3182000	that will be passed on to developers or used in public spaces like convention floors.
3182000	3185000	Brilliant. I bet that is exactly what it is.
3185000	3190000	It's not necessarily something that's gonna be out there for everybody. It's gonna be on all the consoles.
3190000	3193000	But this is how they're gonna prevent leaks of games.
3193000	3202000	Because when they put out all the promotional materials and so forth, and all the promo disks, those are gonna be tied to the accounts of the people that are reviewing them.
3202000	3204000	That's probably what it's really about.
3204000	3212000	And think about it. Sony is also a motion picture studio, which means they send out screener Blu-rays for the Oscars and all that stuff.
3212000	3214000	They wanna lock that shit down too.
3214000	3216000	I think that's a brilliant thought what this could be.
3216000	3219000	This may not be for everybody. This could be for a promotional case only.
3219000	3226000	Because if something like this only affects people that are using promotional devices and so forth, you stop the day zero leaks this way,
3227000	3235000	and people aren't as apt to hack it because it's affecting people that don't really have these consoles that aren't the hackers in the first place.
3235000	3238000	Yeah, but here's the problem with that though. That wouldn't work.
3238000	3244000	If it's gonna be a standard Blu-ray with the RFID tag inside there, if you have a device that doesn't read the RFID tag, there's no way to lock it out.
3244000	3246000	It's just gonna read it as a disk.
3246000	3250000	It's not gonna go, oh hey, I'm not gonna play this because there's not an RFID code.
3250000	3253000	No, it's a Blu-ray disk. It's just gonna read it.
3253000	3257000	That would only work on a console or something where it has the technology in place to do that.
3257000	3259000	Who said the reader wouldn't be in there?
3259000	3261000	There's a difference between putting it in there and using it.
3261000	3265000	Maybe what it's looking for is that the general games would just have an open tag.
3265000	3268000	It's not gonna be tied because they know it would be the kiss of death.
3268000	3270000	No, no, no, I'm not talking about that.
3270000	3276000	I'm talking about if you're looking at a scenario where you're trying to prevent piracy with these movie leaks or something like that,
3276000	3281000	your standard Blu-ray drive is not gonna read that RFID tag, so it's gonna mean nothing to it.
3281000	3288000	It's gonna pretend it's not even there, and so that's not gonna work unless they come out with a whole new disk format that's gonna do this.
3288000	3291000	Why not? And Sony could do that. Why not?
3291000	3298000	I mean, if you're talking about Oscar screeners and things that they want to put the clamp down on,
3298000	3302000	it would not be unheard of for Sony to send everybody a new Blu-ray player.
3302000	3307000	It doesn't matter. You incorporate it into a console, you incorporate it into a disk drive, it's gonna get hacked.
3307000	3312000	It's just gonna get hacked. It's gonna be a target, so why even bother?
3312000	3314000	SSJ100Matt in chat says,
3314000	3318000	Things are gonna get leaked anyways, because few safeguards end up working, the hackers will find a way.
3318000	3326000	True, I'm not saying this will necessarily prevent it from happening, but it's all about stopping those day zero leaks.
3326000	3331000	That is what they hate the most, because where are the most sales of games in the first week?
3332000	3338000	So the better they can plug or delay the inevitable leak or hack or whatever, the better they can delay that,
3338000	3341000	the more that game's gonna sell. That's the reality.
3347000	3350000	Just a thought. I thought that was a great thought from our chat room.
3350000	3356000	Live.vognetwork.com. And again, maybe in some ways I'm thinking best case scenario.
3356000	3358000	I think that would be a smart thing to do.
3358000	3361000	But let's look at it this way also. I don't think that's how they're gonna use it.
3361000	3368000	I think they're gonna lock down game content. I mean, they're the only first party that has online passes for their fucking games.
3368000	3375000	If they do it and Microsoft doesn't, why don't they just kiss their ass goodbye right now?
3375000	3379000	Because they're doing it now, and Microsoft doesn't do that, and they're fine.
3379000	3384000	Well, because Microsoft does it a different way by charging you a yearly fee for Xbox Live Gold.
3384000	3385000	They're doing it.
3385000	3392000	Well, they probably can't do it because it would be like, hey, what the fuck, I'm paying you, and now I have to pay you again.
3394000	3398000	They find other ways to do it. Forza Horizon last week we were talking about.
3398000	3400000	They find other ways to nickel and dime you.
3400000	3403000	Really, that $10 is not fucking financing a goddamn network.
3403000	3407000	It's just financing them bitching about, oh, we don't get enough money.
3407000	3412000	You really think that $10 goes to the developer or that $10 goes to running those servers?
3412000	3414000	It does not fucking go to them.
3414000	3418000	No, look at the game. The games have already been shut down that use those passes.
3418000	3421000	It doesn't go to shit. It just goes to line their pockets even more.
3421000	3424000	It's $10 more they made because you bought the game used.
3424000	3429000	All right, well, moving on to hacking and so forth.
3429000	3437000	Big progress made, according to the gaming blogs and the gaming news sites this week, on hacking Nintendo's 3DS handheld.
3437000	3441000	Hacker Nemod, I hope I didn't say that wrong, but that's the name.
3441000	3446000	Nemod says that he got full control of the 3DS via a kernel mode.
3446000	3451000	One of the benefits, now the 3DS could potentially be region-free through this hack.
3451000	3454000	So you could run a Japanese because, as you know, the 3DS is region-locked.
3454000	3459000	So you could run a game from any region on whatever region's handheld you wanted to.
3459000	3461000	So, you know, that's one perk.
3461000	3464000	And then, of course, eventually we're talking about homebrew.
3464000	3468000	However, this also would open the door to things like piracy.
3468000	3471000	So it's, you know, kind of a very delicate sort of situation.
3471000	3476000	But whatever way it is, progress has been made on the hack.
3476000	3480000	Nintendo, of course, I wouldn't expect them to sit down quietly for this.
3480000	3485000	I'm sure there would be a patch as soon as they can figure out how he did it that will patch it out.
3485000	3490000	But you could always not get said patch and possibly hack the system.
3490000	3495000	Well, the other thing, too, is you could lock out that update because you have a full control of the kernel.
3495000	3497000	So you just say, okay, you're not going to download.
3497000	3499000	And also, the updates don't download automatically.
3499000	3501000	You have to accept those updates.
3501000	3503000	And so, I don't know.
3503000	3506000	It'd be easy to hack that.
3506000	3510000	But some games won't run unless you're on the most current firmware, right?
3510000	3513000	Well, there's ways around that, too.
3513000	3518000	I'm just saying. They try to put as many gotchas in there as they can.
3518000	3520000	And everything can be patched.
3520000	3524000	Well, Jamie, I think you have kind of something along the same lines, right?
3524000	3528000	Well, the Mutant Mudds story, right?
3528000	3534000	Yeah, with that one, there was a comment made by the developer for Mutant Mudds and Dementium.
3534000	3537000	His name is... I'm hoping I'm pronouncing it right.
3537000	3541000	Is that Jules Watcham or Jules?
3541000	3542000	It's with a J.
3542000	3548000	Anyway, he had concerns about piracy on the 3DS, saying that if piracy gets bad, then...
3548000	3550000	I'm just paraphrasing.
3550000	3553000	They have no choice but to stop supporting the platform with new games.
3553000	3557000	And he goes on to say that some people say that piracy leads to more game sales,
3557000	3559000	claiming it enables players to try before they buy.
3559000	3561000	Bullshit.
3561000	3565000	And a lot of people looked at it as an attack on Nintendo.
3565000	3568000	So he went back in and said that he's always supported it.
3568000	3571000	That he loves Nintendo and the 3DS.
3571000	3577000	But all he's saying is that if piracy gets bad on the 3DS, they can't put out new games.
3577000	3585000	And it's not that he's taking a stand on piracy, but it's more of a business action to develop games
3585000	3589000	so that they can, I guess, save their money. It'd be a business decision.
3589000	3590000	Right.
3590000	3599000	But, I mean, honestly, I really don't think that it's gonna be that much of a factor in affecting the business.
3599000	3602000	The people who want it bad enough are still gonna buy it.
3602000	3605000	The people who want to steal it bad enough are still gonna steal it.
3605000	3607000	They're gonna find a way, yeah.
3607000	3614000	And honestly, there's been a couple of times where I've sampled something and have gone out and bought it.
3614000	3618000	I think it's how a lot of people are. I've done that with music a bunch of times.
3618000	3621000	I'll hear somebody on YouTube and I'll go buy the album.
3621000	3623000	Yeah, I do that with music a lot, too.
3623000	3626000	To the industry's credit, though, they've made it very easy.
3626000	3630000	I think they kind of figured out a way to combat it with things like Spotify.
3630000	3640000	Spotify makes it very easy to sample things very hassle-free and make a legal decision from there if you want or what have you.
3640000	3642000	Or you can still do it illegally if you want.
3642000	3649000	But I think the music industry is finally figuring out ways to embrace the fact that there are people that want to try it for nothing
3649000	3651000	and then maybe we'll pay if it's good enough.
3651000	3654000	Well, one thing that he did say, and this is something we've been saying for ages,
3654000	3659000	is that he doesn't think there's a solution to piracy, that it will always exist.
3659000	3662000	This is what he said, I accept that piracy will exist on the 3DS.
3662000	3665000	The question is how much is it affecting the market.
3665000	3668000	Some markets maintain a healthy business environment alongside piracy.
3668000	3673000	I believe this is due to many factors, not the least of which is the service provided in that market.
3676000	3677000	I get what he's saying.
3677000	3681000	He's basically saying, if it's just going to be open season and everybody's stealing shit back and forth on a 3DS,
3681000	3683000	what's the value in me putting my game out on it?
3683000	3689000	Which is what the PlayStation 4 might turn into if this ends up being worst case scenario, what we talked about earlier.
3689000	3694000	Well, he did say that there's going to be a sequel to Mutant Mudds and it will be an eShop release.
3701000	3703000	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
3703000	3705000	Mutant Mudds might not be out.
3705000	3707000	Well, there was something else that was occurring to me.
3707000	3708000	Oh, sure.
3708000	3713000	I mean, maybe that is why there's a lot more people leaning towards digital distribution
3713000	3719000	and having a key attached to it so that they can verify IP where it's downloaded.
3719000	3723000	I mean, I understand why they're doing it.
3723000	3729000	It just seems with the physical copy, there's a lot more potential to crack what's there.
3729000	3731000	All right.
3731000	3735000	Mutant Mudds might not be a new game this week, so let's travel around the world and see what is new this week
3735000	3738000	as we check out the release dates, which might be thin.
3738000	3741000	Yeah, still thin. Not much this week.
3741000	3747000	Thankfully, Anarchy Reigns finally making its way out over here in North America on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3747000	3753000	And then The Sims 3 gets yet another expansion with The Sims 3 Monte Vista.
3753000	3756000	Yeah, so that's it.
3756000	3761000	Yeah, traveling to Japan again looks like things are kind of on a hiatus right now until a little later in the month.
3761000	3765000	There's really not a lot to look for in Japan right now.
3765000	3767000	Just looking at the different consoles just to make sure.
3767000	3773000	But I don't see anything on the Xbox 360 or the PlayStation 3, 3DS, none of that.
3773000	3777000	Looks like we're on break till mid-January, so play what you've got.
3777000	3778000	Dark Sakura, how about UK?
3778000	3780000	Hey, there's Steam, you know.
3780000	3782000	On the 11th of January, we have...
3782000	3784000	Do they have Steam in Japan?
3784000	3785000	I think so.
3785000	3788000	I wouldn't see why not, but everything would have to be licensed for that reason.
3788000	3789000	Yeah.
3789000	3794000	On January 11th, Anarchy Reigns and Ninja Gaiden 3.
3794000	3795000	Alrighty.
3795000	3796000	That's it.
3796000	3800000	Just a couple more news stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week.
3800000	3806000	So, THQ had arranged, I want to say it was last week, maybe even earlier this week,
3806000	3814000	arranged a sale that tied in with their bankruptcy protection that they did to sell off their assets to,
3814000	3819000	I want to say it was Clear Lake Capital Group.
3819000	3824000	And basically the plan, the way they put it out was that they were going to do this quick sale
3824000	3830000	and this Clear Lake Capital Group was going to take ownership of all that stuff
3830000	3833000	and I guess that they were still going to be able to complete their games
3833000	3839000	and all their IPs would kind of remain their own and it would kind of wipe out the debt that they had.
3839000	3846000	However, the people that they owe money to weren't exactly happy about the fact that, hey,
3846000	3853000	their debt's going to be wiped out and they're not going to get paid for the stuff that they owed money for
3853000	3861000	and that they're kind of trying to do this really quick sale without getting any further bids on the company.
3861000	3874000	So, what they're basically doing now is they actually have some different people interested in these IPs.
3874000	3881000	So, including Warner Games is actually looking to possibly buy some of their IPs.
3881000	3896000	And they were saying that, I guess the whole objection came from the, I want to say some of their people that were owed money, the creditors.
3896000	3902000	And they were saying, rather than being designed to maximize the value of the debtor's estates,
3902000	3907000	the bidding procedures by design or otherwise render the auction process meaningless
3907000	3916000	and virtually guarantee that Clear Lake will be the ultimate buyer, thereby ensuring that the debtor's management retain their positions within
3916000	3920000	and the operating control over the debtor's organization.
3920000	3930000	So, it sounds like the whole thing was rigged, but now it's kind of, they're throwing a monkey wrench into it now that they've kind of objected to the quick sale.
3930000	3938000	So, what do you think this ultimately means, Loki? Does this mean THQ is going to be nothing but Saints Row and Darksiders getting sold to somebody else?
3938000	3941000	Or what does this mean for the future, you think?
3941000	3946000	I don't know. I mean, we'll have to see who bids on what or what happens.
3946000	3952000	It's kind of ballsy to think that they were able, they were going to organize this whole thing to just kind of,
3952000	3959000	I mean, obviously they want to put themselves in a better position, but it's very risky to just kind of put yourselves out there for sale
3959000	3967000	and then rely on one company to buy you without expecting anyone else to not kind of come in,
3967000	3972000	or trying to shorten that window so small that only one person could come in.
3972000	3974000	It's kind of like you've arranged the buyer.
3974000	3979000	Okay, I'll tell you what. We're going to get this Clear Lake Capital Group to come in.
3979000	3987000	We told them that we're going to do this, and we're going to have the window open for five minutes for anybody else that wants to walk in and possibly plays a bid.
3987000	3996000	Go. Oh, no one's here. Oh, I guess I just wanted to tell you guys, you know, it's just very, I don't know.
3996000	3997000	Shady?
3997000	3998000	Yes.
3998000	4005000	All right, fair enough. Before I get into another news story here, just to go back to another topic before our chatters talking about Steam in Japan.
4005000	4011000	ActDeaf says, Rob, there is Steam in Japan. And I was like, okay, does that mean there's different games?
4012000	4020000	Rob, I imagine there's some differences. Since Activision isn't in Japan, they probably have to wait for Square Enix to put out Call of Duty, for example.
4020000	4026000	So we don't know all the specifics, but there is Steam in Japan, which makes sense.
4026000	4034000	ActDeaf, I know he's in Mexico, so he gets his Steam games through, you know, I'm pretty sure it's the same Steam that we're using here in the US,
4034000	4040000	but it does demonstrate that Steam is available in other countries, so I don't see why there wouldn't be a Steam in Japan.
4040000	4047000	Makes a lot of sense to me. All right, well, something that's going to be right here in the US, maybe.
4047000	4056000	A new project from Namco, which sounds awesome to me, experimenting with a project called Level 256.
4056000	4064000	Level 256, by the way, is the very last stage in Pac-Man before you get the kiss of death, which is appropriate because this is a Namco project,
4065000	4075000	talking about high-end food and entertainment all in one place. They're talking about a prototype maybe in Chicago that could possibly become this chain
4075000	4081000	that would have pool, shuffleboard, video games, and other types of immersive attractions.
4081000	4084000	A quote from the CEO of Namco Entertainment, David Bishop,
4084000	4091000	quote, it's no secret that we've been exploring a number of new business models and noodling, I love that, noodling the future of out-of-home entertainment
4091000	4098000	for several years now, and our current planning does include an upscale restaurant with entertainment elements.
4098000	4105000	So it's basically going to be Dave and Buster's in many ways. Who knows, who knows, it could be more upscale, who knows.
4105000	4113000	Sounds good to me. You know, Namco still pumps out machines that show up in the arcades, all types of machines.
4113000	4119000	Namco does Flame and Finger. That's one of my favorite Dave and Buster's games. I am the master at Flame and Finger. I hit the jackpot.
4119000	4125000	I don't know, I'd be more excited if it was Tecmo doing an upscale entertainment business.
4125000	4127000	Of course, that would just be a strip club.
4127000	4132000	No, no, that's a lowbrow entertainment business that you're talking about over there, nasty.
4132000	4137000	Hey, well, they still have Soul Calibur, so there's still a chance.
4138000	4144000	Little competition would be healthy. I can't think of a lot of places like Dave and Buster's. Maybe Jillian's? They don't really have those out here.
4144000	4146000	But I know Jillian's is a chain.
4146000	4148000	1980's Chuck and Cheese.
4148000	4153000	I think they sold. I think Jillian's might have sold to Dave and Buster's, so yeah, I guess that doesn't exist.
4153000	4155000	There's John's Incredible Pizza.
4155000	4160000	Oh yeah, John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza. But that's more for kids.
4160000	4162000	They have a roller coaster, so they count.
4162000	4165000	I like pizza, I like arcade games.
4167000	4171000	They should just open up a place that has pizza and arcade games. Why do we have to complicate it?
4171000	4175000	Hey, Codeman, I used to work for Namco. In an arcade.
4175000	4185000	WhatupG in chat says Nintendo is also doing work on Smash. An arcade version of Smash? Yes, please.
4185000	4196000	Namco also did the whole F-Zero AX. Remember that was the Triforce between them, Sega and Nintendo? Awesome arcade machine.
4196000	4200000	What about the Mario Kart arcade that had Pac-Man?
4200000	4202000	That was Namco too, yeah.
4202000	4207000	Rama does confirm in chat Jillian's was sold to Dave and Buster's and converted. That's what I thought.
4207000	4216000	Alright, let's see. Let's talk about the classics. Let's talk about when all there was was Chuck E. Cheese and Showbiz Pizza.
4216000	4218000	Which were technically the same company.
4218000	4220000	Which were technically the same thing.
4220000	4223000	Hey, there was Bullwinkles, okay? There was alternatives.
4223000	4225000	We're out in Alabama.
4225000	4232000	Let's go back to when animatronic animals were all the rage. It's a segment we call the classic game of the week.
4232000	4237000	Where Dark Soccer is going to jump into the gaming vault and hopefully. It's so sticky.
4237000	4244000	She will find a game that she thinks, hey, play this now. Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
4244000	4251000	Classic game is Ninja Warriors. And I'm not talking about the arcade version from 1988.
4251000	4256000	I'm talking about the SNES one. Which in Japan was called the Ninja Warriors again.
4256000	4261000	And in Europe it was Ninja Warriors The New Generation.
4261000	4268000	It's a beat-em-up that was developed by Natsume before they went all Harvest Moon on us.
4268000	4270000	And when they used to release games that kicked ass.
4270000	4275000	And it was released by Taito. It came out for the SNES in 1994.
4275000	4280000	And it is indeed a remake of the 1988 arcade game The Ninja Warriors.
4280000	4288000	It's set in the future. The population has been oppressed by the military and brainwashed.
4288000	4294000	So these androids are going out to save everybody.
4294000	4304000	So it is a side-scrolling beat-em-up. It's very similar to Shinobi or Bad Dudes.
4304000	4309000	But it's in widescreen format. You can be the strong ninja.
4309000	4317000	You can be the kanoichi. You can be kamaitachi. Those are the three characters.
4317000	4325000	Each of them has their own set of moves, different attacks, jumping attacks, throws, different defense positions, and power moves.
4325000	4335000	So the game is actually really good. But the only bad drawback to it is that it's only single player. You don't have a co-op mode.
4335000	4344000	I would love this game if there was a co-op mode in it. But I always used the kanoichi when I played it.
4344000	4349000	It was a fun little game. I remember the issue of EGM that they advertised this in.
4349000	4352000	And I was like, I must have this game.
4352000	4355000	What did Sushi X have to say about this game?
4355000	4358000	It got a 90% in GamePro. I'll tell you that.
4358000	4365000	82% by EGM, with it saying this is the best side-scrolling fighting game yet.
4365000	4368000	That's because Final Fight Guy hadn't come out yet.
4368000	4371000	Actually, I think it's cooked. Did it come out after Final Fight Guy?
4371000	4373000	I don't know. I'm just making shit up.
4373000	4382000	But anyway, the kanoichi in the game was rated as one of the top ten fighting women in video games makes me three.
4382000	4387000	So I don't have really a whole lot to say about it. I mean, it is side-scrolling fighter.
4387000	4394000	But it's a fun game. And you can probably find this pretty inexpensively at your local used store.
4394000	4398000	So get it. Remember when Natsume made awesome games?
4398000	4401000	Not a fan of Tulips?
4401000	4405000	Tulips was funny, but that's silly.
4405000	4410000	Alright, your classic game of the week. Ninja Warriors on the Super Nintendo.
4410000	4414000	This is a rare case of Dark Sakura endorsing the remake.
4414000	4416000	You know what? I played a crap ton of this game.
4416000	4420000	Because yes, we had remakes on the Super Nintendo, and a lot of them were awesome.
4420000	4423000	For example, Super Mario All-Stars. Awesome.
4423000	4426000	Where we actually could play the real Super Mario Brothers 2.
4426000	4427000	Amen.
4427000	4430000	This game had explosions and shit going on.
4430000	4436000	And I think her hair was a weapon. The kanoichi.
4436000	4439000	And she just threw a whole tank of cocaine.
4439000	4442000	Well, she's also an android.
4442000	4444000	I want my hair to be a weapon.
4444000	4446000	There it is, your classic game of the week.
4446000	4449000	My hair practically is a weapon if I let it grow.
4449000	4451000	Alright, we're going to take a break here at OLR Studios.
4451000	4453000	But we'll be back with more gaming news.
4453000	4455000	We've got some rapid-fire news coming up.
4455000	4458000	The FUGL question of the week should be a fun one this week.
4458000	4461000	And as announced in the opening of tonight's show.
4461000	4466000	Could playing MMOs make you more attractive to job seekers?
4466000	4468000	We'll see.
4468000	4470000	Port please. Port pront please.
4470000	4473000	Yes, on my resume.
4473000	4478000	I gave over 1500 ports to prontera in the 2011 fiscal year.
4478000	4481000	Alright, we'll be back after this with more of Orange Launch Radio.
4481000	4483000	Don't go anywhere guys. Stay tuned.
4485000	4492000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
4492000	4498000	We are live with our 488th episode on this January the 6th of 2013.
4498000	4500000	Live at the Voice of Geeks Network.
4500000	4503000	vognetwork.com as we are every Sunday night.
4503000	4505000	Live during the break tonight.
4505000	4508000	They heard some music from Street Fighter X Mega Man.
4508000	4511000	We can't play that stuff during the podcast.
4511000	4515000	But if you want to experience what it was like to be here live.
4515000	4517000	You can check out the soundtrack for yourself.
4517000	4519000	It's a pay what you want thing.
4519000	4521000	So you can put zero.
4521000	4523000	But Dark Soccer, you say pay something. Do it.
4523000	4525000	Seriously, the guy put a lot of work into it.
4525000	4527000	And he did it for the community.
4527000	4530000	So just pay something. Anyone can afford a dollar.
4530000	4533000	Rivalrivalrival.bankcamp.com
4533000	4536000	Is the website where you can get that.
4536000	4538000	And technically it's like slash albums.
4538000	4540000	But just go to Rival Rival Rival.
4540000	4542000	Good times. Good times.
4542000	4544000	Alan's back from work earlier than expected.
4544000	4546000	Hi Alan. How was your gaming week?
4546000	4548000	Did you play a lot of good games this week?
4548000	4550000	What did you play?
4550000	4552000	He's not going to yell across the room.
4552000	4555000	How much did the Steam sale damage your wallet?
4555000	4558000	How about we wait until he can actually get on the microphone to ask him these questions.
4558000	4560000	Just a quick question.
4560000	4564000	How much did the Steam sale damage your wallet?
4564000	4570000	I would say I was able to keep the Steam Holiday sale in check for I want to say $35 or less.
4570000	4572000	Which is really good.
4572000	4574000	You did worse than me though if you spent that much money.
4574000	4576000	Have you played Torchlight 2 yet?
4576000	4578000	I installed it.
4578000	4580000	That's the first step. There you go.
4580000	4583000	I bought Hearthfire during their break.
4583000	4585000	It's $2.50.
4585000	4588000	Wait a minute. You talked me out of buying Dark Souls and now you bought stuff.
4588000	4592000	Well it's because some of the mods I had required Hearthfire.
4592000	4596000	So I wanted to install that so I can install those mods.
4596000	4598000	Alright.
4598000	4602000	Alan also and I celebrated 3 years on Friday.
4602000	4604000	So congratulations Alan.
4604000	4606000	Gross.
4606000	4608000	Squish squish.
4608000	4610000	But no.
4610000	4614000	The only reason why I bring that up is that we got to do dinner at Ruth Chris Steakhouse.
4614000	4616000	Because I had won a gift card through work.
4616000	4618000	Oh my god. Steak.
4618000	4620000	Nom.
4620000	4622000	That is so good.
4622000	4624000	Have you ever had Ruth Chris?
4624000	4628000	No I haven't. We saw that when we went to the mall the other day.
4628000	4630000	No. I haven't been there.
4630000	4632000	Even if it's not Ruth Chris like Morton's or one of those fancy steakhouses.
4632000	4636000	No. I like the Daily Grill.
4636000	4640000	They only had the nearest one that was in Modesto or San Francisco.
4640000	4642000	I really wish they had one here.
4642000	4644000	It's so good.
4644000	4646000	They're peppercorn steak.
4646000	4650000	I should say something nice publicly about Ruth Chris and the whole experience.
4650000	4658000	And I'm okay endorsing them because when we originally made the reservations we didn't really put that anything special was going on.
4658000	4662000	But as we were being seated the gal asked are you celebrating anything?
4662000	4668000	Unfortunately we're not quite at a society yet where we're looking at same sex relationships and it's no big deal.
4668000	4672000	And it isn't a big deal. It's just whatever right?
4672000	4678000	But still sometimes it's a little nervous to say okay well it's actually my anniversary.
4678000	4680000	But I just went ahead and said that.
4680000	4682000	And they were totally respectful and awesome.
4682000	4685000	And the waitress even put roses on our table.
4685000	4691000	And everybody from the busser that came by to the other waitresses would actually come by and say,
4691000	4693000	Hey happy anniversary you guys.
4693000	4695000	And would ask those questions like how long and so forth.
4695000	4700000	It was just an awesome experience and I was so happy with that.
4700000	4702000	So I should give them publicly props.
4702000	4708000	So if you have a lot of money to spend on an expensive steak it's a great steak. I'm not gonna lie.
4708000	4716000	What I was trying to say earlier is that one of my exes worked at Ruth's Chris.
4716000	4719000	And their steak knives are excellent to buy.
4719000	4722000	No you can actually buy the set of their steak knives. They're really nice.
4722000	4725000	But I used to get food free from there all the time.
4725000	4727000	Oh lucky lady.
4727000	4731000	Just takeout stuff you know stuff that had been set back.
4731000	4735000	Well I mean I understand you were in a different situation where you got takeout.
4735000	4737000	But you don't get takeout from Ruth's Chris.
4737000	4740000	No but some of the servers could take dinner home.
4740000	4742000	Sure like if a steak was overcooked or something.
4742000	4748000	Yeah and you know so it was I never ate in the restaurant.
4748000	4750000	But I've had plenty of stuff from there.
4750000	4752000	So it was good food.
4752000	4753000	Awesome.
4753000	4754000	Alright anyhow.
4754000	4758000	Oh you guys make me hungry for yet another buttery delicious steak.
4758000	4760000	But we have more gaming news to cover.
4760000	4762000	Buttery steak? No that sounds gross.
4762000	4767000	There's actually a place down in Sacramento that I just saw that's called butter and steak.
4767000	4769000	Or butter and bacon.
4769000	4774000	My friends I do brunch almost every Sunday with a group of friends.
4774000	4778000	And they all went there and they said it's really good but it's a long wait.
4778000	4781000	We missed that week. We were doing something else that Sunday. We didn't go.
4781000	4783000	We went to Pour House today.
4783000	4786000	My sister was telling me that they were doing Bacon Fest 2 down there.
4786000	4792000	Somebody was asking you earlier and I don't know who it was in chat.
4792000	4796000	I'm sorry chatter but somebody was asking you about if you've seen the show The United States of Bacon.
4796000	4797000	No I haven't.
4797000	4799000	I guess that's a thing.
4799000	4802000	Who knew it was a thing but it's a thing.
4802000	4803000	Alright.
4803000	4805000	Alright.
4805000	4809000	Very nice comment. Thank you from SSJ100 Matt in our chat room.
4809000	4811000	The rest of the country could learn from a steakhouse.
4811000	4813000	Treating everyone like the same human being.
4813000	4815000	I could not agree more.
4815000	4819000	But I'm thankful that the people that participate with this show like you know whatever.
4819000	4821000	You know. Awesome.
4821000	4823000	Anyhow.
4823000	4825000	Let's get into some rapid fire news.
4825000	4828000	Back to gaming. The thing we all enjoy when we're not eating. Low key.
4828000	4830000	So Lego.
4830000	4833000	Even though they haven't really run out of properties to make things out of.
4833000	4837000	I mean they did create that Ninjago or whatever that is.
4837000	4839000	And I don't still understand that.
4839000	4841000	But they have that series now.
4841000	4846000	So now they have this new Lego Legends of Kima.
4846000	4853000	And it's some sort of looks like mythical creatures that they're going to now sell toys for.
4853000	4855000	But they also have this video game franchise that they're creating.
4855000	4858000	It's basically I think iOS games.
4858000	4860000	iOS and portable games.
4860000	4866000	So they're going to have this Lego Legends of Kima Speedzores.
4866000	4868000	Way to make up words.
4868000	4873000	It's I guess a racing mini game that's on Lego.com and on iOS.
4873000	4879000	Then they're going to have Lego Legends of Kima levels journey.
4879000	4881000	That's coming to 3DS and Vita.
4881000	4883000	And I guess the DS later on.
4883000	4886000	And then Lego Legends of Kima Online.
4886000	4889000	That's going to be a free to play online world.
4891000	4893000	So.
4894000	4895000	I guess it's weird.
4895000	4900000	It looks very like fantasy mythical stuff.
4900000	4907000	Like they have this looks like a lion headed warrior with this sword that's all lightning and stuff.
4907000	4909000	And he's throwing a magic ball.
4909000	4912000	And this like angel hawk headed guy.
4912000	4913000	I don't know.
4913000	4914000	It's funky looking.
4914000	4916000	But I'm sure the toys will be cool.
4917000	4922000	Live.vognetwork.com says without grown crappy kids toys Loki will never get this shit.
4922000	4924000	Bite your tongue sir.
4924000	4926000	There are tons of people that are into those Lego games.
4926000	4928000	There's tons of adults that are into Legos.
4928000	4930000	No I don't have a problem with Legos.
4930000	4931000	I still get Legos.
4931000	4934000	I don't get the Lego franchises that Lego themselves have built.
4934000	4936000	Like what do they have?
4936000	4938000	They have that whole Lego.
4938000	4940000	Well the Ninjago stuff doesn't make any.
4940000	4942000	I mean it's ninjas I understand that.
4942000	4944000	But it's just kind of beyond that.
4944000	4947000	I don't really know the lore and crap with that.
4947000	4949000	And then they also had the...
4949000	4951000	The fuck was it?
4951000	4958000	They had some other Lego series that looked like these weird Mayan robot things or something.
4958000	4962000	It's like the Technic toys that they turned and made like weird characters out of.
4962000	4963000	And it was just weird.
4963000	4965000	Technica or something like that.
4965000	4967000	I don't know if it was Technica but it was something weird like that.
4967000	4968000	And then this.
4968000	4970000	This doesn't make any sense to me.
4970000	4973000	It's just all these made up words and shit.
4973000	4976000	I don't know who these people are.
4976000	4980000	I can understand Lego, Lord of the Rings and that kind of crap.
4980000	4981000	It makes sense.
4981000	4982000	And the toys make sense.
4982000	4983000	But I don't know.
4983000	4985000	For me it would be hard to get into this.
4985000	4990000	I guess the reason they're doing this is probably because how they did the Lego, Lord of the Rings.
4990000	4992000	But there's not really another Lord of the Rings coming out.
4992000	4993000	I guess there is next year.
4993000	4995000	But the Lord of the Rings stuff.
4995000	4997000	There's a Hobbit movie.
4997000	4998000	Technically it's The Hobbit.
4998000	5000000	Well they're still lumping it all in there.
5000000	5003000	They're not going to do Lego, Lord of the Rings 2, The Hobbit.
5003000	5005000	Which is really what it's going to be probably for a couple of years.
5005000	5008000	So they're going to come out with something in the meantime for next year.
5008000	5010000	And this is what it's going to be there.
5010000	5012000	The Lego game that's three hours of nothing.
5012000	5013000	They're going to do.
5013000	5014000	Just kidding.
5014000	5015000	Lego.
5015000	5018000	I don't know.
5018000	5020000	Some other franchise.
5020000	5021000	I'm sure they can.
5021000	5022000	There's Harry Potter.
5022000	5023000	There's Star Wars.
5023000	5025000	They're not going to do any more Harry Potter ones.
5025000	5028000	Because obviously there's no more movies tying with that.
5028000	5030000	I think they could probably do.
5030000	5032000	What about Lego Pottermore?
5032000	5034000	They could totally do that.
5034000	5036000	Disney owns Star Wars now.
5036000	5038000	There's going to be more Star Wars in the future.
5038000	5041000	What about Lego Hunger Games?
5041000	5043000	No that's not going to happen.
5043000	5045000	What other movie franchises could become Lego games?
5045000	5047000	Well they have Lego Prince of Persia.
5047000	5049000	Which they could do something with.
5049000	5050000	They have the rights to that.
5050000	5051000	Lego Avengers?
5051000	5052000	Is this Game Guru in our chat room?
5052000	5053000	No.
5053000	5054000	Avengers.
5054000	5056000	Remember Avengers are Mega Bloks.
5056000	5058000	I want Lego Hunger Games.
5058000	5059000	Or Cubic.
5059000	5060000	I'm a genius.
5060000	5061000	That would be a great game.
5061000	5063000	Wouldn't you play Lego Hunger Games?
5063000	5064000	No.
5064000	5065000	Wouldn't you?
5065000	5066000	I don't like the Lego games.
5066000	5068000	You want to play Lego Hunger Games?
5068000	5071000	There's the Hunger Games things that you can run on Minecraft.
5071000	5072000	That's as close as you're going to get.
5072000	5075000	May the odds never be in your favor.
5075000	5080000	Odds are you're paying too much for this Lego set.
5080000	5081000	Alright.
5081000	5087000	And then there's another game that's being released I guess.
5087000	5091000	It was unfinished and it was a version of the game Faceball.
5091000	5094000	But it was called Niko-chan Battle in Japan.
5094000	5101000	And it was for the ever successful portable console Virtual Boy.
5101000	5103000	You know the monochrome red.
5103000	5105000	You mean the migraine machine.
5105000	5107000	Yes the migraine machine.
5107000	5108000	And guess what?
5108000	5111000	If you're looking for a reproduction cartridge of the Virtual Boy game.
5111000	5112000	You can get it.
5112000	5114000	It's going to be released in February for $100.
5114000	5117000	Or you can get the ROM for free.
5117000	5119000	And you know that is.
5119000	5120000	Well I like free.
5120000	5122000	But you know what would be kind of cool.
5122000	5125000	And this is kind of tying back into the story with the whole homebrew stuff.
5125000	5126000	Wouldn't it be awesome.
5126000	5128000	And I don't know why Nintendo hasn't done this already.
5128000	5136000	Wouldn't it be awesome if they released Virtual Boy games on the virtual console for the 3DS.
5136000	5137000	Because it's in 3D.
5137000	5139000	And it has virtual in the name already.
5139000	5141000	That makes too much sense.
5141000	5143000	We're not going to do that.
5143000	5146000	Well plus doesn't Nintendo kind of want to distance themselves from that.
5146000	5147000	Like maybe that's.
5147000	5148000	Why?
5148000	5150000	Might as well embrace it.
5150000	5152000	They did it.
5152000	5154000	For a while.
5154000	5156000	I love the chatters by the way.
5156000	5159000	Now they're just shouting out all these random ass Lego games.
5159000	5162000	Sega says Lego cards against humanity.
5162000	5164000	That's how I spent my New Years Eve by the way.
5164000	5167000	What up G. Lego Street Fighter X Mega Man.
5167000	5169000	Degenerate Johnny.
5169000	5171000	This could be a thing Degenerate Johnny.
5171000	5172000	Lego Doctor Who.
5172000	5173000	I can see that.
5173000	5174000	I can see that.
5174000	5178000	Why not tap into what the big fandom is like.
5178000	5179000	Lego Merlin.
5179000	5180000	Lego Sherlock.
5180000	5181000	Why not.
5181000	5182000	Lego BBC.
5185000	5186000	No Lego Sherlock please.
5186000	5187000	Alright.
5187000	5188000	Lego Angry Birds.
5188000	5190000	I am perfectly happy with just the show.
5190000	5192000	Alright moving on to more news.
5192000	5195000	You know a lot of the internet is now in the cloud.
5195000	5196000	They always talk about in the cloud.
5196000	5198000	Everything's out in the cloud.
5198000	5201000	And now you can have your save games on Playstation 3 and Xbox in the cloud.
5201000	5203000	And everything can be in that fluffy little cloud.
5203000	5204000	But guess what?
5204000	5205000	Sometimes the cloud fucks up.
5205000	5207000	And that's what happened this week.
5207000	5211000	The Xbox cloud wasn't available to some people.
5211000	5215000	Very interesting because only certain people were unable to access it for certain time.
5215000	5217000	But that's how the internet works sometimes.
5218000	5227000	They ended up giving a one month free of Xbox Live to those that were unable to get their cloud games available.
5227000	5232000	So this probably also ties into Netflix was down on Christmas Eve for a lot of people.
5232000	5233000	Which drove them batty.
5233000	5236000	And apparently someone at Amazon had pushed the wrong button.
5236000	5239000	Like Amazon actually fessed up and kind of apologized to Netflix.
5239000	5240000	Which I thought was interesting.
5240000	5242000	Yeah we didn't do that on purpose.
5242000	5243000	Yeah.
5243000	5245000	We don't have a competing video streaming service or anything.
5245000	5247000	So someone made the cloud disappear.
5247000	5251000	And so if that's where your Xbox save files were you might not have been happy.
5251000	5253000	In other very interesting news.
5253000	5261000	A father in China decided to treat his son's internet addiction to an internet game.
5261000	5264000	I don't know what game this was but he did it in a very interesting way.
5264000	5270000	He hired an online hitman to take out his son.
5270000	5272000	Oh my gosh.
5272000	5275000	Apparently he was getting bad grades in school because of the gaming habit.
5275000	5277000	He couldn't land a job.
5277000	5279000	He couldn't get any work or whatever.
5279000	5284000	And the father was very annoyed that he didn't take the job at the software development company or whatever.
5284000	5287000	I mean these are problems a lot of people go through or what have you.
5287000	5295000	So the father hired games or hired players in the son's favorite games to hunt down the kid.
5295000	5298000	And we don't know how he did it or whatever.
5298000	5302000	But I imagine I could just see the post on like World of Warcraft forums.
5302000	5304000	Please kill my child.
5307000	5309000	Yeah we have a problem.
5309000	5311000	5,000 G for hit.
5311000	5314000	It's creative. I don't know.
5314000	5319000	So anyway now this is the part where I start to wonder if the story is fake because it has a happy ending.
5319000	5325000	But the child stuck up to his dad and said I can play or I cannot play.
5325000	5326000	It doesn't bother me.
5326000	5328000	I'm not looking for any job.
5328000	5331000	I want to take some time to find one that suits me.
5331000	5335000	We don't know if that was good enough to get the hitman's or the hitman called off.
5335000	5338000	Hitman. Stupid.
5338000	5340000	I just am now imagining a gif of this kid.
5340000	5342000	Challenge accepted.
5343000	5344000	Very nice.
5344000	5345000	It would be hilarious.
5345000	5347000	Yeah come at me with a hitman on grant.
5347000	5348000	I thought I'll just kick.
5348000	5350000	Come at me dad.
5351000	5353000	Alright moving on.
5353000	5354000	That situation will never end.
5354000	5358000	That situation will never happen with me because I will always be more skilled than my son at any game that he plays.
5358000	5361000	I will make that my life's mission.
5361000	5363000	So in other news.
5363000	5369000	Zen Pinball 2 is supposed to come out on the Wii U but it's been delayed to I think later this month.
5369000	5374000	And they're showing some of the games in it.
5374000	5379000	One of them including Plants vs. Zombies which is pretty neat.
5379000	5382000	And I'm trying to get this other one pulled up.
5383000	5385000	I think there was an Avengers one wasn't there?
5385000	5389000	I think there was in the old pinball games so maybe they brought it over.
5389000	5390000	I'm not sure though.
5390000	5391000	Maybe.
5391000	5396000	Anyway also an update for Street Fighter X Mega Man is coming.
5396000	5399000	And it says that there is.
5399000	5400000	Let's see.
5400000	5405000	On the download page the traffic they're saying was insane and broke the site.
5405000	5408000	So they want to keep supporting it.
5408000	5411000	And the guy behind everything.
5411000	5417000	Well Capcom's Senior Community Manager says that they're not done with the celebrations yet.
5418000	5421000	That means more.
5421000	5422000	Maybe we'll get Sakura.
5422000	5425000	This is going to be one of those celebrations that goes on for like a year.
5425000	5426000	Like my birthday.
5428000	5429000	Alright.
5429000	5431000	That's it for rapid fire news tonight.
5431000	5433000	Let's go to the foogle question of the week.
5433000	5435000	You smash Facebook and Google together.
5435000	5436000	Our Facebook community.
5436000	5437000	Our Google Plus community.
5437000	5438000	And you get foogle.
5446000	5448000	Now first off foogle people.
5448000	5452000	Explain to me why when I post the question the day before I get less answers.
5452000	5455000	Y'all are yelling at me about not giving you enough notice for the questions.
5455000	5457000	Although I will say this.
5457000	5459000	To the user's credit on our communities.
5459000	5463000	We got like kind of a different sampling than we get when we post the questions some days.
5463000	5465000	So alright let's hear from some other people we don't always hear from.
5465000	5467000	On the foogle question of the week.
5467000	5470000	One of our little sayings on OLR is hackers gonna hack.
5470000	5474000	And it sounds like this week much progress was made towards hacking the 3DS.
5474000	5476000	To be able to run custom code.
5476000	5478000	We talked about this earlier in the show of course.
5478000	5482000	When you hear stories like this do you tend to think it's a good thing for the community.
5482000	5485000	To be able to work around region locks and homebrew.
5485000	5488000	Or do you think it's a bad thing for the community as it makes piracy easier.
5488000	5491000	And makes companies want to come up with even more DRM ideas.
5491000	5493000	Or are you indifferent.
5493000	5495000	You don't care.
5495000	5497000	Let's start with Google tonight.
5497000	5498000	Critical Myth.
5498000	5501000	One of the hosts of Critical Myth here at The Bog Network.
5501000	5503000	4 o'clock Monday Wednesday Friday Pacific.
5503000	5508000	Critical Myth says hacking only gets on my nerves when it's done maliciously.
5508000	5511000	With no consideration for the impact on others.
5511000	5516000	Such as some of the actions of Anonymous and similar movements.
5516000	5517000	I have to say though.
5517000	5520000	Anonymous lately has been freaking boss.
5521000	5524000	Well here's the thing without getting too political.
5524000	5528000	My understanding is that you know part of the fact that there is Anonymous.
5528000	5531000	Is that there is a very kind of lack of organization.
5531000	5532000	No one's in charge.
5532000	5534000	Anonymous is kind of an idea right.
5534000	5538000	So yeah I mean I think we all heard about some of the stuff they were doing.
5538000	5540000	Where they were teaming up with Roseanne of all people.
5540000	5544000	To bring to light some of these really horrific things that were going on in Ohio.
5544000	5545000	I don't want to get into it.
5545000	5547000	But it's you know go Google it.
5547000	5548000	So you know you look at that.
5548000	5549000	And combating the WBC.
5549000	5553000	But then yeah but then I also get what Critical Myth is saying.
5553000	5556000	They've done some other stuff that's not so great.
5556000	5557000	So you know anyhow.
5557000	5562000	But let's focus more on the first part of that statement.
5562000	5564000	Hacking only gets on my nerves when it's done maliciously.
5564000	5567000	With no consideration for the impact on others.
5567000	5573000	One could argue that there's no consideration for the impact of gaming companies.
5573000	5574000	When people do this.
5575000	5578000	But then again there's some people that really want to run their homebrew.
5578000	5579000	Hmm tricky.
5580000	5583000	Rettertainment says as a normal everyday user of technology.
5583000	5585000	I am indifferent about matters such as this.
5585000	5591000	Until the hackers cause the manufacturer of the product I'm using to change it in a way that impacts me.
5591000	5593000	Then I get really fucking pissed off.
5593000	5598000	Why should I the normal everyday user suffer because of a small minority of users?
5598000	5602000	Well Rettertainment you must be really pissed at what some of the companies are doing with DRM now.
5602000	5605000	Earlier when Bobby Blackwolf gave us a call at the end of his show.
5605000	5606000	We were talking about Sim City.
5606000	5608000	And how I predict that game is going to tank.
5608000	5610000	And it's going to be because of the DRM.
5610000	5612000	I think a lot of people are predicting this honestly.
5612000	5614000	But I also think it's going to be the most pirated game of next year.
5615000	5617000	And it's all because of that DRM.
5619000	5622000	Let's go to Facebook and see what the folks on Facebook had to say.
5622000	5624000	And we'll start it off on Facebook with Raginator.
5624000	5626000	I'm against it and I think it's a bad thing.
5626000	5630000	Bobby once talked about this kind of thing on his show and I agree with his sentiment.
5630000	5634000	To paraphrase, people hacking their systems ultimately boils down to one thing.
5634000	5637000	Piracy despite claims to the contrary.
5637000	5641000	Obviously piracy isn't defensible and hurts everyone in the long run.
5642000	5644000	Loki do you agree with that notion?
5644000	5646000	Hacking is about piracy only.
5646000	5648000	Let's cut through the bullshit.
5648000	5650000	Let's cut through the bullshit.
5650000	5651000	This isn't about homebrew.
5651000	5652000	This isn't about...
5652000	5654000	It's about piracy.
5654000	5655000	No I don't think that's so at all.
5655000	5659000	The people that normally do create these exploits and stuff to open up a system.
5659000	5662000	Aren't doing it for stealing stuff.
5662000	5669000	They're just doing it to have homebrew options or to make things a little bit more user friendly.
5669000	5672000	As far as removing region locking and that kind of stuff.
5672000	5675000	Granted there's a lot of people that also just want to pirate stuff.
5675000	5677000	But those are pirates not hackers.
5678000	5681000	Black Wolf is in our chat room by the way.
5681000	5683000	Also kind of elaborating on this comment.
5683000	5686000	He says he was paraphrased poorly which is fine.
5686000	5689000	That just gives people reason to go listen to your show.
5689000	5691000	To get the word from the horse's mouth.
5691000	5693000	However I will say this from Black Wolf.
5693000	5697000	Whenever I look at top homebrew apps for anything.
5697000	5700000	9 of the top 10 all facilitate backups.
5700000	5702000	The other one is a media server.
5702000	5706000	So if I'm putting kind of that together with what Loki says.
5706000	5712000	Maybe the people who author this stuff aren't necessarily doing it for piracy.
5712000	5716000	But 90% of the people who go looking for it are.
5716000	5718000	Is that a fair statement? Loki?
5718000	5722000	A lot of people that are looking for hacks are yes looking for piracy.
5725000	5726000	Let's go to some more comments.
5726000	5730000	Lots of very long very well thought out comments on Facebook.
5730000	5733000	Unfortunately due to time I can't read these things in their entirety.
5733000	5735000	So I really urge you guys during the week.
5735000	5737000	Check this out facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
5737000	5741000	Or read some of these responses in their entirety.
5741000	5745000	DDR dollar bill says everyone has their arguments for and against this.
5746000	5747000	You have those who want this.
5747000	5749000	They can legitimately play imported games.
5749000	5752000	And you have those who just want to download files off the web and play it.
5752000	5754000	Without having to pay the cent.
5754000	5755000	Pay a cent.
5755000	5757000	Regardless of the morality behind it.
5757000	5761000	Ultimately we have to wonder if it's good for the consumer or not.
5761000	5766000	So you know the way that the game companies have to respond to what happens.
5768000	5771000	Burr responds and says I think it's a great thing for community.
5771000	5773000	It gives independent developers a chance to play with new hardware.
5773000	5775000	Which in the 3DS's case could be especially interesting.
5775000	5778000	Because I feel it's potential hasn't been fully tapped yet.
5780000	5783000	I think a lot of people are excited to see what type of homebrew could come up with.
5784000	5789000	Rob himself replies and says I got an original Xbox at the end of it's run.
5789000	5792000	And ended up getting a chip to run homebrew and of course pirated games.
5792000	5794000	I ended up with lots of games.
5794000	5796000	If I did not like a game I would just pop a new one in.
5796000	5797000	It would never be played again.
5797000	5799000	So pretty much due to being spoiled for choice.
5799000	5801000	I never really gave most games a chance.
5801000	5804000	That was the last time I had a console chipped and modded.
5804000	5808000	And now I spend way more times on playing games that I paid for.
5808000	5810000	Very interesting conclusion.
5810000	5816000	So what I'm reading into that is that because you just would throw away all these games.
5816000	5818000	You had access to anything you wanted.
5818000	5821000	And you ended up just throwing most of it away and never giving it a second thought.
5821000	5826000	And because of that you just want to buy the games and focus on that.
5826000	5829000	As opposed to I guess wasting your time downloading crap.
5829000	5832000	I think that's what I'm trying to read between the lines there.
5832000	5833000	I think that's what I'm hearing.
5833000	5834000	That's what it sounds like.
5835000	5839000	Daniel S. replies and says these things will happen no matter what.
5839000	5843000	All the people I know who hack and torrent are people who won't ever buy a game.
5843000	5848000	I feel that it's because we keep our ear to the ground that we feel like it's a big deal.
5849000	5853000	Degenerate Johnny says actions like hacking consoles is considered questionable.
5853000	5858000	It undermines the product that the company is producing and it promotes users to take an unethical behavior.
5858000	5865000	That being said, such actions can be considered justified in cases such as this, referring to the 3DS.
5865000	5873000	Nintendo should offer as much freedom as possible to its consumers if it ever hopes to fend off the aggressive competition as Microsoft, Sony, and Apple.
5873000	5882000	They shouldn't alienate its market based on location by forcing its consumers to purchase products that are only provided within their respective regions.
5882000	5884000	That's the first half of the comment there.
5885000	5889000	Well, Devil's Advocate, it's Nintendo's hardware.
5889000	5896000	They have the right to make whatever choices they want, but I guess what I'm hearing out of this is that this is how the community is going to respond to it.
5896000	5903000	When you try to take these things away, the community will patch it in themselves, I guess.
5905000	5908000	Tigerlaw says it's both a good thing and a bad thing.
5909000	5916000	Oftentimes, a console would have certain features that a hacker would implement and those features would end up in a future update at some point as well as play imported games.
5916000	5922000	It's also bad because it encourages piracy and makes those that do not intend on playing download it for free instead.
5923000	5926000	Dark Charger, very interesting comment here.
5926000	5936000	As someone who has been playing games for over three decades and has worked in software development for over 15 years, this is a very difficult question to answer.
5936000	5941000	The piracy of software that one doesn't already own a license to is stealing, period.
5941000	5944000	This hurts not only game software makers, but the industry as a whole.
5944000	5951000	That being said, I do not for an instant believe that a pirated game is necessarily a lost sale.
5951000	5957000	It is a false equivalence that movie studios, the RIAA, etc. have been incorrectly trying to make.
5957000	5963000	I think that people should be able to do with the hardware that they own what they want to the extent that it doesn't affect others.
5963000	5973000	While I would love to believe that the hacking community is primarily interested in expanding independent gaming, we all know that on the whole, the primary motive in most of these cases is piracy.
5973000	5980000	I do think, though, that these DRM restrictions only hurt legitimate buyers and are also largely ineffective.
5980000	5982000	And he closes that with slash long-winded.
5982000	5988000	I think that's a great comment and I'd like to hear from somebody that's kind of in that industry what they think.
5988000	5991000	Any thoughts on that comment, what Dark Charger said, Loki?
5991000	6006000	I do agree that a lot of it's just not a lost sale because I think a lot of, going back to what someone else was calling, where you just download a bunch of games that you're probably just going to throw away.
6006000	6012000	That you try once and you're like, eh, no, I can't see myself playing this. That's not necessarily a lost sale.
6012000	6023000	And hell, I mean, if you look at it in reverse, what if you were a consumer that bought that game and you're just like, crap, this is absolute shit, or it's completely broken, or whatever, for whatever reason you don't like it.
6023000	6032000	I agree that, yeah, you can't, that's one of the problems when they're calculating losses with piracy, you can't say that, oh, that was a lost sale.
6032000	6040000	And sometimes, in the cases where you may pirate the game, play it for a few weeks, and then buy the physical copy when it comes out.
6040000	6043000	How many people really do that?
6043000	6045000	There's a lot of people.
6045000	6052000	Alright. Next comment from Iamsuperlazy. I love that name. Me too, buddy, me too.
6052000	6061000	Iamsuperlazy says, I want to make things clear. I don't pirate, nor do I endorse piracy, and I do like the 3DS and have spent many hours playing the thing.
6061000	6069000	That being said, I do agree with the Free Software Foundation's stance on things like being able to mess with the hardware if I have the capability to.
6069000	6076000	It comes down to having control of what you buy because I own it and not being tied down to draconian TOS.
6076000	6082000	Lastly, Codeman replies and says, I think it comes down to two different kinds of people in the world, good and bad.
6082000	6088000	Good people will do something intelligent and fun with it, but bad will do something to destroy the fun for everyone else.
6088000	6093000	Either way, both will force companies to implement more restrictions so both sides lose.
6093000	6098000	So I think I'm indifferent because in the right hands, it could be used for good.
6098000	6110000	So if I were to read into Codeman's comment, he's saying that there are lawful good people in the world and there are chaotic evil people in the world, but you're more like true neutral.
6110000	6113000	Is that what I'm hearing? Maybe.
6113000	6121000	In seriousness though, I think he's right. Some people have good intentions, some people do not have good intentions.
6121000	6124000	I think that's true for a lot of things in life.
6124000	6126000	Anyhow, that's it for the FUGL Question of the Week.
6126000	6131000	Participate next week by joining one of our communities either on Facebook or on Google+.
6131000	6137000	Meanwhile, if there's no other comments here in the studio, we'll get to gaming news.
6138000	6149000	Alright, so there's another kind of Android console game, Android console coming out called the GameStick.
6149000	6155000	And what the GameStick is, is it's basically this device that plugs into your TV using the HDMI port.
6155000	6163000	It actually gets the power from the HDMI port if your TV supports that, otherwise they have an external adapter you can use either USB or a wall plug.
6163000	6170000	It's going to go for $79 and it's supposed to play different Android games, very similar to the Ouya.
6170000	6178000	Versus though, I think that a lot of the games being put on this aren't necessarily being made specifically for it.
6178000	6182000	It's not like it's going to have its own separate marketplace like the Ouya did.
6182000	6189000	Although they say that PlayJam is working with more than 250 developers to get titles made for and ported to the system.
6189000	6193000	And it basically comes with a controller as well, very similar to the Xbox 360 controller.
6193000	6200000	And what's kind of cool is the console, since it's the size of a USB stick, plugs into the, you can actually store it in the controller.
6200000	6203000	So you just take the controller with you and pop it into a TV and away you go.
6203000	6209000	That's like one of those wireless mouse, like laptop mice that have the USB dongle inside the mouse.
6210000	6218000	And yes, it's going to run Jelly Bean on Android and then of course outputting at 1080p.
6218000	6223000	And it's powered by an ArmLogic 8726MX mobile processor.
6223000	6232000	They actually have quite a few of these kind of all-in-one devices that you can buy now that do this sort of thing.
6232000	6241000	Not necessarily with a controller attached to it, but you can get these kind of PCs on a stick that have all this Android stuff.
6241000	6246000	You know, back when I was a teenager, the only thing you got on a stick was a hot dog.
6246000	6249000	And now you can get a PC on a stick.
6249000	6252000	Yes.
6253000	6261000	So it's expected out to, and of course, it is on Kickstarter, so they're working to kickstart this.
6261000	6267000	And they're expecting the console to officially launch one month after the Ouya in April.
6267000	6271000	And as of right now, just taking a quick peek to see if they've already hit their goals.
6271000	6273000	Oh wow.
6273000	6275000	You know, it should do alright.
6275000	6277000	How many people bought an Ouya and this?
6277000	6280000	Is this competition for the Ouya Loki?
6280000	6287000	I don't know. I mean, the controller is set up, like I said, it was sort of like an Xbox 360.
6287000	6296000	It's more of like, the analog layout is set up like the Xbox 360, but the controller looks like a classic controller on the Wii.
6296000	6299000	And I don't know, it looks kind of cheap.
6299000	6303000	But I mean, granted, it's a prototype that they're showing the picture of.
6304000	6308000	I guess it could be feasible for somebody to look at this and say,
6308000	6312000	oh hey, I'll pick it up because it's $20 cheaper than the Ouya.
6312000	6316000	But I would wait and see until they have some more information about this.
6316000	6319000	You know, versus the Ouya.
6319000	6322000	I have a feeling you're going to see a lot more of these types of things coming out.
6322000	6323000	Of course.
6323000	6325000	Like I said, they already have them.
6325000	6328000	The Ouya made a ton of money on Kickstarter.
6328000	6329000	Who doesn't like money?
6329000	6331000	And people are throwing it everywhere on Kickstarter.
6331000	6338000	They already have different, if you actually do a search about the Arm Logic 8726 or whatever,
6338000	6345000	you can actually look and find some other devices that are very similar minus the controller.
6345000	6351000	But once again, you could probably use a Bluetooth controller with it that are very similar.
6351000	6356000	So the price point is pretty nice, considering you get a controller with it.
6356000	6359000	But I don't know, it's interesting.
6361000	6363000	All right, speaking of interesting, this next story.
6363000	6367000	Quite the opposite of what you usually hear when you talk about the media,
6367000	6371000	or universities and so forth reporting on games.
6371000	6375000	Polygon ran a very interesting article this week about World of Warcraft players.
6375000	6377000	Could they be the ideal employee?
6377000	6382000	And this article is based on a video from researcher John Seely Brown.
6382000	6385000	Did the video for Knowledge Forum, Big Think.
6385000	6389000	And apparently in the video, Mr. Brown says,
6389000	6395000	I would rather hire a high level World of Warcraft player than an MBA from Harvard.
6395000	6400000	Why is a game, a massive multiplayer game that has maybe 12 million people or more playing it,
6400000	6405000	like World of Warcraft, so important at both the individual level and maybe at the corporate level?
6405000	6408000	To understand these massive multiplayer games like World of Warcraft,
6408000	6413000	do not think about it as just gameplay, but look at the social life on the edge of the game.
6413000	6420000	And of course I get into talking about the guilds and how you got to manage people when you're running a guild.
6420000	6425000	When you do well in these guilds, you get the extra bonuses and so forth.
6425000	6427000	You have to do research.
6427000	6429000	And you do this because you want to.
6429000	6431000	You want to be better.
6431000	6438000	And he calls that a self-organized ideation structure and an idea refinement structure.
6438000	6442000	These guilds are truly meritocracy based.
6442000	6447000	So even if you were the leader of this particularly high end raid, at the end you do an after action review.
6447000	6453000	And the after action review, each person is open to total criticism by everybody else.
6453000	6457000	More dots! More dots! It needs more dots!
6457000	6459000	Would you hire that guy?
6459000	6462000	Turn down Rob's vent.
6462000	6465000	Set Rob volume to 50%.
6465000	6467000	One more quote here.
6467000	6474000	The game described, quote, as an amazing learning environment with powerful learning tools that I think we in the education world can learn a hell of a lot about.
6474000	6477000	And we in the management world can learn a lot about.
6477000	6479000	But it gets back to this notion of passion.
6479000	6481000	It gets back to this notion of curiosity.
6481000	6489000	And it gets back to this notion that this is an interest driven phenomenon that unleashes exponential learning of a dimension that's almost unimaginable any other way.
6489000	6491000	What do you guys think about this?
6492000	6494000	Do you think there is merit to this?
6494000	6502000	That somebody who excels at World of Warcraft may bring something to the professional corporate table that somebody with an MBA from Harvard would not?
6502000	6503000	No.
6503000	6504000	Actually, yeah.
6504000	6511000	Because there's something to be said for book learning versus real life experience for interaction with people.
6511000	6516000	You know, I often think sometimes a college degree can ruin a natural talent.
6516000	6519000	Well, I mean, I am coming from an art field.
6519000	6524000	So, yeah, I've seen people's work the more education they have.
6524000	6527000	It's important to say you're not saying all the time. You're saying some of the time.
6527000	6532000	There's people who I totally respected as artists that I think that their work was better when they were still raw and new.
6532000	6534000	I'm just saying.
6534000	6540000	That being said, you have to, I think, have the background information to go with it.
6540000	6550000	But if you want somebody who's going to be a good manager of people for someone who's going to be able to give feedback in an open environment,
6550000	6557000	you need someone who has experience in that you just don't get immediately in school unless you've taken tons of rhetoric classes.
6557000	6559000	You know, apart from that.
6559000	6562000	Loki, you said no. What's your take?
6562000	6566000	The no on that is because I think you could say the same in the reverse.
6566000	6570000	You know why you have, you know, this MMO.
6570000	6574000	And granted, there's some people that are probably going to be well organized or whatever in this.
6574000	6577000	But at the same time, you could also have well organized people that have an MBA.
6577000	6579000	I don't think one's necessarily better than the other.
6579000	6583000	It's just one went to college and I won.
6583000	6586000	And that's not to say that the person playing World of Warcraft didn't go to college either.
6586000	6594000	I mean, you're just they play a game that doesn't necessarily mean that mean anything.
6594000	6599000	I mean, how 10 year olds play the game. Seven year olds probably play World of Warcraft and they may be good at it.
6599000	6602000	Does that mean you should hire a seven year old for your fucking job?
6602000	6606000	No, they are free to adults. It doesn't matter, though.
6606000	6611000	I'm saying that the people that play this and necessarily can excel at this art.
6611000	6615000	I mean, if you're going to say like they have all these team working skills and stuff like that.
6615000	6619000	I'm sorry. But if you're hiring someone that can't work in a team, I mean, that that's a whole nother problem.
6619000	6622000	You need to just get rid of that employee anyways.
6622000	6626000	I don't think it has anything to do with their level of education. I don't know.
6626000	6633000	Rama in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says that my old job, we geeked it up, but you were shunned for playing WoW.
6633000	6639000	Here's my question. Why? I mean, I play WoW and I get that there's that stigma that's attached to it.
6639000	6644000	But no offense, you watch My Little Pony.
6644000	6648000	Here's my thing. My point with that. I'm not knocking the bronies and all that.
6648000	6652000	My point with that is that we've all got our thing. Right.
6652000	6657000	And usually it's it's it's usually a social thing. And a lot of it is like community and so forth. Right.
6657000	6666000	I you know, I wouldn't read this article to the extreme that, oh, a person who plays WoW is better than a person with an MBA.
6666000	6669000	Not necessarily. I wouldn't go that far with it.
6669000	6675000	But I would read into that is that this guy is saying, hey, don't laugh at the guy who runs a high end guild in WoW.
6676000	6682000	Don't write him off automatically because he plays a computer computer game, because actually it can take a lot of discipline.
6682000	6691000	And to that extent, I really agree with it, is that running a high end guild in WoW, you do have to manage people and you do have to learn how to settle down drama.
6691000	6696000	And yes, a lot of those experiences can carry over into the real world. It is a social interaction.
6696000	6700000	I'm not sure you appropriately are exposed to in college.
6700000	6704000	No, you're not. That's why they require you to take a speech class.
6704000	6710000	But one speech class doesn't really prepare you for that type of working with people.
6710000	6717000	So I think these two skills complement each other. It's not necessarily that one betters the other.
6717000	6723000	But I think the person who has the MBA and understand social interaction in WoW is a pretty good candidate.
6723000	6728000	Now, here's a very interesting question from Tiger Claw in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
6728000	6734000	He asks me, you're a corporate trainer by day, a Warcraft player by night.
6734000	6738000	Has your WoW experience helped improve your experience and your job?
6738000	6740000	That's a really good question.
6740000	6745000	Probably not as much as this show has complimented my job, believe it or not.
6745000	6755000	You know, think about it. In my day job, I have to get in front of a group of people and talk about, you know, subjects for, you know, seven and a half hours a day at some points.
6755000	6759000	And, you know, we do a very similar thing on this show in some ways.
6759000	6767000	I taught customer contact center for a long time where we had to, you know, explain to people how to answer the phone and you never know what could be on the other side.
6767000	6770000	Guess what I do at the end of the show that will be coming up later?
6770000	6774000	Answer phone calls and you never know what might be on the other side and kind of having to deal with that.
6774000	6779000	Not that we necessarily get irate callers on this show and that's not an invitation.
6779000	6784000	But, you know, some of those skills do kind of complement each other a bit.
6784000	6798000	After seven years of working in customer service where five of it was spent dealing with purely irate customers, I am much better dealing with people in an audio situation than I am looking at them.
6798000	6804000	You know, I can tell practically anything from a tone of voice than how their body language is acting.
6804000	6813000	So, and I think in some cases being able to infer from voice inflection is a rarer skill.
6813000	6819000	Now, here's something else. In my career, I've aspired to get into management.
6819000	6821000	You know, you want to move up the corporate ladder.
6821000	6822000	I'm sorry.
6822000	6833000	Well, shut up because I would actually like to train other trainers and I'd like to manage a department of trainers because at the end of the day, I want to have a more positive impact on how people learn.
6833000	6839000	Because, you know, I like to think I'm pretty good at what I do and I want to, you know, manage other people to kind of do it very similarly.
6839000	6845000	And I have applied for management positions, you know, at various places in my own company and so forth.
6845000	6850000	And usually I get turned down, which is rejection is something we have to face in life, right?
6850000	6854000	I get turned down because I don't have enough management experience.
6854000	6856000	And in a way, it kind of ticks me off.
6856000	6868000	Well, I shouldn't say it ticks me off, but it's disappointing because I've been managing this show in a way, in a way, right, for 11, 12 years.
6868000	6876000	A lot of that experience I have in World of Warcraft, I mean, I realize I can't put that on a resume, but it's kind of irritating that people don't necessarily look at that.
6876000	6884000	Like, yes, I do know how to quell dramatic situations and I know how to handle angry people and I know how to talk to people when people are performing badly.
6884000	6887000	You have to do all of that stuff in World of Warcraft.
6887000	6891000	So what this guy says in a way does kind of strike home.
6891000	6894000	Maybe we should give more credit to that than we are.
6895000	6900000	Not that I think I should get a job merely because of that. There's other things I can do, too, and I'm working on it.
6900000	6906000	But I don't think you should discount some of my other things just because they're tied to video games.
6908000	6910000	Any other thoughts, guys, before we move on?
6912000	6914000	Thank you. You summed it up.
6914000	6917000	Which, by the way, no desire to be management.
6918000	6919000	Well, that's you.
6919000	6923000	All right. SSJ 100 Matt in our chat room says,
6923000	6934000	Here's a fact and I'm going out on a limb and I don't want to speak for the host, but I can say that you guys, Rob, Jamie, Loki, learned more people and speech skills from just doing this show more than any class could teach you.
6934000	6940000	In many ways, yes. I can't speak for my co-host, but yeah, in a lot of ways.
6940000	6946000	Has this show benefited speech elements of your life?
6947000	6960000	I think that I've learned how to control vocal inflection a bit better rather than go all out, I guess. I mean, yeah, it's helped. It's constant practice.
6961000	6962000	Loki?
6964000	6965000	I don't know. I guess.
6967000	6971000	It's hard to tell where I pick up things. I don't know.
6972000	6979000	All right. Then again, I've been doing speech a long time. A little known fact, I won a speech contest when I was 17, a pretty big one.
6979000	6985000	And yeah, you know, I just I like talking. That should be obvious, right?
6985000	6989000	All right. Let's move on with some other video game news. Dark Saga.
6989000	6993000	In other news, see, I just controlled my vocal inflection.
6994000	7003000	There is a game out in Japan. It's a browser game that's too hard for children and everyone else.
7003000	7014000	It's a Disney game. It's a Disney Winnie the Pooh browser game, and it's been making children cry in Japan. Poor Japanese kids.
7014000	7015000	I'm laughing, but that's sad.
7015000	7020000	So basically, it's a game where Pooh tries to hit pitches in baseball.
7020000	7023000	You have to aim the bat with a mouse and click to swing.
7023000	7029000	But it has to be perfect timing for a home run, which is the only kind that counts.
7029000	7034000	And it's making children cry and also keeping my baseball soup super big in Japan.
7034000	7037000	So Winnie the Pooh in baseball making children cry.
7038000	7043000	Some folks in the chat room have been saying, I've been playing this.
7043000	7048000	Ross Steel UT says, Bravo, Disney. Now, now.
7048000	7053000	So maybe these developers didn't keep their audience in mind when they were developing the game.
7053000	7059000	I don't know. Or maybe they're just rougher on their kids in other countries. Who knows?
7059000	7066000	All right. Well, America McGee has turned to Kickstarter to go ahead and fund his next project.
7066000	7073000	A Kaniero Demon Hunters, which is sort of based off of Little Red Riding Hood,
7073000	7078000	but with, I guess, a Japanese mythology slant or something to it.
7078000	7083000	It could be from the fact that Alice Madam's Returns kind of flopped.
7083000	7086000	Maybe. No one wants to fund his game anymore.
7086000	7090000	But he's looking for $200,000 right now on Kickstarter for it.
7090000	7099000	And it's expected to be kind of ported to a bunch of different platforms, including Android, iOS, PC, Mac.
7099000	7101000	And they're seeing cross platform support.
7101000	7108000	And of course, also the stretch goals include Linux because that's always a stretch goal for some reason.
7108000	7115000	And right now they've got about 26 days to go and they're only $33,000 into it.
7115000	7117000	It doesn't seem like a big response yet.
7117000	7124000	The game looks pretty. It's kind of like a, I don't know, interesting art style, I guess.
7126000	7129000	Not something I would back probably, but it looks neat.
7131000	7133000	But a lot of that would be concept stuff, right?
7133000	7136000	Because how much of the work has actually been done if they're on Kickstarter?
7136000	7140000	Well, I mean, I don't know. Maybe.
7140000	7143000	I'm not sure really what he's looking for money for.
7144000	7147000	I'd have to watch the video, but I'm not going to.
7149000	7151000	Let's see. Why is he kickstarting this?
7153000	7156000	It says it's been developing since mid 2011.
7156000	7162000	And apparently they have had a closed beta running since this November or November 2012.
7165000	7168000	That's a great question. Why are they kickstarting it?
7168000	7172000	What is, I mean, it goes to ask that question. What's Kickstarter really for?
7172000	7174000	You're not really. Oh, here we go.
7174000	7176000	Or are you kickstarting the distribution?
7176000	7178000	No, no, no. Here's why we need backing.
7178000	7184000	We need to reach $200,000 to support our current team of developers in realizing the most complete version of the game.
7185000	7187000	That's very vague.
7187000	7193000	So they need $200,000 to do what?
7193000	7196000	So basically it says the backing will guarantee the following.
7196000	7204000	It's Android, iOS tablet versions, co-op multiplayer, equipment crafting system, and improved community support.
7204000	7211000	And then I guess also karma void dungeons, lockboxes, and a bunch of miscellaneous shit.
7211000	7216000	So it sounds like it's just they ran out of money for this.
7216000	7222000	And it looks like, judging by the description here, that it's going to be a free to play game.
7222000	7225000	So they're going to offer free and then they're going to have DLC.
7225000	7228000	Kind of like you would expect on like iOS and stuff.
7228000	7232000	So, I don't know.
7232000	7235000	Sag in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,
7235000	7238000	The money certainly seems to be for finishing, but maybe also marketing?
7238000	7241000	It's weird. So they want finishing round of funding.
7243000	7247000	I would think if that's the case and the game's already practically done,
7247000	7250000	it's coming out whether they meet their goal or not.
7250000	7254000	They just want the money to be able to market it and distribute it maybe a little more efficiently.
7254000	7258000	Or to a wider potential audience. It's an investment.
7258000	7266000	Well they're trying to get it on Steam Greenlight because that's one of the things that they have on there.
7268000	7270000	I don't know. It's just...
7270000	7277000	I'm kind of like, it's almost to me like his name is meaningless because Alice was so good
7277000	7281000	and then everything else that's come after that hasn't been as good.
7281000	7286000	And so it's just kind of like, do we really trust American McGee?
7286000	7288000	I don't know.
7288000	7295000	Although Bad Day LA looked hilarious, but apparently it was not very good.
7295000	7300000	Alright. I'm going to try very hard not to butcher the details of this next story,
7300000	7306000	but this is kind of a follow up to a very difficult subject we talked about a couple weeks ago.
7306000	7314000	On this show we had a pretty in-depth conversation after the Newtown massacre that happened.
7314000	7320000	You know, that horrible, horrible, sick shooting that happened at the elementary school back east.
7320000	7323000	And I warned you guys. They're coming for the video games.
7323000	7327000	Well, here it is. Here it is.
7327000	7330000	And I warned you. Here it is.
7331000	7333000	Running around the game blogs this week.
7333000	7337000	A January 12th event being organized by Southington.
7337000	7341000	This town is about 30 miles from where the tragedy took place.
7341000	7343000	Southington SOS.
7343000	7348000	It's a collection of representatives from the Connecticut town's organizations like YMCA,
7348000	7353000	Board of Education, Fire Department, United Way, Clergy, Chamber of Commerce, etc.
7353000	7359000	They are going to be encouraging people to turn in violent video games.
7361000	7365000	And then they are going to destroy them and they're going to burn them.
7365000	7370000	Just like communities did in the past to Dixie Chicks albums.
7370000	7376000	And I'm sure books and movies and porn.
7376000	7380000	And a series of fine art in Renaissance Italy.
7380000	7383000	Witches. Absolutely.
7386000	7388000	From the organization.
7388000	7392000	There are youngsters who appear to be consumed with violent video games.
7392000	7401000	This is a quote from an interview with Polygon Joe Arardi from Southington School Superintendent.
7401000	7405000	There are youngsters who appear to be consumed with violent video games.
7405000	7407000	I'm not certain if that's a good thing.
7407000	7411000	If this encourages one courageous conversation with a parent and their child, this is a success.
7411000	7416000	We're suggesting that for parents who have a child or children who play violent video games
7416000	7418000	to first of all view the games.
7418000	7422000	We're asking parents to better understand what their child is doing.
7422000	7424000	Have a conversation about next steps.
7424000	7428000	If parents are comfortable with their child's gaming habits, we're comfortable.
7428000	7434000	If they decide you're not so comfortable, you can go to the local drive-in movie theater on January 12th.
7434000	7441000	Turn in the games for a $25 gift voucher for a local water park or other local forms of entertainment.
7441000	7446000	Let's go see an R-rated movie with that $25 voucher.
7446000	7448000	Let's go see Django Unchained.
7448000	7452000	That'll be a good family film we could go check out.
7452000	7458000	Let's go see Les Mis. Watch all those people die.
7462000	7470000	Once those items are turned in, the discs will be snapped, tossed into a town dumpster, and likely burned.
7470000	7473000	Now, another further statement from the organization.
7473000	7482000	The group's action is not intended to be construed as statement declaring that violent video games were the cause of the shocking violence in Newtown.
7482000	7483000	Too late.
7483000	7490000	Rather, we're saying that there is ample evidence that violent video games along with violent media of all kinds,
7490000	7495000	including TV and movies portraying story after story, showing a continuous stream of violence and killing,
7495000	7499000	has contributed to increasing aggressiveness, fear, anxiety,
7499000	7503000	and is desensitizing our children to acts of violence, including bullying.
7503000	7508000	Social and political commentators, as well as elected officials, including the president,
7508000	7516000	are attributing violent crime to many factors, including inadequate gun control laws, a culture of violence, and recreational culture of violence.
7516000	7523000	So what I'm hearing with this, how do we respond to the violence and killing and the increasing aggressiveness?
7523000	7524000	How do we respond?
7524000	7529000	We're going to get the angry mod to snap this shit in half and set it on fire.
7529000	7531000	That's not aggressive.
7531000	7536000	Well, you know, you know, Rob, fear leads to anger, and anger leads to hate, and hate leads to suffering.
7536000	7537000	Just saying.
7537000	7549000	But, you know, once again, the integral part of their plan is that they want parents to be responsible for their children,
7549000	7553000	which is never going to fucking happen, because it's just unfortunately nowadays,
7553000	7559000	they obviously don't want to blame the poor parenting for any of this violence,
7559000	7566000	but because it was the parent that was supposed to view those games and figure out if it was appropriate for their child,
7566000	7571000	and they failed to do that because they're parents and they don't want to take responsibility for their own actions.
7571000	7575000	It's like a contradiction. It's like, we want you to take responsibility for this stuff,
7575000	7582000	but at the same time we're going to blame, you know, whatever on these video games instead of taking responsibility for this stuff.
7582000	7586000	I'm sure it's no surprise. Our chatters are lit up on this topic here.
7586000	7590000	Dark Tetsuya says, so why is the bonfire just focusing on video games?
7590000	7595000	And is anybody thinking about the poor air quality that we're going to get from burning all this, like, plastic?
7595000	7597000	I mean, that's got to be bad for the children.
7597000	7600000	What if January 12th is a winner's spare the air day?
7600000	7602000	Then what?
7602000	7611000	What happens if that crazy, you know, toxic fumes coming from the dump or, you know, whatever causes a child to get enraged and murder somebody?
7611000	7613000	Then what? Then what are we going to do?
7613000	7616000	Uh, let's see.
7616000	7622000	Uh, DKB says they should just pretend to burn them and then take them all down to GameStop for some money.
7622000	7624000	Well, that would be a good idea for a fundraiser.
7624000	7627000	Well, burn the GameStop. There's all the evil games in there.
7627000	7630000	That's like going through the, I don't know.
7630000	7636000	Ross Steel UT says, in cases like this, I'm thankful the Supreme Court ruled against Leland Yee.
7636000	7644000	Tiger Claw says, oftentimes it's the older brother who buys the game that the younger kid gets exposed to, so it's not the parents at fault.
7644000	7651000	Oh, of course not. It's not the parents at all letting the child, you know, letting the older brother buy the game for, you know, the younger kid.
7651000	7655000	Um, they could ask the younger kid, okay, where'd you get the game?
7655000	7657000	Oh, my brother bought it for me.
7657000	7661000	Okay, then they deal with the older brother and they scold both, you know, kids.
7661000	7668000	It's still fucking, oh, well, I didn't know the older brother was giving, you know, ecstasy to my child.
7668000	7672000	I guess I'm not at fault that, you know, he's all drugged out.
7672000	7678000	Oh, it's not my fault that, you know, he's, he's an alcoholic now because his older brother bought him booze.
7678000	7682000	I'm the victim here. I have to raise an alcoholic son now.
7682000	7685000	You may be interested in an interesting follow-up.
7685000	7695000	In another article that Polygon did later in the week, Christopher J. Ferguson, who is the chairman of the Texas A&M International University Department of Psychology and Communications said,
7695000	7700000	Don't get me wrong. I am fully aware you are trying to do what you think is best.
7700000	7716000	But there is real risk in focusing people's attention on the wrong thing, as well as contributing to historical patterns of mortal panic that tend to surround new media, often despite evidence media is not harmful, even if it may be offensive.
7716000	7719000	Thoughts?
7719000	7732000	Well, yeah, I mean, it's, it's classic moral panic. Whenever we have traumatic events like this historically going all the way back to the Greeks, people tend to blame the media.
7732000	7738000	It makes us feel like we know what happened and that we can fix it. It's very easy to really focus on the media as a boogeyman.
7738000	7740000	Witch hunting. That's all it is.
7740000	7746000	Really, at the end of the day, we just have to blame Fox News for, you know, all this anyways, because who would have gotten who?
7746000	7750000	Don't tell me that these people are actually smart enough to come up with ideas on their own.
7750000	7754000	They heard Fox's. Oh, my God, those video games. Oh, my God. They are violent.
7754000	7760000	They are causing murderers. Why aren't we doing anything about this evil, evil non-Christian thing?
7760000	7765000	I mean, I'm sorry. It's just.
7765000	7767000	Mob mentality, I guess some further quotes.
7767000	7774000	Oh, go ahead. If I may say there's a one name in history that should totally illustrate the point McCarthy.
7774000	7779000	Funny you bring that up. Let me read one more quote from the follow up.
7779000	7783000	If you're going to have a conversation now, I'd be careful about how you broach it.
7783000	7791000	Make it clear that you understand that video games don't contribute to mass shootings. Make it clear that you're not indulging in this moral panic.
7791000	7801000	Speaking about the 50s, back then, they had psychiatrists going before Congress saying comics not only caused not only excuse me,
7801000	7808000	going before Congress saying comics cause not only delinquency, but homosexuality.
7808000	7815000	I know Superman totally made me gay. We kind of look back on these things and sort of giggle and go,
7815000	7820000	oh, my God, I can't believe people back in the 50s thought comic books were making killers and that kind of stuff.
7820000	7825000	But then we don't learn from it. Whenever new media comes out, we all freak out about that one, too.
7825000	7829000	I can't believe that black people couldn't marry white people. That's so silly.
7829000	7838000	You can't marry gays. I got nothing.
7838000	7848000	Yeah, it's. Look, just it really is people not paying attention to what's not in front of them, you know,
7848000	7854000	and this is this is actually I'd say a very deep downfall of human nature.
7854000	7859000	You know, we have phrases out there about learning from history so you don't repeat it.
7859000	7863000	But people really don't learn from history. People don't like to think outside of their box.
7863000	7867000	They want something to distract them from the troubles going on around them.
7867000	7873000	So they like, oh, well, so and so has mental health issues. We have this going on.
7873000	7876000	We have that going on. Let's blame games. It's easy.
7876000	7881000	Here's the thing. Here's my opinion. If you want to snap your disks in half and set it on fire, that's fine.
7881000	7888000	That's your prerogative. And the parents, as the ones who probably bought that disk for their kids, have every right to do so.
7888000	7892000	But in my opinion, don't do it because of a panic going on in society.
7892000	7898000	Do it because your kids aren't doing their homework. That's why you snap the disks and set them on fire.
7898000	7903000	You don't do it because, you know, or let's be smart here.
7903000	7909000	At least if you're going to, you know, do that stuff, do trade them in and sell them or something and get some money back or something.
7909000	7912000	I mean, a voucher to a water park. Cool.
7912000	7917000	If, you know, if your games are worth more than twenty five dollars and, you know, you should probably take them somewhere, at least trade them in.
7917000	7920000	At least be some somewhat smart about if you're going to get rid of it.
7920000	7925000	You don't like, you know, if you think your car is evil, you don't drive it off a cliff.
7925000	7930000	OK, you would think, OK, if this car is not very good, I'm just going to go ahead and sell it to a dealership or something.
7930000	7932000	You've never driven Christine.
7932000	7936000	Yeah, well, Christine doesn't. You don't drive Christine. Christine drives you.
7936000	7942000	But well, I mean, the thing is to also now let's take a look at something outside the box.
7942000	7946000	They're creating more litter by burning plastic items.
7946000	7953000	They're releasing fumes into the air. So they're actually creating a health and safety hazard with their little witch hunt.
7953000	7958000	To be fair, they said it would be likely incinerated. They may not actually do it.
7958000	7963000	They may just compact it into a little cube. Who knows? Does it really change anything?
7963000	7966000	Would it be a game cube?
7966000	7970000	It's still mob mentality and it's what gets people hurt in the long run.
7970000	7978000	You're promoting violence on this show because I'm about ready to jump over this fucking table and strangle you for that joke.
7978000	7983000	In happier news, let's get to the mailbag.
7984000	7990000	Every week you guys send us e-mails with some insight. We'll probably get some e-mails on that topic next week.
7990000	7994000	And I invite you to respond via e-mail. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
7994000	8000000	Dark Sakura is going to open up the mailbag. Dive in head first and read some e-mails here on air.
8000000	8004000	Dark Sakura, what are the e-mails this week?
8004000	8008000	Yeah, we have two. Just two.
8008000	8013000	The first one is from Nasty Canasta.
8013000	8018000	OLR Crew, hang onto your asses because I'm putting you on the spot with a question.
8018000	8023000	What is an unpopular opinion you have for a video game?
8023000	8031000	I don't know. I don't really care if my opinion is unpopular, so I don't know.
8031000	8034000	Does that make sense?
8035000	8040000	An unpopular opinion you have on games.
8040000	8044000	Pokemon's kind of repetitive, guys.
8044000	8050000	Yet you guys are all really into it. It's been the same thing for how long. It's kind of repetitive.
8050000	8052000	Just saying.
8052000	8056000	Chrono Trigger was also not the best Super Nintendo game. That's my opinion.
8056000	8059000	I hate Kaiden.
8059000	8064000	Also contributing to the violence on this program.
8064000	8071000	I guess that would be mine. I don't think that Kaiden is a very good love interest for Fem Shop.
8071000	8076000	I'm not sure that's a hugely popular opinion in the first place, but that's fine.
8076000	8080000	How about Excite Truck was the best launch game for the Wii?
8080000	8083000	It's pretty good.
8083000	8085000	More email of this one.
8085000	8089000	My scandalous claim is I did not enjoy Chrono Trigger.
8089000	8095000	I bought the DS version when it was on sale for $10 new and restarted about four times because other games caught my attention.
8095000	8100000	On my final restart, I put in an honest effort to see what made the game so good.
8100000	8106000	Though once I reached the era where you first visit the floating continent, around 20 hours in, I lost interest.
8106000	8109000	Dude, that's the best part of the game. You're about to go to the undersea palace.
8109000	8115000	Now, to be fair, as much as you might think I'm high-fiving this guy, I didn't say Chrono Trigger was a bad game.
8115000	8118000	I said it's not the best game. In fact, it's not really in my top five.
8118000	8121000	But it would definitely be in my top ten.
8121000	8123000	Twenty. Top twenty.
8129000	8133000	The battle system had its interesting points, but I did not see what the hubbub was about with the story.
8133000	8136000	Sorry to all you fanboys and fangirls out there.
8136000	8139000	To this day, the RPGs that's near and dear to me is Final Fantasy IX.
8139000	8146000	I just love everything about that game. However, I'm looking forward to the inevitable and hopefully 3D remake of Final Fantasy VI on 3DS.
8146000	8152000	In the meantime, I should get back to my DS backlog to play the Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy IV.
8152000	8155000	Garris! Yes. The nasty Canasta.
8155000	8157000	Last email.
8158000	8161000	Hey, it's Chris109. I like this show.
8161000	8166000	Oh yeah, update PSP site. I still use it. I guess.
8166000	8168000	Not gonna happen.
8168000	8170000	Well, I mean, I'm talking about the grammar.
8170000	8174000	But my favorite game of 2012 is PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.
8174000	8178000	And my disappointing game is Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword.
8178000	8181000	Okay. Thank you for sharing.
8183000	8185000	There's no why!
8185000	8187000	Yeah, we want to know why.
8189000	8191000	I'll tell you what this emailer did do, though.
8191000	8194000	Totally remind me of an unpopular gaming opinion.
8194000	8196000	Y'all ready? Y'all ready? Y'all ready?
8196000	8198000	Watch. Watch what I'm about to say.
8198000	8200000	And you fuckin' come at me, bro.
8200000	8202000	Ocarina of Time?
8202000	8204000	Ain't all that.
8204000	8206000	I fuckin' said it. Yeah, I did. Yeah, I did.
8206000	8208000	Yeah, I did. Come at me.
8208000	8210000	Majora's Mask. Not fun.
8210000	8212000	My favorite 3D Zelda game?
8212000	8213000	Wind Waker.
8213000	8215000	Link to the Past. Superior in every way.
8217000	8219000	Bring it.
8220000	8223000	Well, now that we just had, like, 50 people unsubscribe from the show,
8223000	8225000	thanks for the emails, guys!
8228000	8232000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8234000	8239000	In a related topic, let's get to the FUs of the week, shall we?
8240000	8243000	I can just see people, like, listening to this show at their work,
8243000	8245000	sitting at their desk, going, WHAT?
8246000	8249000	Now we're gonna have an angry mob coming after us.
8265000	8268000	Fuck people. Just seriously.
8268000	8270000	You know... I'll try.
8272000	8274000	No one likes being trolled.
8274000	8277000	No one likes being pushed.
8277000	8280000	And if someone has stated that they don't like something,
8280000	8282000	don't fucking rub it in.
8282000	8286000	I'm not gonna go on Facebook anymore. I'm done with it. I'm done with people.
8286000	8289000	There's all the more reason for me to just stay in my room
8289000	8293000	and not look at people or talk to them or anything.
8293000	8295000	I don't get people anymore.
8295000	8297000	We should cut Facebook in half and throw in a dumpster, honestly.
8298000	8300000	Seriously. Loki.
8300000	8303000	But that would be throwing books away.
8303000	8305000	And not our community.
8305000	8308000	So would you throw books away and save face?
8309000	8314000	No, you use the papers by your starter for the future.
8315000	8317000	Only when it's a safe day to burn, though.
8317000	8319000	Always check the burn.
8320000	8321000	Loki.
8321000	8324000	I guess I view the fact that game making is hard.
8325000	8327000	Are you making a game, Loki?
8327000	8329000	No, I'm not making a game.
8330000	8332000	I don't know if I have an FU of the week.
8332000	8335000	For the most part, things are going pretty well.
8337000	8340000	I guess I view the fact that the holidays are now totally, truly over
8340000	8343000	and so traffic will be bad once again tomorrow.
8343000	8345000	And that when it rains, nobody knows how to drive.
8345000	8348000	Come on, people. It's been raining since the dawn of time.
8348000	8350000	We should know how to drive in it by now.
8350000	8352000	Seriously. Stop it.
8355000	8357000	That's it for the FUs of the week.
8357000	8360000	Let's do a couple more news stories and then we will start taking your calls
8360000	8362000	at 1-877-GAME-OLR
8362000	8364000	or you can call us via Skype.
8364000	8368000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to call us there.
8368000	8370000	But first, two more stories. Loki?
8370000	8374000	There was some concept art that came out for an unpublished hero title
8374000	8376000	from Activision, of course.
8376000	8379000	Sing Hero, which was, I believe, one of the trademarks
8379000	8383000	that they had filed a while back, in 2009 it looks like.
8383000	8388000	And of course, you know, that never happened because...
8389000	8391000	I don't know.
8391000	8394000	Maybe karaoke games weren't just that popular.
8395000	8398000	You are absolutely right. I remember reporting on those trademarks
8398000	8401000	and Sing Hero was one of them because we all theorized about
8401000	8404000	what Activision's Karaoke Revolution ripoff would look like.
8404000	8406000	So this really isn't a surprise.
8406000	8409000	Yeah, and they have, you know, the concept art
8409000	8411000	and it looks like they've got...
8412000	8416000	I don't know, a bunch of cliche-looking characters in there.
8417000	8421000	The artist that looks like she's wearing lingerie
8421000	8424000	and the teen queen who looks like she's Kelly Clarkson
8424000	8427000	and the rocker who looks like she shops at...
8427000	8430000	Kelly Clarkson's like 30 now, though.
8430000	8431000	Well...
8431000	8434000	But I guess this game was a few years old.
8435000	8437000	It's just very...
8438000	8440000	okay, I guess.
8440000	8443000	Alrighty. Well, I got a story.
8443000	8445000	Try not to get too upset, you guys.
8445000	8446000	I know you guys are big fans.
8446000	8448000	Although, I have to say...
8448000	8449000	Oh, never mind.
8449000	8451000	Sorry, real quick, real quick. I just want to comment.
8451000	8456000	The showman that they have on there kind of looks like Captain Jack.
8456000	8458000	You know, minus the hat.
8458000	8461000	It looks like a very, you know...
8461000	8464000	Maybe that or M. Bison. I can't really...
8464000	8466000	I may be confusing those.
8466000	8468000	Go! Left, go, right, go, pick up track.
8468000	8469000	Left, go, right, go, yay.
8469000	8470000	Alright.
8470000	8473000	Try not to get too upset at this last story tonight, everybody.
8473000	8474000	Get your Kleenexes out.
8474000	8477000	This is going to be sadder than Les Mis, y'all.
8477000	8480000	Zynga is pulling the plug on 11 of their games.
8480000	8481000	That's right.
8481000	8484000	The plug is being pulled on such games like Petville,
8484000	8486000	Indiana Jones Adventure World,
8486000	8488000	and Mafia Wars 2.
8488000	8489000	That one's actually kind of surprising.
8489000	8491000	I thought Mafia Wars was a big deal.
8491000	8494000	But they are being pulled from various phone app stores.
8494000	8495000	They're being shut down.
8495000	8497000	No longer accepting new players.
8498000	8500000	Also, a lot of games from Zynga Japan.
8500000	8502000	Because, as you know, they were closed.
8502000	8505000	So, if you were a big fan of Machi Suku,
8505000	8508000	or Moji Tomo, Montopia.
8508000	8510000	You know what Montopia is?
8510000	8511000	No, what is it?
8511000	8512000	It's a Pokemon ripoff.
8516000	8517000	Poor Zynga.
8517000	8520000	Oh yes, poor Zynga and their ripoff games.
8520000	8522000	Wait, you mean...
8522000	8524000	You mean copy doesn't pay?
8524000	8526000	Hey, don't copy that.
8526000	8528000	Don't copy that floppy Zynga.
8528000	8530000	Copy kills music.
8531000	8533000	1877 game OLR,
8533000	8535000	or our username is orangelaundryo on Skype.
8535000	8538000	The Skype line is open now if you want to give us a call.
8538000	8541000	Meanwhile, I will turn to Loki for last minute stories.
8541000	8543000	Although, I'm not expecting he has a lot tonight.
8543000	8547000	There's some information about Valve's Steam PC.
8547000	8549000	It's supposed to be coming out in 2013,
8549000	8551000	running on Linux as we kind of all figured.
8552000	8558000	I guess it's being reported from this German IT site, Gollum.
8558000	8563000	And one of the Valve engineers told an audience in Germany about this thing.
8563000	8569000	And I guess it's going to be revealed either at GDC or E3.
8569000	8571000	I would be surprised if it...
8571000	8573000	GDC makes sense.
8575000	8578000	I was kind of hoping it would be next week during CES.
8579000	8581000	Let's get to the phones. We got a call coming in.
8581000	8583000	Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio. Who's this?
8585000	8587000	Hello there, yo, OLR.
8587000	8589000	This is that one, AK Ripper from Sweden.
8589000	8591000	I haven't called you for like...
8591000	8593000	Oh, a few years.
8593000	8595000	I have fucking missed you.
8595000	8597000	I am so glad you are back, AK Ripper.
8597000	8599000	Good evening!
8599000	8601000	Of sorts.
8601000	8603000	What is on your mind, my friend? Long time.
8603000	8605000	Yeah, long time no see.
8605000	8607000	Or here. Whatever.
8607000	8609000	What's up?
8609000	8611000	Well, good question. Of sorts.
8611000	8613000	I usually...
8613000	8617000	Well, you already did your game of the year things. Of sorts.
8617000	8620000	And I haven't done any, so what the hell?
8620000	8623000	Well, mostly because, well, what?
8623000	8629000	How many games do I actually play that I can count that I thought was good this year?
8629000	8631000	Usually, I have to cut a few.
8631000	8634000	And I could cut a few fingers.
8634000	8639000	And it's like, well, I'm still having trouble to come up with a few.
8639000	8641000	So, what the hell?
8643000	8645000	You know, you're not the only one that feels that way.
8645000	8650000	There was some game outlet, and I can't remember who, and I don't remember if it was an indie or a major, and I apologize.
8650000	8653000	But they did not name Journey their game of the year.
8653000	8655000	They did not name Walking Dead their game of the year.
8655000	8657000	Or any of that other stuff.
8657000	8659000	Their game of the year was nothing.
8659000	8662000	There was nothing out this year that deserved to be called game of the year.
8662000	8668000	I thought that was a pretty ballsy thing to do, although it might have just been to get more hits and to get people like me to talk about it on their shows.
8668000	8672000	But they said, there is no game of the year.
8672000	8674000	Is that the camp you think you're in?
8675000	8677000	But...
8679000	8682000	But, well, sort of, in some way.
8682000	8684000	Because, well, here's the thing, though.
8684000	8691000	In a way, though, in a way you actually, what was it, someone said, gamelet, whatever.
8691000	8701000	They said, well, the year can sort of be told as like a few minor, huge disappointments of sorts.
8701000	8708000	Which, in a way, though, I would say that one of them was really a disappointment.
8708000	8713000	The other one, though, after all, in a way, not so much.
8714000	8716000	Amy 3.
8717000	8721000	Well, tell me already, what would you say was definitely a disappointment?
8721000	8723000	Diablo 3.
8723000	8725000	Oh, god, yes. I'm with you there.
8725000	8728000	But, no, not that, but really.
8728000	8732000	Diablo 3. Really. What the fucking hell?
8732000	8736000	What the fucking hell? I agree with you there. That's exactly what I said.
8736000	8744000	Now, the rage has already been passed on that, but we're just gonna say that, yes, it was a major, major disappointment.
8744000	8750000	In a way, sort of like, well, I have this big, fancy box of sorts, but I'm never gonna play you anyway.
8750000	8756000	Because, well, I only play it for a story, which means that, well, I'm gonna play you once, and then it was fun of sorts.
8756000	8767000	But, yeah, well, now what? Grind, like, a few hours for, like, a few, actually, game days?
8767000	8769000	Fucking hell, no.
8769000	8774000	That's what the internet said when they heard there was no LAN play in Diablo 3. What the fucking hell?
8774000	8776000	That is exactly what the internet said.
8776000	8786000	But, also, maybe it would be fun of sorts if I did have any friends to play it with, but since I don't, um, yeah.
8786000	8795000	Okay, ripper. Okay, ripper. I know you've got friends. I know you've got friends. You've got friends here at the OLR.
8795000	8808000	Oh, well, not in the, but I didn't look that, oh, well, not in the, um, okay, well, aha, I mean, not that way, but, well, I wasn't looking for a sort, but I have fun! Whatever.
8809000	8825000	Anyway, what the hell was a minor disappointment, too? Once again, though, ME3 of sorts, but then, in a way, they have quasi-repaired it of sorts since that extended cut of sorts.
8825000	8836000	And the DLC that's been released so far has been like, thank you, you should have said that, like, from the beginning, you fucks. Thank you.
8836000	8845000	The, you know what, with all the, the problem with Mass Effect 3 is that that game got dragged over the coals by the internet for the ending.
8845000	8855000	I mean, you would have thought they shot the pope. You would have thought BioWare shot the pope the way people reacted to the ending of that game, and it's like, it wasn't that bad.
8855000	8866000	And it's like, thank god, Square Enix, Square Enix should be thanking base god every day that the internet did not exist when Final Fantasy VII came out.
8866000	8878000	Because if Final Fantasy VII had had the internet the way, the way the internet exists today, can you imagine, they would have had to do Final Fantasy VII Part 2 just to fix the ending, I mean, in the fuckery in Final Fantasy VII's ending.
8878000	8890000	Let's be real. Final Fantasy VII, people look back and say, it's one of the best games of all time. The ending is fucking garbage. Is that an unpopular game opinion, DarkSakura? The ending of Final Fantasy VII is fucking garbage?
8890000	8898000	What had the worst ending? Mass Effect 3's original cut, which I know you've seen on YouTube, or Final Fantasy VII?
8898000	8899000	Final Fantasy VII.
8899000	8900000	Thank you.
8900000	8903000	Except, you know what the most disappointing part of that was?
8903000	8904000	Aerith's size opening.
8905000	8908000	Sorry, AK Ripper, I just...
8908000	8928000	Oh, well, other than that though, I got nothing of sorts. It's more like, hi, I'm still a hi, I do exist actually, and for some strange reason, I decided to reuptake of sorts my activities on Monday, what is it, Monday mornings, actually.
8928000	8936000	Because, well, you have your show on Monday morning, in this time.
8936000	8943000	That's right, over there in Sweden. Well, AK Ripper, I'm tickled pink that you called into the show tonight, so don't be a stranger.
8943000	8945000	No, no, no, we won't.
8945000	8949000	Oh, well, but, the hardest, as we say around these parts.
8949000	8953000	Alright, take care my friend, bye bye.
8953000	8954000	Yeah, later.
8954000	8960000	You know, I need to plan a trip to Sweden, not only will I visit my friend AK Ripper, but the ABBA museum is opening this year.
8960000	8963000	I'm just saying, girl, I'm just saying.
8963000	8971000	1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you would like to give us a call. Did you have other last minute stories?
8971000	8972000	No.
8972000	8977000	Okay, I do have some Twitter topics. Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send some Twitter topics.
8977000	8984000	Which, looks like Tigerclaw is the only one remembering to send these, but maybe I'm not plugging in enough in the show, I don't know.
8984000	8989000	But he does send us a couple of news stories. One of them I want to read here.
8989000	8994000	Majesco Boston has closed. Oh, how did we look over that? That is unfortunate.
8994000	9002000	Yeah, Majesco Boston did close. This was a senior producer in a Facebook update. It said, I enjoyed my time at Majesco.
9002000	9007000	I hate that it ended so abruptly with the whole studio closing, but that's the way the industry is.
9007000	9011000	Anybody need a design director? Sorry to hear about that.
9011000	9013000	They have to hire me first.
9013000	9016000	During the holidays. Bastards.
9016000	9018000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
9018000	9020000	Uh, Rama, who else would it be?
9020000	9022000	Hey, Rama, how you doing?
9022000	9024000	I'm doing good, how about you?
9024000	9029000	Good! Were you convention going this weekend? Were you at the, uh, what was it? MagFest?
9029000	9035000	Do not get me started on MagFest. I was supposed to go, but I didn't go.
9035000	9038000	Ooh, you sound a little ruffled. Alright, I will not go there.
9038000	9048000	Ruffle does not mean to describe, and if you've been following my private journal and so forth, you can kind of see posts in regards to why.
9048000	9051000	But if it's your private journal, how am I supposed to follow it? It's private.
9051000	9054000	But you're on the list. You're in the inner circle.
9054000	9057000	Oh, okay. Oh, I'm special. Yay.
9057000	9060000	So what you calling about tonight?
9060000	9064000	I just want to say that, um, Zelda 2 is the best Zelda game of all time.
9064000	9066000	Blasphemy!
9066000	9069000	Blasphemy nothing. It was an awesome side-scroller for what it was.
9069000	9071000	You and my husband agree.
9071000	9077000	Zelda 2 was pretty awesome. And part of the fact that it's awesome is that it's, like, hard as hell.
9077000	9082000	So, like, if you beat that game when you were, like, nine or ten years old, you're rad.
9082000	9085000	Hey, you want to know the main reason why Zelda 2 is the best one?
9085000	9086000	What?
9086000	9088000	You have a jump button.
9088000	9094000	Zing. But, I'm sorry, Link to the Past. All the way. Link to the Past.
9094000	9096000	See, that gets to number two in my book.
9096000	9099000	Ah. Zelda 2 is pretty good, though. Don't get me wrong.
9099000	9106000	And I don't, as before everybody sends in all the hate mail, again, I'm not calling Ocarina of Time a bad game, necessarily.
9106000	9110000	But just the wank on the internet about that game.
9110000	9115000	I don't know. Maybe I'm just old. I'm old and I don't get it. I'm out of tune.
9115000	9120000	But I think Zelda Link to the Past was just an amazing gaming experience, start to finish.
9120000	9124000	Oh, it is. But you know what? I'm an anime fandom. I'm getting old.
9124000	9126000	And I don't understand what the hell is going on there, either.
9126000	9130000	I just show up, take pictures, go back to the room, and party, and that's it.
9130000	9134000	What cons are on your calendar for 2013?
9134000	9139000	Well, this weekend we have Katori Cons, a small convention on a college campus.
9139000	9143000	And I think we are on break till PAX East.
9145000	9148000	PAX East would be fun. But I don't do traveling right now.
9148000	9152000	I'm hoping I can do PAX East. We'll see. I heard the media reg opened up, so I'll let you know.
9153000	9158000	You know, they have a local convention here in Sacramento, SacAnime, and it's been blowing up.
9158000	9160000	They are finally officially in the Sacramento Convention Center.
9160000	9162000	They had something like 5,000 people this weekend.
9162000	9166000	That's good. One of my friends, Kyle Hebert, he was there as a guest.
9166000	9168000	Oh, very nice. Very cool.
9169000	9175000	Sadly, we didn't go. You know, originally I had been scheduled to volunteer.
9175000	9178000	But then some things changed, and I didn't end up getting to do that.
9178000	9182000	And it was my anniversary Friday anyway, so it kind of didn't end up working out.
9184000	9187000	Wow. Well, I hope to see you at PAX East.
9187000	9190000	But if not, maybe I can convince you to come to Fanime. Maybe.
9191000	9193000	Well, I can't because I'll be going to Animazement.
9193000	9199000	Because a friend of mine, she's retiring from cosplay, a complete Sailor Moon troop.
9199000	9202000	I'm showing up as Human Artemis, so yeah.
9202000	9205000	Alright, alright. What about Dragon Con?
9205000	9211000	Because I have not been asked, I've been told I'm going to Dragon Con.
9211000	9216000	Well, if none of my peeps are going to AWA, which is at the end of the month in Atlanta,
9216000	9218000	I may just show up at Dragon Con.
9219000	9221000	Make it happen, bro.
9221000	9224000	We'll see what we can do. We'll have to play the boys are back in town.
9226000	9230000	Before I let you go, anything to plug on Anime Jam Session coming up?
9230000	9232000	On your show that's on Tuesdays here at VOG.
9233000	9237000	No, not yet, but I didn't know I was going so long because I have an awesome gaming story to tell you.
9237000	9238000	Oh!
9238000	9239000	From what's going on in my family.
9239000	9240000	Please, go ahead.
9240000	9245000	Okay, now my sister, she has a baby girl, and they were playing Kingdom Hearts together,
9245000	9250000	so she gave my niece a controller that's not working so she can help fight the Heartless.
9251000	9252000	Okay.
9252000	9257000	So after one of the battles was finished, my sister told her that they need to fight a few more
9257000	9259000	so they can get more money to buy new armor.
9259000	9265000	So my niece went, oh right, she jumps up, ran to the kitchen where my sister heard something rummaging.
9265000	9271000	My niece comes back and dumps down a fistful of coins on her lap with a smile and says,
9271000	9273000	let's go buy some more armors, mommy.
9274000	9276000	That is adorable.
9276000	9277000	Yes.
9277000	9279000	And this kid is only two and a half.
9282000	9284000	Potential future gamer?
9284000	9286000	Oh, you got that right.
9286000	9287000	Well said, well said.
9287000	9288000	Well said.
9288000	9291000	All right, well Rama, I should probably let you go so we can try to get one more call,
9291000	9293000	but thank you very much for the call tonight.
9293000	9294000	Anytime.
9294000	9295000	All right, take care, buddy.
9295000	9296000	Later.
9296000	9302000	Lata 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to give us a call.
9302000	9307000	Checking the Twitters real quick for one more Twitter topic, because I know TigerClaud sent us something else.
9307000	9314000	Ed, the FTC orders Google to stop charging high royalties on FRAND-related patents.
9315000	9322000	There was a lot in the news this week about Google and so forth and antitrust decisions and all this stuff.
9322000	9328000	The FTC issued a consent order this week forbidding Google from charging a lot of money
9328000	9334000	for certain critical patents it gained when it bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion in May 2012.
9334000	9338000	Good news for Apple and Microsoft, but particularly for Microsoft,
9338000	9347000	because Motorola Mobility wanted to charge $4 billion a year in royalties for patents Motorola holds on Wi-Fi and video technology.
9348000	9349000	Let's go to the phones.
9349000	9350000	We've got more calls coming in.
9350000	9351000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
9351000	9352000	Who's this?
9352000	9354000	I'm Stoke Broken Chat.
9354000	9355000	Hey, what is up?
9355000	9357000	And we even see video, a video caller.
9357000	9358000	Good job.
9358000	9359000	Hey, how you doing?
9359000	9360000	Good.
9360000	9364000	Sorry we don't have our webcam up, but what is on your mind, my friend?
9364000	9365000	Nothing.
9365000	9367000	This is the first time I've actually listened live.
9367000	9368000	I usually listen to it as a podcast.
9368000	9369000	Yeah?
9369000	9372000	Yeah, it's a different experience watching the chat go by.
9372000	9376000	Yeah, it's like having that live commentary track we were talking about earlier.
9376000	9378000	You get to have that happening.
9378000	9379000	Yeah.
9379000	9384000	So what has been most different about listening live?
9384000	9386000	Just having the chatters or?
9386000	9392000	Well, the fact that I was listening live and then you picked up right away and I was confused what was going on.
9392000	9394000	It's a little weird at first.
9394000	9395000	That's how it works.
9395000	9396000	That's how it works.
9396000	9397000	There's not a big delay, but it's there.
9397000	9399000	Well, what are you doing in gaming these days?
9399000	9403000	What kind of video games do you play?
9403000	9405000	I typically am a...
9405000	9408000	I've been switching from console gaming to PC gaming.
9408000	9409000	It's...
9409000	9416000	I don't know why I'll even buy, like, when we have a big Steam sale, I'll buy a lot of Steam games and then...
9416000	9420000	Even if I've already played them and beat them on Xbox, I don't know what I've been doing.
9420000	9424000	I was just going to say, Steam probably made you a PC gamer.
9424000	9425000	Yeah.
9425000	9427000	And a lot of the deals that you get on Steam.
9427000	9429000	So, did you get suckered in this last holiday sale?
9429000	9430000	Oh, God, yeah.
9430000	9432000	Well, what'd you get?
9432000	9440000	Well, I got both the Hummel THQ bundle, the Hummel Indie bundle, and then, like, ten other games on Steam.
9440000	9441000	Oh, boy.
9441000	9442000	Haven't even played most of them.
9442000	9444000	You're a PC gamer now.
9444000	9447000	Those consoles will be collecting dust.
9447000	9449000	But, you know, this is a big year.
9449000	9456000	We might have a new Xbox out this year, so do you think the consoles might bring you back if we get, you know, a fancy new Xbox or what have you?
9456000	9460000	Oh, of course, because I'm not spending that much money to upgrade my PC again.
9460000	9464000	But you dropped $400 on the new Xbox?
9464000	9465000	Of course.
9465000	9467000	Nice.
9467000	9472000	So, what kind of console games do you play?
9472000	9474000	Pretty much anything.
9474000	9477000	I nerded out for, like, two weeks on Far Cry 3.
9477000	9479000	That's been getting a lot of good feedback.
9479000	9480000	Love it.
9480000	9482000	What is it about Far Cry 3 you enjoy?
9482000	9484000	I think, Loki, you're a fan of Far Cry as well, right?
9484000	9485000	I got bored of it.
9485000	9486000	You got bored of it?
9486000	9487000	Yeah.
9487000	9488000	Oh.
9488000	9489000	Let me go back.
9489000	9491000	What was Loki doing wrong?
9491000	9495000	You weren't placing mines in front of boars and making them run towards you.
9495000	9497000	I was not doing that.
9497000	9499000	I should be doing that.
9499000	9501000	Maybe next time.
9502000	9503000	Yeah.
9503000	9505000	Or killing tigers with bow and arrow.
9505000	9508000	That was the worst, worst mission ever.
9508000	9512000	What game are you most looking forward to in 2013?
9512000	9516000	Probably Bioshock Infinite.
9516000	9517000	Oh, yes.
9517000	9518000	Oh, yes.
9518000	9522000	A lot of people waiting for that proper sequel, quote unquote, to Bioshock.
9522000	9523000	Very soon now, right?
9523000	9524000	Is that March?
9524000	9525000	Coming out March?
9525000	9528000	Like, Bioshock Infinite and Tomb Raider.
9528000	9529000	Back to back, aren't they?
9529000	9530000	Yeah.
9530000	9531000	Yeah.
9531000	9533000	It's going to be an exciting year for games, that's for sure.
9533000	9534000	All right.
9534000	9536000	Push it back again.
9536000	9540000	Well, Stealthpoke, anything else on your mind tonight before I let you go, buddy?
9540000	9541000	Nope.
9541000	9542000	Just don't bother calling.
9542000	9543000	All right.
9543000	9544000	Well, you made it.
9544000	9545000	Tell all your friends.
9545000	9546000	All right.
9546000	9547000	All right.
9547000	9548000	Take care, buddy.
9548000	9549000	Thanks.
9549000	9550000	All right.
9550000	9551000	Thanks for the video call as well.
9551000	9552000	You're a good listener.
9552000	9553000	We like the video calls.
9553000	9554000	Take care, buddy.
9554000	9555000	You too.
9555000	9556000	Bye.
9556000	9557000	Excellent job by Stealthpoke.
9557000	9558000	Great first call.
9558000	9559000	All right.
9559000	9560000	All right.
9560000	9561000	Thank you so much for joining tonight.
9561000	9562000	I'm very sorry to those of you that didn't get through.
9562000	9563000	But consider sending an email with your thoughts.
9563000	9565000	Mailbag at orangelandrado.com.
9565000	9567000	Or send us a tweet in the future.
9567000	9569000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
9569000	9572000	And I think with that, we're going to start to wrap up the show.
9572000	9574000	I know it's not as long of a show as last week.
9574000	9575000	But come on, guys.
9575000	9576000	Last week's show was practically a marathon.
9576000	9582000	Did you know, actually, last week's was the biggest MP3 I've ever put to the server?
9582000	9585000	Because the marathon show, the proper one a couple years ago, was split up into three
9585000	9586000	parts.
9586000	9590000	So last week's show was the longest show we've had outside of that marathon.
9590000	9592000	So food for thought.
9592000	9593000	So it's a little short.
9593000	9595000	It's a little under three hours this week.
9595000	9596000	But that's all right.
9596000	9597000	There was a little less gaming news as well.
9597000	9602000	It's kind of still a slow week because people take the rest of this week off for the holidays
9602000	9605000	sometimes, too, because the kids are still off from school or what have you.
9605000	9610000	So I think things will be back in a full swing next week as we ramp up towards the big release
9610000	9613000	of games such as BioShock Infinite, as our last caller mentioned there.
9613000	9615000	Or Devil May Cry in a couple weeks.
9615000	9616000	Devil May Cry coming out very soon.
9616000	9617000	I know Tomb Raider.
9617000	9620000	We got big news over the holiday about multiplayer and Tomb Raider.
9620000	9622000	A lot of the internet was raging against that.
9622000	9627000	I'm not sure I get it because multiplayer only made Mass Effect 3 better.
9627000	9628000	But we'll see.
9628000	9629000	We'll see.
9629000	9631000	We'll see when the game comes out.
9631000	9635000	So be sure to send us an email and let us know what you think of the upcoming games
9635000	9636000	and what you're looking forward to.
9636000	9640000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
9640000	9643000	And before I go around and get everybody's final thoughts, you know, we always say it
9643000	9644000	here on the show.
9644000	9645000	We really mean it.
9645000	9647000	You know, we don't ask for your money to do this program.
9647000	9649000	You can send it to me.
9649000	9650000	Well, we don't try to.
9650000	9652000	But you could donate it to Vogue.
9652000	9654000	We don't try to sell you anything or what have you.
9654000	9657000	All we ask, if you enjoy the show, help us spread the word.
9657000	9659000	Bring more people into our family.
9659000	9662000	Get more people like Stealth Pope to listen live.
9662000	9666000	You can always tell a friend about the show on social media.
9666000	9668000	Facebook and Google Plus and so forth.
9668000	9670000	Leave us a nice review on iTunes.
9670000	9671000	That always helps as well.
9672000	9675000	Thumbs up in Stitcher and listening to us in Stitcher and giving good feedback there
9675000	9677000	helps our ranking there.
9677000	9679000	All of it really goes a long way.
9679000	9681000	Please help us spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.
9681000	9683000	We really, truly appreciate it.
9683000	9684000	All right.
9684000	9687000	Now is the time where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9687000	9688000	I'll start tonight.
9688000	9693000	My final thought is, Jamie, you are an evil, evil, evil woman for bringing that peppermint bark into the house.
9693000	9694000	It was so delicious.
9694000	9695000	You're welcome.
9695000	9696000	All right.
9696000	9697000	Dark Sakura, your final thought.
9697000	9698000	I don't have one.
9698000	9700000	Oh, an apathetic final thought tonight.
9700000	9701000	That's all right.
9701000	9702000	Reject false icons.
9702000	9704000	I'll do that for her.
9704000	9706000	Loki, your final thought tonight.
9706000	9709000	Skyrim is going to be really goofy once I get playing it.
9709000	9712000	I've got a lot of weird mods I'm going to put on this thing.
9712000	9713000	All right.
9713000	9715000	You'll have to post some lolsy pictures up on the chat.
9715000	9717000	VoG Minecraft is still going, yes?
9717000	9720000	Yeah, VoG Minecraft is going, although I haven't played it all this week.
9720000	9722000	Probably going to go back at some point.
9722000	9725000	Time splitting between 40 different things.
9725000	9729000	And by the way, check your Twitters because there's a podcast inviting you on.
9729000	9730000	I saw on the Twitters.
9730000	9733000	I actually have a question for you about the server.
9733000	9736000	How do you put up a sign that shows where your area is?
9736000	9739000	Oh, it's a command you have to do.
9739000	9743000	I don't know if everyone has permissions to do the dynamap stuff, but I can do that.
9743000	9751000	Well, if you found my little burrow in the ground, then it's near the big sign in the center of the map.
9751000	9754000	I'll add permissions if I haven't done that already.
9754000	9755000	All right.
9755000	9756000	Sounds good.
9756000	9758000	Well, thank you again for downloading and listening to our show.
9758000	9760000	We really appreciate it.
9760000	9761000	Have a great week, guys.
9761000	9764000	Next week, we will be back to do it all again live.
9764000	9767000	Jason is going to be joining us along with Ryan.
9767000	9769000	They're going to be back next week.
9769000	9771000	I think Jason was here a couple months ago.
9771000	9773000	Ryan was here for the 10th anniversary show.
9773000	9774000	They will be back.
9774000	9775000	We'll catch up with them.
