Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, January 6th, 2013. Could Sony be planning to block used games on the next PlayStation?

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
New hacking progress is made on the 3DS. And could being an MMO player make you a better employee?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
The 1st of 2013 of Orange Lounge Radio. The show where every gamer has a voice.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
We are here live at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
Where we do tape live every Sunday night. 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining you over the next few hours. Joining you.

00:57.000 --> 01:06.000
Slow down Rob. I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and gamer fun with my co-hosts.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
And gamers suck maybe. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Gamer cock.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Gamer cock?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
No.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
I don't know what kind of show you're co-hosting.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Well, one that involves 3D. No.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
But I bet it has a lot of subscribers.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Also joining us, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Hello.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Techmaster Loki?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
I'm doing fine.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Alright. Good times. So here we are. 1st show. 2013.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
I hope you all had a safe New Year. Obviously you must have because you're here listening to the show tonight.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Be it in its live form or in its podcast form.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
There was a lot of crazy shit that went down on New Years.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
I know especially in this neighborhood. Well not like this very neighborhood but in SAC.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
I think this was all over the international news or something.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
They had those shootings in Old Town and what a bunch of fuckery.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
Like leave your guns at home on New Years. Seriously. Why do people feel the need?

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Like I know there's second amendments blah blah blah. I don't want to get into the gun debate.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
But why do people feel the need to fire their guns on December 31st?

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Some of them was shot at at McDonalds around the corner from my house like a couple days ago.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Stop shooting people.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
If I was at McDonalds I'd shoot myself too.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Too soon?

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Loki, how was your McDonalds that you brought to the show tonight?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
It was delicious.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
Also the New Years always means that Consumer Electronics Show right around the corner.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
So CES is starting this week.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Not usually a lot of video game news out of CES.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
You get some things once in a while.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Like I remember Game Room on the Xbox 360.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
That was a Consumer Electronics Show announcement a couple years ago.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
But now that we see that video game devices are becoming more and more prevalent.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Like these entertainment boxes that are in the living rooms.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
You might expect to see a little more about the other stuff that consoles do at Consumer Electronics Show.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
I don't really know what that is.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
But it might be very interesting to keep an eye on it.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
Even with Microsoft's reduced presence and Sony and so forth.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
It would be interesting to see what kind of direction they're going in as a company.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Might be dropping some hints about the next gaming systems.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Loki, any thoughts?

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Do you think we could get any major gaming news at a Consumer Electronics Show?

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
I know they're supposed to be doing the stuff for Disney Infinity this week.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
So there should be an announcement of that.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Because it's tech sort of.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Okay, because Skylanders technically is not just the game.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
It's all those little figurines too.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
So they have probably that.

03:29.000 --> 03:41.000
Maybe you might see something in regards to the whole streaming IPTV stuff that Microsoft's planning on rolling out.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
Because that seems a little bit more par for CES.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
Obviously some stuff new, maybe Android tablets, that kind of thing.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
That's pretty much it.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
I mean, I can't really think of anything really, really big that would be announced.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
Wasn't Sony working on some type of network like that too?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
I don't care.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
They probably all are, honestly.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
Have you played around a lot with the TV thing on the Nintendo Wii?

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Oh, you don't have a Wii U.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Yes, I totally have.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Have you read about it?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
I watch TV all the time.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
No, you know what I mean.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Like the little service, the TV thing on the Wii U.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
How much have you read about that?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Because it's pretty interesting.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
And it makes me think of the whole consumer devices and stuff.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
If I remember correctly, it's basically sort of like what I have with my box seats.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Okay, I want to watch The Office.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
And then it's like, okay, you can watch Office on Hulu, you can watch it on Netflix,

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
you can download episodes from Vudu or something like that.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
Or it's live on Channel 3 right now and press this button to flip your TV to check.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
Because not only did you spend $350 on a Wii U, but it's a brand new universal remote.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
I don't know if you knew that, but it also does those functions with all the infrared and such.

04:59.000 --> 05:06.000
So yeah, the boxy box that I have, which is very obsolete now.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
I actually went to Walmart the other day to get some things in.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
First thing I did, of course, is check to see how many Wii U's are sitting there.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
And there were eight.

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
So, you know, kind of going back to that, they're not flying off shelves

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
because they're sitting on shelves.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
But I noticed they have a new boxy box, which I'd never fucking buy that.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
And I recommend anybody that's thinking about a streaming box, do not buy the fucking boxy.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
It is fucking terrible.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
Although right now it works alright for Netflix and I like the remote.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
And you can stream porn on it pretty easily because they have porn apps that people have made for it.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
So it's fantastic for that.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Well, thank God.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Hey, it's got to have some good features to it.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Even this weird, like, I don't know what nationality is.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
It comes in HD and it's like, it's like Skinamax all the time.

06:00.000 --> 06:07.000
It has that look of like possibly porn channel and there is some nudity there, but they never really.

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
It's kind of like, OK, we're watching hot women in skimpy clothes playing darts.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
It doesn't make any sense.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Dead or alive beach volleyball.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
No, it's just weird.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.000
But we like to look at that every now and then and go, OK, what non-sex things are they doing on this channel?

06:23.000 --> 06:32.000
Anyways, but yeah, so mainly for Netflix, although it's slow and I'm sure there's other things out there.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Although I hear the Ouya works.

06:34.000 --> 06:41.000
In fact, there's actually been a lot of videos showing the Ouya and stuff and using different Android applications on there.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
They showed OnLive and how that works out and it works out pretty good.

06:45.000 --> 06:51.000
And also, I forget the program, but it's basically Xbox Media Center.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
It's called something else on Android, but that works pretty well.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
So you may be able to use that as a streamer as well.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
I'm kind of looking forward to that.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
But yeah, I haven't really messed around too much with the TV app, but I mean, it looks all right.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I mean, they better work well.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I mean, that's one of the things they're pimping out on it.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
I want to introduce the ever present fourth guest on our show, the live chatters.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
Hello to all you guys chatting along live with our show.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
Live.vognetwork.com is the place where you can join the chat room and you can also check into the show live and so forth.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
But if you are listening on the podcast feed, there'll be a hidden word somewhere within the show.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
You can put that in at vognetwork.com and get your points later on in the week.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
Because we want our live and our podcast folks to both be able to participate as much as possible.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
But we love the instant gratification of live.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
And we're talking a little bit about TV in the chat room right now.

07:41.000 --> 07:48.000
One of the other parts of TV that I didn't bring up with you, Loki, is that when you watch the sports games and so forth,

07:48.000 --> 07:55.000
you actually get the little play-by-play on the second screen and you can do the whole Miiverse liking and commenting.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Like so-and-so shot a three-point shot from down the court or whatever.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
You can actually kind of participate with that.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
Well, Tigerclaw in chat is telling me about, I guess they did something similar for Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
They were posting little screenshots and people were actually commenting.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
And I was saying, Dick Clark's New Year's Eve, I understand it's the first year.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
It was the Dickless Dick Clark's Rockin' New Year's Eve, unfortunately. I'm sorry to say.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Who hosts it now? Ryan Seacrest?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
The Ryan Seacrest Rockin' New Year's Eve.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
So we changed one dick for another.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
It was the Dickless Dick Clark New Year's Rockin' Eve, rest in peace.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
But I was saying it's really too bad they didn't do it for the Anderson Cooper, Kathy Griffin coverage.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
Which always gives America a lot more to talk about the next day.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
I love them.

08:46.000 --> 08:54.000
Anyhow, let's see. Jason in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, didn't OnLive die?

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
Well, yeah, the company got bought by another company, but the service is still going.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
It's not dead, it's just another company.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Under new management.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
Yeah, pretty much. It's just that everyone likes to hype that crap up.

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
Oh, it's dead. No, it's still going. People don't focus on it right now.

09:14.000 --> 09:21.000
But hey, it works. That's cool. And that's console games on your Ouya.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
The more I hear about the Ouya, I am interested in it.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
I did not back the Kickstarter because I was a little bit skeptical.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Some Kickstarters have not gone so well.

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
But if the Ouya continues to deliver the way people are saying it, it sounds like it would be worth checking out.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Well, hopefully I'll have mine in March.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
Hopefully. Maybe. Possibly.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Probably. And at least I know I have one game.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
Because I backed evil out, so whenever that comes out.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
I might get the Shadowgate game on that. I don't remember.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
I backed Shadowgate and I know I get it at least on the consoles.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
But I can't remember if they said they were doing an Ouya one or not. I don't remember.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Anyway. Let's see. What else do I want to talk about?

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
Speaking of March, something I was looking at before the show was a calendar.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Tonight is the 489th episode of our show.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
So assuming we don't miss any more episodes.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Because we took a week for the holidays off.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
But assuming we do all our shows between now and episode 500.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
That means episode 500 is March 31st of this year.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
The night before April Fool's Day.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Good lord.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
How appropriate for our big milestone.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
We have no idea what we're doing for our 500th episode.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
We have no idea. I mean we always talk about.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
You know. We've been doing this ever since our show turned one year old.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
Should we do a big celebration this year? Should we do something for five years?

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Should we do something for ten years?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
We never. It just ends up being another show.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
So we'll see. If you guys have big ideas. What should we do to celebrate episode 500?

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
How should we. Keep in mind.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
We're on a budget. This show has been done very low cost for a long time.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
The budget is no budget.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
That's right. You better be willing to back a Kickstarter if you start to go crazy.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
We do accept BevMo gift cards.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
At least I do.

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
We can build a fort out of. Actually that would be an appropriate way to celebrate episode 500.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
We need to find a fort to broadcast from. I think that would be.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
We could build a blanket fort.

11:16.000 --> 11:22.000
Or as the certain individual that we saw a couple of days ago. We could just climb under a table.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Why don't you talk about that real quick? Because it is podcast related.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Yes it is.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
And you guessed it on another podcast.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
I did. Roundaboutly.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
About a hundred times the subscribers. A thousand times the subscribers this show does.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
But tell the story quickly about the podcast that you quote unquote guessed it on this week.

11:37.000 --> 11:43.000
Well Rob and Alan were awesome and got me a ticket to go to the Smartest Man in the World podcast.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
Which is the one that Greg Proops of Whose Line Is It fame is on.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
You know he was also Mr. Conductor.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Whose line is it anyway?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Whatever.

11:51.000 --> 11:58.000
He was also a voice in that black and white game with the hacking and slashing on the Wii with the commentary.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Mad World.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Mad World. Thank you.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
But he was also Mr. Conductor on both the UK and the American version of Thomas the Tank Engine.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
He was also a commentator in the Pod Race segment of.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
That's right. He also hosted.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
He does a lot of commenting.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
He hosted the show Versus on Comedy Central.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
You know I think they should really have him commentate more on fictional things.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
That would be awesome.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Anyhow, Greg Proops is just.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Wouldn't that just be comment?

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Awesome.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Can he like commentate on our show?

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Wouldn't that just be comment?

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
No.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
Because comment suggests singular.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Are you saying episode 500 should come with a commentary track?

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
I think it should.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Hold on.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
All right.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Anyhow.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
What do you mean hold on?

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
You were in the middle of the story.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
I'm saying if commentate is an actual word.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
All right stop it.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Okay it actually is.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
But it means specifically for the purpose of an user sports broadcast.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
So Greg Proops is awesome.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
Well he came out first and shook everybody's hands.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
And by then I was already into my second drink.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
And.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Yeah classy guy.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Before the thing even starts podcasting.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
You know he walks out into the audience and shakes everybody's hand.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
And like.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
He's really cool.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
I was just like.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
I actually met him once like 10 years ago.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
I don't expect him to remember me.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
So I you know I just kind of shook his hand.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
I'm like hi there. Nice to meet you.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
And he put you know.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Hi I'm Greg.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
He was just very very kind.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Yeah.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
Well I actually managed to get up there during the question segment after the long boring preachy part.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
Which is actually my favorite part of his podcast ever because.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
I think there's like very little he says that I don't agree with philosophically.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
If you think this show is political too much you may not actually want to download Smartest Man in the World.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Oh download it anyway you learn something.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
He does do his boring preachy part.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
He knows more about baseball.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
Than anyone I know especially the old Negro leagues.

13:44.000 --> 13:51.000
I have learned because I actually was into some of that myself because Hank Aaron's from my hometown.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
And you know I knew about Satchel Paige and loved.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
All right quickly finish the damn story.

13:56.000 --> 14:08.000
So anyway I get up there and ask him my question comparing modern day political action to the French Revolution and Russian overthrow when they overthrew the stars.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
But he was he was fixated on your name at first.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Yes he was fixated on my name.

14:12.000 --> 14:18.000
He said he couldn't hear my name at first so I said Jamie like the bionic woman except without superpowers.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
And then he starts serenading me to Van Halen.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
And I'm just sitting there going wow.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
And then he.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
He wrote you a letter.

14:31.000 --> 14:41.000
He said something about like like if he said I don't remember what exactly he said but like you could write me a letter and I was like well I'd give someone else's right arm if you wrote me one.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
And he laughed and started writing me letters like I'm doing it right now.

14:45.000 --> 14:55.000
So he said ask your question and I asked my question and he had a discussion and it was really cool. You know it was almost pretty much what I expected him to say but I like having it out there.

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
And then he gave me a piece of paper that says thank you for being cool.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
And he spelled my name right even though I told him it was like the bionic woman. Nice.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
And I'll find the picture and link it to everybody.

15:07.000 --> 15:13.000
Black Wolf in our chat room says so if I sing Van Halen to Jamie taking notes.

15:13.000 --> 15:27.000
It's honestly not one of my favorite Van Halen songs but you know, anyhow, the podcast is not posted yet, but it is the smartest man in the world podcast it's on iTunes and all that, and you're just going to want to look for the episode that was taped

15:27.000 --> 15:36.000
on the Sacramento punch line, which I think should be posted probably this Friday or next Friday he's a couple weeks behind production versus what's posted.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
So we'll let you know well he was very much like Bobby.

15:40.000 --> 15:47.000
Good job. Good thing I found on my Tumblr, it's gotten better though.

15:47.000 --> 15:55.000
My Tumblr for people who don't know is kurotsubasa.tumblr.com. That's my main one is kurotsubasa. I'm not gonna spell the whole thing.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
But if you look on my 1313 post pictures of...

15:59.000 --> 16:05.000
Why don't you just ask Rama to retumble it on the... Can't you hit that button and it retumbles it?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I guess he could do it.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
How can you do that on the Orange Lawns Radio account?

16:09.000 --> 16:19.000
Yeah, well, the pictures are there, it's really cool, and also someone randomly friended me on Tumblr because she was there too.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Awesome. The internet, making the world a smaller place.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
And then we found out that there's yet another friend of mine that you know from Rocky.

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
Yes. It's a small Sacramento after all.

16:30.000 --> 16:39.000
Alright, anyhow. Let's get back to video games. So we wanted to plug Greg Proofs because he's the world's oldest hipster as I heard somebody say.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
Actually you heard that from me because it was from a discussion that Becky and I had at work.

16:43.000 --> 16:53.000
Amazing. Alright, let's get back to video games and talk about the games that we have been playing this week in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week? Dark Sakura, yet again, why don't you start us off?

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
I played some shit.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Did you play Mass Effect?

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
Yeah, and I started another game on two while I'm still playing three, so whatever.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Did you play something besides Mass Effect?

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Yes!

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Oh my god!

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Jeez, Rob.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Hold my heart.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
My ears are still ringing from that exclamation.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Call the paramedics!

17:11.000 --> 17:32.000
Anyway, I downloaded a cute little RPG called To The Moon, and it's actually really a sweet story so far, but you go into the past through this guy's memories to give him the drive in his memories that would send him to the moon, because that was his wish.

17:32.000 --> 17:42.000
You basically grant dying people a wish inside their mind. And it's not that you're changing their thoughts or anything, but you're giving them a drive towards a singular goal in their life.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
And so their memories will be altered as a result of it right before they die.

17:46.000 --> 17:56.000
And it's really cool so far. It doesn't have any combat except when you start fighting a squirrel when you're roleplaying. It was cute.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
And they're like, why are you attacking the squirrel?

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
Well, we were roleplaying. Stop being mean to the squirrel!

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
And the squirrel runs off.

18:03.000 --> 18:12.000
So anyway, I played that. I started on Limbo, which that game pisses me off already.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
It's very pretty, but difficult.

18:15.000 --> 18:22.000
And I started on Assassin's Creed 2, but I'm not really getting into it so much.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
I spent a lot of money on it, so I don't care.

18:25.000 --> 18:32.000
And I played WoW. I actually did play some WoW. Nothing happened. It was boring.

18:32.000 --> 18:40.000
I played something else, and I can't remember what it was. And it wasn't very Solitaire.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
You already talked about To the Moon.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Yeah. Limbo.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
Did you play that Giana Sisters game?

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
No, I haven't played it. Not this week.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
There was another game that I started.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Is there any Walking Dead? I thought you said you were talking about that.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
No, I bought it, but I didn't start it yet.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
But the entire thing went on a Steam sale the last day of the sale.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
So it was like six bucks, something like that.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Those Steam sales are pretty evil.

19:06.000 --> 19:13.000
In fact, I sat down before the show started, and I was like, Loki, tell me why I should not buy Dark Souls right now for 20 bucks.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
The Prepare to Die Dark Souls edition is 20 bucks right now.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
And he's like, just get it on PlayStation 3. You can probably get it cheaper.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
Sure enough, I look up on Amazon. It's a whole dollar cheaper on Amazon right now.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Yes.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Or I could just rent it.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Yeah, but then...

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
I could have it right this second through Steam.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
How much would your shipping be on Amazon?

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Free, because I have Prime.

19:34.000 --> 19:42.000
Which, well, it's free in quotes. Technically, I paid for that, but I've already paid for it.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
So whatever.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
I can't remember, so whatever.

19:46.000 --> 19:51.000
You got an awe from DDR Dollar Bill, because he's really into Assassin's Creed 2.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
I have Assassin's Creed 3.

19:53.000 --> 20:02.000
I realize a lot of you guys are very disappointed in it, but I saw one of Alan's relatives playing it on Christmas when we were over there.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
And the multiplayer looked really interesting to me.

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
It's kind of like you try to blend into this crowd that's walking around.

20:09.000 --> 20:15.000
You're trying to stealthy kill people, but it's like kill or be killed, so you try to blend into the crowd so you don't get noticed.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
It's very cat and mouse, is what I heard it called.

20:17.000 --> 20:23.000
The only reason I wanted to play Assassin's Creed 2 is because it's set in Renaissance Italy.

20:23.000 --> 20:29.000
Which I still find it completely hilarious that the Renaissance started in Italy, but it has a French name, but anyway.

20:29.000 --> 20:35.000
Because I studied a lot of the architecture, and I want to kill some Dometicis.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
I really want to just punch some Dometicis in the face and stab them in the head.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Damn those Dometicis. Too many popes.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Too many Dometicis. Too many popes.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
Well, a very good Gaming Week segment. It was that moment.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
I played stuff.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
That moment when Dark Sakura told me she played something other than Mass Effect.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
And I was all like...

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
Ah ha ha ha ha. You lost your zing.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
You just need to have that as a sound clip.

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
Instead of this weird bitch talking to this disgusting looking heart.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
Actually, now I'm more interested in the commercial than I was my original joke.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
He's making out with her laptop.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
That's scary. Anyhow.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Rewind, take two.

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
That moment when Dark Sakura told me she played something other than Mass Effect this week, and I was all...

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
What?

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
Snake!

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Loki, how was your Gaming Week?

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
It was okay. I didn't play a whole ton of stuff.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
It was mainly just...

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
I don't know. Just kind of going through a few different games.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
I think I played... Well, I definitely played some Final Fantasy XI.

21:50.000 --> 21:59.000
Once again though, kind of going back to what I said last week is that it's definitely a lot more sparsely populated now.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
So...

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
Like, I haven't really tried looking for a party, but there's no parties to be found.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
I mean, I went to the...

22:08.000 --> 22:17.000
I've been having to solo myself the entire way as a white mage, because I decided to pick a white mage to level first.

22:17.000 --> 22:25.000
Because I figured out, hey, I'll get in the parties, and it'll be a good sub for a black mage.

22:25.000 --> 22:34.000
And the problem is, I have to solo everything, and so I'm actually up to level 22?

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
But I'm like soloing myself in the dunes.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
Soloing in the dunes. Never thought I'd be doing that.

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
And it's just very slow.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Maybe you just need to roll on another server.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Maybe the server you're on is just not good.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
Like, I can't remember what server we rolled on, though.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
It was... Don't laugh.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
The fairy server is gone, but it got merged with another server.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
I want to say it was Garuda. Don't quote me on that. Maybe one of the chatters know.

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
But we rolled there, just to laugh and say we were on the former fairy server.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
But I don't remember what server it was.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Is Shane listening?

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Shane, where did we roll on Final Fantasy XI?

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
I need to know. This is very important stuff.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
I don't even know if it's gonna help, honestly.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
It's been very sparse.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
It is kind of funny, though.

23:22.000 --> 23:27.000
The item I got for buying the collector's edition or whatever is fucking awesome.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Oh, the hat?

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
The hat. It's fantastic.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
You get that sprint thing, which I'm not sure if that was just a Mog.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
They have these weird things now. It's like Mog enhancements or something,

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
where you get treasure chests and crap now, which is a little weird.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
And they have this thing where if I rested for a while,

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
I got this sprint ability where I basically run faster until I get attacked.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
So that was kind of neat.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
And then also, it has auto-rerace.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
So literally, you could just die, raise yourself back up again.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
You don't lose any experience, die again.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
And I was doing that for a while because I got attacked by a ghost.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
And I was like, oh, I could take care of this thing.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
And it didn't really work out that well.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
But yeah, so I've been playing that.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
And I don't know if I will continue playing it after my free trial,

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
because once again, it's just very lonely on that server.

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
And I just don't know, because I took for granted a lot of the stuff

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
that I had done before when I first played it,

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
like getting your airship pass, getting your sub-jobs,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
getting your advanced jobs.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
It's just, that's a lot of time when you're not in a party.

24:33.000 --> 24:40.000
Thanks to the wiki at finalfantasy11sclopedia.org, ffxiclopedia.org,

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
the Faerie server was merged into the Silph server.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
That's the server we played on, Silph.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Oh yeah, that makes sense. Okay.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
So yeah, I've been just playing that a little bit.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
I'll probably, I don't know, I think I'm just holding on to it now

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
because I'm hoping that it'll go free to play

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
and there'll be a lot more people, hopefully.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
So I'll just hold on to it for now.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
And whatever, you know what, so even if I get only a month out of it,

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
10 bucks for Final Fantasy XI again, for a month is, that's nothing.

25:09.000 --> 25:14.000
Just to have a flirt. Sometimes it's fun to flirt with an MMO you once loved.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Yeah, I mean, it's still fun.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Hooking up once again.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
I wish WoW was worth it.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Remembering the good times.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
So other stuff I played, I didn't really play a whole ton of Skyrim,

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
but I just kind of ran it to see if it'd run on my PC

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
because, you know, I hadn't actually run it yet,

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
even though I bought it last sale, the summer sale.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
And yeah, it runs.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
So now I'm downloading a ton of mods for it

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
thanks to the Steam Workshop.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
And I also purchased the first expansion for it.

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
I didn't purchase that Hearthfire one yet,

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
but maybe I should. I don't know.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
It's down to like $249, so maybe.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
We'll see.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
And then what else did I...

26:00.000 --> 26:05.000
Oh, I got Sinamori today, but I didn't play that yet.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
And then what else?

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
Borderlands 2, still playing some of that. Still lots of fun.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
I'm glad they kind of got back into that.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
And a little bit of Modern Warfare 3, still rocking that.

26:16.000 --> 26:21.000
And yeah, I think that's pretty much it right now

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
because, I don't know.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
I'm trying to go through and play some of these Steam games now

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
that I've gotten, because I've gotten a lot of stuff from sales

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
and the Humble Bundles and stuff, and I'm trying to go through and see,

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
okay, which ones do I want to install? Which ones am I going to play?

26:36.000 --> 26:41.000
I'm really psyched about getting, eventually, like a Steam,

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
like a PC for my TV, basically, that's really high-end

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
that'll have my Steam games on there and play big picture mode and stuff like that.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
That's kind of what I'm gearing towards.

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
Kind of think of it as like the bomb shelter for the future gaming generation

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
that all falls apart.

26:59.000 --> 27:04.000
I have a fallout shelter to go to to play some older games that are still good.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
My Gaming Week.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
I'm going to dedicate my gaming week to the fact that Dark Soccer is evil.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
What?

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
My gaming week, you're evil.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
All right, no, this is what it's really about.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
Last week, you know the classic game of the week that you do every week, right?

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
Yes.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Last week you talked about Gyruss, and I mentioned,

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
because somebody joked in chat, like, oh, they should make an HD version of that.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
And I'm like, they did, dude, like four years ago.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
And it's on Xbox Live Arcade.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
So this week I went and played Gyruss on Xbox Live Arcade.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
And then that got me on this kick of like,

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
look at all these old-ass games I bought like four years ago.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
I own over 100 arcade games on Xbox Live.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
So I just started playing a lot of random shit.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
I started playing like Pac-Man and just old stuff,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
trying to see if I could get any new achievements.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
And I'll tell you what, I did get a new achievement this week

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
on an old game I purchased many years ago, Geometry Wars 2,

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
which, by the way, is still an awesome frickin' game.

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
Like, if you are a more recent Xbox buyer,

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
go look on the Xbox Live Arcade and go get Geometry Wars 2,

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
which was like seriously one of the best twin-stick shooters I think they ever put out.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
The original Geometry Wars is great too,

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
but Geometry Wars 2 has all those different modes.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
But I'm trying to get this one achievement, Treaty,

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
like still to this day, driving me bonkers.

28:24.000 --> 28:29.000
In King mode, which is where you can only fire bullets from safe zones,

28:29.000 --> 28:34.000
you have to cross through 30 safe zones without firing a single bullet.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
I can't tell you how many times I got to 29.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
And I'm about ready to throw that controller at my TV.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
But I haven't got it yet.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
TigerClanChat asking, what achievement did you get?

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
I got the one that's called Rebound,

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
where you fire all the shots off the little bars

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
that usually you fly your ship through and break,

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
but you can also fire bullets off of it, reflect it,

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
and you kill like 75 enemies by doing that and you get an achievement.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
That's the one I got.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
And AlphaCananagram agrees, Geometry Wars 2 is amazing.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Yes it is. Very much is.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
So, thank you DarkSakura for the amazing week in Retronis.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
I even played Game Room a little bit last week.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
I was playing like Atari 2600 stuff too. Crazy, right?

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
Let's see. In newer fangled games,

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft this week

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
because there's been a lot going on.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
I'll get into that more on Horde House this week.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
But I did hit my second max level character.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
I now have a level 90 priest, was my first one,

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
and now I have a level 90 monk, is my second one.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
The new class, which is great.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
So, yay!

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
Otherwise, not a whole lot else.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Forza Horizon, some other stuff,

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
but nothing else to really talk in depth about.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Maybe next week.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
Going to RawsteelUT.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
Yeah, too bad Bazaar got fried by Blur.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Was it Blur or was it the 007 game they made?

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
It was probably both, unfortunately.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
It really sucks that they got the plug pulled on them

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
because Blur was not as bad as everybody made it out to be.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
The 007 game is Activision's own damn fault.

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
They put a 007 game out before Modern Warfare 3.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
I think it was Modern Warfare 3.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
No, Modern Warfare 3 was Goldeneye 007.

30:09.000 --> 30:15.000
So, it was Black Ops before Black Ops.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
Come on, you really think that they know better

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
that it's going to just eat?

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
No one gives a shit about that

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
when Black Ops is coming up next week.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
Let's see, Black Wolf in chat says,

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
in new games I played World of Warcraft.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
Okay, World of Warcraft Mists of Pandaria.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Excuse me.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
Black Wolf also says, fuck Game Room.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Well, not so much fuck Game Room,

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
but fuck Microsoft for closing Chrome Studios and ending Game Room.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
And fuck Game Room for not being as good as it should have been.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
And fuck the fact that we could have had this awesome retro...

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
I'm not going to...

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
And fuck the fucking fuckers.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Yeah, what she said.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
All right, let's talk a little bit of housekeeping

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
and then we can get into the news tonight.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
And housekeeping, of course, join us on Twitter.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
And you can also join us on Facebook.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
I also want to give a nice plug to this other show,

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
as I tend to do when other shows are kind enough to invite me on their show.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
This show is called the Down for Maintenance podcast.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Excuse me.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
It's a newer show.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
You'll have to excuse me.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
I don't remember if they have a full website.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
I know they are available on iTunes, so you just search for Down for Maintenance.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
And you can find the episode from January 5th that has me on it.

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
And they were very kind, very nice, asked me a lot of questions.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
And I got to talk not just about video games,

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
but they asked me a lot about how I got into podcasting.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
So, if you want to hear the full, long, very long, very long story,

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
check out Down for Maintenance podcast this week.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Also, we talked about Disneyland quite extensively.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
So, I like the fact that we just rambled on all these awesome topics.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
So, a good bunch there at Down for Maintenance podcast.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
And their Twittersies is the DFM podcast.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
So, you can follow them on the Twitters.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
And they give them a shout-out on my personal Twitter feed as well.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Check that out.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Did Tiger Claw find their website?

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Yes, that's the name of it. Down for Maintenance podcast.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
Sorry, I can only see part of that in the window behind me.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
It's on iTunes.

32:09.000 --> 32:14.000
And when I say it's on iTunes, that means whatever podcasty program you're using,

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
it's probably on there too.

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
So, those things all spider out on the internet and find them all.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Big thanks to them.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
If you have a podcast and you would like to have one of us on the show,

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
we love going on other podcasts.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
We love being guests and so forth.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
So, if you are interested, we like to think we're pretty accessible

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
on Twitters and Facebook and all that.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
But if for whatever reason you're like,

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
I don't know how to get a hold of you guys,

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want one of us to come on your show.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
And we will redirect your mail to the appropriate person

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
and we can work out schedules.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
But I don't know about you guys, but I love to go on other podcasts

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
and just talk about.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
I totally love it too. All those invites I get.

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
Okay, Loki. Loki's begging for invites, you guys.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
There you go. All right.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Let's get into some gaming news.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Loki, wow the internet with your knowledge

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
of what's going on in gaming right now.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Oh, please. I don't care, really.

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
Anyways, so, Microsoft has acquired R2 Studios.

33:09.000 --> 33:14.000
R2 Studios happens to be the people behind such devices

33:14.000 --> 33:19.000
that you would kind of see perfect for, like, smart glass.

33:19.000 --> 33:25.000
Basically, it's sort of like home automation

33:25.000 --> 33:29.000
and, you know, integrated into different devices

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
like tablets and phones and that kind of stuff.

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
So, the thought is that, hmm,

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
perhaps this is going to be rolled into some new things

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
that they're going to incorporate into, say, the next Xbox system.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
Or perhaps some of the stuff that we've seen

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
in some of their kind of, I don't know if you'd really call them tech demos,

33:49.000 --> 33:54.000
but like the view of the future, I guess,

33:54.000 --> 33:59.000
where they have the PCs integrated into walls

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
that are being projected upon and stuff like that,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
which I think that's actually pretty awesome.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
I'd really like to see that kind of technology,

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
but I don't know how expensive that would be.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
But they had something similar with that

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
where it's like kind of everything integrated into an interface

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
that looks good on your wall, I guess,

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
and it's a full wall interface type thing.

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
So, this seems to kind of give credit to that whole,

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
you know, we've heard the rumors before about the new Microsoft

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
is going to project shit all over your room.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Like, we've heard that before, right?

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Does this kind of lend itself to that?

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Well, I don't know if it's going to be the next system that's going to do that,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
but they're definitely looking at technology

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
to do something similar to that.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
And they've got, you know, something that has, you know,

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
where it projects stuff onto the walls.

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
I would imagine like some sort of ceiling mounted projector or something.

34:48.000 --> 34:53.000
That would still be really awesome, even just for like a PC or something.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
But I don't know how that would work.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
I haven't gotten to actually see it other than in the videos,

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
so I'm not really sure how they would implement that kind of stuff.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
But, yeah.

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
So, I mean, obviously, if these guys are, you know,

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
experts at like kind of home automation and entertainment,

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
then I would think that this kind of ties into all the rumors

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
that we've heard about, you know, the kind of direction they want to go with,

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
you know, the Xbox being this kind of center hub for entertainment

35:22.000 --> 35:26.000
and, you know, integrating it more into your life, if possible, I guess.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
Well, that's what these consoles want to be.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
They don't just want to be a gaming center.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
It wants to, well, it wants to be an entertainment center, I guess.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
We've already, I mean, that really shouldn't be a surprise at all.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
I mean, look at the systems you've got now.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
When the Xbox 360 first came out, it really didn't do a lot of that.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
I mean, a little bit, like, you know,

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
you used to be able to get like the trailers for movies.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
You could download those types of things.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
But now, like, it's really transformed into, you know,

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
it does Netflix, it does streaming, it does all this other stuff.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
And now it's just going to go a step further.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
You know, we see what TV does on the Nintendo Wii U.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
That's just, you know, a hint that that's just Nintendo's little,

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
we're on our own little universe, you know, and their way of doing it.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
Their own Miiverse?

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
Yes.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
Well, they did have like, you know, that's, I mean, granted,

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
it's a lot more complex now, but they used to have, well,

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
they still have it.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
It's just the Media Center integration was one of the first things

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
that they kind of put out there.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
But, I mean, that's all they really had at the time was,

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
okay, you have the Windows XP Media Center edition or whatever,

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
which I had on my laptop.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
My last laptop actually had that, which is kind of funny.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
And occasionally I'd hit the button to go into it and,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
oh, hey, that's right, this is on here.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
But, yeah, that worked all right.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
And so that's kind of like, you know,

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
they took it to the next level and then kept going.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
I just, I want to see the further evolution of this.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
I want to see what the next Xbox and the next PlayStation,

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
I want to see what they do that my PC can't.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
Yeah, I want to see something new.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
See, that's the thing is they need something brand new,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
like, oh, it projects crap onto your wall.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
That's something that you can't get with what it is, you know,

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
the technology that's out there right now.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
I mean, projectors.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
I just can't imagine that in my head.

37:06.000 --> 37:11.000
I live in a planetarium and it projects images on the wall.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
But maybe I'm not thinking about it right, you know?

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
Maybe in my mind I think, like, oh,

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
that means the image of the game is going to be all around.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
But maybe it's not really like that, you know?

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
I don't even know if that would work feasibly.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Because, I mean, if you look at it, I mean,

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
not everyone's going to have walls that that would show up on.

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
And they may not be playing in a room that's necessarily going to work.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
Well, but couldn't they, through the infrared technology,

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
be able to gauge the size of your room really quickly and adjust accordingly?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Maybe. I don't know.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
It would just be interesting to see how they would do something like that

37:43.000 --> 37:48.000
or how they would try to figure out other ways to immerse you.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
That's really what it is, is they're trying to find more ways to immerse you

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
into whatever it is that you're doing.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
As we say here on OLR quite frequently,

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
one step closer to the holodeck.

37:58.000 --> 38:03.000
Everything that happens in gaming takes us one step closer to the holodeck.

38:03.000 --> 38:08.000
Think about the progress we've made since the Atari 2600 and the Odyssey

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
and all those first generation gaming consoles.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
Hell, with the Atari 2600, the holodeck didn't even really exist.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
And then the next generation came out and everyone was like,

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
oh, hey, holodeck, that's cool.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
So, yeah, we've made a lot of progress.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
All right, well, one thing that won't be making any more progress

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
is sales of James Bond games on Steam.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
Folks noticed over this past week that games from the James Bond franchise

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
were taken down from Steam.

38:33.000 --> 38:38.000
And the early rumors had people going, oh, Activision is up to something.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Activision is pulling their games from Steam.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
Activision is going to start their own origin.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
No, no, it's just the licenses.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
The licensing that Activision held for these 007 games,

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
they ran out on the New Year, so that's why they were pulled down.

38:53.000 --> 38:59.000
So they originally got the license to do James Bond games in May 2006.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
So the license was supposed to last until 2014,

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
but for whatever reason it ended, I guess, a little sooner,

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
or maybe it had something to do with the digital distribution and so forth.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
Some of the games that were affected would have been, what, 007 Legends,

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
which was the most recent game, Bloodstone, and so forth.

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
Let's be real, none of these games were particularly memorable anyway,

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
so it's not like they're going to be missed.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
Sorry, not sorry, it's just the truth.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
There you go, they are no longer there.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
007 GoldenEye Reloaded was another one that Activision did.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
Remember when they tried to make Lightning Strike twice with GoldenEye

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
and it just didn't work out?

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
It wasn't bad either.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
I remember playing it at E3 and I was like, yep, it's GoldenEye,

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
it's just a little different.

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
I don't remember him being in here. Where's Pierce Brosnan?

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
What's going on here?

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
So there you go, you can no longer get the James Bond games on Steam,

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
and I don't think that means anything bigger than

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
whenever that next James Bond movie comes out,

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
and there will be another James Bond movie for sure.

40:02.000 --> 40:06.000
That franchise might have been in question before, but after Skyfall.

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
Isn't Skyfall now one of the largest grocery motion pictures ever?

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
It's like in the top 20?

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
Haven't seen it yet.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
It is good.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
I think I saw...

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
I hated the ending. I hated the ending.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
I saw Casino Royale, I think.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Casino Royale was good.

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
Most of that... Was there one between that and Skyfall?

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
There was, Quantum of Solace.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
I haven't seen that yet.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
Alan summed it up perfectly.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
He said that Skyfall was the sequel that Quantum of Solace should have been,

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
and I'd cosign that, because Casino Royale was supposed to be a reboot of sorts,

40:38.000 --> 40:43.000
and Skyfall brings in elements of the Bond franchise

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
that we haven't seen since the Sean Connery days.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
I won't spoil it for anybody, but just there's a lot of throwbacks

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
and little winks and nods.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
One thing I could say that's not a spoiler,

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
there's a very subtle reference, very subtle reference to

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
shaken but not stirred when he orders his drink.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
There's all these really...

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
And then there's some in-your-face references, too, and it's great.

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
And the Bond girl? Hot.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Actually, there's more than one Bond girl. They're all hot.

41:07.000 --> 41:11.000
But the one in particular I'm thinking of that he meets in Macau or wherever,

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
like Hong Kong or wherever he's at?

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Smokin' hot.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
Hot.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Hot Bond girl. Just sayin'.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
Way hotter than Denise Richards could ever dream of being. Sorry.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Better than Grace Jones.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
Grace Jones just fuckin'...

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
Grace Jones will just demand your attention.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
I love A View to a Kill. It's not a great movie,

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
but I love Grace Jones.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
That woman is awesome.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
It's one of those things that a lot of people don't really know about me,

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
but I really do like James Bond.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
James Bond movies are just awesome.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
I miss how cheesy they used to be.

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
The new ones are fine, though. The new ones are great in their own way.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
And they don't really interest me, to be honest.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
Yeah.

41:55.000 --> 41:59.000
Because, I mean, I like a little more...

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
A little less action, a little more suspense.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
If you want a cheesy Bond, you need to go see Live and Let Die.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
That one's great.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
I've seen Live and Let Die. It's the one that had Paul McCartney doing the opening.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Yeah, I've seen Live and Let Die.

42:12.000 --> 42:16.000
That one's hilarious, the way the evil villain dies at the end.

42:16.000 --> 42:20.000
So when are we going to get a sequel to If Looks Could Kill?

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
That was awesome.

42:26.000 --> 42:31.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
use the passphrase, glue.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
All right, anyhow, after Bond, more gaming news.

42:36.000 --> 42:40.000
Dark Sakura, our very own Bond girl, here on the show.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
As if.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
Sorry, I'm not about to run up on the beach in a white bikini with a knife.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
She'll just run with a knife.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
I'll just run with a knife.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
I'll have, like, a really damp muumuu.

42:53.000 --> 43:03.000
Anyway, there is a theory speculated that people can use the Wii U console to have extra games for free.

43:03.000 --> 43:08.000
Basically what they're saying is that multiple players can make a separate user account on the Wii U

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
and buy games to the Nintendo eShop. They're linked just to the console.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
And everyone who is on that console will be able to play them.

43:15.000 --> 43:22.000
So the theory goes that you should be able to get an old one, a used Wii U,

43:22.000 --> 43:27.000
and use all the games that have been downloaded on it for the users that are on there.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
So that could be, I mean, it'd be kind of a hit and miss.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
Oh, I'm going to get this used Wii U because all these games are going to be on it.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
No, we didn't buy a damn thing.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
You know, but there's a possibility.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
Well, it's one way to make your Wii U look more attractive on eBay.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
True. I have all these games. Buy it.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Whatever. Added bonus. Cool.

43:46.000 --> 43:50.000
I didn't even think about that, but I just, when I heard about this, I was like,

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
Nintendo somehow did not anticipate the used market.

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
What's going to happen, can you, like, migrate your account from, like, one Wii U to,

43:58.000 --> 44:02.000
like, say, for example, if, like, a bunch of people migrated their account to one Wii U,

44:02.000 --> 44:07.000
and then, like, somehow, could you get, like, games from multiple accounts onto one system?

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
I don't know if you couldn't do it without Nintendo's involvement.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
Like, that's how you did it on the original Wii.

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
If you had to, like, change, you know, the content and all that.

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
Like, I think it's something Nintendo had to do after a Nintendo repair.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
I don't think it's something the user could easily do.

44:23.000 --> 44:28.000
Unlike the 3DS, which is a little, but in the 3DS world, there's that very real possibility.

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
You have people that own the regular 3DSs that want to buy the 3DS XL.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
They have to have something to transfer.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
Just like they have to have something to transfer Wii to Wii U.

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
But what's the reality that somebody's going to buy a second Wii U?

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
At this point, not bloody likely.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
So, I don't know.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
I don't even have a first one.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
But I didn't even think about that. You're right.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
When I sell my console on eBay, now I can say, loaded with all these great games.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
But you've got to wonder if it's not something Nintendo is going to patch out.

44:56.000 --> 45:02.000
Maybe they didn't have it in place this early because they didn't think people would be selling their Wii U's this fast.

45:02.000 --> 45:07.000
And by the way, I wouldn't read too much into that fact that Wii U's are already on the second-hand market.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
I saw a friend on Facebook say,

45:09.000 --> 45:14.000
Wii U's are already on the second-hand market? That doesn't bode well for the system.

45:14.000 --> 45:19.000
I bet a lot of the Wii U's you're seeing on the second-hand market right now are actually promotional copies.

45:19.000 --> 45:24.000
I bet it's a lot of people who got them early who didn't really want them in the first place.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
That's where they're coming from.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
We broke into GameStop.

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
You would have a couple, a handful.

45:30.000 --> 45:35.000
We stole a pallet or truckload of Wii U's systems and so we're selling ours off.

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
The Wii U's that were stolen out of the warehouse wouldn't have these games preloaded on it.

45:39.000 --> 45:47.000
And I would think a second, especially a promo Wii, is very likely to have, you know, it's going to be loaded with games on it already.

45:47.000 --> 45:52.000
I think the only other way Wii U's are on the second-hand market right now is people, you know, desperate times call for desperate measures.

45:52.000 --> 45:58.000
They have to sell them out of, you know, I was in a good financial place in November, but I'm not so much now.

45:58.000 --> 46:05.000
So I'm looking at, there's actually, um, there's actually some systems actually on eBay.

46:05.000 --> 46:12.000
Well, I mean, not a whole ton, but I see one right here that's got less than 24 hours left and no bids on it at all.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
You're getting tempted.

46:15.000 --> 46:19.000
No, I'm not. I'm honestly not getting tempted at all to buy a Wii U.

46:19.000 --> 46:26.000
I'm just curious to see, I wanted to see what they were, if the gray market had actually dropped out that badly.

46:27.000 --> 46:31.000
But no, not yet. There's still, I mean, what do you expect?

46:31.000 --> 46:37.000
I would expect to see a whole ton of U systems, what, a couple months after launch? Does that make any sense?

46:37.000 --> 46:42.000
Do you think that now that this is all over the internet, do you think this is something Nintendo's going to patch out?

46:42.000 --> 46:47.000
What do you think, based on kind of how you've observed the company's behavior in the past, what do you think is going to happen?

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Do you think Nintendo's going to patch this out?

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
I don't know if they can. I mean, why would this be in here in the first place?

46:52.000 --> 46:59.000
If it's still tied to the console, then I don't know, I don't know if they are going to or not.

46:59.000 --> 47:07.000
Regardless, you really, again, buying a U system, you're not going to have a way of knowing who has bought stuff,

47:07.000 --> 47:11.000
unless you're buying your friend's Wii U and you've been there when they've bought stuff.

47:11.000 --> 47:15.000
Oh dude, I'll give you 150 for your Wii U. Here.

47:15.000 --> 47:19.000
Really, Nintendo has no way of knowing that the console's been sold in the first place.

47:19.000 --> 47:25.000
All they're seeing is someone else is creating an account and they want to keep it so that you have multiple accounts can use the same game.

47:25.000 --> 47:31.000
It's kind of like how the PlayStation 3 is, you know, where you can play on multiple different sign-ins.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
Technically, doesn't the 360 work that same way as well?

47:34.000 --> 47:39.000
Not sort of. They sort of do. I mean, there's limitations to what you can do there.

47:39.000 --> 47:43.000
We cheated the system a little bit. Like, here in the house, we have two Xboxes, right?

47:43.000 --> 47:52.000
So, here's what we did. My system has the online pass tied to my Xbox account for Mass Effect 3, okay?

47:52.000 --> 47:59.000
So, what we did is I signed in to Alan's Xbox and I also get to use the online pass because it's tied to my account.

47:59.000 --> 48:06.000
Mass Effect 3 is two discs. Multiplayer is on both discs. So, I signed on to Alan's Xbox and it let me use my online pass.

48:06.000 --> 48:13.000
He signed on to my Xbox and he was allowed to use my online pass because it's on that Xbox, even though he's on his account.

48:13.000 --> 48:18.000
And we were both able to play Mass Effect 3 multiplayer without having to buy two online passes.

48:18.000 --> 48:22.000
This elaborate fucking system to save ten whole dollars, it worked.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
Good.

48:23.000 --> 48:29.000
Well, yeah, good. I mean, Alan and I are, you know, together. We've been together three years.

48:29.000 --> 48:33.000
We're in the same household. We happen to own two Xbox 360s.

48:33.000 --> 48:38.000
I plunked 60 bucks on the game. Why shouldn't we be able to play like a versus mode?

48:38.000 --> 48:43.000
It's a little silly that we had to go to such extreme measures.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
They're gonna send the police after you now.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Oh, come and get me.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Come at me, bro.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
That's right, come at me, bro.

48:51.000 --> 48:58.000
Alright, so, let's talk about more ridiculous ways to stop you from having fun and that kind of stuff.

48:58.000 --> 49:05.000
So, Sony has patented a new technology. They'll basically tie RFID tags to a game disc.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
So, it'll actually be inside the disc.

49:07.000 --> 49:20.000
And what that's supposed to do is that RFID tag will be read by the game system and will basically lock the disc to the system so that you can only play on that.

49:20.000 --> 49:27.000
Basically, think of it like an online pass for a game, but without actually having to enter any codes in or something.

49:27.000 --> 49:32.000
So, it's gonna say, okay, this disc has been played on this system, so we're gonna tie it to that.

49:32.000 --> 49:38.000
And if you play it on another system, the thought is, okay, well, it's just gonna be...

49:38.000 --> 49:44.000
You're either not gonna be able to do that or it's gonna have some sort of limited functionality like no multiplayer.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
You have to buy an online pass or something like that.

49:47.000 --> 49:54.000
And everybody's flipping their shit going, you know, what the fuck, this is the end of the world, you know.

49:55.000 --> 49:59.000
How are we gonna stop this? Let me put it this way. It's like this.

49:59.000 --> 50:05.000
If they do this, this is gonna get hacked. This is basically like giving people an excuse to hack this console.

50:05.000 --> 50:12.000
You think that hacking on the PS3 took a long time? Well, this shit is gonna take no time because people are...

50:12.000 --> 50:18.000
The way they see it is anti-consumerist and so they will just go at it full bore.

50:18.000 --> 50:23.000
If this were to really happen, Sony could kiss its ass goodbye in the console wars.

50:23.000 --> 50:28.000
Honestly, because all Xbox would have to do is come out and say, our system doesn't do that.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
You know, you have the right to do whatever with your property.

50:30.000 --> 50:38.000
And then it's like, Sony might be able to score more exclusives in a way, but I think the user base would absolutely reject that shit.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
You know, I just don't see it working at all.

50:41.000 --> 50:49.000
Well, here's the problem too is if they find a way around it, all it's gonna do is, once again, it's gonna punish the actual legitimate buyers of that.

50:49.000 --> 50:54.000
Here's an unpopular thought. I don't see a lot of people going down this road.

50:54.000 --> 50:59.000
Didn't we have rumors before that the new Xbox was gonna do something like this?

50:59.000 --> 51:03.000
That it was gonna have a burner in it that would tie the disks to your user ID?

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
Didn't this exact same rumor go around about Microsoft?

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
I think so.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Here's another thought too, okay?

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
Just to finish my thought, please let me finish my thought. No, that's okay.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
But yes, those rumors went around before, right?

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
Yes.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
Could this be a defensive patent by Sony then?

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
Sony patented it so that Microsoft can't do it.

51:26.000 --> 51:34.000
I mean, I know we're all quick to jump to conclusions that it might be the worst case scenario, but could it in fact be the best case scenario?

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
I know, I know. I'm going out on a limb.

51:38.000 --> 51:46.000
I think the best case scenario, and this is just, I don't know if this is gonna happen, but let's just say that they have a way that you can,

51:46.000 --> 51:53.000
it's basically to verify that the game disk hasn't been pirated, like you haven't, it's a legitimate copy.

51:53.000 --> 52:00.000
Because, you know, you can burn copies of disks and stuff like that and play them in systems, mainly on 360 and Wii and stuff like that, but it can be done.

52:00.000 --> 52:06.000
So let's just say that this is to authenticate that there is, that this is a legitimate disk.

52:06.000 --> 52:13.000
Although, I would think it'd be pretty easy to snap an RFID tag on there somehow, but let's just say that this is why they're doing it.

52:13.000 --> 52:18.000
And then it stores that ID code or whatever in your system, and it ties the game to your system.

52:18.000 --> 52:26.000
However, later on, say you want to get rid of that disk, or if it's a rental or something like that, then you'd be able to revoke your privileges.

52:26.000 --> 52:32.000
Although, that wouldn't really work if you do that, because then the average consumer's not gonna know to do that when they rent a game, and so that wouldn't work.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
It'll get hacked.

52:34.000 --> 52:40.000
Okay, I love doing live shows. This is why. I didn't even think of this thought, and I think this is hitting the nail on the head.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
I think this is a great comment.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Live.vognetwork.com, our live chat room.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Dungeon Buster, gold star for you.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Here's the comment.

52:48.000 --> 52:57.000
It might also be used in a non-gaming situation to lock down things like content disks containing code, demo materials, libraries, etc.

52:57.000 --> 53:02.000
that will be passed on to developers or used in public spaces like convention floors.

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
Brilliant. I bet that is exactly what it is.

53:05.000 --> 53:10.000
It's not necessarily something that's gonna be out there for everybody. It's gonna be on all the consoles.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
But this is how they're gonna prevent leaks of games.

53:13.000 --> 53:22.000
Because when they put out all the promotional materials and so forth, and all the promo disks, those are gonna be tied to the accounts of the people that are reviewing them.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
That's probably what it's really about.

53:24.000 --> 53:32.000
And think about it. Sony is also a motion picture studio, which means they send out screener Blu-rays for the Oscars and all that stuff.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
They wanna lock that shit down too.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
I think that's a brilliant thought what this could be.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
This may not be for everybody. This could be for a promotional case only.

53:39.000 --> 53:46.000
Because if something like this only affects people that are using promotional devices and so forth, you stop the day zero leaks this way,

53:47.000 --> 53:55.000
and people aren't as apt to hack it because it's affecting people that don't really have these consoles that aren't the hackers in the first place.

53:55.000 --> 53:58.000
Yeah, but here's the problem with that though. That wouldn't work.

53:58.000 --> 54:04.000
If it's gonna be a standard Blu-ray with the RFID tag inside there, if you have a device that doesn't read the RFID tag, there's no way to lock it out.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
It's just gonna read it as a disk.

54:06.000 --> 54:10.000
It's not gonna go, oh hey, I'm not gonna play this because there's not an RFID code.

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
No, it's a Blu-ray disk. It's just gonna read it.

54:13.000 --> 54:17.000
That would only work on a console or something where it has the technology in place to do that.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Who said the reader wouldn't be in there?

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
There's a difference between putting it in there and using it.

54:21.000 --> 54:25.000
Maybe what it's looking for is that the general games would just have an open tag.

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
It's not gonna be tied because they know it would be the kiss of death.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
No, no, no, I'm not talking about that.

54:30.000 --> 54:36.000
I'm talking about if you're looking at a scenario where you're trying to prevent piracy with these movie leaks or something like that,

54:36.000 --> 54:41.000
your standard Blu-ray drive is not gonna read that RFID tag, so it's gonna mean nothing to it.

54:41.000 --> 54:48.000
It's gonna pretend it's not even there, and so that's not gonna work unless they come out with a whole new disk format that's gonna do this.

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
Why not? And Sony could do that. Why not?

54:51.000 --> 54:58.000
I mean, if you're talking about Oscar screeners and things that they want to put the clamp down on,

54:58.000 --> 55:02.000
it would not be unheard of for Sony to send everybody a new Blu-ray player.

55:02.000 --> 55:07.000
It doesn't matter. You incorporate it into a console, you incorporate it into a disk drive, it's gonna get hacked.

55:07.000 --> 55:12.000
It's just gonna get hacked. It's gonna be a target, so why even bother?

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
SSJ100Matt in chat says,

55:14.000 --> 55:18.000
Things are gonna get leaked anyways, because few safeguards end up working, the hackers will find a way.

55:18.000 --> 55:26.000
True, I'm not saying this will necessarily prevent it from happening, but it's all about stopping those day zero leaks.

55:26.000 --> 55:31.000
That is what they hate the most, because where are the most sales of games in the first week?

55:32.000 --> 55:38.000
So the better they can plug or delay the inevitable leak or hack or whatever, the better they can delay that,

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
the more that game's gonna sell. That's the reality.

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
Just a thought. I thought that was a great thought from our chat room.

55:50.000 --> 55:56.000
Live.vognetwork.com. And again, maybe in some ways I'm thinking best case scenario.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
I think that would be a smart thing to do.

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
But let's look at it this way also. I don't think that's how they're gonna use it.

56:01.000 --> 56:08.000
I think they're gonna lock down game content. I mean, they're the only first party that has online passes for their fucking games.

56:08.000 --> 56:15.000
If they do it and Microsoft doesn't, why don't they just kiss their ass goodbye right now?

56:15.000 --> 56:19.000
Because they're doing it now, and Microsoft doesn't do that, and they're fine.

56:19.000 --> 56:24.000
Well, because Microsoft does it a different way by charging you a yearly fee for Xbox Live Gold.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
They're doing it.

56:25.000 --> 56:32.000
Well, they probably can't do it because it would be like, hey, what the fuck, I'm paying you, and now I have to pay you again.

56:34.000 --> 56:38.000
They find other ways to do it. Forza Horizon last week we were talking about.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
They find other ways to nickel and dime you.

56:40.000 --> 56:43.000
Really, that $10 is not fucking financing a goddamn network.

56:43.000 --> 56:47.000
It's just financing them bitching about, oh, we don't get enough money.

56:47.000 --> 56:52.000
You really think that $10 goes to the developer or that $10 goes to running those servers?

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
It does not fucking go to them.

56:54.000 --> 56:58.000
No, look at the game. The games have already been shut down that use those passes.

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
It doesn't go to shit. It just goes to line their pockets even more.

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
It's $10 more they made because you bought the game used.

57:04.000 --> 57:09.000
All right, well, moving on to hacking and so forth.

57:09.000 --> 57:17.000
Big progress made, according to the gaming blogs and the gaming news sites this week, on hacking Nintendo's 3DS handheld.

57:17.000 --> 57:21.000
Hacker Nemod, I hope I didn't say that wrong, but that's the name.

57:21.000 --> 57:26.000
Nemod says that he got full control of the 3DS via a kernel mode.

57:26.000 --> 57:31.000
One of the benefits, now the 3DS could potentially be region-free through this hack.

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
So you could run a Japanese because, as you know, the 3DS is region-locked.

57:34.000 --> 57:39.000
So you could run a game from any region on whatever region's handheld you wanted to.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
So, you know, that's one perk.

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
And then, of course, eventually we're talking about homebrew.

57:44.000 --> 57:48.000
However, this also would open the door to things like piracy.

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
So it's, you know, kind of a very delicate sort of situation.

57:51.000 --> 57:56.000
But whatever way it is, progress has been made on the hack.

57:56.000 --> 58:00.000
Nintendo, of course, I wouldn't expect them to sit down quietly for this.

58:00.000 --> 58:05.000
I'm sure there would be a patch as soon as they can figure out how he did it that will patch it out.

58:05.000 --> 58:10.000
But you could always not get said patch and possibly hack the system.

58:10.000 --> 58:15.000
Well, the other thing, too, is you could lock out that update because you have a full control of the kernel.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
So you just say, okay, you're not going to download.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
And also, the updates don't download automatically.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
You have to accept those updates.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
And so, I don't know.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
It'd be easy to hack that.

58:26.000 --> 58:30.000
But some games won't run unless you're on the most current firmware, right?

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
Well, there's ways around that, too.

58:33.000 --> 58:38.000
I'm just saying. They try to put as many gotchas in there as they can.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
And everything can be patched.

58:40.000 --> 58:44.000
Well, Jamie, I think you have kind of something along the same lines, right?

58:44.000 --> 58:48.000
Well, the Mutant Mudds story, right?

58:48.000 --> 58:54.000
Yeah, with that one, there was a comment made by the developer for Mutant Mudds and Dementium.

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
His name is... I'm hoping I'm pronouncing it right.

58:57.000 --> 59:01.000
Is that Jules Watcham or Jules?

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
It's with a J.

59:02.000 --> 59:08.000
Anyway, he had concerns about piracy on the 3DS, saying that if piracy gets bad, then...

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
I'm just paraphrasing.

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
They have no choice but to stop supporting the platform with new games.

59:13.000 --> 59:17.000
And he goes on to say that some people say that piracy leads to more game sales,

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
claiming it enables players to try before they buy.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Bullshit.

59:21.000 --> 59:25.000
And a lot of people looked at it as an attack on Nintendo.

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
So he went back in and said that he's always supported it.

59:28.000 --> 59:31.000
That he loves Nintendo and the 3DS.

59:31.000 --> 59:37.000
But all he's saying is that if piracy gets bad on the 3DS, they can't put out new games.

59:37.000 --> 59:45.000
And it's not that he's taking a stand on piracy, but it's more of a business action to develop games

59:45.000 --> 59:49.000
so that they can, I guess, save their money. It'd be a business decision.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
Right.

59:50.000 --> 59:59.000
But, I mean, honestly, I really don't think that it's gonna be that much of a factor in affecting the business.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
The people who want it bad enough are still gonna buy it.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
The people who want to steal it bad enough are still gonna steal it.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
They're gonna find a way, yeah.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:14.000
And honestly, there's been a couple of times where I've sampled something and have gone out and bought it.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
I think it's how a lot of people are. I've done that with music a bunch of times.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I'll hear somebody on YouTube and I'll go buy the album.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Yeah, I do that with music a lot, too.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
To the industry's credit, though, they've made it very easy.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I think they kind of figured out a way to combat it with things like Spotify.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Spotify makes it very easy to sample things very hassle-free and make a legal decision from there if you want or what have you.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Or you can still do it illegally if you want.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:49.000
But I think the music industry is finally figuring out ways to embrace the fact that there are people that want to try it for nothing

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
and then maybe we'll pay if it's good enough.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Well, one thing that he did say, and this is something we've been saying for ages,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.000
is that he doesn't think there's a solution to piracy, that it will always exist.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
This is what he said, I accept that piracy will exist on the 3DS.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000
The question is how much is it affecting the market.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Some markets maintain a healthy business environment alongside piracy.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.000
I believe this is due to many factors, not the least of which is the service provided in that market.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I get what he's saying.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
He's basically saying, if it's just going to be open season and everybody's stealing shit back and forth on a 3DS,

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
what's the value in me putting my game out on it?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Which is what the PlayStation 4 might turn into if this ends up being worst case scenario, what we talked about earlier.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Well, he did say that there's going to be a sequel to Mutant Mudds and it will be an eShop release.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Mutant Mudds might not be out.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Well, there was something else that was occurring to me.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Oh, sure.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000
I mean, maybe that is why there's a lot more people leaning towards digital distribution

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:59.000
and having a key attached to it so that they can verify IP where it's downloaded.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I mean, I understand why they're doing it.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:09.000
It just seems with the physical copy, there's a lot more potential to crack what's there.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
All right.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Mutant Mudds might not be a new game this week, so let's travel around the world and see what is new this week

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
as we check out the release dates, which might be thin.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Yeah, still thin. Not much this week.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Thankfully, Anarchy Reigns finally making its way out over here in North America on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:33.000
And then The Sims 3 gets yet another expansion with The Sims 3 Monte Vista.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Yeah, so that's it.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Yeah, traveling to Japan again looks like things are kind of on a hiatus right now until a little later in the month.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000
There's really not a lot to look for in Japan right now.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Just looking at the different consoles just to make sure.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:53.000
But I don't see anything on the Xbox 360 or the PlayStation 3, 3DS, none of that.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Looks like we're on break till mid-January, so play what you've got.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Dark Sakura, how about UK?

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Hey, there's Steam, you know.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
On the 11th of January, we have...

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Do they have Steam in Japan?

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I think so.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I wouldn't see why not, but everything would have to be licensed for that reason.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Yeah.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.000
On January 11th, Anarchy Reigns and Ninja Gaiden 3.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Alrighty.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
That's it.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Just a couple more news stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:26.000
So, THQ had arranged, I want to say it was last week, maybe even earlier this week,

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:34.000
arranged a sale that tied in with their bankruptcy protection that they did to sell off their assets to,

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000
I want to say it was Clear Lake Capital Group.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.000
And basically the plan, the way they put it out was that they were going to do this quick sale

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:50.000
and this Clear Lake Capital Group was going to take ownership of all that stuff

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
and I guess that they were still going to be able to complete their games

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:59.000
and all their IPs would kind of remain their own and it would kind of wipe out the debt that they had.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:06.000
However, the people that they owe money to weren't exactly happy about the fact that, hey,

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:13.000
their debt's going to be wiped out and they're not going to get paid for the stuff that they owed money for

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:21.000
and that they're kind of trying to do this really quick sale without getting any further bids on the company.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:34.000
So, what they're basically doing now is they actually have some different people interested in these IPs.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:41.000
So, including Warner Games is actually looking to possibly buy some of their IPs.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:56.000
And they were saying that, I guess the whole objection came from the, I want to say some of their people that were owed money, the creditors.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.000
And they were saying, rather than being designed to maximize the value of the debtor's estates,

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.000
the bidding procedures by design or otherwise render the auction process meaningless

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:16.000
and virtually guarantee that Clear Lake will be the ultimate buyer, thereby ensuring that the debtor's management retain their positions within

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000
and the operating control over the debtor's organization.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:30.000
So, it sounds like the whole thing was rigged, but now it's kind of, they're throwing a monkey wrench into it now that they've kind of objected to the quick sale.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:38.000
So, what do you think this ultimately means, Loki? Does this mean THQ is going to be nothing but Saints Row and Darksiders getting sold to somebody else?

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Or what does this mean for the future, you think?

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000
I don't know. I mean, we'll have to see who bids on what or what happens.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:52.000
It's kind of ballsy to think that they were able, they were going to organize this whole thing to just kind of,

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:59.000
I mean, obviously they want to put themselves in a better position, but it's very risky to just kind of put yourselves out there for sale

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:07.000
and then rely on one company to buy you without expecting anyone else to not kind of come in,

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.000
or trying to shorten that window so small that only one person could come in.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
It's kind of like you've arranged the buyer.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Okay, I'll tell you what. We're going to get this Clear Lake Capital Group to come in.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:27.000
We told them that we're going to do this, and we're going to have the window open for five minutes for anybody else that wants to walk in and possibly plays a bid.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Go. Oh, no one's here. Oh, I guess I just wanted to tell you guys, you know, it's just very, I don't know.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Shady?

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Yes.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:45.000
All right, fair enough. Before I get into another news story here, just to go back to another topic before our chatters talking about Steam in Japan.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:51.000
ActDeaf says, Rob, there is Steam in Japan. And I was like, okay, does that mean there's different games?

01:06:52.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Rob, I imagine there's some differences. Since Activision isn't in Japan, they probably have to wait for Square Enix to put out Call of Duty, for example.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:06.000
So we don't know all the specifics, but there is Steam in Japan, which makes sense.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:14.000
ActDeaf, I know he's in Mexico, so he gets his Steam games through, you know, I'm pretty sure it's the same Steam that we're using here in the US,

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:20.000
but it does demonstrate that Steam is available in other countries, so I don't see why there wouldn't be a Steam in Japan.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Makes a lot of sense to me. All right, well, something that's going to be right here in the US, maybe.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:36.000
A new project from Namco, which sounds awesome to me, experimenting with a project called Level 256.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Level 256, by the way, is the very last stage in Pac-Man before you get the kiss of death, which is appropriate because this is a Namco project,

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:55.000
talking about high-end food and entertainment all in one place. They're talking about a prototype maybe in Chicago that could possibly become this chain

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:01.000
that would have pool, shuffleboard, video games, and other types of immersive attractions.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
A quote from the CEO of Namco Entertainment, David Bishop,

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:11.000
quote, it's no secret that we've been exploring a number of new business models and noodling, I love that, noodling the future of out-of-home entertainment

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:18.000
for several years now, and our current planning does include an upscale restaurant with entertainment elements.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:25.000
So it's basically going to be Dave and Buster's in many ways. Who knows, who knows, it could be more upscale, who knows.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Sounds good to me. You know, Namco still pumps out machines that show up in the arcades, all types of machines.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Namco does Flame and Finger. That's one of my favorite Dave and Buster's games. I am the master at Flame and Finger. I hit the jackpot.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:45.000
I don't know, I'd be more excited if it was Tecmo doing an upscale entertainment business.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Of course, that would just be a strip club.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000
No, no, that's a lowbrow entertainment business that you're talking about over there, nasty.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Hey, well, they still have Soul Calibur, so there's still a chance.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Little competition would be healthy. I can't think of a lot of places like Dave and Buster's. Maybe Jillian's? They don't really have those out here.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
But I know Jillian's is a chain.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
1980's Chuck and Cheese.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:13.000
I think they sold. I think Jillian's might have sold to Dave and Buster's, so yeah, I guess that doesn't exist.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
There's John's Incredible Pizza.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Oh yeah, John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza. But that's more for kids.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
They have a roller coaster, so they count.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000
I like pizza, I like arcade games.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000
They should just open up a place that has pizza and arcade games. Why do we have to complicate it?

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Hey, Codeman, I used to work for Namco. In an arcade.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:45.000
WhatupG in chat says Nintendo is also doing work on Smash. An arcade version of Smash? Yes, please.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Namco also did the whole F-Zero AX. Remember that was the Triforce between them, Sega and Nintendo? Awesome arcade machine.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
What about the Mario Kart arcade that had Pac-Man?

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
That was Namco too, yeah.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Rama does confirm in chat Jillian's was sold to Dave and Buster's and converted. That's what I thought.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Alright, let's see. Let's talk about the classics. Let's talk about when all there was was Chuck E. Cheese and Showbiz Pizza.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Which were technically the same company.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Which were technically the same thing.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Hey, there was Bullwinkles, okay? There was alternatives.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
We're out in Alabama.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Let's go back to when animatronic animals were all the rage. It's a segment we call the classic game of the week.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Where Dark Soccer is going to jump into the gaming vault and hopefully. It's so sticky.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:44.000
She will find a game that she thinks, hey, play this now. Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Classic game is Ninja Warriors. And I'm not talking about the arcade version from 1988.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000
I'm talking about the SNES one. Which in Japan was called the Ninja Warriors again.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.000
And in Europe it was Ninja Warriors The New Generation.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:08.000
It's a beat-em-up that was developed by Natsume before they went all Harvest Moon on us.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
And when they used to release games that kicked ass.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.000
And it was released by Taito. It came out for the SNES in 1994.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:20.000
And it is indeed a remake of the 1988 arcade game The Ninja Warriors.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:28.000
It's set in the future. The population has been oppressed by the military and brainwashed.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:34.000
So these androids are going out to save everybody.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:44.000
So it is a side-scrolling beat-em-up. It's very similar to Shinobi or Bad Dudes.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.000
But it's in widescreen format. You can be the strong ninja.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:57.000
You can be the kanoichi. You can be kamaitachi. Those are the three characters.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Each of them has their own set of moves, different attacks, jumping attacks, throws, different defense positions, and power moves.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:15.000
So the game is actually really good. But the only bad drawback to it is that it's only single player. You don't have a co-op mode.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:24.000
I would love this game if there was a co-op mode in it. But I always used the kanoichi when I played it.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000
It was a fun little game. I remember the issue of EGM that they advertised this in.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
And I was like, I must have this game.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000
What did Sushi X have to say about this game?

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
It got a 90% in GamePro. I'll tell you that.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:45.000
82% by EGM, with it saying this is the best side-scrolling fighting game yet.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
That's because Final Fight Guy hadn't come out yet.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Actually, I think it's cooked. Did it come out after Final Fight Guy?

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
I don't know. I'm just making shit up.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:13:02.000
But anyway, the kanoichi in the game was rated as one of the top ten fighting women in video games makes me three.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.000
So I don't have really a whole lot to say about it. I mean, it is side-scrolling fighter.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:14.000
But it's a fun game. And you can probably find this pretty inexpensively at your local used store.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000
So get it. Remember when Natsume made awesome games?

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Not a fan of Tulips?

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Tulips was funny, but that's silly.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Alright, your classic game of the week. Ninja Warriors on the Super Nintendo.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.000
This is a rare case of Dark Sakura endorsing the remake.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
You know what? I played a crap ton of this game.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Because yes, we had remakes on the Super Nintendo, and a lot of them were awesome.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000
For example, Super Mario All-Stars. Awesome.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Where we actually could play the real Super Mario Brothers 2.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Amen.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
This game had explosions and shit going on.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:56.000
And I think her hair was a weapon. The kanoichi.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
And she just threw a whole tank of cocaine.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Well, she's also an android.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
I want my hair to be a weapon.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
There it is, your classic game of the week.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
My hair practically is a weapon if I let it grow.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Alright, we're going to take a break here at OLR Studios.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
But we'll be back with more gaming news.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
We've got some rapid-fire news coming up.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
The FUGL question of the week should be a fun one this week.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000
And as announced in the opening of tonight's show.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Could playing MMOs make you more attractive to job seekers?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
We'll see.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Port please. Port pront please.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Yes, on my resume.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000
I gave over 1500 ports to prontera in the 2011 fiscal year.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Alright, we'll be back after this with more of Orange Launch Radio.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Don't go anywhere guys. Stay tuned.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:58.000
We are live with our 488th episode on this January the 6th of 2013.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Live at the Voice of Geeks Network.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
vognetwork.com as we are every Sunday night.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Live during the break tonight.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000
They heard some music from Street Fighter X Mega Man.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
We can't play that stuff during the podcast.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000
But if you want to experience what it was like to be here live.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
You can check out the soundtrack for yourself.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
It's a pay what you want thing.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
So you can put zero.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
But Dark Soccer, you say pay something. Do it.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Seriously, the guy put a lot of work into it.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
And he did it for the community.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
So just pay something. Anyone can afford a dollar.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Rivalrivalrival.bankcamp.com

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Is the website where you can get that.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
And technically it's like slash albums.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
But just go to Rival Rival Rival.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Good times. Good times.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Alan's back from work earlier than expected.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Hi Alan. How was your gaming week?

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Did you play a lot of good games this week?

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
What did you play?

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
He's not going to yell across the room.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000
How much did the Steam sale damage your wallet?

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000
How about we wait until he can actually get on the microphone to ask him these questions.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Just a quick question.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000
How much did the Steam sale damage your wallet?

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:10.000
I would say I was able to keep the Steam Holiday sale in check for I want to say $35 or less.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Which is really good.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
You did worse than me though if you spent that much money.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Have you played Torchlight 2 yet?

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
I installed it.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
That's the first step. There you go.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000
I bought Hearthfire during their break.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
It's $2.50.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Wait a minute. You talked me out of buying Dark Souls and now you bought stuff.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Well it's because some of the mods I had required Hearthfire.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000
So I wanted to install that so I can install those mods.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Alright.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Alan also and I celebrated 3 years on Friday.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
So congratulations Alan.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Gross.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Squish squish.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
But no.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000
The only reason why I bring that up is that we got to do dinner at Ruth Chris Steakhouse.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Because I had won a gift card through work.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Oh my god. Steak.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Nom.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
That is so good.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Have you ever had Ruth Chris?

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
No I haven't. We saw that when we went to the mall the other day.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
No. I haven't been there.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Even if it's not Ruth Chris like Morton's or one of those fancy steakhouses.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
No. I like the Daily Grill.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
They only had the nearest one that was in Modesto or San Francisco.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
I really wish they had one here.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
It's so good.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
They're peppercorn steak.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000
I should say something nice publicly about Ruth Chris and the whole experience.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:38.000
And I'm okay endorsing them because when we originally made the reservations we didn't really put that anything special was going on.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.000
But as we were being seated the gal asked are you celebrating anything?

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Unfortunately we're not quite at a society yet where we're looking at same sex relationships and it's no big deal.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000
And it isn't a big deal. It's just whatever right?

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:58.000
But still sometimes it's a little nervous to say okay well it's actually my anniversary.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
But I just went ahead and said that.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
And they were totally respectful and awesome.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000
And the waitress even put roses on our table.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:11.000
And everybody from the busser that came by to the other waitresses would actually come by and say,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Hey happy anniversary you guys.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
And would ask those questions like how long and so forth.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:20.000
It was just an awesome experience and I was so happy with that.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
So I should give them publicly props.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:28.000
So if you have a lot of money to spend on an expensive steak it's a great steak. I'm not gonna lie.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:36.000
What I was trying to say earlier is that one of my exes worked at Ruth's Chris.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000
And their steak knives are excellent to buy.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000
No you can actually buy the set of their steak knives. They're really nice.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.000
But I used to get food free from there all the time.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Oh lucky lady.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Just takeout stuff you know stuff that had been set back.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Well I mean I understand you were in a different situation where you got takeout.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
But you don't get takeout from Ruth's Chris.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.000
No but some of the servers could take dinner home.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Sure like if a steak was overcooked or something.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Yeah and you know so it was I never ate in the restaurant.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
But I've had plenty of stuff from there.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
So it was good food.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Awesome.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Alright anyhow.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Oh you guys make me hungry for yet another buttery delicious steak.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
But we have more gaming news to cover.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Buttery steak? No that sounds gross.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.000
There's actually a place down in Sacramento that I just saw that's called butter and steak.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Or butter and bacon.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:34.000
My friends I do brunch almost every Sunday with a group of friends.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000
And they all went there and they said it's really good but it's a long wait.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
We missed that week. We were doing something else that Sunday. We didn't go.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
We went to Pour House today.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000
My sister was telling me that they were doing Bacon Fest 2 down there.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Somebody was asking you earlier and I don't know who it was in chat.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000
I'm sorry chatter but somebody was asking you about if you've seen the show The United States of Bacon.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000
No I haven't.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
I guess that's a thing.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Who knew it was a thing but it's a thing.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Alright.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Alright.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Very nice comment. Thank you from SSJ100 Matt in our chat room.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
The rest of the country could learn from a steakhouse.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Treating everyone like the same human being.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
I could not agree more.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.000
But I'm thankful that the people that participate with this show like you know whatever.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
You know. Awesome.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Anyhow.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Let's get into some rapid fire news.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Back to gaming. The thing we all enjoy when we're not eating. Low key.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
So Lego.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Even though they haven't really run out of properties to make things out of.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I mean they did create that Ninjago or whatever that is.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
And I don't still understand that.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
But they have that series now.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:46.000
So now they have this new Lego Legends of Kima.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:53.000
And it's some sort of looks like mythical creatures that they're going to now sell toys for.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
But they also have this video game franchise that they're creating.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
It's basically I think iOS games.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
iOS and portable games.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:06.000
So they're going to have this Lego Legends of Kima Speedzores.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Way to make up words.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.000
It's I guess a racing mini game that's on Lego.com and on iOS.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Then they're going to have Lego Legends of Kima levels journey.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
That's coming to 3DS and Vita.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
And I guess the DS later on.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
And then Lego Legends of Kima Online.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.000
That's going to be a free to play online world.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
So.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000
I guess it's weird.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:40.000
It looks very like fantasy mythical stuff.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Like they have this looks like a lion headed warrior with this sword that's all lightning and stuff.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
And he's throwing a magic ball.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
And this like angel hawk headed guy.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000
I don't know.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.000
It's funky looking.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
But I'm sure the toys will be cool.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Live.vognetwork.com says without grown crappy kids toys Loki will never get this shit.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Bite your tongue sir.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
There are tons of people that are into those Lego games.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
There's tons of adults that are into Legos.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
No I don't have a problem with Legos.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000
I still get Legos.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000
I don't get the Lego franchises that Lego themselves have built.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Like what do they have?

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
They have that whole Lego.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Well the Ninjago stuff doesn't make any.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
I mean it's ninjas I understand that.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
But it's just kind of beyond that.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
I don't really know the lore and crap with that.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
And then they also had the...

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
The fuck was it?

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:38.000
They had some other Lego series that looked like these weird Mayan robot things or something.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.000
It's like the Technic toys that they turned and made like weird characters out of.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000
And it was just weird.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Technica or something like that.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
I don't know if it was Technica but it was something weird like that.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000
And then this.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
This doesn't make any sense to me.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000
It's just all these made up words and shit.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
I don't know who these people are.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.000
I can understand Lego, Lord of the Rings and that kind of crap.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000
It makes sense.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
And the toys make sense.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000
But I don't know.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
For me it would be hard to get into this.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:10.000
I guess the reason they're doing this is probably because how they did the Lego, Lord of the Rings.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
But there's not really another Lord of the Rings coming out.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I guess there is next year.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
But the Lord of the Rings stuff.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
There's a Hobbit movie.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Technically it's The Hobbit.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Well they're still lumping it all in there.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
They're not going to do Lego, Lord of the Rings 2, The Hobbit.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Which is really what it's going to be probably for a couple of years.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
So they're going to come out with something in the meantime for next year.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
And this is what it's going to be there.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
The Lego game that's three hours of nothing.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000
They're going to do.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Just kidding.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Lego.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000
I don't know.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Some other franchise.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.000
I'm sure they can.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000
There's Harry Potter.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000
There's Star Wars.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
They're not going to do any more Harry Potter ones.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Because obviously there's no more movies tying with that.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
I think they could probably do.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
What about Lego Pottermore?

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
They could totally do that.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Disney owns Star Wars now.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
There's going to be more Star Wars in the future.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.000
What about Lego Hunger Games?

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
No that's not going to happen.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
What other movie franchises could become Lego games?

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Well they have Lego Prince of Persia.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Which they could do something with.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
They have the rights to that.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Lego Avengers?

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Is this Game Guru in our chat room?

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000
No.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Avengers.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Remember Avengers are Mega Bloks.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
I want Lego Hunger Games.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Or Cubic.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000
I'm a genius.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000
That would be a great game.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Wouldn't you play Lego Hunger Games?

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.000
No.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Wouldn't you?

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000
I don't like the Lego games.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
You want to play Lego Hunger Games?

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000
There's the Hunger Games things that you can run on Minecraft.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000
That's as close as you're going to get.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.000
May the odds never be in your favor.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Odds are you're paying too much for this Lego set.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Alright.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:47.000
And then there's another game that's being released I guess.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.000
It was unfinished and it was a version of the game Faceball.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000
But it was called Niko-chan Battle in Japan.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:01.000
And it was for the ever successful portable console Virtual Boy.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
You know the monochrome red.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
You mean the migraine machine.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Yes the migraine machine.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000
And guess what?

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.000
If you're looking for a reproduction cartridge of the Virtual Boy game.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
You can get it.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
It's going to be released in February for $100.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Or you can get the ROM for free.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
And you know that is.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Well I like free.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
But you know what would be kind of cool.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000
And this is kind of tying back into the story with the whole homebrew stuff.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Wouldn't it be awesome.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
And I don't know why Nintendo hasn't done this already.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Wouldn't it be awesome if they released Virtual Boy games on the virtual console for the 3DS.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Because it's in 3D.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
And it has virtual in the name already.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
That makes too much sense.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
We're not going to do that.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Well plus doesn't Nintendo kind of want to distance themselves from that.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Like maybe that's.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Why?

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Might as well embrace it.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
They did it.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
For a while.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
I love the chatters by the way.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Now they're just shouting out all these random ass Lego games.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Sega says Lego cards against humanity.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
That's how I spent my New Years Eve by the way.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000
What up G. Lego Street Fighter X Mega Man.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Degenerate Johnny.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
This could be a thing Degenerate Johnny.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Lego Doctor Who.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000
I can see that.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000
I can see that.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Why not tap into what the big fandom is like.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Lego Merlin.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Lego Sherlock.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Why not.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Lego BBC.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000
No Lego Sherlock please.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Alright.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Lego Angry Birds.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
I am perfectly happy with just the show.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Alright moving on to more news.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000
You know a lot of the internet is now in the cloud.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000
They always talk about in the cloud.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Everything's out in the cloud.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000
And now you can have your save games on Playstation 3 and Xbox in the cloud.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
And everything can be in that fluffy little cloud.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000
But guess what?

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Sometimes the cloud fucks up.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
And that's what happened this week.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:51.000
The Xbox cloud wasn't available to some people.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Very interesting because only certain people were unable to access it for certain time.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
But that's how the internet works sometimes.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:07.000
They ended up giving a one month free of Xbox Live to those that were unable to get their cloud games available.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:12.000
So this probably also ties into Netflix was down on Christmas Eve for a lot of people.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Which drove them batty.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
And apparently someone at Amazon had pushed the wrong button.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Like Amazon actually fessed up and kind of apologized to Netflix.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Which I thought was interesting.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Yeah we didn't do that on purpose.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Yeah.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
We don't have a competing video streaming service or anything.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
So someone made the cloud disappear.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.000
And so if that's where your Xbox save files were you might not have been happy.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
In other very interesting news.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:41.000
A father in China decided to treat his son's internet addiction to an internet game.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.000
I don't know what game this was but he did it in a very interesting way.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:50.000
He hired an online hitman to take out his son.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Oh my gosh.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Apparently he was getting bad grades in school because of the gaming habit.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
He couldn't land a job.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
He couldn't get any work or whatever.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:04.000
And the father was very annoyed that he didn't take the job at the software development company or whatever.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000
I mean these are problems a lot of people go through or what have you.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:15.000
So the father hired games or hired players in the son's favorite games to hunt down the kid.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000
And we don't know how he did it or whatever.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000
But I imagine I could just see the post on like World of Warcraft forums.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Please kill my child.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Yeah we have a problem.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
5,000 G for hit.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.000
It's creative. I don't know.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:39.000
So anyway now this is the part where I start to wonder if the story is fake because it has a happy ending.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:45.000
But the child stuck up to his dad and said I can play or I cannot play.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000
It doesn't bother me.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
I'm not looking for any job.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.000
I want to take some time to find one that suits me.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000
We don't know if that was good enough to get the hitman's or the hitman called off.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Hitman. Stupid.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
I just am now imagining a gif of this kid.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Challenge accepted.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Very nice.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.000
It would be hilarious.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Yeah come at me with a hitman on grant.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000
I thought I'll just kick.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Come at me dad.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Alright moving on.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000
That situation will never end.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.000
That situation will never happen with me because I will always be more skilled than my son at any game that he plays.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.000
I will make that my life's mission.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
So in other news.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Zen Pinball 2 is supposed to come out on the Wii U but it's been delayed to I think later this month.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:34.000
And they're showing some of the games in it.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:39.000
One of them including Plants vs. Zombies which is pretty neat.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000
And I'm trying to get this other one pulled up.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
I think there was an Avengers one wasn't there?

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.000
I think there was in the old pinball games so maybe they brought it over.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000
I'm not sure though.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Maybe.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Anyway also an update for Street Fighter X Mega Man is coming.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.000
And it says that there is.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Let's see.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:05.000
On the download page the traffic they're saying was insane and broke the site.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.000
So they want to keep supporting it.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.000
And the guy behind everything.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Well Capcom's Senior Community Manager says that they're not done with the celebrations yet.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000
That means more.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Maybe we'll get Sakura.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000
This is going to be one of those celebrations that goes on for like a year.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Like my birthday.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Alright.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
That's it for rapid fire news tonight.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Let's go to the foogle question of the week.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
You smash Facebook and Google together.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Our Facebook community.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Our Google Plus community.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.000
And you get foogle.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Now first off foogle people.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Explain to me why when I post the question the day before I get less answers.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Y'all are yelling at me about not giving you enough notice for the questions.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Although I will say this.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
To the user's credit on our communities.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.000
We got like kind of a different sampling than we get when we post the questions some days.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
So alright let's hear from some other people we don't always hear from.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
On the foogle question of the week.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.000
One of our little sayings on OLR is hackers gonna hack.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.000
And it sounds like this week much progress was made towards hacking the 3DS.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
To be able to run custom code.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
We talked about this earlier in the show of course.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:22.000
When you hear stories like this do you tend to think it's a good thing for the community.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.000
To be able to work around region locks and homebrew.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Or do you think it's a bad thing for the community as it makes piracy easier.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.000
And makes companies want to come up with even more DRM ideas.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Or are you indifferent.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
You don't care.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Let's start with Google tonight.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Critical Myth.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000
One of the hosts of Critical Myth here at The Bog Network.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
4 o'clock Monday Wednesday Friday Pacific.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Critical Myth says hacking only gets on my nerves when it's done maliciously.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:51.000
With no consideration for the impact on others.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Such as some of the actions of Anonymous and similar movements.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000
I have to say though.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Anonymous lately has been freaking boss.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Well here's the thing without getting too political.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:08.000
My understanding is that you know part of the fact that there is Anonymous.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Is that there is a very kind of lack of organization.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000
No one's in charge.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Anonymous is kind of an idea right.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:18.000
So yeah I mean I think we all heard about some of the stuff they were doing.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Where they were teaming up with Roseanne of all people.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.000
To bring to light some of these really horrific things that were going on in Ohio.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000
I don't want to get into it.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
But it's you know go Google it.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.000
So you know you look at that.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.000
And combating the WBC.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:33.000
But then yeah but then I also get what Critical Myth is saying.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.000
They've done some other stuff that's not so great.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000
So you know anyhow.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:42.000
But let's focus more on the first part of that statement.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Hacking only gets on my nerves when it's done maliciously.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.000
With no consideration for the impact on others.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:53.000
One could argue that there's no consideration for the impact of gaming companies.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000
When people do this.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000
But then again there's some people that really want to run their homebrew.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Hmm tricky.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Rettertainment says as a normal everyday user of technology.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
I am indifferent about matters such as this.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Until the hackers cause the manufacturer of the product I'm using to change it in a way that impacts me.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Then I get really fucking pissed off.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Why should I the normal everyday user suffer because of a small minority of users?

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Well Rettertainment you must be really pissed at what some of the companies are doing with DRM now.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Earlier when Bobby Blackwolf gave us a call at the end of his show.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.000
We were talking about Sim City.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
And how I predict that game is going to tank.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
And it's going to be because of the DRM.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
I think a lot of people are predicting this honestly.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
But I also think it's going to be the most pirated game of next year.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
And it's all because of that DRM.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Let's go to Facebook and see what the folks on Facebook had to say.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
And we'll start it off on Facebook with Raginator.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
I'm against it and I think it's a bad thing.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Bobby once talked about this kind of thing on his show and I agree with his sentiment.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.000
To paraphrase, people hacking their systems ultimately boils down to one thing.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Piracy despite claims to the contrary.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Obviously piracy isn't defensible and hurts everyone in the long run.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Loki do you agree with that notion?

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Hacking is about piracy only.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Let's cut through the bullshit.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Let's cut through the bullshit.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.000
This isn't about homebrew.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000
This isn't about...

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
It's about piracy.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000
No I don't think that's so at all.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:19.000
The people that normally do create these exploits and stuff to open up a system.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Aren't doing it for stealing stuff.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:29.000
They're just doing it to have homebrew options or to make things a little bit more user friendly.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000
As far as removing region locking and that kind of stuff.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Granted there's a lot of people that also just want to pirate stuff.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
But those are pirates not hackers.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Black Wolf is in our chat room by the way.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Also kind of elaborating on this comment.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.000
He says he was paraphrased poorly which is fine.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000
That just gives people reason to go listen to your show.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
To get the word from the horse's mouth.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
However I will say this from Black Wolf.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Whenever I look at top homebrew apps for anything.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000
9 of the top 10 all facilitate backups.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
The other one is a media server.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:06.000
So if I'm putting kind of that together with what Loki says.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Maybe the people who author this stuff aren't necessarily doing it for piracy.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.000
But 90% of the people who go looking for it are.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Is that a fair statement? Loki?

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.000
A lot of people that are looking for hacks are yes looking for piracy.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Let's go to some more comments.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Lots of very long very well thought out comments on Facebook.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Unfortunately due to time I can't read these things in their entirety.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
So I really urge you guys during the week.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Check this out facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Or read some of these responses in their entirety.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000
DDR dollar bill says everyone has their arguments for and against this.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.000
You have those who want this.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
They can legitimately play imported games.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.000
And you have those who just want to download files off the web and play it.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Without having to pay the cent.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Pay a cent.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Regardless of the morality behind it.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Ultimately we have to wonder if it's good for the consumer or not.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:06.000
So you know the way that the game companies have to respond to what happens.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Burr responds and says I think it's a great thing for community.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
It gives independent developers a chance to play with new hardware.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Which in the 3DS's case could be especially interesting.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Because I feel it's potential hasn't been fully tapped yet.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.000
I think a lot of people are excited to see what type of homebrew could come up with.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Rob himself replies and says I got an original Xbox at the end of it's run.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.000
And ended up getting a chip to run homebrew and of course pirated games.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
I ended up with lots of games.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
If I did not like a game I would just pop a new one in.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.000
It would never be played again.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
So pretty much due to being spoiled for choice.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
I never really gave most games a chance.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000
That was the last time I had a console chipped and modded.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.000
And now I spend way more times on playing games that I paid for.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Very interesting conclusion.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:56.000
So what I'm reading into that is that because you just would throw away all these games.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
You had access to anything you wanted.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.000
And you ended up just throwing most of it away and never giving it a second thought.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:06.000
And because of that you just want to buy the games and focus on that.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000
As opposed to I guess wasting your time downloading crap.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.000
I think that's what I'm trying to read between the lines there.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.000
I think that's what I'm hearing.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000
That's what it sounds like.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Daniel S. replies and says these things will happen no matter what.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:23.000
All the people I know who hack and torrent are people who won't ever buy a game.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:28.000
I feel that it's because we keep our ear to the ground that we feel like it's a big deal.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Degenerate Johnny says actions like hacking consoles is considered questionable.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:38.000
It undermines the product that the company is producing and it promotes users to take an unethical behavior.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:45.000
That being said, such actions can be considered justified in cases such as this, referring to the 3DS.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Nintendo should offer as much freedom as possible to its consumers if it ever hopes to fend off the aggressive competition as Microsoft, Sony, and Apple.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:38:02.000
They shouldn't alienate its market based on location by forcing its consumers to purchase products that are only provided within their respective regions.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
That's the first half of the comment there.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Well, Devil's Advocate, it's Nintendo's hardware.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:16.000
They have the right to make whatever choices they want, but I guess what I'm hearing out of this is that this is how the community is going to respond to it.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:23.000
When you try to take these things away, the community will patch it in themselves, I guess.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Tigerlaw says it's both a good thing and a bad thing.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Oftentimes, a console would have certain features that a hacker would implement and those features would end up in a future update at some point as well as play imported games.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:42.000
It's also bad because it encourages piracy and makes those that do not intend on playing download it for free instead.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Dark Charger, very interesting comment here.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:56.000
As someone who has been playing games for over three decades and has worked in software development for over 15 years, this is a very difficult question to answer.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.000
The piracy of software that one doesn't already own a license to is stealing, period.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.000
This hurts not only game software makers, but the industry as a whole.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:11.000
That being said, I do not for an instant believe that a pirated game is necessarily a lost sale.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:17.000
It is a false equivalence that movie studios, the RIAA, etc. have been incorrectly trying to make.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:23.000
I think that people should be able to do with the hardware that they own what they want to the extent that it doesn't affect others.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:33.000
While I would love to believe that the hacking community is primarily interested in expanding independent gaming, we all know that on the whole, the primary motive in most of these cases is piracy.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:40.000
I do think, though, that these DRM restrictions only hurt legitimate buyers and are also largely ineffective.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
And he closes that with slash long-winded.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:48.000
I think that's a great comment and I'd like to hear from somebody that's kind of in that industry what they think.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Any thoughts on that comment, what Dark Charger said, Loki?

01:39:51.000 --> 01:40:06.000
I do agree that a lot of it's just not a lost sale because I think a lot of, going back to what someone else was calling, where you just download a bunch of games that you're probably just going to throw away.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:12.000
That you try once and you're like, eh, no, I can't see myself playing this. That's not necessarily a lost sale.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:23.000
And hell, I mean, if you look at it in reverse, what if you were a consumer that bought that game and you're just like, crap, this is absolute shit, or it's completely broken, or whatever, for whatever reason you don't like it.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:32.000
I agree that, yeah, you can't, that's one of the problems when they're calculating losses with piracy, you can't say that, oh, that was a lost sale.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:40.000
And sometimes, in the cases where you may pirate the game, play it for a few weeks, and then buy the physical copy when it comes out.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.000
How many people really do that?

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
There's a lot of people.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Alright. Next comment from Iamsuperlazy. I love that name. Me too, buddy, me too.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Iamsuperlazy says, I want to make things clear. I don't pirate, nor do I endorse piracy, and I do like the 3DS and have spent many hours playing the thing.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:09.000
That being said, I do agree with the Free Software Foundation's stance on things like being able to mess with the hardware if I have the capability to.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:16.000
It comes down to having control of what you buy because I own it and not being tied down to draconian TOS.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Lastly, Codeman replies and says, I think it comes down to two different kinds of people in the world, good and bad.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Good people will do something intelligent and fun with it, but bad will do something to destroy the fun for everyone else.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Either way, both will force companies to implement more restrictions so both sides lose.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:38.000
So I think I'm indifferent because in the right hands, it could be used for good.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:50.000
So if I were to read into Codeman's comment, he's saying that there are lawful good people in the world and there are chaotic evil people in the world, but you're more like true neutral.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Is that what I'm hearing? Maybe.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:42:01.000
In seriousness though, I think he's right. Some people have good intentions, some people do not have good intentions.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:04.000
I think that's true for a lot of things in life.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Anyhow, that's it for the FUGL Question of the Week.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Participate next week by joining one of our communities either on Facebook or on Google+.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Meanwhile, if there's no other comments here in the studio, we'll get to gaming news.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Alright, so there's another kind of Android console game, Android console coming out called the GameStick.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:35.000
And what the GameStick is, is it's basically this device that plugs into your TV using the HDMI port.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:43.000
It actually gets the power from the HDMI port if your TV supports that, otherwise they have an external adapter you can use either USB or a wall plug.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:50.000
It's going to go for $79 and it's supposed to play different Android games, very similar to the Ouya.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Versus though, I think that a lot of the games being put on this aren't necessarily being made specifically for it.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:02.000
It's not like it's going to have its own separate marketplace like the Ouya did.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Although they say that PlayJam is working with more than 250 developers to get titles made for and ported to the system.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:13.000
And it basically comes with a controller as well, very similar to the Xbox 360 controller.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:20.000
And what's kind of cool is the console, since it's the size of a USB stick, plugs into the, you can actually store it in the controller.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.000
So you just take the controller with you and pop it into a TV and away you go.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:29.000
That's like one of those wireless mouse, like laptop mice that have the USB dongle inside the mouse.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:38.000
And yes, it's going to run Jelly Bean on Android and then of course outputting at 1080p.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:43.000
And it's powered by an ArmLogic 8726MX mobile processor.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:52.000
They actually have quite a few of these kind of all-in-one devices that you can buy now that do this sort of thing.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Not necessarily with a controller attached to it, but you can get these kind of PCs on a stick that have all this Android stuff.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:06.000
You know, back when I was a teenager, the only thing you got on a stick was a hot dog.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:09.000
And now you can get a PC on a stick.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Yes.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:21.000
So it's expected out to, and of course, it is on Kickstarter, so they're working to kickstart this.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:27.000
And they're expecting the console to officially launch one month after the Ouya in April.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.000
And as of right now, just taking a quick peek to see if they've already hit their goals.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Oh wow.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
You know, it should do alright.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
How many people bought an Ouya and this?

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Is this competition for the Ouya Loki?

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:47.000
I don't know. I mean, the controller is set up, like I said, it was sort of like an Xbox 360.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:56.000
It's more of like, the analog layout is set up like the Xbox 360, but the controller looks like a classic controller on the Wii.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.000
And I don't know, it looks kind of cheap.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:03.000
But I mean, granted, it's a prototype that they're showing the picture of.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:08.000
I guess it could be feasible for somebody to look at this and say,

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:12.000
oh hey, I'll pick it up because it's $20 cheaper than the Ouya.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:16.000
But I would wait and see until they have some more information about this.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.000
You know, versus the Ouya.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000
I have a feeling you're going to see a lot more of these types of things coming out.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Of course.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Like I said, they already have them.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:28.000
The Ouya made a ton of money on Kickstarter.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Who doesn't like money?

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
And people are throwing it everywhere on Kickstarter.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:38.000
They already have different, if you actually do a search about the Arm Logic 8726 or whatever,

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:45.000
you can actually look and find some other devices that are very similar minus the controller.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:51.000
But once again, you could probably use a Bluetooth controller with it that are very similar.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:56.000
So the price point is pretty nice, considering you get a controller with it.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.000
But I don't know, it's interesting.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
All right, speaking of interesting, this next story.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Quite the opposite of what you usually hear when you talk about the media,

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:11.000
or universities and so forth reporting on games.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Polygon ran a very interesting article this week about World of Warcraft players.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Could they be the ideal employee?

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:22.000
And this article is based on a video from researcher John Seely Brown.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Did the video for Knowledge Forum, Big Think.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:29.000
And apparently in the video, Mr. Brown says,

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:35.000
I would rather hire a high level World of Warcraft player than an MBA from Harvard.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Why is a game, a massive multiplayer game that has maybe 12 million people or more playing it,

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:45.000
like World of Warcraft, so important at both the individual level and maybe at the corporate level?

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:48.000
To understand these massive multiplayer games like World of Warcraft,

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:53.000
do not think about it as just gameplay, but look at the social life on the edge of the game.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:47:00.000
And of course I get into talking about the guilds and how you got to manage people when you're running a guild.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:05.000
When you do well in these guilds, you get the extra bonuses and so forth.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
You have to do research.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
And you do this because you want to.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
You want to be better.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:18.000
And he calls that a self-organized ideation structure and an idea refinement structure.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:22.000
These guilds are truly meritocracy based.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:27.000
So even if you were the leader of this particularly high end raid, at the end you do an after action review.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:33.000
And the after action review, each person is open to total criticism by everybody else.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:37.000
More dots! More dots! It needs more dots!

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Would you hire that guy?

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Turn down Rob's vent.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Set Rob volume to 50%.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
One more quote here.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:54.000
The game described, quote, as an amazing learning environment with powerful learning tools that I think we in the education world can learn a hell of a lot about.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:57.000
And we in the management world can learn a lot about.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
But it gets back to this notion of passion.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
It gets back to this notion of curiosity.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:09.000
And it gets back to this notion that this is an interest driven phenomenon that unleashes exponential learning of a dimension that's almost unimaginable any other way.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
What do you guys think about this?

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Do you think there is merit to this?

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:22.000
That somebody who excels at World of Warcraft may bring something to the professional corporate table that somebody with an MBA from Harvard would not?

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:23.000
No.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Actually, yeah.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Because there's something to be said for book learning versus real life experience for interaction with people.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:36.000
You know, I often think sometimes a college degree can ruin a natural talent.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Well, I mean, I am coming from an art field.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:44.000
So, yeah, I've seen people's work the more education they have.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:47.000
It's important to say you're not saying all the time. You're saying some of the time.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:52.000
There's people who I totally respected as artists that I think that their work was better when they were still raw and new.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
I'm just saying.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:00.000
That being said, you have to, I think, have the background information to go with it.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:10.000
But if you want somebody who's going to be a good manager of people for someone who's going to be able to give feedback in an open environment,

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:17.000
you need someone who has experience in that you just don't get immediately in school unless you've taken tons of rhetoric classes.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
You know, apart from that.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Loki, you said no. What's your take?

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:26.000
The no on that is because I think you could say the same in the reverse.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:30.000
You know why you have, you know, this MMO.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.000
And granted, there's some people that are probably going to be well organized or whatever in this.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.000
But at the same time, you could also have well organized people that have an MBA.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
I don't think one's necessarily better than the other.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:43.000
It's just one went to college and I won.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:46.000
And that's not to say that the person playing World of Warcraft didn't go to college either.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:54.000
I mean, you're just they play a game that doesn't necessarily mean that mean anything.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:59.000
I mean, how 10 year olds play the game. Seven year olds probably play World of Warcraft and they may be good at it.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Does that mean you should hire a seven year old for your fucking job?

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:06.000
No, they are free to adults. It doesn't matter, though.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:11.000
I'm saying that the people that play this and necessarily can excel at this art.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:15.000
I mean, if you're going to say like they have all these team working skills and stuff like that.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:19.000
I'm sorry. But if you're hiring someone that can't work in a team, I mean, that that's a whole nother problem.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:22.000
You need to just get rid of that employee anyways.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:26.000
I don't think it has anything to do with their level of education. I don't know.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Rama in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says that my old job, we geeked it up, but you were shunned for playing WoW.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Here's my question. Why? I mean, I play WoW and I get that there's that stigma that's attached to it.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:44.000
But no offense, you watch My Little Pony.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Here's my thing. My point with that. I'm not knocking the bronies and all that.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:52.000
My point with that is that we've all got our thing. Right.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:57.000
And usually it's it's it's usually a social thing. And a lot of it is like community and so forth. Right.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:06.000
I you know, I wouldn't read this article to the extreme that, oh, a person who plays WoW is better than a person with an MBA.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Not necessarily. I wouldn't go that far with it.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:15.000
But I would read into that is that this guy is saying, hey, don't laugh at the guy who runs a high end guild in WoW.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Don't write him off automatically because he plays a computer computer game, because actually it can take a lot of discipline.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:31.000
And to that extent, I really agree with it, is that running a high end guild in WoW, you do have to manage people and you do have to learn how to settle down drama.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:36.000
And yes, a lot of those experiences can carry over into the real world. It is a social interaction.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.000
I'm not sure you appropriately are exposed to in college.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.000
No, you're not. That's why they require you to take a speech class.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:50.000
But one speech class doesn't really prepare you for that type of working with people.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:57.000
So I think these two skills complement each other. It's not necessarily that one betters the other.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:03.000
But I think the person who has the MBA and understand social interaction in WoW is a pretty good candidate.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Now, here's a very interesting question from Tiger Claw in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:14.000
He asks me, you're a corporate trainer by day, a Warcraft player by night.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Has your WoW experience helped improve your experience and your job?

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
That's a really good question.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Probably not as much as this show has complimented my job, believe it or not.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:35.000
You know, think about it. In my day job, I have to get in front of a group of people and talk about, you know, subjects for, you know, seven and a half hours a day at some points.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:39.000
And, you know, we do a very similar thing on this show in some ways.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:47.000
I taught customer contact center for a long time where we had to, you know, explain to people how to answer the phone and you never know what could be on the other side.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Guess what I do at the end of the show that will be coming up later?

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Answer phone calls and you never know what might be on the other side and kind of having to deal with that.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Not that we necessarily get irate callers on this show and that's not an invitation.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:04.000
But, you know, some of those skills do kind of complement each other a bit.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:18.000
After seven years of working in customer service where five of it was spent dealing with purely irate customers, I am much better dealing with people in an audio situation than I am looking at them.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:24.000
You know, I can tell practically anything from a tone of voice than how their body language is acting.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:33.000
So, and I think in some cases being able to infer from voice inflection is a rarer skill.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Now, here's something else. In my career, I've aspired to get into management.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
You know, you want to move up the corporate ladder.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.000
I'm sorry.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Well, shut up because I would actually like to train other trainers and I'd like to manage a department of trainers because at the end of the day, I want to have a more positive impact on how people learn.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Because, you know, I like to think I'm pretty good at what I do and I want to, you know, manage other people to kind of do it very similarly.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:05.000
And I have applied for management positions, you know, at various places in my own company and so forth.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:10.000
And usually I get turned down, which is rejection is something we have to face in life, right?

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:14.000
I get turned down because I don't have enough management experience.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
And in a way, it kind of ticks me off.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Well, I shouldn't say it ticks me off, but it's disappointing because I've been managing this show in a way, in a way, right, for 11, 12 years.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:36.000
A lot of that experience I have in World of Warcraft, I mean, I realize I can't put that on a resume, but it's kind of irritating that people don't necessarily look at that.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Like, yes, I do know how to quell dramatic situations and I know how to handle angry people and I know how to talk to people when people are performing badly.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:47.000
You have to do all of that stuff in World of Warcraft.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:51.000
So what this guy says in a way does kind of strike home.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Maybe we should give more credit to that than we are.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Not that I think I should get a job merely because of that. There's other things I can do, too, and I'm working on it.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:06.000
But I don't think you should discount some of my other things just because they're tied to video games.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Any other thoughts, guys, before we move on?

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Thank you. You summed it up.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Which, by the way, no desire to be management.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Well, that's you.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:23.000
All right. SSJ 100 Matt in our chat room says,

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Here's a fact and I'm going out on a limb and I don't want to speak for the host, but I can say that you guys, Rob, Jamie, Loki, learned more people and speech skills from just doing this show more than any class could teach you.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:40.000
In many ways, yes. I can't speak for my co-host, but yeah, in a lot of ways.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Has this show benefited speech elements of your life?

01:55:47.000 --> 01:56:00.000
I think that I've learned how to control vocal inflection a bit better rather than go all out, I guess. I mean, yeah, it's helped. It's constant practice.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Loki?

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.000
I don't know. I guess.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:11.000
It's hard to tell where I pick up things. I don't know.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:19.000
All right. Then again, I've been doing speech a long time. A little known fact, I won a speech contest when I was 17, a pretty big one.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:25.000
And yeah, you know, I just I like talking. That should be obvious, right?

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:29.000
All right. Let's move on with some other video game news. Dark Saga.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:33.000
In other news, see, I just controlled my vocal inflection.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:43.000
There is a game out in Japan. It's a browser game that's too hard for children and everyone else.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:54.000
It's a Disney game. It's a Disney Winnie the Pooh browser game, and it's been making children cry in Japan. Poor Japanese kids.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:55.000
I'm laughing, but that's sad.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:00.000
So basically, it's a game where Pooh tries to hit pitches in baseball.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.000
You have to aim the bat with a mouse and click to swing.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:09.000
But it has to be perfect timing for a home run, which is the only kind that counts.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:14.000
And it's making children cry and also keeping my baseball soup super big in Japan.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.000
So Winnie the Pooh in baseball making children cry.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Some folks in the chat room have been saying, I've been playing this.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Ross Steel UT says, Bravo, Disney. Now, now.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:33.000
So maybe these developers didn't keep their audience in mind when they were developing the game.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:39.000
I don't know. Or maybe they're just rougher on their kids in other countries. Who knows?

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:46.000
All right. Well, America McGee has turned to Kickstarter to go ahead and fund his next project.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:53.000
A Kaniero Demon Hunters, which is sort of based off of Little Red Riding Hood,

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:58.000
but with, I guess, a Japanese mythology slant or something to it.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:03.000
It could be from the fact that Alice Madam's Returns kind of flopped.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Maybe. No one wants to fund his game anymore.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:10.000
But he's looking for $200,000 right now on Kickstarter for it.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:19.000
And it's expected to be kind of ported to a bunch of different platforms, including Android, iOS, PC, Mac.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
And they're seeing cross platform support.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:28.000
And of course, also the stretch goals include Linux because that's always a stretch goal for some reason.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:35.000
And right now they've got about 26 days to go and they're only $33,000 into it.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
It doesn't seem like a big response yet.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:44.000
The game looks pretty. It's kind of like a, I don't know, interesting art style, I guess.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Not something I would back probably, but it looks neat.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
But a lot of that would be concept stuff, right?

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Because how much of the work has actually been done if they're on Kickstarter?

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Well, I mean, I don't know. Maybe.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:03.000
I'm not sure really what he's looking for money for.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:07.000
I'd have to watch the video, but I'm not going to.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Let's see. Why is he kickstarting this?

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:16.000
It says it's been developing since mid 2011.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:22.000
And apparently they have had a closed beta running since this November or November 2012.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:28.000
That's a great question. Why are they kickstarting it?

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:32.000
What is, I mean, it goes to ask that question. What's Kickstarter really for?

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
You're not really. Oh, here we go.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
Or are you kickstarting the distribution?

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
No, no, no. Here's why we need backing.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:44.000
We need to reach $200,000 to support our current team of developers in realizing the most complete version of the game.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
That's very vague.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:53.000
So they need $200,000 to do what?

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:56.000
So basically it says the backing will guarantee the following.

01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:04.000
It's Android, iOS tablet versions, co-op multiplayer, equipment crafting system, and improved community support.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:11.000
And then I guess also karma void dungeons, lockboxes, and a bunch of miscellaneous shit.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:16.000
So it sounds like it's just they ran out of money for this.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:22.000
And it looks like, judging by the description here, that it's going to be a free to play game.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:25.000
So they're going to offer free and then they're going to have DLC.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Kind of like you would expect on like iOS and stuff.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.000
So, I don't know.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Sag in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:38.000
The money certainly seems to be for finishing, but maybe also marketing?

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:41.000
It's weird. So they want finishing round of funding.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:47.000
I would think if that's the case and the game's already practically done,

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.000
it's coming out whether they meet their goal or not.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:54.000
They just want the money to be able to market it and distribute it maybe a little more efficiently.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Or to a wider potential audience. It's an investment.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Well they're trying to get it on Steam Greenlight because that's one of the things that they have on there.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
I don't know. It's just...

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:17.000
I'm kind of like, it's almost to me like his name is meaningless because Alice was so good

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:21.000
and then everything else that's come after that hasn't been as good.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:26.000
And so it's just kind of like, do we really trust American McGee?

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
I don't know.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:35.000
Although Bad Day LA looked hilarious, but apparently it was not very good.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Alright. I'm going to try very hard not to butcher the details of this next story,

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:46.000
but this is kind of a follow up to a very difficult subject we talked about a couple weeks ago.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:54.000
On this show we had a pretty in-depth conversation after the Newtown massacre that happened.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:02:00.000
You know, that horrible, horrible, sick shooting that happened at the elementary school back east.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.000
And I warned you guys. They're coming for the video games.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Well, here it is. Here it is.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:10.000
And I warned you. Here it is.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Running around the game blogs this week.

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:17.000
A January 12th event being organized by Southington.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:21.000
This town is about 30 miles from where the tragedy took place.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Southington SOS.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:28.000
It's a collection of representatives from the Connecticut town's organizations like YMCA,

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Board of Education, Fire Department, United Way, Clergy, Chamber of Commerce, etc.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:39.000
They are going to be encouraging people to turn in violent video games.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:45.000
And then they are going to destroy them and they're going to burn them.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Just like communities did in the past to Dixie Chicks albums.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:56.000
And I'm sure books and movies and porn.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:00.000
And a series of fine art in Renaissance Italy.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Witches. Absolutely.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
From the organization.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:12.000
There are youngsters who appear to be consumed with violent video games.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:21.000
This is a quote from an interview with Polygon Joe Arardi from Southington School Superintendent.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:25.000
There are youngsters who appear to be consumed with violent video games.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
I'm not certain if that's a good thing.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:31.000
If this encourages one courageous conversation with a parent and their child, this is a success.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:36.000
We're suggesting that for parents who have a child or children who play violent video games

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
to first of all view the games.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:42.000
We're asking parents to better understand what their child is doing.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Have a conversation about next steps.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:48.000
If parents are comfortable with their child's gaming habits, we're comfortable.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:54.000
If they decide you're not so comfortable, you can go to the local drive-in movie theater on January 12th.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:04:01.000
Turn in the games for a $25 gift voucher for a local water park or other local forms of entertainment.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:06.000
Let's go see an R-rated movie with that $25 voucher.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
Let's go see Django Unchained.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:12.000
That'll be a good family film we could go check out.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Let's go see Les Mis. Watch all those people die.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:30.000
Once those items are turned in, the discs will be snapped, tossed into a town dumpster, and likely burned.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Now, another further statement from the organization.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:42.000
The group's action is not intended to be construed as statement declaring that violent video games were the cause of the shocking violence in Newtown.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Too late.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:50.000
Rather, we're saying that there is ample evidence that violent video games along with violent media of all kinds,

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:55.000
including TV and movies portraying story after story, showing a continuous stream of violence and killing,

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:59.000
has contributed to increasing aggressiveness, fear, anxiety,

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:03.000
and is desensitizing our children to acts of violence, including bullying.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Social and political commentators, as well as elected officials, including the president,

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:16.000
are attributing violent crime to many factors, including inadequate gun control laws, a culture of violence, and recreational culture of violence.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:23.000
So what I'm hearing with this, how do we respond to the violence and killing and the increasing aggressiveness?

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:24.000
How do we respond?

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:29.000
We're going to get the angry mod to snap this shit in half and set it on fire.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
That's not aggressive.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Well, you know, you know, Rob, fear leads to anger, and anger leads to hate, and hate leads to suffering.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:37.000
Just saying.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:49.000
But, you know, once again, the integral part of their plan is that they want parents to be responsible for their children,

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:53.000
which is never going to fucking happen, because it's just unfortunately nowadays,

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:59.000
they obviously don't want to blame the poor parenting for any of this violence,

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:06.000
but because it was the parent that was supposed to view those games and figure out if it was appropriate for their child,

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:11.000
and they failed to do that because they're parents and they don't want to take responsibility for their own actions.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:15.000
It's like a contradiction. It's like, we want you to take responsibility for this stuff,

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:22.000
but at the same time we're going to blame, you know, whatever on these video games instead of taking responsibility for this stuff.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:26.000
I'm sure it's no surprise. Our chatters are lit up on this topic here.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:30.000
Dark Tetsuya says, so why is the bonfire just focusing on video games?

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:35.000
And is anybody thinking about the poor air quality that we're going to get from burning all this, like, plastic?

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
I mean, that's got to be bad for the children.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:40.000
What if January 12th is a winner's spare the air day?

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Then what?

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:51.000
What happens if that crazy, you know, toxic fumes coming from the dump or, you know, whatever causes a child to get enraged and murder somebody?

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Then what? Then what are we going to do?

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Uh, let's see.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:02.000
Uh, DKB says they should just pretend to burn them and then take them all down to GameStop for some money.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Well, that would be a good idea for a fundraiser.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Well, burn the GameStop. There's all the evil games in there.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:10.000
That's like going through the, I don't know.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Ross Steel UT says, in cases like this, I'm thankful the Supreme Court ruled against Leland Yee.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:24.000
Tiger Claw says, oftentimes it's the older brother who buys the game that the younger kid gets exposed to, so it's not the parents at fault.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Oh, of course not. It's not the parents at all letting the child, you know, letting the older brother buy the game for, you know, the younger kid.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:35.000
Um, they could ask the younger kid, okay, where'd you get the game?

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Oh, my brother bought it for me.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:41.000
Okay, then they deal with the older brother and they scold both, you know, kids.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:48.000
It's still fucking, oh, well, I didn't know the older brother was giving, you know, ecstasy to my child.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:52.000
I guess I'm not at fault that, you know, he's all drugged out.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Oh, it's not my fault that, you know, he's, he's an alcoholic now because his older brother bought him booze.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:02.000
I'm the victim here. I have to raise an alcoholic son now.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:05.000
You may be interested in an interesting follow-up.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:15.000
In another article that Polygon did later in the week, Christopher J. Ferguson, who is the chairman of the Texas A&M International University Department of Psychology and Communications said,

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:20.000
Don't get me wrong. I am fully aware you are trying to do what you think is best.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:36.000
But there is real risk in focusing people's attention on the wrong thing, as well as contributing to historical patterns of mortal panic that tend to surround new media, often despite evidence media is not harmful, even if it may be offensive.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Thoughts?

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:52.000
Well, yeah, I mean, it's, it's classic moral panic. Whenever we have traumatic events like this historically going all the way back to the Greeks, people tend to blame the media.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:58.000
It makes us feel like we know what happened and that we can fix it. It's very easy to really focus on the media as a boogeyman.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Witch hunting. That's all it is.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:06.000
Really, at the end of the day, we just have to blame Fox News for, you know, all this anyways, because who would have gotten who?

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Don't tell me that these people are actually smart enough to come up with ideas on their own.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:14.000
They heard Fox's. Oh, my God, those video games. Oh, my God. They are violent.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:20.000
They are causing murderers. Why aren't we doing anything about this evil, evil non-Christian thing?

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:25.000
I mean, I'm sorry. It's just.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
Mob mentality, I guess some further quotes.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Oh, go ahead. If I may say there's a one name in history that should totally illustrate the point McCarthy.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:39.000
Funny you bring that up. Let me read one more quote from the follow up.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:43.000
If you're going to have a conversation now, I'd be careful about how you broach it.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Make it clear that you understand that video games don't contribute to mass shootings. Make it clear that you're not indulging in this moral panic.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:10:01.000
Speaking about the 50s, back then, they had psychiatrists going before Congress saying comics not only caused not only excuse me,

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:08.000
going before Congress saying comics cause not only delinquency, but homosexuality.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:15.000
I know Superman totally made me gay. We kind of look back on these things and sort of giggle and go,

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:20.000
oh, my God, I can't believe people back in the 50s thought comic books were making killers and that kind of stuff.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:25.000
But then we don't learn from it. Whenever new media comes out, we all freak out about that one, too.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:29.000
I can't believe that black people couldn't marry white people. That's so silly.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:38.000
You can't marry gays. I got nothing.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:48.000
Yeah, it's. Look, just it really is people not paying attention to what's not in front of them, you know,

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:54.000
and this is this is actually I'd say a very deep downfall of human nature.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:59.000
You know, we have phrases out there about learning from history so you don't repeat it.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:03.000
But people really don't learn from history. People don't like to think outside of their box.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:07.000
They want something to distract them from the troubles going on around them.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:13.000
So they like, oh, well, so and so has mental health issues. We have this going on.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:16.000
We have that going on. Let's blame games. It's easy.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Here's the thing. Here's my opinion. If you want to snap your disks in half and set it on fire, that's fine.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:28.000
That's your prerogative. And the parents, as the ones who probably bought that disk for their kids, have every right to do so.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:32.000
But in my opinion, don't do it because of a panic going on in society.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Do it because your kids aren't doing their homework. That's why you snap the disks and set them on fire.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:43.000
You don't do it because, you know, or let's be smart here.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:49.000
At least if you're going to, you know, do that stuff, do trade them in and sell them or something and get some money back or something.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:52.000
I mean, a voucher to a water park. Cool.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:57.000
If, you know, if your games are worth more than twenty five dollars and, you know, you should probably take them somewhere, at least trade them in.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:00.000
At least be some somewhat smart about if you're going to get rid of it.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:05.000
You don't like, you know, if you think your car is evil, you don't drive it off a cliff.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:10.000
OK, you would think, OK, if this car is not very good, I'm just going to go ahead and sell it to a dealership or something.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
You've never driven Christine.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:16.000
Yeah, well, Christine doesn't. You don't drive Christine. Christine drives you.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:22.000
But well, I mean, the thing is to also now let's take a look at something outside the box.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:26.000
They're creating more litter by burning plastic items.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:33.000
They're releasing fumes into the air. So they're actually creating a health and safety hazard with their little witch hunt.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:38.000
To be fair, they said it would be likely incinerated. They may not actually do it.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:43.000
They may just compact it into a little cube. Who knows? Does it really change anything?

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Would it be a game cube?

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:50.000
It's still mob mentality and it's what gets people hurt in the long run.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:58.000
You're promoting violence on this show because I'm about ready to jump over this fucking table and strangle you for that joke.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:03.000
In happier news, let's get to the mailbag.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Every week you guys send us e-mails with some insight. We'll probably get some e-mails on that topic next week.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:14.000
And I invite you to respond via e-mail. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Dark Sakura is going to open up the mailbag. Dive in head first and read some e-mails here on air.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Dark Sakura, what are the e-mails this week?

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:28.000
Yeah, we have two. Just two.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:33.000
The first one is from Nasty Canasta.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:38.000
OLR Crew, hang onto your asses because I'm putting you on the spot with a question.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:43.000
What is an unpopular opinion you have for a video game?

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:51.000
I don't know. I don't really care if my opinion is unpopular, so I don't know.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:54.000
Does that make sense?

02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:00.000
An unpopular opinion you have on games.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:04.000
Pokemon's kind of repetitive, guys.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Yet you guys are all really into it. It's been the same thing for how long. It's kind of repetitive.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Just saying.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Chrono Trigger was also not the best Super Nintendo game. That's my opinion.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:19.000
I hate Kaiden.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:24.000
Also contributing to the violence on this program.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:31.000
I guess that would be mine. I don't think that Kaiden is a very good love interest for Fem Shop.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:36.000
I'm not sure that's a hugely popular opinion in the first place, but that's fine.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:40.000
How about Excite Truck was the best launch game for the Wii?

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:43.000
It's pretty good.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
More email of this one.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:49.000
My scandalous claim is I did not enjoy Chrono Trigger.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:55.000
I bought the DS version when it was on sale for $10 new and restarted about four times because other games caught my attention.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:00.000
On my final restart, I put in an honest effort to see what made the game so good.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Though once I reached the era where you first visit the floating continent, around 20 hours in, I lost interest.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Dude, that's the best part of the game. You're about to go to the undersea palace.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:15.000
Now, to be fair, as much as you might think I'm high-fiving this guy, I didn't say Chrono Trigger was a bad game.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:18.000
I said it's not the best game. In fact, it's not really in my top five.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:21.000
But it would definitely be in my top ten.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
Twenty. Top twenty.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:33.000
The battle system had its interesting points, but I did not see what the hubbub was about with the story.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Sorry to all you fanboys and fangirls out there.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:39.000
To this day, the RPGs that's near and dear to me is Final Fantasy IX.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:46.000
I just love everything about that game. However, I'm looking forward to the inevitable and hopefully 3D remake of Final Fantasy VI on 3DS.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:52.000
In the meantime, I should get back to my DS backlog to play the Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy IV.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:55.000
Garris! Yes. The nasty Canasta.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
Last email.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.000
Hey, it's Chris109. I like this show.

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:06.000
Oh yeah, update PSP site. I still use it. I guess.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
Not gonna happen.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
Well, I mean, I'm talking about the grammar.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:14.000
But my favorite game of 2012 is PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:18.000
And my disappointing game is Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Okay. Thank you for sharing.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
There's no why!

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Yeah, we want to know why.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
I'll tell you what this emailer did do, though.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:34.000
Totally remind me of an unpopular gaming opinion.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Y'all ready? Y'all ready? Y'all ready?

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
Watch. Watch what I'm about to say.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
And you fuckin' come at me, bro.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Ocarina of Time?

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
Ain't all that.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
I fuckin' said it. Yeah, I did. Yeah, I did.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Yeah, I did. Come at me.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Majora's Mask. Not fun.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
My favorite 3D Zelda game?

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:53.000
Wind Waker.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
Link to the Past. Superior in every way.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
Bring it.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Well, now that we just had, like, 50 people unsubscribe from the show,

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
thanks for the emails, guys!

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:19.000
In a related topic, let's get to the FUs of the week, shall we?

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:23.000
I can just see people, like, listening to this show at their work,

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
sitting at their desk, going, WHAT?

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:29.000
Now we're gonna have an angry mob coming after us.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:48.000
Fuck people. Just seriously.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
You know... I'll try.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
No one likes being trolled.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:57.000
No one likes being pushed.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:00.000
And if someone has stated that they don't like something,

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
don't fucking rub it in.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:06.000
I'm not gonna go on Facebook anymore. I'm done with it. I'm done with people.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:09.000
There's all the more reason for me to just stay in my room

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:13.000
and not look at people or talk to them or anything.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
I don't get people anymore.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
We should cut Facebook in half and throw in a dumpster, honestly.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Seriously. Loki.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:23.000
But that would be throwing books away.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
And not our community.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:28.000
So would you throw books away and save face?

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:34.000
No, you use the papers by your starter for the future.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Only when it's a safe day to burn, though.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
Always check the burn.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:41.000
Loki.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:44.000
I guess I view the fact that game making is hard.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
Are you making a game, Loki?

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
No, I'm not making a game.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
I don't know if I have an FU of the week.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:55.000
For the most part, things are going pretty well.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:00.000
I guess I view the fact that the holidays are now totally, truly over

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:03.000
and so traffic will be bad once again tomorrow.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
And that when it rains, nobody knows how to drive.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:08.000
Come on, people. It's been raining since the dawn of time.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
We should know how to drive in it by now.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Seriously. Stop it.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
That's it for the FUs of the week.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:20.000
Let's do a couple more news stories and then we will start taking your calls

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
at 1-877-GAME-OLR

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
or you can call us via Skype.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to call us there.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
But first, two more stories. Loki?

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:34.000
There was some concept art that came out for an unpublished hero title

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
from Activision, of course.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:39.000
Sing Hero, which was, I believe, one of the trademarks

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:43.000
that they had filed a while back, in 2009 it looks like.

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:48.000
And of course, you know, that never happened because...

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
I don't know.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Maybe karaoke games weren't just that popular.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:58.000
You are absolutely right. I remember reporting on those trademarks

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:01.000
and Sing Hero was one of them because we all theorized about

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:04.000
what Activision's Karaoke Revolution ripoff would look like.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
So this really isn't a surprise.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:09.000
Yeah, and they have, you know, the concept art

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
and it looks like they've got...

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:16.000
I don't know, a bunch of cliche-looking characters in there.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:21.000
The artist that looks like she's wearing lingerie

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:24.000
and the teen queen who looks like she's Kelly Clarkson

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:27.000
and the rocker who looks like she shops at...

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Kelly Clarkson's like 30 now, though.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:31.000
Well...

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:34.000
But I guess this game was a few years old.

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
It's just very...

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
okay, I guess.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Alrighty. Well, I got a story.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
Try not to get too upset, you guys.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:46.000
I know you guys are big fans.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Although, I have to say...

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:49.000
Oh, never mind.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
Sorry, real quick, real quick. I just want to comment.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:56.000
The showman that they have on there kind of looks like Captain Jack.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
You know, minus the hat.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:01.000
It looks like a very, you know...

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:04.000
Maybe that or M. Bison. I can't really...

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
I may be confusing those.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
Go! Left, go, right, go, pick up track.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:09.000
Left, go, right, go, yay.

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Alright.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:13.000
Try not to get too upset at this last story tonight, everybody.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:14.000
Get your Kleenexes out.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:17.000
This is going to be sadder than Les Mis, y'all.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:20.000
Zynga is pulling the plug on 11 of their games.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:21.000
That's right.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:24.000
The plug is being pulled on such games like Petville,

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Indiana Jones Adventure World,

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
and Mafia Wars 2.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:29.000
That one's actually kind of surprising.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
I thought Mafia Wars was a big deal.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:34.000
But they are being pulled from various phone app stores.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:35.000
They're being shut down.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
No longer accepting new players.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Also, a lot of games from Zynga Japan.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Because, as you know, they were closed.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:45.000
So, if you were a big fan of Machi Suku,

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:48.000
or Moji Tomo, Montopia.

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
You know what Montopia is?

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:51.000
No, what is it?

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:52.000
It's a Pokemon ripoff.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Poor Zynga.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Oh yes, poor Zynga and their ripoff games.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
Wait, you mean...

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
You mean copy doesn't pay?

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Hey, don't copy that.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
Don't copy that floppy Zynga.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Copy kills music.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
1877 game OLR,

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
or our username is orangelaundryo on Skype.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:18.000
The Skype line is open now if you want to give us a call.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:21.000
Meanwhile, I will turn to Loki for last minute stories.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Although, I'm not expecting he has a lot tonight.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:27.000
There's some information about Valve's Steam PC.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
It's supposed to be coming out in 2013,

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
running on Linux as we kind of all figured.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:38.000
I guess it's being reported from this German IT site, Gollum.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:43.000
And one of the Valve engineers told an audience in Germany about this thing.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:49.000
And I guess it's going to be revealed either at GDC or E3.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
I would be surprised if it...

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
GDC makes sense.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:58.000
I was kind of hoping it would be next week during CES.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
Let's get to the phones. We got a call coming in.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio. Who's this?

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
Hello there, yo, OLR.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
This is that one, AK Ripper from Sweden.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
I haven't called you for like...

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
Oh, a few years.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
I have fucking missed you.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
I am so glad you are back, AK Ripper.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Good evening!

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
Of sorts.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
What is on your mind, my friend? Long time.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
Yeah, long time no see.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Or here. Whatever.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
What's up?

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
Well, good question. Of sorts.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
I usually...

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:37.000
Well, you already did your game of the year things. Of sorts.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:40.000
And I haven't done any, so what the hell?

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:43.000
Well, mostly because, well, what?

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:49.000
How many games do I actually play that I can count that I thought was good this year?

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
Usually, I have to cut a few.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:54.000
And I could cut a few fingers.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:59.000
And it's like, well, I'm still having trouble to come up with a few.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
So, what the hell?

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
You know, you're not the only one that feels that way.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:10.000
There was some game outlet, and I can't remember who, and I don't remember if it was an indie or a major, and I apologize.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:13.000
But they did not name Journey their game of the year.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
They did not name Walking Dead their game of the year.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
Or any of that other stuff.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
Their game of the year was nothing.

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:22.000
There was nothing out this year that deserved to be called game of the year.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:28.000
I thought that was a pretty ballsy thing to do, although it might have just been to get more hits and to get people like me to talk about it on their shows.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:32.000
But they said, there is no game of the year.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
Is that the camp you think you're in?

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
But...

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:42.000
But, well, sort of, in some way.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
Because, well, here's the thing, though.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:51.000
In a way, though, in a way you actually, what was it, someone said, gamelet, whatever.

02:24:51.000 --> 02:25:01.000
They said, well, the year can sort of be told as like a few minor, huge disappointments of sorts.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Which, in a way, though, I would say that one of them was really a disappointment.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:13.000
The other one, though, after all, in a way, not so much.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
Amy 3.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:21.000
Well, tell me already, what would you say was definitely a disappointment?

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
Diablo 3.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
Oh, god, yes. I'm with you there.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:28.000
But, no, not that, but really.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Diablo 3. Really. What the fucking hell?

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:36.000
What the fucking hell? I agree with you there. That's exactly what I said.

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:44.000
Now, the rage has already been passed on that, but we're just gonna say that, yes, it was a major, major disappointment.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:50.000
In a way, sort of like, well, I have this big, fancy box of sorts, but I'm never gonna play you anyway.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:56.000
Because, well, I only play it for a story, which means that, well, I'm gonna play you once, and then it was fun of sorts.

02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:07.000
But, yeah, well, now what? Grind, like, a few hours for, like, a few, actually, game days?

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
Fucking hell, no.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:14.000
That's what the internet said when they heard there was no LAN play in Diablo 3. What the fucking hell?

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
That is exactly what the internet said.

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:26.000
But, also, maybe it would be fun of sorts if I did have any friends to play it with, but since I don't, um, yeah.

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Okay, ripper. Okay, ripper. I know you've got friends. I know you've got friends. You've got friends here at the OLR.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Oh, well, not in the, but I didn't look that, oh, well, not in the, um, okay, well, aha, I mean, not that way, but, well, I wasn't looking for a sort, but I have fun! Whatever.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:27:05.000
Anyway, what the hell was a minor disappointment, too? Once again, though, ME3 of sorts, but then, in a way, they have quasi-repaired it of sorts since that extended cut of sorts.

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:16.000
And the DLC that's been released so far has been like, thank you, you should have said that, like, from the beginning, you fucks. Thank you.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:25.000
The, you know what, with all the, the problem with Mass Effect 3 is that that game got dragged over the coals by the internet for the ending.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:35.000
I mean, you would have thought they shot the pope. You would have thought BioWare shot the pope the way people reacted to the ending of that game, and it's like, it wasn't that bad.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:46.000
And it's like, thank god, Square Enix, Square Enix should be thanking base god every day that the internet did not exist when Final Fantasy VII came out.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Because if Final Fantasy VII had had the internet the way, the way the internet exists today, can you imagine, they would have had to do Final Fantasy VII Part 2 just to fix the ending, I mean, in the fuckery in Final Fantasy VII's ending.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Let's be real. Final Fantasy VII, people look back and say, it's one of the best games of all time. The ending is fucking garbage. Is that an unpopular game opinion, DarkSakura? The ending of Final Fantasy VII is fucking garbage?

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:18.000
What had the worst ending? Mass Effect 3's original cut, which I know you've seen on YouTube, or Final Fantasy VII?

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:19.000
Final Fantasy VII.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:20.000
Thank you.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:23.000
Except, you know what the most disappointing part of that was?

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Aerith's size opening.

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:28.000
Sorry, AK Ripper, I just...

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:48.000
Oh, well, other than that though, I got nothing of sorts. It's more like, hi, I'm still a hi, I do exist actually, and for some strange reason, I decided to reuptake of sorts my activities on Monday, what is it, Monday mornings, actually.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Because, well, you have your show on Monday morning, in this time.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:03.000
That's right, over there in Sweden. Well, AK Ripper, I'm tickled pink that you called into the show tonight, so don't be a stranger.

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
No, no, no, we won't.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:09.000
Oh, well, but, the hardest, as we say around these parts.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:13.000
Alright, take care my friend, bye bye.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:14.000
Yeah, later.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:20.000
You know, I need to plan a trip to Sweden, not only will I visit my friend AK Ripper, but the ABBA museum is opening this year.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:23.000
I'm just saying, girl, I'm just saying.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:31.000
1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you would like to give us a call. Did you have other last minute stories?

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:32.000
No.

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:37.000
Okay, I do have some Twitter topics. Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send some Twitter topics.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:44.000
Which, looks like Tigerclaw is the only one remembering to send these, but maybe I'm not plugging in enough in the show, I don't know.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:49.000
But he does send us a couple of news stories. One of them I want to read here.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Majesco Boston has closed. Oh, how did we look over that? That is unfortunate.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Yeah, Majesco Boston did close. This was a senior producer in a Facebook update. It said, I enjoyed my time at Majesco.

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:07.000
I hate that it ended so abruptly with the whole studio closing, but that's the way the industry is.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:11.000
Anybody need a design director? Sorry to hear about that.

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
They have to hire me first.

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:16.000
During the holidays. Bastards.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
Uh, Rama, who else would it be?

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Hey, Rama, how you doing?

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
I'm doing good, how about you?

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:29.000
Good! Were you convention going this weekend? Were you at the, uh, what was it? MagFest?

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:35.000
Do not get me started on MagFest. I was supposed to go, but I didn't go.

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:38.000
Ooh, you sound a little ruffled. Alright, I will not go there.

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:48.000
Ruffle does not mean to describe, and if you've been following my private journal and so forth, you can kind of see posts in regards to why.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:51.000
But if it's your private journal, how am I supposed to follow it? It's private.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:54.000
But you're on the list. You're in the inner circle.

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:57.000
Oh, okay. Oh, I'm special. Yay.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:31:00.000
So what you calling about tonight?

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:04.000
I just want to say that, um, Zelda 2 is the best Zelda game of all time.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
Blasphemy!

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:09.000
Blasphemy nothing. It was an awesome side-scroller for what it was.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
You and my husband agree.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:17.000
Zelda 2 was pretty awesome. And part of the fact that it's awesome is that it's, like, hard as hell.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:22.000
So, like, if you beat that game when you were, like, nine or ten years old, you're rad.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Hey, you want to know the main reason why Zelda 2 is the best one?

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:26.000
What?

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
You have a jump button.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:34.000
Zing. But, I'm sorry, Link to the Past. All the way. Link to the Past.

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
See, that gets to number two in my book.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:39.000
Ah. Zelda 2 is pretty good, though. Don't get me wrong.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:46.000
And I don't, as before everybody sends in all the hate mail, again, I'm not calling Ocarina of Time a bad game, necessarily.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:50.000
But just the wank on the internet about that game.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:55.000
I don't know. Maybe I'm just old. I'm old and I don't get it. I'm out of tune.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:32:00.000
But I think Zelda Link to the Past was just an amazing gaming experience, start to finish.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:04.000
Oh, it is. But you know what? I'm an anime fandom. I'm getting old.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
And I don't understand what the hell is going on there, either.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:10.000
I just show up, take pictures, go back to the room, and party, and that's it.

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:14.000
What cons are on your calendar for 2013?

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:19.000
Well, this weekend we have Katori Cons, a small convention on a college campus.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:23.000
And I think we are on break till PAX East.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:28.000
PAX East would be fun. But I don't do traveling right now.

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:32.000
I'm hoping I can do PAX East. We'll see. I heard the media reg opened up, so I'll let you know.

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:38.000
You know, they have a local convention here in Sacramento, SacAnime, and it's been blowing up.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
They are finally officially in the Sacramento Convention Center.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
They had something like 5,000 people this weekend.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:46.000
That's good. One of my friends, Kyle Hebert, he was there as a guest.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
Oh, very nice. Very cool.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:55.000
Sadly, we didn't go. You know, originally I had been scheduled to volunteer.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:58.000
But then some things changed, and I didn't end up getting to do that.

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:02.000
And it was my anniversary Friday anyway, so it kind of didn't end up working out.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:07.000
Wow. Well, I hope to see you at PAX East.

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:10.000
But if not, maybe I can convince you to come to Fanime. Maybe.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
Well, I can't because I'll be going to Animazement.

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:19.000
Because a friend of mine, she's retiring from cosplay, a complete Sailor Moon troop.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:22.000
I'm showing up as Human Artemis, so yeah.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:25.000
Alright, alright. What about Dragon Con?

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:31.000
Because I have not been asked, I've been told I'm going to Dragon Con.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:36.000
Well, if none of my peeps are going to AWA, which is at the end of the month in Atlanta,

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
I may just show up at Dragon Con.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
Make it happen, bro.

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:44.000
We'll see what we can do. We'll have to play the boys are back in town.

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:50.000
Before I let you go, anything to plug on Anime Jam Session coming up?

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
On your show that's on Tuesdays here at VOG.

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:57.000
No, not yet, but I didn't know I was going so long because I have an awesome gaming story to tell you.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:58.000
Oh!

02:33:58.000 --> 02:33:59.000
From what's going on in my family.

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:00.000
Please, go ahead.

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:05.000
Okay, now my sister, she has a baby girl, and they were playing Kingdom Hearts together,

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:10.000
so she gave my niece a controller that's not working so she can help fight the Heartless.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:12.000
Okay.

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:17.000
So after one of the battles was finished, my sister told her that they need to fight a few more

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
so they can get more money to buy new armor.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:25.000
So my niece went, oh right, she jumps up, ran to the kitchen where my sister heard something rummaging.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:31.000
My niece comes back and dumps down a fistful of coins on her lap with a smile and says,

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
let's go buy some more armors, mommy.

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
That is adorable.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:37.000
Yes.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
And this kid is only two and a half.

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
Potential future gamer?

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
Oh, you got that right.

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:47.000
Well said, well said.

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:48.000
Well said.

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:51.000
All right, well Rama, I should probably let you go so we can try to get one more call,

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
but thank you very much for the call tonight.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:54.000
Anytime.

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:55.000
All right, take care, buddy.

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:56.000
Later.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:02.000
Lata 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to give us a call.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:07.000
Checking the Twitters real quick for one more Twitter topic, because I know TigerClaud sent us something else.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:14.000
Ed, the FTC orders Google to stop charging high royalties on FRAND-related patents.

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:22.000
There was a lot in the news this week about Google and so forth and antitrust decisions and all this stuff.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:28.000
The FTC issued a consent order this week forbidding Google from charging a lot of money

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:34.000
for certain critical patents it gained when it bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion in May 2012.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:38.000
Good news for Apple and Microsoft, but particularly for Microsoft,

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:47.000
because Motorola Mobility wanted to charge $4 billion a year in royalties for patents Motorola holds on Wi-Fi and video technology.

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:49.000
Let's go to the phones.

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:50.000
We've got more calls coming in.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:51.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:52.000
Who's this?

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
I'm Stoke Broken Chat.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:55.000
Hey, what is up?

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
And we even see video, a video caller.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:58.000
Good job.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:35:59.000
Hey, how you doing?

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:00.000
Good.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:04.000
Sorry we don't have our webcam up, but what is on your mind, my friend?

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:05.000
Nothing.

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
This is the first time I've actually listened live.

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:08.000
I usually listen to it as a podcast.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:09.000
Yeah?

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:12.000
Yeah, it's a different experience watching the chat go by.

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Yeah, it's like having that live commentary track we were talking about earlier.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
You get to have that happening.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:19.000
Yeah.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:24.000
So what has been most different about listening live?

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
Just having the chatters or?

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:32.000
Well, the fact that I was listening live and then you picked up right away and I was confused what was going on.

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
It's a little weird at first.

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:35.000
That's how it works.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:36.000
That's how it works.

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:37.000
There's not a big delay, but it's there.

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
Well, what are you doing in gaming these days?

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:43.000
What kind of video games do you play?

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
I typically am a...

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:48.000
I've been switching from console gaming to PC gaming.

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:49.000
It's...

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:56.000
I don't know why I'll even buy, like, when we have a big Steam sale, I'll buy a lot of Steam games and then...

02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:00.000
Even if I've already played them and beat them on Xbox, I don't know what I've been doing.

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:04.000
I was just going to say, Steam probably made you a PC gamer.

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:05.000
Yeah.

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
And a lot of the deals that you get on Steam.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
So, did you get suckered in this last holiday sale?

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Oh, God, yeah.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
Well, what'd you get?

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Well, I got both the Hummel THQ bundle, the Hummel Indie bundle, and then, like, ten other games on Steam.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:21.000
Oh, boy.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:22.000
Haven't even played most of them.

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
You're a PC gamer now.

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:27.000
Those consoles will be collecting dust.

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
But, you know, this is a big year.

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:36.000
We might have a new Xbox out this year, so do you think the consoles might bring you back if we get, you know, a fancy new Xbox or what have you?

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:40.000
Oh, of course, because I'm not spending that much money to upgrade my PC again.

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:44.000
But you dropped $400 on the new Xbox?

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:45.000
Of course.

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
Nice.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:52.000
So, what kind of console games do you play?

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
Pretty much anything.

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:57.000
I nerded out for, like, two weeks on Far Cry 3.

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
That's been getting a lot of good feedback.

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:00.000
Love it.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
What is it about Far Cry 3 you enjoy?

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
I think, Loki, you're a fan of Far Cry as well, right?

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:05.000
I got bored of it.

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:06.000
You got bored of it?

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:07.000
Yeah.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:08.000
Oh.

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:09.000
Let me go back.

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
What was Loki doing wrong?

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:15.000
You weren't placing mines in front of boars and making them run towards you.

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
I was not doing that.

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
I should be doing that.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
Maybe next time.

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:23.000
Yeah.

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
Or killing tigers with bow and arrow.

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:28.000
That was the worst, worst mission ever.

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:32.000
What game are you most looking forward to in 2013?

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:36.000
Probably Bioshock Infinite.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:37.000
Oh, yes.

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:38.000
Oh, yes.

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:42.000
A lot of people waiting for that proper sequel, quote unquote, to Bioshock.

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:43.000
Very soon now, right?

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:44.000
Is that March?

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:45.000
Coming out March?

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:48.000
Like, Bioshock Infinite and Tomb Raider.

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:49.000
Back to back, aren't they?

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:50.000
Yeah.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:51.000
Yeah.

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
It's going to be an exciting year for games, that's for sure.

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:54.000
All right.

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
Push it back again.

02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:00.000
Well, Stealthpoke, anything else on your mind tonight before I let you go, buddy?

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:01.000
Nope.

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:02.000
Just don't bother calling.

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:03.000
All right.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:04.000
Well, you made it.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:05.000
Tell all your friends.

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:06.000
All right.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:07.000
All right.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:08.000
Take care, buddy.

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:09.000
Thanks.

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:10.000
All right.

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:11.000
Thanks for the video call as well.

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:12.000
You're a good listener.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:13.000
We like the video calls.

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:14.000
Take care, buddy.

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:15.000
You too.

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:16.000
Bye.

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:17.000
Excellent job by Stealthpoke.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:18.000
Great first call.

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:19.000
All right.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:20.000
All right.

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:21.000
Thank you so much for joining tonight.

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:22.000
I'm very sorry to those of you that didn't get through.

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:23.000
But consider sending an email with your thoughts.

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
Mailbag at orangelandrado.com.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
Or send us a tweet in the future.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:32.000
And I think with that, we're going to start to wrap up the show.

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
I know it's not as long of a show as last week.

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:35.000
But come on, guys.

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:36.000
Last week's show was practically a marathon.

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:42.000
Did you know, actually, last week's was the biggest MP3 I've ever put to the server?

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:45.000
Because the marathon show, the proper one a couple years ago, was split up into three

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:46.000
parts.

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:50.000
So last week's show was the longest show we've had outside of that marathon.

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
So food for thought.

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:53.000
So it's a little short.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
It's a little under three hours this week.

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:56.000
But that's all right.

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:57.000
There was a little less gaming news as well.

02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:02.000
It's kind of still a slow week because people take the rest of this week off for the holidays

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:05.000
sometimes, too, because the kids are still off from school or what have you.

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:10.000
So I think things will be back in a full swing next week as we ramp up towards the big release

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:13.000
of games such as BioShock Infinite, as our last caller mentioned there.

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
Or Devil May Cry in a couple weeks.

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:16.000
Devil May Cry coming out very soon.

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:17.000
I know Tomb Raider.

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:20.000
We got big news over the holiday about multiplayer and Tomb Raider.

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
A lot of the internet was raging against that.

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:27.000
I'm not sure I get it because multiplayer only made Mass Effect 3 better.

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:28.000
But we'll see.

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:29.000
We'll see.

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
We'll see when the game comes out.

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:35.000
So be sure to send us an email and let us know what you think of the upcoming games

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:36.000
and what you're looking forward to.

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:40.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:43.000
And before I go around and get everybody's final thoughts, you know, we always say it

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:44.000
here on the show.

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:45.000
We really mean it.

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
You know, we don't ask for your money to do this program.

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
You can send it to me.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:50.000
Well, we don't try to.

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
But you could donate it to Vogue.

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
We don't try to sell you anything or what have you.

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:57.000
All we ask, if you enjoy the show, help us spread the word.

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
Bring more people into our family.

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:02.000
Get more people like Stealth Pope to listen live.

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:06.000

Facebook and Google Plus and so forth.

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
Leave us a nice review on iTunes.

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:11.000
That always helps as well.

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:15.000
Thumbs up in Stitcher and listening to us in Stitcher and giving good feedback there

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
helps our ranking there.

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
All of it really goes a long way.

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
Please help us spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
We really, truly appreciate it.

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:24.000
All right.

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:27.000
Now is the time where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:28.000
I'll start tonight.

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:33.000
My final thought is, Jamie, you are an evil, evil, evil woman for bringing that peppermint bark into the house.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:34.000
It was so delicious.

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:35.000
You're welcome.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:36.000
All right.

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:37.000
Dark Sakura, your final thought.

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:38.000
I don't have one.

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
Oh, an apathetic final thought tonight.

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:41.000
That's all right.

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:42.000
Reject false icons.

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
I'll do that for her.

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
Loki, your final thought tonight.

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:49.000
Skyrim is going to be really goofy once I get playing it.

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:52.000
I've got a lot of weird mods I'm going to put on this thing.

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:53.000
All right.

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
You'll have to post some lolsy pictures up on the chat.

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
VoG Minecraft is still going, yes?

02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:00.000
Yeah, VoG Minecraft is going, although I haven't played it all this week.

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
Probably going to go back at some point.

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:05.000
Time splitting between 40 different things.

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:09.000
And by the way, check your Twitters because there's a podcast inviting you on.

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:10.000
I saw on the Twitters.

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:13.000
I actually have a question for you about the server.

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:16.000
How do you put up a sign that shows where your area is?

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:19.000
Oh, it's a command you have to do.

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:23.000
I don't know if everyone has permissions to do the dynamap stuff, but I can do that.

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:31.000
Well, if you found my little burrow in the ground, then it's near the big sign in the center of the map.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:34.000
I'll add permissions if I haven't done that already.

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:35.000
All right.

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:36.000
Sounds good.

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
Well, thank you again for downloading and listening to our show.

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
We really appreciate it.

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:41.000
Have a great week, guys.

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:44.000
Next week, we will be back to do it all again live.

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:47.000
Jason is going to be joining us along with Ryan.

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
They're going to be back next week.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
I think Jason was here a couple months ago.

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
Ryan was here for the 10th anniversary show.

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:54.000
They will be back.

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:55.000
We'll catch up with them.

02:42:55.000 --> 02:43:01.000
And we'll catch up with all of you next week here at the Voice of Geeks Network in the battle space.

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:04.000
Thank you for supporting independent podcasting.

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
You guys are awesome.

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:07.000
We love the O.L. Army.

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:08.000
Good night.

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
We're all still true.

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
See you next week.

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
Thank you.
