17800	23180	game is set to come to the U.S. Sony plans to make a big sale, and Disney Infinity is
23180	31740	finally officially unveiled.
31740	34960	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
34960	37220	where every gamer has a voice.
37220	45720	It is Orange Lounge Radio with episode 490 of our show for this January the 20th of 2013.
45720	48980	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next several hours to talk about
48980	54780	video games and the gamer lifestyle along with those of you in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
54780	56980	and the all important co-hosts here on the show.
56980	59340	First off, say hello to Jamie Summers.
59340	60700	I'm not in the kitchen.
60700	63220	What are you doing out of the kitchen?
63220	64220	Hosting a show.
64220	65220	No wait, no.
65220	66220	Hold on.
66220	67220	Put the angry emails down.
67220	68220	This is not a sexist joke.
68220	69220	She was actually in the kitchen making coffee.
69220	70220	Making coffee.
70220	71220	Now I have- That's what she wanted.
71220	72540	Chocolate mint creamer to go with my chocolate mint coffee.
72540	73540	All right.
73540	74540	There you go.
74540	75540	Minty.
75540	76540	Minty fresh.
76540	77540	Just like tonight's show?
77540	78540	I don't know.
79100	80100	Minty fresh.
80100	81100	Tech master Loki.
81100	82100	Hi.
82100	83100	Remember when fresh was a compliment?
83100	84100	Yes.
84100	85100	I remember the 90s.
85100	89260	Like funky fresh or I always think of crescent fresh from Siffle and Ollie which was an underrated
89260	90260	TV show.
90260	91260	Siffle and Ollie?
91260	92260	No.
92260	93260	Siffle and Ollie.
93260	94260	Not Siffle-less dark soccer.
94260	95420	I wonder how their rebirth- Be quiet when you're in the kitchen.
95420	97060	I wonder how their rebirth is doing.
97060	98420	I say that because she doesn't have a mind.
98420	100620	Because I remember like, hey, Siffle and Ollie are coming back.
100620	101620	They're doing game reviews.
101620	102620	Oh yeah.
102620	104260	I forgot after the first episode.
104260	105260	Yeah.
105260	106260	Exactly.
106260	107260	The first episode was funny though.
107980	110660	See, I think maybe that's the type of thing you're just going to have to marathon during
110660	111660	a weekend.
111660	113620	Like, you know, some people marathon what?
113620	116300	Game of Thrones or what else?
116300	118260	What are the other big TV shows people watch?
118260	119580	True Blood.
119580	122540	If you're Jamie, Supernatural and only Jamie.
122540	123540	Okay.
123540	124540	Doctor Who.
124540	125540	That's when a lot of people marathon.
125540	129180	Once Upon a Time, my friends, which okay.
129180	131180	Matt Cross.
131180	133140	Actually, we did.
133140	137020	We did actually have an anime night at my house kind of.
137780	140460	We watched Matt Cross Do You Remember Love, but then we watched the live action Rurouni
140460	142460	Kenshin movie and it was Amazeballs.
142460	143460	Oh yeah.
143460	144460	You invited me to come over and watch that.
144460	145460	Yeah, but you said no.
145460	147020	Well, we got stuck doing something else.
147020	148020	Yeah.
148020	149020	But Alan was working.
149020	150020	The Rurouni Kenshin movie was Amazeballs.
150020	151020	Was it?
151020	152020	Yeah.
152020	153020	Good times.
153020	154020	All right.
154020	157460	Well, again, we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock
157460	159360	Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network.
159360	163020	That is vognetwork.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
163020	166220	And if you want to participate live with our show, join us.
166220	169820	We have a live chat room, so if you do happen to be tuned in live tonight, make sure you're
169820	174260	in the chat room to get the full experience, live.vognetwork.com.
174260	177480	And it is possible to chat and multitask and do other things.
177480	178620	We don't take offense.
178620	182840	If you want to listen to the show, chat and play, I don't know, World of Warcraft or whatever
182840	183840	computer game, Civ 5, whatever.
183840	186900	But if you're watching sports ball, I'll shoot you.
186900	187900	Stop it.
187900	188900	That's disrespectful.
188900	189900	With a rubber band.
189900	190900	That's disrespectful.
190900	191900	With a rubber band.
191900	195980	Speaking of sports ball, there was no Bobby Black Wolf tonight because there was some
195980	198500	big sports ball games going on.
198500	206020	Ironically enough, our quote unquote local team, the San Francisco 49ers, even though
206020	210340	they're a hundred miles away, it's the closest NFL team we have, playing his Atlanta Falcons
210340	211720	and the Niners won.
211720	214260	So I think they're all drowning their sorrows in beer right now.
214260	216780	Dan calls them the 40 whiners.
216780	218180	Why is that?
218180	219180	I don't know.
219180	220540	I hate sports ball.
220540	227020	Well, when I first came into chat tonight, some of the chatters at live.vognetwork.com
227020	230020	were like, oh, Rob's team defeats Bobby's team.
230020	231020	And oh my gosh.
231020	232020	I'm like, wait, wait, wait.
232020	233020	No, no, no, no, no.
233020	234020	Let's be clear.
234020	236780	Just because the 49ers are local does not make them my team.
236780	239420	First off, I'm not really big on football.
239420	243100	I'm not going to sit here and say, you suck if you like football, because I don't believe
243100	244100	that.
244100	245260	Everybody's got their things that they're into.
245260	247500	It's just more socially acceptable to be into football.
247500	248500	Let's be real.
248500	250660	When I make posts about like, oh, I'm so excited.
250660	252520	Such and such got evicted from Big Brother.
252520	254300	Everybody looks at me like weirdo.
254300	255300	You damn weirdo.
255300	256620	What's wrong with you?
256620	257980	Well, or gaming.
257980	260100	I want to talk about esports in a minute.
260100	261520	Acid Vampire made me cry.
261520	267180	But just to be clear, just to be clear, if I have a team, it is the Minnesota Vikings.
267180	269300	And that's because of Chris Cluey.
269300	270300	Let's Chris Cluey.
270300	271300	Why?
271300	272300	Who?
272300	273300	Chris Cluey.
273300	276180	He is the guy that wrote, he plays World of Warcraft for one.
276180	279060	He's an NFL player that plays World of Warcraft for one, which makes him awesome.
279060	283220	And two, he's the guy that wrote that, you know, profanity laced letter about the whole
283220	284220	gay marriage thing.
284220	286540	And like basically say you're an idiot if you don't support it.
286540	287540	It's cool.
287540	288540	Yeah.
288540	293420	So, you know, I don't use this term very often, but like, he's like a bro.
293420	296780	You know, Johnny apparently is spanking off to the show.
296780	297780	What?
297780	298780	What?
298780	303340	Says, I can multitask with the show, watch Californication, laugh at jokes, bleeping
303340	304700	off and listen to the show.
304740	308820	He means nodding off because he doesn't want to offend us, not sodding off.
308820	309820	All right.
309820	311820	La la la la la.
311820	316740	Anyhow, that, uh, little gem from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, what were you
316740	319660	saying about a city vampire earlier, making you cry in chat?
319660	320660	What was that about?
320660	321660	He said the Firefly was overrated.
321660	325060	So I said his butt was overrated.
325060	329260	That's okay because, um, Brad, Brad from pod culture is taking care of it for me.
329260	330260	Yes.
330260	334660	You also can get mature responses like such in our chat room from a host nonetheless.
334660	338980	Live.vognetwork.com again, Jamie, you said your butt is overrated.
338980	339980	Is that what you said?
339980	346020	But I say the same thing to my husband, except I tell him like, he'll be like, well, this,
346020	347020	this song's kind of weird.
347020	351860	It's like, well, your face is kind of weird, which just earns me a look.
351860	352860	All right.
352860	353860	So pun intended.
353860	357980	The kickoff topic I wanted to talk about tonight was ports.
357980	358980	Hold on.
358980	359980	All right.
359980	361260	Don't sit there and be all like, I met you.
361260	362260	Your pun.
362260	363260	Oh, okay.
363260	364500	I am going to punish you.
364500	366740	I thought you were, you were going on your tirade about football again.
366740	369740	I'm like, no, I don't care.
369740	370740	People like sports ball.
370740	377980	If they want this, the Stanley goal, you know, if they want the, the, the, I don't know,
377980	381220	the Uber league cup, they they're welcome to it.
381220	385700	Well, how often have we talked about video games ought to be a sport and that topic comes
385700	386700	up once in a while.
386700	387700	I don't know.
387700	388700	I don't know how people truly feel about that.
388700	393020	Like I say, like we all say it, but maybe we don't like, you know, and I think about
393020	398540	e-sports and that whole thing and it's still, e-sports still feels very like, I don't want
398540	403740	to say underground because I do see it getting more and more visibility, but let's be real.
403740	409340	They don't exactly televise star craft matches on NBC prime time or whatever.
409340	413660	We're not really at that level yet, but you know, thanks to the internet and the internet
413660	417940	is in many ways killing traditional broadcast mechanisms, right?
417940	423380	I mean, ratings for once powerhouse TV shows like American idol or way down.
423380	427020	And I think we have the internet today for a lot of that because, uh, you know, people
427020	429340	watch their Netflix or people watch the things that they want to see.
429340	434300	And some people prefer to watch these e-sports things and we've seen, you know, the online
434300	439820	streaming solutions like Ustream, Justin TV, or excuse me, it's Twitch TV or whatever,
439820	443820	all that stuff, uh, you know, is, is popular for the people who want to see it.
443820	448100	Um, you know, you log into a site like Twitch that actually shows you like, this is the
448100	450420	game that's being broadcast most of all.
450420	454380	Do you guys know what game is broadcast more than any other on Twitch TV?
454380	456020	The puppy bowl.
456020	460860	I wish, seriously though, do you know what video game is broadcast more than any other
460860	461860	on Twitch TV?
461860	462860	Star craft?
462860	463860	No.
463860	464860	World of Warcraft?
464860	468540	No, that, that world of Warcraft is number two.
468540	471700	And usually when it's world of Warcraft, it's PVP, at least in my experience.
471700	475780	I see way more PVP arena people doing that than anything else.
475780	480420	League of Legends is the game that I see stream more than anything else on Twitch TV.
480420	484020	So I just, you know, and that's a, that is, that game is built to be very competitive
484020	486420	and that whole, like, um, what do they call it?
486420	492660	The MOBA style games, which funny tangent, I actually downloaded League of Legends finally
492660	493860	this weekend.
493860	495100	I didn't get far enough.
495100	498900	I played the little tutorial and then it got into picking a character and dah, dah, dah.
498900	502460	And like, I literally had somewhere else to be, so I kind of stopped, but I am going
502460	503460	to try.
503460	504460	I have a long weekend.
504460	506300	Let's do a lot of people, uh, this weekend from work.
506300	509260	So I'm going to try and play a little more tomorrow because everybody always talks about
509260	511260	League of Legends and it is free.
511260	513140	So you know, why not?
513140	514460	And I also have dota too.
514460	516700	So it's like those MOBA games are becoming more and more.
516700	519100	Do we have any chatters that are really into that stuff?
519100	525580	Just out of curiosity, live.vognetwork.com, uh, Mako in our chat room says, what would
525580	526580	be Mico?
526580	533620	Mico says, watch today's Intel extreme masters finals was damn fantastic.
533620	535540	I admit to being a sad man.
535540	537380	Well, why is that sad?
537380	541780	Is that really any different than the people that all gathered around and watched the football
541780	542780	game?
542780	544620	And I'm not calling either one sad.
544620	545900	You're into whatever you're into.
545900	547540	I'm calling all of it sad.
547540	548540	I'm kidding.
548540	549540	Yeah.
549540	550980	And then you're going to go home and watch Supernatural.
550980	553460	So you know, I'm actually way behind on Supernatural to be honest.
553460	554460	No judgment here.
554460	555660	None at all.
555660	558060	And then you'll, then you'll post about it on Tumblr.
558060	564140	Uh, I did however, finish Sherlock, a city vampire in our chair and says, sports will
564140	569420	be more entertaining if the athletes were naked back in the day, the gladiator gladiator
569420	570660	arenas back in the day.
570660	577140	You know, I think the dangly bits are hilarious, so I'd just be busy laughing.
577140	579180	I don't even know how to respond to that.
579180	584340	Um, Rob can't even, oh, you know what, if you want to watch naked athletes, watch a
584340	590060	wrestling, that would be your sport then, because let's be real in what other, there's
590060	594340	only two sports I can think of where it's socially acceptable to run around in a speedo
594340	595540	the whole time.
595540	597900	One of them involves a swimming pool.
597900	599760	The other one is wrestling.
599760	600760	Think about it.
600760	610300	Um, also in our chat room at live.vogna, which wrestlers wear cups, uh, SGA 100 Matt says
610300	613860	league of legends and Korean star craft matches are broadcasted a lot.
613860	614860	That's right.
614860	619060	I wonder, what do you think it is about those types of games specifically that really draw
619060	620360	people in?
620360	625020	Why don't you see a lot of competitive music based games?
625020	627980	I hardly ever see a lot of like competitions online about that.
627980	633020	What is it about those games that you think really draws people into esports and watching
633020	634020	all that online?
634020	640500	Do you think it's because they're just designed to be that way?
640500	641500	Any thoughts?
641500	644780	I really honestly don't know what the appeal is.
644780	649060	I mean, truly, I don't know what the appeal is and I can't even fathom what the appeal
649060	650060	is.
650060	651580	Well, to be fair, you haven't played it.
651580	656860	Unless it's like, you know, fantasy football type of attraction, you know, where you can
656860	659820	see your fantasy team play or whatever.
659820	661820	I don't know.
661820	662820	Logie?
662820	665820	I don't know.
665820	668060	We don't know why people get into this.
668060	672980	Seriously, they tried to do a fantasy football league at my old job and they asked me, you
672980	675260	know, to been in it and I was like, I don't know.
675260	676260	That's all I said.
676260	678420	One thing like watching, I don't know what that is.
678420	682060	Like watching the esports stuff is just more kind of, I mean, it's fun to watch people
682060	683060	play sometimes.
683060	686380	Like I used to watch Arena on G4 and that was sort of esports stuff.
686380	691180	I mean, I don't know how staged all that was, but it's basically, you know, two teams and
691180	692180	a commentary.
692180	695700	And that can be fun sometimes if it's a game you're interested in, like if they did a Grand
695700	700900	Theft Auto, although, you know, they'd have to show me because I'm so fucking awesome.
700900	707660	But hey, wait until five because no one plays anymore.
707660	709500	What about competitive Minecraft?
709500	710940	Although I guess that's not really a thing.
710940	711940	It could be.
711940	712940	It is a thing.
712940	713940	Is it?
713940	714940	No, it can be a thing.
714940	719580	Well, competitive Minecraft, they have usually it's different game modes like the people
719580	720580	set up.
720580	726260	For example, I've watched videos of people just creating their own kind of games, like
726260	732440	one of which, OK, everybody, we're going to throw you outside of this house and the first
732440	738300	person to, was it the last person to survive is the winner or something like that.
738300	739300	Like Minecraft Battle Royale?
739300	740300	Sort of.
740300	742580	And it was like it's basically a ton of monster zone.
742580	746940	They gave them like very little weapons and it was just, OK, survive and whoever survives
746940	747940	the longest.
747940	749260	And they have like rounds and stuff that deal with that.
749260	750260	And that's kind of entertaining.
750940	751940	It really blows my mind.
751940	756180	They haven't made a game out of battle royale or even like the Hunger Games they have on
756180	757180	Minecraft.
757180	758180	They have a Hunger Games servers.
758180	759180	OK.
759180	760180	All right.
760180	763140	They actually do play the Hunger Games like that, where they all start off and it's basically
763140	768540	everybody free for all and there's chess where they find stuff to help them survive.
768540	772700	For the record, I'm not talking about that iPhone game that was like a platformer shooter
772700	773700	based on.
773700	774700	You know what I'm talking about.
774700	778980	I mean, like, you know, strategize, find the weapons, find your opponents, that that whole
778980	779980	type of thing.
780700	784260	I know Marvel totally bit off battle royale specifically now because now there's like
784260	788780	an Avengers battle royale comic where they've taken like little bit characters from all
788780	793540	over the Marvel universe and make them basically kill each other off until there's one left.
793540	796020	And the cover is totally a rip off the movie.
796020	799860	Well, battle royale kind of gained a lot of popularity again, thanks to the Hunger Games.
799860	804100	I mean, you know, obviously, a lot of people saw the similarities and so forth.
804100	809180	But I heard at one point the CW was kicking around a battle royale show.
809180	810180	It's gone.
810180	812300	They are not moving forward with it.
812300	815500	That would definitely, I would totally watch it.
815500	816580	They said, hold on, guys.
816580	818740	It was nothing more than like an idea we kicked around.
818740	819740	But still, what an odd TV show.
819740	824300	Yeah, we can't put that out now that there's kids dying, you know, in the news.
824300	826940	I think it would make a great TV show as a drama.
826940	835260	I mean, I'm really surprised nobody's tried to pitch a like a literal Hunger Games reality
835260	836260	show.
836260	837260	Obviously, no death.
837260	838260	Paintball?
838260	841940	Paintballs or, you know, non lethal types of things like, you know, silly things of
841940	847140	your beatings and nerf the Nerf Hunger Games.
847140	848140	They have laser.
848140	849140	I watch that.
849140	850140	The Nerfing games.
850140	851140	There you go.
851140	852140	I'd even watch that.
852140	855100	You know, they need to bring back laser tag.
855100	856420	Yes.
856420	857420	Except not the bad cartoon.
857420	858420	Is that a TV show?
858420	859420	Yeah.
859420	860420	There's a bad laser tag cartoon.
860420	861420	Huh?
861420	865260	Well, I was I thought they actually had laser tag on TV.
865260	866700	I never thought they actually had it on TV.
867140	868140	The commercial.
868140	869140	No, no.
869140	870140	Back in the 90s.
870140	871140	They kind of had else.
871140	872140	You can see the 80s cartoons.
872140	875340	You can see all sorts of weird shit on in the morning in the 90s, you know, and.
875340	881620	Well, now you just see all sorts of weird shit on after midnight on Adult Swim.
881620	885580	There's a big difference, though, between Adventure Time, which is great.
885580	886580	Don't get me wrong.
886580	887580	I love it.
887580	891060	There's a big difference between that and like Fun House.
891060	892060	Okay.
892060	894860	Tiger class says they should do a survivor for kids.
894860	896220	They did.
896740	900740	It was called Lord of the Flies.
900740	902020	No, but they did.
902020	903020	They did.
903020	905780	It was like, was it Eco-Challenge or something like that?
905780	907220	They did have one for kids.
907220	908780	It was survivor for kids.
908780	912700	But I it was obviously a lot different, like because, you know, obviously you don't want
912700	914380	to do the psychological trauma with kids.
914380	920020	But there was I think it was mostly physical based like like Guts.
920020	921020	Guts was awesome.
921020	922020	Right.
922020	924340	I liked the announcer.
924340	926700	I'm hoping somebody in chat will remember the name of that show.
926700	927700	I need it.
927700	928700	I need a reality TV nerd.
928700	930380	If like Shane's listening, he might remember.
930380	931860	He'll know what show I'm talking about.
931860	934180	I don't remember what network it was on.
934180	935180	SSJ 100.
935180	938940	Matt says American Gladiators was the closest we had to that type of thing.
938940	940980	You know what happened with that reboot?
940980	946580	I was so excited because like American Gladiators was such bad ass TV back when we were growing
946580	947580	up.
947580	950460	It was like it was so just brain gone.
950460	951460	It doesn't matter.
951460	952780	It's just errors.
952780	955320	It was watching for the love of God.
955320	956480	It was.
956480	959780	Can you have a game show without all the reality bullshit tied to it?
959780	960980	I mean, that's everything nowadays.
960980	963780	It's like trying to get in the head of the contestant and like, let's find out about
963780	964780	their life.
964780	965780	I don't care what you like.
965780	966780	I want to see them play a game.
966780	967780	And that's it.
967780	971580	All I need to know about them is their name is Bob and they're from Detroit or something
971580	972580	like that.
972580	973580	That's it.
973580	974580	And they're a firefighter.
974580	975580	Whatever.
975580	976580	And there they were in the military.
976580	977580	You know, that type of thing.
977580	978580	That's all we need to know.
978580	979580	Yeah.
979580	980580	I think it just didn't work in primetime.
981000	983420	American Gladiator just came back as like a primetime show.
983420	986680	Like, you know, and it's just like, no, this is the type of thing that's meant to be like
986680	987680	Saturday at four o'clock.
987680	988680	I've already found the best show.
988680	991460	They need, what they need to do is take reality TV and just give it all to Canada because
991460	994080	Canada does it right.
994080	995080	Canada does it right.
995080	997300	I am addicted to Canada's worst drivers.
997300	998700	OK.
998700	1002780	Shane is asking, is it the CBS one that had the kids living in the town?
1002780	1003780	Kid Nation?
1003780	1005180	No, I forgot about that one.
1005180	1009960	That one got a lot of shit because it was like really psychologically damaging to those
1009960	1010960	kids.
1010960	1012180	There was another one.
1012180	1013920	It was on cable.
1013920	1014920	It was on.
1014920	1019240	I don't think it was on Nickelodeon, but like Discovery Kids or something.
1019240	1020240	Somebody's got to know this.
1020240	1022400	I will look it up on Wikipedia, dammit.
1022400	1024040	All right.
1024040	1027160	I guess we'll move into how was your gaming week?
1027160	1029960	This way I can answer this question by looking.
1029960	1033440	Somebody's listening to the podcast, not live this week, going, I know the name of the show.
1033440	1034440	It was.
1034440	1035440	All right.
1035440	1036800	Let's go to Dark Sakura.
1036800	1038000	And how was your gaming week?
1038040	1040880	I played Minecraft last night for for four hours.
1040880	1041880	Wow.
1041880	1042880	What a what the turnaround.
1042880	1043880	Jamie's me.
1043880	1047200	Remember when you used to sit here on the show and say Minecraft's stupid.
1047200	1048360	I didn't say it was stupid.
1048360	1051400	I just said I wouldn't play it until someone paid for me, too.
1051400	1054080	And now that someone paid for me, too, that I'm playing it.
1054080	1059760	But I was busy working on my underground lair, which apparently Loki hasn't found yet.
1059760	1061200	I haven't really been playing that.
1061200	1066520	I've been see like I've been trying to do things that involve my brain in not the same
1066520	1067520	way Minecraft doesn't.
1067520	1070240	But it's just like I don't really know what I want to do with it right now.
1070240	1073440	And so I've been trying to do other things, but then my brain gets too tired.
1073440	1078200	So I play like dumb games like Skyrim with a ton of mods on it.
1078200	1080160	It's really unstable now, too.
1080160	1082520	Well, I was just doing other stuff.
1082520	1085400	So that's why I was playing Minecraft while I was doing other things.
1085400	1089780	But it's just sort of nice to sit back and have something mindless to sort of work on
1089780	1095040	that's a little creative and trying not to hit those guys that explode.
1095040	1096040	I hate them.
1096080	1098440	Because most of my houses are made out of glass.
1098440	1100800	My roofs are made out of glass.
1100800	1103960	I've got this whole network of underground tunnels built.
1103960	1105940	And I seriously have a mole village.
1105940	1108120	People can come live in my mole village if they want to.
1108120	1110320	I finally put a bed in my house.
1110320	1112760	Can you play whack-a-mole in your mole village?
1112760	1113760	No.
1113760	1115840	And I did play a little WoW.
1115840	1117880	I'm trying to get back into WoW.
1117880	1121480	I played some Mass Effect 3, but that's just because I was playing around with more of
1121480	1124400	the mods and I think I'm close to getting Flycam working.
1124400	1127780	Are you going to get into the whole...
1127780	1129240	The name slipped my mind.
1129240	1131360	When they make the movies out of video games.
1131360	1132360	Machinima.
1132360	1133360	Thank you.
1133360	1134360	Machinima.
1134360	1135360	Are you going to get into the whole Machinima thing?
1135360	1137080	No, but on my Mass Effect-ing Tumblr.
1137080	1138080	That's like your...
1138080	1139080	That's why I ask.
1139080	1141440	Because your Mass Effect-ing Tumblr, you're making still pictures.
1141440	1142440	That's kind of like getting your big toe in the door.
1142440	1144200	I'm doing Lull Effect is what it's called.
1144200	1145200	Lull Effect.
1145200	1146200	Is that like a thing?
1146200	1147200	It's not just you, it's a bunch of other people?
1147200	1149200	Other people have done it, but now I'm making it a thing.
1149200	1150840	What if it's not very funny though?
1150840	1151880	A lot of people think it is.
1151880	1154040	So I've got 103 followers now.
1154040	1155040	Wow.
1155040	1157400	How come we can't get that many people listening to the show?
1157400	1158400	Shut up.
1158400	1159800	Does this show need Lull Effect?
1159800	1160800	It needs more Mass Effect.
1160800	1162800	Tell a Mass Effect joke.
1162800	1163800	Caden.
1163800	1164800	Get out.
1164800	1173080	But I've also started doing this other thing that I call Shepherd and Tumblr.
1173080	1176880	I've done three versions now where one of them is like Shepherd looking at Tumblr on
1176880	1177880	a data pad.
1177880	1182600	And I've exploded it now to where Shepherd was looking at pictures of cats on Google.
1182600	1186560	And then I have another one where Shepherd's looking at Grumpy Cat.
1186560	1188640	It's actually one of the last ones I posted on Mass Effect.
1188640	1191280	And that's what people post on Tumblr.
1191280	1193760	Pictures of Shepherd looking at cats.
1193760	1198800	But that's on Mass Effect because most of Tumblr is built off of Lull Cats and the Grumpy
1198800	1199800	Cat.
1199800	1200800	So I did a Grumpy Cat one.
1200800	1201800	And tits.
1201800	1202800	And tits.
1202800	1206280	I found the funniest one because I also reblog a lot of funny fan comics.
1206280	1211120	And one of them is Tali saying, Shepherd, grab my boobs, and it's broship going honk.
1211120	1216480	And then it's flying off in the air going pilgrimage.
1216480	1218760	That's pretty much Tumblr in a nutshell.
1218760	1219760	So that's what I've been doing.
1219760	1221880	Oh, that and politics, but whatever.
1221880	1224240	SSU 100, Matt, you disappoint me.
1224240	1227440	You need to finish Mass Effect 3.
1227440	1230040	You do it with the extended cut.
1230040	1235880	So I've also been doing that and trying to get back into limbo, but I've just really
1235880	1236880	been busy.
1236880	1238280	I start school this week and my class is all online.
1238280	1242800	But hey, if anyone wants me to design them a website, I can do it for school credit.
1242800	1244280	All right.
1244280	1248280	So J-links remembered the show I was trying to think of.
1248280	1249280	Endurance.
1249280	1250280	Thank you, Tigerclaw.
1250280	1252560	Endurance was the name of Survivor for kids.
1252560	1256020	It was on NBC and then moved to Discovery Kids and I had the kids all split up into
1256020	1259560	teams and it was just, you know, they did all this.
1259560	1263200	Who could survive the longest before their bedtime?
1263200	1264280	Moving on.
1264280	1267560	I just had to put that to rest, that discussion from earlier.
1267560	1270400	All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1270400	1271800	My gaming week was OK.
1271800	1275840	I played a few things that some new things, I guess.
1275840	1280400	I tried out the MOGA with the free game that came with it.
1280400	1289320	The what is it, Modern Combat 4, you know, the complete rip off of Call of Duty by Gameloft.
1289320	1291400	It was OK.
1292120	1296760	I'm not a huge fan of the MOGA controller, like the first one they put out.
1296760	1300360	Their new one that they showed at CES, the one that's full size, I think it'll be a little
1300360	1306520	bit better because, once again, it's kind of like the Vita controls.
1306520	1312080	It's cool that they have dual analog sticks and stuff, but it's just not the same as like
1312080	1313400	a console controller.
1313400	1315840	It's a little bit cramped, I guess.
1315840	1319560	But it worked all right and it was kind of fun until my wife said, what the hell are
1319560	1320560	you doing?
1320600	1323440	We went over to her parents' house and she's like, well, you should bring something to
1323440	1324440	do.
1324440	1325440	I'm like, OK.
1325440	1326440	So I brought something to do.
1326440	1329320	And of course, she did not, even though she asked me to.
1329320	1334880	And so I brought that and she's like, is that a controller for your phone?
1334880	1338240	Are you addicted to games or something?
1338240	1341400	You have that so that it's easier to play games on your phone?
1341400	1344720	I'm like, yeah, because I got it for free.
1344720	1351840	And yes, it is easier to play games like that on my phone.
1351840	1352840	It's not bad.
1352840	1353840	It's pretty cool.
1353840	1358800	If I want to play a game like that, it's a hell of a lot better than virtual sticks and
1358800	1360560	stuff on the actual screen.
1360560	1362760	So it worked out pretty cool.
1362760	1366160	What else did they play?
1366160	1367160	Oh, yeah.
1367160	1371960	More Skyrim on Steam with all my mods in there, although I'm going to start having to scale
1371960	1378160	back on some of those mods, because I'm running into crashing problems where it'll just dump
1378160	1380000	me for no apparent reason.
1380000	1389920	I can't build a forge at my house in Hearthfire because, I don't know, it just will crash
1389920	1390920	for no reason.
1390920	1394320	I'm not really sure why, but it's only one to build a forge.
1394320	1397120	And just some other weird stuff.
1397120	1398120	Like there's one I have.
1398120	1401440	It's called Midas Magic, which adds a bunch of different magic spells that they created
1401440	1402600	for the game.
1402600	1409440	The problem is, they have this thing that you put items in to craft these spells in
1409440	1417920	the Riverwood Trader, and when it creates a spell, the spell book is marked as steel.
1417920	1422640	And so you can't get the book without pissing everybody off.
1422640	1427680	And so the first spell I got, I'm like, okay, I'm going to turn invisible, I'm going to
1427680	1432880	sneak, and be invisible, and I'm going to grab the spell really quick, use the spell,
1432880	1434440	and then maybe they won't notice anything.
1434440	1437120	Nope, they all tried to murder me instead.
1437120	1440280	Which I mean, it's just a minor inconvenience because none of them can actually kill me,
1440280	1445320	but I just don't want to have to kill them, because that would be terrible, all these
1445320	1450440	quests I'll miss because I'm going to have to go kill all of them.
1450440	1457480	Then other games I played, I played one of the other games I backed on Kickstarter, the
1457480	1459240	Gianna Sisters game.
1459240	1461020	Oh yeah, how is that?
1461020	1463760	I have that from the Steam sale, still waiting to be played.
1463760	1466920	It's pretty cool actually, I do enjoy it.
1466920	1471120	Played it with an Xbox 360 controller, and it's a pretty awesome platformer.
1471120	1475800	I'm digging it, I tried it for a little bit and I was like, eh, I don't really want to
1475800	1479280	play this anymore, so I went back to Skyrim, but I liked it, I thought it was a pretty
1479280	1480280	cool game.
1480280	1485560	And then a new game I played on consoles this week, Forza Horizon, actually got into that
1485560	1486560	a bit.
1486840	1490880	Welcome to the cult of Forza Horizon, congratulations.
1490880	1494760	So I played that a bit, and it's fun.
1494760	1498520	First order of business is I drove on all the roads so I can get that achievement, and
1498520	1501160	I hit all the signs, so now I get free upgrades.
1501160	1503120	Did you look online to see where all the signs were?
1503120	1504120	No.
1504120	1505120	Oh, while you were driving?
1505120	1506120	Yeah, I was driving all the roads.
1506120	1508000	I haven't even done that yet.
1508000	1511520	There was a couple that I couldn't find right away, and then I was like, okay, looking at
1511520	1515520	the map and kind of, okay, there's probably something right here, I mean it's pretty obvious
1515520	1517400	where they're hiding some of them.
1517400	1519240	What did you think of the whole introduction and the setup, though?
1519240	1523920	Did you have the same reaction I did, where it's like, these rich spoiled brats?
1523920	1525560	Like, that was my reaction.
1525560	1528520	Not even that, but there's some things that are annoying me about it.
1528520	1534280	It's like, I'll still get radio chatter where it's like, hey, did you see that such a such
1534280	1538760	person has those signs out there, and if you hit them you'll get this guy like, I fucking
1538760	1541680	know because I hit all of them already, you stupid bitch.
1541680	1544200	I don't need you telling me this over and over again.
1544200	1545200	Or like, you know.
1545200	1547400	I think it's just randomized, Logan, it's not that serious.
1547400	1551000	Yeah, I understand, but they should shut that off if you've hit all the signs, or if you
1551000	1555360	know you hit a couple of signs, you should, they should shut that off.
1555360	1558440	Are you really gonna razz the game because some radio lady didn't know you hit all the
1558440	1559440	signs?
1559440	1567840	Well then, and also like, hey, hey, you haven't shown up to my wonderful showcase event, and
1567840	1570560	it's like, do you not like making money?
1570560	1574520	I mean, it's like, fucking stop bothering me, you stupid bitch, I don't wanna do your
1574520	1575520	fucking event.
1575520	1580200	I don't wanna race a, it's like, dude, like, and then the radio answer's hilarious, like,
1580200	1584200	he's all, dude, they have an event where you race a hot air balloon.
1584200	1588160	I'm sorry, but if I heard of like, this event I could go to to watch a car race a hot air
1588160	1591680	balloon, that'd be fucking boring, because hot air balloons are not fast.
1591680	1594000	It's a fun race, have you done the race yet?
1594000	1598800	Yes, I did the race, but hot air balloons are not known for their speed, okay?
1598800	1599800	It's just a hot air balloon.
1599800	1602240	Despite your snark, how do you really feel about the game?
1602240	1603240	It's alright.
1603240	1607560	It's a great game, it's like kind of Burnout Paradise Light, I guess, you know, that's
1607560	1608560	pretty much it.
1608560	1611960	You need to play some online, it's fun.
1611960	1612960	I'm sure it is.
1612960	1615720	One of these nights, we're gonna fill up a race with all VOG people, that's gonna be
1615720	1616720	interesting.
1616720	1618400	And I'll probably still get last place.
1618400	1625280	Well, I had to go into multiplayer to do some of my, the speed trap things, because fucking
1625280	1631160	caravan, like, always being from, goddamn minivan, just like, there, like, I'm flying
1631160	1636400	over the hill, like, four, like, you know, 160 miles an hour, goddamn minivan right there,
1636400	1642480	like, every time, just like some stupid, like, Volkswagen Beetle or something, it's just
1642480	1643480	like, boom!
1643480	1648000	So what, you, you go into the world Rome mode with other people?
1648000	1649000	You don't do racing?
1649000	1650000	By myself.
1650000	1651000	Oh.
1651000	1652000	Well, no, I have been doing racing.
1652000	1656000	I haven't really been racing too much at the events, because I did, I did a lot of the
1656000	1659400	challenges and I got, you know, money from that, and then I bought some cars, and then
1659400	1663920	I, I said, hey, I'm gonna go beat everybody's scores on these things, and so I did that
1663920	1668560	for a lot of it, and kept racing back and forth, so I'm a Lamborghini.
1668560	1672640	A sitting vampire in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, racing a hot air balloon?
1672640	1673640	The hell?
1673640	1674640	Yep, that's a thing.
1674640	1675640	You race airplanes too.
1675640	1679640	Airplanes and apparently a helicopter, according to the radio, but I haven't done that yet.
1679640	1684600	Airplanes thing, man, some of that stuff pisses me off, because those cars handle, like,
1684600	1685600	crap.
1685600	1691240	Or like, I don't know, hey, let's race this Lamborghini on a dirt track, I mean, that
1691240	1696640	doesn't make any sense, or, or some of the ones where they're like, I want you to show
1696640	1700520	off for the people, and you have to do these cool, you know, you have to get, like, twenty
1700520	1704980	eight thousand points by driving down the street, it's like, how the fuck do I do that?
1704980	1706960	Have you played a lot with the customization mode?
1706960	1711400	Brad from Pod Culture in our chat room reminding us the creation mode in Forza is fantastic.
1711400	1712400	It is very good.
1712400	1714780	I don't know if you've played around a lot with the, like, you know, decal making and
1714780	1715780	all that.
1715780	1716780	Yeah, I have, I mean.
1716780	1718300	Oh, yeah, you made, like, an Orange Lodge radio car, didn't you?
1718300	1719940	Yeah, I have an Orange Lodge radio car.
1719940	1720940	That's nice.
1720940	1722780	Well, I haven't finished it yet, but I've got that started.
1722780	1727340	So Bobby made a VoG car, you made an OLR car, I think Brad made a Pod Culture car, we need
1727340	1728340	to, like.
1728340	1729980	I have to have a garis car.
1729980	1732500	You could do, you could make a garis car, probably.
1732500	1736620	Is it interesting how to do it, I mean, it's a lot of just, you have to manipulate the
1736620	1739260	shapes that they give you to make stuff.
1739260	1743740	I bet somebody else already made, I know there's N7 cars all over the place, that's easy.
1743740	1745700	Someone made a Tali car, but it wasn't very good.
1745700	1748580	But actually, like, instead of just, like, writing out Orange Lodge radio, I actually
1748580	1752140	pulled out my old business card, which is completely useless now since the phone number
1752140	1754980	and websites are all incorrect.
1754980	1760100	But I actually recreated the logo that was on there using just boxes.
1760100	1761100	Very cool.
1761100	1765740	All right, anything else for your gaming week?
1765740	1768740	I, uh, Call of Duty, I'm sure I played a little bit of that in Borderlands.
1768740	1773220	I think we restarted Borderlands on true Vault Hunter mode, and we're kind of back up to
1773220	1777740	where we were before, when we first started playing co-op, but I was kind of pissed off
1777740	1782260	at that because I tried, you know, we were trying to go back into the game and do all
1782260	1786700	the side missions and the original difficulty, and it's like, hey, you've unlocked this true
1786700	1788340	Vault Hunter mode, do you want to do that now?
1788340	1792220	I'm like, yeah, sure, whatever, let's bump up the difficulty and, you know, we can go
1792220	1795900	back there and it's like, well, if you decide to, you can change it later on in these settings
1795900	1796900	or whatever.
1796900	1801380	I'm like, okay, can't find the settings anywhere for that, and now that I'm in true Vault Hunter
1801380	1806460	mode, my game restarted, except I have all my weapons and, like, I'm still level, you
1806460	1811420	know, 50, but it's still annoying, I was like, god damn, I, you know, I was gonna do all
1811420	1816620	these side missions, now I just have to do them in this, now, I guess, it'll be a little
1816620	1817620	bit harder.
1817620	1822620	So I haven't downloaded any of the DLC, and I probably won't, maybe, you know, because
1822620	1826780	my friend's playing with me and I don't want to buy two copies of them, so that would be
1826780	1827780	annoying.
1827780	1828780	All right, is that it?
1828780	1829780	That's it.
1830180	1833580	Um, not a whole lot of new stuff, in fact, revisiting old stuff.
1833580	1837860	As far as new stuff goes, there's some iOS games, um, Final Fantasy All the Bravest,
1837860	1841180	a lot of you guys have been reading about this on the internet, it's kind of controversial.
1841180	1844180	I don't want to spoil my thoughts too much, because I actually wrote them down for a VoG
1844180	1848100	article that I'm going to post tomorrow after all the podcasts go up, uh, with some other
1848100	1849940	articles, there's some content going up next week.
1849940	1850940	Promises, promises.
1850940	1851940	Yeah, I know.
1851940	1858580	Uh, but, uh, yeah, Final Fantasy All the Bravest, um, interesting, that's all I'm going to say,
1858580	1859580	for now.
1859580	1860580	Stay tuned.
1860580	1863460	Uh, but I will talk a little more in depth about Temple Run 2.
1863460	1867060	Sequel to Temple Run, which, uh, has inspired a lot of knockoffs and so forth.
1867060	1871580	Temple Run 2 looks gorgeous on my iPad 3 Retina, I gotta say, for a free game.
1871580	1876940	Uh, Temple Run's a really great time killer, and, uh, it's funny because this game gets
1876940	1880420	compared to Pitfall and back and forth when the two games are kind of ripping each other
1880420	1881420	off.
1881420	1885960	I would say Pitfall, uh, and I'm talking about the iOS remake of Pitfall, not, or re-imagining
1885960	1889600	of Pitfall, let's be real, not the classic, classic Atari game.
1889600	1893920	Um, Pitfall really, the re-imagining really jacked a lot from the original Temple Run,
1893920	1897520	but it is kind of neat that Temple Run 2 also kind of went the route of the mine cars and
1897520	1898520	so forth.
1898520	1902080	I think it looks really good, uh, and it's, uh, addicting to play, and, and they kind
1902080	1906560	of changed the, you know, freemium elements of it, and it's, it's a little more compelling
1906560	1908600	than Pitfall, in my opinion.
1908600	1912440	So yeah, Temple Run 2, good times.
1912440	1916560	Um, otherwise, as far as, like, PC and consoles go, not a lot of new stuff.
1916560	1920760	I have Assassin's Creed 3 from the rental company ready to play, but I didn't get around
1920760	1923760	to it this weekend, so I'm gonna check that out during the week this week.
1923760	1931640	Um, and I did play World of Warcraft, of course, had an epic Civilization 5 match again on
1931640	1932640	Saturday night.
1932640	1939040	Uh, this time, it was myself and four other people were playing, so it was five of us
1939040	1943280	playing Civ 5, and, uh, we started, I think, around 8 o'clock.
1943280	1949040	I went to bed at 3.30, and we weren't even close to being done, so yeah, no, no VoG people,
1949040	1950040	unfortunately, this time.
1950040	1952600	I know we've been talking about, like, Bobby and I have been trying to play for a while,
1952600	1954160	and it just hasn't happened yet.
1954160	1958700	Um, but yeah, some of my, uh, IRL friends were all playing, and it was, it was a lot
1958700	1959700	of fun.
1959700	1963120	But the hilarious part is that I'm pretty much on an island all by myself.
1963120	1968320	I'm in, like, an Australia place all by myself with one computer opponent, and they are all
1968320	1971920	on another little continent, and they're just, they're all killing each other, so I'm
1971920	1977560	just like, okay, I'm happy here in my little arctic paradise, whatever, have fun.
1977560	1985760	All right, um, other games I've played this week, um, I went back, kicking it old school
1985760	1988240	on my 3DS, playing a DS game.
1988240	1992920	I've been playing Pokemon Pearl, because ever since that X and Y trailer came out, I'm like,
1992920	1993920	that looks really good.
1993920	2000040	Like, finally, they've got the Pokemon games looking like the cartoon series, like, it
2000040	2001480	took them long enough.
2001480	2006840	So I've kind of decided to go back and look at the older games in an effort to collect
2006840	2011240	Pokemon to transfer to X and Y at some point, so, you know, why not?
2011240	2016080	So I've got very far, but I have about three, four hours logged on Pokemon Pearl.
2016080	2018880	No particular reason I picked that one, that just happens to be the one that I had in my
2018880	2023040	collection from, like, years ago, so, and I never really got very far in it, so I'm
2023040	2024760	rediscovering it all over again.
2024760	2025760	There you go.
2025760	2032920	Um, so, yeah, wow, Civ, Pokemon, I guess that's really about it.
2032920	2034520	Nothing else to share for now.
2034520	2038400	Some random XBLA games here and there, but nothing worth talking in depth about.
2038400	2042000	So let's move on into housekeeping tonight.
2042000	2046520	You can, of course, always visit us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R, and you can also
2046520	2052320	visit us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, and, again, I would encourage
2052320	2057400	you as well to check out the Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com and support some
2057400	2058920	of the other shows that are on the network.
2058920	2062680	We got a lot of great shows throughout the week that play on the network, and encourage
2062680	2064760	you to check that out.
2064760	2068720	Also since I brought up Twitter, I wanted to talk about this real quick, somebody had
2068720	2072920	sent me a tweet the other day, and I thought this was a pretty neat, like, cause I wanted
2072920	2077600	to bring up, and sometimes people will tweet us at O-L-R and say, hey, please retweet this,
2077600	2081080	but remember, if your account is private, we can't retweet, like, the retweet button
2081080	2082640	is actually disabled.
2082640	2090640	So this was one of these things where somebody tweeted, it was, the Twitter handle is UnlimitedOneUps,
2090640	2093160	tweeted us, and said, hey, retweet this.
2093160	2095720	So I can't retweet it, so I'll do something a little different.
2095720	2100600	I will plug it here on the show, cause I think this is a really great cause.
2100600	2110360	It's called presspaws.org, but it's press P-A-W-S, like doggy paws and kitty paws.
2110360	2115040	I thought this was great, cause obviously, Orange Launch Radio, we've had a lot of, you
2115040	2119780	know, loved pets pass away this past year, unfortunately, it's very tragic.
2119780	2121840	So what better time to bring up something like this?
2121840	2126360	The website presspaws.org, saving animals with art and video games, and they're actually
2126360	2130800	doing this whole little gallery, February 9th at Gallery Nucleus, which I believe's
2130800	2133880	in the Chicago area, question mark?
2133880	2137720	So it's not really here, let me actually, actually now I'm curious where this is at.
2137760	2142720	I think the Twitter person was in the Chicago area, so I didn't see this, let me see real
2142720	2143720	quick.
2143720	2146680	Sorry guys, I like literally just brought it up.
2146680	2151280	Oh no, this is in the LA area, my bad, this is in Alhambra.
2151280	2156360	So that's really cool, it's in the LA area, and yeah, I think they hit their goal already
2156360	2163080	of 3,000 to, you know, raise the money and everything, but yeah, check out the website.
2163080	2164240	It's cute.
2164240	2166920	Look at all the doggies with the question mark blocks and the goombas and wearing the
2166920	2167920	Luigi hats.
2167920	2169920	There need to be more kitties.
2169920	2173880	There's another doggie, there aren't, there really aren't a lot of kitties here, are there?
2173880	2174880	There's one.
2174880	2176880	There's a kitty.
2176880	2177880	Yeah.
2177880	2180800	Definitely don't know your target audience on the internet.
2180800	2184080	Well, I thought it was cute and worth a shout out, so there you go.
2184080	2187480	It is cute, very good, and Tigerclaw reposted it in the chat room.
2187480	2189160	Thank you.
2189160	2193400	I wanted to mention something too real quick about my gaming week that I forgot to mention.
2193400	2198360	Wars of Horizon, love, love, love that Horizon base arena station on there.
2198360	2200760	Oh yeah, yeah, they've got some good music in the game.
2200760	2204560	Yeah, a lot of them, you know, a lot of them are actually songs I listened to already in
2204560	2208160	the car, but make a new CD for my car.
2208160	2209160	Yeah.
2209160	2213320	Although, although I have to say, what the fuck is Blue Monday by New Order doing on
2213320	2214320	that goddamn station?
2214320	2215440	It makes no fucking sense.
2215440	2216880	Why the fuck not?
2216880	2222520	Because it's not, it's not, it's not a base on, New Order belongs everywhere, if it was,
2222520	2227380	if it was the New Order remix that was in Blade or something, yes, that would totally
2227380	2231280	fit with that station, but New Order, it just, it doesn't, that would be perfect like on
2231280	2232280	the rock station or something.
2232280	2234560	Maybe your base just isn't high enough.
2234560	2242100	It doesn't have a lot of base in it, it's Blue Monday, I mean, come on.
2242100	2245200	At least it's not that horrible remake that was done a couple, oh my god, it was probably
2245200	2246200	about 10 years ago.
2246200	2250400	Yeah, and those guys were assholes and said, well, our version's better.
2250400	2251400	In hell.
2251440	2252440	Alright.
2252440	2253440	In nowhere.
2253440	2256280	Alright, uh, let's move on.
2256280	2258920	Let's get into gaming news and talk about what's been going on in the video game world
2258920	2263080	this week with you guys commenting and participating live, live.vognetwork.com.
2263080	2266600	If you are listening to the podcast, you can always email us, mailbag at orangelandrater.com
2266600	2267960	or tweet us or what have you.
2267960	2269360	Let's get into the news, Loki.
2269360	2275160	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about Nintendo and it's kind of interesting that
2275160	2280560	they decided to go ahead and merge their handheld and console divisions, which I hope that this
2280560	2284840	means that we're going to see a lot more kind of stuff that we used to have with even
2284840	2288560	like the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance and stuff like that where you see a lot of
2288560	2292840	synergy between the console versions and the portables like, you know, tying into each
2292840	2297360	other like, hey, you can unlock crap from the console version if you plug in your system
2297360	2298360	or whatever.
2298360	2301280	Maybe we see something like that with the 3DS and, you know, the Wii U or something
2301280	2305920	like that, some sort of cross connectivity with some games or something, that'd be pretty
2305920	2312920	awesome or, you know, better console games, I guess, on handhelds or, or I don't know,
2312920	2317480	maybe because the Wii U is almost like a 3DS anyways, just tied to a TV.
2317480	2320320	So yeah, I was going to say, I thought this was going to go more along your joke about
2320320	2323320	how the Wii U is just basically a DS without hinges.
2323320	2325760	It pretty much is.
2325760	2329680	Although we should add hinges, we should just like hinge it to the TV, clamp, clamp the
2329680	2334680	game pad to the TV, there you go, done.
2334680	2341040	You know, actually, if you, well, I was going to see if there was a way to get like an external
2341040	2342040	monitor or something like that.
2342040	2346320	They should make that an external monitor that clips to your game pad that makes it
2346320	2347320	like a 3DS.
2347320	2351160	It's like, okay, I got the screen up here and yeah, I'm kind of thing.
2351160	2354280	Well, let me read this next story because the two kind of go hand in hand.
2354280	2358000	Maybe I want to talk about if, if the two go hand in hand or what it can mean.
2358000	2361360	And it's a report going around about the Wii U game sales.
2361360	2366160	Apparently the game sales are actually lagging behind the Wii and the GameCube.
2366160	2367160	Please note the keyword there.
2367160	2369920	It is the game sales.
2369920	2376920	Analyst Doug Kreutz of a Cohen and company is interpreting the software sales totals
2376920	2382160	for the November to December period were 43% lower than software sales for the Wii and
2382160	2385720	50% lower than those for the GameCube.
2385720	2387600	Ouch.
2387600	2392400	But then again, you know, the Wii U, I don't, I mean, even though a lot of people are like,
2392400	2395920	Wii U has got the biggest launch lineup ever and it's got all these games.
2395920	2400120	I mean, the reality is a lot of those games were already played by people a long time
2400120	2402980	ago and I don't think they were as exciting.
2402980	2407800	And especially alongside the Wii lineup, the original Wii, you know, you had a lot, a lot
2407800	2410120	more like everybody had to have Zelda.
2410120	2413080	And I think on the Wii U you get a lot of people that have to have Mario, but I think
2413080	2414920	people don't feel like they need to get much else.
2414920	2415920	Yeah.
2415920	2418880	Or let's say you own multiple consoles and say you're buying Call of Duty.
2418880	2422640	Are you going to buy the comp or buy Call of Duty for the console that you just got
2422640	2426080	that maybe your friends don't have yet or you can buy it for the one that your friends
2426080	2431480	are already on or, you know, you know, like you put and put out there.
2431480	2435040	I mean, there's a lot of games are just stuff that was either released slightly earlier
2435040	2436040	or at the same time.
2436040	2439600	I mean, it's not a lot of really exclusive new stuff.
2439600	2443840	And one of the big new exclusive games, Nintendo land was included with the console and most
2443840	2444840	people bought anyways.
2444840	2448120	Yeah, but Wii Sports was included with the Wii, which was an even bigger deal.
2448120	2455040	So I, I, but, but it, that's true it was, but this is also being sold alongside of it
2455040	2456040	as well.
2456040	2457040	I mean, that's got to hurt.
2457040	2459480	In fact, every week came with Wii Sports.
2459480	2461800	So there was no like, you know, double ski.
2461800	2465720	Well, in the beginning anyway, we came with Wii Sports, but, um, I don't know.
2465720	2468920	I just, there's not a lot of original games I think for right now.
2468920	2474020	Now to be fair, one thing that is pointed out is that, um, you know, e-shop downloads
2474020	2476400	don't get included in the NPD numbers.
2476400	2480580	So if people are buying games online, which they might've done over the holiday season
2480580	2484100	because they don't want to be caught in the mall, those numbers don't count.
2484100	2487460	I don't think that's as big of a factor as people are making it out to be.
2487460	2492820	I personally have a real hard time plunking down 50 bucks for a game with nothing tangible.
2492820	2496300	It's different when it's like 10, 15, you know, that's about 20 is about as high as
2496300	2497300	I go.
2497300	2500140	Perfect example, earth defense force 2017 portable, sigil only.
2500140	2507860	I was kind of staring at the screen cause I booted up my PSP or my vita, my vita this
2507860	2508860	week.
2508860	2512520	And I was like, you know, I was just looking at him like, do I really want to spend, no,
2512520	2517060	I'm not buying this for $40 that is too fucking expensive for digital download.
2517060	2518060	Sorry.
2518060	2519060	I forgot.
2519060	2521780	I totally forgot to talk about wake up club, but I'll get to that in part B.
2521780	2525660	But see, I spent more than a cost, well Dan did anyway, more than the cost of a Wii on
2525660	2528100	my graphics card.
2528100	2534220	And I can get games that play better, look better, and I can mod to hell and back.
2534220	2537820	Oh, you're going to be one of those people that are like PC gaming above all else.
2537820	2544500	To be honest, to be honest, I think PC gaming these days is really beating out the consoles.
2544500	2548100	I think that now people are starting to realize that you're getting a bit more of your money's
2548100	2554260	worth out of a PC gaming, I mean, except it's not yes and no.
2554260	2558720	Some games just don't run as smooth as they do on consoles because a lot of games are
2558720	2564600	optimized for the consoles, you know, because again, PCs all have that varying equipment,
2564600	2565600	which can make a difference.
2565600	2568260	But you know, consoles, everybody's got the same thing.
2568260	2571780	So a lot of times, you know, what works on the console doesn't necessarily work on PC.
2571780	2573580	I'm not, I mean, look at my gaming week.
2573580	2577380	I play World of Warcraft and Civ V. I'm not knocking PC gaming by any means, but I think
2577380	2578380	there's room at the table for both.
2578380	2584540	But I just think at this point, given the limitations with the Wii U software base,
2584540	2588620	and honestly that you're not getting anything really new out of it except for that little
2588620	2593660	controller, that my money was better spent on my graphics card.
2593660	2598420	Ross Deal UT in chat says, considering how low the Wii U storage is, I doubt that, talking
2598420	2601180	about the downloads, 32 gigs isn't a lot of space.
2601180	2602700	Yeah, that's an issue too.
2602700	2605260	I mean, granted, you can add your own drive to the system.
2605260	2606260	You know, they were touting that.
2607260	2610700	It's too early to really see the impact of that, I think.
2610700	2613980	You know, maybe when there's more desirable stuff, you know, we talked about how the Wii
2613980	2617820	U eShop is very indie friendly and we anticipate there's going to be a lot of good stuff that
2617820	2619740	comes in throughout the year.
2619740	2624620	I think it's still too early to gauge if a lot of people are actually doing that or not.
2624620	2629500	Now Ross Deal UT in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com actually follows up with another good comment
2629500	2631000	I wanted to read here.
2631000	2635420	Ross Deal UT actually left PC gaming because of the DRM.
2635420	2639420	And I got to admit, a lot of the PC games are shooting themselves in the foot when it
2639420	2641140	comes to DRM.
2641140	2647040	Not that consoles necessarily do a lot better, but like, you know, the SimCity shit, like
2647040	2651260	EA's upcoming SimCity game, I'm sorry, I am totally turned off to that game.
2651260	2652940	And it's because of the DRM.
2652940	2655460	Diablo 3 pissed a lot of people off.
2655460	2658860	You know, I think people are finally starting to say, you know what, I think we've hit our
2658860	2662600	limit with how tied we have to be to the internet.
2662600	2665680	You know, how much information we have to transmit from our computer on a regular basis
2665680	2666680	just to play a stupid game.
2666680	2668080	But it's the play with everybody else.
2668080	2672320	I mean, it's totally not because of the DRM, it's the play with everybody else, right?
2672320	2673320	Yeah.
2673320	2675120	But people wanted to cheat in SimCity.
2675120	2677000	Who didn't cheat in SimCity?
2677000	2678240	Everybody cheats in SimCity.
2678240	2682720	So why would you design your game to be online all the time so you can't cheat?
2682720	2683720	Hello?
2683720	2688360	However, Mass Effect 3, just for example, they wanted it online and they update the
2688360	2690160	game whenever they want to.
2690160	2691760	Still hackable, still cheatable.
2692280	2696080	Well, thankfully the single player multi, but they, they will nail your ass if you cheat
2696080	2697080	in the multiplayer.
2697080	2700200	But I'm also not an asshole and won't cheat in multiplayer.
2700200	2703000	So just saying.
2703000	2705880	Maybe other people are assholes and like to cheat in multiplayer.
2705880	2710240	Rama in our chatroom says, there are ways around DRM and for SimCity, I will do just
2710240	2711240	that.
2711240	2712240	That is exactly what's going to happen.
2712240	2714440	And I can't believe EA doesn't realize it.
2714440	2719920	Like some, somebody in a boardroom needs to get over their ego because just wait before
2719960	2723560	the game comes out, somebody will have hacked that DRM and we'll have an offline playable
2723560	2725200	downloadable SimCity.
2725200	2728080	Wait, that is exactly what will happen.
2728080	2730640	There's already hacks for just about any game out there.
2730640	2733600	There's ways to play it without the desk, which I'm actually starting to do with Mass
2733600	2735400	Effect 2 so that I can run text mod.
2735400	2741120	I'm just saying, because mine is a Amazon download.
2741120	2743520	I haven't said the G word.
2743520	2746640	All right.
2746640	2750600	So anyway, the point I wanted to get to was going back a story.
2750600	2754400	You were talking about the console division getting merged with the hardware division.
2754400	2760600	Could the Wii U's, I don't want to say underwhelming performance, but non overwhelming performance
2760600	2762320	be contributing to this?
2762320	2763320	Probably.
2763320	2769360	I would imagine it would be because they need to kind of figure out how they're going to
2769360	2776760	recapture the magic and the kind of serious rush for tight product that the Wii had.
2776760	2779400	I guess I don't really remember too much about the Wii launch.
2779400	2781880	I just know that the consoles are really hard to get.
2781880	2783560	I can tell you right now, they're not hard to get.
2783560	2788800	In fact, we're getting our consoles this early already and not like a year later, like with
2788800	2789960	the Wii.
2789960	2791860	That's because they're sitting on shelves.
2791860	2793440	They are sitting on shelves.
2793440	2794440	Stacks of them?
2794440	2795440	Yes.
2795440	2798440	It's not flying off the shelves and that's got to have them worried.
2799080	2803800	They don't want to have another 3DS debacle.
2803800	2806540	The 3DS is in a much better place now.
2806540	2808320	It is now, but what did that take?
2808320	2811140	They had to drop the price and put out a lot more games.
2811140	2813140	Is that what they're going to have to do?
2813140	2817320	If they have to drop the price of the Wii U within the first year, that's going to look
2817320	2820280	like double failure on their part.
2820280	2824160	I don't know anybody that doesn't think the problem with the Wii U right now is the lack
2824160	2826800	of exclusive games, basically.
2827200	2829200	Yes, there's an awesome Mario game.
2829200	2831720	Yes, Nintendo Land is pretty good.
2831720	2835040	But there's not enough of that.
2835040	2838240	The 3DS had the exact same problem in the beginning.
2838240	2839680	Exact same problem with the 3DS.
2839680	2843440	You had a decent launch lineup, but nothing sustained it.
2843440	2846200	Now we're getting in this position with the Wii U again, which I know you'll get into
2846200	2849500	in a minute when we talk about the releases.
2849500	2853100	It's going to be until next Christmas when we start getting the stuff people really want
2853100	2854340	to get.
2854340	2855340	That's the reality.
2855780	2862360	Well, we don't even know what they have planned beyond, well, I guess, I mean, second quarter
2862360	2865220	is going to be pretty much stuff that's held over from first quarter.
2865220	2867740	Nintendo doesn't announce holiday ahead at E3.
2867740	2868740	They never really have.
2868740	2869820	I mean, think about it.
2869820	2873700	Most of the big heavy hitters are always announced at E3.
2873700	2875540	Other companies don't tend to do that as much.
2875540	2879620	You might find out about stuff a little earlier, but Nintendo really kind of keeps it until
2879620	2880620	E3.
2882340	2884740	Especially with the new Xbox coming out this holiday.
2884740	2885980	They're going to have to do something.
2885980	2889780	They're going to have to really do something.
2889780	2893300	Maybe the console's being merged so that the console people can work on a Wii U game.
2893300	2894300	Who knows?
2894300	2895300	I don't know.
2895300	2896300	Push this button.
2896300	2897300	Look.
2897300	2898300	Hey, there's a 3DS hidden inside there.
2898300	2900220	I bet you didn't know about that.
2900220	2903100	Womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp.
2903100	2907800	Maybe your whole little theory about the 3DS will soon become another Wii U gamepad.
2907800	2909060	Maybe that will come to light.
2909060	2910060	Who knows?
2910060	2914700	Although I don't think the technology is capable in those 3DSs, but maybe there will be a
2914700	2919540	3DS XL XL that will do it.
2919540	2920540	4DS.
2920540	2921540	4D or whatever.
2921540	2922540	Yeah.
2922540	2923540	That will do it.
2923540	2924540	Who knows?
2924540	2925540	That's an interesting question.
2925540	2929580	Do you think the merging of the divisions means something for the next handheld?
2929580	2932220	I guess anything's possible.
2932220	2934700	All right, let's move on with more gaming news.
2934700	2935700	Dark Sakura.
2935700	2936700	Stupid iPad.
2936700	2937700	Okay.
2937700	2946820	So, well, we know that Sony has been losing money left and right, hand over fist.
2946820	2950020	Well, they would like to make money hand over fist, but they've been losing it.
2950020	2956860	So now they're actually selling their New York City headquarters for 1.1 billion.
2956860	2960940	Sony Corp of America.
2960940	2965420	They're going to be selling it off to the Chetric group, and it's supposed to close
2965420	2966420	in March.
2966420	2978580	Now, keep in mind that the company, it cost them, what was it, 770 million in debts that
2978580	2981060	they're up to right now.
2981060	2985100	So selling off this money is going to be a big, selling off the building, sorry, is going
2985100	2988220	to be a huge recoup in lost income.
2988220	2993340	However, I mean, what they're looking at, I'm not sure exactly what it costs to maintain
2993340	2997540	the building, but they have a lot of money to make up.
2997540	3002060	So you take a building, I know land taxes in New York are horrible.
3002060	3003060	They're crazy.
3003060	3004060	I used to do property taxes.
3004060	3005900	Well, we all know New York City is an expensive place to live.
3005900	3006900	It's no secret.
3006900	3009220	And so, you know, the buildings there are worth a lot of money.
3009220	3015800	But I mean, I don't see anything about a relocation of, of business getting a cheaper building,
3015800	3017860	you know, place that's going to cost us money to maintain.
3017860	3020740	I mean, for all we know, they could move to Montana.
3021500	3024020	Can you imagine Sony in Montana?
3024020	3029460	But they are going to be allowed to remain in the building for up to three years with
3029460	3032340	the leaseback arrangement.
3032340	3035260	So it's not like they're moving now.
3035260	3037940	It's that they're letting the building go.
3037940	3039980	Pretty much you're giving them the building back to the bank.
3039980	3042380	We haven't heard anything about like jobs affected or anything.
3042380	3046020	And also, I think it should be mentioned, I don't, Sony does more than PlayStation.
3046020	3047020	Let's not forget.
3047020	3048940	There is a lot at Sony.
3048940	3054180	You know, not even just TVs, they have a whole motion picture division and music.
3054180	3058080	And I'm sure I doubt very little PlayStation happens in Sony.
3058080	3060220	You know, a lot of that is run out of the Bay Area.
3060220	3061220	We know that.
3061220	3064140	Well, in Japan for one, and in the Bay Area for the U.S.
3064140	3069180	Like the video games division for Sony is really, I think, it's decent, but relatively
3069180	3071460	small potatoes compared to the rest of what they do.
3071460	3072460	Sure.
3072460	3073460	Sure.
3073460	3074780	So, but I'm not surprised to see it go.
3074780	3081380	I mean, that's way too much expense and it's not even that interesting looking at the building.
3081380	3082380	But it's in New York City.
3082380	3083380	It's a big building.
3083380	3084380	So there's a lot of stuff in New York City.
3084380	3085820	It doesn't make it cool.
3085820	3089660	It will be interesting to see who snatches it up.
3089660	3090660	What?
3090660	3091660	OK.
3091660	3094140	Valid question.
3094140	3098500	Probably some corporation with tons of money and corrupt practices to screw us over with.
3098500	3099500	Bank of America.
3099500	3101660	God, fuck Bank of America.
3101660	3102660	Moving on, Loki.
3102660	3103660	All right.
3103980	3108200	So as we were talking about a little bit earlier, lots of games supposed to be coming out this
3108200	3111780	fourth or first quarter for the Wii U.
3111780	3117060	Although a lot of them, unfortunately, are just kind of like ports and stuff.
3117060	3118260	But there are some good stuff.
3118260	3121720	So let's talk a little bit about some things coming out.
3121720	3127360	Need for Speed Most Wanted finally coming out to the Wii U in March on the 19th in the
3127360	3132740	U.S. and or North America and in Europe on the 21st.
3132740	3133740	Something really special about that.
3133740	3138300	I don't even really know how they're supposed to, I guess, off screen play mode.
3138300	3143460	So they're going to have that and then you can use it to select your cars and keeps track
3143460	3145760	of your records or something like that.
3145760	3149100	Also bundled, I guess, with the Ultimate Speed Pack, which is some piece of DLC, because
3149100	3151780	that seems to be kind of the trend there.
3151780	3155000	One of the games that was supposed to be highly anticipated for the first quarter, Aliens
3155000	3158400	Colonial Marines, now doesn't really have a firm date.
3158400	3164140	It's not going to be launching on the 12th with the actual game on the other consoles.
3164140	3168660	Instead now it's just kind of TBA, you know.
3168660	3173220	So hopefully that doesn't mean delayed past March, because that would be, you know, it's
3173220	3178640	another big mature rated game for the console.
3178640	3183360	The Amazing Spider-Man Ultimate Edition, you know, getting a port of a game that came out
3183360	3191140	back in June, fantastic, and of course with DLC thrown in there as well.
3191140	3196260	It's coming out in March, and then two games that were expected the first quarter, the
3196260	3201700	Game & Wario and Wonderful 101, which, let's be honest here, two first party games, those
3201700	3203100	aren't really that exciting.
3203100	3209820	I mean, I know Game & Wario, they didn't really show a whole ton of that, and then the Wonderful
3209820	3212780	101, sort of like Pikmin.
3212780	3218520	Now those will begin to release date as far as the first half of 2013, so I will be willing
3218520	3221800	to bet that that's probably going to be after first quarter.
3221800	3224800	I think Wonderful 101 has its anticipators.
3224800	3226700	I think you might be selling it short a little bit there.
3226700	3229000	It's not going to sell that well.
3229000	3230360	It's too niche, I'm sorry.
3230360	3236280	Well, yeah, I think only because maybe the Wii U hasn't, you know, gotten out there as
3236280	3237280	much as possible.
3237280	3240120	It doesn't matter, the genre, I think it's going to be too niche.
3240120	3244260	It's just, it's a niche appeal, I mean, to that.
3244260	3245260	That's what's going to happen.
3245260	3248780	And of course, nothing even mentioned yet.
3248780	3254420	I think Wii Fit U is also supposed to be first half of 2013 as well, so April, May, June,
3254420	3255420	there you go.
3255420	3258500	You got your four title, or three titles there.
3258500	3263580	One title is confirmed though for first quarter, and that's going to be LEGO City Undercover.
3263580	3268740	That's actually launching on the Wii U in March, on the 3DS in April.
3268740	3272720	Pretty much the only game that I was actually looking forward to at all.
3272720	3273720	So there's that.
3273720	3277600	And then for the 3DS, there's going to be Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon, which is coming
3277600	3280000	on the 24th of March.
3280000	3285800	So I want to say, well of course Fire Emblem in February, I want to say though that they
3285800	3290720	haven't really announced any other 3DS titles, other than Smash Brothers, but that's just
3290720	3294320	kind of like, hey, we're working on Smash Brothers, but they haven't really announced
3294320	3298740	anything else for second quarter, first party I think.
3298740	3303660	Oh, Brain Age Concentration Train, I think that's also February.
3303660	3306860	Pokemon XY, but that's the end of the year.
3306860	3312460	Well Pokemon, there's a Pokemon Mystery Dungeon game that's coming out at the end of March
3312460	3313460	as well.
3313460	3318940	But yeah, Pokemon XY would be the fourth quarter.
3318940	3323980	So that's pretty much it, but once again, it's a lot of stuff that's ports, I mean unless
3323980	3328720	you're, I mean I don't know, I don't know a lot of people would be really anticipating
3328720	3335120	getting a game like this, unless this is your only console or something, I just don't see
3335120	3339520	people going, oh I need to get Need for Speed, you know, it's not going to be a really big
3339520	3344160	thing unless, you know, I mean there are really no racing games aside from Sonic and Sega
3344160	3351120	All-Stars Racing, so that might be kind of good if you're into that.
3351120	3352380	But yeah, it's a lot of ports.
3352380	3355840	So that's the only thing that has me worried, is this isn't going to drive, I mean Lego
3355840	3359280	City Undercover could drive some console sales because that's a pretty cool looking game,
3359280	3364720	but it's not, there's no games that really scream, oh my god, I have to get a Wii U now.
3364720	3368080	Well the Need for Speed thing, I don't think this is coming up on our show, or else I might
3368080	3372200	be duplicating something, I hope not, but I remember reading something about the whole,
3372200	3376400	that the Wii U version of Need for Speed will let you do the co-op, where you both drive
3376400	3379640	and want to use on the gamepad and want to use on the TV, and I got to admit, that's
3379640	3380980	pretty rad.
3380980	3385340	You know, that they're able to install like that fully functional two player using the
3385340	3389480	Wii U, that is something you're not going to see on the other systems.
3389480	3391660	For what it's worth, I think that's a neat feature.
3391660	3398980	I'll give that to them I guess, but once again though, it's not like, oh my god, that's really
3398980	3405060	going to sell it for me, it's just, I don't know, it's sad that Lego City, let's not sell
3405060	3411520	Lego City undercover that short, I mean it's a pretty awesome looking game, but I just,
3411520	3416520	I don't know, I don't know if it's really going to be enough.
3416520	3422000	Alright well moving on to another story, this is not about a Wii U release, but a Wii release,
3422000	3426600	like you know, basic Wii, which you know, obviously a lot of people still own the Nintendo
3426600	3430560	Wii, and it's not like your Wii U can't play Wii games, by the way I also transferred all
3430560	3433680	my data from the Wii to the Wii U this week, it was pretty painless.
3433680	3438860	So now I can play my virtual console games with the HDMI collection, woo hoo!
3438860	3443220	But I really wish, sorry I'll get to the story eventually, I need to rant though, I really
3443220	3448820	wish because this pisses me off that virtual console is too stupid for this, why doesn't
3448820	3455700	the system know to automatically side letterbox or put into the right aspect ratio the virtual
3455700	3457080	console games?
3457080	3459600	Why does it still force them to widescreen?
3459600	3464220	Why can't it know to script, because I can set it on my TV, sure, but that's such a pain
3464220	3468440	in the ass, why can't when I boot up Zelda, which is a 4.3 game, like Zelda was not in
3468440	3472860	widescreen on the NES, why can't it just know, oh, flip the resolution back to 4.3?
3472860	3477800	Because they didn't program it in, because they cut corners.
3477800	3479140	Well that's stupid and I hate it.
3479140	3486580	It's just the same reason why they couldn't reprogram, you know, the emulator to run on
3486580	3487580	your gamepad.
3488160	3491160	But that's supposed to be coming, so they're developing it after that.
3491160	3494640	Oh, that'd be nice that you'd have to buy an enhanced version of the fucking game they
3494640	3495640	already have.
3495640	3498640	I, no, that won't be happening.
3498640	3499640	It won't be happening?
3499640	3500640	It won't be happening.
3500640	3501640	Are we absolutely sure of that?
3501640	3502640	Because I bet it's gonna happen.
3502640	3504040	It won't be happening.
3504040	3508400	Look at the virtual console games I have on 3DS, I have not bought anything that wasn't
3508400	3514160	free or not available, like I have a couple Game Boy games, those weren't available before.
3514160	3515160	That's it.
3515160	3518260	Maybe I have maybe two Game Boy games.
3518260	3522380	I'm just saying, I bet you they're gonna do that kind of crap, because they tried to pull
3522380	3528780	that shit with, are they still releasing those 3DS games, the retro ones that are in 3D now?
3528780	3530540	They kind of like say, ah, fuck it.
3530540	3533340	There's non-3D ones, all the Mega Man games, that was a big deal, remember?
3533340	3536620	Yeah, I understand that, but are they doing those, remember how they're like Excitebike
3536620	3537620	and stuff like that?
3537620	3538780	I don't think there's been one in a while.
3538780	3539780	There were a few.
3539780	3542740	They're like, ah, fuck it, no one's buying them, you know.
3542800	3547280	It was like Xevious and Urban Champion and like all these, you know, interesting ones,
3547280	3549200	but I haven't seen one in a little while.
3551200	3551700	Anyhow.
3553000	3556000	Yeah, I thought, I thought we were gonna get like Zelda and 3D and stuff.
3556000	3557000	I guess not.
3557000	3558000	I guess it was too hard.
3558000	3560680	Anyway, back to what I was originally going to talk about, a Wii game coming out on the
3560680	3561680	Wii U.
3561680	3567200	XSeed has decided to bring over Pandora's Tower to the Wii.
3567200	3572520	Now this is important because this was the last Operation Rainfall, you guys remember
3572520	3577540	that, those last of the three Op Rainfall games that, you know, Nintendo was never going
3577540	3581540	to bring over here and then they finally brought out Xenoblade Chronicles, although it had
3581540	3586860	that horrible, horrible GameStop exclusive thing, but you could order it from Nintendo.com,
3586860	3587860	whatever.
3587860	3590980	They, XSeed brought out The Last Story, which did very well for them.
3590980	3596540	So now XSeed seems to be kind of our champion, that is kind of, didn't you predict that somebody
3596540	3599620	like them might be the ones that ultimately step up and do this like a while ago?
3599620	3600620	No.
3600620	3603200	It's easier Ignition or XS game localization.
3603200	3605860	So here they go, they're stepping up and putting out Pandora's Tower.
3605860	3610980	Now it's going to be interesting to see how this does when the Wii U is what's really
3610980	3615460	being pushed right now, but a lot of folks thought that Last Story, when it got price
3615460	3620560	cuts 20 bucks, made a great pickup game for people to get with the Wii U, because again,
3620560	3621880	you know, why not?
3621880	3624560	You can use the backwards compatibility, very easy.
3624560	3627680	So, any interest in Pandora's Tower, Loki?
3627680	3628680	No.
3628740	3630240	Too late?
3630240	3634340	I don't play anything on my Wii, and actually it's funny, we booted up the Wii because Nelly
3634340	3636560	was going to like play some more Animal Crossing.
3636560	3642020	So I charged, I charged our controllers and...
3642020	3643020	Animal Crossing.
3643020	3644020	Sorry, I'm eating.
3644020	3645700	Animal Crossing is on 3DS.
3645700	3646700	That's a game coming out.
3646700	3647700	No.
3647700	3648780	But it's not dated.
3648780	3649780	It's out in Japan.
3649780	3654000	Yeah, that's a fourth quarter game, that's going to be sad that it's gotten that delayed.
3654000	3655320	I don't think it can be.
3655320	3657380	It's got to be sooner than that.
3657380	3659940	Probably, could be a May game.
3659940	3660940	We'll see.
3660940	3665860	But I mean, seriously though, we forgot all about it because it was that, you know, highly
3665860	3669700	anticipated that we completely forgot about the game.
3669700	3671700	I don't know.
3671700	3675820	What's it called?
3675820	3678740	Animal Crossing Jump Out or something like that?
3678740	3679740	Animal Crossing Jump Out.
3679740	3684260	No, it's like Animal Crossing, it's the same fucking game on 3DS.
3684260	3685260	I don't know.
3685260	3686260	Occupy Nooks.
3686260	3687260	I wish.
3687260	3688260	That'd be great.
3688260	3689260	That would be great.
3689260	3690260	All right.
3690260	3691260	Moving on.
3691260	3692260	More news.
3692260	3696660	Well, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.
3696660	3699340	Now you know that you play as Raiden in that, right?
3699340	3705180	Well, that's not what Kojima originally wanted, but he did let go of the story writing so
3705180	3707220	that he could focus on production.
3707220	3714100	He wanted it to be Gray Fox, who, as we all know from Metal Gear Solid, and he was a character
3714100	3720520	that had a lot of crap happen to him and a very, very crazy story if you'd followed
3720520	3725940	the MSX Metal Gear games and, you know, really were a fan of the series.
3725940	3729500	But he said, no, we're going to let the kids play, and they went Raiden, and they went
3729500	3732820	hack and slash, so let's go with Raiden.
3732820	3736620	It would have been so awesome to have a game with Gray Fox, don't you think?
3736620	3740420	Instead, he gets stepped on by Metal Gear Pooh.
3740420	3741420	Sad trombone.
3741420	3747500	You know, it's funny, I actually forgot to mention, I played Anarchy Reigns during my
3747500	3750460	game week this week, and it was very subpar.
3750460	3751460	Really?
3751460	3758220	Which sad me, because I love Platinum Games, and it was just, it was a mess.
3758220	3759900	It just not set up well at all.
3759900	3763980	I mean, there's no story, which is fine, I find no story being in there, but it was confusing
3763980	3767900	on what the hell he had to do, and the gameplay was just kind of like, eh.
3767900	3770420	It was like, Madworld was so much better.
3770420	3775300	Why is, you know, Jack having to do this crap?
3775300	3779620	Jack's fun to play in HD though, it was fun to play as that character, but it's just,
3779620	3781140	I just didn't know what the fuck was going on.
3781140	3785780	But I hope that that's not the case with Metal Gear Rising, but I think Metal Gear Rising
3785780	3786780	looks pretty awesome.
3786780	3791380	Well, also there was a comment regarding the trailer that might be Metal Gear Solid 5,
3791380	3792380	The Phantom Pain.
3792380	3793380	Oh yeah, that thing.
3793380	3798580	Yeah, Kojima said that he really liked the trailer and the lighting, it was very good.
3799580	3800580	Oh, you.
3800580	3805580	Metal Gear Rising Revengeance is gonna be out on February 22nd, so keep your eyes open
3805580	3807580	if you are interested.
3807580	3811580	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out very
3811580	3812580	soon.
3812580	3814180	There's not much this week.
3814180	3820940	It's pretty much just Ni No Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch on PS3 this week, which is
3820940	3821940	not bad.
3821940	3824300	I mean, it's supposed to be a pretty awesome PlayStation 3 game.
3824300	3829100	Yeah, I want to check that out, but I don't know about the 60 bucks, though.
3829100	3831900	I think I might rent it or wait for President.
3831900	3833220	The reviews have said it's been worth it.
3833220	3834220	Really?
3834220	3839380	I mean, they said it's basically, what was the comparison I had?
3839380	3843180	It was Dragon Quest with all the stuff that you hated from Dragon Quest ripped out of
3843180	3844180	it.
3844180	3845180	Huh.
3845180	3848140	So, you know, that sounds pretty awesome.
3848140	3849340	The demo didn't convince me.
3849340	3852340	I didn't hate it like Bobby did, but it didn't convince me.
3852340	3855460	Although the graphics were great.
3855460	3859540	The only other thing that's coming out this week is a Sims 3 expansion pack, 70s, 80s,
3859540	3860540	and 90s stuff.
3860540	3865620	Do people still play Sims 3?
3865620	3866620	Somebody must be.
3866620	3870020	They still have a ton of fucking expansions coming out for the thing, so I don't understand
3870020	3871020	why.
3871020	3872020	Go to Ford.
3872020	3873020	And also, apparently, that's it.
3873020	3877260	Alright, going to Japan, Hitman Absolution on the Xbox 360.
3877260	3881220	Yes, this is the Japanese version, making its way out on January 24th, as well as a
3881220	3884820	game called Instant Brain, but that's a price reduction that was already out before.
3884820	3888700	That is going into Cave, the best series, because that is a cave game.
3888700	3889700	Those are the Xbox 360.
3889700	3893060	Going to the PlayStation 3, things are a little bit bigger over there.
3893060	3896940	Nobunaga Yoyobu online 10th anniversary box.
3896940	3899800	I had no idea Nobunaga online was 10 years old, but there you go.
3899800	3901700	That is out on the PlayStation 3 this week.
3901700	3903620	Also Hitman Absolution there.
3903620	3907620	Bleach Soul Ignition getting a price reduction as far as new games go.
3907620	3916220	Heavy Fire Shattered Spear and Kamisama to Unmekikakume no Paradox in regular and limited
3916220	3919060	edition and a Famitsu pack limited edition.
3919060	3920060	That's god something.
3920060	3923740	I'm trying to see, let's see if this is a game that we know over here.
3923740	3926860	Oh, hold on, we wouldn't know that from the limited edition art.
3926860	3928500	Let me look at regular edition.
3928500	3931940	I'm trying to see if this is a game I recognize at all.
3931940	3934340	I don't recognize it with the box art.
3934780	3937700	Oh, it looks like a Disgaea Tactics-y type of game.
3937700	3939900	Yeah, it's a Tactics game.
3939900	3941300	I bet it's based on anime or something.
3941300	3942300	With maids.
3942300	3943300	Some of you in chat will know.
3943300	3944300	Well, of course.
3944300	3945300	Yeah.
3945300	3948020	Somebody in chat, I bet, knows more about that.
3948020	3949020	Mag.
3949020	3950020	Remember Mag?
3950020	3951020	Is also getting a price reduction.
3951020	3952380	Goes into PlayStation 3 the best.
3952380	3954820	Again, those are Japanese releases.
3954820	3956260	Look at the handhelds really quick.
3956260	3961060	On the PlayStation Vita, pretty busy week actually, Demon Gaze.
3961060	3968460	Yankai Totsuki Monster Monpiece, as well as Sakurosou no Pet no Kanojo.
3968460	3970700	I'm assuming that's a pet sim game.
3970700	3971700	All on the Vita.
3971700	3972700	I don't know.
3972700	3974500	It sounds about little girls.
3974500	3976700	On the Wii U, nothing.
3976700	3980340	No more Wii U games until January 31st is the next one.
3980340	3984540	On the Nintendo 3DS, however, ooh, also nothing.
3984540	3986300	Nothing really on the 3DS.
3986300	3990940	Nintendo has very little activity over there until February 7th is the Dragon Quest VII
3990940	3991820	remake.
3991820	3995580	I'm sure a lot of people will be very excited about that on the 3DS, which I can't imagine
3995580	3996860	they won't bring that over here.
3996860	3999380	Nintendo's having a nap.
3999380	4000380	Maybe a little bit.
4000380	4001380	So there you go.
4001380	4002380	Those are your Japanese releases.
4002380	4004380	Well, we only have two things for the UK.
4004380	4008380	On the 24th, we have Strike Suit Zero and the 25th Devil May Cry.
4008380	4009700	Ah, yes.
4009700	4011260	Devil May Cry.
4011260	4012260	That came out this week.
4012260	4013260	Yeah.
4013260	4014260	I want to check it out.
4014260	4015260	I do.
4015260	4016260	All right.
4016260	4019220	A couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.
4019220	4020220	Up first.
4020220	4021220	Loki.
4021220	4022220	All right.
4022220	4023220	So let's talk about Majesco.
4023220	4029580	Now, Majesco is, I would say, not long for this world anymore.
4029580	4033660	And they've, you know, definitely had some problems.
4033660	4041120	The company experienced a loss of 2.7 million as compared to, I guess, the 3.9 million loss
4041120	4043020	the previous year.
4043020	4051700	And they said the revenues are up to 132.3 million, but concluded with a net income of
4051700	4054440	4.6 million down 2 million from last year.
4054440	4058660	And let's be honest here, Majesco, they don't have a lot of games that they release anymore.
4058660	4062580	Cookie Mama is not selling like it used to.
4062580	4064680	Their last say, need investing mama, right?
4064680	4066860	Was that the joke you made on Twitter?
4066860	4070100	I don't remember.
4070100	4071280	But I mean, come on.
4071280	4077120	This is the company that decided that, hey, NBA Baller Beats is a good idea.
4077120	4083920	So really, I mean, looking forward to what they have, they've only really got, they have
4083920	4086120	the Young Justice license.
4086120	4089440	So they've got that game coming out at the end of February.
4089440	4093960	But I mean, Majesco is not one of those companies that puts out these really huge AAA games
4093960	4094960	anymore.
4094960	4095960	They just don't.
4095960	4102680	And so it is kind of risky for them, because if these kind of non AAA titles don't sell
4102680	4105160	well, then it kind of sucks for them.
4105160	4110040	I mean, maybe Zumba is not selling as well as it used to, because I know they have Zumba.
4110040	4114280	That's their kind of big license right now.
4114280	4115960	But I don't know.
4115960	4117240	No Zumba for the Wii U, I guess.
4117240	4119040	So I mean, that's what's hurting them.
4119040	4123320	So you talking about that made me look, I'm like, how much is NBA Baller Beats right now?
4123320	4125200	Thirty four bucks on Amazon.
4125200	4126680	Not going to fucking buy it.
4126680	4128360	That's the game with the basketball.
4128360	4132880	I am sitting here going, I bet I could pry that one from my boss.
4132880	4135040	He's still got it in the packaging at his work.
4135040	4137280	It's just sitting there because it's about to bring it over.
4137280	4138580	Let's do some live gameplay stream.
4138580	4141840	Who wants to watch League of Legends when you can watch NBA Baller Beats?
4141840	4142840	Come on.
4142840	4145080	Uh, we'll get Dark Soccer to play one.
4145080	4148160	We'll call it two white guys play NBA Baller Beats.
4148160	4149160	I'll play.
4149160	4150160	There we go.
4150160	4152520	There are no ballers and no beats.
4152520	4156440	White men can't baller or beats.
4156440	4158080	Plenty of white guys can beat.
4158080	4159080	All right.
4159080	4164640	And then, of course, their stock closed down under one dollar.
4164640	4166160	They're down the 75 cents.
4166160	4168720	So hey, if you think they're going to make a comeback, maybe it's something to buy some
4168720	4169720	Majesco stock.
4169720	4170720	75 cents.
4170720	4172720	That's not bad.
4172720	4176040	I wish it was much easier to just go online and buy some stock because I think it'll be
4176040	4180440	fun to just go buy like, you know, 10 shares of Majesco just to say like, hey, I own part
4180440	4181960	of Majesco.
4181960	4185400	And then at the next shareholder meeting, you know, we can hold whoever accountable
4185400	4188840	came up with NBA Baller Beats, although supposedly the game is fun.
4188840	4189840	I should knock it.
4189840	4190840	I haven't really played it.
4190840	4194160	So they're going to try football one next.
4194160	4200800	I don't know how that would even work.
4200800	4204920	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Launch Radio on Vogue Network
4204920	4207520	dot com, use the passphrase yogurt.
4207520	4208800	All right.
4208800	4210540	Uh, one more story here.
4210540	4213220	This is about the next PlayStation controller.
4213220	4216780	You know, we had some rumors about this already, but now there's good.
4216780	4217780	There's more rumors.
4217780	4218780	No, no, no.
4218780	4219780	That's good.
4219780	4221020	They're just using this to illustrate the whole story.
4221020	4222020	It is not the boomerang.
4222020	4223020	People.
4223020	4224020	It is not the boomer.
4224020	4225020	It's coming back like a boomerang.
4225020	4230620	But well, remember, remember when the boomerang thing was for the PlayStation three and everybody
4230620	4234180	was like, no, that could have been comfortable.
4234180	4235180	Who knows?
4235180	4239940	I'm actually like, I mean, it looks so ridiculous.
4239940	4243420	So bad, you know, it looks so ridiculous, but maybe it was comfortable.
4243420	4244420	I mean, I don't know.
4244420	4246420	It doesn't look like it would be very comfortable to me.
4246420	4247420	Well, whatever.
4247420	4248420	It's gone.
4248420	4249420	Okay.
4249420	4250420	But now.
4250420	4251420	Okay.
4251420	4252420	So we've heard about this move thing that might like actually be like a transformer
4252420	4256020	and won't won't won't into the controller, right?
4256020	4261580	But that's not what the latest rumors are, apparently, uh, according to a senior game
4261580	4268100	studio in a conversation with CVG, uh, Sony is going to mix up the dual shock design.
4268100	4272980	There's going to be biometric sensors on the grips and an LCD touch screen because,
4272980	4276340	you know, that's, that's what everything's got to have now is a fricking touch screen.
4276340	4281100	Um, apparently they are trying to emulate the same user interface philosophies as the
4281100	4283180	PlayStation Vita.
4283180	4286340	Look, I like the Vita and all.
4286340	4287340	Okay.
4287340	4288340	The touch screen's cool.
4288340	4292100	The two analog sticks are cool, but the rear touch pad, let it go.
4292100	4294100	Stop trying to make rear touch pad happen.
4294100	4295100	Stop.
4296100	4299860	Don't you understand that reaching around is like, you know, it has some bad connotations
4299860	4300860	to that.
4300860	4307060	I mean, it's just even in DJ max, people who really like reaching around, even in DJ max,
4307060	4309420	which I think does it better than most of the Vita games.
4309420	4314060	Like I'm just like, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off.
4314060	4319940	Anyhow, I can get, I thought for a second there, there were, instead of, you know, leading
4319940	4324460	up to, Oh yeah, we're doing all the, we're mimicking the control interface of the Vita.
4324460	4327300	It was going to be, we're maybe in the control interface of the Wii U.
4327300	4331820	I mean, cause that's basically, it's like, ah, we can't think of anything to do.
4331820	4336460	So we're going to try to emulate Nintendo because we think they're, we don't even know
4336460	4338700	if that stuff's going to even take off on the Wii U.
4338700	4342820	I mean, it's just, and I thought the whole thing is you wanted to push the Vita because,
4342820	4345860	Hey, the Vita could be a second screen for these consoles or something.
4345860	4348300	You need a reason to sell these things.
4348300	4353500	Now, let's not say this would be a pretty awesome thing if they decide, Hey, the next
4353540	4357660	gen console, it is going to be the Wii U that's going to be, or yeah, it is going to be Wii
4357660	4357660	
4357660	4361100	No, it's going to be the Vita that they throw into the box.
4361100	4366260	Like it comes with a Vita, you've got a Vita and you've got the PlayStation four, boom,
4366260	4367700	right there, portable.
4367700	4372260	And you know, you've got your console and you can take your controller when you go.
4372260	4373820	I mean, cause I'm wrong.
4373820	4378780	I bet it'd be pretty awesome if you could take that Wii U game tablet and stream games
4378780	4381900	from a wifi spot somewhere else in the world.
4382140	4385740	Kinda already do with the PlayStation three and the PSP for God's sake.
4385740	4385980	Yeah.
4385980	4390820	So wouldn't it be kind of awesome if you could do that or if you could, you know, play virtual
4390820	4392340	console games on there, you can take that.
4392340	4396900	I mean, it's a little bit big, but come on PS one classics and PS two classics, I'm talking
4396900	4399460	about like the Wii U I'm just saying, you know, wouldn't it be awesome if you could
4399460	4400500	do that with the Wii U controller?
4400820	4406060	Um, you know, like, and again, it's pretty big, but people carry tablets around, so why
4406060	4406260	not?
4406740	4407020	All right.
4407020	4411660	Regardless of whether this current rumor is factor crap or whatever, do you, how do you
4411660	4416540	feel about them redesigning the dual shock for all practical purposes at the point we're
4416540	4420220	at now throwing out the six axis and everything, you know, the PlayStation three controller
4420220	4425260	you get now is a very tiny evolution from the original PlayStation controller.
4425260	4427500	I mean, really, I mean, granted.
4427500	4427820	Okay.
4427820	4430140	I guess the analog sticks came a little later.
4430140	4434140	The very, very first PlayStation controllers didn't have them, but still the, the, the
4434860	4439420	core of that controller has not changed that much since the beginning.
4439420	4441580	It's like, if it's, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
4441580	4443660	I mean, seriously, I, I like the design now.
4443660	4446620	So how do you feel about biometric sensors?
4446620	4447420	I don't give a shit.
4448380	4452540	I think it's honestly, I'll stick with my PC gaming regardless.
4452540	4456060	I think it's gonna be a gimmick if biometric sensors are on the six axis.
4456860	4461260	Um, yeah, it is a gimmick, but you know, it's a gimmick that also a lot of cell phone games
4461260	4465900	and a lot of stuff, you know, uses, uh, yeah, no one really uses six axis anymore, but even
4465980	4469900	like, it seems like a lot of the stuff that Sony has been doing lately has just been to
4469900	4474540	kind of mimic, I mean, cause even with the, we, everybody got into the emotion gaming
4474540	4478700	right after the, we, Oh yeah, we've been working on the move controller since, you know, a
4478700	4479580	long time ago.
4479580	4481100	You know, come on.
4481100	4482460	It just, it never took off.
4482460	4485820	And now, you know, some of these patents that we see look really ridiculous.
4485820	4489340	I mean, no one's going to fucking strap move controllers to your feet and do like a flip
4489340	4490780	kick in your goddamn living room.
4490780	4491580	No, it's going to do that.
4492460	4496060	So they need to come up with a new, they need to come up with something new.
4496060	4497580	They need to come out with the wow factor.
4497580	4501260	Cause if you're fucking emulating someone else or doing the same shit you're doing now,
4501260	4502140	no one's going to care.
4502140	4503980	No one's going to be like, why do I have to buy this?
4503980	4505660	I can already fucking do that now.
4505660	4508620	That's really what it comes down to is the wow factor.
4508620	4510380	That's what's going to sell your console.
4510380	4511180	All right.
4511180	4514540	Let's travel back in time to a time when you know what?
4514540	4517420	The controller, it was a stick and a button and you liked it.
4517420	4517980	That's it.
4517980	4519260	One stick, one button.
4519260	4520700	Hey, we have more buttons for this one.
4520700	4521020	All right.
4521100	4525100	Maybe this game isn't quite that old, but it's still a classic.
4525100	4529180	So let's dive into the gaming vault where dark soccer is going to pick out an oldie
4529180	4532700	moldy video game and say, Hey, play it.
4532700	4533820	Cause it's cool.
4533820	4535020	You probably forgot about it.
4535020	4535900	It is a cool one.
4535900	4537660	And probably not many people have seen it.
4538380	4543660	Um, the classic game, um, in Japan was called, um, Zexex.
4543660	4545260	I think I'm pronouncing it right.
4545260	4547740	Cause it's X E X E X over here.
4547740	4549420	We had it as Oreos.
4549420	4554060	It was, uh, it came out in 1991, a side schooling shooting game, and it was actually really
4554060	4555260	unique for its time.
4556060	4560700	Uh, Konami was really influenced by a lot of stuff that, um, Irem put out.
4560700	4564620	It actually has the influences from R-Type, which everyone knows R-Type is among one of
4564620	4565820	my favorite games.
4565820	4572620	And, um, the tentacle mechanics that came from X-Multiply, it did not at all get a home
4572620	4578220	release until it came out with Salamander portable that came out on the PSP, which,
4578220	4581260	um, somebody in this room enabled me to get that game for my husband.
4581260	4581980	Thank you, Loki.
4583260	4588220	Um, it actually, it's, it's really, really an amazing shooter.
4588220	4594140	Um, it had some, um, really, um, interesting, um, mechanics.
4594140	4599900	Um, what happened with this one, like I said, it's similar to R-Type and X-Multiply.
4599900	4605260	You play a ship called the flintlock that has this detachable orb called a flint and
4605260	4607820	it acts sort of like, um, R-Type's force.
4607820	4615180	Um, so you can get power ups to, uh, uh, boost, uh, Flint's power, your movement, your, uh,
4615180	4617180	changing your weapon, increase your life count.
4617980	4622220	But, um, there are a bunch of changes that came out though in the non-Japanese versions.
4622220	4627020	Um, some of them being, they removed all but one of the upgradable weapons and they changed
4627020	4627900	the enemy patterns.
4628460	4634780	Um, for different weapons, um, in, in the US, um, there was only the proton laser.
4635420	4640620	Um, in the Japanese version, you start with a proton laser and then you get a homing laser,
4640620	4646220	a shadow laser, a round laser, a spiral laser, which is a lot like the Gradius ripple, um,
4646220	4649820	a search laser that's a kind of like a homing laser and a ground laser.
4650780	4656860	It's very similar to, um, the, uh, the fire one that would travel across the floor from R-Type.
4657980	4661900	And so basically the story of the game, you have to save the princess named Irene from
4661900	4667020	the East, uh, from the planet East Square from an evil dude named Klaus.
4667020	4670860	And there's different cut scenes and she's crying for help and she's tortured.
4670860	4677420	And so you have to, um, basically, uh, go through the game and there's naked people
4677420	4678860	in the ending of the game, just saying.
4679820	4687660	But, but the big thing about, um, Zexix that I thought was really
4687660	4693180	amazing and Rob, you can see this right in front of you, is, um, the level design.
4693180	4697660	I mean, for 1991, I mean, this, the backgrounds look like shit right out of Tron.
4697660	4701820	I mean, seriously, you've got, uh, very.
4701820	4703580	Well, I like the little tentacle shots.
4703580	4706700	The thing does like it shoots out of these little 10.
4706700	4708940	I actually had never really heard of this game.
4708940	4715740	So Zexix is a really, I definitely see the Gradius inspired-ness in it, but, um,
4715740	4720700	but a lot of the, the use of the flint is definitely like using the Force and R-Type.
4721420	4725580	Um, the game is actually pretty challenging.
4725580	4727180	It's a really difficult game.
4727180	4733260	And, um, I thankfully got to play, um, a copy, uh, a while back off of the Supergun.
4734460	4737820	Um, so this was ages ago.
4737820	4742700	I mean, this is actually a game that I don't know if it's, um, if they've gotten it to
4742700	4747820	work on MAME yet, I'd have to check because Zexix is like, it's seriously one of the classics
4747820	4749340	when it comes to, to shooters.
4749340	4755580	It's not a bullet hell, definitely by any means, but it requires a lot of steady, um,
4755580	4760060	movement, a lot of, uh, really good reflex to make your way through it.
4760060	4762380	And it's just an amazing game.
4762380	4767740	So I would say, um, unfortunately, the only way to get ahold of it for any type of home
4767740	4771340	version is getting the, um, PSP version.
4771340	4777980	It's, uh, again, under the, um, Salamander portable, uh, and it's also, you can find
4777980	4780300	this really inexpensive for PSP.
4780300	4781180	It didn't cost a lot.
4781180	4785980	I think when I bought it new, it was like 30 bucks and that's, you know, an import.
4785980	4788460	And of course there's no region lockout on the PSP.
4789260	4792060	So the chatters are saying it is in MAME.
4792060	4795740	If you want to, if you want to turn to the dark side of the internet where everybody
4795740	4799260	left, well, I haven't touched anything on MAME in ages.
4799260	4803580	Dan and I are probably going to be making a new cab soon, but, um, but seriously, if
4803580	4807900	anyone loves shooting games and especially if you're a fan of Konami shooters and love
4807900	4810780	Irem shooters, you really owe it to yourself to play this one.
4810780	4812060	ZEC6 is a great game.
4813900	4814940	And that's it.
4815660	4815980	All right.
4815980	4816460	There it is.
4816460	4817980	Your classic game of the week.
4817980	4818480	ZEC6.
4819980	4821180	Over here it was called Orius.
4821980	4822860	Or Orius.
4822860	4826540	If you happen to find an arcade cab of it, take a picture of it for me, please.
4827580	4828380	All right.
4828860	4833980	We are going to come back after a quick break here with more of Orange Lounge Radio, including
4833980	4837580	a game we've talked about a bit here on Orange Lounge Radio, finally official this week.
4837580	4841340	We're going to talk about Disney Infinity when we come back with more of Orange Lounge
4841340	4843100	Radio right after this.
4849340	4856300	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live with the 490th episode of our program
4856940	4860620	for this January the 20th of 2013.
4860620	4864140	I hope those of you guys that have an extended weekend here in the States make the most of
4864140	4864620	it.
4864620	4868140	Let's let us not forget, though, the memory of Martin Luther King Jr.
4868780	4871420	The reason why we have the weekend.
4871420	4875180	In fact, I was going to play the I have a dream speech during the break tonight, but
4875180	4877660	it's like 18 minutes, which is a little bit long for a break.
4877660	4882780	But I encourage you all, you know, just as a little reminder of, uh, you know, what we've
4882780	4885260	been through, uh, take a listen to it.
4885980	4889740	Uh, also, uh, I wanted to talk getting back to games a little bit.
4889740	4893260	I promised, um, at the start of Part B because I forgot to talk about this during my gaming
4893260	4893660	week.
4893660	4896460	I want to talk about Wake Up Club on the PlayStation Vita.
4896460	4898220	Have you guys heard about this game?
4898220	4899900	And I use that term very loosely.
4899900	4903820	Have you guys have you guys heard that a game at all or play they played that game?
4903820	4904700	Heard about it?
4904700	4906140	Anybody know?
4906140	4908300	Okay, so I downloaded it today.
4908300	4909500	Did you have you checked it out at all?
4909500	4909900	No.
4909900	4910460	Okay.
4910460	4914780	It's this app for the PlayStation Vita, and it basically, you know, you can choose, you
4914780	4920220	know, from these different skins that are alarm clocks or whatever, like, um, you know,
4920220	4923900	like a motor storm background or a journey background or whatever.
4923900	4927020	And, you know, you can do the little alarm clock, but what you do is that when you're
4927020	4930620	on the clock, you tell it what time you want to get up or whatever you put it to sleep.
4930620	4935260	And then what happens is in the morning, it goes off, beep, beep, beep or whatever.
4935260	4939180	And you have to actually tap your icon, which is moving around the screen.
4939180	4940140	You have to tap it.
4940140	4942460	And that signals to it that you've woken up.
4942540	4947340	Now, what happens is that you've been paired up with 12 people who are getting up the same
4947340	4948300	time issue.
4948300	4953580	And so once you wake up, you can basically tap other people and it will send, I guess
4953580	4955100	it sends noises to their Vita.
4955100	4958620	I don't, I've always been the first one up, so I don't know what happens, but like, I
4958620	4962380	guess you tap the other icons and actually sends like voices to their Vita and tries
4962380	4962860	to get them up.
4962860	4965020	So it's like this whole like social network game.
4965580	4966620	Wake up.
4966620	4967020	Exactly.
4967020	4967820	Wake up.
4967820	4968700	Wake up.
4968700	4970460	So calling it a game is a little weird.
4970460	4977180	It's more of an app, but I got to say like taunted all you want, but the gamification
4977180	4980700	of an alarm clock is a pretty neat idea.
4980700	4981420	I've got to say.
4981980	4987980	And why, especially this is interesting on the Vita is that if you think about it, this
4987980	4993500	gives people a reason to remember they have a Vita for real.
4993500	4997020	I mean, there hasn't been a whole lot on the PlayStation Vita that like people have
4997020	4998460	gotten that excited about.
4998460	5002700	And I'm not saying like wake up club is the Vita system saver.
5002700	5007980	No, nobody's going to buy a Vita just for silly wake up club, but something that gets
5007980	5015580	the PlayStation Vita into your daily routine is a really smart move on Sony's part.
5015580	5017500	I don't know if I'm giving them too much credit.
5018460	5021900	Like if they really thought that that's what they were going to try to do, but if that
5021900	5026220	was what they were going for, well played thoughts.
5026940	5031180	I can see how it would be interesting and definitely it's a way to keep the Vita in
5031180	5036060	the, like you said, putting it in someone's daily routine will keep it constantly in their
5036060	5036460	eye.
5036460	5039820	You know, like my, for example, I know it's not exactly the same, but having my iPhone,
5039820	5040860	it's my alarm clock.
5041580	5045580	You know, I keep in touch with my family through it, you know, texting all the time.
5045580	5047740	I even use it at work now with text write off.
5047740	5052700	But, but I mean, I'm saying, you know, it's, it's something that's part of my routine.
5052700	5055740	So trying to incorporate the Vita as part of someone's routine actually gives people
5056380	5059100	fresh and keeps it in the user's eyes.
5059100	5061500	So they'll want to use it more often.
5061500	5062940	I can see the logic behind it.
5062940	5064460	I mean, and they gamified it.
5064460	5068220	It's got trophies and you see the ranking of where you wake up.
5068220	5069580	Well, now that's just silly.
5069580	5072140	I know it's, it's a little silly, but it's silly.
5072140	5076700	You know, it's more exciting than the iPhone alarm clock or the one that sits on your
5076700	5078300	wall and goes, yep.
5078300	5081820	But my iPhone alarm clock wakes me up to I'm sexy and I know it.
5083020	5083820	Okay, that's true.
5083820	5085340	I guess, I guess the Vita can't do that.
5085820	5087580	You can make kitty noises.
5087580	5088380	You can't have that.
5088380	5090300	I can have kitty noises on my iPhone too.
5090300	5095980	I can download a ringtone, but I can't necessarily, you know, wake other people up with it except
5095980	5096700	for my husband.
5097900	5102940	Now I will say in my experience with wake up club, I still suffer from the rollover
5103740	5106700	hit it to wake up, wake up the other people.
5106700	5107100	All right.
5107100	5108380	And then I go, it's cold.
5108380	5109260	I'm going back to bed.
5110220	5112460	You know, you made me, it hasn't really made me get up.
5112460	5113980	You made me think of the alarm clock.
5113980	5116860	Now that requires people to stand on it, to turn it off.
5116860	5117740	Oh my God.
5117740	5122140	And so I saw pictures on Tumblr of people like laying half in their bed with their face
5122140	5124940	on the alarm clock to register the pressure.
5124940	5125980	And they're still asleep.
5125980	5126860	See, that would be me.
5126860	5128300	I learned how to do it in my sleep.
5128300	5130140	I turn off my iPhone all the time in my sleep.
5130140	5133100	I need the Vita to give me an electric shock to really wake me up.
5134940	5135820	Oh God.
5135820	5138220	No, no, not the sounds of my mother waking me up.
5138220	5138940	Rab.
5138940	5139260	Rab.
5139260	5140380	You're going to be late for work.
5140380	5141100	Rab.
5141100	5141580	That's it.
5141580	5142300	That's what you need.
5142300	5144940	If you get fired from your job, Rab, you're going to be homeless.
5144940	5146780	Rab, you are not moving in here Rab.
5147500	5148220	Rab.
5148220	5149020	That's it.
5149020	5149660	That's it.
5149660	5150780	That's the, okay.
5150780	5153980	This is a copyright orange on radio and me and Rab.
5155180	5157980	This is your mom, the alarm clock.
5158860	5160140	That's what we need to invent Rab.
5160140	5161180	Your mom, the alarm clock.
5163100	5166620	All it is is whoever's mother going, get out of bed.
5166620	5167740	It's time for school.
5167740	5172460	No, actually at my house would be this and I have to hold this away.
5173340	5176140	Jamie get out of bed.
5176140	5183260	Now my throat hurts extra bad, but that would have been, um, my mom when I was in school.
5183260	5184780	Neighbors are going to call the police.
5184780	5185900	Sorry, Rab's neighbors.
5190140	5190540	All right.
5191340	5191740	That was my mom.
5191740	5192780	That's wake up club.
5192780	5194140	I just wanted to throw that out there.
5194140	5195820	It is, it is a thing that happened this week.
5195820	5198620	I forgot to talk about it because it's a game, but it's not.
5198620	5203180	But you know, again, and Raginator in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, yeah,
5203180	5204780	Rab, way too much credit.
5205660	5209820	Whether it was a moment of genius amongst idiocy.
5209820	5210860	I don't know.
5210860	5216700	But all I'm saying is that if the Vita thinks of more things like this, let's gamify things
5216700	5217500	that people do.
5218140	5223500	How about like an interactive cookbook, a recipe thing like, you know, recipes for bachelors.
5224380	5230380	I would have to grow arms and smack my hand every time I say, I wonder what it'd be like
5230380	5231900	if I put this in it.
5231900	5232700	I can't bake.
5233900	5234460	All right.
5234460	5235740	Uh, let's go to some rapid fire news.
5235740	5238700	Talk about some other video game news happening around the industry right now.
5238700	5239900	I'm sorry for Rab's neighbors.
5240700	5241260	It's all right.
5241260	5241740	They'll deal.
5241740	5242460	Logie.
5242460	5243340	All right.
5243340	5248540	Um, so let's talk a little bit about, uh, the survey that they sent out for call of
5248540	5255260	duty and it's kind of, um, hinting at some stuff that may be available, um, for the next,
5255980	5261580	uh, iteration of it and includes like stuff, you know, saying, Hey, what kind of special
5261580	5263180	things do you want at retail?
5263180	5267420	So some of the stuff that, um, was, they came out of there, they were seeing a care package
5267420	5268460	show pieces.
5268460	5272540	Um, some of the things that they may include with the care package edition would be like
5272540	5273980	a character of statuette.
5274060	5278860	They send operational desktop century gun replica, which sounds fucking awesome.
5278860	5280460	I would totally dig that.
5280460	5284700	And then, um, there's a collectible sets featuring characters, vehicles, and scenery from the
5284700	5290540	game, similar to like the hago or the halo mega block stuff, custom branded audio sound
5290540	5297500	bar, lame custom branded gaming headset, also lame and custom branded wireless router.
5298780	5303340	No, just don't operational desktop century gun.
5303340	5305180	There's your winning, uh, pick right there.
5306140	5308060	And, uh, they had some other pictures from it.
5308060	5312620	Of course they took them down because of NDA, uh, they're saying also that, um, you know,
5312620	5316300	that there might be a digital version to pre download to your console and then it'll be
5316300	5321820	available to play at 1201 am on launch day, which is kind of cool if they did that.
5321820	5326140	Um, and it says maybe that'll be something that'll be featured in next gen consoles,
5326140	5330380	being able to kind of pre download stuff like you can on steam, like steamer or a world
5330380	5332060	of Warcraft did that with the expansions.
5332060	5333900	Honestly, I don't know why they can't do that.
5333900	5337900	I mean, they've got day one patches, you know, and stuff.
5338860	5339900	Well, let me put this away.
5339900	5344220	Day one patches might not be a good way to go because let's say for example, you do that.
5344220	5349020	Um, yeah, cause if they did with the console version, um, and you weren't able to connect
5349020	5350780	online, it would never be able to play your game.
5350780	5355500	But let's just say that they were able to lock that out to just the digital version.
5355500	5355980	Why not?
5355980	5361100	Why not have it built in where you can download the game and then piracy, you know, piracy
5361100	5363580	is gone as far as print link before a release.
5364700	5365260	I don't know.
5365260	5365980	Sounds like a good idea.
5366860	5371180	Um, and then there's some, um, pretty good news here.
5371180	5379580	Uh, Skyrim, all the wonderful, uh, DLC that you've been missing on the PS3.
5379580	5380940	It's finally coming.
5380940	5386540	Um, Dragonborn, the latest expansion for the game, it's going to be hitting PC on February
5386540	5391820	5th and then, uh, also in February, all the other expansions are going to be coming out
5391820	5394620	as well on, uh, PS3.
5394620	5399020	And I believe they're even offering them at half cost for the first.
5399020	5399900	Sorry, it's late.
5400620	5401100	Sorry.
5402060	5402700	It's not bad.
5402700	5409100	I bought, I bought them all half off on, um, on PC and building the house and hearth fire
5409100	5411660	is kind of cool, I guess.
5411660	5412460	Um, I don't know.
5412460	5416380	I don't like the orphan kids saying, you know, Hey, you can adopt me.
5416860	5419100	No, I'm not going to adopt you.
5419100	5422060	Cause if it goes anything like Fable was, I never came home.
5422060	5424140	And you can't kill the kids cause that's wrong.
5425260	5427260	And you can't even do that in Skyrim.
5427260	5429900	Although I'm sure, I'm sure somebody hacked it in.
5429900	5432060	I'm sure some sicko hacked it.
5432060	5434140	Of course you can do it on the PC.
5434140	5436540	You see what PC gaming supports Dark Sakura?
5437580	5438700	I wasn't paying attention.
5438700	5439260	Sorry.
5439260	5439980	Killing children.
5441100	5443980	And for some reason, when I'd leave all of the women, all their clothes come off.
5443980	5445900	I don't really know why that's happened.
5445980	5447100	Sickos on the PC.
5447100	5447740	I know.
5447740	5448860	It's so weird.
5448860	5454380	Also have a torture chamber with slave maidens, but Hey, I've got the PC sicko story to top
5454380	5456380	all of this coming up, but hold on.
5456380	5456860	All right.
5456860	5458540	I think I need to get Skyrim now.
5458540	5463420	And then, uh, last but not least La Milana and Leisure Suit Larry are some of the titles
5463420	5469020	that are included on the next, um, steam green light, including, and this is pretty cool.
5469020	5475820	They've got, um, let's see here, DLC quest, which honestly wasn't a very long game, but
5476140	5484620	cool, uh, eat or masters of the broken world, Mac, um, the age of decadence, Yun pick and
5484620	5489580	war for the overworld are some of the other titles that are going to be coming out.
5489580	5492220	Um, let's see here.
5493100	5500380	And, uh, a con a con Nero demon hunters, which I think, isn't that that, um, yeah, I want
5500380	5505020	to see, isn't that the, uh, that new game that they're working on, uh, was it America
5505020	5505820	McGee or something?
5506380	5509980	I think that's that American McGee game, if I want to remember correctly.
5509980	5515420	And then also a grow Brodo modeling app, which is actually, um, software.
5515420	5521660	And then the articity draft game design tool is another non gaming thing that got green
5521660	5521900	lit.
5522620	5527820	So, um, just so you know, La Milana, that was a game that, you know, uh, dark Tetsuya
5527820	5529900	used to write about a lot on orange launch radio.com.
5529900	5531180	He was very excited about it.
5531180	5534780	I actually went to dark Tetsuya and I said, could I get a quote, sir, about how you feel
5534780	5536780	about La Milana getting the project green light?
5536780	5537740	And this is what he had to say.
5542940	5547340	That was an actual Kermit flail, by the way, that was an actual real deal Kermit flail.
5547340	5552460	Just, you know, uh, I don't know if anybody was Kermit flailing over this more like the
5552460	5557580	fuck, but, um, people are modding Alan wake on the PC.
5557580	5559660	Of course that's, that's what people do to PC games.
5559660	5560700	They mod them.
5560700	5566300	Um, but what, I guess apparently it wasn't supposed to be moddable.
5566300	5569500	It was supposed to have permissions, licenses, whatever that ain't going to hackers going
5569500	5571020	to hack hackers going to hack.
5571020	5572300	And you got to love this.
5572300	5576860	They, they did all 2.9 gigs, unraveled it, put it back together.
5576860	5579900	And what was the community tool that they put out?
5579900	5583020	What did they put out in response to you'll never hack Alan wake.
5583660	5590380	Somebody put a hello Kitty flashlight into Alan wake where the little flashlight will
5590620	5592700	always be the little hello Kitty image.
5592700	5595580	When it shines on the wall, you see, you can see the little bullet.
5595580	5599180	Let me see if in the video, you get a little, a better shot to see it.
5599180	5600060	You can kind of see it there.
5600060	5602220	See hello, Kitty flashlight.
5602780	5603420	That's awesome.
5603420	5605740	Cause that's what my Alan wake needs.
5605740	5606860	And I can kill the bad guys.
5606860	5610860	Little shadows with hello, Kitty killing with cuteness.
5611580	5612140	I can't.
5613340	5616860	Well, this, I don't even know what the hell to say about this.
5616860	5619820	Uh, this community could have used a little bit of a cuteness.
5619820	5621340	Cause this was just stupid.
5621340	5623740	In fact, this is one of the stupidest things I've ever seen in gaming.
5623740	5628140	Like ever, uh, dark, dark, dark, dark Sakura.
5628140	5629580	Did you see this?
5630220	5630780	Fuckery.
5631580	5637260	This is the pre-order bonus for the European Australian island.
5637260	5639180	Riptide zombie bait edition.
5639180	5639500	What?
5639500	5640540	It's a collector's edition.
5640540	5640860	No, whatever.
5640860	5642300	Not pre-order bonus, whatever.
5642300	5643820	Severed limbs for everybody.
5643820	5644860	Collector's edition.
5644860	5650060	It is a severed torso of an apparently British female.
5650060	5654860	And I'm only guessing that because she's got the little union Jack bra thing going
5654860	5660780	for her, but she is all bloodified, decapitated, armless and limbless.
5661340	5662300	It is gross.
5662860	5664540	Who would want this in their house?
5665260	5671820	And especially kind of fucking tacky to announce this type of thing.
5671820	5676300	The day that Joe Biden is sitting down with a video game industry to talk about, you
5676300	5680380	know, what is there a correlation between that, blah, blah, blah.
5680380	5685500	Now, before y'all correct me, I am aware it was the Europe and Australian pre-order
5685500	5686140	bonus.
5686140	5690700	So they were the ones to announce it, not the U S arm of the company.
5691740	5696380	However, somebody finally figured, you know, maybe this is kind of tacky.
5696380	5698780	Maybe we don't really need this.
5698780	5701740	Maybe, maybe this is just in bad taste.
5702860	5706940	And so they came out and said, we sincerely regret this choice and we're committed to
5706940	5709260	making sure this will never happen again.
5709260	5713180	Although does that what happens to the people that already pre-ordered it?
5713180	5713820	Does this mean?
5713820	5715740	I don't know if they even say it won't happen again.
5715740	5717740	They didn't say we're going to pull this.
5717740	5718860	We're not going to sell this.
5718860	5720060	They don't mention that at all.
5720060	5722220	They're just saying we won't do this again.
5724380	5725740	Nothing to stop us from doing that.
5726540	5728860	Nothing said that they're going to stop doing it now.
5728860	5731180	They just said, oh, well, we're not going to do it again.
5732380	5736540	Alan alchemy in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says it's super sexed up and gross.
5736540	5738380	It's for neckbeards to fat too.
5738380	5739740	See, that's the sick thing.
5739740	5745980	Like this is sick already, but then you have to realize because it is an inanimate object,
5745980	5747820	somebody will stick their dick in it.
5747820	5753180	And that makes it like 10 times, like a million times worse as if this could even get worse.
5753180	5755820	You realize somebody's going to put their dick in it.
5755820	5758380	And it's just like, this is, this is too much.
5758380	5759820	That was a joke already made that.
5759820	5761340	Yeah, just saying.
5764940	5766060	Oh, but it doesn't end there.
5768380	5772380	A new game was made this week by the encyclopedia dramatica forums.
5772380	5773020	One of their members.
5773020	5773740	Oh, go figure.
5775580	5777980	Called bullet to the head of the NRA.
5777980	5782060	Yes, that is the name of the game bullet to the head of the NRA.
5782060	5784060	It is a first person shooter.
5784060	5789500	If you want to call it that, that lets you, you just shoot NRA boss, Wayne LaPierre.
5791660	5799500	The intent of this game was to do nothing, but to just piss people off and imagine encyclopedia
5799500	5804220	dramatica releasing something that would just piss people off, quote, share this everywhere,
5804220	5807500	especially gun nut and anti-game websites.
5807500	5811740	Also see if you can't send it to the NRA somehow, like through the feedback on their website
5811740	5812540	or something.
5812540	5814700	This is from forum user gizmo.
5814700	5819980	Oh, 1942, who also is developing a game based on the Sandy Hook shooting.
5820780	5826380	You will actually get to go to the Connecticut school and shoot kids because there's always
5826380	5828540	going to be that guy on the internet.
5830540	5834540	Dark Sakura, you look like you're about to just like, you're doing people, you're doing
5834540	5835900	the SMH thing over there.
5835900	5837740	Like SMH.
5837740	5838780	Shaking my head.
5838780	5839180	Oh.
5839180	5840460	Or SMGDH.
5840460	5841500	Shaking my goddamn head.
5841500	5843020	I just don't get people.
5843020	5844140	I really don't though.
5844140	5844620	It's fine.
5844620	5845980	Well, here we are talking about it.
5845980	5847900	So maybe the troll one, I don't know.
5847900	5848620	Yeah, fuck them.
5848620	5849740	It's an attention grab.
5849740	5850380	Nothing more.
5850940	5854460	But you know, you know, somebody's going to get this and be all, you know, his attention
5854460	5856220	is going to grab Fox news.
5856220	5856700	Yeah.
5856700	5863020	But I like to file this, this stuff under the, uh, the banner of no incur now.
5863020	5863900	No one important.
5864460	5870780	Now somebody did point out this came out one day after the NRA had put out their own gun
5870780	5875180	game, NRA practice range, which is available on the iOS.
5875180	5877340	It is rated for ages four and up.
5878620	5879820	Of course, that's all target.
5879820	5881900	It's target practice, target practice.
5881900	5882460	So it's okay.
5883180	5884220	Here's a question, right?
5884220	5887260	I know this is rapid fire news and I'm not going very rapidly, but you know, there's
5887260	5888460	a lot to say about this stuff.
5888460	5890460	Would you let a four year old play point blank?
5890460	5897100	Um, it's a gun game, but it's, it's carnival guns.
5897100	5902860	It's, it's not, this is though, where my stance is with this is that if I were a parent,
5902860	5906300	I wouldn't let a child watch TV until they were older than five.
5907660	5908300	Good luck with that.
5910300	5911580	That's what, that was our plan.
5911580	5912300	That didn't happen.
5912300	5916220	I know plenty of parents who have been very successful with it just because, and I come
5916220	5921420	from that just because I've seen the difference of behavior with Becky's son when he's
5921420	5926300	allowed to play games and watch TV versus when he's limited access to playing games
5926300	5927180	and watching TV.
5927180	5931500	He's a lot happier of a kid when he gets to go outside and play more often.
5932060	5938380	So, um, I don't think I would allow, if I were a parent, I wouldn't allow TV or video
5938380	5942780	games until they were old enough to actually have more of a comprehension factor attached
5942780	5943100	to it.
5943740	5944380	That's just me.
5945260	5947100	You know, and I certainly wouldn't let it be a babysitter.
5948940	5951340	Let's move on to some more rapid fire news, dark soccer.
5952140	5956780	Um, well, you know how people were a little excited about Epic Mickey too?
5956780	5961580	Well, they were only a little excited because they only sold 270,000 copies in North America,
5961580	5966060	which is about, oh, a million less than, uh, the first one did.
5966620	5966860	Yeah.
5966860	5968780	The first one sold 1.3 million.
5968780	5969100	Yeah.
5969100	5969900	Not even close.
5970460	5970860	Sorry.
5971420	5973420	And the creator thinks they're going to do more.
5973500	5975740	So, uh, that'd be great when Disney shuts them down.
5976780	5984540	Um, now there's also, um, six weeks of free, um, PS mobile games.
5984540	5987020	It's going to be starting with Samurai Beatdown.
5987580	5994220	Um, you can get that on the PlayStation store and it's either for Vita or PlayStation certified
5994220	5995100	mobile devices.
5996220	6001180	And it's only going to be available in Japan, US, UK, Canada, France, Italy, Germany, Spain,
6001180	6002300	and Australia.
6002300	6004140	So if you live in Zimbabwe, you're fucked.
6006140	6012140	And then for fans of Shin Megami Tensei, um, Devil Summoner Soul Hackers is going to be
6012140	6013820	out in the US in April.
6013820	6019820	It's been set to release on 16th of April and, uh, nothing about our, uh, friends in
6019820	6023660	the UK if they're going to see anything, but, uh, who knows?
6024620	6031820	It's also, um, a, uh, 3DS remake of the one that came out in the Sega Saturn in 1997.
6032780	6033020	Done.
6035180	6035500	All right.
6035500	6038940	How about we go to the frugal question of the week?
6038940	6039820	How about we?
6039820	6040460	How about it?
6040460	6041180	How about it, huh?
6049500	6054140	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, Google Plus at Orange Lounge Radio.
6054140	6054700	Put them together.
6054700	6055980	You get frugal.
6056860	6058140	Here's our frugal question of the week.
6058940	6061340	We didn't talk about this story tonight, but I guess we will now.
6061340	6065740	A settlement was reached this week between the actor that portrayed Kevin Butler and
6065740	6066460	Sony.
6066460	6070860	You may recall that the actor was spotted in a commercial for a tire store playing a
6070860	6072140	Nintendo Wii.
6072140	6074220	This got us thinking about commercials and marketing.
6074220	6076300	That's really all there is to say on that story.
6076300	6077900	Legal issues settled out of court.
6077900	6078620	What else is new?
6080860	6085100	But since it got us thinking about commercials and marketing and like how, how, how big of
6085100	6087580	an impact does somebody like Kevin Butler really have?
6087580	6093020	So we went to frugal and we asked the listeners, has a gaming system or game commercial or
6093020	6096460	advertising campaign ever worked on you?
6096460	6099900	Were it swayed you to make the decision to buy a game new?
6099900	6104220	Was it something you experienced more in your youth or something you still find might tilt
6104220	6105180	your opinion today?
6105180	6109500	Like I know a lot of us like we remember like Genesis does what Nintendo and some of those
6109500	6113420	I'm just saying when PlayStation 4 comes out, they better bring him fucking back because
6113420	6115900	that that that's how you sell that shit.
6116140	6119740	Not creepy babies, but fucking Kevin Butler is saying, I'm back, bitches.
6119740	6120860	Buy this shit.
6120860	6121260	Boom!
6121260	6122940	I don't think that can happen now.
6122940	6123660	Why?
6123660	6125980	Because the whole legal stuff and all that.
6125980	6127900	So throw enough money at him.
6127900	6129820	I'm sure he'll be like, oh, legal smeagle, whatever.
6130940	6131980	I'll put this in my pocket.
6131980	6132780	That's true.
6132780	6133340	Money talks.
6133340	6133580	All right.
6134140	6138780	Let's go to the folks on Facebook and Google and see if advertising campaigns ever actually
6138780	6139500	worked on them.
6139500	6140940	We'll start with Tiger Claw on Facebook.
6141740	6145660	I've seen many commercials for the latest gaming consoles and neither one has swayed
6145660	6146460	me into buying one.
6146460	6151100	I always believe the only way to make a decision whether to buy the console or not is to actually
6151100	6151900	try it.
6151900	6153340	Like the kiosks at the stores.
6154060	6158380	Rageinator says as a kid in the early 80s before I became as jaded as I am today.
6158380	6158780	Yeah.
6158780	6163420	But then again, commercials that were our marketing towards young kids typically work.
6164700	6168860	Llama Juice says, look at it for the point of view as someone who isn't educated on video
6168860	6169980	games consoles.
6169980	6172860	The average mom out there buying a game system for their kid.
6172860	6173980	They don't know the difference.
6173980	6177900	If they see more commercials for console A instead of console B, then they'll assume
6177900	6180060	console A is better on the flip side.
6180060	6181820	Think about the commercials for the Ouya.
6181820	6183980	It's something that everyone was uneducated about.
6183980	6186700	And then the ads for it got a mountain of people excited.
6186700	6190460	That being said, as a kid, the commercials for the engage always got me.
6190460	6192700	I wanted one of those things so badly as a kid.
6194140	6195980	You were a kid when the engage came out.
6195980	6198060	I was in my 20s commercials for the Ouya.
6198780	6201020	Yeah, I didn't know there were commercials for the Ouya.
6201020	6202220	Is that maybe online?
6202220	6205340	I don't think there's commercials for the Ouya at all.
6205340	6206940	I mean, there's the video.
6206940	6211260	Probably because people were uneducated about it.
6211260	6213420	And then the ads for it got a mountain of people excited.
6213420	6213820	I don't know.
6216860	6221020	Dark Tetsuya said, I did go to see the wizard when I heard Super Mario Brothers 3 was going
6221020	6221740	to debut in it.
6221740	6222940	Does that count?
6222940	6227020	That was like the best product placement ever done in the history of ever.
6227020	6227260	Yeah.
6227260	6230860	I have to admit that I was interested.
6230860	6235100	Who didn't get a gigantic nerd boner when they went and saw the wizard and saw Super
6235100	6237500	Mario 3 like the first footage?
6237500	6240060	There has never been a better promotion ever.
6240060	6241660	I firmly believe that.
6241660	6246460	And the Power Glove, which by the way, I'm sorry, the Power Glove was a piece of shit.
6246460	6247180	It really was.
6247180	6249020	It was so shitty.
6249020	6251980	That and the U Force were both shitacular shit devices.
6251980	6253820	I already had a Power Glove when I saw that movie.
6253820	6254780	And wasn't it shit?
6254780	6255580	Yes, it was.
6255580	6257420	It was absolute fucking shit.
6257420	6259660	But it's so bad.
6260460	6263820	It was like, this is cool, except wait, I can't do shit with this.
6263820	6268540	You see the U Force in the little print ad, like playing punch out, and you think, oh
6268540	6269260	my God.
6270060	6271580	Nintendo, bring back the Power Glove.
6271580	6275740	I mean, seriously, that would be fucking awesome if it worked right.
6277260	6280060	When they have haptic gloves, they need to have the Power Glove come back.
6280860	6284300	Oh, the listeners are going to hate me for this, but you know how we always say time
6284300	6284940	to penis.
6284940	6287420	My concern with the Power Glove is time to fist.
6289660	6290060	We know.
6293100	6294140	It's so bad.
6294140	6295500	It's ripped for her pleasure.
6297900	6301900	Moving on to a comment from Burr brought these brain bleach.
6301900	6304220	Now make it stop.
6304220	6306220	Burr says it was the you know what?
6306220	6310460	It was the Kevin Butler ads along with the price cut that came with the release of the
6310460	6314860	slim that actually did help sway my opinion on the PlayStation 3 and finally got me to
6314860	6315500	pick one up.
6316220	6321180	To me, it was the moment that Sony finally meant business and let the games do the talking.
6321180	6326140	The original PlayStation 3 ads were way too obscure and stupid by contrast.
6326940	6329020	It was like when you let hipsters do commercials.
6330540	6335100	Veronica S. replied and said the very first Pokemon commercial that aired on TV caused
6335100	6336940	me to buy Pokemon Blue version.
6336940	6338140	I was 11 years old.
6338780	6343340	You know, the Pokemon cartoon was a pretty great tie in and the Pokemon movie.
6343980	6344620	Good times.
6346060	6346460	Let's see.
6346460	6350540	Acidic Vampire says, have you seen the Wii U launch commercial?
6350540	6351100	Hell no.
6353660	6354460	He gives a big thumbs.
6354460	6359020	I actually I only saw it in a movie theater once, but I don't I like I'm becoming dark
6359020	6363660	soccer over here, but I don't watch TV like I really don't like very, very rarely, very
6363660	6363900	rarely.
6363900	6367500	The only thing I've seen so far and it's because we're watching, I think, Law and Order SV
6367500	6370220	is there's a commercial over and over for like suicide.
6372140	6372700	Suicide.
6372700	6374220	Have you has it occurred to you?
6374380	6378700	It's like, I don't really know what it's for other than, hey, you know, I got to buy me
6378700	6379820	some of that suicide.
6380700	6381100	T.J.
6381100	6386780	Janai says kiosks and store demos are the most helpful for my buying decisions.
6387660	6392220	Steven M. replied and said the early Xbox promos for Kinect really got me excited to
6392220	6392700	buy one.
6393340	6397660	Dart Charger said in my youth, I was probably swayed by many video game commercials.
6397660	6402780	I mean, who could forget the commercial like Journey for the Atari 2600?
6402860	6405660	And he actually embedded the commercial here for us to.
6409820	6413900	They presents the world's first rock video game Journey Escape.
6413900	6414940	The concert's over.
6414940	6419980	Now you must help each member of Journey Escape to mobs of love-crazed groupies, shifty-eyed
6419980	6420460	promoters.
6423900	6429340	Find your roadies and manager and run into the escape vehicle and live to rock another
6429340	6429580	day.
6429580	6435180	Journey Escape for the Atari 2600 from Data Age.
6435980	6436540	You know what?
6437500	6439180	Fuck Journey from last year.
6440380	6441740	This is the true journey.
6443340	6446220	I regret printing Journey on my games of the year list.
6446220	6450220	This just reminded me that that there will only be one video game named Journey.
6451100	6453340	I'm teasing mostly.
6453340	6453580	All right.
6454300	6459340	Anyhow, Dart Charger went on and said today's marketing has matured with the modern gamer
6459340	6460060	as well.
6460060	6464860	These promotions aren't limited to simply TV commercials or magazine advertisements anymore.
6464860	6468780	Companies recognize the various ways they can influence gamers simply through exposure
6468780	6472780	across all mediums like game trailers, demos, and previews on gaming sites and magazines.
6472780	6475020	You left out viral marketing.
6475020	6480700	Every boardroom, you know, mid-management favorite thing to not understand.
6480700	6481580	Viral marketing.
6483340	6485180	We need you guys to create a viral video.
6485820	6486540	That's not how it works.
6486540	6487820	It has to multiply.
6487900	6488460	Multiply.
6488460	6489260	Spread.
6489260	6490220	Share it like a disease.
6490220	6491500	It must feature cats.
6491500	6493900	Andy R. replied and said, not usually.
6493900	6498860	I typically build up hype for the games I want on my own through reading articles and
6498860	6499420	such.
6499420	6502860	If anything, big expensive ad campaigns turn me off to a game.
6502860	6506860	When every single gaming site was running ads for Mass Effect 3, I got sick of seeing
6506860	6507340	it.
6507340	6509500	Probably part of the reason I still don't like the game.
6510460	6513980	And I was interested in buying Dishonored, but after seeing the trailer a million times
6513980	6518700	before the game launched, thanks to The Escapist and PA TV, I decided to pass on the game.
6519340	6520060	Just do what I do.
6520060	6520860	Stop watching TV.
6521500	6523100	Well, these are web shows, though.
6523100	6524860	Stop watching TV web shows.
6524860	6525660	Use Adblock.
6527420	6532300	I will admit, though, a lot of online sites can only seem to ever find one sponsor.
6532300	6535500	Dan and I always pick the commercials for Hulu that talk about, like, food.
6537580	6540620	I like this approach that I hope I pronounce this correctly.
6540780	6544700	Shaya C said, define advertising.
6544700	6548540	Were things like the Super Mario Brothers Super Show or the Sonic cartoon ads for a
6548540	6549580	specific game?
6549580	6550300	Not really.
6550300	6554380	Were they media which kept the franchise visible, popular, and made us kids excited for the
6554380	6555420	next game installment?
6555420	6556380	You bet.
6556380	6560940	Before the internet, gasp, TV ads, friends, and kiosks were the only way you'd actually
6560940	6563100	see gameplay before getting it yourself.
6563100	6565580	Magazines had reviews, but you'd only get stills.
6565580	6567900	Now we've got trailers on demand and tons of review sites.
6567900	6571900	I feel like consumers are pulling information more than is being pushed to them.
6571900	6576140	The only thing they really need to nail with traditional advertising these days is making
6576140	6577740	sure people know the title.
6577740	6578620	Interesting perspective.
6578620	6581180	We were going down that line a little bit and talking about the wizard and stuff.
6581980	6587340	Degenerate Johnny said, the only time I actually bought a console based on its advertisement
6587340	6589260	alone was Tiger's Gamecom.
6589260	6591980	The commercial made the mobile gaming device as the shit.
6592700	6597100	Yes, the little person's insulting remarks came off as insulting to the gaming community,
6597100	6599020	but I recognized its satire.
6599020	6601980	Not to mention it was pretty funny seeing the little guy get tossed around at the end
6601980	6602700	of the ad.
6602700	6604860	And so I'm fortunate to see that the device failed.
6604860	6606140	Oh yeah, that thing failed.
6606140	6609580	Since it had many features that were quite innovative for the late 90s, such as touchscreen
6609580	6614140	controls and internet access, it goes to show that one must be mindful of its market if
6614140	6615820	it hopes to make the product a success.
6616460	6621660	And lastly, SHA100Matt says, back when I subscribed to Nintendo Power as a kid, I was sent, like
6621660	6625820	many other subscribers, a VHS tape of the Nintendo 64.
6625820	6629980	Since there were no gaming blogs and gaming sites I was able to access back then, all
6629980	6634220	I had to go on was brief articles on Nintendo Power and other gaming magazines.
6634220	6639180	But when I got the Nintendo 64 Power Preview video from Nintendo Power, I was sold on the
6639180	6640620	Nintendo 64.
6640620	6644140	It was the first time I ever got a real look at the graphics and games in action, so I
6644140	6645900	was immediately blown away.
6645900	6648540	After that point, I saved up my money and got the system at launch.
6648540	6653260	I never realized that they'd sent out videos like that.
6653260	6653980	That's kind of neat.
6653980	6659020	I wonder if they were those really cheap, like, cardboard tape things that could really
6659020	6660780	fuck up your VCR if you used it wrong.
6661420	6662300	I don't know.
6662300	6666220	All right, anyhow, we have not yet gone to Google Plus, so let me quickly get through
6666220	6667260	Google Plus's answers.
6667820	6671100	ActDef said, I would say that back in the 80s and 90s it worked.
6671100	6675260	We got smothered with over-the-top, in-your-face advertisement back then, and it probably
6675260	6678380	got us to buy or ask our parents to get us a video games.
6678380	6682460	But now, a lot of commercials for games are really bland and don't capture your attention
6682460	6682860	that much.
6684300	6688460	CriticalMyth said, I can't say there was a commercial that did that for me, but print
6688460	6690860	ads have convinced me more than a couple times.
6690860	6693660	One I remember well was Xenosaga 2.
6693660	6695340	Cosmos had me at, hello.
6697740	6701740	Myko says, as much as I want to say no, it's the quality of the games that does it for
6701740	6706140	me, like it did for the Dreamcast, I have to say yes if the OUYA counts because I'm
6706140	6706780	an idiot.
6706780	6708620	Okay, so I guess there are OUYA commercials.
6708620	6709820	What am I missing?
6709820	6710220	Are there?
6710220	6712540	Because that's the second person to say there are OUYA commercials.
6713100	6714220	And I have just not seen one.
6714780	6716540	All right, let's take a look here.
6716540	6717820	Rob's on the hunt.
6717820	6722700	Shane is adding that those videos were real VHS tapes and they were fantastic.
6726860	6729900	I'll be damned, there is an, oh no, that says fan-made.
6731100	6735420	But there is this seven, I wonder if it's the Kickstarter ad these guys are referring
6735420	6735420	
6735420	6736380	It's probably the Kickstarter video that they had.
6736380	6737340	I bet that's what it is.
6737340	6739580	It's like the modern type of ad.
6739580	6740080	Interesting.
6743100	6749500	Let's see, E3VL says, advertising campaigns worked on me and my youth due to the limited
6749500	6752220	social media exposure, magazines, TV, and radio.
6752220	6756140	Now with the internet involved, ads are everywhere and it's second nature to ignore them or it
6756140	6759900	becomes background noise with the instant impulse, hit the X or skip button when it's
6759900	6760700	available.
6760700	6763820	Also, now that I purchase things with my own money instead of my parents, I tend to do
6763820	6767820	research before purchasing and ads are just a way to get me curious about coming trends
6767820	6772860	instead of impulse buys or begging for the blast processing for Christmas slash birthday.
6773500	6779500	And lastly, Techie Q says, no, today's ads campaigns to sway me has less effect on me
6779500	6783660	now thanks to internet, but it did sway me more during the Super Nintendo era of gaming.
6783660	6788140	Those early Super Mario World and Legend of Zelda, a link to the past commercials swayed
6788140	6790620	me hard to get a Super Nintendo.
6790620	6792460	Good answers tonight and good reminiscing.
6792460	6799100	All I know is the commercials for Grand Theft Auto San Andreas just pissed me off because
6799100	6802220	I wanted to play Grand Theft Auto San Andreas more.
6802220	6806220	You know, it was like before it came out, I'm like, what now?
6806220	6809260	Oh, you know, that kind of stuff.
6809260	6812060	Or Grand Theft Auto 4, both of those.
6812060	6816060	All right, let's move on with some more gaming news for the week.
6816060	6818540	Thank you to everybody on Facebook and Google for answering the question.
6818540	6819540	Loki.
6819540	6823780	All right, so we've been talking about it, and I'm sure you guys have no idea what Disney
6823780	6828420	Infinity is, even though we've been talking about it for months now, probably months longer
6828420	6834900	than everybody else, but Disney Infinity finally got announced this week, and basically it's
6834900	6842740	this cool combination of like toys and a little base that you put them on and games, and then
6842740	6844340	they have this toy box mode.
6844340	6850420	So basically, what kind of makes it different than Skylanders is it's not just one single,
6850420	6854100	I mean, it is, they have the toy box mode where you can kind of take all these toys
6854100	6859300	and build your own world out of it, which is kind of cool, but it's not some single
6859300	6864100	game that you have to buy characters for to unlock all the parts of the game.
6864100	6865620	That's really the main thing.
6865620	6871580	Bobby was being funny on Twitter and saying, so is this something that I can like now?
6871620	6874940	You know, are you giving me permission to like this because you gave everybody crap
6874940	6876500	about Skylanders?
6876500	6880420	And yeah, I say it's a little bit different because each individual character and playset
6880420	6882380	or whatever is its own thing.
6882380	6888980	It's not necessarily like, oh, I have to buy Captain Jack Sparrow to get to this one part
6888980	6891740	of the Monsters Inc. world or something like that.
6891740	6892740	It's not like that at all.
6892740	6896860	Each thing is its own game, and then what kind of ties them all together is the toy
6896860	6902020	box mode where you can build wherever the fuck you want, and they've got racing stuff
6902020	6903020	in there.
6903020	6905460	It sounds like they're kind of combining a little bit of the Little Big Planet stuff.
6905460	6909780	You can set your camera at certain spots, so you can do like a 2D platformer, or you
6909780	6914740	can make a racing game, or you could just do whatever, and you could share these all
6914740	6918740	around the world, and it sounds like that they're going to have, I think DLC you could
6918740	6919740	buy for it.
6919740	6920740	They're going to have actual toys.
6920740	6923740	The toys are like 12 bucks each for each individual character.
6924180	6925180	You can get playsets.
6925180	6929780	They're like 35 bucks, which are going to include a few characters and like a world
6929780	6935420	as well as some different power-ups and stuff, and talk about total fan service on a lot
6935420	6936420	of stuff.
6936420	6938180	The game itself actually comes with three worlds.
6938180	6942700	It's Monsters University, The Incredibles, and Pirates of the Caribbean, and they've
6942700	6949420	got Captain Jack Sparrow, Mr. Incredible, and Sully from Monsters U and Monsters Inc.
6949420	6954060	in that first playset, or the first thing they're packing in there for 75 bucks.
6954060	6955060	What a surprise.
6955060	6956060	I had no idea.
6956060	6963540	Yes, and then let's see what else, but yeah, they've got Tron, at least some hints of Tron
6963540	6966580	in there, and they've got other characters.
6966580	6972100	I think I posted a few things on there, like different screen grabs and stuff, and they've
6972100	6975260	got like Phineas and Ferb is going to be something else that they have on there.
6975260	6976620	Love Phineas and Ferb.
6976620	6978660	And they've got, of course, the rest of them.
6978900	6979900	Jack Skellington.
6979900	6980900	Yeah, Jack Skellington was in there.
6980900	6981900	Sign me up for that.
6981900	6985740	Toy Story, obviously, because that was kind of the Toy Box moment, Toy Story 3 is what
6985740	6988340	kind of inspired them to do all this stuff.
6988340	6993200	And Cars is going to be something else, and Wreck-It Ralph is in there, and they even
6993200	6999580	have some hints of like Sugar Rush, which should be pretty cool, and all this stuff
6999580	7000580	is supposed to be coming out.
7000580	7003980	Also, other things they didn't have, Frozen's going to have some characters with that when
7003980	7005820	that movie comes out this fall.
7005820	7007820	Here's a couple problems, though.
7007820	7013140	I mean, there's the Disney nerd in me wants to go all in on this shit, right?
7013140	7019100	I mean, you know, I collect the pins, which is an expensive hobby, you know, so why not
7019100	7020100	go to the figurines?
7020100	7021100	Right?
7021100	7022580	I mean, but here's my concern.
7022580	7025480	I'm really worried about the quality of the game.
7025480	7029620	And I'm going to be honest, whether this is a rational reason or not, I'm just being I'm
7029620	7030760	keeping it real.
7030760	7032760	I'm worried about who's developing it.
7032760	7035900	They don't have an established product under their belt.
7035900	7036900	Avalanche.
7036900	7041980	Like, a lot of the stuff they put out have been kiddie games.
7041980	7045060	Toy Story 3, obviously, was them, too.
7045060	7050160	And if you look at what they did before Disney picked them up, they did a lot of bad games,
7050160	7052060	like Sub-Zero Mythologies and all that.
7052060	7055980	Now, granted, we all make mistakes, and we should give them a chance that maybe this
7055980	7059140	is something that will break through, but I'm concerned.
7059140	7067100	And the gameplay footage didn't really make me go, uhh, you know?
7067100	7068100	I didn't lose my shit.
7068100	7070300	Well, did you watch any of the interview videos?
7070300	7072140	They actually had more in-depth play gameplay stuff.
7072140	7073140	To be fair, no.
7073140	7076060	I only watched the common trailer that was out there.
7076060	7077060	It looked OK.
7077060	7081580	I mean, it's not like, you know, none of this is really making me go, oh, I got it picked
7081580	7082580	up.
7082580	7086460	I mean, the Toy Box mode sounds really cool, but once again, I was kind of even thinking
7086460	7091940	about it, and I'm like, is this going to be really much different than Skylanders is
7091940	7096340	as far as, like, you're going to have to buy all this shit to, you know, what am I going
7096340	7097340	to have to buy?
7097340	7101380	Am I going to have to buy, like, this Disney landscape, you know, thing or something to
7101380	7103740	have, like, you know, the Epcot Center or whatever?
7103740	7104740	And they have that.
7104740	7107940	The Epcot Center, you can actually put it in your world and stuff.
7107940	7110540	It'd be like Warhammer Disney-K.
7110540	7111540	I mean, it's just so cool.
7111540	7116060	I'd have to see what stuff comes out and, you know, how it gets priced and, you know,
7116060	7117700	I think it's going to sell really well.
7117700	7121420	And the fact that they have this whole kind of synergy where you can build your own world
7121420	7122420	is kind of unique.
7122420	7123420	I don't know.
7123420	7126240	That's really going to set them apart from, like, Skylanders, because Skylanders is like,
7126240	7129220	you buy a bunch of characters, you play one game, you know, it's a dungeon crawler and
7129220	7130220	that's it.
7130220	7133140	Whereas this, they could have multiple game types.
7133140	7136580	They could have, you know, this is going to be a racing game, this is going to be an adventure
7136580	7137580	game.
7137580	7140980	Something to remember about those little RFIDs, too, is that they don't just, you know, they're
7140980	7142860	not just chips that transmit data.
7142860	7143860	They can save data.
7143860	7144860	Yes.
7144860	7145860	Just a limited amount, right?
7145860	7146860	Just a little bit.
7146860	7150100	But maybe enough so that, like, you could bring with you a level design.
7150100	7151100	Yes.
7151100	7152100	Maybe.
7152100	7155740	Or at least you can share those on the internet, apparently, like with other people and play
7155740	7157860	their creations or invite your friends over.
7157860	7164780	You can do four-player co-op over the internet.
7164780	7165780	I don't know.
7165780	7168240	I guess I'll wait till a little closer, look at some of the reviews.
7168240	7173160	You know, there's that part of me that's like, must have all figurines, must have them all.
7173160	7174860	But the figurines look cool.
7174860	7175980	I saw pictures of them.
7175980	7178860	I mean, they're well done.
7178860	7184220	And here's the thing, too, that I'm not too positive on, but it looks like they articulate.
7184220	7187580	It looks like the arms, at least they've got seams on the arms where it looks like they
7187580	7192820	could move, limited at least, but that's more than Skylanders can.
7192820	7194900	So you know, that'd be interesting.
7194900	7197260	Is that why they're going to be more expensive than the figure?
7197260	7198500	Is that just Disney tax?
7198500	7200140	They're not that much more expensive than Skylanders.
7200140	7201140	But they are more expensive.
7201140	7202140	Yes, they are more expensive.
7202140	7203140	Is that Disney tax?
7203140	7204140	Probably Disney tax.
7205140	7206140	Just curious.
7207140	7208140	All right.
7208140	7211140	Well, that is definitely the future of gaming, like it or not.
7211140	7212140	I don't know.
7212140	7219140	It concerns me, though, is that if we support Disney infinity, that like we're saying we
7219140	7220140	want more of this.
7220140	7224140	And I really worry about the barrage of knockoffs that this whole Skylander thing is going to
7224140	7225140	cause.
7225140	7226140	Pokemon.
7226140	7228140	Well, yeah, I was talking to Shane about that.
7228140	7232140	I was like, can you imagine if Nintendo just said we want to do Pokemon like this?
7232140	7234140	I would have them all my God.
7234140	7236140	But he brought up a good point with me.
7236140	7237140	Maybe I'll call in the show later.
7237140	7238140	Talk about it.
7238140	7241140	He said that the creator of Pokemon actually hates DLC.
7241140	7243140	So they may not be.
7243140	7247140	But he may hate DLC, but they're going to have DLC in the next Pokemon game.
7247140	7250140	He may hate it all he wants, but he's not calling a shot.
7250140	7252140	They used to do those Burger King toys back.
7252140	7255140	That's why I told him I said they used to have a little toy.
7255140	7260140	Can you imagine that they will literally have like Pokeballs that you put your fucking figurine
7260140	7262140	in that you put it out on?
7262140	7264140	It's like that was that was Burger King.
7264140	7265140	You know what?
7265140	7269140	Twelve years ago, I have to tell you, after they banned all those Pokeballs, we went to
7269140	7274140	a Burger King and went through the drive through 10 times to get more Pokeballs so that we
7274140	7276140	could hang them up on the tree yourself with them.
7276140	7278140	No, just so that we could have a pile of Pokeballs.
7278140	7282140	We we actually had a box full of Pokeballs and Pokemon toys because we wanted all of
7282140	7283140	them.
7283140	7286140	And then finally we're like, wait, this is stupid and gave them away.
7286140	7289140	I actually I went as Ash Ketchum one Halloween.
7289140	7292140	And thank you to Burger King for those Pokeballs because they were great for my costume.
7292140	7295140	And you know, and honestly, you know, maybe the other thing they got me psyched about,
7295140	7299140	you know, the whole Disney infinity thing is the fact that they had Nero's Me and You
7299140	7301140	in the trailer, which is pretty awesome.
7301140	7303140	Yes.
7303140	7304140	That's awesome.
7304140	7306140	That song is awesome.
7306140	7308140	So at least somebody has good taste in music over there.
7308140	7309140	I think they do.
7309140	7311140	And I really like Step Step.
7311140	7312140	All right.
7312140	7316140	Well, a little story that was circulating the game blogs this week was about pinballs
7316140	7317140	arcade.
7317140	7318140	That's with a Z.
7318140	7321140	It is a arcade located in Austin, Texas.
7321140	7323140	The cool place in Texas.
7323140	7326140	Pinball's arcade is kind of it's like a retro gaming place.
7326140	7332140	It's got arcade machines like Galaga, Street Fighter two, Jurassic Park, Lost World and
7332140	7336140	Darren's spawn, who is the owner of this with his wife, Mickey.
7336140	7339140	What they're trying to do with this, they want to recreate the experience of arcade
7339140	7343140	gaming, saying, quote, people have lost their that social experience.
7343140	7344140	They sit on couches with their Xbox.
7344140	7346140	They never talk to their kids.
7346140	7349140	You want to come to a place where you can play together with your kids, too, and find
7349140	7352140	something that the whole family enjoys.
7352140	7356140	Now, it should be noted, you know, this place has been around since November 2010.
7356140	7359140	It is just making the rounds on the game blog this week because of an article that
7359140	7363140	was discovered on statesman dot com, which I'm assuming is kind of like an Austin,
7363140	7366140	you know, so so people were able to find it on the Internet and kind of figure out
7366140	7367140	more about this place.
7367140	7373140	But yay to this guy trying to end his wife bringing back the retro arcade stuff.
7373140	7375140	I think that's great.
7375140	7379140	Even the article, the original article talks about some games like Missile Command,
7379140	7382140	they don't make much money, but he keeps them because they're classics.
7382140	7385140	And the other thing about the arcade, I was looking at the actual Web site.
7385140	7387140	Everything in that arcade is for sale.
7387140	7391140	So let's say you go in and you're playing Galaga and you're like, I want to buy this
7391140	7392140	machine. You can buy it.
7392140	7397140	So it's almost like a interactive show floor where you could buy the games.
7397140	7399140	It's kind of awesome.
7399140	7402140	Oh, no, I'll take all of them.
7402140	7406140	There did seem to be a healthy amount of ticket ticket spitting games to like more
7406140	7409140	like the hand-me-down kind of ticket spitting games, like things that were in
7409140	7410140	arcades a few years ago.
7410140	7412140	But, you know, we're on a skeeball.
7412140	7416140	Let's keep on keep on pressing the button to stop the light types of games.
7416140	7418140	You know, what was that?
7418140	7423140	They throw a birthday smoke and token and spider stomp.
7423140	7427140	Apparently, a second and third location elsewhere in Austin could be coming this
7427140	7431140	year. And, you know, remember, guys, he opened this place in November 2010.
7431140	7434140	I mean, the economy has been kind of in the shitter in the past couple of years,
7434140	7437140	yet this place didn't go out of business.
7437140	7438140	That's awesome.
7438140	7442140	And clearly it's because of the Star Trek backdrop he has there in the arcade.
7442140	7445140	That's what keeps that place awesome.
7445140	7447140	Anyhow, there's a no fear.
7447140	7449140	You know what? You know, who else has no fear?
7449140	7451140	Dan, right? Or had he had one?
7451140	7453140	Yeah, that was the last table we sold.
7453140	7456140	They need to have.
7456140	7460140	They need to have like a giant Picard picture on the wall with him, like saying,
7460140	7462140	make it so or something, somewhere in there.
7462140	7465140	I mean, that'd be pretty awesome.
7465140	7468140	All right, let's move on with more news.
7468140	7470140	Oh, yeah, it's my turn, isn't it?
7470140	7472140	Silly iPad.
7472140	7478140	Well, there is a game coming out by an indie studio called Stab Yourself.
7478140	7480140	That's the best name ever.
7480140	7482140	It's stabyourself.net.
7482140	7487140	They basically recreate 80s games and then apply modern physics to them.
7487140	7491140	They've done a game called Not Tetris, where basically it's like Game Boy Tetris,
7491140	7494140	except the bricks actually fall with the same momentum a brick really would.
7494140	7500140	Then there's Mario, which is M-A-R-I-0, where basically you go through the Mushroom Kingdom with a portal gun.
7500140	7503140	And now they have Not Pac-Man.
7503140	7512140	Not Pac-Man is, well, Pac-Man is on the screen, but instead of moving him around and the ghost moving around,
7513140	7518140	you actually tilt the screen, and you can use a keyboard, a mouse, a game pad, or a steering wheel.
7518140	7520140	Yes, you can use a steering wheel.
7520140	7523140	And the ghosts don't move by themselves either.
7523140	7525140	They might fall into you as you're turning.
7525140	7530140	So it applies a new aspect of physics to the game, and I need this in my life.
7530140	7533140	That is actually badass, I've got to say.
7533140	7535140	That is a really smart innovation.
7535140	7541140	Obviously, it's Stab Yourself with Love and Good Ideas is what they talk about in the name, right?
7541140	7542140	Stab Yourself with innovation.
7542140	7543140	Yes, exactly.
7543140	7545140	That's stabyourself.net.
7545140	7548140	Go get it. I want it. I'm gonna get it.
7548140	7550140	I love that you can control it with a steering wheel.
7550140	7554140	I totally do. Well, you know, we've got Dan's steering wheel rig.
7554140	7557140	We could totally do that. Oh, did, oh, no, no, no.
7557140	7560140	Okay, I have to add something. Rewind back into the gaming week.
7560140	7562140	Do you know what my husband is doing tonight?
7562140	7569140	He is building himself a three-monitor rig, just for playing Gran Turismo and OutRun.
7570140	7571140	My husband.
7571140	7573140	I didn't realize OutRun used three monitors.
7573140	7574140	Yeah.
7574140	7576140	Like the old OutRun or the new OutRun?
7576140	7577140	The newer ones.
7577140	7584140	He's basically building the rig so he can hook up his PC to do full three-screen gaming.
7584140	7589140	Now, if you're gonna do something like that with an Xbox or a PS3, you actually have to have other systems.
7589140	7591140	Like multiple systems to get him to run.
7591140	7593140	Yeah, I know Gran Turismo, you need like three systems, three monitors.
7593140	7598140	Yeah, but he's doing something so that he can play all of the PC-based games.
7598140	7599140	Cool.
7599140	7602140	With three monitors. My husband's a dork.
7602140	7604140	That's why you love him, though.
7604140	7607140	I guess. He better get me that BeatMania now.
7607140	7609140	More news.
7609140	7613140	All right, so, layoffs. More layoffs.
7613140	7620140	So, starting off, Gas Powered Games had some layoffs, and this is right after they just launched a Kickstarter for a game called Wildman.
7621140	7627140	Apparently, the whole thing was that Wildman's Kickstarter needed to actually...
7627140	7639140	It needs to earn that money because otherwise, they would have had to lay everyone off anyways without any of their paid time off and stuff cashed out and any of the benefits or severances and stuff.
7641140	7643140	And right now, I think...
7643140	7646140	I'm actually gonna check to see how their Kickstarter's doing.
7646140	7661140	Not looking good. They need to hit $1.1 million, and they're at $263,000, and they have 25 days to go. It's gonna be tough.
7661140	7670140	But basically, yeah. So, what he's saying is if they do hit their Kickstarter, they'll try to hire the people back that haven't found jobs yet and that kind of stuff.
7670140	7680140	Unfortunately, it's just bad timing, I guess. They just had to lay them off now so that they have money to actually do that.
7680140	7690140	They're still operating, but it's way slimmed down. In fact, pretty much everybody's gone except for the head of the studio and I think a couple people.
7690140	7693140	So, that's kinda gonna suck.
7694140	7701140	The other thing, too, is Codemasters has laid off 80 people as well, and they're restructuring.
7701140	7706140	Sorry, there's three companies tonight that are having major, major problems.
7706140	7717140	Yeah. Codemasters, really, they don't have... I mean, they have had some okay games come out, but a lot of their stuff recently hasn't done terribly well.
7717140	7728140	I'm trying to think. Dirt 3 was the last game I remember them having put out. I know they have Grid 2 coming, and also their Formula 1 title didn't do terribly well.
7728140	7734140	And I don't think their Formula 1 kart racing game did terribly well either. So, that kinda sucks.
7734140	7741140	Maybe they can make something other than racing games. I think they tried that and that wasn't terribly well either.
7741140	7745140	I was gonna say, but what's worked for them is that Dirt was one of their biggest games.
7745140	7756140	Grid looked pretty cool. Grid 2, so I'm looking forward to see what that looks like. I'd love to see a next-gen Dirt game on the new consoles when they come out. That'd be pretty awesome.
7756140	7763140	I'd also like to see a next-gen Ridge Racer that doesn't fucking suck, Namco. You have more time. Come on.
7763140	7773140	Not a fucking rehash of, what, fuck, 7 or 6? How many times? What game did they actually have new tracks in? Was that 4? 4 had new tracks in it?
7773140	7777140	I mean, seriously. New Ridge Racer would be awesome.
7777140	7784140	Alright, well, moving on to another story here. You know, where there is an internet, there will always be trolls.
7784140	7790140	And the folks at Blizzard, yes, Blizzard figured that out this week with Diablo 3 changes.
7790140	7800140	Jay Wilson, who was, I believe he was like the head designer on Diablo 3, he is stepping away to do other duties within Blizzard.
7800140	7807140	He's not leaving Blizzard, but he's worked on Diablo 3 for 7 years, and he will no longer be working on Diablo 3.
7807140	7814140	Well, instantly, in the departure thread, people were bashing Jay Wilson for the quality of Diablo 3.
7814140	7821140	You know, for many people, Diablo 3 has not lived up to expectations. The Always Online thing has rubbed people the wrong way.
7821140	7828140	The Real Money Auction House has rubbed some people the wrong way. PVP was promised, it still hasn't happened yet, although I guess dueling is coming in the next patch.
7828140	7833140	That's rubbed some people the wrong way. So, people have taken out their aggressions on this guy.
7833140	7842140	He announced his retirement on January 17th, and the thread has grown to over 170 pages.
7842140	7849140	Rob Pardo, the Chief Creative Officer at Blizzard, came into the thread saying, quote,
7849140	7861140	This thread saddens me greatly. I know that the Battle.net forums have earned a reputation for rough justice, but I do not believe justice is being served by how people are speaking about Jay's departure from Diablo 3.
7861140	7866140	If you still feel the need to dish out blame, then I would prefer you direct it at me.
7866140	7873140	I was the executive producer on the project, I hired Jay, and I gave him advice and direction through the development process.
7873140	7878140	I was ultimately responsible for the game we released and take full responsibility for the quality of the result.
7878140	7887140	Very interesting, kind of like, you know, protective parent kind of attitude going on there. That's Karen about your employees. That's interesting.
7887140	7889140	They could hire me now.
7890140	7895140	If you were the lead designer on Diablo 3, what would you do?
7895140	7897140	Garris.
7897140	7900140	Hey, I didn't say it. I didn't say it.
7900140	7904140	I would license out to Bioware to make a Mass Effect MMO.
7904140	7912140	Anyhow, now, he acknowledged also, this is what we're saying, the Diablo community deserves an even better game.
7912140	7919140	We have a talented team in place and have no intention of stopping work on Diablo 3 until it is the best game in the franchise.
7919140	7927140	So interesting, this game is coming up on, what, nine months out and they're still trying to get the game they really want.
7927140	7935140	This is a weird place we're at in the industry. I mean, it's not that Diablo 3 is, like, bad, but it was extremely disappointing. Extremely disappointing.
7935140	7938140	And Torchlight 2 is kind of better.
7939140	7944140	Anyhow, let's open up the mailbag. Let's see what the listeners have to say, shall we?
7946140	7949140	Mailbag orangelaunchrater.com is the place you can email us each week.
7949140	7955140	And usually Dark Soccer will dive into the email bag head first, but not tonight.
7955140	7961140	As you can tell by my sexy ass voice tonight, I really don't have much of a voice to do it.
7961140	7964140	Impersonating your mother earlier probably didn't help that.
7964140	7966140	No, it didn't. I'm suffering for that now.
7966140	7968140	You know what, you need more coffee.
7968140	7971140	You know what, that's a good idea and I know where you keep it, but I'm not doing it.
7971140	7976140	Alright, let's get to some emails tonight. I want to start with this email.
7976140	7981140	From Phlegus, emails us.
7981140	7987140	Hello Orangelaunch Radio crew, I'm going to keep this brief as I am most likely going to come off as extremely odd and potentially creepy.
7987140	7989140	But I assure you, I'm harmless.
7989140	7996140	I've been searching for an online radio show for a long while now and after haphazardly stumbling across this podcast the other day, I have to ask,
7996140	8002140	were you ever a Bimani-centric show who possibly covered 2DX8 style previews around late 2002?
8002140	8006140	If not, I apologize for the rather odd question and keep up the excellent work.
8006140	8008140	Love the show and it's wonderful cast.
8012140	8014140	You recognize that from the keyboard mania?
8014140	8016140	Yes, that would be us.
8016140	8018140	That is the show, absolutely.
8018140	8025140	You know, it's funny you should bring up 2DX8 style because you know what this email needs to just make it perfect.
8025140	8027140	I mean, I really appreciate the reminiscing.
8027140	8028140	More Haulik!
8028140	8030140	No, no, no, not more Haulik.
8030140	8031140	Dancer?
8031140	8033140	Yes, more Dancer.
8033140	8037140	This email definitely needs some more Dancer, so let's give him some Dancer.
8037140	8039140	God damn it, now I can't find Dancer.
8039140	8051140	You know, that was like one of the first Bimani game I actually bought brand new that wasn't a DDR.
8053140	8054140	You remember?
8055140	8059140	I remember how we would all sit around with like little figurines and stand behind people while they played that.
8059140	8061140	That was the best, that was absolutely the best.
8061140	8064140	And then try to Para Para with Last Message.
8064140	8066140	Here's the thing I want to know about this email.
8066140	8072140	So, I actually offline earlier in the week, I wrote back to Playgus, so I'm waiting to hear back.
8072140	8075140	And I was like, yeah, it's us, basically, long story short.
8075140	8080140	But my curiosity is, I've been searching for an online radio show for a long while now.
8080140	8087140	And after haphazardly stumbling across this podcast, so it's like, we was looking for the old show.
8087140	8089140	And found this mess instead.
8089140	8091140	We still have our Bimani love.
8092140	8093140	Of course we have our Bimani love.
8094140	8096140	Akira Yamaoka is still God.
8099140	8102140	Anyhow, let's move on with more emails.
8102140	8106140	Although, although, although I do have to say I have a special, special place in my heart for Desero.
8107140	8108140	Oh, why is that?
8108140	8111140	Fucking Desero. I love Cobalt.
8111140	8114140	Moving on to an email from Redertainment.
8114140	8120140	Hello Podcrafters, I've been following the recent discussion about video games needing to be connected to the internet.
8120140	8121140	So their users can play them.
8121140	8127140	This includes EA's recent SimCity announcement, always on DRM and other issues imposed by game companies.
8127140	8132140	In discussing this issue, some have brought up the prospect of the people playing the games not having access to the internet.
8132140	8135140	Either because they are poor or because they are in the military.
8135140	8139140	There is another aspect to the mandatory internet connection issue that's not being brought up.
8139140	8143140	What if the person playing the game can't connect to the publisher's servers.
8143140	8145140	Not because of any problem with the consumer or the publisher.
8145140	8149140	But because of an ISP's complete and utter fucking incompetence.
8149140	8156140	What if due to the ISP being run by morons who think of Foresight as something only the uncircumcised deal with.
8159140	8160140	That was good.
8160140	8167140	The consumer or the publisher cannot connect to one another because of a failure by one or more internet service providers.
8167140	8174140	This is just one of the reasons why I think of publishers mandating consumers to be connected to the internet as a bad idea.
8174140	8180140	Stay black. Retertainment. And yes, I did just come up with the Foresight line. Trainer.
8180140	8184140	Is that because you always say Garrus? He says trainer? I don't know. Anyway.
8184140	8189140	You notice I haven't said it once during the course of the show.
8189140	8193140	I've said it like three times now. Shitty internet service providers being a reason.
8193140	8197140	Well, I mean, you're preaching to the choir, Retertainment. This shit's a bad idea.
8197140	8201140	And you're just throwing another ingredient in the pot on why this is a bad idea.
8201140	8206140	I mean, we had in the past, this show would drop several times.
8206140	8209140	Now, maybe that wasn't the ISP's fault necessarily.
8209140	8214140	But, you know, if you have a bad router or something, you know, you're gonna pay for that with your game.
8214140	8216140	It's just ridiculous.
8218140	8221140	I agree with you, Retertainment. Yes. Yes, sir. Yes.
8224140	8226140	Another email here from AZHP.
8226140	8229140	Hey, OLR. This is a long one, by the way, but it's a good one.
8229140	8232140	AZHP here. Sorry in advance for the long email. You're forgiven.
8232140	8236140	But it's on two subjects that are really important to me, and I'm sure some of you as well.
8236140	8237140	So I hope you read it.
8237140	8244140	I remember you guys mentioning the awesome Games Done Quick charity marathon for the Prevent Cancer Foundation on the show last week.
8244140	8248140	And I wanted to give a little more background on it in case anyone was interested in the marathon or the cause.
8248140	8253140	Dozens of speedrunners from around the world, most of whom are record holders for various games,
8254140	8261140	paid their way to Washington, D.C. in order to speedrun games in order to raise money to support cancer research.
8261140	8271140	Their initial goal was $150,000, but due to the immense generosity of fellow gamers, they managed to raise over $420,000 over a seven-day marathon.
8271140	8278140	This means that the Prevent Cancer Foundation will be able to fund five two-year research grants for cancer research.
8278140	8279140	Well, job well done.
8279140	8284140	I had no idea that they had collected all these travelers from around the world.
8285140	8288140	I had no idea whatsoever that that was the case, so thank you for sharing.
8288140	8294140	I honestly thought it was like a group of like a college club or something that all was getting together to do it.
8294140	8296140	So I think that's really cool.
8297140	8298140	So props to you guys.
8299140	8304140	Like you guys said, with all the bad press games have gotten due to recent events,
8304140	8309140	it's really amazing that these people donated their vacation time and money to support this amazing cause.
8309140	8313140	Some of the more impressive runs were Final Fantasy IX done in nine hours,
8313140	8320140	Super Mario 64 all 120 stars done in under two hours by the world record holder Siglemic,
8320140	8326140	Zelda O'Green of Time done in 23 minutes using some game-breaking bugs, and more.
8326140	8332140	All the games were done in one sitting and it was amazing to watch all week, sometimes during work,
8332140	8336140	whoops, and see how amazingly good and consistent people were at these games.
8336140	8341140	I wasn't going to donate much originally, but after seeing how passionate these people were about the cause and the games,
8341140	8346140	I eventually donated $80 over the week, though some people donated hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
8346140	8352140	The runners read every donation comment that came through that week, but the one that touched me in a way I wouldn't have expected.
8352140	8355140	A donor during the O'Green of Time run said,
8355140	8360140	My grandmother's cat died of cancer. She used to watch me play O'Green of Time when I was a kid,
8360140	8364140	and I hope that she's watching you speedrun this game from kitty heaven right now.
8364140	8370140	I know it's silly, but I teared up a little bit. No, that's, that's, that's really adorable.
8370140	8372140	And it is sad.
8372140	8375140	Sorry for the long email, guys. You're forgiven. Good cause.
8375140	8383140	And in case anyone is interested in watching the marathon videos, you can find them in the features section of speeddemosarchive.com.
8383140	8388140	Yours truly AZHP. Well, I hope it's an even bigger success for them next year.
8388140	8392140	I didn't realize they were bringing all these people in. They could do an expo out of this shit. That's...
8392140	8394140	A speedrun expo would be pretty awesome.
8394140	8399140	Yeah, it would be, actually. So, you know, bigger and better next time.
8399140	8402140	That's great. Good job, guys.
8402140	8406140	If anybody from that effort is listening, a tip of the hat to you.
8406140	8412140	Lastly, but not leastly, gamergirl with an email.
8412140	8416140	Or as she signed it, GG. Good game, gamergirl.
8416140	8422140	Dear OLR, I first would like to say that if I make any mistakes, i.e. grammatical errors, I apologize.
8422140	8425140	You guys, as always, have an amazing show. Keep up the good work.
8425140	8430140	I never thought my life would change so drastically with everyone's help.
8430140	8433140	I got to thinking a lot about how everything good happened to me because of OLR,
8433140	8437140	and it never ceases to amaze me how you guys are always helping everyone.
8437140	8445140	As a matter of fact, as of January 19th, 2013, your very own Dark Tetsuya and gamergirl are officially engaged.
8445140	8448140	Wow. Congratulations.
8448140	8454140	Another OLR love story for the books, guys. Well done. As always, I enjoy the show.
8454140	8458140	Thanks again for introducing me to my best friend and soon to be life partner, gamergirl.
8458140	8460140	Wow.
8461140	8463140	I happened to see that on Facebook earlier.
8463140	8468140	Yeah, yeah. I had heard of this before the email came in, but still.
8468140	8477140	Just to kind of have it put in that perspective kind of way that they had met through OLR is really like, wow.
8477140	8481140	I've been blown away with some of the emails and comments we've been getting the past couple weeks.
8481140	8485140	2013 is the year you're trying to make me cry, y'all.
8485140	8490140	Well, good job. Does this mean we have to send over? I don't know where they're getting married or whatever,
8490140	8494140	if it's going to be here or because I think they have a distance right now between them.
8494140	8500140	But I wonder if we need to send along a tape message or something, or is that even appropriate? I don't know.
8500140	8505140	You know what? Get the speed run demo, guys, at your wedding reception. That's how you do it.
8505140	8507140	That'd be great.
8507140	8512140	Good job. A big congratulations and a perfect way to end the mailbag this week.
8512140	8516140	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. Wowzy, wowzy, wow.
8516140	8518140	Thanks for doing the mailbox for me.
8518140	8523140	You're welcome, but you're going to need to fend for yourself on this upcoming segment.
8523140	8527140	We're going to flip a 180, turn this car around and go from lovey-dovey stuff.
8527140	8529140	We're going to flip this bitch.
8529140	8532140	We're going to flip a bitch right now and get into the bitching.
8542140	8547140	This is punishment. This is fucked up.
8547140	8553140	My F.U. goes to the old woman who is driving in front of me on my way here.
8553140	8559140	You know how some people turn into the suicide lane, the turn lane in the middle?
8559140	8563140	Well, this woman doesn't even signal the moment this red truck starts pulling into it.
8563140	8566140	We're on the inside lane heading toward here.
8566140	8569140	She just swerves into the right lane, doesn't even look if there's somebody else there.
8569140	8572140	And I'm like, really, bitch? You thought that he was going to run into you?
8572140	8574140	Ugh, I was just so tired.
8574140	8579140	And so finally I ended up thinking, this woman is dangerous. I'm getting away from her.
8579140	8582140	And so I sped around her and got away from her.
8582140	8585140	And she was just moving back and forth in between lanes.
8585140	8589140	She's like, I'm going to use both lanes. Fuck. I'm safer in the middle.
8589140	8594140	So I was like, yeah. Another F.U. goes to me losing my voice.
8595140	8599140	I've been fighting off getting sick and I think I'm over it.
8599140	8603140	It's just left me with a really sore throat. So, yeah.
8606140	8608140	F.U. to my throat for hurting.
8608140	8614140	And F.U. for my brain being tired when I want to do something that involves a lot of thinking.
8614140	8618140	Especially in the form of actually working with some programs and stuff that I have on here.
8618140	8621140	Or learning to program, that would be fantastic.
8621140	8623140	But it seems like whenever I do that.
8623140	8628140	If somebody decides to watch Law and Order SVU, my brain is just like.
8628140	8630140	Like I just can't fucking concentrate.
8630140	8634140	Hey, Dark Tetsuya and Gamer Girl, guess what you have to look forward to?
8636140	8637140	Thank you.
8637140	8638140	Married life.
8638140	8640140	Thankfully we are almost done with Law and Order SVU.
8640140	8644140	We are in the 14th season. We are on the home stretch. It is almost over.
8644140	8647140	I just realized today, because we're sharing a Hulu account with some other people.
8647140	8651140	That American Idol just started. I'm like, when the fuck did that start?
8651140	8654140	I knew because my mom had to call me and tell me about how she.
8654140	8657140	Rab! American Idol is on and this girl is good.
8657140	8663140	No, no. She is over the Nicki Minaj Mariah thing. She is over that.
8663140	8665140	I didn't even see the picture.
8665140	8669140	I had no idea because I don't watch cable anymore or even basic TV anymore.
8669140	8674140	So, it's like I didn't even know. That's just crazy that I shouldn't.
8674140	8676140	I see the billboards.
8676140	8679140	Well, in San Francisco. There was a huge one going over the Bay Bridge.
8679140	8682140	Yeah, so, I mean, that's the crime.
8682140	8685140	All right, uh, let's see. My Fuse of the Week.
8685140	8688140	I've been getting like weird side pains again and that always freaks me out.
8688140	8691140	Because, you know, long time listeners of the show remember like five years ago,
8691140	8693140	I was in the hospital beating some of that stuff.
8693140	8695140	So, like every time I get side pains, I get like really freaked out.
8695140	8697140	Like, oh my God, I'm sick again.
8697140	8698140	And then it's gas.
8698140	8701140	Yeah, or like I'm just gaining weight or something.
8701140	8705140	So, here's to hoping it's fat if nothing else.
8705140	8707140	Hey, Rob. Avoid the Taco Bell.
8707140	8708140	What?
8709140	8711140	I didn't eat Jack in the Box.
8711140	8713140	Loki talked about it.
8713140	8715140	I wanted to eat Jack in the Box today.
8715140	8717140	I really wanted to go there and be late.
8717140	8721140	But I wanted, we went out for gay brunch as we usually do on Sundays.
8721140	8723140	And I call it gay brunch because we eat brunch with other gays.
8723140	8726140	And I wanted to eat healthy.
8726140	8730140	But I'm sorry, sir. We don't do salads until 1130.
8730140	8733140	LOL. It's time for red velvet pancakes.
8733140	8734140	Yeah, I know, right?
8734140	8737140	Well, I got like Hawaiian bread French toast, which is really good.
8737140	8741140	Don't get me wrong, but probably not the healthiest thing I could eat.
8741140	8745140	Whereas Alan's like, well, I was going to eat the veggie omelet,
8745140	8748140	but I decided I'd go a little dairy and get turkey.
8750140	8752140	By the way, Alan has lost like a lot of weight.
8752140	8755140	I was about to say, Alan's doing really, really well.
8755140	8760140	You think I would like, you know, try to take some cues and do the same thing.
8760140	8765140	Now you can be the like, what's the old-ass poem Jack Spratt and his wife?
8765140	8767140	Well, here's the thing.
8767140	8770140	Alan's got the advantage on me where he walks to work and all that.
8770140	8773140	And I've been very bad when it gets too motivated for exercise.
8773140	8775140	Like I really need to really motivate myself to exercise.
8775140	8777140	It's the only way I'm ever going to change things.
8777140	8780140	And then snacking. I am a terrible, terrible snacker.
8780140	8782140	Like that is my weakness.
8782140	8787140	I really need to just get rid of every horrible snack out of this house
8787140	8789140	and have nothing but carrots and celery in the fridge so I have no choice.
8789140	8790140	But then that's not fair at all.
8790140	8793140	On Fridays at our work, they pop popcorn in the popcorn machine that we have.
8793140	8795140	And I'm not talking about like a popcorn machine like an air popper.
8795140	8800140	I'm talking about a big fucking popcorn machine that they have at the movie theater's popcorn machine.
8800140	8802140	They pop extra popcorn for me.
8802140	8806140	They gave me a bowl. Like a big-ass bowl.
8806140	8810140	I eat more popcorn at that company than the fucking people at the company other than me.
8810140	8812140	Of course, I don't eat it all.
8812140	8815140	I normally skip lunch that day, but that's a lot of popcorn.
8815140	8816140	That's a lot of popcorn.
8816140	8817140	Some questions in the chat room.
8817140	8819140	Acidic Vampire in the chat says,
8819140	8821140	Red velvet pancakes? The fuck? I want that.
8821140	8823140	Is that a West Coast thing for Jack in the Box?
8823140	8824140	No, no, no, no, no, no.
8824140	8827140	Don't get them, by the way, at Denny's because they're awful.
8827140	8828140	They just like hush puppies.
8828140	8829140	They're just red food coloring. Yes.
8829140	8832140	Denny's does have the red velvet, but it's not like, it's not.
8832140	8836140	It's on the Hobbit menu so it gives you cancer and makes you live underground.
8836140	8837140	So here's the thing.
8837140	8839140	They don't have that at Jack in the Box.
8839140	8841140	No. Jack in the Box has deep fried tacos.
8841140	8843140	That's what you get at Jack in the Box.
8843140	8844140	Red velvet pancakes.
8844140	8847140	We went to a brunch place once and they happen to have red velvet pancakes.
8847140	8849140	It was like, oh my God.
8849140	8850140	That we went to.
8850140	8851140	Was it Red Rabbit?
8851140	8852140	I think so.
8852140	8854140	I went to have the pumpkin and you had red velvet.
8854140	8856140	Yeah. Fucking amazing.
8856140	8858140	I want pancakes now.
8858140	8860140	Good times. Pancakes.
8860140	8862140	All right. That's it for the FUs of the week.
8862140	8863140	Skype line soon.
8863140	8864140	Twitter topic soon as well.
8864140	8867140	But first, a couple more news stories.
8867140	8868140	All right.
8868140	8870140	And let's see here.
8870140	8882140	Let's talk a little bit about the next generation of Kinect because of course we know that the next Xbox system is going to have Kinect and we need to know what the hell it's going to be able to do.
8882140	8884140	Well, this may be kind of an idea.
8884140	8894140	The company that was behind the Kinect sensor in the first place has this cool video that they put out kind of showing what it's going to do.
8894140	8901140	And basically everything that the original Kinect was supposed to do but didn't actually kind of do.
8901140	8903140	You know, the whole closed thing.
8903140	8913140	They're saying that they're going to try to work this technology into pretty much everything into like, you know, non display stuff to all the computers.
8913140	8914140	And it's just going to work.
8914140	8918140	It's going to have, you know, high speed tracking, all that stuff.
8918140	8925140	And actually the little thing that they've got there, the prototype looks exactly like the Kinect with some extra bullshit sticking out of the top.
8925140	8929140	I'm not really sure what the hell that is, but it's in developers hands right now.
8929140	8934140	So they're going to be using this and it's called Capri.
8934140	8939140	The next generation of sensors.
8939140	8941140	The next generation.
8941140	8946140	Yeah, they're saying it's supposed to have they're going to be trying to fit it into everyday devices.
8946140	8950140	And they're seeing it the same resolution as the Kinect.
8950140	8953140	And it looks it looks pretty cool.
8953140	8961140	I mean, the video like watching the video reminded me a lot of just like everything like they show this guy at a presentation.
8961140	8968140	He's, you know, you know, manipulating stuff on the screen as you would think, you know, that you would be able to do.
8968140	8976140	You know, there's talking about like, you know, even stuff to where, you know, oh, hey, I have someone coming over and facial recognition.
8976140	8977140	Oh, it's my friend.
8977140	8979140	It's going to unlock the door for him.
8979140	8981140	And then he comes in and murders you.
8981140	8988140	You know, that's for like switching channels on your TV by just like kind of going and moving my hand back and forth.
8988140	8991140	That type of stuff, because, you know, pushing buttons are both so hard.
8991140	8993140	Move my hand back and forth.
8993140	8997140	Swiping a fly away. Your TV's going crazy.
8997140	9000140	All right. One more news story for you guys.
9000140	9005140	OK, this isn't gaming technically, but it is the voice of geeks network, you guys.
9005140	9008140	So once in a while, we got to blur the line a little bit.
9008140	9017140	And this has to do with a musician who did make one of like the greatest video game songs of the past 10 years still alive from Portal.
9017140	9020140	Right.
9020140	9024140	I'm making a joke. Oh, I'm talking about Jonathan.
9024140	9027140	So nice in person.
9027140	9029140	He's a lovable nerd.
9029140	9036140	And so, of course, the Internet rallied to his defense when people kind of wronged him.
9036140	9039140	This has to do with the Glee issue.
9039140	9043140	Here's the thing. An upcoming episode of Glee is going to feature Baby Got Back.
9043140	9046140	Now, Baby Got Back was a Sir Mix-a-Lot song.
9046140	9052140	But a few years ago, I think it was 2006, Joko did his own version of Baby Got Back.
9052140	9054140	And it was very different.
9061140	9063140	The Joko version.
9068140	9070140	You never heard this, huh?
9070140	9072140	I listened to it after.
9072140	9075140	The lounge version by Lounge Against the Machine.
9075140	9077140	Right, right.
9077140	9079140	Yeah, Richard Cheeze.
9079140	9081140	And, you know, of course, Mr. Mix-a-Lot.
9081140	9084140	So technically it is Sir Mix-a-Lot's song.
9084140	9086140	And Joko did a cover.
9086140	9088140	He did a cover, but it was a licensed cover.
9088140	9091140	He licensed the rights to do that and he made his own original version.
9091140	9094140	It's very unique and, you know, very different.
9094140	9097140	It's kind of like Johnny Cash's Hurt.
9097140	9099140	Like the Nine Inch Nails version. Amazing.
9099140	9101140	Johnny Cash's version.
9101140	9103140	Fucking amazing.
9103140	9105140	It's hard for me to say that because I love the Nine Inch Nails version so much.
9105140	9108140	But they are both so fucking good.
9108140	9113140	When Trent Reznor is saying that he likes it better, then you know you've got amazing.
9113140	9115140	But here's the problem.
9115140	9117140	Glee, the TV show.
9117140	9120140	They do a lot of covers and all that stuff.
9120140	9128140	Here is the Glee version of Baby Got Back set to be on the Sadie Hawkins episode that will be on the 24th.
9128140	9131140	This song was available in the US iTunes store.
9131140	9134140	It was pulled. It was still spotted on the Swedish iTunes store.
9134140	9136140	So yes, this is legit.
9136140	9139140	See if you see any similarities here in the Glee version of Baby Got Back.
9158140	9162140	I think I heard that before somewhere.
9162140	9164140	Look.
9164140	9167140	It's one thing to cover the song, especially when you're going to do it.
9167140	9169140	Like the original.
9169140	9172140	I don't think I need to play the original version of Baby Got Back.
9172140	9177140	But I'll do the Rob Roberts cover of Baby Got Back.
9177140	9178140	You ready?
9178140	9180140	Oh. My. God.
9180140	9182140	Becky, look at her butt.
9182140	9184140	It is so big.
9184140	9186140	Obviously the original was very, very different.
9186140	9188140	It had the whole beat to it.
9188140	9193140	So for Glee to just totally rip this off the way they did is kind of shitty.
9193140	9195140	It's really shitty.
9195140	9198140	To think that nobody would notice is crazy.
9198140	9204140	Now, just so you know, Joko, what is making the internet rally around him is that he posted to his Twitter.
9204140	9206140	I had no idea.
9206140	9208140	He had no clue.
9208140	9210140	And he's like, WTF.
9210140	9212140	And he is trying to see what kind of legal action is available at this point, but it's complicated.
9212140	9216140	I mean, it wasn't really his song in the first place, although it was his arrangement.
9216140	9219140	Here's the best part. You might be getting to this, Loki.
9219140	9227140	In the lyrics, if I were to play the full thing, a part where he changed the lyrics from Sir Mix-a-Lot to Johnny C.
9227140	9231140	Glee sings in their version, Johnny C.
9231140	9233140	So you know damn well where they got it.
9233140	9235140	There is no mystery.
9235140	9237140	They removed one of them at the end.
9237140	9242140	The 1-900, he did something else.
9242140	9244140	1-900 something and then he changed it.
9248140	9250140	I mean, come on, man.
9250140	9252140	That is just blatant.
9252140	9257140	And even he said they stole the arrangement.
9257140	9264140	There's actually duck sounds or something in the background that he sampled or something that are in that song in exactly the same spot.
9264140	9267140	Like they stole the instrumental and just sang over it.
9272140	9274140	So yeah, I don't know what's going to happen from here.
9274140	9277140	Do you think legally he could do anything about it?
9277140	9278140	Yeah, he can. I think he can.
9278140	9280140	If they actually stole the lyrics or whatever?
9280140	9282140	Yeah, because it's his arrangement.
9282140	9284140	I think that he definitely has a case.
9286140	9291140	Well, gee, the folks in the chat rooms really seem to be enjoying the Rob Roberts cover of Baby Got Back.
9291140	9293140	So big butts and I cannot lie.
9293140	9295140	You other brothers can't deny.
9300140	9301140	The original is awesome.
9301140	9303140	Meanwhile, Alan is like, please stop.
9303140	9304140	Please don't.
9304140	9305140	Knock it off.
9305140	9307140	Yeah, but Alan, you weren't here watching Rob shake his ass.
9309140	9311140	I like Ross Steel UT's comment.
9311140	9313140	Seriously, that's some Milli Vanilli shit.
9315140	9317140	There's a little bit of a clap that I heard in the beginning.
9317140	9324140	I want them to do the vanilla ice defense where it's like, but see, mine went, you know, the original went boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
9324140	9327140	But mine went boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
9327140	9329140	You see, it's different, right?
9329140	9330140	Totally.
9330140	9332140	It's totally different.
9332140	9334140	We added the the in there.
9334140	9335140	It makes it different.
9335140	9336140	Yeah.
9336140	9337140	So under pressure.
9337140	9339140	Rama in the chat says, wait, hold it.
9339140	9343140	Glee is still relevant apparently, but it's sinking in the ratings, but they're going to I think I heard they're going to.
9344140	9351140	I want to know, OK, because it's supposed to be this new guy that's coming to the school or whatever that's hitting on the the, you know, the clearly gay guy on the show.
9351140	9358140	Isn't it a little awkward to be singing a song about I like big butts and like about all these things about butts that you like and stuff?
9358140	9360140	Because it seems a little weird.
9360140	9361140	I mean.
9362140	9363140	I don't know.
9364140	9368140	It's just a weird song anyway, because no one over 12 watches Glee in the first place.
9369140	9374140	And honestly, the people that, you know, watch Glee or whatever, do they really know what baby got back is?
9374140	9378140	I mean, a lot of the kids were probably not even born when that song came out.
9381140	9382140	I don't know.
9382140	9383140	Is it that old?
9383140	9384140	All I do.
9384140	9386140	I just I just wish Glee would get canceled.
9386140	9387140	That's what I wish.
9388140	9389140	All right.
9390140	9392140	That does it for news tonight.
9392140	9393140	That was the last story.
9394140	9396140	1877 Game OLR.
9396140	9399140	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9399140	9402140	The Skype line is open right now if you want to give us a call.
9402140	9405140	And while we wait for some calls to come in.
9405140	9407140	Oh, it is already lighting up on the phone.
9407140	9410140	Let's go to the phones and say hello to whoever's on the line.
9410140	9412140	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9412140	9413140	Who's this?
9413140	9414140	Hi.
9414140	9415140	Hi.
9415140	9416140	Is that Bobby Blackwolf?
9416140	9417140	It's Bobby.
9417140	9418140	Hi, Bobby.
9418140	9420140	You don't sound so good, Bobby.
9420140	9423140	I feel like a sad panda or I should say a sad little birdie.
9423140	9424140	What's wrong, Bobby?
9424140	9425140	Sportsball.
9425140	9429140	Oh, did you have a rough day at work?
9431140	9432140	I need to cheer up.
9432140	9433140	Are there any new games coming out?
9433140	9434140	I need a diversion.
9434140	9435140	Not really.
9435140	9436140	Double may cry.
9436140	9437140	There's Nino Cooney.
9437140	9439140	Nino Cooney's coming out this week, Bobby.
9441140	9443140	You could try the demo.
9445140	9447140	You could try your face.
9447140	9448140	Hey, wait.
9448140	9450140	Bobby, that's a response after my own heart.
9450140	9452140	That's the Jamie defense right there.
9452140	9456140	Okay, Bobby, it's just a game, Bobby.
9456140	9459140	Here, I got something to help you out, okay?
9459140	9462140	Let's go back to a time when your team was winning things,
9462140	9465140	which I don't know if that actually exists,
9465140	9469140	but we'll make believe that there was a time your team was winning things.
9469140	9474140	No, seriously, you posted on Twitter this week some classic G4 material,
9474140	9478140	which is appropriately timed with the whole G4 officially dead,
9478140	9481140	even though many of us say it had the life sucked out of it years ago.
9481140	9488140	You were posting some classic stuff from G4's little 2020-style show Pulse, right?
9488140	9489140	Right.
9489140	9492140	It wasn't 2020 as much as it was just the news.
9492140	9495140	It kind of had a 2020 vibe to me, but yeah.
9495140	9499140	How many legit gamer news shows do you see on TV now?
9499140	9500140	Not a lot.
9500140	9502140	Yeah, exactly.
9502140	9507140	But it was a clip from the Philly Classic Game Expo, right?
9507140	9513140	Right. It was from 2004, in I think March of 2004,
9513140	9515140	and it was the Philly Classic Gaming Expo,
9515140	9519140	and I was actually a co-organizer of it along with a couple other people,
9519140	9523140	one of which was another moderator on the forums over at G4.
9523140	9529140	We had all converged on Philly Classic 4 the year before,
9529140	9532140	and we kind of had a table, and it was kind of a G4 forum meetup and stuff,
9532140	9534140	and we had about 15 people.
9534140	9537140	And for Philly Classic 5, it was like 50 people.
9537140	9540140	It was kind of like our PAX08 experience.
9540140	9542140	Yeah, oh man, I love PAX08.
9542140	9544140	But it was basically the G4 version of it.
9544140	9545140	Right.
9545140	9549140	And what a lot of people in the OR audience latched onto
9549140	9552140	was the fact that when I was on it, Beardless,
9552140	9554140	because this was before the beard,
9554140	9557140	there was a little bit of Bimani behind me,
9557140	9561140	and that was actually my setup at the show.
9561140	9565140	So as much as I rag on Bimani now, it wasn't dead then.
9565140	9568140	I think 7th Style had just come out maybe,
9568140	9570140	or it was right around that time.
9570140	9572140	I'm not dead yet.
9572140	9575140	And this was before Guitar Hero, so I'm like,
9575140	9578140	these are classics, instant classics, that's what I'll call it.
9578140	9583140	And he wanted some Ruddy Gore, Mark Wolf, who's in the video.
9583140	9586140	He kind of wanted some other different type of stuff,
9586140	9588140	so I'm like, fine, I'll bring my stuff,
9588140	9590140	all my import consoles and everything,
9590140	9593140	and I brought my stereo system and they provided the TV,
9593140	9598140	and I would run that weekend, I think I ran Beatmania 2DX,
9598140	9601140	I had Para Para Paradise, which we played once,
9601140	9605140	because of just the spacing.
9605140	9609140	I had Taiko no Tetsujin, and I had Donkey Konga,
9609140	9611140	I had both versions.
9611140	9615140	And Tommy Tallarico was the first time he had ever played it.
9615140	9616140	Oh wow.
9616140	9618140	And so one of the pictures I posted up on Twitter
9618140	9621140	was actually Tommy Tallarico playing Taiko no Tetsujin for the first time.
9621140	9623140	Oh, funny.
9623140	9625140	Because he was there, he was one of the guests there,
9625140	9630140	they actually had, I think it was Philly Classic 4,
9630140	9632140	they actually had, and I can't remember her name,
9632140	9635140	but the woman from Tron?
9635140	9637140	Olivia Wilde?
9637140	9639140	No, the original Tron.
9639140	9642140	Oh, Wendy, they did the music, right?
9642140	9646140	No, the woman who played the love interest.
9646140	9648140	Oh!
9648140	9651140	I think it's the only thing she's ever done that anybody remembers.
9651140	9653140	Because there was a movement to bring her back for the new movie,
9653140	9655140	it didn't work.
9655140	9659140	Yeah, but that's where I met Sid Meier,
9659140	9661140	showed up there, and in Philly Classic 5,
9661140	9664140	they had Howard Scott Warshaw, who made E.T. and all that stuff.
9664140	9667140	But it was a lot of fun, and I exposed a lot of people to that.
9667140	9671140	And then I also would run Guitar Man and Rez, as well.
9671140	9674140	So it was a whole music game, my area was like the music game area.
9674140	9678140	It looked like a lot of fun, even though music games that you were bringing
9678140	9681140	maybe weren't quote-unquote classic games,
9681140	9685140	still, I like the instant classic touch on it, it was still a convention.
9685140	9688140	Music games show up at every convention, deal with it.
9688140	9691140	Other people had the DDR stuff, I'm like,
9691140	9693140	I don't do the DDR, I'm doing all the other stuff.
9693140	9695140	There you go, trying to bring the other stuff to life.
9695140	9698140	If you like DDR, then you might like...
9699140	9702140	Why, I mean, it's not running anymore, though, right?
9702140	9705140	It folded, I'm sure business reasons or whatever.
9705140	9708140	They wanted to, we had big plans for Philly Classic 6,
9708140	9712140	but unfortunately, the people that were up in Philadelphia that ran it,
9712140	9714140	there was a little bit of drama.
9714140	9717140	Essentially, the short version that I kind of remember
9717140	9720140	is that they had kind of passed the keys on to another guy
9720140	9723140	who completely changed the show,
9723140	9727140	and he changed it to something else, and it folded after two or three years.
9727140	9729140	So they had trusted somebody else with it,
9729140	9732140	and he's like, yeah, the classic games are kind of cool and stuff,
9732140	9735140	but we're going to expand.
9735140	9740140	And he thought, really, really big, and then it petered out.
9742140	9746140	That sucks. You should definitely check out some day.
9746140	9748140	I know it involves traveling to California,
9748140	9751140	but California Extreme is an awesome classic game show
9751140	9753140	with all the old-school arcade machines and stuff.
9753140	9755140	That's the kind of thing I think of.
9755140	9757140	It's really, really lots of fun.
9759140	9762140	There was one of the local arcade distributors
9762140	9766140	that still worked in arcades with a lot of the classic systems.
9766140	9768140	They were on the East Coast somewhere,
9768140	9773140	but they brought 50 arcade machines all set to free play to this show.
9773140	9777140	Basically, what we did is, leading up to my little rhythm game thing,
9777140	9780140	they had the gaming experience through time.
9780140	9782140	You could go up and go to these consoles,
9782140	9787140	and they started at the Magnavox Odyssey and then an Atari 2600,
9787140	9790140	all going up to Xbox, PlayStation 2 and stuff.
9790140	9796140	So you could actually go down the line and see the next console in time.
9796140	9798140	It's like an interactive timeline.
9798140	9799140	Yeah.
9799140	9800140	Awesome.
9800140	9802140	We did stuff like that, and it was a lot of fun.
9802140	9806140	Many folks in chat saying, we should have a vogcon.
9806140	9808140	We could have a vogcon some day.
9808140	9810140	It's not outside the realm of possibility.
9810140	9812140	And then Brad from Pod Culture,
9812140	9815140	why don't you have vogcon in Atlanta the day before Dragon Con?
9815140	9818140	Yeah, because why don't we just have it at Dragon Con?
9818140	9820140	Probably the smartest idea.
9820140	9824140	I think certainly there should be, whether it's official or unofficial,
9824140	9828140	a vog event at Dragon Con is certainly within the realm of possibility for this year.
9828140	9831140	Well, I've said we're going to have an official event.
9831140	9834140	That's pretty much been confirmed to me.
9834140	9837140	Obviously, I won't know for certain until next month.
9837140	9838140	Right.
9838140	9844140	No, we've already got an official panel, which means we'll be in the program and all that stuff.
9844140	9850140	But then other events, there's a huge gaming area, tabletop gaming area downstairs,
9850140	9854140	and we could easily commandeer a corner of that one night.
9854140	9855140	Awesome.
9855140	9856140	For just us.
9856140	9859140	So it sounds like if you want to meet as many vog people as possible,
9859140	9861140	Atlanta's going to be the place to be Labor Day weekend.
9861140	9862140	That's right.
9862140	9863140	There you go.
9863140	9864140	You should do it.
9864140	9866140	I won't be as depressed about sportsball.
9866140	9867140	What's that?
9867140	9869140	I won't be as depressed about sportsball.
9869140	9870140	Yes, it'll all be over by then.
9870140	9873140	If the Niners lose in a couple weeks, we'll make you feel better?
9873140	9877140	No, see, I want them to win now because that means we lost to the champions.
9877140	9879140	Ah, that's a good way of thinking about it.
9879140	9882140	And here's the thing that made it worse, the sportsball thing worse,
9882140	9886140	is because of the whole video game industry tie-in on my Twitter.
9886140	9891140	The majority of the video game industry, especially the PR contacts, guess where they live?
9891140	9894140	Of course, the Bay Area. I know that, yes.
9894140	9898140	So I did not check my personal Twitter all day. I just could not take it.
9898140	9899140	Couldn't handle it.
9899140	9903140	Actually, I think the saddest picture you posted was the confetti cannon behind you guys,
9903140	9905140	and you just put unused.
9905140	9907140	Yes, it was right there.
9907140	9911140	I actually took another picture of just my drum next to it and everybody else had left.
9911140	9914140	It was just my drum next to the confetti cannon, but yeah.
9917140	9920140	I'm sorry. Hey, there's always next year.
9920140	9921140	There is.
9921140	9927140	Well, Bobby, focus on the positive. Lots of good things coming with VOG and all that in the future.
9927140	9931140	You did not have a show this week, sadly, but tell the folks where they can catch you next week.
9931140	9938140	Right here on VOG. I'm the opening act, and I will be live next week.
9938140	9941140	I will not be live the following week because of sportsball.
9941140	9946140	And that was the other bad, because I go to a party because it's time I see a lot of my friends,
9946140	9949140	and so I never do a show on the big super sportsball day.
9949140	9950140	Right.
9950140	9954140	The first couple messages I got from my friends, instead of saying,
9954140	9959140	oh man, sorry, and all that stuff, and yeah, it was a closed game, blah, blah, blah.
9959140	9964140	No, they were like, yes, this means you're coming to our Super Bowl party and bringing your pizza dip.
9964140	9965140	And I was like, guys.
9965140	9969140	Would you have actually had to fly to wherever they were having the Super Bowl this year?
9969140	9972140	The plan was we were going to go to New Orleans.
9972140	9977140	Even if we couldn't get into the game, we were going to do events, corporate events around New Orleans,
9977140	9979140	maybe playing some of the bars.
9979140	9984140	We'd march the tailgates outside of the Superdome, and then we'd go to a bar and watch the game at a bar.
9984140	9988140	Tell me more about this pizza dip.
9988140	9991140	It's a trade secret.
9991140	9996140	Maybe Loki will have a reason to come to Atlanta if the wife will let him.
9996140	10002140	All right, so visit our co-headliner, Bobby Blackwell, Sunday nights at the Voice of the Geeks Network, 5 o'clock.
10002140	10007140	We may actually end up being off on that Sunday too, the Super Sunday as well.
10007140	10010140	It's our lowest rated night of the year for obvious reasons.
10010140	10016140	And I also was given a tip that it is the best day to go to a theme park near here.
10016140	10019140	Not Disneyland, but one of the other ones, Magic Mountain.
10019140	10021140	So I may go to Magic Mountain.
10021140	10022140	All right.
10022140	10023140	We'll see.
10023140	10024140	So, yep.
10024140	10025140	And so thank you.
10025140	10026140	You guys cheered me up.
10026140	10027140	Thank you, guys.
10027140	10028140	Oh, thank you.
10028140	10029140	I'm glad we could.
10029140	10033140	And I'm glad we get to have you at the end of our show because you're always kind enough to have us on every week.
10033140	10036140	I also cheered you up by beating all your scores on For the Horizon.
10036140	10037140	Stop it.
10037140	10038140	All right.
10038140	10039140	Go kick his ass.
10039140	10041140	Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.
10041140	10043140	Making hearts in your direction.
10043140	10044140	Oh, thank you.
10044140	10048140	Because I feel bad for your team.
10048140	10049140	Oh, my God.
10049140	10052140	You got dark Sakura kind of to care about football.
10052140	10054140	That should make you feel better than anything else.
10054140	10057140	And see, I would have gotten a ring.
10057140	10061140	If we had gone in two weeks and one, I would have gotten a ring.
10061140	10063140	Well, you know what?
10063140	10065140	There's always next year?
10065140	10068140	At Dragon Con, I'll get you some onion rings.
10068140	10069140	How's that sound?
10069140	10071140	From the varsity.
10071140	10076140	They should understand that they should launch the puppy out of the cannon for a puppy bowl.
10076140	10077140	No.
10077140	10078140	Half time.
10078140	10079140	I'm letting you go, Bobby.
10079140	10080140	Take care.
10080140	10081140	All right.
10081140	10082140	Maybe a ferret instead.
10082140	10085140	One eight seven seven game.
10085140	10087140	All our user name on Skype is orange launch radio.
10087140	10090140	Bobby was a little bit longer than we usually have the calls, but he's Bobby.
10090140	10092140	He can do that.
10092140	10093140	Anyhow.
10093140	10095140	Also, we got Twitter topics coming in.
10095140	10097140	Twitter dot com slash O L R.
10097140	10100140	And we can read some of those topics here.
10103140	10104140	Let's see.
10104140	10105140	Oh, no.
10105140	10106140	We got more calls coming in.
10106140	10107140	Never mind.
10107140	10108140	Let's take the calls instead.
10108140	10109140	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10109140	10110140	Who's this?
10112140	10113140	Hello.
10113140	10114140	It's Code Man.
10114140	10116140	Down for maintenance podcast.
10116140	10117140	How you doing?
10117140	10118140	Code Man from Down for maintenance podcast.
10118140	10120140	How you guys doing?
10120140	10121140	You know.
10121140	10122140	All right.
10122140	10123140	Great football news today.
10123140	10125140	But, you know, I like your picture.
10125140	10126140	It's very army.
10126140	10128140	Yeah, that's my tattoo.
10128140	10130140	What does your tattoo say?
10130140	10134140	I know you didn't call in to talk about that, but I'm asking anyway.
10134140	10136140	Whatever our souls are made of.
10136140	10137140	Hers and mine are the same.
10137140	10140140	It's for me and my wife.
10140140	10141140	Adorable.
10141140	10142140	Oh, wow.
10142140	10143140	Jeez.
10143140	10147140	Well, after the Bobby call and then now this little aw, I kind of feel down.
10147140	10148140	But that was good.
10148140	10149140	Thank you.
10149140	10150140	I appreciate that.
10150140	10151140	Well, we cheered Bobby up.
10151140	10153140	What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
10153140	10158140	Well, you know, that call, it kind of made me think of, you know, I live in Oklahoma.
10158140	10166140	Our team, our sports ball team, our college team didn't do very well this year either.
10166140	10170140	But we usually do, you know, pretty well.
10170140	10175140	We just didn't show up to any of the games mentally, I guess you would say.
10175140	10176140	Look on the bright side.
10176140	10179140	Your college team, at least their girlfriends are real.
10179140	10180140	True.
10180140	10181140	There you go.
10181140	10182140	Right.
10182140	10183140	Yeah.
10183140	10186140	No, I just wanted to call and say hi to you guys.
10186140	10191140	And, you know, I this is actually I'm actually getting a chance to call you guys.
10191140	10195140	The baby is asleep and I'm actually getting a chance to call in.
10195140	10197140	So I'm excited about that.
10197140	10201140	Well, I'll bring this up because I'm looking through the Twitter topics for tonight.
10201140	10203140	And I noticed you sent us a tweet.
10203140	10207140	And after show this to people in studio, you tweeted me with a power glove.
10207140	10209140	Ah, it's so bad.
10209140	10211140	You actually tweeted us a picture of yourself.
10211140	10215140	I'm showing the others in studio there a picture of you holding the power glove.
10215140	10217140	And I like this little artsy pose you're doing with it, too.
10217140	10221140	It's very like I really like your scarf.
10221140	10222140	Yeah.
10222140	10223140	Thank you.
10223140	10224140	You got a scarf.
10224140	10227140	It's very hipster, but not in a douchebag way.
10227140	10228140	I like it.
10228140	10232140	Well, that was actually that was a very that was a very drunken night.
10232140	10236140	I don't like to talk about it, but oh, I see.
10236140	10238140	No, I was over at a friend's house and he had a power glove.
10238140	10242140	He just had it up on display because I think that's pretty much all you can really do with it.
10242140	10246140	And we took it down and started taking a whole bunch of pictures.
10246140	10250140	And I actually took a picture punching him in the face with it, too.
10250140	10252140	So that was that was pretty funny.
10252140	10254140	Well, they call it a power glove for a reason.
10254140	10256140	So obviously, yeah.
10256140	10258140	No, I I listen to you guys show.
10258140	10267140	And I I just oh, just, you know, like like John on on our podcast, he's from he's from California as well.
10267140	10274140	And it just makes me just so sad at all the stuff that you guys can do in California and I can't do here in Oklahoma.
10274140	10276140	And it makes me it just makes me sad.
10276140	10278140	Well, however, you have Waffle House, right?
10278140	10285140	We do have Waffle House, although you don't really want to go in there most of the time because some of the plates are a little a little dirty.
10285140	10289140	But you have Waffle House and you should be glad for that fact because we don't have Waffle House and we never will.
10289140	10296140	And I was going to say Oklahoma at least has Dunkin Donuts and we're not getting those until apparently 2015 is announced this week.
10296140	10298140	But at least we're finally going to get them in SoCal.
10298140	10300140	I miss Waffle House, Rob.
10300140	10301140	Wow.
10301140	10302140	Good.
10302140	10303140	I want no. Yes, it is.
10303140	10305140	I want my chocolate chip pancakes extra crispy.
10305140	10306140	Thank you.
10306140	10308140	Those are good. Those are very good.
10308140	10310140	What are you allowing the fact that we don't have Dunkin Donuts here?
10310140	10311140	Yeah.
10311140	10313140	I figured you probably would.
10313140	10314140	No, no.
10314140	10320140	It's the it is like the number one thing when I tell people on the East Coast, like, you know, because I'll go out to visit.
10320140	10322140	I'll go to New York or even when I was at PAX.
10322140	10323140	I'm like, fuck, yes.
10323140	10324140	We've got to go to Dunkin Donuts.
10324140	10326140	Oh, my God. I haven't had Dunkin Donuts in forever. We got to go.
10326140	10328140	And like my friends are like, the fuck?
10328140	10330140	Like, really? I'm like, no, you don't understand.
10330140	10331140	I live in California.
10331140	10332140	I don't have Dunkin Donuts.
10332140	10334140	And they're like, where the fuck do you get donuts?
10334140	10337140	I made tiara drive me to Dunkin Donuts in Las Vegas.
10337140	10338140	Yeah. I mean, they don't.
10338140	10342140	It's it's Mon Pop stores or if you can find a Krispy Kreme that didn't go under.
10342140	10343140	That's it.
10343140	10344140	Wow.
10344140	10345140	Krispy Kreme.
10345140	10346140	Krispy Kreme.
10346140	10349140	Yeah. Krispy Kreme is few and far between in Oklahoma.
10349140	10352140	There's a couple of them around where I live.
10352140	10355140	But yeah, they're they're pretty hard to find.
10355140	10358140	Krispy Kreme in Alabama is like Starbucks.
10358140	10363140	Yeah, that's what we have here. Starbucks everywhere.
10363140	10364140	Krispy Kreme.
10364140	10366140	Well, trying to bring it back to video games a little bit.
10366140	10370140	I know you have been playing a little more Forza Horizon lately as well.
10370140	10372140	I know that's something you were talking about on Down for Maintenance.
10372140	10374140	So what are your thoughts on Forza?
10374140	10375140	I love it.
10375140	10378140	And I'll tell you the reason why I love it.
10378140	10380140	And I've mentioned this on my podcast.
10380140	10384140	I said, you know, I I think the last.
10384140	10386140	Oh, my dryer just went off.
10386140	10395140	The last the last racing game I played was like Cruising USA and like Bowling Alley arcade.
10395140	10400140	And so and so it brings I don't know, it kind of brings me back to that kind of racing.
10400140	10402140	It's very arcadey. And I like that about it.
10402140	10411140	And and the fact that you can you can race against people in your car club and then and then you can have your car club race against other people.
10411140	10413140	And I think that's a really, really neat concept.
10413140	10415140	Of course, they could have had that before.
10415140	10420140	And I just never discovered racing games on, you know, these kinds of consoles.
10420140	10422140	But I don't know. It's a really fun game.
10422140	10428140	Although I really, really want to race somebody in the car club and I haven't raced them yet.
10428140	10431140	Well, we're going to try to set a date and time for either this week or next.
10431140	10435140	We'll we'll tweet about it. We need everybody possible to come join in on the fun.
10435140	10439140	So look out for that, including Loki. Yes.
10439140	10443140	Well, Loki, he's all over it. He's been on that thing like white on rice, man.
10443140	10446140	It's crazy. Absolutely. Absolutely.
10446140	10448140	I kind of took a break to make more details.
10448140	10452140	In fact, I'm making a spoiler, a sticker for the back of my car.
10452140	10456140	The back of my car is this. How are you? How am I driving? One eight seven seven game.
10458140	10461140	It's advertisement. Yeah, it's all over the car.
10461140	10464140	You are so dumb, but I love it. All right.
10464140	10470140	Code man, tell the folks how they can tune into your podcast, which you you do Google Hangouts and stuff now, too.
10470140	10472140	Right. You guys. Yeah. You're playing with your format.
10472140	10475140	Are you going to you're going to switch to video or what?
10475140	10478140	We kind of do it back and forth every once in a while.
10478140	10481140	We just kind of dabble in audio and video.
10481140	10487140	But yeah, you can find us on YouTube at YouTube dot com backslash the DFM podcast.
10487140	10490140	And you can follow us on Twitter at the DFM podcast.
10490140	10495140	Then, of course, you can find us on iTunes at the DFM.
10495140	10500140	Just look search for the DFM or the down for maintenance podcast.
10500140	10502140	And yeah, we should be on there.
10502140	10508140	We're we're on our eighth episode, actually, the next episode, which you dark soccer are going to guest on.
10508140	10512140	Yes. If you if you remember, I haven't sent you a reminder.
10512140	10517140	So I don't know. I put it on my phone. So I've got everything.
10517140	10520140	I have an alarm going off. That's what you've got to be is in the phone.
10520140	10526140	I've made new plans that kind of stat because, you know, I wanted to get all three of you guys on all at once.
10526140	10533140	But I you know, I knew that, you know, with with all kinds of different, you know, time schedules and stuff like that, I probably couldn't manage that.
10533140	10537140	So, you know, we will have all three of you on now. So that's awesome.
10537140	10542140	Well, thank you very much for having us on and expertly plugged. Appreciate it. Best of luck with your show.
10542140	10548140	Thank you very much, Rob. Tell the guys over there. I said hi at your next show. We will. All right. Take care, buddy.
10548140	10550140	See ya. See ya.
10550140	10553140	Whoa. We can squeeze in one more call. One eight seven seven game.
10553140	10556140	O.L.R. or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio. All one word.
10556140	10560140	Going to some more Twitter topics. SGA 100 Max sending us a couple tweets.
10560140	10565140	A pinball arcade museum in L.A. that is run by just one woman.
10565140	10570140	How have I not heard of this place? It's in L.A. I could go there on my way to Disneyland someday.
10570140	10575140	I'm trying to bring up the link right now. It is on a place called Arcade Heroes.
10575140	10579140	Let's see. It is in the L.A. area. It's called Pins and Needles.
10579140	10584140	I love it. This place looks awesome. I'm going to do more research on that.
10584140	10589140	You can check that out at arcadeheroes.com. That's the link that SSJ100 Matt just sent us.
10589140	10593140	That would be a great name for a store that sells jukeboxes and pinball machines.
10593140	10597140	Yeah. Let's see. Something he saw at Magfest.
10597140	10602140	An original Atari 2600 game with the classic cartridge box and manual.
10602140	10608140	CGE Adventures. It is amazing how people are still making stuff for the Atari 2600 even today.
10608140	10615140	You can get all kinds of repros of stuff that were prototypes. Repro prototypes.
10615140	10617140	That's how we have a millipede for 5200.
10617140	10626140	Even some of those flashback consoles had some of the design challenge winners.
10627140	10634140	Funny enough, I remember Bobby earlier was talking about Howard Scott Warshaw at the Expo in Philly.
10634140	10639140	Saboteur, his last game, I think, was one of those games that showed up in a flashback console at some point.
10639140	10644140	It's kind of interesting. You do still see those show up in one place or another.
10644140	10648140	Again, 1877 Game O.L.R. or a username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.
10648140	10655140	Tiger Koa sending us some tweets. More League of Legends players banned for toxic behavior.
10655140	10660140	Apparently League of Legends is not going to put up with that shit anymore where people are harassing other people.
10660140	10666140	Banned two prominent esports players for their toxic behavior in game.
10666140	10674140	The peak harassment score placed the account among the worst .06 of all European accounts this month.
10674140	10677140	That was InVision's account. He was banned.
10677140	10680140	You know what? Good for them.
10680140	10683140	Be accountable for your attitude in games.
10683140	10687140	People want to be so anonymous. I've been doing a lot of PVP and WoW this week.
10687140	10690140	I'll talk about this on Hoard House. Plug plug later.
10690140	10694140	Just some toxic fucking attitudes in these games that ruin it for everybody.
10694140	10700140	I'm really glad to hear that League of Legends has taken some drastic moves to eliminate that shit.
10702140	10705140	Also a tweet from Tiger Koa saying,
10705140	10709140	Games destigmatize violence, says a Connecticut governor.
10709140	10711140	Well, that's probably all that needs to be said about that.
10711140	10714140	Another politician putting their big ass foot in the conversation.
10716140	10719140	Lastly here, Raw Steel UT.
10719140	10724140	In light of how the media readily brought Manti Teo's dead girlfriend story,
10724140	10727140	have any of you been fooled by fake stories?
10727140	10729140	Oh, I'm sure we have here on OLR.
10729140	10733140	I mean, it happens. There'll be an article that spreads like wildfire.
10733140	10736140	We don't like to think we're breaking the news.
10736140	10740140	Once in a while we get a little tip, but we try not to make a big deal out of it.
10740140	10743140	Sometimes we talk about a game called Disney Infinity.
10743140	10747140	It's a hidden secret for our listeners, and that's the way we want it to be.
10747140	10753140	We learned the hard way many years ago that sometimes you don't necessarily want things to blow up out of proportion.
10753140	10756140	You don't have to be the guy that gets credited for breaking the news.
10756140	10758140	No one remembers it anyway.
10758140	10760140	Exactly. No one remembers it in this day and age anyway.
10760140	10764140	But yes, I'm sure in the history of this show we've been fooled by fake stories.
10764140	10766140	Unfortunately, none are coming to mind.
10768140	10775140	Hey, I'm sure back in the day when we were all younger, I'm sure some of us fell for the old EGM magazine pranks
10775140	10778140	like that Shang Long was actually a character in Street Fighter.
10778140	10779140	Nope.
10779140	10780140	Or Ermac was actually in Mortal Kombat.
10780140	10781140	No.
10781140	10782140	Oh, sure. Say that now.
10782140	10787140	Well, I also worked in an arcade for a while too and could actually check some of these machines myself.
10787140	10792140	So you knew at that age how to go into the chips and actually look in the programming?
10792140	10793140	Yep, I totally knew that.
10793140	10798140	No, Rob, what I knew is that usually on April 1st there are going to be pranks done.
10798140	10800140	I don't believe a damn thing on April 1st.
10800140	10801140	But they were in magazines.
10801140	10802140	Or in April Editions.
10802140	10803140	And we were younger.
10803140	10805140	But they were the April Editions.
10805140	10807140	Yeah, but Rob, I'm special.
10807140	10808140	You guys are no fun at all.
10808140	10809140	I'm special.
10810140	10814140	No fun zone, everybody. That's why nobody's calling in. They know it's a no fun zone.
10814140	10818140	All right. Last minute stories, Loki. Anything?
10818140	10825140	Blockposter UK has closed 160 of its stores because they're in administration right now.
10825140	10831140	Kind of a repeat of what they did over here in US.
10831140	10835140	There's a pretty cool THQ sale going on right now on Amazon.
10835140	10839140	You can get a bunch of games for 25 bucks. 19 games.
10839140	10845140	Most of which you probably have by now through the Humble Bundle or all the other Amazon sales that they've done.
10846140	10847140	I know I have a lot of these games.
10847140	10849140	Actually, I think I have all these games right now.
10849140	10853140	Except for Nexuiz. I don't have Nexuiz.
10853140	10855140	But I'm not buying this for that.
10855140	10858140	MX vs ATV reflex. I don't have that either.
10865140	10866140	What else?
10866140	10869140	Oh, Starbreeze. I guess they have a new game coming out called Storm.
10869140	10872140	I haven't released anything other than that.
10872140	10875140	But apparently they have an image teasing it.
10875140	10877140	I guess we'll hear more about that during E3.
10877140	10879140	Hopefully it's better than Syndicate.
10879140	10880140	If not sooner.
10884140	10885140	That is it.
10885140	10886140	That's it.
10886140	10892140	Well, I guess that's going to do it for OLR tonight.
10892140	10893140	No more calls coming in.
10893140	10894140	That's all right.
10894140	10898140	Everybody's too depressed about football. I get it. It's cool.
10898140	10900140	Oh, and the killer is dead is pretty awesome looking.
10901140	10904140	Which I mentioned about a year ago.
10904140	10908140	But it's the new Suda51 game.
10908140	10912140	And it kind of has that whole Killer7 vibe to it.
10912140	10914140	Where it's all kind of salty and stuff.
10914140	10915140	But very bloody.
10915140	10919140	I remember with some of the games that they did after Killer7.
10919140	10920140	It was kind of toned down.
10920140	10925140	They had the whole No More Heroes had money spewing out of them instead of blood.
10925140	10926140	Well, this is definitely blood.
10926140	10929140	Lots of blood and a guy with a big drill on his arm.
10930140	10932140	That sounds like my kind of game.
10932140	10933140	He's Mr. Driller now.
10933140	10935140	Mr. Driller.
10935140	10936140	All right.
10936140	10938140	Well, that brings us to a close.
10938140	10939140	Another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10939140	10943140	But not until we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10943140	10947140	First off, of course, we always like to say thank you for downloading and checking out our show.
10947140	10949140	It is a free show.
10949140	10952140	We haven't played a commercial for the same game 20 weeks in a row.
10952140	10956140	We pay a little bit out of pocket because it's our hobby.
10956140	10957140	Whatever.
10957140	10960140	And actually, I've got to say, I do want to tip my hat.
10960140	10963140	People have been very kind in a pay it forward kind of way.
10963140	10966140	We're like, you know, we've just had some nice things donated like Brad from Pod Culture.
10966140	10969140	All these mics you see are we're donated.
10969140	10974140	And we do get, you know, like Grandpa from Hoard House gave a lot of money to Vogue on our anniversary.
10974140	10976140	Helped Kristen years ago.
10976140	10977140	It helped out a big way.
10977140	10978140	The soundboard.
10978140	10980140	That's how we got to PAX.
10980140	10984140	So, you know, pay it forward is kind of the motto here.
10984140	10987140	Not to, you know, bring up a cheesy movie from years ago.
10987140	10990140	But if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, just spread the word.
10990140	10993140	Tell a friend or two about the show and help us spread the word about the show.
10993140	10994140	And that's all we ask.
10994140	10996140	Thank you to everyone who bought me games.
10996140	10998140	And thank you to everybody who listened tonight.
10998140	11000140	Whether it be live or on the podcast.
11000140	11002140	You guys rock.
11002140	11004140	Thank you, Greg Proops.
11004140	11007140	And I still have steam games to give away at some point.
11007140	11010140	Haven't figured out how to do that yet.
11010140	11012140	And also, somewhere buried over there.
11012140	11013140	I think I see it.
11013140	11016140	We still have the Megaran album to give away for something.
11016140	11018140	Yeah, we need to just do like a big closeout around here.
11018140	11021140	Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.
11021140	11023140	Jamie, you shut off the iPad.
11023140	11024140	You're good to go.
11024140	11025140	What's your final thought tonight?
11025140	11028140	It's hard to do a show on the iPad.
11028140	11030140	Loki, your final thought tonight?
11030140	11033140	I have a new CD of music to listen to.
11033140	11036140	Thanks for, was it, all the inspiration.
11036140	11043140	I guess Dubstep Arena channel on Forza Horizon.
11043140	11045140	Although, it's not really, most of it's not really Dubstep.
11045140	11048140	It's like just electronica.
11048140	11052140	My final thought for the night is why can Horde never win Isle of Conquest?
11052140	11053140	Stop being terrible, Horde.
11053140	11054140	I hate you.
11054140	11057140	Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
11057140	11059140	Thank you guys very much for tuning in and supporting the show.
11059140	11062140	We'll be back to do it all again next week.
11062140	11065140	So, have a wonderful night and a wonderful week.
11065140	11066140	Stay safe.
11096140	11097140	All still true.
11097140	11098140	See you next week.
11125140	11126140	Bye.
