14141	24884	Tonight, January 20th, 2013, the final Rainfall game is set to come to the US, Sony plans to make a big sale, and Disney Infinity is finally officially unveiled.
31758	37121	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37201	43924	It is Orange Lounge Radio with episode 490 of our show for this January the 20th of 2013.
45685	56570	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next several hours to talk about video games and the gamer lifestyle along with those of you in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and the all important co-hosts here on the show.
56710	59211	First off, say hello to Jamie Summers.
59411	60132	I'm not in the kitchen.
60632	61793	What are you doing out of the kitchen?
62973	63654	Hosting a show.
63914	64234	No, wait.
64294	64414	No.
64835	65135	Hold on.
65195	66135	Put the angry emails down.
66155	67296	This is not a sexist joke.
67336	68717	She was actually in the kitchen making coffee.
68737	69417	Making coffee.
69457	72419	Now I have chocolate mint cream ready to go in my chocolate mint coffee.
72539	72779	All right.
72819	73459	There you go.
73600	73940	Minty.
74100	74660	Minty Fresh.
75281	76381	Just like tonight's show?
76501	76801	I don't know.
77462	80724	Say hello to the always fresh Tech Master Loki.
80944	81184	Hi.
81544	83005	Remember when Fresh was a compliment?
83865	84686	Yes, I remember the 90s.
84846	89809	Like Funky Fresh or I always think of Crescent Fresh from Syphil and Ollie, which was an underrated TV show.
90464	93385	No, Syphil and Ollie, not Syphilis, DarkSakura.
93425	95346	Be quiet when you're in the kitchen.
95486	96886	I wonder how their rebirth is doing.
97286	98307	I say that because she doesn't have a mic.
98327	100528	Because I remember like, hey, Syphil and Ollie are coming back.
100548	101388	They're doing game reviews.
102388	103009	Oh, yeah.
103049	104569	I forgot after the first episode.
104589	105049	Exactly.
105069	106390	The first episode was funny, though.
107230	111251	Maybe, see, I think maybe that's the type of thing you're just going to have to marathon during a weekend.
111291	116392	Like, you know, some people marathon, what, Game of Thrones or what else?
116412	117792	What are the other big TV shows people watch?
118153	122494	True Blood, if you're Jamie, Supernatural, and only Jamie.
122914	125094	Okay, Doctor Who, that's one a lot of people marathon.
125494	128415	Once Upon a Time, my friends, which, okay.
129173	151916	Matt Cross actually we did we did actually have an anime night at my house kind of we actually we watched Matt Cross Do You Remember Love but then we watched the live-action Rurouni Kenshin movie and it was amazeballs oh yeah you invited me to come over and watch that yeah but you said no we got stuck doing something else yeah but Alan was working the Rurouni Kenshin movie was amazeballs was it yeah good times all right
152316	159221	Well, again, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network.
159281	163084	That is vognetwork.com right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
163124	165686	And if you want to participate live with our show, join us.
166207	167328	We have a live chat room.
167368	171491	So if you do happen to be tuned in live tonight, make sure you're in the chat room to get the full experience.
171711	173852	Live.vognetwork.com.
174213	177415	And it is possible to chat and multitask and do other things.
177455	178176	We don't take offense.
178616	184158	If you want to listen to the show, chat, and play, I don't know, World of Warcraft or whatever computer game, Civ 5, whatever computer game.
184178	185759	But if you're watching sports ball, I'll shoot you.
186599	187120	Stop it.
187440	188120	That's disrespectful.
188140	189041	With a rubber band.
189081	190001	That's disrespectful.
190021	190801	With a rubber band.
191502	197444	Speaking of sports ball, there was no Bobby Blackwolf tonight because there was some big sports ball games going on.
199625	200545	Ironically enough, our...
202407	204729	Dan calls them the 40 whiners
218342	219643	I don't know I hate sports ball
237850	238110	Outro Music
255697	256497	What's wrong with you?
256557	257418	Well, or gaming.
258218	259659	I want to talk about esports in a minute.
259919	261240	Acid Vampire made me cry.
261400	266382	But just to be clear, just to be clear, if I have a team, it is the Minnesota Vikings.
267122	268523	And that's because of Chris Cluey.
268543	268803	Chirp.
269743	270284	Chris Cluey.
270304	270424	Why?
270504	270644	Who?
271044	271564	Chris Cluey.
271825	275928	He is the guy that wrote, he plays World of Warcraft for one.
276148	278710	He's an NFL player that plays World of Warcraft for one, which makes him awesome.
279030	284073	And two, he's the guy that wrote that, you know, profanity-laced letter about the whole gay marriage thing.
284093	286355	And like basically say, you're an idiot if you don't support it.
286375	286956	Okay, that's cool.
287116	293680	Yeah, so, you know, I don't use this term very often, but like, he's like a bro, you know?
294461	296242	Johnny apparently is spanking off to the show.
296502	296743	What?
296763	296843	What?
298684	299004	What?
299904	304626	Says I can multitask with the show, watch Californication, laugh at jokes, bleeping off, and listen to the show.
304726	308587	He means nodding off because he doesn't want to offend us, not sodding off.
308927	309208	All right.
310288	316290	Anyhow, that little gem from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
316530	319752	What were you saying about a city vampire earlier making you cry in chat?
319792	320272	What was that about?
320292	323073	He said the firefly was overrated, so I said his butt was overrated.
324912	329076	That's okay, because Brad from PodCulture is taking care of it for me.
329236	334360	Yes, you also can get mature responses like such in our chat room from a host, nonetheless.
334720	338924	Live.VogNetwork.com Again, Jamie, you said your butt is overrated.
338984	339585	Is that what you said?
339785	341206	But I say the same thing to my husband.
343308	347051	Except I tell him, like, he'll be like, well, this song's kind of weird.
347071	348512	I was like, well, your face is kind of weird.
349953	351355	Which just earns me a look.
352307	357149	Alright, so pun intended, the kickoff topic I wanted to talk about tonight was sports.
357770	358270	Hold on.
358330	361732	Alright, don't sit there and be all like... No, I meant your pun.
362092	362532	Oh, okay.
363693	364533	I am kind of punishing.
364553	366694	I thought you were going on your tirade about football again.
366754	367935	I'm like, everybody's got their thing.
368315	368855	No, no.
369055	370716	I don't care if people like sports ball.
370736	380841	If they want the Stanley goal, you know, if they want the, I don't know, the Uber League cup, they're welcome to it.
381061	384784	Well, how often have we talked about video games ought to be a sport?
384884	386465	And that topic comes up once in a while.
386525	388667	I don't know how people truly feel about that.
388707	390648	Like I say, like we all say it, but maybe we don't.
390949	394952	Like, you know, and I think about eSports and that whole thing.
394992	397594	And it's still – eSports still feels very like –
398334	403358	I don't want to say underground because I do see it getting more and more visibility, but let's be real.
403719	408903	They don't exactly televise StarCraft matches on NBC Primetime or whatever.
409284	417511	We're not really at that level yet, but thanks to the internet, and the internet is in many ways killing traditional broadcast mechanisms, right?
418051	425718	I mean, ratings for once powerhouse TV shows like American Idol are way down, and I think we have the internet to thank for a lot of that because...
426598	429279	You know, people watch their Netflix or people watch the things that they want to see.
429299	432601	And some people prefer to watch these esports things.
432621	439443	And we've seen, you know, the online streaming solutions like Ustream, Justin TV, or excuse me, it's Twitch TV or whatever.
439784	443365	All that stuff, you know, is popular for the people who want to see it.
444665	449848	You know, you log in to a site like Twitch that actually shows you, like, this is the game that's being broadcast most of all.
450408	454209	Do you guys know what game is broadcast more than any other on Twitch TV?
454389	454950	The Puppy Bowl.
456130	456530	I wish.
458511	461533	Seriously though, do you know what video game is broadcast more than any other on Twitch TV?
462493	464054	StarCraft?
464294	464554	No.
464955	465675	World of Warcraft?
466035	468376	No, World of Warcraft is number two.
468496	470878	And usually when it's World of Warcraft, it's PvP.
470938	475260	At least in my experience, I see way more PvP arena people doing that than anything else.
475760	477803	League of Legends League of Legends
494040	518810	I didn't get far enough I played the little tutorial and then it got into picking a character and da da da and like I literally had somewhere else to be so I kind of stopped but I am gonna try I have a long weekend as do a lot of people uh this weekend from work so I'm gonna try and play a little more tomorrow because everybody always talks about League of Legends and it is free so you know why not and I also have Dota 2 so it's like those MOBA games are becoming more and more do we have any chatters that are really into that stuff
519790	533253	Just out of curiosity, live.vognetwork.com Mako in our chatroom says, Watch today's Intel Extreme Masters Finals was damn fantastic.
533773	535413	I admit to being a sad man.
535713	536774	Well, why is that sad?
537374	542055	Is that really any different than the people that all gathered around and watched the football game?
542475	544215	And I'm not calling either one sad.
544495	545855	You're into whatever you're into.
545875	546976	I'm calling all of it sad.
547856	548316	I'm kidding.
548775	551197	Yeah, and then you're going to go home and watch Supernatural.
551297	553419	No, I'm actually way behind on Supernatural, to be honest.
553439	554299	No judgment here.
554479	554940	None at all.
555600	557422	And then you'll post about it on Tumblr.
559123	560464	I did, however, finish Sherlock.
562265	566608	Acidic Vampire in our chatroom says, Sports would be more entertaining if the athletes were naked.
567629	570471	Back in the day, the Gladiator Arena was back in the day.
570651	573754	You know, I think the dangly bits are hilarious, so I'd just be busy laughing.
573794	574134	Yeah.
577202	577663	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
589901	595043	There's only two sports I can think of where it's socially acceptable to run around in a Speedo the whole time.
595504	596924	One of them involves a swimming pool.
597905	598945	The other one is wrestling.
599666	600186	Think about it.
603068	606469	Also in our chatroom at live.vog.org You can also tell which wrestlers wear cups.
609171	613713	SSJ100 Matt says League of Legends and Korean StarCraft matches are broadcasted a lot.
613753	614254	That's right.
615234	619935	I wonder what do you think it is about those types of games specifically that really draw people in?
620315	624756	Why don't you see a lot of competitive music-based games?
625136	627837	I hardly ever see a lot of competitions online about that.
627897	633738	What is it about those games that you think really draws people into esports and watching all that online?
634578	639060	Do you think it's because they're just designed to be that way?
640440	640960	Any thoughts?
641827	644189	I really honestly don't know what the appeal is.
644950	649214	I mean, truly, I don't know what the appeal is and I can't even fathom what the appeal is.
649995	651356	Well, to be fair, you haven't played it.
651576	659703	Unless it's like, you know, fantasy football type of attraction, you know, where you can see your fantasy team play or whatever.
659923	660324	I don't know.
661705	661945	Loki?
663547	663867	I don't know.
665789	667110	We don't know why people get into this.
668030	675255	Seriously, they tried to do a fantasy football league at my old job, and they asked me to been in it, and I was like, I don't know.
675555	676215	That was all I said.
676816	678097	I don't know what that is.
678557	682660	Watching the esports stuff is just more kind of... I mean, it's fun to watch people play sometimes.
682720	686542	I used to watch Arena on G4 and that sort of esports stuff.
686582	694347	I mean, I don't know how staged all that was, but it's basically two teams and a commentary, and that can be fun sometimes if it's a game you're interested in.
694907	696188	Like if they did it with Grand Theft Auto...
697489	700770	Although, you know, they'd have to show me because I'm so fucking awesome.
700830	706031	But, hey, I'll wait until five because no one plays it anymore.
707611	709072	What about competitive Minecraft?
709372	710892	Although I guess that's not really a thing.
710952	711392	It could be.
711552	712332	It is a thing.
712452	712693	Is it?
713213	714013	No, it can be a thing.
715513	720014	Well, competitive Minecraft they have, usually it's different game modes like the people set up.
720454	723235	For example, I've watched videos of...
724576	737751	people just creating their own kind of games like one of which okay everybody we're gonna throw you outside of this house and the first person to was it the last person to survive is the winner or something like that.
737971	738712	Like Minecraft
738752	739292	Battle Royale
758924	779405	they actually do play the Hunger Games like that where they all start off and it's basically everybody free for all and there's chests where they find stuff to help them survive for the record I'm not talking about that iPhone game that was like a platformer or shooter based on you know what I'm talking about strategize, find the weapons find your opponents, that whole type of thing
779716	793016	Also, Marvel totally bit off Battle Royale specifically now because now there's like an Avengers Battle Royale comic where they've taken like little bit characters from all over the Marvel Universe and make them basically kill each other off until there's one left.
793457	795139	And the cover is totally a rip off the movie.
795900	819397	well Battle Royale kind of gained a lot of popularity again thanks to the Hunger Games I mean and you know obviously a lot of people saw the similarities and so forth um but I heard at one point the CW was kicking around a Battle Royale show it's gone it they they they are not moving forward with it that would that would definitely I would totally watch it they said hold on guys it was nothing more than like an idea we kicked around but still wouldn't
819717	824158	Yeah, we can't put that out now that there's kids dying, you know, in the news.
824378	826879	I think it would make a great TV show as a drama.
826979	835522	I mean... I'm really surprised nobody's tried to pitch a, like, a literal Hunger Games reality show.
836022	836802	Obviously no death.
836822	837422	With paintball?
837602	840823	Yeah, like paintballs or, you know, non-lethal types of things.
840924	841884	Like, you know, silly things.
841904	842684	Severe beatings.
844024	844325	Nerf.
844665	845645	The Nerf Hunger Games.
845665	845765	Yes.
847133	847854	They have laser tag jackets.
847874	848496	I would watch that.
848596	849577	The Nerfing Games.
850178	850719	There you go.
850840	851661	I'd even watch that.
851922	853044	You know what they need to bring back?
853865	854446	Laser tag.
854686	854947	Yes!
856430	857531	Except not the bad cartoon.
857572	858353	Was that a TV show?
858553	860517	Yeah, there was a bad laser tag cartoon.
861406	865769	I love Adventure Time There's a big difference between that and Funhaus
892164	894049	Tiger Claw says they should do a survivor for kids.
894851	895453	They did.
896235	897117	It was called...
899980	900501	Lord of the Flies
924400	926720	I'm hoping somebody in chat will remember the name of that show.
926760	928661	I need a reality TV nerd.
928681	930301	If Shane's listening, he might remember.
930701	931781	He'll know what show I'm talking about.
931801	934002	I don't even remember what network it was on.
934442	938563	SSJ100Matt says, American Gladiators was the closest we had to that type of thing.
938883	940583	You know, what happened with that reboot?
941263	947065	I was so excited because American Gladiators was such badass TV back when we were growing up.
947245	950265	It was so just brain gone.
950465	950985	It doesn't matter.
951065	951645	It was watching...
954534	959756	For the love of God, it was, can you have a game show without all the reality bullshit tied to it?
959836	960997	I mean, that's everything nowadays.
961077	964218	It's like trying to get in the head of the contestant and like, let's find out about their life.
964278	965319	I don't fucking care about their life.
965379	966699	I want to see them play a game.
967019	967339	And that's it.
967560	972001	All I need to know about them is their name is Bob and they're from Detroit or something like that.
972041	972382	That's it.
972462	973662	And they're a firefighter.
973942	974423	Whatever.
974783	976223	And they were in the military.
976243	977044	You know, that type of thing.
977064	977724	That's all we need to know.
978447	980589	Yeah, I think it just didn't work in prime time.
980689	983131	American Gladiators came back as a prime time show.
983411	987655	And it's just like, no, this is the type of thing that's meant to be Saturday at 4 o'clock.
987715	988836	I've already found the best show.
989057	992460	What they need to do is take reality TV and just give it all to Canada because Canada does it right.
993781	994561	Canada does it right.
994581	996183	I am addicted to Canada's Worst Drivers.
998281	1003385	Okay, Shane is asking, is it the CBS one that had the kids living in the town, Kid Nation?
1003565	1010470	No, I forgot about that one, but that one got a lot of shit because it was like really psychologically damaging to those kids.
1010770	1011611	There was another one.
1012211	1012972	It was on cable.
1013908	1014689	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1038112	1058944	I played Minecraft last night for four hours Wow, what the turnaround Jamie's made Remember when you used to sit here on the show and say Minecraft's stupid I didn't say it was stupid I just said I wouldn't play it until someone paid for me to And now that someone paid for me to then I'm playing it But I was busy working on my underground lair Which apparently Loki hasn't found yet
1059910	1061251	I haven't really been playing, though.
1061271	1065032	I've been trying to do things that involve my brain.
1066273	1069574	Let's say Minecraft doesn't, but I don't really know what I want to do with it right now.
1071055	1077778	I've been trying to do other things, but then my brain gets too tired, so I play dumb games like Skyrim with a ton of mods on it.
1078158	1079399	It's really unstable now, too.
1080031	1085213	Well, I was just doing other stuff, so that's why I was playing Minecraft while I was doing other things.
1085313	1091175	But it's just sort of nice to sit back and have something mindless to sort of work on that's a little creative.
1092076	1095677	And trying not to hit those guys that explode, I hate them.
1095937	1097498	Because most of my houses are made out of glass.
1098218	1099559	Well, my roofs are made out of glass.
1100719	1105701	I've got this whole network of underground tunnels built, and I seriously have a mole village.
1105801	1107462	People can come live in my mole village if they want to.
1108162	1109183	I finally put a bed in my house.
1110243	1112144	Can you play whack-a-mole in your mole village?
1112184	1112324	No.
1113644	1115545	And I did play a little WoW.
1115865	1117386	I'm trying to get back into WoW.
1118186	1124288	I played some Mass Effect 3, but that's just because I was playing around with more of the mods and I think I'm close to getting Flycam working.
1124428	1128830	Are you going to get into the whole... The name slipped my mind.
1129170	1131211	When they make the movies out of video games.
1131231	1131611	Machinima.
1131751	1132491	Thank you, Machinima.
1132511	1133852	Are you going to get into the whole Machinima thing?
1134032	1136233	No, but on my Mass Effecting Tumblr.
1137673	1140014	That's why I asked, because you're mass-affecting Tumblr.
1140074	1141294	You're making still pictures.
1141334	1142495	That's kind of like getting your big toe in the door.
1142515	1143875	I'm doing lol effect, is what it's called.
1144195	1144755	Lol effect.
1144835	1145495	Is that like a thing?
1145636	1146876	It's not just you, it's a bunch of other people?
1147096	1149036	Other people have done it, but now I'm making it a thing.
1149136	1150317	What if it's not very funny, though?
1150897	1152938	A lot of people think it is, so I've got 103 followers now.
1152958	1153038	Wow.
1155338	1157300	How come we can't get that many people listening to the show?
1157840	1159762	Does this show need lol effect?
1159822	1160723	It needs more mass effect.
1160763	1161763	Tell a mass effect joke.
1162784	1163124	Kaden.
1165586	1166067	Get out.
1167968	1172051	But I've also started doing this other thing that I call Shepard and Tumblr.
1173132	1177556	I've done three versions now where one of them is like Shepard looking at Tumblr on a data pad.
1177936	1182119	And I've exploded it now to where Shepard was looking at pictures of cats on Google.
1182519	1184601	And then I have another one where Shepard's looking at Grumpy Cat.
1186588	1187409	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1216096	1217917	That's pretty much Tumblr in a nutshell.
1218718	1219778	So that's what I've been doing.
1219918	1221099	Oh, that and politics, but whatever.
1222019	1223680	SSU100, Matt, you disappoint me.
1224901	1228603	You need to finish Mass Effect 3 and do it with the extended cut.
1230004	1236247	So I've also been doing that and trying to get back into limbo, but I've just really been busy.
1236287	1238348	I start school this week and my class is all online.
1238488	1241590	But hey, if anyone wants me to design them a website, I can do it for school credits.
1243743	1247984	Alright, so J-Links remembered the show I was trying to think of.
1248244	1251785	Endurance was the name of Survivor for kids.
1252565	1259586	It was on NBC and then moved to Discovery Kids and it had the kids all split up into teams and it was just, you know, they did all these challenges.
1259606	1261487	Who could survive the longest before their bedtime?
1262947	1263627	Moving on.
1264407	1267348	I just had to put that to rest, that discussion from earlier.
1268683	1269824	All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1289304	1292085	It was okay.
1292185	1296127	I'm not a huge fan of the MOGA controller, like the first one they put out.
1296687	1300988	Their new one that they showed at CES, the one that's full size, I think it'll be a little bit better.
1301909	1305470	Because, once again, it's kind of like the Vita controls.
1305710	1313093	Vita, it's cool that they have dual analog sticks and stuff, but it's just not the same as a console controller.
1313133	1315414	It's a little bit cramped, I guess.
1315774	1317596	But it worked alright, and it was kind of fun.
1318336	1319777	Until my wife said, what the hell are you doing?
1319797	1323761	Because we went over to her parents' house, and she's like, well, you should bring something to do.
1324361	1324862	I'm like, okay.
1325042	1328324	So I brought something to do, and of course she did not, even though she asked me to.
1330226	1334029	So I brought that, and she's like, is that a controller for your phone?
1334870	1336972	Are you addicted to games or something?
1336992	1341395	She's like, you have that so that it's easier to play games on your phone?
1341856	1344438	I'm like, yeah, because I got it for free.
1347798	1349880	And yes, it is easier to play games like that on my phone.
1351762	1352182	It's not bad.
1352422	1353403	It's pretty cool.
1354084	1360389	If I want to play a game like that, it's a hell of a lot better than virtual sticks and stuff on the actual screen.
1361390	1362091	It worked out pretty cool.
1365033	1365514	What else did I play?
1366471	1370355	Oh yeah, more Skyrim on Steam with all my mods in there.
1370456	1379526	Although, I'm going to start having to scale back on some of those mods because I'm running into crashing problems where it'll just dump me for no apparent reason.
1379546	1386474	Like, I can't build a forge at my house in Hearthfire because...
1388470	1390512	I don't know, it just will crash for no reason.
1390632	1393334	I'm not really sure why, but it's only when I build a forge.
1394135	1396997	And just some other weird stuff.
1397017	1401901	Like there's one I have, it's called Midas Magic, which adds a bunch of different magic spells that they created for the game.
1402562	1411249	The problem is they have this thing that you put items in to craft these spells in the Riverwood Trader.
1411929	1416913	And when it creates a spell, the spell book is marked as steel.
1417814	1434365	and so you can't get the book without like pissing everybody off and so like the first spell I got I'm like okay I'm going to turn invisible I'm gonna sneak and be invisible and I'm gonna grab the spell really quick use the spell and then maybe they won't notice anything
1434785	1436646	Nope, they all tried to murder me instead.
1437006	1440147	Which, I mean, it's just a minor inconvenience because none of them can actually kill me.
1440187	1444269	But I just don't want to have to kill them because that would be terrible.
1444489	1447991	You know, all these quests I'll miss because I'd have to go kill all of them.
1450251	1455314	Then other games I played, I played one of the other games I backed on Kickstarter.
1455774	1458735	The, was it the Gianna Sisters?
1459355	1460836	Oh yeah, how is that?
1461176	1463517	I have that from the Steam sale still waiting to be played.
1464292	1464892	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1480240	1483744	and then a new game I played on consoles this week, Forza Horizon.
1484465	1485906	I actually got into that a bit.
1486527	1489710	Welcome to the cult of Forza Horizon.
1489770	1490591	Congratulations.
1490671	1493334	Yeah, so I played that a bit and it's fun.
1494455	1500562	First order of business is I drove on all the roads so I can get that achievement and I hit all the signs so now I get free upgrades.
1501102	1502904	Did you look online to see where all the signs were?
1503864	1507067	I was driving all the roads.
1507087	1507907	I haven't even done that yet.
1507927	1509969	There was a couple that I couldn't find right away.
1510089	1514612	And then I was like, okay, looking at the map and kind of, okay, there's probably something right here.
1514652	1516674	I mean, it's pretty obvious where they're hiding some of them.
1517154	1519396	What did you think of the whole introduction and the setup though?
1519416	1523559	Did you have the same reaction I did where it's like, these rich, spoiled brats?
1524981	1525681	That was my reaction.
1525701	1528382	Not even that, but there are some things that are annoying me about it.
1528442	1536746	It's like, I'll still get radio chatter where it's like, hey, did you see that such and such person has those signs out there?
1536786	1541327	And if you hit them, you'll get this guy like, I fucking know because I hit all of them already, you stupid bitch.
1541828	1543948	I don't need you telling me this over and over again.
1544208	1547130	Or like, you know... I think it's just randomized, Loki.
1547350	1550451	Yeah, I understand, but they should shut that off if you've hit all the signs.
1550631	1553212	Or if, you know, you hit a couple of signs, you should...
1553786	1554466	Thanks for watching!
1578155	1579857	Like, and then the radio net is hilarious.
1579917	1583820	Like, he's all, dude, they have an event where you race a hot air balloon.
1584321	1589885	I'm sorry, but if I heard of, like, this event I could go to to watch a car race a hot air balloon, that would be fucking boring.
1590226	1592027	Because hot air balloons are not fast.
1592087	1592868	It's a fun race.
1593128	1593869	Have you done the race yet?
1594129	1598553	Yes, I did the race, but hot air balloons are not known for their speed, okay?
1598793	1599874	It's a hot air balloon.
1599894	1602056	Despite your snark, how do you really feel about the game?
1602076	1602557	It's alright.
1602757	1603558	It's an okay game.
1603598	1606561	It's like kind of Burnout Paradise Lite, I guess.
1607463	1608344	That's pretty much it.
1609185	1610146	You need to play some online.
1610767	1611107	It's fun.
1612108	1612649	I'm sure it is.
1612689	1615272	One of these nights, we're going to fill up a race with all VOG people.
1615312	1616173	That's going to be interesting.
1617014	1618316	And I'll probably still get last place.
1618516	1630239	Well, I had to go into multiplayer to do some of the speed trap things because fucking caravan, like always being from goddamn minivan, just like there.
1630539	1634460	Like I'm flying over the hill like 160 miles an hour.
1634780	1636200	Goddamn minivan right there.
1636520	1637401	Like every time.
1637981	1642262	There's just like some stupid like Volkswagen Beetle or something.
1642282	1642722	It's just like...
1643522	1668472	boom wait you you go into the world roam mode with other people you don't do by myself racing oh well no i have been doing racing i haven't really been racing too much of the events because i did i did a lot of the challenges and i got you know money from that and i bought some cars and then i i said hey i'm gonna go beat everybody's scores on these things and so i did that uh for a lot of it and kept racing back and forth uh lamborghini
1668692	1672573	Acidic Vampire in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Racing a hot air balloon?
1672674	1673094	The hell?
1673414	1673834	Yep.
1674354	1675254	You race airplanes, too.
1675475	1678936	Airplanes and apparently a helicopter, according to the radio, but I haven't done that yet.
1679416	1680256	Airplanes thing, man.
1681177	1684138	Some of that stuff pisses me off because those cars handle like crap.
1685458	1686959	Or like, I don't know.
1687879	1690780	Hey, let's race this Lamborghini on a dirt track.
1690840	1692141	I mean, that doesn't make any sense.
1692461	1692541	Or...
1694821	1702668	or some of the ones where they're like, I want you to show off for the people and you have to do these cool, you know, you have to get like 28,000 points by driving down the street.
1702728	1704630	It's like, how the fuck do I do that?
1704930	1706692	Have you played a lot with the customization mode?
1706932	1711356	Brad from PodCulture in our chat room reminding us the creation mode in Forza is fantastic.
1711416	1712116	It is very good.
1712137	1715159	I don't know if you've played around a lot with the like, you know, decal making and all that.
1715239	1716200	Yeah, I have.
1716300	1718182	Oh yeah, you made like an Orange Nose Radio card, didn't you?
1718422	1719063	N7 cars all over the place.
1719083	1719383	That's easy.
1743644	1745585	Someone made a tally card, but it wasn't very good.
1745945	1754588	Instead of just writing out Orange Lounge Radio, I actually pulled out my old business card, which is completely useless now since the phone number and websites are all incorrect.
1754868	1760010	But I actually recreated the logo that was on there using just boxes.
1760509	1760869	Very cool.
1761650	1762751	Alright, anything else for your gaming week?
1766715	1768757	Call of Duty, I'm sure I played a little bit of that in Borderlands.
1768797	1776325	I think we restarted Borderlands on true Vault Hunter mode, and we're kind of back up to where we were before when we first started playing co-op, but
1777199	1784225	I was kind of pissed off at that because I tried, you know, we were trying to go back into the game and do all the side missions in the original difficulty.
1784805	1787468	And it's like, hey, you've unlocked this true Vault Hunter mode.
1787488	1788328	Do you want to do that now?
1788348	1789289	I'm like, yeah, sure, whatever.
1789349	1792632	Let's bump up the difficulty and, you know, we can go back there.
1792652	1796275	And it's like, well, if you decide you can change it later on in these settings or whatever.
1796295	1797176	I'm like, okay.
1798517	1800098	Can't find the settings anywhere for that.
1800338	1802440	And now that I'm in true Vault Hunter mode, my game restarted.
1803809	1809452	Except I have all my weapons and I'm still level 50, but it's still annoying.
1809512	1812053	I was like, god damn, I was going to do all these side missions.
1812193	1813914	Now I just have to do them in this.
1815175	1815755	Now, I guess.
1816035	1817036	It'll be a little bit harder.
1818390	1820312	So I haven't downloaded any of the DLC and I probably won't.
1821152	1825936	Maybe, you know, because my friend's playing with me and I don't want to buy two copies of those.
1827337	1827878	All right, is that it?
1828378	1828658	That's it.
1829399	1830039	My Gaming Week.
1830940	1832041	Not a whole lot of new stuff.
1832081	1833302	In fact, revisiting old stuff.
1833602	1835544	As far as new stuff goes, there's some iOS games.
1836384	1837705	Final Fantasy All the Bravest.
1837986	1839887	A lot of you guys have been reading about this on the internet.
1839907	1840788	It's kind of controversial.
1841248	1846893	I don't want to spoil my thoughts too much because I actually wrote them down for a VOG article that I'm going to post tomorrow after all the podcasts go up.
1847614	1848435	with some other articles.
1848455	1849756	There's some content going up next week.
1849777	1850618	Promises, promises.
1851018	1851379	Yeah, I know.
1852260	1854463	But yeah, Final Fantasy All the Bravest.
1856405	1857006	Interesting.
1857126	1858888	That's all I'm going to say for now.
1859389	1859870	Stay tuned.
1860450	1862193	But I will talk a little more in depth about Temple Run 2.
1863414	1866695	sequel to Temple Run, which has inspired a lot of knockoffs and so forth.
1867075	1871196	Temple Run 2 looks gorgeous on my iPad 3 Retina, I gotta say, for a free game.
1872236	1874897	Temple Run's a really great time killer.
1875437	1880478	And it's funny because this game gets compared to Pitfall and back and forth when the two games are kind of ripping each other off.
1880818	1889040	I would say Pitfall, and I'm talking about the iOS remake of Pitfall, or reimagining of Pitfall, let's be real, not the classic, classic Atari game.
1889620	1890341	Thanks for watching!
1913337	1916480	Otherwise, as far as PC and consoles go, not a lot of new stuff.
1916660	1923205	I have Assassin's Creed 3 from the rental company ready to play, but I didn't get around to it this weekend, so I'm going to check that out during the week this week.
1924846	1928389	And I did play World of Warcraft, of course.
1929290	1932373	Had an epic Civilization V match again on Saturday night.
1932893	1935315	This time it was myself and...
1936856	1938297	Four other people were playing.
1938317	1943118	So it was five of us playing Civ V. And we started, I think, around 8 o'clock.
1943338	1946479	I went to bed at 3.30, and we weren't even close to being done.
1947039	1947659	So, yeah.
1947980	1949820	No VOG people, unfortunately, this time.
1949860	1952481	I know we've been talking about, like, Bobby and I have been trying to play for a while.
1952901	1953662	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1975504	2000986	whatever have fun all right um other games i've played this week um i went back kicking it old school on my 3ds playing a ds game i've been playing pokemon pearl because ever since that x and y trailer came out i'm like that looks really good like finally they've got the pokemon games looking like the cartoon series like it took them long enough
2001446	2025059	so I've kind of decided to go back and look at the older games in an effort to collect Pokemon to transfer to X and Y at some point so you know why not so I've got very far but I have about three four hours logged on Pokemon Pearl no particular reason I picked that one that just happens to be the one that I had in my collection from like years ago so and I never really got very far in it so I'm rediscovering it all over again there you go
2027300	2033665	so yeah, WoW Civ, Pokemon I guess that's really about it nothing else to share for now

2064153	2065134	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2082389	2085993	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2100510	2109220	It's called PressPaws.org, but it's Press P-A-W-S, like doggy paws and kitty paws.
2110481	2118450	I thought this was great, because obviously, Orange Lounge Radio, we've had a lot of loved pets pass away this past year, unfortunately.
2118470	2119351	It's very tragic.
2119731	2121472	So what better time to bring up something like this?
2121813	2125875	The website PressPaws.org, Saving Animals with Art and Video Games.
2125895	2132400	And they're actually doing this whole little gallery, February 9th, at Gallery Nucleus, which I believe is in the Chicago area?
2132720	2135141	So it's not really here.
2135382	2136963	Actually, now I'm curious where this is at.
2137783	2142226	I think the Twitter person was in the Chicago area, so I didn't see this.
2142266	2143047	Let me see real quick.
2144915	2146636	Sorry guys, I literally just brought it up.
2146696	2147756	Oh no, this is in the LA area.
2147796	2148136	My bad.
2148476	2149717	This is in Alhambra.
2151198	2151918	So that's really cool.
2151958	2153158	It's in the LA area.
2154119	2160221	And yeah, I think they hit their goal already of $3,000 to raise the money and everything.
2160261	2161922	But yeah, check out the website.
2163002	2163423	It's cute.
2164143	2167504	Look at all the doggies with the question mark blocks and the goombas and wearing the Luigi hats.
2167524	2168505	They need to be more kitties.
2170385	2171085	There's another doggy.
2171105	2173306	There really aren't a lot of kitties here, are there?
2173766	2174166	There's one.
2174186	2175366	There's a kitty.
2176887	2177167	Yeah.
2177747	2179767	Definitely don't know your target audience on the internet.
2182168	2184028	Well, I thought it was cute and worth a shout out, so there you go.
2184048	2184668	It is cute.
2184788	2185188	Very good.
2185308	2187009	And Tiger Claw reposted it in the chat room.
2187349	2187809	Thank you.
2189189	2192650	I wanted to mention something, too, real quick about my gaming week that I forgot to mention.
2193290	2194090	Forza Horizon.
2194470	2198151	Love, love, love that Horizon Base Arena station on there.
2198965	2200850	Oh yeah, yeah, they've got some good music in the game.
2200870	2207364	Yeah, a lot of them, you know, a lot of them actually songs I listen to already in the car, but make a new CD for my car.
2207785	2207926	Yeah.
2209281	2214044	Although, I have to say, what the fuck is Blue Monday by New Order doing on that goddamn station?
2214124	2215264	It makes no fucking sense.
2215385	2216145	Why the fuck not?
2216565	2220487	Because it's not a base song.
2220507	2221588	New Order belongs everywhere.
2221628	2228352	If it was the New Order remix that was in Blade or something, yes, that would totally fit with that station.
2228432	2232594	But New Order, that would be perfect on the Rock station or something like that.
2232614	2233795	Maybe your base just isn't high enough.
2234495	2236597	It doesn't have a lot of bass in it.
2236737	2238518	It's Blue Monday.
2238538	2239259	I mean, come on.
2242081	2245883	At least it's not that horrible remake that was done a couple... It was probably about 10 years ago.
2246544	2249085	Yeah, and those guys were assholes and said, well, our version's better.
2250386	2250787	In hell.
2251947	2253268	In nowhere.
2254629	2256070	Alright, let's move on.
2256190	2261494	Let's get into gaming news and talk about what's been going on in the video game world this week with you guys commenting and participating live.
2261674	2262655	Live.vognetwork.com
2263055	2267497	If you are listening to the podcast, you can always email us, mailbag at orangeandreda.com or tweet us or what have you.
2267857	2268577	Let's get into the news.
2268657	2268917	Loki.
2269317	2269698	All right.
2270038	2272919	So let's talk a little bit about Nintendo.
2273079	2278901	And it's kind of interesting that they decided to go ahead and merge their handheld and console divisions.
2279261	2305215	which I hope that this means that we're going to see a lot more kind of stuff that we used to have with even like the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance and stuff like that where you see a lot of synergy between the console versions and the portables like you know tying into each other like hey you can unlock crap from the console version if you plug in your system or whatever maybe we see something like that with the 3DS and you know the Wii U or something like that some sort of cross connectivity with some games or something
2305575	2306376	That'd be pretty awesome.
2307136	2311198	Or, you know, better console games, I guess, on handhelds.
2311338	2315481	Or, I don't know, maybe because the Wii U is almost like a 3DS anyway.
2315501	2316701	It's just tied to a TV.
2316721	2323165	Yeah, I was going to say, I thought this was going to go more along your joke about how the Wii U is just basically a DS without hinges.
2323325	2324005	It pretty much is.
2325786	2326927	Although we should add hinges.
2326987	2328668	We should just, like, hinge it to the TV.
2329388	2330649	Clamp the gamepad to the TV.
2330669	2331510	There you go, done.
2331530	2332090	Yeah.
2334648	2341977	You know, actually, if you, well, I was going to see if there was a way to get like an external monitor or something like that.
2342018	2347144	They should make that an external monitor that clips to your gamepad that makes it like a 3DS.
2347204	2350929	It's like, okay, I got the screen up here and yeah, I'm kind of fine.
2351365	2354848	Well, let me read this next story because the two kind of go hand in hand, maybe.
2354888	2357511	I want to talk about if the two go hand in hand or what it can mean.
2357951	2361134	And it's a report going around about the Wii U game sales.
2361754	2365718	Apparently, the game sales are actually lagging behind the Wii and the GameCube.
2366018	2367079	Please note the keyword there.
2367119	2368801	It is the game sales.
2369881	2376045	Analyst Doug Kreutz of Cohen & Company is interpreting the software sales.
2376585	2385071	Totals for the November to December period were 43% lower than software sales for the Wii and 50% lower than those for the GameCube.
2385851	2386091	Ouch.
2387532	2388072	But then again...
2389173	2414121	you know the Wii U I don't I mean even though a lot of people are like Wii U's got the biggest launch lineup ever and it's got all these games I mean the reality is a lot of those games were already played by people a long time ago and I don't think they were as exciting and especially alongside the Wii lineup the original Wii you know you had a lot of a lot more like everybody had to have Zelda and I think on the Wii U you get a lot of people that have to have Mario but I think people don't feel like they need
2414281	2414642	and much more.
2434461	2438782	Slightly earlier or at the same time, I mean, it's not a lot of really exclusive new stuff.
2439482	2444624	And one of the big new exclusive games, Nintendo Land, was included with the console that most people bought anyways.
2444664	2447964	Yeah, but Wii Sports was included with the Wii, which was an even bigger deal.
2449125	2455586	But that's true, it was, but this is also being sold alongside of it as well.
2455626	2457046	I mean, that's got to hurt the sales.
2457087	2461788	In fact, every Wii came with Wii Sports, so there was no double skew.
2461808	2463048	Well, in the beginning anyway.
2463348	2463948	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2484356	2487357	I don't think that's as big of a factor as people are making it out to be.
2488257	2492319	I personally have a real hard time plunking down $50 for a game with nothing tangible.
2492759	2496560	It's different when it's like $10, $15, $20 is about as high as I go.
2496720	2500141	Perfect example, Earth Defense Force 2017 Portable, Sigil only.
2500221	2504502	I was kind of staring at the screen because I booted up my Vita this week and I was like, you know...
2510644	2512166	I was looking and I'm like, do I really want to spend?
2512266	2514008	No, I'm not buying this for $40.
2514089	2516652	That is too fucking expensive for a digital download.
2517112	2517393	Sorry.
2517913	2518814	I forgot.
2518874	2523180	I totally forgot to talk about Wake Up Club, but I'll get to that in part B. But see, I spent more than a cost.
2523500	2524521	Well, Dan did anyway.
2524581	2526464	More than the cost of a Wii on my graphics card.
2527925	2534149	and I can get games that play better, look better, and I can mod to hell and back.
2534349	2539052	Oh, you're going to be one of those people that are like PC gaming above all else.
2539172	2543895	To be honest, I think PC gaming these days is really beating out the consoles.
2544576	2550099	I think that now people are starting to realize that you're getting a bit more of your money's worth out of PC gaming.
2551020	2551280	I mean...
2551880	2578455	except it's not yes and no some games just don't run as smooth as they do on consoles because a lot of games are optimized for the consoles you know because again PCs all have that varying equipment which can make a difference but you know consoles everybody's got the same thing so a lot of times you know what works on the console doesn't necessarily work on PC I'm not I mean look at my gaming week I play World of Warcraft and Civ 5 I'm not knocking PC gaming by any means but I think there's room at the table for both
2578780	2592428	I just think at this point given the limitations with the Wii U software base and honestly that you're not getting anything really new out of it except for that little controller that my money was better spent on my graphics card.
2593659	2601245	Ross Steel UT in chat says, considering how low the Wii U storage is, I doubt that, talking about the downloads, 32 gigs isn't a lot of space.
2601285	2602306	Yeah, that's an issue too.
2602786	2605068	I mean, granted, you can add your own drive to the system.
2605228	2606829	You know, they were touting that.
2607210	2609972	It's too early to really see the impact of that, I think.
2610652	2618959	You know, maybe when there's more desirable stuff, you know, we talked about how the Wii U eShop is very indie friendly, and we anticipate there's going to be a lot of good stuff that comes in throughout the year.
2619820	2623243	I think it's still too early to gauge if a lot of people are actually doing that or not.
2624765	2630189	Now, RossDLUT in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com actually follows up with another good comment I wanted to read here.
2631130	2654930	Rostio UT actually left PC gaming because of the DRM and I got to admit a lot of the PC games are shooting themselves in the foot when it comes to DRM not that consoles necessarily do a lot better but like you know the SimCity shit like EA's upcoming SimCity game I'm sorry I am totally turned off to that game and it's because of the DRM Diablo 3 pissed a lot of people off
2655830	2658092	I think people are finally starting to say, you know what?
2658372	2662094	I think we've hit our limit with how tied we have to be to the internet.
2662715	2666377	How much information we have to transmit from our computer on a regular basis just to play a stupid game.
2666397	2668038	But it's to play with everybody else.
2668118	2670160	I mean, it's totally not because of the DRM.
2670260	2672061	It's to play with everybody else, right?
2672681	2676483	But people wanted to cheat in SimCity Who didn't cheat in SimCity?
2676683	2682025	Everybody cheats in SimCity So why would you design your game to be online all the time so you can't cheat?
2682646	2683166	Hello?
2683786	2701274	However, Mass Effect 3 Just for example, they wanted it online and they update the game whenever they want to Still hackable, still cheatable Well, thankfully the single player multiplayer But they will nail your ass if you cheat in the multiplayer But I'm also not an asshole and won't cheat in multiplayer So, just saying
2702881	2705363	Maybe other people are assholes and like to cheat in multiplayer.
2705923	2710287	Ranma in our chatroom says there are ways around DRM and for SimCity I will do just that.
2710487	2714069	That is exactly what's going to happen and I can't believe EA doesn't realize it.
2715951	2719193	Somebody in a boardroom needs to get over their ego because just wait.
2719493	2724657	Before the game comes out somebody will have hacked that DRM and will have an offline, playable, downloadable SimCity.
2725078	2725318	Wait.
2726318	2727760	That is exactly what will happen.
2727980	2730442	There's already hacks for just about any game out there.
2730482	2732143	There's ways to play it without the disc.
2732483	2739751	which I'm actually starting to do with Mass Effect 2 so that I can run text mod I mean just saying because mine is a Amazon download
2741239	2762934	I haven't said the G word alright so anyway the point I wanted to get to was going back a story you were talking about the console division getting merged with the hardware division could the Wii U's I don't want to say underwhelming performance but non-overwhelming performance be contributing to this probably
2763815	2777266	I'd imagine it would be because they need to kind of figure out how they're going to recapture the magic in the kind of serious rush for product that the Wii had, I guess.
2777466	2779388	I don't really remember too much about the Wii launch.
2779428	2781410	I just know that the consoles were really hard to get.
2781970	2783312	I can tell you right now they're not hard to get.
2783572	2789137	In fact, we're getting our consoles this early already and not like a year later like with the Wii.
2789837	2791558	That's because they're sitting on shelves.
2791838	2793059	They are sitting on shelves.
2793119	2793819	Stacks of them?
2794199	2794439	Yes.
2794779	2797620	It's not flying off the shelves, and that's got to have them worried.
2798541	2802943	I mean, they don't want to have another 3DS debacle.
2803763	2805744	Yeah, but the 3DS is in a much better place now.
2806525	2808407	It is now, but what does that take?
2808447	2810548	They have to drop the price and put out a lot more games.
2811149	2819535	If they have to drop the price of the Wii U within the first year, that's going to look like double failure on their part.
2820036	2826521	I don't know anybody that doesn't think the problem with the Wii U right now is the lack of exclusive games, basically.
2826901	2829002	I mean, yes, there's an awesome Mario game.
2829142	2830743	Yes, Nintendo Land's pretty good.
2831163	2834745	You know, but there's not enough of that.
2834805	2837787	I mean, the 3DS had the exact same problem in the beginning.
2837987	2839228	Exact same problem with the 3DS.
2839628	2842429	You had a decent launch lineup, but nothing sustained it.
2842990	2847552	You know, and now we're getting in this position with the Wii U again, which I know you'll get into in a minute when we talk about the releases.
2847612	2853415	But, you know, it's going to be until next Christmas when we start getting the stuff people really want to get.
2854235	2854916	That's the reality.
2855716	2861881	Well, we don't even know what they have planned beyond... Well, I guess, I mean... They'll announce it all at E3.
2861921	2865043	Second quarter is going to be pretty much stuff that's held over from first quarter.
2865063	2867064	Nintendo doesn't announce holiday ahead at E3.
2867745	2868585	They never really have.
2868805	2869566	I mean, think about it.
2869646	2872768	Most of the big heavy hitters are always announced at E3.
2873649	2875490	Other companies don't tend to do that as much.
2875530	2879773	You might find out about stuff a little earlier, but Nintendo really kind of keeps it until E3.
2882358	2884699	especially with the new Xbox coming out this holiday.
2884719	2885720	They're going to have to do something.
2885880	2888701	They're going to have to really do something.
2889602	2893263	Maybe the console's being merged so that the console people can work on a Wii U game.
2893283	2893683	Who knows?
2894104	2894944	Push this button.
2896145	2898246	Look, hey, there's a 3DS hidden inside there.
2899086	2899987	Bet you didn't know about that.
2902728	2907569	Maybe, maybe your whole little theory about the 3DS will soon become another Wii U gamepad.
2907609	2908729	Maybe that will come to light.
2908769	2909149	Who knows?
2909889	2919771	Although I don't think the technology is capable in those 3DSs, but maybe there will be a 3DS XL XL that will do it.
2919791	2921252	40 or whatever, yeah.
2921452	2922252	That will do it.
2922472	2922892	Who knows?
2924332	2925352	That's an interesting question.
2925372	2928873	Do you think the merging of the divisions means something for the next handheld?
2930998	2931979	I guess anything's possible.
2933141	2934583	Alright, let's move on with more gaming news.
2934623	2935204	DarkSakura.
2936326	2937387	Stupid iPad.
2939710	2939951	Okay.
2940547	2946491	So, well, we know that Sony has been losing money left and right, hand over fist.
2947131	2949412	Well, they would like to make money hand over fist, but they've been losing it.
2949973	2955836	So now they're actually selling their New York City headquarters for $1.1 billion.
2956837	2957918	Sony Corp of America.
2960879	2966043	They're going to be selling it off to the Chetrick Group, and it's supposed to close in March.
2966963	2978487	Now, keep in mind that the company, it cost them, what was it, $770 million in debt.
2978527	2979847	So they're up to right now.
2981028	2987950	So selling off this money is going to be a big, selling off the building, sorry, is going to be a huge recoup in lost income.
2988910	2993832	However, I'm not sure exactly what it costs to maintain the building.
2994932	3008899	But they have a lot of money to make up So you take a building I know land taxes in New York are horrible They're crazy I used to do property taxes Well we all know New York City is an expensive place to live It's no secret And so the buildings there are worth a lot of money
3009626	3017835	I don't see anything about a relocation of business, getting a cheaper building, a place that's going to cost less money to maintain.
3018596	3020498	For all we know, they could move to Montana.
3021679	3023000	Can you imagine Sony in Montana?
3023921	3024101	But...
3025808	3031392	They are going to be allowed to remain in the building for up to three years with the lease back arrangement.
3032353	3034295	So it's not like they're moving now.
3035215	3037617	It's that they're letting the building go.
3037838	3039759	Pretty much they're giving the building back to the bank.
3040019	3042381	We haven't heard anything about jobs affected or anything.
3042581	3046604	Also, I think it should be mentioned, Sony does more than PlayStation, let's not forget.
3046765	3048206	There is a lot at Sony.
3048986	3063172	you know not even just TVs they have a whole motion picture division and music and I'm sure I doubt very little PlayStation happens in Sony you know we a lot of that has run out of the Bay Area we know that well in Japan for one and in the Bay Area for the U.S.
3064271	3070993	The video games division for Sony is really, I think, it's decent but relatively small potatoes compared to the rest of what they do.
3071153	3072034	Sure, sure.
3073314	3074654	But I'm not surprised to see it go.
3074814	3080156	I mean, that's way too much expense and it's not even that interesting looking of a building.
3081337	3082197	But it's in New York City.
3082237	3082857	It's a big building.
3083117	3084317	There's a lot of stuff in New York City.
3084358	3085118	It doesn't make it cool.
3085838	3088879	It will be interesting to see who snatches it up.
3091314	3091554	What?
3091995	3092215	Okay.
3092416	3093017	Valid question.
3093738	3098405	Probably some corporation with tons of money and corrupt practices to screw us over with.
3098425	3099186	Bank of America.
3099467	3100869	God fuck Bank of America.
3101423	3102323	Moving on, Loki.
3103404	3117927	Alright, so as we were talking about a little bit earlier, lots of games supposed to be coming out this first quarter for the Wii U. Although a lot of them, unfortunately, are just kind of like ports and stuff, but there's some good stuff.
3118207	3121068	So let's talk a little bit about some things coming out.
3121668	3132175	Need for Speed Most Wanted finally coming out to the Wii U in March on the 19th in the US or North America and in Europe on the 21st.
3132596	3133736	Nothing really special about that.
3133796	3137579	I don't even really know how they're supposed to, I guess, off-screen play mode.
3138259	3144744	So they're going to have that and then you can use it to select your cars and keeps track of your records or something like that.
3145584	3150708	Also bundled, I guess, with the Ultimate Speed Pack which is some piece of DLC because that seems to be kind of the trend there.
3151668	3158335	One of the games that was supposed to be highly anticipated for the first quarter, Aliens Colonial Marines, now doesn't really have a firm date.
3158375	3163040	It's not going to be launching on the 12th with the actual game on the other consoles.
3163881	3165062	Instead now it's just kind of...
3166618	3189620	TBA you know so hopefully that doesn't mean delayed past March because that would be you know it's another big mature rated game for the console the amazing Spider-Man Ultimate Edition you know getting a port of a game that came out back in June fantastic and of course with DLC thrown in there as well
3190982	3192023	That's coming out in March.
3192483	3202993	And then two games that were expected the first quarter, the Game & Wario and Wonderful 101, which, let's be honest here, two first-party games, those aren't really that exciting.
3203273	3208278	I mean, I know Game & Wario, they didn't really show a whole ton of that.
3208959	3210260	And then the Wonderful 101, sort of like Pikmin...
3212782	3227574	now those are beginning to release date as far as the first half of 2013 so I will be willing to bet that that's probably going to be after first quarter I think Wonderful 101 has its anticipators I think you might be selling it short a little bit there it's not going to sell that well
3228903	3229743	It's too niche.
3229863	3230604	I'm sorry.
3231464	3236386	I think only because maybe the Wii U hasn't gotten out there as much as possible.
3236406	3237026	It doesn't matter.
3237347	3239828	The genre, I think it's going to be too niche.
3240028	3243589	It's a niche appeal to that.
3244129	3244970	That's what's going to happen.
3245050	3247311	And of course, nothing even mentioned yet.
3247731	3253153	I think Wii Fit U is also supposed to be first half of 2013 as well.
3253233	3254354	So April, May, June.
3254394	3254774	There you go.
3254914	3257135	You got your three titles there.
3258475	3263156	One title is confirmed, though, for first quarter, and that's going to be LEGO City Undercover.
3263476	3267817	That's actually launching on the Wii U in March, on the 3DS in April.
3268637	3271198	Pretty much the only game that I was actually looking forward to at all.
3272658	3273158	So there's that.
3273238	3278399	And then for the 3DS, there's going to be Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon, which is coming on the 24th of March.
3278419	3278459	So...
3281980	3284901	I want to say, well, of course, Fire Emblem in February.
3284941	3292303	I want to say, though, that they haven't really announced any other 3DS titles other than Smash Bros., but that's just kind of like, hey, we're working on a Smash Bros.
3292343	3292584	game.
3293644	3298145	But they haven't really announced anything else for second quarter, first party, I think.
3298886	3304227	Oh, Brain Age Concentration Training, I think that's also February.
3304527	3306088	Pokemon XY, but that's the end of the year.
3307640	3312939	There's a Pokemon Mystery Dungeon game that's coming out at the end of March as well.
3314574	3315915	Pokemon X, Y Pokemon X, Y
3339073	3339774	A really big thing.
3339814	3345158	Unless, you know, there are really no racing games aside from Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing.
3345238	3348700	So, that might be kind of good if you're into that.
3350987	3380239	but yeah it's a lot of ports so that's the only thing that has me worried I mean LEGO City Undercover could drive some console sales because that's a pretty cool looking game but it's not there's no games that really scream oh my god I have to get a Wii U now well the Need for Speed thing I don't think this is coming up on our show or else I might be duplicating something I hope not but I remember reading something about the whole that the Wii U version of Need for Speed will let you do the co-op where you both drive and want to use on the gamepad and want to use on the TV and I gotta admit that's pretty rad
3381399	3388225	They're able to install that fully functional two-player using the Wii U. That is something you're not going to see on the other systems.
3389466	3391647	For what it's worth, I think that's a neat feature.
3392088	3393188	Give that to them, I guess.
3396171	3399973	Once again, though, it's not like, oh my god, that's really going to sell it for me.
3400074	3400414	It's just...
3401872	3402572	I don't know.
3402652	3407074	It's sad that, you know, LEGO City, let's not sell LEGO City undercover, you know, that short.
3407094	3408995	I mean, it's a pretty awesome looking game.
3409575	3411996	But I just, I don't know.
3412517	3414938	I don't know if it's really going to be enough.
3416478	3416779	All right.
3417179	3418359	Well, moving on to another story.
3418419	3421501	This is not about a Wii U release, but a Wii release.
3421921	3423942	Like, you know, basic Wii.
3424502	3429004	Which, you know, obviously a lot of people still own the Nintendo Wii, and it's not like your Wii U can't play Wii games.
3429574	3456366	by the way I also transferred all my data from the Wii to the Wii U this week it was pretty painless so now I can play my virtual console games with the HDMI collection woohoo but I really wish sorry I'll get to this story eventually I need to rant though I really wish because this pisses me off that virtual console is too stupid for this why doesn't the system know to automatically side letterbox or put into the right aspect ratio the virtual console games
3457046	3458987	Why does it still force them to widescreen?
3459568	3461289	Why can't it know to script?
3461549	3464872	Because I can set it on my TV, sure, but that's such a pain in the ass.
3465372	3472057	Why can't when I boot up Zelda, which is a 4.3 game, like Zelda was not in widescreen on the NES, why can't it just know, oh, flip the resolution back to 4.3?
3475131	3476012	Outro Outro Outro Outro
3498650	3499451	It won't be happening.
3499471	3501093	Are we absolutely sure of that?
3501113	3502674	Because I bet it's going to happen.
3503955	3506238	Look at the virtual console games I have on 3DS.
3506478	3510281	I have not bought anything that wasn't free or not available.
3510742	3511723	I have a couple Game Boy games.
3512163	3513244	Those weren't available before.
3514025	3514365	That's it.
3514966	3516768	And maybe I have maybe two Game Boy games.
3518405	3527733	I'm just saying, I bet you they're going to do that kind of crap, because they try to pull that shit with... Are they still releasing those 3DS games, the retro ones that are in 3D now?
3528794	3530255	They kind of say, yeah, fuck it.
3530395	3533377	There's non-3D ones, all the Mega Man games, that was a big deal, remember?
3533437	3536980	Yeah, I understand that, but are they doing those, remember how they're Excitebike and stuff like that?
3537000	3538301	I don't think there's been one in a while.
3538742	3539402	There were a few.
3539903	3542605	They're like, eh, fuck it, no one's buying them, you know?
3542935	3549110	It was like Xevious and Urban Champion and all these interesting ones but I haven't seen one in a little while.
3551376	3551657	Anyhow.
3553052	3555834	Yeah, I thought we were going to get like Zelda in 3D and stuff.
3556394	3556835	I guess not.
3556855	3557475	I guess it was too hard.
3557575	3559497	Anyway, back to what I was originally going to talk about.
3559637	3567122	A Wii game coming out on the Wii U. XSEED has decided to bring over Pandora's Tower to the Wii.
3567202	3572006	Now, this is important because this was the last Operation Rainfall.
3572066	3572586	You guys remember that?
3572606	3578210	That was the last of the three Op Rainfall games that Nintendo was never going to bring over here.
3578370	3581833	And then they finally brought out Xenoblade Chronicles, although it had that
3582533	3584235	Yeah, Exceed or Ignition or Axis game localization.
3603163	3603704	So here they go.
3603724	3605545	They're stepping up and putting out Pandora's Tower.
3605825	3611991	Now it's going to be interesting to see how this does when the Wii U is what's really being pushed right now.
3612151	3621860	But a lot of folks thought that Last Story, when it got price cuts $20, made a great pickup game for people to get with the Wii U. Because again, why not?
3621880	3623221	You can use the backwards compatibility.
3623341	3623802	Very easy.
3625303	3626924	Any interest in Pandora's Tower, Loki?
3628346	3628526	No.
3628546	3628586	No.
3630334	3631395	I don't play anything on my Wii.
3631875	3632595	Actually, it's funny.
3632635	3636236	We booted up the Wii because Nelly was going to play some more Animal Crossing.
3636516	3642577	So I charged our controllers and... Animal Crossing.
3642977	3643617	Sorry, I'm eating.
3644197	3645478	Animal Crossing is on 3DS.
3645598	3646378	That's a game coming out.
3647098	3647738	But it's not dated.
3648738	3649418	It's out in Japan.
3650319	3651239	That's a fourth quarter game.
3651259	3653719	That's going to be sad that it's gotten that delayed.
3654140	3655000	I don't think it can be.
3655280	3656260	It's got to be sooner than that.
3657162	3684670	probably yeah it could be a May game we'll see but I mean seriously though we forgot all about it because it was that you know highly anticipated that we completely forgot about the game I don't know what's it called Animal Crossing Jump Out or something like that Animal Crossing Jump Out no it's like Animal Crossing it's the same fucking game on 3DS I don't know
3685006	3690544	Occupy Nooks I wish, that would be great Alright, moving on, more news
3691437	3696360	Well, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.
3696640	3698721	Now, you know that you play as Raiden in that, right?
3699522	3706706	Well, that's not what Kojima originally wanted, but he did let go of the story writing so that he could focus on production.
3707206	3714471	He wanted it to be Gray Fox, who, as we all know from Metal Gear Solid, and he was a character that's...
3715371	3724858	A lot of crap happened to him, and a very, very crazy story if you'd followed the MSX Metal Gear games and really were a fan of the series.
3725759	3731183	But he said, no, we're going to let the kids play, and they want Raiden, and they want Hack and Slash, so let's go with Raiden.
3732819	3736060	It would have been so awesome to have a game with Gray Fox, don't you think?
3736961	3739082	Instead he gets stepped on by Metal Gear.
3740382	3741103	Sad trombone.
3743164	3750207	You know, it's funny, I actually forgot to mention, I played Anarchy Reigns during my game week this week, and it was very subpar.
3750787	3751127	Really?
3751327	3754629	Which saddened me because I love Platinum games, and...
3755769	3757990	It was just... It was a mess.
3758171	3759631	It's just not set up well at all.
3759932	3761192	I mean, there's no story, which is fine.
3761212	3766716	I find no story being in there, but it was confusing on what the hell you had to do, and the gameplay was just kind of like, eh.
3767816	3769537	It was like, Mad World was so much better.
3770038	3774960	Why is, you know, Jack having to do this crap?
3775361	3776802	Jack's for the play in HD, though.
3776842	3778663	It was fun to play as that character, but it's just...
3779683	3780903	I just didn't know what the fuck was going on.
3781023	3783664	But I hope that that's not the case with Metal Gear Rising.
3784604	3786545	But I think Metal Gear Rising looks pretty awesome.
3786965	3792166	Well, also there was a comment regarding the trailer that might be Metal Gear Solid V, The Phantom Pain.
3792426	3793186	Oh yeah, that thing.
3793566	3796567	Yeah, Kojima said that he really liked the trailer and the lighting was very good.
3800548	3806469	Metal Gear Rising Revengeance is going to be out on February 22nd, so keep your eyes open if you are interested.
3807799	3811762	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out very soon.
3812782	3813783	It's not much this week.
3814083	3820207	It's pretty much just Ni No Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch on PS3 this week.
3820687	3821468	Which is not bad.
3821488	3824390	I mean, it's supposed to be a pretty awesome PlayStation 3 game.
3824410	3825330	Yeah, I want to check that out.
3826511	3829072	I don't know about the $60 though.
3829193	3831714	I think I might rent it or wait for credit.
3831734	3833215	The reviews have said it's been worth it.
3833435	3833595	Really?
3833615	3835997	They said it's basically... What was the...
3836617	3841959	The only other thing that's coming out this week is a Sims 3 expansion pack 70s, 80s, and 90s stuff Do people still play Sims 3?
3865703	3873057	they still have a ton of fucking expansions coming out for the thing so I don't understand why and also apparently apparently that's it
3874127	3877410	Alright, going to Japan, Hitman Absolution on the Xbox 360.
3877450	3883516	Yes, this is the Japanese version, making its way out on January 24th, as well as a game called Instant Brain, but that's a price reduction.
3883556	3884517	That was already out before.
3884757	3887800	That is going into Cave, the best series, because that is a cave game.
3888621	3889762	Those are the Xbox 360.
3889802	3892585	Going to the PlayStation 3, things are a little bit bigger over there.
3893045	3896369	Nobunaga Yoyabu Online 10th Anniversary Box.
3897009	3898070	No Paradox, God Something
3920923	3923684	Uh, I'm trying to see, let's see if this is a game that we know over here.
3924525	3926926	Oh, hold on, we wouldn't know that from the limited edition art.
3926986	3928527	Let me look at regular edition.
3929967	3931688	I'm trying to see if this is a game I recognize at all.
3932529	3933849	I don't recognize it with the box art.
3934910	3937571	Oh, it looks like a Disgaea Tactics-y type of game.
3937591	3938711	Yeah, it's a Tactics game.
3939972	3941173	I bet it's based on anime or something.
3941193	3941393	With mates.
3941413	3942213	Some of you chat will know.
3942873	3943434	Well, of course.
3943934	3944174	Yeah.
3945891	3947312	Somebody in chat, I bet, knows more about that.
3948012	3948473	Mag.
3948793	3949413	Remember Mag?
3949974	3951074	Is also getting a price reduction.
3951094	3952315	Goes into PlayStation 3 the best.
3952335	3954176	Again, those are Japanese releases.
3954737	3956098	Looking at the handhelds really quick.
3956238	3959280	On the PlayStation Vita, pretty busy week, actually.
3959400	3967525	Demon Gaze, Genkai Totsuki Monster Monpiece, as well as Sakuraso no Pet no Kanojo.
3968726	3970267	I'm assuming that's a Pet Sim game.
3970647	3971888	All on the Vita.
3971908	3972608	I don't know.
3972628	3973489	It talks about little girls.
3974470	3976451	On the Wii U, nothing.
3976671	3979514	No more Wii U games until January 31st is the next one.
3980315	3983637	On the Nintendo 3DS, however, ooh, also nothing.
3984378	3985519	Nothing really on the 3DS.
3985979	3991264	Nintendo has very little activity over there until February 7th is the Dragon Quest VII remake.
3991304	3996568	I'm sure a lot of people will be very excited about that on the 3DS, which I can imagine they won't bring that over here.
3996929	3998070	Nintendo's having a nap.
3999251	3999811	Maybe a little bit.
4000752	4001152	So there you go.
4001172	4002113	Those are your Japanese releases.
4002845	4004285	We only have two things for the UK.
4004346	4006346	On the 24th, we have Strike Suit Zero.
4006426	4007827	And the 25th, Devil May Cry.
4009287	4009607	Ah, yes.
4009647	4010307	Devil May Cry.
4011188	4012008	That came out this week.
4012448	4012688	Yeah.
4012788	4013428	I want to check it out.
4013468	4013668	I do.
4014389	4014669	All right.
4015289	4016789	A couple more news stories for you guys.
4016809	4018890	And then the classic game of the week.
4019090	4020210	But first, Loki.
4020691	4021091	All right.
4021631	4023351	So let's talk about Majesco.
4023571	4028753	Now, Majesco is, I would say, not long for this world anymore.
4029433	4031214	And they've, you know...
4032034	4033535	Definitely had some problems.
4033635	4041902	The company experienced a loss of $2.7 million as compared to, I guess, the $3.9 million loss the previous year.
4042862	4053671	And they said the revenues are up to $132.3 million, but concluded with a net income of $4.6 million down $2 million from last year.
4054331	4058614	And let's be honest here, Majesco, they don't have a lot of games that they're releasing.
4058634	4060476	Cookie Mama is not selling like it used to.
4062517	4064518	Their last say need investing mama, right?
4064638	4065719	Was that the joke you made on Twitter?
4068681	4069261	I don't remember.
4070021	4071202	But, I mean, come on.
4071222	4075805	This is the company that decided that, hey, NBA Baller Beats is a good idea.
4076805	4077506	You know, so...
4078587	4088676	Really, I mean, looking forward to what they have, they've only really got... They have the Young Justice license, so they've got that game coming out at the end of February.
4089357	4094301	But, I mean, Majesco's not one of those companies that puts out these really huge AAA games anymore.
4094602	4095402	They just don't.
4097144	4103070	So it is kind of risky for them, because if these kind of non-AAA titles don't sell well, then...
4104151	4104931	Kind of sucks for them.
4105231	4109874	I mean, maybe Zumba's not selling as well as it used to because I know they have Zumba.
4109914	4111515	That's their kind of big license right now.
4114077	4115398	But I don't know.
4115938	4117099	No Zumba for the Wii U, I guess.
4117179	4118680	So maybe that's what's hurting them.
4118982	4120683	So you talking about that made me look.
4120723	4123163	I'm like, how much is NBA Baller Beats right now?
4123183	4124944	$34 on Amazon.
4125024	4126405	Not going to fucking buy it.
4126525	4127985	That's the game with the basketball.
4128045	4132787	I am sitting here going... I bet I could pry that one from my boss.
4132807	4134928	He's still got it in the packaging at his work.
4134988	4136548	It's just sitting there because it's a basketball.
4136568	4137128	Bring it over.
4137188	4138529	Let's do some live gameplay stream.
4138569	4141650	Who wants to watch League of Legends when you can watch NBA Baller Beats?
4141790	4142170	Come on.
4143731	4145031	We'll get DarkSakura to play one.
4145051	4147532	We'll call it Two White Guys Play NBA Baller Beats.
4148211	4148632	I'll play.
4148992	4149753	There we go.
4149793	4151296	There are no ballers and no beats.
4152417	4156103	White men can't baller or beats.
4156403	4157445	Plenty of white guys can beat.
4158411	4160752	All in Mississippi.
4160892	4163674	Their stock closed down under $1.
4164555	4165995	They're down to 75 cents.
4166135	4170398	So hey, if you think they're going to make a comeback, maybe it's time to buy some Majesco stock.
4170558	4171638	75 cents, that's not bad.
4172779	4181004	I wish it was much easier to just go online and buy some stock because I think it would be fun to just go buy 10 shares of Majesco just to say, hey, I own part of Majesco.
4181904	4186686	And then at the next shareholder meeting, you know, we can hold whoever accountable came up with NBA Baller Beats.
4187166	4188847	Although, actually, supposedly the game is fun.
4188907	4189647	I should not get it.
4189667	4190428	I haven't really played it.
4190648	4193709	They're going to try Football 1 next.
4194329	4196830	I don't know how that would even work.
4200752	4207455	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lodge Radio on VOGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, yogurt.
4208396	4210437	Alright, one more story here.
4210477	4212899	This is about the next PlayStation controller.
4213199	4217461	You know, we had some rumors about this already, but now there's more rumors.
4217501	4217922	No, no, no.
4217982	4220723	They're just using this to illustrate the whole story.
4221043	4222464	It is not the boomerang, people.
4222604	4223225	It is not the boomerang.
4223245	4224546	It's coming back like a boomerang.
4224766	4232330	But, well, remember when the boomerang thing was for the PlayStation 3 and everybody was like, no!
4233051	4234151	That could have been comfortable.
4234211	4234651	Who knows?
4234671	4234852	I know.
4234872	4235452	I'm actually like,
4236949	4238650	It seems like such a history thing to say.
4238670	4239530	It looks so ridiculous.
4239550	4240631	The boomerang wasn't so bad, you know.
4241091	4243392	It looks so ridiculous, but maybe it was comfortable.
4243432	4244272	I mean, we don't know.
4244392	4246213	It doesn't look like it would be very comfortable to me.
4246393	4246893	Well, whatever.
4247013	4247433	It's gone.
4247694	4253176	Okay, so we've heard about this move thing that might actually be like a transformer into the controller, right?
4255817	4258099	But that's not what the latest rumors are.
4258179	4267506	Apparently, according to a senior game studio in a conversation with CVG, Sony is going to mix up the DualShock design.
4267967	4272750	There's going to be biometric sensors on the grips and an LCD touchscreen.
4272770	4275853	Because, you know, that's what everything's got to have now is a freaking touchscreen.
4276994	4282218	Apparently, they are trying to emulate the same user interface philosophies as the PlayStation Vita.
4283661	4286447	Look, I like the Vita and all, okay?
4286487	4291237	The touchscreen's cool, the two analog sticks are cool, but the rear touchpad, let it go.
4291958	4293521	Stop trying to make rear touchpad happen.
4293962	4294183	Stop.
4295868	4300253	Don't you understand that reaching around is like, you know, has some bad connotations to that?
4300333	4305579	I mean, it's just... Even in DJ Max, which I think... I know some people who really like reaching around.
4306300	4310465	Even in DJ Max, which I think does it better than most of the Vita games, like, I'm just like, turn it off.
4310685	4311166	Turn it off.
4311686	4312107	Turn it off.
4313989	4314249	Anyhow.
4316856	4328601	I thought for a second there, instead of leading up to, oh yeah, we're mimicking the control interface of the Vita, it was going to be, we're mimicking the control interface of the Wii U. Because that's basically...
4329537	4330438	Thanks for watching!
4348892	4361299	Now, let's not say this would be a pretty awesome thing if they decide, hey, the next-gen console, it is going to be the Wii U. It's going to be the Vita that they throw into the box.
4361419	4362259	It comes with a Vita.
4362739	4364920	You've got a Vita, and you've got the PlayStation 4.
4365000	4365201	Boom!
4366281	4366721	Right there.
4367062	4372285	Portable, and you've got your console, and you can take your controller when you go.
4372325	4381932	I mean, because, don't get me wrong, I bet it would be pretty awesome if you could take that Wii U game tablet and stream games from a Wi-Fi spot somewhere else in the world.
4381952	4385754	Which you can kind of already do with the PlayStation 3 and the PSP, for God's sake.
4385814	4388096	Yeah, so wouldn't it be kind of awesome if you could do that?
4388396	4392399	Or if you could play virtual console games on there, you could take that.
4392419	4393900	I mean, it's a little bit big, but come on.
4393960	4394940	PS1 classics?
4395200	4396041	And PS2 classics?
4396641	4401503	I'm talking about the Wii U. I'm just saying, wouldn't it be awesome if you could do that with the Wii U controller?
4401663	4407046	It's pretty big, but people carry tablets around, so why not?
4407106	4413889	Regardless of whether this current rumor is fact or crap or whatever, how do you feel about them redesigning the DualShock?
4414957	4439331	for all practical purposes at the point we're at now throwing out the six axis and everything you know the PlayStation 3 controller you get now is a very tiny evolution from the original PlayStation controller I mean really I mean granted okay I guess the analog sticks came a little later the very very first PlayStation controllers didn't have them but still the core of that controller has not changed that much since the beginning
4439591	4440252	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4452819	4453719	I think it's going to be a gimmick.
4454540	4456141	Biometric sensors are on there.
4457581	4458522	Yeah, it is a gimmick.
4458682	4462964	But it's a gimmick that also a lot of cell phone games and a lot of stuff uses.
4463424	4465265	Yeah, no one really uses 6Xs anymore.
4465525	4475490	But even like... It seems like a lot of the stuff that Sony's been doing lately has just been to kind of mimic... Because even with the Wii, everybody got into motion gaming right after the Wii.
4475970	4479532	Oh yeah, we've been working on the Move controller since a long time ago.
4479552	4479672	Yeah.
4480672	4505298	come on it just it never took off and now you know some of these patents that we see look really ridiculous i mean no one's gonna fucking strap move controllers to your feet and do like a flip kick in your goddamn living room no one's gonna do that um so they need to come up with a new they need to come up with something new then you come out with the wow factor because if you're fucking emulating someone else or doing the same shit you're doing now no one's gonna care no one's gonna be like why do i have to buy this i can already fucking do that now
4505795	4508677	That's really what it comes down to is the wow factor.
4508837	4510037	That's what's going to sell your console.
4510558	4510838	All right.
4511418	4514260	Let's travel back in time to a time when, you know what?
4514780	4517481	The controller, it was a stick and a button, and you liked it.
4517561	4518022	That's it.
4518282	4519222	One stick, one button.
4519502	4520763	Hey, we have more buttons for this one.
4520863	4521183	All right.
4521243	4523004	Maybe this game isn't quite that old.
4524045	4530848	But it's still a classic, so let's dive into the gaming vault where DarkSakura is going to pick out an oldie moldie video game and say, Hey...
4531969	4533730	Play it, because it's cool.
4533970	4535070	You probably forgot about it.
4535130	4537731	It is a cool one, and probably not many people have seen it.
4538932	4543954	The classic game in Japan was called Zexex.
4544134	4546495	I think I'm pronouncing it right, because it's X-E-X-E-X.
4547575	4548935	Over here we had it as Oreus.
4549676	4555357	It came out in 1991, a side-scrolling shooting game, and it was actually really unique for its time.
4556497	4560758	Konami was really influenced by a lot of stuff that Irem put out.
4560938	4569260	It actually has influences from R-Type, which everyone knows R-Type is among one of my favorite games, and the tentacle mechanics that came from X-Multiply.
4570669	4581359	It did not at all get a home release until it came out with Salamander Portable that came out on the PSP, which somebody in this room enabled me to get that game for my husband.
4581399	4582080	Thank you, Loki.
4584903	4587825	Actually, it's really, really an amazing shooter.
4588686	4594011	It had some really interesting mechanics.
4596073	4599975	What happened with this one, like I said, it's similar to R-Type and X-Multiply.
4600015	4604417	You play a ship called the Flintlock that has this detachable orb called a Flint.
4605258	4607639	And it acts sort of like R-Type's force.
4609500	4617324	So you can get power-ups to boost Flint's power, your movement, you're changing your weapon, increase your life count.
4618125	4622267	But there are a bunch of changes that came out, though, in the non-Japanese versions.
4622807	4623568	Some of them being...
4624028	4627950	They removed all but one of the upgradeable weapons and they changed the enemy patterns.
4629110	4634833	For different weapons, in the US, there was only the proton laser.
4636493	4649839	In the Japanese version, you start with a proton laser and then you get a homing laser, a shadow laser, a round laser, a spiral laser, which is a lot like the Gradius Ripple, a search laser that's kind of like a homing laser, and a ground laser.
4650939	4656943	It's very similar to the fire one that would travel across the floor from R-Type.
4658264	4666750	And so basically the story of the game, you have to save the princess named Irene from the planet East Square from an evil dude named Klaus.
4667210	4670412	And there's different cutscenes and she's crying for help and she's tortured.
4671213	4675976	And so you have to basically go through the game.
4676096	4678958	And there's naked people in the ending of the game, just saying.
4680739	4681980	Listen up, acidic vampire.
4683662	4692789	But the big thing about Zexix that I thought was really amazing, and Rob, you can see this right in front of you, is the level design.
4693409	4697673	I mean, for 1991, the backgrounds look like shit right out of Tron.
4697833	4698794	I mean, seriously.
4699394	4704918	You've got very... Well, I like the little tentacle shots the thing does.
4704938	4705159	Yeah.
4705279	4706720	Like, it shoots out all these little tentacles.
4706940	4709202	I actually had never really heard of this game, so...
4709662	4714646	Zexix is a really... I definitely see the Gradius inspiredness in it.
4715067	4720752	But a lot of the use of the flint is definitely like using the force in R-Type.
4722753	4725235	The game is actually pretty challenging.
4725756	4727117	It's a really difficult game.
4727477	4733242	And I thankfully got to play a copy a while back off of the Supergun.
4734783	4737805	Um, so, this was ages ago.
4737945	4743688	I mean, this is actually a game that I don't know if it's, um, if they've gotten it to work on MAME yet.
4743828	4749471	I'd have to check because Zexex is like, it's seriously one of the classics when it comes to shooters.
4749532	4751713	It's not a bullet hell, definitely, by any means.
4752433	4759836	But it requires a lot of steady movement, a lot of really good reflex to make your way through it.
4760316	4762037	And it's just an amazing game.
4762537	4771321	So I would say, unfortunately, the only way to get a hold of it for any type of home version is getting the PSP version.
4771561	4775463	It's again under the Salamander Portable.
4776503	4796068	and it's also you can find this really inexpensive for PSP it didn't cost a lot I think when I bought it new it was like 30 bucks and that's you know an import and of course there's no region lockout on the PSP so the chatters are saying it is in Maine if you want to if you want to turn to the dark side of the internet where everybody's at
4796877	4799338	Well, I haven't touched anything on name and ages.
4799378	4801400	Dan and I are probably going to be making a new cab soon.
4801540	4810925	But seriously, if anyone loves shooting games, and especially if you're a fan of Konami shooters and love Irem shooters, you really owe it to yourself to play this one.
4810945	4812126	Zexix is a great game.
4814188	4843122	and that's it alright there it is your classic game of the week over here it was called Oreus if you happen to find an arcade cab of it take a picture of it for me please alright we are going to come back after a quick break here with more of Orange Lounge Radio including a game we've talked about a bit here on Orange Lounge Radio finally official this week we're going to talk about Disney Infinity when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this
4849474	4859161	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live with the 490th episode of our program for this January the 20th of 2013.
4859381	4864345	I hope those of you guys that have an extended weekend here in the States make the most of it.
4865105	4871551	Let us not forget, though, the memory of Martin Luther King Jr., the reason why we have the weekend.
4871631	4877537	In fact, I was going to play the I Have a Dream speech during the break tonight, but it's like 18 minutes, which is a little bit long for a break.
4877897	4885283	But I encourage you all, just as a little reminder of what we've been through, take a listen to it.
4886645	4896594	Also, I wanted to talk, getting back to games a little bit, I promised at the start of Part B, because I forgot to talk about this during my gaming week, I want to talk about Wake Up Club on the PlayStation Vita.
4896614	4904402	Have you guys heard about this game, and I use that term very loosely, have you guys heard that game at all, or played that game, heard about it?
4904902	4905223	Anybody?
4905243	4905423	Anybody?
4905663	4905843	No?
4906303	4907404	No.
4907424	4908384	I downloaded it today.
4908404	4909545	Have you checked it out at all?
4909585	4909785	No.
4910065	4925533	Okay, it's this app for the PlayStation Vita, and it basically, you know, you can choose from these different skins that are alarm clocks or whatever, like a motor storm background or a journey background or whatever, and you can do the little alarm clock.
4925613	4930435	But what you do is that when you're on the clock, you tell it what time you want to get up or whatever, you put it to sleep.
4930835	4932216	And then what happens is in the morning,
4933036	4934598	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4957017	4957238	Wake up!
4957258	4957498	Wake up!
4957518	4957698	Wake up!
4974175	4981544	Taunt it all you want, but the gamification of an alarm clock is a pretty neat idea, I've got to say.
4982185	4991897	And why especially this is interesting on the Vita is that if you think about it, this gives people a reason to remember they have a Vita.
4993138	4993598	For real.
4993678	4998300	I mean, there hasn't been a whole lot on the PlayStation Vita that people have gotten that excited about.
4998640	5002701	And I'm not saying that Wake Up Club is the Vita system saver.
5002881	5005922	No, nobody's going to buy a Vita just for silly Wake Up Club.
5006622	5015245	But something that gets the PlayStation Vita into your daily routine is a really smart move on Sony's part.
5015765	5017826	I don't know if I'm giving them too much credit, but...
5018687	5021132	if they really thought that's what they were going to try to do.
5021573	5024660	But if that was what they were going for, well played.
5025943	5026263	Thoughts?
5028012	5042843	I can see how it would be interesting and definitely it's a way to keep the Vita in the... Like you said, putting it in someone's daily routine will keep it constantly in their... For example, I know it's not exactly the same, but having my iPhone, it's my alarm clock.
5043143	5046326	I keep in touch with my family through it, texting all the time.
5046666	5047527	I even use it at work now.
5047547	5048187	It's text write-off.
5048687	5048968	But...
5049568	5050369	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5072262	5073643	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5098030	5098970	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5117097	5117838	Oh my god.
5117858	5126044	And so I saw pictures on Tumblr of people like laying half in their bed with their face on the alarm clock to register the pressure and they're still asleep.
5126184	5126965	See, that would be me.
5127065	5128126	I'd learn how to do it in my sleep.
5128546	5130167	I turn off my iPhone all the time in my sleep.
5130307	5133169	I need the Vita to give me an electric shock to really wake me up.
5134590	5134871	Rob.
5135211	5135631	Oh, God.
5135952	5138234	No, no, not the sounds of my mother waking me up.
5138354	5138734	Rob.
5139114	5140356	Rob, you're going to be late for work.
5140496	5140916	Rob.
5141196	5141697	That's it.
5141757	5142397	That's what you need.
5142417	5145000	If you get fired from your job, Rob, you're going to be homeless.
5145080	5146881	Rob, you are not moving in here, Rob.
5147642	5148823	Rob, get up.
5149123	5150044	That's it.
5150524	5154048	Okay, this is a copyright Orange Jones Radio and me and Rob.
5155349	5158071	This is your mom, the alarm clock.
5159052	5160233	That's what we need to invent, Rob.
5160333	5161254	Your mom, the alarm clock.
5163069	5164609	Jamie, get out of bed!
5164629	5166590	The neighbors are going to call the police.
5166610	5167390	Sorry Rob's neighbors.
5190272	5190593	All right.
5191533	5191954	That was my mom.
5191974	5192775	That's Wake Up Club.
5192915	5194096	I just wanted to throw that out there.
5194276	5196578	It is a thing that happened this week I forgot to talk about.
5196758	5198640	Because it's a game, but it's not.
5198800	5204825	But, you know, again, Enrageinator and our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, yeah, Rob, way too much credit.
5205717	5209140	I wonder what it'd be like if I put this in it.
5209260	5209800	I can't bake.
5210040	5210601	I don't know.
5234096	5235917	All right, let's go to some rapid-fire news.
5235937	5238738	Talk about some other video game news happening around the industry right now.
5238878	5239938	I'm sorry for Rob's neighbors.
5240899	5241239	It's all right.
5241399	5241779	They'll deal.
5241899	5242139	Loki?
5242679	5242999	All right.
5243940	5248982	So let's talk a little bit about the survey that they sent out for Call of Duty.
5249542	5257165	It's kind of hinting at some stuff that may be available for the next iteration of it.
5257885	5259566	And it includes stuff saying...
5260046	5262909	Hey, what kind of special things do you want at retail?
5282048	5288391	There's collectible sets featuring character vehicles and scenery from the game, similar to the Halo Mega Bloks stuff.
5288932	5290893	Custom-branded audio soundbar.
5291253	5291473	Lame.
5292053	5294295	Custom-branded gaming headset.
5294435	5294995	Also lame.
5295275	5297556	And custom-branded wireless router.
5298937	5300338	No, just don't.
5301219	5302901	Operational Desktop Sentry Gun.
5303501	5305163	There's your winning pick right there.
5306464	5308085	And they had some other pictures from it.
5308125	5309967	Of course, they took them down because of NDA.
5310587	5317193	They're saying also that there might be a digital version to pre-download to your console, and then it'll be available to play at 12.01 a.m.
5317213	5317734	on launch day.
5319615	5328660	which is kind of cool if they did that and it says maybe that'll be something that'll be featured in next-gen consoles being able to kind of pre-download stuff like you can on Steam
5328953	5331934	You know, like Steam or World of Warcraft did that with the expansions.
5332214	5333834	Honestly, I don't know why they can't do that.
5334014	5338035	I mean, they've got day one patches, you know, and stuff.
5339035	5340035	Well, let me put it this way.
5340075	5343816	Day one patches might not be a good way to go because, let's say, for example, you do that.
5345596	5350677	Because if they did it with the console version and you weren't able to connect online, you would never be able to play your game.
5350937	5353378	But let's just say that they were able to lock that out to just...
5355659	5356039	Why not?
5356119	5363644	Why not have it built in where you can download the game and then piracy is gone as far as print late before release.
5363664	5365204	I don't know.
5365445	5366065	Sounds like a good idea.
5368566	5371128	And then there's some pretty good news here.
5371948	5372789	Skyrim.
5373509	5379153	All the wonderful DLC that you've been missing on the PS3.
5379833	5380874	It's finally coming.
5381754	5384916	Dragonborn, the latest expansion for the game.
5384936	5386877	It's going to be hitting PC on February 5th.
5388177	5395061	Also in February, all the other expansions are going to be coming out as well on PS3.
5395141	5399123	I believe they're even offering them at half cost for the first week.
5399143	5400083	Sorry it's late.
5400764	5401304	Sorry.
5402424	5403266	It's not bad.
5403386	5406231	I bought them all half off on PC.
5407834	5411521	Building the house in Hearthfire is kind of cool, I guess.
5412202	5412563	I don't know.
5412663	5414006	I don't like the Orphan Kid scene.
5415044	5416545	Hey, you can adopt me!
5416965	5419025	No, I'm not gonna adopt you.
5419245	5422166	Because if it goes anything like Fable was, I never came home.
5422206	5424227	And you can't kill the kids, because that's wrong.
5425548	5427028	And you can't even do that in Skyrim.
5427428	5429829	Although I'm sure somebody hacked it in.
5430049	5432110	I'm sure some sicko hacked it in.
5432150	5433910	Of course you can do it on the PC.
5434330	5436591	You see what PC gaming supports, DarkSakura?
5437792	5439052	I wasn't paying attention, sorry.
5439414	5440015	Killing children.
5441296	5444059	And for some reason when I loot all of the women all their clothes come off.
5444099	5445982	I don't really know why that happens.
5446002	5447083	Sickos on the PC.
5447323	5447664	I know.
5447864	5448525	It's so weird.
5449065	5451428	Also have a torture chamber with slave maidens.
5452569	5456173	I've got the PC sicko story to top all of this coming up but hold on.
5456974	5458176	I think I need to get Skyrim now.
5459637	5467845	Last but not least, La Milana and Leisure Suit Larry are some of the titles that are included on the next Steam Greenlight.
5468365	5469126	This is pretty cool.
5469166	5476473	They've got DLC Quest, which honestly wasn't a very long game, but cool.
5477214	5482479	Eidor, Masters of the Broken World, Mac, The Age of Decadence,
5483039	5489121	Yunpik, and War for the Overworld are some of the other titles that are going to be coming out.
5489961	5492442	Let's see here.
5493302	5497404	And Akaneiro Demon Hunters, which I think... Isn't that that...
5499944	5503648	Yeah, isn't that the new game that they're working on?
5504629	5505930	Was it American McGee or something?
5506570	5509673	I think that's that American McGee game, if I remember correctly.
5510174	5515478	And then also a Groboto modeling app, which is actually software.
5515559	5521944	And then the Articity Draft game design tool is another non-gaming thing that got greenlit.
5522785	5530012	So, just so you know, La Mulana, that was a game that, you know, Dark Tetsuya used to write about a lot on OrangeLawnsRadio.com.
5530052	5531073	He was very excited about it.
5531414	5536919	I actually went to Dark Tetsuya and I said, could I get a quote, sir, about how you feel about La Mulana getting the Project Greenlight?
5536939	5537860	And this is what he had to say.
5543171	5544933	That was an actual Kermit flail, by the way.
5544953	5546975	That was an actual, real deal Kermit flail.
5547535	5547956	Just so you know.
5549397	5551540	I don't know if anybody was Kermit flailing over this.
5551620	5552861	More like, da fuck?
5553962	5557646	But people are modding Alan Wake on the PC.
5557786	5559788	Of course, that's what people do to PC games.
5559828	5560329	They mod them.
5561750	5562210	But what...
5564152	5583112	I guess apparently it wasn't supposed to be moddable, it was supposed to have permissions, licenses, whatever, that ain't gonna, hackers gonna hack, hackers gonna hack, and you gotta love this, they did all 2.9 gigs, unraveled it, put it back together, and what was the community tool that they put out, what did they put out in response to you'll never hack Alan Wake?
5583752	5593894	Somebody put a Hello Kitty flashlight into Alan Wake where the little flashlight will actually always be the little Hello Kitty image when it shines on the wall.
5594614	5595695	You can see the little boat.
5595735	5598395	Let me see if in the video you get a better shot of it.
5598495	5599195	I can kind of see it.
5599215	5600115	You can kind of see it there?
5600195	5600396	See?
5600716	5600976	Yeah.
5600996	5602256	Hello Kitty flashlight.
5602996	5603496	That's awesome.
5603516	5608677	Because that's what my Alan Wake needs and I can kill the bad guys, the little shadows, with Hello Kitty.
5609998	5610898	Kill them with cuteness.
5611818	5612218	I can't.
5613467	5616949	Well, this... I don't even know what the hell to say about this.
5617390	5621232	This community could have used a little bit of cuteness, because this was just stupid.
5621532	5624374	In fact, this is one of the stupidest things I've ever seen in gaming, like, ever.
5627316	5630799	DarkSakura, did you see this fuckery?
5631739	5639305	This is the pre-order bonus for the European Australian Dead Island Riptide Zombie Bait Edition.
5639345	5639505	What?
5639625	5640606	It's a collector's edition.
5640686	5640986	Oh, whatever.
5641006	5641727	Not a pre-order bonus.
5641847	5642187	Whatever.
5642387	5643828	Severed limbs for everybody.
5643929	5644869	Collector's edition.
5644989	5660882	It is a severed torso of an apparently British female, and I'm only guessing that because she's got the little Union Jack bra thing going for her, but she is all bloodified, decapitated, armless, and limbless.
5661562	5662403	It is gross.
5662983	5664624	Who would want this in their house?
5665465	5680154	And especially kind of fucking tacky to announce this type of thing the day that Joe Biden is sitting down with the video game industry to talk about, you know, is there a correlation between blah, blah, blah.
5680495	5685998	Now, before y'all correct me, I am aware it was the Europe and Australian pre-order bonus.
5686339	5689201	So they were the ones to announce it, not the U.S.
5690121	5690762	arm of the company.
5691882	5708918	However, somebody finally figured, you know, maybe this is kind of tacky Maybe we don't really need this Maybe this is just in bad taste And so they came out and said, we sincerely regret this choice And we're committed to making sure this will never happen again
5709438	5713440	Although, what happens to the people that already pre-ordered it?
5713520	5715861	I don't know if they even say it won't happen again.
5715881	5717702	They didn't say we're going to pull this.
5717862	5718962	We're not going to sell this.
5719002	5720163	They don't mention that at all.
5720183	5722344	They're just saying we won't do this again.
5726646	5728947	Nothing said that they're going to stop doing it now.
5729007	5731168	They just said, oh, well, we're not going to do it again.
5732604	5761427	AlanAlchemy in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says it's super sexed up and gross it's for neckbeards to fap too see that's the sick thing like this is sick already but then you have to realize because it is an inanimate object somebody will stick their dick in it and that makes it like 10 times like a million times worse as if this could even get worse you realize somebody's gonna put their dick in it and it's just like this is too much that was a joke already made that just saying
5765180	5766102	Oh, but it doesn't end there.
5768625	5772471	A new game was made this week by the Encyclopedia Dramatica forums.
5772631	5772912	Oh, go figure.
5775680	5778001	called Bullet to the Head of the NRA.
5778101	5779602	Yes, that is the name of the game.
5780022	5781783	Bullet to the Head of the NRA.
5782223	5789566	It is a first-person shooter, if you want to call it that, that lets you just shoot NRA boss Wayne LaPierre.
5791827	5795949	The intent of this game was to do nothing but to just piss people off.
5797655	5798155	Ding, ding, ding.
5798195	5801897	Imagine Encyclopedia Dramatica releasing something that would just piss people off.
5802257	5807199	Quote, share this everywhere, especially gun nut and anti-game websites.
5807700	5812362	Also, see if you can't send it to the NRA somehow, like through the feedback on their website or something.
5812702	5820065	This is from forum user Gizmo01942 who also is developing a game based on the Sandy Hook shooting.
5820945	5824247	You will actually get to go to the Connecticut school and shoot kids because...
5825680	5828573	There's always gonna be that guy on the internet.
5830751	5834153	DarkSakura, you look like you're about to just... I hate people.
5834333	5835834	You're doing the SMH thing over there.
5836975	5837375	SMH?
5837896	5838496	Shake my head.
5839116	5840537	Or SMGDH.
5840577	5841698	Shake my goddamn head.
5841718	5842659	I just don't get people.
5843239	5844700	I really don't, so it's fine.
5844780	5847161	Well, here we are talking about it, so maybe the troll won.
5847281	5847722	I don't know.
5848082	5848682	Yeah, fuck them.
5848782	5849783	It's an attention grab.
5849903	5850423	Nothing more.
5851084	5855086	But you know somebody's going to get this and be all... You know who's attention is going to grab?
5855226	5855847	Fox News.
5856314	5861398	Yeah, but I like to file this stuff under the banner of no one care.
5862899	5864020	No one important.
5864600	5874848	Now, somebody did point out, this came out one day after the NRA had put out their own gun game, NRA Practice Range, which is available on the iOS.
5875368	5877410	It is rated for ages 4 and up.
5878795	5879896	Of course, that's all Target.
5879956	5880836	It's Target practice.
5881456	5882737	Target practice, so it's okay.
5883398	5884098	Here's a question.
5884378	5888260	I know this is rapid-fire news, and I'm not going very rapidly, but there's a lot to say about this stuff.
5888600	5890561	Would you let a four-year-old play point-blank?
5894283	5897925	It's a gun game, but it's carnival guns.
5898426	5906350	This is where my stance is with this, is that if I were a parent, I wouldn't let a child watch TV until they were older than five.
5907858	5910619	Good luck with that.
5910819	5911580	That was our plan.
5911760	5912380	It didn't happen.
5912460	5914540	I know plenty of parents who have been very successful with it.
5916101	5927265	I come for that just because I've seen the difference in behavior with Becky's son when he's allowed to play games and watch TV versus when he's limited access to playing games and watching TV.
5927345	5931566	He's a lot happier of a kid when he gets to go outside and play more often.
5932186	5943191	So, I don't think I would allow, if I were a parent, I wouldn't allow TV or video games until they were old enough to actually have more of a comprehension factor attached to it.
5943931	5944411	That's just me.
5945712	5947092	And I certainly wouldn't let it be a babysitter.
5949198	5950799	Let's move on to some more rapid fire news.
5950839	5952599	DarkSakura.
5953080	5956581	Well, you know how people were a little excited about Epic Mickey 2?
5956981	5966165	Well, they were only a little excited because they only sold 270,000 copies in North America, which is about, oh, a million less than the first one did.
5966785	5968506	Yeah, the first one sold 1.3 million.
5969106	5970026	Yeah, not even close.
5970646	5971087	Sorry.
5971727	5975748	And the creator thinks they're going to do more, so that would be great when Disney shuts them down.
5977049	5977149	Um,
5978709	5984571	Now there's also six weeks of free PS Mobile games.
5984671	5987132	It's going to be starting with Samurai Beatdown.
5988312	5995155	You can get that on the PlayStation Store, and it's either for Vita or PlayStation certified mobile devices.
5996155	6002017	And it's only going to be available in Japan, US, UK, Canada, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Australia.
6002437	6004178	So if you live in Zimbabwe, you're fucked.
6006340	6031207	and then for fans of Shin Megami Tensei Devil Summoner Soul Hackers is going to be out in the US in April it's been set to release on 16th of April and nothing about our friends in the UK if they're going to see anything but who knows it's also a 3DS remake of the one that came out in the Sega Saturn in 1997 done
6035359	6038961	Alright, how about we go to the Fugle question of the week?
6039021	6039601	How about we?
6039941	6040481	How about it?
6040601	6041302	How about it, huh?
6049645	6058429	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio Google Plus at Orange Lounge Radio Put them together, you get Fugle Here's our Fugle question of the week
6059113	6061215	We didn't talk about this story tonight but I guess we will now.
6061495	6066199	A settlement was reached this week between the actor that portrayed Kevin Butler and Sony.
6066639	6071883	You may recall that the actor was spotted in a commercial for a tire store playing a Nintendo Wii.
6072284	6074165	This got us thinking about commercials and marketing.
6074365	6076127	That's really all there is to say on that story.
6076447	6077988	Legal issues settled out of court.
6078048	6078689	What else is new?
6080990	6087714	But since it got us thinking about commercials and marketing and like how big of an impact does somebody like Kevin Butler really have?
6087734	6096259	So we went to Fugle and we asked the listeners, has a gaming system, game commercial or advertising campaign ever worked on you?
6096659	6099501	Where it swayed you to make the decision to buy a game new?
6100101	6105124	Was it something you experienced more in your youth or something you still find might tilt your opinion today?
6105444	6106846	I don't think that can happen now.
6123064	6123985	TigerClaw on Facebook
6141924	6146548	I've seen many commercials for the latest gaming consoles, and neither one has swayed me into buying one.
6146628	6153433	I always believe the only way to make a decision whether to buy the console or not is to actually try it, like the kiosks at the stores.
6154254	6158798	Ragenator says, as a kid in the early 80s, before I became as jaded as I am today, yeah.
6158958	6163522	But then again, commercials that were our marketing towards young kids typically work.
6164680	6166281	I wanted one of those things so badly as a kid.
6194349	6196030	You were a kid when the N-Gage came out.
6196170	6196791	I was in my 20s.
6196811	6198132	There's commercials for the Ouya?
6198952	6200993	Yeah, I didn't know there were commercials for the Ouya.
6201174	6202334	Is that maybe online?
6203775	6205456	I don't think there's commercials for the Ouya at all.
6206157	6207558	I wonder if he meant to say the Wii.
6208698	6209279	Probably.
6209859	6213502	Because people were uneducated about it and then the ads for it got a mountain of people excited?
6213602	6213902	I don't know.
6217019	6220620	DarkTetsuya said, I did go to see The Wizard when I heard Super Mario Bros.
6220881	6221821	3 was going to debut in it.
6221861	6222541	Does that count?
6223102	6226864	That was like the best product placement ever done in the history of ever.
6227124	6230906	Yeah, I have to admit that I was interested.
6230966	6236809	Who didn't get a gigantic nerd boner when they went and saw The Wizard and saw Super Mario 3 like the first footage?
6237669	6240130	There has never been a better promotion, ever.
6240750	6241690	I firmly believe that.
6241750	6246292	And the Power Glove, which, by the way, I'm sorry, the Power Glove was a piece of shit.
6246672	6247552	It really was.
6247912	6248832	It was so shitty.
6249133	6252193	That and the U-Force were both shittacular shit diversions.
6252213	6253894	I already had a Power Glove when I saw that movie.
6253914	6254794	And wasn't it shit?
6254954	6255574	Yes, it was.
6255735	6257135	It was absolute fucking shit.
6257555	6259757	But, it's so bad.
6260678	6263941	It was like, this is cool, except, wait, I can't do shit with this.
6263961	6269407	You see the U-Force in the little print ad, like, playing Punch-Out, and you think, oh my god.
6270227	6271689	Nintendo, bring back the Power Glove.
6271729	6273711	I mean, seriously, that would be fucking awesome.
6274732	6275833	If it worked right.
6277463	6280106	When they have haptic gloves, they need to have the power glove come back.
6281307	6285010	Oh, the listeners are going to hate me for this, but you know how we always say time to penis?
6285090	6287533	My concern with the power glove is time to fist.
6289655	6290235	We know.
6293298	6294099	It's so bad.
6294359	6295581	It's ripped for her pleasure.
6298123	6302224	Moving on to a comment from Burr.
6304365	6315528	Burr says, you know what, it was the Kevin Butler ads along with the price cut that came with the release of the Slim that actually did help sway my opinion on the PlayStation 3 and finally got me to pick one up.
6316349	6320970	To me, it was the moment that Sony finally meant business and let the games do the talking.
6321330	6326252	The original PlayStation 3 ads were way too obscure and stupid by contrast.
6327111	6329052	It was like when you let hipsters do commercials.
6330673	6336956	Veronica S. replied and said, The very first Pokemon commercial that aired on TV caused me to buy Pokemon Blue version.
6337096	6338197	I was 11 years old.
6338917	6342419	You know, the Pokemon cartoon was a pretty great tie-in.
6342459	6343399	And the Pokemon movie?
6344139	6344700	Good times.
6346281	6346581	Let's see.
6346641	6350302	Acidic Vampire says, Have you seen the Wii U launch commercial?
6350643	6351143	Hell no.
6353584	6354925	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6380841	6386904	DJ Janai says, kiosks and store demos are the most helpful for my buying decisions.
6387864	6392747	Steven M replied and said, the early Xbox promos for Kinect really got me excited to buy one.
6393547	6397729	DarkCharger said, in my youth, I was probably swayed by many video game commercials.
6397849	6402331	I mean, who could forget the commercial like Journey for the Atari 2600?
6403031	6406253	And he actually embedded the commercial here for us to watch.
6409961	6413583	Data Age presents the world's first rock video game, Journey Escape.
6414083	6414763	The concert's over.
6414783	6429651	Now you must help each member of Journey Escape through mobs of love-crazed groupies, shifty-eyed promoters, photographers, find your roadies and manager, and run for the escape vehicle and live to rock another day.
6432472	6435293	Journey Escape for the Atari 2600 from Data Age.
6436174	6436674	You know what?
6437614	6439235	Fuck Journey from last year.
6440496	6441816	This is the true Journey.
6443577	6446279	I regret putting Journey on my Games of the Year list.
6446339	6450281	This just reminded me that there will only be one video game named Journey.
6451302	6451902	I'm teasing.
6452602	6452942	Mostly.
6453483	6454803	Alright, anyhow.
6455724	6456805	DarkCharger went on and said,
6464929	6465189	DarkSakura.com
6483567	6485228	We need you guys to create a viral video.
6510656	6518785	and I was interested in buying Dishonored but after seeing the trailer a million times before the game launched thanks to The Escapist and PATV I decided to pass on the game.
6519506	6520147	Just do what I do.
6520207	6520968	Stop watching TV.
6521648	6523270	Well, these are web shows though.
6523290	6524471	Stop watching TV web shows.
6525112	6525673	Use Adblock.
6527674	6532157	I will admit though, a lot of online sites can only seem to ever find one sponsor.
6532417	6535539	Dan and I always pick the commercials for Hulu that talk about like food.
6537780	6544464	I like this approach that, I hope I pronounce this correctly, Shea C said, define advertising.
6544844	6549367	Were things like the Super Mario Brothers Super Show or the Sonic cartoon ads for a specific game?
6549667	6550167	Not really.
6550508	6555450	Were they media which kept the franchise visible, popular, and made us kids excited for the next game installment?
6555530	6555911	You bet.
6556471	6562753	Before the internet, gasp, TV ads, friends, and kiosks were the only way you'd actually see gameplay before getting it yourself.
6563193	6565314	Magazines had reviews, but you'd only get stills.
6565734	6567935	Now we've got trailers on demand and tons of review sites.
6567975	6571576	I feel like consumers are pulling information more than is being pushed to them.
6572017	6577418	The only thing they really need to nail with traditional advertising these days is making sure people know the title.
6577839	6578699	Interesting perspective.
6578719	6581200	We were going down that line a little bit and talking about The Wizard and stuff.
6582100	6592058	Degenerate Johnny said The only time I actually bought a console based on its advertisement alone was Tiger's Gamecom The commercial made the mobile gaming device as the shit
6592811	6598874	Yes, the little person's insulting remarks came off as insulting to the gaming community, but I recognized its satire.
6599215	6602556	Not to mention it was pretty funny seeing the little guy get tossed around at the end of the ad.
6602897	6604958	And so I'm fortunate to see that the device failed.
6605058	6606038	Oh yeah, that thing failed.
6606358	6611161	Since it had many features that were quite innovative for the late 90s, such as touchscreen controls and internet access.
6611581	6615824	It goes to show that one must be mindful of its market if it hopes to make the product a success.
6616684	6618305	And lastly, SHA100Matt says,
6640860	6645564	It was the first time I ever got a real look at the graphics and games in action so I was immediately blown away.
6646064	6648426	After that point I saved up my money and got the system at launch.
6648706	6653169	I never realized that they'd sent out videos like that.
6653189	6654010	That's kind of neat.
6655785	6660829	I wonder if they were those really cheap cardboard tape things that could really fuck up your VCR if you used it wrong.
6661609	6661929	I don't know.
6662750	6665532	Anyhow, we have not yet gone to Google+.
6665612	6666953	Let me quickly get through Google+.
6667013	6670915	Actdeft said, I would say that back in the 80s and 90s it worked.
6671296	6678060	We got smothered with over-the-top, in-your-face advertisement back then and it probably got us to buy or ask our parents to get us a video game.
6678561	6682944	But now, a lot of commercials for games are really bland and don't capture your attention that much.
6684413	6690518	Critical Myth said, I can't say there was a commercial that did that for me, but print ads have convinced me more than a couple times.
6691078	6692960	One I remember well was Xena Saga 2.
6693760	6695501	Cosmos had me at, hello.
6697823	6703347	Maiko says, as much as I want to say no, it's the quality of the games that does it for me, like it did for the Dreamcast.
6703687	6706670	I have to say yes if the Ouya counts, because I'm an idiot.
6706970	6708711	Okay, so I guess there are Ouya commercials.
6708791	6709392	What am I missing?
6709972	6712534	Are there... Because that's the second person to say there are Ouya commercials.
6713294	6714255	And I have just not seen one.
6714935	6716256	Alright, let's take a look here.
6716716	6717557	Rob's on the hunt.
6717937	6722780	Shane is adding that those videos were real VHS tapes and they were fantastic.
6727063	6727743	I'll be damned.
6727824	6729965	There is an... Oh no, that says fan-made.
6731620	6735203	I wonder if it's the Kickstarter ad these guys are referring to.
6735223	6736624	It's probably the Kickstarter video that they had.
6736644	6737405	I bet that's what it is.
6737465	6739486	It's like the modern type of ad.
6739726	6740167	Interesting.
6743209	6743569	Let's see.
6744410	6751975	E3VL says, "...advertising campaigns worked on me in my youth due to the limited social media exposure, magazines, TV, and radio.
6752376	6760402	Now with the internet involved, ads are everywhere and it's second nature to ignore them or it becomes background noise with the instant impulse hit the X or skip button when it's available."
6760922	6790134	also now that I purchase things with my own money instead of my parents I tend to do research before purchasing and ads are just a way to get me curious about coming trends instead of impulse buys or begging for the blast processing for Christmas slash birthday and lastly Techie Q says no today's ads campaigns to sway me has less effect on me now thanks to internet but it did sway me more during the Super Nintendo era of gaming those early Super Mario World and Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past commercials swayed me hard to get a Super Nintendo
6790794	6792455	Good answers tonight and good reminiscing
6812060	6815922	Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news for the week.
6815962	6818664	Thank you to everybody on Facebook and Google for answering the question.
6818784	6819044	Loki.
6819404	6826748	Alright, so we've been talking about it and I'm sure you guys have no idea what Disney Infinity is even though we've been talking about it for months now.
6827729	6829390	Probably months longer than everybody else, but...
6829830	6856621	Disney Infinity finally got announced this week and basically it's this cool combination of like toys and a little base that you put them on and games and then they have this toy box mode so basically what kind of makes it different than Skylanders is it's not just one single I mean it is they have the toy box mode where you can kind of take all these toys and build your own world out of it which is kind of cool and
6858322	6863885	But it's not some single game that you have to buy characters for to unlock all the parts of the game.
6864005	6865626	That's really the main thing.
6865686	6870869	Bobby was being funny on Twitter and saying, so is this something that I can like now?
6871810	6873411	Are you giving me permission to like this?
6873471	6875912	Because you gave everybody crap about Skylanders.
6876372	6882075	And yeah, I say it's a little bit different because each individual character and playset or whatever is its own thing.
6882315	6890378	It's not necessarily like, oh, I have to buy Captain Jack Sparrow to get to this one part of the Monsters, Inc.
6890398	6891279	world or something like that.
6891679	6892419	It's not like that at all.
6892459	6895701	Each thing is its own game, and then what kind of ties them all together is the...
6896801	6900042	Toybox mode where you can build wherever the fuck you want.
6900442	6902323	And they've got racing stuff in there.
6902343	6905144	It sounds like they're combining a little bit of the LittleBigPlanet stuff.
6905424	6913026	You can set your camera at certain spots so you can do a 2D platformer or you can make a racing game or you can just do whatever.
6913247	6915307	And you can share these all around the world.
6915407	6916748	And it sounds like they're going to have...
6917788	6919368	I think DLC you could buy for it.
6919388	6920729	They're going to have actual toys.
6920769	6923729	The toys are like $12 each for each individual character.
6924109	6931931	You can get play sets that are like $35, which are going to include a few characters and a world, as well as some different power-ups and stuff.
6933312	6935792	Talk about total fan service on a lot of stuff.
6936112	6938013	The game itself actually comes with three worlds.
6938113	6939313	It's Monsters University...
6940173	6953697	The Incredibles and Pirates of the Caribbean and they've got Captain Jack Sparrow, Mr. Incredible and Sully from Monsters U and Monsters Inc in that first playset or the first thing they're packing in there for $75.
6953958	6954678	What a surprise!
6954778	6955358	I had no idea.
6956570	6956750	Yes.
6957331	6959712	And then, let's see what else.
6960293	6963895	But yeah, they've got Tron, at least some hints of Tron in there.
6964116	6965777	And they've got other characters.
6965957	6970800	I actually, I think I posted a few things on there, like different screen grabs and stuff.
6970900	6971221	And yeah.
6972001	6975262	They've got like Phineas and Ferb is going to be something else that they have on there.
6975322	6976062	Love Phineas and Ferb.
6976482	6978243	And they've got, you know, of course.
6978263	6979023	Jack Skellington.
6979423	6980804	Yeah, Jack Skellington was in there.
6980824	6981544	Sign me up for that.
6981744	6984945	Toy Story, obviously, because that was the kind of the Toy Box moment.
6984965	6987406	Toy Story 3 is what kind of inspired them to do all this stuff.
6987546	6987806	Right.
6988226	6990507	And Cars is going to be something else.
6990827	6992567	And Wreck-It Ralph is in there.
6992748	6996909	And they even have some hints of like Sugar Rush, which would be pretty cool.
6997889	7001571	All this stuff is supposed to be coming out.
7001631	7005213	Frozen is going to have some characters with that when that movie comes out this fall.
7005714	7008155	Here's a couple problems though.
7008615	7012978	The Disney nerd in me wants to go all in on this shit.
7013338	7016960	I collect the pins, which is an expensive hobby.
7018821	7020862	Why not go to the figurines?
7021383	7022463	But here's my concern.
7022704	7024765	I'm really worried about the quality of the game.
7025425	7052272	and I'm gonna be honest whether this is a rational reason or not I'm just being I'm keeping it real I'm worried about who's developing it they don't have an established product under their belt Avalanche like a lot of the stuff they put out have been kiddie games Toy Story 3 obviously was them too and if you look at what they did before Disney picked them up they did a lot of bad games like Sub-Zero Mythologies and all that now granted
7052972	7058637	We all make mistakes and we should give them a chance that maybe this is something that will break through, but I'm concerned.
7062075	7066658	The gameplay footage didn't really make me go, you know?
7067198	7068219	I didn't lose my shit.
7068699	7070360	Well, did you watch any of the interview videos?
7070380	7072061	They actually had more in-depth gameplay stuff.
7072121	7072961	To be fair, no.
7072981	7076503	I only watched the common trailer that was out there.
7076523	7076884	It looked okay.
7076904	7081786	I mean, it's not like, you know, none of this is really making me go, oh, I gotta pick that up.
7081827	7086529	I mean, the toy box mode sounds really cool, but once again, I was kind of even thinking about it.
7086549	7087350	I'm like, do I even...
7088050	7088570	Warhammer Disney K
7110657	7111658	I mean, it's just so cool.
7111698	7114841	I'd have to see what stuff comes out and how it gets priced.
7116202	7122246	I think it's going to sell really well, and the fact that they have this whole kind of synergy where you can build your own world is kind of unique.
7122366	7122806	I don't know.
7122887	7127610	That's really going to set them apart from Skylanders, because Skylanders is like, you buy a bunch of characters, you play one game.
7128291	7129612	It's a dungeon crawler, and that's it.
7129872	7133094	Whereas this, they could have multiple game types.
7133134	7136897	They could have, you know, this is going to be a racing game, this is going to be an adventure game, whatever.
7137097	7142780	Something to remember about those little RFIDs too is that they don't just, you know, they're not just chips that transmit data.
7142840	7143761	They can save data.
7143921	7144121	Yes.
7144201	7145521	Just a limited amount, right?
7145601	7146122	Just a little bit.
7146422	7149704	But maybe enough so that you could bring with you a level design.
7150064	7150264	Yes.
7150744	7151004	Maybe.
7152025	7154346	Or at least you can share those on the internet, apparently.
7154606	7157808	Like with other people and play their creations or invite your friends over.
7157848	7160449	You can do four-player co-op over the internet.
7160469	7163571	Okay.
7164870	7165210	I don't know.
7165551	7168434	I guess I'll wait until a little closer, look at some of the reviews.
7168474	7172418	There's that part of me that's like, must have all figurines, must have them all.
7173179	7174721	The figurines look cool.
7174961	7176903	I saw pictures of them.
7177504	7178125	They're well done.
7179460	7184122	And here's the thing, too, that I'm not too positive on, but it looks like they articulate.
7184203	7195047	It looks like the arms, at least they've got seams on the arms where it looks like they could move, limited at least, but that's more than Skylanders can, so, you know, that'd be interesting.
7195067	7198289	Is that why they're going to be more expensive than the figure, or is that just Disney tax?
7198389	7200150	They're not that much more expensive than Skylanders.
7200170	7201110	But they are more expensive.
7201330	7202391	Yes, they are more expensive.
7202451	7203231	Is that Disney tax?
7203611	7204412	Probably Disney tax.
7205792	7206273	Just curious.
7207513	7211497	Alright, well that is definitely the future of gaming, like it or not.
7213199	7225030	It concerns me though is that if we support Disney Infinity, that we're saying we want more of this, and I really worry about the barrage of knockoffs that this whole Skylander thing is going to cause.
7225070	7225690	Pokemon.
7226831	7228232	Well, yeah, I was talking to Shane about that.
7228252	7232193	I was like, can you imagine if Nintendo just said, we want to do Pokemon like this?
7232714	7233694	Shane would have them all.
7233734	7234634	Oh, my God.
7234935	7236195	But he brought up a good point with me.
7236235	7237816	Maybe he'll call in the show later and talk about it.
7237896	7240257	He said that the creator of Pokemon actually hates DLC.
7241057	7243198	So, they may not be... But I...
7243978	7246601	He may hate DLC, but they're going to have DLC in the next Pokemon game.
7248303	7250305	He may hate it all he wants, but he's not calling a shot.
7250325	7252227	And they used to do those Burger King toys back in the day.
7252247	7252868	That's what I told him.
7252908	7255371	I said they used to have little toys for all the Pokemon.
7255391	7262698	Can you imagine that they will literally have Pokeballs that you put your fucking figurine in that you put it out on...
7263399	7267261	That was Burger King like 12 years ago.
7267361	7275625	I have to tell you, after they banned all those Pokeballs, we went to a Burger King and went through the drive-thru 10 times to get more Pokeballs so that we could hang them up on the tree.
7275645	7276565	So you didn't have to get yourself with them?
7277106	7279107	No, just so that we could have a pile of Pokeballs.
7279787	7283311	We actually had a box full of Pokeballs and little Pokemon toys because we wanted all of them.
7284392	7286714	And then finally we're like, wait, this is stupid and gave them all away.
7286914	7289336	I went as Ash Ketchum one Halloween.
7289436	7292740	And thank you to Burger King for those Pokeballs because they were great for my costume.
7292800	7301188	And you know, and honestly, maybe the other thing that got me psyched about the whole Disney Infinity thing is the fact that they had Nero's me and you in the trailer, which is pretty awesome.
7301208	7302089	I was like, yes!
7303956	7305998	Arcade Arcade Arcade Arcade Arcade Arcade Arcade
7332060	7335822	and Darren Spahn, who is the owner of this with his wife, Mickey.
7336102	7342884	What they're trying to do with this, they want to recreate the experience of arcade gaming saying, quote, people have lost that social experience.
7343165	7344925	They sit on couches with their Xbox.
7344945	7346066	They never talk to their kids.
7346386	7351608	You want to come to a place where you can play together with your kids too and find something that the whole family enjoys.
7352649	7355751	Now, it should be noted, this place has been around since November of 2010.
7356532	7367242	It is just making the rounds on the Game Blog this week because of an article that was discovered on Statesman.com, which I'm assuming is kind of like an Austin, so people were able to find it on the internet and kind of figure out more about this place.
7367642	7373267	But yay to this guy and his wife bringing back the retro arcade stuff.
7373347	7374028	I think that's great.
7375602	7398017	even the article the original article talks about some games like Missile Command they don't make much money but he keeps them because they're classics and the other thing about the arcade I was looking at the actual website everything in that arcade is for sale so let's say you go in and you're playing Galaga and you're like I want to buy this machine you can buy it so it's almost like a interactive show floor where you could buy the games I think it's kind of awesome
7400011	7400391	I don't know.
7401071	7402092	I'll take all of them.
7403152	7406753	There did seem to be a healthy amount of ticket spitting games, too.
7406833	7410714	More like the hand-me-down kind of ticket spitting games, like things that were in arcades a few years ago.
7411474	7412555	You can't go wrong with skee-ball.
7412715	7413435	I don't love skee-ball.
7413455	7414595	Skee-ball is amazing.
7414635	7417076	Press the button to stop the light types of games, you know?
7418177	7419637	What was the... That's how they throw birthday parties.
7419657	7420537	Smoke and token.
7421398	7422718	And spider stomp.
7424319	7445654	uh apparently a second and third location elsewhere in Austin could be coming this year and you know remember guys he opened this place in November 2010 I mean the economy's been kind of in the shitter in the past couple years yet this place didn't go out of business that's awesome and clearly it's because of the Star Trek backdrop he has there in the arcade that's what keeps that place awesome anyhow
7446721	7447381	There's a no fear.
7447742	7449242	You know who else has a no fear?
7449422	7450683	Dan, right?
7450963	7451623	We had one.
7452224	7453784	That was the last table we sold.
7454085	7461548	They need to have a giant Picard picture on the wall with him saying make it so or something.
7461788	7462429	Somewhere in there.
7462449	7463369	That would be pretty awesome.
7466150	7467211	Alright, let's move on with more news.
7468570	7469691	Oh yeah, it's my turn, isn't it?
7470772	7471593	Silly iPad.
7472273	7477297	Well, there is a game coming out by an indie studio called Stab Yourself.
7478398	7479399	That's the best name ever.
7479799	7481321	It's stabyourself.net.
7482362	7487086	They basically recreate 80s games and then apply modern physics to them.
7487506	7494312	They've done a game called Not Tetris, where basically it's like Game Boy Tetris, except the bricks actually fall with the same momentum a brick really would.
7495072	7495772	Mario, M-A-R-I-Zero
7520806	7523048	and the ghosts don't move by themselves either.
7523088	7525129	They might fall into you as you're turning.
7525589	7530433	So it applies a new aspect of physics to the game and I need this in my life.
7530493	7532794	That is actually badass, I've got to say.
7533034	7535176	That is a really smart innovation.
7535956	7541000	Obviously, it's stab yourself with love and good ideas is what they talk about in the name.
7541080	7542481	It's stab yourself with innovation.
7542681	7543561	Yes, exactly.
7543741	7545262	It's stabyourself.net.
7545743	7546303	Go get it.
7546523	7546924	I want it.
7547144	7547724	I'm going to get it.
7548625	7550506	I love that you can control it with a steering wheel.
7550986	7551727	I totally did.
7551747	7554608	Well, you know, we've got Dan's steering wheel rig.
7555169	7555989	We could totally do that.
7556049	7556970	Oh, no, no, no.
7557450	7558591	Okay, I have to add something.
7558711	7560352	Rewind back into the gaming week.
7560832	7562393	Do you know what my husband is doing tonight?
7563514	7568617	He is building himself a three monitor rig just for playing Gran Turismo and Outrun.
7570427	7570987	My husband!
7571228	7573149	I didn't realize OutRun used three monitors.
7573809	7574009	Yeah.
7574390	7576231	Like the old OutRun or the new OutRun?
7576271	7576831	The newer ones.
7577892	7584296	He's basically building the rig so he can hook up his PC to do full three-screen gaming.
7584797	7590641	Now, if you're going to do something like that with an Xbox or a PS3, you actually have to have other systems, like multiple systems to get it to run.
7590661	7593422	Yeah, I know Gran Turismo, you need like three systems, three monitors.
7593562	7600187	Yeah, but he's doing something so that he can play all of the PC-based games with three monitors.
7600567	7603109	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7621385	7647448	um apparently the whole thing was that Wildman's Kickstarter needed to actually it needs to earn that money because otherwise they're gonna they would have had to lay everyone off anyways without um any of their like paid time off and stuff cashed out and any of the benefits or severances and stuff um and uh right now I think I'm actually gonna check to see how their Kickstarter is doing um
7649977	7651218	Thank you for watching!
7670793	7674477	and unfortunately it's just bad timing I guess.
7674677	7680302	They just had to lay them off now so they have money to actually do that.
7680342	7684166	They're still operating but it's way slimmed down.
7684386	7689831	In fact, pretty much everybody's gone except for the head of the studio and I think a couple people.
7691796	7693539	So that's kind of going to suck.
7694340	7701111	The other thing too is Codemasters has laid off 80 people as well and they're restructuring.
7701692	7706379	Sorry, there's three companies tonight that are having major, major problems.
7706604	7707684	Yeah.
7707804	7717428	Codemasters, really, they don't have... I mean, they have had some okay games come out, but a lot of their stuff recently hasn't done terribly well.
7717528	7718569	I want to say... I'm trying to think.
7718969	7722690	Dirt 3 was the last game I remember them having put out.
7722750	7732214	I know they have Grid 2 coming, and also their Formula 1 title didn't do terribly well, and I don't think their Formula 1 kart racing game did terribly well either.
7733634	7734455	So that kind of sucks.
7734875	7736837	Maybe they can make something other than racing games.
7739299	7740800	I think they tried that and it wasn't terribly well.
7740820	7745003	I was going to say, but what's worked for them, like Dirt was one of their biggest games.
7745564	7746344	Grid looked pretty cool.
7746364	7747205	Yeah, Grid too.
7747265	7749807	Grid too, so I'm looking forward to see what that looks like.
7750668	7755151	I'd love to see a next-gen Dirt game on the new consoles when they come out.
7755211	7756212	I mean, that'd be pretty awesome.
7757373	7777502	I'd also like to see a next-gen Ridge Racer that doesn't fucking suck Namco you have more time come on not a fucking rehash of what fuck seven or six or how many times what game did they actually have new tracks in was that four four had new tracks in it I mean seriously new Ridge Racer would be awesome
7778760	7780741	All right, well, moving on to another story here.
7798109	7799350	Thank you for watching!
7818265	7818926	and DarkSakura.
7835149	7842214	He announced his retirement on January 17th and the thread has grown to over 170 pages.
7842915	7851201	Rob Pardo, the chief creative officer at Blizzard, came into the thread saying, "...this thread saddens me greatly.
7851701	7860568	I know that the Battle.net forums have earned a reputation for rough justice, but I do not believe justice is being served by how people are speaking about Jay's departure from Diablo 3."
7861989	7862570	and DarkSakura.com
7878547	7882850	Very interesting protective parent kind of attitude going on there.
7882930	7885552	That's caring about your employees.
7885612	7887193	That's interesting.
7887313	7890936	They could hire me now.
7891236	7893618	If you were the lead designer on Diablo 3, what would you do?
7895839	7896199	Garrus.
7896940	7898481	Hey, I didn't say it.
7898941	7899642	I didn't say it.
7901483	7904085	I would license out to BioWare to make a Mass Effect MMO.
7905136	7911781	Anyhow, now he acknowledged also, this is what we're saying, the Diablo community deserves an even better game.
7912601	7918625	We have a talented team in place and have no intention of stopping work on Diablo 3 until it is the best game in the franchise.
7919706	7926330	So interestingly, this game is coming up on, what, nine months out and they're still trying to get the game they really want.
7927759	7929782	This is a weird place we're at in the industry.
7929842	7934268	I mean, it's not that Diablo 3 is bad, but it was extremely disappointing.
7934648	7935730	Extremely disappointing.
7935770	7937112	And Torchlight 2 is kind of better.
7939927	7942509	Anyhow, let's open up the mailbag.
7942549	7944130	Let's see what the listeners have to say, shall we?
7946551	7949513	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is the place you can email us each week.
7950114	7955117	And usually, DarkSakura will dive into the email bag headfirst, but not tonight.
7956337	7961521	As you can tell by my sexy-ass voice tonight, I really don't have much of a voice to do it.
7961661	7964162	Impersonating your mother earlier probably didn't help that.
7964202	7964883	No, it didn't.
7964903	7965964	I'm suffering for that now.
7966884	7967705	You know what you need?
7967725	7968165	More coffee.
7968993	7971395	You know what, that's a good idea and I know where you keep it, but I'm not doing it
7989932	7990332	Oh my god Oh my god
8010683	8011484	DarkSakura
8033661	8037544	This email definitely needs some more Dancer, so let's give him some Dancer.
8037584	8038845	God damn it, now I can't find Dancer.
8039746	8050935	You know, that was like one of the first Bimani game I actually bought brand new that wasn't a DDR.
8055330	8059574	I remember how we would all sit around with like little figurines and stand behind people while they played that.
8059594	8060034	That was the best.
8060054	8060855	That was absolutely the best.
8060915	8064038	And then try to parra parra with Last Message.
8064298	8066500	Here's the thing I want to know about this email.
8066520	8070804	So I actually offline earlier in the week, I wrote back to Plagueis.
8070844	8072045	So I'm waiting to hear back.
8072085	8073246	And I was like, yeah, it's us.
8073546	8074927	Basically, long story short.
8074967	8080132	But my curiosity is I've been searching for an online radio show for a long while now.
8080572	8090137	and after haphazardly stumbling across this podcast so it's like he was looking for the old show and found this mess instead.
8090157	8091778	We still have our Bimani love.
8091838	8093359	Of course we have our Bimani love.
8094379	8095860	Akira Yamaoka is still God.
8099562	8099842	Anyhow.
8101403	8102583	Let's move on with more emails.
8102683	8106345	Although I do have to say I have a special place in my heart for Desiree.
8107646	8107966	Why is that?
8108919	8111138	Fuckin' Desro I love Cobalt
8112417	8114738	Moving on to an email from Redertainment.
8114758	8118698	There is another aspect to the mandatory internet connection issue that's not being brought up.
8140143	8156274	what if the person playing the game can't connect to the publisher's servers not because of any problem with the consumer or the publisher but because of an ISP's complete and utter fucking incompetence what if due to the ISP being run by morons who think a foresight is something only the uncircumcised deal with
8159807	8160288	That was good.
8161128	8167695	The consumer or the publisher cannot connect to one another because of a failure by one or more internet service providers.
8168036	8174843	This is just one of the reasons why I think of publishers mandating consumers be connected to the internet as a bad idea.
8174963	8179528	Stay black, redertainment, and yes, I did just come up with the foresight line.
8179808	8180169	Trainer.
8181130	8182351	Is that because you always say Garrus?
8183372	8183993	He says trainer.
8184293	8184533	I don't know.
8184553	8185614	Anyway.
8186275	8189899	So... You notice I haven't said it once during the course of the show.
8189959	8190900	I've said it like three times now.
8191261	8196406	Shitty internet service providers being a reason... Well, I mean, you're preaching to the choir, Redertainment.
8196446	8197547	This shit's a bad idea.
8197627	8201432	And you're just throwing another ingredient in the pot on why this is a bad idea.
8201572	8201812	I mean...
8203374	8206276	Uh, we had in the past, the show would drop several times.
8206596	8214383	Now, maybe that wasn't the ISP's fault necessarily, but, uh, you know, if you have a bad router or something, you know, you're gonna pay for that with your game.
8214463	8216124	It's just, it's ridiculous.
8218306	8219807	I, I agree with you, Red Entertainment.
8219847	8220088	Yes.
8220568	8221068	Yes, sir.
8221189	8221429	Yes.
8224524	8226585	Another email here from AZHP.
8226925	8227546	Hey, OLR.
8227586	8229247	This is a long one, by the way, but it's a good one.
8229868	8230688	AZHP here.
8230748	8232110	Sorry in advance for the long email.
8232230	8232710	You're forgiven.
8233250	8237474	But it's on two subjects that are really important to me, and I'm sure some of you as well, so I hope you read it.
8237974	8248783	I remember you guys mentioning the Awesome Games Done Quick Charity Marathon for the Prevent Cancer Foundation on the show last week, and I wanted to give a little more background on it in case anyone was interested in the marathon or the cause.
8249423	8250304	Thank you for watching.
8275505	8278191	Two-year research grants for cancer research.
8278271	8279093	Well, job well done.
8279674	8284443	I had no idea that they had collected all these travelers from around the world.
8285754	8287816	I had no idea whatsoever that that was the case.
8287856	8288657	So thank you for sharing.
8289377	8294222	I honestly thought it was like a group of like a college club or something that all was getting together to do it.
8294362	8296464	So I think that's really cool.
8297324	8298265	So props to you guys.
8300067	8309095	Like you guys said, with all the bad press games have gotten due to recent events, it's really amazing that these people donated their vacation time and money to support this amazing cause.
8309575	8325891	Some of the more impressive runs were Final Fantasy IX done in 9 hours, Super Mario 64, all 120 stars done in under 2 hours by the world record holder Siglemic, Zelda Ocarina of Time done in 23 minutes using some game breaking bugs, and more.
8326591	8336041	All the games were done in one sitting and it was amazing to watch all week, sometimes during work, and see how amazingly good and consistent people were at these games.
8336362	8346412	I wasn't going to donate much originally, but after seeing how passionate these people were about the cause and the games, I eventually donated $80 over the week, though some people donated hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
8347213	8348393	No, that's really adorable.
8348413	8348994	And it is sad.
8372581	8373922	Sorry for the long email, guys.
8374143	8374703	You're forgiven.
8374763	8375224	Good cause.
8375664	8385172	And in case anyone is interested in watching the marathon videos, you can find them in the features section of speeddemosarchive.com Yours truly, AZHP.
8385272	8388015	Well, I hope it's an even bigger success for them next year.
8388295	8389956	I didn't realize they were bringing all these people in.
8389977	8391778	They could do an expo out of this shit.
8391898	8394340	A speedrun expo would be pretty awesome.
8394380	8395461	Yeah, it would be, actually.
8395601	8398404	So, you know, bigger and better next time.
8399997	8400438	That's great.
8401279	8401820	Good job, guys.
8402681	8405545	If anybody from that effort is listening, a tip of the hat to you.
8407088	8411574	Lastly, but not leastly, GamerGirl with an email.
8412416	8413918	Or as she signed it, GG.
8414699	8415560	Good game, GamerGirl.
8416345	8420126	Dear OLR, I first would like to say that if I make any mistakes, i.e.
8420166	8421707	grammatical errors, I apologize.
8422087	8424268	You guys, as always, have an amazing show.
8424548	8425308	Keep up the good work.
8425568	8429570	I never thought my life would change so drastically with everyone's help.
8430270	8437313	I got to thinking a lot about how everything good happened to me because of OLR, and it never ceases to amaze me how you guys are always helping everyone.
8437833	8445076	As a matter of fact, as of January 19, 2013, your very own Dark Tetsuya and Gamer Girl are officially engaged.
8445936	8446277	Wow.
8447258	8448239	Congratulations.
8449480	8451782	Another OLR love story for the books, guys.
8451903	8452563	Well done.
8452804	8454145	As always, I enjoy the show.
8454525	8458310	Thanks again for introducing me to my best friend and soon-to-be life partner, Gamer Girl.
8460011	8460312	Wow.
8462165	8463866	I happened to see that on Facebook earlier.
8464087	8475977	Yeah, yeah, I mean, I know we got to say, yeah, I had heard of this before the email came in, but still, just to kind of hear, have it put in that perspective kind of way, like, you know, that they had met through OLR is really like, wow.
8478539	8481641	I've been blown away with some of the emails and comments from beginning the past couple weeks.
8482302	8484504	2013 is the year you're trying to make me cry, y'all.
8485984	8486565	Well, good job.
8486885	8494411	Does this mean we have to send over... I don't know where they're getting married or whatever, if it's going to be here or... Because I think they have a distance right now between them.
8494852	8498295	But I wonder if we need to send along a tape message or something.
8498315	8499296	Or is that even appropriate?
8499356	8499696	I don't know.
8501037	8501418	You know what?
8501478	8503880	Get the speed run demo guys at your wedding reception.
8503920	8505341	That's how you do it.
8505581	8506062	That'd be great.
8507983	8508404	Good job.
8509685	8512848	A big congratulations and a perfect way to end the mailbag this week.
8512888	8515690	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
8515730	8516671	Wowzy, wowzy, wow.
8517071	8518553	Thanks for doing the mailbox for me.
8518893	8519554	You're welcome.
8519974	8522956	But you're going to need to fend for yourself on this upcoming segment.
8524037	8527821	We're going to flip a 180, turn this car around and go from lovey-dovey stuff.
8527841	8529142	We're going to flip this bitch.
8529222	8532505	We're going to flip a bitch right now and get into the bitching.
8547853	8552978	My FU goes to the old woman who was driving in front of me on my way here.
8555380	8557662	You know how some people turn into the suicide lane?
8557722	8558843	You know the turn lane in the middle?
8559244	8562667	Well, this woman doesn't even signal the moment this red truck starts pulling into it.
8562687	8565590	We're on the inside lane heading toward here.
8566050	8566811	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8582566	8584688	And she was just moving back and forth in between lanes.
8584708	8586769	She's like, I'm just going to use both lanes.
8586809	8587089	Fuck.
8587609	8588410	I'm safer in the middle.
8589551	8590692	So I was like, yeah.
8590872	8593293	Another F you goes to me losing my voice.
8595014	8599017	I've been fighting off getting sick, and I think I'm over it.
8599137	8600698	It's just left me with a really sore throat.
8605617	8609379	Hey, DarkTetsuya and GamerGirl, guess what you have to look forward to?
8636584	8636784	Grab!
8636804	8636985	Grab!
8654685	8657027	American Idol's on and this girl is good.
8657207	8661790	No, no, she is over the Nicki Minaj, Mariah thing.
8661890	8662751	She's over that.
8662851	8666133	No, I didn't even see that show.
8666273	8669435	I had no idea because I don't watch cable anymore, even basic TV anymore.
8669475	8671717	So it's like, I didn't even know.
8671857	8673818	That's just crazy that I shouldn't.
8674338	8675319	I see the billboards.
8675679	8679062	But, well, in San Francisco, there was a huge one going over the Bay Bridge.
8679202	8681023	Yeah, so, I mean, that's fine.
8682782	8684684	All right, let's see my FUs of the week.
8685084	8693471	I've been getting, like, weird side pains again, and that always freaks me out because, you know, long-time listeners of the show remember, like, five years ago I was in the hospital because of some of that stuff.
8693491	8695653	So, like, every time I get side pains, I get, like, really freaked out.
8695673	8696754	Like, oh, my God, I'm sick again.
8696814	8697555	And then it's gas.
8698215	8701518	Yeah, or, like, I'm just gaining weight or something, so...
8702879	8705139	Here's to hoping it's fat, nothing else.
8705800	8707040	Hey Rob, avoid the Taco Bell.
8707340	8707540	What?
8707560	8709340	That's what you get for eating Jack in the Box.
8709800	8710861	I didn't eat Jack in the Box.
8711041	8712081	Loki talked about it.
8712221	8714701	I wanted to eat Jack in the Box today.
8714841	8716782	I really wanted to go there and be late.
8717782	8720862	We went out for gay brunch as we usually do on Sundays.
8720902	8722763	And I call it gay brunch because we eat brunch with other gays.
8723483	8725923	And I wanted to eat healthy.
8726403	8728164	I'm sorry sir, we don't do salads until 11.30pm.
8730339	8732662	LOL, it's time for red velvet pancakes.
8732942	8734163	Yeah, I know, right?
8734303	8740710	Well, I got Hawaiian bread French toast, which is really good, don't get me wrong, but probably not the healthiest thing I could eat.
8741311	8747778	Whereas Alan's like, I was going to get the veggie omelette, but I decided I'd go a little dairy and get turkey.
8750720	8765918	by the way, Alan has lost like a lot of weight I was about to say, Alan's doing really, really well you think I would like, you know, try to take some cues and do the same thing now you can be the like what's the old ass poem Jack Spratt and his wife laughs
8766118	8767138	Well, here's the thing.
8767298	8769959	Alan's got the advantage on me where he walks to work and all that.
8770039	8773001	And I've been very bad when it gets to motivated for exercise.
8773021	8775461	Like I really need to really motivate myself to exercise.
8775481	8777062	That's the only way I'm ever going to change things.
8777402	8778182	And then snacking.
8778382	8780063	I am a terrible, terrible snacker.
8780523	8781684	Like that is my weakness.
8782104	8783884	I really need to just get rid of every...
8785405	8810418	like horrible snack out of this house and have nothing but carrots and celery in the fridge so I have no choice but then that's not fair on Fridays at our work they pop popcorn in a popcorn machine we have and I'm not talking about like a popcorn machine like an air popper I'm talking about a big fucking popcorn machine that they have the movie theaters popcorn machine they pop extra popcorn for me they gave me a bowl like a big ass bowl I eat more popcorn at that company than fucking people at the company other than me
8811894	8812234	DarkSakura.com
8836323	8837324	So here's the thing.
8838224	8839745	They don't have that at Jack in the Box.
8839845	8839965	No.
8840065	8841906	Jack in the Box has deep fried tacos.
8841966	8843146	That's what you get at Jack in the Box.
8844107	8844747	Red Velvet Pancakes.
8844807	8847688	We went to a brunch place once and they happened to have Red Velvet Pancakes.
8847708	8848769	It was a place downtown, right?
8848849	8849429	Ermagerd.
8850110	8850790	That we went to.
8850830	8851770	Was it Red Rabbit?
8851970	8852331	I think so.
8852391	8854132	I went to the pumpkin and you had Red Velvet.
8854152	8854532	Yeah.
8855452	8856132	Fucking amazing.
8857133	8858033	I want pancakes now.
8858794	8859234	Good times.
8859537	8860158	Pancakes.
8860619	8862001	All right, that's it for the FUs of the week.
8862521	8866788	Skype lines soon, Twitter topics soon as well, but first, a couple more news stories.
8868047	8868347	All right.
8869128	8870929	And let's see here.
8871029	8875072	Let's talk a little bit about the next generation of Kinect.
8875092	8879275	Because, of course, we know that the next Xbox system is going to have Kinect.
8879635	8882156	And we need to know what the hell it's going to be able to do.
8882637	8884698	Well, this may be kind of an idea.
8885719	8894505	The company that was behind the Kinect sensor in the first place has this cool video that they put out kind of showing what it's going to do.
8898487	8927197	everything that the original Kinect was supposed to do but didn't actually kind of do you know the whole closed thing they're saying that they're going to try to work this technology into pretty much everything into like you know non-display stuff to all the computers and it's just going to work it's going to have you know high speed tracking all that stuff and actually the little thing that they've got there the prototype looks exactly like the Kinect with some extra bullshit sticking out of the top I'm not really sure what the hell that is
8927977	8932320	But it's in developers' hands right now, so they're going to be using this.
8932800	8936782	And it's called Capri, the next generation of censors.
8939863	8941023	The next generation.
8941544	8941744	Yeah.
8941944	8949949	They're saying it's supposed to have... They're going to be trying to fit it into everyday devices, and they're saying the same resolution as the Kinect.
8950689	8952350	And I don't know.
8952450	8953151	It looks pretty cool.
8954151	8959334	I mean, the video... Watching the video reminded me a lot of just everything.
8959494	8961035	They show this guy at a presentation.
8961055	8961135	He's...
8964232	8967719	Manipulating stuff on the screen as you would think you would be able to do.
8969042	8969724	They're talking about...
8971683	8976465	Even stuff to where, oh hey, I have someone coming over in facial recognition.
8976485	8977406	Oh, it's my friend.
8977766	8979166	It's going to unlock the door for him.
8979807	8980907	And then he comes in and murders you.
8982268	8987690	That's for switching channels on your TV by just kind of going, eh, moving my hand back and forth.
8988391	8988831	That type of stuff.
8988851	8990852	Because you know, pushing buttons on a remote is so hard.
8992092	8993353	Move my hand back and forth.
8993873	8996014	Swiping a fly away and your TV's going crazy.
8998155	9000316	Alright, one more news story for you guys.
9000556	9006038	Okay, this isn't gaming technically, but it is the voice of Geeks Network, you guys.
9006078	9008439	So once in a while, we gotta blur the line a little bit.
9008760	9018304	And this has to do with a musician who did make one of the greatest video game songs of the past 10 years still alive from Portal, right?
9020805	9026249	I'm making a note here He is so nice in person
9036275	9036395	L.A.
9036455	9038517	faced with the Oakland booties
9067890	9069492	I heard this, huh?
9069753	9070834	I listened to it after.
9070854	9075840	I only heard the lounge version by Lounge Against the Machine.
9076000	9076381	Right, right.
9077362	9078463	Yeah, Richard Cheese.
9078784	9079004	Right.
9079264	9080746	And, of course, Sir Mix-A-Lot.
9080946	9083930	So, technically, it is Sir Mix-A-Lot's song.
9084070	9085212	And Joko did a cover.
9085492	9087653	He did a cover, but it was a licensed cover.
9087713	9091256	He licensed the rights to do that and he made his own original version.
9091916	9094298	It's very unique and very different.
9094318	9097440	It's kind of like Johnny Cash's Hurt.
9097460	9099301	The Nine Inch Nails version, amazing.
9099601	9102263	Johnny Cash's version, fucking amazing.
9103043	9108527	It's hard for me to say that because I love the Nine Inch Nails version so much, but they are both so fucking good, but very different.
9108547	9113370	When Trent Reznor is saying that he likes it better, then you know you've got amazing.
9113570	9114551	But here's the problem.
9115390	9116831	Glee, the TV show.
9116971	9119232	You know, they do a lot of covers and all that stuff.
9120933	9127777	Here is the Glee version of Baby Got Back set to be on the Sadie Hawkins episode that will be on the 24th.
9128197	9130178	This song was available in the U.S.
9130298	9130898	iTunes store.
9131038	9131659	It was pulled.
9131739	9134140	It was still spotted on the Swedish iTunes store.
9134200	9135300	So, yes, this is legit.
9135661	9139202	See if you see any similarities here in the Glee version of Baby Got Back.
9141404	9141784	L.A.
9141844	9143765	face with the Oakland Moonies
9151474	9153216	I think I heard that before somewhere.
9162992	9168975	Look, it's one thing to cover the song, especially when you're going to do it like the original.
9170115	9177498	I don't think I need to play the original version of Baby Got Back, but I'll do the Rob Roberts cover of Baby Got Back.
9177538	9177919	You ready?
9178819	9180060	Oh my God.
9180420	9182100	Becky, look at her butt.
9182280	9183261	It is so big.
9183321	9183741	Okay, look.
9183881	9185882	So obviously the original was very, very different, right?
9185922	9187043	And had the whole beat to it.
9188283	9193266	So, for Glee to just totally rip this off the way they did is kind of shitty.
9193726	9195107	It's really shitty.
9195167	9198129	To think that nobody would notice is crazy.
9198469	9203832	Now, just so you know, Joko, what is making the internet rally around him is that he posted to his Twitter
9204884	9205625	I had no idea.
9206426	9207146	He had no clue.
9207246	9208367	And he's like, WTF?
9208708	9212111	And he is trying to see what kind of legal action is available at this point, but it's complicated.
9212211	9216415	I mean, it wasn't really his song in the first place, although it was his arrangement.
9216995	9217836	Here's the best part.
9217956	9219117	You might be getting to this, Loki.
9219718	9227025	In the lyrics, if I were to play the full thing, a part where he changed the lyrics from Sir Mix-a-Lot to Johnny C...
9228366	9232810	Glee sings in their version, Johnny C. So you know damn well where they got it.
9233510	9234631	There is no mystery.
9235192	9236913	They removed one of them at the end.
9237514	9240556	The 1-900, you know, what was it?
9241557	9245000	He did something else, 1-900 something, and then he changed it.
9246341	9246561	But...
9248953	9249554	Come on, man.
9249574	9252556	That is just blatant.
9254098	9256840	And even he said they stole the arrangement.
9257160	9264407	There's actually duck sounds or something in the background that he sampled or something that are in that song in exactly the same spot.
9264447	9266869	They stole the instrumental and just sang over it.
9270272	9270352	Ah.
9272228	9274509	So, yeah, I don't know what's going to happen from here.
9274649	9277170	Do you think legally he could do anything about it?
9277190	9277510	Yeah, he can.
9277670	9278330	I think he can.
9278811	9280731	If they actually stole the lyrics or whatever?
9280751	9281892	Yeah, because it's his arrangement.
9282172	9283733	I think that he definitely has a case.
9286013	9291156	Well, gee, the folks in the chat rooms really seem to be enjoying the Rob Roberts cover of Baby Got Back.
9291236	9293857	So, big butts and I cannot lie.
9294177	9295737	You other brothers can't deny.
9296618	9297178	Okay, forget it.
9300663	9301444	The original's awesome.
9301504	9303265	Meanwhile, Alan is like, please stop.
9303546	9304006	Please don't.
9304867	9305247	Knock it off.
9305287	9307409	Yeah, but Alan, you weren't here watching Rob shake his ass.
9310111	9311633	I like Ross Steel UT's comment.
9311953	9313855	Seriously, that's some Milli Vanilli shit.
9315357	9318078	I want to, there's a little bit of a clap that I heard in the beginning.
9318118	9324960	I want them to do the vanilla ice defense where it's like, but see mine went, you know, the original went boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
9325060	9328121	But mine went boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
9328761	9330221	You see it's different, right?
9330441	9330861	Totally.
9331761	9332542	It's totally different.
9333202	9335122	We added the psh in there.
9335202	9335903	It makes it different.
9336023	9337323	Yeah, I was so under pressure.
9337914	9340617	Ranma in the chat says, wait, hold it, Glee is still relevant?
9340697	9344180	Apparently, but it's sinking in the ratings, but I heard they're going to renew it.
9344420	9351866	I want to know, okay, because it's supposed to be this new guy that's coming to the school or whatever that's hitting on the clearly gay guy on the show.
9352327	9358592	Isn't it a little awkward to be singing a song about I like big butts and about all these things about butts that you like and stuff?
9358612	9360794	Because it seems a little weird.
9361174	9363176	I mean, I don't know.
9364648	9365990	It's just a weird song anyway.
9366030	9368973	It's weird because no one over 12 watches Glee in the first place.
9369273	9374600	And honestly, the people that watch Glee or whatever, do they really know what Baby Got Back is?
9374660	9378244	I mean, a lot of the kids were probably not even born when that song came out.
9381371	9381731	I don't know.
9382312	9383092	Is it that old?
9383932	9386334	I just wish Glee would get cancelled.
9386454	9387074	That's what I wish.
9388555	9388995	Alright.
9391136	9392177	That does it for news tonight.
9392217	9393037	That was the last story.
9395178	9398920	1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9398960	9402442	The Skype line is open right now if you want to give us a call.
9403022	9404864	and while we wait for some calls to come in.
9405004	9407446	Oh, it is already lighting up on the phone.
9407486	9410549	Let's go to the phones and say hello to whoever's on the line.
9410869	9411970	Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.
9411990	9412350	Who's this?
9413431	9413832	Hi.
9415173	9416414	Is that Bobby Blackwolf?
9416894	9417515	It's Bobby.
9417815	9418516	Hi, Bobby.
9418696	9419837	You don't sound so good, Bobby.
9419857	9422920	You sound like a sad panda or I should say a sad little birdie.
9423100	9424101	What's wrong, Bobby?
9424661	9425442	Sports ball.
9426223	9428585	Oh, did you have a rough day at work?
9430647	9432128	I need a cheer up.
9432148	9433569	Are there any new games coming out?
9433629	9434470	I need a diversion.
9434830	9435330	Not really.
9435370	9437051	There's Ni No Kuni.
9437111	9439433	Ni No Kuni's coming out this week, Poppy.
9441754	9442815	You could try the demo.
9442835	9446437	You could try your face.
9447799	9448179	Hey, wait.
9448359	9450120	Bobby, that's a response after my own heart.
9450140	9451941	That's the Jamie defense right there.
9452181	9455943	Okay, Bobby, it's just a game, Bobby.
9456663	9459284	Here, I got something to help you out, okay?
9459424	9466088	Let's go back to a time when your team was winning things, which I don't know if that actually exists, but we'll make believe.
9467188	9468049	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9493170	9494973	It kind of had a 2020 vibe to me.
9494993	9499678	But yeah, I mean, how many legit gamer news shows do you see on TV now?
9499798	9500239	Not a lot.
9501280	9502061	Yeah, exactly.
9502802	9507368	But it was a clip from the Philly Classic Game Expo, right?
9507924	9522914	Right, it was from 2004, in I think March of 2004, and it was the Philly Classic Gaming Expo, and I was actually a co-organizer of it, along with a couple other people, one of which was another moderator on the forums over at G4.
9523735	9524255	And we had...
9525336	9534381	All converged on Philly Classic 4 the year before, and we kind of had a table, and it was kind of a G4 forum meetup and stuff, and we had about 15 people.
9535182	9537743	And for Philly Classic 5, it was like 50 people.
9537803	9540285	It was kind of like our PAX 08 experience.
9540705	9542086	Yeah, oh man, I love PAX 08.
9542126	9543987	But it was basically the G4 version of it.
9544187	9544447	Right.
9544968	9548330	And what a lot of people in the OR audience...
9549289	9556811	Latched on to was the fact that when I was on it, beardless, because this was before the beard, there was a little bit of Bimani behind me.
9557731	9561532	And that was actually my setup at the show.
9561792	9564472	So as much as I rag on Bimani now, it wasn't dead then.
9565573	9568193	I think Seventh Style had just come out, maybe.
9569273	9570654	It was right around that time.
9570954	9571674	I'm not dead yet.
9572563	9600225	and this was before Guitar Hero so I'm like you know these are classics instant classics that's what I'll call it and he wanted you know kind of some Ruddy Gore, Mark Wolf who's in the video he kind of wanted some other like different type of stuff so I'm like fine I'll bring my stuff all my import consoles and everything and I brought my stereo system and they provided the TV and I had I would run that weekend I think I ran Beatmania 2DX I had Para Para Paradise which we played once
9601745	9609448	I had Taiko no Tetsujin and I had Donkey Kong.
9609468	9610328	I had both versions.
9612849	9616991	Tommy Tallarico was the first time he had ever played it.
9617151	9621733	One of the pictures I posted up on Twitter was actually Tommy Tallarico playing Taiko no Tetsujin for the first time.
9623090	9625592	and so because he was there, he was one of the guests there.
9625632	9634319	They actually had at Philly Classic 5, they had, no, I think it was Philly Classic 4, they actually had, and I can't remember her name, but the woman from Tron.
9635940	9636821	Olivia Wilde?
9637041	9637942	No, no, no, no, no.
9638002	9638882	No, no, the original Tron.
9639103	9641845	Oh, Wendy, they did the music, right?
9642465	9646108	No, the actual, the woman who played the love interest.
9646809	9647049	Oh, okay.
9648231	9650833	I think it's the only thing she's ever done that anybody remembers.
9651453	9653515	Because there was a movement to bring her back for the new movie.
9653635	9654075	It didn't work.
9654695	9658678	Yeah, but that's where I met Sid Meier.
9658698	9659979	He showed up there.
9660019	9663181	And in Philly Classic 5, they had Howard Scott Warshaw, who made E.T.
9663201	9663982	and all that stuff.
9664542	9667684	But it was a lot of fun, and I exposed a lot of people to that.
9667704	9669726	And then I also would run Guitaroman and Rez.
9670868	9671368	Music Game
9689940	9691301	Other people had the DDR stuff.
9691361	9692602	I'm like, I don't do the DDR.
9692642	9693723	I'm doing all the other stuff.
9693763	9694244	There you go.
9694344	9695645	Trying to bring the other stuff to light.
9695785	9702392	If you like DDR, then you might like... I mean, it's not running anymore, though, right?
9702752	9703413	It folded.
9703513	9705194	I mean, I'm sure business reasons or whatever.
9705234	9705855	They wanted to.
9705935	9713782	We had big plans for Philly Classic 6, but unfortunately, the people that were up in Philadelphia that ran it, there was a little bit of drama.
9715244	9740378	essentially the short version that I kind of remember is that they had kind of passed the keys on to another guy who completely changed the show and he changed it to something else and it folded after like two or three years so they had trusted somebody else with it and he's like yeah the classic games are kind of cool and stuff but we're going to expand and he thought really really big and then it kind of it petered out
9742841	9743742	That sucks.
9744022	9746325	You should definitely check out someday.
9746465	9753854	I know it involves traveling to California, but California Extreme is an awesome classic game show with all the old school arcade machines and stuff.
9753874	9755016	That's the kind of thing I think of.
9755379	9759361	It's really, really lots of fun.
9759381	9766046	There was one of the local arcade distributors that still worked in arcades with a lot of the classic systems.
9766626	9772670	They were on the East Coast somewhere, but they brought 50 arcade machines all set to free play to this show.
9773430	9779554	Basically, what we did is, leading up to my little rhythm game thing, they had the gaming experience through time.
9780114	9790756	And it was just, you could go up and go to these consoles and it would like, they started at like, you know, the Magnavox Odyssey and then an Atari 2600 all going up to Xbox, PlayStation 2 and stuff.
9790776	9796258	So you could actually go down the line and see, you know, the next console in time.
9796378	9797798	It's like an interactive timeline.
9798138	9798318	Yeah.
9798598	9798898	Awesome.
9799378	9802339	So we did stuff like that and it was a lot of fun.
9802867	9806109	Many folks in chat saying we should have a VOGCon.
9806189	9808691	We could have a VOGCon someday.
9808731	9810292	It's not outside the realm of possibility.
9810612	9815616	And then Brad from PodCulture, why don't you have VOGCon in Atlanta the day before DragonCon?
9816336	9818438	Yeah, why don't we just have it at DragonCon?
9818478	9819959	Probably the smartest idea.
9820099	9828264	I think certainly there should be, whether it's official or unofficial, a VOG event at DragonCon is certainly within the realm of possibility for this year.
9828304	9831406	Well, I mean, I've said we're going to have an official event.
9831707	9831887	Mm-hmm.
9832347	9833908	That's pretty much been confirmed to me.
9833968	9836950	I mean, obviously, I won't know for certain until, like, next month.
9837170	9837350	Right.
9837871	9844195	But, no, we've already got, like, an official panel, which means we'll be in the program and all that stuff.
9844835	9854441	But then other events, I mean, there's a huge gaming area, like tabletop gaming area downstairs, and we could easily, like, commandeer, like, a corner of that one night.
9854761	9855142	Awesome.
9855482	9856022	For just us.
9856282	9861566	So it sounds like if you want to meet as many VOG people as possible, Atlanta's going to be the place to be Labor Day weekend.
9861846	9862326	That's right.
9862627	9863147	There you go.
9863167	9863868	You should do it.
9864608	9866330	I won't be as depressed about sports ball.
9866530	9866890	What's that?
9867411	9868832	I won't be as depressed about sports ball.
9868872	9870313	Yes, it'll all be over by then.
9870393	9872555	If the Niners lose in a couple weeks, will it make you feel better?
9873716	9877078	No, see, I want them to win now because that means we lost to the champions.
9877379	9878600	Ah, that's a good way of thinking about it.
9879200	9886026	And here's the thing that made it worse, the sports ball thing worse, is because of the whole video game industry tie-in on my Twitter.
9886966	9891310	The majority of the video game industry, especially the PR context, guess where they live?
9891510	9892571	Of course, the Bay Area.
9892711	9893151	I know that.
9894151	9896953	So I did not check my personal Twitter all day.
9897013	9898093	I just could not take it.
9898133	9898794	Couldn't handle it.
9899214	9904997	Actually, I think the saddest picture you posted was the confetti cannon behind you guys, and you just put unused.
9905557	9906938	Yes, it was right there.
9906998	9910479	I actually took another picture of just my drum next to it, and everybody else had left.
9911160	9913781	It was just my drum next to the confetti cannon, but yeah, they...
9917394	9918054	I'm sorry about that.
9918074	9920396	Hey, there's always next year.
9920696	9921057	There is.
9921897	9923399	Well, Bobby, focus on the positive.
9924019	9927002	Lots of good things coming with VOG and all that in the future.
9927762	9931325	You did not have a show this week, sadly, but tell the folks where they can catch you next week.
9932546	9933707	Right here on VOG.
9934448	9935569	I'm the opening act.
9936528	9938409	and I will be live next week.
9938529	9941191	I will not be live the following week because of sports ball.
9941971	9949435	And that was the other bad thing because I go to a party because it's the time I see a lot of my friends and so I never do a show on the big super sports ball day.
9949995	9959120	But it was the first couple messages I got from my friends instead of saying, oh man, sorry and all that stuff and yeah, it was a closed game, blah, blah, blah.
9959360	9959861	No, they were like,
9960501	9964363	Yes, this means you're coming to our Super Bowl party and bringing your pizza dip.
9964383	9965223	And I'm like, guys!
9965444	9969546	Would you have actually had to fly to wherever they're having the Super Bowl this year?
9970166	9972367	The plan was we were going to go to New Orleans.
9972827	9978971	Even if we couldn't get into the game, we were going to do corporate events around New Orleans, maybe play in some of the bars.
9979311	9983993	We'd march the tailgates outside of the Superdome, and then we'd go to a bar and watch the game at a bar.
9984213	9985334	Tell me more about this pizza dip.
9988644	9989765	It's a trade secret.
10011227	10016935	and I also was given a tip that it is the best day to go to a theme park near here.
10017035	10019038	Not Disneyland but one of the other ones, Magic Mountain.
10019299	10020901	So I may go to Magic Mountain.
10022028	10022948	Alright, we'll see.
10023949	10025770	So, yep.
10025810	10026610	You guys cheered me up.
10026650	10027171	Thank you guys.
10027491	10027991	Aw, thank you.
10028031	10028711	I'm glad we could.
10028912	10032994	And I'm glad we get to have you at the end of our show because you're always kind enough to have us on every week.
10033014	10036315	I also cheered you up by beating all your scores on Forza Horizon.
10036475	10036996	Stop it.
10038837	10039857	Alright, go kick his ass.
10040317	10041118	Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.
10041818	10042979	Making hearts in your direction.
10043739	10044640	Aw, thank you.
10046401	10047702	I feel bad for your team.
10048962	10052265	Oh my god, you got DarkSakura kind of to care about football.
10052545	10054146	That should make you feel better than anything else.
10054606	10055887	And see, I would have gotten a ring.
10057568	10060349	If we had gone in two weeks and won, I would have gotten a ring.
10061770	10063071	Well, you know what?
10063832	10065032	There's always next year.
10065473	10068314	At DragonCon, I'll get you some onion rings.
10068434	10069035	How's that sound?
10069915	10070576	From the varsity.
10071678	10073021	Locals will understand that.
10073141	10076787	They should launch the puppy out of the cannon for a puppy bowl.
10077288	10077569	No!
10077689	10078590	I'm letting you go, Bobby.
10078630	10079031	Take care.
10079873	10080874	Maybe a ferret instead.
10080894	10081315	Bye!
10084997	10087680	1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
10087720	10090402	Bobby was a little bit longer than we usually have the calls, but he's Bobby.
10090422	10090863	He can do that.
10092584	10095107	Anyhow, also we got Twitter topics coming in.
10095387	10100371	Twitter.com slash OLR and we can read some of those topics here.
10103574	10104175	Let's see.
10105076	10106397	Oh, no, we got more calls coming in.
10106437	10106777	Never mind.
10107077	10107938	Let's take the calls instead.
10108439	10109339	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10109359	10109680	Who's this?
10112276	10115980	Hello, it's Codeman from the Down for Maintenance podcast.
10116120	10118282	How you doing, Codeman from the Down for Maintenance podcast?
10118903	10119704	How you guys doing?
10120304	10121205	You know, alright.
10121305	10123728	I guess there was some big football news today, but you know.
10124088	10124949	I like your picture.
10125049	10125870	It's very army.
10126851	10127872	Yeah, that's my tattoo.
10129354	10130355	What does your tattoo say?
10130515	10132537	I know you didn't call in to talk about that, but I'm asking anyway.
10134138	10137499	Whatever our souls are made of, hers and mine are the same.
10137919	10138660	It's for me and my wife.
10138980	10139100	Aww.
10139120	10141521	That's adorable.
10141881	10142322	Oh, wow.
10142362	10142742	Geez.
10143062	10146824	Well, after the Bobby call and then now this little awe, I kind of feel down.
10147484	10148144	But that was good.
10148224	10148565	Thank you.
10148685	10149225	I appreciate that.
10149265	10151386	Well, we cheered Bobby up, so now you cheer us up.
10151746	10152987	What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
10154228	10158311	Well, you know, that call kind of made me think of, you know, I live in Oklahoma.
10158491	10165656	Our team, our sports ball team, our college team didn't do very well this year either.
10165877	10169940	But we usually do, you know, pretty well.
10170180	10174984	We just didn't show up to any of the games mentally, I guess you would say.
10175864	10176685	Look on the bright side.
10176725	10178787	Your college team, at least their girlfriends are real.
10179787	10180088	True.
10180248	10181108	There you go, right?
10181128	10181769	Yeah.
10184123	10186104	No, I just wanted to call and say hi to you guys.
10188805	10191526	I'm actually getting a chance to call you guys.
10191906	10195608	The baby is asleep and I'm actually getting a chance to call in.
10195668	10197428	So I'm excited about that.
10197728	10202990	Well, I'll bring this up because I'm looking through the Twitter topics for tonight and I noticed you sent us a tweet.
10203351	10204751	And I have to show this to people in studio.
10204791	10206932	You tweeted, me with a power glove.
10208472	10209093	It's so bad.
10209133	10211414	You actually tweeted us a picture of yourself.
10211474	10212654	I'm showing the others in the studio there.
10212974	10215075	A picture of you holding the power glove.
10215315	10217696	And I like this little artsy pose you're doing with it too.
10217936	10220817	It's very like... I really like your scarf.
10221237	10222438	Thank you.
10222698	10223678	You've got a scarf.
10224559	10226860	It's very hipster, but not in a douchebag way.
10227120	10228800	I like it.
10228960	10232622	That was a very drunken night.
10232662	10233722	I don't like to talk about it.
10233922	10234843	Oh, I see.
10234863	10235143	Yeah.
10236365	10237026	and I'll see you next time.
10252726	10256889	Well, they call it a Power Glove for a reason, so... Obviously, yeah.
10257169	10269217	No, I listen to you guys' show, and I just... Just, you know, like John on our podcast, he's from California as well, and it just makes me just so sad.
10269578	10275582	All the stuff that you guys can do in California, and I can't do here in Oklahoma, and it makes me... It just makes me sad.
10275602	10275802	Yeah.
10276615	10278137	However, you have Waffle House, right?
10278898	10284983	We do have Waffle House, although you don't really want to go in there most of the time because some of the plates are a little dirty.
10285144	10289428	But you have Waffle House, and you should be glad for that fact because we don't have Waffle House and we never will.
10289568	10296034	And I was going to say, Oklahoma at least has Dunkin' Donuts, and we're not getting those until apparently 2015 is announced this week.
10296174	10298636	At least we're finally going to get them in SoCal.
10298796	10299998	I miss Waffle House, Rob.
10300518	10301199	Wow.
10301399	10302060	It's not that good.
10302080	10302981	No, yes it is.
10303522	10305984	I want my chocolate chip pancakes extra crispy, please.
10306004	10306345	Thank you.
10306545	10307266	Those are good.
10307386	10308027	Those are very good.
10308067	10308868	What are you wowing?
10308888	10310549	The fact that we don't have Dunkin' Donuts here?
10311090	10311751	Yeah.
10311851	10313373	I figured you probably would.
10313653	10313853	Nope.
10314214	10314414	Nope.
10314574	10314814	It's the...
10315555	10320036	It is like the number one thing when I tell people on the East Coast, like, you know, because I'll go out to visit.
10320056	10322177	I'll go to like New York or even when I was at PAX.
10322477	10324797	I'm like, fuck, yes, we've got to go to Dunkin' Donuts.
10324857	10326298	Oh my God, I haven't had Dunkin' Donuts in forever.
10326318	10326778	We got to go.
10326838	10328778	And like my friends are like, the fuck?
10329078	10329759	Like, really?
10330199	10331139	I'm like, no, you don't understand.
10331179	10331759	I live in California.
10331779	10332579	We don't have Dunkin' Donuts.
10332599	10334520	And they're like, where the fuck do you get donuts?
10334940	10337500	I made Tiara drive me to Dunkin' Donuts in Las Vegas.
10337600	10338361	Yeah, I'm like, they don't.
10339061	10343002	It's Ma and Pop stores or if you can find a Krispy Kreme that didn't go under.
10343202	10343542	That's it.
10344843	10347365	I did grow up with Krispy Kreme.
10347405	10349947	Krispy Kreme is few and far between in Oklahoma.
10350067	10355012	There's a couple of them around where I live, but they're pretty hard to find.
10355252	10357154	Krispy Kreme in Alabama is like Starbucks.
10359013	10359954	Yeah, that's what we have here.
10360034	10361435	Starbucks everywhere.
10363316	10363917	Krispy Kreme.
10364177	10370102	Well, trying to bring it back to video games a little bit, I know you have been playing a little more Forza Horizon lately as well.
10370262	10372764	I know that's something you were talking about on Down for Maintenance.
10372844	10374305	So what are your thoughts on Forza?
10374986	10376547	I love it.
10377368	10383853	The reason why I love it, and I've mentioned this on my podcast, is that, you know, I think the last...
10384752	10385753	Oh, my dryer just went off.
10387513	10394916	The last racing game I played was Cruising USA and Bowling Alley Arcade.
10395497	10400038	And so, I don't know, it kind of brings me back to that kind of racing.
10400579	10402960	It's very arcade-y, and I like that about it.
10403120	10406321	And the fact that you can race against...
10406601	10407282	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10428897	10433279	Well, we're going to try to set a date and time for either this week or next, and we'll tweet about it.
10433359	10438001	We need everybody possible to come join in on the fun, so look out for that, including Loki.
10439121	10439342	Yes.
10439802	10441382	Well, Loki, he's all over it.
10441763	10444184	Dude, he's been on that thing like white on rice, man.
10444204	10444724	It's crazy.
10445004	10445584	Absolutely.
10445804	10446365	Absolutely.
10446605	10448766	I kind of took a break, though, to make more details.
10448966	10454508	In fact, I'm making a, spoiler, a sticker for the back of my car that says, How am I driving?
10454528	10454988	1-877-GAME-RLR.
10455008	10455128	Jesus.
10458226	10459766	Nice advertisement.
10459867	10461787	It's all over the car.
10461927	10463508	You are so dumb, but I love it.
10463608	10463868	All right.
10464588	10470770	Codeman, tell the folks how they can tune into your podcast, which you do Google Hangouts and stuff now too, right?
10471350	10471570	Yeah.
10471830	10472830	You're playing with your format?
10472870	10474371	Are you going to switch to video or what?
10475311	10478654	We kind of do it back and forth every once in a while.
10478674	10481616	We just kind of dabble in audio and video.
10481677	10487461	But yeah, you can find us on YouTube at youtube.com backslash the DFM podcast.
10487481	10490584	And you can follow us on Twitter at the DFM podcast.
10491405	10496329	Then, of course, you can find us on iTunes at the DFM podcast.
10501113	10502534	And yeah, we should be on there.
10502554	10508399	We're on our eighth episode, actually the next episode, which you, DarkSakura, are going to guest on.
10508680	10508960	Yes.
10510281	10513344	If you remember, I haven't sent you a reminder, so I don't know.
10514113	10516873	Now, I put it on my phone, so I've got everything.
10516894	10518454	I have an alarm going off.
10518854	10519974	That's where you've got to be, is in the phone.
10520034	10523635	I've made no plans for that day.
10523915	10534097	I wanted to get all three of you guys on all at once, but I knew that with all kinds of different time schedules and stuff like that, I probably couldn't manage that.
10535157	10537397	We will have all three of you on now, so that's awesome.
10537997	10540818	Well, thank you very much for having us on and expertly plugged.
10540938	10542138	Appreciate it, and best of luck with your show.
10542930	10543911	Thank you very much, Rob.
10565794	10566595	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10594951	10595352	Let's see.
10595792	10597273	Something he saw at MagFest.
10597613	10601895	An original Atari 2600 game with the classic cartridge, box, and manual.
10602475	10604096	CGE Adventures.
10604396	10607738	It is amazing how people are still making stuff for the Atari 2600 even today.
10608879	10614182	You can get all kinds of repros of stuff that were prototypes.
10614522	10615102	Repro prototypes.
10615122	10616203	That's how we have a Millipede for $5,200.
10617470	10626053	Even some of those flashback consoles had some of the design challenge winners.
10626933	10633735	Funny enough, I remember Bobby earlier was talking about Howard Scott Warshaw at the Expo in Philly.
10634115	10638577	Saboteur, his last game, I think was one of those games that showed up in a flashback console at some point.
10639377	10640117	It's kind of interesting.
10640397	10641478	You do still see those show up.
10643278	10644158	in one place or another.
10644198	10647360	Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10648040	10649240	Tiger Claw sending us some tweets.
10649760	10653442	More League of Legends players banned for toxic behavior.
10655302	10659704	Apparently, League of Legends is not going to put up with that shit anymore where people are harassing other people.
10661265	10666106	Banned two prominent esports players for their toxic behavior in-game.
10667267	10670828	The peak harassment score placed the account among the worst players
10672089	10674331	0.06 of all European accounts this month.
10674391	10675792	That was InVision's account.
10676152	10677073	He was banned.
10677674	10678274	You know what?
10678874	10679615	Good for them.
10681136	10683058	Be accountable for your attitude in games.
10683358	10685120	People want to be so anonymous.
10685220	10689163	I've been doing a lot of PvP and WoW this week, and I'll talk about this on Horde House, plug, plug, later.
10689643	10694067	But just some toxic fucking attitudes in these games that ruin it for everybody.
10694887	10700432	So I'm really glad to hear that League of Legends is taking some drastic moves to eliminate that shit.
10702378	10709220	Also a tweet from Tiger Claw saying, games destigmatize violence, says a Connecticut governor.
10709840	10711501	Well, that's probably all that needs to be said about that.
10711521	10714562	Another politician putting their big ass foot in the conversation.
10717203	10727606	Lastly here, RawSteelUT, in light of how the media readily brought Manti Teo's dead girlfriend story, have any of you been fooled by fake stories?
10728046	10729647	Oh, I'm sure we have here on OLR.
10729867	10731048	I mean, it happens.
10731089	10733732	There'll be an article that spreads like wildfire.
10734232	10736295	We don't like to think we're breaking the news.
10736735	10740439	Once in a while, we get a little tip, but we try not to make a big deal out of it.
10740520	10743944	Sometimes we talk about a game called Disney Infinity.
10744024	10747007	It's a hidden secret for our listeners, and that's the way we want it to be.
10747888	10748829	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
10768228	10778431	Hey, I'm sure back in the day when we were all younger, I'm sure some of us fell for the old EGM magazine pranks like that Shang Long was actually a character in Street Fighter.
10778551	10778751	Nope.
10778851	10780631	Or Ermac was actually in Mortal Kombat.
10780892	10781052	No.
10781152	10781532	Oh, sure.
10781612	10782152	Say that now.
10783038	10787580	Well, I also worked in an arcade for a while, too, and could actually check some of these machines myself.
10788160	10792622	So you knew at that age how to go into the chips and actually look in the programming?
10792962	10793983	Yep, I totally knew that.
10794043	10798845	No, Rob, what I knew is that usually on April 1st, there are going to be pranks done.
10799085	10800906	I don't believe a damn thing on April 1st.
10800926	10801967	They were in magazines.
10802007	10802987	Or in April editions.
10803047	10804027	And we were younger.
10804168	10805768	But they were the April editions.
10805888	10807229	Yeah, but Rob, I'm special.
10807549	10808529	You guys are no fun at all.
10808550	10809430	I'm special.
10810862	10812143	No fun zone, everybody.
10812163	10813124	That's why nobody's calling in.
10813164	10814125	They know it's a no fun zone.
10814685	10815026	All right.
10816307	10817728	Last minute stories, Loki.
10817948	10818309	Anything?
10818729	10825595	Blockbuster UK has closed 160 of its stores because they're in administration right now.
10826396	10831420	Kind of a repeat of what they did over here in the U.S.
10833562	10835924	There's a pretty cool THQ sale going on right now on Amazon.
10836084	10836645	You can get a...
10837445	10839165	A bunch of games for $25.
10839625	10840086	19 games.
10840886	10845787	Most of which you probably have by now through the Humble Bundle or all the other Amazon sales that they've done.
10846027	10847227	I know I have a lot of these games.
10847927	10850667	Actually, I think I have all these games right now.
10851688	10852728	Except for Nexuiz.
10852748	10855288	I don't have Nexuiz, but I'm not buying this for that.
10856369	10858149	MX versus ATV Reflex, I don't have that either.
10860049	10864350	Um... Sigh.
10865461	10867383	Starbreeze Storm That is it.
10885987	10886508	That's it.
10887048	10892654	Well, I guess that's going to do it for OLR tonight.
10892694	10893655	No more calls coming in.
10894036	10894576	That's all right.
10895217	10897359	Everybody's too depressed about football.
10897479	10897860	I get it.
10897960	10898320	It's cool.
10898500	10904487	Oh, and the killer is dead is pretty awesome looking, which I mentioned about a year ago.
10905987	10915490	but it's the new Suda51 game and it kind of has that whole Killer7 vibe to it where it's all kind of cel-shaded and stuff but very bloody.
10915710	10920831	Remember, you know, with some of the games that they did after Killer7, you know, it was kind of toned down.
10920871	10925433	They had the whole No More Heroes had kind of money spewing out of them instead of blood.
10925873	10926673	Well, this is definitely blood.
10927053	10929234	Lots of blood and a guy with a big drill on his arm.
10930954	10931874	That sounds like my kind of game.
10932114	10933015	He's Mr. Driller now.
10933515	10934455	Mr. Driller.
10936129	10938150	Alright, well, that brings us to a close.
10938190	10943054	Another episode of Orange Lounge Radio, but not until we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10944255	10947717	First off, of course, we always like to say thank you for downloading and checking out our show.
10948418	10949278	It is a free show.
10949819	10957004	We haven't played a commercial for the same game 20 weeks in a row to try and, you know, we just, we pay a little bit out of pocket because it's our hobby, whatever.
10957524	10960286	And actually, I've got to say, I do want to tip my hat
10960726	10965670	People have been very kind in a pay it forward kind of way where like, you know, we've just had some nice things donated.
10965690	10969374	Like Brad from PodCulture, all these mics you see were donated.
10969434	10974398	And we do get, you know, like Grandpa from Horde House gave a lot of money to VOG on our 10th anniversary.
10974678	10975980	Helped Kristen years ago.
10976720	10977621	It helped out a big way.
10977801	10979883	The soundboard, that's how we got to Pat.
10980103	10995454	so you know pay it forward is kind of the motto here not to you know bring up a cheesy movie from years ago but if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio just spread the word tell a friend or two about the show and help us spread the word about the show and that's all we ask thank you to everyone who bought me games
10995765	10997466	And thank you to everybody who listened tonight.
10997846	11001328	Whether it be live or on the podcast, you guys rock.
11001428	11002749	And thank you, Greg Proops.
11004070	11006371	And I still have Steam games to give away at some point.
11006971	11009053	I just haven't figured out how to do that yet.
11010493	11013055	And also, somewhere buried over there, I think I see it.
11013875	11016237	We still have the Migaran album to give away for something.
11016277	11018378	Yeah, we need to just do like a big closeout around here.
11018874	11021595	All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.
11021975	11023596	Jamie, you shut off the iPad.
11023616	11024096	You're good to go.
11024116	11025156	What's your final thought tonight?
11025256	11026817	It's hard to do a show on an iPad.
11028818	11029858	Loki, your final thought tonight?
11030899	11033099	I have a new CD of music to listen to.
11033219	11042863	Thanks for all the inspiration, I guess, Dubstep Arena channel on Forza Horizon.
11043924	11045864	Although most of it's not really Dubstep.
11045904	11046945	It's just Electronica.
11048979	11052560	My final thought for the night is why can Horde never win Isle of Conquest?
11052760	11053901	Stop being terrible, Horde.
11053961	11054401	I hate you.
11055261	11057562	All right, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
11057582	11059842	Thank you guys very much for tuning in and supporting the show.
11060242	11062043	We'll be back to do it all again next week.
