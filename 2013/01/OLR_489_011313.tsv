13946	24014	Tonight, January 13, 2013, a new gaming handheld debuts at CES, Pokemon X and Y is announced, and further details emerge on the Steam Box.
31618	36721	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36801	43444	It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 489 for this January the 13th of 2013.
45506	57072	I'm sure there's like a numberology thing in there, a numerology thing in there, because all I ever see on the Twitters is like, happy 1212 or happy 1313, and everybody's looking for the number Zs.
57452	59372	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
88099	88360	All right.
88400	90123	My name, by the way, is Rob Roberts, of course.
90243	92707	We are joined by all of you in our chat room.
93206	98029	Live, as we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
98589	102972	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern on Sundays right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
103532	110596	And a big thank you to everybody at the Voice of Geeks Network and all you listening live in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com for tuning in tonight.
110636	114538	We'll be talking about games and CES and all that fun stuff here in a little bit.
114879	117180	But of course, we have to introduce the third host on our program.
117220	118781	Say hello to Tech Master, Loki.
119341	119541	Hi.
119841	120442	How are you, Loki?
120782	121222	I'm fine.
121803	126086	So, a trip to Disneyland may be in your future, based on what we were talking about before the show.
126186	127867	Well, not that I want to go, but my wife wants to.
127887	129108	How can you not want to go to Disneyland?
129128	130690	How about she go with me and Dan?
130970	131450	There you go.
132011	133312	I'm fine with that.
134052	135873	No, honestly, I'm seriously fine with that.
135893	144680	I told her that she could go with other people, but, you know, she wants to go to Disneyland, and I, personally, I don't want to go to Disneyland, just because I don't really...
146221	170363	most of the times I go I have like this anxiety about going on roller coasters although one time I got over that and then it came back so I don't understand it like one time I really loved roller coasters what is with the like macho men I know in my life and they're like they're they're polarizing fear of roller coasters no it's it's a weird irrational thing it's not that like I think anything's gonna happen it's just my body reacts to it like that and even stupid shit like
171023	171444	Thanks for watching!
187132	193575	What happens when the wife says you need to go on California Screamin'?
194355	195536	What are you afraid is going to happen?
196176	197477	Do you cry?
197777	198637	No, I don't cry.
198657	199858	I don't want to go.
199918	202079	It's like I can't take the adrenaline rush or something.
202099	202619	It's really weird.
203019	203319	I don't know.
209366	212288	The only thing that gets me on screaming is that first hill, and then I'm fine.
212488	216512	It's not even like... It's Neil Patrick Harris' soothing voice that helps me out every time.
216532	219434	I know that nothing is going to happen to me or anything.
219834	223737	It's not like I'm afraid that the roller coaster is going to fall off the tracks or something like that.
224097	225258	I know nothing is going to happen to me.
225278	226399	I know I'm perfectly safe in there.
226419	228561	It's just for some reason that I can't do it.
228601	230002	And there's one time I went.
230102	233144	It was one of the last times I went with my family, and...
234125	242735	We actually, it was kind of like that, and I was just like, oh, I don't want to do this, and we went on Thunder Mountain Railroad, and I was like, that wasn't so bad, and we kept going on it over and over and over again.
242815	246079	It was actually before, like, it was before, you know, we killed the people on there, but...
249202	251803	Um, but, you know, it was it was actually pretty fun.
251823	253044	Let's not talk about that, okay?
253164	255525	Big Thunder is awesome if you go at night and sit in the back.
255625	256705	No, it was pretty fun.
257025	258706	I mean, and I thought, okay, cool.
258726	260587	You know, I was pretty comfortable with it last time.
260607	262187	You know, this should be no big deal this time.
262668	268890	So, you know, went there again and, you know, last time we went, and I was like, why am I afraid of this stuff again?
268930	269470	I don't understand.
269510	271611	This doesn't make any sense, but whatever.
271851	273932	It's not that you think you're gonna die on the ride.
274112	276753	No, it's just like it's not even that I feel like I'm gonna get sick.
276813	278574	It's just I have this, like, it's almost like a
278894	279374	Josh, Josh, Josh, Josh
300588	308210	Not even besides the rollercoaster stuff because I'm fine with just sitting out while she goes on rollercoasters and that kind of thing and just going on parts of the Caribbean and that kind of crap.
308670	313691	But I don't want to take Josh on a plane because that is going to be a pain in the ass.
313711	315432	Why the hell would you fly anyway?
315732	316332	You could drive.
316932	318252	The drive is easy.
319052	323153	We're not going to drive because she has to go to the bathroom all the time.
323193	325974	Well, so do I. Dan puts up with it.
326974	327755	I'm fine with that.
327795	329735	I'm fine with stopping a million times, but
331229	331489	I don't know.
331569	333291	And then I also have to harass him for coffee.
350124	377410	and I got to actually ask a question it was supposed to be on TV now it got cut but it's like a deleted scene you can see online and yes that's me in it if you if you google it on Logos site or whatever you can see the RuPaul's Drag Race season 4 deleted scene and I'm the first guy that asked a question well I was so nervous before that I literally thought I was gonna barf and I had to go to the bathroom right before that happened in fact I like asked one of the handlers I'm like I gotta go to the bathroom before it was like and like I could feel like my heart beating but then all of a sudden when it's like cameras on I'm just like I'll bet her
378110	385555	and I just, like, it just... I think that the only thing that will get me over going on roller coasters is just going on roller coasters.
385815	387516	That's really, you know, the only thing you can do.
387897	389398	Showtime is nothing for you, Rob.
389838	391339	He said to sensitize yourself to it.
391659	394881	Let me introduce that phantom voice you just heard who hadn't been introduced.
394901	396802	They're gonna think, like, who the hell was that guy?
396822	398964	That disconnected, deep radio voice.
399304	405068	Well, you hopefully will recognize that disconnected, deep voice as a voice you hear in the intro to the show every night.
406309	407850	Or the pre-intro, if you will.
408291	411974	Say hello, everybody, to Jason, or VXJasonXVYZ.
412334	413495	It's me, again.
413515	417678	I've been doing this for almost a year, and that's crazy to me to think about.
417838	419459	Here you are, visiting yet again from Colorado.
419479	419839	Yet again.
419940	423202	But it helps that you come out to San Francisco a lot for work, and we happen to be on the way.
423262	426705	And then drive two hours and kill the better part of my Sunday.
426725	428526	But hey, it's all for a good cause, so no complaints here.
428686	430327	Are we allowed to talk about your job here on the show?
430447	433168	Yeah, when I had you talk about the game off.
433748	438290	I can't remember because sometimes we get people in here who are in the game industry so we can't say where they work.
439031	440191	No, we all know about him.
440211	440832	But it's the big N, Rob!
444734	445935	But anyway, you work at GitHub.
446215	446455	I do.
446735	449938	So you guys have your Git-togethers in San Francisco, right?
451419	454862	I wonder if that came up as a possible name for these big collections.
455142	457884	They bring the whole company because, you know, Git together.
457904	459005	I'll give you that one on the house.
459025	459685	We appreciate that.
459705	460606	I'll run it by legal.
462227	463107	Make sure that it's still free.
464208	467869	GitHub brings everybody in for twice yearly summits, January and August.
469089	469909	And so I've been out there.
470209	472490	I've been out here, you know, the first time was when I started working here.
472530	474030	The second time was the summit in August.
474830	477771	We had a little get together in November for my team specifically.
478191	481232	And now this is the second summit that I've been a part of with a company.
481352	484053	It's the company's fifth, I believe.
484653	485453	And it's my second.
485713	487293	And it starts tomorrow.
487574	489214	And I'm kind of excited.
489654	496761	Now, real quick, I sort of have a vague idea what GitHub is, but I kind of feel like I'm not nerdy enough to get GitHub.
497261	505429	So what is GitHub, and where could a beginner nerd like me, what could I profit from visiting GitHub and making it a part of my daily routine?
505589	506749	Oh man, you threw me a curveball.
506789	511371	So the point of GitHub is to foster collaboration and development.
511451	519874	The point is to make it easy to collaborate with fellow programmers, fellow developers, designers, what have you, and get things done mutually beneficially.
521214	526916	Our slogan is something close to making collaborative development easier than... I already screwed it up.
527776	529817	Collaborative development easier than by yourself.
531337	536159	Very much the open source movement, but development in large part is better with multiple people, period.
537039	540601	You yourself personally, I'm not sure that I have a specific use case for.
540641	543261	I mean, we're branching out into documentation.
543361	553785	One of the more interesting stories about GitHub last year was Obama for America had their whole back-end system, their CMS and everything on GitHub.
554566	573507	and they were actually doing a tour so they dropped by the office they were pretty cool people like writers, designers, developers there is a very obvious use case for them because it's watching your works change through time and if something goes wrong you can go back to it it's change control, it's revision control you specifically, I'm not sure
573827	579612	In my day job, I work a lot with, I've been getting more and more, just dabbing my big toe into the Visual Basic macros.
579652	580453	Is that something you guys support?
580493	581234	Yeah, absolutely.
581834	586218	The source behind those macros, you can put on there, change them when you need to of something.
586358	588219	If you find that a change... Now you kind of sold me.
588279	588620	There you go.
588640	590722	You kind of sold me because actually, I had to learn.
590802	592343	Everything I learned about Visual Basic, I Googled.
592563	593044	Thanks for watching!
609130	637714	Humongous Source Control Warehouse Source Control Database I don't think about your day job, I just think about this when I hear about you That's right You could just use Google because Google would probably source GitHub as one of the responses for that Fair enough I do try to keep my day job and night job separate because I don't want the day job knowing I have this gig where I say fuck a lot, it's a little unprofessional and so forth That trainer has such a potty mouth We're going to use it in class Mr. Rob is psycho
638494	640796	And Bruce Wayne never goes to any of his functions as Batman.
640856	642057	I mean, it just doesn't make any sense.
642097	643118	It's kind of like that.
643158	645920	That's a very, very good... And you're the Joker.
646340	646720	No, no.
647581	649322	I can imagine what a board meeting would go like now.
650083	652445	So, Mr. Wayne, have you looked at the financial report?
654847	656168	I did not look at the financial report!
657208	658769	Mr. Wayne, are you okay?
659650	660431	I am feeling fine.
663368	665269	Also say hello joining us in studio.
665669	666510	Say hello everybody.
668150	669071	That is my Batman voice.
672293	672853	I am Batman.
675254	679096	Say hello everybody to Rai Chan who is visiting us here in studio as well tonight.
679116	679656	How are you doing?
679916	680597	Not too bad.
682778	683518	I am psycho.
683598	685299	You're like looking at me like I'm psycho.
685359	688941	The only thing I have in my head after you use that voice is the Snickers commercial.
691374	694998	I just gotta love those old Snickers commercials, they were great So what are you doing here?
695058	704829	You don't work out here, you're just here for fun I actually got, managed to get a week off You gotta put that mic real close to your mouth, it's not that sensitive I managed to actually get a week off work, so Hooray!
704930	705510	Hooray!
705590	708654	Vacation After retail holidays, I am so happy to be out
709393	711015	Oh my gosh, I can only imagine.
711595	715258	I remember from the last time you were here, it wasn't like a crafting type of store or something?
716459	718560	I work in the printing center in an office, Max.
718640	720402	Oh, okay.
720462	724265	No, it was your other friend that worked in the crafting store, which the gal...
724805	729248	That you brought that one show, she was pretty cool, I never met her before Rachel?
729548	740654	Yeah, her mom runs Babettas You gotta bring her back someday I tried to But for now we got Rye, I love Rye too, so it works out So Rye, what happens in San Francisco?
740694	742215	What kind of touristy things have you been doing over there?
743836	749719	I just got in yesterday morning You haven't had time to do shit Anything on the agenda?
751730	759004	dinner dinner dinner and more dinner and concerts and music and dinner and relaxing and sleeping and a little bit of Diablo
760006	761687	You are a Diablo 3 nut.
762167	763047	I am.
763167	767868	I say that in the most... And it's interesting to me because I really tried to get on the Diablo 3 bandwagon.
767889	771810	You and I even played some games together, and I'm just like, it's not WoW.
772030	775671	I can't... Or it's not Diablo 2 to me.
775991	779292	But Diablo 3, it's working for you, and I say, great, great.
779732	780252	Good for you.
781553	783914	It's okay that I may not like the same game that you like.
784294	786254	What is it about Diablo 3 that keeps you coming back, though?
786274	787415	Because you're like level 60...
788935	790037	I have a Paragon.
811155	815058	Do not, do not go there.
815138	816919	Can we get through one freaking show?
817200	817460	No.
817540	818481	Without you going there.
818581	819241	All right, anyway.
822304	825106	Jamie's sitting in the back going, well, if you have seven of them, why don't you try a renegade?
825126	826527	You should do the renegade to get the full story.
826547	827588	Why do I have to be Paragon?
827608	828609	Hey, I don't play renegade.
828669	829669	Have you ever heard of Diablo 3?
830870	835414	Rob, who was another person in this room that signed the damn blood pact?
836520	838581	1.0.7, which the opening notes just came out the other day for.
857048	858830	Is that something you're interested in or you're like, meh?
859250	859811	Meh.
859971	862113	Okay, a dismissive hand wave, that's fine.
862133	869360	Yeah, but some of the other stuff coming in, the MP experience boost and all that kind of stuff is going to be fun.
869713	870473	More XP.
870733	871053	Love it.
871253	872214	Yay, more XP.
873134	876515	Did you fool around with Torchlight 2 at all?
876895	878015	I take offense to that.
878855	879075	What?
880195	881416	It's a video game.
881796	883936	I talk about cheating on WoW all the time.
884496	886737	Sometimes you have a relationship with a video game.
886817	887257	I jest.
887597	891418	Have you heard about the story that's floating around the game blogs this week?
891858	892499	Thanks, Jamie.
893040	894221	What the fuck's so funny?
894361	899007	I just... No, no, Macho Man in chat said, new class for Diablo, dork.
900008	900749	Shut up, Macho Man.
901209	901449	All right.
901469	902611	Ooh, burn.
902791	904933	Macho Man, I would be all over that class.
905254	905914	Ooh, yeah.
908849	909930	Snap into a Batman!
910851	919659	Alright, um... That's like half Macho Man, half like, I don't know, the Penguin from like the 1960s Batman or something?
919679	920920	I don't really know what that is.
921120	924944	Call it 20 minutes into the show, we've lost it.
926445	928447	That's a good idea there, Loki.
928487	928587	Um...
932116	933477	We should just do a show like that.
933517	935457	I could just sit here and do Batman Villains Live.
935477	936918	Do you even want to talk games tonight?
936958	939839	The April 1st Orange Lounge.
939859	940900	The 500th episode.
940920	941560	Well, not the 500th.
941620	943101	Oh, yeah, it is the 500th episode.
943121	944441	Yeah, I remember we talked about this last week.
944461	944921	God damn it.
946162	951044	Well, there goes my plan to do it as all Batman villains because that would be kind of funny.
952445	953345	We'll pick another show to do that.
953365	953745	I'm sorry.
953825	956787	I totally could not make it through an entire show doing the Eartha Kitt Catwoman.
960670	961250	Where was I?
961511	963171	Torchlight 2, Diablo 3.
963411	966853	Yeah, you were starting to ask me about Torchlight.
967073	974997	Yes, I was, but I was also going on the tangent about that story that's around the game blogs about how people can spend like 250 hours or like 1,000 hours with one video game.
975017	976138	I don't know what the fuck they're talking about.
976198	984822	I mean, I'm talking about like, what was it, like Romancing Saga 3 or like just these interesting video games that people are spending tons of time with and it's just about...
985482	990704	You just obsess over that one game and exploring every little nook and cranny of it.
990804	991864	I don't know what they're talking about.
991884	994545	This is the wrong crowd to talk about that story.
994605	998947	I have no idea because nobody sits around trying to get the fly cam to work on Mass Effect 2 for hours.
999067	1001567	I never played that many hours in Grand Theft Auto 4.
1002128	1003448	Why don't you let Raichan talk?
1006870	1010994	My monk is sitting at about 655 hours last I've checked.
1011515	1012656	That's just my monk.
1013277	1016780	Is there a command in Diablo 3 like slash played?
1018035	1018495	Thanks for watching!
1044266	1048712	You can see my entire group of characters and how many hours have been spent.
1049132	1054298	The only thing is that since I have two monks and two demon hunters it only shows you the top of the two.
1055180	1059425	Do you play with strangers ever or do you only play exclusively with friends?
1059805	1088421	um it depends on who's on right now I try to play with friends as much as possible and it's kind of hard because I have so many on there so limit only four players per game but um if other people aren't on then we tend to join in public games right now what's your best dumbass story from playing with strangers I think she has a unfortunately it's not it's not a random person but I think one of her recent friends has the best story even better so far
1089901	1093002	No, you're not getting the wife and Skype?
1093723	1094783	Oh, shit, really?
1095163	1106728	No names, no names, protect the innocent, but just the whole, the long and the short, the long... We're in Gotham City, we need to bring these people to justice, so we need to hear the story.
1107148	1115551	What it amounts to is that Ryan is usually with a group of however many people are actually online on either some kind of a Ventrilo Skype, whatever conference call,
1116031	1128679	and she was telling me about this story about one of the gamers was playing and his Skype call was, he didn't have headphones on, it was playing, and his wife hears another woman's voice.
1129259	1138665	And so the two of them are just broadcasting their fight to the whole rest of the party, just flipping their shit because there's some other woman's voice coming from the computer.
1138905	1144307	Yeah, just an, oh my god, you told me that if you were ever going to be talking to another woman, you would tell me about it.
1144527	1146188	Oh, it was horrible.
1146228	1147989	I think that's the best story she's told me so far.
1149469	1153391	Really, woman needs to get over her insecurity issues.
1153571	1156712	Yeah, listening to them scream and cuss at each other was not a good thing.
1157327	1158348	and I'll see you next time.
1182811	1183772	Oh, Nick, please not so quick.
1183792	1184032	All right.
1184813	1186414	Well, welcome to the show, Rye.
1186634	1187935	Hope things go well for you here.
1187955	1188616	It's good to be back.
1188716	1191798	Hope we get some more embarrassing stories throughout the night, especially about other people.
1191838	1192419	Those are the best kind.
1193407	1197008	Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1197088	1204289	Maybe it's more Diablo 3, or in DarkSakura's case, I can't possibly imagine what she's been playing, but I'm going to go over there and ask anyway.
1204329	1205430	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1205450	1207390	I've been playing a healthy dose of Kiss My Ass.
1208090	1208290	No.
1210671	1213631	I played some well, because I... I don't kick!
1214351	1215432	I don't kiss ass, I kick it!
1216752	1217372	Okay.
1217932	1220473	Someone get that man a lozenge.
1223124	1234612	So, yeah, I've played some WoW, which Rob can vouch for since I chatted with him on WoW and remade my Jane Shepard because I hate playing monks, actually.
1234732	1235373	I don't like monks.
1236814	1237194	Not much.
1239035	1242358	Actually, I really hate the animations for monks on Blood Elves.
1242378	1243078	They're just too skinny.
1245100	1261262	I also I played Mass Effect 3 and Mass Effect 2 and I've actually my time in Mass Effect 2 has been nothing but trying to get Flycam to work which I have it working in everything except conversation modes although I did figure out the debug cam but it's still kind of a pain in the ass
1261602	1267127	I found out, though, interesting rendering issues that happen in the game when you try to enable the debug cam.
1269349	1272191	I'm also playing Limbo, which I'm really not very good at.
1272311	1273772	I started playing that on the train again.
1273953	1276535	I wanted to kind of get through some of those puzzles that I hadn't done in a while.
1276555	1279397	I can't get past the damn block floating in the water.
1281439	1283360	Like, do you crawl over it and then make it float?
1283841	1287304	You use the block to get a rope that's slightly hidden behind a tree.
1287984	1288645	The fuck?
1288685	1289666	How am I supposed to see that?
1290325	1300890	You grab the block, you pull it back, there's a little rope, and you can scale the trees on their edges, and there's a more or less broken branch that you push over, it falls to the ground, you push it over the water, you get across.
1301210	1303371	You're at the very baby steps of that game, oh wow.
1303411	1305693	I know, but I get pissed off.
1306133	1308574	And then I was like, well fuck this noise, I'm not gonna play anymore.
1308614	1318659	That's a lot of the trick, that's like the, I don't want to call it the gimmick of the game, because the design in general is really fantastic, and it doesn't abuse that, but that's very much the gimmick of the game, is that the
1319279	1342891	the scaling and the directional because you know it has the whole background foreground covers that it'll kind of do the foreground to trick your eyes when you're going forward and reset you from what's actually in the playable game space but yeah grab the block bring it back look for a tiny little rope dangling from the tree scale up you'll find a break in a tree action push okay I'm doing that tonight you know
1344632	1347454	Now, I wonder though if it's one of the games they've enabled with Linux yet.
1348134	1351696	I have not been keeping any look at that library whatsoever.
1352516	1352856	Anybody?
1352996	1353316	Linux?
1353617	1353997	Limbo?
1354877	1359119	I mean, it is Mac compatible, so hopefully it's easy enough to bring to the whole saga.
1359159	1362181	I just don't think it would be too hard for my netbook to handle the game.
1362609	1364952	I love monochromatic stuff and then I've actually started drawing again
1379711	1380731	Yay, drawing!
1398516	1404239	So, I found out the hard way that the pressure sensitivity in my tablet went out.
1405399	1410862	So, I actually took out paper and pencil and started drawing one of my FemShops.
1411442	1412763	Just drawing.
1413643	1415284	And I managed to draw something.
1415384	1417685	I was in a lot of pain when I was done, but I drew something.
1418065	1420066	And that's related to video games because of Garrus.
1421847	1422547	Okay, FemShop.
1422788	1423708	Oh my god, Robb.
1424898	1427521	Truffle Mania has landed on the Orange Lounge radio table.
1427561	1432025	Hello, my name is Jamie, and I like to do drawings.
1433487	1434107	You know what's funny?
1434368	1434568	What?
1435729	1439353	I spent two hours watching episodes of Simon and the Land of Chalk Drawings.
1443717	1448182	Which, have you ever seen what that skit came from, Simon and the Land of Chalk Drawings?
1449691	1451594	Wait, the... What it's based on?
1452234	1454817	The one that was on Saturday Night Live that Mike Myers did?
1454958	1455398	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1455598	1460624	Yeah, I grew up watching Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings and I thought no one else had heard of it until I found out another friend of mine had.
1461676	1464440	I played lots of Skyrim because I was working on getting the PC version.
1464760	1468245	Well, I got the PC version working, of course, but I loaded on about
1482511	1509246	I think I have 97 mods running right now and the whole point was I wanted to add a bunch of stuff to the game so that it would seem not necessarily new but like I would forget what mods I put on there so I wouldn't know if like hey I just haven't run across this yet or hey this is something new so I did that and my character is really overpowered and stuff but it's kind of fun and of course you know had to mess with everything
1510487	1510967	Wait, what?
1510988	1512309	It's a bear that plays Miserilou.
1533866	1534647	Thanks for watching!
1556208	1561853	And if you are interested in broadcasting on the OLR broadcast channel, I can give you all that information and the software.
1561873	1562334	Software's free.
1562694	1563014	Okay.
1563094	1563434	So, yeah.
1563755	1564335	That might be fun.
1564395	1565196	Not breaking any rules.
1565676	1566357	It's all good.
1567178	1573783	So I've been playing a lot of that and played a little bit of... Well, actually played quite a bit of Borderlands 2 this week.
1573863	1577866	Finished the single-player campaign and...
1580524	1582046	Yeah, we cheated.
1582186	1586730	But that's alright, though, because it's a lot more fun when we have really overpowered guns.
1588091	1588872	A lot more fun.
1589893	1593657	So we did that, and what else?
1593677	1597460	Do you own Borderlands on both the 360 and the PC?
1598241	1600263	I have Borderlands 1 on PC and 360.
1600623	1602065	I have Borderlands 2 only on 360.
1602185	1602325	Okay.
1602385	1602465	Okay.
1605754	1612463	I have Borderlands 1 on PlayStation 3 and PC, but that's because PS3 did the whole free with PlayStation Plus, and I was like, what the hell, why not?
1612783	1616208	Nuts to lack of cross-platform multiplayer, as always.
1617760	1642061	and then today I tried playing Forza Horizon although I see I was going to play because I have this Microsoft racing wheel and I've been meaning to try that out so the first thing I started trying to use the right racing wheel and I realized oh I need the AC adapter plugged in there because you have to have a battery pack and an AC adapter for the damn thing to work which is really ridiculous and
1642481	1667554	so I did that and then when I tried syncing the um racing wheel with the 360 I broke the um well I temporarily broke the sync button on the racing wheel so I had to take the whole thing apart to fix that so I got that fixed finally uh with like five minutes left before I had to leave um I got to play with the steering wheel and I realized I don't like the steering wheel it
1668014	1668615	and DarkSakura.
1689269	1694231	So yeah, I'm probably not going to play with that because it's kind of a pain in the ass to set all that up.
1694311	1699914	But I wanted to have used it for something because it was going to be used on the arcade cabinet.
1699934	1702495	I just haven't gotten around to doing anything with it.
1702615	1705977	So I just kind of like, hey, you know, I have this thing.
1705997	1708218	I'm going to try it out and see if it's any good.
1708238	1709378	And it's all right.
1709458	1711599	But controller is probably going to be the way I go with that.
1712360	1714701	And then what else did I play?
1715461	1716462	I played a bit of...
1719119	1732144	Modern Warfare 3 I think we played about a day of that and that was alright I've been trying to play a lot more stuff on my Steam account I've been downloading things Make use out of it, good man
1733957	1734497	All right.
1734897	1735298	Anything else?
1736818	1737418	That's it, yeah.
1737838	1741340	Then let us go over to, I guess I'll go and then our guests can go.
1742340	1746281	As far as my gaming week, honestly, not a whole lot of new stuff.
1746401	1748022	This is kind of a time to catch up.
1748082	1756185	And to be fair, I've been playing a lot of WoW because I'm trying to gear up a character so that she's ready to raid because we're having some changes in our raiding roster.
1756505	1757246	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1784564	1786005	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1807317	1812781	The 3D kind of lends itself very well to that whole thing, but if you like retro games, I'm sure Mutant Buds is something that's right up your alley.
1813021	1814862	And there's the demo, so go check it out for 30 plays.
1817694	1818054	and DarkSakura.
1838983	1841765	And so I was asking questions about, can you send Pokemon back and forth?
1842085	1846848	Because the new game looks like it fixes a lot of the problems I've had with the older games.
1846908	1853772	And the older games, I'm like, they don't look any fucking different than they did in the original black and white Game Boy.
1853892	1858375	Like, yeah, they're in color and there's extra things, but they've changed very little.
1858395	1862998	First rule of Nintendo development, don't change anything unless you really have to.
1863238	1865399	But this new one looks really...
1866500	1868622	Like, they have, like, totally redone it.
1868762	1870383	So I'm very excited about that.
1870423	1871844	We'll talk more about the reboots later.
1872124	1873265	Or I shouldn't say reboot.
1873665	1874546	How it's not a reboot.
1874566	1875246	We'll talk about that later.
1876887	1884853	But then it got me to thinking, I'm like, well, I kind of want to be able to, like, be really cool and have, like, Pokemon from the old games that I can transfer into the new games.
1884933	1885614	Because I guess...
1886434	1894840	Every Pokemon game has to have the coding and the programming for every single stinking Pokemon before it because you transfer from one game to the other.
1894880	1905928	I guess even the newest Black 2, White 2 have the classic Pokemon Red and Blue characters in them because it is possible to have like a... What's a great Pokemon from the Red and Blue era?
1905988	1906609	Let's say Jinx.
1907029	1909131	To have a Jinx... Porygon!
1909251	1911753	Like, traitor all the way up.
1912353	1912914	It's possible.
1913515	1916461	So I'm kind of like, well, maybe I should just make use of the Pokemon games I have.
1916761	1922752	I played for 30 minutes and I was like, I don't know if I'm going to be able to do this for 40 hours or however long it takes to play a game, but we'll see.
1923035	1924216	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1949773	1951856	And now DS and Up are all network-based.
1951876	1953098	They're all network-based, exactly.
1953138	1953920	So now you do it that way.
1954180	1954340	Wow.
1955339	1963042	That's crazy to think that Nintendo still has a straight line of interconnection with at least one generation like that.
1963422	1966703	Technus in our chatroom says, I haven't played Pokemon since Red, Blue, Yellow.
1966763	1968504	Well, in my opinion, Technus, you haven't missed much.
1969264	1969585	Same.
1970625	1972546	At least as far as the missed part.
1972566	1975087	These new ones look like it's going to really correct that.
1975767	1976947	I tried to jump back in.
1976987	1979028	We have Diamond and Pearl.
1979308	1980249	We do have Diamond and Pearl.
1980289	1980749	Diamond and Pearl.
1981529	1996334	I told myself that I love the concept of what you can do with Pokemon, and I would jump into it when I feel that the features, the hardware is available to make really cool features, and so we both bought into Diamond and Pearl.
1996775	2000656	I played it for an hour or two maybe, and I just said, eh.
2002217	2005401	Black 2 and White 2 are original DS and not 3DS.
2006943	2013030	I don't really remember what my complaint about that was, but it just surprised me because it came out well after the 3DS was in existence.
2014311	2017174	Of course, I haven't played regularly since Yellow.
2017294	2020037	I actually still have the Game Boy, the special Game Boy from Yellow.
2020077	2020398	Yes, you do.
2021478	2028904	Let's see, go into some comments from our chatters at live.vognetwork.com Well, it wouldn't surprise me if Shane lied to me, y'all But I got all this from Shane, so take it up with him Alright, he can call in later to defend himself
2042540	2043441	Chimchar, HoMonkey
2072110	2072610	Think about it.
2072830	2073391	HoMonkey.
2074691	2075391	Homo and Key.
2076052	2077692	Homo and Key.
2077752	2078032	Get it?
2078653	2079713	So I said, well, what do I name?
2079773	2080673	I didn't name it.
2080693	2081674	Name yours Flaming Finger.
2081814	2085475	No, I picked a Piplup because they're little penguins and penguins are adorable, right?
2085895	2091938	And I was like, well, I didn't think to give it a dirty name because I need to know their regular name.
2092018	2094359	I can't remember my name and their name.
2094559	2097280	If you want me to learn Pokemon, I just need to call it what it is, right?
2097680	2101424	I very rarely, I think, I do this in any RPG I play.
2101504	2102465	I don't change their names.
2102865	2103926	I need to know their regular names.
2103966	2105067	So, in your head, Sanrio's name is Cat?
2105387	2105648	Yes.
2107890	2108250	So.
2108410	2109571	Shermie was Other Cat.
2109972	2114776	So, um, Shane suggested I call, I should go back and call him Penisquin.
2116558	2117339	Didn't even think about that.
2117619	2118380	Didn't even think about that.
2119521	2119621	Ugh.
2120540	2123202	and Misty in chat, by the way, says it is Chimchar, Jason.
2123222	2125163	I thought we were still talking original 151.
2126404	2127884	Oh, then you're thinking Charizard.
2127984	2132347	No, I'm thinking Chim... Oh, Charmander.
2133047	2137230	I remember Mankey and for the life of me, I can't think of the evolved version of it.
2139411	2141592	I named my Mankey a very dirty word in Japanese.
2142028	2149313	Alright, anyhow, uh, yeah, so now that I've, uh, really, um, I've been talking about Pokemon in this show for ten minutes, we should probably move on with other gaming weeks.
2149333	2163782	I was gonna say one more thing about Forza Horizon, of course, obviously the one thing that's, you know, blatantly in your face is that stupid festival, which I was like, oh my god, I don't fucking care about the goddamn festival, I wanna race, I wanna race, I don't care about it.
2163842	2164162	You'll get it.
2164782	2168945	That was the same thing that bothered me at first and that slowly slips into the background.
2169025	2169805	It doesn't matter anymore.
2169825	2170286	You'll be fine.
2171306	2173868	Thank you for bringing that up because I did spend a night on Forza Horizon.
2173908	2174708	We had a fun night.
2175049	2180652	Some of the VOG people, it was myself, Bobby, Actdeft, SSJ100Matt, we were all playing and it was a good time.
2180712	2182173	So we'll probably do that again during the week.
2182233	2185435	So keep an eye on Twitter for when we're going to play some Forza Horizon.
2186696	2187776	because that's a fun game.
2188056	2190457	So how do you add the VOG car club thing?
2190477	2191757	Because I couldn't find that option.
2191777	2192977	Of course, I only look for about a minute.
2192997	2193857	I'll invite you.
2194157	2195678	I can just look.
2195818	2199578	If somebody hasn't already done it by the time those words left my mouth because you can just go.
2200378	2204979	If you're on the friends list of Actdeft or Bobby or somebody, they just go into the car club.
2204999	2205479	They can find you.
2205759	2213261	But I think for other people, I think when you go to the car club, you can search for VOG, V-O-G, and that's the tag, V-O-G.
2213621	2214441	It's really easy to find.
2215751	2217252	Alright, let's move on.
2217412	2218313	More gaming weeks.
2218333	2219854	Less Pokey, more me.
2220334	2221975	Yes, less Pokey, more Jason.
2221995	2224536	Pokey Jason, how was your gaming week?
2225337	2226638	I have no idea how to respond to that.
2226678	2227938	I didn't know this was that kind of show.
2228799	2230960	Hey, at least I didn't call you Home Monkey.
2231140	2231400	Alright.
2233295	2235536	I have been a very bad gamer.
2238257	2240817	Like I believe I said at the top of the show, I was out here in November.
2242278	2250640	I spent Christmas with my family in western Colorado, so I was away from all of my exciting electronic video boxes.
2252281	2254981	I haven't played very much in a very long time.
2255041	2259943	I had the discussion with Jamie that I kind of started to poke back into limbo because it sounded interesting, but my
2260623	2279662	My go-to hobby is turning into music, and that's taken over quite a bit, because I don't know that I've even touched Borderlands 2 since October, maybe November, and I just... I play lots of tiny little things, like I have stupid apps on my phone, I touch my 3DS every once in a great while, but I just don't...
2280823	2283724	You know, there's nothing that I have that dedication to right now.
2283744	2284544	I'll tell you a secret.
2285044	2288105	Mixing music is something I've kind of always wanted to get into as well.
2288165	2288825	And, like, I've tried.
2288845	2290525	I've downloaded programs to try and, like, do it.
2290545	2291365	I'm really bad at it.
2291385	2292306	You can't do it software-only.
2292326	2293006	I'm really bad at it.
2293186	2293986	I took the plunge.
2294066	2303208	I made the $500 investment to get a controller that appealed to... The $500 investment, more like $1,500 after my case, speakers, mixer, cables, and...
2304528	2309452	Alan, that's why I went for my birthday Are you playing dubstep?
2320319	2320459	No.
2321900	2330784	I was actually... I've been asked that sarcastically, but I've gotten a few no-shit requests about it, and I started thinking about my library.
2330824	2333685	I'm like, well, I have Skrillex, because I was on that bandwagon.
2333705	2334986	Look at your library, look at your choices.
2336486	2339888	If my choices are based off my library, I have very few complaints.
2342009	2343410	You actually just made me think of something, though.
2344070	2348452	There's a YouTube video of a cockatiel trilling dubstep.
2351049	2354877	Because you know birds adapt to sounds around them into their language.
2357943	2359186	The bird speaks dubstep.
2360740	2362561	I definitely need to see this sometime.
2363502	2368445	So it was kind of, people, you know, they want some music to be played at a party or whatever.
2368485	2371386	I've gotten completely serious requests to play something like that.
2371747	2375329	And I just kind of think of what I have in my library and it's like, I know a couple of these artists.
2375409	2376589	I have a couple of one-offs.
2377050	2380171	I have Skrillex because everybody jumped on that bandwagon.
2380211	2382493	Some people call Knife Party dubstep even though they are not.
2383394	2386597	Um, but I just, I, I could not play 30 minutes worth.
2386758	2388420	Nero, Nero's awesome.
2388480	2392985	Nero's, I, I, House dubstep and what else does he do?
2393466	2394046	Drum and bass.
2394186	2394447	Yeah.
2394567	2395648	I really enjoy Nero.
2395688	2396930	I just don't have very much of his stuff.
2397650	2397791	Um,
2398531	2407457	In all fairness, because I don't want the dubstep fans to email the show, I hate you, wub wub wub.
2408657	2414361	I acquired the new Muse album this past week, which is a great album.
2414461	2418043	One of their songs, though, is a little bit dubstep experimentation.
2418063	2419164	It's the best song in the whole album.
2419364	2419784	It really is.
2419804	2420224	For real.
2422408	2429450	Yeah, my two jaunts right now are the general house genres, kind of progressive, electro, maybe down to trance.
2430630	2437592	But then I play a lot of UK and happy hardcore that I've enjoyed for a very long time, and now I can actually do something interesting with it, so that's been pretty fun.
2437792	2450235	And the great culmination of that is that my company is, my employer is putting on two shows this week, Tuesday at Mighty down in San Francisco, and Thursday a very public event at Public Works San Francisco.
2450515	2450655	And
2451415	2455739	I'm going to be on stage and I am freaking scared and excited and crazy.
2455759	2458101	You're going to be like Loki about to get on a roller coaster at Disneyland.
2458781	2460342	Yes, very much so.
2461363	2461703	Alright.
2463345	2464826	Rye, how was your gaming week?
2464846	2466167	What kind of video games have you been playing lately?
2466247	2467868	Or just Diablo 3, 24-7?
2467888	2468949	Diablo, Diablo.
2469049	2470811	Not 24-7, but for the most of it.
2471371	2472872	Just 22-7, you know.
2473353	2474794	Need a couple of hours of work, but...
2475618	2485023	Yeah, I went from Paragon, I believe, 47 up to 54 the past week, running public games and whatnot.
2486003	2490765	The only other thing that I've played recently was LEGO Lord of the Rings that I got for my birthday.
2492866	2494467	I really haven't gotten very far in it.
2496028	2496408	Because?
2497368	2497769	Diablo 3!
2500140	2512492	that's like a lot of games for me in World of Warcraft so don't feel bad alright well I hope you can discover some more games in the coming weeks because eventually you're going to hit Paragon 60 and then what?
2512912	2523603	Paragon 100 60 is the standard level cap but Paragon is 100 and that's of course also per character so she has no?
2523963	2527344	No, I am done after I get this character done.
2527364	2528444	That's what they all say.
2528464	2529445	It can be.
2530145	2532245	Paragon is still specific to a character.
2532425	2535426	And should she want to, she does have six other characters.
2535506	2542868	Not to mention the fact that there's an achievement for getting ten level 60s and having two of each class at level 60.
2542908	2544849	She has the plan.
2544889	2545809	It's all about the achievements.
2545969	2548049	Actually, that was another thing I was doing this week.
2548069	2549750	I was trying to achievement hunt in old games.
2550510	2551151	Okay, guys.
2552051	2554232	Guess what game I played this week just to get an achievement.
2554353	2554673	Yars.
2555753	2556094	Worse.
2556714	2557054	Worse.
2557174	2557795	Dino Dash.
2557855	2561437	What is an Xbox Live Arcade game worse than Yars and worse than Dino Dash?
2561997	2562438	Avatar.
2563198	2564039	Worse than Avatar.
2566980	2567861	Xbox Live Arcade.
2570433	2574355	It's offensive to anybody who listened to this show earlier today.
2574955	2576536	I would say Beaten Groovy.
2576556	2577276	Beaten Groovy.
2577376	2578857	I played Beaten Groovy this week.
2579097	2579997	Shame on you.
2580437	2581238	And I got a new achievement.
2581258	2582358	To put money into that.
2582438	2585339	I had to play every song in three-button mode.
2585439	2586100	I was so...
2586900	2587341	Bored.
2587581	2589903	And, like, Alan walked out into the room.
2589943	2591525	He's like, this looks bad.
2591605	2592225	What is this?
2592305	2593747	I'm like, it's on Xbox Live Arcade.
2593927	2595348	I'm like, doesn't it look like it's PlayStation 1?
2595649	2598091	He's like, yeah, look at those character animations.
2598151	2600433	Those are real next-gen right there.
2601154	2602796	So, yeah.
2603477	2604457	I had one of those weeks.
2604738	2605378	Shame.
2605499	2606840	That's just a travesty.
2606880	2607380	No, shame to chat.
2607521	2607801	All right.
2611229	2612289	I've found something for you.
2612549	2613510	Oh, this is for me.
2613690	2615270	So this is, oh yes, okay.
2615370	2622012	Because earlier when you were talking about the bird singing dubstep, I'm like, this show's been derailed seven times for Sunday already.
2622112	2623712	So what the hell?
2624753	2626713	What's another video going to add to it?
2626773	2627474	Okay, here we go.
2627834	2628614	I think that's the one.
2628634	2630294	So this is bird singing dubstep.
2631055	2632475	If there's an ad on this, so help me God.
2632535	2633275	So help me God.
2633375	2634295	Rob, it's not my fault.
2634315	2636216	You need to have your ad block up.
2636896	2637816	You're using Chrome, right?
2638137	2638697	No, you're not.
2638837	2639777	Why are you using Chrome?
2639917	2640637	Firefox.
2640918	2641678	Shame on you.
2641798	2642158	That's it.
2657183	2661825	The funny thing is that actually sounds like some pretty impressive beatboxing to an extent.
2666408	2668750	My sister's birds would probably do something like that.
2668770	2672655	She has a bird that looks exactly like that.
2675819	2676860	I like that it's dancing.
2683234	2685116	I could just listen to that for three hours.
2685216	2687178	I could see the appeal of dubstep.
2687959	2689501	I could totally just listen to that tonight.
2690342	2691423	Let's go to break, you guys.
2691443	2692784	We're gonna have our music break tonight.
2695988	2696808	Coming soon to DDR.
2698874	2701857	SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says, Congrats, OLR has found the end of the internet.
2722250	2722650	That's right.
2722690	2724871	We have collectively been eaten by a group.
2724931	2725692	Good night, everybody.
2726272	2728553	You've been listening to Orange Mountain.
2729354	2729654	I don't know.
2729694	2732635	I think... I was just saying Tard's been replaced by Dubstep Bird.
2733836	2734156	I don't know.
2734636	2740559	I think Polly, the X-rated parrot, might be a little... That came and went, though.
2740940	2742000	No, it's not Polly.
2742040	2742581	It's Ruby.
2742921	2743261	Oh, yeah.
2744113	2747116	All right, let's move on into some housekeeping.
2747256	2750579	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, Twitter.com slash OLR.
2750939	2752781	You can also hear this show in Stitcher.
2753101	2757425	Use thumbs up a lot if you listen there and share with all your friends and spread the word.
2757746	2764292	Because, you know, I can't imagine why word of this show doesn't spread like wildfire across the masses.
2764592	2769977	By the way, speaking of popularity contests, the podcast awards happened this past week.
2770517	2771538	and we didn't win.
2773100	2773540	It's too bad.
2774561	2775401	I want to give a shout out.
2775462	2779485	I got to give a shout out to my Twitter buddy because us independent podcasts have to stick together.
2779885	2784069	I got to give a shout out to my Twitter buddy Godfrey from Gamertag Radio.
2784869	2789353	That is a hard working guy and he is very good at promoting his show.
2789653	2793357	He's a very passionate podcaster and I honest to God thought he was going to win it.
2793597	2794718	I really did.
2794738	2796879	It's kind of that thing where it's like I'd love to win it but
2797640	2801521	If Godfrey won it, it's hard to be mad because, you know, he's been nominated several times.
2802322	2805043	At this point, they're becoming like the Susan Lucci of the podcast awards.
2805083	2806803	And so it's like, let the guy win already.
2807343	2808084	He didn't win either.
2808144	2811945	And I was like legit upset that he didn't win and we didn't win.
2812045	2812225	So...
2812685	2814186	Rob was doing that thing where he fans his face.
2814226	2814906	A little bit.
2815026	2815766	I won't cry.
2816167	2816847	I won't cry.
2817047	2820309	I'm not going to Las Vegas because Godfrey's probably going to win this year.
2820429	2822109	So I'll watch the speech from home.
2822149	2826031	And then when he didn't win, I'm like, oh, God, that poor guy went all the way to Vegas.
2826411	2831314	But it sounds like he had some great inspiration and all that and got to meet some really cool people and do the networking.
2831374	2833375	So shame on me for not going to Vegas.
2833415	2834235	But I'm broke.
2835095	2835896	I am broke.
2836796	2837897	Christmas broke me.
2838017	2840678	So this was not a good time of the year for the podcast awards.
2841178	2844179	Anyway, that is it for housekeeping.
2844219	2845820	Let's get into some gaming news.
2846220	2846560	Loki.
2847680	2848061	All right.
2848601	2851862	So let's talk a little bit about CES fun stuff.
2852002	2863306	And, of course, one of the big major announcements gaming-wise that kind of happened a little bit before CES even began was the new NVIDIA handheld console that they're putting out.
2863546	2870429	It's the NVIDIA Shield, and it's a Tegra 4-based handheld console.
2870649	2872470	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2899109	2924814	and you can even run um PC games on there by streaming them to your system and they even have a way to you know it has an HDMI out on it so you can play it on your TV if you want um but the whole fact that you can basically put in this mode where you stream stuff from your PC and you can even bring up Steam and play like you know console games on that is kind of cool um
2925791	2929512	I can stream anything I want from my PC to the gaming handheld?
2930592	2932472	I guess whatever's supported from it, but yeah.
2932873	2936453	So, number of seconds before porn is displayed on one of these devices.
2936573	2939774	Oh, it has a web browser in it because it's Android.
2939794	2941834	So yes, it would be no time whatsoever.
2942215	2947876	But, if you think about it though, if you can stream from your PC, and I'm assuming though that you can only do this...
2949897	2951118	I bet you could do a lot sitting in bed.
2951158	2951378	Yeah.
2951398	2951998	No chat, though.
2952019	2957143	Hypothetically, if I happen to have a TV in my bedroom, I could have boobies on the TV and boobies on the little handheld.
2957283	2957403	Yes.
2975373	2976615	That's what technology's all about, y'all.
2982882	2987725	So, yeah, they have the whole Steam Big Picture Mode support on there.
2988705	2998811	No price announced yet for it, and obviously, you know, because it's one of the first devices that has a Tegraform chip in it, it'll be interesting to see what it can run.
2999091	3001112	They're saying, you know, more console-quality games.
3001692	3008196	Some of the games that they have announced for it, Hawken, which was a PC kind of mech shooter, and actually...
3010707	3014731	One of the other titles was an old Wii game, The Conduit.
3015231	3019435	It's going to be getting some sort of souped up version that will be on Android.
3021497	3025921	So there's that stuff and of course some other Android games.
3025941	3028503	There's going to be more Taker 4 games coming out.
3029484	3031085	Like I said, no price point yet.
3031626	3034268	Everyone's like, oh, it's going to kill the Ouya and stuff like that.
3035342	3036423	They haven't announced the price yet.
3046847	3048008	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3074022	3074382	And don't buy it.
3094654	3095535	because they can.
3095595	3097516	I mean, they're already in the PC marketplace.
3097636	3100118	If you think about it, though, this technology, that's the only thing.
3100438	3108244	You're going to need a really high-end graphics card in order to run this because it's built into your graphics card as far as being able to stream to this device.
3108624	3113167	So really new high-end graphics card, and it has to be that NVIDIA card.
3113567	3116970	So that's why they're in this is because, oh, that's a really cool device.
3117570	3121533	Oh, crap, got to upgrade my graphics card, and I have to buy NVIDIA.
3121833	3123194	So that means more money for them.
3124295	3126356	It's win-win because they sell the device.
3127517	3130579	So when I first read about this, I was quick to blame the Ouya for this.
3130819	3135963	I don't know what it is, but there was a part of me that said, NVIDIA is doing this because of the Ouya.
3136343	3144828	And because of the way the Ouya took off, NVIDIA said, you know what Ouya's got wrong about this is that Ouya's making you hook it up to a TV.
3144908	3146649	What if we did an Ouya that's handheld?
3146690	3148531	I mean, isn't that, that's what a lot of this stuff is.
3148551	3150392	An Ouya that's handheld is a tablet.
3151778	3156221	Well, okay, isn't that kind of what this is?
3156341	3158963	I mean, it's not a tablet per se, but it might as well be.
3159623	3160884	No, this is, I think, something else.
3160924	3175373	I think this is just their whole thing is they're trying to go after PC gaming because, I mean, they make money off of their chips, but I think they're going to make more money off their graphics cards and all the tech that goes into that because, I mean, it's them and ATI.
3175893	3176334	That's it.
3176394	3178335	That's your choices for graphics cards and...
3179276	3182459	Anything that edge out the competition that make people say, hey, you know what?
3183540	3185562	I should get this because it's got that.
3185622	3187464	And if you think about it, NVIDIA has kind of done stuff like that.
3187484	3199435	I mean, they have three displays and they have, you know, that built into it and the PhysX stuff and also now the streaming thing and CUDA cores where you can, you know, run other things using that.
3200116	3203019	You know, PC applications that support those other cores.
3203919	3228468	I mean that's kind of the direction they're going so I wouldn't exactly blame the OUYA for it because I mean they don't know how it's gonna do yet I mean granted you're seeing a lot more of these set top I mean the whole thing with CES was just like you know it's tablets and Google TV and 4k TVs is basically the three big things but all people really want is an iPad I don't think so
3229728	3230308	Are you sure?
3230728	3231049	Yeah.
3231589	3234790	I mean, well, there's the Apple people that have to keep buying new things.
3234810	3236050	There's a lot of Apple people, though.
3236931	3242173	There's a lot of people who bought the Wii, but that doesn't mean that Nintendo is doing really well with the next system.
3242373	3247675	A quick context jump, at least as far as the consumer is concerned.
3248135	3259622	A buddy of mine that has this dinosaur of a phone was blown away at the ability to take his Wii U gamepad, be in another room in the house, and continue to browse the internet.
3260002	3261563	He doesn't have to pull out his laptop.
3262444	3263244	Well, that too, really.
3263645	3264805	Kind of awkward for this.
3265066	3266006	Anyways, sorry.
3267387	3273631	But it was the most absurd thing for me to read is that, wow, I have four inches of the internet.
3274304	3278806	Right smack dab in this little handheld controller and I don't even have to be in the same room as the TV is in.
3279766	3286328	And I did one of these things where I reached into my pocket and I pulled out my phone and I was like, wow, I'm not confined to the house.
3287829	3289129	This is like five years in the future.
3289890	3294173	And it's just strange because it's also like a connectivity excuse.
3295234	3300397	If you can game anywhere, even on a screen that's that small, people will do it when they can.
3301538	3302879	And I think there's application for it.
3303660	3306742	It doesn't necessarily fit in best for us.
3307782	3315728	Maybe, maybe not as much as another person, but for these people that just have little setups, it has enough of an application to survive in the market, I think.
3315967	3320509	Well, how do you win across the people, you know, the elderly folks that like Wii Sports Bowling?
3320990	3324591	You show them the voodoo magic that is TV on a thing that's not the TV.
3324871	3328213	Holy crap, how did my TV get on this little piece of, you know, plastic?
3328513	3330134	This is black magic.
3330274	3331095	I'm buying one.
3331155	3333836	And then they bowl it, drop it, and... Are you a wizard?
3334136	3336918	Actually, in this case, it keeps working if they were to bowl that little controller.
3337638	3339479	Unless they, like, break off, snap off the screen.
3340679	3343041	I don't like this camera on this thing.
3343101	3345102	I think it's gonna steal my identity.
3345802	3348403	That's an old... I could see that.
3348483	3350123	I've gotten that before.
3350283	3350784	Have you really?
3350804	3356245	Yeah, not camera specifically, but my name's on a website because I'm in a play.
3356945	3358246	Is there any problem with that?
3359046	3360827	That's why my mom won't join Facebook.
3361387	3367228	I asked my mom, I asked my mom, my mom is on Twitter and I'm not allowed to give out a Twitter handle or she will murder me.
3367629	3374671	But my mom has always said like, and she's only on Twitter because she wants to follow Cher, Kathy Griffin, Barack Obama, and Rosie O'Donnell.
3374751	3375171	No Oprah?
3376151	3383958	Not yet, she probably just hasn't thought of that one But anyway, she follows like four people And then me, she stalks me on Twitter But anyway, what was I really going to say?
3384058	3401752	Oh yes, my mom will not join Facebook And her thing always is, Rab I don't need, Rab, I don't need to join Facebook People have their identities stolen on Facebook, Rab And no one wants to see my face That's her line, no one wants to see my face My face isn't on Facebook, at least not my profile picture
3403023	3407166	People have their identity stolen because they gave their card to someone, which you do on a daily basis.
3417794	3420197	Alright, let's move on with some more news, shall we?
3420237	3433891	Talking about something else that was, you know, we didn't get a whole lot of gaming news out of CES this year, but there was a couple things here and there, and this was something that was gaining a lot of esteem, if you will, the talk at CES.
3435513	3440998	It's Valve's Steam Box, and it was confirmed by Gabe Newell that the Steam Box will run Linux.
3441398	3447564	The Steam Box, of course, is a little PC in a box that's basically designed to be hooked up to the computer.
3447924	3450687	It's basically out there to compete with the consoles, but it's a PC.
3450807	3452368	It's Steam, and it will be Linux.
3452628	3452889	Big surprise.
3452949	3454890	And this is the one from Valve.
3455791	3456292	From Valve.
3456892	3458212	The official one from Valve.
3458352	3458553	Yes.
3458753	3458953	Yes.
3460033	3463454	By the way, that box itself, not supposed to hit in 2013.
3464054	3465194	That kind of surprises me.
3465935	3468515	Why not strike now when all this stuff is a big hit?
3468955	3470776	I don't get what's so freaking difficult about this.
3470796	3472316	Like, what do they have planned for this?
3472916	3474937	I'm going back to an earlier prediction, by the way.
3475317	3477718	I am going back to an earlier prediction I had, and I'm sticking by it.
3477998	3480078	Half-Life 3, when the Steam Box happens.
3480379	3480719	Probably.
3480939	3481339	Why not?
3482960	3490211	and people who have the Steam Box will get Half-Life 3 first and watch that thing just cut the Ouya off of the kneecaps.
3490412	3490712	Watch.
3491293	3491594	Watch.
3491814	3493376	There's a reason why it's not dropping this year.
3494538	3495079	Compatibility.
3497048	3498269	Oh, because of Linux compatibility.
3498289	3499250	They're waiting for more of the games.
3499270	3501652	They need more developers to jump on.
3502092	3507016	That's why Steam Linux is coming to Linux systems first, because they need to have that library base.
3507056	3511499	They need it to be as successful as possible, because when that thing drops, why can't I play Mass Effect on there?
3511780	3513341	Why can't I play World of Goo on there?
3513621	3516023	Why can't I play Toki, Tori, Limbo?
3516463	3516723	Anyways.
3516963	3521126	Well, how about a comment from Ben Krasnow, who is an electrical engineer with Valve.
3521146	3527351	Although I thought that's weird because I thought Valve people didn't have titles, but maybe that's just what's on his resume if you looked at his LinkedIn or something.
3527991	3532294	Quote, with regards to the Steam box news, there's been a lot of things stated in media, which I didn't say.
3532614	3540440	For example, it's true that we are working on getting Steam into the living room and are planning for a hardware box, but we have no current plans to announce anything in 2013.
3540900	3543642	So the Linux thing may end up being something...
3544222	3548586	The thing to draw from this, we're hearing about the Linux thing now, but that may actually end up not being the case.
3548966	3553210	Maybe it's running Linux now, but who knows what's going to happen.
3553230	3557233	It's because it can't run Windows 8, because that would look really weird.
3557373	3558734	It can't run Windows, period.
3559415	3561877	And it can't run Mac OS, so why wouldn't it run Windows?
3561937	3563438	Mac OS, like iOS, wow.
3563498	3566081	It could run a modified version of Linux.
3566421	3570644	Yeah, anything, like, they may put together the SteamOS...
3571565	3577387	The SteamOS, which is going to be a Linux kernel, their own different base utilities, whatever they need to do.
3578947	3580268	Call it Linux, call it not.
3580408	3583429	Call it not Linux because it's proprietary.
3584349	3584909	I don't know.
3585309	3586109	What a big surprise.
3586269	3588390	It's going to be based on the biggest open platform in the world.
3589178	3599453	Well, speaking of open platforms, Gabe Newell apparently looking at the Steam box as being something, or Steam in general, as being something that is a very user-generated paradise.
3600635	3602418	Maybe taking a cue from GitHub, who knows?
3603359	3605222	Our view has always been... Wow, nice leap.
3605402	3605882	Yeah, nice.
3606002	3609504	Our view has always been that we should build tools for customers and tools for partners.
3609844	3613186	An editorial filter is fine, but there should be a bunch of editorial filters.
3613506	3616607	The backend services should be network APIs that anybody can use.
3616967	3620709	On the consumer side, anybody should be able to put up a store that hooks into those services.
3621089	3622650	Some people will create team stores.
3622690	3624091	Some people will create Sony stores.
3624131	3627572	Some people will create stores with only games that they think meet their quality bar.
3627952	3630954	Somebody is going to create a store that says these are the worst games on Steam.
3631354	3633918	So that's an example of where our thinking is leading us right now.
3634759	3635540	Very interesting.
3635680	3636221	Four letters.
3637342	3639164	H T T P
3641843	3644405	Because the web is something that... Or what?
3644525	3645706	What's the point you're making?
3645726	3649049	Because that's become the universal communication mechanism.
3649449	3658436	And let somebody do whatever the hell they want and then interconnect it and host it and make it available just by pointing to a different location and boom!
3658516	3661539	The freedom of the internet and the open platform and hoorah!
3662360	3667944	I don't want to be dismissive about it because really it is the best thing to come to computing in ever besides computing existing in the first place.
3669786	3670846	But it's...
3671807	3674588	It's just an interesting thing they're banking on, I guess.
3675309	3675569	I don't know.
3675589	3676969	I don't really have a way to summarize it.
3676989	3684073	It's just funny that Steam has come from store to meta store and opening it all up, but there's still the linchpin holding it all together.
3684093	3685733	I don't know.
3685813	3696238	I feel like I'm still missing one last detail that makes this whole narrative of everything Steam is doing over the next three years to make sense.
3696518	3698359	Do you think the Steam box is going to be too late?
3699164	3699765	Oh, hell no.
3700385	3701446	No, not even a little bit.
3703167	3705810	It's going to be a significant player, period.
3705890	3707071	That's all there is to say about it.
3709440	3710080	If it's too late.
3710740	3723223	If Half-Life 3 is on it, I mean... I don't think they're really going to necessarily put Half-Life 3 exclusive to the Steam box or anything like that, but I think that it may launch with it or something.
3724404	3735566	And there's other third-party manufacturers of this stuff, so if you don't like the configuration of running Linux or anything like that, that probably wouldn't be something I'd be interested in.
3735806	3736867	I don't know.
3736887	3738087	I just don't really want to run Linux.
3740609	3741609	What about Linux Mint?
3741870	3744612	Could Jamie get her precious Linux Mint on a Steam box, you think?
3745152	3745553	Probably.
3745613	3745933	Why not?
3745993	3747994	I can get Linux Mint on a USB drive.
3749596	3753979	If you can get Linux on a toaster, Rob, Mint will run on anything.
3754079	3755340	Here's what I would like to see.
3755520	3760482	I would like to see more apps coming to Steam Big Picture mode.
3760582	3764504	Like, for example, Netflix and Hulu and that kind of stuff.
3764904	3766325	Because right now that's the thing.
3766885	3772408	I wanted to build a PC that has this kind of cool interface like the Xbox 360 and stuff.
3773048	3773288	and so on.
3793476	3805082	That would be pretty awesome so that I can get all that stuff in there because that's really what I'm looking for is just, you know, watch TV stuff, play games, runs on a PC because things will look better.
3806922	3815907	All right, let's move on with more news because there was news this week that had nothing to do with newfangled consoles and new boxes and things, but news about the good old consoles that are out now, right?
3816187	3816527	Right, Jamie?
3817503	3819484	Yeah, some Pokemans.
3821886	3822526	Pokemon.
3823707	3829450	So Nintendo announced that Pokemon X and Pokemon Y are going to be on the Nintendo 3DS.
3829991	3833072	And they should be out later this October.
3833573	3835454	Why are we thinking that far ahead, man?
3836555	3841558	But it just makes me wonder if you get all chick Pokemon in one and all dude Pokemon in the other.
3842218	3843259	Because they're XY.
3844299	3847161	Even if Pokemon had XY chromosomes, I'm just saying.
3847475	3851796	No, I think it has something to do with the way the final bosses are named or something.
3852016	3856076	Well, at any rate, they're actually saying that it's not a reboot.
3856096	3857997	It's just an evolution of the franchise.
3858977	3863858	And Game Freak has basically been working their ass off trying to get it out.
3863978	3869039	The quote is saying that there has never been a conscious decision to reboot.
3869719	3871959	There's always been an evolution of the look and feel.
3873619	3874580	No one gives a shit.
3874640	3876580	So their Pikachu has evolved into a Raichu.
3877552	3880495	Yeah, their Pikachu is like a Pikachu-er.
3881276	3883878	Their Wubbachu has evolved into a dub Stepachu.
3886681	3887621	That's never going to get old.
3888362	3889123	Never, ever.
3892186	3895809	And that's the sound the Pokemon still make in the games today, by the way.
3896350	3899913	They never learned how to say their names like they did in the cartoon.
3899953	3902635	But you go like, you know, whole monkey, I choose you.
3902695	3903116	And it goes...
3905723	3911766	The best thing that the newer Pokemon games have ever given is X, use the pester ball.
3911906	3913066	It's super effective.
3913166	3914207	It's super effective.
3917368	3918989	Are you excited about Pokemon X and Y?
3919409	3919609	No.
3919669	3920669	Will you give it another chance?
3920769	3920949	No.
3922430	3927292	I saw the little trailer video and first things first about the trailer video.
3927652	3930233	Fennekin, totally adorable.
3930333	3931114	Have you seen Fennekin?
3931974	3932154	No.
3932194	3933034	Let me put it this way.
3933414	3934135	DeviantArt
3934875	3939319	Like jizzed in their pants DeviantArt pisses me off Why does DeviantArt piss you off?
3939540	3957397	Besides the royalty thing I'm talking the community Don't bring up that crap about the royalties I don't care about that The community and all that Tumblr blew up The royalty things is the fuck Oh god No, and actually there are a lot of people Who get their panties in a wad on DeviantArt these days So I'm just completely kind of done Even though I did post something on there
3960160	3969480	so wait a minute you're done with DeviantArt but you just posted there the other day yeah because I actually use I pay for my DeviantArt account to host my portfolio
3972106	3973146	I guess that's fair.
3973427	3983831	All right, look, look, I gotta show you this in the little trailer, although I'm sure I'm gonna get hit with an ad here, but I gotta show you in this trailer the Fennekin, because Fennekin's super adorable.
3984571	3988512	And finally, the game looks different.
3988613	3994175	Like, it's not that same, like, sprite-based thing we've seen since, like, the original freaking games.
3994815	3997556	It is, like, you know, what you would expect to see on a 3DS.
3997576	3997616	So...
4000577	4003540	and Pikachu's still in it.
4006303	4012548	Okay, so, you know, it's like, yay, we're going to take over the world one little pocket monster at a time.
4014450	4019895	But see, now it's actually like what a game from this year should look like, right?
4020115	4022177	Okay, now that actually does look kind of fun, except I don't have a 3DS.
4025792	4027474	However, the Pokemon all look retarded.
4027494	4029916	Okay, that's Chespin.
4030056	4031017	He looks cute, right?
4031137	4031337	No.
4034580	4035421	And look at the battles.
4035581	4037703	The battles look like a freaking Dragon Quest game.
4038404	4038844	Or something.
4039965	4041467	How adorable is Fennekin?
4041587	4042868	Okay, Fennekin is cute.
4042948	4043368	See?
4044409	4044790	See?
4044890	4047312	He's like... But only because it looks like Eevee.
4047612	4049054	Who put a Firefox in this game?
4053031	4054272	Oh, he's so cute.
4055012	4056833	And then that is, I don't know, Froakie.
4056993	4058273	That looks disgusting.
4059133	4060634	What's that shit on its nose?
4061054	4061734	Are those glasses?
4063014	4064075	Noah's big snot bubbles.
4065095	4065655	That's what it is.
4065715	4068796	He's blowing snot on whatever that raccoon thing is.
4070305	4070766	Hibiga.
4070926	4074549	And then Psyduck, oh god.
4074790	4077032	Psyduck is like the big joke of the series.
4080015	4081256	No, that's Psyduck.
4082077	4082718	Psy.
4082738	4083459	Is his name Boner?
4092117	4093538	Ry is giving me the commentary.
4093859	4094259	No, Rob.
4094279	4097641	That one's Y. That one's X. You've studied this trailer.
4098102	4101164	And the secret one is Boner.
4101224	4102145	I actually haven't.
4102245	4104267	Just saw somebody post it on my Facebook.
4104487	4105628	What's up with that peacock deer?
4105668	4106408	That was really weird.
4108850	4138282	I will probably give these so doesn't that like didn't that like yeah you go okay new Pokemon game yeah whoopty shit I've seen this before but then you look at that trailer and you go they finally fucking changed it this I can do this this looks good I will give this game a shot again welcome to 2013 Nintendo the same argument I made for Diamond and Pearl for the DS I think the 3DS and I hope Nintendo's giving a shit about online and modern technology and the things that they're actually continuing to build into their new systems I'll give this a shot
4138542	4140324	Does that mean you'll play it for two hours this time?
4140644	4141425	No, two and a half.
4141686	4141986	Okay.
4143107	4144308	It's an improvement, damn it.
4144529	4151796	Actdeft, in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, dares to challenge Jamie, saying Magikarp is the big joke of the series.
4151857	4156341	Magikarp is... Psyduck was more the joke in the cartoons.
4158243	4158824	Whatever.
4158924	4159485	I don't care.
4159545	4160146	It's Pokemon.
4161637	4169220	GameGuru, bringing logic into this argument, saying, well, Pokemon had to update to polygons to support 3D so they couldn't use sprites anymore.
4169660	4177222	GameGuru, you haven't played those NES classics where they just put the different sprite layers on different 3D planes.
4177442	4181804	They could have done cheap-ass 3D if they wanted to, but I'm glad they didn't.
4182064	4183164	They're finally doing the right thing.
4183724	4185645	All right, let's move on with more news.
4185725	4185945	Loki.
4186645	4192248	Alright, so there is a neat little piece of technology that they showed off.
4194009	4199212	I don't know if it was at CES or it was just something that they showed off during CES.
4199392	4206436	But it is this brand new thing called the Microsoft in Illumaroom.
4206977	4209998	And what the Illumaroom demo was is basically this...
4211419	4223148	A combination of a projector and a Kinect built in so that it senses the geometry of your room and then extends your gameplay field beyond the TV.
4223608	4232695	It can be supplemental stuff like racing in a game and the lighting effects from cars driving by at night or something like that.
4233015	4235537	Cast Shadows on stuff that's in your room.
4236318	4239000	Or, you know, snow when you're walking through snow.
4239341	4243985	Or, you know, even like geometry for first person shooters and that kind of thing.
4244545	4248048	Now, what's interesting about this is this is something we talked about before.
4249249	4252853	Not necessarily the Illumeroom thing, but kind of a lot of stuff hinting at it.
4252893	4255215	Like, for example, there's the whole patent back in...
4255915	4265179	I don't think this is going to work with the Kinect because the way the projector works on this is similar to what they had in their Microsoft Home of the Future display.
4284007	4285288	Which I think is on their campus.
4286308	4296273	And this is what I've kind of alluded to before where they showed off these different displays that are built into... Not necessarily built into the walls, but they are projected onto the walls.
4296293	4306678	So they have, for example, this kid's room that will have this fictional teenage girl's favorite bands.
4307098	4309179	The posters on the wall are all dynamic.
4310019	4311100	It's showing her bands and stuff.
4311120	4311520	And then, say...
4312140	4314761	Oh, Grandma's coming over today and they're going to stay in your room.
4314781	4320483	And then the whole motif just changes completely to, you know, whoever's using it.
4320503	4325084	Like, they have a window that shows, you know, her dog at home on a security camera or something like that.
4325504	4330806	So, basically, what... And this... And they also have some projects that they've done with Augmentive...
4332984	4347094	and Augmentive Projectors where you can actually use your shadows to control stuff like Kinect where you have particles that you're moving your hand and your shadows like picking them up and you can actually pick stuff up with your fingers which is kind of neat.
4347114	4349035	So I see that kind of stuff happening.
4350156	4353098	Now whether is this going to be included in the next Xbox?
4353298	4356400	I think if anything this will be an accessory for the next Xbox.
4356440	4360803	I don't think this is something that they can just throw in there because the setup is...
4361403	4363505	Pretty cool and pretty non-existent in the end.
4382495	4384936	Yeah, it's one of those things where I'm like, is this snake oil?
4386256	4389297	The video is pretty impressive, the video that's floating around out there.
4390578	4392678	It's a neat concept.
4392698	4395939	I wouldn't say it's snake oil, but they have a working prototype.
4396420	4400541	Even they show this Home of the Future type thing, this Microsoft thing.
4400581	4403342	I don't live in the Home of the Future, Loki.
4403362	4403602	What?
4404182	4408765	They have a working prototype in a 100% tailored setup.
4408825	4415770	I'm just wondering though, I'm wondering just basically how much this would cost because projectors aren't cheap.
4416591	4423295	And so, I mean, this would be cool technology if this is something that they launch with the system that you're immersed in your whole room.
4423395	4424316	I mean, that'd be pretty cool.
4424356	4426297	Projectors can come at all sorts of levels.
4426397	4432641	Like, yes, a high quality projector isn't cheap, but you can get a little thing that projects shadow puppets on the wall for your kids when they sleep for $20.
4432702	4432822	Right.
4433682	4437044	So, I mean, what is the level of projection technology in this thing?
4437104	4438264	It's somewhere in the middle, probably.
4438705	4440866	But I don't think it's going to be built into the next Xbox.
4440906	4441346	I'm with you.
4441366	4442646	I think it's some type of accessory.
4442927	4450270	Well, they were even talking about the tracking and stuff, better 3D modeling and capture and stuff.
4450330	4457394	One of the things they said with the Kinect that they were going to change is that they're going to have, instead of having that IR field just...
4458274	4460416	I don't know, it sounds interesting but
4486021	4486601	Thanks for watching!
4514935	4543455	putting the display for your computer on any object or wall or whatever so it could be cool and that would be also kind of neat if you think about it like imagine you know playing like Forza or something like that and then you have all you know you could have maps and all sorts of HUD equipment you know outside of the TV but that time though if you're gonna have all that stuff outside of the screen you might as well just use the projector as your display in the first place
4544012	4550474	Ragenator in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com asks, now the question is how many steps away from Star Trek's holodeck is this projector?
4550795	4551635	We're getting closer.
4551955	4554056	Now it's making the whole room show imagery.
4554236	4554656	It's closer.
4555296	4561739	They have technology that's in another one of their videos because they have this whole research thing that they do a bunch of future tech stuff.
4562099	4566460	They have a 3D display that is pretty interesting.
4566480	4568821	It can be viewed from 360 degrees.
4570082	4572663	You can't touch it yet, but we're getting there.
4572863	4573423	We're getting there.
4575578	4576219	Use the passphrase, swim.
4582779	4583059	All right.
4583499	4586220	Well, moving on for time issues.
4586260	4587120	This sounds awesome.
4587261	4589141	I'm looking forward to more information on it.
4589281	4595683	I hope it's something that actually works because the concept sounds great and could really enhance gaming.
4597124	4606307	Moving on, though, a story that we've really kept an eye on and everybody has in the game industry this week is the fallout from the tragedy last month in Connecticut.
4606867	4611711	and I'm sure you guys all heard in the news about the gaming companies that were actually meeting with Joe Biden this week.
4612031	4613912	There was even some controversy around that.
4614012	4615813	Should they even be meeting with Joe Biden?
4615833	4618635	Because is meeting with him admitting that they are part of the problem?
4619096	4620837	Well, here's the reality, guys.
4620957	4626961	I mean, no matter where you stand on that issue, a survey company named Survey USA actually...
4628462	4629523	Pulled a bunch of parents.
4629823	4642014	I don't know exactly what the qualifications were for this survey, but I guess it was all 50 states in the U.S., January 4th and 5th, just over 1,000 parents who have children under the age of 18 living at home.
4642754	4648259	89% of parents believe that violence in today's video games is a problem.
4648679	4651742	75% believe that violence in video games contributes to violent behavior.
4651762	4651742	75%.
4651962	4652202	Sheep.
4655405	4657127	three out of four.
4657667	4661870	That is a line that transcends Democrat and Republican and any of that.
4662251	4664373	That is a vast majority.
4667535	4668436	That's the reality.
4668736	4672359	75% of parents believe that violence in video games contributes to violent behavior.
4672839	4680126	Now what I would be curious to know is does that mean that they take an active role in what their kids should and should not play?
4681567	4683048	I wonder if the survey went to that.
4683835	4686897	Well, how often do you... Well, here's an example.
4688358	4695243	And I know way too many... I'm not saying that any parent in this room does this, because I know you probably don't, really.
4695884	4707812	But there are some people who I know who have kids who really just let their kids sit unregulated and watch whatever they want to and play whatever they want to and aren't even in the same room when they're playing a game.
4709213	4709373	And...
4711320	4719648	And of course, I don't think that it's a matter necessarily of the game or the show that's being the influence.
4719989	4721810	It's a matter of neglect being the influence.
4722531	4724993	Because the kid's going to act out when they're not getting the attention they need.
4725394	4726875	Let me run down some of the other stats.
4727356	4729278	Because Jamie, I'm really curious what you think about some of this.
4732111	4739099	93, 93% of parents, damn near all parents, nationwide say lack of supervision for children contributes to violence.
4739539	4741541	Agreed.
4742302	4745426	92% of parents nationwide say bullying contributes to violence.
4745626	4746287	Very much agreed.
4747528	4751793	86% of parents nationwide say crime in day-to-day life contributes.
4754133	4755694	That depends.
4756974	4760115	Yes, because the news shows it is where I'm going with that.
4760895	4765237	My point is that it's media is the contributor.
4765777	4777181	How many people think that that horrible gunman, and I won't say his name, how many people think that that horrible gunman did what he did so that he could go out with all the publicity?
4777981	4783322	Because if he wanted to end it all, he could have done it in a different way.
4783502	4786463	But he did it in a way that was meant to get attention.
4787083	4791764	I think he did it because his mother works there.
4793185	4799226	I can't clearly put myself in that kind of mindset because I'm not a psychopath or a sociopath.
4800166	4806728	But he went to the school that his mother taught at and shot her students and then her.
4807828	4809748	So that seems more of a big revenge thing.
4810389	4812109	Just because I want to spare you the males.
4812689	4812949	I know.
4813009	4816110	Technically, the mother was killed, then he went to the school.
4816410	4819330	Okay.
4819450	4820491	But I think it's related.
4821311	4826912	It's like, oh, she's gone, let's fuck up everything that meant something to her, and then we're done.
4827192	4828612	I don't want to talk about him anymore.
4828652	4835374	But my point is, I don't know how much of the media might have had something to do with that other than it gave it to him as an option.
4836954	4863965	77% of parents nationwide say violence in TV and movies contributes so interesting enough I mean to be fair as much as we're sitting here going oh my gosh 75% that is 2% lower than the number of parents who say TV and movies contributes so at least everybody's getting blamed equally I guess 64% say violent toys contribute here's what surprised me
4866318	4891461	75% we already established believe that violence in video games contributes guess what got the exact same percentage also at 75% exact same easy access to guns contributes to violence yeah but on the exact same level as video games well again video games are the scapegoat
4893081	4902025	We have tons of research, psychiatric data, and statistics that show video games are not the responsible thing.
4902646	4919014	I think when you put a combination of pre-existing mental conditions, when you throw in easy access to weaponry, and when you throw in a few other external factors like, for example, the guy here in California who was bullied.
4920174	4946329	and he shot one of his bullies and got talked out of it you know that's definitely a contributing factor I just I need to get this out there because the chat room is lighting up on this and again we don't want the podcast listeners sitting there going I'm going to write an email because they're wrong folks in chat all over the place saying that it was not she didn't work at the school the media reported that but the media fucked up a lot of the information at first so
4948030	4952153	But I think there was some type of connection between him and the school.
4952173	4953974	Whether it was that he went there or something, I don't know.
4954054	4956115	But anyway, you know.
4956875	4961278	Regardless, I think that maybe you might not have gotten the idea if it hadn't been something so publicized.
4962219	4962499	You know.
4963660	4964200	He's sick.
4964260	4965221	We can all agree on that.
4965301	4966081	Very, very, very sick.
4967002	4967142	Um...
4969306	4973510	Apparently, those surveyed were shown a video for Hitman Absolution.
4975232	4979235	84% said that advertisement was inappropriate to show on TV at a time when children are watching.
4980497	4982699	Well, I'd actually kind of agree with that.
4982759	4985681	You don't show a commercial like that during, you know, the Smurfs.
4985902	4989385	Not shown during the time when they were watching TV.
4990086	4990266	Okay.
4991488	4992249	Yeah, that's true.
4992269	4992549	That's right.
4992569	4993290	They're not shown.
4993390	4999718	I was just like... Once again, though... Unless parents let their kids watch South Park unattended.
5000499	5001200	Same death.
5001240	5002381	Which is an M-rated show.
5002641	5009810	Once again, though, I think, though, that a lot of this is just... You're asking someone's opinion on this doesn't mean that they're right.
5010090	5010190	And...
5010991	5012032	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5039393	5042836	You can think all these things, but it doesn't necessarily mean that any of this is correct.
5044157	5046540	So, I mean, I don't know.
5047260	5055187	Once again, we're just probably going to see more legislature with video games because everyone's believing now that video games are violent because the media told them.
5055527	5061633	And oddly enough, they question all this other stuff, but they don't question media, which makes no sense whatsoever.
5061653	5061733	Yeah.
5063307	5063527	Fine.
5063727	5066789	Let me close with this comment and then I want to move on from SSJ100, Matt.
5067409	5069630	People look for answers to understand tragedy.
5069971	5078315	They want a finger to point at because the fact of the matter is people are terrified of the fact that people could do something so horrible for no reason than just because.
5080076	5080836	I guess it's scapegoat.
5082605	5083166	House of the Dead
5110074	5112477	I don't know if anybody had House of the Dead in the first place.
5112597	5114180	But Lethal Enforcers first, really?
5115301	5118185	Time Crisis and Beachhead 2000 was another one.
5118245	5118746	Beachhead 2000.
5118846	5121409	What a light gun game.
5121449	5125214	What a pretentious fucking game Beachhead 2000 was in many ways.
5125274	5125955	Let's be real.
5126556	5127778	But still, apparently...
5129512	5130472	Too Hot for Massachusetts.
5150240	5171661	that's your prerogative you can do whatever the hell you want because you know what it's your arcade you can make those decisions I don't even know why it was a news story other than oh this happened so let's make it into a story but like seriously if you don't like fighting games so if you know people are bullying each other you take fighting games out of your arcade that's your own choice
5172682	5174463	Did they replace it with non-violent ticket games?
5174563	5176104	Because I'd like to know if that actually happened.
5176124	5177665	The games that remained, Ms.
5177705	5180447	Pac-Man, Galaga, and Cruisin' Exotica at one point.
5180968	5183169	Like Cruisin' World, it's not a porn game.
5183409	5184910	It's like the Cruisin' race games.
5185271	5188393	Cruisin' Exotica, I mean, that's very violent.
5188433	5189413	Can't you hit things?
5189474	5191695	I mean, remember Cruisin' USA, you can explode deer.
5191835	5195277	And you can drive a school bus irresponsibly.
5195298	5200261	You can drive over 100 miles an hour, which doesn't happen in the States except on racetracks.
5202912	5221060	Richard Davey, the State Secretary of Transportation in Massachusetts Here's a quote Bottom line is, I think there isn't a person who doesn't believe that there isn't too much violence in our society and games can glorify that A video game in a public space could be used by anybody of any age
5222455	5224758	I think there isn't a person who disagrees.
5245299	5251405	who doesn't believe that there isn't too much violence in our society and games can glorify that.
5251586	5254308	It's a positive because it's very negative.
5254328	5263298	A person does not exist who doesn't believe that there isn't too much violence.
5264018	5264299	So...
5266676	5271237	I think it should be that, and he doesn't think that those people don't exist.
5272497	5280499	So if I were going to rephrase that, I think what he intends is, I think most people believe there's too much violence in our society.
5281119	5282019	Wouldn't that have been easier?
5282039	5285179	By the way, I don't think there's enough violence.
5285279	5288840	He would have learned better grammar if he wasn't playing those violent video games.
5290320	5290860	They're the blame.
5291941	5293961	Not playing violent video games leads to bad grammar.
5295020	5297441	I want to make the most bloody grammar game ever.
5298522	5299422	That'd be awesome.
5300823	5308127	Call it, I don't know, bloody... I can't think of a... Hunt, Peck, Mame, the game.
5309307	5316211	According to Jason in our chatroom, Jason, you're talking there in our chatroom, apparently that quote was quote-ception.
5319732	5320433	Negative-ception.
5320633	5321193	I have no idea.
5321253	5323094	It just hurt my head to try to deal with.
5326721	5331443	There isn't a person who doesn't believe that there isn't too much violence.
5331463	5336726	We get it, we get it, we get it, we get it.
5339308	5340448	Alright, let's move on.
5340868	5341529	More news.
5342289	5346811	DarkSakura, one more story and then the release dates.
5348172	5353275	UK University is trying to use the Kinect to see if it will help stroke victims.
5357816	5358396	I couldn't resist.
5358416	5359096	I'll put it away.
5359236	5363157	I'm going to take that gong and shove it so far up your ass.
5363237	5363557	I don't know.
5363597	5365758	This is kind of payback for all the Vuvuzela stuff.
5367378	5368198	That is true.
5368559	5373180	I'm going to shove that gong so far up your ass that you burp brass.
5374160	5375420	Technically, I don't think it's a gong.
5375440	5375760	Wait a minute.
5375780	5376580	Wait a minute.
5376600	5379921	So you're going to put brass in my ass to give me brassy gas?
5382142	5382342	All right.
5382362	5383502	Seriously, read the fucking story.
5383862	5384562	I'm going to walk away.
5384882	5387103	I would much rather have Dubstep Bird.
5389707	5391188	Can we remix those together?
5393450	5408122	You have to add a re for a minute to make it go They need to have a bird that does the Inception sound If you think about it, if you think about it, it probably exists on the internet somewhere Inception bird?
5408663	5411065	No, dubstep Inception HD here
5423157	5424618	That actually hurts.
5425959	5428801	And I'm not meaning that in an exaggerating kind of way.
5428941	5429862	It actually hurts.
5430983	5432024	All right, just please read this.
5432124	5434025	I don't think that there isn't a person that...
5447254	5448214	and to their doctors.
5449115	5450475	These are for stroke victims.
5450695	5456697	They're wanting to use the system to detect and track asymmetries on the patient's face.
5457337	5461858	That means mouth, eyes, cheeks, like for facial exercises.
5462478	5469240	I think it's for people who end up with ticks after strokes or being paralyzed.
5470201	5474722	And this is actually being headed, it looks like, by Dr. Philip Breeden.
5475562	5489709	who is basically saying that the system is going to use those exercises and see how successful they are with that feedback provided by the Kinect system.
5490470	5491950	So, pretty good.
5494171	5503216	I'm glad to hear a story about gaming things and things that were done for gaming doing good after those past couple stories we had, so...
5503692	5504012	Agreed.
5504413	5506894	And, I mean, you really have to think about it.
5508635	5514139	Like, for example, they had all those PlayStations put together to calculate, you know, cures.
5514359	5517541	They had, you know, now this technology with Kinect.
5517581	5522324	They've got lots of cognitive therapy exercises that are being done with video games.
5523645	5523765	And...
5525649	5526829	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5552354	5562560	Just a tiny little house party for New Year's and one of their friends created this very quick little visualization demo that uses the Kinect.
5562641	5569905	It uses the 3D, the point field, all of the features of the Kinect to create this reactive visualization.
5570785	5572607	He implemented the ability to...
5573787	5578189	You take the object and manipulate it in 3D space as far as the output is concerned.
5578469	5586733	And then obviously you have control of the Kinect's tilt and how much of the space it will actually display.
5588453	5594516	For all of the grief that I've given Kinect, as far as what it's capable of doing and representing, it's actually really good.
5595536	5601979	This kind of thing, I wouldn't think that it'd be applicable to the granularity of a face, but from the right distance, why not?
5603532	5608756	I really enjoy hearing about these applications that are practical and promising at the same time.
5609496	5611498	Oh, we've heard about Kinect being used by doctors.
5611678	5618083	I mean, maybe not like hooked up to an Xbox or anything, but like, you know, that technology in PCs, you know, pretty awesome.
5618664	5619905	Alright, let's move on.
5619965	5624848	Travel around the world and check out maybe some more affordable video games coming to a store near you.
5624889	5625909	We'll start in the US, Loki.
5626069	5628391	This week is Devil May Cry on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
5628431	5628631	Woo!
5628651	5628952	That's it.
5632304	5633925	First big release of the new year though, right?
5634606	5636528	Hey, Anarchy Reigns came out last week.
5636728	5637769	Oh yeah, I forgot about that.
5637829	5638570	That's right, that's right.
5638630	5639070	Shame on me.
5640171	5641072	I've been told I need to play that.
5641092	5644415	A game with potentially Bayonetta if you bought it from GameStop.
5645176	5645456	Really?
5646377	5647678	Yeah, only from GameStop.
5648338	5649479	Thank you, Sega.
5650340	5652922	Fuck you and your goddamn GameStop shit.
5653183	5654564	You're going the route of Nintendo now.
5655598	5660424	Alright, let's go to the Xbox 360 releases in Japan.
5660804	5662827	Japan also gets Devil May Cry this week.
5662867	5666151	Kind of one of those rare multi-regions in the same week.
5666751	5670196	Also a game called Heavy Fire Shattered Spear makes its way to Japan this week.
5670236	5671457	Both those games out on the 17th.
5672458	5676319	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, of course, as you can expect, Devil May Cry is out there as well.
5676679	5682661	Dream Seat Club Zero, special, it's not an edition, they have Edpion or something.
5682701	5685062	They do a little stylization, I think, with that.
5685662	5687003	Comes out this week on the PS3.
5687343	5689764	Bladestorm, The Hundred Years War, gets a price reduction.
5690244	5693045	Little Big Planet Karting hadn't come out in Japan until now.
5693105	5694245	It's finally coming out this week.
5694985	5714899	with that comes the move Racing Wheel and some games moving into the best series including Sengoku Musou 3 Empires because you know they loves their Dynasty Warriors on the Vita this week WRC 3 FIA World Rally Championship is the lone release this week on the PlayStation Vita
5716100	5719222	On the Wii U, nothing until January 31st.
5719282	5722604	It's pretty dry over there with new releases just like it is here.
5724405	5729728	Nothing on the 3DS either, so Nintendo's really slowed down this time of year, but same story over here, I guess.
5730128	5731249	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
5731909	5734931	Well, I would tell you if the site was actually loading.
5735372	5736272	Oh, wow.
5737913	5739274	Come on, you butthead.
5740512	5741573	Yes, I said butthead.
5741593	5742774	I called a website butthead.
5743514	5744395	I think I got it here.
5744836	5745936	No, no, no, it loaded.
5747878	5751641	On the 15th, we have Devil May Cry on the 16th, Retro City Rampage.
5752682	5755084	Yeah, that's it.
5756625	5762289	Slim pickings no matter where you live, but it's going to take a month for things to really ramp up again.
5762950	5765212	Devil May Cry is still a pretty big deal, so there you go.
5765672	5768674	Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys in the Classic Game of the Week.
5769255	5769515	Loki.
5770295	5779581	So, indie game developers are saying positive things about the Wii U eShop as opposed to what they were saying with the WiiWare service.
5780022	5791389	Apparently, Gaijin Games, Mike Rouse and Alex Noose were saying that, we don't know for sure, but it felt like that it wasn't taken seriously by Nintendo.
5791489	5795312	The desire for gamers to buy stuff digitally, and they're talking about, of course, the WiiWare service,
5795852	5804975	However, they're saying literally everything was easier this time around on the eShop.
5805876	5812918	What's more friendly right out of the starting gate is the Wii U is developed for people to have an eShop to spend their money in and buy games easily.
5815791	5816532	So, I don't know.
5816572	5818953	I mean, cool that they're doing some more stuff.
5819113	5825997	I mean, I don't know how this compares to, like, say, other platforms, but at least they're doing better than they were before.
5826558	5832781	I mean, that's like, I don't know, maybe going to the dollar store instead of Kmart.
5833222	5838365	I mean, I don't know if that's, you know, oh, well, it's not as crappy as Kmart, but...
5840200	5846179	It's still pretty crappy, but it's not as crappy, so I don't know how it really compares.
5847443	5853086	I'm still encouraged by some of these early things I'm hearing about the Wii U eShop and that maybe we're going to see some really cool things on it.
5853126	5853367	I don't know.
5853387	5860191	Do these indie developers get some preview codes so they can get them sent off for reviews, unlike the Xbox indie games?
5860571	5860931	Maybe.
5861071	5861391	I don't know.
5861451	5864954	I don't get to get those types of reviews, so I don't know.
5865354	5872238	But I can tell you I'm looking forward to the Zen pinballs coming out on the Wii U, and that looks to be really cool because they've got a Plants vs. Zombies table.
5872258	5873099	It would be neat.
5874579	5880682	Anyhow, speaking of Nintendo, one of the big stories from last year was that Nintendo Power shut down after all these years.
5881102	5885784	Well, the spirit of sorts lives on with Nintendo Force Magazine.
5886545	5891547	It is a new product from a group of Nintendo-focused journalists and artists.
5891747	5895308	Don't read into that that it was like the old Nintendo Power team, because that's not the case.
5895368	5898890	It's other types of journalists and fans from around the internet.
5899891	5926253	They have released Nintendo Force Magazine Here's the thing though, it's not your typical magazine It is one that you can get in PDF form for $5 Or you can get a collectible print for $18 I'm assuming, I'm left to assume, maybe DarkSakura knows more about this stuff than I do But I'm left to assume that probably because there isn't a huge demand for this Like, you know, it's not an international magazine or whatever It's something that's more homegrown
5926673	5935579	to kind of print these in a much smaller supply probably costs a little more money, and that's why it's going to cost you $18 to get an actual printed copy version of this.
5936080	5944045	In the first issue, though, Fire Emblem Awakening and Mutant Muds Deluxe, which is apparently a thing on 3DS or Wii U coming soon.
5944446	5944886	So there you go.
5946608	5949769	Alright, let's travel to a simpler time in games.
5949809	5954170	Let's go back to a time when, like, Nintendo Power was still around.
5954590	5965473	It's the classic game of the week, where DarkSakura's gonna step into the gaming vault, and she's gonna find a game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful brats, put down your Wii U's.
5965593	5966393	And mow my lawn.
5966894	5969134	Mow my lawn, and then maybe I'll let you play this game.
5969354	5970775	Or maybe you'll go get a phosphate.
5970975	5975496	This game isn't super old, but believe it or not, it's getting old.
5976212	5977033	That's why I picked it.
5978395	5979797	What is the classic game of the week, DarkSakura?
5979897	5980318	Silent Hill 3.
5980358	5985025	Because I've done Silent Hill 2, but I haven't done my favorite, so now I'm doing my favorite.
5985045	5991294	Yeah, and I picked the perfect thing to start off with, didn't I?
5992205	5993386	At least it wasn't wrong.
5995087	5998490	At any rate, Silent Hill 3 was done by Konami.
5998570	5999991	We all know this.
6000391	6002072	Developed by Team Silent.
6003073	6006055	And it came out in May 2003.
6006436	6010298	Now that it's, well, not quite 10 years old, but getting up to 10 years old.
6011639	6011860	So...
6014972	6015513	I can do it.
6015673	6020939	There was also a port to Windows done that I heard was absolutely wretched and haven't played yet.
6021640	6024323	And then a high def version that came out in 2012, but it's shit.
6027432	6030513	So it's 17 years after the original Silent Hill.
6032173	6039595	And basically he's raising Heather, who really isn't named Heather, but she's going by that name.
6040015	6043416	And she's got an interesting haircut and dyes her hair blonde.
6044596	6047537	She also does very interesting coordination with her jacket.
6049088	6057633	So in this one, like other Silent Hill games, there are different aspects to the game.
6057814	6061656	There is combat, you have exploration, and you have puzzle solving.
6062196	6066359	You know, as in little riddles to solve as you go through the game.
6066739	6071943	And of course, picking up maps and bonuses for doing certain things in the game the right way.
6072723	6075865	You can change the difficulty of your puzzles.
6077046	6077146	Um...
6080387	6082348	They're pretty difficult, though.
6082448	6083169	Some of them can be.
6083669	6089552	And even the really hard puzzle in that one requires that you know quite a bit of Shakespeare to solve.
6089992	6095375	You also get unlockable weapons and costume, which my favorite is the Magical Girl costume where she does Heather Beam.
6095935	6097096	Or as I say, Heza Beam!
6097716	6106060	Because even in the American version, she has a very thick Japanese accent for just that attack.
6107794	6121566	So you start off in the game at the mall and then Claudia finds out she's being stalked by a guy in a trench coat and then she goes and finds her dad.
6121766	6125389	I won't say what he's like because if you haven't played it by now he's dead.
6126470	6128292	And then she goes into Silent Hill.
6128752	6129473	Yay!
6130333	6134416	And there's like this whole plot to rebirth a god.
6134516	6139079	It has a lot to do, like I said, it's technically the sequel to the first Silent Hill.
6139379	6140520	It continues that story.
6141981	6144483	It has very, very interesting creatures in that game too.
6145243	6147264	And there's also a dude named Vincent.
6149066	6152228	Who isn't as cool as Vincent Valentine, but I won't go there.
6152771	6154992	So like I said, there's three endings.
6155112	6161593	You have the normal ending, you have a possessed ending, and the revenge ending.
6162453	6167295	Which, the revenge ending is actually the UFO ending.
6168415	6172536	That has the best Silent Hill song ever, Silent Hill no Uta.
6173743	6180126	Silent Hill, Silent Hill... Anyway, I know I've done it as a fortune cookie before, but I'm not doing it tonight.
6183027	6192292	So yeah, Silent Hill 2... Silent Hill 3, sorry, is seriously my favorite of the Silent Hill games because I love how much work went into it.
6192332	6200515	There's actually a full documentary on the making of this game that you can find on YouTube where they went all out for the voice acting.
6200716	6201296	They did...
6201816	6202737	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6227858	6240368	Like I was talking about the face models, they actually were drawn from references to real life actors and actresses so that they would look realistic.
6240688	6246753	The original name for Heather was actually Helen, but she was renamed Heather for her voice actress.
6247913	6274630	And she was modeled after a French actress, actually a couple of them, after Charlotte Gainsborough And another one that's actually very familiar to us, Vanessa Paradis Who was married to Johnny Depp for a while And did a very, very, actually a few really good songs So yeah, there was also now that Silent Hill Revelation 3D, which we were supposed to go see and never did Was based off of Silent Hill 3 There's always Blu-ray
6278959	6280479	Yeah, the Blu-ray's gotta be out really soon.
6280880	6281680	I'm totally getting it.
6281920	6282620	So yeah, there you go.
6283100	6283760	Sentinel 3.
6284180	6289502	And the source game for one of my favorite songs in DDR Extreme US.
6291222	6294263	Oh, the, um... You're not here.
6294283	6295584	Like, I can sing it, I don't know the name.
6295604	6297924	It was really good, the video and everything else, really good chart.
6297944	6301205	That was one of the better things to come out of Extreme US.
6301665	6305507	Not that that was a bad game, all things considered, minus the crappy disc wheel.
6305687	6307067	It was a really, really good game.
6307327	6308748	There is your classic game of the week.
6309229	6310650	And classic DDR reference of the week.
6310670	6311371	Yes, exactly.
6311391	6313613	Well, we have DDR references coming up in Part B tonight.
6314434	6315255	So don't go anywhere.
6315415	6318498	We got more Orange Launch Radio to come, including, apparently, a DDR reference.
6319238	6323262	Fugle Question of the Week, Rapid Fire News, your emails and your phone calls.
6323322	6325985	All when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio.
6332188	6339834	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live with episode number 489 of our show for this January the 13th of 2013.
6341055	6348901	Myself, Loki, and DarkSakura are joined in studio tonight with Jason and Rye who are visiting from Colorado as they have been.
6349241	6354705	And Jason, of course, I always like to acknowledge that without Jason we wouldn't have an OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6355085	6358668	So thank you to Jason for all the work he does with that.
6359228	6359409	Always.
6360089	6366233	During the break, usually we don't talk about the break music because we can't play it due to copyright reasons.
6366273	6369556	But I've got to give a plug to this guy so the podcasters can seek him out too.
6369836	6372198	Because that remix that we played was great.
6372318	6374499	So please give this guy a plug here where everybody can hear it.
6374719	6376881	Aethernaut's original works are on Bandcamp.
6377121	6382285	Aethernaut.Bandcamp.com A-E-T-H-E-R-N-A-U-T.Bandcamp.com

6425035	6428557	I should let you pick the break music every week.
6428657	6430657	Who discovered Aethernaut?
6431638	6432818	It was basically mutual.
6432918	6436319	We went to a chiptune showcase.
6436359	6439140	We were both there and we were both like, fuck yeah, dude.
6439681	6444462	And it was mine that I was playing while we were doing stuff before the show over here.
6444822	6446803	She was the one that actually had music running.
6447103	6448344	She got it introduced to me.
6448564	6450825	She'll get credit for that one.
6450845	6451965	You guys have good taste.
6452326	6453250	Alright, let's move on.
6453671	6454716	Rapid Fire News time.
6454897	6456403	Some quick news stories, starting off with Loki.
6457768	6459149	All right, so this is kind of cool.
6459189	6467494	They have this mod for Minecraft, and it allows someone to actually connect multiple worlds together.
6467814	6474098	Now, they have this before where you can create multiple worlds in Minecraft, but this is actually unifying servers.
6474759	6477921	And the guy that developed this, what was it?
6478381	6486546	I guess it's the MD5 proxy system, which is now called Bungee Cord, if you look for it on Bucket,
6487226	6489547	Basically, he has it set up now.
6489607	6494248	He's got a server with a lobby that allows 2,000 people in there.
6494728	6502531	And instead of searching for Minecraft servers and stuff that might be full, you go into this lobby and you pick a server out of there and you get all the information.
6502611	6512954	So it's almost like an MMO now where you can hop in and out of these servers and go with your friends and say, Hey, I'm going to go build on the VOG Minecraft server right now and then...
6513374	6517377	Let's hop out and we're going to go to a server that's running the Hunger Games minigame stuff.
6517457	6522901	Or, hey, I want to run to a server that's doing survival or something like that instead of creative.
6523242	6525403	And you can do that, which is pretty awesome.
6525443	6527505	So it's out there.
6528285	6534630	Not something I'm going to run on our Minecraft server because we have enough trouble filling up one server, let alone multiple servers.
6535631	6537632	And our server is whitelist only, which is important.
6537733	6540475	But I think that makes it very attractive to play on because you don't get griefers.
6541135	6543916	because if any of our listeners turn into griefers, I will beat you.
6545197	6550379	And also, it's logging whatever you do, so we will find you.
6550599	6551840	Don't be afraid to have fun.
6551980	6552580	Yeah, exactly.
6552660	6556422	I have rules listed, but come on.
6556582	6560063	It's just like, I'll let you do whatever as long as you don't fuck up someone else's shit.
6561144	6561984	Do I have a sign now?
6563665	6564885	In my little prairie dog town?
6564905	6567166	I don't even know where you are, so I haven't added you yet.
6567906	6568947	I live in a prairie dog town.
6569747	6573289	Well, once I find you, I'll add you or I'll show you how to do it.
6573449	6575010	I'll put nasty notes in front of your house.
6576171	6577072	My house is underground.
6577092	6579793	Which means you'll have to log in and finish your house.
6580014	6580454	Uber.
6581134	6582835	Can we make it snow in her house?
6583376	6584696	No, because my house is underground.
6586017	6587999	My doors are covered in glass.
6588659	6590420	Can I get lava to flow through her house?
6590840	6591321	No.
6591361	6592301	That's griefing.
6593102	6594443	You can make it snow in her house, actually.
6594643	6595223	Ah, there we go.
6595283	6596744	No snow in my house.
6597304	6598025	We're not going to.
6598533	6601223	My house is going to be constantly evolving which is why I'm building it underground.
6602182	6603463	About fucking time.
6629019	6634955	I mean, I guess they had to scrap all their plans when they rebuilt the whole fucking PSN a few years ago, but Jesus...
6635436	6659504	and then finally there's another bundle that you might be interested in this is called the free bundle and basically regardless of what you might want to pay for this bundle it's free and you can pick up five games from thefreebundle.com and these games are Nitronic Rush which is a cool survival driving game, Abobo's Big Adventure, yes that's right Abobo from
6660598	6661159	Downloaded it.
6661519	6663120	Yes, from Double Dragon.
6663881	6666083	And also, let's see, Ascension.
6666503	6669706	It's a side-scroller horror game, a celestial mechanica.
6670567	6677192	And see, that's, I guess, has some animation done by SuperCrateBox, Paul Veer.
6677753	6684158	And then I'm Scared, which they say is a self-professed Minecraft meets Slender game.
6685539	6686440	I was looking at it.
6686580	6687181	I didn't want it.
6688154	6690654	But they're all free for a limited amount of time.
6690694	6691135	Were you scared?
6692255	6693715	No, I was apathetic.
6694255	6698756	So the free bundle, in case the humble bundle is too expensive for you.
6698876	6700476	You know what the free bundle needs more of?
6700696	6701596	Because this game's free?
6702116	6702877	Frog Fractions.
6703117	6705877	Just saying.
6706057	6708557	And look, they added another game to the free bundle.
6708737	6710318	Now they have Treasure Adventure Island.
6710498	6711718	Or Treasure Venture Game.
6712398	6714218	So, that's cool.
6714719	6715779	Go download it for free.
6715999	6716839	And it's up for another 32 days.
6719264	6719404	XBOX 360
6737781	6739323	Buy it, send pictures, please.
6739443	6740523	Well, there's a little picture here.
6740544	6746388	I mean, this is more of a render, but it actually has like the little Xbox stripe along the bottom and it's like that green color or what have you.
6748830	6755475	If you buy this, by the way, should you buy the Volkswagen Xbox 360, you get an Xbox 360 with a copy of Forza 4.
6755575	6756216	What a deal.
6756736	6764543	Wow, Forza from like not 2012, but from the year before that, which I think is like a packing game now in some of their systems.
6766766	6770047	Earlier, somebody brought up Bayonetta, probably because you were talking about the Anarchy Reigns.
6770887	6785091	But Bayonetta, a lot of demand for Bayonetta to show up on the Wii U eShop because of the fact that Bayonetta 2 is going to turn up on Wii U, and people aren't necessarily going to be familiar with it unless they had a 360 or a PlayStation 3 and played through that.
6786112	6792794	So Platinum Games designer Hideki Kamiya was asked on Twitter, will the original Bayonetta come to Wii U?
6793354	6794054	And the response...
6794634	6798121	It's up to Sega or Ninty, which is Twitter speak for Nintendo.
6798903	6803332	So apparently it is completely up to Sega and Nintendo if that's going to happen or not.
6803392	6804174	So no pressure.
6804294	6804755	Make it happen.
6805083	6805603	Not gonna happen.
6806043	6806924	Not gonna happen, I agree.
6808204	6808904	One more story.
6808984	6818267	I had a few friends that were talking about this, and I thought this sounded really cool, and I watched a little bit of it, but not as much as like Flaco Jones and some other people I know that listen to the show.
6818687	6824829	It was the third annual Awesome Games Done Quick Marathon, raised more than $327,000 raised during this marathon.
6824909	6827030	I didn't see what, did I miss, what charity did that go for?
6836215	6836595	I want to know.
6836615	6837495	That's the most important part.
6837595	6839116	Oh, Prevent Cancer Foundation.
6839196	6840296	Oh, that's a very worthy cause.
6840336	6840696	Good job.
6841536	6843677	They played through more than 120 titles.
6844297	6846457	Everything from Skyrim to Echo the Dolphin.
6847198	6847738	Good times.
6848518	6854419	The viewers were also able to bid on items, make donations, and leave comments that could have possibly been read on air.
6855540	6857880	Lots of good stuff that they played through, and they did them quickly.
6859521	6860521	It's not just a clever name.
6860741	6863061	Yoshi's Island in almost 100% in like three hours.
6865810	6875846	They did games that don't take necessarily that long to beat, like Mario 64, because you could run through that without getting all the stars, although I don't know if they did 100% completion or whatever.
6876107	6877569	And then they did Final Fantasy IX.
6878531	6878992	Good lord.
6880438	6881639	How do you do an RPG quick?
6910353	6913417	Put Facebook and Google together and you get Google.
6913858	6921367	And that's the inspiration for this segment of our show where we ask a question of our listeners on Facebook and Google Plus fan communities.
6922549	6925112	And we read some of our favorite answers here on the air.
6925973	6926854	Here's the question this week.
6928780	6936367	There's been a lot of talk the past couple weeks about the potential and speculative, emphasis on that, negative influence that video games have on society.
6936708	6939390	But let's take a moment to talk about the good.
6940091	6944155	What are some of the good things that video games have done for you in your life?
6944275	6948539	I wanted to offset all this negativity going around this week about violent video games.
6948679	6949580	I want to hear the good stuff.
6950001	6951782	Let's give the media this to report on.
6951802	6952123	They won't.
6953860	6956808	On Google+, some of the good things that video games have done for you.
6956948	6959394	Actdeft, I'll summarize my answer in one word.
6960036	6960677	Inspire.
6963326	6972474	Flaco Jones says, my wife and I had video games in common at the early stages of our relationship and they continue to be a positive thing we bond over to this day.
6973034	6974015	That's really cute.
6974035	6976137	Kind of like Jamie and Dan.
6976157	6977478	You're a month early, Flaco.
6977538	6979320	It's a lot like us.
6979500	6980601	Even Alan and I do that.
6981081	6982983	We level characters together and wow.
6986206	6987227	We met over DDR.
6987387	6988608	Me and Ryan met over DDR.
6989983	6993425	But yet in Loki's relationship, that doesn't end up being the case, really.
6993865	6994485	No, not at all.
6995426	6997467	It just goes to show you everybody's a little bit different.
6998728	6999068	All right.
7000240	7001041	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7024237	7029842	Redertainment says, video games fill a role in my life that other people fill with movies, TV, books, music, etc.
7029902	7031463	Video games ever entertain me.
7031904	7033385	Video games also save me money.
7033485	7039350	Think about how much entertainment you get per dollar with a 40 hour long video game as opposed to a 2-4 hour long movie.
7040931	7041792	That's a very good answer.
7041912	7043313	And then think of a book and a weep.
7044394	7044694	Alright.
7047376	7048978	I love this answer in our chat room.
7049398	7051860	Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room.
7052594	7056278	Video games let me meet all you wonderful people as well as Actdeft.
7057999	7058260	Ouch!
7060281	7060522	Ouch!
7063324	7064746	I've got my stuff up, by the way.
7086965	7100281	when I have a long day at work and get home I first greet my family and spend time with them but if it's a crazy stressful day I play video games a bit to de-stress it's the same as a person who reads a book or watches their favorite shows it calms them down and brings them to a better level
7101458	7106140	AZHP responds and says, Video games introduced me to pretty much all the friends I have now in one way or another.
7106460	7118586	When I decided to start playing DDR, I could have never have guessed that it would lead to me meeting a group of like-minded people who accepted me for who I am and created lifelong friendships that have lasted for as long as this show has been running.
7119606	7119946	It's true.
7119966	7122047	Without video games, I wouldn't have this show.
7122487	7124028	I probably wouldn't be podcasting.
7124408	7124748	I don't know.
7124868	7127209	I like the sound of my voice so much, though.
7127249	7129931	I would have discovered podcasting through another hobby, but...
7130951	7131431	Who knows?
7132112	7135073	I don't actually like hearing my own voice, so that's why I don't listen to us.
7135894	7136174	Really?
7136454	7137155	Yeah, that's true.
7137715	7140717	I think that's why I was so timid, especially last time I was here.
7141557	7145039	The tough thing, though, about it is that I'm my own worst critic.
7145219	7153764	I don't hate to hear my own voice, but I'll listen to myself and I'll go, Oh, you sound so... What the hell were we talking about?
7154424	7155585	No, I'm actually...
7157386	7159507	But anyway, let's see, more answers.
7159667	7165149	Wendy S., I think video games have taught me about the sports whose games I play, FIFA, NBA 2K.
7165529	7168310	They also keep your mind and reflexes sharp as you grow older.
7168750	7175793	I honestly believe due to video games, there will be less dementia among seniors in the future if you assume current gamers will keep playing as they age.
7176333	7184216	Finally, I wanted to note that I think when teenagers attain positions of responsibility in their guild or clan, it teaches them leadership and responsibility.
7185607	7192091	I like the angle that it keeps your certain skills up so that when you get old, you don't lose them.
7192212	7193973	We see this a lot.
7194053	7200457	Well, I don't know how much you guys go to old folks' homes, but they do like Wii bowling and that stuff is still something they do.
7200577	7208902	And a lot of that is to, I mean, we might laugh, like play a better game, old guy, but it kind of still keeps all that function going.
7208962	7209122	Yeah.
7210303	7214005	My grandma's in one of those places and I was looking at the calendar and they had Wii Bowling Night every Monday.
7214025	7215045	It was something else.
7216065	7218266	I wasn't laughing at you.
7218306	7219847	I was laughing at a comment in chat.
7220027	7221227	What was the comment that made you laugh?
7221347	7221768	Who said it?
7222188	7224449	Ragenator says, I agree with Rob Roberts.
7224649	7226449	He does love the sound of his own voice.
7226670	7227510	I'm sexy, damn it.
7228590	7230130	Not as much as I love Dubstep Bird.
7230571	7230831	All right.
7230991	7233511	I closed the window.
7233631	7233931	Damn it.
7233991	7234211	All right.
7234751	7244113	James S replies and says, I know I've read somewhere lately that there were a few scientific tests done by a university that had proven that gaming actually strengthened your brain in areas that are vital for everyday life.
7244573	7247734	Anything from basic motor skills to depth perception to decision making.
7248094	7250515	Games aren't the culprit for these random acts of violence.
7250655	7251915	Violence has always been there.
7252035	7252795	Gaming hasn't.
7253174	7267567	It's just that some people are sick and need help Simple as that You know, that's a really damn good way of looking at it Violence has always been there Gaming hasn't Although one could argue You know, chess has been around a long time But I get what you're saying I totally get what you're saying, dude That's a good point
7268969	7273052	DarkTetsuya says, even before you guys started OLR, there was a time?
7275334	7281899	Even before you guys started OLR, I met you guys via the epic music game Parties that were thrown back in early 2000.
7281939	7284361	Not gonna lie, I miss those days.
7284661	7288324	Playing Beatmania 2DX till the sun came up the next day, good times.
7289108	7293069	Oh, how many days we had like that, right, Jason?
7293569	7295530	Do you still have a lot of those old games, DarkSakura?
7296090	7298551	I have every single Bimani game I've ever purchased.
7298651	7304272	You know, one of these days, for old time's sake, we need to have... That should be the freaking game marathon.
7304933	7306713	Have an old school... Our pajama party?
7306973	7307673	All night long.
7307953	7308634	Our pajama party?
7308754	7308974	Oh, yeah.
7309014	7311134	We're not supposed to talk about that on air.
7311154	7312395	Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
7313755	7317037	Put Ixnay on the Illopipe Fae.
7317498	7318638	I didn't say anything about that.
7318818	7319119	Okay.
7319739	7319959	I know.
7320219	7320459	Anyway.
7320740	7322561	I think we should do a drunk DDR Fest.
7323441	7324322	That'd be awesome.
7324362	7330326	I've played DDR drunk before and I nearly busted my head open on somebody's clothes washer.
7331801	7332502	Thank you for watching!
7350515	7354656	All right, anyways, yeah, so, yeah, DDR, well, I have two DDR pads.
7354696	7358877	I think I sold the game, so, but I sold the pads that have never been used.
7359457	7360377	They're still there.
7361137	7362098	I wonder what else is in it.
7362178	7363378	Oh, I also dug through the closet.
7363458	7373640	I have a lot more game, like, main cabinet buttons and stuff from when I was going to make, you know, all the Bomani, you know, controllers and stuff for it.
7374200	7375921	I have a ton of crap in there.
7375941	7377041	It's ridiculous.
7379375	7381837	We have a full-size pop-in controller still.
7381898	7384360	We have, I think, four 2DX controllers.
7384720	7386181	Yeah, it should be two American, two Japanese.
7388624	7393588	You know, I actually found an official Konami PlayStation dance pad at the thrift store.
7395210	7396891	I got a DDR story coming up.
7396931	7399774	We can reminisce more, but I want to get to what more listeners said.
7400242	7402423	Okay, just let me know when I can read my rapid fire.
7402523	7403723	We'll get to it, I promise.
7404163	7404523	Okay.
7405023	7408964	See, all I did is I just switched that with that and we'll just keep going.
7408985	7409205	All right.
7409825	7411125	Live radio, it's an adventure.
7411645	7422248	Burr replies and says, Video games have taught me history, given me an appreciation for music and art, introduced me to friends around the world, and inspired my imagination for almost 30 years now.
7422728	7427930	What has watching endless cable television news and punditry done for the people on the other side of the table?
7428510	7429991	Here, here.
7430051	7430632	Comedians?
7431092	7435035	That was the appropriate level of bitchiness that an answer needs.
7436055	7436516	Frame it.
7436616	7437256	Cut, print.
7437636	7439217	That's a great answer.
7439478	7440778	All these answers are so good tonight.
7441419	7442119	I'm reading them all.
7442259	7442760	I don't care.
7442980	7443861	This show's running long.
7443921	7444321	I don't care.
7444461	7445241	We'll do it live.
7445422	7446082	Yeah, fuck it.
7446102	7446642	We'll do it live.
7446702	7447183	Ragenator.
7447803	7449304	Well, here's three ways they help me.
7449765	7453507	One, in terms of games like first-person shooters, Call of Duty, Halo, they help me vent.
7453827	7456909	If I'm pissed off at whomever, it's better to take it out virtually.
7456949	7457210	Whom?
7458237	7458657	Awesome!
7459838	7464160	It's better to take it out virtually, rather IRL, for a whole host of reasons.
7464500	7472945	Two, gaming serves as a social outlet, contrary to what older generations would have you believe, and online gaming is a lot cheaper than other things, such as a night out drinking with friends.
7473085	7473605	Thank you!
7473685	7474465	Ain't that the truth.
7475786	7477447	Do you know how much drinks cost at the bar?
7478171	7478451	Yes.
7478991	7483194	For like, I could get a Long Island iced tea top shelf or a month of WoW.
7483614	7484014	I get it.
7484114	7484475	I get it.
7484855	7495621	Three, online gaming gives you an opportunity to meet other people that odds are you wouldn't otherwise meet or conversely, it, like Facebook, helps you maintain friendships with those that move out of your area.
7496101	7499143	Unlike Facebook, though, one can do more than talk via text.
7499683	7500284	Thank you.
7501604	7502125	Welcome.
7502525	7502826	All right.
7503266	7504027	That was for Ragenator.
7504528	7504789	All right.
7504849	7508934	Tiger Claw says, Video games have been a part of my life ever since I was a kid.
7509415	7512900	I know for a fact that you should never, ever take video games seriously.
7513220	7517687	They provided me with hours of entertainment and also great during times when you're feeling down or bored.
7519520	7526826	Gamer Girl says, I suffer from major depressive disorder, and ever since I was a kid, it's been my way to shut things out until I'm ready to deal with them.
7526846	7527867	This is a heavy answer.
7528428	7533172	It's like a way for me to be someone else for a while until I'm ready to deal with what's going on.
7533532	7537395	And not only that, but it helped my reflexes as a kid due to being disabled.
7537775	7541619	So it's always helped me deal with real life in some way or another and always good.
7547188	7548949	Why don't they fucking read that on Fox News?
7549629	7552011	Because it doesn't suit their agenda.
7554332	7558174	Sorry, I just had this moment of like... I'm angry now.
7558434	7560475	I'm not angry at you, Gamer Girl.
7560515	7561916	I think you're great.
7561956	7565357	That answer is just so powerful.
7565838	7566318	It's like...
7568627	7569469	I just, I'm speechless.
7569549	7570771	It bears repeating, doesn't it?
7570911	7573235	You got, Gamer Girl, you got me to shut up.
7573496	7574237	Congratulations.
7574417	7575399	You got me to shut up with that.
7575419	7576661	I've been trying that for years.
7579881	7605149	Lastly, DDR Dollar Bill If it wasn't for DDR, I wouldn't have become more social and outgoing This is heavy stuff, guys Too long to tell this story, but the game was responsible for reigniting my desire for dancing and music I do love gaming, though I do want a future where games are more interactive Waits for the usual crap about go play football or some other sport Just not where the game is bad A fighting game that you actually have to move?
7605489	7605669	Ha!
7606189	7608250	Well, the holodeck's only a matter of time away
7609048	7626179	I read every single answer tonight You don't have to visit Facebook or Google Those are all great answers Maybe there'll be some late coming answers later You should still join our communities on Facebook Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio And Google Plus Search for Orange Lounge Radio Alright Want to know what my answer to that one is?
7626599	7632963	Please And it's very specific Please Super Mario RPG taught me rhythm Before anything else did
7634249	7634870	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7655871	7658994	The first time I tried it, AB, AB, AB, AB, mash the buttons.
7659214	7660795	Why isn't it doing anything?
7661496	7668261	And one of the Yoshis gives you a hint or something like that, talks about that you go with the backbeat of the song.
7668342	7668582	It's like...
7670060	7670300	All that.
7670641	7672643	Alternate in time and your Yoshi runs away.
7673123	7677108	And it was just like the simplest thing, but that was what really sealed the deal.
7677448	7688540	And, you know, music games came along after the fact to really turn that into its own little world, but that was the first time that music had something specific instead of just being...
7689341	7690423	The art as it is.
7691284	7692806	It's really the only way that I can describe it.
7692846	7700396	I remember that very distinctly, that things just felt different after an example of the backbeat in Super Mario RPG.
7702608	7705309	For me, video games gave me this.
7705869	7706649	I mean, for real.
7706909	7708169	I know we joked about it a minute ago.
7708229	7709090	Video games gave me this.
7709170	7713911	And this is almost an extension of when I was growing up, I got picked on a lot.
7714051	7714751	Can't imagine why.
7715131	7720032	But for real, guys, I got called fag and all those dirty words you can possibly imagine a lot.
7720452	7724373	And then it's like those same kids would turn around and ask me for advice on video games.
7724453	7726214	Like, how do I get to the second quest in Zelda?
7726354	7727974	Or how do I find level nine in the second quest?
7728394	7730856	Like, you know, come meet me behind the building.
7731277	7735520	You know, like that type of thing where it's like, I don't want the other kids to see that I'm talking to you, but I know you're the video game expert.
7736141	7739984	It's like, and in some ways, this is almost an extension of that.
7740064	7741946	I'm still talking to people about video games.
7742266	7748171	I might not be as good at them as I used to be, but here I am with a bunch of, like, awesome, like-minded people.
7748431	7748852	It's just...
7749904	7750404	I know.
7751145	7751705	I know, I know.
7751725	7752566	Especially you, Jamie.
7752746	7753466	Especially me.
7754827	7759791	Well, and an extension on the inspiration part, it has me writing, it has me drawing.
7760431	7763093	You know, there's so much that it brings.
7764754	7765755	Yeah, go read a book.
7765795	7767016	A book will do the same thing.
7767756	7774000	But I think just the visual part of it, having somebody else's characters that you can kind of run free with kind of helps too.
7775902	7776362	Absolutely.
7776422	7777883	Original works, original inspirations.
7778649	7779170	DERBY OWNERS CLUB
7799508	7801789	I missed Derby Owners Club.
7801829	7803330	They got rid of the one at Dave & Buster's.
7804210	7804910	Our local one.
7805070	7806111	I didn't see it last time I was there.
7806271	7808212	Do you still have your card with your horse named Glue?
7808232	7809472	I have my binder.
7809772	7811253	Yeah, I do have a horse named Glue.
7812293	7813154	You had Politary.
7813854	7814955	So you could whip Politary.
7815975	7818276	Politary is sad because Rob beat her too hard.
7819345	7827607	Anyway, so Lego Marvel Super Heroes is going to be coming out and I'm very happy.
7828087	7834729	It's got an original storyline where Nick Fury needs the help of Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and other heroes to stop Loki and Galactus.
7835109	7837689	That's a team I would never have seen together, Loki and Galactus.
7838289	7844711	I would think Galactus would be too busy eating planets to deal with the Norse god whose planet he wants to eat.
7846602	7851112	Also next up, Capcom Arcade Cabinet has been confirmed for the West.
7851673	7851733	Ooh.
7854572	7856333	Dan will be happy.
7856373	7857194	Dan will be really happy.
7857214	7857394	Capcom.
7857414	7857614	Capcom.
7879554	7884756	And then, last but not least, LittleBigPlanet 2 Extras Edition is announced.
7885637	7892140	And it will have the recently released cross-controller pack.
7892740	7897082	So let's use the Vita as a controller and the move pack, Rise of the Cakeling.
7898123	7900084	And all kinds of fun stuff.
7900504	7903345	However, I don't believe it has what date it's going to be out on.
7904646	7905346	So yeah, that's it.
7906963	7907323	All right.
7908143	7910964	And now I've got more stuff to do, don't I?
7911084	7912044	No, we're going to Loki next.
7912224	7913204	Well, I've got stuff to do.
7914545	7915385	Soon, soon.
7915825	7916005	Yes.
7916585	7929848	So there was, of course, this lawsuit in place from Gamefly who was saying they were getting unfair treatment for their packages going out.
7930308	7932449	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7953677	7967702	and so it actually they ruled in favor of Gamefly and basically told you know the US Postal Service that hey you guys need to either fix this or you need to let us know you know
7968542	7969723	Tell us, what's going on?
7970043	7970884	Why are you guys doing this?
7971064	7979349	I mean, it's obvious that, you know, they're doing this stuff and, you know, these companies aren't paying you any extra money to have this preferential treatment.
7979609	7982051	Now, you either got to do it for everybody or do it for no one.
7982451	7984432	So, interesting.
7987274	7990436	Hopefully, that means less broken DVDs in the mail.
7990496	7990816	I don't know.
7990856	7995219	Have you ever gotten anything from, you know, Gamefly that was smashed?
7995419	7995619	No.
7996080	7996560	Yeah, so...
7997071	7998632	Everything's worked fine for me.
7998992	8002874	Maybe it's just like more metropolitan areas where there's a lot more mail.
8003574	8003874	Maybe.
8004855	8006415	I live in an apartment complex.
8006455	8009377	It's not like they handle the mail totally well around here sometimes.
8011061	8011501	It works.
8013241	8015122	Moving on, I promised you some DDR talk.
8015162	8015642	Here you go.
8015742	8020603	Dance Dance Revolution Classroom Edition made an appearance at CES this year.
8021143	8024224	Konami and United Healthcare Group teaming up to bring this.
8024284	8027985	I thought that was kind of an interesting partnership between Konami and an insurance company.
8028625	8031405	But they brought the game to the show to show it off.
8032186	8036567	I got to tell you what surprised me about it is that it was neat kind of seeing like new DDR.
8036667	8037867	And I was looking at it going...
8038747	8040908	Why did they, like, stop the console editions?
8040948	8042869	Like, this is an interesting direction that they were going.
8042909	8045670	I mean, granted, DDR is DDR, but I thought it was kind of cool.
8045790	8048091	I mean, 48 people can play this game at once.
8048131	8051272	That's like two PE classes or depending on whatever school you go to, right?
8051952	8057835	And you look at it and they've got one, you know, one tunnel or what do you call that?
8058115	8060556	The area where the notes scroll up.
8060696	8061897	Did they ever have a term for that?
8062637	8062717	The...
8063297	8079413	scroll bar whatever the area where the notes scroll up there's three of them one for beginners intermediates and advanced all at the same time so I'm assuming that means that people who aren't as good as DDR can play like the beginner ones and people who are getting better can play the advanced ones so everybody can kind of play together I thought that was kind of neat
8080713	8092796	Apparently, the wireless dance pads are made by Performance Design Products, and they can actually track a dancer's progress, steps, body mass index, and how many calories you burn through what is a plug-in smart card.
8092877	8094437	BMI is still bullshit.
8094737	8101899	Then why is a PDP putting these out then for consumers to buy if they're making some decent dance pads, you know what I mean?
8102579	8106522	I know, I was kind of looking at it going, this is something I wouldn't mind having in my house, actually.
8106882	8108823	I could play with people over the internet or something.
8110384	8116447	Konami has launched this game three schools in Florida, Georgia, and Texas, I guess are the test ground for this.
8118288	8126113	There is a whole video, it looks like Polygon actually did an interview on the floor with some of the people that were showing it, so you can check that out at Polygon.com.
8126133	8127814	They actually have a whole little video in their section.
8128414	8129995	and yeah, it was kind of neat to look at.
8130895	8132796	It made me miss the dinner days a little bit.
8133376	8133656	It did.
8134156	8136657	There's a lot that's really interesting about that concept that makes sense.
8136797	8144120	It throws out all of these expected mechanisms of DDR out the window that who gives two shits about accuracy?
8144180	8150283	Pick whatever is interesting for you, change on the fly and the important part of what you have to do is still available.
8150463	8155925	You're still on a dance pad, you're still moving around, you're still doing something and getting that sort of feedback
8156525	8158046	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8180662	8188145	The only thing I don't like about it is you can't tell, you drift on those types of pads when you can't tell where the actual arrows are versus everything else.
8188645	8193327	But it would still be nice to buy one, you know, if it's going to work pretty well.
8193407	8197789	Obviously, if you're using it in a PE class, it's got to work somewhat okay.
8197849	8203311	And hell, I mean, we played on soft pads attached to a piece of wood with laminate over the top of them.
8203772	8207273	I mean, I'm assuming that that would work.
8208414	8209274	It worked okay then.
8210598	8216023	Yeah, they did look like the ignition pads to me because from a distance I thought they were metal pads and I was like, damn, this thing's going to be expensive.
8216103	8227093	But yeah, it was more the big, fluffy, but thick, those pads that Red Octane used to do before they got into Guitar Hero business.
8227733	8228174	There you go.
8229254	8229595	All right.
8231087	8232028	So, moving on.
8232048	8235590	Did your computer go boom again?
8236651	8238352	All right, so let's move on to the next.
8238392	8239893	Let's just skip it and come back to it, Loki.
8240634	8240934	All right.
8244568	8249852	Let's see, we've got an interesting patent for PlayStation.
8249873	8254096	Man, what is with PlayStation coming out with some really strange-ass patents?
8254577	8256898	But this one now, they've got a patent for the Move.
8256959	8258700	It looks like a new Move controller.
8259481	8264325	And the differences with the new controller versus the old one...
8264925	8267886	One that's going to have some sort of interchangeable faceplates.
8267926	8277368	So, for example, you can have the four directional buttons on there or you can have the XO square triangle buttons.
8278368	8282029	Also, it kind of looks like an ice cream scoop almost.
8282930	8284610	Well, they look like them anyway.
8284930	8285430	Yeah.
8286070	8292172	But instead of having the buttons actually on the side of the pad, it kind of like your hand would be behind the ball, I guess.
8292192	8292332	Yeah.
8292772	8311654	and then what's also weird about it is they've got these foot attachment things and then in the most ridiculous image for a patent ever they have some dude with like four move controllers because I'm gonna really buy four move controllers for $40 each doing a fucking like flip kick for a soccer game
8312645	8315047	He's got those things attached to his shoes.
8315167	8315867	That is nuts.
8316067	8319209	Yes, like, I mean, that's just fucking ridiculous.
8319349	8320110	No one's going to do that.
8320130	8321150	You're going to kill yourself.
8322151	8323772	And then we're going to see that on Fox News.
8323812	8330456	Video gamer kills self while playing FIFA, attempting to do a flip kick, hits, you know, coffee table, dies.
8330476	8334139	Or how about kicks the 80-inch television right off the wall.
8334219	8335840	Or somebody else nearby.
8335860	8342064	You know, kickboxing game, move controller flies off foot, some weird shit happens.
8342344	8344866	Gamer loses leg in freak accident kicking fan.
8344966	8346386	Let's just put it this way, okay?
8346827	8354972	I don't know why they're having some sort of... This is the patent, but I hope that, God, this is not... This isn't what they're bringing for PlayStation 4.
8355072	8355432	Hey!
8355812	8357013	You like those move controllers?
8357053	8357673	Well, guess what?
8358134	8360515	We're gonna strap them to every orifice of your body.
8362456	8363057	That's right.
8363077	8365258	We're gonna track all of those naughty bits.
8365678	8369419	Does this really solve the very first instances of this?
8369699	8376301	Sony recently filed a patent that describes a method for determining the location of a PlayStation Move-like controller through a sound capturing device.
8376901	8382983	If it's obscured by something in the way, like a body, if you're spinning, if you're moving, does sound really solve the problem?
8384525	8386005	That's how they do it right now.
8386025	8398289	It uses sound, I think, for part of it because they've got so many microphones in the actual PlayStation Eye camera that I thought that's what it was using.
8398309	8399309	I thought it was just light.
8400489	8404771	A special wavelength that the camera can see a rotation difference.
8404791	8406111	It's a little bit of both, I think.
8407011	8411232	I do know that for voice or something, it's supposed to be able to track you or track something.
8411392	8413773	It's got like five microphones in that thing.
8414073	8420219	I could just see Kazariety3 talking about, you know, now on the PlayStation 4 it comes with four move controllers.
8420539	8421861	Let me show you a demo now.
8422221	8425444	I will take one controller and put them in each hand and I will shake them up and down.
8425845	8429548	Then I will insert the third move controller into my mouth where I will rock back and forth.
8429928	8432171	The fourth move controller I will shove into my anus.
8434864	8436006	Let's play SingStar.
8437067	8438289	Let's play SingStar.
8441033	8444077	Take on me.
8444417	8445519	Take on me.
8446172	8447612	It just, I mean, I'm sorry.
8448793	8449753	Oh, big!
8450013	8450433	Okay, I got it.
8450453	8451113	Here's the thing, okay.
8451673	8466236	The move controller, it's, I think the move is not that bad, but, you know, what they're showing with this patent here is basically, you know, they're saying that the controller's got some, you know, the swappable face buttons and stuff, and that, you know, I don't know.
8466256	8470017	I don't think they really know much other than looking at the pictures, but those controllers look a little weird.
8471277	8473499	And I know they've tried the leg strap stuff.
8473539	8475220	Hell, they've tried that with the Wii.
8475460	8482164	And I know they have some fitness games where you can get a leg strap so they can tell that you're running or something like that.
8482705	8491230	But I guess this thing was a determination of controller three-dimensional location using image analysis and ultrasonic communication.
8491310	8494912	So I thought that's how it worked already, though.
8495413	8499175	I mean, I don't understand what they would be doing differently in this one.
8501024	8503206	Thank you, SSJ100Matt, for getting my reference.
8503266	8506168	It's Mr. Garrison's gyro cycle thing in that episode of South Park.
8506188	8509450	That's exactly what I was thinking about with the whole PlayStation Move patent.
8510711	8511552	Don't watch it, wouldn't know.
8511712	8514594	Anyhow, it's for the best, Jason, that you don't watch it.
8514734	8516295	All right, moving on.
8517396	8520098	Let's go back to what we had to skip over.
8520118	8520238	Jamie.
8520258	8520438	Jamie.
8521255	8524717	Okay, more news about the Ouya, actually.
8525537	8531700	Basically, they've figured out that since it already runs Android games, it will run emulated games, too.
8531780	8539044	So people who already have Ouya boards are basically putting up videos that show them playing Street Fighter.
8539944	8542446	Street Fighter and Mario 64 are already running on the Ouya.
8543386	8544807	I think I said this on this show.
8545007	8547368	When we bought our Wii, you know what the very first thing was that I did?
8547628	8548008	Emulate?
8548389	8548769	Played Mario 64.
8551315	8552796	A very yes to this.
8552896	8554136	I am so excited, actually.
8554176	8555597	Emulators might sell me to you.
8555977	8556878	And?
8556998	8558499	Based on the video, they run well.
8558859	8559720	Yeah, the video was nice.
8559780	8560540	I looked at it, too.
8561921	8562721	All I have to say?
8562741	8568044	Oh, yeah.
8568965	8569585	Y'all right over there?
8569885	8572727	Do you need a move controller to enhance the experience?
8574248	8576849	I get the Mario 64 song stuck in my head and it lasts.
8576889	8577570	It doesn't go away.
8585405	8586686	I hope it runs the 64 games.
8586706	8589408	That means I can play F-Zero even though I can kind of... You know what that means?
8590288	8591589	It means Macross Crystal Dreams.
8593391	8594812	Because that game only exists emulated.
8597870	8601974	and Star Fox 2 if it'll do SNES emulation.
8602214	8602574	Star Fox 2.
8602774	8603535	You know what else it means?
8604135	8608939	Yet another emulator with the most unworkable controller for the system with the most unworkable controller.
8609320	8609560	Yes!
8609740	8610761	Here it is running on the OUYA.
8618322	8620204	Multiplayer GoldenEye over the internet.
8620604	8622747	Yeah, that should be Android possible.
8622867	8623888	Come on.
8625770	8626751	Moving on, where are we at?
8626871	8629434	Oh, speaking of virtual console, what a nice transition.
8629514	8629934	You're welcome.
8630816	8632997	The Wii U Virtual Console games.
8633057	8634918	They will be playable on the gamepad.
8635138	8636378	You know, eventually.
8637119	8646522	A representative for Nintendo said that there is plans to make a Wii U Virtual Console game playable on the new controller solely.
8647403	8648863	Which, of course, has the touchscreen on it.
8648903	8658207	Not that the touchscreen is going to do you any good, but it's still a way that you can have your Virtual Console game and you can play it on the TV or then somebody wants to watch Oprah or whatever.
8658587	8659888	You can move it to the...
8660908	8661468	I have a better idea.
8661488	8661608	What?
8689961	8697366	How about a native Wii U Pokemon title that features both screens at all times or as much as possible?
8697606	8699307	I've got a crazy idea too.
8699788	8705231	What if Pokemon X and Y came out for the 3DS and the Wii U?
8706512	8717640	That you can buy your portable games on the Wii U or you can buy them on your 3DS and they are playable on the Wii U and the 3DS.
8718080	8719521	That's madness though, I'm sure.
8722403	8722743	All right.
8723503	8725104	Does that mean it's time for Mailbag?
8725465	8726485	I'm trying to get it to load.
8726505	8727166	I'm all twisted up.
8727506	8729107	I have it up if you need me as a backup.
8729367	8730308	Do you want me to move on?
8730348	8731128	We'll come back to Mailbag?
8731849	8732609	Okay.
8733850	8735231	I'm just improvising tonight, y'all.
8735351	8736912	Let's move on to the FUs of the week.
8736952	8739994	What an appropriate time with computer issues to go to the FUs of the week.
8755222	8757264	Need I Ask, DarkSakura, what she's mad about?
8757284	8758024	Fuck my netbook.
8758185	8761207	Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.
8762408	8763209	May I have more chocolate?
8764050	8765451	You absolutely may have more chocolate.
8765471	8765711	Thank you.
8765731	8766352	It's in the fridge.
8767513	8767813	Loki.
8768073	8774599	I viewed myself forgetting to mention that I guested up this week on the Down for Maintenance podcast with Codeman and friends.
8774779	8775299	Oh, shame.
8775339	8778322	That's the whole reason you go on other podcasts is to promote your own appearance.
8778362	8780444	Yes, but now I'm promoting my own appearance.
8781504	8783684	You should mention that at the top of next week's show too.
8784005	8784965	Give those guys some love.
8785045	8785865	We'll do it.
8786085	8786705	It was a lot of fun.
8787565	8788525	Alright, good deal.
8788685	8789986	I haven't listened to the whole episode yet.
8790026	8790486	I want to though.
8791586	8793286	My review of the week goes to Rush Limbaugh.
8794166	8795267	Because what an asshole.
8796507	8797867	What an asshole.
8798347	8799747	I'm not even going to repeat what he said.
8799767	8801348	If you've been reading the news, you know what he said.
8801408	8802308	What an asshole.
8803708	8804988	Don't Google it, please.
8805108	8806089	Don't give him more attention.
8806129	8806749	He's an asshole.
8806769	8807469	That's all you need to know.
8807789	8808169	Jason.
8808329	8808589	Jason.
8809198	8812280	I'll second that F you for you because I really don't have anything better.
8813621	8814462	And it's always worth it.
8814502	8816423	He's twice the asshole I thought he was.
8817384	8817804	Right.
8819005	8820226	Fuck you to my job.
8820766	8821827	Fuck you to retail.
8822427	8823728	Fuck you to my boss.
8824448	8824789	Yes.
8826710	8827991	Store boss, not immediate boss.
8828011	8830152	Yes, store boss, not my immediate boss.
8830252	8831693	I love my immediate boss.
8831733	8835936	It's always the quiet ones that are the angstiest, isn't it?
8837745	8838125	Fuck it.
8839666	8842867	Suddenly she's become a level 64 renegade, so look out.
8843668	8845449	Alright, moving on.
8845509	8849010	By the way, I finally found my favorite renegade option in Mass Effect 2.
8849551	8849831	Yes?
8849891	8851932	Making the guy that poisons you drink his own drink.
8853953	8854453	That was fun.
8855013	8855533	Good times.
8855914	8856734	I got mail up, by the way.
8857133	8857813	You did get mail up.
8858134	8858234	Oh.
8858814	8859955	Well then, you know what that means.
8860035	8863237	I play the mail theme and I talk about every week.
8864118	8868200	DarkSakura dives in the mail bag and she pulls out a couple emails that she feels like reading.
8868621	8872163	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.
8872183	8874765	And you should send us more because we've only got two emails this week.
8874785	8875285	That is sad.
8875305	8879808	It's actually a good thing that we only got two because it's so much easier to open up my iPad that way.
8879888	8880509	That's true.
8880589	8881049	But still.
8881229	8882090	I had a backup.
8883010	8887053	And probably I'm going to be absent from chat for a while until I get a new laptop.
8887773	8888634	Dude, learn to spell grammar.
8888654	8888794	Okay.
8917105	8920868	Grammar is spelled G-R-A-M-M-A-R, not E-R.
8921548	8923570	I have to say sorry about the grammar last email.
8923610	8926692	Maybe in this one, but one, I agree with Rob.
8926752	8928073	I like Majora's Mask way better.
8928454	8929374	I may have spelled it wrong.
8929394	8931216	No, you spelled it right, but you didn't capitalize anything.
8931816	8936320	To be fair, I'm really happy you agree with me, but I think they're kind of both overrated.
8936980	8938681	Sorry, not sorry.
8938781	8945946	I didn't like Skyward Sword because I didn't like the art direction.
8946106	8947647	I liked Twilight Princess' art style.
8948028	8950609	I also hated how empty the Skyworld was.
8950829	8954712	Also how there was only like three different places to explore.
8954852	8957954	Also, my biggest thing I dislike is the motion plus.
8958014	8961657	It worked with Wii Sports Resorts, but not for a Zelda game.
8962197	8963458	That was a whole sentence, by the way.
8964867	8967468	Oh, and that came from, I guess, Chris.
8967868	8968188	Somebody.
8968228	8968849	Chris is cool.
8973750	8980653	I think I mentioned in November that I've started watching a lot of video game related videos on YouTube video series.
8981733	8992338	And Game Grumps, Continue Show, a lot of the things by their friends, I'll watch one off, two off, but I'm really subscribed and dedicated to Game Grumps right now and Continue Show.
8993198	8993278	Um...
8994514	9005446	When they were playing the Zelda adventure game in Nintendo Land, they were saying that that whole game's play mechanics is better than the whole of Skyward Sword as far as Wii motion controls are concerned.
9007972	9016155	I say that incidentally because I haven't actually played Skyward Sword, but I did play a bit of the Nintendo Land setup, and it was quite fun.
9016396	9017016	It was simple.
9017096	9022798	I don't know how it expands to full-screen Zelda, but it just seems fun.
9024159	9025780	Okay, I guess I don't have a point to that spiel.
9026040	9026480	Second email!
9027000	9028822	Second email comes from Raginator.
9029323	9029963	Hi, OLR.
9030023	9031945	It's your friendly neighborhood prankster, Raginator.
9032366	9036030	For this week's email, I thought I'd broach a non-gaming geek-centric topic.
9036510	9042977	As many people in the VOG community already know, I'm disabled and as a result living on SSD with ample free time on my hands.
9043578	9048222	Due to this, I often find myself lost in thought, usually about random-ass stuff related to physics.
9048943	9056990	Well, all of that being said, I had an epiphany not too long ago related to physics, specifically about dark matter, and I'd like to write a thesis on it.
9057931	9060533	However, I do have one hurdle to overcome.
9060874	9063076	My math skills are not advanced enough to write the paper.
9063576	9064517	I never took calculus.
9064557	9065858	That was your first typo.
9065918	9066799	Congratulations.
9066839	9068080	Your grammar has been astounding.
9069341	9070762	He missed one of the E's in never.
9070802	9072123	He spelled N-V-E-R.
9072383	9075386	Sorry, I thought the email needed Warholic.
9076767	9077347	Oh, and thought.
9077407	9077927	Here's the next one.
9078067	9083952	My thought here is to perhaps collaborate with someone in a university that has a working knowledge of physics and calculus.
9084472	9087414	Now my questions for you are as follows.
9087674	9089456	Does this route sound feasible to you?
9089876	9091217	And how would I go about this?
9091597	9095040	I'm sure I can't very well just waltz in and say, hey, want to do a thesis with me?
9095600	9102725	If my epiphany that I had works out as well as I think it will, it could be very well groundbreaking.
9103866	9104326	Craigslist.
9107549	9107969	Seriously?
9108169	9109410	Sorry, one more time the question?
9109850	9110671	Sorry, I got distracted.
9110691	9110771	Okay.
9111519	9112700	DarkMatter DarkMatter
9133815	9136876	Call heads of, call deans of physics departments.
9137136	9141838	Call various schools that are in your area and make an appointment to speak with people and ask them about it.
9142278	9143518	Take a class here and there.
9143598	9145619	Community colleges offer physics courses.
9146199	9147419	And talk to your teacher after class.
9148040	9152061	If it's something that you're truly interested in doing, especially since you have tons of free time on your hand,
9153049	9154590	Fuck.
9154651	9155111	Go to school!
9180494	9181755	And they might fester a little less.
9182876	9183096	Done.
9183337	9184838	Good feedback, DarkSakura.
9185379	9188322	Good job, despite your computer issues with the email bag tonight, I must say.
9188902	9189723	Hey, I'm trying.
9189903	9190804	That's why I got this thing.
9190824	9192266	It just doesn't work for running everything.
9192286	9197070	All right, let's jam through these couple last stories here, and we'll get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9197130	9197451	Not yet.
9197491	9198472	Don't call yet, but we'll let you know.
9199333	9199513	Loki.
9199533	9199613	Loki.
9200074	9201556	Razer Project Fiona Razer's Edge
9220015	9221775	It's got these, like, analog handle things.
9221876	9235879	But now it is available... Actually, I should say it's available without that for $1,000 for the base model, the i5-1, or $1,300 for the pro model, which is a Core i7.
9236199	9238659	But this is a tablet that actually runs PC stuff.
9238779	9239920	It's got Windows 8 on it.
9240240	9242720	It's got, you know, a gaming card in it.
9242900	9246181	In fact, actually, it's got a pretty high-end NVIDIA card in there.
9246201	9248962	I was kind of surprised about that, which I...
9249742	9255243	kind of brought up the point that, so does this thing run as hot as like the surface of the sun?
9255283	9266506	Because if it's got like, you know, some mobile 640 processor or something like that, um, I have no kind of clue how this thing would run cool.
9266906	9268447	Cause fuck my laptop.
9268647	9272788	I had to do all sorts of cooling mods to get the run somewhat cool and it still runs hot.
9273748	9273828	Um,
9275475	9275775	I don't know.
9276156	9276896	It's interesting.
9277697	9280280	If you're interested, though, they are, I think, taking pre-orders for it.
9281161	9283963	I don't think they've announced a date when it's going to be available.
9284764	9285265	Oh, I'm sorry.
9285325	9290730	The base model is available now, but the pro model is coming later.
9292292	9296176	They're saying that the $1,300 one can run Dishonored at 60 frames per second.
9299908	9324548	which I don't think that's that processor intensive of a game so it's I don't know but it's an option I guess if you really want to spend that kind of money honestly though if you're gonna spend $1,300 on something you probably get a laptop that's just as nice for a lot cheaper just saying you don't need a tablet for everything or you can actually I actually was looking you can make your own tablet be fun
9325248	9326088	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9349193	9350253	Yes, Shaq Fu.
9350374	9351194	You heard me, Shaq.
9351474	9352194	Like Shaquille O'Neal?
9352234	9352374	Yeah.
9353075	9356576	Shaq Down, a 2D side-scrolling action game.
9357396	9360097	It actually does star Shaq, or Shaquille O'Neal, of course.
9360637	9362778	It came out for iOS and Android.
9363418	9368500	In the game, you battle zombies across three stages and bosses and all that stuff.
9368781	9372382	It was developed by Hiptic Games and published by One Spear Entertainment.
9372722	9374764	That's what everybody said, that's what the users want
9399758	9400918	More Shaq games?
9402319	9403119	I don't think that's what they say.
9403299	9405820	Although they do have, you know, was it Shaq Fu?
9407501	9409522	The Skype line is open.
9409542	9413163	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9413503	9414544	Sorry, Loki, go ahead.
9414584	9416204	Shaq Fu was the Gaiden one.
9418285	9418605	Nice.
9419085	9420126	And then the sequel to that.
9421006	9425127	One of those stupid long names, Shaq Fu, the something ultimate Grand Alpha Z Gaiden.
9426048	9429129	VidPower in our chat room, Shaq Fu Gaiden was awesome.
9430728	9431088	JackFu and Awesome
9461001	9461521	Good, good.
9461541	9462242	How are you today?
9463102	9463622	I'm all right.
9463642	9464423	Thanks for asking.
9464483	9465143	What's on your mind, buddy?
9465763	9468505	I just wanted to call in and talk about CES.
9469125	9469705	Did you go?
9470286	9470646	I did.
9470726	9471086	I did.
9471126	9471526	That's right.
9471566	9472226	You're in Vegas.
9472287	9473127	It's in your backyard.
9473707	9474107	It is.
9474227	9474588	It is.
9474648	9476208	It's really easy to get there.
9476228	9477989	You don't have to put up with traffic.
9478249	9482992	Now, Bobby on his show calls this the Consumer Electronics Show, which is not open to consumers.
9483092	9487434	But you snuck in through the back door or you work somewhere that got you in or what?
9488179	9490341	I kind of snuck in.
9490421	9492822	I snuck in every year.
9492842	9494923	Fair enough.
9496184	9500547	Wow, this is like the Renegade report on Consumer Electronics Show.
9501107	9504869	See, VOG can't afford to send anybody, so we just have people sneak in.
9505890	9506310	I'm just kidding.
9506350	9507271	This wasn't endorsed by VOG.
9507711	9507951	All right.
9508992	9510653	VidPower, tell us about what you saw at CES.
9511198	9526571	Yeah, well, you know, since Microsoft wasn't there at CES this year, the amount of video games are pretty... Well, CES isn't really known for video games anyway, but like this year, there were just like a small handful of games that were showing off.
9527471	9529773	And so, not much.
9530934	9532696	The big games were over at Sony's booth.
9533536	9538340	God of War Ascension that were showing off was probably like the main big thing, but...
9539892	9546416	They had a bunch of other demos, like the new Super game was there.
9547096	9550939	They had that Book of Spells game that they were demoing.
9551399	9555541	Did you get to see 120-inch television sets that just made everything look, oh my god?
9556362	9557343	Yeah, yeah, I did.
9557683	9566228	I did see one of those new 4K television sets with the crazy, huge, clear resolution stuff.
9566772	9567592	Do we need that?
9568993	9570153	No, you don't.
9571334	9573174	But it's pretty cool looking at it.
9573715	9576636	I was at Fry's just last night with Alan very randomly.
9576676	9578096	We were just over there kind of killing time.
9578476	9580297	And we were looking at some of their really nice TVs.
9580397	9583038	And, like, the new TVs, they're not even 4Ks.
9583058	9586460	They're just, like, the HD TVs, but, like, the newer type of plasma or whatever.
9586480	9589661	And they were showing on Blu-ray Speed Racer was on one of them.
9589681	9591902	And it was so, like, it just looked fake.
9591962	9594863	And I realized, like, Speed Racer wasn't exactly, you know, real to begin with.
9594883	9595163	But, like...
9596283	9613611	you can tell that shit was done on a computer same thing with the Avengers was showing on another one of the TVs and I was like you can really see like you can really tell computer versus real this is like jaw-dropping how like the ultra precision of it all almost ruins the movie magic a little bit
9614338	9614979	It does, it does.
9615039	9622985	Sometimes it looks a little like too... a bit fake with all that computer that they put in there.
9625166	9625727	Yeah, yeah.
9625767	9628048	Sometimes it does look a bit fake.
9628989	9636715	But yeah, you know, they had a display of a Blu-ray playing on a TV next to one of these 4K televisions.
9636775	9637655	And I guess if you...
9638436	9639857	Did you see the classroom DDR thing?
9639877	9642980	I did, I did see DDR Classroom Edition Did you check it out?
9664318	9665079	I did, I did.
9666441	9678515	So they had a demo on, it was a pretty giant screen, and it had like seven of these wireless pads all set up for just random people to come play on it.
9679196	9683261	And I, being an old school DDR person...
9684642	9686643	I went up and I tested out this pad.
9688384	9689965	It's surprisingly good.
9691246	9692566	It didn't slip at all.
9693067	9698529	I don't know if they put anything under the pad or what, but I was just doing the expert level steps.
9698789	9699009	Yeah?
9699650	9701331	And yeah, it didn't slip at all.
9701951	9703612	It definitely had the problem...
9704312	9705253	Red Octane Ignition 2.0 Pads
9724828	9730232	Was the music in it all old school, or was it kind of mixed with contemporary stuff?
9730492	9731313	You know what?
9731453	9742741	It was all licensed American music, so there were no Konami originals or Japanese stuff.
9743222	9745323	It was really Americanized.
9745403	9746244	No Butterfly?
9746264	9746304	No.
9749103	9755187	How am I supposed to show everybody in my PE class my patented Kyle Snyder spin?
9758306	9760067	I was a bit disappointed.
9760147	9761727	I was like, oh, okay.
9761767	9762947	We saw that Uber song list.
9762967	9765408	Yeah, they have a ton of songs.
9765988	9769129	Anyway, I guess they'll have to stick with Lady Gaga and Rihanna or whatever.
9771229	9771729	Awesome.
9771769	9773590	Well, it sounds like you had a good time at CES.
9774110	9782172	Since you are a consumer who somehow got into Consumer Electronics Show and it is about trying to get you to buy something, is there anything you walked out of the show going, I might buy that?
9784950	9785971	Not really.
9786532	9788393	CES is more really... Success!
9789454	9790956	What a successful expo.
9792277	9801125	CES is really more about technology to have in the back of your mind, but a lot of it's not...
9802958	9808561	Ready for consumers, yeah, you know, most likely in the price level of all this stuff.
9808841	9812423	Yeah, CES is for rich people, not the people who have to sneak in.
9812583	9831194	E3, just like E3 is technically supposed to be for a lot of shops to be able to pick up publishers, CES is meant, these are the technologies that you can offer to consumers and you get bits and pieces of it or good ideas, but it's not, it's technology for consumers, not best buy convention extreme technology.
9832236	9833596	Pretty much, pretty much.
9833676	9835937	Yeah, that's a really accurate statement.
9836297	9843159	It's more of like technology that's like ready for consumer in like three to four years from now.
9843780	9844060	All right.
9844320	9847461	Well, VidPower, I should probably let you go to try and get another call here before the night's over.
9847521	9849341	But thanks for the report from CES.
9849882	9850402	No problem.
9850442	9850922	No problem.
9850962	9851522	Anytime.
9851702	9851922	All right.
9851942	9852522	You take care, buddy.
9852542	9853003	Have a great week.
9853543	9853743	Later.
9853763	9854123	All right.
9854143	9854283	Bye.
9855807	9856910	It's nice to hear from VidPower.
9856930	9860599	I haven't heard from him in a while, even though I want to know more about how he got in.
9860640	9862224	That sounds a little sneaky there.
9864961	9870084	Excuse me, while we wait for more calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9870944	9872725	Getting some Twitter topics out here.
9872945	9876307	TigerClaw on Twitter sending us a tweet to a story.
9876347	9877247	Yes, I heard about this.
9877727	9880068	It's not really gaming per se, but it's just kind of lulzy.
9880869	9887172	You know there's that site where you can do a petition to the White House, and if it gets so many signatures, they have to respond to it or whatever?
9887192	9887272	Yeah.
9887952	9891175	Well, there was that whole petition to build a Death Star.
9891716	9894218	The White House replied this week and said no.
9894598	9901704	But I thought it was a very clever answer because it talked about we can't afford that kind of debt and this administration does not support blowing up other planets.
9901744	9903265	That was my favorite response ever.
9903285	9903906	That was great.
9904086	9904886	It was great.
9905307	9906588	An amazing response.
9907108	9908910	Alright, let's go to the phones and take another call.
9909550	9910591	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9910611	9910971	Who's this?
9911992	9913493	Hey guys, this is Degenerate Johnny.
9914594	9916336	Degenerate Johnny, what's on your mind, buddy?
9917678	9918199	Not much.
9918939	9919459	Can't complain.
9919699	9926603	Well, actually, I do have a complaint to Brad from PodCulture for getting me addicted to that fireball whiskey.
9931386	9932707	It's very cinnamon.
9932907	9935248	The influence of VOG is spreading.
9935268	9935788	I love it.
9935808	9936929	That just makes me shudder.
9936989	9937269	Yuck.
9938630	9939210	Amazing.
9939711	9944373	Well, sadly, Brad from PodCulture told me he wasn't listening live tonight, but hopefully he'll catch that on the podcast.
9944393	9945574	Good old hardy FU.
9946454	9948376	Yeah, it's all good.
9948836	9951699	As a matter of fact, I'm using it for the Orange Island Radio drinking game.
9951719	9955182	So what else do you have in mind, buddy?
9957284	9965772	Basically, well, I wanted to touch up on the whole video game violence thing.
9966132	9971517	I'm a little afraid right now of the timing of this because...
9973052	9976534	I'm playing Dead Space 1 and 2 in preparation for Dead Space 3.
9978375	9991962	And my problem is that this is, aside from Devil May Cry, this is one of the AAA titles that's coming out since the shooting.
9992982	10000006	And Visceral Games has a tendency of pushing the envelope, of putting...
10000766	10005089	certain adversaries in their games, namely babies and children.
10005649	10009432	If you looked at their past three games, Dante's Infernal, Dead Space, and Dead Space 2.
10012153	10027083	And so my problem is, well, I'm a little scared about this, is if they decide to do that again in Dead Space 3, would we see more irate type of backlash from fans?
10028601	10046206	We haven't really received it beforehand, but in light of the shooting, this might come up and say Visceral, it puts in the six-year-old or seven-year-old pack hunters in the game or the exploding babies.
10048547	10051828	I'm just a little afraid that there might be a little blackout clash if they decide to do that.
10052468	10061732	Yeah, I hear what you're saying, and I agree with you to a point that it's like now would be a great time to just show a little restraint, but at the same time, somebody's going to push the envelope.
10061792	10065253	And if it's not these guys, then guess what will end up on Fox News eventually?
10065293	10070735	It'll be that game that the guys made about Columbine or whatever, the controversial thing that came out some time ago.
10071235	10077398	There's always going to be somebody pushing the envelope, but at the same time, that's what the First Amendment is for.
10078258	10092234	and you know I think I've heard this argument before is that you know what you know we might want to put all these restrictions but what amendment or I'm sorry what lengths are we willing to go to sacrifice the First Amendment to you know spare all these others or what have you.
10094216	10099382	Drama is going to unfold as a result of this but it's not going to be any different than what we've been dealing with for the past decade.
10100519	10114052	I sort of have a feeling, I don't know, the cynic in me sort of thinks you are going to start to see some type of legislation about violent video games very similar to how you have motion pictures.
10114152	10117215	In reality, they would just mirror the freaking motion picture thing.
10117555	10120358	You know, no one under 17 admitted without parent or guardian or whatever.
10120439	10123722	But then again, the Motion Picture Association needs to be reformed.
10124083	10128468	Now would be a great time to examine all of that because the MPAA is kind of shit.
10128969	10135056	And the way they look at things and that violent movies can be, you know, rated R, no problem, and kids can get in, but...
10135396	10138758	Show a penis and oh my god, not safe for anybody, right?
10138798	10142341	It's like this weird, weird, you know, kind of bullshit.
10142381	10144782	So now would be a great time to evaluate all of that.
10144822	10146083	But I think it's inevitable.
10146464	10152948	You're gonna see some type of parental controls on this where there's gonna be certain type of games you don't buy without a driver's license.
10153868	10156790	I just, or some type of identification.
10156890	10159132	I just think that is inevitable.
10159332	10163375	But it's also a little bit naive because with the internet, you can get anything.
10163655	10164395	You know, how are you gonna,
10165336	10167737	How are you going to regulate an M-rated game on the internet?
10167877	10168678	It's going to be a lot harder.
10169598	10170379	Oh yeah, absolutely.
10170679	10174381	And since we're all going towards digital distribution, that's kind of the reality.
10174441	10175622	Movies are going that way too.
10176422	10177863	Yep.
10177903	10182865	Marissa Congusto in chat says, Most likely there will be a threat of legislation and the industry will censor itself.
10183126	10186167	I'm totally with you there, Marissa, but that kind of already happened in the mid-90s.
10186227	10188348	That's how we have the video game rating system we have now.
10188628	10190950	It was the first time we went through all this crap in the mid-90s.
10191670	10195491	And that was when the record industry did the whole explicit lyrics thing.
10195511	10197472	And Walmart stopped carrying them.
10198352	10199253	All of that happened.
10200553	10212037	And the way I interpret what Biden was saying is that I think he acknowledges that the ESRP is by far far more responsible than the...
10213744	10221606	I think he's basically hinting to everybody, just let it be general knowledge.
10221706	10228348	You guys are better than the MPAA, you guys are far more accountable, more responsible, definitely.
10228748	10236030	Just pick up a DVD and compare it to a video game, and you'll have a hard time looking for a rating of the movie, much less.
10236650	10237571	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10258513	10274551	I wish because the MPAA really they need to look at that hard hard they need to look at that it blows my mind literally blows my mind how a movie like Saw 7 or any of those movies gets an R rating
10275071	10275491	DarkSakura.com
10292886	10294487	Heaven forbid people have penises.
10294807	10301992	Decapitations and people setting on fire and eyes sewn shut and all that crazy shit the Saw movies show.
10302212	10302853	No problem.
10303413	10305014	No problem.
10305254	10307296	Okay, there's a big problem here.
10307996	10308517	Big problem.
10308537	10310238	I would rather see fucking than blood.
10310258	10310758	Me too.
10313476	10314776	Who wouldn't?
10314856	10316997	What sick fucker wants to see blood?
10317077	10318657	I realize there's a whole like horror movie.
10318677	10321338	Now, I do have a friend who's completely into the human centipede, so.
10321698	10322278	Oh, God.
10322618	10323978	Awesome.
10324258	10331360	I should recognize that a horror movie has its own subculture, but at least they all kind of admit it's a weird thing.
10331660	10336561	Like most horror movie fans I know go, yeah, it's gross, but that's what I love about it is it's so cheesy.
10336601	10338562	I'm like, all right, at least you know where it is.
10338702	10340522	I showed her the toddler Pete and she cracked up.
10342651	10344072	I love TV ratings.
10344793	10355783	Gaming ratings and TV ratings both have the general level and then they point out these subcategories, you know, crude language, comic mischief, and up to the suggestive situations and so on and so forth.
10356183	10357044	And those are good.
10357084	10360427	They're expanded classifications that make a lot of sense.
10361067	10361968	And movies don't.
10363318	10368622	GameGuru in chat says about my comment about what's going to happen nationwide says, I don't think so.
10368702	10373085	California tried that and the Supreme Court shot it down by saying video games are protected speech.
10373485	10374405	There was more to it.
10374506	10380750	I don't remember all the details, but I want to say it was going to bust the employees and all this other stuff that didn't make sense.
10380930	10385312	And the fact that I think mature gaming couldn't be on the shelves or had to have some time.
10385333	10387534	Basically, they were going to treat the violent video games like porn.
10387874	10389576	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
10404611	10405952	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10423350	10436800	I think that's the whole point of Rockefeller's bill that he's trying to introduce is to evaluate video games in a certain light to see if there's legislation that's necessary.
10437140	10440823	Otherwise, then we'll let it be what it is.
10442484	10443004	Exactly.
10443645	10443945	All right.
10444125	10446227	DeGeneres, Johnny, I've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show.
10446247	10447428	But thanks so much for your call, buddy.
10448068	10448509	No problem.
10448649	10449489	You guys have a great day.
10449549	10449910	You too.
10450010	10450270	Take care.
10451512	10453052	That is going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
10453132	10454973	I am very sorry to those that didn't get through.
10455113	10457093	I know usually I try to take one or two more calls.
10457753	10462814	I need to wrap up the show in the next few minutes here so I'm going to kind of start to wind things down.
10463175	10464915	I want to close out the Twitter topics though.
10465115	10466595	Twitter.com slash OLR.
10466635	10478038	There was one other tweet here I wanted to read from Actdeft who sent a story to a story about the PlayStation 3 has likely outsold the Xbox 360.
10478078	10478178	What?
10480178	10481999	Maybe Worldwide.
10482059	10485680	I'd believe it Worldwide because Japan kind of tilts it.
10485720	10487041	Is that what it is about Worldwide?
10487621	10490922	Yeah, so Worldwide, it looks like the PlayStation 3 has outsold the Xbox 360.
10490962	10497405	This will be great news to Sony fans everywhere, but really, guys, just, you know.
10499032	10500433	Play what you like and enjoy it.
10501474	10502054	Exactly.
10502715	10504236	System is only as good as the games that are on it.
10504356	10505496	But you know what?
10505697	10506617	I will say this much.
10507257	10512181	We all gave the PlayStation 3 tons of shit when it first came out, and it deserved it.
10512821	10517484	But they've really turned it around in many ways, and this is the reward that they get to reap for that.
10517524	10518365	Congratulations.
10518945	10520906	Now, can you do something about the Vita?
10520986	10521927	Yeah, seriously.
10522707	10523067	Please.
10523768	10524648	We'll end on that note.
10524728	10524988	Alright.
10525688	10527069	That was it for the Twitter topics tonight.
10527469	10528269	Rapid fire news.
10528349	10532250	I don't think there was anything left in the show, but maybe if you got any... Sorry, last minute stories.
10532290	10533011	Cox on fire.
10533751	10533991	What?
10535091	10535712	Read the chat.
10536052	10536372	Alright.
10536892	10537312	Fair enough.
10537852	10538092	Alright.
10539873	10556085	that's it we're gonna wrap up the show and head on out here for the night but not before we go around and get everybody's final thoughts and a chance for me to say of course as always support independent podcasting you know even if you thought this show was shit go download another independent first off if you thought it was bad I'm surprised you made it this far
10556845	10563071	If you thought it was bad, send us feedback, constructive criticism, and tell us what you thought didn't work instead of being an asshole.
10563131	10568035	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio at OLR on Twitter.
10568276	10570237	Let me give you an example of bad feedback.
10570298	10572139	Bad feedback would be Rob is a bitch.
10572620	10574842	Or bad feedback would be Loki screams too much.
10575402	10575682	Bitch.
10576063	10581547	Good feedback would be the audio levels need to be looked at because sometimes Loki gets a little louder.
10581767	10582468	That's fair feedback.
10582568	10587272	Or, you know, Rob should not talk so much when he's talking about da-da-da.
10587292	10588212	That, you know, whatever.
10588553	10589513	Or send us good feedback.
10589593	10590494	We appreciate both kinds.
10590534	10592976	We appreciate Jamie for everything that she does.
10593296	10594517	We love her and want her...
10595558	10597260	We want to pay her to do podcasting forever.
10621121	10621522	DarkSakura.com
10637583	10660596	Gamertag Radio earlier in the show I'm going to of course plug VOG because all the hardworking independent folks that are out there lots of great shows on the network we used to be on, Video Game Outsiders I still try to listen to as much as I can Loki and I were both on Down for Maintenance a startup show my buddy's got Game Buoy, another great indie show so just support those that do this for the love of podcasting
10661096	10663878	Jason needs his own show because he's got a sexy voice.
10663938	10664579	He does.
10664999	10665840	He really does.
10666000	10667001	I hope that happens soon.
10667561	10670384	He did have a very smooth R&B intro as well.
10671324	10671745	You know what?
10671765	10677529	We need to be like the kudzu of the podcasting world where we spread over everything and are high in iron.
10678630	10680951	Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10680971	10682051	If you don't hear from me in August, send help
10706627	10710889	Okay, and Rai, good luck with pushing it to Paragon 100.

10731141	10735464	I'm glad that I'm finally coming out of a shell a little bit more, talking a little bit more than I was last time.
10735844	10738246	Helps to have my own microphone and not be sharing with Rob.

10756258	10769435	You're welcome, anytime That's my thought So long and thanks for the fish My final thought tonight is I don't know You love the sound of your own voice
10770089	10775352	yes four score in 70 years Loki, what's your final thought tonight?
10776433	10792363	I guess I'll play some different games this week I was already loading up Geonisisters to try that since I have that on Steam maybe I'll finish the VOG Minecraft website and play Minecraft I don't know
10792967	10794169	I've got a lot of stuff I want to do.
10794669	10799756	And I have a bunch of random computer parts that I took from, well, not took from work, but I had stored at work.
10800457	10803080	And now they're in my garage that I want to build something out of.
10803121	10804002	I don't really know what.
10804402	10806946	But, man, I have so many random computer parts.
10807006	10808488	It's like I keep finding stuff.
10808508	10809088	It's ridiculous.
10809109	10810130	I don't know what to make out of it.
10811570	10817654	You should make one of those little mini boxes but put it in something that no one would expect to see it in.
10817674	10819555	Like build it out of a fake litter box or something.
10819596	10830143	Well, originally I had parts for... I was building an arcade cabinet inside one of... It's like a tiny... What was it?
10830183	10832184	Like the old LCD Frogger games.
10832784	10834746	Like the really small cabinet ones.
10835346	10838251	Although it doesn't fit without dremeling some stuff out.
10838371	10844520	So I have a Pico ITX board.
10845021	10849968	And then I've got a ton of arcade boards and all sorts of crazy shit.
10850299	10854084	Actdeft wants me to tell you you have been added to the VOG Club on Forza Horizon and we have to play this week.
10854184	10855686	Now I have to practice.
10868523	10870024	Oh, you can't be any worse than me, Matt.
10870044	10870724	Don't worry about it.
10870744	10871344	Nah.
