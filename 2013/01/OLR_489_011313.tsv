0	3000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	12000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!
14000	19000	Tonight, January 13th, 2013, a new gaming handheld debuts at CES,
19000	24000	Pok√©mon X and Y is announced, and further details emerge on the Steam Box.
24000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	35000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
35000	40000	where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 489,
40000	45000	for this January the 13th of 2013.
45000	49000	I'm sure there's like a numberology thing in there, a numerology thing in there,
49000	55000	because all I ever see on the Twitters is like, Happy 1-2-1-2, or Happy 1-3-1-3,
55000	57000	and everybody's looking for the number Zs.
57000	58000	The numbers?
58000	59000	The number Zs, yes.
59000	61000	The numbers means we've been doing this too damn long.
61000	65000	Exactly, exactly. The lovely voice you hear over there is my co-host,
65000	68000	say hello to the one and only Jamie Summers!
68000	71000	You should see how Rob is gesturing to me as if you could all see this.
71000	74000	Someday there might be a cam, we'll see.
74000	76000	I will be wearing a shroud.
76000	79000	I think that I will make the burqa fashion statement.
79000	82000	Lady Gaga might have you beat based on some pictures I saw on the internet.
82000	84000	Lady Gaga, okay?
84000	87000	That woman needs to take her Adderall.
87000	90000	Alright, my name, by the way, is Rob Roberts, of course.
90000	95000	We are joined by all of you in our chat room, live, as we do tape live every Sunday night
95000	98000	at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,
98000	103000	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern on Sundays, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
103000	105000	And a big thank you to everybody at the Voice of Geeks Network
105000	107000	and all of you listening live in our chat room,
107000	110000	live.vognetwork.com for tuning in tonight.
110000	114000	We'll be talking about games and CES and all that fun stuff here in a little bit,
114000	117000	but of course we have to introduce the third host on our program.
117000	119000	Say hello to Tech Master, Loki!
119000	120000	Hi.
120000	121000	How are you, Loki?
121000	122000	I'm fine.
122000	124000	So, a trip to Disneyland may be in your future,
124000	126000	based on what we were talking about before the show.
126000	128000	Well, not that I want to go, but my wife might-
128000	129000	How can you not want to go to Disneyland?
129000	131000	How about she go with me and Dan?
131000	132000	There you go.
132000	134000	I'm fine with that.
134000	136000	No, honestly, I'm seriously fine with that.
136000	138000	I told her that she could go with other people,
138000	140000	but she wants to go to Disneyland,
140000	144000	and personally, I don't want to go to Disneyland
144000	146000	just because I don't really-
146000	150000	Most of the times I go, I have this anxiety about going on roller coasters,
150000	152000	although one time I got over that,
152000	154000	and then it came back, so I don't understand it.
154000	156000	One time, I really loved roller coasters.
156000	158000	What is with the macho men I know in my life,
158000	161000	and their polarizing fear of roller coasters?
161000	164000	It's weird. No, it's a weird, irrational thing.
164000	167000	It's not that I think anything's going to happen.
167000	169000	It's just my body reacts to it like that,
169000	171000	and even stupid shit.
171000	173000	You know how they have that really crappy ride
173000	175000	that's over in California Adventure?
175000	178000	It's like the old carnival ride where you're on the swings or whatever.
178000	180000	Oh, I refuse to go on that one.
180000	182000	The silly symphony swings now.
182000	185000	Yeah, that made me feel really sick to my stomach.
185000	187000	It's just weird.
187000	189000	What happens when-
189000	191000	It goes in the shock.
191000	194000	When the wife says, you need to go on California Screamin',
194000	196000	what are you afraid is going to happen?
196000	198000	Do you cry?
198000	200000	No, I don't cry.
200000	202000	I don't want to go.
202000	204000	I don't know.
204000	206000	It's like I can't take the adrenaline rush or something.
206000	208000	It's really weird.
208000	210000	I don't know.
210000	212000	The only thing that gets me on Screamin' is that first hill,
212000	214000	and then I'm fine.
214000	216000	It's Neil Patrick Harris' soothing voice that helps me out every time.
216000	218000	Second thoughts? Too late.
218000	220000	I know that nothing is going to happen to me or anything.
220000	222000	It's not like I'm afraid that the roller coaster
222000	224000	is going to fall off the tracks or something like that.
224000	226000	I know nothing is going to happen to me.
226000	228000	I'm perfectly safe in there.
228000	230000	For some reason, I can't do it.
230000	232000	There was one time I went.
232000	234000	One of the last times I went with my family.
234000	236000	It was kind of like that.
236000	238000	I was like, I don't want to do this.
238000	240000	We went on Thunder Mountain Railroad.
240000	242000	I was like, that wasn't so bad.
242000	244000	We kept going on it over and over and over again.
244000	246000	It was before it killed the people on there.
250000	252000	It was actually pretty fun.
252000	254000	Don't talk about that, okay?
254000	256000	Big Thunder is awesome if you go at night and sit in the back.
256000	258000	It was pretty fun.
258000	260000	I thought, okay, cool.
260000	262000	I was pretty comfortable with it last time.
262000	264000	This should be no big deal this time.
264000	266000	Went there again.
266000	268000	Last time we went, I was like,
268000	270000	why am I afraid of this stuff again?
270000	272000	I don't understand. This doesn't make any sense.
272000	274000	It's not that you think you're going to die on the ride.
274000	276000	It's not even that I feel like I'm going to get sick.
276000	280000	It's almost like a panic attack.
280000	282000	Like you might lose control of your bladder?
282000	284000	No, it's not even that.
284000	286000	It's like a panic attack almost.
286000	288000	You get the palpitations.
288000	290000	Does your heart start beating faster?
290000	292000	Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.
292000	294000	I don't understand.
294000	296000	I don't go on roller coasters really.
296000	298000	That's the thing.
298000	300000	She wants to bring Josh too.
300000	302000	Not even besides the roller coaster stuff,
302000	306000	because I'm fine with just sitting out while she goes on roller coasters and that kind of thing
306000	308000	and just going on parts of the Caribbean and that kind of crap.
308000	312000	But I don't want to take Josh on a plane,
312000	314000	because that is going to be a pain in the ass.
314000	316000	Why the hell would you fly anyway?
316000	318000	You could drive. Yeah, you could drive.
318000	320000	The drive is easy.
320000	322000	We're not going to drive because she won't...
322000	324000	She has to go to the bathroom all the time.
324000	326000	Well, so do I.
326000	328000	Tam puts up with it.
328000	330000	I'm trying to stop him a million times,
330000	332000	but I don't know.
332000	334000	And then I also have to harass him for coffee.
334000	336000	I also get that nervous
336000	340000	when I'm doing really big things.
340000	342000	You remember last year,
342000	344000	and I never shut up about this,
344000	346000	and I'm going to tell the story again.
346000	348000	Remember last year when I had that big thing
348000	350000	where I was at the RuPaul's Drag Race finale
350000	352000	and I got to actually ask a question.
352000	354000	It was supposed to be on TV.
354000	356000	Now it got cut, but it's like a deleted scene you can see online.
356000	358000	Yes, that's me, isn't it?
358000	360000	If you Google it on Logo's site or whatever,
360000	362000	you can see the RuPaul's Drag Race Season 4 deleted scene,
362000	364000	and I'm the first guy that asked the question.
364000	366000	Well, I was so nervous before that.
366000	368000	I literally thought I was going to barf,
368000	370000	and I had to go to the bathroom right before that happened.
370000	372000	In fact, I asked one of the handlers,
372000	374000	I'm like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.
374000	376000	I could feel my heart beating,
376000	378000	but then all of a sudden when the camera's on,
378000	380000	I'm just like, I'll better.
380000	382000	It just melted away.
382000	384000	The only thing that will get me over going on roller coasters
384000	386000	is just going on roller coasters.
386000	388000	That's really the only thing you can do.
388000	390000	Showtime is nothing for you, Rob.
390000	392000	You said to sensitize yourself to it.
392000	394000	Let me introduce that phantom voice you just heard
394000	396000	who hadn't been introduced.
396000	398000	Who the hell was that guy?
398000	400000	That disconnected, deep radio voice.
400000	402000	Well, you hopefully will recognize that disconnected, deep voice
402000	406000	as a voice you hear in the intro to the show every night.
406000	408000	Or the pre-intro, if you will.
408000	412000	Say hello, everybody, to Jason, or VXJsonXVYZ.
412000	414000	It's me, again.
414000	416000	I'm doing this for almost a year,
416000	418000	and that's crazy to me to think about.
418000	420000	Here you are, visiting yet again from Colorado.
420000	422000	But it helps that you come out to San Francisco a lot for work
422000	424000	and we happen to be on the way.
424000	426000	And then drive two hours and kill the better part of my Sunday.
426000	428000	But hey, it's all for a good cause, so no complaints here.
428000	430000	Are we allowed to talk about your job here on the show?
430000	433000	Yeah, I've meant when I had you talk about the game off.
433000	435000	I can't remember, because sometimes we get people in here
435000	438000	who are in the game industry, so we can't say where they work.
438000	440000	Shane!
441000	444000	But it's the big N, Rob!
444000	446000	But anyway, you work at GitHub.
446000	447000	I do.
447000	450000	So you guys have your Git-togethers in San Francisco, right?
450000	455000	I wonder if that came up as a possible name for these big collections.
455000	457000	They bring the whole company, because Git together.
457000	459000	I'll give you that one on the house.
459000	462000	We appreciate that. I'll run it by legal.
462000	464000	Make sure that it's still free.
464000	469000	GitHub brings everybody in for twice yearly summits, January and August.
469000	471000	And so I've been out here.
471000	473000	The first time was when I started working here.
473000	475000	The second time was the summit in August.
475000	478000	We had a little Git-together in November for my team specifically.
478000	481000	And now this is the second summit that I've been a part of with the company.
481000	484000	It's the company's fifth, I believe.
484000	486000	And it's my second.
486000	488000	And it starts tomorrow.
488000	490000	And I'm kind of excited.
490000	493000	Now, real quick, I sort of have a vague idea what GitHub is,
493000	497000	but I kind of feel like I'm not nerdy enough to GitHub.
497000	499000	So what is GitHub?
499000	501000	And where could a beginner nerd like me,
501000	504000	what could I profit from visiting GitHub
504000	506000	and making it a part of my daily routine?
506000	507000	Oh, man, you threw me a curveball.
507000	512000	So the point of GitHub is to foster collaboration and development.
512000	515000	The point is to make it easy to collaborate with fellow programmers,
515000	518000	fellow developers, designers, what have you,
518000	521000	and get things done mutually, beneficially.
521000	525000	Our slogan is something close to making collaborative development easier
525000	528000	and I already screwed it up.
528000	531000	Collaborative development easier than by yourself.
531000	533000	Very much the open source movement,
533000	537000	but development in large part is better with multiple people, period.
537000	541000	You yourself personally, I'm not sure that I have a specific use case for.
541000	543000	We're branching out into documentation.
543000	546000	One of the more interesting stories about GitHub last year
546000	552000	was Obama for America had their whole back-end system,
552000	554000	their CMS and everything on GitHub.
554000	557000	And they were actually doing a tour, so they dropped by the office.
557000	559000	They were pretty cool people.
559000	562000	Like writers, designers, developers,
562000	564000	there is a very obvious use case for them
564000	567000	because it's watching your works change through time.
567000	569000	And if something goes wrong, you can go back to it.
569000	571000	It's change control. It's revision control.
571000	573000	You specifically, I'm not sure.
573000	575000	In my day job, I work a lot with,
575000	577000	I've been getting more and more,
577000	579000	just dabbing my big toe into the Visual Basic macros.
579000	580000	Is that something you guys support?
580000	581000	Yeah, absolutely.
581000	584000	The source behind those macros you can put on there,
584000	586000	change them when you need to if something,
586000	588000	if you find that a change...
588000	589000	There you go. You kind of sold me
589000	590000	because actually I had to learn.
590000	592000	Everything I learned about Visual Basic, I Googled.
592000	594000	I didn't take a class or nothing.
594000	596000	I was like, I know this is something possible.
596000	598000	I know if I click here,
598000	600000	I know it can run a macro to copy another cell
600000	602000	and put it on a clipboard and make it plain text
602000	604000	and stitch cells together and all that.
604000	605000	I know that's possible.
605000	606000	And I learned how to do all that through Googling.
606000	609000	But GitHub, I probably could have done it in about a tenth of the time.
609000	610000	Humongous source control warehouse.
611000	612000	Source control database.
612000	614000	Yeah, I don't think about your day job.
614000	616000	I just think about this when I hear about you.
616000	617000	That's right.
617000	618000	You could just use Google
618000	620000	because Google would probably source GitHub
620000	623000	as one of the responses for that.
623000	625000	Fair enough. Fair enough.
625000	627000	That's fine. I do try to keep my day job and night job separate.
627000	629000	Because I don't want the day job knowing I have this gig
629000	630000	where I say fuck a lot.
630000	632000	It's a little unprofessional and so forth.
632000	635000	That trainer has such a potty mouth.
635000	637000	We're going to use it in class.
637000	638000	Mr. Rob is psycho.
638000	640000	Bruce Wayne never goes to any of his functions as Batman.
640000	642000	I mean, it just doesn't make any sense.
642000	643000	It's kind of like that.
643000	645000	That's a very, very good...
645000	646000	And you're the Joker.
646000	647000	No, no.
647000	649000	I can imagine what a board meeting would go like now.
649000	652000	So, Mr. Wayne, have you looked at the financial report?
652000	653000	I'm Batman.
654000	656000	I did not look at the financial report.
657000	658000	Mr. Wayne, are you okay?
659000	660000	I'm fine.
663000	665000	Also say hello joining us in studio.
665000	666000	Say hello, everybody.
668000	669000	That is my Batman voice.
672000	673000	I am Batman.
675000	679000	Say hello, everybody, to Ry Chan is visiting us here in studio as well tonight.
679000	680000	How are you doing?
680000	681000	Not too bad.
682000	683000	I am psycho.
683000	685000	You're looking at me like I'm psycho.
685000	689000	The only thing I have in my head after you use that voice is the Snickers commercial.
691000	693000	Gotta love those old Snickers commercials.
693000	694000	They were great.
694000	695000	So what are you doing here?
695000	696000	You don't work out here.
696000	697000	You're just here for fun.
697000	699000	I actually managed to get a week off work.
699000	700000	You gotta put that mic real close to your mouth.
700000	701000	It's not that sensitive.
701000	703000	I managed to actually get a week off work.
704000	705000	Hooray.
705000	706000	Hooray.
706000	707000	Vacation.
707000	709000	After retail holidays, I am so happy to be out.
709000	710000	Oh, my gosh.
710000	711000	I can only imagine.
711000	715000	I remember from the last time you were here, wasn't it like a crafting type of store or something?
716000	718000	I work in the printing center in an OfficeMax.
718000	719000	Oh, okay.
720000	721000	Why did I get that?
721000	723000	No, it was your other friend that worked in the crafting store.
723000	725000	It was the gal that you brought that one show.
725000	726000	She was pretty cool.
726000	727000	I never met her before.
727000	728000	Oh.
728000	729000	Rachel?
729000	730000	Yeah.
730000	731000	Her mom runs Babetas.
732000	733000	You gotta bring her back someday.
733000	734000	I tried to.
734000	735000	But for now, we got Ry.
735000	736000	I love Ry too.
736000	737000	So it works out.
737000	740000	So Ry, what happens in San Francisco?
740000	742000	What kind of touristy things you've been doing over there?
743000	745000	I just got in yesterday morning.
745000	746000	No.
746000	747000	You haven't had time to do shit.
747000	748000	Nothing yet.
748000	749000	All right.
749000	750000	Anything on the agenda?
751000	752000	Dinner.
752000	753000	Dinner.
753000	755000	Dinner and more dinner and concerts and music and dinner.
755000	758000	And relaxing and sleeping and a little bit of Diablo.
759000	761000	You are a Diablo 3 nut.
761000	762000	I am.
762000	767000	I say that in the most, and it's interesting to me because I really tried to get on the Diablo 3 bandwagon.
767000	771000	You and I even played some games together and I'm just like, it's not WoW.
771000	772000	I can't.
773000	775000	Or it's not Diablo 2 to me.
775000	777000	But Diablo 3, it's working for you.
777000	779000	And I say, great, great.
779000	780000	Good for you.
781000	782000	It's okay.
782000	784000	I may not like the same game that you like.
784000	786000	What is it about Diablo 3 that keeps you coming back though?
786000	791000	Because you're like level 60 plus the uber levels and all that stuff, right?
791000	792000	Yeah.
792000	794000	I've got seven level 60 characters.
794000	799000	I've got, my main character is Paragon 54 right now.
799000	800000	Jesus Christ.
801000	803000	Right now it's more of a social thing for me.
803000	805000	Just kind of hanging out with friends and play.
805000	806000	That's fair.
806000	807000	That's my excuse for WoW.
807000	808000	I have a Paragon.
811000	812000	Do not.
813000	815000	Do not go there.
815000	817000	Can we get through one freaking show?
817000	818000	No.
818000	819000	Without you going there.
819000	820000	All right.
820000	821000	Anyway.
822000	825000	Jamie's sitting in the back going, well, if you have seven of them, why don't you try a Renegade?
825000	827000	Just do the Renegade to get the full story.
827000	828000	Paragon.
828000	829000	Hey, I don't play Renegade.
829000	830000	Have you ever heard of Diablo 3?
830000	831000	Rob!
832000	836000	Who was another person in this room that signed the damn blood pact?
836000	837000	I had to.
837000	838000	I had to.
838000	839000	All right.
839000	840000	Let's see.
840000	841000	So what's your favorite class in Diablo 3?
842000	844000	My monk has been my favorite.
844000	845000	Monks are pretty cool.
845000	847000	I like the witch doctor and I like the monk.
847000	848000	Good times.
848000	850000	Where's PVP?
850000	857000	1.0.7, which the opening notes just came out the other day for.
857000	859000	Is that something you're interested in or you're like meh?
859000	860000	Meh.
860000	861000	Okay.
861000	862000	A dismissive hand wave?
862000	863000	Yeah.
863000	865000	But some of the other stuff coming in.
865000	870000	The MP experience boost and all that kind of stuff is going to be fun.
870000	871000	XP.
871000	872000	Love it.
872000	873000	Yay, more XP.
873000	876000	Did you fool around with Torchlight 2 at all?
876000	877000	I have not.
877000	878000	I take offense to that.
878000	879000	What?
879000	880000	Did she fool?
880000	881000	Okay, sorry.
881000	882000	It's a video game.
882000	885000	I talk about cheating on WoW all the time.
885000	887000	Sometimes you have a relationship with a video game.
887000	888000	I jest.
888000	892000	Have you heard about the story that's floating around the game blogs this week?
892000	893000	Thanks, JB.
893000	894000	What the fuck's so funny?
894000	895000	I jest.
895000	896000	No, no.
896000	899000	Macho Man in chat said new class for Diablo dork.
900000	901000	Shut up, Macho Man.
901000	902000	Alright.
902000	903000	Ooh, burn.
903000	905000	Macho Man, I would be all over that class.
905000	906000	Ooh, yeah.
908000	910000	Snap into a Batman.
910000	911000	Alright, um.
913000	919000	Half Macho Man, half like, I don't know, the penguin from like the 1960s Batman or something.
919000	921000	I don't really know what that is.
921000	922000	Call it 20 minutes into the show.
922000	923000	We've lost it.
923000	924000	Quack, quack, quack.
924000	925000	Um.
926000	928000	That's a good idea there, Loki.
928000	929000	Quack, quack, quack.
929000	930000	Um.
932000	933000	We should just do a show like that.
933000	935000	I could just sit here and do Batman villains live.
935000	937000	Do you want to talk games tonight?
937000	939000	The April 1st, you know, Orange Lounge.
939000	940000	The 500th episode.
940000	941000	We'll just.
941000	942000	Well, not 500.
942000	943000	Oh, yeah, that is 500.
943000	944000	Yeah, remember we talked about this last week.
944000	945000	Goddammit.
946000	950000	Well, there goes my plan to do it like as like all Batman villains because that would
950000	951000	be kind of.
952000	953000	We'll make another show.
953000	957000	I'm sorry, I totally could not make it through an entire show doing the Eartha Kitt Catwoman.
960000	961000	Uh, where was I?
961000	963000	Torchlight 2, Diablo 3.
963000	967000	Yeah, you were starting to ask me about Torchlight.
967000	970000	Yes, I was, but I was also going on the tangent about that story that's around the game blogs
970000	975000	about how people can spend like 250 hours or like 1000 hours with one video game.
975000	976000	I don't know what the fuck they're talking about.
976000	977000	Yeah, look at.
977000	981000	I mean, I'm talking about like what was it like Romancing Saga 3 or like just these these
981000	984000	interesting video games that people are spending tons of time with.
984000	989000	And it's just about you just obsess over that one game and exploring every little nook
989000	990000	and cranny of it.
990000	991000	I don't know.
991000	994000	I don't know anything about my wrong crowd to talk about that story.
994000	998000	I have no idea because nobody sits around trying to get the fly cam to work on Mass Effect
998000	999000	2 for hours.
999000	1002000	I never played that many hours in Grand Theft Auto 4.
1002000	1003000	Why don't you let Rai Chan talk?
1003000	1004000	Walk walk walk.
1004000	1005000	All right.
1006000	1011000	My monk is sitting at about six hundred and fifty five hours last I've checked.
1011000	1013000	That's just my monk.
1013000	1014000	Is that is one.
1014000	1017000	Is there a command in Diablo three like slash played?
1017000	1023000	Because there's a game in World of Warcraft and it's kind of like who's actually willing
1023000	1028000	to type slash played because then it will show you how many hours you've invested on
1028000	1032000	that character in World of Warcraft and it can be very soul breaking.
1032000	1034000	Anybody else can look up that information on a player can't they?
1034000	1038000	Yeah you just look on your profile page and it'll show you how much time you spent with
1038000	1039000	each of your classes.
1039000	1042000	But can other people see that at will whenever you're playing as that character?
1042000	1043000	Yes.
1043000	1044000	Okay.
1044000	1049000	You can see my entire group of characters and how many hours have been spent.
1049000	1053000	The only thing is is that it since I have two monks and two demon hunters it only shows
1053000	1055000	you the top of the two.
1055000	1060000	Do you play with strangers ever or do you only like play exclusively with friends?
1060000	1062000	It depends on who's on.
1062000	1066000	Right now I try to play with friends as much as possible and it's kind of hard because
1066000	1071000	I have so many on there so limit only four players per game.
1071000	1077000	But if other people aren't on then we tend to join in public games right now.
1077000	1082000	What's your best dumbass story from playing with strangers?
1082000	1086000	I think she has a unfortunately it's not it's not a random person but I think one of her
1086000	1089000	recent friends has the best story of the group so far.
1089000	1090000	Even better.
1090000	1093000	No you're not getting the the wife and Skype.
1093000	1095000	Oh shit really?
1095000	1101000	No names no names protect the innocent but just the whole the the long and the short
1101000	1102000	of the long.
1102000	1107000	We're in Gotham City we need to bring these people to justice so we need to hear the story.
1107000	1112000	What it what it amounts to is that Ryan is usually with a group of however many people
1112000	1116000	are actually online on either some kind of a ventrilo Skype whatever conference call.
1116000	1122000	And she was telling me about this story about one of the one of the gamers was playing and
1122000	1128000	the his Skype call was he didn't have headphones on it was playing and his wife hears another
1128000	1129000	woman's voice.
1129000	1133000	And so the two of them are just broadcasting their fight to the whole rest of the party
1133000	1139000	just just flipping their shit because there's some other woman's voice coming from the computer.
1139000	1142000	Yeah just an oh my God you told me that you were going to if you were ever going to be
1142000	1144000	talking to another woman you would tell me about it.
1144000	1145000	No this got it.
1145000	1146000	Oh it was.
1146000	1149000	I think that's the best story she's told me so far.
1149000	1152000	Really woman needs to get over her insecurity issues.
1152000	1153000	Yes.
1153000	1154000	Yeah.
1154000	1157000	Listening to them scream and cuss at each other was not a good thing.
1157000	1161000	It was the most entertaining 30 minutes of your life.
1161000	1163000	That's what she's supposed to say.
1163000	1169000	Well well in and VOG 006 who's in chat.
1169000	1172000	It was actually the other person who was in with us.
1172000	1175000	He hasn't figured out yet how to go through and change it.
1175000	1177000	But he he's in there.
1177000	1179000	New users new listeners.
1179000	1181000	We love them slash Nick.
1181000	1182000	All right.
1182000	1183000	Oh Nick please not so quick.
1183000	1184000	All right.
1184000	1185000	Welcome to the show.
1185000	1187000	I hope things go well.
1187000	1188000	It's good to be back.
1188000	1191000	Hope we get some more embarrassing stories throughout the night especially about other people.
1191000	1192000	Those are the best kind.
1192000	1193000	All right.
1193000	1196000	Let's talk about our gaming ways and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1196000	1200000	Maybe it's you know more Diablo 3 or in Dark Soccer's case.
1200000	1203000	I can't possibly imagine what she's been playing but I'm going to go over there and ask anyway.
1203000	1204000	Dark Soccer.
1204000	1207000	How was your gaming playing a healthy this kiss my ass.
1207000	1213000	No I played I played some well because I don't kick.
1213000	1216000	I don't kiss as I kick it.
1216000	1217000	OK.
1217000	1222000	Someone get that man a lozenge.
1222000	1234000	So yeah I've I played some well and which Rob can vouch for since I chatted with him on while and we made my Jane Shepherd because I hate playing monks.
1234000	1236000	Actually I don't like monks.
1236000	1238000	Not much.
1238000	1244000	I actually I really hate the animations for monks on blood elves are just too skinny.
1244000	1261000	I also played Mass Effect 3 and Mass Effect 2 and I've actually my time in Mass Effect 2 has been nothing but trying to get fly cam to work which I have it working in everything except conversation modes although I did figure out the debug cam but it's still kind of a pain in the ass.
1261000	1267000	I found out though interesting rendering issues that happen in the game when you try to enable the debug cam.
1267000	1272000	So I'm also playing limbo which I'm really not very good at.
1272000	1273000	I started playing that on the train again.
1273000	1276000	I wanted to kind of get through some of those puzzles that I hadn't done in a while.
1276000	1281000	I can't get past the damn block floating in the water.
1281000	1283000	Like do you crawl over it and then make it float or?
1283000	1287000	You use the block to get a rope that's slightly hidden behind a tree.
1287000	1289000	The fuck? How am I supposed to see that?
1289000	1300000	You you you grab the block you pull it back there's a little rope and you can scale the trees on their edges and there's a more or less broken branch that you push over it falls to the ground you push it over the water.
1300000	1301000	The fuck?
1301000	1303000	You're at the very baby steps of that game. Oh wow.
1303000	1308000	I know but I get pissed off and then it's like well fuck this noise I'm not gonna play anymore.
1308000	1330000	That's a lot of the trick that's like the I don't want to call it the gimmick of the game because the design in general is really fantastic and it doesn't it doesn't abuse that but that's very much the the gimmick of the game is that the the scaling and the directional because you know it has the whole background foreground covers that it'll kind of do the foreground to trick your eyes when you're going forward and reset you from what's actually in the playable game.
1331000	1341000	But yeah grab the block bring it back look for a tiny little rope dangling from the tree scale up you'll find a break in a tree action push.
1341000	1343000	Okay I'm doing that tonight you know.
1343000	1347000	And now I wonder though if it's one of the games they've enabled with Linux yet.
1347000	1351000	I have not been keeping any look at that library whatsoever.
1351000	1359000	Anybody? Linux? Limbo? I mean it is Mac compatible so hopefully it's easy enough to bring to the whole saga.
1359000	1369000	I just don't think it would be too hard for my netbook to handle the game but it's actually one that I can just actually leave on a screen and look around because I think it's pretty.
1369000	1374000	Yeah it's two two tones the the the look of that game is ridiculously good.
1374000	1379000	I love monochromatic stuff and then I've actually started drawing again.
1379000	1381000	Yay drawing!
1381000	1394000	Well I know I've talked about it on the show before but with my hand injury after my surgery I had a really hard time drawing because if I keep my hand in one position too long it'll cramp up really badly and painfully.
1394000	1398000	I haven't been able to break down the scar tissue in my hand.
1398000	1405000	So I found out the hard way that the pressure sensitivity in my tablet went out.
1405000	1413000	So I actually took out paper and pencil and started drawing my one of my femsheps just drawing.
1413000	1421000	And I got I managed to draw something I was in a lot of pain when I was done but I drew something and that's related to video games because of Garris.
1421000	1424000	Okay femshep. Oh my god Rob.
1424000	1427000	Trufflemania has landed on the Orange Lounge radio table.
1427000	1433000	Hello my name is Jamie and I like to do drawings.
1433000	1435000	You know what's funny? What?
1435000	1443000	I spent two hours watching episodes of Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings.
1443000	1449000	Which have you ever seen what that skit came from Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings?
1449000	1455000	Wait the one that was on Saturday Night Live that Mike Myers did?
1455000	1461000	Yeah I grew up watching Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings and I thought no one else had heard of it until I found out another friend of mine had.
1461000	1464000	No I knew it was based on like a real thing so good times.
1464000	1468000	Alright then I guess we're on to Loki. How was your game week?
1468000	1477000	I played lots of Skyrim because I was working on getting the PC version. Well I got the PC version working of course.
1477000	1484000	But I loaded on about I think I have 97 mods running right now.
1485000	1495000	And the whole point was I wanted to add a bunch of stuff to the game so that it would seem not necessarily new but like I would forget what mods I put on there.
1495000	1500000	So I wouldn't know if like hey I just haven't run across this yet or hey this is something new.
1500000	1505000	So I did that and my character is really overpowered and stuff but it's kind of fun.
1505000	1509000	And of course I had to mess with everything.
1509000	1520000	Got super jumping, got this really creepy puppet master thing where there's these puppets that run around that you can summon that are really creepy looking.
1520000	1527000	And then I have the mod where you can summon a bear that plays Miserulu which is awesome.
1530000	1531000	Wait what?
1531000	1545000	It's a bear that plays Miserulu. It was great too because I really need to start broadcasting or recording this stuff because I was in a dungeon and you're supposed to be sneaking around or whatever to attack people.
1545000	1555000	So what did I do? I spawned my puppet thing who ran down and charged after them. I spawned the bear that started playing Miserulu and I jumped down and hit him with a squeaky bat.
1556000	1562000	If you are interested in broadcasting on the OLR broadcast channel I can give you all that information and the software. The software is free.
1562000	1563000	Okay.
1563000	1564000	So yeah.
1564000	1565000	That might be fun.
1565000	1566000	Not breaking any rules.
1566000	1582000	So I've been playing a lot of that and played a little bit of well actually played quite a bit of Borderlands 2 this week. Finished the single player campaign and yeah we cheated.
1582000	1589000	But that's alright though because it's a lot more fun when we have really overpowered guns. A lot more fun.
1589000	1594000	So we did that and what else?
1594000	1598000	Do you own Borderlands on both the 360 and the PC?
1598000	1603000	I have Borderlands 1 on PC and 360. I have Borderlands 2 only on 360.
1603000	1604000	Okay.
1605000	1612000	I have Borderlands 1 on PlayStation 3 and PC but that's because PS3 did the whole free with PlayStation Plus and I was like what the hell? Why not?
1612000	1616000	Nuts to lack of cross platform multiplayer. As always.
1617000	1630000	And then today I tried playing Forza Horizon although I see I was going to play because I have the Microsoft racing wheel and I've been meaning to try that out.
1630000	1642000	So the first thing I started trying to use the right racing wheel and I realized oh I need the AC adapter plugged in there because you have to have a battery pack and an AC adapter for the damn thing to work which is really ridiculous.
1642000	1656000	So I did that and then when I tried syncing the racing wheel with the 360 I broke the, well I temporarily broke the sync button on the racing wheel so I had to take the whole thing apart to fix that.
1656000	1666000	So I got that fixed. Finally with like 5 minutes left before I had to leave I got to play with the steering wheel and I realized I don't like the steering wheel.
1667000	1679000	It kind of, well it doesn't suck but it's just like I oversteer so easy on that thing it's just not very comfortable and also I didn't really have it set up on like a TV stand or something like that.
1679000	1688000	I'm not sure that thing was made for the type of arcade racer that Forza Horizon is anyway. I mean Forza Horizon and like Forza 4 control very differently.
1689000	1694000	So yeah I'm probably not going to play with that because it's kind of a pain in the ass to set all that up.
1694000	1702000	But I wanted to have used it for something because it was going to be used on the arcade cabinet but I just haven't gotten around to doing anything with it.
1702000	1711000	So I just kind of like hey I have this thing I'm going to try it out and see if it's any good and it's alright but controller is probably going to be the way I go with that.
1712000	1723000	And then what else did I play? I played a bit of Modern Warfare 3. I think we played about a day of that. No it was alright.
1725000	1730000	I've been trying to play a lot more stuff on my Steam account. I've been downloading things.
1730000	1732000	Make use out of it. Good man.
1733000	1734000	Yeah.
1734000	1735000	Alright. Anything else?
1736000	1737000	That's it yeah.
1737000	1741000	Then let us go over to I guess I'll go and then our guests can go.
1741000	1745000	As far as my gaming week honestly not a whole lot of new stuff.
1745000	1753000	You know this is kind of a time to catch up and to be fair I've been playing a lot of WoW because I'm trying to gear up a character so that she's ready to raid.
1753000	1756000	Because we're having some changes in our raiding roster.
1756000	1759000	When there was some other changes with guilds and things like that.
1759000	1760000	That is all on Hoard House.
1760000	1763000	By the way just I got to plug the other show I do.
1763000	1766000	Best Little Hoard House in Azeroth. Hoardhouse.com.
1766000	1769000	We had an epic show this week and if you like reality television at all.
1769000	1772000	We had Ronnie who was on Big Brother CBS a couple years ago.
1772000	1775000	Was our guest because he was like the video game nerd on his season.
1775000	1778000	Well like he legit he knows his shit with WoW and he was on the show.
1778000	1781000	So it was a great show so please please check it out at Hoardhouse.com.
1781000	1784000	Even if you don't like reality TV it was still a fun show and we talked Warcraft.
1784000	1787000	So that kind of took up a lot of my time.
1787000	1791000	But I did I you know I actually was using Netflix on the Wii U.
1791000	1793000	I know that's not a game but it's kind of my preferred Netflix device.
1793000	1795000	I was watching a movie the other night.
1795000	1800000	And then I was playing on the 3DS the demo for Mutant Mudds.
1800000	1803000	Which I liked it's like a kind of like an 8-bit platformer.
1803000	1807000	But the whole fact that you can jump into the background and you come up into the foreground.
1807000	1810000	The 3D kind of lends itself very well to that whole thing.
1810000	1813000	But you know if you like retro games I'm sure Mutant Mudds is something that's right up your alley.
1813000	1816000	And there's the demo so go check it out for 30 plays.
1816000	1821000	And kind of because of Shane I found my copy of Pokemon Pearl.
1821000	1824000	And it's always Shane's fault. Fucker.
1824000	1826000	He is such a dealer.
1826000	1829000	In a way in a way I mean I've done it to him too.
1829000	1833000	It goes both ways but the talk of the new Pokemon games.
1833000	1836000	I'm not going to spoil it because I know there's a news story coming up on it earlier.
1836000	1838000	But I think we all know new Pokemon games were announced this week.
1838000	1841000	And so I was asking questions about can you send Pokemon back and forth.
1841000	1846000	Because the new game looks like it fixes like a lot of the problems I've had with the older games.
1846000	1853000	And the older games I'm like they haven't they don't look any fucking different than they did in the original black and white Game Boy.
1853000	1858000	Like they don't like yeah they're in color and there's extra things but they've changed very little.
1858000	1863000	First rule of Nintendo development. Don't change anything unless you really have to.
1863000	1868000	But this new one looks really like they have like totally redone it.
1868000	1872000	So I'm very excited about that. We'll talk more about the reboots later.
1872000	1875000	Or I shouldn't say reboot. How it's not a reboot. We'll talk about that later.
1876000	1885000	But then I got it got me to thinking I'm like well I kind of want to I want to be able to like be really cool and have like Pokemon from the old games that I can transfer into the new games.
1885000	1892000	Because I guess every Pokemon game has to have the coding and the programming for every single stinking Pokemon before it.
1892000	1900000	Because you transfer from one game to like I guess even the newest like black to white to have the classic Pokemon red and blue characters in them.
1900000	1908000	Because it is possible to have like a what's a what's a great Pokemon from the red blue era. Let's say Jinx to have a Jinx.
1908000	1913000	Porygon! Like like traitor all the way up. It's possible.
1913000	1916000	So I'm kind of like well maybe I should just make use of the Pokemon games I have.
1916000	1923000	I played for 30 minutes and I was like I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do this for 40 hours or however long it takes to play a game. But we'll see.
1923000	1926000	How do you transfer your collections all the way up like that?
1926000	1929000	There's ways to do it. You have to you have to have the right systems and the right.
1929000	1938000	But like you know in the original DS's had the well the Game Boy Advances could read both regular Game Boy games and advanced games.
1938000	1941000	So I'm sure you can connect the two together and do it that way.
1941000	1947000	Okay and then the DS's had the advanced port and the regular port like the original ones.
1947000	1948000	Yeah the Fats did.
1948000	1950000	So you could do it that way and then.
1950000	1952000	And now DS is an upper all network based.
1952000	1954000	They're all network based exactly so now you do it that way.
1954000	1955000	Wow.
1955000	1963000	That's crazy to think that Nintendo still has like a straight line of interconnection with at least one generation like that.
1963000	1968000	Technist in our chatroom says I haven't played Pokemon since Red, Blue, Yellow. Well in my opinion Technist you haven't missed much.
1968000	1969000	Same.
1969000	1975000	But these new ones look like it's gonna really correct that.
1975000	1979000	I tried to jump back in. We have Diamond and Pearl.
1979000	1980000	We do have Diamond and Pearl.
1981000	1996000	I told myself that I love the concept of what you can do with Pokemon and I would jump into it when I feel that the features, the hardware is available to make really cool features and so we both bought into Diamond and Pearl.
1996000	2000000	I played it for an hour or two maybe and I just said ehhh.
2000000	2005000	And now I find out that Black 2 and White 2 are original DS and not 3DS.
2005000	2013000	I don't really remember what my complaint about that was but it just surprised me because it came out well after the 3DS was in existence.
2013000	2020000	Of course I haven't played regularly since Yellow. I actually still have the Game Boy, the special Game Boy from Yellow.
2020000	2021000	Yes you do.
2021000	2024000	Let's see going to some comments from our chatters at live.vognetwork.com.
2024000	2030000	AlphaCananagram says Skye, Pokemon kind of changed in a certain generation stats wise where it couldn't go up?
2030000	2035000	SSJ100Matt says the farthest back you can go are the Game Boy Advance Leaf, Green, Fire, Red games.
2035000	2037000	Well it wouldn't surprise me if Shane lied to me y'all.
2037000	2039000	I got all this from Shane so take it up with him.
2039000	2042000	Alright he can call in later to defend himself.
2043000	2048000	I'll go ahead and share the details of a private chat we were having between Shane and I.
2048000	2051000	He was asking what starter Pokemon I picked in Pearl and what I named him.
2051000	2056000	Because I just remembered he did have a really great name for his, what is it, Chimchar?
2056000	2058000	Is it a little monkey? A little fire monkey?
2058000	2060000	Umm, Chim...
2060000	2061000	Yeah it's Chimchar.
2061000	2063000	I don't think so that doesn't sound right.
2063000	2067000	Well he named his Chimchar which we're going to call it now until the chatter corrects us.
2067000	2070000	He named his Chimchar, Ho-Monkey.
2072000	2074000	Think about it, Ho-Monkey.
2074000	2076000	Homo and Key.
2076000	2078000	Homo, Homo and Key. Get it?
2078000	2080000	So I said well what do I name him?
2080000	2082000	Name yours Flaming Finger.
2082000	2085000	No, I picked a Piplup because they're little penguins and penguins are adorable right?
2085000	2091000	And I was like well I didn't think to give it a dirty name because I need to know their regular name.
2091000	2094000	I can't remember my name and their name.
2094000	2097000	Like if you want me to learn Pokemon I just need to call it what it is right?
2097000	2101000	I very rarely, I think I do this in any RPG I play.
2101000	2103000	I don't change their names. I need to know their regular names.
2103000	2105000	So in your head Sanrio's name is Kat?
2105000	2107000	Yes.
2107000	2109000	So...
2109000	2111000	Sharmi was other Kat.
2111000	2115000	So Shane suggested I call, I should go back and call him Penisquin.
2115000	2117000	Didn't even think about that.
2117000	2119000	Didn't even think about that.
2119000	2123000	Alright and Misty in chat by the way says it is Chimchar Jason.
2123000	2125000	I thought we were still talking original 151.
2125000	2127000	You are. Oh then you're thinking Charizard.
2127000	2129000	No I'm thinking Chim...
2129000	2131000	Chim...
2131000	2133000	Oh Charmander.
2133000	2137000	I remember Mankey and for the life of me I can't think of the evolved version of it.
2139000	2141000	I named my Mankey a very dirty word in Japanese.
2141000	2143000	Alright anyhow.
2143000	2149000	So now that I've been talking about Pokemon on this show for 10 minutes we should probably move on with other gaming.
2149000	2151000	I was going to say one more thing about Forza Horizon.
2151000	2157000	Of course obviously the one thing that's blatantly in your face is that stupid festival.
2157000	2161000	Which I was like oh my god I don't fucking care about the god damn festival I want to race.
2161000	2163000	I want to race. I don't care about it.
2163000	2165000	You'll get it.
2165000	2167000	That was the same thing that bothered me at first.
2167000	2169000	That slowly slips into the background.
2169000	2171000	It doesn't matter anymore. You'll be fine.
2171000	2173000	Thank you for bringing that up because I did spend a night on Forza Horizon.
2173000	2175000	We had a fun night.
2175000	2178000	Some of the VoG people. It was myself, Bobby, ActDeft, SSJ100Matt.
2178000	2180000	We were all playing and it was a good time.
2180000	2182000	So we'll probably do that again during the week.
2182000	2185000	So keep an eye on Twitter for when we're going to play some Forza Horizon.
2186000	2188000	Because that's a fun game.
2188000	2190000	So how do you add the VoG Car Club thing?
2190000	2192000	Because I couldn't find that option.
2192000	2194000	Of course I only looked for about a minute.
2194000	2196000	I'll invite you.
2196000	2198000	If somebody hasn't already done it by the time those words left my mouth.
2198000	2203000	Because if you're on the friends list of ActDeft or Bobby or somebody.
2203000	2205000	They just go into the car club. They can find you.
2205000	2207000	But I think for other people.
2207000	2210000	I think when you go to the car club you can search for VoG.
2210000	2212000	V-O-G.
2212000	2214000	And that's the tag. V-O-G.
2214000	2216000	It's easy to find.
2216000	2218000	Alright, let's move on.
2218000	2220000	Less Pokey, more me.
2220000	2222000	Yes, less Pokey, more Jason.
2222000	2225000	Pokey Jason, how was your gaming week?
2225000	2227000	I have no idea how to respond to that.
2227000	2229000	I didn't know this was that kind of show.
2229000	2231000	Hey, at least I didn't call you home monkey.
2231000	2233000	Alright.
2233000	2236000	I have been a very bad gamer.
2236000	2240000	Like I believe I said at the top of the show.
2240000	2242000	I was out here in November.
2242000	2245000	I spent Christmas with my family in western Colorado.
2245000	2251000	So I was away from all of my exciting electronic video boxes.
2251000	2255000	I haven't played very much in a very long time.
2255000	2258000	I had the discussion with Jamie that I kind of started to poke back into limbo.
2258000	2260000	Because it sounded interesting.
2260000	2263000	But my go to hobby is turning into music.
2263000	2265000	And that's taking over quite a bit.
2265000	2269000	Because I don't know that I've even touched Borderlands 2 since October.
2269000	2271000	Maybe November.
2271000	2274000	I just... I play lots of tiny little things.
2274000	2277000	Like I have stupid apps on my phone.
2277000	2279000	I touch my 3S every once in a great while.
2279000	2281000	But I just don't...
2281000	2284000	There's nothing that I have that dedication to right now.
2284000	2286000	I'll tell you a secret.
2286000	2288000	Mixing music is something I've kind of always wanted to get into as well.
2288000	2291000	I've tried. I've downloaded programs to try and do it.
2291000	2293000	But you can't do it software only.
2293000	2295000	I took the plunge.
2295000	2298000	I made the $500 investment to get a controller that appealed to...
2298000	2304000	The $500 investment more like $1500 after my case, speakers, mixer, cables, and shit.
2304000	2307000	Alan! That's what I want for my birthday.
2308000	2313000	And that's kind of where I'm at right now.
2313000	2316000	I pick up new music. I play around with it.
2316000	2319000	I find ways to put it into mixes.
2319000	2320000	Are you playing dubstep?
2320000	2323000	No. I was actually...
2323000	2325000	I've been asked that sarcastically.
2325000	2328000	But I've gotten a few no shit requests about it.
2328000	2330000	And I started thinking about my library.
2330000	2333000	I'm like, well I have Skrillex because I was on that bandwagon.
2333000	2335000	Look at your library. Look at your choices.
2335000	2340000	If my choices are based off my library, I have very few complaints.
2340000	2343000	You actually just made me think of something though.
2343000	2348000	There's a YouTube video of a cockatiel trilling dubstep.
2349000	2355000	Because you know birds adapt to sounds around them into their language?
2355000	2359000	The bird speaks dubstep.
2359000	2362000	I definitely need to see this sometime.
2362000	2368000	People want some music to be played at a party or whatever.
2368000	2371000	I've gotten completely serious requests to play something like that.
2371000	2373000	And I just kind of think of what I have in my library.
2373000	2375000	And it's like, I know a couple of these artists.
2375000	2376000	I have a couple of one-offs.
2377000	2380000	I have Skrillex because everybody jumped on that bandwagon.
2380000	2383000	Some people call knife party dubstep even though they are not.
2383000	2386000	But I could not play 30 minutes worth.
2386000	2388000	Get Nero. Nero's awesome.
2388000	2389000	Nero's...
2389000	2394000	House dubstep and... what else does he do? Drum and bass.
2394000	2397000	Yeah, I really enjoy Nero. I just don't have very much of his stuff.
2398000	2402000	In all fairness, because I don't want the dubstep fans to email the show.
2402000	2404000	I hate you. Wub wub wub.
2407000	2414000	I acquired the new Muse album this past week, which is a great album.
2414000	2418000	One of their songs though is a little bit dubstep experimentation.
2418000	2420000	It's the best song on the whole album. It really is.
2420000	2422000	It really is, for real.
2422000	2427000	Yeah, my two joints right now are the general house genre.
2427000	2430000	It's kind of progressive, electro, maybe down to trance.
2430000	2435000	But then I play a lot of UK and Happy Hardcore that I've enjoyed for a very long time.
2435000	2438000	And now I can actually do something interesting with it, so that's been pretty fun.
2438000	2444000	And the great culmination of that is that my company, my employer, is putting on two shows this week.
2444000	2450000	Tuesday at Mighty Down in San Francisco and Thursday a very public event at Public Works San Francisco.
2450000	2456000	And I'm going to be on stage and I am freaking scared and excited and crazy.
2456000	2458000	You're going to be like closely about to get on a roller coaster at Disneyland.
2458000	2460000	Yes, very much so.
2461000	2463000	Right.
2463000	2466000	Ry, how was your gaming week? What kind of video games have you been playing lately?
2466000	2467000	Diablo?
2467000	2471000	Not 24-7, but for the most of it.
2471000	2475000	Just 22-7, you know. I need a couple of hours of work.
2475000	2482000	Yeah, I went from Paragon, I believe, 47 up to 54 the past week.
2482000	2485000	Running public games and whatnot.
2486000	2491000	The only other thing that I've played recently was Lego Lord of the Rings that I got for my birthday.
2491000	2493000	Oh, of course.
2493000	2496000	I really haven't gotten very far in it.
2496000	2497000	Because?
2497000	2500000	Diablo 3.
2500000	2504000	That's like a lot of games for me in World of Warcraft, so I don't feel bad.
2504000	2506000	Alright.
2506000	2510000	Well, I hope you can discover some more games in the coming weeks.
2510000	2513000	Because eventually you're going to hit Paragon 60 and then what?
2513000	2514000	Paragon 100.
2515000	2519000	60 is the standard level cap, but Paragon is 100.
2519000	2522000	And that's of course also per character.
2522000	2524000	She has... no?
2524000	2527000	No, I am done after I get this character.
2527000	2529000	That's what they all say, huh?
2529000	2532000	It can be. Paragon is still specific to a character.
2532000	2536000	And should she want to, she does have six other characters anyways.
2536000	2537000	Alright, anyhow.
2537000	2543000	Not to mention the fact that there's an achievement for getting ten level 60s and having two of each class at level 60.
2543000	2545000	She has the plan.
2545000	2546000	It's all about the achievements.
2546000	2548000	Actually, that was another thing I was doing this week.
2548000	2550000	I was trying to achievement hunt in old games.
2550000	2552000	Okay, guys.
2552000	2554000	Guess what game I played this week just to get an achievement.
2554000	2555000	Yars.
2555000	2557000	Worse. Worse.
2557000	2558000	Dino Dash.
2558000	2561000	What is an Xbox Live Arcade game worse than Yaris and worse than Dino Dash?
2561000	2563000	Avatar.
2563000	2565000	Worse than Avatar.
2565000	2567000	Um...
2567000	2569000	Xbox Live Arcade.
2570000	2573000	It's offensive to anybody who listened to this show earlier today.
2573000	2576000	Yes, I would say it beat and groovy.
2576000	2578000	Beat and groovy. I played beat and groovy this week.
2578000	2580000	Oh, shame on you.
2580000	2581000	And I got a new achievement.
2581000	2582000	To put money into that.
2582000	2585000	I had to play every song in three button mode.
2585000	2587000	I was so bored.
2587000	2589000	And like, Alan walked out into the room.
2589000	2591000	He's like, this looks bad.
2591000	2592000	What is this?
2592000	2593000	I'm like, it's on Xbox Live Arcade.
2593000	2595000	I'm like, doesn't it look like it's PlayStation 1?
2595000	2598000	He's like, yeah, look at those character animations.
2598000	2600000	Those are real next-gen right there.
2600000	2602000	So...
2602000	2603000	Yeah.
2603000	2604000	I had one of those weeks.
2604000	2605000	Shame. Shame.
2605000	2606000	That's just a travesty.
2606000	2607000	No, shame to chat.
2607000	2608000	Alright.
2611000	2612000	I found something for you.
2612000	2613000	Oh, this is for me.
2613000	2614000	So this is...
2614000	2615000	Oh, yes. Okay.
2615000	2618000	Because earlier when you were talking about the bird singing dubstep, I'm like...
2618000	2619000	Oh boy.
2619000	2622000	This show's been derailed seven times from Sunday already.
2622000	2623000	So...
2623000	2624000	What the hell?
2624000	2626000	What's another video gonna add to it?
2626000	2627000	Okay, here we go.
2627000	2628000	I think that's the one.
2628000	2630000	So this is bird singing dubstep.
2630000	2632000	If there's an ad on this, so help me God.
2632000	2633000	So help me God.
2633000	2634000	Rod, it's not my fault.
2634000	2636000	You need to have your ad block up.
2636000	2637000	You're using Chrome, right?
2637000	2638000	No, you're not.
2638000	2639000	Why are you using Chrome?
2639000	2640000	Firefox.
2640000	2641000	Shame on you.
2641000	2642000	That's it.
2642000	2657000	That's it.
2657000	2664000	The funny thing is that actually sounds like some pretty impressive beatboxing to an extent.
2664000	2666000	Stupid bird.
2666000	2671000	My sister's birds would probably be something like that.
2671000	2676000	She has a bird that's exactly like that.
2676000	2683000	I like that it's dancing.
2683000	2685000	I could just listen to that for three hours.
2685000	2688000	I could see the appeal of dubstep.
2688000	2690000	I could totally just listen to that tonight.
2690000	2691000	Let's go to break, you guys.
2691000	2696000	We're gonna have our music break tonight.
2696000	2699000	Coming soon to DDR.
2699000	2700000	You know what's funny though?
2700000	2705000	Actually birds like in the wild will pick up sounds from civilization around them and
2705000	2707000	really incorporate that into their bird calls.
2707000	2711000	Like I've heard birds do car alarms and construction sites.
2711000	2716000	I've heard sounds of birds that sound like they're drilling, like in heavy construction
2716000	2717000	sites.
2717000	2719000	SSJ100 Matt in our chat room says, congrats.
2719000	2722000	OLR has found the end of the internet.
2722000	2723000	That's right.
2723000	2725000	We have collectively been eaten by a group.
2725000	2726000	Good night everybody.
2726000	2728000	You've been listening to Orange Lounge.
2728000	2729000	I don't know.
2729000	2733000	I was just saying, tard's been replaced by dubstep bird.
2733000	2734000	I don't know.
2734000	2740000	I think Polly, the x-rated parrot might be a little, uh, you know, that came and went
2740000	2741000	though.
2741000	2742000	No, it's not Polly.
2742000	2743000	It's Ruby.
2743000	2744000	Oh yeah, that.
2744000	2745000	All right.
2745000	2747000	Let's, let's move on into some housekeeping.
2747000	2751000	Facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, twitter.com slash OLR.
2751000	2753000	You can also hear this show in Stitcher.
2753000	2757000	Use thumbs up a lot if you listen there and share with all your friends and spread the
2757000	2764000	word cause you know, I can't imagine why word of the show doesn't spread like wildfire across
2764000	2765000	the masses.
2765000	2770000	By the way, speaking of popularity contests, uh, the podcast awards happened this past
2770000	2772000	week and we didn't win.
2772000	2774000	Uh, that's too bad.
2774000	2775000	And I want to give a shout out.
2775000	2779000	I got to give a shout out to my twitter buddy cause us independent podcasts have to stick
2779000	2780000	together.
2780000	2784000	I got to give a shout out to my twitter buddy Godfrey from a gamer tag radio and you know,
2784000	2787000	he, that is a hard working guy.
2787000	2789000	Uh, and he is very good at promoting his show.
2789000	2793000	He's a very passionate podcaster and I honest to God thought he was going to win it.
2793000	2794000	I really did.
2794000	2798000	And you know, it was kind of that thing where it's like, I'd love to win it, but if Godfrey
2798000	2801000	won it, it's hard to be mad because you know, he's been nominated several times.
2801000	2805000	He's, he's at this point they're becoming like the Susan Lucci of the podcast awards.
2805000	2807000	And so it's like, let the, let the guy win already.
2807000	2808000	He didn't win either.
2808000	2812000	And I was, I was like legit upset that he didn't win and we didn't win.
2812000	2815000	So Rob was doing that thing where he fans his face a little bit.
2815000	2816000	I won't cry.
2816000	2820000	I'm not going to Las Vegas cause Godfrey is probably going to win this year.
2820000	2822000	So I'll watch the speech from home.
2822000	2826000	And then when he didn't win, I'm like, Oh God, that poor guy went all the way to Vegas.
2826000	2830000	But it sounds like he had some great inspiration and all that and got to meet some really cool
2830000	2831000	people and do the networking.
2831000	2835000	So shame on me for not going to Vegas, but I'm broke.
2835000	2837000	I am broke.
2837000	2838000	Christmas broke me.
2838000	2841000	So this was not a good time of the year for the podcast.
2841000	2844000	Anyway, uh, that is it, uh, for housekeeping.
2844000	2846000	Let's get into some gaming news.
2846000	2847000	Loki.
2847000	2848000	All right.
2848000	2852000	So let's talk a little bit about CES fun stuff.
2852000	2857000	And of course one of the big major announcements, um, gaming wise, they kind of happened a little
2857000	2863000	bit before CES even began was the new Nvidia handheld console that they're putting out.
2863000	2871000	It's the Nvidia shield and it's a Tegra four, um, based handheld system.
2871000	2875000	And it kind of looks like a controller with a screen attached to it.
2875000	2879000	And what's kind of unique about it though, aside from the fact that it looks like an
2879000	2883000	Xbox three 60 controller and has the kind of almost the same button configuration.
2883000	2888000	That thing is that, uh, first off the display is pretty high def.
2888000	2890000	It's a seven 20 P display.
2890000	2896000	Um, and of course, one of the things you can do with it is run Android games, obviously,
2896000	2904000	because it is running Android and you can even run, um, PC games on there by streaming
2904000	2906000	them to your system.
2906000	2911000	And they even have a way to, you know, it has an HDMI out on it, so you can play it
2911000	2913000	on your TV if you want.
2913000	2918000	Um, but the whole fact that you can basically put in this mode where you stream stuff from
2918000	2922000	your PC and you can even bring up steam and play like, you know, console games on that
2922000	2924000	is kind of cool.
2924000	2929000	Um, I can stream anything I want from my, uh, PC to the gaming handheld.
2929000	2935000	Um, I guess whatever supported from it, but yeah, so number of seconds before porn is
2935000	2939000	displayed on one of these devices that has a web, it has a web browser in it cause it's
2939000	2940000	Android.
2940000	2942000	So yes, it would be no time whatsoever.
2942000	2946000	But if you think about it though, if you can stream from your PC and I'm assuming though
2946000	2952000	that you can only do this, um, over LAN, I don't think it's actually, you know, over
2952000	2957000	the internet, but you could probably do World of Warcraft, you know, sitting in bed with
2957000	2959000	the controller and stuff like that.
2959000	2961000	You know, I don't know how you could do a lot sitting in bed.
2961000	2963000	Yeah.
2963000	2965000	No chat though.
2965000	2971000	Hypothetically, hypothetically, if I happen to have a TV in my bedroom, I could have boobies
2971000	2974000	on the TV and boobies on the little handheld.
2974000	2975000	Yes.
2975000	2976000	Here dog, I heard you like boobs.
2976000	2979000	So here's some boobs while you're watching boobs.
2979000	2982000	Um, but that's what technology is all about y'all.
2982000	2987000	So yeah, they have, they have the whole, you know, steam big, uh, big picture mode support
2987000	2988000	on there.
2988000	2990000	Um, no price announced yet for it.
2990000	2994000	And obviously, you know, because it's one of the first to fry or devices that has a
2994000	2998000	ticker form a chip and it's, it'll be interesting to see what it can run.
2998000	3001000	Um, they're saying, you know, more console quality games.
3001000	3006000	Uh, some of the games that they have announced for it, Hawken, which was a PC kind of a mech
3006000	3010000	shooter and actually, um, what was that?
3010000	3013000	One of the other titles was an old Wii game.
3013000	3018000	The conduit is going to be getting like some sort of, you know, souped up version.
3018000	3019000	They'll be on Android.
3019000	3023000	Um, so there's that stuff.
3023000	3026000	And then of course, you know, some other, you know, Android games, there's going to
3026000	3028000	be more tear for games coming out.
3028000	3029000	Um, Nope.
3029000	3030000	And like I said, no price point yet.
3030000	3034000	That's kind of, everyone's like, Oh, it's going to kill the Ouya and stuff like that.
3034000	3036000	They haven't announced the price yet.
3036000	3041000	And the fact that, you know, this thing has got a display on it and the Tegra four, it's
3041000	3044000	most likely not going to be within that $99 price point.
3044000	3047000	So I don't know.
3047000	3048000	It'll be interesting to see.
3048000	3052000	I think it's kind of exciting though, because you know, I've been looking forward to possibly
3052000	3057000	making a computer that'll be hooked up to my TV at someday to use kind of like steam
3058000	3059000	big picture mode.
3059000	3063000	And you know, the fact that I'll be able to stream stuff to a separate screen, kind of
3063000	3067000	like you can with the Wii U would be kind of, kind of fun, you know, and actually be
3067000	3072000	able to, when the wife is hogging the TV, you know, as she's been doing for the last
3072000	3073000	three months,
3073000	3076000	a lot of people on the internet dismissing this as unnecessary.
3076000	3080000	Uh, you know, why, why does Nvidia have to get into this too?
3080000	3082000	Why they do their own hand?
3082000	3086000	They have the chip and I think they've done their own like tablets or they've, I mean,
3086000	3087000	they're providing chips for tablets.
3087000	3088000	Why not?
3088000	3092000	I mean, they've got the Nvidia zone thing for their Tegra stuff, the Tegra 3 stuff.
3092000	3097000	So because they can, I mean, they're already in the PC marketplace.
3097000	3100000	If you think about it though, this technology, that's the only thing.
3100000	3104000	You're going to need a really high end graphics card in order to run this because it's built
3104000	3108000	into your graphics card as far as being able to stream to this device.
3108000	3113000	So really new high end graphics card and it has to be the Nvidia card.
3113000	3117000	So that's why they're in this is because, oh, that's a really cool device.
3117000	3121000	Oh crap, got to upgrade my graphics card and I have to buy Nvidia.
3121000	3123000	So that means more money for them.
3123000	3127000	It's win-win because they sell the device in the graphics card.
3127000	3130000	So when I first read about this, I was quick to blame the Ouya for this.
3130000	3135000	I don't know what it is, but I, I, there was a part of me that said Nvidia is doing this
3135000	3139000	because of the Ouya and because of the way the Ouya took off, Nvidia said, you know,
3140000	3145000	you know what Ouya's got wrong about this is that Ouya's making them, making you hook it up to a TV.
3145000	3147000	What if we did an Ouya that's handheld?
3147000	3149000	I mean, isn't that, that's what a lot of this stuff is.
3149000	3151000	An Ouya that's handheld is a tablet.
3151000	3153000	Well, what, okay.
3153000	3154000	With a Bluetooth controller.
3154000	3156000	Okay, what, isn't that kind of what this is?
3156000	3159000	I mean, it's not a tablet per se, but it might as well be.
3159000	3161000	No, this is, I think something else.
3161000	3165000	I think this is just, their whole thing is they're trying to go after PC gaming because,
3165000	3171000	I mean, they make money off of their chips, but I think they're gonna make more money off their graphics cards
3171000	3176000	and all the tech that goes into that because, I mean, it's them and ATI, that's it.
3176000	3181000	That's your choices for graphics cards and anything to edge out the competition to make people say,
3181000	3186000	hey, you know what, I should get this because it's got, and if you think about it,
3186000	3187000	Nvidia's kind of done stuff like that.
3187000	3193000	I mean, they have three displays and they have, you know, that built into it and the PhysX stuff
3193000	3200000	and also now the streaming thing and CUDA cores where you can, you know, run other things using that.
3200000	3204000	You know, PC applications that support those other cores.
3204000	3207000	I mean, that's kind of the direction they're going.
3207000	3212000	So I wouldn't exactly blame the Ouya for it because, I mean, they don't know how it's gonna do yet.
3212000	3218000	I mean, granted, you're seeing a lot more of these set top, I mean, the whole thing with CES was just like,
3218000	3225000	you know, it's tablets and Google TV and 4K TVs is basically the three big things.
3225000	3227000	But all people really want is an iPad.
3227000	3229000	I don't think so.
3229000	3231000	Are you sure?
3231000	3235000	Yeah. I mean, well, there's the Apple people that have to keep buying new things.
3235000	3237000	There's a lot of Apple people though.
3237000	3241000	There's a lot of people bought the Wii, but, you know, that doesn't mean that Nintendo's doing, you know,
3241000	3243000	really well with the next system.
3243000	3248000	A quick context jump, at least as far as the consumer is concerned.
3248000	3257000	A buddy of mine that has this dinosaur of a phone was blown away at the ability to take his Wii U game pad,
3257000	3260000	be in another room in the house and continue to browse the internet.
3260000	3262000	He doesn't have to pull out his laptop.
3262000	3264000	That too, really.
3264000	3267000	Kind of awkward for this anyways. Sorry.
3267000	3274000	But it was just, it was the most absurd thing for me to read is that, wow, I have four inches of the internet,
3274000	3279000	right smack dab in this little handheld controller and I don't even have to be in the same room as the TV is in.
3279000	3284000	And I did one of these things where I reached into my pocket and I pulled out my phone.
3284000	3287000	I was like, wow, I'm not confined to the house.
3287000	3290000	This is like five years in the future.
3290000	3295000	And it's just strange because it's also like a connectivity excuse.
3295000	3301000	If you can game anywhere, even on a screen that's that small, people will do it when they can.
3301000	3303000	And I think there's application for it.
3303000	3307000	It's not necessarily, it doesn't necessarily fit in best for us.
3307000	3312000	Maybe, maybe not as much as another person, but for these people that just have little setups,
3312000	3316000	it has enough of an application to survive in the market, I think.
3316000	3321000	Well, how do you win across the people, the elderly folks that like Wii Sports Bowling?
3321000	3324000	You show them the voodoo magic that is TV on a thing that's not the TV.
3324000	3328000	Holy crap, how did my TV get on this little piece of plastic?
3328000	3331000	It says black magic. I'm buying one.
3331000	3333000	And then they bowl it, drop it, and...
3333000	3334000	Are you a wizard?
3334000	3337000	Actually, in this case, it keeps working if they were to bowl that little controller.
3337000	3339000	Unless they like break off, snap off the screen.
3339000	3341000	No, no, I can't connect anymore.
3341000	3345000	I don't like this camera on this thing. I think it's going to steal my identity.
3345000	3347000	That's an old...
3347000	3348000	I could see that.
3348000	3350000	I've gotten that before.
3350000	3351000	Have you really?
3351000	3357000	Yeah, not camera specifically, but my name's on a website because I'm in a play.
3357000	3359000	Is there any problem with that?
3359000	3361000	That's why my mom won't join Facebook.
3361000	3363000	I asked my mom. I asked my mom.
3363000	3367000	My mom is on Twitter, and I'm not allowed to give out her Twitter handle or she will murder me.
3367000	3369000	But my mom has always said like...
3369000	3375000	And she's only on Twitter because she wants to follow Cher, Kathy Griffin, Barack Obama, and Rosie O'Donnell.
3375000	3376000	No Oprah?
3376000	3378000	Not yet. She probably just hasn't thought of that one.
3378000	3382000	But anyway, she follows like four people, and then me. She stalks me on Twitter.
3382000	3384000	But anyway, what was I really going to say?
3384000	3387000	Oh yes, my mom will not join Facebook, and her thing always is,
3387000	3391000	Rob, I don't need to join Facebook.
3391000	3394000	People have their identities stolen on Facebook, Rob.
3394000	3397000	And no one wants to see my face.
3397000	3399000	That's her line. No one wants to see my face.
3399000	3402000	My face isn't on Facebook. At least not my profile picture.
3402000	3403000	There you go.
3403000	3407000	People have their identities stolen because they gave their card to someone, which you do on a daily freaking basis.
3407000	3413000	People get their identities stolen from a waiter at a restaurant who is not somebody that the restaurant probably wants representing them.
3413000	3415000	But unfortunately shit happens.
3415000	3417000	So, you know, you just gotta be careful.
3417000	3420000	Alright, let's move on with some more news, shall we?
3420000	3426000	Talking about something else that was, you know, we didn't get a whole lot of gaming news out of CES this year.
3426000	3429000	But there was a couple things here and there.
3429000	3435000	And this was something that was gaining a lot of esteem, if you will, the talk at CES.
3435000	3437000	It's Valve Steam Box.
3437000	3441000	And it was confirmed by Gabe Newell that the Steam Box will run Linux.
3441000	3447000	The Steam Box, of course, is a little PC in a box that's basically designed to be hooked up to the computer.
3447000	3452000	It's basically out there to compete with the consoles, but it's a PC, it's Steam, and it will be Linux.
3452000	3455000	And this is the one from Valve.
3455000	3458000	From Valve. The official one from Valve.
3458000	3459000	Yes.
3460000	3464000	By the way, that box itself, not supposed to hit in 2013.
3464000	3466000	That kind of surprises me.
3466000	3469000	Why not strike now when all this stuff is a big hit?
3469000	3471000	I don't get what's so freaking difficult about this.
3471000	3473000	Like, what do they have planned for this?
3473000	3475000	I'm going back to an earlier prediction, by the way.
3475000	3478000	I am going back to an earlier prediction I had and I'm sticking by it.
3478000	3480000	Half-Life 3, when the Steam Box happens.
3480000	3481000	Probably.
3481000	3482000	Why not?
3482000	3486000	And people who have the Steam Box will get Half-Life 3 first.
3486000	3491000	And watch that thing just cut the Ouya off of the kneecaps. Watch. Watch.
3491000	3494000	There's a reason why it's not dropping this year.
3494000	3496000	Compatibility.
3496000	3499000	Oh, because of Linux compatibility. They're waiting for more of the games.
3499000	3501000	They need more developers to jump on.
3501000	3505000	That's why Steam Linux is coming to Linux systems first.
3505000	3507000	Because they need to have that library base.
3507000	3509000	They need it to be as successful as possible because when that thing drops,
3509000	3511000	Why can't I play Mass Effect on there?
3511000	3513000	Why can't I play World of Goo on there?
3513000	3516000	Why can't I play Toki, Tory, Limbo?
3516000	3517000	Anyways.
3517000	3521000	Well, how about a comment from Ben Krasnow, who is an electrical engineer with Valve.
3521000	3523000	Although I thought that's weird because I thought Valve people didn't have titles,
3523000	3527000	but maybe that's just what's on his resume if you looked at his LinkedIn or something.
3527000	3532000	Quote, With regards to the Steam Box news, there's been a lot of things stated in media which I didn't say.
3532000	3535000	For example, it's true that we are working on getting Steam into the living room
3535000	3537000	and are planning for a hardware box,
3537000	3540000	but we have no current plans to announce anything in 2013.
3540000	3543000	So the Linux thing may end up being something...
3543000	3546000	The thing to draw from this, we're hearing about the Linux thing now,
3546000	3548000	but that may actually end up not being the case.
3548000	3553000	Maybe it's running Linux now, but who knows what's going to happen.
3553000	3555000	Because it can't run Windows 8.
3555000	3557000	That would look really weird.
3557000	3559000	Well, it can't run Windows period.
3559000	3561000	It can't run Mac OS, so why wouldn't it run Linux?
3561000	3563000	Mac OS like iOS. Wow.
3563000	3566000	It could run a modified version of Linux.
3566000	3568000	Yeah, anything like...
3568000	3571000	They may put together the Steam OS.
3571000	3574000	The Steam OS, which is going to be a Linux kernel,
3574000	3578000	their own different base utilities, whatever they need to do.
3578000	3580000	Call it Linux, call it not.
3580000	3584000	Call it not Linux because it's proprietary.
3584000	3586000	I don't know. What a big surprise.
3586000	3589000	It's going to be based on the biggest open platform in the world.
3589000	3591000	Well, speaking of open platforms,
3591000	3594000	Gabe Newell apparently looking at the Steam Box
3594000	3596000	as being something, or Steam in general,
3596000	3600000	as being something that is a very user-generated paradise.
3600000	3603000	Maybe taking a cue from GitHub. Who knows?
3603000	3604000	Our view has always been...
3604000	3605000	Wow, nice leap.
3605000	3606000	Yeah, nice.
3606000	3608000	Our view has always been that we should build tools for customers
3608000	3609000	and tools for partners.
3609000	3611000	An editorial filter is fine,
3611000	3613000	but there should be a bunch of editorial filters.
3613000	3616000	The backend services should be network APIs that anybody can use.
3616000	3619000	On the consumer side, anybody should be able to put up a store
3619000	3621000	that hooks into those services.
3621000	3622000	Some people will create team stores.
3622000	3624000	Some people will create Sony stores.
3624000	3627000	Some people will create stores with only games that they think meet their quality bar.
3627000	3629000	Somebody is going to create a store that says,
3629000	3631000	these are the worst games on Steam.
3631000	3634000	So that's an example of where our thinking is leading us right now.
3634000	3635000	Very interesting.
3635000	3636000	Four letters.
3636000	3641000	H-T-T-P.
3641000	3643000	Because the web is something that...
3643000	3645000	Or what? What's the point you're making with that?
3645000	3649000	Because that's become the universal communication mechanism.
3649000	3652000	And let somebody do whatever the hell they want
3652000	3654000	and then interconnect it and host it
3654000	3657000	and make it available just by pointing to a different location
3657000	3662000	and boom, the freedom of the internet and the open platform and hoorah.
3662000	3663000	I don't want to be dismissive about it
3663000	3666000	because really it is the best thing to come to computing ever
3666000	3669000	besides computing existing in the first place.
3669000	3675000	But it's just an interesting thing they're banking on, I guess.
3675000	3677000	I don't know. I don't really have a way to summarize it.
3677000	3680000	It's just funny that Steam has come from store to meta store
3680000	3685000	and opening it all up, but there's still the linchpin holding it all together.
3685000	3687000	I don't know. I feel like I'm still missing one last detail
3687000	3690000	that makes this whole narrative of everything Steam is doing
3690000	3696000	over the next three years to make sense.
3696000	3699000	Do you think the Steam box is going to be too late?
3699000	3700000	Oh, hell no.
3700000	3703000	No, not even a little bit.
3703000	3706000	It's going to be a significant player, period.
3706000	3707000	That's all there is to say about it.
3707000	3710000	I don't think it really matters if it's too late.
3710000	3713000	Yeah, because there's other Half-Life 3s on it.
3713000	3718000	Well, I don't think they're really going to necessarily put Half-Life 3
3718000	3720000	exclusive to the Steam box or anything like that,
3720000	3724000	but I think that it may launch with it or something.
3724000	3728000	And there's other third-party manufacturers of this stuff,
3728000	3733000	so if you don't like the configuration of running Linux or anything like that,
3733000	3736000	that probably wouldn't be something I'd be interested in.
3736000	3740000	I don't know. I just don't really want to run Linux.
3740000	3742000	What about Linux Mint?
3742000	3745000	Could Jamie get her precious Linux Mint on a Steam box, you think?
3745000	3746000	Probably.
3746000	3749000	Why not? I can get Linux Mint on a USB drive.
3749000	3754000	If you can get Linux on a toaster, Rob, Mint will run on anything.
3754000	3755000	Here's what I would like to see.
3755000	3760000	I would like to see more apps coming to Steam big picture mode,
3760000	3764000	like, for example, Netflix and Hulu and that kind of stuff,
3764000	3766000	because right now that's the thing.
3766000	3770000	I wanted to build a PC that has this kind of cool interface
3770000	3772000	like the Xbox 360 and stuff,
3772000	3776000	and big picture mode definitely works for that stuff,
3776000	3779000	and I know there's workarounds that you can do.
3779000	3783000	You can trick it into getting external programs to run it,
3783000	3787000	but I'm talking about something that's actually in Steam big picture mode
3787000	3791000	without having to do some workarounds and stuff.
3791000	3795000	That would be pretty awesome, so that I can get all that stuff in there,
3795000	3797000	because that's really what I'm looking for,
3797000	3800000	is just watch TV stuff, play games,
3800000	3805000	run it on a PC because things will look better.
3805000	3808000	All right, let's move on with more news,
3808000	3811000	because there was news this week that had nothing to do with new fangled consoles
3811000	3813000	and new boxes and things,
3813000	3816000	but news about the good old consoles that are out now, right, Jamie?
3816000	3819000	Yeah, some Pokemans.
3819000	3822000	Pokemon.
3822000	3826000	So Nintendo announced that Pokemon X and Pokemon Y
3826000	3829000	are going to be on the Nintendo 3DS,
3829000	3832000	and they should be out later this October.
3832000	3835000	Why are we thinking that far ahead, man?
3835000	3839000	But it just makes me wonder if you get all chick Pokemon in one
3839000	3843000	and all dude Pokemon in the other, because they're XY.
3844000	3847000	Even if Pokemon had XY chromosomes, I'm just saying.
3847000	3852000	No, I think it has something to do with the way the final bosses are named or something.
3852000	3856000	Well, at any rate, they're actually saying that it's not a reboot,
3856000	3859000	it's just an evolution of the franchise,
3859000	3864000	and Game Freak has basically been working their ass off trying to get it out.
3864000	3869000	The quote is saying that there has never been a conscious decision to reboot.
3869000	3873000	There's always been an evolution of the look and feel.
3873000	3875000	No one gives a shit.
3875000	3877000	So their Pikachu has evolved into a Raichu.
3877000	3881000	Yeah, their Pikachu is like a Pikachuer.
3881000	3884000	Their Wubachu has evolved into a Dubstepachu.
3884000	3888000	That's never going to get old.
3888000	3892000	Never ever.
3892000	3896000	And that's the sound that Pokemon still make in the games today, by the way.
3896000	3900000	They never learned how to say their names like they did in the cartoon,
3900000	3905000	but you go like, you know, Ho Monkey, I choose you, and it goes...
3905000	3910000	The best thing that the newer Pokemon games have ever given is,
3910000	3913000	X, use the Pester Ball. It's super effective.
3913000	3917000	It's super effective.
3917000	3919000	Are you excited about Pokemon X and Y?
3919000	3920000	No.
3920000	3921000	Will you give it another chance?
3921000	3922000	No.
3922000	3927000	I saw the little trailer video, and first things first about the trailer video.
3927000	3930000	Fennekin, totally adorable.
3930000	3931000	Have you seen Fennekin?
3931000	3932000	No.
3932000	3933000	Let me put it this way.
3933000	3936000	DeviantArt, like, jizzed in their pants.
3936000	3938000	DeviantArt pisses me off.
3938000	3939000	Why does DeviantArt piss you off?
3939000	3940000	Besides the royalty thing.
3940000	3941000	Okay.
3941000	3942000	I'm talking the community.
3942000	3944000	Don't bring up that crap about the royalties.
3944000	3945000	I don't care about that.
3945000	3946000	The community and all that.
3946000	3947000	Tumblr blew up.
3947000	3948000	The royalty thing is...
3948000	3949000	Oh God.
3949000	3953000	No, and actually, there are a lot of people who get their panties in a wad on DeviantArt these days,
3953000	3957000	so I'm just completely kind of done, even though I did post something on there.
3960000	3961000	Done.
3961000	3964000	So, wait a minute. You're done with DeviantArt, but you just posted there the other day?
3964000	3966000	Yeah, because I actually use...
3966000	3970000	I pay for my DeviantArt account to host my portfolio.
3972000	3973000	I guess that's fair.
3973000	3974000	All right, look, look.
3974000	3978000	I got to show you this in the little trailer, although I'm sure I'm going to get hit with an ad here,
3978000	3984000	but I got to show you in this trailer the Fennekin, because Fennekin's super adorable.
3984000	3988000	And finally, the game looks different.
3988000	3994000	It's not that same sprite-based thing we've seen since the original freaking games.
3994000	3998000	It is like what you would expect to see on a 3DS.
4000000	4002000	And Pikachu's still in it.
4002000	4004000	Pikachu!
4006000	4013000	Okay, so, you know, it's like, yay, we're going to take over the world one little pocket monster at a time.
4014000	4020000	But see, now it's actually like what a game from this year should look like, right?
4020000	4023000	Okay, now that actually does look kind of fun, except I don't have a 3DS.
4024000	4025000	And...
4025000	4028000	However, the Pok√©mon all look retarded.
4028000	4031000	Okay, that's Chespin. He looks cute, right?
4031000	4032000	No.
4034000	4039000	And look at the battles! The battles look like a freaking Dragon Quest game, or something.
4039000	4041000	How adorable is Fennekin?
4041000	4043000	Okay, Fennekin is cute.
4043000	4045000	See? See? He's like that's sassy.
4045000	4047000	But only because it looks like Eevee.
4047000	4049000	Who put a fire fox in this game?
4052000	4054000	Oh, he's so cute.
4054000	4056000	And then that is, I don't know, Froakie.
4056000	4058000	That looks disgusting.
4058000	4060000	What's that shit on its nose?
4060000	4062000	Are those glasses?
4062000	4064000	No, it's big snot bubbles.
4064000	4068000	That's what it is, he's blowing snot on whatever that raccoon thing is.
4073000	4074000	And then Psyduck.
4074000	4077000	Psyduck is like the big joke of the series.
4079000	4081000	No, that's Psyduck.
4081000	4083000	Psy.
4083000	4087000	So, tell me, here's the little, like, uber Pok√©mon at the end, or whatever.
4089000	4091000	Is his name Boner?
4091000	4093000	Ryze giving me the commentary.
4093000	4095000	No, Rob, that one's Y.
4095000	4096000	That one's X.
4096000	4098000	You studied this trailer, you did your homework, right?
4098000	4101000	And the secret one is Boner.
4101000	4104000	I actually haven't, just saw somebody post it on my Facebook.
4104000	4106000	What's up with that peacock deer? That was really weird.
4108000	4110000	I will probably give these...
4110000	4112000	So doesn't that, like, didn't that...
4112000	4116000	Like, yeah, you go, okay, new Pok√©mon game, yeah, whoopty shit, I've seen this before.
4116000	4119000	But then you look at that trailer and you go, they finally fuckin' changed it.
4119000	4122000	I can do this, this looks good.
4122000	4124000	I will give this game a shot again.
4124000	4126000	Welcome to 2013, Nintendo.
4126000	4129000	The same argument I made for Diamond and Pearl for the DS, I think the 3DS.
4129000	4134000	And I hope Nintendo's giving a shit about online and modern technology
4134000	4137000	and the things that they're actually continuing to build into their new systems.
4137000	4138000	I'll give this a shot.
4138000	4140000	Does that mean you'll play it for two hours this time?
4140000	4141000	No, two and a half.
4141000	4142000	Two and a half.
4142000	4143000	Okay.
4143000	4144000	It's an improvement, dammit.
4144000	4147000	ActDeft in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
4147000	4151000	dares to challenge Jamie, saying Magikarp is the big joke of the series.
4151000	4152000	Magikarp is...
4152000	4153000	What I said.
4153000	4156000	Psyduck was more the joke in the cartoons.
4156000	4160000	That's what, whatever, I don't care, it's Pok√©mon.
4161000	4164000	GameGuru, bringing logic into this argument, saying,
4164000	4169000	well, Pok√©mon had to update to polygons to support 3D, so they couldn't use sprites anymore.
4169000	4172000	GameGuru, you haven't played those NES classics.
4172000	4173000	They'll...
4173000	4177000	Where they just put the different, like, sprite layers on different 3D planes.
4177000	4180000	Like, they could have done cheap-ass 3D if they wanted to.
4180000	4182000	But I'm glad they didn't.
4182000	4183000	They're finally doing the right thing.
4183000	4185000	All right, let's move on with more news.
4185000	4186000	Loki.
4186000	4193000	All right, so there is a neat little piece of technology that they showed off at...
4194000	4199000	I don't know if it was at CES, or it was just something that they showed off during CES,
4199000	4207000	but it is this brand-new thing called the Microsoft IllumiRoom.
4207000	4211000	And what the IllumiRoom demo was is basically this...
4211000	4220000	Kind of a combination of a projector and Kinect built in so that it senses the geometry of your room
4220000	4223000	and then extends your gameplay field beyond the TV.
4223000	4227000	And it could be supplemental stuff like, you know, they'll have...
4227000	4229000	You'll be racing in a game or something like that,
4229000	4233000	and the lighting effects from, like, cars driving by at night or something like that
4233000	4236000	cast shadows on stuff that's in your room.
4236000	4239000	Or, you know, snow when you're walking through snow.
4239000	4244000	Or, you know, even, like, geometry for first-person shooters and that kind of thing.
4244000	4249000	Now, what's interesting about this is this is something we talked about before.
4249000	4253000	Not necessarily the IllumiRoom thing, but the kind of loss of hinting at it.
4253000	4260000	Like, for example, there's the whole patent back in September that, you know, kind of showed us this thing anyways,
4260000	4266000	saying that, you know, they have a patent to use, I guess, some sort of 3D glasses with this
4266000	4271000	and even maybe, you know, the Kinect and stuff like that.
4271000	4274000	I don't think necessarily that this is going to work with the Kinect
4274000	4277000	because the way the projector works on this...
4277000	4284000	And this is similar to what they had in their Microsoft Home of the Future display,
4284000	4286000	which I think is on their campus.
4286000	4288000	And this is what I've kind of alluded to before,
4288000	4292000	where they showed off these different displays that are built into...
4292000	4296000	Not necessarily built into the walls, but they are projected onto the walls.
4296000	4303000	So they have, like, for example, this, like, kids' room that will have this...
4303000	4307000	Fictional teenage girls, you know, favorite bands.
4307000	4309000	You know, the posters on the wall are all dynamic.
4309000	4311000	You know, it's showing her bands and stuff.
4311000	4315000	And then, like, say, oh, Grandma's coming over today and they're going to stay in your room.
4315000	4320000	And then the whole motif just changes completely to, you know, whoever's using it.
4320000	4325000	Like, they have a window that shows, you know, her dog at home on a security camera or something like that.
4325000	4327000	So, basically, in this...
4327000	4334000	And they also have some projects that they've done with augmentive projectors,
4334000	4338000	where you can actually use your shadows to control stuff like Kinect,
4338000	4342000	where, you know, you have, you know, particles that you're moving your hand
4342000	4346000	and your shadow's, like, picking them up and you can actually pick stuff up with your fingers,
4346000	4347000	which is kind of neat.
4347000	4349000	So I see that kind of stuff happening.
4349000	4353000	Now, whether is this going to be included in the next Xbox?
4353000	4356000	I think, if anything, this will be an accessory for the next Xbox.
4356000	4362000	I don't think this is something that they can just throw in there because the setup is quite extensive.
4362000	4370000	I mean, you're going to need the system, your TV, and you're going to mount a projector to your ceiling somehow,
4370000	4372000	or multiple projectors.
4372000	4375000	So it'll be a little interesting how they do that.
4375000	4379000	But pretty cool tech demo that they show there.
4379000	4382000	Pretty cool and pretty non-existent in the end.
4382000	4385000	Yeah, it's one of those things where I'm like, is this snake oil?
4385000	4389000	Like, the video is pretty impressive, the video that's floating around out there.
4389000	4391000	Yeah, well, it's a neat concept.
4391000	4396000	It's not, I mean, I wouldn't say it's snake oil, but they have, you know, a working prototype,
4396000	4400000	like, even if they show this, you know, Home of the Future type thing, this Microsoft thing.
4400000	4403000	Well, what about, I don't live in the Home of the Future, Loki.
4403000	4407000	They have a working prototype in a 100% Taylor setup.
4407000	4409000	I live in the Home of the Poor People Past.
4409000	4414000	I'm wondering, though, I'm wondering just basically how much this would cost,
4414000	4416000	because projectors aren't cheap.
4416000	4421000	And so, I mean, this would be cool technology if this is something that they launch with the system,
4421000	4423000	that you're immersed in your whole room.
4423000	4424000	I mean, that would be pretty cool.
4424000	4426000	Projectors can come at all sorts of levels.
4426000	4428000	Like, yes, a high quality projector isn't cheap,
4428000	4433000	but you can get a little thing that projects shadow puppets on the wall for your kids when they sleep for 20 bucks.
4433000	4437000	So, I mean, what is the level of projection technology in this thing?
4437000	4438000	It's somewhere in the middle, probably.
4438000	4441000	But I don't think it's going to be built into the next Xbox. I'm with you.
4441000	4442000	I think it's some type of accessory.
4442000	4449000	Well, they were even talking about, like, the tracking and stuff, better 3D modeling and capture and stuff.
4449000	4454000	Like, one of the things they said with the Kinect that they were going to change is that they're going to have,
4454000	4461000	instead of having that IR field just in one spot, it's going to sweep the room,
4461000	4465000	so that you get a better idea of the geometry of the room, which is kind of cool.
4465000	4470000	And this is one of their other projects, their Kinect Track project, that they were going to...
4470000	4474000	They said the six degrees of freedom, or a six DOF tracker,
4474000	4481000	which allows real-time, low-cost pose estimation using our only commodity hardware.
4481000	4487000	And, I don't know, it sounds interesting, but we'll see how they implement this.
4487000	4491000	I mean, like I said, it looked pretty exciting, that whole, like, Home of the Future thing and how they have...
4491000	4497000	Because a lot of it was that they have some other technology that they call, like, Lightbox or something like that.
4497000	4503000	Basically, a lot of these displays that are projected from, you know, the ceiling and stuff like that.
4503000	4505000	So, like, oh, I'm going to put this thing on the charger,
4505000	4509000	and you see, like, a little HUD kind of appear next to whatever your device is,
4509000	4513000	giving you information and the texture, you know, touching the surfaces and stuff.
4513000	4520000	It's basically putting the display for your computer on any object or wall or whatever.
4520000	4525000	So, it could be cool, and that would be also kind of neat if you think about it.
4525000	4530000	Like, imagine, you know, playing, like, Forza or something like that,
4530000	4535000	and then you have all, you know, you could have maps and all sorts of HUD equipment, you know, outside of the TV.
4535000	4539000	But that time, though, if you're going to have all that stuff outside of the screen,
4539000	4543000	you might as well just use the projector as your display in the first place.
4543000	4546000	Raginator in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com asks,
4547000	4550000	Now the question is, how many steps away from Star Trek's holodeck is this projector?
4550000	4554000	We're getting closer. Now it's making the whole room show imagery. It's closer.
4554000	4557000	They have technology that's in another one of their videos,
4557000	4561000	because they have this whole research thing that they do a bunch of, like, future tech stuff.
4561000	4568000	They have a 3D display that is pretty interesting. It can be viewed from 360 degrees.
4568000	4572000	So, you can't touch it yet, but we're getting there.
4572000	4573000	We're getting there.
4573000	4574000	We're getting there.
4575000	4582000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, swim.
4582000	4589000	Alright, well, moving on for time issues. This sounds awesome. I'm looking forward to more information on it.
4589000	4596000	I hope it's something that actually works, because the concept sounds great and could really enhance gaming.
4596000	4601000	Moving on, though, you know, a story that we've really kept an eye on,
4601000	4606000	and everybody has in the game industry this week, is the fallout from the tragedy last month in Connecticut.
4606000	4611000	And I'm sure you guys all heard in the news about the gaming companies that were actually meeting with Joe Biden this week.
4611000	4615000	There was even some controversy around that. Should they even be meeting with Joe Biden?
4615000	4618000	Because is meeting with him admitting that they are part of the problem?
4618000	4623000	Well, here's the reality, guys. I mean, no matter where you stand on that issue,
4623000	4629000	a survey company named Survey USA actually polled a bunch of parents.
4629000	4636000	I don't know exactly what the qualifications were for this survey, but I guess it was all 50 states in the US, January 4th and 5th,
4636000	4641000	just over 1,000 parents who have children under the age of 18 living at home.
4641000	4647000	89% of parents believe that violence in today's video games is a problem.
4647000	4654000	75% believe that violence in video games contributes to violent behavior. 75%.
4655000	4662000	3 out of 4. That is a line that transcends Democrat and Republican, and any of that.
4662000	4672000	That is a vast majority. That's the reality. 75% of parents believe that violence in video games contributes to violent behavior.
4672000	4680000	Now, what I would be curious to know is, does that mean that they take an active role in what their kids should and should not play?
4680000	4683000	I wonder if the survey went to that.
4683000	4692000	Well, here's an example, and I know way too many. I'm not saying that any parent in this room does this,
4692000	4695000	because I know you probably don't, really.
4695000	4704000	There are some people who I know who have kids who really just let their kids sit unregulated and watch whatever they want to
4704000	4708000	and play whatever they want to, and aren't even in the same room when they're playing a game.
4709000	4720000	And of course, I don't think that it's a matter necessarily of the game or the show that's being influenced.
4720000	4725000	It's a matter of neglect being the influence, because the kid's going to act out when they're not getting the attention they need.
4725000	4730000	Let me run down some of the other stats, because Jamie, I'm really curious what you think about some of this.
4730000	4739000	93% of parents, damn near all parents, nationwide say lack of supervision for children contributes to violence.
4739000	4740000	Agreed.
4740000	4745000	92% of parents nationwide say bullying contributes to violence.
4745000	4746000	Very much agreed.
4746000	4752000	86% of parents nationwide say crime in day-to-day life contributes.
4752000	4754000	That depends.
4754000	4760000	See, yes, because the news shows it is where I'm going with that.
4760000	4765000	See, my point is that it's media is the contributor.
4765000	4770000	How many people think that that horrible gunman, and I won't say his name,
4770000	4777000	how many people think that that horrible gunman did what he did so that he could go out with all the publicity?
4777000	4783000	Because if he wanted to end it all, he could have done it in a different way.
4783000	4786000	But he did it in a way that was meant to get attention.
4786000	4791000	I think he did it because his mother works there.
4791000	4799000	I mean, I can't clearly put myself in that kind of mindset because I'm not a psychopath or sociopath,
4799000	4807000	but he went to the school that his mother taught at and shot her students and then her.
4807000	4810000	So that seems more of a big revenge thing.
4810000	4812000	Just because I want to spare you the males.
4812000	4816000	Technically, the mother was killed, then he went to the school.
4816000	4821000	Okay. But I think it's related.
4821000	4827000	It's like, oh, she's gone, let's fuck up everything that meant something to her, and then we're done.
4827000	4829000	I don't want to talk about him anymore.
4829000	4833000	But my point is I don't know how much of the media might have had something to do with that,
4833000	4836000	other than it gave it to him as an option.
4836000	4841000	77% of parents nationwide say violence in TV and movies contributes.
4841000	4845000	So, interesting enough, I mean, to be fair, as much as we're sitting here going,
4845000	4852000	oh my gosh, 75%, that is 2% lower than the number of parents who say TV and movies contributes.
4852000	4857000	So, at least everybody's getting blamed equally, I guess.
4857000	4862000	64% say violent toys contribute.
4862000	4865000	Here's what surprised me.
4865000	4870000	75%, we already established, believe that violence in video games contributes.
4870000	4874000	Guess what got the exact same percentage?
4874000	4881000	Also at 75%, exact same, easy access to guns contributes to violence.
4881000	4883000	Yeah.
4883000	4887000	But on the exact same level as video games?
4887000	4893000	Well, again, video games are the scapegoat.
4893000	4902000	We have tons of research, psychiatric data, and statistics that show video games are not the responsible thing.
4902000	4907000	I think when you put a combination of preexisting mental conditions,
4907000	4915000	when you throw in easy access to weaponry, and when you throw in a few other external factors,
4915000	4920000	like, for example, the guy here in California who was bullied,
4920000	4928000	and he shot one of his bullies and got talked out of it, that's definitely a contributing factor.
4928000	4932000	I need to get this out there because the chat room is lighting up on this.
4932000	4935000	And again, we don't want the podcast listeners sitting there going,
4935000	4937000	I'm going to write an email because they're wrong.
4937000	4943000	Folks in chat all over the place saying that it was not, she didn't work at the school.
4943000	4946000	The media reported that, but the media fucked up a lot of the information at first.
4946000	4948000	Okay, fine.
4948000	4952000	But I think there was some type of connection between him and the school,
4952000	4954000	whether it was that he went there or something, I don't know.
4954000	4956000	But anyway, you know.
4956000	4963000	Regardless, I think that maybe you might not have gotten the idea if it hadn't been something so publicized, you know.
4963000	4969000	He's sick. We can all agree on that. Very, very, very sick.
4969000	4974000	Apparently, those surveyed were shown a video for Hitman Absolution.
4974000	4980000	84% said that advertisement was inappropriate to show on TV at a time when children are watching.
4980000	4986000	Well, I'd actually kind of agree with that. You don't show a commercial like that during, you know, the Smurfs.
4986000	4991000	Not shown during the time when they were watching TV.
4991000	4995000	Yeah, that's true. That's right. They're not shown.
4995000	4996000	Once again, though.
4996000	5002000	Unless parents let their kids watch South Park unattended, which is an M-rated show.
5002000	5010000	Once again, though, I think, though, that a lot of this is just you're asking someone's opinion on this doesn't mean that they're right.
5010000	5013000	And doesn't mean they're educated on that stuff, too.
5013000	5021000	I mean, you know, they're all, I think, violence. I think violence in video games, you know, is what's causing these people to be violent or whatever.
5021000	5031000	Well, you can think that. Just like you can think that, you know, because this person doesn't believe in a certain, you know, godly entity that they're violent.
5031000	5038000	Or, you know, because this person is a homosexual, they're violent. Or because this person is a certain race, they're violent.
5038000	5043000	You know, you can think all these things, but it doesn't necessarily mean that any of this is correct.
5043000	5055000	So, I mean, I don't know. I just, once again, we're just probably going to see more legislature with, you know, video games because everyone's believing now that video games are violent because the media told them.
5055000	5063000	And oddly enough, you know, they question all this other stuff, but they don't question media, which makes no sense whatsoever. But fine.
5063000	5067000	Let me close with this comment, and then I want to move on from SSJ100, Matt.
5067000	5079000	People look for answers to understand tragedy. They want a finger to point at because the fact of the matter is people are terrified of the fact that people could do something so horrible for no reason than just because.
5079000	5082000	I guess it's scapegoat.
5082000	5090000	Uh, one other story as a follow-up to this. And, you know, when this all first happened, I said, watch out because an angry mob is coming.
5090000	5092000	Guess what happened this week?
5092000	5103000	Massachusetts, the state, pulled video games out of state-operated rest stops. Not all video games, but light gun games.
5103000	5108000	Time crisis. Removed. Lethal enforcers. Gone.
5108000	5110000	House of the Dead.
5110000	5113000	I don't know if anybody had House of the Dead in the first place.
5113000	5115000	But Lethal Enforcers first, really?
5115000	5120000	Time crisis and Beachhead 2000 was another one. Beachhead 2000.
5120000	5122000	That's not a light gun game.
5122000	5129000	What a pretentious fucking game Beachhead 2000 was in many ways. Let's be real. But still, apparently...
5129000	5131000	Too hot for Massachusetts.
5131000	5133000	Which version of Beachhead 2000?
5133000	5134000	The one with that giant helmet.
5134000	5139000	Remember they also had the one where, at Golf Land, they had the one where you can actually sit inside the thing that's moving around?
5139000	5141000	Oh, the Sudoji or whatever that thing was called? The Sumo.
5141000	5143000	Sumo. Sumo. That was it.
5143000	5145000	Yeah. Was it the Sumo version?
5145000	5147000	Nah, I doubt it. I doubt it.
5147000	5152000	Fine. You know what? Yeah. Cool. That's your prerogative. You can do whatever the hell you want.
5152000	5156000	Because, you know what? It's your arcade. You can make those decisions.
5156000	5161000	I don't even know why it was a news story. Other than, oh, this happened, so let's make it into a story.
5161000	5172000	But, like, seriously, if you don't like fighting games, if people are bullying each other and you take fighting games out of your arcade, that's your own choice.
5172000	5176000	Did they replace it with non-violent ticket games? Because I'd like to know if that actually happened.
5176000	5185000	The games that remained. Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, and Cruis'n Exotica at one point. Like, Cruis'n World. It's not a porn game. It's like the Cruis'n race games. Remember that?
5185000	5192000	Cruis'n Exotica. I mean, that's very violent. Can't you hit things? I mean, remember, Cruis'n USA, you can, like, explode here.
5192000	5196000	And you can drive a school bus irresponsibly.
5196000	5202000	Can drive over 100 miles an hour, which doesn't happen in the States, except on race tracks.
5203000	5208000	Richard Davey, the State Secretary of Transportation in Massachusetts. Here's a quote.
5208000	5216000	Bottom line is, I think there isn't a person who doesn't believe that there isn't too much violence in our society, and games can glorify that.
5216000	5221000	A video game in a public space could be used by anybody of any age.
5221000	5230000	I think there isn't a person who doesn't believe that there isn't too much violence in our society, and games can glorify that.
5230000	5234000	There is not one person who disagrees, apparently.
5234000	5239000	My brain can't parse the first half of that sentence. It's like a triple negative to make the point.
5239000	5241000	Listen to this quote carefully one more time. Third time's the charm.
5241000	5251000	Bottom line is, I think there isn't a person who doesn't believe that there isn't too much violence in our society, and games can glorify that.
5251000	5253000	It's a positive, because it's pretty negative.
5254000	5263000	A person does not exist who doesn't believe that there isn't too much violence.
5263000	5271000	So, I think it should be that, and he doesn't think that those people don't exist.
5271000	5280000	So, if I were going to rephrase that, I think what he intends is, I think most people believe there's too much violence in our society.
5280000	5282000	Wouldn't that have been easier?
5283000	5285000	By the way, I don't think there's enough violence.
5285000	5289000	He would have learned better grammar if he, you know, wasn't playing those violent video games.
5289000	5291000	They're the blame.
5291000	5294000	Not playing violent video games leads to bad grammar.
5294000	5299000	I want to make the most bloody grammar game ever. That'd be awesome.
5299000	5303000	I don't know. Bloody...
5303000	5306000	I can't think of a...
5306000	5308000	Hunt Peck Mame, the game.
5309000	5316000	According to Jason in our chatroom, Jason, you're talking in our chatroom, apparently that quote was, quote-ception.
5319000	5323000	Negative-ception. I have no idea. It just hurt my head to try to deal with.
5326000	5331000	There isn't a person who doesn't believe that there isn't too much violence.
5331000	5333000	We get it! We get it!
5339000	5342000	Alright, let's move on. More news.
5342000	5345000	Dark Sakura, one more story and then the release dates.
5345000	5347000	DONG!
5347000	5353000	UK University is trying to use the Kinect to see if it will help stroke victims.
5354000	5359000	I couldn't res- I'll put it away. I'll put it away. I will put it away.
5359000	5363000	I'm gonna take that gong and shove it so far up your ass.
5363000	5366000	I don't know, this is kind of payback for all the vuvuzelas up there.
5366000	5369000	That is true. She was pretty terrible with that, wasn't she?
5369000	5373000	I'm gonna shove that gong so far up your ass that you burp brass.
5373000	5376000	Technically, I don't think it's a gong. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
5376000	5380000	So you're gonna put brass in my ass to give me brassy gas?
5381000	5384000	Alright, seriously, read the fucking story. I'm gonna walk away.
5384000	5387000	I would much rather have dubstep bird.
5389000	5391000	Can we remix those together?
5393000	5395000	You have to add a reverb in it to make it go-
5395000	5399000	They need to have a bird that does the Inception sound.
5399000	5407000	If you think about it, if you think about it, it probably exists on the internet somewhere.
5407000	5408000	Inception bird?
5408000	5411000	No, dubstep Inception HD here.
5423000	5425000	That actually hurts.
5425000	5430000	And I'm not meaning that in an exaggerating kind of way, it actually hurts.
5430000	5432000	Alright, just please read the story.
5432000	5448000	Nottingham Trent University has been awarded a 347,000 pound grant to build a prototype that will use Kinect for feedback to patients and to their doctors.
5448000	5457000	These are for stroke victims. They're wanting to use the system to detect and track asymmetries on the patient's face.
5457000	5462000	That means mouth, eyes, cheeks, like for facial exercises.
5462000	5469000	I think it's for people who end up with ticks after strokes or being paralyzed.
5470000	5490000	And this is actually being headed, looks like, by Dr. Philip Breeden, who is basically saying that the system is going to use those exercises and see how successful they are with that feedback provided by the Kinect system.
5490000	5492000	So, pretty good.
5493000	5503000	I'm glad to hear a story about gaming things and things that were done for gaming doing good after those past couple stories we had.
5503000	5507000	Agreed. And I mean, you really have to think about it.
5508000	5514000	Like, for example, they had all those PlayStations put together to calculate, you know, cures.
5514000	5523000	They had, you know, now this technology with Kinect, they've got lots of cognitive therapy exercises that are being done with video games.
5523000	5530000	And I think that there's too much negative focus being put on a lot of.
5530000	5534000	They need to have more stuff like this go out in public. People go,
5534000	5536000	Wouldn't that be nice?
5536000	5540000	But people are looking for their scapegoat and they don't want to see anything good come out of it, so fuck them.
5540000	5542000	Quick side story about the Kinect.
5542000	5551000	Went to a New Year's party. Couple friends of mine that have a little band, little two-piece keyboard chiptune off of Game Boy and live drum segments.
5551000	5555000	A pretty good show. Just a tiny little house party for New Year's.
5555000	5565000	And one of their friends created this very quick little visualization demo that uses the Kinect to, you know, it uses the 3D, the point field,
5565000	5570000	all of the features of the Kinect to create this reactive visualization.
5570000	5578000	He implemented the ability to take the object and manipulate it in 3D space as far as the output is concerned.
5578000	5587000	And then obviously you have control of the Kinect's tilt and how much of the space it actually, it will actually display.
5588000	5595000	For all of the grief that I've given Kinect, as far as what it's capable of doing and representing, it's actually really good.
5595000	5603000	This kind of thing, I wouldn't think that it'd be applicable to the granularity of a face, but from the right distance, why not?
5603000	5609000	I really enjoy hearing about these applications that are practical and promising at the same time.
5609000	5618000	Well, we've heard about Kinect being used by doctors. I mean, maybe not like hooked up to an Xbox or anything, but like, you know, that technology in PCs, you know, pretty awesome.
5618000	5626000	All right, let's move on. Travel around the world and check out maybe some more affordable video games coming to a store near you. We'll start in the U.S., Loki.
5626000	5630000	This week is Devil May Cry on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
5630000	5631000	Woo!
5631000	5632000	That's it.
5632000	5634000	First big release of the New Year, though, right?
5634000	5636000	Hey, Anarchy Reigns came out last week.
5636000	5639000	Oh, yeah, I forgot about that. That's right, that's right. Shame on me.
5639000	5641000	I've been told I need to play that.
5641000	5644000	The game with potentially Bayonetta if you bought it from GameStop.
5644000	5645000	Really?
5645000	5647000	Yeah, only from GameStop.
5647000	5648000	Oh, how nice.
5648000	5654000	Thank you, Sega! Fuck you and your goddamn GameStop shit. You're going the route of Nintendo now.
5654000	5660000	All right, let's go to the Xbox 360 releases in Japan.
5661000	5666000	Japan also gets Devil May Cry this week, kind of one of those rare multi-regions in the same week.
5666000	5672000	Also, a game called Heavy Fire Shattered Spear makes its way to Japan this week. Both those games out on the 17th.
5672000	5676000	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, of course, as you can expect, Devil May Cry is out there as well.
5676000	5687000	Dream Seat Club Zero, special... it's not edition, they have EDP on or something. They do a little stylization, I think, when that comes out this week on the PS3.
5687000	5693000	Blade Storm, the Hundred Years War gets a price reduction. Little Big Planet Karting hadn't come out in Japan until now.
5693000	5697000	It's finally coming out this week. With that comes the Move Racing Wheel.
5697000	5703000	And some games moving into the best series, including Sengoku Musou 3, Empires.
5703000	5706000	Because, you know, they love their Dynasty Warriors.
5706000	5715000	On the Vita this week, WRC 3, Fia World Rally Championship is the lone release this week on the PlayStation Vita.
5715000	5723000	On the Wii U, nothing until January 31st. It's pretty dry over there with new releases, just like it is here.
5723000	5730000	Nothing on the 3DS either, so Nintendo's really slowed down this time of year, but same story over here, I guess.
5730000	5732000	How about the UK, Dark Sakura?
5732000	5735000	Well, I would tell you if the site was actually loading.
5735000	5737000	Oh, wow.
5737000	5740000	Come on, you butt-head.
5740000	5743000	Yes, I said butt-head. I called a website a butt-head.
5743000	5745000	I think I got it here. What's this?
5745000	5747000	No, no, no, it loaded.
5747000	5752000	On the 15th we have Devil May Cry on the 16th Retro City Rampage.
5752000	5756000	And, yeah, that's it.
5756000	5762000	Slim pickins no matter where you live, but it's gonna take a month for things to really ramp up again.
5762000	5765000	Devil May Cry is still a pretty big deal, so there you go.
5765000	5770000	Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys in the Classic Game of the Week. Loki.
5770000	5776000	So, indie game developers are saying positive things about the Wii U eShop
5776000	5780000	as opposed to what they were saying with the WiiWare service.
5780000	5786000	Apparently, Gaijin Games, Mike Rouse and Alex Neuse were saying that
5786000	5791000	we don't know for sure, but it felt like it wasn't taken seriously by Nintendo.
5791000	5795000	The desire for gamers to buy stuff digitally, and they're talking about, of course, the WiiWare service.
5795000	5802000	However, they're saying literally everything was easier this time around on the eShop.
5802000	5810000	What's more friendly right out of the starting gate is the Wii U is developed for people to have an eShop
5810000	5813000	to spend their money in and buy games easily.
5813000	5819000	So, I don't know. I mean, cool that they're doing some more stuff.
5819000	5823000	I mean, I don't know how this compares to, say, other platforms,
5823000	5826000	but at least they're doing better than they were before.
5826000	5833000	I mean, that's like, I don't know, maybe going to the dollar store instead of Kmart.
5833000	5838000	I mean, I don't know if that's, you know, oh, well, it's not as crappy as Kmart,
5838000	5843000	but it's still pretty crappy, but it's not as crappy.
5843000	5847000	So, I don't know how it really compares.
5847000	5851000	I'm still encouraged by some of these early things I'm hearing about the Wii U eShop
5851000	5853000	and that maybe we're going to see some really cool things on it.
5853000	5856000	I don't know. Do these indie developers get some preview codes
5856000	5860000	so they can get them sent out for reviews, unlike the Xbox indie games?
5860000	5865000	Maybe. I don't know. I don't get those types of reviews, so I don't know.
5865000	5869000	But I can tell you, I'm looking forward to the Zen pinballs coming out on the Wii U,
5869000	5872000	and that looks to be really cool, because they've got a Plants vs. Zombies table.
5872000	5874000	That would be neat.
5874000	5877000	Anyhow, speaking of Nintendo, one of the big stories from last year
5877000	5881000	was that Nintendo Power shut down after all these years.
5881000	5886000	Well, the spirit of sorts lives on with Nintendo Force Magazine.
5886000	5891000	It is a new product from a group of Nintendo-focused journalists and artists.
5891000	5894000	Don't read into that that it was like the old Nintendo Power team,
5894000	5895000	because that's not the case.
5895000	5899000	It's other types of journalists and fans from around the Internet.
5899000	5902000	They have released Nintendo Force Magazine.
5902000	5906000	Here's the thing, though. It's not your typical magazine.
5906000	5914000	It is one that you can get in PDF form for $5, or you can get a collectible print for $18.
5914000	5918000	I'm assuming, I'm left to assume, maybe Dark Soccer knows more about this stuff than I do,
5918000	5922000	but I'm left to assume that probably because there isn't a huge demand for this,
5922000	5926000	like it's not an international magazine or whatever, it's something that's more homegrown,
5926000	5931000	to kind of print these in a much smaller supply probably costs a little more money,
5931000	5936000	and that's why it's going to cost you $18 to get an actual printed copy version of this.
5936000	5941000	In the first issue, though, Fire Emblem Awakening and Mutant Mudds Deluxe,
5941000	5944000	which is apparently a thing on 3DS or Wii U coming soon.
5944000	5946000	So there you go.
5946000	5950000	All right, let's travel to a simpler time in games.
5950000	5954000	Let's go back to a time when, like, Nintendo Power was still around.
5954000	5959000	It's the classic game of the week where Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault,
5959000	5965000	and she's going to find a game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful brats, put down your Wii Us.
5965000	5967000	And mow my lawn.
5967000	5969000	Mow my lawn, and then maybe I'll let you play this game.
5969000	5971000	Maybe you'll go get a phosphate.
5971000	5976000	This game isn't super old, but believe it or not, it's getting old.
5976000	5978000	Yeah, that's why I picked it.
5978000	5980000	What is the classic game of the week, Dark Cyra?
5980000	5982000	Silent Hill 3.
5982000	5986000	Because I've done Silent Hill 2, but I haven't done my favorite, so now I'm doing my favorite.
5987000	5992000	Um, yeah, I picked the perfect thing to start off with, didn't I?
5992000	5994000	At least it wasn't bong.
5994000	5998000	At any rate, Silent Hill 3 was done by Konami.
5998000	6000000	We all know this.
6000000	6002000	Developed by Team Silent.
6002000	6006000	And it came out in May 2003.
6006000	6011000	Now that it's, well, not quite ten years old, but getting up to ten years old,
6011000	6015000	so, um, I can do it.
6015000	6021000	There was also a port to Windows done that I heard was absolutely wretched and haven't played yet.
6021000	6025000	And then a high def version that came out in 2012, but it's shit.
6027000	6030000	So it's 17 years after the original Silent Hill.
6030000	6037000	Um, and basically he's raising Heather, who really isn't named Heather,
6037000	6042000	but she's going by that name, and she's got an interesting haircut and dyes her hair blonde.
6043000	6047000	She also does very interesting coordination with her jacket.
6048000	6057000	So in this one, like other Silent Hill games, there are different aspects to the game.
6057000	6061000	There is combat, you have exploration, and you have puzzle solving.
6061000	6066000	You know, as in little riddles to solve as you go through the game.
6066000	6072000	And of course picking up maps and bonuses for doing certain things in the game the right way.
6072000	6076000	You, um, can change the difficulty of your puzzles.
6076000	6083000	Um, they're pretty, pretty difficult though, some of them can be.
6083000	6089000	And like even the really hard puzzle in that one requires that you know quite a bit of Shakespeare to solve.
6089000	6094000	You also get unlockable weapons and costume, which my favorite is the magical girl costume,
6094000	6100000	where she does Heather beam, or as I say, has a beam, because even in the American version,
6100000	6106000	she still, she has a very thick Japanese accent for just that attack.
6107000	6117000	So you start off in the game at the mall, and then Claudia finds out she's being stalked by a guy in a trench coat.
6117000	6121000	And then she goes and finds her dad.
6121000	6125000	I won't say what he's like, because if you haven't played it by now, he's dead.
6125000	6129000	And then she goes into Silent Hill. Yay!
6129000	6134000	And there's like this whole plot to Rebirth of God.
6134000	6139000	It has a lot to do, like I said, it's technically the sequel to the first Silent Hill.
6139000	6141000	It continues that story.
6141000	6144000	It has very, very interesting creatures in that game too.
6144000	6152000	And there's also a dude named Vincent, who isn't as cool as Vincent Valentine, but I won't go there.
6152000	6156000	So like I said, there's three endings. You have the normal ending.
6156000	6167000	You have a possessed ending and the revenge ending, which the revenge ending is actually the UFO ending.
6167000	6172000	That has the best Silent Hill song ever, Silent Hill no Uta.
6173000	6176000	Silent Hill, Silent Hill, anyway.
6176000	6181000	I know I've done it as a fortune cookie before, but I'm not doing it tonight.
6181000	6192000	So yeah, Silent Hill 3 is seriously my favorite of the Silent Hill games, because I love how much work went into it.
6192000	6197000	There's actually a full documentary on the making of this game that you can find on YouTube.
6197000	6200000	Where they went all out for the voice acting.
6200000	6206000	They went all out for face models for the rendering of the animations.
6206000	6208000	It was really, really well done.
6208000	6216000	And then there's also another note that it was influenced by Jacob's Ladder.
6218000	6225000	Lots of different facets from that and other horror stories were incorporated into the game as influences.
6226000	6240000	Like I was talking about the face models, they actually were drawn from references to real life actors and actresses so that they would look realistic.
6240000	6247000	The original name for Heather was actually Helen, but she was renamed Heather for her voice actress.
6248000	6254000	And she was modeled after a French actress, actually a couple of them, after Charlotte Gainsborough.
6254000	6260000	And another one that's actually very familiar to us, Vanessa Paradis, who was married to Johnny Depp for a while.
6261000	6265000	And did a very, very, actually a few really good songs.
6265000	6274000	So yeah, there was also now that Silent Hill Revelation 3D, which we were supposed to go see and never did, was based off of Silent Hill 3.
6274000	6276000	There's always Blu-Ray.
6277000	6280000	Yeah, the Blu-Ray's gotta be out really soon.
6280000	6283000	I'm totally getting it. So yeah, there you go. Silent Hill 3.
6283000	6289000	And the source game for one of my favorite songs in DDR Extreme US.
6290000	6291000	Oh, the...
6292000	6293000	You're Not Here.
6293000	6295000	Yeah, I'm like, I can sing it, I don't know the name.
6295000	6297000	It was really good, the video and everything else, really good chart.
6297000	6301000	That was one of the better things to come out of Extreme US.
6301000	6303000	Not that that was a bad game, all things considered.
6304000	6307000	Minus the crappy disc wheel. It was a really, really good game.
6307000	6309000	There is your classic game of the week.
6309000	6311000	And classic DDR reference of the week.
6311000	6314000	Yes, exactly. We have DDR references coming up in part B tonight.
6314000	6319000	So don't go anywhere. We've got more Orange Lounge Radio to come, including apparently a DDR reference.
6319000	6323000	Fugu question of the week, rapid fire news, your emails and your phone calls.
6323000	6326000	All when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6326000	6340000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live with episode number 489 of our show for this January the 13th of 2013.
6340000	6349000	Myself, Loki and DarkSakura are joined in studio tonight with Jason and Rai, who are visiting Colorado as they have been.
6349000	6354000	And Jason, of course, I always like to acknowledge that without Jason, we wouldn't have an OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6355000	6358000	So thank you to Jason for all the work he does with that.
6360000	6366000	During the break, usually we don't talk about the break music because we can't play it due to copyright reasons.
6366000	6369000	But I've got to give a plug to this guy so the podcasters can sneak him out too.
6369000	6372000	Because that remix that we played was great.
6372000	6374000	So please give this guy a plug here where everybody can hear it.
6375000	6377000	Aethernaut's original works are on Bandcamp.
6377000	6382000	Aethernaut.bandcamp.com.
6382000	6384000	Same username on Soundcloud.
6384000	6387000	That remix is one since it's obviously not his originally.
6387000	6388000	You can get that on Soundcloud.
6388000	6389000	Soundcloud.com slash Aethernaut.
6389000	6392000	Let me, for the sake of the podcasters, let me play just a clip here.
6392000	6393000	Because I can do clips.
6393000	6399000	Let me play a clip of his remix of the moon during the break that I was like, wow, this guy is like really cool.
6404000	6408000	So what's that website again, the Bandcamp site, right?
6408000	6411000	His Bandcamp is Aethernaut.bandcamp.com.
6411000	6414000	This song in particular, Soundcloud.com slash Aethernaut.
6414000	6417000	A-E-T-H-E-R-N-A-U-T.
6417000	6418000	Correct.
6418000	6420000	Nice stuff.
6420000	6422000	Good times. Good pick.
6422000	6424000	I should let you pick the break music every week.
6424000	6425000	Woo!
6425000	6428000	Alright, or was that, or was that, who discovered Aethernaut, was that right?
6428000	6430000	It was basically mutual.
6431000	6432000	That's the right answer.
6432000	6435000	We went to a Chiptune showcase, we were both there, and we were both like, fuck yeah, dude.
6435000	6436000	Alright, very good.
6436000	6441000	And it was mine that I was playing while we were doing stuff before the show over here.
6441000	6443000	Yeah, she was the one that actually had music running.
6443000	6445000	She got it introduced to me.
6445000	6446000	Yes.
6446000	6447000	Alright.
6447000	6448000	She'll get credit for that one.
6448000	6449000	You guys have good taste.
6449000	6450000	Alright, let's move on.
6450000	6452000	Rapid Fire news time.
6452000	6454000	Some quick news stories, starting off with Loki.
6454000	6456000	Alright, so this is kind of cool.
6456000	6459000	They have this, they have this, they have this, they have this.
6459000	6467000	They have this mod for Minecraft, and it allows someone to actually connect multiple worlds together.
6467000	6474000	Now, they have this before where you can create multiple kind of worlds in Minecraft, but this is actually unifying servers.
6474000	6486000	And the guy that developed this, was it, I guess it's the MD5 proxy system, which is now called Bungee Cord, if you look for it on the bucket.
6487000	6489000	Basically, he has it set up now.
6489000	6494000	He's got a server with a lobby that allows, you know, like 2,000 people in there.
6494000	6501000	And instead of, you know, searching for Minecraft servers and stuff that might be full, you go in this lobby and you pick a server out of there.
6501000	6502000	And you get all the information.
6502000	6507000	So it's almost like an MMO now where you can hop in and out of these servers and go, like, with your friends.
6507000	6514000	Like, say, hey, you know, I'm going to go build on the VoG Minecraft server right now, and then let's hop out.
6514000	6517000	We're going to go to a server that's running, like, the Hunger Games minigame stuff.
6517000	6523000	Or, hey, I want to run to a server that's doing, like, you know, survival or something like that instead of creative.
6523000	6525000	And you can do that, which is pretty awesome.
6525000	6528000	So it's out there.
6528000	6535000	Not something I'm going to run on the Minecraft or our Minecraft server because we have enough trouble filling up one server, let alone multiple servers.
6535000	6537000	And our server is whitelist only, which is important.
6537000	6541000	But I think that makes it very attractive to play on because you don't get griefers.
6541000	6544000	Because if any of our listeners turn into griefers, I will beat you.
6544000	6548000	And also I log, you know, it's logging whatever you do.
6548000	6549000	So we will find you.
6549000	6550000	I dig holes.
6550000	6551000	Don't be afraid to have fun.
6551000	6552000	Yeah, exactly.
6552000	6555000	I mean, you know, I have rules listed.
6555000	6556000	Come on.
6556000	6560000	It's just like I'll let you do whatever as long as you don't fuck up someone else's shit.
6560000	6567000	You know, just do I have a sign now in my little I don't even know where you are, so I haven't added yet.
6567000	6569000	So I live in a prairie dog town.
6569000	6573000	Well, once I find you, I'll add you or I'll show you how to do it.
6573000	6575000	I'll put nasty notes in front of your house.
6575000	6577000	My house is underground.
6577000	6580000	Which means you'll have to log in and finish your house.
6580000	6583000	Well, I can make it snow in her house.
6583000	6585000	No, because my house is underground.
6585000	6586000	My house is covered.
6586000	6588000	My doors are covered in glass.
6588000	6590000	Can I can I get lava to flow through her house?
6590000	6592000	Oh, that's griefing.
6592000	6594000	You can make it snow in her house, actually.
6594000	6595000	Ah, there we go.
6595000	6597000	No snow in my house.
6597000	6598000	We're not going to.
6598000	6601000	My house is going to be constantly evolving, which is why I'm building it underground.
6601000	6604000	All right. So that's kind of cool.
6604000	6609000	And then Sony is actually kind of following the footsteps of Microsoft,
6609000	6614000	and they're going to have a web based store for the Sony Entertainment Network.
6614000	6617000	So you can actually buy stuff and, you know, download it.
6617000	6620000	They're working on automatic downloading to go with that.
6620000	6622000	But it's kind of cool that they're doing that.
6622000	6623000	So you can browse.
6623000	6625000	Welcome to 2007 Sony.
6625000	6628000	About fucking time.
6628000	6634000	I mean, I guess I guess they had to scrap all their plans when they rebuilt the whole fucking PSN a few years ago.
6634000	6635000	But Jesus.
6635000	6638000	And then finally, there's another bundle that you might be interested in.
6638000	6640000	This is called the free bundle.
6640000	6646000	And basically, regardless of what you might want to pay for this bundle, it's free.
6646000	6650000	And you can pick up five games from the free bundle dot com.
6650000	6656000	And these games are Nitronic Rush, which is a cool survival driving game.
6656000	6658000	A Bobo's Big Adventure.
6658000	6660000	Yes, that's right. A Bobo from...
6660000	6661000	Downloaded it.
6661000	6663000	Yes, from Double Dragon.
6663000	6666000	And also, let's see, Ascension.
6666000	6670000	It's a side scroller horror game, a celestial mechanical.
6670000	6677000	And see, that's, I guess, has some animation done by Super Crate Box, his Paul Veer.
6677000	6684000	And then I'm Scared, which they say is a self professed Minecraft meets Slender game.
6684000	6687000	I was looking at it. I didn't want it.
6687000	6690000	But they're all free for a limited amount of time.
6690000	6691000	Were you scared?
6691000	6693000	No, I was apathetic.
6693000	6698000	So the free bundle, in case, you know, the humble bundle is too expensive for you.
6698000	6700000	You know what the free bundle needs more of?
6700000	6701000	Because this game's free?
6701000	6704000	Frog Fractions. Just saying.
6704000	6705000	Alright.
6705000	6708000	And look, they added another game to the free bundle.
6708000	6710000	Now they have Treasure Adventure Island.
6710000	6712000	Or Treasure Venture Game.
6712000	6714000	So, that's cool.
6714000	6716000	Go download it for free.
6716000	6718000	And it's up for another 32 days.
6718000	6726000	Alright, well if you like to let video game consoles have an influence on your car buying purchases, then maybe this car is for you.
6726000	6730000	It's an official Xbox 360 car from Volkswagen.
6730000	6731000	That's right.
6731000	6734000	Oh, it's only available in Mexico, however.
6734000	6737000	Act EFT. There you go, buddy.
6737000	6739000	Buy it, send pictures, please.
6739000	6748000	Well, there's a little picture here. I mean, this is more of a render, but it actually has like the little Xbox stripe along the bottom and it's like that green color or what have you.
6748000	6756000	If you buy this, by the way, should you buy the Volkswagen Xbox 360, you get an Xbox 360 with a copy of Forza 4. What a deal.
6756000	6761000	Wow, Forza from like, not 2012, but from the year before that.
6761000	6765000	Which I think is like a packing game now in some of their systems.
6765000	6770000	Earlier, somebody brought up Bayonetta, probably because you were talking about the anarchy reigns.
6770000	6778000	But Bayonetta, a lot of demand for Bayonetta to show up on the Wii U eShop because of the fact that Bayonetta 2 is going to turn up on Wii U.
6778000	6785000	And people aren't necessarily going to be familiar with it unless they had a 360 or a Playstation 3 and played through that.
6785000	6793000	So, Platinum Games Designer Hideki Kamiya was asked on Twitter, will the original Bayonetta come to Wii U?
6793000	6798000	And the response, it's up to Sega or Ninty, which is Twitter speak for Nintendo.
6798000	6803000	So, apparently it is completely up to Sega and Nintendo if that's going to happen or not.
6803000	6805000	So, no pressure, make it happen.
6805000	6806000	Not going to happen.
6806000	6807000	Not going to happen, I agree.
6808000	6812000	One more story, I had a few friends that were talking about this and I thought this sounded really cool.
6812000	6818000	And I watched a little bit of it, but not as much as like Flaco Jones and some other people I know that listen to this show.
6818000	6830000	It was the third annual Awesome Games Done Quick Marathon raised more than $327,000 raised during this marathon.
6830000	6834000	I didn't see, what, did I miss, what charity did that go for?
6835000	6840000	I want to know, that's the most important part. Oh, Prevent Cancer Foundation. Oh, that's a very worthy cause, good job.
6840000	6846000	They played through more than 120 titles, everything from Skyrim to Echo the Dolphin.
6846000	6847000	Good times.
6847000	6854000	The viewers were also able to bid on items, make donations and leave comments that could have possibly been read on air.
6854000	6858000	Lots of good stuff that they played through and they did them quickly.
6858000	6860000	It's not just a clever name.
6860000	6865000	Yoshi's Island in almost 100% in like three hours.
6865000	6869000	They, they did, I mean, they did games that don't take necessarily that long to beat.
6869000	6874000	Like, um, I don't know, Mario 64, cause you could run through that without getting all the stars.
6874000	6876000	Although I don't know if they did 100% completion or whatever.
6876000	6879000	And then they did Final Fantasy 9. Good lord.
6880000	6883000	How do you do an RPG quick? I missed that one. I should try to find out.
6883000	6885000	More A-mashing.
6887000	6888000	Alright, moving on.
6888000	6890000	My laptop just died actually officially.
6890000	6891000	Oh.
6891000	6893000	Hold on, I got it to reboot.
6893000	6894000	Good times.
6894000	6898000	Yeah, it completely, uh, Linux doesn't blue screen, it black screens.
6899000	6901000	Alrighty then, maybe I should go to the FUGL question and we'll come back?
6901000	6902000	Maybe.
6902000	6904000	Alright, let's go to the FUGL question.
6910000	6913000	Put Facebook and Google together and you get FUGL.
6913000	6921000	And that's the inspiration for this segment of our show where we ask a question of our listeners on Facebook and Google Plus fan communities.
6921000	6925000	And we read some of our favorite answers here on the air.
6925000	6927000	Here's the question this week.
6928000	6936000	There's been a lot of talk the past couple weeks about the potential and speculative emphasis on that negative influence that video games have on society.
6936000	6939000	But let's take a moment to talk about the good.
6939000	6944000	What are some of the good things that video games have done for you in your life?
6944000	6948000	I wanted to offset all this negativity going around this week about, you know, violent video games.
6948000	6949000	I want to hear the good stuff.
6949000	6951000	Let's give the media this to report on.
6951000	6952000	They won't.
6953000	6956000	On Google Plus, some of the good things that video games have done for you.
6956000	6957000	Act deft.
6957000	6959000	I'll summarize my answer in one word.
6959000	6960000	Inspire.
6961000	6972000	Flaco Jones says, my wife and I had video games in common at the early stages of our relationship, and they continue to be a positive thing we bond over to this day.
6972000	6973000	That's really cute.
6973000	6974000	Thank you.
6974000	6977000	You're a month early, Flaco.
6977000	6980000	And even even Alan and I do that.
6980000	6982000	Like we leveled characters together and wow.
6985000	6986000	All right.
6986000	6987000	We met over DDR.
6987000	6988000	Me and Ryan met over DDR.
6989000	6993000	But yet in Loki's relationship, that doesn't end up being the case, really.
6993000	6994000	No, not at all.
6995000	6997000	It just goes to show you everybody's a little bit different.
6998000	6999000	All right.
7000000	7005000	For you, the good things that video games did is it gives you an excuse to get away from your wife for a couple hours every week.
7005000	7006000	I'm just kidding.
7006000	7007000	I'm kidding.
7007000	7008000	I love Nellie.
7008000	7009000	She knows that.
7009000	7010000	All right.
7010000	7011000	I can't get away from her.
7012000	7013000	She's always watching.
7013000	7015000	She's probably listening right now.
7015000	7016000	All right.
7016000	7017000	No, she's not.
7017000	7018000	No, come on.
7018000	7019000	I don't understand.
7019000	7020000	It's so nerdy.
7020000	7021000	You're a nerd, Matt.
7021000	7022000	All right.
7023000	7029000	Redertainment says video games fill a role in my life that other people fill with movies, TV, books, music, et cetera.
7029000	7031000	Video games ever entertain me.
7031000	7033000	Video games also save me money.
7033000	7039000	Think about how much entertainment you get per dollar with a 40 hour long video game as opposed to a two to four hour long movie.
7040000	7041000	That's a very good answer.
7041000	7043000	And then think of a book and weep.
7043000	7044000	All right.
7044000	7045000	All right.
7047000	7049000	I love this answer in our chat room.
7049000	7051000	Bobby Black Wolf in our chat.
7052000	7056000	Video games let me meet all you wonderful people as well as act deft.
7057000	7058000	Ouch.
7060000	7061000	Ouch.
7063000	7064000	Going to Facebook.
7064000	7065000	I've got my stuff up, by the way.
7065000	7066000	Okay.
7066000	7068000	Well, let me do Facebook and then we'll go back to Rapid Fire News.
7068000	7069000	That's live radio, kids.
7069000	7071000	Sometimes you have to mix it up a bit.
7071000	7075000	Facebook Code Man says to be honest, video games keep me balanced.
7075000	7078000	I use video games as a distressing mechanism.
7078000	7080000	When I have a long day, I think that's de-stressing.
7080000	7081000	De-stressing, yeah.
7081000	7082000	It's not distressing.
7082000	7083000	I'll blame autocorrect for that.
7083000	7086000	It is via mobile, so it was probably autocorrect.
7086000	7090000	When I have a long day at work and get home, I first greet my family and spend time with them.
7090000	7094000	But if it's a crazy stressful day, I play video games a bit to de-stress.
7094000	7098000	It's the same as a person who reads a book or watches their favorite shows.
7098000	7100000	It calms them down and brings them to a better level.
7101000	7106000	AZHP responds and says, video games introduced me to pretty much all the friends I have now in one way or another.
7106000	7112000	When I decided to start playing DDR, I could have never have guessed that it would lead to me meeting a group of like-minded people
7112000	7119000	who accepted me for who I am and created lifelong friendships that have lasted for, well, as long as this show has been running.
7119000	7120000	It's true.
7120000	7122000	Without video games, I wouldn't have this show.
7122000	7124000	I probably wouldn't be podcasting.
7124000	7125000	I don't know.
7125000	7130000	I like the sound of my voice so much, though, I would have think I would have discovered podcasting through, like, another hobby.
7131000	7132000	Who knows?
7132000	7135000	I don't actually like hearing my own voice, so that's why I don't listen to us.
7135000	7136000	Really?
7136000	7137000	Yeah, no, it's true.
7137000	7141000	I think that's why I was so timid, especially last time I was here.
7141000	7145000	The tough thing, though, about it is that, like, I'm my own worst critic.
7145000	7149000	Like, I don't hate to hear my own voice, although, but I'll listen to myself and I'll go,
7149000	7151000	Ugh, you sound so...
7151000	7152000	You should sound more...
7152000	7154000	What the hell are we talking about?
7154000	7156000	No, I'm actually...
7157000	7159000	But anyway, let's see, more answers.
7159000	7160000	Wendy S.
7160000	7165000	I think video games have taught me about the sports whose games I play, FIFA, NBA 2K.
7165000	7168000	They also keep your mind and reflexes sharp as you grow older.
7168000	7176000	I honestly believe, due to video games, there will be less dementia among seniors in the future if you assume current gamers will keep playing as they age.
7176000	7184000	Finally, I wanted to note that I think when teenagers attain positions of responsibility in their guild or clan, it teaches them leadership and responsibility.
7185000	7191000	That's an interesting way to... I like the angle that, you know, it keeps your certain skills up so that when you get old, you don't lose them.
7191000	7194000	You know, we see this a lot.
7194000	7200000	Well, I don't know how much you guys, like, go to old folks' homes, but they do, like, Wii bowling and that stuff is, like, still something they do.
7200000	7205000	And a lot of that is to, I mean, we might, like, laugh, like, you know, play a better game, old guy.
7205000	7209000	But it kind of still keeps all that function going.
7210000	7215000	My grandma's in one of those places and I was looking at the calendar and they had a Wii bowling night every Monday. It was something else.
7215000	7217000	Alright, um...
7217000	7220000	I wasn't laughing at you, I was laughing at a comment in chat.
7220000	7222000	What was the comment that made you laugh? Who said it?
7222000	7226000	Raginator says, I agree with Rob Roberts. He does love the sound of his own voice.
7226000	7228000	I'm sexy, damn it.
7228000	7230000	Not as much as I love Dubstep Bird.
7230000	7232000	Alright, um...
7232000	7234000	I closed the window, damn it.
7234000	7244000	James S. replies and says, I know I've read somewhere lately that there were a few scientific tests done by a university that had proven that gaming actually strengthened your brain in areas that are vital for everyday life.
7244000	7248000	Anything from basic motor skills to depth perception to decision making.
7248000	7250000	Games aren't the culprit for these random acts of violence.
7250000	7253000	Violence has always been there, gaming hasn't.
7253000	7256000	It's just that some people are sick and need help, simple as that.
7256000	7258000	You know, that's a really damn good way of looking at it.
7258000	7261000	Violence has always been there, gaming hasn't.
7261000	7264000	Although one could argue, you know, chess has been around a long time.
7264000	7267000	But I get what you're saying. I totally get what you're saying, dude. That's a good point.
7267000	7273000	Alright, Dartetsuya says, even before you guys started OLR, there was a time?
7273000	7282000	Even before you guys started OLR, I met you guys via the epic music game Parties that were thrown back in early 2000.
7282000	7284000	Not gonna lie, I miss those days.
7284000	7288000	Playing B-Mania 2DX till the sun came up the next day, good times.
7288000	7291000	Oh, how many days we had like that, right Jason?
7291000	7295000	Do you still have a lot of those old games, Dark Sakura?
7295000	7298000	I have every single Bimani game I've ever purchased.
7298000	7301000	You know, one of these days for old time's sake, we need to have...
7301000	7304000	That should be the freaking game marathon.
7304000	7306000	Have an old school DVR night.
7306000	7307000	Our pajama party?
7307000	7308000	All night long.
7308000	7309000	Our pajama party?
7309000	7311000	Oh yeah, we're not supposed to talk about that on the air.
7311000	7313000	Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
7313000	7317000	Put the ixnay on the illo pipe fay.
7317000	7319000	I didn't say anything about that.
7319000	7321000	Okay, I know, anyway.
7321000	7323000	I think we should do a drunk DDR fest.
7323000	7324000	That'd be awesome.
7324000	7331000	I've played DDR drunk before and I nearly busted my head open on somebody's clothes washer.
7331000	7340000	I was actually going through my closet today and I found two unused DDR pads from DDR Universe 1 and Universe 2.
7341000	7343000	They're still folded up in there.
7343000	7347000	Why am I not... You're not coming through very loud. I don't know why. That's weird.
7347000	7349000	Sorry, am I not talking loud?
7349000	7350000	Now we are.
7350000	7352000	Anyways, yeah.
7352000	7359000	I have two DDR pads. I think I sold the game, but I sold the pads that have never been used.
7359000	7361000	They're still there.
7361000	7362000	I wonder what else is there.
7362000	7364000	Oh, I also dug through the closet.
7364000	7374000	There's a lot more game, like, main cabinet buttons and stuff from when I was going to make all the Bimani controllers and stuff for it.
7374000	7377000	I have a ton of crap in there. It's ridiculous.
7379000	7385000	We have a full-size pop-in controller still. We have, I think, four 2DX controllers.
7385000	7387000	Yeah, it should be two American, two Japanese.
7388000	7394000	You know, I actually found an official Konami PlayStation dance pad at the thrift store.
7394000	7400000	I got a DDR story coming up. We can reminisce more, but I want to get to what more listeners said.
7400000	7402000	Okay, just let me know when I can read my rapid fire.
7402000	7404000	We'll get to it. I promise.
7404000	7405000	Okay.
7405000	7409000	See, all I did is I just switched that with that and we'll just keep going.
7409000	7411000	Alright, live radio. It's an adventure.
7411000	7413000	Burr replies and says,
7413000	7422000	Video games have taught me history, given me an appreciation for music and art, introduced me to friends around the world, and inspired my imagination for almost 30 years now.
7422000	7428000	What has watching endless cable television news and punditry done for the people on the other side of the table?
7428000	7429000	Hear, hear.
7429000	7430000	That was like-
7430000	7431000	Comedians?
7431000	7435000	That was the appropriate level of bitchiness that an answer needs.
7435000	7439000	That's, frame it. Cut, print. That's a great answer.
7439000	7441000	All these answers are so good tonight.
7441000	7444000	I'm reading them all. I don't care. This show's running long. I don't care.
7444000	7445000	We'll do it live.
7445000	7446000	Yeah, fuck it. We'll do it live.
7446000	7447000	Rageinator.
7447000	7449000	Well, here's three ways they help me.
7449000	7453000	One, in terms of games like first person shooters, Call of Duty, Halo, they help me vent.
7453000	7457000	If I'm pissed off at whomever, it's easier- it's better to take it out virtually-
7457000	7459000	Whom? Awesome.
7459000	7464000	It's better to take it out virtually, rather IRL, for a whole host of reasons.
7464000	7469000	Two, gaming serves as a social outlet, contrary to what older generations would have you believe.
7469000	7473000	And online gaming is a lot cheaper than other things, such as a night out drinking with friends.
7473000	7474000	Thank you.
7474000	7475000	Ain't that the truth.
7475000	7478000	Do you know how much drinks cost at the bar?
7478000	7479000	Yes.
7479000	7484000	For like, I could get a Long Island iced tea top shelf or a month of wow. I get it. I get it.
7484000	7490000	Three, online gaming gives you an opportunity to meet other people that odds are you wouldn't otherwise meet.
7490000	7496000	Or conversely, it, like Facebook, helps you maintain friendships with those that move out of your area.
7496000	7499000	Unlike Facebook though, one can do more than talk via text.
7499000	7501000	Thank you.
7501000	7504000	Welcome. Alright, that was for Rageinator.
7504000	7509000	Tiger Claw says, Video games have been a part of my life ever since I was a kid.
7509000	7513000	I know for a fact that you should never ever take video games seriously.
7513000	7519000	They provided me with hours of entertainment, and also great during times when you're feeling down or bored.
7519000	7527000	Gamer Girl says, I suffer from major depressive disorder, and ever since I was a kid, it's been my way to shut things out till I'm ready to deal with them.
7527000	7528000	This is a heavy answer.
7528000	7533000	It's like a way for me to be someone else for a while, until I'm ready to deal with what's going on.
7533000	7537000	And not only that, but it helped my reflexes as a kid due to being disabled.
7537000	7542000	So it's always helped me deal with real life in some way or another, and always good.
7542000	7549000	Why don't they fucking read that on Fox News?
7549000	7552000	Because it doesn't suit their agenda.
7552000	7558000	Sorry, I just had this moment of like, I'm angry now.
7558000	7561000	I'm not angry at you, Gamer Girl. I think you're great.
7561000	7565000	That answer is just so powerful.
7565000	7569000	It's like, I'm speechless.
7569000	7571000	It bears repeating, doesn't it?
7571000	7575000	Gamer Girl, you got me to shut up. Congratulations. You got me to shut up with that answer.
7575000	7580000	I've been trying that for years.
7580000	7582000	Lastly, DDR Dollar Bill.
7582000	7586000	If it wasn't for DDR, I wouldn't have become more social and outgoing.
7586000	7588000	But this is heavy stuff, guys.
7588000	7594000	Too long to tell this story, but the game was responsible for reigniting my desire for dancing and music.
7594000	7598000	I do love gaming, though I do want a future where games are more interactive.
7598000	7601000	Wait for the usual crap about go play football or some other sport.
7601000	7603000	Just not where the game is bad.
7603000	7606000	A fighting game that you actually have to move?
7606000	7609000	Well, the holodeck's only a matter of time away.
7609000	7611000	I read every single answer tonight.
7611000	7613000	You don't have to visit Facebook or Google. Those are all great answers.
7613000	7616000	Maybe there'll be some late-coming answers later.
7616000	7618000	You should still join our communities on Facebook.
7618000	7621000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google Plus.
7621000	7625000	Search for Orange Lounge Radio.
7625000	7627000	You wanna know what my answer to that one is?
7627000	7630000	And it's very specific.
7630000	7634000	Super Mario RPG taught me rhythm before anything else did.
7634000	7635000	Really?
7635000	7640000	Yeah, it's the simplest story and it's the funniest little thing, but I came to this realization not long ago
7640000	7645000	and now that I'm all music-oriented, my brain is starting to work in that manner.
7645000	7652000	I've listened to music, I've heard it, whatever, but I guess the finer points of music and music theory?
7652000	7656000	The bonus game on Yoster's Isle where the Yoshis race.
7656000	7659000	The first time I tried it, AB, AB, AB, AB, mash the buttons.
7659000	7661000	Why isn't it doing anything?
7661000	7668000	And one of the Yoshis gives you a hint or something like that talks about that you go with the backbeat of the song.
7668000	7673000	It's like, oh, look at that. Alternate in time and your Yoshi runs away.
7673000	7677000	And it was just like the simplest thing, but that was what really sealed the deal.
7678000	7682000	Music games came along after the fact to really turn that into its own little world,
7682000	7690000	but that was the first time that music had something specific instead of just being the art as it is.
7690000	7692000	It's really the only way that I can describe it.
7692000	7700000	I remember that very distinctly, that things just felt different after an example of the backbeat in Super Mario RPG.
7702000	7705000	For me, video games gave me this.
7706000	7708000	I mean, for real. I know we joked about it a minute ago.
7708000	7709000	Video games gave me this.
7709000	7714000	And this is almost an extension of when I was growing up, I got picked on a lot.
7714000	7715000	I can't imagine why.
7715000	7720000	But for real, guys, I got called fag and all those dirty words you can possibly imagine a lot.
7720000	7724000	And then it's like those same kids would turn around and ask me for advice on video games.
7724000	7726000	Like, how do I get to the second quest in Zelda?
7726000	7728000	Or how do I find level nine in the second quest?
7728000	7731000	Like, come meet me behind the building.
7731000	7734000	That type of thing where it's like, I don't want the other kids to see that I'm talking to you,
7734000	7736000	but I know you're the video game expert.
7736000	7740000	And in some ways, this is almost an extension of that.
7740000	7742000	I'm still talking to people about video games.
7742000	7748000	I might not be as good at them as I used to be, but here I am with a bunch of awesome, like-minded people.
7748000	7750000	It's just great.
7750000	7751000	I know.
7751000	7753000	I know. I know. Especially you, Jamie.
7753000	7754000	Especially me.
7754000	7760000	Well, in an extension on the inspiration part, it has me writing, it has me drawing.
7760000	7763000	You know, there's so much that it brings.
7763000	7767000	And yeah, go read a book. A book will do the same thing.
7767000	7774000	But I think just the visual part of it, having somebody else's characters that you can kind of run free with kind of helps too.
7774000	7776000	Absolutely.
7776000	7778000	Original works, original inspirations.
7778000	7783000	All right, before we get back into Jamie's rapid fire news stories, anything else anyone wants to share on that topic?
7783000	7785000	Um, no.
7785000	7787000	All right, let's get back to rapid fire news.
7787000	7788000	I would like a pony.
7788000	7789000	Not really.
7789000	7791000	You can't have a pony. You can play Barbie Horse Adventures.
7791000	7793000	I'm actually super allergic to horses, so I really don't want a pony.
7793000	7795000	You can have a virtual pony.
7795000	7797000	So how about Marvel Super Heroes?
7797000	7798000	Derby Owners Club.
7798000	7799000	And Legos.
7799000	7801000	I miss Derby Owners Club.
7801000	7804000	Um, they got rid of the one at Dave & Buster's.
7804000	7805000	Oh, sad.
7805000	7806000	I didn't see it last time I was there.
7806000	7808000	Do you still have your card with your horse named Glue?
7808000	7809000	I have my binder.
7809000	7810000	Nice.
7810000	7812000	Yeah, I do have a horse named Glue.
7812000	7814000	You had Politary.
7814000	7816000	So you could whip Politary.
7816000	7819000	Politary is sad because Rob beat her too hard.
7819000	7820000	Um, anyway.
7820000	7824000	Um, so Lego Marvel Super Heroes is going to be coming out.
7824000	7828000	And, I'm very happy.
7828000	7835000	It's got an original storyline where Nick Fury needs the help of Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and other heroes to stop Loki and Galactus.
7835000	7838000	That's a team I would never have seen together, Loki and Galactus.
7838000	7843000	I would think Galactus would be too busy eating planets to deal with the, you know, Norse God.
7843000	7846000	Whose planet he wants to eat.
7846000	7851000	Also next up, Capcom Arcade Cabinet has been confirmed for the West.
7851000	7854000	Ooh.
7854000	7860000	Um, basically it's a platform for Xbox Live Arcade and PSN that will be coming in the US.
7860000	7865000	And we should be seeing more information on it on February 7th as far as what games are coming out.
7865000	7868000	But one of the confirmed games is Black Tiger for the US release.
7868000	7870000	As well as Japan.
7870000	7871000	Dan will be happy.
7871000	7872000	Dan will be really happy.
7872000	7874000	So basically it's Game Room.
7874000	7876000	But it's only Capcom.
7876000	7878000	Capcom.
7878000	7884000	And then, last but not least, LittleBigPlanet 2 Extras Edition is announced.
7884000	7892000	And, um, it will have the, uh, recently, um, released cross controller pack.
7892000	7897000	So that's used the Vita as a controller and the move pack, Rise of the Kaling.
7897000	7899000	And all kinds of fun stuff.
7899000	7903000	And, uh, however, I don't believe it has what date it's gonna be out on.
7903000	7905000	So yeah, that's it.
7905000	7907000	Alright.
7907000	7910000	And now I got more stuff to do, don't I?
7910000	7912000	Uh, no. We'll go to Loki next.
7912000	7913000	Well, I got stuff to do.
7913000	7915000	Soon. Soon.
7915000	7916000	Yes.
7916000	7928000	So, um, there was, of course, this lawsuit in place, um, from Gamefly who was saying they were getting unfair treatment for their, um,
7928000	7930000	you know, their packages going out.
7930000	7938000	Because Netflix and, I guess, Blockbuster Online were getting sorted manually, um, through the postal system.
7938000	7940000	Whereas their stuff was not.
7940000	7942000	It was going through machines and those were breaking discs.
7942000	7951000	In fact, there was actually some, uh, there was a screenshot or a photo of this, like, you know, bin that says Netflix and Blockbuster DVDs.
7951000	7953000	Doesn't say Gamefly DVDs.
7953000	7962000	Um, and so it actually, they ruled in favor of Gamefly and, um, basically told, you know, the US Postal Service that,
7962000	7969000	hey, you guys need to either fix this or you need to let us know, you know, tell us what's going on.
7969000	7971000	Why are you guys doing this?
7971000	7979000	I mean, it's obvious that, you know, that you're doing this stuff and, you know, these companies aren't paying you any extra money to have this preferential treatment.
7979000	7982000	Now, you either gotta do it for everybody or you're gonna do it for no one.
7982000	7984000	So, interesting.
7984000	7990000	Um, hopefully that means less broken DVDs in the mail.
7990000	7995000	I don't know, have you ever gotten anything from, you know, Gamefly that was smashed?
7995000	7996000	No.
7996000	7997000	Yeah, so.
7997000	7999000	Everything's worked fine for me.
7999000	8003000	Maybe it's just, like, more metropolitan areas, you know, where there's a lot more mail.
8003000	8004000	Maybe.
8004000	8006000	I live in an apartment complex, you know.
8006000	8012000	It's not like they handle the mail totally well around here sometimes, but it works.
8012000	8015000	Um, moving on, I promised you some DDR talk.
8015000	8016000	Here you go.
8016000	8021000	Dance Dance Revolution Classroom Edition made an appearance at CES this year.
8021000	8024000	Konami and United Healthcare Group teaming up to bring this.
8024000	8028000	I thought that was kind of an interesting partnership between Konami and an insurance company.
8028000	8031000	Uh, but they brought the game to the show to show it off.
8031000	8036000	Um, I gotta tell you what surprised me about it is that it was neat kind of seeing, like, new DDR.
8036000	8040000	And I was looking at it going, why did they, like, stop the console editions?
8040000	8042000	Like, this is an interesting direction that they were going.
8042000	8045000	I mean, granted, DDR is DDR, but I thought it was kind of cool.
8045000	8048000	I mean, 48 people can play this game at once.
8048000	8051000	That's, like, two PE classes or depending on whatever school you go to, right?
8051000	8057000	Um, and you look at it and they've got one, you know, one tunnel or what do you call that?
8057000	8060000	The area where the notes scroll up.
8060000	8064000	Do they ever have a term for that? The scroll bar? Whatever.
8064000	8066000	The area where the notes scroll up, there's three of them.
8066000	8070000	One for beginners, intermediates, and advanced all at the same time.
8070000	8074000	So I'm assuming that means that people who aren't as good as DDR can play, like, the beginner ones
8074000	8078000	and people who are getting better can play the advanced ones so that everybody can kind of play together.
8078000	8080000	I thought that was kind of neat.
8080000	8085000	Um, apparently the wireless dance pads are made by Performance Design Products
8085000	8089000	and they can actually track a dancer's progress, steps, body mass index,
8089000	8092000	and how many calories you burn through what is a plug-in smart card.
8092000	8094000	BMI is still bullshit.
8094000	8102000	Then why isn't PDP putting these out then for consumers to buy if they're making some decent dance pads, you know what I mean?
8102000	8106000	I was kind of looking at it and going, this is something I wouldn't mind having in my house, actually.
8106000	8109000	I could play with people over the internet or something.
8109000	8116000	Konami has launched this game three schools in Florida, Georgia, and Texas, I guess are the test ground for this.
8117000	8124000	There is a whole video, it looks like Polygon actually did an interview on the floor with some of the people that were showing it,
8124000	8126000	so you can check that out at polygon.com.
8126000	8128000	They actually have a whole little video in their section.
8128000	8130000	Yeah, it was kind of neat to look at.
8130000	8134000	It made me miss the dinner days a little bit. It did.
8134000	8136000	There's a lot that's really interesting about that concept that makes sense.
8136000	8144000	It throws out all of these, you know, expected mechanisms of DDR out the window that, who gives two shits about accuracy?
8144000	8150000	Pick whatever is interesting for you, change on the fly, and the important part of what you have to do is still available.
8150000	8157000	You're still on a dance pad, you're still moving around, you're still doing something and getting that sort of feedback, but you're not,
8157000	8160000	oh, I'm the triple A player of the town.
8160000	8170000	It's weird, they kind of look like, of course they have the overly excited person working at the booth doing, oh, I'm doing this fancy dance work.
8171000	8180000	But the pads themselves kind of look like a cross between the ignition pads where they're kind of thick, but they also are, it's that plastic cover on the top.
8180000	8188000	The only thing I don't like about it is you can't tell, you drift on those types of pads when you can't tell where the actual arrows are versus everything else.
8188000	8193000	But it would still be nice to buy one, you know, if it's going to work pretty well.
8193000	8197000	Obviously, if you're using a PE class, it's got to work somewhat okay.
8197000	8203000	And hell, I mean, we played on soft pads attached to a piece of wood with laminate over the top of them.
8203000	8209000	I am assuming that that would work. It worked okay then.
8209000	8216000	Yeah, they did look like the ignition pads to me, because from a distance I thought they were metal pads, and I was like, damn, this thing's going to be expensive.
8216000	8227000	But yeah, it was more the big, fluffy, but thick, those pads that Red Octane used to do before they got into guitar hero business.
8227000	8236000	There you go. All right. So, moving on. Did your computer go boom again?
8236000	8240000	All right, so let's move on to the next, let's just skip it and come back to it. Loki.
8240000	8249000	All right. So, let's see, we've got an interesting patent for PlayStation.
8249000	8254000	Man, what is with PlayStation and coming out in some really strange ass patents.
8254000	8259000	But this one now, they have got a patent for the Move. It looks like a new Move controller.
8259000	8268000	And the differences with the new controller versus the old one, one that's going to have some sort of interchangeable face plates.
8268000	8278000	So, for example, you can have the four directional buttons on there, or you can have the XO square triangle buttons.
8278000	8283000	Also, it kind of looks like an ice cream scoop, almost.
8283000	8285000	Well, they look like them anyway.
8285000	8293000	Yeah, but instead of having the buttons actually on the side of the pad, your hand would be behind the ball, I guess.
8293000	8302000	And what's also weird about it is they've got these foot attachment things and then in the most ridiculous image for a patent ever,
8302000	8312000	they have some dude with like four Move controllers, because I'm going to really buy four Move controllers for $40 each, doing a fucking like flip kick for a soccer game.
8312000	8316000	He's got those things like attached to his shoes. That is nuts.
8316000	8322000	Yes. Like, I mean, that's just fucking ridiculous. No one's going to do that. You're going to kill yourself.
8322000	8331000	And then we're going to see that on Fox News. Video gamer kills self while playing FIFA, attempting to do a flip kick, hits, you know, coffee table, dies.
8331000	8334000	Or how about kicks the 80 inch television right off the wall.
8334000	8336000	Or somebody else nearby.
8336000	8342000	You know, kickboxing game, Move controller flies off foot. Some weird shit happens.
8342000	8345000	Gamer loses leg in freak accident, kicking fan.
8345000	8355000	Let's just put it this way. OK, I don't know why they're having some sort of this patent, but I hope that God, this is not this isn't what they're bringing for PlayStation four.
8355000	8362000	Hey, you like those Move controllers? Well, guess what? We're going to strap them to every orifice of your body.
8362000	8369000	That's right. We're going to track all of those naughty bits. Does this really solve the very first sentences of this?
8369000	8376000	Sony recently filed a patent that describes a method for determining the location of a PlayStation Move like controller through a sound capturing device.
8376000	8384000	If it's obscured by something in the way, like a body, if you're if you're spinning, if you're moving, the sound really solve the problem.
8384000	8398000	That's how they do it right now. They've got it uses sound, I think, for part of it because they've got so many microphones in the actual like PlayStation eye camera that I thought that's what it was using.
8398000	8403000	I thought it was just light like a special a special wavelength that the camera can see.
8403000	8406000	It's a rotation, a little a little bit of both, I think.
8406000	8411000	I do know that like for voice or something is supposed to be able to track you or track something.
8411000	8420000	It's got like five microphones in that thing. I could just see cause variety three talking about, you know, now on the PlayStation four, it comes with four move controllers.
8420000	8425000	Let me show you a demo now. I will take one controller and put them in each hand and I will shake them up and down.
8425000	8430000	Then I will insert the third move controller into my mouth where I will rock back and forth the fourth move controller.
8430000	8436000	I will shove into my anus. Let's play sing star.
8436000	8448000	It just, I mean, I'm sorry.
8448000	8463000	Okay, here's the thing. Okay. The move controller, it's, I think the move is not that bad, but you know what they're showing with this patent here is basically, you know, they're saying that the controller has got some, you know, the swabble face buttons and stuff.
8463000	8470000	And that, you know, I don't know, I don't think they really know much other than looking at the pictures, but those controllers look a little weird.
8470000	8482000	Um, and I know they've tried, you know, the leg strap stuff, how they've tried that with, you know, the Wii and like, I know they have some fitness games where you can get a leg strap so they can tell that you're, you know, running or something like that.
8482000	8491000	But if this, I guess this thing, it was a determination of controller, three dimensional location using image analysis and ultrasonic communications.
8491000	8500000	So I thought that's how it worked already though. I mean, I don't understand what they would be doing differently in this one.
8500000	8506000	Thank you. SSU and Hunter Matt for getting my reference is Mr. Garrison's gyro cycle thing in that episode of South Park.
8506000	8514000	That's exactly what I was thinking about with the whole PlayStation move patent. Anyhow, it's for the best, Jason, that you don't watch it.
8514000	8520000	All right. Moving on. Let's go back to what we had to skip over. Jamie.
8520000	8531000	Okay. Um, the more news about the OUYA actually. Basically, they've figured out that since it already runs Android games, it will run emulated games too.
8531000	8539000	So people who already have OUYA boards are, um, basically putting up videos that show them playing Street Fighter.
8539000	8542000	Street Fighter, Mario 64 are already running on the OUYA.
8542000	8547000	I think I said this on the show when we bought our Wii, you know what the very first thing was that I did?
8547000	8549000	Emulate. Played Mario 64.
8549000	8555000	Uh, yeah. Very yes to this. I am so excited. Actually, emulators might sell me to OUYA.
8555000	8558000	And from based on the video, they run well.
8558000	8566000	Yeah. The video was not. I looked at it too. All I have to say. Oh yeah.
8566000	8572000	You all right over there? Do you need a move controller to enhance the experience?
8572000	8578000	No. I get the Mario 64 song stuck in my head and it lasts. It doesn't go away.
8578000	8582000	I got Rob doing it.
8582000	8588000	I hope it runs the 64 games. That means I can play F-Zero even though I can kind of...
8588000	8595000	You know what that means? It means my cross crystal dreams. Because that game only exists emulated.
8595000	8602000	Sayin'. And Star Fox 2. If it'll do, um, SNES emulation. Ooh, Star Fox 2.
8602000	8609000	You know what else it means? Yet another emulator with the most unworkable controller for the system with the most unworkable controller.
8609000	8611000	Yes! Here it is running on the OUYA.
8618000	8623000	Multiplayer golden eye over the internet. Yeah! That should be Android Pat possible. Come on.
8623000	8629000	God, I wish. All right. Moving on. Where are we at? Oh, speaking of Virtual Console. What a nice transition.
8629000	8630000	You're welcome.
8630000	8636000	The Wii U Virtual Console games. They will be playable on the gamepad. You know, eventually.
8636000	8646000	A representative for Nintendo said that there is plans to make a Wii U Virtual Console game playable on the new controller solely.
8646000	8650000	Which of course has the touch screen on it. Not that the touch screen is going to do you any good.
8650000	8655000	But it's still a way that you can, you know, you can have your Virtual Console game and you can play it on the TV.
8655000	8661000	Or then somebody wants to watch Oprah or whatever. You can move it to the little device.
8661000	8667000	Because currently they have, you know, the whole, like, was it, emulator running in an emulator.
8667000	8672000	Which I'm sure is fantastic for, you know, processing, you know, emulating an emulator.
8672000	8677000	And I think, Loki, you are right on the money. I think certain DS games, it's just a matter of time before this happens.
8677000	8683000	Why not? I mean, like, Pokemon Pearl would be a great game for this. Honestly. Perfect. Perfect game for this.
8683000	8687000	Because the bottom screen really isn't, it doesn't do a whole lot with the game.
8687000	8689000	I have a better idea. I have a better idea.
8689000	8690000	What?
8690000	8697000	How about a native Wii U Pokemon title that features both screens at all times or as much as possible.
8697000	8698000	You're funny. You're funny.
8698000	8706000	I've got a crazy idea too. What if Pokemon X and Y came out for the 3DS and the Wii U.
8706000	8711000	That you can buy your portable games on the Wii U.
8711000	8718000	Or you can buy them on your 3DS and they are playable on the Wii U and the 3DS.
8718000	8720000	That's madness though, I'm sure.
8722000	8725000	Alright. Does that mean it's time for mailbag?
8725000	8726000	I'm trying to get it to load.
8726000	8729000	I'm all twisted up. I have it up if you need me as a backup.
8729000	8731000	Do you want me to move on? We'll come back to mailbag?
8731000	8735000	Okay. Let's... I'm just improvising tonight, y'all.
8735000	8740000	Let's move on to the FUs of the week. What an appropriate time with computer issues to go to the FUs of the week.
8740000	8755000	Music
8755000	8757000	Need I ask Dar Sakura what she's mad about?
8757000	8762000	Fuck my nutbook. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it.
8762000	8764000	May I have more chocolate?
8764000	8765000	You absolutely may have more chocolate.
8765000	8766000	Thank you.
8766000	8767000	It's in the fridge.
8767000	8768000	Uh, Loki.
8768000	8774000	I feed myself for forgetting to mention that I gassed it up this week on the Down for Maintenance podcast with Code Man and friends.
8774000	8778000	Oh, shit. That's the whole reason you go on other podcasts is to promote your own appearance.
8778000	8781000	Yes, but now I'm promoting my own appearance.
8781000	8785000	You should mention it at the top of next week's show too. Give those guys some love.
8785000	8787000	Will do. It was a lot of fun.
8787000	8791000	Alright, good deal. I haven't listened to the whole episode yet. I want to though.
8791000	8794000	Uh, my FU of the week goes to Rush Limbaugh.
8794000	8796000	Because, what an asshole.
8796000	8798000	What an asshole.
8798000	8803000	I'm not even going to repeat what he said. If you've been reading the news, you know what he said. What an asshole.
8803000	8807000	Don't Google it. Please. Don't give him more attention. He's an asshole. That's all you need to know.
8807000	8809000	Uh, Jason.
8809000	8813000	I'll second that FU for you because I really don't have anything better.
8813000	8814000	And it's always worth it.
8814000	8817000	He's twice the asshole I thought he was.
8817000	8818000	Ry.
8818000	8820000	Fuck you to my job.
8820000	8822000	Fuck you to retail.
8822000	8824000	Fuck you to my boss.
8824000	8825000	Yes.
8826000	8828000	Store boss, not immediate boss.
8828000	8830000	Yes, store boss, not my immediate boss.
8830000	8831000	I love my immediate boss.
8831000	8832000	It matters.
8832000	8835000	It's always the quiet ones that are the angstiest, doesn't it?
8837000	8839000	Fuck it.
8839000	8843000	Suddenly, she's become a level 64 renegade, so look out.
8843000	8845000	Alright, uh, moving on.
8845000	8849000	By the way, I finally found my favorite renegade option in Mass Effect 2.
8849000	8850000	Yes.
8850000	8852000	Making the guy that poisons you drink his own drink.
8853000	8854000	That was fun.
8854000	8855000	Good times.
8855000	8856000	I got mail up, by the way.
8856000	8858000	You did get mail up. Oh.
8858000	8860000	Well then, you know what that means. I play the mail theme.
8860000	8863000	And I talk about every week.
8863000	8865000	Dark Soccer dives in the mail bag.
8865000	8868000	And she pulls out a couple emails that she feels like reading.
8868000	8871000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.
8871000	8874000	And you should send us more because we only got two emails this week.
8874000	8875000	That is sad.
8875000	8879000	That's actually a good thing that we only got two because it's so much easier to open on my iPad that way.
8879000	8881000	That's true. But still.
8881000	8882000	I had a backup.
8882000	8887000	And probably I'm gonna be absent from chat for a while until I get a new laptop.
8887000	8890000	Sorry to hear that. You can always do it on your iPad.
8890000	8894000	Do you know how much of a pain in the ass it is to switch between the screens and monitor chat?
8894000	8896000	And have all this shit running?
8896000	8900000	I could get my laptop out, you know. I do have one. It works, barely, but it works.
8900000	8902000	This is an iPad too and it likes to stink.
8902000	8903000	No.
8903000	8906000	I have an iPad, uh, outdated in two months.
8908000	8910000	At least I still offer, you know, updates for yours.
8910000	8911000	Anyway.
8911000	8912000	Mailbag.
8912000	8913000	At OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8913000	8916000	Dude, learn to spell grammar.
8916000	8917000	Okay.
8917000	8921000	Grammar is spelled G-R-A-M-M-A-R, not E-R.
8921000	8926000	I have to say sorry about the grammar last email, maybe in this one, but one, I agree with Rob.
8926000	8928000	I like Majora's Mask way better.
8928000	8931000	I may have spelled it wrong, but you spelled it right, but you didn't capitalize anything.
8931000	8936000	To be fair, I'm really happy you agree with me, but I think they're kind of both overrated.
8936000	8938000	Sorry, not sorry.
8938000	8944000	Two, I didn't like Skyward Sword is cuz? No, that should be because.
8944000	8947000	I didn't like the art direction. I like Twilight Princess's art style.
8947000	8950000	I also hated how empty the sky world was.
8950000	8954000	Also, how there was only like three different places to explore.
8954000	8957000	Also, my biggest thing I dislike is the motion plus.
8957000	8961000	It worked with Wii Sports Resorts, but not for a Zelda game.
8961000	8963000	That was a whole sentence, by the way.
8964000	8969000	Oh, and that came from, I guess, Chris, somebody. Chris is cool.
8972000	8981000	I think I mentioned in November that I've started watching a lot of video game related videos on YouTube video series.
8981000	8987000	Game Grumps, Continue Show, a lot of things by their friends.
8987000	8991000	I'll watch one-off, two-off, but I'm really subscribed and dedicated to Game Grumps right now.
8992000	9005000	When they were playing the Zelda adventure game in Nintendo Land, they were saying that that whole game's play mechanics is better than the whole of Skyward Sword as far as Wii motion controls are concerned.
9005000	9016000	I say that incidentally because I haven't actually played Skyward Sword, but I did play a bit of the Nintendo Land setup and it was quite fun.
9016000	9023000	It was simple. I don't know how it expands to full screen Zelda, but it just seems fun.
9023000	9026000	Okay, I guess I don't have a point to that spiel. Second email!
9026000	9029000	Second email comes from Raginator.
9046000	9049000	It's usually about random ass stuff related to physics.
9049000	9058000	Well, all of that being said, I had an epiphany not too long ago related to physics, specifically about dark matter, and I'd like to write a thesis on it.
9058000	9065000	However, I do have one hurdle to overcome. My math skills are not advanced enough to write the paper. I never took calculus.
9065000	9069000	That was your first typo. Congratulations, your grammar has been astounding.
9069000	9072000	He missed one of the E's in never. He spelled N-V-E-R.
9072000	9075000	Sorry, I thought the email needed Warholic.
9076000	9084000	Oh, and thoughts. Here's the next one. My thought here is to perhaps collaborate with someone in a university that has a working knowledge of physics and calculus.
9084000	9091000	Now my questions for you are as follows. Does this route sound feasible to you and how would I go about this?
9091000	9095000	I'm sure I can't very well just waltz in and say, hey, want to do a thesis with me?
9095000	9103000	If my epiphany that I had works out as well as I think it will, it could be very well groundbreaking.
9103000	9108000	Craigslist. Seriously?
9108000	9111000	Sorry, one more time the question. Sorry, I got distracted.
9111000	9118000	Okay, he has an idea about writing a thesis, which I think your thesis is more what your idea would be.
9118000	9123000	It would be the paper that you're trying to write about dark matter.
9123000	9132000	I think that without knowing all of the mathematics and the science behind it, you're probably not in the best position.
9132000	9137000	I would say start doing interviews. Call heads of, call deans of physics departments.
9137000	9142000	Call various schools that are in your area and make an appointment to speak with people and ask them about it.
9142000	9148000	Take a class here and there. Community colleges offer physics courses and talk to your teacher after class.
9148000	9154000	If it's something that you're truly interested in doing, especially since you have tons of free time on your hand, fuck.
9155000	9156000	Go to school.
9156000	9163000	See if it's something that maybe, you know, this isn't always a great substitute, but iTunes U has a lot of really interesting and diverse offerings out there.
9163000	9165000	Oh, there are tons of physics podcasts.
9165000	9169000	Take a peek. Yeah. Physics podcast. Great, great suggestion.
9169000	9175000	Yeah, I've even listened to a few of them because they were actually interesting podcasts that combined physics with religion.
9175000	9180000	You can find them just as easily as you found this crap.
9180000	9183000	They might fester a little less. Done.
9183000	9188000	Good, good feedback to our soccer. Good job. Despite your computer issues of the email back tonight, I must say.
9188000	9192000	Hey, I'm trying. That's why I got this thing. It just doesn't work for running everything.
9192000	9196000	All right. Let's jam through these couple last stories here and we'll get to the Skype line at one eight seven seven game.
9196000	9199000	Oh, well, are not yet. Don't call yet, but we'll let you know.
9199000	9206000	Loki. All right. So there was another tablet that was shown, you know, kind of a big gaming tablet.
9206000	9211000	It was the razor project Fiona thing, which is now called Razor's Edge.
9211000	9220000	If you may remember, that is the one that has the two like kind of nunchuck looking things that are attached to it or across with the nunchuck in the PlayStation move.
9220000	9223000	It's got these like analog handle things, but now it is available.
9223000	9236000	Actually, I should say it's available without that for thousand dollars for the base model, the I five one or twelve hundred or thirteen hundred dollars for the pro model, which is a core I seven.
9236000	9240000	But this is a tablet actually runs PC stuff. It's got Windows eight on it.
9240000	9246000	It's got, you know, a gaming card in it. In fact, actually, it's got a pretty high end Nvidia card in there.
9246000	9255000	It's kind of a surprise about that, which I kind of brought up the point that so does this thing run as hot as like the surface of the sun?
9255000	9266000	Because if it's got like, you know, some mobile 640 processor or something like that, I have no kind of clue how this thing would run.
9266000	9275000	Cool. Fuck my laptop. I do all sorts of cooling mods to get the run somewhat cool and it still runs hot.
9275000	9280000	I don't know. It's interesting. If you're interested, though, they are, I think, taking preorders for it.
9280000	9285000	And I don't think they've announced a date when it's going to be available. But oh, I'm sorry.
9285000	9299000	The base model is available now, but the pro models coming later and they're saying that the thirteen hundred dollar one can run dishonored at 60 frames per second,
9299000	9303000	which I don't think that's that processor intensive of a game.
9303000	9309000	So it's I don't know, but it's an option, I guess, if you really want to spend that kind of money.
9309000	9316000	Honestly, though, if you're going to spend thirteen hundred dollars on something, you'll probably get a laptop that's just as nice for a lot cheaper.
9316000	9322000	Just saying you don't need a tablet for everything or you can actually I actually was looking.
9322000	9327000	You can make your own tablet be fun. But will the tablet play this game?
9327000	9332000	I'm about to talk about I guess it will. I'll say an Android, but it doesn't run Android.
9333000	9336000	Never mind. But you could run it anywhere. OK, like compatibility or something. All right.
9336000	9340000	Anyhow, regardless, this is a game that was due to come out last week.
9340000	9345000	I guess people have been demanding this. I didn't know there was a market, but OK.
9345000	9352000	It's the spiritual successor to the game Shaq Fu. Yes, Shaq Fu. You heard me, Shaq. Like Shaquille O'Neal?
9352000	9357000	Yeah. Shaq Down, a 2D side scrolling action game.
9357000	9363000	It actually does star Shaq or Shaquille O'Neal, of course, came out for iOS and Android.
9363000	9368000	In the game, you battle zombies across three stages and bosses and all that stuff.
9368000	9372000	It was developed by Hiptic Games and published by One Spear Entertainment.
9372000	9375000	Shaquille O'Neal is a major shareholder in One Spear Entertainment.
9375000	9381000	So there you go. ShaqDown.com for more information, because I know you're all waiting for it.
9381000	9385000	Three stages, man. Don't like, you know, overwork yourselves.
9385000	9390000	I mean, that's just like a lot of content. That's so they can sell you stages four and five later.
9390000	9395000	Why? Fuck that. That's how it works now. That's what that's what users want, Loki.
9395000	9399000	Haven't you heard? That's what everybody said. That's what the users want.
9399000	9406000	More Shaq games? I don't think that's what they say. Although they do have, you know, is it Shaq Fu?
9406000	9410000	Was it, um, the, uh, the Skype line is open one eight seven seven game.
9411000	9414000	Or a user name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio. Sorry, Loki.
9414000	9418000	They have that Shaq Fu with the Gaiden one, you know. Nice.
9418000	9425000	And then the sequel to that. So one of those stupid long name Shaq Fu, the something ultimate Grand Alpha Z Gaiden.
9425000	9430000	VidPower in our chat room. Shaq Fu Gaiden was awesome.
9430000	9435000	I never thought I'd see Shaq Fu and awesome in the same sentence, but there you go. It has its fans.
9436000	9441000	What can you say? Uh, Twitter topics. I'll try to fill in with a few of those. Twitter dot com slash o l r.
9441000	9446000	We got a few topics that we either talked about earlier in the show or last week. Like I see one from Flocko.
9446000	9450000	We hit that during Rapid Fire News. One from SSJ100 Matt that we hit last week.
9450000	9454000	Oh, we have a phone call coming in. So I'll go back to Twitter topics in a minute.
9454000	9457000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9457000	9461000	Hey, this is VidPower. Hey, VidPower. How you doing?
9461000	9465000	Good. Good. How are you today? I'm all right. Thanks for asking. What's on your mind, buddy?
9465000	9470000	I just want to call in about and talk about CES. Did you go?
9470000	9473000	I did. I did. That's right. You're in Vegas. It's in your backyard.
9473000	9478000	It is. It is. It's really easy to get there and then have to put up with traffic.
9478000	9483000	Now, Bobby on his show calls this the Consumer Electronics Show, which is not open to consumers.
9483000	9488000	But you what you snuck into the back door or you work somewhere that got you in or what?
9488000	9493000	I kind of snuck in. I snuck in every year.
9493000	9500000	Fair enough. Wow, this is like the renegade report on the Consumer Electronics Show.
9500000	9505000	See, VoG can't afford to send anybody, so we just have people sneak in.
9505000	9509000	I'm just kidding. This wasn't endorsed by VoG. All right.
9509000	9511000	VidPower, tell us about what you saw at CES.
9511000	9516000	Yeah, well, you know, since Microsoft wasn't there at CES this year,
9516000	9522000	the amount of video games are pretty, well, CES isn't really known for video games anyway.
9522000	9527000	But like this year, there were just like a small handful of games that were showing off.
9527000	9533000	So not much. The big games were over at Sony's booth.
9533000	9538000	God of War Ascension that were showing off was probably like the main big thing.
9538000	9547000	But they had a bunch of other demos, like the new Sly Cooper game was there.
9547000	9551000	They had that Book of Spells game that they were demoing.
9551000	9556000	Did you get to see 120-inch television sets that just made everything look, oh, my God?
9556000	9566000	Yeah, yeah, I did. I did see one of those new 4K television sets with the crazy huge clear resolution.
9566000	9568000	Do we need that?
9568000	9573000	No, you don't. But it's pretty cool looking at it.
9573000	9578000	I was at Fry's just last night with Alan very randomly. We were just over there kind of killing time.
9578000	9583000	And we were looking at some of their really nice TVs. And like the new TVs, they're not even 4Ks.
9583000	9586000	They're just like the HDTVs, but like the newer type of plasma or whatever.
9586000	9589000	And they were showing on Blu-ray. Speed Racer was on one of them.
9589000	9595000	And it was so like it just looked fake. And I realized like Speed Racer wasn't exactly, you know, real to begin with.
9595000	9599000	Like you can tell that shit was done on a computer.
9599000	9601000	Same thing with the Avengers was showing on another one of the TVs.
9601000	9606000	And I was like, you can really see like, you can really tell computer versus real.
9606000	9614000	This is like jaw-dropping how like the ultra precision of it all almost ruins the movie magic a little bit.
9614000	9623000	It does. It does. Sometimes it looks a little like too, a bit fake with all that computer that they put in there.
9624000	9628000	Yeah, yeah. Sometimes it does look a bit fake.
9628000	9636000	But yeah, you know, they had a display of a Blu-ray playing on a TV next to one of these 4K televisions.
9636000	9641000	And I guess if you compare the two, you can kind of see a clearer resolution.
9641000	9645000	But like the average person probably couldn't see.
9645000	9647000	Couldn't tell at all. It's just too much.
9647000	9648000	Yeah, couldn't tell.
9648000	9652000	4K is made to show like 48 frames a second The Hobbit. And I don't know if everybody's ready for that.
9653000	9659000	Now I know you've been listening since the music gaming days. Did you see the classroom DDR thing?
9659000	9663000	I did. I did see DDR classroom edition.
9663000	9664000	Did you check it out?
9664000	9671000	I did. I did. So they had a demo on, it was a pretty like giant screen.
9671000	9678000	And it had like seven of these wireless pads all set up for just random people to come play on it.
9678000	9686000	And I, you know, being an old school DDR person, I went up and I tested out this pad.
9686000	9692000	It's surprisingly good. It didn't slip at all.
9692000	9698000	I don't know if they put anything under the pad or what, but like I was just doing like the expert level steps.
9698000	9699000	Yeah.
9699000	9705000	And yeah, it didn't slip at all. It definitely had the problem that most soft pads had.
9705000	9712000	You know, you can't really feel the position of the arrow. So, you know, you're always like a bit off center.
9712000	9715000	You're playing on it. But it was surprisingly good.
9715000	9724000	Good, like just kind of like a throwback to the old school, like red octane ignition 2.0 pads.
9724000	9729000	Was the music in it all old school or was it kind of mixed with like contemporary stuff?
9729000	9736000	Like, you know, you know what? There were like pretty much it was all like licensed like American music.
9736000	9742000	So there were like no like, you know, Konami originals or, you know, Japanese stuff.
9742000	9745000	So it was just like it was really Americanized.
9745000	9747000	No butterfly?
9747000	9751000	Yeah, no, no butterfly. No butterfly.
9751000	9756000	How am I supposed to show everybody in my PE class my patented Kyle Snyder spin?
9757000	9761000	Oh, yeah. I was like, oh, OK.
9761000	9765000	I think we saw that Uber song was like, yeah, like I have like a ton of everything.
9765000	9770000	Anyway, I guess they'll have to stick with like Lady Gaga and Rihanna or whatever.
9770000	9773000	Awesome. Well, it sounds like you had a good time at CES.
9773000	9779000	So since you are a consumer who somehow got into Consumer Electronics Show and it is about trying to get you to buy something.
9779000	9783000	Is there anything you walked out of the show going, I might buy that?
9784000	9788000	Not really. CES is more really.
9788000	9791000	What a successful expo.
9791000	9800000	CES is really more about like technology that like to have like in the back of your mind.
9800000	9804000	But a lot of it's like not ready for consumers yet.
9804000	9808000	You know, most likely in the price, price level of all this stuff.
9808000	9812000	Yeah, it's for CES is for rich people, not the people who have to sneak in.
9812000	9820000	E3, just like E3 is technically supposed to be for a lot of shops to be able to pick up, pick up publishers, CES is meant.
9820000	9826000	These are the technologies that you can offer to consumers and you get bits and pieces of it are good ideas, but it's not.
9826000	9831000	It's technology for consumers, not Best Buy convention extreme.
9832000	9836000	Pretty much. Yeah, that's a really accurate statement.
9836000	9843000	It's more, it's more of like technology that's like ready for consumer in like three to four years from now.
9843000	9847000	All right. Well, VidPower, I should probably let you go to try and get another call here before the night's over.
9847000	9849000	But thanks for the report from CES.
9849000	9851000	No problem, no problem. Anytime.
9851000	9853000	All right. You take care, buddy. Have a great week.
9853000	9854000	Later.
9854000	9855000	All right. Bye.
9855000	9860000	It's nice to hear from VidPower. I haven't heard from him in a while, even though I want to know more about how he got in.
9860000	9862000	That sounds a little sneaky there.
9862000	9870000	All right. Excuse me while we wait for more calls at 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9870000	9876000	Again, some Twitter topics out here. Tiger Claw on Twitter sending us a tweet to a story.
9876000	9877000	Yes, I heard about this.
9877000	9880000	It's not really gaming per se, but it's just kind of lolsy.
9880000	9887000	You know, there's that site where you can do a petition to the White House and if it gets so many signatures, they like have to respond to it or whatever.
9887000	9891000	Well, there was that whole petition to build a Death Star.
9891000	9894000	The White House replied this week and said no.
9894000	9898000	But I thought it was a very clever answer because it talked about we can't afford that kind of debt.
9898000	9901000	And this administration does not support blowing up other planets.
9901000	9903000	That was my favorite response.
9903000	9904000	That was great.
9904000	9906000	It was great. An amazing response.
9906000	9909000	All right. Let's go to the phones and take another call.
9909000	9911000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9911000	9913000	Hey, guys. This is Degenera Johnny.
9913000	9914000	Hey.
9914000	9915000	How are you guys doing?
9915000	9916000	Degenera Johnny. What's on your mind, buddy?
9917000	9919000	Not much. Can't complain.
9919000	9926000	Well, actually, I do have a complaint to Brad from Pod Culture for getting me addicted to that fireball whiskey.
9931000	9932000	It's very cinnamon.
9932000	9935000	The influence of vog is spreading. I love it.
9935000	9937000	That just makes me shudder. Yuck.
9938000	9939000	Amazing.
9939000	9944000	Well, sadly, Brad from Pod Culture told me he wasn't listening live tonight, but hopefully he'll catch up on the podcast.
9944000	9946000	A good old hearty F.U.
9946000	9948000	Yeah. Oh, it's all good.
9948000	9951000	As a matter of fact, I'm using it for the Orange Lounge Radio drinking game.
9954000	9955000	So, what else do you mind, buddy?
9957000	9965000	Basically, well, I wanted to touch up on the whole video game violence thing.
9966000	9977000	I'm a little afraid right now of the timing of this because I'm playing Dead Space 1 and 2 in preparation for Dead Space 3.
9977000	9992000	And my problem is that, aside from Devil May Cry, this is one of the AAA titles that's coming out since the shooting.
9992000	10005000	And Visceral Games has a tendency of pushing the envelope of putting certain adversaries in their games, namely babies and children.
10005000	10010000	If you looked at their past three games, Dante's Inferno, Dead Space, and Dead Space 2.
10011000	10026000	And so my problem is, I'm a little scared about this, is if they decide to do that again in Dead Space 3, would we see more irate type of backlash?
10027000	10046000	We haven't really received it beforehand, but in light of the shooting, this might come up and say Visceral, it puts in the six-year-old or seven-year-old pack hunters in the game, or the exploding babies.
10046000	10052000	I'm just a little afraid that there might be a little backlash if they decide to do that.
10052000	10062000	Yeah, I hear what you're saying, and I agree with you to a point that it's like, now would be a great time to just show a little restraint, but at the same time, somebody's gonna push the envelope.
10062000	10069000	And if it's not these guys, then guess what'll end up on Fox News eventually? It'll be that game that the guys made about Columbine or whatever.
10069000	10078000	The controversial thing that came out some time ago. There's always gonna be somebody pushing the envelope, but at the same time, that's what the First Amendment is for.
10078000	10093000	And I think I've heard this argument before, is that we might want to put all these restrictions, but what lengths are we willing to go to sacrifice the First Amendment to spare all these others, or what have you?
10093000	10100000	Drama's gonna unfold as a result of this, but it's not gonna be any different than what we've been dealing with for the past decade.
10100000	10113000	I sort of have a feeling, I don't know, the cynic in me sort of thinks you are gonna start to see some type of legislation about violent video games, very similar to how you have motion pictures.
10113000	10124000	You know, in reality, they would just mirror the frickin' motion picture thing. You know, no one under 17 admitted without parent or guardian or whatever, but then again, the Motion Picture Association needs to be reformed.
10124000	10139000	Now would be a great time to examine all of that, because the MPAA is kind of shit, and the way they look at things, and that violent movies can be, you know, rated R, no problem, and kids can get in, but show a penis, and oh my god, not safe for anybody, right?
10139000	10153000	It's like this weird, weird, you know, kind of bullshit. So now would be a great time to evaluate all of that, but I think it's inevitable. You're gonna see some type of parental controls on this, where there's gonna be certain type of games you don't buy without a driver's license.
10153000	10169000	I just, or some type of identification, I just think that is inevitable, but it's also a little bit naive, because with the internet, you can get anything. You know, how you gonna regulate an M-rated game on the internet? It's gonna be a lot harder.
10169000	10176000	So, and since we're all going towards digital distribution, that's kind of the reality. Movies are going that way too.
10177000	10196000	Marissa Congusto in chat says, most likely there will be a threat of legislation, and the industry will censor itself. I'm totally with you there, Marissa, but that kind of already happened in the mid-90s. That's how we have the video game rating system we have now, was the first time we went through all this crap in the mid-90s, and that was when the record industry did the whole, you know, explicit lyrics thing, and all of that.
10196000	10198000	And Walmart stopped carrying them.
10198000	10200000	All of that happened, so.
10200000	10214000	And the way I interpret what Biden was saying is that I think he acknowledges that the ESRB is by far far more responsible than the MPAA.
10214000	10228000	I think it's like basically hinting to everybody, just, you know what, let it be general knowledge. You know, you guys are better than the MPAA, you guys are far more superior, more accountable, more responsible, definitely.
10228000	10244000	I mean, just pick up a DVD and compare it to a video game and, you know, you'll have a hard time looking for a rating of the movie, much versus, you know, on the game where it's both on the front and the back, and it actually tells you, you know, in big bold letters, why it's rated at.
10244000	10253000	That is an amazing amount of credit to give to Vice President Biden, I hope you're right, to hold up the ESRB as, this is what movies should be doing.
10253000	10264000	That is quite the, you know what, I gotta say though, I wish, because the MPAA really, they need to look at that hard, hard they need to look at that.
10264000	10283000	It blows my mind, literally blows my mind how a movie like Saw 7 or any of those movies gets an R rating, but the movie Shameless that showed, you know, that guy from X-Men, it showed his little, you know, well, not little, but, you know, showed his wiener in that movie and all that.
10283000	10284000	Showed his little X.
10284000	10286000	Yeah, his little X or whatever.
10286000	10287000	Little Jimmy.
10287000	10291000	That was NC-17, because heaven forbid people have sex.
10292000	10294000	Heaven forbid people have penises.
10294000	10304000	But decapitations and people setting on fire and eyes sewn shut and all that crazy shit the Saw movies show, no problem, no problem.
10304000	10307000	That, okay, there's a big problem here.
10307000	10308000	Big problem.
10308000	10310000	I would rather see fucking than blood.
10310000	10311000	Just saying.
10311000	10312000	Me too.
10312000	10313000	Who wouldn't?
10313000	10314000	I knew.
10314000	10316000	What sick fucker wants to see blood?
10316000	10318000	I realize there's a whole like horror movie.
10318000	10321000	Now, I do have a friend who's completely into the human centipede, so.
10321000	10322000	Oh, God.
10322000	10323000	Awesome.
10323000	10331000	I should recognize that horror movie has its own subculture, but at least they all kind of admit it's a weird thing.
10331000	10336000	Like most horror movie fans I know go, yeah, it's gross, but that's what I love about it is it's so cheesy.
10336000	10338000	I'm like, all right, at least you know where it is.
10338000	10340000	I showed her the toddler pee and she cracked up.
10342000	10344000	I love TV ratings.
10344000	10348000	Gaming ratings and TV ratings both have the general level.
10348000	10356000	And then they point out these subcategories, you know, crude language, comic mischief, and up to the suggestive situations and so on and so forth.
10356000	10357000	And those are good.
10357000	10360000	They're expanded classifications that make a lot of sense.
10360000	10362000	And movies don't.
10362000	10368000	GameGuru in chat says about my comment about what's going to happen nationwide says, I don't think so.
10368000	10373000	California tried that and the Supreme Court shot it down by saying video games are protected speech.
10373000	10374000	There was more to it.
10374000	10380000	I don't remember all the details, but I want to say it was going to bust the employees and all this other stuff that didn't make sense.
10380000	10385000	And the fact that I think mature gaming's like couldn't be on the shelves or had to have some type.
10385000	10387000	Basically, they were going to treat the violent video games like porn.
10387000	10394000	That was the problem is the labels they were giving to that and so forth was the problem.
10394000	10397000	And that there is really no like there was no cut and dry.
10397000	10399000	What makes a violent game?
10399000	10403000	You know, there was it was going to be it wasn't they weren't trusting the ESRB to do it.
10403000	10404000	That's the problem.
10404000	10415000	But for them to step in and say, OK, the ESRB can get away with the same stuff the MPAA can or we're going to form a government agency that's basically the ESRB all over again or whatever.
10415000	10419000	I don't think that necessarily is out of the realm of possibility.
10419000	10422000	And I think that could be something that happens.
10422000	10436000	I think it might I think that's the whole point of Rockefeller's bill that he's trying to introduce is like to evaluate video games in a certain light to see if there's legislation that's necessary.
10436000	10442000	Otherwise, you know, then we'll let be what it is.
10442000	10443000	Exactly. All right.
10443000	10447000	DeGeneres, Johnny, I got to let you go so we wrap up the show, but thanks so much for your call, buddy.
10447000	10448000	No problem.
10448000	10449000	You guys have a great day.
10449000	10451000	You too. Take care.
10451000	10453000	That is going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
10453000	10455000	I am very sorry to those that didn't get through.
10455000	10457000	I know usually I try to take one or two more calls.
10457000	10459000	I need to wrap up the show in the next few minutes here.
10459000	10463000	So I'm going to kind of start to wind things down.
10463000	10465000	I want to close out the Twitter topics, though.
10465000	10466000	Twitter dot com slash O.L.R.
10466000	10478000	There was one other tweet here I wanted to read from act deft who sent a story to a story about the PlayStation three has likely outsold the Xbox 360.
10479000	10480000	What?
10480000	10482000	Oh, maybe maybe worldwide.
10482000	10485000	I believe it worldwide because Japan, you know, worldwide tilted.
10485000	10487000	Is that what it is about worldwide?
10487000	10493000	Yeah. So worldwide, it looks like the PlayStation three has outsold the Xbox 360.
10493000	10495000	This will be great news to Sony fans everywhere.
10495000	10501000	But really, guys, just, you know, all the play what you like and enjoy it.
10501000	10502000	Exactly.
10502000	10504000	System is only as good as the games are on it.
10504000	10505000	But you know what?
10505000	10507000	I will say this much.
10507000	10512000	We all gave the PlayStation three tons of shit when it first came out and it deserved it.
10512000	10515000	But they've really turned it around in many ways.
10515000	10517000	And this is the reward that they get to reap for that.
10517000	10518000	Congratulations.
10518000	10520000	Now, can you do something about the Vita?
10520000	10522000	Yeah, seriously.
10522000	10524000	Please land on that note.
10524000	10525000	All right.
10525000	10527000	That was it for the Twitter topics tonight.
10527000	10528000	Rapid fire news.
10528000	10531000	I don't think there was anything left in the show, but maybe if you got any sorry.
10531000	10532000	Last minute story.
10532000	10533000	Cox on fire.
10533000	10534000	What?
10534000	10535000	Read the chat.
10535000	10536000	All right.
10536000	10537000	Fair enough.
10537000	10539000	All right.
10539000	10540000	That's it.
10540000	10542000	We're going to wrap up the show and head on out here for the night.
10542000	10549000	But not before we go around to get everybody's final thoughts and a chance for me to say, of course, as always, support independent podcasting.
10549000	10553000	You know, even if you thought this show was shit, go download another independent.
10553000	10556000	First off, if you thought it was bad, I'm surprised you made it this far.
10556000	10563000	If you thought it was bad, send us feedback, constructive criticism and tell us what you thought didn't work instead of being an asshole.
10563000	10566000	Mailbag at Orange Laundry dot com Facebook dot com.
10566000	10568000	Orange Laundry do at O.L.R. on Twitter.
10568000	10570000	Let me let me give you an example of bad feedback.
10570000	10575000	Bad feedback would be Rob is a bitch or bad feedback would be Loki screams too much.
10575000	10576000	Bitch.
10576000	10581000	Good feedback would be the audio levels need to be looked at because sometimes Loki gets a little louder.
10581000	10582000	That's fair feedback.
10582000	10587000	Or, you know, Rob should not talk so much when he's talking about that.
10587000	10588000	That or whatever.
10588000	10589000	Or send us good feedback.
10589000	10590000	We appreciate both kinds.
10590000	10592000	We appreciate Jamie for everything that she.
10592000	10598000	We love her and you don't have anything nice to pay her to do.
10598000	10600000	Mailbag at Orange Laundry dot com.
10600000	10607000	Or if the feedback is good, consider leaving a five star review on iTunes and help spread the word.
10607000	10610000	You know, the other shows spread like a disease.
10610000	10613000	There's a lot of gaming podcasts out there, a ton.
10613000	10619000	But unfortunately, a lot of the ones that get all the attention from places like iTunes and so forth.
10619000	10626000	Not all, but a lot are things that would be getting your attention anyway, because there are parts of million dollar websites.
10626000	10632000	And, you know, they poop out podcasts every other day because they have the resources to do it.
10632000	10636000	But I really encourage you check out the shows that independent producers are doing.
10636000	10639000	I brought up gamertag radio earlier in the show.
10639000	10643000	I'm going to, of course, plug VOD because all the hardworking independent folks that are out there.
10643000	10645000	Lots of great shows on the network.
10645000	10647000	We used to be on video game outsiders.
10647000	10650000	I still try to try to listen to as much as I can.
10650000	10653000	Loki and I were both on Down for Maintenance, a startup show.
10653000	10656000	My buddies got Game Buoy, another great indie show.
10656000	10661000	So just just support those that do this for the love of podcasting.
10661000	10664000	Jason needs his own show because he's got a sexy voice.
10664000	10666000	He does. He really does.
10666000	10667000	I hope that happens soon.
10667000	10671000	You need to have a very smooth R&B intro as well.
10671000	10676000	You know what? We need to be like the kudzu of the podcasting world where we spread over everything.
10676000	10678000	And are high in iron.
10678000	10683000	Anyhow, please tell a friend or two about the show because we don't have a lot of advertising dollars for any of that stuff.
10683000	10687000	Like us on Facebook and all that stuff. It really helps.
10687000	10691000	Anyway, I really want to thank our guests for being here, coming out all the way from Colorado.
10691000	10695000	I know it wasn't just us, the reason why you came out, but we still appreciate you.
10695000	10697000	You still have to drive here from San Francisco, which is no small task.
10697000	10698000	Always a great part of it.
10698000	10699000	So we really appreciate it.
10699000	10702000	Thank you, Jason, for being on the show tonight.
10702000	10704000	Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10704000	10706000	If you don't hear from me in August, send help.
10706000	10712000	Okay. And Rai, good luck with pushing it to Paragon 100. We're all rooting for you.
10712000	10715000	Well, the next patch will definitely help.
10715000	10716000	Alright, that'll be good.
10716000	10718000	Five hundred percent experience! Yes!
10718000	10723000	Yes! I will not be playing MP10. I don't care. Five hundred and ten percent.
10723000	10726000	I don't care. I will not be doing MP10.
10726000	10729000	Any final thoughts for our listeners, Rai?
10730000	10735000	I'm glad that I'm finally coming out of a shell a little bit more, talking a little bit more than I was last time.
10735000	10738000	Helps to have my own microphone and not be sharing with Rob.
10738000	10739000	There you go.
10739000	10741000	He never lets go of his, Mike.
10741000	10742000	Thank you to Brad.
10742000	10744000	Love you, Brad.
10744000	10745000	Thank you!
10745000	10748000	So let's go around and talk to our hosts.
10748000	10751000	Dark Soccer, you got your scarf on. You're ready to go. What's your final thought?
10751000	10754000	I just wanted to put my scarf on. You need to stop judging me.
10754000	10756000	Thanks for the chocolate and the coffee.
10756000	10757000	You're welcome anytime.
10757000	10758000	That's my thought.
10758000	10760000	Alright, and my final thought...
10760000	10761000	So long and thanks for the fish.
10761000	10764000	My final thought tonight is...
10766000	10767000	I don't know.
10767000	10768000	Loki, your final...
10768000	10770000	You love the sound of your own voice.
10770000	10771000	Yes.
10771000	10773000	Four score in seventy years... No.
10773000	10775000	Loki, what's your final thought tonight?
10775000	10779000	I guess I'll play some different games this week.
10779000	10783000	I was already loading up Giana Sisters to try that since I have it on Steam.
10784000	10792000	Maybe I'll finish the VoG Minecraft website and play Minecraft.
10792000	10793000	I don't know.
10793000	10794000	I got a lot of stuff I want to do.
10794000	10797000	And I have a bunch of random computer parts that I took from...
10797000	10803000	Well, not took from work, but I had stored at work in my garage that I want to build something out of.
10803000	10804000	I don't really know what.
10804000	10807000	But, man, I have so many random computer parts.
10807000	10809000	It's like I keep finding stuff. It's ridiculous.
10809000	10811000	I don't know what to make out of it.
10811000	10817000	You should make one of those little mini boxes that put it in something that no one would expect to see it in.
10817000	10819000	Like build it out of a fake loader box or something.
10819000	10822000	Well, originally I had parts for...
10822000	10826000	I was building an arcade cabinet inside one of...
10826000	10829000	It's like a tiny...
10829000	10832000	What was it? Like the old LCD Frogger games.
10832000	10835000	Like the really small cabinet ones.
10835000	10838000	Although it doesn't fit without dremeling some stuff out.
10838000	10844000	So I have a Pico ITX... I think it's Pico ITX board.
10844000	10850000	And then I've got a ton of arcade boards and all sorts of crazy shit.
10850000	10854000	You should actually build the ultimate jamma cabinet and call it the bad mamma jamma.
10854000	10855000	Bad mamma jamma.
10855000	10857000	I think someone's done that.
10857000	10860000	All right. That does it.
10860000	10865000	Oh, ActDeft wants me to tell you, you have been added to the VOG club on Forza Horizon.
10865000	10866000	Woo!
10866000	10867000	And we have to play this week.
10868000	10871000	Oh, you can't be any worse than me, Matt. Don't worry about it.
10871000	10874000	Nah. You should have seen me driving.
10874000	10876000	Battle for last place.
10876000	10878000	Fist bump. All right.
10878000	10880000	That's it. We're done. Another show in the can.
10880000	10882000	We'll be back next week to do it all over again.
10882000	10884000	Have a wonderful week and be nice to each other.
10884000	10886000	And I don't know what else to say.
10886000	10888000	So I'll play the ending music.
