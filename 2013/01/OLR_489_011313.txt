Tonight, January 13, 2013, a new gaming handheld debuts at CES, Pokemon X and Y is announced, and further details emerge on the Steam Box.
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 489 for this January the 13th of 2013.
I'm sure there's like a numberology thing in there, a numerology thing in there, because all I ever see on the Twitters is like, happy 1212 or happy 1313, and everybody's looking for the number Zs.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
All right.
My name, by the way, is Rob Roberts, of course.
We are joined by all of you in our chat room.
Live, as we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern on Sundays right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
And a big thank you to everybody at the Voice of Geeks Network and all you listening live in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com for tuning in tonight.
We'll be talking about games and CES and all that fun stuff here in a little bit.
But of course, we have to introduce the third host on our program.
Say hello to Tech Master, Loki.
Hi.
How are you, Loki?
I'm fine.
So, a trip to Disneyland may be in your future, based on what we were talking about before the show.
Well, not that I want to go, but my wife wants to.
How can you not want to go to Disneyland?
How about she go with me and Dan?
There you go.
I'm fine with that.
No, honestly, I'm seriously fine with that.
I told her that she could go with other people, but, you know, she wants to go to Disneyland, and I, personally, I don't want to go to Disneyland, just because I don't really...
most of the times I go I have like this anxiety about going on roller coasters although one time I got over that and then it came back so I don't understand it like one time I really loved roller coasters what is with the like macho men I know in my life and they're like they're they're polarizing fear of roller coasters no it's it's a weird irrational thing it's not that like I think anything's gonna happen it's just my body reacts to it like that and even stupid shit like
Thanks for watching!
What happens when the wife says you need to go on California Screamin'?
What are you afraid is going to happen?
Do you cry?
No, I don't cry.
I don't want to go.
It's like I can't take the adrenaline rush or something.
It's really weird.
I don't know.
The only thing that gets me on screaming is that first hill, and then I'm fine.
It's not even like... It's Neil Patrick Harris' soothing voice that helps me out every time.
I know that nothing is going to happen to me or anything.
It's not like I'm afraid that the roller coaster is going to fall off the tracks or something like that.
I know nothing is going to happen to me.
I know I'm perfectly safe in there.
It's just for some reason that I can't do it.
And there's one time I went.
It was one of the last times I went with my family, and...
We actually, it was kind of like that, and I was just like, oh, I don't want to do this, and we went on Thunder Mountain Railroad, and I was like, that wasn't so bad, and we kept going on it over and over and over again.
It was actually before, like, it was before, you know, we killed the people on there, but...
Um, but, you know, it was it was actually pretty fun.
Let's not talk about that, okay?
Big Thunder is awesome if you go at night and sit in the back.
No, it was pretty fun.
I mean, and I thought, okay, cool.
You know, I was pretty comfortable with it last time.
You know, this should be no big deal this time.
So, you know, went there again and, you know, last time we went, and I was like, why am I afraid of this stuff again?
I don't understand.
This doesn't make any sense, but whatever.
It's not that you think you're gonna die on the ride.
No, it's just like it's not even that I feel like I'm gonna get sick.
It's just I have this, like, it's almost like a
Josh, Josh, Josh, Josh
Not even besides the rollercoaster stuff because I'm fine with just sitting out while she goes on rollercoasters and that kind of thing and just going on parts of the Caribbean and that kind of crap.
But I don't want to take Josh on a plane because that is going to be a pain in the ass.
Why the hell would you fly anyway?
You could drive.
The drive is easy.
We're not going to drive because she has to go to the bathroom all the time.
Well, so do I. Dan puts up with it.
I'm fine with that.
I'm fine with stopping a million times, but
I don't know.
And then I also have to harass him for coffee.
and I got to actually ask a question it was supposed to be on TV now it got cut but it's like a deleted scene you can see online and yes that's me in it if you if you google it on Logos site or whatever you can see the RuPaul's Drag Race season 4 deleted scene and I'm the first guy that asked a question well I was so nervous before that I literally thought I was gonna barf and I had to go to the bathroom right before that happened in fact I like asked one of the handlers I'm like I gotta go to the bathroom before it was like and like I could feel like my heart beating but then all of a sudden when it's like cameras on I'm just like I'll bet her
and I just, like, it just... I think that the only thing that will get me over going on roller coasters is just going on roller coasters.
That's really, you know, the only thing you can do.
Showtime is nothing for you, Rob.
He said to sensitize yourself to it.
Let me introduce that phantom voice you just heard who hadn't been introduced.
They're gonna think, like, who the hell was that guy?
That disconnected, deep radio voice.
Well, you hopefully will recognize that disconnected, deep voice as a voice you hear in the intro to the show every night.
Or the pre-intro, if you will.
Say hello, everybody, to Jason, or VXJasonXVYZ.
It's me, again.
I've been doing this for almost a year, and that's crazy to me to think about.
Here you are, visiting yet again from Colorado.
Yet again.
But it helps that you come out to San Francisco a lot for work, and we happen to be on the way.
And then drive two hours and kill the better part of my Sunday.
But hey, it's all for a good cause, so no complaints here.
Are we allowed to talk about your job here on the show?
Yeah, when I had you talk about the game off.
I can't remember because sometimes we get people in here who are in the game industry so we can't say where they work.
No, we all know about him.
But it's the big N, Rob!
But anyway, you work at GitHub.
I do.
So you guys have your Git-togethers in San Francisco, right?
I wonder if that came up as a possible name for these big collections.
They bring the whole company because, you know, Git together.
I'll give you that one on the house.
We appreciate that.
I'll run it by legal.
Make sure that it's still free.
GitHub brings everybody in for twice yearly summits, January and August.
And so I've been out there.
I've been out here, you know, the first time was when I started working here.
The second time was the summit in August.
We had a little get together in November for my team specifically.
And now this is the second summit that I've been a part of with a company.
It's the company's fifth, I believe.
And it's my second.
And it starts tomorrow.
And I'm kind of excited.
Now, real quick, I sort of have a vague idea what GitHub is, but I kind of feel like I'm not nerdy enough to get GitHub.
So what is GitHub, and where could a beginner nerd like me, what could I profit from visiting GitHub and making it a part of my daily routine?
Oh man, you threw me a curveball.
So the point of GitHub is to foster collaboration and development.
The point is to make it easy to collaborate with fellow programmers, fellow developers, designers, what have you, and get things done mutually beneficially.
Our slogan is something close to making collaborative development easier than... I already screwed it up.
Collaborative development easier than by yourself.
Very much the open source movement, but development in large part is better with multiple people, period.
You yourself personally, I'm not sure that I have a specific use case for.
I mean, we're branching out into documentation.
One of the more interesting stories about GitHub last year was Obama for America had their whole back-end system, their CMS and everything on GitHub.
and they were actually doing a tour so they dropped by the office they were pretty cool people like writers, designers, developers there is a very obvious use case for them because it's watching your works change through time and if something goes wrong you can go back to it it's change control, it's revision control you specifically, I'm not sure
In my day job, I work a lot with, I've been getting more and more, just dabbing my big toe into the Visual Basic macros.
Is that something you guys support?
Yeah, absolutely.
The source behind those macros, you can put on there, change them when you need to of something.
If you find that a change... Now you kind of sold me.
There you go.
You kind of sold me because actually, I had to learn.
Everything I learned about Visual Basic, I Googled.
Thanks for watching!
Humongous Source Control Warehouse Source Control Database I don't think about your day job, I just think about this when I hear about you That's right You could just use Google because Google would probably source GitHub as one of the responses for that Fair enough I do try to keep my day job and night job separate because I don't want the day job knowing I have this gig where I say fuck a lot, it's a little unprofessional and so forth That trainer has such a potty mouth We're going to use it in class Mr. Rob is psycho
And Bruce Wayne never goes to any of his functions as Batman.
I mean, it just doesn't make any sense.
It's kind of like that.
That's a very, very good... And you're the Joker.
No, no.
I can imagine what a board meeting would go like now.
So, Mr. Wayne, have you looked at the financial report?
I did not look at the financial report!
Mr. Wayne, are you okay?
I am feeling fine.
Also say hello joining us in studio.
Say hello everybody.
That is my Batman voice.
I am Batman.
Say hello everybody to Rai Chan who is visiting us here in studio as well tonight.
How are you doing?
Not too bad.
I am psycho.
You're like looking at me like I'm psycho.
The only thing I have in my head after you use that voice is the Snickers commercial.
I just gotta love those old Snickers commercials, they were great So what are you doing here?
You don't work out here, you're just here for fun I actually got, managed to get a week off You gotta put that mic real close to your mouth, it's not that sensitive I managed to actually get a week off work, so Hooray!
Hooray!
Vacation After retail holidays, I am so happy to be out
Oh my gosh, I can only imagine.
I remember from the last time you were here, it wasn't like a crafting type of store or something?
I work in the printing center in an office, Max.
Oh, okay.
No, it was your other friend that worked in the crafting store, which the gal...
That you brought that one show, she was pretty cool, I never met her before Rachel?
Yeah, her mom runs Babettas You gotta bring her back someday I tried to But for now we got Rye, I love Rye too, so it works out So Rye, what happens in San Francisco?
What kind of touristy things have you been doing over there?
I just got in yesterday morning You haven't had time to do shit Anything on the agenda?
dinner dinner dinner and more dinner and concerts and music and dinner and relaxing and sleeping and a little bit of Diablo
You are a Diablo 3 nut.
I am.
I say that in the most... And it's interesting to me because I really tried to get on the Diablo 3 bandwagon.
You and I even played some games together, and I'm just like, it's not WoW.
I can't... Or it's not Diablo 2 to me.
But Diablo 3, it's working for you, and I say, great, great.
Good for you.
It's okay that I may not like the same game that you like.
What is it about Diablo 3 that keeps you coming back, though?
Because you're like level 60...
I have a Paragon.
Do not, do not go there.
Can we get through one freaking show?
No.
Without you going there.
All right, anyway.
Jamie's sitting in the back going, well, if you have seven of them, why don't you try a renegade?
You should do the renegade to get the full story.
Why do I have to be Paragon?
Hey, I don't play renegade.
Have you ever heard of Diablo 3?
Rob, who was another person in this room that signed the damn blood pact?
1.0.7, which the opening notes just came out the other day for.
Is that something you're interested in or you're like, meh?
Meh.
Okay, a dismissive hand wave, that's fine.
Yeah, but some of the other stuff coming in, the MP experience boost and all that kind of stuff is going to be fun.
More XP.
Love it.
Yay, more XP.
Did you fool around with Torchlight 2 at all?
I take offense to that.
What?
It's a video game.
I talk about cheating on WoW all the time.
Sometimes you have a relationship with a video game.
I jest.
Have you heard about the story that's floating around the game blogs this week?
Thanks, Jamie.
What the fuck's so funny?
I just... No, no, Macho Man in chat said, new class for Diablo, dork.
Shut up, Macho Man.
All right.
Ooh, burn.
Macho Man, I would be all over that class.
Ooh, yeah.
Snap into a Batman!
Alright, um... That's like half Macho Man, half like, I don't know, the Penguin from like the 1960s Batman or something?
I don't really know what that is.
Call it 20 minutes into the show, we've lost it.
That's a good idea there, Loki.
Um...
We should just do a show like that.
I could just sit here and do Batman Villains Live.
Do you even want to talk games tonight?
The April 1st Orange Lounge.
The 500th episode.
Well, not the 500th.
Oh, yeah, it is the 500th episode.
Yeah, I remember we talked about this last week.
God damn it.
Well, there goes my plan to do it as all Batman villains because that would be kind of funny.
We'll pick another show to do that.
I'm sorry.
I totally could not make it through an entire show doing the Eartha Kitt Catwoman.
Where was I?
Torchlight 2, Diablo 3.
Yeah, you were starting to ask me about Torchlight.
Yes, I was, but I was also going on the tangent about that story that's around the game blogs about how people can spend like 250 hours or like 1,000 hours with one video game.
I don't know what the fuck they're talking about.
I mean, I'm talking about like, what was it, like Romancing Saga 3 or like just these interesting video games that people are spending tons of time with and it's just about...
You just obsess over that one game and exploring every little nook and cranny of it.
I don't know what they're talking about.
This is the wrong crowd to talk about that story.
I have no idea because nobody sits around trying to get the fly cam to work on Mass Effect 2 for hours.
I never played that many hours in Grand Theft Auto 4.
Why don't you let Raichan talk?
My monk is sitting at about 655 hours last I've checked.
That's just my monk.
Is there a command in Diablo 3 like slash played?
Thanks for watching!
You can see my entire group of characters and how many hours have been spent.
The only thing is that since I have two monks and two demon hunters it only shows you the top of the two.
Do you play with strangers ever or do you only play exclusively with friends?
um it depends on who's on right now I try to play with friends as much as possible and it's kind of hard because I have so many on there so limit only four players per game but um if other people aren't on then we tend to join in public games right now what's your best dumbass story from playing with strangers I think she has a unfortunately it's not it's not a random person but I think one of her recent friends has the best story even better so far
No, you're not getting the wife and Skype?
Oh, shit, really?
No names, no names, protect the innocent, but just the whole, the long and the short, the long... We're in Gotham City, we need to bring these people to justice, so we need to hear the story.
What it amounts to is that Ryan is usually with a group of however many people are actually online on either some kind of a Ventrilo Skype, whatever conference call,
and she was telling me about this story about one of the gamers was playing and his Skype call was, he didn't have headphones on, it was playing, and his wife hears another woman's voice.
And so the two of them are just broadcasting their fight to the whole rest of the party, just flipping their shit because there's some other woman's voice coming from the computer.
Yeah, just an, oh my god, you told me that if you were ever going to be talking to another woman, you would tell me about it.
Oh, it was horrible.
I think that's the best story she's told me so far.
Really, woman needs to get over her insecurity issues.
Yeah, listening to them scream and cuss at each other was not a good thing.
and I'll see you next time.
Oh, Nick, please not so quick.
All right.
Well, welcome to the show, Rye.
Hope things go well for you here.
It's good to be back.
Hope we get some more embarrassing stories throughout the night, especially about other people.
Those are the best kind.
Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
Maybe it's more Diablo 3, or in DarkSakura's case, I can't possibly imagine what she's been playing, but I'm going to go over there and ask anyway.
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
I've been playing a healthy dose of Kiss My Ass.
No.
I played some well, because I... I don't kick!
I don't kiss ass, I kick it!
Okay.
Someone get that man a lozenge.
So, yeah, I've played some WoW, which Rob can vouch for since I chatted with him on WoW and remade my Jane Shepard because I hate playing monks, actually.
I don't like monks.
Not much.
Actually, I really hate the animations for monks on Blood Elves.
They're just too skinny.
I also I played Mass Effect 3 and Mass Effect 2 and I've actually my time in Mass Effect 2 has been nothing but trying to get Flycam to work which I have it working in everything except conversation modes although I did figure out the debug cam but it's still kind of a pain in the ass
I found out, though, interesting rendering issues that happen in the game when you try to enable the debug cam.
I'm also playing Limbo, which I'm really not very good at.
I started playing that on the train again.
I wanted to kind of get through some of those puzzles that I hadn't done in a while.
I can't get past the damn block floating in the water.
Like, do you crawl over it and then make it float?
You use the block to get a rope that's slightly hidden behind a tree.
The fuck?
How am I supposed to see that?
You grab the block, you pull it back, there's a little rope, and you can scale the trees on their edges, and there's a more or less broken branch that you push over, it falls to the ground, you push it over the water, you get across.
You're at the very baby steps of that game, oh wow.
I know, but I get pissed off.
And then I was like, well fuck this noise, I'm not gonna play anymore.
That's a lot of the trick, that's like the, I don't want to call it the gimmick of the game, because the design in general is really fantastic, and it doesn't abuse that, but that's very much the gimmick of the game, is that the
the scaling and the directional because you know it has the whole background foreground covers that it'll kind of do the foreground to trick your eyes when you're going forward and reset you from what's actually in the playable game space but yeah grab the block bring it back look for a tiny little rope dangling from the tree scale up you'll find a break in a tree action push okay I'm doing that tonight you know
Now, I wonder though if it's one of the games they've enabled with Linux yet.
I have not been keeping any look at that library whatsoever.
Anybody?
Linux?
Limbo?
I mean, it is Mac compatible, so hopefully it's easy enough to bring to the whole saga.
I just don't think it would be too hard for my netbook to handle the game.
I love monochromatic stuff and then I've actually started drawing again
Yay, drawing!
So, I found out the hard way that the pressure sensitivity in my tablet went out.
So, I actually took out paper and pencil and started drawing one of my FemShops.
Just drawing.
And I managed to draw something.
I was in a lot of pain when I was done, but I drew something.
And that's related to video games because of Garrus.
Okay, FemShop.
Oh my god, Robb.
Truffle Mania has landed on the Orange Lounge radio table.
Hello, my name is Jamie, and I like to do drawings.
You know what's funny?
What?
I spent two hours watching episodes of Simon and the Land of Chalk Drawings.
Which, have you ever seen what that skit came from, Simon and the Land of Chalk Drawings?
Wait, the... What it's based on?
The one that was on Saturday Night Live that Mike Myers did?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I grew up watching Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings and I thought no one else had heard of it until I found out another friend of mine had.
I played lots of Skyrim because I was working on getting the PC version.
Well, I got the PC version working, of course, but I loaded on about
I think I have 97 mods running right now and the whole point was I wanted to add a bunch of stuff to the game so that it would seem not necessarily new but like I would forget what mods I put on there so I wouldn't know if like hey I just haven't run across this yet or hey this is something new so I did that and my character is really overpowered and stuff but it's kind of fun and of course you know had to mess with everything
Wait, what?
It's a bear that plays Miserilou.
Thanks for watching!
And if you are interested in broadcasting on the OLR broadcast channel, I can give you all that information and the software.
Software's free.
Okay.
So, yeah.
That might be fun.
Not breaking any rules.
It's all good.
So I've been playing a lot of that and played a little bit of... Well, actually played quite a bit of Borderlands 2 this week.
Finished the single-player campaign and...
Yeah, we cheated.
But that's alright, though, because it's a lot more fun when we have really overpowered guns.
A lot more fun.
So we did that, and what else?
Do you own Borderlands on both the 360 and the PC?
I have Borderlands 1 on PC and 360.
I have Borderlands 2 only on 360.
Okay.
Okay.
I have Borderlands 1 on PlayStation 3 and PC, but that's because PS3 did the whole free with PlayStation Plus, and I was like, what the hell, why not?
Nuts to lack of cross-platform multiplayer, as always.
and then today I tried playing Forza Horizon although I see I was going to play because I have this Microsoft racing wheel and I've been meaning to try that out so the first thing I started trying to use the right racing wheel and I realized oh I need the AC adapter plugged in there because you have to have a battery pack and an AC adapter for the damn thing to work which is really ridiculous and
so I did that and then when I tried syncing the um racing wheel with the 360 I broke the um well I temporarily broke the sync button on the racing wheel so I had to take the whole thing apart to fix that so I got that fixed finally uh with like five minutes left before I had to leave um I got to play with the steering wheel and I realized I don't like the steering wheel it
and DarkSakura.
So yeah, I'm probably not going to play with that because it's kind of a pain in the ass to set all that up.
But I wanted to have used it for something because it was going to be used on the arcade cabinet.
I just haven't gotten around to doing anything with it.
So I just kind of like, hey, you know, I have this thing.
I'm going to try it out and see if it's any good.
And it's all right.
But controller is probably going to be the way I go with that.
And then what else did I play?
I played a bit of...
Modern Warfare 3 I think we played about a day of that and that was alright I've been trying to play a lot more stuff on my Steam account I've been downloading things Make use out of it, good man
All right.
Anything else?
That's it, yeah.
Then let us go over to, I guess I'll go and then our guests can go.
As far as my gaming week, honestly, not a whole lot of new stuff.
This is kind of a time to catch up.
And to be fair, I've been playing a lot of WoW because I'm trying to gear up a character so that she's ready to raid because we're having some changes in our raiding roster.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
The 3D kind of lends itself very well to that whole thing, but if you like retro games, I'm sure Mutant Buds is something that's right up your alley.
And there's the demo, so go check it out for 30 plays.
and DarkSakura.
And so I was asking questions about, can you send Pokemon back and forth?
Because the new game looks like it fixes a lot of the problems I've had with the older games.
And the older games, I'm like, they don't look any fucking different than they did in the original black and white Game Boy.
Like, yeah, they're in color and there's extra things, but they've changed very little.
First rule of Nintendo development, don't change anything unless you really have to.
But this new one looks really...
Like, they have, like, totally redone it.
So I'm very excited about that.
We'll talk more about the reboots later.
Or I shouldn't say reboot.
How it's not a reboot.
We'll talk about that later.
But then it got me to thinking, I'm like, well, I kind of want to be able to, like, be really cool and have, like, Pokemon from the old games that I can transfer into the new games.
Because I guess...
Every Pokemon game has to have the coding and the programming for every single stinking Pokemon before it because you transfer from one game to the other.
I guess even the newest Black 2, White 2 have the classic Pokemon Red and Blue characters in them because it is possible to have like a... What's a great Pokemon from the Red and Blue era?
Let's say Jinx.
To have a Jinx... Porygon!
Like, traitor all the way up.
It's possible.
So I'm kind of like, well, maybe I should just make use of the Pokemon games I have.
I played for 30 minutes and I was like, I don't know if I'm going to be able to do this for 40 hours or however long it takes to play a game, but we'll see.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And now DS and Up are all network-based.
They're all network-based, exactly.
So now you do it that way.
Wow.
That's crazy to think that Nintendo still has a straight line of interconnection with at least one generation like that.
Technus in our chatroom says, I haven't played Pokemon since Red, Blue, Yellow.
Well, in my opinion, Technus, you haven't missed much.
Same.
At least as far as the missed part.
These new ones look like it's going to really correct that.
I tried to jump back in.
We have Diamond and Pearl.
We do have Diamond and Pearl.
Diamond and Pearl.
I told myself that I love the concept of what you can do with Pokemon, and I would jump into it when I feel that the features, the hardware is available to make really cool features, and so we both bought into Diamond and Pearl.
I played it for an hour or two maybe, and I just said, eh.
Black 2 and White 2 are original DS and not 3DS.
I don't really remember what my complaint about that was, but it just surprised me because it came out well after the 3DS was in existence.
Of course, I haven't played regularly since Yellow.
I actually still have the Game Boy, the special Game Boy from Yellow.
Yes, you do.
Let's see, go into some comments from our chatters at live.vognetwork.com Well, it wouldn't surprise me if Shane lied to me, y'all But I got all this from Shane, so take it up with him Alright, he can call in later to defend himself
Chimchar, HoMonkey
Think about it.
HoMonkey.
Homo and Key.
Homo and Key.
Get it?
So I said, well, what do I name?
I didn't name it.
Name yours Flaming Finger.
No, I picked a Piplup because they're little penguins and penguins are adorable, right?
And I was like, well, I didn't think to give it a dirty name because I need to know their regular name.
I can't remember my name and their name.
If you want me to learn Pokemon, I just need to call it what it is, right?
I very rarely, I think, I do this in any RPG I play.
I don't change their names.
I need to know their regular names.
So, in your head, Sanrio's name is Cat?
Yes.
So.
Shermie was Other Cat.
So, um, Shane suggested I call, I should go back and call him Penisquin.
Didn't even think about that.
Didn't even think about that.
Ugh.
and Misty in chat, by the way, says it is Chimchar, Jason.
I thought we were still talking original 151.
Oh, then you're thinking Charizard.
No, I'm thinking Chim... Oh, Charmander.
I remember Mankey and for the life of me, I can't think of the evolved version of it.
I named my Mankey a very dirty word in Japanese.
Alright, anyhow, uh, yeah, so now that I've, uh, really, um, I've been talking about Pokemon in this show for ten minutes, we should probably move on with other gaming weeks.
I was gonna say one more thing about Forza Horizon, of course, obviously the one thing that's, you know, blatantly in your face is that stupid festival, which I was like, oh my god, I don't fucking care about the goddamn festival, I wanna race, I wanna race, I don't care about it.
You'll get it.
That was the same thing that bothered me at first and that slowly slips into the background.
It doesn't matter anymore.
You'll be fine.
Thank you for bringing that up because I did spend a night on Forza Horizon.
We had a fun night.
Some of the VOG people, it was myself, Bobby, Actdeft, SSJ100Matt, we were all playing and it was a good time.
So we'll probably do that again during the week.
So keep an eye on Twitter for when we're going to play some Forza Horizon.
because that's a fun game.
So how do you add the VOG car club thing?
Because I couldn't find that option.
Of course, I only look for about a minute.
I'll invite you.
I can just look.
If somebody hasn't already done it by the time those words left my mouth because you can just go.
If you're on the friends list of Actdeft or Bobby or somebody, they just go into the car club.
They can find you.
But I think for other people, I think when you go to the car club, you can search for VOG, V-O-G, and that's the tag, V-O-G.
It's really easy to find.
Alright, let's move on.
More gaming weeks.
Less Pokey, more me.
Yes, less Pokey, more Jason.
Pokey Jason, how was your gaming week?
I have no idea how to respond to that.
I didn't know this was that kind of show.
Hey, at least I didn't call you Home Monkey.
Alright.
I have been a very bad gamer.
Like I believe I said at the top of the show, I was out here in November.
I spent Christmas with my family in western Colorado, so I was away from all of my exciting electronic video boxes.
I haven't played very much in a very long time.
I had the discussion with Jamie that I kind of started to poke back into limbo because it sounded interesting, but my
My go-to hobby is turning into music, and that's taken over quite a bit, because I don't know that I've even touched Borderlands 2 since October, maybe November, and I just... I play lots of tiny little things, like I have stupid apps on my phone, I touch my 3DS every once in a great while, but I just don't...
You know, there's nothing that I have that dedication to right now.
I'll tell you a secret.
Mixing music is something I've kind of always wanted to get into as well.
And, like, I've tried.
I've downloaded programs to try and, like, do it.
I'm really bad at it.
You can't do it software-only.
I'm really bad at it.
I took the plunge.
I made the $500 investment to get a controller that appealed to... The $500 investment, more like $1,500 after my case, speakers, mixer, cables, and...
Alan, that's why I went for my birthday Are you playing dubstep?
No.
I was actually... I've been asked that sarcastically, but I've gotten a few no-shit requests about it, and I started thinking about my library.
I'm like, well, I have Skrillex, because I was on that bandwagon.
Look at your library, look at your choices.
If my choices are based off my library, I have very few complaints.
You actually just made me think of something, though.
There's a YouTube video of a cockatiel trilling dubstep.
Because you know birds adapt to sounds around them into their language.
The bird speaks dubstep.
I definitely need to see this sometime.
So it was kind of, people, you know, they want some music to be played at a party or whatever.
I've gotten completely serious requests to play something like that.
And I just kind of think of what I have in my library and it's like, I know a couple of these artists.
I have a couple of one-offs.
I have Skrillex because everybody jumped on that bandwagon.
Some people call Knife Party dubstep even though they are not.
Um, but I just, I, I could not play 30 minutes worth.
Nero, Nero's awesome.
Nero's, I, I, House dubstep and what else does he do?
Drum and bass.
Yeah.
I really enjoy Nero.
I just don't have very much of his stuff.
Um,
In all fairness, because I don't want the dubstep fans to email the show, I hate you, wub wub wub.
I acquired the new Muse album this past week, which is a great album.
One of their songs, though, is a little bit dubstep experimentation.
It's the best song in the whole album.
It really is.
For real.
Yeah, my two jaunts right now are the general house genres, kind of progressive, electro, maybe down to trance.
But then I play a lot of UK and happy hardcore that I've enjoyed for a very long time, and now I can actually do something interesting with it, so that's been pretty fun.
And the great culmination of that is that my company is, my employer is putting on two shows this week, Tuesday at Mighty down in San Francisco, and Thursday a very public event at Public Works San Francisco.
And
I'm going to be on stage and I am freaking scared and excited and crazy.
You're going to be like Loki about to get on a roller coaster at Disneyland.
Yes, very much so.
Alright.
Rye, how was your gaming week?
What kind of video games have you been playing lately?
Or just Diablo 3, 24-7?
Diablo, Diablo.
Not 24-7, but for the most of it.
Just 22-7, you know.
Need a couple of hours of work, but...
Yeah, I went from Paragon, I believe, 47 up to 54 the past week, running public games and whatnot.
The only other thing that I've played recently was LEGO Lord of the Rings that I got for my birthday.
I really haven't gotten very far in it.
Because?
Diablo 3!
that's like a lot of games for me in World of Warcraft so don't feel bad alright well I hope you can discover some more games in the coming weeks because eventually you're going to hit Paragon 60 and then what?
Paragon 100 60 is the standard level cap but Paragon is 100 and that's of course also per character so she has no?
No, I am done after I get this character done.
That's what they all say.
It can be.
Paragon is still specific to a character.
And should she want to, she does have six other characters.
Not to mention the fact that there's an achievement for getting ten level 60s and having two of each class at level 60.
She has the plan.
It's all about the achievements.
Actually, that was another thing I was doing this week.
I was trying to achievement hunt in old games.
Okay, guys.
Guess what game I played this week just to get an achievement.
Yars.
Worse.
Worse.
Dino Dash.
What is an Xbox Live Arcade game worse than Yars and worse than Dino Dash?
Avatar.
Worse than Avatar.
Xbox Live Arcade.
It's offensive to anybody who listened to this show earlier today.
I would say Beaten Groovy.
Beaten Groovy.
I played Beaten Groovy this week.
Shame on you.
And I got a new achievement.
To put money into that.
I had to play every song in three-button mode.
I was so...
Bored.
And, like, Alan walked out into the room.
He's like, this looks bad.
What is this?
I'm like, it's on Xbox Live Arcade.
I'm like, doesn't it look like it's PlayStation 1?
He's like, yeah, look at those character animations.
Those are real next-gen right there.
So, yeah.
I had one of those weeks.
Shame.
That's just a travesty.
No, shame to chat.
All right.
I've found something for you.
Oh, this is for me.
So this is, oh yes, okay.
Because earlier when you were talking about the bird singing dubstep, I'm like, this show's been derailed seven times for Sunday already.
So what the hell?
What's another video going to add to it?
Okay, here we go.
I think that's the one.
So this is bird singing dubstep.
If there's an ad on this, so help me God.
So help me God.
Rob, it's not my fault.
You need to have your ad block up.
You're using Chrome, right?
No, you're not.
Why are you using Chrome?
Firefox.
Shame on you.
That's it.
The funny thing is that actually sounds like some pretty impressive beatboxing to an extent.
My sister's birds would probably do something like that.
She has a bird that looks exactly like that.
I like that it's dancing.
I could just listen to that for three hours.
I could see the appeal of dubstep.
I could totally just listen to that tonight.
Let's go to break, you guys.
We're gonna have our music break tonight.
Coming soon to DDR.
SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says, Congrats, OLR has found the end of the internet.
That's right.
We have collectively been eaten by a group.
Good night, everybody.
You've been listening to Orange Mountain.
I don't know.
I think... I was just saying Tard's been replaced by Dubstep Bird.
I don't know.
I think Polly, the X-rated parrot, might be a little... That came and went, though.
No, it's not Polly.
It's Ruby.
Oh, yeah.
All right, let's move on into some housekeeping.
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, Twitter.com slash OLR.
You can also hear this show in Stitcher.
Use thumbs up a lot if you listen there and share with all your friends and spread the word.
Because, you know, I can't imagine why word of this show doesn't spread like wildfire across the masses.
By the way, speaking of popularity contests, the podcast awards happened this past week.
and we didn't win.
It's too bad.
I want to give a shout out.
I got to give a shout out to my Twitter buddy because us independent podcasts have to stick together.
I got to give a shout out to my Twitter buddy Godfrey from Gamertag Radio.
That is a hard working guy and he is very good at promoting his show.
He's a very passionate podcaster and I honest to God thought he was going to win it.
I really did.
It's kind of that thing where it's like I'd love to win it but
If Godfrey won it, it's hard to be mad because, you know, he's been nominated several times.
At this point, they're becoming like the Susan Lucci of the podcast awards.
And so it's like, let the guy win already.
He didn't win either.
And I was like legit upset that he didn't win and we didn't win.
So...
Rob was doing that thing where he fans his face.
A little bit.
I won't cry.
I won't cry.
I'm not going to Las Vegas because Godfrey's probably going to win this year.
So I'll watch the speech from home.
And then when he didn't win, I'm like, oh, God, that poor guy went all the way to Vegas.
But it sounds like he had some great inspiration and all that and got to meet some really cool people and do the networking.
So shame on me for not going to Vegas.
But I'm broke.
I am broke.
Christmas broke me.
So this was not a good time of the year for the podcast awards.
Anyway, that is it for housekeeping.
Let's get into some gaming news.
Loki.
All right.
So let's talk a little bit about CES fun stuff.
And, of course, one of the big major announcements gaming-wise that kind of happened a little bit before CES even began was the new NVIDIA handheld console that they're putting out.
It's the NVIDIA Shield, and it's a Tegra 4-based handheld console.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and you can even run um PC games on there by streaming them to your system and they even have a way to you know it has an HDMI out on it so you can play it on your TV if you want um but the whole fact that you can basically put in this mode where you stream stuff from your PC and you can even bring up Steam and play like you know console games on that is kind of cool um
I can stream anything I want from my PC to the gaming handheld?
I guess whatever's supported from it, but yeah.
So, number of seconds before porn is displayed on one of these devices.
Oh, it has a web browser in it because it's Android.
So yes, it would be no time whatsoever.
But, if you think about it though, if you can stream from your PC, and I'm assuming though that you can only do this...
I bet you could do a lot sitting in bed.
Yeah.
No chat, though.
Hypothetically, if I happen to have a TV in my bedroom, I could have boobies on the TV and boobies on the little handheld.
Yes.
That's what technology's all about, y'all.
So, yeah, they have the whole Steam Big Picture Mode support on there.
No price announced yet for it, and obviously, you know, because it's one of the first devices that has a Tegraform chip in it, it'll be interesting to see what it can run.
They're saying, you know, more console-quality games.
Some of the games that they have announced for it, Hawken, which was a PC kind of mech shooter, and actually...
One of the other titles was an old Wii game, The Conduit.
It's going to be getting some sort of souped up version that will be on Android.
So there's that stuff and of course some other Android games.
There's going to be more Taker 4 games coming out.
Like I said, no price point yet.
Everyone's like, oh, it's going to kill the Ouya and stuff like that.
They haven't announced the price yet.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And don't buy it.
because they can.
I mean, they're already in the PC marketplace.
If you think about it, though, this technology, that's the only thing.
You're going to need a really high-end graphics card in order to run this because it's built into your graphics card as far as being able to stream to this device.
So really new high-end graphics card, and it has to be that NVIDIA card.
So that's why they're in this is because, oh, that's a really cool device.
Oh, crap, got to upgrade my graphics card, and I have to buy NVIDIA.
So that means more money for them.
It's win-win because they sell the device.
So when I first read about this, I was quick to blame the Ouya for this.
I don't know what it is, but there was a part of me that said, NVIDIA is doing this because of the Ouya.
And because of the way the Ouya took off, NVIDIA said, you know what Ouya's got wrong about this is that Ouya's making you hook it up to a TV.
What if we did an Ouya that's handheld?
I mean, isn't that, that's what a lot of this stuff is.
An Ouya that's handheld is a tablet.
Well, okay, isn't that kind of what this is?
I mean, it's not a tablet per se, but it might as well be.
No, this is, I think, something else.
I think this is just their whole thing is they're trying to go after PC gaming because, I mean, they make money off of their chips, but I think they're going to make more money off their graphics cards and all the tech that goes into that because, I mean, it's them and ATI.
That's it.
That's your choices for graphics cards and...
Anything that edge out the competition that make people say, hey, you know what?
I should get this because it's got that.
And if you think about it, NVIDIA has kind of done stuff like that.
I mean, they have three displays and they have, you know, that built into it and the PhysX stuff and also now the streaming thing and CUDA cores where you can, you know, run other things using that.
You know, PC applications that support those other cores.
I mean that's kind of the direction they're going so I wouldn't exactly blame the OUYA for it because I mean they don't know how it's gonna do yet I mean granted you're seeing a lot more of these set top I mean the whole thing with CES was just like you know it's tablets and Google TV and 4k TVs is basically the three big things but all people really want is an iPad I don't think so
Are you sure?
Yeah.
I mean, well, there's the Apple people that have to keep buying new things.
There's a lot of Apple people, though.
There's a lot of people who bought the Wii, but that doesn't mean that Nintendo is doing really well with the next system.
A quick context jump, at least as far as the consumer is concerned.
A buddy of mine that has this dinosaur of a phone was blown away at the ability to take his Wii U gamepad, be in another room in the house, and continue to browse the internet.
He doesn't have to pull out his laptop.
Well, that too, really.
Kind of awkward for this.
Anyways, sorry.
But it was the most absurd thing for me to read is that, wow, I have four inches of the internet.
Right smack dab in this little handheld controller and I don't even have to be in the same room as the TV is in.
And I did one of these things where I reached into my pocket and I pulled out my phone and I was like, wow, I'm not confined to the house.
This is like five years in the future.
And it's just strange because it's also like a connectivity excuse.
If you can game anywhere, even on a screen that's that small, people will do it when they can.
And I think there's application for it.
It doesn't necessarily fit in best for us.
Maybe, maybe not as much as another person, but for these people that just have little setups, it has enough of an application to survive in the market, I think.
Well, how do you win across the people, you know, the elderly folks that like Wii Sports Bowling?
You show them the voodoo magic that is TV on a thing that's not the TV.
Holy crap, how did my TV get on this little piece of, you know, plastic?
This is black magic.
I'm buying one.
And then they bowl it, drop it, and... Are you a wizard?
Actually, in this case, it keeps working if they were to bowl that little controller.
Unless they, like, break off, snap off the screen.
I don't like this camera on this thing.
I think it's gonna steal my identity.
That's an old... I could see that.
I've gotten that before.
Have you really?
Yeah, not camera specifically, but my name's on a website because I'm in a play.
Is there any problem with that?
That's why my mom won't join Facebook.
I asked my mom, I asked my mom, my mom is on Twitter and I'm not allowed to give out a Twitter handle or she will murder me.
But my mom has always said like, and she's only on Twitter because she wants to follow Cher, Kathy Griffin, Barack Obama, and Rosie O'Donnell.
No Oprah?
Not yet, she probably just hasn't thought of that one But anyway, she follows like four people And then me, she stalks me on Twitter But anyway, what was I really going to say?
Oh yes, my mom will not join Facebook And her thing always is, Rab I don't need, Rab, I don't need to join Facebook People have their identities stolen on Facebook, Rab And no one wants to see my face That's her line, no one wants to see my face My face isn't on Facebook, at least not my profile picture
People have their identity stolen because they gave their card to someone, which you do on a daily basis.
Alright, let's move on with some more news, shall we?
Talking about something else that was, you know, we didn't get a whole lot of gaming news out of CES this year, but there was a couple things here and there, and this was something that was gaining a lot of esteem, if you will, the talk at CES.
It's Valve's Steam Box, and it was confirmed by Gabe Newell that the Steam Box will run Linux.
The Steam Box, of course, is a little PC in a box that's basically designed to be hooked up to the computer.
It's basically out there to compete with the consoles, but it's a PC.
It's Steam, and it will be Linux.
Big surprise.
And this is the one from Valve.
From Valve.
The official one from Valve.
Yes.
Yes.
By the way, that box itself, not supposed to hit in 2013.
That kind of surprises me.
Why not strike now when all this stuff is a big hit?
I don't get what's so freaking difficult about this.
Like, what do they have planned for this?
I'm going back to an earlier prediction, by the way.
I am going back to an earlier prediction I had, and I'm sticking by it.
Half-Life 3, when the Steam Box happens.
Probably.
Why not?
and people who have the Steam Box will get Half-Life 3 first and watch that thing just cut the Ouya off of the kneecaps.
Watch.
Watch.
There's a reason why it's not dropping this year.
Compatibility.
Oh, because of Linux compatibility.
They're waiting for more of the games.
They need more developers to jump on.
That's why Steam Linux is coming to Linux systems first, because they need to have that library base.
They need it to be as successful as possible, because when that thing drops, why can't I play Mass Effect on there?
Why can't I play World of Goo on there?
Why can't I play Toki, Tori, Limbo?
Anyways.
Well, how about a comment from Ben Krasnow, who is an electrical engineer with Valve.
Although I thought that's weird because I thought Valve people didn't have titles, but maybe that's just what's on his resume if you looked at his LinkedIn or something.
Quote, with regards to the Steam box news, there's been a lot of things stated in media, which I didn't say.
For example, it's true that we are working on getting Steam into the living room and are planning for a hardware box, but we have no current plans to announce anything in 2013.
So the Linux thing may end up being something...
The thing to draw from this, we're hearing about the Linux thing now, but that may actually end up not being the case.
Maybe it's running Linux now, but who knows what's going to happen.
It's because it can't run Windows 8, because that would look really weird.
It can't run Windows, period.
And it can't run Mac OS, so why wouldn't it run Windows?
Mac OS, like iOS, wow.
It could run a modified version of Linux.
Yeah, anything, like, they may put together the SteamOS...
The SteamOS, which is going to be a Linux kernel, their own different base utilities, whatever they need to do.
Call it Linux, call it not.
Call it not Linux because it's proprietary.
I don't know.
What a big surprise.
It's going to be based on the biggest open platform in the world.
Well, speaking of open platforms, Gabe Newell apparently looking at the Steam box as being something, or Steam in general, as being something that is a very user-generated paradise.
Maybe taking a cue from GitHub, who knows?
Our view has always been... Wow, nice leap.
Yeah, nice.
Our view has always been that we should build tools for customers and tools for partners.
An editorial filter is fine, but there should be a bunch of editorial filters.
The backend services should be network APIs that anybody can use.
On the consumer side, anybody should be able to put up a store that hooks into those services.
Some people will create team stores.
Some people will create Sony stores.
Some people will create stores with only games that they think meet their quality bar.
Somebody is going to create a store that says these are the worst games on Steam.
So that's an example of where our thinking is leading us right now.
Very interesting.
Four letters.
H T T P
Because the web is something that... Or what?
What's the point you're making?
Because that's become the universal communication mechanism.
And let somebody do whatever the hell they want and then interconnect it and host it and make it available just by pointing to a different location and boom!
The freedom of the internet and the open platform and hoorah!
I don't want to be dismissive about it because really it is the best thing to come to computing in ever besides computing existing in the first place.
But it's...
It's just an interesting thing they're banking on, I guess.
I don't know.
I don't really have a way to summarize it.
It's just funny that Steam has come from store to meta store and opening it all up, but there's still the linchpin holding it all together.
I don't know.
I feel like I'm still missing one last detail that makes this whole narrative of everything Steam is doing over the next three years to make sense.
Do you think the Steam box is going to be too late?
Oh, hell no.
No, not even a little bit.
It's going to be a significant player, period.
That's all there is to say about it.
If it's too late.
If Half-Life 3 is on it, I mean... I don't think they're really going to necessarily put Half-Life 3 exclusive to the Steam box or anything like that, but I think that it may launch with it or something.
And there's other third-party manufacturers of this stuff, so if you don't like the configuration of running Linux or anything like that, that probably wouldn't be something I'd be interested in.
I don't know.
I just don't really want to run Linux.
What about Linux Mint?
Could Jamie get her precious Linux Mint on a Steam box, you think?
Probably.
Why not?
I can get Linux Mint on a USB drive.
If you can get Linux on a toaster, Rob, Mint will run on anything.
Here's what I would like to see.
I would like to see more apps coming to Steam Big Picture mode.
Like, for example, Netflix and Hulu and that kind of stuff.
Because right now that's the thing.
I wanted to build a PC that has this kind of cool interface like the Xbox 360 and stuff.
and so on.
That would be pretty awesome so that I can get all that stuff in there because that's really what I'm looking for is just, you know, watch TV stuff, play games, runs on a PC because things will look better.
All right, let's move on with more news because there was news this week that had nothing to do with newfangled consoles and new boxes and things, but news about the good old consoles that are out now, right?
Right, Jamie?
Yeah, some Pokemans.
Pokemon.
So Nintendo announced that Pokemon X and Pokemon Y are going to be on the Nintendo 3DS.
And they should be out later this October.
Why are we thinking that far ahead, man?
But it just makes me wonder if you get all chick Pokemon in one and all dude Pokemon in the other.
Because they're XY.
Even if Pokemon had XY chromosomes, I'm just saying.
No, I think it has something to do with the way the final bosses are named or something.
Well, at any rate, they're actually saying that it's not a reboot.
It's just an evolution of the franchise.
And Game Freak has basically been working their ass off trying to get it out.
The quote is saying that there has never been a conscious decision to reboot.
There's always been an evolution of the look and feel.
No one gives a shit.
So their Pikachu has evolved into a Raichu.
Yeah, their Pikachu is like a Pikachu-er.
Their Wubbachu has evolved into a dub Stepachu.
That's never going to get old.
Never, ever.
And that's the sound the Pokemon still make in the games today, by the way.
They never learned how to say their names like they did in the cartoon.
But you go like, you know, whole monkey, I choose you.
And it goes...
The best thing that the newer Pokemon games have ever given is X, use the pester ball.
It's super effective.
It's super effective.
Are you excited about Pokemon X and Y?
No.
Will you give it another chance?
No.
I saw the little trailer video and first things first about the trailer video.
Fennekin, totally adorable.
Have you seen Fennekin?
No.
Let me put it this way.
DeviantArt
Like jizzed in their pants DeviantArt pisses me off Why does DeviantArt piss you off?
Besides the royalty thing I'm talking the community Don't bring up that crap about the royalties I don't care about that The community and all that Tumblr blew up The royalty things is the fuck Oh god No, and actually there are a lot of people Who get their panties in a wad on DeviantArt these days So I'm just completely kind of done Even though I did post something on there
so wait a minute you're done with DeviantArt but you just posted there the other day yeah because I actually use I pay for my DeviantArt account to host my portfolio
I guess that's fair.
All right, look, look, I gotta show you this in the little trailer, although I'm sure I'm gonna get hit with an ad here, but I gotta show you in this trailer the Fennekin, because Fennekin's super adorable.
And finally, the game looks different.
Like, it's not that same, like, sprite-based thing we've seen since, like, the original freaking games.
It is, like, you know, what you would expect to see on a 3DS.
So...
and Pikachu's still in it.
Okay, so, you know, it's like, yay, we're going to take over the world one little pocket monster at a time.
But see, now it's actually like what a game from this year should look like, right?
Okay, now that actually does look kind of fun, except I don't have a 3DS.
However, the Pokemon all look retarded.
Okay, that's Chespin.
He looks cute, right?
No.
And look at the battles.
The battles look like a freaking Dragon Quest game.
Or something.
How adorable is Fennekin?
Okay, Fennekin is cute.
See?
See?
He's like... But only because it looks like Eevee.
Who put a Firefox in this game?
Oh, he's so cute.
And then that is, I don't know, Froakie.
That looks disgusting.
What's that shit on its nose?
Are those glasses?
Noah's big snot bubbles.
That's what it is.
He's blowing snot on whatever that raccoon thing is.
Hibiga.
And then Psyduck, oh god.
Psyduck is like the big joke of the series.
No, that's Psyduck.
Psy.
Is his name Boner?
Ry is giving me the commentary.
No, Rob.
That one's Y. That one's X. You've studied this trailer.
And the secret one is Boner.
I actually haven't.
Just saw somebody post it on my Facebook.
What's up with that peacock deer?
That was really weird.
I will probably give these so doesn't that like didn't that like yeah you go okay new Pokemon game yeah whoopty shit I've seen this before but then you look at that trailer and you go they finally fucking changed it this I can do this this looks good I will give this game a shot again welcome to 2013 Nintendo the same argument I made for Diamond and Pearl for the DS I think the 3DS and I hope Nintendo's giving a shit about online and modern technology and the things that they're actually continuing to build into their new systems I'll give this a shot
Does that mean you'll play it for two hours this time?
No, two and a half.
Okay.
It's an improvement, damn it.
Actdeft, in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, dares to challenge Jamie, saying Magikarp is the big joke of the series.
Magikarp is... Psyduck was more the joke in the cartoons.
Whatever.
I don't care.
It's Pokemon.
GameGuru, bringing logic into this argument, saying, well, Pokemon had to update to polygons to support 3D so they couldn't use sprites anymore.
GameGuru, you haven't played those NES classics where they just put the different sprite layers on different 3D planes.
They could have done cheap-ass 3D if they wanted to, but I'm glad they didn't.
They're finally doing the right thing.
All right, let's move on with more news.
Loki.
Alright, so there is a neat little piece of technology that they showed off.
I don't know if it was at CES or it was just something that they showed off during CES.
But it is this brand new thing called the Microsoft in Illumaroom.
And what the Illumaroom demo was is basically this...
A combination of a projector and a Kinect built in so that it senses the geometry of your room and then extends your gameplay field beyond the TV.
It can be supplemental stuff like racing in a game and the lighting effects from cars driving by at night or something like that.
Cast Shadows on stuff that's in your room.
Or, you know, snow when you're walking through snow.
Or, you know, even like geometry for first person shooters and that kind of thing.
Now, what's interesting about this is this is something we talked about before.
Not necessarily the Illumeroom thing, but kind of a lot of stuff hinting at it.
Like, for example, there's the whole patent back in...
I don't think this is going to work with the Kinect because the way the projector works on this is similar to what they had in their Microsoft Home of the Future display.
Which I think is on their campus.
And this is what I've kind of alluded to before where they showed off these different displays that are built into... Not necessarily built into the walls, but they are projected onto the walls.
So they have, for example, this kid's room that will have this fictional teenage girl's favorite bands.
The posters on the wall are all dynamic.
It's showing her bands and stuff.
And then, say...
Oh, Grandma's coming over today and they're going to stay in your room.
And then the whole motif just changes completely to, you know, whoever's using it.
Like, they have a window that shows, you know, her dog at home on a security camera or something like that.
So, basically, what... And this... And they also have some projects that they've done with Augmentive...
and Augmentive Projectors where you can actually use your shadows to control stuff like Kinect where you have particles that you're moving your hand and your shadows like picking them up and you can actually pick stuff up with your fingers which is kind of neat.
So I see that kind of stuff happening.
Now whether is this going to be included in the next Xbox?
I think if anything this will be an accessory for the next Xbox.
I don't think this is something that they can just throw in there because the setup is...
Pretty cool and pretty non-existent in the end.
Yeah, it's one of those things where I'm like, is this snake oil?
The video is pretty impressive, the video that's floating around out there.
It's a neat concept.
I wouldn't say it's snake oil, but they have a working prototype.
Even they show this Home of the Future type thing, this Microsoft thing.
I don't live in the Home of the Future, Loki.
What?
They have a working prototype in a 100% tailored setup.
I'm just wondering though, I'm wondering just basically how much this would cost because projectors aren't cheap.
And so, I mean, this would be cool technology if this is something that they launch with the system that you're immersed in your whole room.
I mean, that'd be pretty cool.
Projectors can come at all sorts of levels.
Like, yes, a high quality projector isn't cheap, but you can get a little thing that projects shadow puppets on the wall for your kids when they sleep for $20.
Right.
So, I mean, what is the level of projection technology in this thing?
It's somewhere in the middle, probably.
But I don't think it's going to be built into the next Xbox.
I'm with you.
I think it's some type of accessory.
Well, they were even talking about the tracking and stuff, better 3D modeling and capture and stuff.
One of the things they said with the Kinect that they were going to change is that they're going to have, instead of having that IR field just...
I don't know, it sounds interesting but
Thanks for watching!
putting the display for your computer on any object or wall or whatever so it could be cool and that would be also kind of neat if you think about it like imagine you know playing like Forza or something like that and then you have all you know you could have maps and all sorts of HUD equipment you know outside of the TV but that time though if you're gonna have all that stuff outside of the screen you might as well just use the projector as your display in the first place
Ragenator in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com asks, now the question is how many steps away from Star Trek's holodeck is this projector?
We're getting closer.
Now it's making the whole room show imagery.
It's closer.
They have technology that's in another one of their videos because they have this whole research thing that they do a bunch of future tech stuff.
They have a 3D display that is pretty interesting.
It can be viewed from 360 degrees.
You can't touch it yet, but we're getting there.
We're getting there.
Use the passphrase, swim.
All right.
Well, moving on for time issues.
This sounds awesome.
I'm looking forward to more information on it.
I hope it's something that actually works because the concept sounds great and could really enhance gaming.
Moving on, though, a story that we've really kept an eye on and everybody has in the game industry this week is the fallout from the tragedy last month in Connecticut.
and I'm sure you guys all heard in the news about the gaming companies that were actually meeting with Joe Biden this week.
There was even some controversy around that.
Should they even be meeting with Joe Biden?
Because is meeting with him admitting that they are part of the problem?
Well, here's the reality, guys.
I mean, no matter where you stand on that issue, a survey company named Survey USA actually...
Pulled a bunch of parents.
I don't know exactly what the qualifications were for this survey, but I guess it was all 50 states in the U.S., January 4th and 5th, just over 1,000 parents who have children under the age of 18 living at home.
89% of parents believe that violence in today's video games is a problem.
75% believe that violence in video games contributes to violent behavior.
75%.
Sheep.
three out of four.
That is a line that transcends Democrat and Republican and any of that.
That is a vast majority.
That's the reality.
75% of parents believe that violence in video games contributes to violent behavior.
Now what I would be curious to know is does that mean that they take an active role in what their kids should and should not play?
I wonder if the survey went to that.
Well, how often do you... Well, here's an example.
And I know way too many... I'm not saying that any parent in this room does this, because I know you probably don't, really.
But there are some people who I know who have kids who really just let their kids sit unregulated and watch whatever they want to and play whatever they want to and aren't even in the same room when they're playing a game.
And...
And of course, I don't think that it's a matter necessarily of the game or the show that's being the influence.
It's a matter of neglect being the influence.
Because the kid's going to act out when they're not getting the attention they need.
Let me run down some of the other stats.
Because Jamie, I'm really curious what you think about some of this.
93, 93% of parents, damn near all parents, nationwide say lack of supervision for children contributes to violence.
Agreed.
92% of parents nationwide say bullying contributes to violence.
Very much agreed.
86% of parents nationwide say crime in day-to-day life contributes.
That depends.
Yes, because the news shows it is where I'm going with that.
My point is that it's media is the contributor.
How many people think that that horrible gunman, and I won't say his name, how many people think that that horrible gunman did what he did so that he could go out with all the publicity?
Because if he wanted to end it all, he could have done it in a different way.
But he did it in a way that was meant to get attention.
I think he did it because his mother works there.
I can't clearly put myself in that kind of mindset because I'm not a psychopath or a sociopath.
But he went to the school that his mother taught at and shot her students and then her.
So that seems more of a big revenge thing.
Just because I want to spare you the males.
I know.
Technically, the mother was killed, then he went to the school.
Okay.
But I think it's related.
It's like, oh, she's gone, let's fuck up everything that meant something to her, and then we're done.
I don't want to talk about him anymore.
But my point is, I don't know how much of the media might have had something to do with that other than it gave it to him as an option.
77% of parents nationwide say violence in TV and movies contributes so interesting enough I mean to be fair as much as we're sitting here going oh my gosh 75% that is 2% lower than the number of parents who say TV and movies contributes so at least everybody's getting blamed equally I guess 64% say violent toys contribute here's what surprised me
75% we already established believe that violence in video games contributes guess what got the exact same percentage also at 75% exact same easy access to guns contributes to violence yeah but on the exact same level as video games well again video games are the scapegoat
We have tons of research, psychiatric data, and statistics that show video games are not the responsible thing.
I think when you put a combination of pre-existing mental conditions, when you throw in easy access to weaponry, and when you throw in a few other external factors like, for example, the guy here in California who was bullied.
and he shot one of his bullies and got talked out of it you know that's definitely a contributing factor I just I need to get this out there because the chat room is lighting up on this and again we don't want the podcast listeners sitting there going I'm going to write an email because they're wrong folks in chat all over the place saying that it was not she didn't work at the school the media reported that but the media fucked up a lot of the information at first so
But I think there was some type of connection between him and the school.
Whether it was that he went there or something, I don't know.
But anyway, you know.
Regardless, I think that maybe you might not have gotten the idea if it hadn't been something so publicized.
You know.
He's sick.
We can all agree on that.
Very, very, very sick.
Um...
Apparently, those surveyed were shown a video for Hitman Absolution.
84% said that advertisement was inappropriate to show on TV at a time when children are watching.
Well, I'd actually kind of agree with that.
You don't show a commercial like that during, you know, the Smurfs.
Not shown during the time when they were watching TV.
Okay.
Yeah, that's true.
That's right.
They're not shown.
I was just like... Once again, though... Unless parents let their kids watch South Park unattended.
Same death.
Which is an M-rated show.
Once again, though, I think, though, that a lot of this is just... You're asking someone's opinion on this doesn't mean that they're right.
And...
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
You can think all these things, but it doesn't necessarily mean that any of this is correct.
So, I mean, I don't know.
Once again, we're just probably going to see more legislature with video games because everyone's believing now that video games are violent because the media told them.
And oddly enough, they question all this other stuff, but they don't question media, which makes no sense whatsoever.
Yeah.
Fine.
Let me close with this comment and then I want to move on from SSJ100, Matt.
People look for answers to understand tragedy.
They want a finger to point at because the fact of the matter is people are terrified of the fact that people could do something so horrible for no reason than just because.
I guess it's scapegoat.
House of the Dead
I don't know if anybody had House of the Dead in the first place.
But Lethal Enforcers first, really?
Time Crisis and Beachhead 2000 was another one.
Beachhead 2000.
What a light gun game.
What a pretentious fucking game Beachhead 2000 was in many ways.
Let's be real.
But still, apparently...
Too Hot for Massachusetts.
that's your prerogative you can do whatever the hell you want because you know what it's your arcade you can make those decisions I don't even know why it was a news story other than oh this happened so let's make it into a story but like seriously if you don't like fighting games so if you know people are bullying each other you take fighting games out of your arcade that's your own choice
Did they replace it with non-violent ticket games?
Because I'd like to know if that actually happened.
The games that remained, Ms.
Pac-Man, Galaga, and Cruisin' Exotica at one point.
Like Cruisin' World, it's not a porn game.
It's like the Cruisin' race games.
Cruisin' Exotica, I mean, that's very violent.
Can't you hit things?
I mean, remember Cruisin' USA, you can explode deer.
And you can drive a school bus irresponsibly.
You can drive over 100 miles an hour, which doesn't happen in the States except on racetracks.
Richard Davey, the State Secretary of Transportation in Massachusetts Here's a quote Bottom line is, I think there isn't a person who doesn't believe that there isn't too much violence in our society and games can glorify that A video game in a public space could be used by anybody of any age
I think there isn't a person who disagrees.
who doesn't believe that there isn't too much violence in our society and games can glorify that.
It's a positive because it's very negative.
A person does not exist who doesn't believe that there isn't too much violence.
So...
I think it should be that, and he doesn't think that those people don't exist.
So if I were going to rephrase that, I think what he intends is, I think most people believe there's too much violence in our society.
Wouldn't that have been easier?
By the way, I don't think there's enough violence.
He would have learned better grammar if he wasn't playing those violent video games.
They're the blame.
Not playing violent video games leads to bad grammar.
I want to make the most bloody grammar game ever.
That'd be awesome.
Call it, I don't know, bloody... I can't think of a... Hunt, Peck, Mame, the game.
According to Jason in our chatroom, Jason, you're talking there in our chatroom, apparently that quote was quote-ception.
Negative-ception.
I have no idea.
It just hurt my head to try to deal with.
There isn't a person who doesn't believe that there isn't too much violence.
We get it, we get it, we get it, we get it.
Alright, let's move on.
More news.
DarkSakura, one more story and then the release dates.
UK University is trying to use the Kinect to see if it will help stroke victims.
I couldn't resist.
I'll put it away.
I'm going to take that gong and shove it so far up your ass.
I don't know.
This is kind of payback for all the Vuvuzela stuff.
That is true.
I'm going to shove that gong so far up your ass that you burp brass.
Technically, I don't think it's a gong.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
So you're going to put brass in my ass to give me brassy gas?
All right.
Seriously, read the fucking story.
I'm going to walk away.
I would much rather have Dubstep Bird.
Can we remix those together?
You have to add a re for a minute to make it go They need to have a bird that does the Inception sound If you think about it, if you think about it, it probably exists on the internet somewhere Inception bird?
No, dubstep Inception HD here
That actually hurts.
And I'm not meaning that in an exaggerating kind of way.
It actually hurts.
All right, just please read this.
I don't think that there isn't a person that...
and to their doctors.
These are for stroke victims.
They're wanting to use the system to detect and track asymmetries on the patient's face.
That means mouth, eyes, cheeks, like for facial exercises.
I think it's for people who end up with ticks after strokes or being paralyzed.
And this is actually being headed, it looks like, by Dr. Philip Breeden.
who is basically saying that the system is going to use those exercises and see how successful they are with that feedback provided by the Kinect system.
So, pretty good.
I'm glad to hear a story about gaming things and things that were done for gaming doing good after those past couple stories we had, so...
Agreed.
And, I mean, you really have to think about it.
Like, for example, they had all those PlayStations put together to calculate, you know, cures.
They had, you know, now this technology with Kinect.
They've got lots of cognitive therapy exercises that are being done with video games.
And...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Just a tiny little house party for New Year's and one of their friends created this very quick little visualization demo that uses the Kinect.
It uses the 3D, the point field, all of the features of the Kinect to create this reactive visualization.
He implemented the ability to...
You take the object and manipulate it in 3D space as far as the output is concerned.
And then obviously you have control of the Kinect's tilt and how much of the space it will actually display.
For all of the grief that I've given Kinect, as far as what it's capable of doing and representing, it's actually really good.
This kind of thing, I wouldn't think that it'd be applicable to the granularity of a face, but from the right distance, why not?
I really enjoy hearing about these applications that are practical and promising at the same time.
Oh, we've heard about Kinect being used by doctors.
I mean, maybe not like hooked up to an Xbox or anything, but like, you know, that technology in PCs, you know, pretty awesome.
Alright, let's move on.
Travel around the world and check out maybe some more affordable video games coming to a store near you.
We'll start in the US, Loki.
This week is Devil May Cry on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
Woo!
That's it.
First big release of the new year though, right?
Hey, Anarchy Reigns came out last week.
Oh yeah, I forgot about that.
That's right, that's right.
Shame on me.
I've been told I need to play that.
A game with potentially Bayonetta if you bought it from GameStop.
Really?
Yeah, only from GameStop.
Thank you, Sega.
Fuck you and your goddamn GameStop shit.
You're going the route of Nintendo now.
Alright, let's go to the Xbox 360 releases in Japan.
Japan also gets Devil May Cry this week.
Kind of one of those rare multi-regions in the same week.
Also a game called Heavy Fire Shattered Spear makes its way to Japan this week.
Both those games out on the 17th.
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, of course, as you can expect, Devil May Cry is out there as well.
Dream Seat Club Zero, special, it's not an edition, they have Edpion or something.
They do a little stylization, I think, with that.
Comes out this week on the PS3.
Bladestorm, The Hundred Years War, gets a price reduction.
Little Big Planet Karting hadn't come out in Japan until now.
It's finally coming out this week.
with that comes the move Racing Wheel and some games moving into the best series including Sengoku Musou 3 Empires because you know they loves their Dynasty Warriors on the Vita this week WRC 3 FIA World Rally Championship is the lone release this week on the PlayStation Vita
On the Wii U, nothing until January 31st.
It's pretty dry over there with new releases just like it is here.
Nothing on the 3DS either, so Nintendo's really slowed down this time of year, but same story over here, I guess.
How about the UK, DarkSakura?
Well, I would tell you if the site was actually loading.
Oh, wow.
Come on, you butthead.
Yes, I said butthead.
I called a website butthead.
I think I got it here.
No, no, no, it loaded.
On the 15th, we have Devil May Cry on the 16th, Retro City Rampage.
Yeah, that's it.
Slim pickings no matter where you live, but it's going to take a month for things to really ramp up again.
Devil May Cry is still a pretty big deal, so there you go.
Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys in the Classic Game of the Week.
Loki.
So, indie game developers are saying positive things about the Wii U eShop as opposed to what they were saying with the WiiWare service.
Apparently, Gaijin Games, Mike Rouse and Alex Noose were saying that, we don't know for sure, but it felt like that it wasn't taken seriously by Nintendo.
The desire for gamers to buy stuff digitally, and they're talking about, of course, the WiiWare service,
However, they're saying literally everything was easier this time around on the eShop.
What's more friendly right out of the starting gate is the Wii U is developed for people to have an eShop to spend their money in and buy games easily.
So, I don't know.
I mean, cool that they're doing some more stuff.
I mean, I don't know how this compares to, like, say, other platforms, but at least they're doing better than they were before.
I mean, that's like, I don't know, maybe going to the dollar store instead of Kmart.
I mean, I don't know if that's, you know, oh, well, it's not as crappy as Kmart, but...
It's still pretty crappy, but it's not as crappy, so I don't know how it really compares.
I'm still encouraged by some of these early things I'm hearing about the Wii U eShop and that maybe we're going to see some really cool things on it.
I don't know.
Do these indie developers get some preview codes so they can get them sent off for reviews, unlike the Xbox indie games?
Maybe.
I don't know.
I don't get to get those types of reviews, so I don't know.
But I can tell you I'm looking forward to the Zen pinballs coming out on the Wii U, and that looks to be really cool because they've got a Plants vs. Zombies table.
It would be neat.
Anyhow, speaking of Nintendo, one of the big stories from last year was that Nintendo Power shut down after all these years.
Well, the spirit of sorts lives on with Nintendo Force Magazine.
It is a new product from a group of Nintendo-focused journalists and artists.
Don't read into that that it was like the old Nintendo Power team, because that's not the case.
It's other types of journalists and fans from around the internet.
They have released Nintendo Force Magazine Here's the thing though, it's not your typical magazine It is one that you can get in PDF form for $5 Or you can get a collectible print for $18 I'm assuming, I'm left to assume, maybe DarkSakura knows more about this stuff than I do But I'm left to assume that probably because there isn't a huge demand for this Like, you know, it's not an international magazine or whatever It's something that's more homegrown
to kind of print these in a much smaller supply probably costs a little more money, and that's why it's going to cost you $18 to get an actual printed copy version of this.
In the first issue, though, Fire Emblem Awakening and Mutant Muds Deluxe, which is apparently a thing on 3DS or Wii U coming soon.
So there you go.
Alright, let's travel to a simpler time in games.
Let's go back to a time when, like, Nintendo Power was still around.
It's the classic game of the week, where DarkSakura's gonna step into the gaming vault, and she's gonna find a game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful brats, put down your Wii U's.
And mow my lawn.
Mow my lawn, and then maybe I'll let you play this game.
Or maybe you'll go get a phosphate.
This game isn't super old, but believe it or not, it's getting old.
That's why I picked it.
What is the classic game of the week, DarkSakura?
Silent Hill 3.
Because I've done Silent Hill 2, but I haven't done my favorite, so now I'm doing my favorite.
Yeah, and I picked the perfect thing to start off with, didn't I?
At least it wasn't wrong.
At any rate, Silent Hill 3 was done by Konami.
We all know this.
Developed by Team Silent.
And it came out in May 2003.
Now that it's, well, not quite 10 years old, but getting up to 10 years old.
So...
I can do it.
There was also a port to Windows done that I heard was absolutely wretched and haven't played yet.
And then a high def version that came out in 2012, but it's shit.
So it's 17 years after the original Silent Hill.
And basically he's raising Heather, who really isn't named Heather, but she's going by that name.
And she's got an interesting haircut and dyes her hair blonde.
She also does very interesting coordination with her jacket.
So in this one, like other Silent Hill games, there are different aspects to the game.
There is combat, you have exploration, and you have puzzle solving.
You know, as in little riddles to solve as you go through the game.
And of course, picking up maps and bonuses for doing certain things in the game the right way.
You can change the difficulty of your puzzles.
Um...
They're pretty difficult, though.
Some of them can be.
And even the really hard puzzle in that one requires that you know quite a bit of Shakespeare to solve.
You also get unlockable weapons and costume, which my favorite is the Magical Girl costume where she does Heather Beam.
Or as I say, Heza Beam!
Because even in the American version, she has a very thick Japanese accent for just that attack.
So you start off in the game at the mall and then Claudia finds out she's being stalked by a guy in a trench coat and then she goes and finds her dad.
I won't say what he's like because if you haven't played it by now he's dead.
And then she goes into Silent Hill.
Yay!
And there's like this whole plot to rebirth a god.
It has a lot to do, like I said, it's technically the sequel to the first Silent Hill.
It continues that story.
It has very, very interesting creatures in that game too.
And there's also a dude named Vincent.
Who isn't as cool as Vincent Valentine, but I won't go there.
So like I said, there's three endings.
You have the normal ending, you have a possessed ending, and the revenge ending.
Which, the revenge ending is actually the UFO ending.
That has the best Silent Hill song ever, Silent Hill no Uta.
Silent Hill, Silent Hill... Anyway, I know I've done it as a fortune cookie before, but I'm not doing it tonight.
So yeah, Silent Hill 2... Silent Hill 3, sorry, is seriously my favorite of the Silent Hill games because I love how much work went into it.
There's actually a full documentary on the making of this game that you can find on YouTube where they went all out for the voice acting.
They did...
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Like I was talking about the face models, they actually were drawn from references to real life actors and actresses so that they would look realistic.
The original name for Heather was actually Helen, but she was renamed Heather for her voice actress.
And she was modeled after a French actress, actually a couple of them, after Charlotte Gainsborough And another one that's actually very familiar to us, Vanessa Paradis Who was married to Johnny Depp for a while And did a very, very, actually a few really good songs So yeah, there was also now that Silent Hill Revelation 3D, which we were supposed to go see and never did Was based off of Silent Hill 3 There's always Blu-ray
Yeah, the Blu-ray's gotta be out really soon.
I'm totally getting it.
So yeah, there you go.
Sentinel 3.
And the source game for one of my favorite songs in DDR Extreme US.
Oh, the, um... You're not here.
Like, I can sing it, I don't know the name.
It was really good, the video and everything else, really good chart.
That was one of the better things to come out of Extreme US.
Not that that was a bad game, all things considered, minus the crappy disc wheel.
It was a really, really good game.
There is your classic game of the week.
And classic DDR reference of the week.
Yes, exactly.
Well, we have DDR references coming up in Part B tonight.
So don't go anywhere.
We got more Orange Launch Radio to come, including, apparently, a DDR reference.
Fugle Question of the Week, Rapid Fire News, your emails and your phone calls.
All when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio.
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live with episode number 489 of our show for this January the 13th of 2013.
Myself, Loki, and DarkSakura are joined in studio tonight with Jason and Rye who are visiting from Colorado as they have been.
And Jason, of course, I always like to acknowledge that without Jason we wouldn't have an OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
So thank you to Jason for all the work he does with that.
Always.
During the break, usually we don't talk about the break music because we can't play it due to copyright reasons.
But I've got to give a plug to this guy so the podcasters can seek him out too.
Because that remix that we played was great.
So please give this guy a plug here where everybody can hear it.
Aethernaut's original works are on Bandcamp.
Aethernaut.Bandcamp.com A-E-T-H-E-R-N-A-U-T.Bandcamp.com
same username on SoundCloud that remix is one since it's obviously not his original you can get that on SoundCloud SoundCloud.com slash Aethernaut let me for the sake of the podcasties let me play just a clip here because I can do clips let me play a clip of his remix of the moon that during the break that I was like wow this guy is like really cool
So what's that website again?
His bandcamp is aethernaut.bandcamp.com This song in particular is soundcloud.com slash aethernaut A-E-T-H-E-R-N-A-U-T Correct Nice stuff
Good times.
Good pick.
I should let you pick the break music every week.
Who discovered Aethernaut?
It was basically mutual.
We went to a chiptune showcase.
We were both there and we were both like, fuck yeah, dude.
And it was mine that I was playing while we were doing stuff before the show over here.
She was the one that actually had music running.
She got it introduced to me.
She'll get credit for that one.
You guys have good taste.
Alright, let's move on.
Rapid Fire News time.
Some quick news stories, starting off with Loki.
All right, so this is kind of cool.
They have this mod for Minecraft, and it allows someone to actually connect multiple worlds together.
Now, they have this before where you can create multiple worlds in Minecraft, but this is actually unifying servers.
And the guy that developed this, what was it?
I guess it's the MD5 proxy system, which is now called Bungee Cord, if you look for it on Bucket,
Basically, he has it set up now.
He's got a server with a lobby that allows 2,000 people in there.
And instead of searching for Minecraft servers and stuff that might be full, you go into this lobby and you pick a server out of there and you get all the information.
So it's almost like an MMO now where you can hop in and out of these servers and go with your friends and say, Hey, I'm going to go build on the VOG Minecraft server right now and then...
Let's hop out and we're going to go to a server that's running the Hunger Games minigame stuff.
Or, hey, I want to run to a server that's doing survival or something like that instead of creative.
And you can do that, which is pretty awesome.
So it's out there.
Not something I'm going to run on our Minecraft server because we have enough trouble filling up one server, let alone multiple servers.
And our server is whitelist only, which is important.
But I think that makes it very attractive to play on because you don't get griefers.
because if any of our listeners turn into griefers, I will beat you.
And also, it's logging whatever you do, so we will find you.
Don't be afraid to have fun.
Yeah, exactly.
I have rules listed, but come on.
It's just like, I'll let you do whatever as long as you don't fuck up someone else's shit.
Do I have a sign now?
In my little prairie dog town?
I don't even know where you are, so I haven't added you yet.
I live in a prairie dog town.
Well, once I find you, I'll add you or I'll show you how to do it.
I'll put nasty notes in front of your house.
My house is underground.
Which means you'll have to log in and finish your house.
Uber.
Can we make it snow in her house?
No, because my house is underground.
My doors are covered in glass.
Can I get lava to flow through her house?
No.
That's griefing.
You can make it snow in her house, actually.
Ah, there we go.
No snow in my house.
We're not going to.
My house is going to be constantly evolving which is why I'm building it underground.
About fucking time.
I mean, I guess they had to scrap all their plans when they rebuilt the whole fucking PSN a few years ago, but Jesus...
and then finally there's another bundle that you might be interested in this is called the free bundle and basically regardless of what you might want to pay for this bundle it's free and you can pick up five games from thefreebundle.com and these games are Nitronic Rush which is a cool survival driving game, Abobo's Big Adventure, yes that's right Abobo from
Downloaded it.
Yes, from Double Dragon.
And also, let's see, Ascension.
It's a side-scroller horror game, a celestial mechanica.
And see, that's, I guess, has some animation done by SuperCrateBox, Paul Veer.
And then I'm Scared, which they say is a self-professed Minecraft meets Slender game.
I was looking at it.
I didn't want it.
But they're all free for a limited amount of time.
Were you scared?
No, I was apathetic.
So the free bundle, in case the humble bundle is too expensive for you.
You know what the free bundle needs more of?
Because this game's free?
Frog Fractions.
Just saying.
And look, they added another game to the free bundle.
Now they have Treasure Adventure Island.
Or Treasure Venture Game.
So, that's cool.
Go download it for free.
And it's up for another 32 days.
XBOX 360
Buy it, send pictures, please.
Well, there's a little picture here.
I mean, this is more of a render, but it actually has like the little Xbox stripe along the bottom and it's like that green color or what have you.
If you buy this, by the way, should you buy the Volkswagen Xbox 360, you get an Xbox 360 with a copy of Forza 4.
What a deal.
Wow, Forza from like not 2012, but from the year before that, which I think is like a packing game now in some of their systems.
Earlier, somebody brought up Bayonetta, probably because you were talking about the Anarchy Reigns.
But Bayonetta, a lot of demand for Bayonetta to show up on the Wii U eShop because of the fact that Bayonetta 2 is going to turn up on Wii U, and people aren't necessarily going to be familiar with it unless they had a 360 or a PlayStation 3 and played through that.
So Platinum Games designer Hideki Kamiya was asked on Twitter, will the original Bayonetta come to Wii U?
And the response...
It's up to Sega or Ninty, which is Twitter speak for Nintendo.
So apparently it is completely up to Sega and Nintendo if that's going to happen or not.
So no pressure.
Make it happen.
Not gonna happen.
Not gonna happen, I agree.
One more story.
I had a few friends that were talking about this, and I thought this sounded really cool, and I watched a little bit of it, but not as much as like Flaco Jones and some other people I know that listen to the show.
It was the third annual Awesome Games Done Quick Marathon, raised more than $327,000 raised during this marathon.
I didn't see what, did I miss, what charity did that go for?
I want to know.
That's the most important part.
Oh, Prevent Cancer Foundation.
Oh, that's a very worthy cause.
Good job.
They played through more than 120 titles.
Everything from Skyrim to Echo the Dolphin.
Good times.
The viewers were also able to bid on items, make donations, and leave comments that could have possibly been read on air.
Lots of good stuff that they played through, and they did them quickly.
It's not just a clever name.
Yoshi's Island in almost 100% in like three hours.
They did games that don't take necessarily that long to beat, like Mario 64, because you could run through that without getting all the stars, although I don't know if they did 100% completion or whatever.
And then they did Final Fantasy IX.
Good lord.
How do you do an RPG quick?
Put Facebook and Google together and you get Google.
And that's the inspiration for this segment of our show where we ask a question of our listeners on Facebook and Google Plus fan communities.
And we read some of our favorite answers here on the air.
Here's the question this week.
There's been a lot of talk the past couple weeks about the potential and speculative, emphasis on that, negative influence that video games have on society.
But let's take a moment to talk about the good.
What are some of the good things that video games have done for you in your life?
I wanted to offset all this negativity going around this week about violent video games.
I want to hear the good stuff.
Let's give the media this to report on.
They won't.
On Google+, some of the good things that video games have done for you.
Actdeft, I'll summarize my answer in one word.
Inspire.
Flaco Jones says, my wife and I had video games in common at the early stages of our relationship and they continue to be a positive thing we bond over to this day.
That's really cute.
Kind of like Jamie and Dan.
You're a month early, Flaco.
It's a lot like us.
Even Alan and I do that.
We level characters together and wow.
We met over DDR.
Me and Ryan met over DDR.
But yet in Loki's relationship, that doesn't end up being the case, really.
No, not at all.
It just goes to show you everybody's a little bit different.
All right.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Redertainment says, video games fill a role in my life that other people fill with movies, TV, books, music, etc.
Video games ever entertain me.
Video games also save me money.
Think about how much entertainment you get per dollar with a 40 hour long video game as opposed to a 2-4 hour long movie.
That's a very good answer.
And then think of a book and a weep.
Alright.
I love this answer in our chat room.
Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room.
Video games let me meet all you wonderful people as well as Actdeft.
Ouch!
Ouch!
I've got my stuff up, by the way.
when I have a long day at work and get home I first greet my family and spend time with them but if it's a crazy stressful day I play video games a bit to de-stress it's the same as a person who reads a book or watches their favorite shows it calms them down and brings them to a better level
AZHP responds and says, Video games introduced me to pretty much all the friends I have now in one way or another.
When I decided to start playing DDR, I could have never have guessed that it would lead to me meeting a group of like-minded people who accepted me for who I am and created lifelong friendships that have lasted for as long as this show has been running.
It's true.
Without video games, I wouldn't have this show.
I probably wouldn't be podcasting.
I don't know.
I like the sound of my voice so much, though.
I would have discovered podcasting through another hobby, but...
Who knows?
I don't actually like hearing my own voice, so that's why I don't listen to us.
Really?
Yeah, that's true.
I think that's why I was so timid, especially last time I was here.
The tough thing, though, about it is that I'm my own worst critic.
I don't hate to hear my own voice, but I'll listen to myself and I'll go, Oh, you sound so... What the hell were we talking about?
No, I'm actually...
But anyway, let's see, more answers.
Wendy S., I think video games have taught me about the sports whose games I play, FIFA, NBA 2K.
They also keep your mind and reflexes sharp as you grow older.
I honestly believe due to video games, there will be less dementia among seniors in the future if you assume current gamers will keep playing as they age.
Finally, I wanted to note that I think when teenagers attain positions of responsibility in their guild or clan, it teaches them leadership and responsibility.
I like the angle that it keeps your certain skills up so that when you get old, you don't lose them.
We see this a lot.
Well, I don't know how much you guys go to old folks' homes, but they do like Wii bowling and that stuff is still something they do.
And a lot of that is to, I mean, we might laugh, like play a better game, old guy, but it kind of still keeps all that function going.
Yeah.
My grandma's in one of those places and I was looking at the calendar and they had Wii Bowling Night every Monday.
It was something else.
I wasn't laughing at you.
I was laughing at a comment in chat.
What was the comment that made you laugh?
Who said it?
Ragenator says, I agree with Rob Roberts.
He does love the sound of his own voice.
I'm sexy, damn it.
Not as much as I love Dubstep Bird.
All right.
I closed the window.
Damn it.
All right.
James S replies and says, I know I've read somewhere lately that there were a few scientific tests done by a university that had proven that gaming actually strengthened your brain in areas that are vital for everyday life.
Anything from basic motor skills to depth perception to decision making.
Games aren't the culprit for these random acts of violence.
Violence has always been there.
Gaming hasn't.
It's just that some people are sick and need help Simple as that You know, that's a really damn good way of looking at it Violence has always been there Gaming hasn't Although one could argue You know, chess has been around a long time But I get what you're saying I totally get what you're saying, dude That's a good point
DarkTetsuya says, even before you guys started OLR, there was a time?
Even before you guys started OLR, I met you guys via the epic music game Parties that were thrown back in early 2000.
Not gonna lie, I miss those days.
Playing Beatmania 2DX till the sun came up the next day, good times.
Oh, how many days we had like that, right, Jason?
Do you still have a lot of those old games, DarkSakura?
I have every single Bimani game I've ever purchased.
You know, one of these days, for old time's sake, we need to have... That should be the freaking game marathon.
Have an old school... Our pajama party?
All night long.
Our pajama party?
Oh, yeah.
We're not supposed to talk about that on air.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Put Ixnay on the Illopipe Fae.
I didn't say anything about that.
Okay.
I know.
Anyway.
I think we should do a drunk DDR Fest.
That'd be awesome.
I've played DDR drunk before and I nearly busted my head open on somebody's clothes washer.
Thank you for watching!
All right, anyways, yeah, so, yeah, DDR, well, I have two DDR pads.
I think I sold the game, so, but I sold the pads that have never been used.
They're still there.
I wonder what else is in it.
Oh, I also dug through the closet.
I have a lot more game, like, main cabinet buttons and stuff from when I was going to make, you know, all the Bomani, you know, controllers and stuff for it.
I have a ton of crap in there.
It's ridiculous.
We have a full-size pop-in controller still.
We have, I think, four 2DX controllers.
Yeah, it should be two American, two Japanese.
You know, I actually found an official Konami PlayStation dance pad at the thrift store.
I got a DDR story coming up.
We can reminisce more, but I want to get to what more listeners said.
Okay, just let me know when I can read my rapid fire.
We'll get to it, I promise.
Okay.
See, all I did is I just switched that with that and we'll just keep going.
All right.
Live radio, it's an adventure.
Burr replies and says, Video games have taught me history, given me an appreciation for music and art, introduced me to friends around the world, and inspired my imagination for almost 30 years now.
What has watching endless cable television news and punditry done for the people on the other side of the table?
Here, here.
Comedians?
That was the appropriate level of bitchiness that an answer needs.
Frame it.
Cut, print.
That's a great answer.
All these answers are so good tonight.
I'm reading them all.
I don't care.
This show's running long.
I don't care.
We'll do it live.
Yeah, fuck it.
We'll do it live.
Ragenator.
Well, here's three ways they help me.
One, in terms of games like first-person shooters, Call of Duty, Halo, they help me vent.
If I'm pissed off at whomever, it's better to take it out virtually.
Whom?
Awesome!
It's better to take it out virtually, rather IRL, for a whole host of reasons.
Two, gaming serves as a social outlet, contrary to what older generations would have you believe, and online gaming is a lot cheaper than other things, such as a night out drinking with friends.
Thank you!
Ain't that the truth.
Do you know how much drinks cost at the bar?
Yes.
For like, I could get a Long Island iced tea top shelf or a month of WoW.
I get it.
I get it.
Three, online gaming gives you an opportunity to meet other people that odds are you wouldn't otherwise meet or conversely, it, like Facebook, helps you maintain friendships with those that move out of your area.
Unlike Facebook, though, one can do more than talk via text.
Thank you.
Welcome.
All right.
That was for Ragenator.
All right.
Tiger Claw says, Video games have been a part of my life ever since I was a kid.
I know for a fact that you should never, ever take video games seriously.
They provided me with hours of entertainment and also great during times when you're feeling down or bored.
Gamer Girl says, I suffer from major depressive disorder, and ever since I was a kid, it's been my way to shut things out until I'm ready to deal with them.
This is a heavy answer.
It's like a way for me to be someone else for a while until I'm ready to deal with what's going on.
And not only that, but it helped my reflexes as a kid due to being disabled.
So it's always helped me deal with real life in some way or another and always good.
Why don't they fucking read that on Fox News?
Because it doesn't suit their agenda.
Sorry, I just had this moment of like... I'm angry now.
I'm not angry at you, Gamer Girl.
I think you're great.
That answer is just so powerful.
It's like...
I just, I'm speechless.
It bears repeating, doesn't it?
You got, Gamer Girl, you got me to shut up.
Congratulations.
You got me to shut up with that.
I've been trying that for years.
Lastly, DDR Dollar Bill If it wasn't for DDR, I wouldn't have become more social and outgoing This is heavy stuff, guys Too long to tell this story, but the game was responsible for reigniting my desire for dancing and music I do love gaming, though I do want a future where games are more interactive Waits for the usual crap about go play football or some other sport Just not where the game is bad A fighting game that you actually have to move?
Ha!
Well, the holodeck's only a matter of time away
I read every single answer tonight You don't have to visit Facebook or Google Those are all great answers Maybe there'll be some late coming answers later You should still join our communities on Facebook Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio And Google Plus Search for Orange Lounge Radio Alright Want to know what my answer to that one is?
Please And it's very specific Please Super Mario RPG taught me rhythm Before anything else did
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
The first time I tried it, AB, AB, AB, AB, mash the buttons.
Why isn't it doing anything?
And one of the Yoshis gives you a hint or something like that, talks about that you go with the backbeat of the song.
It's like...
All that.
Alternate in time and your Yoshi runs away.
And it was just like the simplest thing, but that was what really sealed the deal.
And, you know, music games came along after the fact to really turn that into its own little world, but that was the first time that music had something specific instead of just being...
The art as it is.
It's really the only way that I can describe it.
I remember that very distinctly, that things just felt different after an example of the backbeat in Super Mario RPG.
For me, video games gave me this.
I mean, for real.
I know we joked about it a minute ago.
Video games gave me this.
And this is almost an extension of when I was growing up, I got picked on a lot.
Can't imagine why.
But for real, guys, I got called fag and all those dirty words you can possibly imagine a lot.
And then it's like those same kids would turn around and ask me for advice on video games.
Like, how do I get to the second quest in Zelda?
Or how do I find level nine in the second quest?
Like, you know, come meet me behind the building.
You know, like that type of thing where it's like, I don't want the other kids to see that I'm talking to you, but I know you're the video game expert.
It's like, and in some ways, this is almost an extension of that.
I'm still talking to people about video games.
I might not be as good at them as I used to be, but here I am with a bunch of, like, awesome, like-minded people.
It's just...
I know.
I know, I know.
Especially you, Jamie.
Especially me.
Well, and an extension on the inspiration part, it has me writing, it has me drawing.
You know, there's so much that it brings.
Yeah, go read a book.
A book will do the same thing.
But I think just the visual part of it, having somebody else's characters that you can kind of run free with kind of helps too.
Absolutely.
Original works, original inspirations.
DERBY OWNERS CLUB
I missed Derby Owners Club.
They got rid of the one at Dave & Buster's.
Our local one.
I didn't see it last time I was there.
Do you still have your card with your horse named Glue?
I have my binder.
Yeah, I do have a horse named Glue.
You had Politary.
So you could whip Politary.
Politary is sad because Rob beat her too hard.
Anyway, so Lego Marvel Super Heroes is going to be coming out and I'm very happy.
It's got an original storyline where Nick Fury needs the help of Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and other heroes to stop Loki and Galactus.
That's a team I would never have seen together, Loki and Galactus.
I would think Galactus would be too busy eating planets to deal with the Norse god whose planet he wants to eat.
Also next up, Capcom Arcade Cabinet has been confirmed for the West.
Ooh.
Dan will be happy.
Dan will be really happy.
Capcom.
Capcom.
And then, last but not least, LittleBigPlanet 2 Extras Edition is announced.
And it will have the recently released cross-controller pack.
So let's use the Vita as a controller and the move pack, Rise of the Cakeling.
And all kinds of fun stuff.
However, I don't believe it has what date it's going to be out on.
So yeah, that's it.
All right.
And now I've got more stuff to do, don't I?
No, we're going to Loki next.
Well, I've got stuff to do.
Soon, soon.
Yes.
So there was, of course, this lawsuit in place from Gamefly who was saying they were getting unfair treatment for their packages going out.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and so it actually they ruled in favor of Gamefly and basically told you know the US Postal Service that hey you guys need to either fix this or you need to let us know you know
Tell us, what's going on?
Why are you guys doing this?
I mean, it's obvious that, you know, they're doing this stuff and, you know, these companies aren't paying you any extra money to have this preferential treatment.
Now, you either got to do it for everybody or do it for no one.
So, interesting.
Hopefully, that means less broken DVDs in the mail.
I don't know.
Have you ever gotten anything from, you know, Gamefly that was smashed?
No.
Yeah, so...
Everything's worked fine for me.
Maybe it's just like more metropolitan areas where there's a lot more mail.
Maybe.
I live in an apartment complex.
It's not like they handle the mail totally well around here sometimes.
It works.
Moving on, I promised you some DDR talk.
Here you go.
Dance Dance Revolution Classroom Edition made an appearance at CES this year.
Konami and United Healthcare Group teaming up to bring this.
I thought that was kind of an interesting partnership between Konami and an insurance company.
But they brought the game to the show to show it off.
I got to tell you what surprised me about it is that it was neat kind of seeing like new DDR.
And I was looking at it going...
Why did they, like, stop the console editions?
Like, this is an interesting direction that they were going.
I mean, granted, DDR is DDR, but I thought it was kind of cool.
I mean, 48 people can play this game at once.
That's like two PE classes or depending on whatever school you go to, right?
And you look at it and they've got one, you know, one tunnel or what do you call that?
The area where the notes scroll up.
Did they ever have a term for that?
The...
scroll bar whatever the area where the notes scroll up there's three of them one for beginners intermediates and advanced all at the same time so I'm assuming that means that people who aren't as good as DDR can play like the beginner ones and people who are getting better can play the advanced ones so everybody can kind of play together I thought that was kind of neat
Apparently, the wireless dance pads are made by Performance Design Products, and they can actually track a dancer's progress, steps, body mass index, and how many calories you burn through what is a plug-in smart card.
BMI is still bullshit.
Then why is a PDP putting these out then for consumers to buy if they're making some decent dance pads, you know what I mean?
I know, I was kind of looking at it going, this is something I wouldn't mind having in my house, actually.
I could play with people over the internet or something.
Konami has launched this game three schools in Florida, Georgia, and Texas, I guess are the test ground for this.
There is a whole video, it looks like Polygon actually did an interview on the floor with some of the people that were showing it, so you can check that out at Polygon.com.
They actually have a whole little video in their section.
and yeah, it was kind of neat to look at.
It made me miss the dinner days a little bit.
It did.
There's a lot that's really interesting about that concept that makes sense.
It throws out all of these expected mechanisms of DDR out the window that who gives two shits about accuracy?
Pick whatever is interesting for you, change on the fly and the important part of what you have to do is still available.
You're still on a dance pad, you're still moving around, you're still doing something and getting that sort of feedback
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
The only thing I don't like about it is you can't tell, you drift on those types of pads when you can't tell where the actual arrows are versus everything else.
But it would still be nice to buy one, you know, if it's going to work pretty well.
Obviously, if you're using it in a PE class, it's got to work somewhat okay.
And hell, I mean, we played on soft pads attached to a piece of wood with laminate over the top of them.
I mean, I'm assuming that that would work.
It worked okay then.
Yeah, they did look like the ignition pads to me because from a distance I thought they were metal pads and I was like, damn, this thing's going to be expensive.
But yeah, it was more the big, fluffy, but thick, those pads that Red Octane used to do before they got into Guitar Hero business.
There you go.
All right.
So, moving on.
Did your computer go boom again?
All right, so let's move on to the next.
Let's just skip it and come back to it, Loki.
All right.
Let's see, we've got an interesting patent for PlayStation.
Man, what is with PlayStation coming out with some really strange-ass patents?
But this one now, they've got a patent for the Move.
It looks like a new Move controller.
And the differences with the new controller versus the old one...
One that's going to have some sort of interchangeable faceplates.
So, for example, you can have the four directional buttons on there or you can have the XO square triangle buttons.
Also, it kind of looks like an ice cream scoop almost.
Well, they look like them anyway.
Yeah.
But instead of having the buttons actually on the side of the pad, it kind of like your hand would be behind the ball, I guess.
Yeah.
and then what's also weird about it is they've got these foot attachment things and then in the most ridiculous image for a patent ever they have some dude with like four move controllers because I'm gonna really buy four move controllers for $40 each doing a fucking like flip kick for a soccer game
He's got those things attached to his shoes.
That is nuts.
Yes, like, I mean, that's just fucking ridiculous.
No one's going to do that.
You're going to kill yourself.
And then we're going to see that on Fox News.
Video gamer kills self while playing FIFA, attempting to do a flip kick, hits, you know, coffee table, dies.
Or how about kicks the 80-inch television right off the wall.
Or somebody else nearby.
You know, kickboxing game, move controller flies off foot, some weird shit happens.
Gamer loses leg in freak accident kicking fan.
Let's just put it this way, okay?
I don't know why they're having some sort of... This is the patent, but I hope that, God, this is not... This isn't what they're bringing for PlayStation 4.
Hey!
You like those move controllers?
Well, guess what?
We're gonna strap them to every orifice of your body.
That's right.
We're gonna track all of those naughty bits.
Does this really solve the very first instances of this?
Sony recently filed a patent that describes a method for determining the location of a PlayStation Move-like controller through a sound capturing device.
If it's obscured by something in the way, like a body, if you're spinning, if you're moving, does sound really solve the problem?
That's how they do it right now.
It uses sound, I think, for part of it because they've got so many microphones in the actual PlayStation Eye camera that I thought that's what it was using.
I thought it was just light.
A special wavelength that the camera can see a rotation difference.
It's a little bit of both, I think.
I do know that for voice or something, it's supposed to be able to track you or track something.
It's got like five microphones in that thing.
I could just see Kazariety3 talking about, you know, now on the PlayStation 4 it comes with four move controllers.
Let me show you a demo now.
I will take one controller and put them in each hand and I will shake them up and down.
Then I will insert the third move controller into my mouth where I will rock back and forth.
The fourth move controller I will shove into my anus.
Let's play SingStar.
Let's play SingStar.
Take on me.
Take on me.
It just, I mean, I'm sorry.
Oh, big!
Okay, I got it.
Here's the thing, okay.
The move controller, it's, I think the move is not that bad, but, you know, what they're showing with this patent here is basically, you know, they're saying that the controller's got some, you know, the swappable face buttons and stuff, and that, you know, I don't know.
I don't think they really know much other than looking at the pictures, but those controllers look a little weird.
And I know they've tried the leg strap stuff.
Hell, they've tried that with the Wii.
And I know they have some fitness games where you can get a leg strap so they can tell that you're running or something like that.
But I guess this thing was a determination of controller three-dimensional location using image analysis and ultrasonic communication.
So I thought that's how it worked already, though.
I mean, I don't understand what they would be doing differently in this one.
Thank you, SSJ100Matt, for getting my reference.
It's Mr. Garrison's gyro cycle thing in that episode of South Park.
That's exactly what I was thinking about with the whole PlayStation Move patent.
Don't watch it, wouldn't know.
Anyhow, it's for the best, Jason, that you don't watch it.
All right, moving on.
Let's go back to what we had to skip over.
Jamie.
Jamie.
Okay, more news about the Ouya, actually.
Basically, they've figured out that since it already runs Android games, it will run emulated games, too.
So people who already have Ouya boards are basically putting up videos that show them playing Street Fighter.
Street Fighter and Mario 64 are already running on the Ouya.
I think I said this on this show.
When we bought our Wii, you know what the very first thing was that I did?
Emulate?
Played Mario 64.
A very yes to this.
I am so excited, actually.
Emulators might sell me to you.
And?
Based on the video, they run well.
Yeah, the video was nice.
I looked at it, too.
All I have to say?
Oh, yeah.
Y'all right over there?
Do you need a move controller to enhance the experience?
I get the Mario 64 song stuck in my head and it lasts.
It doesn't go away.
I hope it runs the 64 games.
That means I can play F-Zero even though I can kind of... You know what that means?
It means Macross Crystal Dreams.
Because that game only exists emulated.
and Star Fox 2 if it'll do SNES emulation.
Star Fox 2.
You know what else it means?
Yet another emulator with the most unworkable controller for the system with the most unworkable controller.
Yes!
Here it is running on the OUYA.
Multiplayer GoldenEye over the internet.
Yeah, that should be Android possible.
Come on.
Moving on, where are we at?
Oh, speaking of virtual console, what a nice transition.
You're welcome.
The Wii U Virtual Console games.
They will be playable on the gamepad.
You know, eventually.
A representative for Nintendo said that there is plans to make a Wii U Virtual Console game playable on the new controller solely.
Which, of course, has the touchscreen on it.
Not that the touchscreen is going to do you any good, but it's still a way that you can have your Virtual Console game and you can play it on the TV or then somebody wants to watch Oprah or whatever.
You can move it to the...
I have a better idea.
What?
How about a native Wii U Pokemon title that features both screens at all times or as much as possible?
I've got a crazy idea too.
What if Pokemon X and Y came out for the 3DS and the Wii U?
That you can buy your portable games on the Wii U or you can buy them on your 3DS and they are playable on the Wii U and the 3DS.
That's madness though, I'm sure.
All right.
Does that mean it's time for Mailbag?
I'm trying to get it to load.
I'm all twisted up.
I have it up if you need me as a backup.
Do you want me to move on?
We'll come back to Mailbag?
Okay.
I'm just improvising tonight, y'all.
Let's move on to the FUs of the week.
What an appropriate time with computer issues to go to the FUs of the week.
Need I Ask, DarkSakura, what she's mad about?
Fuck my netbook.
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.
May I have more chocolate?
You absolutely may have more chocolate.
Thank you.
It's in the fridge.
Loki.
I viewed myself forgetting to mention that I guested up this week on the Down for Maintenance podcast with Codeman and friends.
Oh, shame.
That's the whole reason you go on other podcasts is to promote your own appearance.
Yes, but now I'm promoting my own appearance.
You should mention that at the top of next week's show too.
Give those guys some love.
We'll do it.
It was a lot of fun.
Alright, good deal.
I haven't listened to the whole episode yet.
I want to though.
My review of the week goes to Rush Limbaugh.
Because what an asshole.
What an asshole.
I'm not even going to repeat what he said.
If you've been reading the news, you know what he said.
What an asshole.
Don't Google it, please.
Don't give him more attention.
He's an asshole.
That's all you need to know.
Jason.
Jason.
I'll second that F you for you because I really don't have anything better.
And it's always worth it.
He's twice the asshole I thought he was.
Right.
Fuck you to my job.
Fuck you to retail.
Fuck you to my boss.
Yes.
Store boss, not immediate boss.
Yes, store boss, not my immediate boss.
I love my immediate boss.
It's always the quiet ones that are the angstiest, isn't it?
Fuck it.
Suddenly she's become a level 64 renegade, so look out.
Alright, moving on.
By the way, I finally found my favorite renegade option in Mass Effect 2.
Yes?
Making the guy that poisons you drink his own drink.
That was fun.
Good times.
I got mail up, by the way.
You did get mail up.
Oh.
Well then, you know what that means.
I play the mail theme and I talk about every week.
DarkSakura dives in the mail bag and she pulls out a couple emails that she feels like reading.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.
And you should send us more because we've only got two emails this week.
That is sad.
It's actually a good thing that we only got two because it's so much easier to open up my iPad that way.
That's true.
But still.
I had a backup.
And probably I'm going to be absent from chat for a while until I get a new laptop.
Dude, learn to spell grammar.
Okay.
Grammar is spelled G-R-A-M-M-A-R, not E-R.
I have to say sorry about the grammar last email.
Maybe in this one, but one, I agree with Rob.
I like Majora's Mask way better.
I may have spelled it wrong.
No, you spelled it right, but you didn't capitalize anything.
To be fair, I'm really happy you agree with me, but I think they're kind of both overrated.
Sorry, not sorry.
I didn't like Skyward Sword because I didn't like the art direction.
I liked Twilight Princess' art style.
I also hated how empty the Skyworld was.
Also how there was only like three different places to explore.
Also, my biggest thing I dislike is the motion plus.
It worked with Wii Sports Resorts, but not for a Zelda game.
That was a whole sentence, by the way.
Oh, and that came from, I guess, Chris.
Somebody.
Chris is cool.
I think I mentioned in November that I've started watching a lot of video game related videos on YouTube video series.
And Game Grumps, Continue Show, a lot of the things by their friends, I'll watch one off, two off, but I'm really subscribed and dedicated to Game Grumps right now and Continue Show.
Um...
When they were playing the Zelda adventure game in Nintendo Land, they were saying that that whole game's play mechanics is better than the whole of Skyward Sword as far as Wii motion controls are concerned.
I say that incidentally because I haven't actually played Skyward Sword, but I did play a bit of the Nintendo Land setup, and it was quite fun.
It was simple.
I don't know how it expands to full-screen Zelda, but it just seems fun.
Okay, I guess I don't have a point to that spiel.
Second email!
Second email comes from Raginator.
Hi, OLR.
It's your friendly neighborhood prankster, Raginator.
For this week's email, I thought I'd broach a non-gaming geek-centric topic.
As many people in the VOG community already know, I'm disabled and as a result living on SSD with ample free time on my hands.
Due to this, I often find myself lost in thought, usually about random-ass stuff related to physics.
Well, all of that being said, I had an epiphany not too long ago related to physics, specifically about dark matter, and I'd like to write a thesis on it.
However, I do have one hurdle to overcome.
My math skills are not advanced enough to write the paper.
I never took calculus.
That was your first typo.
Congratulations.
Your grammar has been astounding.
He missed one of the E's in never.
He spelled N-V-E-R.
Sorry, I thought the email needed Warholic.
Oh, and thought.
Here's the next one.
My thought here is to perhaps collaborate with someone in a university that has a working knowledge of physics and calculus.
Now my questions for you are as follows.
Does this route sound feasible to you?
And how would I go about this?
I'm sure I can't very well just waltz in and say, hey, want to do a thesis with me?
If my epiphany that I had works out as well as I think it will, it could be very well groundbreaking.
Craigslist.
Seriously?
Sorry, one more time the question?
Sorry, I got distracted.
Okay.
DarkMatter DarkMatter
Call heads of, call deans of physics departments.
Call various schools that are in your area and make an appointment to speak with people and ask them about it.
Take a class here and there.
Community colleges offer physics courses.
And talk to your teacher after class.
If it's something that you're truly interested in doing, especially since you have tons of free time on your hand,
Fuck.
Go to school!
And they might fester a little less.
Done.
Good feedback, DarkSakura.
Good job, despite your computer issues with the email bag tonight, I must say.
Hey, I'm trying.
That's why I got this thing.
It just doesn't work for running everything.
All right, let's jam through these couple last stories here, and we'll get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Not yet.
Don't call yet, but we'll let you know.
Loki.
Loki.
Razer Project Fiona Razer's Edge
It's got these, like, analog handle things.
But now it is available... Actually, I should say it's available without that for $1,000 for the base model, the i5-1, or $1,300 for the pro model, which is a Core i7.
But this is a tablet that actually runs PC stuff.
It's got Windows 8 on it.
It's got, you know, a gaming card in it.
In fact, actually, it's got a pretty high-end NVIDIA card in there.
I was kind of surprised about that, which I...
kind of brought up the point that, so does this thing run as hot as like the surface of the sun?
Because if it's got like, you know, some mobile 640 processor or something like that, um, I have no kind of clue how this thing would run cool.
Cause fuck my laptop.
I had to do all sorts of cooling mods to get the run somewhat cool and it still runs hot.
Um,
I don't know.
It's interesting.
If you're interested, though, they are, I think, taking pre-orders for it.
I don't think they've announced a date when it's going to be available.
Oh, I'm sorry.
The base model is available now, but the pro model is coming later.
They're saying that the $1,300 one can run Dishonored at 60 frames per second.
which I don't think that's that processor intensive of a game so it's I don't know but it's an option I guess if you really want to spend that kind of money honestly though if you're gonna spend $1,300 on something you probably get a laptop that's just as nice for a lot cheaper just saying you don't need a tablet for everything or you can actually I actually was looking you can make your own tablet be fun
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yes, Shaq Fu.
You heard me, Shaq.
Like Shaquille O'Neal?
Yeah.
Shaq Down, a 2D side-scrolling action game.
It actually does star Shaq, or Shaquille O'Neal, of course.
It came out for iOS and Android.
In the game, you battle zombies across three stages and bosses and all that stuff.
It was developed by Hiptic Games and published by One Spear Entertainment.
That's what everybody said, that's what the users want
More Shaq games?
I don't think that's what they say.
Although they do have, you know, was it Shaq Fu?
The Skype line is open.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
Sorry, Loki, go ahead.
Shaq Fu was the Gaiden one.
Nice.
And then the sequel to that.
One of those stupid long names, Shaq Fu, the something ultimate Grand Alpha Z Gaiden.
VidPower in our chat room, Shaq Fu Gaiden was awesome.
JackFu and Awesome
Good, good.
How are you today?
I'm all right.
Thanks for asking.
What's on your mind, buddy?
I just wanted to call in and talk about CES.
Did you go?
I did.
I did.
That's right.
You're in Vegas.
It's in your backyard.
It is.
It is.
It's really easy to get there.
You don't have to put up with traffic.
Now, Bobby on his show calls this the Consumer Electronics Show, which is not open to consumers.
But you snuck in through the back door or you work somewhere that got you in or what?
I kind of snuck in.
I snuck in every year.
Fair enough.
Wow, this is like the Renegade report on Consumer Electronics Show.
See, VOG can't afford to send anybody, so we just have people sneak in.
I'm just kidding.
This wasn't endorsed by VOG.
All right.
VidPower, tell us about what you saw at CES.
Yeah, well, you know, since Microsoft wasn't there at CES this year, the amount of video games are pretty... Well, CES isn't really known for video games anyway, but like this year, there were just like a small handful of games that were showing off.
And so, not much.
The big games were over at Sony's booth.
God of War Ascension that were showing off was probably like the main big thing, but...
They had a bunch of other demos, like the new Super game was there.
They had that Book of Spells game that they were demoing.
Did you get to see 120-inch television sets that just made everything look, oh my god?
Yeah, yeah, I did.
I did see one of those new 4K television sets with the crazy, huge, clear resolution stuff.
Do we need that?
No, you don't.
But it's pretty cool looking at it.
I was at Fry's just last night with Alan very randomly.
We were just over there kind of killing time.
And we were looking at some of their really nice TVs.
And, like, the new TVs, they're not even 4Ks.
They're just, like, the HD TVs, but, like, the newer type of plasma or whatever.
And they were showing on Blu-ray Speed Racer was on one of them.
And it was so, like, it just looked fake.
And I realized, like, Speed Racer wasn't exactly, you know, real to begin with.
But, like...
you can tell that shit was done on a computer same thing with the Avengers was showing on another one of the TVs and I was like you can really see like you can really tell computer versus real this is like jaw-dropping how like the ultra precision of it all almost ruins the movie magic a little bit
It does, it does.
Sometimes it looks a little like too... a bit fake with all that computer that they put in there.
Yeah, yeah.
Sometimes it does look a bit fake.
But yeah, you know, they had a display of a Blu-ray playing on a TV next to one of these 4K televisions.
And I guess if you...
Did you see the classroom DDR thing?
I did, I did see DDR Classroom Edition Did you check it out?
I did, I did.
So they had a demo on, it was a pretty giant screen, and it had like seven of these wireless pads all set up for just random people to come play on it.
And I, being an old school DDR person...
I went up and I tested out this pad.
It's surprisingly good.
It didn't slip at all.
I don't know if they put anything under the pad or what, but I was just doing the expert level steps.
Yeah?
And yeah, it didn't slip at all.
It definitely had the problem...
Red Octane Ignition 2.0 Pads
Was the music in it all old school, or was it kind of mixed with contemporary stuff?
You know what?
It was all licensed American music, so there were no Konami originals or Japanese stuff.
It was really Americanized.
No Butterfly?
No.
How am I supposed to show everybody in my PE class my patented Kyle Snyder spin?
I was a bit disappointed.
I was like, oh, okay.
We saw that Uber song list.
Yeah, they have a ton of songs.
Anyway, I guess they'll have to stick with Lady Gaga and Rihanna or whatever.
Awesome.
Well, it sounds like you had a good time at CES.
Since you are a consumer who somehow got into Consumer Electronics Show and it is about trying to get you to buy something, is there anything you walked out of the show going, I might buy that?
Not really.
CES is more really... Success!
What a successful expo.
CES is really more about technology to have in the back of your mind, but a lot of it's not...
Ready for consumers, yeah, you know, most likely in the price level of all this stuff.
Yeah, CES is for rich people, not the people who have to sneak in.
E3, just like E3 is technically supposed to be for a lot of shops to be able to pick up publishers, CES is meant, these are the technologies that you can offer to consumers and you get bits and pieces of it or good ideas, but it's not, it's technology for consumers, not best buy convention extreme technology.
Pretty much, pretty much.
Yeah, that's a really accurate statement.
It's more of like technology that's like ready for consumer in like three to four years from now.
All right.
Well, VidPower, I should probably let you go to try and get another call here before the night's over.
But thanks for the report from CES.
No problem.
No problem.
Anytime.
All right.
You take care, buddy.
Have a great week.
Later.
All right.
Bye.
It's nice to hear from VidPower.
I haven't heard from him in a while, even though I want to know more about how he got in.
That sounds a little sneaky there.
Excuse me, while we wait for more calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
Getting some Twitter topics out here.
TigerClaw on Twitter sending us a tweet to a story.
Yes, I heard about this.
It's not really gaming per se, but it's just kind of lulzy.
You know there's that site where you can do a petition to the White House, and if it gets so many signatures, they have to respond to it or whatever?
Yeah.
Well, there was that whole petition to build a Death Star.
The White House replied this week and said no.
But I thought it was a very clever answer because it talked about we can't afford that kind of debt and this administration does not support blowing up other planets.
That was my favorite response ever.
That was great.
It was great.
An amazing response.
Alright, let's go to the phones and take another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey guys, this is Degenerate Johnny.
Degenerate Johnny, what's on your mind, buddy?
Not much.
Can't complain.
Well, actually, I do have a complaint to Brad from PodCulture for getting me addicted to that fireball whiskey.
It's very cinnamon.
The influence of VOG is spreading.
I love it.
That just makes me shudder.
Yuck.
Amazing.
Well, sadly, Brad from PodCulture told me he wasn't listening live tonight, but hopefully he'll catch that on the podcast.
Good old hardy FU.
Yeah, it's all good.
As a matter of fact, I'm using it for the Orange Island Radio drinking game.
So what else do you have in mind, buddy?
Basically, well, I wanted to touch up on the whole video game violence thing.
I'm a little afraid right now of the timing of this because...
I'm playing Dead Space 1 and 2 in preparation for Dead Space 3.
And my problem is that this is, aside from Devil May Cry, this is one of the AAA titles that's coming out since the shooting.
And Visceral Games has a tendency of pushing the envelope, of putting...
certain adversaries in their games, namely babies and children.
If you looked at their past three games, Dante's Infernal, Dead Space, and Dead Space 2.
And so my problem is, well, I'm a little scared about this, is if they decide to do that again in Dead Space 3, would we see more irate type of backlash from fans?
We haven't really received it beforehand, but in light of the shooting, this might come up and say Visceral, it puts in the six-year-old or seven-year-old pack hunters in the game or the exploding babies.
I'm just a little afraid that there might be a little blackout clash if they decide to do that.
Yeah, I hear what you're saying, and I agree with you to a point that it's like now would be a great time to just show a little restraint, but at the same time, somebody's going to push the envelope.
And if it's not these guys, then guess what will end up on Fox News eventually?
It'll be that game that the guys made about Columbine or whatever, the controversial thing that came out some time ago.
There's always going to be somebody pushing the envelope, but at the same time, that's what the First Amendment is for.
and you know I think I've heard this argument before is that you know what you know we might want to put all these restrictions but what amendment or I'm sorry what lengths are we willing to go to sacrifice the First Amendment to you know spare all these others or what have you.
Drama is going to unfold as a result of this but it's not going to be any different than what we've been dealing with for the past decade.
I sort of have a feeling, I don't know, the cynic in me sort of thinks you are going to start to see some type of legislation about violent video games very similar to how you have motion pictures.
In reality, they would just mirror the freaking motion picture thing.
You know, no one under 17 admitted without parent or guardian or whatever.
But then again, the Motion Picture Association needs to be reformed.
Now would be a great time to examine all of that because the MPAA is kind of shit.
And the way they look at things and that violent movies can be, you know, rated R, no problem, and kids can get in, but...
Show a penis and oh my god, not safe for anybody, right?
It's like this weird, weird, you know, kind of bullshit.
So now would be a great time to evaluate all of that.
But I think it's inevitable.
You're gonna see some type of parental controls on this where there's gonna be certain type of games you don't buy without a driver's license.
I just, or some type of identification.
I just think that is inevitable.
But it's also a little bit naive because with the internet, you can get anything.
You know, how are you gonna,
How are you going to regulate an M-rated game on the internet?
It's going to be a lot harder.
Oh yeah, absolutely.
And since we're all going towards digital distribution, that's kind of the reality.
Movies are going that way too.
Yep.
Marissa Congusto in chat says, Most likely there will be a threat of legislation and the industry will censor itself.
I'm totally with you there, Marissa, but that kind of already happened in the mid-90s.
That's how we have the video game rating system we have now.
It was the first time we went through all this crap in the mid-90s.
And that was when the record industry did the whole explicit lyrics thing.
And Walmart stopped carrying them.
All of that happened.
And the way I interpret what Biden was saying is that I think he acknowledges that the ESRP is by far far more responsible than the...
I think he's basically hinting to everybody, just let it be general knowledge.
You guys are better than the MPAA, you guys are far more accountable, more responsible, definitely.
Just pick up a DVD and compare it to a video game, and you'll have a hard time looking for a rating of the movie, much less.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I wish because the MPAA really they need to look at that hard hard they need to look at that it blows my mind literally blows my mind how a movie like Saw 7 or any of those movies gets an R rating
DarkSakura.com
Heaven forbid people have penises.
Decapitations and people setting on fire and eyes sewn shut and all that crazy shit the Saw movies show.
No problem.
No problem.
Okay, there's a big problem here.
Big problem.
I would rather see fucking than blood.
Me too.
Who wouldn't?
What sick fucker wants to see blood?
I realize there's a whole like horror movie.
Now, I do have a friend who's completely into the human centipede, so.
Oh, God.
Awesome.
I should recognize that a horror movie has its own subculture, but at least they all kind of admit it's a weird thing.
Like most horror movie fans I know go, yeah, it's gross, but that's what I love about it is it's so cheesy.
I'm like, all right, at least you know where it is.
I showed her the toddler Pete and she cracked up.
I love TV ratings.
Gaming ratings and TV ratings both have the general level and then they point out these subcategories, you know, crude language, comic mischief, and up to the suggestive situations and so on and so forth.
And those are good.
They're expanded classifications that make a lot of sense.
And movies don't.
GameGuru in chat says about my comment about what's going to happen nationwide says, I don't think so.
California tried that and the Supreme Court shot it down by saying video games are protected speech.
There was more to it.
I don't remember all the details, but I want to say it was going to bust the employees and all this other stuff that didn't make sense.
And the fact that I think mature gaming couldn't be on the shelves or had to have some time.
Basically, they were going to treat the violent video games like porn.
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I think that's the whole point of Rockefeller's bill that he's trying to introduce is to evaluate video games in a certain light to see if there's legislation that's necessary.
Otherwise, then we'll let it be what it is.
Exactly.
All right.
DeGeneres, Johnny, I've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show.
But thanks so much for your call, buddy.
No problem.
You guys have a great day.
You too.
Take care.
That is going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
I am very sorry to those that didn't get through.
I know usually I try to take one or two more calls.
I need to wrap up the show in the next few minutes here so I'm going to kind of start to wind things down.
I want to close out the Twitter topics though.
Twitter.com slash OLR.
There was one other tweet here I wanted to read from Actdeft who sent a story to a story about the PlayStation 3 has likely outsold the Xbox 360.
What?
Maybe Worldwide.
I'd believe it Worldwide because Japan kind of tilts it.
Is that what it is about Worldwide?
Yeah, so Worldwide, it looks like the PlayStation 3 has outsold the Xbox 360.
This will be great news to Sony fans everywhere, but really, guys, just, you know.
Play what you like and enjoy it.
Exactly.
System is only as good as the games that are on it.
But you know what?
I will say this much.
We all gave the PlayStation 3 tons of shit when it first came out, and it deserved it.
But they've really turned it around in many ways, and this is the reward that they get to reap for that.
Congratulations.
Now, can you do something about the Vita?
Yeah, seriously.
Please.
We'll end on that note.
Alright.
That was it for the Twitter topics tonight.
Rapid fire news.
I don't think there was anything left in the show, but maybe if you got any... Sorry, last minute stories.
Cox on fire.
What?
Read the chat.
Alright.
Fair enough.
Alright.
that's it we're gonna wrap up the show and head on out here for the night but not before we go around and get everybody's final thoughts and a chance for me to say of course as always support independent podcasting you know even if you thought this show was shit go download another independent first off if you thought it was bad I'm surprised you made it this far
If you thought it was bad, send us feedback, constructive criticism, and tell us what you thought didn't work instead of being an asshole.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio at OLR on Twitter.
Let me give you an example of bad feedback.
Bad feedback would be Rob is a bitch.
Or bad feedback would be Loki screams too much.
Bitch.
Good feedback would be the audio levels need to be looked at because sometimes Loki gets a little louder.
That's fair feedback.
Or, you know, Rob should not talk so much when he's talking about da-da-da.
That, you know, whatever.
Or send us good feedback.
We appreciate both kinds.
We appreciate Jamie for everything that she does.
We love her and want her...

Gamertag Radio earlier in the show I'm going to of course plug VOG because all the hardworking independent folks that are out there lots of great shows on the network we used to be on, Video Game Outsiders I still try to listen to as much as I can Loki and I were both on Down for Maintenance a startup show my buddy's got Game Buoy, another great indie show so just support those that do this for the love of podcasting
Jason needs his own show because he's got a sexy voice.
He does.
He really does.
I hope that happens soon.
He did have a very smooth R&B intro as well.
You know what?
We need to be like the kudzu of the podcasting world where we spread over everything and are high in iron.

I've got a lot of stuff I want to do.
And I have a bunch of random computer parts that I took from, well, not took from work, but I had stored at work.
And now they're in my garage that I want to build something out of.
I don't really know what.
But, man, I have so many random computer parts.
It's like I keep finding stuff.
It's ridiculous.
I don't know what to make out of it.
You should make one of those little mini boxes but put it in something that no one would expect to see it in.
Like build it out of a fake litter box or something.
Well, originally I had parts for... I was building an arcade cabinet inside one of... It's like a tiny... What was it?
Like the old LCD Frogger games.
Like the really small cabinet ones.
Although it doesn't fit without dremeling some stuff out.
So I have a Pico ITX board.
And then I've got a ton of arcade boards and all sorts of crazy shit.
Actdeft wants me to tell you you have been added to the VOG Club on Forza Horizon and we have to play this week.

Don't worry about it.
Nah.
You should see me driving.
You should see me driving.
Battle for last place.

Fist bump.

We're done.
Another show in the can.
