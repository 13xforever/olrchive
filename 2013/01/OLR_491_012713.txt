Tonight, January 27, 2013, Ruber next Xbox and PlayStation specs leak, Nintendo unveils new games, and the classic gaming company goes bankrupt.
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this January the 27th, 2013, episode number 491 of our program on this lovely Sunday evening.
My name is Rob Roberts with you all at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOG at Network.com where we do tape our show every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
Video games, gaming culture, and gaming lols are my co-hosts, first off, the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
But I'm not going to go into any detail about it because she's crazy.
Yeah.
So, but yeah, free.
There you go, freedom.
Happy, happy.
And that same night I had gnocchi, so it was awesome.
I'm reminded of that scene from Braveheart, even though I can't stand Val Gibson, but you know, freedom!
You know, forget it.
Anyhow, I'll also say hello to the free tech master, Loki.
Hello.
Terrible transition, I know.
How are you, Loki?
I'm doing fine.
And what won the dinner lottery for tonight?
Ultimate cheeseburger from Jack in the Box.
Healthy as always, huh?
I was hungry.
I didn't eat anything all day, so, you know.
Alright, our chatroom is open and welcoming your live comments.
Live.VogNetwork.com Where Breakman, in our chatroom, starts off tonight saying, Quitting a job is one of the greatest experiences anyone can have.
Was it like that scene from, what movie was that?
Was that Half Baked or something?
Where the guy's working at a fast food restaurant and he goes, Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool, I'm out.
Yeah.
I haven't seen Half Baked and I need to.
You need to make like a list, you know, for your, because is Monday going to be your first full day off?
Did you quit Friday or Thursday?
I quit Thursday.
She's paying me for Friday.
Okay.
And which I got, I saved, I actually saved a photo of the text message.
So if she doesn't, I can nail her.
Well, I was going to say, on Monday, you should have a like unemployment marathon and you can watch like, you know, Falling Down with Michael Douglas.
You can watch, you know.
You know what?
Half-baked?
Was that waiting?
On Monday... Waiting, that would be a good one, too.
On Monday, though, I have an appointment in the morning and a job interview.
Oh.
So, it was sort of like... And it's funny, okay, I'll talk about this later, but I got a cat, and I thought I could go pick her up a little bit early, and then I ended up forgetting the paperwork at home, so I had to turn back around.
The moment I started unlocking my door, I got a call about the other job, so...
Well, let's talk about that.
I did want to start off, you know, before we get into how was our gaming week.
We have some personal life updates we wanted to get out there.
And so, yes, let's talk about DarkSakura, mommy once again for a new kitty, right?
Yes, I have a new cat.
Her name is Midna.
I almost named her Eri, but Midna seems to fit her better.
She's very impish.
And there's people that might not catch the reference.
It's from Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess.
There you go.
It's funny, the other day I was like, so our little princess is perched on the couch and Dan's like, yeah, Twilight Princess.
It was pretty funny.
She's about eight months old, maybe a little older, I don't know, but she's tiny.
She's still tiny and very lithe and has lime green eyes and she's all black.
Actually, I thought she was all completely black, but she has like a few little white hairs scattered across her chest.
Oh, that sounds like Maruko.
Yeah.
But she's really short for it.
She's short for it.
But she does walk with her tail in the air like he did.
Okay.
She's not really, I'd say, she doesn't press about, you know, but she does jump around a lot.
And she adopted one of Shermie's toys as hers.
So I was like, well, Shermie loved it, so I'm glad the new kitty loves it.
Mm-hmm.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Like, hear mother play.
So I was like, okay.
She does this all the time.
And then like when I'm done playing, she'll just pick it up and carry it off in the corner and start licking it.
And she hasn't had any accidents.
Normally, in my experience with a kitten, they have like a couple little poopy or pee-pee accidents.
Not a single one.
She knows where her box is.
Good kitty.
Yeah, she's a good baby.
And she's just smart and she's cuddly.
But because she's still kind of a kitten, she loses attention really quickly.
She's like, okay, I'm done cuddling play.
Tiger Claw, our resident internet research expert at live.vognetwork.com found the picture that you'd posted on Twitter this week apparently.
Yeah, the one picture I did on Twitter.
All the chatters are now going, duh.
But I think I got it uploaded.
If you go to my Tumblr, which is Kuro Tsubasa, K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A, whatever Tsubasa is spelled like.
You don't even know how to spell your own damn name?
T-S-U-B-A-S-A Maybe you need a less complicated name like JaneShepard2.tumblr.com or something.
It's K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A.tumblr.com Maybe that's too much.
No.
Um, but, uh, she's, uh, I have a picture of a video of her playing on my Tumblr.
I just, I tried to upload it from my phone and Brad, I don't care if you don't like cats, you don't have to live with her.
She's my cat, not yours.
But she's adorable.
She's sweet.
Dogs can be cute, too.
Not really.
Especially corgis.
They stink.
Especially corgis.
I met a corgi at PetSmart when I was buying stuff for Midna.
Were you tempted?
No.
Were you tempted almost?
Because I found out firsthand now that I'm actually the same type of allergic to corgis I am to other dogs.
Oh, tragedy.
Yeah.
I keep telling Alan, when we get a house someday, it's going to be Corgi Village.
Yes, Breakman.
My cat is all black, but she's got just like a few scattering white furs on her chest.
Like DarkSakura's heart.
Yeah.
My heart is black with white fur.
All right.
Anyhow, anything else before we move on to...
She's just funny to watch explore.
She's really cute.
I love my new kitty.
But I still get a little nostalgic for Shermie.
I almost picked up Shermie's mousy to give to the new kitten and I was like, I can't do it.
Well, AkumaJP in our chat room has a theory saying, you know, cats do come back.
Cats do come back.
You never know.
But this cat was alive before Shermie died.
Because I've got her shot records from September.
You never know.
Well, she just doesn't act at all like Shermie did.
She's completely different than Shermie.
I mean, she's cuddly and sweet and everything.
But even, but Shermie was still stupidly neurotic when she was that old.
You don't want to replace it.
Like, you're not trying to replace Shermie.
No, I'm not trying to replace Shermie.
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Um, but, um, Dan ended up finding her under the liner underneath the couch.
Now, Brad would like to clarify what he said earlier.
He says being deathly allergic might have a bit to do with the hatred.
Well, yeah, I could, I could see that.
Well, I'm like that with dogs, but I love dogs, but I'm stupidly allergic to them.
Yeah.
I mean, it probably the only dog I think I could get away with having would be a pit, a pit or a boxer.
No, thank you.
I'm going to tell you something, Rob.
Hmm.
Pitbulls are actually among the most loyal and sweetest dogs, but they do require a good trainer.
Your sentence didn't contain the word corgi.
Stop caring.
I could have a Yorkie, but Dan was like, they're not real dogs.
Can we move on from kitty puppy chat?
I'm sure people who downloaded a video game podcast probably wouldn't mind kitty puppy chat.
We do have to talk video games at some point.
I know, but my cat's awesome.
But I have another personal story real quick.
Okay, so OLR today, like seriously, almost didn't happen.
And it's because we went to Reno this weekend.
Just, it was a random thing.
I've been having cabin fever lately.
You know, the last big trip we took was when, oh, I didn't even go there with Alan.
I went with Victoria, but Disneyland in September was like the last like trip I went outside of the Bay Area.
I don't count Bay Area trips because that's like my second home.
So...
Like, you know, it had been a few months since we'd really gone anywhere, so I was like, let's go somewhere.
Let's go to Chico, my old hometown, or let's go to Reno or something.
So we decided to go to Reno because we looked at the forecast and it was sunny.
Sunny, sunny, sunny, partially cloudy.
We're like, okay, we won't run into any issues.
Sure, it's winter, but it'll be fine.
We'll be able to see some of the snow that's up there and we can go gamble.
So we drove up there, no problem, and had some fun.
And I do want to talk about casinos in a minute, because yes, it does relate to video games.
But then, this morning, oh crap, it snowed overnight.
And apparently, yeah, like at least an inch of snow fell over the mountains, and that means the chain controls were on.
Well, I don't have an SUV.
I don't carry chains.
I don't know how to put on chains.
I don't even think I'm supposed to use chains in my car.
I think I have to use these vinyl things.
Regardless, I don't really want to have to deal with all that fuckery.
So I'm like, great.
I like the word fuckery.
Yeah, you'll hear that word a lot on tonight's show, by the way.
The word of the day is fuckery.
Where fucks are made.
That's where the fuck comes from.
That's a fuckerary.
Anyhow, speaking of fuckerary, we're leaving Reno.
Finally, the snow, I guess, melted around noon because the sun finally came up and the clouds parted.
I was very happy because I did not want to have to miss tonight's show.
More importantly, I did not want to have to miss work tomorrow because stupid me doesn't know how to put chains on a freaking car.
Anyhow, crisis averted.
But the cool thing about being in Reno is that you get to see all the new toys.
And I'll tell you what, they dump a lot of money into casino games.
I don't know how often you guys go into casinos and stuff, but there's a lot of neat technology to try and bring in your money.
You may or may not know this, but a company that we've talked about on this show for a long time, Konami, has a huge game-making business in slot machines.
That's a huge part of their business.
They make a lot of various slot machines.
If you're old enough and you're at the casino, look in the corner of some of the slot machine games.
You'll sometimes see that they're made by Konami.
But what really struck me as interesting is that a lot of the...
Okay, wait, I have to clarify this because the folks in chat are like, really?
An inch of snow?
You were freaking out over an inch of snow?
Hold on.
All right, in my defense, we're in California.
We don't get like snow ever.
Unless you live in Tahoe.
Unless you, yeah.
California does have its very beautiful snowy parts.
I don't live there.
I live in the sacraments where it gets up to 105, or no, my favorite term I heard this week.
I live in Sacra Ghetto, California, and it gets up to like 105 here in the summer.
So yes, the littlest snow will freak me out in our cars.
We don't we don't antifreeze.
What kind of fuckery is antifreeze?
We don't use that shit here.
Like this is just not something we're used to.
So yes, an inch of snow is a big deal.
Thank you, Bobby Blackwolf.
It's not a phrase I say very often on this show.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Just kidding.
But he says, I understand freaking out over an inch of snow.
I live in Georgia.
I'm from Alabama.
We actually did get snow in Mobile, which is technically a subtropical climate, but everything shuts down and you can't find bread.
SSJ100Matt says, you don't need chains for an inch of snow.
You will be safe in lower gear.
Ah, ah, but is that true going up and down a 5,000-foot mountain?
That's probably the difference.
You're actually fine.
Whatever.
Anyway.
Well, tell the CHP that, okay?
So, anyway.
Back to the casino games.
Just drift, man.
Come on.
The part about gaming.
The part about gaming.
There's some interesting technology in some of these games.
Okay, so don't laugh, but Alan and I were looking at a Sex and the City slot machine.
It was huge.
Shut up.
I saw the picture and I didn't get the reference.
This thing looked like it was like a $100,000 machine.
I mean, it was like super fancy, right?
And we didn't play it.
We didn't give it any money.
But we were looking at it because we're like, this screen is like twice the size of what you see on a Derby's owner club.
and you look at the little... How ironic that you would use that reference to a horse game.
I see what you did there.
All right.
So we're looking at the screen and we look carefully at the little rolls of the slot machine.
It's in 3D.
Like the screens are in 3D.
And I'm like, they're using the same technology in the 3D.
Like no glasses or anything, right?
They're using that glasses-free technology.
Dan's old phone had it.
That you see in the 3DS and all that stuff.
Yeah.
On slot machines now.
Man, her face is really long.
Yeah.
I have to say I'm like the least girly girl ever because I didn't understand the maker of those shoes or whatever.
It's alright, it's alright.
So yeah, there was a 3D game I played later.
It was called, don't laugh, it was called Ladybug Wedding 2.
And I won more money on that machine than I did anything.
Okay, look, Alan and I have a thing.
Alan, Alan, come here.
I need to put you on the spot.
Hi, Alan.
How are you?
What up?
I'm good.
Did you enjoy Reno?
I did.
So I'm talking about some of the technology we saw in the casinos.
Did you find the technology that they use in slot machines fascinating?
Yeah once we passed the big monolith Sex and the City thing to make fun of it I then started noticing those 3D screens on a lot of the other newer machines and it was kind of like how the 3DS is where it's not so much that it pops out but especially like it looks like recessed like you can see like you know an inch like it looks like you're looking inside the screen.
Codeman in our chatroom says I work in the casino business and Konami has a whole separate business for casinos they work closely with Bally they make some amazing pinball machines and Codeman continues those machines are made up have four separate screens on top of each other it was interesting to see them broken down the Ladybug game I was playing had that thing going on but the Sex and the City was like a true 3D but yeah the four screen 3D trick was really cool like it was a neat effect
But, okay, so to justify why I was playing Ladybug Wedding 2, tell the listeners about your strategy when it comes to slot machines.
My friend, Ira, who I've known for several years, he made a comment on the picture post I made on Facebook of the Sex and the City machine, and he's like, I'm dead serious.
Play the gayest, most flamboyant slots you can find, because I played some unicorn magic bullshit in Las Vegas and won $1,100.
Yeah.
I was like, all right.
So I found a unicorn slot and I found two, guess how gay this is, village people themed slot machines.
I was down about 25 bucks.
I made all my money back and ended the night ahead $12.
This motherfucker hit the super jackpot on the village people slot machine.
Yeah, I put in a five and it cashed out like $37.
I was like, I just made all my money back and I'm ahead 12.
Because I thought I just blew 20 bucks.
I don't even want to know what kind of fanfare you get with hitting the super jackpot on a Village People machine.
Did this like a stage show occur?
Ironically, you're trying to avoid the pooper.
And yes, on the little bonus stage, you hit these little things.
It's a party pooper, but yeah, like a nerd pops up.
Because they're doing the disco, and then if you click the wrong record, this nerd's like, what are you guys doing?
This music's too loud.
And then you end the bonus stage.
And he's the pooper.
You're trying to avoid the pooper.
Did I tell a lie?
Yeah.
Some of the slot machine themes are like Jungle Prince, Lion King, Fluffy Poodle Deluxe I played Kitty Glitter The amount of times my peripheral vision misread hot slots as hot slots I had to look and go, what?
Oh, slots That happened like a dozen times
So what was your favorite machine that you played?
I'm sorry.
Well, the village people, because I won all the money on it.
I was actually going to say, I also like seeing the loosest sluts ever.
Quickly, the other 3D one I saw you playing, something like Miss Red, which was slutty red riding hood.
They have all of these princess sort of things, but they're all like sexed up, like Scarlet Hood, and she's got like a bikini on, and the wolf's all drooly and pervy.
Yeah.
I played one Red Riding Hood game that I didn't like, and then I played another one that I actually did really well on.
I could have, I made like five bucks, and then I was like, all right, I made five, I may as well spin it back down, and I ended up losing it.
But that one I really liked, and that had a great 3D screen with a lot of little neat animations on it.
I can't believe it.
Leave it to the internets.
Tiger Claw found a video.
Here's Little Ladybug 2, penny slot bonus mode.
You don't really see the 3D effect in this thing.
That was the game I was playing.
I wouldn't know how to do that.
Just so you guys know, I'm not making it up.
Thank you, Tiger.
Okay, I'm giving the mic back to Jamie.
Thank you, Alan.
I think it's kind of wrong that someone just scored with KKK.
King, king, king.
Shut up.
I'm from Alabama.
All right.
Wow.
No, thank you.
All right.
Let's see.
What else do I want to say about casinos and all that stuff?
I don't know.
I just think it's interesting that a lot of the stuff we see in like console gaming and all that we see for adult gaming as well.
And that a lot of the same companies are involved.
I thought it was interesting.
Technology.
Yay.
Really?
Loco Poco links to crazy taxi slots.
They have slot machines for all sorts of weird things, like the Hangover.
The movie has a slot machine.
Of course, it was in Vegas.
Yeah, I guess, but we were in Reno.
Oh, okay, well then they can't have any sort of Nevada gambling-themed slot machines in other parts of Nevada.
Oh, this is just the bonus feature in the Dreamcast.
I thought this was an actual crazy taxi slot machine, but no, this is just the little bonus feature in the home version.
You sneaky little bastard.
Anyhow,
Let's move on.
I guess we can get into some... I love how the chat room's looking for all these slot machines now.
I know.
Look, I got y'all thinking about gambling.
I need pachinko.
All right, let's talk about video games and console games and the things we've been playing this week.
And then I have some housekeeping for tonight as well that's important.
So let's get to our gaming weeks first.
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
My gaming week was kitty.
No, actually, I played Mass Effect 2 again because I think I finally mastered Flycam.
And if anyone wants to go to MassEffecting.tumblr.com, you can see a bunch of really neat screen grabs I was able to do with the Flycam.
And then...
I played a game that I'm going to be... Well, I didn't play it for very long.
But I played a game called Chompman, which we will be talking about later.
And that's really about it.
I've had kind of an alarming week.
All righty.
Loki?
I didn't play a whole lot this week.
I played actually a little bit of Minecraft last night.
I was bored and my wife got into the next series of terrible TV shows that I'm going to have to sit through the entire series of.
This new series is Grey's Anatomy.
I get to sit through the whole series of Grey's Anatomy.
I'm sorry.
Run.
Run.
I'm thinking it's starting to go to my head because I don't think it's actually that bad right now.
You are so whipped.
No, I'm not watching it.
I'm playing Skyrim, okay, with headphones on.
So occasionally I'll see Katherine Heigl take off her clothes and stuff.
So I'm like, okay, this is not so bad.
Yeah, so it's just, you know, it's brief bits of Katherine Heigl.
But anyways, so yeah, the other thing I've been playing, Skyrim on PC with all the mods and stuff and kind of retracing my steps I did on the console version since I have, I'm probably going to play through the whole game now on PC because, well, I have more expansions on there.
I bought the two expansions out right now and probably will buy Dragonborn when that comes out.
I actually bought some more games on Steam today.
But ironically, most of my game purchases now are not coming from Steam sales.
They're coming from Amazon sales, which all the games redeem on Steam.
They had one today.
Well, they got to compete.
They're doing a good job.
PlayStation 3 is doing a similar approach.
This whole, what is it, 13 for $13?
LittleBigPlanet Karting is $10 right now.
I ought to be pissed.
I bought that game when it was brand new, like $50.
Considering doing that, except we have some free goods that we're sitting on.
I'm trying to get them sent to me.
I'm trying to do that.
They actually have a sale going on right now.
It's five game arcade packs.
I thought first, oh, Xbox Live Arcade.
That's not bad.
It's actually Steam games, but they were featured on Xbox Live Arcade.
It's
Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, Deadlight, Iron Brigade, Mark of the Ninja, and Toy Soldiers for $10.
Or, if you did purchase one of those packs during December, you get another $5 off.
So, I did, and so I got it for $5.
Five games for $5, that's not a bad deal.
And so, I'm kind of having this huge collection of...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's kind of like the Fallout shelter of the game industry.
If everything goes to shit with the new consoles, I at least have this backup library of games to play.
So that's going to be fun.
Some folks in chat talking about the price of LittleBigPlanet carding.
CriticalMyth said carding was $10 with PlayStation Plus, I think.
That is correct.
The $10 price is when you have PlayStation Plus.
Yeah, it's like $14 if you don't.
It's cheap.
It's still very cheap.
I paid $50 for it, so sit down.
Basically.
But yes, thank you for the clarification.
Yeah, it's for PlayStation Plus.
And then what else did I play this week?
Oh, other things.
More Call of Duty, of course, because we're still playing Call of Duty.
I'm still trying to get them to play something else.
I have been trying to softmod some Xbox systems.
You've found five Xbox systems in a closet, literally at my work.
But they're broken in different ways, each one.
So I'm going to have to piece some together this week to get one that actually works.
I've got some that...
Thanks for watching!
That's pretty much it.
I meant to play some more console games, but just didn't get around to it.
A little Borderlands 2, actually.
We played a little bit of that.
A little bit.
My week was mostly console games.
One console game that was a majority of my gaming time.
It's a game I said I wasn't going to buy, and then I had a moment of weakness and I bought it anyway, and I'm actually glad I did.
It's Ni No Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch, which came out this week on PlayStation 3.
I've sunk, you know, keep in mind, guys, I was gone all weekend.
I sunk about eight hours into the game during the week.
And for those that have played the game, and I'll keep this as spoiler-free as possible, I'm at the volcano.
Ooh, there's a volcano in the game somewhere.
That's about where I'm at.
But keep in mind, I've done, like, every side quest, and I'm very OC about kind of trying to do everything, and there is a lot of side quests and things you can do.
Um...
Nino Cooney, first off, the first thing you're going to notice about the game is the graphics.
It's a gorgeous game.
It's level 5.
I knew they'd done Dragon Quest VIII and all that, but it didn't really click for me until I started playing Nino Cooney.
I'm like, why does this feel a lot like White Knight Chronicles to me?
Oh, because level five did that game.
But don't let that comparison scare you off.
It's just they have like that, like the fonts are similar and some of the graphics are a little similar, but the art styles very, very different.
The gameplay is very different, too.
I don't want people like who didn't like White Knight Chronicles to say like, oh, well, fuck that then.
Which I do think, though, White Knight Chronicles is underrated, but that's another episode.
There's great graphics in the game.
And one thing I really like about it is that it goes from, you know, you got this in-game anime style rendering that goes on to actual cut scenes that Studio Ghibli did of anime that's intermixed in with the game.
It is very interesting to me how you'll get these full-blown anime sequences and then you get some voiced over sequences and then you get text, like read the text.
but I don't know like it doesn't bother me as much as it bothers other people because maybe that's just what I grew up on you know back in my day when I played Final Fantasy 6 or as we were calling it Final Fantasy 3 because you know we didn't have the internet back then I didn't know that there were more games in Japan we would read all the text you know that's just kind of how you did it so it doesn't really bother me as much um
Thank you for watching!
There's also that whole Pokemon element of the game.
And this slowly unfolds.
I mean, you don't have it all right in the very beginning.
It slowly unfolds over the first few hours of the game.
But yes, many of the monsters you run across in-game, you can actually capture and you use them in battle.
And the battle system is really interesting.
And this is where the demo really failed.
And I know a lot of folks, you know, I'm sure a lot of you here at VOG heard Bobby talk about how he hated the demo.
And I even said it was really disappointing as well, too, because it didn't really explain...
Thanks for watching!
so the the battle sequences are actually very intricate they're kind of Final Fantasy 12-ish in that you actually run around a little battlefield and you're you know doing the auto attack and you might cast magic and you actually collect a little health and magic capsules that help you out uh on the uh battlefield and um yeah I it's it's a neat system um
Some of the battles can be challenging, but there is an easy mode, or as I call easy modes in games now, thanks to some inside jokes here at the VOG Network, I call it Black Wolf Fun Forever mode, BFF mode.
So yes, there is a Black Wolf Fun Forever mode, or easy mode in the game, and I haven't had to use it yet, but I'm not afraid to if I run into a wall.
I have really loved the story so far.
It's been fantastic.
Now, I have read some things online that a lot of critics were starting to razz the game around the 15 hour mark that it starts to get really grindy and that the story loses a lot of steam and so forth.
I'm not there yet.
I can't comment on that.
So when I'm talking about how much I'm into this game, you might want to take that with a grain of salt.
I said it right up front.
I'm only eight hours into the game, but it's a damn fine eight hours that I've spent so far.
And that's more I can say about other games that I've plunked a large sum of money on.
So, you know, take it or leave it.
I'm having a great time with the game so far.
And I do plan to finish it.
I don't see why I wouldn't at this point.
So, yeah.
I recommend it.
At least rent it.
But don't go off that demo.
The demo was terrible.
The demo... All they had to do was back up the demo about 20 minutes to really explain.
Because the demo...
where you're fighting the boss monster takes place about 20 minutes after you get your little Pokemon or your little monster for the first time and it explains how all that works.
I don't understand why they didn't just back the demo up 20 minutes and let you play through that little dungeon-y area to the boss and then end the demo there.
That was a poor, poor, poor decision and it's causing some people to think twice about the game.
Oops.
Demos are important, y'all.
So, let's see.
Going to the chat room.
Breakman says, interesting is not a word that most listeners want to hear as a description of a game.
Interest equals what the fuck was the dev thinking?
Seriously, they could have done a better job.
But you're being as vague as apparently I am.
Like, why do you think the dev was smoking crack?
Or what do you think they could have done a better job?
Maybe I'm missing something about that comment.
I don't know, but I don't... You know, where's the part that I'm not catching, apparently?
Again, those are live comments at our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com Some other comments on the game in our chatroom.
DungeonBuster says, Still liking the game right now, even with the issues, though I'm a big fan of Ghibli's stuff.
Dungeon Buster also says, Battle system kind of falls apart later.
The AI roles for your party members is kind of challenged.
You know, I am noticing that a little bit, that the party members are very liberal in their use of magic, which is very unlike the style I play with, and I can see where that gets really frustrating, but I think it's manageable right now.
And you always get to fill up on your HP and MP before a boss, so I'm not...
I'm not hating it as much as other people do.
Let's see.
Loco Poco says, I love Studio Ghibli, but honestly, I didn't like the battle system in the demo at all.
Well, you couldn't have.
They didn't explain it.
Let's see.
RawSteelUT says, All Breakman is saying is that interesting is what people tend to say when they can't be wholly complimentary.
See, I'm scared to be wholly complimentary because of what I'm seeing or what I've heard about the future and so forth.
I don't know.
I am enjoying it.
Yes, if I were to judge this game on the eight hours alone, I would say yes, this is a must-buy if you love JRPGs.
But then is that really fair?
Would you judge it on white barf?
Yes, and there are all these types of little references and jokes that I love.
Yes, there is a look for it in the grocery store in the very beginning of the game.
There's a little sign in the background that says, what does it say?
Like, yay, milk, it's white barf or something like that.
Like, what?
AkumaJP says, without Ghibli, the game is just another rogue galaxy.
No, I don't agree.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I think it's... I mean, the Ghibli stuff lends itself great, but Studio Ghibli wasn't involved with Dragon Quest VIII, and that was a lot of the similar things I like in both games.
Anyhow, there you go.
That's my thoughts.
Take it or leave it.
I'll let you know next week after another eight hours of the game if I'm still as enthusiastic about the game as I am now.
Let us move on and talk about a little bit of housekeeping tonight.
Awesome, unsolicited things.
So I want to share with you guys something that was donated to the show this week.
It wasn't money, but it's still pretty awesome.
You guys want to see it?
So we got a gift this week, FedEx, here to the studio.
So you ready?
All right.
No peeking!
Okay.
I hope it's chocolate, because I want some.
No peeking!
If you guessed Rabid Weasel, you are correct.
I want a weasel.
Booze.
Someone sent us booze.
That was Brad from Pod Culture, who also... Do not open this in front of me.
I will throw up.
I thought that might have actually been maple syrup for a second there.
Oh, why?
You're not a fan?
Anything that's fake cinnamon, if I remotely smell it, makes me nauseous.
Oh, look at that.
I can't believe you would talk negatively about a gift so graciously bestowed.
No, no, no.
I appreciate the gift.
It's very nice.
But anything that is... For real, I'm the same way with Spearmint.
Like anything that's real or fake Spearmint.
It makes me nauseous.
Well, I'll say this more for me.
That's fine by me.
You're welcome to it.
That's fine by me.
Okay, I'll try to smell it.
There you go.
There you go.
Anyhow, no, don't open it.
Save it for 500.
Brad from Pod Culture sent that.
He also donated the mics that we use here on the show.
Which we appreciate.
Hand-me-downs from Pod Culture, but they work great, obviously, as you can hear, and help the quality of our show immensely.
So this is a nice big bottle of Fireball cinnamon whiskey, and he gave me some mixer ideas to use with this as well.
And it looks like it burned a hole in the back of the bottle.
Hooray.
Well, thank you.
It was very nice of you to send it to us, and I'll see if it makes me ill.
I'll invite Rice Princess over for the 500th episode, she'll drink it.
We should probably pick up some Goldschlager for that.
Wait a minute, but Goldschlager is cinnamony too.
No, it's butterscotch.
Isn't Goldschlager butterscotch?
I don't know, I always taste the cinnamony.
Are you thinking like butternips?
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking of.
Goldschlager just tastes like burning.
All right.
Let's talk about something else, too, I want to do in housekeeping.
And I want to talk about an article that was on our website that our pal Bobby Blackwolf posted that I thought was really good.
And I don't like to talk about this subject a lot on our show because it keeps coming up as news.
And I say for about the past four years, nothing this thing has done.
It has been gaming news.
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
But what I want to point out is that at vognetwork.com, Bobby, who does the show before us, did a great little article kind of reflecting back on the better days of G4 when it actually was kind of an extension of an online network about video games and things like that and how that all started and kind of being in the community when all that was going on because I never knew that some of their shows had live chat rooms that you could go in and actually like chat during the show and all that and I don't know.
So check that out at vognetwork.com
Alright, let's move on now, I guess, into some video game news.
I think that was all my housekeeping.
Booze and G4.
Alright, appropriate.
Yes.
Let's move on to what is going on this week in gaming.
Loki.
So, one of the big things that happened this week was THQ's assets were finally auctioned off.
And, unfortunately, their original plan to have one person buy everything and then kind of get out of debt...
Just didn't happen.
So, THQ is no more and all of their assets have been split up.
So, here's what happened, where everything went.
So, first thing, Relic and Company of Heroes, the IP that Relic had, actually went to Sega.
So, Sega's going to be doing that, which makes sense because they have some RTS franchises that they work on.
So, that should be cool.
and then, of course, THQ Montreal, the studio, as well as the two IPs, 1666 and Underdog.
Those went to Ubisoft.
So they're going to have that now.
As well as, let's see, Evolve, which was an unannounced IP.
I guess they're also saying it's called Metamorphosis.
That went to Take-Two.
Volition and Saints Row, as well as...
I think it was just those two.
So Volition, the studio, and Saintsboro, and I'm assuming Red Faction and all that stuff.
That actually went to Koch, which is Deep Silver.
That's the studio name you'd recognize.
Homefront went to Crytek, which should be interesting if we get a sequel out of that.
Metro...
2033 and Metro Last Light that went to Deep Silver as well and then South Park The Stick of Truth the license for that went to Ubisoft so they will be publishing that game later this year
That game should have been almost done.
That was supposed to come out in what, April, right?
It was March, but then it got pushed a little bit.
It was supposed to be like second quarter.
So the other one was the WWE franchise.
That went to take two as well.
So you're going to be seeing that coming out on their 2K games license.
But none for Darksiders.
Nothing for Darksiders.
A lot of people are very upset about that, which kind of surprised me.
Because if you think there would be enough upset people, somebody would have bought it.
Well, from what I read, there was, I guess there are other franchises, the same, was it Virgil or Vigil was working out.
Apparently, that was also very risky, I guess, as far as an investment goes, but you would think that they would...
I would have thrown a dollar down for it, but, you know, I don't know.
I mean, some of these, actually, it's kind of funny what they paid for them.
Then you have to, like, pay all those employees.
A dollar might have bought you a studio, but then how do you pay the employees?
That's the problem.
Somebody's got to bankroll.
Just buy the IP.
Make a crappy cell phone game out of it or something.
I don't know.
Resell it.
I don't know.
So yeah, no one bought it.
Although it may go to someone else.
The other thing too is we don't know who's going to end up with all of the back catalog stuff because that didn't necessarily go to the respective publishers that bought the new franchises.
That's just the stuff that was coming out.
Older games, that's going to go to completely different people.
So I'd be interested to see how that turns out.
Ross Steel, UT, in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Considering Deep Silver's marketing ideas, I think Saints Row is in the right place.
I don't know if that's a very tongue-in-cheek comment, but I just collectively groaned at that because of that horrific story from last week with the quote-unquote sculpture.
But that's just a foreign company.
I mean, that's just like Australia.
I mean, they can get away with, I think... Well, actually, I'm surprised they could kind of get away with that at all.
It was Britain, but that's all right.
Still.
It was Australian Europe.
I mean, whatever.
I'm kind of glad, though.
I mean, they're trying to, I guess, boost, I guess, their presence in the marketplace.
And definitely, those are some game franchises that would do that.
I'm not surprised to see, of course...
take two not buying Saints Row because that would compete too much with Grand Theft Auto and I was surprised actually EA didn't try to pick it up but maybe they thought that you know they've got some of their own stuff and they would just crowd their lineup or something I don't know that's true but they have Homefront I mean that's Crytek and Crytek is published by EA so yay another military shooter game to go along with the other two or three military shooter franchises that they own
Um, I have to say somewhere in here, though, I like that the community has been so supportive of what's been going on at THQ.
Like, you know, sometimes we see a lot of these layoffs happen.
And it's, it's, it's not that the community doesn't, but the community has always been very good.
But I'm just saying, like, sometimes it seems like what happens at the employee level is really cold.
Like there's a very cold treatment of what happens to people.
And I kind of got the sense here that like, you know, the CEO and a lot of people involved really, like, really felt bad.
Even though I think a lot of people... You didn't have to be a genius to see that something like this was coming.
I got the sense that there was at least compassion for the people that were affected.
And certainly the community is like... I've seen other game studios posting, Hey, were you at THQ?
No longer.
We're hiring right now.
Come over here.
Just a lot of Twitter buzz.
I think that's great.
I love that gamers are helping other gamers.
You don't see that in a lot of areas...
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Dead Rising Dead Island
Dead Rising is pretty much done.
There will be another one, but we know there's going to be another one.
The last couple haven't been fantastic.
At least we know the next Saints Row game will have a great trailer, if nothing else.
It's just a very over-the-top game.
I would be interested to see what they're going to do with it.
South Beach doesn't have a whole lot going for it right now.
They don't have a lot of stuff that they're publishing.
That we know about, to be fair.
Dead Island Dead Island
But it's nice to see them actually have some good franchises now.
Well, I mean, expanding their catalog, I guess.
So that might be one I'd worry about a little bit.
But I was worried about Saints Row IV anyways when they're like,
Yeah, we're going to take this standalone game expansion that was really just going to be Saints Row the Third with some other cheesy bullshit on top of it, and we're going to make that its own game.
Oh, and now we're going to make that Saints Row the Fourth.
It's like... So I'm already kind of worried about the game just because of how they've treated it, especially with the DLC and stuff, so...
Hopefully they build it into something good.
As long as they keep that humor.
As long as they still have all the same writers.
Because Saints Row 3 is so fucking funny.
I want to say, I was trying to... I should have looked real quick.
What they bought it for.
Man, if only you had the money.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
is apparently ending production in Japan.
Now, if you forgot what the Neo Geo X was, you know, I think we all remember what the Neo Geo was many years ago.
It was that very expensive brick of a system.
I got a couple of them in my house.
Well, and then they show up in arcade machines, right, and all that.
You know what was awesome about them, though?
What?
Having the memory cards so you could save your game at the arcade and go home and play it.
I'm surprised you didn't pick one of these up, these little Neo Geo Xs.
There's no point.
There's nothing on there that we didn't want that we don't already own.
So, well, and you would have lost your chance now anyway, because apparently the production of it has come to a halt in Japan.
These things just came out in December, so I don't know what's going on.
But anyhow... It's not actually discontinuing.
Oh?
It's the limited... What have you heard that I'm not hearing?
Well, the limited edition is being discontinued, the one that comes with Ninja Master, but they're still producing it, I guess...
and Blaze, which is one of the distributors, said it's still being available.
It's just that the limited edition that was originally the launch lineup is no more.
Was there a follow-up that I missed or something?
Because I'm not seeing that.
Yeah, they did a follow-up.
There was a few places around it.
Eurogamer is one that had it.
And I want to say, I'm trying to think.
And Gadget also had it.
They were saying, I guess, I don't know.
I know I read it, that they were... It wasn't quite discontinued.
Well, I'm interested to see how long this can kind of... Do you think something like this can sustain itself?
Probably, it's... Since we all believe the fact that it would have disappeared as quick as it showed up... It really should have.
I mean, no offense, it's just... I mean, the handheld device itself, it's very similar to what I have with the Dingu.
It's just like this arm...
But...
No, apparently it is.
Yeah, it's still going.
And even in the US, they said Tomo Inc., the company behind the Neo Geo X, says the production hasn't ceased on the main Neo Geo standalone handheld, but has ceased on the Neo Geo X Gold Limited Edition.
But that was the plan anyways.
Well, maybe I wanted the Limited Edition.
And they're saying they're going to add more games and peripherals and software updates.
GameGuru in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says they should just put out the Neo Geo games on PC like Sega does for Genesis games.
A few of them are on Wii Virtual Console.
Aren't some of them on PlayStation 3 as well?
I believe so.
I think PlayStation 3 has a few of those games and they're not PS1 classics, obviously, but like a similar classics library.
I think they call it like SNK Collection.
You do see those Neo Geo games kind of pop up other places.
But, correct.
I don't think PC's one of them.
Although, you know, you just, like, download MAME.
Not that I told you to do that, but we all know.
Alright.
Let's move on with more news.
DarkSakura.
Okay, well, now we know that there's been rumors going around about what is going to be the new Xbox.
And we know that there was that completely fabricated story.
So, this though is actually what I found was looking to be quite a bit different.
They're actually talking about specs up for the system itself.
Talking about it under the code name Durango.
I don't, again, I don't know if it has anything to do with the rumor.
We take everything with a huge grain of salt when it comes to these type of rumors, right?
Yeah, especially since that other story was fabricated.
But, you know, it's quite a bit different.
So, they're saying that it's codenamed Durango and that they have a little bit of the tech saying that it's supposed to run on an 8-core CPU, an AMD CPU at 1.6 gigahertz, just like the new PlayStation thing.
And, uh, that it's, uh, running on the, um, Jaguar technology And, uh, apparently, uh, it's supposed to be working with a 32, uh, uh, meg of RAM and 8 gigabytes of memory Of, uh, it looks like, I think they're graphic memory So, it's looking pretty, pretty big I mean, again, I don't know if this is actually true But, it seems to make sense and looks pretty impressive
To be fair, Microsoft does have a history of stuff leaking out.
Now, we do know there was that guy on Tumblr that was all, I'm so sick of people making shit up about Microsoft rumors, I'm going to make shit up about Microsoft and spread it all over the internet to prove a point.
Alright, dude, point made.
But, you know, so there's all that fake stuff out there, but you also know what they say, where there's smoke, there's fire.
And these are the types of things people are talking about and speculating and so forth.
So...
Aside from saying this is true, because we don't know if it's true or not, what do you think about if it was true?
Do you think this could be the direction that Microsoft should be going in?
Because I'll tell you this, that crap that was made up on the Tumblr and all that, that sounded awful.
I should say it sounded cool, but in reality, the whole tablet being that much integrated, it just didn't sound feasible.
It just wasn't going to work.
This...
This didn't say anything about the tablet at all.
It just talked about running power.
It also was comparing it with the Orbis graphics for the new PlayStation and saying that still the Orbis is turning out to be probably more powerful in terms of graphic capability than the new Xbox.
So...
It sounds pretty much what I expected anyway.
They're going to go with, I think, more of processing with, I think, more in terms of how the Xbox is now.
I mean, focus on the games, how they play, not necessarily exactly how they look.
Which, Sony has always been about flash.
Well, it'll be interesting to see, but at the end of the day, we won't really know until E3, but more speculation to continue until then.
Look around E3 week, though, because didn't Microsoft's entire presentation get blown the morning of their press conference or something this last year?
The Halo 4 stuff all leaked out or something?
It was either this year or last year.
It just all went on the internet the day of or something.
It was crazy.
Anyhow, more news, Logie.
All right, so kind of a similar thing with the PlayStation 3.
Kotaku apparently received some documentation.
90 PDFs, they say.
Wow, that's a lot of PDFs.
And this is being released by an individual known as SuperDAE, which you may remember was one of the guys that sold one of the Xbox development kits, the brand new ones for the next system, on eBay, or at least attempted to sell one.
and some of the details coming from that.
Spec-wise, of course, they're saying that it's going to have 8 gigs of RAM, 2.2 gigabytes of video RAM.
They're going to have a CPU that's built out of four dual-core AMD 64 bulldozer processors, so a total of eight cores.
A GPU that's AMD R10XX.
They haven't really said what kind of GPU yet, but something around that spec.
4 USB 3.0 ports, 2 Ethernet ports, a Blu-ray drive, of course, and a 160GB hard drive.
As well as they're saying HDMI optical 2.0, 5.1, and 7.1 channel sound.
Which is pretty much similar to what they have right now with the PlayStation 3.
The controller, they're not really saying too much about it.
It could change.
They're saying that the difference right now with the controller is it's going to be similar to the Vita controller.
They're at least going to add some sort of touch sensor to the Vita.
I think Robin mentioned that's probably that stupid back touch panel thing.
God, I hope not.
It's going to be a waste of time.
But right now they're saying that it's got... Stop trying to make back touch happen.
Some sort of touchpad on there.
Maybe even another... I don't know if they're going to have an actual screen or something on that.
They're also doing something with the account management right now where you're going to be able to link local accounts together.
I don't really know what that's supposed to do as far as maybe...
I don't know.
I don't know.
Could this be all angsty Tumblr person made up too?
I don't think so because the guy has had access to what was supposed to be a kit.
This is supposed to be coming from a developer kit for the next PlayStation system.
So, a lot of this could change, but it's just getting closer to the specs right now.
I don't think you're really going to know until the system comes out, but everyone wants to speculate.
And if you compare this to the Durango...
Xbox Lube specs, they're both very similar 8 core processors, you're going to have a pretty high end video card in there 8 gigs of RAM, HDMI, USB 3.0 stuff and Blu-ray so they're both pretty similar as far as that goes it's going to be how they use that
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and DarkSakura.com.
Talk to the Times this week and in the business section mentioned kind of in passing that they're waiting to see what Microsoft does before making any announcements regarding PlayStation 4.
Harai goes as far to say they're going to let Microsoft make the first move.
I don't know how much of that is kind of like, you know, kind of paraphrasing or what.
But anyway, the quote from the original article is, why go first when your competitors can look at your specifications and come up with something better?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Well, and they do what works for them.
A story I don't think is coming up on tonight's show, but I was reading a little bit about beforehand, was what were the top 20 selling games in Japan last year?
They're like all Nintendo games.
There's no Xbox, of course, because it's Japan.
There's a spittering of PlayStation 3.
I think Resident Evil 6 was in there.
There was a random PSP game that was some robot game.
But most of it is Nintendo.
But here's my thought.
I know Japan's a pretty decent-sized market, but I mean,
Aren't they declining as far as their market share in the whole big span of everything worldwide?
Console sales and game sales.
Pretty soon, that's not going to matter.
Here's how the purchasing goes in Australia.
It's not going to matter that the consoles don't do well in there.
I think.
Other interesting comment from chat here, talking about the PlayStation 4.
RossDLUT says, especially with Sony, who can ill afford another $599 US dollars fiasco.
Piggybacking on that, maybe wait for some of the tech to become cheaper.
before they launched their system.
Storing it out there.
What do you think in hearing what he says?
Now, I want to say I saw something else that came out after this that was kind of like, you know, that Sony's, like, this doesn't mean that we're not going to, you know, do something competitive or whatever, because obviously they want to keep investors happy.
But what do you think this all means, Loki?
Do you think there might be actual reason for there not to show the PlayStation 4 this year?
Do you think that might actually come to life?
I don't know if they're going to show it or not, but I don't think that they can really wait too long.
If you think about it, they can't really make their system spec-wise so much greater than the X. I mean, they're not going to do that for one, because of cost, and two, because when these games are being put out on multi-platforms, which they're probably going to, you're not going to really see that much of a benefit to having additional...
I mean, I guess additional power, the game might play a little bit better, but most of the time they're going to be developing it across the board.
It's going to be similar.
I mean, if you look at the PlayStation 3 versus the Xbox 360, wasn't the PlayStation 3 supposed to be a more powerful system?
Yet a lot of the games that come out on the PlayStation 3 chug and just don't even have the frame rate that the Xbox 360 games do.
So, I don't know.
I think that they should take the safe approach, actually.
I'm kind of wondering what they're going to do with extra things or gimmicks with these controllers because...
It didn't work with six axis.
They tried to make it happen.
It just wasn't working.
And I don't think touch controls are really going to add anything either.
It's just going to be annoying.
And move hasn't really taken off either, even though move is actually one of the better motion controls.
Yeah, I think it is actually pretty good.
It's very accurate.
I mean, I was trying to use... In fact, I was trying to play Connect Party today to show my son this stuff, and we have a window behind...
you know the team or where the you know in the view of the connect and it wasn't working because there was sun outside and so connect is like saying fuck you i am not working um
so yeah i mean it seems like the move stuff works pretty good but like even you know uh nelly was like so this is supposed to be some big you know motion controller thing i'm like yeah well the next one that comes out probably be way better than this is just the first generation of it but then they they never work as good as they say they're going to never that's why i'm gonna wait you know because i've already been fooled three or four times
Interesting perspective from AkumaJP in our chatroom, who actually lives in Japan.
AkumaJP at live.vognetwork.com saying, Yeah, almost all mobile phone now.
Even Tokyo Game Show from last year was all Gris, Mobage, all mobile now.
Even we all now almost all mobile.
Which, you know, I want to say when I looked at that list, it was a lot of 3DS stuff you even saw there.
Again, portable, which, you know, it doesn't surprise me that that's, you know, it's just, it's a different culture in Japan.
Very different.
A lot more of the, you know, commuters than you might have here and so forth.
And just, you know, especially in places like Tokyo, smaller living spaces where you don't have, like Kinect just doesn't fucking work there, right?
Right.
so you know handhelds are the way to go so just different but the sad thing is we got a lot of mobile stuff here too but I don't think I don't want to see mobile replace gaming there's a lot that mobile can't do although ironically enough we have a an interesting story tonight about a online type of game that's trying to emulate console a little more but there's so much that mobile can't do like it just can't give you that same experience I don't know so
He also explains Mobile Gay as a mobile game Oh, I see, it was an abbreviation Well, let's move on, DarkSakura As soon as I can get it I'm on my iPad again Okay, well this is a game I brought up during what I was playing And I just played a little bit of it this week because honestly I wanted a nap It's called Chompston And it's a mix of Pac-Man and Bomberman
Wait, so you're saying this game puts you to sleep?
No, I was sleepy already.
The game is actually, the sound effects work in time with the music, kind of like how, great, now I can't think of the puzzle game.
Luminous.
Luminous, exactly.
Kind of like how Luminous did, so as you get the dots and throw bombs, it works in time with the music.
The music in the game is actually pretty neat.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
and you get different power-ups for them as well.
It's really neat, but you download the game at, and I'm going to have to say out the site, ContraLogic.com slash games slash Chompston, C-H-O-M-P-S-T-O-N.
It's definitely worth your time.
It's a fun game and it gets tricky, so support them.
All right.
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
If for whatever reason you've already worn out Chompston and you want to check out something else this week.
What's coming out to a store near you?
It's not a whole lot this week.
It's pretty much the Hitman HD Trilogy on PS3 and Xbox 360.
Also, if you were looking for a new PlayStation 3 console, they have the new 500GB one, you know, the one that came with the Instant Game Collection, basically the PlayStation Plus for a year.
Well, they have that now in white, in case you didn't want a black console.
And... That's pretty much it.
Also, it was supposed to be this week, Heavy Fire...
Shattered Spear but that probably got delayed because massive games never fucking come out on time
Let's travel to Japan and check out what's coming out in Japan.
If anything, it's been kind of slow lately.
Well, there's one thing on the radar on the Xbox 360.
Love Toray, bitter version in limited and regular edition.
That's your lone Xbox 360 release, but we already talked about Xbox 360.
I completely misheard you say that.
I thought you said toire, which means toilet.
Oh, no, no.
On PlayStation 3, Excel World, Kasoku no Choten, also in regular and limited editions from Bandai Namco, comes out this week.
FIFA Street gets a price reduction.
And in Japan this week, PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.
I didn't realize they didn't get the game when we did, but they are now getting their version this week on the PlayStation 3.
January the 31st is when you can expect to see that.
On the Vita this week, also PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale and Sengoku Hime 3, Tenka Okirisaku Hikari Tokage comes out in regular and limited edition.
Because, you know, they love their limited editions over there.
and unlike over here, their limited editions actually get filled most of the time.
Oh, I'll get into that later.
And usually have better stuff.
On the Wii U, yes, there is a Wii U release this week.
It's Shin Hokuro Musou comes out this week.
And I'm trying to see what this is.
Is this Fist of the North Star for fuck's sake?
Hold on, pull up the thing.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's Fist of the North Star, Ken's Rage 2.
Oh, good lord.
Can always count on another Fist of the North Star game.
God, how long has Fist of the North Star been out, like, since 1979?
No, I'm serious.
I know, I know.
I think it's been out that, like, Hokuto no Ken's been out that long.
Well, it's coming out on Xbox 360 in two weeks.
Do you remember Punch Mania, the Hokuto no Ken version of Punch Mania?
I do.
That was great.
It was fun.
But it's funny to me that, like, you know, that's all the Wii U's got on it is a franchise from 1979.
coming out this week.
Alright, but look, those games are still popular in all seriousness.
I want one of those at my house.
Mildly popular.
Alright, let's go to UK.
On the 29th, we have Let's Fish hooked on for the Vita.
We have on the 30th, Skulls of the Shogun, which is coming out for Xbox 360, PC, and the Windows phone.
I just thought that was interesting.
On the 31st, Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed for PC.
Yay.
And then on February 1st, we have Hitman HD Trilogy and Ni No Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch.
That's it.
Alright, just a few more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
But first, Loki.
So, yeah, apparently the whole pay-to-win thing with EA is still continuing.
And now, Dead Space fans, fans of a very hardcore franchise, are so happy to find out that
Hey, guess what?
Microtransactions are here.
Yay!
Free-to-play microtransactions.
And apparently they say the reason this is happening is because mobile gamers.
Mobile gamers, yes.
There are a lot of players out there, especially players coming from mobile games who are accustomed to microtransactions.
They're like, I need this now and I want this now.
And they'll need instant gratification.
So we included an option in order to attract those players.
So if they're like, oh, I need 5,000 Tugston because I'm short on this upgrade, they can have it.
We need to make sure that we're expanding our audience as well.
Yes, so that's the way you expand your audience is you have microtransactions in your fucking game because mobile...
It doesn't expand your audience because think about it.
People aren't going to buy this game because they have microtransactions in it.
All you're doing is saying, hey, people that are used to paying microtransactions for stuff may buy this microtransaction stuff in our game.
That is some dumbass logic this guy is using.
I'm sorry.
The games industry is in trouble if that's the way that people making decisions are really thinking.
Just say, we're putting it in the game because people are dumb enough to buy it.
That's the reality.
We want to make free money.
We think because of mobile games, people are dumb enough to buy it.
Mobile games coming over to console?
What fuck backwards logic is that?
Everybody is saying it's supposedly going the other way.
Everybody's going to mobile.
They're not suddenly going to come over to console because you're designing the game so that they can spend more money.
I guarantee that there is nobody on the face of the planet that says, hey, you know what?
I like this game because there's microtransactions in it.
You know what else mobile games have going for them?
They're 99 cents.
That's a huge difference.
Why don't you middle managers understand this?
Volume.
That's where you make your money, volume.
And people are dumb enough to buy it.
Even if one person buys it, it's three bucks they didn't have before.
and you see EA doing this in a lot of their games.
They were the first to do it.
They used to put out, they had cheats in their games and then guess what?
They stopped having cheats in their games.
The Godfather game had cheats in it.
Oh, but guess what?
When you buy it on the Xbox 360, you're actually going to have to buy those cheats in-game.
Bobby on his show tonight when we were on the phone call at the end was talking about SimCity and how he was playing the beta and was saying how he didn't have enough simoleons or whatever to do some of the things he wanted to do I said, oh I bet you could probably log into the EA store when the game comes out and get 100,000 simoleons for $2.99 and you're right, that's the type of thing that you used to type a cheat code in to get and unlock
Of course, because here's the thing.
Why wouldn't they do this?
I mean, if you think about it, if you're making a game, why wouldn't you give the opportunity or miss out on the opportunity to make a little bit more money?
Which also is the real reason that game is all online DRM.
Don't fucking kid yourself.
All this stuff about, you know, the interaction with other people.
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
It's to sell you this shit.
So that way the cheat codes can't happen offline.
But wait.
they will, hackers will get it
And sadly, that's the only way these guys are going to learn their lesson.
And then, oh, but the hackers are so mean to us.
We lost all this money on the game and it was the hackers' fault.
The hackers did it, Loki.
I'm sure that so many people out there pirated The Sims 3 because that's why they released so many fucking expansions to this game.
I mean, if it wasn't doing well, they wouldn't release 90,000 expansions for The Sims 3.
you saw how many came out for Sims 2 back in the day I never paid for one but I'm telling you though that they're making people buy this and they're not just like you know for 70s 80s and 90s stuff that just came out it's like 20 bucks and you get crap for your house $20 for not even a really a huge game expansion $40 for a really big expansion like going to a you know university life that's coming out in March and
They literally have one or two expansions a month coming out for this stuff.
It's ridiculous.
And you know why they're doing it?
It's because people are buying them.
Seriously, you're a company looking to make money.
You're looking to stay alive.
What are you going to do?
If people are buying DLC stuff, you're going to put it in your game.
You're going to have these microtransactions in there because people buy them.
People may bitch about them online, but you know what?
At the end of the day, people are buying them.
If they weren't buying them, they wouldn't put it in the game.
Atari Inc.
filed for Chapter 11 restructuring bankruptcy this week.
and it is trying to basically separate itself from Atari SA, which is the French parent company and be its own independent business.
But of course, you know, that's not how they really reported on CNN.
Everybody else says, Atari went bankrupt this week.
Remember Pong?
People are dumb.
Atari's bankrupt.
I'm gonna miss Pong.
Combat.
I mean, let's be real, guys.
A lot of that Atari that we know went away with a game crash in 84.
What did Atari recently have going for it?
Alone in the Dark, Test Drive Unlimited, Retro Arcade releases.
Okay, let me rephrase.
What did Atari have going for it that THQ didn't?
Alone in the Dark but I'm you're missing my point a lot of this is kind of happening to a lot of these guys you know is that it's not enough they had Dragon Ball Z for a while they also had what oh god I will forever associate this with with modern Atari was the Driver 3 on PlayStation that buggy as hell game wasn't that them
Driver 3 was fantastic.
It is a pinnacle of buggy-ass games.
Let's see, where was it?
It was Atari, then it was GT Interactive, and then GT Interactive became Infogrames, and that's when the French side of it came in.
And then Infogrames bought Hasbro Interactive, which acquired Atari, and then Infogrames changed their name to Atari, and they used the Atari name in the logo.
So, yeah, Atari, as it is now, wasn't even the same company as it was before anyway.
It's probably just going to evolve again, and maybe they'll find their next big thing.
I don't know.
To register for participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on VOGnetwork.com, use the passphrase straw.
Well, let's go back to a more classic time when Atari was like, you know, that was like Nintendo or Sony or what it was, Atari.
Actually, this game may not be that old.
Or maybe it is.
Actually, I think you did pick a game that old this week.
Close.
Really close.
Pretty, pretty decently old.
DarkSakura.com
Well, it's not as old as Hokuto no Ken, which, thanks for, I forget who said it, came out in 83.
Rygar is the game of the week.
It came out by Tecmo in 1986, and it was an arcade game called Argus no Senshi.
Which means, I mean, you pretty much play as the legendary warrior, and you're getting a...
Attacked on all sides, and you use this disc armor weapon that's basically a shield with a long chain attached to it.
And basically, I always think that it's kind of like they're...
What's the word I'm trying to think of?
Their derivative of Rastan.
It's the same type of platforming game.
But it came out basically you play as a guy named...
Rhaegar, who is a dead warrior who rose from his grave.
To use the disc armor and other weapons to try to stop this guy named Rhaegar, who took over the land of Argon.
You just go through and you basically shoot people and you shoot animals.
and you shoot spiders and you shoot dragons and you shoot midgets.
Now, I want to say real quick, and you'll probably get into this in a minute, but a lot of people in chat are like, oh, I remember this game on the NES.
But you're actually talking about the arcade version of Rygar, which was very, very different.
Yes, I am.
But I don't know if you'll get into the NES one at all and why it was different.
Hold your horses!
Keep your pants on!
I wanted our chatters to pay attention.
Don't run away yet.
Meh.
Well, at any rate, as I was getting to, the game has been ported to the Sharp X68000, the Commodore 64, the Sega Master System, but that was only in Japan.
It was called Argus no Jujiken.
It came out for the ZX Spectrum 48K, the Amstrad 6128, and the Atari Lynx.
And then on the Xbox, it was included in a compilation that was the Tecmo Classic Arcade, and now there is a Wii Virtual Console version as well.
That's the arcade version.
Now, the Atari Lynx is probably the closest to the arcade version.
That's weird.
Um, however, it did have some different rounds.
There were only 23 rounds, but it was supposed to be pretty close to the arcade version.
I think I actually have it.
I just don't think of Atari Lynx as, like, the arcade-accurate system ever, you know?
You'd be surprised.
The one on Xbox was, I actually have that collection you're talking about.
It's not bad, but it's also not 360 backwards compatible.
Sucks.
Yeah.
Hachamecha Daishengeki Platform Action RPG
and it was quite a bit different.
Basically, you go through different settings to try to kill the evil King Ligar, Blah, who is on the planet of Argol, which was Argus in Japan.
And then you have to visit the five gods who give you different items, and you go through different realms, and they all have a boss, and all this fun stuff.
But yeah, it's a little bit different.
With the difference in the versions, the arcade version is more side-scrolling, the NES one is an open-ended action-adventure game, sort of Metroidvania-like, and at the start of the game you have access to some of the worlds and then you get the other worlds opened up as you go.
You also had permanent power-ups in the NES version.
and different experience points you could use.
There was a new, I guess kind of like a sequel that came out, Rygar the Legendary Adventure that came out on PS2 and it was a transition to 3D style gameplay and it was pretty much rated okay.
And there is a Wii port that came out in 2007.
So there you go, Rygar.
The arcade version is the best one.
I like the NES one.
The NES one had a great soundtrack.
That's what I really liked about it.
But they're so different.
I mean, they really should just be considered two separate games.
The arcade one is so different from the NES one.
Well, look at Strider in the arcade and on the Genesis.
And then the NES one.
The NES one was actually based off the Strider manga.
Okay, yeah, that is a very good comparison, is that the Rygar games are that different, like the Strider games are.
It's a very good comparison.
See, I love the NES Strider, but I know you think it's shit, because you have the Genesis... No, I didn't say I think it's shit, it's just a different game.
I kind of like them both, myself.
DarkSakura, how dare you?
Don't you understand?
This is the foundation that all internet video game media is based on.
You can't have a tie.
Yeah, but I have a personality disorder.
It's called honoree.
Alright, we're going to take a break.
On that note, we're going to take a break and when we come back with Orange Launch Radio, we've got more, yet again, more on Disney Infinity tonight.
Jeez, Loki.
It just doesn't stop with the Disney Infinity news.
And Nintendo had an avalanche of news this week.
We're going to talk all about that and get into that.
When we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio, your phone calls, your emails, and much more when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this January the 27th, 2013, episode number 491 in progress.
And we're going to start off this part of the show with some rapid fire news.
If you're ready, Loki, take it away.
Sure.
All right.
So let's talk a little bit about Disney Infinity.
Of course, can't.
Can't go another show without talking more Disney Infinity.
They're going to actually put out lots of content, which is kind of a duh.
I've actually heard some people saying, hey, we might not actually see any more standalone games from Disney Interactive now that they have this Disney Infinity thing.
And that kind of seems somewhat true.
Didn't they close a lot of that?
Yeah, they did.
Because the whole, like, there was not jokes, but commentary going around about how there won't be another split second or what that racing game and, you know.
Yeah, because BlackRock's, I think, close.
Yeah, yeah.
So, that's too bad.
But yeah, they've got quite a bit coming out.
In fact, some of which I'm about to tell you about.
And this isn't exactly all out there yet.
So, let's see here.
Let's talk...
Disney Infinity Sully from Monsters Inc.
and Monsters U
And then, of course, to go with that, they've got a bunch of other side characters, including in the Incredibles universe, Dash, Mrs. Incredible, Violet in Syndrome, Monsters U, they've got Mike and Randall, Pirates of the Caribbean, Captain Barboza, and Davy Jones.
They're also going to be doing some additional play sets.
Zoro and Cars are going to be the first two play sets that are launched alongside this as well.
And with Zoro, you're going to get Zoro and Tonto, and then Cars, Lightning McQueen, and I can't remember who else.
I think...
Might be Flo, yeah.
And then, of course, they're going to have some triple packs in case you want to get a few characters at a time.
Sidekicks and villains are going to be the two themes of those.
And then I know one of the questions was, hey, when are we going to see Mickey Mouse?
and you're not going to wait that long September is when you're going to see Mickey Mouse as a standalone character I'm not sure the garb that they had the picture of was Sorcerer's Apprentice so I'm not sure if it's going to be Sorcerer's Apprentice Mickey or if it may even be its own adventure set by then we'll see I think Phineas and Ferb is somewhere during the summer and then fall you're going to get Frozen the playset for that and Wreck-It Ralph sadly we have to wait so long for Wreck-It Ralph Phineas and Ferb needs to be now
but those are all going to be available soon.
That is weird that Wreck-It Ralph isn't towards the start because I would have thought that the Blu-ray would be out around April-ish.
They're just trying to probably space it out because you've got two play sets coming out.
They've got the stuff that ties in with Monsters University and Zorro and then Cars.
It might be a little much.
I was hoping during the summer...
Wait for Disney Infinity Giants.
I don't think they're going to come out with anything like Skyliner's Giants because they don't really need to.
Fool.
They don't need to do it for Skylanders either if you really think about it.
Well, they do because it has to expand the games.
They didn't need a little Big Planet 2, Loki.
They'll find a way.
Come on.
They'll find a way.
All right.
All the content's on the disc anyway.
They're going to have to have a new edition in another year for the rest of the content.
True.
And we're going to find out about all the characters anyways for Disney Infinity because the content for this entire year is actually on the disc.
That is interesting too because you know people are going to hack the shit out of this game the minute it's out.
So anything they're trying to keep under wraps with Frozen, be ready for that to hit the internet the minute this game leaks.
It's going to be a little harder, though, because you need RFID stuff to do that.
But I don't know what they've done with Skylanders as far as rewriting RFID tags.
I'm sure that's possible.
I'm not really sure how they would do it.
It would be a little bit more complicated than just unlocking everything.
Hacker's going to hack.
I'm sure that they are, but I'm just saying it's a little bit more complicated.
Not everybody's going to be doing it.
The Ouya is getting a controller redesign.
I actually think it looks kind of cool.
Some people are saying the D-pad sucks.
Apparently, the grips on the analog sticks were not rubberized enough, so they kind of changed it and added a little rubberized top to it.
They also, I guess, are adjusting the touchpad sensitivity and moving the triggers closer to the body.
And the D-pad is now, instead of the circular D-pad, it's a cross-shaped D-pad.
And people are seeing the pictures and they're like, oh, it's terrible.
It looks like the Xbox 360 controller.
However, you're not looking at it close enough because actually the...
Um, circle part on there, the corners, you know, the little pie shaped stuff are actually attached to the controller.
The D-pad itself is the only thing that rocks in there.
Um, so it actually is a true D-pad and not like the Xbox 360 controller, which is kind of a, you know, D-pad on top of a circle and the whole thing rocks.
So, be interesting to see.
I'm still looking forward to my system in a couple months.
So, I mean, that'll be cool.
Bring it in.
And then, of course, the... I don't know if it's a sign of desperation, but...
Hey, get your friends to buy a Vita.
Because we need people to buy a Vita.
And if you do, you get $20 in PlayStation Network credit and 1,000 Sony Rewards points.
I don't really know what 1,000 Rewards points buys you, but cool, I guess.
I mean, some sort of referral program.
Kind of along the lines of that, actually, I'm thinking of selling my Vita because I'm just not playing anything on it.
You know what?
You may have a buyer.
So, I don't know.
We'll see.
Still waiting for a Grand Theft Auto game?
Stop waiting.
It's not coming.
Speaking of Grand Theft Auto, second half of May, from what I hear, is supposed to be coming out.
That makes sense.
Right in time for school to be out, so all the kids can go home and play.
Yeah, because we were bothering them.
We were on a conference call at Take-Two, and they were, hey, so what's it coming out?
And they're all, second half of May.
At least that's where it's targeted right now.
They're looking at a new build of it next week, and assuming that everything's up to snuff, it'll be the second half.
At the end of February, they're going to be announcing collector's editions.
One for $79.99, one for $134.99 to $149.99.
They don't know what's in there yet.
But you didn't hear that here.
But then again, it doesn't take a rock of scientists to guess, oh, they'll probably be collector's editions.
Yeah, of course.
Long-awaited games always have collector's editions.
Of course.
The time frame makes sense.
None of this is unreasonable news.
I'm still begging.
Still begging.
My boss will take me, but Destination PlayStation, I'm going to have a playable build of it.
I want to play that game!
Of course you do.
I'm like, listen, you asshole, you're going to bring me to... You're bringing me down there.
That'll win you, fans.
All right, going to a game that Loki's not playing, but if he had a Wii U, he might be playing this.
Zombie U. So news this week, the Zombie U originally had intended to have a co-op mode, but it was shelved pretty early into development, which kind of makes sense.
Producer of the game said that we thought we could not deliver it on time.
How to bring a cooperative experience and still keep fear and tension is a question we would love to address, though.
So, probably in Zombie U2, which I think is inevitable at this point, but we'll see.
I always wanted to see that band as a zombie.
Shut up.
300,000 survivors apparently have died so far in ZombiU, according to the servers at Ubisoft.
There you go.
Well, they're no longer survivors now, aren't they?
Alright, moving on to some interesting news about the Wii U. Apparently, your Wii Shop purchases will not earn you Club Nintendo coins on Wii U. In other words, these two stores are very separate.
If you transfer your Wii content to the Wii U and you buy WiiWare Virtual Console games on the Wii U's Wii Mode, you don't get Wii U coins out of that.
because, face it, Nintendos, Wii, and Wii U modes don't know how to talk to each other.
Loki, you and I were chatting before the show about this, and I don't remember which one of us said it, but we were joking about this whole $1.50 upgrade is probably going to be something, you know, like if you want to get an upgrade to your game and play it on the Wii U. Yeah, exactly.
Thanks for watching!
And we were joking about that they'll probably be in the Wii mode.
There will be the Wii U Virtual Console upgrade channel that will actually transfer it.
I was saying you'll probably have to buy the upgrade in the Wii Virtual Console because Nintendo doesn't know how to get the two things to talk to each other.
They don't know online.
It's not so much that the Wii can't talk to the Wii U part of the device, but it's the online part.
Like, Nintendo can't figure out how to hook up your Wii and Wii U accounts.
They can't do it.
This proves they can't do it.
Yeah.
And I made the joke that, you know, when you're doing the upgrade, you know how they have the little loading screen stuff?
It's going to be a little Pikmin running into your wallet and snatching a dollar out.
Kind of funny.
And then I said, stop being funny when we're not on air.
I know.
There you go.
I don't make the point to do that.
All right.
Well, this is a game that's available on virtual console on the 3DS, I know.
Xevious.
There's a 30th anniversary tribute album paying homage to the original soundtrack of the shooter and lots of different game composers that are contributing to this soundtrack.
It is going to be out January 29th on iTunes through Namco Sounds.
Very cool.
There's some previews up on YouTube if you want to check that out.
I didn't realize that game was turning 30 years old.
Yeesh.
How does it feel to be old?
Old.
DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
I got some stuff.
First of all, this is sad news.
The composer for Heavy Rain, Norman Corbell, died at 56 years old.
He was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer on August 15, 2012.
This was posted on the 27th and he died at 2.56pm that day.
So that's very sad news.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I mean, it is super funny.
But this one was actually, the interesting thing about this is that the Minecraft guy, Marcus Person, actually donated $2,000 to this project.
So it's got the approval of our Minecraft dude.
And it's on Steam, so go get it.
And then in other news, someone didn't link me the story.
There we go.
I was like, I'm looking right at it.
I found it, shush.
Resident Evil 6 PC is going to come with some bonus stuff.
It comes with the Mercenaries No Mercy mode, which is a time attack with waves of enemies.
And we'll see how well people do on that one.
And also, I believe that after that you'll be able to buy the MIA Siege mode DLC.
So there you go.
It's going to be, well, at least in Europe, it's going to be €19.99 or €29.99.
So who knows what will be here?
Expensive.
All right.
Let's go to a part of the show we call the Fugle Question of the Week.
Well, that's a funny word.
Well, what we did, we smashed the word Facebook and Google together and we got Fugle.
I believe the term is a portmanteau bless you alright Voogle question of the week going to the question we asked this week which is in a follow up to something we talked about earlier in the show with the whole Dead Space 3 and the fact that you will be able to buy some of these guns with real money because of mobile phone gamers are to blame for this
So we asked our Facebook and Google community members this week, have you ever bought a microtransaction in a console game of something you could have used in-game currency to unlock?
Why or why not?
Do you think this sort of mobile, and I put that in quotes, design in games is a good thing or a bad thing?
We'll start with Google tonight.
Critical Myth says, I've never knowingly done so, but sometimes it's hard to tell with costumes and weapons and so on.
But if it's single player, I don't think it matters one way or the other.
I do think it's BS when multiplayer items go for sale in that manner for obvious reasons.
Thanks for watching!
It doesn't... I mean, because it's all co-op, it doesn't necessarily throw the game out of whack.
But I kind of... I think the obvious reasons you state there are probably more in the head-to-head multiplayer games.
That's my guess anyway.
Anyhow.
More answers.
Red Entertainment on Google Plus says...
Yes, I've paid real monies for games and items I could earn in-game.
I didn't do this because I'm used to doing so by prior experience.
I did this because of the general philosophy I have towards things.
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want to expediently.
Flaco Jones says, I've never paid for something that I could earn normally in a console game.
I mean, with guides and FAQs freely available on the internet to show you where every last item is hidden and how to get it, it seems like it would be a waste of money.
Going to Facebook and some of the answers there.
James S. If they incorporate a way for you to obtain the items by collecting in-game currency, then whatever.
This is just one of the many evolutions of the gaming industry in today's troublesome economy.
We all must take the necessary steps in order to keep our heads above water.
Whether or not that means pissing some people off in the process.
It's a business.
Deal with it.
Hmm, I don't know.
I think folks will deal with it when they stop buying the games, but regardless.
Again, the mobile phone logic is you only paid 99 cents for the game in the first place, not 60.
That's the big discrepancy here.
Anyway.
Joe Videa says,
again though if the extra pretties are something that takes away from the core game then it doesn't matter don't want to spend the money on it then don't some people like to collect all the pretties though let them waste their money on what they want
AKVG Games replies and says,
There's more to that, but I can't read all of these answers, so please check out the full-length responses on Facebook.
RedTheHaze replies and says, There was a console game I avoided because of the microtransactions, and that was Gotham City Imposters.
The game was $15 and had the option to purchase upgrades which could be unlocked in the game.
I would have no problem with it, but it took too much time to unlock the upgrades.
It resulted with unbalanced gameplay...
Gossip City Impostors
I don't remember if it did.
Did I not call that?
I thought it did.
I could be wrong.
I could be wrong.
I'm just saying, I called it.
15 is still pretty cheap, but... Anyhow.
Burr replies and says, Most microtransactions feel like paying for cheat codes.
Why the hell are we paying for cheat codes?
It feels like insult heaped upon injury considering that on today's consoles we can no longer cheat in our games because of achievements, trophies, etc.
I think that comment really hits the nail on the head to what I think.
And we were talking...
earlier in the show about the whole like SimCity and how that's all changed I think this is right up the alley of why that all went down that way Degenerate Johnny said honestly I think it all depends on the player I personally have no partook in microtransactions in games with the exception of wow damn that sparkly horse however I do see that there's a growing market for them as games are becoming progressively longer and more frequent it makes life harder for the completionist to master the game in time for the next game to be released and
Even the most skillful players have a rough time keeping up.
These microtransactions help save time for these players.
And again, this one continues as well.
But here's my question.
How does the sparkly horse help you save time?
I guess technically you don't have to buy a flying mount if you have one.
Wait, wasn't it that it used to be that if you bought one of the mounts with faster speed, naturally, that you automatically unlocked Master Flying?
Not the Uber.
No, you still have to pay for Flying.
Well, no, not paying for Flying, but I thought that it was right before they patched it out that if you had... Yes, if you get the in-game achievement for the Violet Drake, you would automatically unlock the 310 Flying.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's been patched out since.
Okay.
Andy R said, I've bought plenty of DLC, mostly rock band.
See, I appreciate the answers, but the Sparkly Horse and rock band songs aren't necessarily things you can unlock with in-game money.
And that's a key difference, too.
And the reason why I wanted to draw that distinction, especially with rock band, is that it's so different.
Like when you're actually paying for a song that is new and you understand that licensing goes into getting that song in the game and so forth, it's very different for me.
While Andy R agrees, I draw the line when it is something unlockable in the game.
Alright, there you go.
I think it's mostly because I'm stingy about that kind of thing.
I have no problems buying add-ons to a game I'm enjoying throughout.
I think that's a good way to put it, add-ons.
And lastly...
Anomalous Underdog says, no, the only DLC I ever bought was more songs for Rocksmith.
DLC that adds substantially new content is the only kind of DLC I'm ever willing to buy.
Rock Band, Rocksmith, Guitar Hero, it's all, it's, it's all, hell, DDR.
They're all the same, honestly.
So, except when the DDR songs were on the disc.
That was a little more shady, a little bit shady, a little bit.
Thank you for all the questions.

All right, let's get back into some more news, and we already started to talk about one of these a minute ago, Loki, right?
Yes, yes.
So lots of Nintendo news.
Basically, they had another Nintendo Direct.
I don't know what you want to call it.
It's not really a press conference, but video that they made.
They talked about a few game announcements and releases and then showed you some stuff, I guess.
I don't know.
I'm a little hesitant on everything that I saw just because we don't know when a lot of this stuff is coming out.
but let's just go over what they talked about so first things first um one of the big announcements was that they're gonna do an HD remake of Legends of Zelda Wind Waker and it's gonna have better graphics and gonna be on the Wii U and have all the Wii U stuff it's supposed to be coming out this fall
So, neat, although I'm not that excited about it.
Even though Wind Waker is a pretty fun game, and I really do like Wind Waker, I actually thought that the new graphics don't look good.
It's too much bloom.
Um, this was one of those announcements where it wasn't really surprising, and it's funny because I got into a debate with somebody on Facebook about this, about that I didn't really feel a lot of this news that came out of Nintendo was that surprising.
And, like, it's like, well, how could you have called Wind Waker?
And I'm like, well, there's a difference.
It's not that I predicted it or I knew it was coming.
Like, that's not what I'm talking about.
When I heard the news that Wind Waker was coming out, I did more one of those...
Oh yeah, that makes sense.
Yeah, actually, yeah, why didn't we see this coming?
Because they always do a Zelda remake for consoles these days, it seems.
We had the new Zelda on, you know, 3DS.
We had a Mario remake launch the original DS.
We had Zelda on Game Boy Advance that was, you know, cross-playable.
You know, the Zelda that launched the Wii was essentially a GameCube Zelda game, but, you know, with the controls.
You know, this whole reimagining of previous Zelda games isn't exactly a new territory for Nintendo.
No, and I always thought that they would be doing HD remakes of games.
I thought it would be Wii games that they would do HD remakes of.
And I guess Mario GameCube games close enough.
Here's the thing, though.
They also said they're working on another Zelda game.
But...
Just like, hey, we're working on Smash Bros.
Grass is green, Pope is Catholic, bear shit in woods.
We don't know when it's coming out.
I would say at least next year, not later.
Super Smash Bros.
for the Wii U and 3DS is supposed to be showcased at E3.
Doesn't say coming out this year, though.
I like to point that out.
They showed a video for the Yoshi game, that alleged Yoshi game that we saw in the debug menus and stuff on the whole Wii U community thing.
It's done in the style of Kirby's Epic Yarn.
Cool.
No mentioning when that's coming out, but they're working on it.
Also, very briefly in a video, a new game from Monolith Soft that looks sort of like Xenoblade for the Wii U.
Once again, that was OK of all the various announcements made.
That one was more one where it's like it was like, yay, because clearly, you know, Xenoblade had kind of a rough transition going from Japan to the US and, you know, all the stuff that went with that.
But it came out and that kind of shows that, OK, maybe Nintendo's putting a little more stock in this than they did when it was originally on the Wii.
So that piece of news was like got a smile out of me.
One that I was kind of, I don't know, it was a little weird.
Shimogami Tensei Crossfire Emblem.
Interesting.
Yeah, that was the one where I was like, now that's a surprise.
That's, okay, cool, cool.
I'm with you here.
That was cool.
I'm going to tell you right now, that's not going to sell very well.
Just because you've got two very niche franchises.
I mean, Fire Emblem, there are rabid fans for it, but let's be honest.
Your soccer moms are not going to be buying this game.
Well, but maybe the expectations and the budget aren't that high.
Because, I mean, by that logic, they would have stopped making Fire Emblem games a long time ago, but they haven't.
so I suppose that audience as small as it may be or as niche as it may be is enough to substantiate this happening I hope they're right no the soccer moms won't buy this but that's not who Nintendo needed to talk to with this little press conference thing they did either this wasn't a soccer mom conference if Reggie Fils-Aimé wanted to talk to the soccer moms he'd go on Ellen they announced that the Miiverse is coming to smartphones so you can be able to browse the Miiverse stuff on there
Now, that was surprising and not surprising at the same time.
Because, you know, you're like, oh, holy shit, a Nintendo app on the iPhone.
But then you're like, oh, yeah, the investors have been, like, breathing down their fucking necks to do something on the iPhone.
You know, the Pokemon company finally did their thing, you know, for what it's worth on the iPhone.
This is to appease investors.
This is Nintendo's move to appease investors.
That's what this is.
I just hope it's good because they sure as hell don't know how to code anything for the internet.
Well...
Me-verse is one of the more fascinating features of the Wii U. I guess we'll leave it at that.
Pleasant surprises.
That's a good way to put it.
It's a pleasant surprise on the Wii U. This summer, we're going to be getting a sequel to Wii Party, a party game that no one fucking bought.
Well, now, wait a minute, Loki.
I'm calling you out on this because you just said, here's one that soccer moms won't give a shit about, yet now here's WeParty.
You know who did buy that game?
No one.
No, soccer moms.
Nobody bought it.
Trust me.
I had to sell this game.
Nobody fucking bought it.
It was just like, is it Mario Party?
Nope.
Don't care.
I don't know why they would make a sequel to a game that didn't sell.
Because it's Nintendo.
They'll do whatever they want.
I mean, it's minimal effort.
But one of the big things that they were touting with this is that you'll be able to do two-player gameplay on the gamepad.
And you'll be able to basically just...
Kind of like how they showed some of the demos and stuff that you could do, like stuff where you can play air hockey or whatever on the gamepad.
Although, explain to me how that's going to fucking work since it doesn't have multi-touch.
WeParty, VGCharts.com, 1.67 million in North America, 3.27 million in Europe.
This is games being made for Europe.
North America sold less than Japan, too.
But 1.67 is nothing to bat your eyelashes at, so...
Yeah, I wonder how many of those were after the game dropped down to nothing.
Would you like me to look at the week-by-week detail?
Yes, I would.
I'd love to.
Let's take a peek.
I can tell you that no one bought that.
Well, again, Europe was the biggest selling region for that game.
Which is really odd.
Did they not get a Mario Party game over there or something?
I don't know.
Maybe it's just different strokes for different folks, right?
Let's see.
I'm trying to bring it up here week-by-week.
Nah.
Keep going.
I'll figure it out.
All right.
And then, of course, one of the announcements was the whole Virtual Console trial thing.
The highest amount of sales were the week of November 27th, but that's the Black Friday week in 2010.
It did sell...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So, the Virtual Console Trial Program basically kind of gets you guys hooked on buying Virtual Console games for the Wii U. You would be able to purchase, they're going to have 30 cent games and they're going to be available for 30 days, basically a month for each.
so the first one of course for January was Balloon Fight and then for February they're going to have F-Zero March is Punch Out featuring Mr. Dream, April Kirby's Adventure, May Super Metroid June Yoshi and July Donkey Kong and 30 cents each and you know if you don't buy them during that time frame then you're going to have to pay the $1 or $1.50 to upgrade them or you know not
Why is it so hard?
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and thank fuck, finally, you don't have to put your TV into 4.3 mode.
It will finally, like it knows to scrunch down the image of the picture to be appropriate.
It's not all stretched like the Wii Virtual Console was.
Thank God, finally.
But again, are those two things enough to really substantiate a buck fifty upgrade?
Remember, and that's not $1.50 for the game, people.
That's $1.50 when you already dropped seven or eight on it.
That's my big sticking point.
People are forgetting.
We already paid a decent amount of money.
And the reason that they're doing that, they claim, is because there's no... Well, the reason we think is because there's no real way to link them.
Yet, at the same time, there's no real way to link it.
When they not know that you've already purchased it and wouldn't charge you just the $1.50, so they do know that you bought it, the least they could do is, hey, you know what?
You bought these games.
I'll tell you what.
You import them over.
When those downloads become available, you get the Wii U version for free.
I mean, really, what are they missing out on?
A dollar?
I mean, come on.
Just do that.
It would show some really, you know, hey, you know what?
Network Multiplayer
How hard is that?
I guess too laggy or something.
It's hard to build netcode in emulators.
Oh, but wait, they already did that shit on PC.
Homebrew emulators have netcode where you can play games over the internet.
Multiplayer.
Oh, go fake.
If only the company that fucking made the games could come up with netcode.
Oh, but that would be asking them to embrace the internet and they don't fucking understand yet.
Is that it?
That's it.
Oh, okay.
I'm done.
I wasn't sure if there was more.
All right.
Well, let's move on with something else about the Wii U. And a very interesting comment that was made this week by Crystal Dynamics, who, of course, as you know, are making the Wii U...
or excuse me they're not making the Wii that was the comment Crystal Dynamics is making Tomb Raider and the comment was about a Wii U version of Tomb Raider because you know why not we had you know Batman Arkham City and you know these other games that were Mass Effect 3 were ported to Wii U so where's our Tomb Raider port to the Wii U and you know if creative director Noah Hughes if you try to read between the lines of what he said here it's probably not happening
I'm always a fan of Nintendo systems.
In particular, they really push interface design, and from a game design perspective, it's fun to play with the new interfaces.
So there's the nice little, like, I'm going to say something nice, and then here's the but.
But, having said that, it's something that I think we would want to tailor the experience to if we were going to do it.
and currently we're offering it on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC and all three of those are really trying to deliver roughly the same experience but delivered best on each platform.
I think something like the Wii U often asks you to do something unique based on a unique interface so that's something as a gamer I love but it's something that you don't want to do half-heartedly as a developer.
so in other words they don't want to try and at least what I'm hearing in here they don't want to try and put Tomb Raider on the Wii U when it wasn't really designed with the Wii U in mind when there's something extra going on there and I say makes sense to me yeah
You know, maybe there's somewhere else where Lara Croft can fit on the Wii U You know, there were those games, the Xbox Live, thank you, the Guardian of Light, the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade games I bet one of those games could be done very well on the Wii U If they wanted to do that, I don't know
I just think it's really late for them to, they've been working on Tomb Raider for a while, it's probably late to them to make a port and it might not be that beneficial because they're worried that the numbers aren't there yet to support that.
No, makes sense to me, I get it.
So, and I honestly, I think the people that want to play Tomb Raider probably already have, are the types of people that already have Xbox, Playstation 3 or a PC, you know, like PC's a pretty big market, you know.
Anyhow, let's move on with more news.
DarkSakura.
Well, this is the news we've been waiting for and it's already been all over the place and I'm sure everyone knows about it, but this is super, super awesome.
Basically, we talked last week about how Jonathan Coulton had been kind of shafted, well actually really shafted when it came to Glee's treatment of his cover of Baby Got Back.
So now, even though there's still some legal research going on with this what he's done is re-released his original as a cover of a cover of his cover
So now it's listed on iTunes, Amazon, and Google Play as Baby Got Back in the style of Glee.
And I paid for it.
I mean, it's a good cause.
But basically what's going to happen with this, he's using the same license he had before.
So after basically Sir Mix-a-Lot gets paid, then the proceeds, and iTunes, then any other proceeds are going to be donated to the VH1 Save the Music Foundation and the It Gets Better Project.
Which roundaboutly goes back to Glee because they're also sending donations to that.
Yeah, a lot of the comments I've been reading is that Glee is supposed to be all anti-bullying and stuff, but what is Fox doing to JoCo in this case?
Pretty much, yeah.
It's kind of sick.
I mean, it comes down to the bottom line, it's all about greed.
You know who the real winner is in this scenario, though?
Sir Mix-a-Lot.
Yeah.
I was like, dude, all this money.
Who's given Sir Mix-a-Lot any thought recently, you know?
Seriously.
Like, what's the last thing he's done?
That guy's like, thank God I can pay the rent this month.
No, he's actually, to tell you the truth, he's actually still been, I think he did, like, a lot of producing.
Yeah, I wouldn't doubt it.
That's what happens to a lot of those.
But honestly, the last Sir Mix-a-Lot song that ever came out that I gave a damn about was Buttermilk Biscuits.
Huh.
So, just saying.
Game Guru in our chatroom says, Coverception.
He needs to actually be knighted, and then he can really be Sir Mix-a-Lot.
Because that would be awesome.
I love it.
Why can't we have that happen?
I don't know.
Write the Queen of England and suggest that.
Oh yeah, he's not English, for one.
Who cares?
Whatever.
We'll make an exception.
Make an exception.
I think that actually non-Englishmen can be knighted.
Okay.
I'd have to double check it, but I think so.
Well, maybe Sir Mix-a-Lot can just be an ambassador, you know, if it's good enough for something.
How about we just call him Mr. Mix-a-Lot?
Mr. Mix-a-Lot?
The ambassador to large posteriors.
Bootyvania.
Alright, moving on, Loki.
Alright, so... This guy, I don't know what to do.
Seriously, can these people get voted out of office already?
I mean, seriously?
Senator Leland Yee.
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I'm sure he's trying to pass another anti-gaming law or something like that.
I think this is in response to all the voices you're hearing in the community about, hey, stop blaming us for that sick stuff that happened at Sandy Hook.
I think that's where he's saying gamers need to kind of be quiet.
And it's like, no, you be quiet.
Yeah.
No, you shut up!
By the way, I do have an expansion for what I just said.
Anybody can be knighted, but they can't accept a peerage unless they renounce their current citizenship.
So, just saying.
Well, Leland Yee should certainly not be knighted.
No, he should be set on fire.
I mean, did I say that out loud?
I'm sorry.
Metaphorically.
He needs to be fired.
Yes.
Fired.
Much better.
Well, he ran for mayor of San Francisco, if I remember right.
He didn't get it.
He can be smothered in a bag of dicks.
Metaphorically.
Metaphorically.
I just, I don't know.
I mean...
There's just a lot of ignorant people out there, and they're only getting older.
Can you say that quote from him, too?
What was that again?
Gamers need to... It wasn't gamers need to shut up, but gamers need to... Gamers have just got to quiet down, and then gamers have no credibility in this argument.
What?
Yes, let me make your job easier in passing these unconstitutional laws.
Let me just quiet down.
Why don't I just ignore the First Amendment that gives me the right to call you out on your hate spewing and misjudgment of our community?
Hey, you people of color, why don't you just quiet down?
We don't need to pass these equality laws or anything.
Why don't you just...
Stop complaining.
Hey, gays, shut up.
Yes, seriously, gays, just stop complaining.
Let them throw you in trash cans.
Bag is just a word.
I'm just trying to do my job here, okay?
Passing these laws.
But you know what?
Women get the same thing too because we're told we're not able to decide what goes on with our girl bits.
I'm sorry, you don't have a vag, you can't talk about it.
That's what I think.
And I say the same thing to the non-gamers.
You don't game, you're not allowed to talk about it.
Are you saying Leland Yee should play a video game?
Yes, I think he should.
I mean, he can't grow a vag, but at least he can pick up a controller.
I mean, I guess we could arrange that in some surgery.
Custard's Revenge
I love this comment, and I think we'll end with this.
Legend of Zaku in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
Leland Yee channeling his inner Marie Antoinette.
Go eat cake, gamers.
Very well spoken.
But we all know what happened to Marie Antoinette.
Metaphorically.
No, she got... It really happened to her.
And besides that, though, I think that... I think he...
I've got my inner history nerd is totally just screaming.
Let it go, girl.
Let it go.
I'll just tell them to chat.
Okay.
See what you're missing by not being at live.vognetwork.com Well, if you think it's just Leland Yee, you're wrong.
More light gun games and gun games disappearing after more complaints.
Wake up!
You're getting blamed for this.
You, who might not even be into some of these video games, you as a gamer, as somebody who sought out this podcast and downloaded it knowing we talked about video games, you are a gamer one way or the other.
I'm 99.9% sure you are.
You are being blamed for this tragedy that happened back east.
Wake up.
Don't forget about the other people who are getting blamed for it too.
Are they?
Well, yes.
But let's... I mean, like, movies and TV and so forth.
It seems like a lot of that is getting... No, I'm talking about autism spectrum people who are also getting shafted out of the whole thing, too.
Yes, that's very true.
You know who's to blame?
It's that damn show, Grey's Anatomy.
It is.
It's to blame.
It is.
It's Glee's fault.
There's so much violence on that show.
Blood and guts everywhere.
And sex.
There's sexing on that show.
Glee taught me how to steal.
I robbed a 7-Eleven because Glee said it was okay to steal.
Hey, I pirated all that music because Glee made it okay.
Fox is saying, hey, this is what we do.
We copy that floppy until the cows come home.
You know what?
Hey, what are you going to do about it?
You should be happy that I'm listening to your music.
Why don't you go make some more music so I can steal that too?
Don't have a headache now.
Our first email comes from, I mispronounced the name, Ramaditya.
Hi guys, this is Ramaditya.
This month I tried to give you pictures from my wedding, but unfortunately Facebook blocked your access.
Now I would like to share one of the greatest parts of my marriage ceremony, the Star Wars wedding party.
It's actually a YouTube video, so we really can't pull it up and watch it right now during the show.
This is the first three minutes where actually my greetings and preparation.
You may watch the duel in front of the audience when you reach the middle part of the video.
I hope this will inspire other fellow gamers to do something unique to their unforgettable events in life.
See, Dan and I, when we got married, we just went to the courthouse.
And then he made faces at me, and I punched him.
I punched him in the arm and told him to knock it off.
That was my wedding.
Thank you for sharing it with us.
Um, next email.
Good day, OLR.
Thank you so much for reading my email on the show.
I can't believe you guys are still on the air.
Neither can we.
Neither can we.
I've started listening from the beginning and it's brought back some outstanding memories.
I apologize if this runs a little long, but I first heard the show in a rather unusual way.
It was at an old glow-in-the-dark bowling alley double arcade owned by the nicest group of people I've ever met.
What I mean by double arcade is... Somebody was playing this show at a bowling alley?
I...
Let me read it.
Let me read the damn email!
We say fucking shit.
Fuck, fuck, cock.
Okay.
What I mean by double arcade is that it was split into two adjoining rooms, each with their own genre of cabinets.
The first room was row after row of fighting games.
The other was the Bimani room.
That host near weekly tournaments of each and yearly Bimani Game Festival On the morning of said festival, I remember hearing a clip from your show talking about 2DX And loved hearing the host chat it up I completely forgot to ask about it, I was too excited waiting for Chorus K to arrive And I've been keeping an ear out ever since Just to a few weeks ago, while looking up a new WoW podcast to listen to I somehow ended up downloading an episode of Horde House The whole episode I kept thinking, boy this Rob Roberts guy sure sounds awfully damn familiar And then you eventually mentioned OLR
I downloaded the newest episode of that and voila, I've somehow managed to find my show all these years later.
So thank you so much for everything you do and have done for the last decade now.
You've reminded me of some just simply unbelievable memories of a place that got flooded years and years ago now.
Much love.
I guess it's Plagius?
Plagius?
Wow, Horde House did something good.
I'm teasing, I'm teasing.
That's pretty amazing.
Still, the whole bowling alley thing blows me away.
I have heard that this show gets played in some very interesting places.
I heard there was a GameStop that was playing this show somewhere.
And I'm like, can't you get in trouble for that?
Because we use naughty language.
I don't know if they were doing it after hours or what.
Are we talking about the evil G?
Yeah, right?
So it must have been after hours.
Oh, the irony.
It must have been.
I don't know.
That evil G must be Goodfellas.
Goodyear Tires, clearly.
Goodyear Tires.
Damn that Goodyear Tires.
Well, also, this was a few years ago before there was so much fuckery.
I mean, let's be real.
There was a time and place when that was a store we all went to regularly.
And my husband worked at.
Exactly.
It's different now.
I've heard of a LAN gaming center that was playing this show at one point, which, you know, that's pretty cool.
But yeah, bowling alley.
So I want to say to all the bowling alleys, how do you cheer on bowlers?
Roll the ball!
Knock the pin!
Go Turkey!
Get that turkey!
Clap, clap, clap.
I don't know.
I need J-Links.
J-Links, how do you cheer a bowler?
It makes me think of Global at... What the fuck is that?
Country Club.
Country Club Lanes.
Yeah.
Yeah, one of our old school DDR spots.
The last time I did Global was when Mel and Melody were in town.
Didn't you come too?
probably we need to go global it was like 2 in the morning and we were like you know what this email wants me to do it makes me want to go bowling because I haven't been bowling in forever let's do it while I'm not working last email hey OLR decided to put some time into getting the Wiimote working on my Windows 7 machine but apparently the new Wiimotes don't like to play with Windows do you have any suggestions you can point me towards or even better a surefire way to get it to work tanks in advance and this comes from Xenocore
It should just work.
It's Bluetooth, so it'd work like any Bluetooth device.
Sometimes they can be a little bit tricky to set up.
I remember I had a Bluetooth dongle for my laptop, and I tried getting a Wii remote to work with that with an emulator, and it was just like...
Nope, not going to do it.
So it may just be you might need to try a different adapter or you may need to try syncing in a different way.
I know you can't just push the sync button.
I think you have to push the 1 and 2 buttons at the same time, if I remember correctly.
I know I got one to sync up to my Android phone to play some games on that.
Actually, that was my old Android phone.
I should try the new one too.
but I've got a Bluetooth controller for that now and I think this laptop has Bluetooth built in.
Hell, I know my wife's netbook has Bluetooth built in so I should try that.
I have to read this part of his signature too.
Power corrupts.
Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
Trivial power corrupts disproportionately.
I love it.
That's it.
That's it?
That's it.
We need more bowling alley emails.
Mailbag at orangeslimesradio.com And we're spent.
So where's the craziest place you kids have listened to this show?
That's kind of what I want to know, like for real.
I kind of miss strikes now.
There still is a strike.
I know, but that's when we need to go.
Oh, because you haven't been in a while.
I haven't been in ages.
Alright.
You know I was just in Reno.
You know what they have in Reno?
DDR1 Did you go to where your DDR cherry was popped?
No, because that was in Vegas Oh, that's right, you were in Reno I was at the Rocky Horror 25th Anniversary Convention the first time I played DDR We decided to say fuck it and we didn't go to shock treatment night But anyway, the story I really want to say In Reno, it's a huge bowling center I think it's like the National Bowling Did you go to Circus Circus?
Yeah, oh yeah, that's where I saw DDR Supernova.
But bowling!
National, oh, forget it.
Did they still have the Daytona machines there?
Because they had like a ton of Daytona machines.
No, actually, truth be told, Circus Circus, sad.
I mean, because it's the same thing that happened to every other arcade.
Ticket machines.
Ticket machines, ticket machines, ticket machines, ticket machines.
And just like...
Just like DarkTetsuya said about Country Club Lanes, which we haven't been to in forever.
DarkTetsuya said, yeah, no DDR there anymore.
This is all in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
DarkTetsuya says, now it's all Dave and Buster style games like the Pac-Man Battle Royale and Faster Than Light or whatever that ticket game is.
Lame.
I mean, I'd hope they'd at least gotten DDR, X2, but X3... Or X2 or X3, but alas.
Yeah, Circus Circus, the only thing I caught, there was a driving game, and I don't even remember which one it was.
Just one of the flashy... It wasn't like initial D or anything.
I think it was like...
Have they made a racing game out of Fast and Furious?
Yeah.
I think it was that.
The Fast and Furious games are very similar to Cruisin'.
It's the same.
Why can't we have Sugar Rush?
It was that and DDR.
And the rest, ticket games, claw machines.
You know, Circus Circus, the casinos have the whole carnival barkers and those games.
That's still one of the few places you see that, too.
I mean, you know, now so many places have automated games.
Horsey Races and all that stuff.
They may have buried them back in the arcades because their arcades kind of go in some subterranean caverns and crap back there.
We looked.
We did a whole little... Now, granted, it was really crowded when we were there, which is weird.
Yeah, it was weird.
It was Saturday night.
Silver Legacy has theirs tucked away in the Child Care Center.
You know who had more arcade games was my favorite ghetto as fuck casino in the world.
I love this place, Calneva, which is on the strip in Reno.
I just said Reno has a strip.
It's so pathetic compared to Vegas.
But it does have a strip, and the Cal Neva is there.
And I love the Cal Neva because it's just so ghetto.
And because there's no more Fitzgerald's or Virginian, there's got to be a ghetto casino that holds that down.
And so Cal Neva really takes the cake.
But on the second floor, they have arcade games.
But they don't have really a lot of ticket spitters, probably because they can't pay somebody to run a ticket counter.
So they have old-ass recycled arcade games up there on the second floor.
So that was pretty, like a Neo Geo machine and that type of stuff.
Yeah.
No.
Anyhow.
Let's move on.
SSJ100Matt says, was that the arcade in The Wizard?
I don't remember.
Might have been.
Now I want to go look that up.
Did they go to Reno in The Wizard?
Yes, they did.
Holy shit.
He touched my breast!
That's right.
I thought that was Vegas for some reason.
No, it was Reno.
Oh.
The only movie I associate with Reno is Sister Act.
It's Reno and Gamora.
Oh, yes.
Speaking of Reno, it's time for the FUs of the week, everybody.
Where's the FU of the week music?
Here it is.
We need new music.
I'll help you get on that.
Let's get on that.
I tried.
It didn't work out very well.
FU of the week music.
So 500 is going to come up.
We're still going to have that same intro from seven years ago.
Not that, I mean, Midi Head did a great job.
It's great, but you know, seven years.
Hey, Midi Head, if you're still listening to us, make us a new one, please.
I won't scream.
FU's the week time, DarkSakura.
I don't know.
I guess FU to not having a job now, but at the same time not having my old job is awesome.
So I guess that's good.
Yeah, I'm done.
Loki.
Um, F you to drivers making right turns.
For some reason, people cannot make a right turn fast enough for my satisfaction.
Like, they will slow down to, like, no speed at all.
I don't understand why it's so hard to make a right turn.
And to this dick, like, I don't know what it was.
Some guy coming off the freeway today and, like, went across five lanes, no signaling whatsoever.
Oh, but managed to signal during his left turn.
Like, actually in the middle of his turn, he flipped on his signal for no apparent reason.
Stupid kid driver.
My FU of the week goes to Chain Requirements on IAD.
Nuff said.
So, I'm looking at Wikipedia.
They finally arrive in Reno, where it is revealed that Hayley wants her share of the prize money to help her father buy a house.
With the help of an acquaintance trucker, they use the money won at craps tables to train Jimmy on several games in the Reno arcades using Nintendo PlayChoice 10 machines.
Maybe that was... I need to find that scene.
Online somewhere.
But which... They don't say on wiki what... It may have been a set, so that's why.
It may have been a set.
That's actually a very good point.
All right, anyhow.
All right.
So Blockbuster is closing more stores, which is kind of bad.
They're closing another 300 stores in the U.S.
here.
They just closed another 160 in the U.K.
where they've recently filed bankruptcy there.
And that brings them down to a total of 500 stores in the States and 500 stores in the U.K.
What is kind of unique and not something that's actually reported on this article here and something I've got to know a little bit of information on is
Game Retail
That's why I was on the call I was on to this week.
Maybe they'll pick up your copy of MLB.
Well, not MLB because it's too late for that.
Bioshock, though.
Bioshock Infinite.
You'll be able to pick up your local blockbuster if you are ever so inclined.
Very important research I need to do here live on this show.
This is very, very, very important.
First off, what is that guy in the background?
What?
Okay, hold on.
No one wears that.
Nobody wears Speedos in public.
All right, hold on.
Hallie!
Got you, Jimmy boy.
Time to go home, son.
We're too late.
He touched me!
That is not the Calnava.
The arcade at the Calnava is on the second floor.
That does look like a Hollywood stage.
That's probably where that was filmed.
They might have just said it was that.
Anyhow, very important question we had to answer.
I mean, that was crucial.
I could not continue the show until I knew if that was the Calnava or not.
I wonder if she's used that line before.
Like, now that she's grown up a bit.
Shane Alinko in our chatroom says, Jimmy grew up to be super hot.
All right, moving on.
One last story for you guys tonight, and this has to do with an arcade beat-em-up game coming to Facebook.
And apparently it's turning some heads because it is a console-quality game.
You know, when we think of Facebook games, we don't think of a lot of really great games where it's, you know...
Click for and then give me money for more energy pills.
Like there's just not a lot of great, great games on Facebook.
The only one that I think a lot of console and PC gamers will give any cred to is maybe like You Don't Know Jack, you know, because it's, you know, that kind of gets a little bit of a break.
But not a lot of hardcore stuff on Facebook Well, I don't know if you guys knew about this But there's a new developer, N-Way And this is a San Francisco-based company They were founded in 2011 It was founded by game industry veterans And their sole purpose is console-quality multiplayer games To the web and mobile platforms David Jones is with this studio He was the founder of DMA Designs Wasn't he a monkey?
Well, it's now Rockstar North He created Lemmings
and the original 2D Grand Theft Auto.
Stig Hedlund, who was the lead designer in the first two entries for Diablo.
Chronoblade is the game that they've put together, which if you actually look at some of the screenshots, I'm like, that does kind of look like Diablo, but more of like a...
I don't know, not like that same type of perspective.
It looks a little more, I don't want to say hack and slash because that is kind of Diablo, but you see, it looks like there's the red orb and the blue orb and, you know, there is definitely, I mean, I look at this and I go, oh, this is like an Xbox Live Arcade game, right?
No.
Nope, apparently it is something that is on Facebook.
They're calling it an arcade-style brawler, and it apparently is going to be very similar to Diablo.
Chrono Blade exists in a series of parallel worlds that will band together to fight against a common foe.
So I'm assuming this means maybe the parallel universes is how you interact with your friends?
I don't know, but they also say this is a way to have a Viking-themed world and steampunk world and kind of cross all these areas together.
So that's pretty cool.
And it's going to be completely free to play, and there is a beta sign-up website if you want to check that out.
Maybe this will be the Facebook game that it will be okay to like.
Who knows?
There you go.
Would you play a game like that, even though it's on Facebook?
Loki?
No.
No?
Alright, fair enough.
I just don't Facebook game.
Yeah, I hear you.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call and we'll take your calls here on the show for a few minutes here and whatever you want to talk about tonight.
If you want us to watch more scenes from The Wizard, we can do that too.
Just let us know.
I'll queue it up.
That sounds fun.
Alright.
Maybe for each caller tonight I will play a new scene from The Wizard.
All right.
Loki, do you have any last-minute news stories while we wait for those calls to come in?
Again, that's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Apparently there is a company, Team Pixel.
They're an independent company.
They are crowdfunding to buy THQ's Homeworld IP.
Apparently they are trying to raise, I guess...
$50,000 by February 7th in order to acquire the property to make another Homeworld game.
Let's go to the phones.
We have a call coming in.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Oh, it is me, one named Jason.
Hey, Jason, long time no see.
How are you?
Yes, a terribly long time.
I know, but you're back in Colorado now.
I am back in Colorado after a seven-hour train delay that got me in town at one o'clock in the morning and was kind of garbage by the end of it.
And now that you're back in Colorado, how was it to hear me bitch about one inch of snow ruining my day?
I chuckled but I also kind of, I know exactly how you feel because when I first went out to California in March, St.
Patrick's Day weekend, it was snowing over the Sierra Nevada and the bus that I was on had to throw on chains or some other, you know, whatever a vehicle of that size has to use and go like 25 miles an hour over Donner Pass and that whole bus ride was just garbage.
Well, thank you, Jason.
You're a true friend, making the listeners understand my pain.
So what did you really want to call in to talk about tonight?
Just kind of an idle thought.
When I was listening to you talk about your trip to Reno, a co-worker mentioned something to me a couple of months ago, something along those lines.
And he said that it was a sad day when he realized that audio – musical hardware companies –
Produce things predominantly for churches and broadcast and not like musicians and clubs and studios or anything like that.
And so he started to get to explaining how as churches crop up and start having recordings and even if you know of churches that broadcast on the local stations over the air in the area...
and I had thought about a church that I used to go to when I was really young and I remember being in the production studio and seeing all of those screens, this gigantic mixer, all of the audio coming out of these ridiculously powerful speakers for recording an orchestra, the preacher and whatever else that they have going on.
I could see that.
You know, there's a lot of television around the church program and so forth.
And, you know, I always associate church in my mind.
The church I went to when I was younger was a very small place.
And, you know, the whole freaking place could probably hold maybe, maybe 80 people.
You know, so there was nothing like what you're talking about.
But I know there's other churches like, you know, you get these mega churches that are like, you know, that it's like going to a rock concert.
You know, they called my church when I lived in Alabama, Six Flags Over Jesus.
Seriously, go to Google Maps and look up Dauphin Way Baptist Church.
Oh, I know.
Texas has some just like some churches buy arenas.
They are that big.
We built an arena.
So, yeah, no, I told like now that you're saying this, I'm like, yeah, that makes sense.
And it is kind of an interesting parallel, too.
And I'm assuming that's the parallel you're making, too, is that a lot of stuff that maybe we get in gaming might have been developed for, you know, lounge gaming or whatever you want to call it, casino gaming.
Yeah, absolutely.
And you already laid all of it out when you were talking about it because, sure, the DS is a tiny screen and has two screen depth 3D, but you were just talking about, and I saw the picture too, a four screen, I don't know, how big was that, would you say, 150 inch screen?
Oh, that is gigantic.
Yeah, probably.
I mean, it had enough space so that you had, I think, four... You saw Alan post on his Facebook, right?
It had room for at least, I think, six people to sit.
Yeah.
And that was one edge of the screen to the other.
And they're like those fancy chairs that vibrate.
You feel the bass in your ass if you hit the jackpot.
I mean, it's...
That's gotta be one fun share to sit in when you get a jackpot.
It's a Sex and the City game, for fuck's sake.
And that only makes it even better.
That explains everything.
That is... Oh my god.
That was the part that blew me away.
This game is orgasmic.
Really?
This?
Like, deal or no deal?
I get that.
Wheel of Fortune?
I get that.
Sex and the City?
What?
But, you know, there's a lot of little old ladies that love Sex and the City and they love Reno, so I guess it does make sense.
And a lot of people, I remember CES both this and last year, I believe, that people, they scoff about the 100-inch TVs and the life-size TVs and everything else like that.
It's like, oh yeah, Bill Gates is going to have three of these in his house.
I have, the Red Robin closest to me has an 80 inch TV in one of the dining areas and it's mighty impressive to look at but it's there's certainly application for all of this stuff that you wouldn't imagine would be the result after seeing it shown off and the fact that they really do advertise it to everybody and the best and most rich people pick them up rich companies rather
Very good point is that we often forget about the many commercial uses of this stuff.
You know, there is a very large football game occurring next week that people are going to want to, you know, go to a bar together and watch.
And I hope that bar has one of these 100 screen TVs that they want to fit a lot of people in there and they can all get a good view of the game, you know.
One very small related note that I figured I would talk about.
I read something a while ago about corporate parties and big conventions, notably like, for example, the Democratic and Republican National Conventions.
Rentals for these kind of items don't really exist, so they buy up these huge gobs of resources, of digital resources, and I've even heard stories about...
and they sell that stuff off to recoup as much cost as possible dirt cheap so if you know anybody that puts together some kind of a party where they have to buy up expensive items keep talking to them after it wraps up because there's probably a good chance you'll get some serious deals on things if you live in a swing state that's likely to host one of these conventions in 2016 check Craigslist the next day that's what you're saying
I don't know that they... I'm pretty sure there's a lot of legislation that tries to go in about along Craigslist, but you never know.
Maybe a staffer got their hands on something and, oh, sure, I'll buy it and throw it in the till.
I mean, it could happen.
Trust me, you never know, because you're not... The Democratic and Republican parties aren't technically a part of the government.
They're their own independent things.
They can kind of... And trust me, as somebody who used to date a politician, it's... I used this word earlier and got yelled at for it, but I'm going to use it here.
It's very interesting to see how all that works.
Anyhow, that's all I'll say.
I got to ask you this before I let you go.
What is this I'm seeing in chat?
You still to this day have not seen The Wizard?
You know, I was wondering who was going to bring it up, but I didn't think it would be during this call.
Surprise!
The first answer is that me and movies.
Oh, that looks interesting, and it's not in theaters anymore.
Oh, that looks interesting, and it's not in theaters anymore.
I really enjoy movies, and I really don't see very many of them.
It's very strange.
but I didn't even see um not Captain N oh the the Mario Brothers Super Show I didn't watch that until Ryan made me watch it like two years ago uh somehow I missed that in my youth and plenty of other of these fun little gaming things that everybody knows about except for me well all I have to say is you better set aside 90 minutes next time you're in the Bay Area I don't have a problem with that all right all right buddy I'm gonna let you go try and get another call in all right you have a good one thanks you too all right bye
Very interesting, you know, that sometimes there's these uses for things that we don't always think about.
That's a very interesting, like the music DJ stuff.
Churches are a big business for that.
who would have thought of that?
I always remembered we actually had a really again this was at the megachurch that I went to god thank god I'm not around that anymore but they had a whole full AV set up with like something I want to say like five different sound panels spotlights you name it and an orchestra pit I'm not joking wow good big stuff alright we got another call coming in so let's go to it hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?
It's Jim Sowie.
Woo!
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?
Dude.
Rob.
Me.
You got an interest to know when you're going to put chains on your tires?
Come on.
I... Check the... For an interest to know?
Google I-80 chain controls.
This is public information.
Google it from last night.
I swear to God.
It's not... I don't make the rules.
The Highway Patrol or Caltrans or whoever does.
I think it's... Well...
Dude Bros!
crash their car, airbags deployed and everything, and scary stuff.
So an inch of snow or not, it's how it kind of fucks with those roads.
And again, I want to remind you guys, you're going downhill for a big part of that.
Once you cross Donner Summit, you're going downhill.
I barely step on the gas driving home.
Listen, Rob.
Two days ago, I got seven inches of snow.
and it was, I'm not kidding you, it was minus 40 Celsius, which is like, I think minus 45 Fahrenheit.
Yeah, the cars wouldn't start, Rob.
The cars would not start.
The cars wouldn't start.
Where in Canada do you live again?
I'm Elk Lake, so I am like, do you know where Detroit is?
I know where Detroit is.
I'm 10 hours north of Buffalo.
Oh my God.
This is where I live, buddy.
10 hours north of Buffalo.
10 hours north of Buffalo.
Oh yeah, I see this huge lake in Canada.
So you live by this big lake?
Well, it's the Montreal River.
I live, the Montreal River goes right through my backyard.
Wow, okay.
I'm 100 feet from ice fishing right in Pickerel, buddy.
I caught seven this morning.
But listen, listen, forget about this.
You were talking the other day before too about the craziest place that people have listened to Orange Lounge Radio.
Dude, like six years ago, I guess.
Like, yeah, about six.
I think you guys were on the old place.
And I started listening to you guys.
And then I worked at the sausage factory called Schneider's.
And I was an elevator operator.
I just moved the elevator up and down five floors.
with meat on it.
That was my job all day.
And then Sunday nights when I could get away, I'd go to the top of the elevator where the little motor is and stuff.
And I actually had an Ethernet cord that I pulled through from the third floor up the fourth floor up the fifth floor into this room in an old, old 386 or Pentium II.
It was an old computer.
But I could just barely run fucking Winamp on it and I would listen to OLR for the last three hours of my shift.
Oh my God.
We were in some empty ass elevator in the middle of Canada.
Yeah.
The top of a sausage factory At least it was the top of a sausage factory, right?
Wow
and that was it, that was my job every Sunday night because there was nothing to do Sunday night so the other shift would end at 7 but I would get paid to stay there till midnight because someone's got to be on the elevator like you know, fucking union jobs, right?
Oh my god, talking about the long Ethernet cable that makes me think of the year do you remember when we did the live DDR tournament in San Francisco?
B3 or whatever it was called at Pier 39 we actually broadcast from Pier 39 it's one of our more like if we were to make a resume like the Orange Islands Radio resume that would be on there because you know, Pier 39 is a big touristy spot
and we had to run, didn't we have to go to Radio Shack and buy like a 100 foot cable?
I think so.
To run it?
Yeah, that's what I had to do too.
I had to steal one from the IT department.
God.
Crazy.
I had to go to maintenance and get like this drill, dude, the drill bit on this drill that the maintenance guy gave me was sick.
It was like two and a half feet long.
with a big brick bit on it.
And I was like, well, where can I drill it?
But now how does it feel?
Anywhere you want.
Don't hit a wire.
How do you feel knowing now, like six years later, like no problem, just bring up the iPhone?
Oh, I know, right?
I don't know what kind of coverage you have up there, but I mean, even if on 3G.
Excellent coverage.
Oh, then you can.
We have DSL.
We have the same DSL that I had when I lived down south, but there's 500 people in my town, so it never slows down.
Oh, my gosh.
There's no tweeners.
If you go to the elementary school, there's 12 kids, I think, from the ages of 10 to 16 in the entire town.
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
It's so right away.
It's a different life.
Jim, you've thrown the gauntlet, and I love what SSJ100Matt is suggesting in chat.
We should have this topic as a foogle question.
Strangest place you've listened to OLR.
That's a hell of a way to— Good luck, people.
Yeah, I'm curious.
Who's going to be the top of an elevator at a sausage factory?
I don't know.
With a 100-foot Ethernet cord going downstairs to a manager's office that I had to break into.
I had to break into a manager's office and install a router so that I could take the cord out of the back of his computer and stick it in the little router bridge thing.
Loki, you know what I'm talking about.
And then you have to stick the other cord in because you can't just stick the two cords together.
No, no, no.
You've got to have a little router thing in the middle.
You're hardcore, Jim.
Oh, my God.
I was hardcore.
Don't take this the wrong way.
I was desperate to listen to anything besides Canadian radio.
I didn't know any more Canadian radio.
And ever since then, Rob, I've been in love with you, man.
Was it all Atlantis and Rush?
Well, shucks.
Every time I think about packing sausage, Rob, I think of you.
Well, the only sausage factory I think of is a place in the Castro.
And it's not what you think.
It's actually an Italian restaurant.
But it's funny because when you talk about the sausage factory, I'm like, oh, it's a yummy restaurant in the Castro.
The Castro is like the gayest part of San Francisco.
Yes.
But anyway.
Well, Jim, I'm going to let you go.
Before I let you go, I'm just going to say, in my defense about the whole one-inch-a-snow thing, come to my neck of the woods sometimes and get through a 105-degree summer.
Oh, I'm looking for two plane tickets now.
I can use it.
You'll melt.
You'll melt.
All right.
Jim, buddy, have a good one, and thanks for the story.
That was great.
You too, guys.
Everyone be safe, okay?
All right.
Bye.
You too.
Don't forget.
Don't forget, okay?
This is winter driving safety tip, okay?
Okay.
If you're going up a hill and your tires start to spin, you're giving it too much gas or not enough.
What a helpful tip.
and he hung up on that.
You jerk.
Where did you find that?
Very important Alan question.
Where did you find that?
It was on the nice leather recliner but under a Snuggie.
We couldn't find the fourth microphone for Alan tonight.
Apparently it was under a Snuggie.
Who knew?
Speaking of cold.
Yes, how many Snuggies do you have to wear for minus 40?
Is that like five layers of Snuggies?
I don't know.
I think your body just gets used to it at some point, you know?
Yes, it gets used to it when you're dead.
Stop it.
All right, let's go to the phones.
We have another call coming in.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma.
Hey, hey, hey, what's up, Ranma?
Hey, not much.
I'm in a bit of a pissy mood.
I want to vent.
Well, please.
When I think of where do I want to vent, I think of Orange Launch Radio.
Please, by all means, the stage is yours.
Well, every morning, part of my normal routine, I read the paper.
Until I get to a certain point in the paper, I put it down and go about my business.
So, I'm reading the editorials like I usually do.
Did I see something here in the paper?
I swear to you, I have never seen before.
I have a bad feeling I know where this is going.
Go for it.
You!
Coming off of what we explored on our podcast last week?
Oh!
Oh!
The title goes, Put the Blame on Video Games.
Never in an entire moment I wanted to punch a window so badly in my life.
There are people out there that think this way.
This is a shocking reality, and it is infuriating that people can be so ignorant.
What was the gist of the argument, or did you even get that far?
It was only two paragraphs from two different people.
That's all it was.
It's just...
Now, what is local?
Pretty much just saying the biggest reason for gun violence is the violence associated with video games.
They are a breeding ground for future murderers.
It is too easy to sit in front of a video game and shoot animated figures on the screen.
There is no moral responsibility for the characters you shoot up.
There is no pain when your character is killed or wounded.
It is all done knowing that the only thing you have to do is reload the game to get a new life.
A breeding ground for future murderers.
Well, DarkSakura, you know, since you're job hunting again, you could be a murderer.
That could be your new career.
Contract killer?
Yes.
I mean, because you play video games.
Clearly, what did you say you've been playing this week?
Mass Effect and Bomberman mixed with Pac-Man?
Well, shit.
You're a terrorist.
Bomberman.
You bomb things.
Except if I was actually going to be a contract killer, I'd use blades and poisons, so that doesn't work for me.
Not my style, sorry.
Well, you're going to have to play more Thief and Assassin's Creed.
Nope.
The only thing video games taught me how to do is throw balloons at people.
Because, you know, we don't know right from wrong.
And I can't do magic, so clearly WoW hasn't helped me.
Because gamers, gaming, Ranma has some, and you know, obviously I'm not saying this at you, but the person who wrote that.
Gamers, obviously, we don't know how to tell the difference between the real world and our digital world.
You know, just like movies are real.
All movies are documentaries.
The Blair Witch Project, totally true.
Right?
Wow.
Yeah.
It was a horror film, that's for sure.
Rob, the thing that really pissed me off the most about this is that something like this you would expect in the New York Post or as I like to call the Republican News Daily.
This came out of the Daily News, the leftist paper that I read.
Guess what?
Leland Yee is a Democrat.
Idiocy does not know Republican and Democrat balance.
There are idiots on both sides.
That's another harsh reality.
Idiocy is nonpartisan.
Yeah, idiocy is nonpartisan.
And there are people that are way too extreme in their thinking on both sides.
That's reality.
You know, after the initial shock of it, I realized, you know, this is why I'm in the middle.
I hear what both sides have to say before I make my decision.
That's the way I look at it.
Because this is just, no.
Yep.
I know we always talk about third party.
There needs to be a third party in this country.
Well, let's start somewhere with not being so naive when it comes to media.
I like what SSJ100Mass said.
I was a white mage in Final Fantasy XI.
I guess that gives me the credentials to perform surgery.
Absolutely.
I'm really good at... Crap, what's that surgery game now?
Trauma.
Trauma Center.
You know, I should be a weatherman because I was a black mage in Final Fantasy XI.
So, you know, it's gonna rain.
Bolt 3, motherfucker.
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
Well, Ranma, thank you for making us all angry.
Thank you for sharing your pain with all of us here and the listeners.
We really appreciate it.
Anything else you want to... Akuma JP makes a good statement.
White mage doesn't perform surgery, they just pray.
Heal, please.
Prop, please.
Alright, Ranma, anything else you want to share with listeners before I let you go tonight?
Yes, listen to this week's episode of Anime Jam Session.
We go over two hours.
We posted, we added a special rant because some dipshit decided to post their rules for cosplay.
Oh, I remember reading that, bitch.
Oh, no.
Yes, yes.
Because of me going nuts and a bunch of other people, she took the post down and she deleted her like page.
but it's still archived because once it's on the internet it's there forever and people have reposted the archive Ranma, this is for this week's episode of Anime Jam Session I'll let you borrow this, okay?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Oh yeah, she was... She opened up the bottom part.
She was awesome.
That was awesome.
How fucking clever is that, right?
So there's this screen grab on Tumblr of her and then all these Facebook comments.
She's fat.
I guess it really is bigger on the inside.
All this other just really... Garbage.
Yeah, garbage is the only way to say it.
And I'm like...
I thought she was hot, to be honest.
Yes, she was.
I'd like to see those assholes cosplay and pull off something that clever.
But the thing is, that argument's been going on in the cosplay world for years because there's actual photographers that refuse to take pictures of people that are plus size.
TigerClaw in chat says...
I was in Reno, that's my excuse I'm waiting for the podcast before I hear but I'm sure they covered it very well so I will tip my hat and mention Understation Live this week hopefully they get the podcast updated soon because I would love to hear those guys rant on the TARDIS thing because that was I thought she was a great looking gal and very clever
Yes, it was phenomenal.
Simple as that.
I want to wear that dress for like a wedding.
I would wear that dress.
Shit.
All right.
Ranma, I got to let you go.
All right.
You got it, bro.
All right.
Take care, buddy.
Later.
All right.
Thank you guys so much for the calls.
I do have to wrap up.
I'm going to close up the Skype line for tonight.
If you did not get through, though, I always say, please write down your thoughts.
Send an email.
Make Jamie work.
Mailbag at OrangeLondonTrader.com.
or Twitter.
I gotta get to Twitter topics as well.
Loki, did you have last minute stories before I get to the tweets?
There's just a couple tonight.
There were layoffs over at SuperBot.
Thanks.
Oh, no.
Yeah, Sony confirmed that, so that kind of sucks.
They didn't say how many, though.
All right, let's see.
Just a couple quick tweets here.
And actually, let me – I'm sorry, guys.
I'm going to pull this up.
Live radio, it's a blast.
I'm pulling this up on the show computer because I couldn't find my iPad because I think it's still in the luggage.
So I'm bringing up the show computer tweets real quick.
There were two, and the first one was from – here we go, Tiger Claw.
Disney is prepared to look at game violence because, you know, there is that call on the industry –
Are games too violent?
Well, Disney.
You know, when I think who's putting out the most violent video games in existence right now, I go, oh, shit, it's Disney.
You know, right?
But to be fair, Disney, you know, they stuck their big toe in the water with the more serious gaming with the whole split second.
But then again, they closed that studios.
I don't know.
The only violent game I can think of that they published was Turok.
Well, Robert Iger said, quote, at Disney, there's very little violent content, but I still want to make sure we're asking ourselves the right questions in term of that standard and also ensure we're willing to be a part of a dialogue in today's world that I think is pretty necessary in terms of what our role is and what our role should be.
You know, I got to be honest, I wouldn't read too much into that.
I think he's just saying the right answer.
because at the video game industry, you don't really want to poo-poo it.
I think it was smart that all those guys went to go meet with Biden when he asked the video game companies to meet with him because it's like if you don't sit there and represent yourself, somebody else will do it for you, and it's probably not the person you want representing yourself.
So I think it's nice that Disney said this, but it's kind of the expected answer, I think.
One more tweet here from SSJ100Matt who tweeted us, New age of gaming classifieds?
A group has started on Facebook for people looking to buy, sell, rent arcade machines.
Really?
Arcade Exchange, a Facebook community for buying and selling the classics.
Maybe you can find one of these for pinball, DarkSakura.
it is listed as a page created to help bring together the hundreds of collectors and enthusiasts from around the world into one place it's through Facebook but it allows members to post their for sale or wanted ads just for arcade machines and their related parts that's kind of rad I'm going to look at the Facebook community myself right now facebook.com slash arcade exchange all one word
Ooh, a Killer Instinct, PCB, HD, and Marquee.
It doesn't boot up, but it's $75.
That's literally just the little board, not even the machine or anything.
That's still kind of neat, though.
A Pump It Up Fiesta 2010 upgrade kit for $400.
Oh, look, pinball machines.
There's a Terminator 2, Roadshow, Revenge from Mars.
That's pretty cool.
Revenge from Mars, $1,800. $1,800.
Yeah, that one's going to be expensive.
Huh.
That's neat.
Thanks for that link, SSJ100Math.
That's a great one.
I may get rid of some of my stuff.
One more tweet from RossDLUT coming in here at the last minute.
I'll read this.
Can gaming get outside of the man cave?
The reaction of people speaking against the Dead Island statue suggests we're still stuck in.
I'm not sure I'm following the logic on that.
Wouldn't people speaking out against the Dead Island statue be a good thing?
Because that was pretty irresponsible.
And it was not, it was just, it was, it's just in bad taste.
That whole thing was just in bad taste.
But am I, am I thinking that maybe the statue itself suggests that we're still stuck in?
You need to send an email, sir.
I want to, I would love to hear your thoughts elaborated.
Mailbag at orange lingerie dot com.
