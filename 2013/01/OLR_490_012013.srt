[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, January 20th, 2013, the final Rainfall game is set to come to the US, Sony plans to make a big sale, and Disney Infinity is finally officially unveiled.

2
00:00:31,758 --> 00:00:37,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:43,924
[SPEAKER_09]: It is Orange Lounge Radio with episode 490 of our show for this January the 20th of 2013.

5
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,211
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, say hello to Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:59,411 --> 00:01:00,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not in the kitchen.

7
00:01:00,632 --> 00:01:01,793
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you doing out of the kitchen?

8
00:01:02,973 --> 00:01:03,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Hosting a show.

9
00:01:03,914 --> 00:01:04,234
[SPEAKER_09]: No, wait.

10
00:01:04,294 --> 00:01:04,414
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

11
00:01:04,835 --> 00:01:05,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

12
00:01:05,195 --> 00:01:06,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Put the angry emails down.

13
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:07,296
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not a sexist joke.

14
00:01:07,336 --> 00:01:08,717
[SPEAKER_09]: She was actually in the kitchen making coffee.

15
00:01:08,737 --> 00:01:09,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Making coffee.

16
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:12,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I have chocolate mint cream ready to go in my chocolate mint coffee.

17
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:12,779
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

18
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:13,459
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:13,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Minty.

20
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:14,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Minty Fresh.

21
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:16,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like tonight's show?

22
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:16,801
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

23
00:01:17,462 --> 00:01:20,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Say hello to the always fresh Tech Master Loki.

24
00:01:20,944 --> 00:01:21,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

25
00:01:21,544 --> 00:01:23,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember when Fresh was a compliment?

26
00:01:23,865 --> 00:01:24,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I remember the 90s.

27
00:01:24,846 --> 00:01:29,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Funky Fresh or I always think of Crescent Fresh from Syphil and Ollie, which was an underrated TV show.

28
00:01:30,464 --> 00:01:33,385
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Syphil and Ollie, not Syphilis, DarkSakura.

29
00:01:33,425 --> 00:01:35,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Be quiet when you're in the kitchen.

30
00:01:35,486 --> 00:01:36,886
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder how their rebirth is doing.

31
00:01:37,286 --> 00:01:38,307
[SPEAKER_07]: I say that because she doesn't have a mic.

32
00:01:38,327 --> 00:01:40,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I remember like, hey, Syphil and Ollie are coming back.

33
00:01:40,548 --> 00:01:41,388
[SPEAKER_07]: They're doing game reviews.

34
00:01:42,388 --> 00:01:43,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

35
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:44,569
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot after the first episode.

36
00:01:44,589 --> 00:01:45,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

37
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:46,390
[SPEAKER_09]: The first episode was funny, though.

38
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:51,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe, see, I think maybe that's the type of thing you're just going to have to marathon during a weekend.

39
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:56,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, some people marathon, what, Game of Thrones or what else?

40
00:01:56,412 --> 00:01:57,792
[SPEAKER_09]: What are the other big TV shows people watch?

41
00:01:58,153 --> 00:02:02,494
[SPEAKER_09]: True Blood, if you're Jamie, Supernatural, and only Jamie.

42
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Doctor Who, that's one a lot of people marathon.

43
00:02:05,494 --> 00:02:08,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Once Upon a Time, my friends, which, okay.

44
00:02:09,173 --> 00:02:31,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt Cross actually we did we did actually have an anime night at my house kind of we actually we watched Matt Cross Do You Remember Love but then we watched the live-action Rurouni Kenshin movie and it was amazeballs oh yeah you invited me to come over and watch that yeah but you said no we got stuck doing something else yeah but Alan was working the Rurouni Kenshin movie was amazeballs was it yeah good times all right

[SPEAKER_09]: Well, again, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network.

46
00:02:39,281 --> 00:02:43,084
[SPEAKER_09]: That is vognetwork.com right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

47
00:02:43,124 --> 00:02:45,686
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want to participate live with our show, join us.

50
00:02:51,711 --> 00:02:53,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Live.vognetwork.com.

51
00:02:54,213 --> 00:02:57,415
[SPEAKER_09]: And it is possible to chat and multitask and do other things.

52
00:02:57,455 --> 00:02:58,176
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't take offense.

53
00:02:58,616 --> 00:03:04,158
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to listen to the show, chat, and play, I don't know, World of Warcraft or whatever computer game, Civ 5, whatever computer game.

54
00:03:04,178 --> 00:03:05,759
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're watching sports ball, I'll shoot you.

55
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop it.

56
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,120
[SPEAKER_09]: That's disrespectful.

57
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,041
[SPEAKER_05]: With a rubber band.

58
00:03:09,081 --> 00:03:10,001
[SPEAKER_05]: That's disrespectful.

59
00:03:10,021 --> 00:03:10,801
[SPEAKER_05]: With a rubber band.

60
00:03:11,502 --> 00:03:17,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of sports ball, there was no Bobby Blackwolf tonight because there was some big sports ball games going on.

61
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Ironically enough, our...

62
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:24,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan calls them the 40 whiners

63
00:03:38,342 --> 00:03:39,643
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know I hate sports ball

64
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:58,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Outro Music

65
00:04:15,697 --> 00:04:16,497
[SPEAKER_09]: What's wrong with you?

66
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:17,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, or gaming.

67
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:19,659
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to talk about esports in a minute.

68
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Acid Vampire made me cry.

69
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,382
[SPEAKER_09]: But just to be clear, just to be clear, if I have a team, it is the Minnesota Vikings.

70
00:04:27,122 --> 00:04:28,523
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's because of Chris Cluey.

71
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:28,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Chirp.

72
00:04:29,743 --> 00:04:30,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris Cluey.

73
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:30,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

74
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:30,644
[SPEAKER_01]: Who?

75
00:04:31,044 --> 00:04:31,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris Cluey.

76
00:04:31,825 --> 00:04:35,928
[SPEAKER_09]: He is the guy that wrote, he plays World of Warcraft for one.

77
00:04:36,148 --> 00:04:38,710
[SPEAKER_09]: He's an NFL player that plays World of Warcraft for one, which makes him awesome.

78
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:44,073
[SPEAKER_09]: And two, he's the guy that wrote that, you know, profanity-laced letter about the whole gay marriage thing.

79
00:04:44,093 --> 00:04:46,355
[SPEAKER_09]: And like basically say, you're an idiot if you don't support it.

80
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:46,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's cool.

81
00:04:47,116 --> 00:04:53,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so, you know, I don't use this term very often, but like, he's like a bro, you know?

82
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Johnny apparently is spanking off to the show.

83
00:04:56,502 --> 00:04:56,743
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

84
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:56,843
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

85
00:04:58,684 --> 00:04:59,004
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

86
00:04:59,904 --> 00:05:04,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Says I can multitask with the show, watch Californication, laugh at jokes, bleeping off, and listen to the show.

87
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:08,587
[SPEAKER_09]: He means nodding off because he doesn't want to offend us, not sodding off.

88
00:05:08,927 --> 00:05:09,208
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

89
00:05:10,288 --> 00:05:16,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, that little gem from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

90
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,752
[SPEAKER_09]: What were you saying about a city vampire earlier making you cry in chat?

91
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:20,272
[SPEAKER_09]: What was that about?

92
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:23,073
[SPEAKER_05]: He said the firefly was overrated, so I said his butt was overrated.

93
00:05:24,912 --> 00:05:29,076
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay, because Brad from PodCulture is taking care of it for me.

94
00:05:29,236 --> 00:05:34,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you also can get mature responses like such in our chat room from a host, nonetheless.

95
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Live.VogNetwork.com Again, Jamie, you said your butt is overrated.

96
00:05:38,984 --> 00:05:39,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what you said?

97
00:05:39,785 --> 00:05:41,206
[SPEAKER_04]: But I say the same thing to my husband.

98
00:05:43,308 --> 00:05:47,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Except I tell him, like, he'll be like, well, this song's kind of weird.

99
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:48,512
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, well, your face is kind of weird.

100
00:05:49,953 --> 00:05:51,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Which just earns me a look.

101
00:05:52,307 --> 00:05:57,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so pun intended, the kickoff topic I wanted to talk about tonight was sports.

102
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

103
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, don't sit there and be all like... No, I meant your pun.

104
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:02,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

105
00:06:03,693 --> 00:06:04,533
[SPEAKER_09]: I am kind of punishing.

106
00:06:04,553 --> 00:06:06,694
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought you were going on your tirade about football again.

107
00:06:06,754 --> 00:06:07,935
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, everybody's got their thing.

108
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:08,855
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

109
00:06:09,055 --> 00:06:10,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care if people like sports ball.

110
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:20,841
[SPEAKER_05]: If they want the Stanley goal, you know, if they want the, I don't know, the Uber League cup, they're welcome to it.

111
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:24,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, how often have we talked about video games ought to be a sport?

112
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,465
[SPEAKER_09]: And that topic comes up once in a while.

113
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:28,667
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how people truly feel about that.

114
00:06:28,707 --> 00:06:30,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I say, like we all say it, but maybe we don't.

115
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:34,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, and I think about eSports and that whole thing.

116
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:37,594
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's still – eSports still feels very like –

117
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:43,358
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to say underground because I do see it getting more and more visibility, but let's be real.

118
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:48,903
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't exactly televise StarCraft matches on NBC Primetime or whatever.

119
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:57,511
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not really at that level yet, but thanks to the internet, and the internet is in many ways killing traditional broadcast mechanisms, right?

120
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:05,718
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, ratings for once powerhouse TV shows like American Idol are way down, and I think we have the internet to thank for a lot of that because...

121
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:09,279
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, people watch their Netflix or people watch the things that they want to see.

122
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:12,601
[SPEAKER_09]: And some people prefer to watch these esports things.

123
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:19,443
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've seen, you know, the online streaming solutions like Ustream, Justin TV, or excuse me, it's Twitch TV or whatever.

124
00:07:19,784 --> 00:07:23,365
[SPEAKER_09]: All that stuff, you know, is popular for the people who want to see it.

125
00:07:24,665 --> 00:07:29,848
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you log in to a site like Twitch that actually shows you, like, this is the game that's being broadcast most of all.

126
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:34,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you guys know what game is broadcast more than any other on Twitch TV?

127
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:34,950
[SPEAKER_05]: The Puppy Bowl.

128
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:36,530
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish.

129
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:41,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously though, do you know what video game is broadcast more than any other on Twitch TV?

130
00:07:42,493 --> 00:07:44,054
[SPEAKER_09]: StarCraft?

131
00:07:44,294 --> 00:07:44,554
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

132
00:07:44,955 --> 00:07:45,675
[SPEAKER_07]: World of Warcraft?

133
00:07:46,035 --> 00:07:48,376
[SPEAKER_09]: No, World of Warcraft is number two.

134
00:07:48,496 --> 00:07:50,878
[SPEAKER_09]: And usually when it's World of Warcraft, it's PvP.

135
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:55,260
[SPEAKER_09]: At least in my experience, I see way more PvP arena people doing that than anything else.

136
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,803
[SPEAKER_09]: League of Legends League of Legends

137
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:38,810
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't get far enough I played the little tutorial and then it got into picking a character and da da da and like I literally had somewhere else to be so I kind of stopped but I am gonna try I have a long weekend as do a lot of people uh this weekend from work so I'm gonna try and play a little more tomorrow because everybody always talks about League of Legends and it is free so you know why not and I also have Dota 2 so it's like those MOBA games are becoming more and more do we have any chatters that are really into that stuff

138
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:53,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Just out of curiosity, live.vognetwork.com Mako in our chatroom says, Watch today's Intel Extreme Masters Finals was damn fantastic.

139
00:08:53,773 --> 00:08:55,413
[SPEAKER_09]: I admit to being a sad man.

140
00:08:55,713 --> 00:08:56,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, why is that sad?

141
00:08:57,374 --> 00:09:02,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that really any different than the people that all gathered around and watched the football game?

142
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,215
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not calling either one sad.

143
00:09:04,495 --> 00:09:05,855
[SPEAKER_09]: You're into whatever you're into.

144
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:06,976
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm calling all of it sad.

145
00:09:07,856 --> 00:09:08,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

146
00:09:08,775 --> 00:09:11,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and then you're going to go home and watch Supernatural.

147
00:09:11,297 --> 00:09:13,419
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm actually way behind on Supernatural, to be honest.

148
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:14,299
[SPEAKER_09]: No judgment here.

149
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:14,940
[SPEAKER_09]: None at all.

150
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,422
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you'll post about it on Tumblr.

151
00:09:19,123 --> 00:09:20,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I did, however, finish Sherlock.

152
00:09:22,265 --> 00:09:26,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Acidic Vampire in our chatroom says, Sports would be more entertaining if the athletes were naked.

153
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:30,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Back in the day, the Gladiator Arena was back in the day.

154
00:09:30,651 --> 00:09:33,754
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think the dangly bits are hilarious, so I'd just be busy laughing.

155
00:09:33,794 --> 00:09:34,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

156
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:37,663
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

157
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:55,043
[SPEAKER_09]: There's only two sports I can think of where it's socially acceptable to run around in a Speedo the whole time.

158
00:09:55,504 --> 00:09:56,924
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them involves a swimming pool.

159
00:09:57,905 --> 00:09:58,945
[SPEAKER_09]: The other one is wrestling.

160
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Think about it.

161
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:06,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Also in our chatroom at live.vog.org You can also tell which wrestlers wear cups.

162
00:10:09,171 --> 00:10:13,713
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100 Matt says League of Legends and Korean StarCraft matches are broadcasted a lot.

163
00:10:13,753 --> 00:10:14,254
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

164
00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:19,935
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder what do you think it is about those types of games specifically that really draw people in?

165
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:24,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't you see a lot of competitive music-based games?

166
00:10:25,136 --> 00:10:27,837
[SPEAKER_09]: I hardly ever see a lot of competitions online about that.

167
00:10:27,897 --> 00:10:33,738
[SPEAKER_09]: What is it about those games that you think really draws people into esports and watching all that online?

168
00:10:34,578 --> 00:10:39,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think it's because they're just designed to be that way?

169
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:40,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Any thoughts?

170
00:10:41,827 --> 00:10:44,189
[SPEAKER_05]: I really honestly don't know what the appeal is.

171
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,214
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, truly, I don't know what the appeal is and I can't even fathom what the appeal is.

172
00:10:49,995 --> 00:10:51,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, to be fair, you haven't played it.

173
00:10:51,576 --> 00:10:59,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless it's like, you know, fantasy football type of attraction, you know, where you can see your fantasy team play or whatever.

174
00:10:59,923 --> 00:11:00,324
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

175
00:11:01,705 --> 00:11:01,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki?

176
00:11:03,547 --> 00:11:03,867
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

177
00:11:05,789 --> 00:11:07,110
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know why people get into this.

178
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:15,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, they tried to do a fantasy football league at my old job, and they asked me to been in it, and I was like, I don't know.

179
00:11:15,555 --> 00:11:16,215
[SPEAKER_05]: That was all I said.

180
00:11:16,816 --> 00:11:18,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what that is.

181
00:11:18,557 --> 00:11:22,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Watching the esports stuff is just more kind of... I mean, it's fun to watch people play sometimes.

182
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,542
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to watch Arena on G4 and that sort of esports stuff.

183
00:11:26,582 --> 00:11:34,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't know how staged all that was, but it's basically two teams and a commentary, and that can be fun sometimes if it's a game you're interested in.

184
00:11:34,907 --> 00:11:36,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if they did it with Grand Theft Auto...

185
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:40,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, you know, they'd have to show me because I'm so fucking awesome.

186
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:46,031
[SPEAKER_07]: But, hey, I'll wait until five because no one plays it anymore.

187
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,072
[SPEAKER_09]: What about competitive Minecraft?

188
00:11:49,372 --> 00:11:50,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I guess that's not really a thing.

189
00:11:50,952 --> 00:11:51,392
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be.

190
00:11:51,552 --> 00:11:52,332
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a thing.

191
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:52,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it?

192
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,013
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it can be a thing.

193
00:11:55,513 --> 00:12:00,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, competitive Minecraft they have, usually it's different game modes like the people set up.

194
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:03,235
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, I've watched videos of...

195
00:12:04,576 --> 00:12:17,751
[SPEAKER_07]: people just creating their own kind of games like one of which okay everybody we're gonna throw you outside of this house and the first person to was it the last person to survive is the winner or something like that.

196
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:18,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Minecraft

197
00:12:18,752 --> 00:12:19,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Battle Royale

198
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:59,405
[SPEAKER_09]: they actually do play the Hunger Games like that where they all start off and it's basically everybody free for all and there's chests where they find stuff to help them survive for the record I'm not talking about that iPhone game that was like a platformer or shooter based on you know what I'm talking about strategize, find the weapons find your opponents, that whole type of thing

199
00:12:59,716 --> 00:13:13,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Marvel totally bit off Battle Royale specifically now because now there's like an Avengers Battle Royale comic where they've taken like little bit characters from all over the Marvel Universe and make them basically kill each other off until there's one left.

200
00:13:13,457 --> 00:13:15,139
[SPEAKER_05]: And the cover is totally a rip off the movie.

201
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:39,397
[SPEAKER_09]: well Battle Royale kind of gained a lot of popularity again thanks to the Hunger Games I mean and you know obviously a lot of people saw the similarities and so forth um but I heard at one point the CW was kicking around a Battle Royale show it's gone it they they they are not moving forward with it that would that would definitely I would totally watch it they said hold on guys it was nothing more than like an idea we kicked around but still wouldn't

202
00:13:39,717 --> 00:13:44,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we can't put that out now that there's kids dying, you know, in the news.

203
00:13:44,378 --> 00:13:46,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would make a great TV show as a drama.

204
00:13:46,979 --> 00:13:55,522
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean... I'm really surprised nobody's tried to pitch a, like, a literal Hunger Games reality show.

205
00:13:56,022 --> 00:13:56,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously no death.

206
00:13:56,822 --> 00:13:57,422
[SPEAKER_09]: With paintball?

207
00:13:57,602 --> 00:14:00,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, like paintballs or, you know, non-lethal types of things.

208
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:01,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, silly things.

209
00:14:01,904 --> 00:14:02,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Severe beatings.

210
00:14:04,024 --> 00:14:04,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Nerf.

211
00:14:04,665 --> 00:14:05,645
[SPEAKER_09]: The Nerf Hunger Games.

212
00:14:05,665 --> 00:14:05,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

213
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:07,854
[SPEAKER_04]: They have laser tag jackets.

214
00:14:07,874 --> 00:14:08,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I would watch that.

215
00:14:08,596 --> 00:14:09,577
[SPEAKER_07]: The Nerfing Games.

216
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:10,719
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

217
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,661
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd even watch that.

218
00:14:11,922 --> 00:14:13,044
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what they need to bring back?

219
00:14:13,865 --> 00:14:14,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Laser tag.

220
00:14:14,686 --> 00:14:14,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes!

221
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Except not the bad cartoon.

222
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:18,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that a TV show?

223
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:20,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there was a bad laser tag cartoon.

224
00:14:21,406 --> 00:14:25,769
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Adventure Time There's a big difference between that and Funhaus

225
00:14:52,164 --> 00:14:54,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiger Claw says they should do a survivor for kids.

226
00:14:54,851 --> 00:14:55,453
[SPEAKER_09]: They did.

227
00:14:56,235 --> 00:14:57,117
[SPEAKER_09]: It was called...

228
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Lord of the Flies

229
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,720
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping somebody in chat will remember the name of that show.

230
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,661
[SPEAKER_09]: I need a reality TV nerd.

231
00:15:28,681 --> 00:15:30,301
[SPEAKER_09]: If Shane's listening, he might remember.

232
00:15:30,701 --> 00:15:31,781
[SPEAKER_09]: He'll know what show I'm talking about.

233
00:15:31,801 --> 00:15:34,002
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even remember what network it was on.

234
00:15:34,442 --> 00:15:38,563
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt says, American Gladiators was the closest we had to that type of thing.

235
00:15:38,883 --> 00:15:40,583
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, what happened with that reboot?

236
00:15:41,263 --> 00:15:47,065
[SPEAKER_09]: I was so excited because American Gladiators was such badass TV back when we were growing up.

237
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:50,265
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so just brain gone.

238
00:15:50,465 --> 00:15:50,985
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter.

239
00:15:51,065 --> 00:15:51,645
[SPEAKER_07]: It was watching...

240
00:15:54,534 --> 00:15:59,756
[SPEAKER_07]: For the love of God, it was, can you have a game show without all the reality bullshit tied to it?

241
00:15:59,836 --> 00:16:00,997
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's everything nowadays.

242
00:16:01,077 --> 00:16:04,218
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like trying to get in the head of the contestant and like, let's find out about their life.

243
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:05,319
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't fucking care about their life.

244
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:06,699
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see them play a game.

245
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:07,339
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.

246
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,001
[SPEAKER_07]: All I need to know about them is their name is Bob and they're from Detroit or something like that.

247
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:12,382
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

248
00:16:12,462 --> 00:16:13,662
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're a firefighter.

249
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:14,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

250
00:16:14,783 --> 00:16:16,223
[SPEAKER_09]: And they were in the military.

251
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:17,044
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that type of thing.

252
00:16:17,064 --> 00:16:17,724
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all we need to know.

253
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:20,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think it just didn't work in prime time.

254
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,131
[SPEAKER_09]: American Gladiators came back as a prime time show.

255
00:16:23,411 --> 00:16:27,655
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just like, no, this is the type of thing that's meant to be Saturday at 4 o'clock.

256
00:16:27,715 --> 00:16:28,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I've already found the best show.

257
00:16:29,057 --> 00:16:32,460
[SPEAKER_05]: What they need to do is take reality TV and just give it all to Canada because Canada does it right.

258
00:16:33,781 --> 00:16:34,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada does it right.

259
00:16:34,581 --> 00:16:36,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I am addicted to Canada's Worst Drivers.

260
00:16:38,281 --> 00:16:43,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Shane is asking, is it the CBS one that had the kids living in the town, Kid Nation?

261
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:50,470
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I forgot about that one, but that one got a lot of shit because it was like really psychologically damaging to those kids.

262
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:51,611
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another one.

263
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:52,972
[SPEAKER_09]: It was on cable.

264
00:16:53,908 --> 00:16:54,689
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

265
00:17:18,112 --> 00:17:38,944
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Minecraft last night for four hours Wow, what the turnaround Jamie's made Remember when you used to sit here on the show and say Minecraft's stupid I didn't say it was stupid I just said I wouldn't play it until someone paid for me to And now that someone paid for me to then I'm playing it But I was busy working on my underground lair Which apparently Loki hasn't found yet

266
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,251
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't really been playing, though.

267
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:45,032
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been trying to do things that involve my brain.

268
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:49,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's say Minecraft doesn't, but I don't really know what I want to do with it right now.

269
00:17:51,055 --> 00:17:57,778
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been trying to do other things, but then my brain gets too tired, so I play dumb games like Skyrim with a ton of mods on it.

270
00:17:58,158 --> 00:17:59,399
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really unstable now, too.

271
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:05,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was just doing other stuff, so that's why I was playing Minecraft while I was doing other things.

272
00:18:05,313 --> 00:18:11,175
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just sort of nice to sit back and have something mindless to sort of work on that's a little creative.

273
00:18:12,076 --> 00:18:15,677
[SPEAKER_05]: And trying not to hit those guys that explode, I hate them.

274
00:18:15,937 --> 00:18:17,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Because most of my houses are made out of glass.

275
00:18:18,218 --> 00:18:19,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, my roofs are made out of glass.

276
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:25,701
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got this whole network of underground tunnels built, and I seriously have a mole village.

277
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:27,462
[SPEAKER_05]: People can come live in my mole village if they want to.

278
00:18:28,162 --> 00:18:29,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I finally put a bed in my house.

279
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you play whack-a-mole in your mole village?

280
00:18:32,184 --> 00:18:32,324
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

281
00:18:33,644 --> 00:18:35,545
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did play a little WoW.

282
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,386
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to get back into WoW.

283
00:18:38,186 --> 00:18:44,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I played some Mass Effect 3, but that's just because I was playing around with more of the mods and I think I'm close to getting Flycam working.

284
00:18:44,428 --> 00:18:48,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to get into the whole... The name slipped my mind.

285
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,211
[SPEAKER_09]: When they make the movies out of video games.

286
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:51,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Machinima.

287
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:52,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Machinima.

288
00:18:52,511 --> 00:18:53,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to get into the whole Machinima thing?

289
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,233
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but on my Mass Effecting Tumblr.

290
00:18:57,673 --> 00:19:00,014
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I asked, because you're mass-affecting Tumblr.

291
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:01,294
[SPEAKER_09]: You're making still pictures.

292
00:19:01,334 --> 00:19:02,495
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of like getting your big toe in the door.

293
00:19:02,515 --> 00:19:03,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing lol effect, is what it's called.

294
00:19:04,195 --> 00:19:04,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Lol effect.

295
00:19:04,835 --> 00:19:05,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that like a thing?

296
00:19:05,636 --> 00:19:06,876
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just you, it's a bunch of other people?

297
00:19:07,096 --> 00:19:09,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Other people have done it, but now I'm making it a thing.

298
00:19:09,136 --> 00:19:10,317
[SPEAKER_09]: What if it's not very funny, though?

299
00:19:10,897 --> 00:19:12,938
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people think it is, so I've got 103 followers now.

300
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:13,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

301
00:19:15,338 --> 00:19:17,300
[SPEAKER_09]: How come we can't get that many people listening to the show?

302
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Does this show need lol effect?

303
00:19:19,822 --> 00:19:20,723
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs more mass effect.

304
00:19:20,763 --> 00:19:21,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell a mass effect joke.

305
00:19:22,784 --> 00:19:23,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Kaden.

306
00:19:25,586 --> 00:19:26,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Get out.

307
00:19:27,968 --> 00:19:32,051
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've also started doing this other thing that I call Shepard and Tumblr.

308
00:19:33,132 --> 00:19:37,556
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done three versions now where one of them is like Shepard looking at Tumblr on a data pad.

309
00:19:37,936 --> 00:19:42,119
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've exploded it now to where Shepard was looking at pictures of cats on Google.

310
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:44,601
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I have another one where Shepard's looking at Grumpy Cat.

311
00:19:46,588 --> 00:19:47,409
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

312
00:20:16,096 --> 00:20:17,917
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty much Tumblr in a nutshell.

313
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:19,778
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what I've been doing.

314
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that and politics, but whatever.

315
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:23,680
[SPEAKER_05]: SSU100, Matt, you disappoint me.

316
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:28,603
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to finish Mass Effect 3 and do it with the extended cut.

317
00:20:30,004 --> 00:20:36,247
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've also been doing that and trying to get back into limbo, but I've just really been busy.

318
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:38,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I start school this week and my class is all online.

319
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:41,590
[SPEAKER_05]: But hey, if anyone wants me to design them a website, I can do it for school credits.

320
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:47,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so J-Links remembered the show I was trying to think of.

321
00:20:48,244 --> 00:20:51,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Endurance was the name of Survivor for kids.

322
00:20:52,565 --> 00:20:59,586
[SPEAKER_09]: It was on NBC and then moved to Discovery Kids and it had the kids all split up into teams and it was just, you know, they did all these challenges.

323
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:01,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Who could survive the longest before their bedtime?

324
00:21:02,947 --> 00:21:03,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

325
00:21:04,407 --> 00:21:07,348
[SPEAKER_09]: I just had to put that to rest, that discussion from earlier.

326
00:21:08,683 --> 00:21:09,824
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

327
00:21:29,304 --> 00:21:32,085
[SPEAKER_07]: It was okay.

328
00:21:32,185 --> 00:21:36,127
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a huge fan of the MOGA controller, like the first one they put out.

329
00:21:36,687 --> 00:21:40,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Their new one that they showed at CES, the one that's full size, I think it'll be a little bit better.

330
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:45,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, once again, it's kind of like the Vita controls.

331
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:53,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Vita, it's cool that they have dual analog sticks and stuff, but it's just not the same as a console controller.

332
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:55,414
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little bit cramped, I guess.

333
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:57,596
[SPEAKER_07]: But it worked alright, and it was kind of fun.

334
00:21:58,336 --> 00:21:59,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Until my wife said, what the hell are you doing?

335
00:21:59,797 --> 00:22:03,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we went over to her parents' house, and she's like, well, you should bring something to do.

336
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:04,862
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, okay.

337
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:08,324
[SPEAKER_07]: So I brought something to do, and of course she did not, even though she asked me to.

338
00:22:10,226 --> 00:22:14,029
[SPEAKER_07]: So I brought that, and she's like, is that a controller for your phone?

339
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you addicted to games or something?

340
00:22:16,992 --> 00:22:21,395
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like, you have that so that it's easier to play games on your phone?

341
00:22:21,856 --> 00:22:24,438
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, yeah, because I got it for free.

342
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:29,880
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, it is easier to play games like that on my phone.

343
00:22:31,762 --> 00:22:32,182
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not bad.

344
00:22:32,422 --> 00:22:33,403
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty cool.

345
00:22:34,084 --> 00:22:40,389
[SPEAKER_07]: If I want to play a game like that, it's a hell of a lot better than virtual sticks and stuff on the actual screen.

346
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,091
[SPEAKER_07]: It worked out pretty cool.

347
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:45,514
[SPEAKER_07]: What else did I play?

348
00:22:46,471 --> 00:22:50,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, more Skyrim on Steam with all my mods in there.

349
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:59,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, I'm going to start having to scale back on some of those mods because I'm running into crashing problems where it'll just dump me for no apparent reason.

350
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:06,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I can't build a forge at my house in Hearthfire because...

351
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,512
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it just will crash for no reason.

352
00:23:10,632 --> 00:23:13,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not really sure why, but it's only when I build a forge.

353
00:23:14,135 --> 00:23:16,997
[SPEAKER_07]: And just some other weird stuff.

354
00:23:17,017 --> 00:23:21,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there's one I have, it's called Midas Magic, which adds a bunch of different magic spells that they created for the game.

355
00:23:22,562 --> 00:23:31,249
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is they have this thing that you put items in to craft these spells in the Riverwood Trader.

356
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:36,913
[SPEAKER_07]: And when it creates a spell, the spell book is marked as steel.

357
00:23:37,814 --> 00:23:54,365
[SPEAKER_07]: and so you can't get the book without like pissing everybody off and so like the first spell I got I'm like okay I'm going to turn invisible I'm gonna sneak and be invisible and I'm gonna grab the spell really quick use the spell and then maybe they won't notice anything

358
00:23:54,785 --> 00:23:56,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope, they all tried to murder me instead.

359
00:23:57,006 --> 00:24:00,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, I mean, it's just a minor inconvenience because none of them can actually kill me.

360
00:24:00,187 --> 00:24:04,269
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just don't want to have to kill them because that would be terrible.

361
00:24:04,489 --> 00:24:07,991
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, all these quests I'll miss because I'd have to go kill all of them.

362
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:15,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Then other games I played, I played one of the other games I backed on Kickstarter.

363
00:24:15,774 --> 00:24:18,735
[SPEAKER_07]: The, was it the Gianna Sisters?

364
00:24:19,355 --> 00:24:20,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, how is that?

365
00:24:21,176 --> 00:24:23,517
[SPEAKER_09]: I have that from the Steam sale still waiting to be played.

366
00:24:24,292 --> 00:24:24,892
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

367
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,744
[SPEAKER_07]: and then a new game I played on consoles this week, Forza Horizon.

368
00:24:44,465 --> 00:24:45,906
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually got into that a bit.

369
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:49,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the cult of Forza Horizon.

370
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:50,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

371
00:24:50,671 --> 00:24:53,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I played that a bit and it's fun.

372
00:24:54,455 --> 00:25:00,562
[SPEAKER_07]: First order of business is I drove on all the roads so I can get that achievement and I hit all the signs so now I get free upgrades.

373
00:25:01,102 --> 00:25:02,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you look online to see where all the signs were?

374
00:25:03,864 --> 00:25:07,067
[SPEAKER_07]: I was driving all the roads.

375
00:25:07,087 --> 00:25:07,907
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't even done that yet.

376
00:25:07,927 --> 00:25:09,969
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a couple that I couldn't find right away.

377
00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:14,612
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I was like, okay, looking at the map and kind of, okay, there's probably something right here.

378
00:25:14,652 --> 00:25:16,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's pretty obvious where they're hiding some of them.

379
00:25:17,154 --> 00:25:19,396
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you think of the whole introduction and the setup though?

380
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:23,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you have the same reaction I did where it's like, these rich, spoiled brats?

381
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:25,681
[SPEAKER_07]: That was my reaction.

382
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:28,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Not even that, but there are some things that are annoying me about it.

383
00:25:28,442 --> 00:25:36,746
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, I'll still get radio chatter where it's like, hey, did you see that such and such person has those signs out there?

384
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:41,327
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you hit them, you'll get this guy like, I fucking know because I hit all of them already, you stupid bitch.

385
00:25:41,828 --> 00:25:43,948
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need you telling me this over and over again.

386
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:47,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Or like, you know... I think it's just randomized, Loki.

387
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I understand, but they should shut that off if you've hit all the signs.

388
00:25:50,631 --> 00:25:53,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if, you know, you hit a couple of signs, you should...

389
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:54,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

390
00:26:18,155 --> 00:26:19,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, and then the radio net is hilarious.

391
00:26:19,917 --> 00:26:23,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, he's all, dude, they have an event where you race a hot air balloon.

392
00:26:24,321 --> 00:26:29,885
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, but if I heard of, like, this event I could go to to watch a car race a hot air balloon, that would be fucking boring.

393
00:26:30,226 --> 00:26:32,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Because hot air balloons are not fast.

394
00:26:32,087 --> 00:26:32,868
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fun race.

395
00:26:33,128 --> 00:26:33,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you done the race yet?

396
00:26:34,129 --> 00:26:38,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I did the race, but hot air balloons are not known for their speed, okay?

397
00:26:38,793 --> 00:26:39,874
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a hot air balloon.

398
00:26:39,894 --> 00:26:42,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Despite your snark, how do you really feel about the game?

399
00:26:42,076 --> 00:26:42,557
[SPEAKER_07]: It's alright.

400
00:26:42,757 --> 00:26:43,558
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an okay game.

401
00:26:43,598 --> 00:26:46,561
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like kind of Burnout Paradise Lite, I guess.

402
00:26:47,463 --> 00:26:48,344
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much it.

403
00:26:49,185 --> 00:26:50,146
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to play some online.

404
00:26:50,767 --> 00:26:51,107
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fun.

405
00:26:52,108 --> 00:26:52,649
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure it is.

406
00:26:52,689 --> 00:26:55,272
[SPEAKER_09]: One of these nights, we're going to fill up a race with all VOG people.

407
00:26:55,312 --> 00:26:56,173
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be interesting.

408
00:26:57,014 --> 00:26:58,316
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll probably still get last place.

409
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:10,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I had to go into multiplayer to do some of the speed trap things because fucking caravan, like always being from goddamn minivan, just like there.

410
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:14,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm flying over the hill like 160 miles an hour.

411
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Goddamn minivan right there.

412
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Like every time.

413
00:27:17,981 --> 00:27:22,262
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just like some stupid like Volkswagen Beetle or something.

414
00:27:22,282 --> 00:27:22,722
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like...

415
00:27:23,522 --> 00:27:48,472
[SPEAKER_07]: boom wait you you go into the world roam mode with other people you don't do by myself racing oh well no i have been doing racing i haven't really been racing too much of the events because i did i did a lot of the challenges and i got you know money from that and i bought some cars and then i i said hey i'm gonna go beat everybody's scores on these things and so i did that uh for a lot of it and kept racing back and forth uh lamborghini

416
00:27:48,692 --> 00:27:52,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Acidic Vampire in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Racing a hot air balloon?

417
00:27:52,674 --> 00:27:53,094
[SPEAKER_09]: The hell?

418
00:27:53,414 --> 00:27:53,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

419
00:27:54,354 --> 00:27:55,254
[SPEAKER_09]: You race airplanes, too.

420
00:27:55,475 --> 00:27:58,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Airplanes and apparently a helicopter, according to the radio, but I haven't done that yet.

421
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:00,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Airplanes thing, man.

422
00:28:01,177 --> 00:28:04,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of that stuff pisses me off because those cars handle like crap.

423
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:06,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Or like, I don't know.

424
00:28:07,879 --> 00:28:10,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, let's race this Lamborghini on a dirt track.

425
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,141
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that doesn't make any sense.

426
00:28:12,461 --> 00:28:12,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Or...

427
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:22,668
[SPEAKER_07]: or some of the ones where they're like, I want you to show off for the people and you have to do these cool, you know, you have to get like 28,000 points by driving down the street.

428
00:28:22,728 --> 00:28:24,630
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, how the fuck do I do that?

429
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you played a lot with the customization mode?

430
00:28:26,932 --> 00:28:31,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Brad from PodCulture in our chat room reminding us the creation mode in Forza is fantastic.

431
00:28:31,416 --> 00:28:32,116
[SPEAKER_09]: It is very good.

432
00:28:32,137 --> 00:28:35,159
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you've played around a lot with the like, you know, decal making and all that.

433
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:36,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I have.

434
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, you made like an Orange Nose Radio card, didn't you?

435
00:28:38,422 --> 00:28:39,063
[SPEAKER_07]: N7 cars all over the place.

436
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:39,383
[SPEAKER_07]: That's easy.

437
00:29:03,644 --> 00:29:05,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone made a tally card, but it wasn't very good.

438
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:14,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of just writing out Orange Lounge Radio, I actually pulled out my old business card, which is completely useless now since the phone number and websites are all incorrect.

439
00:29:14,868 --> 00:29:20,010
[SPEAKER_07]: But I actually recreated the logo that was on there using just boxes.

440
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:20,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

441
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:22,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anything else for your gaming week?

442
00:29:26,715 --> 00:29:28,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Call of Duty, I'm sure I played a little bit of that in Borderlands.

443
00:29:28,797 --> 00:29:36,325
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we restarted Borderlands on true Vault Hunter mode, and we're kind of back up to where we were before when we first started playing co-op, but

444
00:29:37,199 --> 00:29:44,225
[SPEAKER_07]: I was kind of pissed off at that because I tried, you know, we were trying to go back into the game and do all the side missions in the original difficulty.

445
00:29:44,805 --> 00:29:47,468
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, hey, you've unlocked this true Vault Hunter mode.

446
00:29:47,488 --> 00:29:48,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to do that now?

447
00:29:48,348 --> 00:29:49,289
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, yeah, sure, whatever.

448
00:29:49,349 --> 00:29:52,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's bump up the difficulty and, you know, we can go back there.

449
00:29:52,652 --> 00:29:56,275
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, well, if you decide you can change it later on in these settings or whatever.

450
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,176
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, okay.

451
00:29:58,517 --> 00:30:00,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't find the settings anywhere for that.

452
00:30:00,338 --> 00:30:02,440
[SPEAKER_07]: And now that I'm in true Vault Hunter mode, my game restarted.

453
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:09,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Except I have all my weapons and I'm still level 50, but it's still annoying.

454
00:30:09,512 --> 00:30:12,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, god damn, I was going to do all these side missions.

455
00:30:12,193 --> 00:30:13,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I just have to do them in this.

456
00:30:15,175 --> 00:30:15,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I guess.

457
00:30:16,035 --> 00:30:17,036
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be a little bit harder.

458
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,312
[SPEAKER_07]: So I haven't downloaded any of the DLC and I probably won't.

459
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:25,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, you know, because my friend's playing with me and I don't want to buy two copies of those.

460
00:30:27,337 --> 00:30:27,878
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, is that it?

461
00:30:28,378 --> 00:30:28,658
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

462
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:30,039
[SPEAKER_09]: My Gaming Week.

463
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a whole lot of new stuff.

464
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:33,302
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, revisiting old stuff.

465
00:30:33,602 --> 00:30:35,544
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as new stuff goes, there's some iOS games.

466
00:30:36,384 --> 00:30:37,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Final Fantasy All the Bravest.

467
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:39,887
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of you guys have been reading about this on the internet.

468
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:40,788
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of controversial.

469
00:30:41,248 --> 00:30:46,893
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to spoil my thoughts too much because I actually wrote them down for a VOG article that I'm going to post tomorrow after all the podcasts go up.

470
00:30:47,614 --> 00:30:48,435
[SPEAKER_09]: with some other articles.

471
00:30:48,455 --> 00:30:49,756
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some content going up next week.

472
00:30:49,777 --> 00:30:50,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Promises, promises.

473
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:51,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know.

474
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,463
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, Final Fantasy All the Bravest.

475
00:30:56,405 --> 00:30:57,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

476
00:30:57,126 --> 00:30:58,888
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I'm going to say for now.

477
00:30:59,389 --> 00:30:59,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Stay tuned.

478
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,193
[SPEAKER_09]: But I will talk a little more in depth about Temple Run 2.

479
00:31:03,414 --> 00:31:06,695
[SPEAKER_09]: sequel to Temple Run, which has inspired a lot of knockoffs and so forth.

480
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:11,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Temple Run 2 looks gorgeous on my iPad 3 Retina, I gotta say, for a free game.

481
00:31:12,236 --> 00:31:14,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Temple Run's a really great time killer.

482
00:31:15,437 --> 00:31:20,478
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's funny because this game gets compared to Pitfall and back and forth when the two games are kind of ripping each other off.

483
00:31:20,818 --> 00:31:29,040
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say Pitfall, and I'm talking about the iOS remake of Pitfall, or reimagining of Pitfall, let's be real, not the classic, classic Atari game.

484
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

485
00:31:53,337 --> 00:31:56,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, as far as PC and consoles go, not a lot of new stuff.

486
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:03,205
[SPEAKER_09]: I have Assassin's Creed 3 from the rental company ready to play, but I didn't get around to it this weekend, so I'm going to check that out during the week this week.

487
00:32:04,846 --> 00:32:08,389
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did play World of Warcraft, of course.

488
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:12,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Had an epic Civilization V match again on Saturday night.

489
00:32:12,893 --> 00:32:15,315
[SPEAKER_09]: This time it was myself and...

490
00:32:16,856 --> 00:32:18,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Four other people were playing.

491
00:32:18,317 --> 00:32:23,118
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was five of us playing Civ V. And we started, I think, around 8 o'clock.

492
00:32:23,338 --> 00:32:26,479
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to bed at 3.30, and we weren't even close to being done.

493
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:27,659
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.

494
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,820
[SPEAKER_09]: No VOG people, unfortunately, this time.

495
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,481
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we've been talking about, like, Bobby and I have been trying to play for a while.

496
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:33,662
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

497
00:32:55,504 --> 00:33:20,986
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever have fun all right um other games i've played this week um i went back kicking it old school on my 3ds playing a ds game i've been playing pokemon pearl because ever since that x and y trailer came out i'm like that looks really good like finally they've got the pokemon games looking like the cartoon series like it took them long enough

498
00:33:21,446 --> 00:33:45,059
[SPEAKER_09]: so I've kind of decided to go back and look at the older games in an effort to collect Pokemon to transfer to X and Y at some point so you know why not so I've got very far but I have about three four hours logged on Pokemon Pearl no particular reason I picked that one that just happens to be the one that I had in my collection from like years ago so and I never really got very far in it so I'm rediscovering it all over again there you go

499
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:53,665
[SPEAKER_09]: so yeah, WoW Civ, Pokemon I guess that's really about it nothing else to share for now

500
00:33:54,423 --> 00:34:23,493
[SPEAKER_09]: some random XBLA games here and there nothing worth talking in depth about so let's move on into housekeeping tonight you can of course always visit us on Twitter twitter.com slash OLR and you can also visit us on Facebook facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and again I would encourage you as well to check out the Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com and support some of the other shows that are on the network we got a lot of great shows throughout the week that play on the network and encourage you to check that out

501
00:34:24,153 --> 00:34:25,134
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

502
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:45,993
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

503
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:09,220
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called PressPaws.org, but it's Press P-A-W-S, like doggy paws and kitty paws.

504
00:35:10,481 --> 00:35:18,450
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought this was great, because obviously, Orange Lounge Radio, we've had a lot of loved pets pass away this past year, unfortunately.

505
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,351
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very tragic.

506
00:35:19,731 --> 00:35:21,472
[SPEAKER_09]: So what better time to bring up something like this?

507
00:35:21,813 --> 00:35:25,875
[SPEAKER_09]: The website PressPaws.org, Saving Animals with Art and Video Games.

508
00:35:25,895 --> 00:35:32,400
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're actually doing this whole little gallery, February 9th, at Gallery Nucleus, which I believe is in the Chicago area?

509
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,141
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not really here.

510
00:35:35,382 --> 00:35:36,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, now I'm curious where this is at.

511
00:35:37,783 --> 00:35:42,226
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the Twitter person was in the Chicago area, so I didn't see this.

512
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:43,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me see real quick.

513
00:35:44,915 --> 00:35:46,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry guys, I literally just brought it up.

514
00:35:46,696 --> 00:35:47,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no, this is in the LA area.

515
00:35:47,796 --> 00:35:48,136
[SPEAKER_09]: My bad.

516
00:35:48,476 --> 00:35:49,717
[SPEAKER_09]: This is in Alhambra.

517
00:35:51,198 --> 00:35:51,918
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's really cool.

518
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:53,158
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in the LA area.

519
00:35:54,119 --> 00:36:00,221
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I think they hit their goal already of $3,000 to raise the money and everything.

520
00:36:00,261 --> 00:36:01,922
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, check out the website.

521
00:36:03,002 --> 00:36:03,423
[SPEAKER_09]: It's cute.

522
00:36:04,143 --> 00:36:07,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at all the doggies with the question mark blocks and the goombas and wearing the Luigi hats.

523
00:36:07,524 --> 00:36:08,505
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to be more kitties.

524
00:36:10,385 --> 00:36:11,085
[SPEAKER_09]: There's another doggy.

525
00:36:11,105 --> 00:36:13,306
[SPEAKER_09]: There really aren't a lot of kitties here, are there?

526
00:36:13,766 --> 00:36:14,166
[SPEAKER_09]: There's one.

527
00:36:14,186 --> 00:36:15,366
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a kitty.

528
00:36:16,887 --> 00:36:17,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

529
00:36:17,747 --> 00:36:19,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely don't know your target audience on the internet.

530
00:36:22,168 --> 00:36:24,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I thought it was cute and worth a shout out, so there you go.

531
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:24,668
[SPEAKER_05]: It is cute.

532
00:36:24,788 --> 00:36:25,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

533
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,009
[SPEAKER_05]: And Tiger Claw reposted it in the chat room.

534
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:27,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

535
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:32,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to mention something, too, real quick about my gaming week that I forgot to mention.

536
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Forza Horizon.

537
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:38,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Love, love, love that Horizon Base Arena station on there.

538
00:36:38,965 --> 00:36:40,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, yeah, they've got some good music in the game.

539
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:47,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, a lot of them, you know, a lot of them actually songs I listen to already in the car, but make a new CD for my car.

540
00:36:47,785 --> 00:36:47,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

541
00:36:49,281 --> 00:36:54,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, I have to say, what the fuck is Blue Monday by New Order doing on that goddamn station?

542
00:36:54,124 --> 00:36:55,264
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes no fucking sense.

543
00:36:55,385 --> 00:36:56,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Why the fuck not?

544
00:36:56,565 --> 00:37:00,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's not a base song.

545
00:37:00,507 --> 00:37:01,588
[SPEAKER_07]: New Order belongs everywhere.

546
00:37:01,628 --> 00:37:08,352
[SPEAKER_07]: If it was the New Order remix that was in Blade or something, yes, that would totally fit with that station.

547
00:37:08,432 --> 00:37:12,594
[SPEAKER_07]: But New Order, that would be perfect on the Rock station or something like that.

548
00:37:12,614 --> 00:37:13,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe your base just isn't high enough.

549
00:37:14,495 --> 00:37:16,597
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have a lot of bass in it.

550
00:37:16,737 --> 00:37:18,518
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Blue Monday.

551
00:37:18,538 --> 00:37:19,259
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, come on.

552
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:25,883
[SPEAKER_09]: At least it's not that horrible remake that was done a couple... It was probably about 10 years ago.

553
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:29,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and those guys were assholes and said, well, our version's better.

554
00:37:30,386 --> 00:37:30,787
[SPEAKER_09]: In hell.

555
00:37:31,947 --> 00:37:33,268
[SPEAKER_05]: In nowhere.

556
00:37:34,629 --> 00:37:36,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on.

557
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:41,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get into gaming news and talk about what's been going on in the video game world this week with you guys commenting and participating live.

558
00:37:41,674 --> 00:37:42,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Live.vognetwork.com

559
00:37:43,055 --> 00:37:47,497
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are listening to the podcast, you can always email us, mailbag at orangeandreda.com or tweet us or what have you.

560
00:37:47,857 --> 00:37:48,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get into the news.

561
00:37:48,657 --> 00:37:48,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

562
00:37:49,317 --> 00:37:49,698
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

563
00:37:50,038 --> 00:37:52,919
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's talk a little bit about Nintendo.

564
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:58,901
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's kind of interesting that they decided to go ahead and merge their handheld and console divisions.

565
00:37:59,261 --> 00:38:25,215
[SPEAKER_07]: which I hope that this means that we're going to see a lot more kind of stuff that we used to have with even like the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance and stuff like that where you see a lot of synergy between the console versions and the portables like you know tying into each other like hey you can unlock crap from the console version if you plug in your system or whatever maybe we see something like that with the 3DS and you know the Wii U or something like that some sort of cross connectivity with some games or something

566
00:38:25,575 --> 00:38:26,376
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be pretty awesome.

567
00:38:27,136 --> 00:38:31,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, you know, better console games, I guess, on handhelds.

568
00:38:31,338 --> 00:38:35,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, I don't know, maybe because the Wii U is almost like a 3DS anyway.

569
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:36,701
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just tied to a TV.

570
00:38:36,721 --> 00:38:43,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was going to say, I thought this was going to go more along your joke about how the Wii U is just basically a DS without hinges.

571
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:44,005
[SPEAKER_09]: It pretty much is.

572
00:38:45,786 --> 00:38:46,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Although we should add hinges.

573
00:38:46,987 --> 00:38:48,668
[SPEAKER_07]: We should just, like, hinge it to the TV.

574
00:38:49,388 --> 00:38:50,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Clamp the gamepad to the TV.

575
00:38:50,669 --> 00:38:51,510
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go, done.

576
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

577
00:38:54,648 --> 00:39:01,977
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, actually, if you, well, I was going to see if there was a way to get like an external monitor or something like that.

578
00:39:02,018 --> 00:39:07,144
[SPEAKER_07]: They should make that an external monitor that clips to your gamepad that makes it like a 3DS.

579
00:39:07,204 --> 00:39:10,929
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, okay, I got the screen up here and yeah, I'm kind of fine.

580
00:39:11,365 --> 00:39:14,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let me read this next story because the two kind of go hand in hand, maybe.

581
00:39:14,888 --> 00:39:17,511
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to talk about if the two go hand in hand or what it can mean.

582
00:39:17,951 --> 00:39:21,134
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a report going around about the Wii U game sales.

583
00:39:21,754 --> 00:39:25,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, the game sales are actually lagging behind the Wii and the GameCube.

584
00:39:26,018 --> 00:39:27,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Please note the keyword there.

585
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,801
[SPEAKER_09]: It is the game sales.

586
00:39:29,881 --> 00:39:36,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Analyst Doug Kreutz of Cohen & Company is interpreting the software sales.

587
00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:45,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Totals for the November to December period were 43% lower than software sales for the Wii and 50% lower than those for the GameCube.

588
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:46,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Ouch.

589
00:39:47,532 --> 00:39:48,072
[SPEAKER_09]: But then again...

590
00:39:49,173 --> 00:40:14,121
[SPEAKER_09]: you know the Wii U I don't I mean even though a lot of people are like Wii U's got the biggest launch lineup ever and it's got all these games I mean the reality is a lot of those games were already played by people a long time ago and I don't think they were as exciting and especially alongside the Wii lineup the original Wii you know you had a lot of a lot more like everybody had to have Zelda and I think on the Wii U you get a lot of people that have to have Mario but I think people don't feel like they need

591
00:40:14,281 --> 00:40:14,642
[SPEAKER_09]: and much more.

592
00:40:34,461 --> 00:40:38,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Slightly earlier or at the same time, I mean, it's not a lot of really exclusive new stuff.

593
00:40:39,482 --> 00:40:44,624
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the big new exclusive games, Nintendo Land, was included with the console that most people bought anyways.

594
00:40:44,664 --> 00:40:47,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but Wii Sports was included with the Wii, which was an even bigger deal.

595
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:55,586
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's true, it was, but this is also being sold alongside of it as well.

596
00:40:55,626 --> 00:40:57,046
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's got to hurt the sales.

597
00:40:57,087 --> 00:41:01,788
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, every Wii came with Wii Sports, so there was no double skew.

598
00:41:01,808 --> 00:41:03,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, in the beginning anyway.

599
00:41:03,348 --> 00:41:03,948
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

600
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:27,357
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that's as big of a factor as people are making it out to be.

601
00:41:28,257 --> 00:41:32,319
[SPEAKER_09]: I personally have a real hard time plunking down $50 for a game with nothing tangible.

602
00:41:32,759 --> 00:41:36,560
[SPEAKER_09]: It's different when it's like $10, $15, $20 is about as high as I go.

603
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect example, Earth Defense Force 2017 Portable, Sigil only.

604
00:41:40,221 --> 00:41:44,502
[SPEAKER_07]: I was kind of staring at the screen because I booted up my Vita this week and I was like, you know...

605
00:41:50,644 --> 00:41:52,166
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking and I'm like, do I really want to spend?

606
00:41:52,266 --> 00:41:54,008
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not buying this for $40.

607
00:41:54,089 --> 00:41:56,652
[SPEAKER_07]: That is too fucking expensive for a digital download.

608
00:41:57,112 --> 00:41:57,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

609
00:41:57,913 --> 00:41:58,814
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot.

610
00:41:58,874 --> 00:42:03,180
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally forgot to talk about Wake Up Club, but I'll get to that in part B. But see, I spent more than a cost.

611
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Dan did anyway.

612
00:42:04,581 --> 00:42:06,464
[SPEAKER_05]: More than the cost of a Wii on my graphics card.

613
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:14,149
[SPEAKER_05]: and I can get games that play better, look better, and I can mod to hell and back.

614
00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:19,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you're going to be one of those people that are like PC gaming above all else.

615
00:42:19,172 --> 00:42:23,895
[SPEAKER_05]: To be honest, I think PC gaming these days is really beating out the consoles.

616
00:42:24,576 --> 00:42:30,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that now people are starting to realize that you're getting a bit more of your money's worth out of PC gaming.

617
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

618
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:58,455
[SPEAKER_09]: except it's not yes and no some games just don't run as smooth as they do on consoles because a lot of games are optimized for the consoles you know because again PCs all have that varying equipment which can make a difference but you know consoles everybody's got the same thing so a lot of times you know what works on the console doesn't necessarily work on PC I'm not I mean look at my gaming week I play World of Warcraft and Civ 5 I'm not knocking PC gaming by any means but I think there's room at the table for both

619
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:12,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think at this point given the limitations with the Wii U software base and honestly that you're not getting anything really new out of it except for that little controller that my money was better spent on my graphics card.

620
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:21,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Ross Steel UT in chat says, considering how low the Wii U storage is, I doubt that, talking about the downloads, 32 gigs isn't a lot of space.

621
00:43:21,285 --> 00:43:22,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's an issue too.

622
00:43:22,786 --> 00:43:25,068
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, granted, you can add your own drive to the system.

623
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:26,829
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they were touting that.

624
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:29,972
[SPEAKER_09]: It's too early to really see the impact of that, I think.

625
00:43:30,652 --> 00:43:38,959
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, maybe when there's more desirable stuff, you know, we talked about how the Wii U eShop is very indie friendly, and we anticipate there's going to be a lot of good stuff that comes in throughout the year.

626
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:43,243
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's still too early to gauge if a lot of people are actually doing that or not.

627
00:43:44,765 --> 00:43:50,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, RossDLUT in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com actually follows up with another good comment I wanted to read here.

628
00:43:51,130 --> 00:44:14,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Rostio UT actually left PC gaming because of the DRM and I got to admit a lot of the PC games are shooting themselves in the foot when it comes to DRM not that consoles necessarily do a lot better but like you know the SimCity shit like EA's upcoming SimCity game I'm sorry I am totally turned off to that game and it's because of the DRM Diablo 3 pissed a lot of people off

629
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:18,092
[SPEAKER_09]: I think people are finally starting to say, you know what?

630
00:44:18,372 --> 00:44:22,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we've hit our limit with how tied we have to be to the internet.

631
00:44:22,715 --> 00:44:26,377
[SPEAKER_09]: How much information we have to transmit from our computer on a regular basis just to play a stupid game.

632
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:28,038
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's to play with everybody else.

633
00:44:28,118 --> 00:44:30,160
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's totally not because of the DRM.

634
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,061
[SPEAKER_07]: It's to play with everybody else, right?

635
00:44:32,681 --> 00:44:36,483
[SPEAKER_09]: But people wanted to cheat in SimCity Who didn't cheat in SimCity?

636
00:44:36,683 --> 00:44:42,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody cheats in SimCity So why would you design your game to be online all the time so you can't cheat?

637
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:43,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

638
00:44:43,786 --> 00:45:01,274
[SPEAKER_05]: However, Mass Effect 3 Just for example, they wanted it online and they update the game whenever they want to Still hackable, still cheatable Well, thankfully the single player multiplayer But they will nail your ass if you cheat in the multiplayer But I'm also not an asshole and won't cheat in multiplayer So, just saying

639
00:45:02,881 --> 00:45:05,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe other people are assholes and like to cheat in multiplayer.

640
00:45:05,923 --> 00:45:10,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma in our chatroom says there are ways around DRM and for SimCity I will do just that.

641
00:45:10,487 --> 00:45:14,069
[SPEAKER_09]: That is exactly what's going to happen and I can't believe EA doesn't realize it.

642
00:45:15,951 --> 00:45:19,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody in a boardroom needs to get over their ego because just wait.

643
00:45:19,493 --> 00:45:24,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Before the game comes out somebody will have hacked that DRM and will have an offline, playable, downloadable SimCity.

644
00:45:25,078 --> 00:45:25,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait.

645
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:27,760
[SPEAKER_09]: That is exactly what will happen.

646
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,442
[SPEAKER_05]: There's already hacks for just about any game out there.

647
00:45:30,482 --> 00:45:32,143
[SPEAKER_05]: There's ways to play it without the disc.

648
00:45:32,483 --> 00:45:39,751
[SPEAKER_05]: which I'm actually starting to do with Mass Effect 2 so that I can run text mod I mean just saying because mine is a Amazon download

649
00:45:41,239 --> 00:46:02,934
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't said the G word alright so anyway the point I wanted to get to was going back a story you were talking about the console division getting merged with the hardware division could the Wii U's I don't want to say underwhelming performance but non-overwhelming performance be contributing to this probably

650
00:46:03,815 --> 00:46:17,266
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd imagine it would be because they need to kind of figure out how they're going to recapture the magic in the kind of serious rush for product that the Wii had, I guess.

651
00:46:17,466 --> 00:46:19,388
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really remember too much about the Wii launch.

652
00:46:19,428 --> 00:46:21,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I just know that the consoles were really hard to get.

653
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:23,312
[SPEAKER_07]: I can tell you right now they're not hard to get.

654
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:29,137
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, we're getting our consoles this early already and not like a year later like with the Wii.

655
00:46:29,837 --> 00:46:31,558
[SPEAKER_07]: That's because they're sitting on shelves.

656
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:33,059
[SPEAKER_07]: They are sitting on shelves.

657
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:33,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Stacks of them?

658
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:34,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

659
00:46:34,779 --> 00:46:37,620
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not flying off the shelves, and that's got to have them worried.

660
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:42,943
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they don't want to have another 3DS debacle.

661
00:46:43,763 --> 00:46:45,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but the 3DS is in a much better place now.

662
00:46:46,525 --> 00:46:48,407
[SPEAKER_07]: It is now, but what does that take?

663
00:46:48,447 --> 00:46:50,548
[SPEAKER_07]: They have to drop the price and put out a lot more games.

664
00:46:51,149 --> 00:46:59,535
[SPEAKER_07]: If they have to drop the price of the Wii U within the first year, that's going to look like double failure on their part.

665
00:47:00,036 --> 00:47:06,521
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know anybody that doesn't think the problem with the Wii U right now is the lack of exclusive games, basically.

666
00:47:06,901 --> 00:47:09,002
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, yes, there's an awesome Mario game.

667
00:47:09,142 --> 00:47:10,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Nintendo Land's pretty good.

668
00:47:11,163 --> 00:47:14,745
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, but there's not enough of that.

669
00:47:14,805 --> 00:47:17,787
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the 3DS had the exact same problem in the beginning.

670
00:47:17,987 --> 00:47:19,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Exact same problem with the 3DS.

671
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,429
[SPEAKER_09]: You had a decent launch lineup, but nothing sustained it.

672
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:27,552
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and now we're getting in this position with the Wii U again, which I know you'll get into in a minute when we talk about the releases.

673
00:47:27,612 --> 00:47:33,415
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, it's going to be until next Christmas when we start getting the stuff people really want to get.

674
00:47:34,235 --> 00:47:34,916
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the reality.

675
00:47:35,716 --> 00:47:41,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we don't even know what they have planned beyond... Well, I guess, I mean... They'll announce it all at E3.

676
00:47:41,921 --> 00:47:45,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Second quarter is going to be pretty much stuff that's held over from first quarter.

677
00:47:45,063 --> 00:47:47,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo doesn't announce holiday ahead at E3.

678
00:47:47,745 --> 00:47:48,585
[SPEAKER_09]: They never really have.

679
00:47:48,805 --> 00:47:49,566
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, think about it.

680
00:47:49,646 --> 00:47:52,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of the big heavy hitters are always announced at E3.

681
00:47:53,649 --> 00:47:55,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Other companies don't tend to do that as much.

682
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:59,773
[SPEAKER_09]: You might find out about stuff a little earlier, but Nintendo really kind of keeps it until E3.

683
00:48:02,358 --> 00:48:04,699
[SPEAKER_09]: especially with the new Xbox coming out this holiday.

684
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:05,720
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to have to do something.

685
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,701
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to have to really do something.

686
00:48:09,602 --> 00:48:13,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe the console's being merged so that the console people can work on a Wii U game.

687
00:48:13,283 --> 00:48:13,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

688
00:48:14,104 --> 00:48:14,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Push this button.

689
00:48:16,145 --> 00:48:18,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, hey, there's a 3DS hidden inside there.

690
00:48:19,086 --> 00:48:19,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Bet you didn't know about that.

691
00:48:22,728 --> 00:48:27,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe, maybe your whole little theory about the 3DS will soon become another Wii U gamepad.

692
00:48:27,609 --> 00:48:28,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe that will come to light.

693
00:48:28,769 --> 00:48:29,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

694
00:48:29,889 --> 00:48:39,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I don't think the technology is capable in those 3DSs, but maybe there will be a 3DS XL XL that will do it.

695
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,252
[SPEAKER_09]: 40 or whatever, yeah.

696
00:48:41,452 --> 00:48:42,252
[SPEAKER_09]: That will do it.

697
00:48:42,472 --> 00:48:42,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

698
00:48:44,332 --> 00:48:45,352
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an interesting question.

699
00:48:45,372 --> 00:48:48,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think the merging of the divisions means something for the next handheld?

700
00:48:50,998 --> 00:48:51,979
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess anything's possible.

701
00:48:53,141 --> 00:48:54,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on with more gaming news.

702
00:48:54,623 --> 00:48:55,204
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.

703
00:48:56,326 --> 00:48:57,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Stupid iPad.

704
00:48:59,710 --> 00:48:59,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

705
00:49:00,547 --> 00:49:06,491
[SPEAKER_05]: So, well, we know that Sony has been losing money left and right, hand over fist.

706
00:49:07,131 --> 00:49:09,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they would like to make money hand over fist, but they've been losing it.

707
00:49:09,973 --> 00:49:15,836
[SPEAKER_05]: So now they're actually selling their New York City headquarters for $1.1 billion.

708
00:49:16,837 --> 00:49:17,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony Corp of America.

709
00:49:20,879 --> 00:49:26,043
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be selling it off to the Chetrick Group, and it's supposed to close in March.

710
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:38,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, keep in mind that the company, it cost them, what was it, $770 million in debt.

711
00:49:38,527 --> 00:49:39,847
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're up to right now.

712
00:49:41,028 --> 00:49:47,950
[SPEAKER_05]: So selling off this money is going to be a big, selling off the building, sorry, is going to be a huge recoup in lost income.

713
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:53,832
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I'm not sure exactly what it costs to maintain the building.

714
00:49:54,932 --> 00:50:08,899
[SPEAKER_05]: But they have a lot of money to make up So you take a building I know land taxes in New York are horrible They're crazy I used to do property taxes Well we all know New York City is an expensive place to live It's no secret And so the buildings there are worth a lot of money

715
00:50:09,626 --> 00:50:17,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see anything about a relocation of business, getting a cheaper building, a place that's going to cost less money to maintain.

716
00:50:18,596 --> 00:50:20,498
[SPEAKER_05]: For all we know, they could move to Montana.

717
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:23,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine Sony in Montana?

718
00:50:23,921 --> 00:50:24,101
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

719
00:50:25,808 --> 00:50:31,392
[SPEAKER_05]: They are going to be allowed to remain in the building for up to three years with the lease back arrangement.

720
00:50:32,353 --> 00:50:34,295
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not like they're moving now.

721
00:50:35,215 --> 00:50:37,617
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that they're letting the building go.

722
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:39,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much they're giving the building back to the bank.

723
00:50:40,019 --> 00:50:42,381
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't heard anything about jobs affected or anything.

724
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:46,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I think it should be mentioned, Sony does more than PlayStation, let's not forget.

725
00:50:46,765 --> 00:50:48,206
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a lot at Sony.

726
00:50:48,986 --> 00:51:03,172
[SPEAKER_09]: you know not even just TVs they have a whole motion picture division and music and I'm sure I doubt very little PlayStation happens in Sony you know we a lot of that has run out of the Bay Area we know that well in Japan for one and in the Bay Area for the U.S.

727
00:51:04,271 --> 00:51:10,993
[SPEAKER_05]: The video games division for Sony is really, I think, it's decent but relatively small potatoes compared to the rest of what they do.

728
00:51:11,153 --> 00:51:12,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, sure.

729
00:51:13,314 --> 00:51:14,654
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm not surprised to see it go.

730
00:51:14,814 --> 00:51:20,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's way too much expense and it's not even that interesting looking of a building.

731
00:51:21,337 --> 00:51:22,197
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's in New York City.

732
00:51:22,237 --> 00:51:22,857
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a big building.

733
00:51:23,117 --> 00:51:24,317
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of stuff in New York City.

734
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:25,118
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't make it cool.

735
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:28,879
[SPEAKER_09]: It will be interesting to see who snatches it up.

736
00:51:31,314 --> 00:51:31,554
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

737
00:51:31,995 --> 00:51:32,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

738
00:51:32,416 --> 00:51:33,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Valid question.

739
00:51:33,738 --> 00:51:38,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably some corporation with tons of money and corrupt practices to screw us over with.

740
00:51:38,425 --> 00:51:39,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Bank of America.

741
00:51:39,467 --> 00:51:40,869
[SPEAKER_05]: God fuck Bank of America.

742
00:51:41,423 --> 00:51:42,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on, Loki.

743
00:51:43,404 --> 00:51:57,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so as we were talking about a little bit earlier, lots of games supposed to be coming out this first quarter for the Wii U. Although a lot of them, unfortunately, are just kind of like ports and stuff, but there's some good stuff.

744
00:51:58,207 --> 00:52:01,068
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's talk a little bit about some things coming out.

745
00:52:01,668 --> 00:52:12,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Need for Speed Most Wanted finally coming out to the Wii U in March on the 19th in the US or North America and in Europe on the 21st.

746
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:13,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing really special about that.

747
00:52:13,796 --> 00:52:17,579
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even really know how they're supposed to, I guess, off-screen play mode.

748
00:52:18,259 --> 00:52:24,744
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're going to have that and then you can use it to select your cars and keeps track of your records or something like that.

749
00:52:25,584 --> 00:52:30,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Also bundled, I guess, with the Ultimate Speed Pack which is some piece of DLC because that seems to be kind of the trend there.

750
00:52:31,668 --> 00:52:38,335
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the games that was supposed to be highly anticipated for the first quarter, Aliens Colonial Marines, now doesn't really have a firm date.

751
00:52:38,375 --> 00:52:43,040
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to be launching on the 12th with the actual game on the other consoles.

752
00:52:43,881 --> 00:52:45,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead now it's just kind of...

753
00:52:46,618 --> 00:53:09,620
[SPEAKER_07]: TBA you know so hopefully that doesn't mean delayed past March because that would be you know it's another big mature rated game for the console the amazing Spider-Man Ultimate Edition you know getting a port of a game that came out back in June fantastic and of course with DLC thrown in there as well

754
00:53:10,982 --> 00:53:12,023
[SPEAKER_07]: That's coming out in March.

755
00:53:12,483 --> 00:53:22,993
[SPEAKER_07]: And then two games that were expected the first quarter, the Game & Wario and Wonderful 101, which, let's be honest here, two first-party games, those aren't really that exciting.

756
00:53:23,273 --> 00:53:28,278
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know Game & Wario, they didn't really show a whole ton of that.

757
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,260
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the Wonderful 101, sort of like Pikmin...

758
00:53:32,782 --> 00:53:47,574
[SPEAKER_07]: now those are beginning to release date as far as the first half of 2013 so I will be willing to bet that that's probably going to be after first quarter I think Wonderful 101 has its anticipators I think you might be selling it short a little bit there it's not going to sell that well

759
00:53:48,903 --> 00:53:49,743
[SPEAKER_09]: It's too niche.

760
00:53:49,863 --> 00:53:50,604
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

761
00:53:51,464 --> 00:53:56,386
[SPEAKER_09]: I think only because maybe the Wii U hasn't gotten out there as much as possible.

762
00:53:56,406 --> 00:53:57,026
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter.

763
00:53:57,347 --> 00:53:59,828
[SPEAKER_07]: The genre, I think it's going to be too niche.

764
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:03,589
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a niche appeal to that.

765
00:54:04,129 --> 00:54:04,970
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's going to happen.

766
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:07,311
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, nothing even mentioned yet.

767
00:54:07,731 --> 00:54:13,153
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Wii Fit U is also supposed to be first half of 2013 as well.

768
00:54:13,233 --> 00:54:14,354
[SPEAKER_07]: So April, May, June.

769
00:54:14,394 --> 00:54:14,774
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

770
00:54:14,914 --> 00:54:17,135
[SPEAKER_07]: You got your three titles there.

771
00:54:18,475 --> 00:54:23,156
[SPEAKER_07]: One title is confirmed, though, for first quarter, and that's going to be LEGO City Undercover.

772
00:54:23,476 --> 00:54:27,817
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually launching on the Wii U in March, on the 3DS in April.

773
00:54:28,637 --> 00:54:31,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much the only game that I was actually looking forward to at all.

774
00:54:32,658 --> 00:54:33,158
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's that.

775
00:54:33,238 --> 00:54:38,399
[SPEAKER_07]: And then for the 3DS, there's going to be Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon, which is coming on the 24th of March.

776
00:54:38,419 --> 00:54:38,459
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

777
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,901
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say, well, of course, Fire Emblem in February.

778
00:54:44,941 --> 00:54:52,303
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say, though, that they haven't really announced any other 3DS titles other than Smash Bros., but that's just kind of like, hey, we're working on a Smash Bros.

779
00:54:52,343 --> 00:54:52,584
[SPEAKER_07]: game.

780
00:54:53,644 --> 00:54:58,145
[SPEAKER_07]: But they haven't really announced anything else for second quarter, first party, I think.

781
00:54:58,886 --> 00:55:04,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Brain Age Concentration Training, I think that's also February.

782
00:55:04,527 --> 00:55:06,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Pokemon XY, but that's the end of the year.

783
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:12,939
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a Pokemon Mystery Dungeon game that's coming out at the end of March as well.

784
00:55:14,574 --> 00:55:15,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Pokemon X, Y Pokemon X, Y

785
00:55:39,073 --> 00:55:39,774
[SPEAKER_07]: A really big thing.

786
00:55:39,814 --> 00:55:45,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless, you know, there are really no racing games aside from Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing.

787
00:55:45,238 --> 00:55:48,700
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that might be kind of good if you're into that.

788
00:55:50,987 --> 00:56:20,239
[SPEAKER_09]: but yeah it's a lot of ports so that's the only thing that has me worried I mean LEGO City Undercover could drive some console sales because that's a pretty cool looking game but it's not there's no games that really scream oh my god I have to get a Wii U now well the Need for Speed thing I don't think this is coming up on our show or else I might be duplicating something I hope not but I remember reading something about the whole that the Wii U version of Need for Speed will let you do the co-op where you both drive and want to use on the gamepad and want to use on the TV and I gotta admit that's pretty rad

789
00:56:21,399 --> 00:56:28,225
[SPEAKER_09]: They're able to install that fully functional two-player using the Wii U. That is something you're not going to see on the other systems.

790
00:56:29,466 --> 00:56:31,647
[SPEAKER_07]: For what it's worth, I think that's a neat feature.

791
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:33,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Give that to them, I guess.

792
00:56:36,171 --> 00:56:39,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, though, it's not like, oh my god, that's really going to sell it for me.

793
00:56:40,074 --> 00:56:40,414
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just...

794
00:56:41,872 --> 00:56:42,572
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

795
00:56:42,652 --> 00:56:47,074
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sad that, you know, LEGO City, let's not sell LEGO City undercover, you know, that short.

796
00:56:47,094 --> 00:56:48,995
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's a pretty awesome looking game.

797
00:56:49,575 --> 00:56:51,996
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just, I don't know.

798
00:56:52,517 --> 00:56:54,938
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's really going to be enough.

799
00:56:56,478 --> 00:56:56,779
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

800
00:56:57,179 --> 00:56:58,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, moving on to another story.

801
00:56:58,419 --> 00:57:01,501
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not about a Wii U release, but a Wii release.

802
00:57:01,921 --> 00:57:03,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, basic Wii.

803
00:57:04,502 --> 00:57:09,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, you know, obviously a lot of people still own the Nintendo Wii, and it's not like your Wii U can't play Wii games.

804
00:57:09,574 --> 00:57:36,366
[SPEAKER_09]: by the way I also transferred all my data from the Wii to the Wii U this week it was pretty painless so now I can play my virtual console games with the HDMI collection woohoo but I really wish sorry I'll get to this story eventually I need to rant though I really wish because this pisses me off that virtual console is too stupid for this why doesn't the system know to automatically side letterbox or put into the right aspect ratio the virtual console games

805
00:57:37,046 --> 00:57:38,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Why does it still force them to widescreen?

806
00:57:39,568 --> 00:57:41,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't it know to script?

807
00:57:41,549 --> 00:57:44,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I can set it on my TV, sure, but that's such a pain in the ass.

808
00:57:45,372 --> 00:57:52,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't when I boot up Zelda, which is a 4.3 game, like Zelda was not in widescreen on the NES, why can't it just know, oh, flip the resolution back to 4.3?

809
00:57:55,131 --> 00:57:56,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Outro Outro Outro Outro

810
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:19,451
[SPEAKER_07]: It won't be happening.

811
00:58:19,471 --> 00:58:21,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we absolutely sure of that?

812
00:58:21,113 --> 00:58:22,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I bet it's going to happen.

813
00:58:23,955 --> 00:58:26,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at the virtual console games I have on 3DS.

814
00:58:26,478 --> 00:58:30,281
[SPEAKER_09]: I have not bought anything that wasn't free or not available.

815
00:58:30,742 --> 00:58:31,723
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a couple Game Boy games.

816
00:58:32,163 --> 00:58:33,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Those weren't available before.

817
00:58:34,025 --> 00:58:34,365
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

818
00:58:34,966 --> 00:58:36,768
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe I have maybe two Game Boy games.

819
00:58:38,405 --> 00:58:47,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying, I bet you they're going to do that kind of crap, because they try to pull that shit with... Are they still releasing those 3DS games, the retro ones that are in 3D now?

820
00:58:48,794 --> 00:58:50,255
[SPEAKER_07]: They kind of say, yeah, fuck it.

821
00:58:50,395 --> 00:58:53,377
[SPEAKER_09]: There's non-3D ones, all the Mega Man games, that was a big deal, remember?

822
00:58:53,437 --> 00:58:56,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I understand that, but are they doing those, remember how they're Excitebike and stuff like that?

823
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,301
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there's been one in a while.

824
00:58:58,742 --> 00:58:59,402
[SPEAKER_07]: There were a few.

825
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:02,605
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, eh, fuck it, no one's buying them, you know?

826
00:59:02,935 --> 00:59:09,110
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like Xevious and Urban Champion and all these interesting ones but I haven't seen one in a little while.

827
00:59:11,376 --> 00:59:11,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

828
00:59:13,052 --> 00:59:15,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I thought we were going to get like Zelda in 3D and stuff.

829
00:59:16,394 --> 00:59:16,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess not.

830
00:59:16,855 --> 00:59:17,475
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it was too hard.

831
00:59:17,575 --> 00:59:19,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, back to what I was originally going to talk about.

832
00:59:19,637 --> 00:59:27,122
[SPEAKER_09]: A Wii game coming out on the Wii U. XSEED has decided to bring over Pandora's Tower to the Wii.

833
00:59:27,202 --> 00:59:32,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, this is important because this was the last Operation Rainfall.

834
00:59:32,066 --> 00:59:32,586
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys remember that?

835
00:59:32,606 --> 00:59:38,210
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the last of the three Op Rainfall games that Nintendo was never going to bring over here.

836
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:41,833
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they finally brought out Xenoblade Chronicles, although it had that

837
00:59:42,533 --> 00:59:44,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Exceed or Ignition or Axis game localization.

838
01:00:03,163 --> 01:00:03,704
[SPEAKER_09]: So here they go.

839
01:00:03,724 --> 01:00:05,545
[SPEAKER_09]: They're stepping up and putting out Pandora's Tower.

840
01:00:05,825 --> 01:00:11,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Now it's going to be interesting to see how this does when the Wii U is what's really being pushed right now.

841
01:00:12,151 --> 01:00:21,860
[SPEAKER_09]: But a lot of folks thought that Last Story, when it got price cuts $20, made a great pickup game for people to get with the Wii U. Because again, why not?

842
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,221
[SPEAKER_09]: You can use the backwards compatibility.

843
01:00:23,341 --> 01:00:23,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Very easy.

844
01:00:25,303 --> 01:00:26,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Any interest in Pandora's Tower, Loki?

845
01:00:28,346 --> 01:00:28,526
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

846
01:00:28,546 --> 01:00:28,586
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

847
01:00:30,334 --> 01:00:31,395
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't play anything on my Wii.

848
01:00:31,875 --> 01:00:32,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it's funny.

849
01:00:32,635 --> 01:00:36,236
[SPEAKER_07]: We booted up the Wii because Nelly was going to play some more Animal Crossing.

850
01:00:36,516 --> 01:00:42,577
[SPEAKER_07]: So I charged our controllers and... Animal Crossing.

851
01:00:42,977 --> 01:00:43,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I'm eating.

852
01:00:44,197 --> 01:00:45,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Animal Crossing is on 3DS.

853
01:00:45,598 --> 01:00:46,378
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a game coming out.

854
01:00:47,098 --> 01:00:47,738
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's not dated.

855
01:00:48,738 --> 01:00:49,418
[SPEAKER_09]: It's out in Japan.

856
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:51,239
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a fourth quarter game.

857
01:00:51,259 --> 01:00:53,719
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be sad that it's gotten that delayed.

858
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:55,000
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it can be.

859
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,260
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got to be sooner than that.

860
01:00:57,162 --> 01:01:24,670
[SPEAKER_07]: probably yeah it could be a May game we'll see but I mean seriously though we forgot all about it because it was that you know highly anticipated that we completely forgot about the game I don't know what's it called Animal Crossing Jump Out or something like that Animal Crossing Jump Out no it's like Animal Crossing it's the same fucking game on 3DS I don't know

861
01:01:25,006 --> 01:01:30,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Occupy Nooks I wish, that would be great Alright, moving on, more news

862
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:36,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.

863
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you know that you play as Raiden in that, right?

864
01:01:39,522 --> 01:01:46,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's not what Kojima originally wanted, but he did let go of the story writing so that he could focus on production.

865
01:01:47,206 --> 01:01:54,471
[SPEAKER_05]: He wanted it to be Gray Fox, who, as we all know from Metal Gear Solid, and he was a character that's...

866
01:01:55,371 --> 01:02:04,858
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of crap happened to him, and a very, very crazy story if you'd followed the MSX Metal Gear games and really were a fan of the series.

867
01:02:05,759 --> 01:02:11,183
[SPEAKER_05]: But he said, no, we're going to let the kids play, and they want Raiden, and they want Hack and Slash, so let's go with Raiden.

868
01:02:12,819 --> 01:02:16,060
[SPEAKER_05]: It would have been so awesome to have a game with Gray Fox, don't you think?

869
01:02:16,961 --> 01:02:19,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead he gets stepped on by Metal Gear.

870
01:02:20,382 --> 01:02:21,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Sad trombone.

871
01:02:23,164 --> 01:02:30,207
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's funny, I actually forgot to mention, I played Anarchy Reigns during my game week this week, and it was very subpar.

872
01:02:30,787 --> 01:02:31,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

873
01:02:31,327 --> 01:02:34,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Which saddened me because I love Platinum games, and...

874
01:02:35,769 --> 01:02:37,990
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just... It was a mess.

875
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,631
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not set up well at all.

876
01:02:39,932 --> 01:02:41,192
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's no story, which is fine.

877
01:02:41,212 --> 01:02:46,716
[SPEAKER_07]: I find no story being in there, but it was confusing on what the hell you had to do, and the gameplay was just kind of like, eh.

878
01:02:47,816 --> 01:02:49,537
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like, Mad World was so much better.

879
01:02:50,038 --> 01:02:54,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is, you know, Jack having to do this crap?

880
01:02:55,361 --> 01:02:56,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Jack's for the play in HD, though.

881
01:02:56,842 --> 01:02:58,663
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun to play as that character, but it's just...

882
01:02:59,683 --> 01:03:00,903
[SPEAKER_07]: I just didn't know what the fuck was going on.

883
01:03:01,023 --> 01:03:03,664
[SPEAKER_07]: But I hope that that's not the case with Metal Gear Rising.

884
01:03:04,604 --> 01:03:06,545
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think Metal Gear Rising looks pretty awesome.

885
01:03:06,965 --> 01:03:12,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, also there was a comment regarding the trailer that might be Metal Gear Solid V, The Phantom Pain.

886
01:03:12,426 --> 01:03:13,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, that thing.

887
01:03:13,566 --> 01:03:16,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Kojima said that he really liked the trailer and the lighting was very good.

888
01:03:20,548 --> 01:03:26,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Metal Gear Rising Revengeance is going to be out on February 22nd, so keep your eyes open if you are interested.

889
01:03:27,799 --> 01:03:31,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out very soon.

890
01:03:32,782 --> 01:03:33,783
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not much this week.

891
01:03:34,083 --> 01:03:40,207
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty much just Ni No Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch on PS3 this week.

892
01:03:40,687 --> 01:03:41,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is not bad.

893
01:03:41,488 --> 01:03:44,390
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's supposed to be a pretty awesome PlayStation 3 game.

894
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:45,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I want to check that out.

895
01:03:46,511 --> 01:03:49,072
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about the $60 though.

896
01:03:49,193 --> 01:03:51,714
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I might rent it or wait for credit.

897
01:03:51,734 --> 01:03:53,215
[SPEAKER_07]: The reviews have said it's been worth it.

898
01:03:53,435 --> 01:03:53,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

899
01:03:53,615 --> 01:03:55,997
[SPEAKER_07]: They said it's basically... What was the...

900
01:03:56,617 --> 01:04:01,959
[SPEAKER_07]: The only other thing that's coming out this week is a Sims 3 expansion pack 70s, 80s, and 90s stuff Do people still play Sims 3?

901
01:04:25,703 --> 01:04:33,057
[SPEAKER_07]: they still have a ton of fucking expansions coming out for the thing so I don't understand why and also apparently apparently that's it

902
01:04:34,127 --> 01:04:37,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, going to Japan, Hitman Absolution on the Xbox 360.

903
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:43,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, this is the Japanese version, making its way out on January 24th, as well as a game called Instant Brain, but that's a price reduction.

904
01:04:43,556 --> 01:04:44,517
[SPEAKER_09]: That was already out before.

905
01:04:44,757 --> 01:04:47,800
[SPEAKER_09]: That is going into Cave, the best series, because that is a cave game.

906
01:04:48,621 --> 01:04:49,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the Xbox 360.

907
01:04:49,802 --> 01:04:52,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to the PlayStation 3, things are a little bit bigger over there.

908
01:04:53,045 --> 01:04:56,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobunaga Yoyabu Online 10th Anniversary Box.

909
01:04:57,009 --> 01:04:58,070
[SPEAKER_09]: No Paradox, God Something

910
01:05:20,923 --> 01:05:23,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I'm trying to see, let's see if this is a game that we know over here.

911
01:05:24,525 --> 01:05:26,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, hold on, we wouldn't know that from the limited edition art.

912
01:05:26,986 --> 01:05:28,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me look at regular edition.

913
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:31,688
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to see if this is a game I recognize at all.

914
01:05:32,529 --> 01:05:33,849
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't recognize it with the box art.

915
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:37,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it looks like a Disgaea Tactics-y type of game.

916
01:05:37,591 --> 01:05:38,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a Tactics game.

917
01:05:39,972 --> 01:05:41,173
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet it's based on anime or something.

918
01:05:41,193 --> 01:05:41,393
[SPEAKER_01]: With mates.

919
01:05:41,413 --> 01:05:42,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of you chat will know.

920
01:05:42,873 --> 01:05:43,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, of course.

921
01:05:43,934 --> 01:05:44,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

922
01:05:45,891 --> 01:05:47,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody in chat, I bet, knows more about that.

923
01:05:48,012 --> 01:05:48,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Mag.

924
01:05:48,793 --> 01:05:49,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember Mag?

925
01:05:49,974 --> 01:05:51,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Is also getting a price reduction.

926
01:05:51,094 --> 01:05:52,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Goes into PlayStation 3 the best.

927
01:05:52,335 --> 01:05:54,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, those are Japanese releases.

928
01:05:54,737 --> 01:05:56,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Looking at the handhelds really quick.

929
01:05:56,238 --> 01:05:59,280
[SPEAKER_09]: On the PlayStation Vita, pretty busy week, actually.

930
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:07,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Demon Gaze, Genkai Totsuki Monster Monpiece, as well as Sakuraso no Pet no Kanojo.

931
01:06:08,726 --> 01:06:10,267
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm assuming that's a Pet Sim game.

932
01:06:10,647 --> 01:06:11,888
[SPEAKER_09]: All on the Vita.

933
01:06:11,908 --> 01:06:12,608
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

934
01:06:12,628 --> 01:06:13,489
[SPEAKER_09]: It talks about little girls.

935
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,451
[SPEAKER_09]: On the Wii U, nothing.

936
01:06:16,671 --> 01:06:19,514
[SPEAKER_09]: No more Wii U games until January 31st is the next one.

937
01:06:20,315 --> 01:06:23,637
[SPEAKER_09]: On the Nintendo 3DS, however, ooh, also nothing.

938
01:06:24,378 --> 01:06:25,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing really on the 3DS.

939
01:06:25,979 --> 01:06:31,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo has very little activity over there until February 7th is the Dragon Quest VII remake.

940
01:06:31,304 --> 01:06:36,568
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure a lot of people will be very excited about that on the 3DS, which I can imagine they won't bring that over here.

941
01:06:36,929 --> 01:06:38,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo's having a nap.

942
01:06:39,251 --> 01:06:39,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe a little bit.

943
01:06:40,752 --> 01:06:41,152
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

944
01:06:41,172 --> 01:06:42,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are your Japanese releases.

945
01:06:42,845 --> 01:06:44,285
[SPEAKER_05]: We only have two things for the UK.

946
01:06:44,346 --> 01:06:46,346
[SPEAKER_05]: On the 24th, we have Strike Suit Zero.

947
01:06:46,426 --> 01:06:47,827
[SPEAKER_05]: And the 25th, Devil May Cry.

948
01:06:49,287 --> 01:06:49,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, yes.

949
01:06:49,647 --> 01:06:50,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Devil May Cry.

950
01:06:51,188 --> 01:06:52,008
[SPEAKER_09]: That came out this week.

951
01:06:52,448 --> 01:06:52,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

952
01:06:52,788 --> 01:06:53,428
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to check it out.

953
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:53,668
[SPEAKER_09]: I do.

954
01:06:54,389 --> 01:06:54,669
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

955
01:06:55,289 --> 01:06:56,789
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple more news stories for you guys.

956
01:06:56,809 --> 01:06:58,890
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the classic game of the week.

957
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:00,210
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, Loki.

958
01:07:00,691 --> 01:07:01,091
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

959
01:07:01,631 --> 01:07:03,351
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's talk about Majesco.

960
01:07:03,571 --> 01:07:08,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Majesco is, I would say, not long for this world anymore.

961
01:07:09,433 --> 01:07:11,214
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've, you know...

962
01:07:12,034 --> 01:07:13,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely had some problems.

963
01:07:13,635 --> 01:07:21,902
[SPEAKER_07]: The company experienced a loss of $2.7 million as compared to, I guess, the $3.9 million loss the previous year.

964
01:07:22,862 --> 01:07:33,671
[SPEAKER_07]: And they said the revenues are up to $132.3 million, but concluded with a net income of $4.6 million down $2 million from last year.

965
01:07:34,331 --> 01:07:38,614
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's be honest here, Majesco, they don't have a lot of games that they're releasing.

966
01:07:38,634 --> 01:07:40,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Cookie Mama is not selling like it used to.

967
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:44,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Their last say need investing mama, right?

968
01:07:44,638 --> 01:07:45,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that the joke you made on Twitter?

969
01:07:48,681 --> 01:07:49,261
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember.

970
01:07:50,021 --> 01:07:51,202
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, come on.

971
01:07:51,222 --> 01:07:55,805
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the company that decided that, hey, NBA Baller Beats is a good idea.

972
01:07:56,805 --> 01:07:57,506
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so...

973
01:07:58,587 --> 01:08:08,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, I mean, looking forward to what they have, they've only really got... They have the Young Justice license, so they've got that game coming out at the end of February.

974
01:08:09,357 --> 01:08:14,301
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, Majesco's not one of those companies that puts out these really huge AAA games anymore.

975
01:08:14,602 --> 01:08:15,402
[SPEAKER_07]: They just don't.

976
01:08:17,144 --> 01:08:23,070
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is kind of risky for them, because if these kind of non-AAA titles don't sell well, then...

977
01:08:24,151 --> 01:08:24,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of sucks for them.

978
01:08:25,231 --> 01:08:29,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, maybe Zumba's not selling as well as it used to because I know they have Zumba.

979
01:08:29,914 --> 01:08:31,515
[SPEAKER_07]: That's their kind of big license right now.

980
01:08:34,077 --> 01:08:35,398
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know.

981
01:08:35,938 --> 01:08:37,099
[SPEAKER_07]: No Zumba for the Wii U, I guess.

982
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:38,680
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe that's what's hurting them.

983
01:08:38,982 --> 01:08:40,683
[SPEAKER_09]: So you talking about that made me look.

984
01:08:40,723 --> 01:08:43,163
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, how much is NBA Baller Beats right now?

985
01:08:43,183 --> 01:08:44,944
[SPEAKER_09]: $34 on Amazon.

986
01:08:45,024 --> 01:08:46,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Not going to fucking buy it.

987
01:08:46,525 --> 01:08:47,985
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the game with the basketball.

988
01:08:48,045 --> 01:08:52,787
[SPEAKER_07]: I am sitting here going... I bet I could pry that one from my boss.

989
01:08:52,807 --> 01:08:54,928
[SPEAKER_07]: He's still got it in the packaging at his work.

990
01:08:54,988 --> 01:08:56,548
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just sitting there because it's a basketball.

991
01:08:56,568 --> 01:08:57,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Bring it over.

992
01:08:57,188 --> 01:08:58,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do some live gameplay stream.

993
01:08:58,569 --> 01:09:01,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Who wants to watch League of Legends when you can watch NBA Baller Beats?

994
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:02,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.

995
01:09:03,731 --> 01:09:05,031
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get DarkSakura to play one.

996
01:09:05,051 --> 01:09:07,532
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll call it Two White Guys Play NBA Baller Beats.

997
01:09:08,211 --> 01:09:08,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll play.

998
01:09:08,992 --> 01:09:09,753
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

999
01:09:09,793 --> 01:09:11,296
[SPEAKER_07]: There are no ballers and no beats.

1000
01:09:12,417 --> 01:09:16,103
[SPEAKER_07]: White men can't baller or beats.

1001
01:09:16,403 --> 01:09:17,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Plenty of white guys can beat.

1002
01:09:18,411 --> 01:09:20,752
[SPEAKER_07]: All in Mississippi.

1003
01:09:20,892 --> 01:09:23,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Their stock closed down under $1.

1004
01:09:24,555 --> 01:09:25,995
[SPEAKER_07]: They're down to 75 cents.

1005
01:09:26,135 --> 01:09:30,398
[SPEAKER_07]: So hey, if you think they're going to make a comeback, maybe it's time to buy some Majesco stock.

1006
01:09:30,558 --> 01:09:31,638
[SPEAKER_07]: 75 cents, that's not bad.

1007
01:09:32,779 --> 01:09:41,004
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish it was much easier to just go online and buy some stock because I think it would be fun to just go buy 10 shares of Majesco just to say, hey, I own part of Majesco.

1008
01:09:41,904 --> 01:09:46,686
[SPEAKER_09]: And then at the next shareholder meeting, you know, we can hold whoever accountable came up with NBA Baller Beats.

1009
01:09:47,166 --> 01:09:48,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, actually, supposedly the game is fun.

1010
01:09:48,907 --> 01:09:49,647
[SPEAKER_09]: I should not get it.

1011
01:09:49,667 --> 01:09:50,428
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't really played it.

1012
01:09:50,648 --> 01:09:53,709
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to try Football 1 next.

1013
01:09:54,329 --> 01:09:56,830
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how that would even work.

1014
01:10:00,752 --> 01:10:07,455
[SPEAKER_05]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lodge Radio on VOGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, yogurt.

1015
01:10:08,396 --> 01:10:10,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, one more story here.

1016
01:10:10,477 --> 01:10:12,899
[SPEAKER_09]: This is about the next PlayStation controller.

1017
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:17,461
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we had some rumors about this already, but now there's more rumors.

1018
01:10:17,501 --> 01:10:17,922
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

1019
01:10:17,982 --> 01:10:20,723
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just using this to illustrate the whole story.

1020
01:10:21,043 --> 01:10:22,464
[SPEAKER_09]: It is not the boomerang, people.

1021
01:10:22,604 --> 01:10:23,225
[SPEAKER_09]: It is not the boomerang.

1022
01:10:23,245 --> 01:10:24,546
[SPEAKER_07]: It's coming back like a boomerang.

1023
01:10:24,766 --> 01:10:32,330
[SPEAKER_09]: But, well, remember when the boomerang thing was for the PlayStation 3 and everybody was like, no!

1024
01:10:33,051 --> 01:10:34,151
[SPEAKER_07]: That could have been comfortable.

1025
01:10:34,211 --> 01:10:34,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

1026
01:10:34,671 --> 01:10:34,852
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1027
01:10:34,872 --> 01:10:35,452
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually like,

1028
01:10:36,949 --> 01:10:38,650
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like such a history thing to say.

1029
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:39,530
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks so ridiculous.

1030
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:40,631
[SPEAKER_09]: The boomerang wasn't so bad, you know.

1031
01:10:41,091 --> 01:10:43,392
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks so ridiculous, but maybe it was comfortable.

1032
01:10:43,432 --> 01:10:44,272
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we don't know.

1033
01:10:44,392 --> 01:10:46,213
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't look like it would be very comfortable to me.

1034
01:10:46,393 --> 01:10:46,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, whatever.

1035
01:10:47,013 --> 01:10:47,433
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gone.

1036
01:10:47,694 --> 01:10:53,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so we've heard about this move thing that might actually be like a transformer into the controller, right?

1037
01:10:55,817 --> 01:10:58,099
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's not what the latest rumors are.

1038
01:10:58,179 --> 01:11:07,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, according to a senior game studio in a conversation with CVG, Sony is going to mix up the DualShock design.

1039
01:11:07,967 --> 01:11:12,750
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be biometric sensors on the grips and an LCD touchscreen.

1040
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:15,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, that's what everything's got to have now is a freaking touchscreen.

1041
01:11:16,994 --> 01:11:22,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, they are trying to emulate the same user interface philosophies as the PlayStation Vita.

1042
01:11:23,661 --> 01:11:26,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, I like the Vita and all, okay?

1043
01:11:26,487 --> 01:11:31,237
[SPEAKER_09]: The touchscreen's cool, the two analog sticks are cool, but the rear touchpad, let it go.

1044
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:33,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop trying to make rear touchpad happen.

1045
01:11:33,962 --> 01:11:34,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop.

1046
01:11:35,868 --> 01:11:40,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you understand that reaching around is like, you know, has some bad connotations to that?

1047
01:11:40,333 --> 01:11:45,579
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's just... Even in DJ Max, which I think... I know some people who really like reaching around.

1048
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:50,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Even in DJ Max, which I think does it better than most of the Vita games, like, I'm just like, turn it off.

1049
01:11:50,685 --> 01:11:51,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Turn it off.

1050
01:11:51,686 --> 01:11:52,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Turn it off.

1051
01:11:53,989 --> 01:11:54,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

1052
01:11:56,856 --> 01:12:08,601
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought for a second there, instead of leading up to, oh yeah, we're mimicking the control interface of the Vita, it was going to be, we're mimicking the control interface of the Wii U. Because that's basically...

1053
01:12:09,537 --> 01:12:10,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1054
01:12:28,892 --> 01:12:41,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, let's not say this would be a pretty awesome thing if they decide, hey, the next-gen console, it is going to be the Wii U. It's going to be the Vita that they throw into the box.

1055
01:12:41,419 --> 01:12:42,259
[SPEAKER_07]: It comes with a Vita.

1056
01:12:42,739 --> 01:12:44,920
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got a Vita, and you've got the PlayStation 4.

1057
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:45,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Boom!

1058
01:12:46,281 --> 01:12:46,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Right there.

1059
01:12:47,062 --> 01:12:52,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Portable, and you've got your console, and you can take your controller when you go.

1060
01:12:52,325 --> 01:13:01,932
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, because, don't get me wrong, I bet it would be pretty awesome if you could take that Wii U game tablet and stream games from a Wi-Fi spot somewhere else in the world.

1061
01:13:01,952 --> 01:13:05,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Which you can kind of already do with the PlayStation 3 and the PSP, for God's sake.

1062
01:13:05,814 --> 01:13:08,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so wouldn't it be kind of awesome if you could do that?

1063
01:13:08,396 --> 01:13:12,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if you could play virtual console games on there, you could take that.

1064
01:13:12,419 --> 01:13:13,900
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's a little bit big, but come on.

1065
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:14,940
[SPEAKER_09]: PS1 classics?

1066
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,041
[SPEAKER_09]: And PS2 classics?

1067
01:13:16,641 --> 01:13:21,503
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about the Wii U. I'm just saying, wouldn't it be awesome if you could do that with the Wii U controller?

1068
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:27,046
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty big, but people carry tablets around, so why not?

1069
01:13:27,106 --> 01:13:33,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Regardless of whether this current rumor is fact or crap or whatever, how do you feel about them redesigning the DualShock?

1070
01:13:34,957 --> 01:13:59,331
[SPEAKER_09]: for all practical purposes at the point we're at now throwing out the six axis and everything you know the PlayStation 3 controller you get now is a very tiny evolution from the original PlayStation controller I mean really I mean granted okay I guess the analog sticks came a little later the very very first PlayStation controllers didn't have them but still the core of that controller has not changed that much since the beginning

1071
01:13:59,591 --> 01:14:00,252
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1072
01:14:12,819 --> 01:14:13,719
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's going to be a gimmick.

1073
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:16,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Biometric sensors are on there.

1074
01:14:17,581 --> 01:14:18,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is a gimmick.

1075
01:14:18,682 --> 01:14:22,964
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a gimmick that also a lot of cell phone games and a lot of stuff uses.

1076
01:14:23,424 --> 01:14:25,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no one really uses 6Xs anymore.

1077
01:14:25,525 --> 01:14:35,490
[SPEAKER_07]: But even like... It seems like a lot of the stuff that Sony's been doing lately has just been to kind of mimic... Because even with the Wii, everybody got into motion gaming right after the Wii.

1078
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:39,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, we've been working on the Move controller since a long time ago.

1079
01:14:39,552 --> 01:14:39,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1080
01:14:40,672 --> 01:15:05,298
[SPEAKER_07]: come on it just it never took off and now you know some of these patents that we see look really ridiculous i mean no one's gonna fucking strap move controllers to your feet and do like a flip kick in your goddamn living room no one's gonna do that um so they need to come up with a new they need to come up with something new then you come out with the wow factor because if you're fucking emulating someone else or doing the same shit you're doing now no one's gonna care no one's gonna be like why do i have to buy this i can already fucking do that now

1081
01:15:05,795 --> 01:15:08,677
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really what it comes down to is the wow factor.

1082
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:10,037
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's going to sell your console.

1083
01:15:10,558 --> 01:15:10,838
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1084
01:15:11,418 --> 01:15:14,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's travel back in time to a time when, you know what?

1085
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:17,481
[SPEAKER_09]: The controller, it was a stick and a button, and you liked it.

1086
01:15:17,561 --> 01:15:18,022
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

1087
01:15:18,282 --> 01:15:19,222
[SPEAKER_09]: One stick, one button.

1088
01:15:19,502 --> 01:15:20,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, we have more buttons for this one.

1089
01:15:20,863 --> 01:15:21,183
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1090
01:15:21,243 --> 01:15:23,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe this game isn't quite that old.

1091
01:15:24,045 --> 01:15:30,848
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's still a classic, so let's dive into the gaming vault where DarkSakura is going to pick out an oldie moldie video game and say, Hey...

1092
01:15:31,969 --> 01:15:33,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Play it, because it's cool.

1093
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:35,070
[SPEAKER_09]: You probably forgot about it.

1094
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:37,731
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a cool one, and probably not many people have seen it.

1095
01:15:38,932 --> 01:15:43,954
[SPEAKER_05]: The classic game in Japan was called Zexex.

1096
01:15:44,134 --> 01:15:46,495
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm pronouncing it right, because it's X-E-X-E-X.

1097
01:15:47,575 --> 01:15:48,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Over here we had it as Oreus.

1098
01:15:49,676 --> 01:15:55,357
[SPEAKER_05]: It came out in 1991, a side-scrolling shooting game, and it was actually really unique for its time.

1099
01:15:56,497 --> 01:16:00,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami was really influenced by a lot of stuff that Irem put out.

1100
01:16:00,938 --> 01:16:09,260
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually has influences from R-Type, which everyone knows R-Type is among one of my favorite games, and the tentacle mechanics that came from X-Multiply.

1101
01:16:10,669 --> 01:16:21,359
[SPEAKER_05]: It did not at all get a home release until it came out with Salamander Portable that came out on the PSP, which somebody in this room enabled me to get that game for my husband.

1102
01:16:21,399 --> 01:16:22,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Loki.

1103
01:16:24,903 --> 01:16:27,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it's really, really an amazing shooter.

1104
01:16:28,686 --> 01:16:34,011
[SPEAKER_05]: It had some really interesting mechanics.

1105
01:16:36,073 --> 01:16:39,975
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened with this one, like I said, it's similar to R-Type and X-Multiply.

1106
01:16:40,015 --> 01:16:44,417
[SPEAKER_05]: You play a ship called the Flintlock that has this detachable orb called a Flint.

1107
01:16:45,258 --> 01:16:47,639
[SPEAKER_05]: And it acts sort of like R-Type's force.

1108
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:57,324
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can get power-ups to boost Flint's power, your movement, you're changing your weapon, increase your life count.

1109
01:16:58,125 --> 01:17:02,267
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are a bunch of changes that came out, though, in the non-Japanese versions.

1110
01:17:02,807 --> 01:17:03,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them being...

1111
01:17:04,028 --> 01:17:07,950
[SPEAKER_05]: They removed all but one of the upgradeable weapons and they changed the enemy patterns.

1112
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:14,833
[SPEAKER_05]: For different weapons, in the US, there was only the proton laser.

1113
01:17:16,493 --> 01:17:29,839
[SPEAKER_05]: In the Japanese version, you start with a proton laser and then you get a homing laser, a shadow laser, a round laser, a spiral laser, which is a lot like the Gradius Ripple, a search laser that's kind of like a homing laser, and a ground laser.

1114
01:17:30,939 --> 01:17:36,943
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very similar to the fire one that would travel across the floor from R-Type.

1115
01:17:38,264 --> 01:17:46,750
[SPEAKER_05]: And so basically the story of the game, you have to save the princess named Irene from the planet East Square from an evil dude named Klaus.

1116
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:50,412
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's different cutscenes and she's crying for help and she's tortured.

1117
01:17:51,213 --> 01:17:55,976
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you have to basically go through the game.

1118
01:17:56,096 --> 01:17:58,958
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's naked people in the ending of the game, just saying.

1119
01:18:00,739 --> 01:18:01,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen up, acidic vampire.

1120
01:18:03,662 --> 01:18:12,789
[SPEAKER_05]: But the big thing about Zexix that I thought was really amazing, and Rob, you can see this right in front of you, is the level design.

1121
01:18:13,409 --> 01:18:17,673
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, for 1991, the backgrounds look like shit right out of Tron.

1122
01:18:17,833 --> 01:18:18,794
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously.

1123
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:24,918
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got very... Well, I like the little tentacle shots the thing does.

1124
01:18:24,938 --> 01:18:25,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1125
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, it shoots out all these little tentacles.

1126
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:29,202
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually had never really heard of this game, so...

1127
01:18:29,662 --> 01:18:34,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Zexix is a really... I definitely see the Gradius inspiredness in it.

1128
01:18:35,067 --> 01:18:40,752
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot of the use of the flint is definitely like using the force in R-Type.

1129
01:18:42,753 --> 01:18:45,235
[SPEAKER_05]: The game is actually pretty challenging.

1130
01:18:45,756 --> 01:18:47,117
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really difficult game.

1131
01:18:47,477 --> 01:18:53,242
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thankfully got to play a copy a while back off of the Supergun.

1132
01:18:54,783 --> 01:18:57,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so, this was ages ago.

1133
01:18:57,945 --> 01:19:03,688
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is actually a game that I don't know if it's, um, if they've gotten it to work on MAME yet.

1134
01:19:03,828 --> 01:19:09,471
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to check because Zexex is like, it's seriously one of the classics when it comes to shooters.

1135
01:19:09,532 --> 01:19:11,713
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a bullet hell, definitely, by any means.

1136
01:19:12,433 --> 01:19:19,836
[SPEAKER_05]: But it requires a lot of steady movement, a lot of really good reflex to make your way through it.

1137
01:19:20,316 --> 01:19:22,037
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just an amazing game.

1138
01:19:22,537 --> 01:19:31,321
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would say, unfortunately, the only way to get a hold of it for any type of home version is getting the PSP version.

1139
01:19:31,561 --> 01:19:35,463
[SPEAKER_05]: It's again under the Salamander Portable.

1140
01:19:36,503 --> 01:19:56,068
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's also you can find this really inexpensive for PSP it didn't cost a lot I think when I bought it new it was like 30 bucks and that's you know an import and of course there's no region lockout on the PSP so the chatters are saying it is in Maine if you want to if you want to turn to the dark side of the internet where everybody's at

1141
01:19:56,877 --> 01:19:59,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I haven't touched anything on name and ages.

1142
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:01,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan and I are probably going to be making a new cab soon.

1143
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:10,925
[SPEAKER_05]: But seriously, if anyone loves shooting games, and especially if you're a fan of Konami shooters and love Irem shooters, you really owe it to yourself to play this one.

1144
01:20:10,945 --> 01:20:12,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Zexix is a great game.

1145
01:20:14,188 --> 01:20:43,122
[SPEAKER_09]: and that's it alright there it is your classic game of the week over here it was called Oreus if you happen to find an arcade cab of it take a picture of it for me please alright we are going to come back after a quick break here with more of Orange Lounge Radio including a game we've talked about a bit here on Orange Lounge Radio finally official this week we're going to talk about Disney Infinity when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this

1146
01:20:49,474 --> 01:20:59,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live with the 490th episode of our program for this January the 20th of 2013.

1147
01:20:59,381 --> 01:21:04,345
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope those of you guys that have an extended weekend here in the States make the most of it.

1148
01:21:05,105 --> 01:21:11,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Let us not forget, though, the memory of Martin Luther King Jr., the reason why we have the weekend.

1149
01:21:11,631 --> 01:21:17,537
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I was going to play the I Have a Dream speech during the break tonight, but it's like 18 minutes, which is a little bit long for a break.

1150
01:21:17,897 --> 01:21:25,283
[SPEAKER_09]: But I encourage you all, just as a little reminder of what we've been through, take a listen to it.

1151
01:21:26,645 --> 01:21:36,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I wanted to talk, getting back to games a little bit, I promised at the start of Part B, because I forgot to talk about this during my gaming week, I want to talk about Wake Up Club on the PlayStation Vita.

1152
01:21:36,614 --> 01:21:44,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you guys heard about this game, and I use that term very loosely, have you guys heard that game at all, or played that game, heard about it?

1153
01:21:44,902 --> 01:21:45,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody?

1154
01:21:45,243 --> 01:21:45,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody?

1155
01:21:45,663 --> 01:21:45,843
[SPEAKER_09]: No?

1156
01:21:46,303 --> 01:21:47,404
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1157
01:21:47,424 --> 01:21:48,384
[SPEAKER_09]: I downloaded it today.

1158
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:49,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you checked it out at all?

1159
01:21:49,585 --> 01:21:49,785
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1160
01:21:50,065 --> 01:22:05,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, it's this app for the PlayStation Vita, and it basically, you know, you can choose from these different skins that are alarm clocks or whatever, like a motor storm background or a journey background or whatever, and you can do the little alarm clock.

1161
01:22:05,613 --> 01:22:10,435
[SPEAKER_09]: But what you do is that when you're on the clock, you tell it what time you want to get up or whatever, you put it to sleep.

1162
01:22:10,835 --> 01:22:12,216
[SPEAKER_09]: And then what happens is in the morning,

1163
01:22:13,036 --> 01:22:14,598
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1164
01:22:37,017 --> 01:22:37,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Wake up!

1165
01:22:37,258 --> 01:22:37,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Wake up!

1166
01:22:37,518 --> 01:22:37,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Wake up!

1167
01:22:54,175 --> 01:23:01,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Taunt it all you want, but the gamification of an alarm clock is a pretty neat idea, I've got to say.

1168
01:23:02,185 --> 01:23:11,897
[SPEAKER_09]: And why especially this is interesting on the Vita is that if you think about it, this gives people a reason to remember they have a Vita.

1169
01:23:13,138 --> 01:23:13,598
[SPEAKER_09]: For real.

1170
01:23:13,678 --> 01:23:18,300
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there hasn't been a whole lot on the PlayStation Vita that people have gotten that excited about.

1171
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:22,701
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not saying that Wake Up Club is the Vita system saver.

1172
01:23:22,881 --> 01:23:25,922
[SPEAKER_09]: No, nobody's going to buy a Vita just for silly Wake Up Club.

1173
01:23:26,622 --> 01:23:35,245
[SPEAKER_09]: But something that gets the PlayStation Vita into your daily routine is a really smart move on Sony's part.

1174
01:23:35,765 --> 01:23:37,826
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I'm giving them too much credit, but...

1175
01:23:38,687 --> 01:23:41,132
[SPEAKER_09]: if they really thought that's what they were going to try to do.

1176
01:23:41,573 --> 01:23:44,660
[SPEAKER_09]: But if that was what they were going for, well played.

1177
01:23:45,943 --> 01:23:46,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Thoughts?

1178
01:23:48,012 --> 01:24:02,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see how it would be interesting and definitely it's a way to keep the Vita in the... Like you said, putting it in someone's daily routine will keep it constantly in their... For example, I know it's not exactly the same, but having my iPhone, it's my alarm clock.

1179
01:24:03,143 --> 01:24:06,326
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep in touch with my family through it, texting all the time.

1180
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:07,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I even use it at work now.

1181
01:24:07,547 --> 01:24:08,187
[SPEAKER_05]: It's text write-off.

1182
01:24:08,687 --> 01:24:08,968
But...

1183
01:24:09,568 --> 01:24:10,369
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1184
01:24:32,262 --> 01:24:33,643
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1185
01:24:58,030 --> 01:24:58,970
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1186
01:25:17,097 --> 01:25:17,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god.

1187
01:25:17,858 --> 01:25:26,044
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I saw pictures on Tumblr of people like laying half in their bed with their face on the alarm clock to register the pressure and they're still asleep.

1188
01:25:26,184 --> 01:25:26,965
[SPEAKER_05]: See, that would be me.

1189
01:25:27,065 --> 01:25:28,126
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd learn how to do it in my sleep.

1190
01:25:28,546 --> 01:25:30,167
[SPEAKER_05]: I turn off my iPhone all the time in my sleep.

1191
01:25:30,307 --> 01:25:33,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I need the Vita to give me an electric shock to really wake me up.

1192
01:25:34,590 --> 01:25:34,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob.

1193
01:25:35,211 --> 01:25:35,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God.

1194
01:25:35,952 --> 01:25:38,234
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, not the sounds of my mother waking me up.

1195
01:25:38,354 --> 01:25:38,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob.

1196
01:25:39,114 --> 01:25:40,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, you're going to be late for work.

1197
01:25:40,496 --> 01:25:40,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob.

1198
01:25:41,196 --> 01:25:41,697
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

1199
01:25:41,757 --> 01:25:42,397
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what you need.

1200
01:25:42,417 --> 01:25:45,000
[SPEAKER_09]: If you get fired from your job, Rob, you're going to be homeless.

1201
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:46,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, you are not moving in here, Rob.

1202
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:48,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, get up.

1203
01:25:49,123 --> 01:25:50,044
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1204
01:25:50,524 --> 01:25:54,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, this is a copyright Orange Jones Radio and me and Rob.

1205
01:25:55,349 --> 01:25:58,071
[SPEAKER_05]: This is your mom, the alarm clock.

1206
01:25:59,052 --> 01:26:00,233
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we need to invent, Rob.

1207
01:26:00,333 --> 01:26:01,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Your mom, the alarm clock.

1208
01:26:03,069 --> 01:26:04,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, get out of bed!

1209
01:26:04,629 --> 01:26:06,590
[SPEAKER_05]: The neighbors are going to call the police.

1210
01:26:06,610 --> 01:26:07,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry Rob's neighbors.

1211
01:26:30,272 --> 01:26:30,593
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1212
01:26:31,533 --> 01:26:31,954
[SPEAKER_09]: That was my mom.

1213
01:26:31,974 --> 01:26:32,775
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Wake Up Club.

1214
01:26:32,915 --> 01:26:34,096
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to throw that out there.

1215
01:26:34,276 --> 01:26:36,578
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a thing that happened this week I forgot to talk about.

1216
01:26:36,758 --> 01:26:38,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's a game, but it's not.

1217
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:44,825
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, again, Enrageinator and our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, yeah, Rob, way too much credit.

1218
01:26:45,717 --> 01:26:49,140
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder what it'd be like if I put this in it.

1219
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:49,800
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't bake.

1220
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:50,601
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1221
01:27:14,096 --> 01:27:15,917
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's go to some rapid-fire news.

1222
01:27:15,937 --> 01:27:18,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk about some other video game news happening around the industry right now.

1223
01:27:18,878 --> 01:27:19,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry for Rob's neighbors.

1224
01:27:20,899 --> 01:27:21,239
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all right.

1225
01:27:21,399 --> 01:27:21,779
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll deal.

1226
01:27:21,899 --> 01:27:22,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki?

1227
01:27:22,679 --> 01:27:22,999
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1228
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:28,982
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's talk a little bit about the survey that they sent out for Call of Duty.

1229
01:27:29,542 --> 01:27:37,165
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of hinting at some stuff that may be available for the next iteration of it.

1230
01:27:37,885 --> 01:27:39,566
[SPEAKER_07]: And it includes stuff saying...

1231
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:42,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, what kind of special things do you want at retail?

1232
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:08,391
[SPEAKER_07]: There's collectible sets featuring character vehicles and scenery from the game, similar to the Halo Mega Bloks stuff.

1233
01:28:08,932 --> 01:28:10,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Custom-branded audio soundbar.

1234
01:28:11,253 --> 01:28:11,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Lame.

1235
01:28:12,053 --> 01:28:14,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Custom-branded gaming headset.

1236
01:28:14,435 --> 01:28:14,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Also lame.

1237
01:28:15,275 --> 01:28:17,556
[SPEAKER_07]: And custom-branded wireless router.

1238
01:28:18,937 --> 01:28:20,338
[SPEAKER_07]: No, just don't.

1239
01:28:21,219 --> 01:28:22,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Operational Desktop Sentry Gun.

1240
01:28:23,501 --> 01:28:25,163
[SPEAKER_07]: There's your winning pick right there.

1241
01:28:26,464 --> 01:28:28,085
[SPEAKER_07]: And they had some other pictures from it.

1242
01:28:28,125 --> 01:28:29,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, they took them down because of NDA.

1243
01:28:30,587 --> 01:28:37,193
[SPEAKER_07]: They're saying also that there might be a digital version to pre-download to your console, and then it'll be available to play at 12.01 a.m.

1244
01:28:37,213 --> 01:28:37,734
[SPEAKER_07]: on launch day.

1245
01:28:39,615 --> 01:28:48,660
[SPEAKER_07]: which is kind of cool if they did that and it says maybe that'll be something that'll be featured in next-gen consoles being able to kind of pre-download stuff like you can on Steam

1246
01:28:48,953 --> 01:28:51,934
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, like Steam or World of Warcraft did that with the expansions.

1247
01:28:52,214 --> 01:28:53,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I don't know why they can't do that.

1248
01:28:54,014 --> 01:28:58,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they've got day one patches, you know, and stuff.

1249
01:28:59,035 --> 01:29:00,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let me put it this way.

1250
01:29:00,075 --> 01:29:03,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Day one patches might not be a good way to go because, let's say, for example, you do that.

1251
01:29:05,596 --> 01:29:10,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if they did it with the console version and you weren't able to connect online, you would never be able to play your game.

1252
01:29:10,937 --> 01:29:13,378
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's just say that they were able to lock that out to just...

1253
01:29:15,659 --> 01:29:16,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

1254
01:29:16,119 --> 01:29:23,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not have it built in where you can download the game and then piracy is gone as far as print late before release.

1255
01:29:23,664 --> 01:29:25,204
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1256
01:29:25,445 --> 01:29:26,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like a good idea.

1257
01:29:28,566 --> 01:29:31,128
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's some pretty good news here.

1258
01:29:31,948 --> 01:29:32,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Skyrim.

1259
01:29:33,509 --> 01:29:39,153
[SPEAKER_07]: All the wonderful DLC that you've been missing on the PS3.

1260
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:40,874
[SPEAKER_07]: It's finally coming.

1261
01:29:41,754 --> 01:29:44,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Dragonborn, the latest expansion for the game.

1262
01:29:44,936 --> 01:29:46,877
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be hitting PC on February 5th.

1263
01:29:48,177 --> 01:29:55,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Also in February, all the other expansions are going to be coming out as well on PS3.

1264
01:29:55,141 --> 01:29:59,123
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe they're even offering them at half cost for the first week.

1265
01:29:59,143 --> 01:30:00,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry it's late.

1266
01:30:00,764 --> 01:30:01,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1267
01:30:02,424 --> 01:30:03,266
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not bad.

1268
01:30:03,386 --> 01:30:06,231
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought them all half off on PC.

1269
01:30:07,834 --> 01:30:11,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Building the house in Hearthfire is kind of cool, I guess.

1270
01:30:12,202 --> 01:30:12,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1271
01:30:12,663 --> 01:30:14,006
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like the Orphan Kid scene.

1272
01:30:15,044 --> 01:30:16,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you can adopt me!

1273
01:30:16,965 --> 01:30:19,025
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not gonna adopt you.

1274
01:30:19,245 --> 01:30:22,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if it goes anything like Fable was, I never came home.

1275
01:30:22,206 --> 01:30:24,227
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can't kill the kids, because that's wrong.

1276
01:30:25,548 --> 01:30:27,028
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can't even do that in Skyrim.

1277
01:30:27,428 --> 01:30:29,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I'm sure somebody hacked it in.

1278
01:30:30,049 --> 01:30:32,110
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure some sicko hacked it in.

1279
01:30:32,150 --> 01:30:33,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course you can do it on the PC.

1280
01:30:34,330 --> 01:30:36,591
[SPEAKER_09]: You see what PC gaming supports, DarkSakura?

1281
01:30:37,792 --> 01:30:39,052
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't paying attention, sorry.

1282
01:30:39,414 --> 01:30:40,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Killing children.

1283
01:30:41,296 --> 01:30:44,059
[SPEAKER_07]: And for some reason when I loot all of the women all their clothes come off.

1284
01:30:44,099 --> 01:30:45,982
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really know why that happens.

1285
01:30:46,002 --> 01:30:47,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Sickos on the PC.

1286
01:30:47,323 --> 01:30:47,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1287
01:30:47,864 --> 01:30:48,525
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so weird.

1288
01:30:49,065 --> 01:30:51,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Also have a torture chamber with slave maidens.

1289
01:30:52,569 --> 01:30:56,173
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got the PC sicko story to top all of this coming up but hold on.

1290
01:30:56,974 --> 01:30:58,176
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I need to get Skyrim now.

1291
01:30:59,637 --> 01:31:07,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Last but not least, La Milana and Leisure Suit Larry are some of the titles that are included on the next Steam Greenlight.

1292
01:31:08,365 --> 01:31:09,126
[SPEAKER_07]: This is pretty cool.

1293
01:31:09,166 --> 01:31:16,473
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got DLC Quest, which honestly wasn't a very long game, but cool.

1294
01:31:17,214 --> 01:31:22,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Eidor, Masters of the Broken World, Mac, The Age of Decadence,

1295
01:31:23,039 --> 01:31:29,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Yunpik, and War for the Overworld are some of the other titles that are going to be coming out.

1296
01:31:29,961 --> 01:31:32,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

1297
01:31:33,302 --> 01:31:37,404
[SPEAKER_07]: And Akaneiro Demon Hunters, which I think... Isn't that that...

1298
01:31:39,944 --> 01:31:43,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, isn't that the new game that they're working on?

1299
01:31:44,629 --> 01:31:45,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it American McGee or something?

1300
01:31:46,570 --> 01:31:49,673
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's that American McGee game, if I remember correctly.

1301
01:31:50,174 --> 01:31:55,478
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also a Groboto modeling app, which is actually software.

1302
01:31:55,559 --> 01:32:01,944
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the Articity Draft game design tool is another non-gaming thing that got greenlit.

1303
01:32:02,785 --> 01:32:10,012
[SPEAKER_09]: So, just so you know, La Mulana, that was a game that, you know, Dark Tetsuya used to write about a lot on OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

1304
01:32:10,052 --> 01:32:11,073
[SPEAKER_09]: He was very excited about it.

1305
01:32:11,414 --> 01:32:16,919
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually went to Dark Tetsuya and I said, could I get a quote, sir, about how you feel about La Mulana getting the Project Greenlight?

1306
01:32:16,939 --> 01:32:17,860
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is what he had to say.

1307
01:32:23,171 --> 01:32:24,933
[SPEAKER_09]: That was an actual Kermit flail, by the way.

1308
01:32:24,953 --> 01:32:26,975
[SPEAKER_09]: That was an actual, real deal Kermit flail.

1309
01:32:27,535 --> 01:32:27,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Just so you know.

1310
01:32:29,397 --> 01:32:31,540
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if anybody was Kermit flailing over this.

1311
01:32:31,620 --> 01:32:32,861
[SPEAKER_09]: More like, da fuck?

1312
01:32:33,962 --> 01:32:37,646
[SPEAKER_09]: But people are modding Alan Wake on the PC.

1313
01:32:37,786 --> 01:32:39,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, that's what people do to PC games.

1314
01:32:39,828 --> 01:32:40,329
[SPEAKER_09]: They mod them.

1315
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:42,210
[SPEAKER_09]: But what...

1316
01:32:44,152 --> 01:33:03,112
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess apparently it wasn't supposed to be moddable, it was supposed to have permissions, licenses, whatever, that ain't gonna, hackers gonna hack, hackers gonna hack, and you gotta love this, they did all 2.9 gigs, unraveled it, put it back together, and what was the community tool that they put out, what did they put out in response to you'll never hack Alan Wake?

1317
01:33:03,752 --> 01:33:13,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody put a Hello Kitty flashlight into Alan Wake where the little flashlight will actually always be the little Hello Kitty image when it shines on the wall.

1318
01:33:14,614 --> 01:33:15,695
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see the little boat.

1319
01:33:15,735 --> 01:33:18,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me see if in the video you get a better shot of it.

1320
01:33:18,495 --> 01:33:19,195
[SPEAKER_01]: I can kind of see it.

1321
01:33:19,215 --> 01:33:20,115
[SPEAKER_09]: You can kind of see it there?

1322
01:33:20,195 --> 01:33:20,396
[SPEAKER_09]: See?

1323
01:33:20,716 --> 01:33:20,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1324
01:33:20,996 --> 01:33:22,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello Kitty flashlight.

1325
01:33:22,996 --> 01:33:23,496
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.

1326
01:33:23,516 --> 01:33:28,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's what my Alan Wake needs and I can kill the bad guys, the little shadows, with Hello Kitty.

1327
01:33:29,998 --> 01:33:30,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Kill them with cuteness.

1328
01:33:31,818 --> 01:33:32,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't.

1329
01:33:33,467 --> 01:33:36,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this... I don't even know what the hell to say about this.

1330
01:33:37,390 --> 01:33:41,232
[SPEAKER_09]: This community could have used a little bit of cuteness, because this was just stupid.

1331
01:33:41,532 --> 01:33:44,374
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, this is one of the stupidest things I've ever seen in gaming, like, ever.

1332
01:33:47,316 --> 01:33:50,799
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, did you see this fuckery?

1333
01:33:51,739 --> 01:33:59,305
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the pre-order bonus for the European Australian Dead Island Riptide Zombie Bait Edition.

1334
01:33:59,345 --> 01:33:59,505
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1335
01:33:59,625 --> 01:34:00,606
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a collector's edition.

1336
01:34:00,686 --> 01:34:00,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, whatever.

1337
01:34:01,006 --> 01:34:01,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a pre-order bonus.

1338
01:34:01,847 --> 01:34:02,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

1339
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:03,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Severed limbs for everybody.

1340
01:34:03,929 --> 01:34:04,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Collector's edition.

1341
01:34:04,989 --> 01:34:20,882
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a severed torso of an apparently British female, and I'm only guessing that because she's got the little Union Jack bra thing going for her, but she is all bloodified, decapitated, armless, and limbless.

1342
01:34:21,562 --> 01:34:22,403
[SPEAKER_09]: It is gross.

1343
01:34:22,983 --> 01:34:24,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Who would want this in their house?

1344
01:34:25,465 --> 01:34:40,154
[SPEAKER_09]: And especially kind of fucking tacky to announce this type of thing the day that Joe Biden is sitting down with the video game industry to talk about, you know, is there a correlation between blah, blah, blah.

1345
01:34:40,495 --> 01:34:45,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, before y'all correct me, I am aware it was the Europe and Australian pre-order bonus.

1346
01:34:46,339 --> 01:34:49,201
[SPEAKER_09]: So they were the ones to announce it, not the U.S.

1347
01:34:50,121 --> 01:34:50,762
[SPEAKER_09]: arm of the company.

1348
01:34:51,882 --> 01:35:08,918
[SPEAKER_09]: However, somebody finally figured, you know, maybe this is kind of tacky Maybe we don't really need this Maybe this is just in bad taste And so they came out and said, we sincerely regret this choice And we're committed to making sure this will never happen again

1349
01:35:09,438 --> 01:35:13,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, what happens to the people that already pre-ordered it?

1350
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,861
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if they even say it won't happen again.

1351
01:35:15,881 --> 01:35:17,702
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't say we're going to pull this.

1352
01:35:17,862 --> 01:35:18,962
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not going to sell this.

1353
01:35:19,002 --> 01:35:20,163
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't mention that at all.

1354
01:35:20,183 --> 01:35:22,344
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just saying we won't do this again.

1355
01:35:26,646 --> 01:35:28,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing said that they're going to stop doing it now.

1356
01:35:29,007 --> 01:35:31,168
[SPEAKER_07]: They just said, oh, well, we're not going to do it again.

1357
01:35:32,604 --> 01:36:01,427
[SPEAKER_09]: AlanAlchemy in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says it's super sexed up and gross it's for neckbeards to fap too see that's the sick thing like this is sick already but then you have to realize because it is an inanimate object somebody will stick their dick in it and that makes it like 10 times like a million times worse as if this could even get worse you realize somebody's gonna put their dick in it and it's just like this is too much that was a joke already made that just saying

1358
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:06,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, but it doesn't end there.

1359
01:36:08,625 --> 01:36:12,471
[SPEAKER_09]: A new game was made this week by the Encyclopedia Dramatica forums.

1360
01:36:12,631 --> 01:36:12,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, go figure.

1361
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:18,001
[SPEAKER_09]: called Bullet to the Head of the NRA.

1362
01:36:18,101 --> 01:36:19,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that is the name of the game.

1363
01:36:20,022 --> 01:36:21,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Bullet to the Head of the NRA.

1364
01:36:22,223 --> 01:36:29,566
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a first-person shooter, if you want to call it that, that lets you just shoot NRA boss Wayne LaPierre.

1365
01:36:31,827 --> 01:36:35,949
[SPEAKER_09]: The intent of this game was to do nothing but to just piss people off.

1366
01:36:37,655 --> 01:36:38,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Ding, ding, ding.

1367
01:36:38,195 --> 01:36:41,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Imagine Encyclopedia Dramatica releasing something that would just piss people off.

1368
01:36:42,257 --> 01:36:47,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Quote, share this everywhere, especially gun nut and anti-game websites.

1369
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:52,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, see if you can't send it to the NRA somehow, like through the feedback on their website or something.

1370
01:36:52,702 --> 01:37:00,065
[SPEAKER_09]: This is from forum user Gizmo01942 who also is developing a game based on the Sandy Hook shooting.

1371
01:37:00,945 --> 01:37:04,247
[SPEAKER_09]: You will actually get to go to the Connecticut school and shoot kids because...

1372
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:08,573
[SPEAKER_09]: There's always gonna be that guy on the internet.

1373
01:37:10,751 --> 01:37:14,153
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, you look like you're about to just... I hate people.

1374
01:37:14,333 --> 01:37:15,834
[SPEAKER_09]: You're doing the SMH thing over there.

1375
01:37:16,975 --> 01:37:17,375
[SPEAKER_09]: SMH?

1376
01:37:17,896 --> 01:37:18,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Shake my head.

1377
01:37:19,116 --> 01:37:20,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Or SMGDH.

1378
01:37:20,577 --> 01:37:21,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Shake my goddamn head.

1379
01:37:21,718 --> 01:37:22,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't get people.

1380
01:37:23,239 --> 01:37:24,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't, so it's fine.

1381
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:27,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here we are talking about it, so maybe the troll won.

1382
01:37:27,281 --> 01:37:27,722
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1383
01:37:28,082 --> 01:37:28,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, fuck them.

1384
01:37:28,782 --> 01:37:29,783
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an attention grab.

1385
01:37:29,903 --> 01:37:30,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing more.

1386
01:37:31,084 --> 01:37:35,086
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know somebody's going to get this and be all... You know who's attention is going to grab?

1387
01:37:35,226 --> 01:37:35,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Fox News.

1388
01:37:36,314 --> 01:37:41,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I like to file this stuff under the banner of no one care.

1389
01:37:42,899 --> 01:37:44,020
[SPEAKER_09]: No one important.

1390
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:54,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, somebody did point out, this came out one day after the NRA had put out their own gun game, NRA Practice Range, which is available on the iOS.

1391
01:37:55,368 --> 01:37:57,410
[SPEAKER_09]: It is rated for ages 4 and up.

1392
01:37:58,795 --> 01:37:59,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, that's all Target.

1393
01:37:59,956 --> 01:38:00,836
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Target practice.

1394
01:38:01,456 --> 01:38:02,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Target practice, so it's okay.

1395
01:38:03,398 --> 01:38:04,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's a question.

1396
01:38:04,378 --> 01:38:08,260
[SPEAKER_09]: I know this is rapid-fire news, and I'm not going very rapidly, but there's a lot to say about this stuff.

1397
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:10,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you let a four-year-old play point-blank?

1398
01:38:14,283 --> 01:38:17,925
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a gun game, but it's carnival guns.

1399
01:38:18,426 --> 01:38:26,350
[SPEAKER_05]: This is where my stance is with this, is that if I were a parent, I wouldn't let a child watch TV until they were older than five.

1400
01:38:27,858 --> 01:38:30,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck with that.

1401
01:38:30,819 --> 01:38:31,580
[SPEAKER_07]: That was our plan.

1402
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:32,380
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't happen.

1403
01:38:32,460 --> 01:38:34,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I know plenty of parents who have been very successful with it.

1404
01:38:36,101 --> 01:38:47,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I come for that just because I've seen the difference in behavior with Becky's son when he's allowed to play games and watch TV versus when he's limited access to playing games and watching TV.

1405
01:38:47,345 --> 01:38:51,566
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a lot happier of a kid when he gets to go outside and play more often.

1406
01:38:52,186 --> 01:39:03,191
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't think I would allow, if I were a parent, I wouldn't allow TV or video games until they were old enough to actually have more of a comprehension factor attached to it.

1407
01:39:03,931 --> 01:39:04,411
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just me.

1408
01:39:05,712 --> 01:39:07,092
[SPEAKER_05]: And I certainly wouldn't let it be a babysitter.

1409
01:39:09,198 --> 01:39:10,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on to some more rapid fire news.

1410
01:39:10,839 --> 01:39:12,599
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.

1411
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:16,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know how people were a little excited about Epic Mickey 2?

1412
01:39:16,981 --> 01:39:26,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they were only a little excited because they only sold 270,000 copies in North America, which is about, oh, a million less than the first one did.

1413
01:39:26,785 --> 01:39:28,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the first one sold 1.3 million.

1414
01:39:29,106 --> 01:39:30,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, not even close.

1415
01:39:30,646 --> 01:39:31,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1416
01:39:31,727 --> 01:39:35,748
[SPEAKER_05]: And the creator thinks they're going to do more, so that would be great when Disney shuts them down.

1417
01:39:37,049 --> 01:39:37,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

1418
01:39:38,709 --> 01:39:44,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Now there's also six weeks of free PS Mobile games.

1419
01:39:44,671 --> 01:39:47,132
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be starting with Samurai Beatdown.

1420
01:39:48,312 --> 01:39:55,155
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get that on the PlayStation Store, and it's either for Vita or PlayStation certified mobile devices.

1421
01:39:56,155 --> 01:40:02,017
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's only going to be available in Japan, US, UK, Canada, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Australia.

1422
01:40:02,437 --> 01:40:04,178
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you live in Zimbabwe, you're fucked.

1423
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:31,207
[SPEAKER_05]: and then for fans of Shin Megami Tensei Devil Summoner Soul Hackers is going to be out in the US in April it's been set to release on 16th of April and nothing about our friends in the UK if they're going to see anything but who knows it's also a 3DS remake of the one that came out in the Sega Saturn in 1997 done

1424
01:40:35,359 --> 01:40:38,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, how about we go to the Fugle question of the week?

1425
01:40:39,021 --> 01:40:39,601
[SPEAKER_05]: How about we?

1426
01:40:39,941 --> 01:40:40,481
[SPEAKER_09]: How about it?

1427
01:40:40,601 --> 01:40:41,302
[SPEAKER_05]: How about it, huh?

1428
01:40:49,645 --> 01:40:58,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio Google Plus at Orange Lounge Radio Put them together, you get Fugle Here's our Fugle question of the week

1429
01:40:59,113 --> 01:41:01,215
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't talk about this story tonight but I guess we will now.

1430
01:41:01,495 --> 01:41:06,199
[SPEAKER_09]: A settlement was reached this week between the actor that portrayed Kevin Butler and Sony.

1431
01:41:06,639 --> 01:41:11,883
[SPEAKER_09]: You may recall that the actor was spotted in a commercial for a tire store playing a Nintendo Wii.

1432
01:41:12,284 --> 01:41:14,165
[SPEAKER_09]: This got us thinking about commercials and marketing.

1433
01:41:14,365 --> 01:41:16,127
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really all there is to say on that story.

1434
01:41:16,447 --> 01:41:17,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Legal issues settled out of court.

1435
01:41:18,048 --> 01:41:18,689
[SPEAKER_09]: What else is new?

1436
01:41:20,990 --> 01:41:27,714
[SPEAKER_09]: But since it got us thinking about commercials and marketing and like how big of an impact does somebody like Kevin Butler really have?

1437
01:41:27,734 --> 01:41:36,259
[SPEAKER_09]: So we went to Fugle and we asked the listeners, has a gaming system, game commercial or advertising campaign ever worked on you?

1438
01:41:36,659 --> 01:41:39,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Where it swayed you to make the decision to buy a game new?

1439
01:41:40,101 --> 01:41:45,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it something you experienced more in your youth or something you still find might tilt your opinion today?

1440
01:41:45,444 --> 01:41:46,846
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that can happen now.

1441
01:42:03,064 --> 01:42:03,985
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw on Facebook

1442
01:42:21,924 --> 01:42:26,548
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen many commercials for the latest gaming consoles, and neither one has swayed me into buying one.

1443
01:42:26,628 --> 01:42:33,433
[SPEAKER_09]: I always believe the only way to make a decision whether to buy the console or not is to actually try it, like the kiosks at the stores.

1444
01:42:34,254 --> 01:42:38,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Ragenator says, as a kid in the early 80s, before I became as jaded as I am today, yeah.

1445
01:42:38,958 --> 01:42:43,522
[SPEAKER_09]: But then again, commercials that were our marketing towards young kids typically work.

1446
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:46,281
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted one of those things so badly as a kid.

1447
01:43:14,349 --> 01:43:16,030
[SPEAKER_09]: You were a kid when the N-Gage came out.

1448
01:43:16,170 --> 01:43:16,791
[SPEAKER_09]: I was in my 20s.

1449
01:43:16,811 --> 01:43:18,132
[SPEAKER_07]: There's commercials for the Ouya?

1450
01:43:18,952 --> 01:43:20,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I didn't know there were commercials for the Ouya.

1451
01:43:21,174 --> 01:43:22,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that maybe online?

1452
01:43:23,775 --> 01:43:25,456
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there's commercials for the Ouya at all.

1453
01:43:26,157 --> 01:43:27,558
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if he meant to say the Wii.

1454
01:43:28,698 --> 01:43:29,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably.

1455
01:43:29,859 --> 01:43:33,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Because people were uneducated about it and then the ads for it got a mountain of people excited?

1456
01:43:33,602 --> 01:43:33,902
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1457
01:43:37,019 --> 01:43:40,620
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkTetsuya said, I did go to see The Wizard when I heard Super Mario Bros.

1458
01:43:40,881 --> 01:43:41,821
[SPEAKER_09]: 3 was going to debut in it.

1459
01:43:41,861 --> 01:43:42,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that count?

1460
01:43:43,102 --> 01:43:46,864
[SPEAKER_09]: That was like the best product placement ever done in the history of ever.

1461
01:43:47,124 --> 01:43:50,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I have to admit that I was interested.

1462
01:43:50,966 --> 01:43:56,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Who didn't get a gigantic nerd boner when they went and saw The Wizard and saw Super Mario 3 like the first footage?

1463
01:43:57,669 --> 01:44:00,130
[SPEAKER_09]: There has never been a better promotion, ever.

1464
01:44:00,750 --> 01:44:01,690
[SPEAKER_09]: I firmly believe that.

1465
01:44:01,750 --> 01:44:06,292
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Power Glove, which, by the way, I'm sorry, the Power Glove was a piece of shit.

1466
01:44:06,672 --> 01:44:07,552
[SPEAKER_09]: It really was.

1467
01:44:07,912 --> 01:44:08,832
[SPEAKER_09]: It was so shitty.

1468
01:44:09,133 --> 01:44:12,193
[SPEAKER_09]: That and the U-Force were both shittacular shit diversions.

1469
01:44:12,213 --> 01:44:13,894
[SPEAKER_07]: I already had a Power Glove when I saw that movie.

1470
01:44:13,914 --> 01:44:14,794
[SPEAKER_09]: And wasn't it shit?

1471
01:44:14,954 --> 01:44:15,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it was.

1472
01:44:15,735 --> 01:44:17,135
[SPEAKER_07]: It was absolute fucking shit.

1473
01:44:17,555 --> 01:44:19,757
[SPEAKER_09]: But, it's so bad.

1474
01:44:20,678 --> 01:44:23,941
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like, this is cool, except, wait, I can't do shit with this.

1475
01:44:23,961 --> 01:44:29,407
[SPEAKER_09]: You see the U-Force in the little print ad, like, playing Punch-Out, and you think, oh my god.

1476
01:44:30,227 --> 01:44:31,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo, bring back the Power Glove.

1477
01:44:31,729 --> 01:44:33,711
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, that would be fucking awesome.

1478
01:44:34,732 --> 01:44:35,833
[SPEAKER_07]: If it worked right.

1479
01:44:37,463 --> 01:44:40,106
[SPEAKER_07]: When they have haptic gloves, they need to have the power glove come back.

1480
01:44:41,307 --> 01:44:45,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the listeners are going to hate me for this, but you know how we always say time to penis?

1481
01:44:45,090 --> 01:44:47,533
[SPEAKER_09]: My concern with the power glove is time to fist.

1482
01:44:49,655 --> 01:44:50,235
[SPEAKER_05]: We know.

1483
01:44:53,298 --> 01:44:54,099
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so bad.

1484
01:44:54,359 --> 01:44:55,581
[SPEAKER_07]: It's ripped for her pleasure.

1485
01:44:58,123 --> 01:45:02,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to a comment from Burr.

1486
01:45:04,365 --> 01:45:15,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Burr says, you know what, it was the Kevin Butler ads along with the price cut that came with the release of the Slim that actually did help sway my opinion on the PlayStation 3 and finally got me to pick one up.

1487
01:45:16,349 --> 01:45:20,970
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, it was the moment that Sony finally meant business and let the games do the talking.

1488
01:45:21,330 --> 01:45:26,252
[SPEAKER_09]: The original PlayStation 3 ads were way too obscure and stupid by contrast.

1489
01:45:27,111 --> 01:45:29,052
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like when you let hipsters do commercials.

1490
01:45:30,673 --> 01:45:36,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Veronica S. replied and said, The very first Pokemon commercial that aired on TV caused me to buy Pokemon Blue version.

1491
01:45:37,096 --> 01:45:38,197
[SPEAKER_09]: I was 11 years old.

1492
01:45:38,917 --> 01:45:42,419
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the Pokemon cartoon was a pretty great tie-in.

1493
01:45:42,459 --> 01:45:43,399
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Pokemon movie?

1494
01:45:44,139 --> 01:45:44,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

1495
01:45:46,281 --> 01:45:46,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1496
01:45:46,641 --> 01:45:50,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Acidic Vampire says, Have you seen the Wii U launch commercial?

1497
01:45:50,643 --> 01:45:51,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell no.

1498
01:45:53,584 --> 01:45:54,925
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1499
01:46:20,841 --> 01:46:26,904
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Janai says, kiosks and store demos are the most helpful for my buying decisions.

1500
01:46:27,864 --> 01:46:32,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Steven M replied and said, the early Xbox promos for Kinect really got me excited to buy one.

1501
01:46:33,547 --> 01:46:37,729
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkCharger said, in my youth, I was probably swayed by many video game commercials.

1502
01:46:37,849 --> 01:46:42,331
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, who could forget the commercial like Journey for the Atari 2600?

1503
01:46:43,031 --> 01:46:46,253
[SPEAKER_09]: And he actually embedded the commercial here for us to watch.

1504
01:46:49,961 --> 01:46:53,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Data Age presents the world's first rock video game, Journey Escape.

1505
01:46:54,083 --> 01:46:54,763
[SPEAKER_03]: The concert's over.

1506
01:46:54,783 --> 01:47:09,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you must help each member of Journey Escape through mobs of love-crazed groupies, shifty-eyed promoters, photographers, find your roadies and manager, and run for the escape vehicle and live to rock another day.

1507
01:47:12,472 --> 01:47:15,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Journey Escape for the Atari 2600 from Data Age.

1508
01:47:16,174 --> 01:47:16,674
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1509
01:47:17,614 --> 01:47:19,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck Journey from last year.

1510
01:47:20,496 --> 01:47:21,816
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the true Journey.

1511
01:47:23,577 --> 01:47:26,279
[SPEAKER_09]: I regret putting Journey on my Games of the Year list.

1512
01:47:26,339 --> 01:47:30,281
[SPEAKER_09]: This just reminded me that there will only be one video game named Journey.

1513
01:47:31,302 --> 01:47:31,902
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm teasing.

1514
01:47:32,602 --> 01:47:32,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Mostly.

1515
01:47:33,483 --> 01:47:34,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anyhow.

1516
01:47:35,724 --> 01:47:36,805
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkCharger went on and said,

1517
01:47:44,929 --> 01:47:45,189
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1518
01:48:03,567 --> 01:48:05,228
[SPEAKER_09]: We need you guys to create a viral video.

1519
01:48:30,656 --> 01:48:38,785
[SPEAKER_09]: and I was interested in buying Dishonored but after seeing the trailer a million times before the game launched thanks to The Escapist and PATV I decided to pass on the game.

1520
01:48:39,506 --> 01:48:40,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Just do what I do.

1521
01:48:40,207 --> 01:48:40,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop watching TV.

1522
01:48:41,648 --> 01:48:43,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, these are web shows though.

1523
01:48:43,290 --> 01:48:44,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop watching TV web shows.

1524
01:48:45,112 --> 01:48:45,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Use Adblock.

1525
01:48:47,674 --> 01:48:52,157
[SPEAKER_09]: I will admit though, a lot of online sites can only seem to ever find one sponsor.

1526
01:48:52,417 --> 01:48:55,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan and I always pick the commercials for Hulu that talk about like food.

1527
01:48:57,780 --> 01:49:04,464
[SPEAKER_09]: I like this approach that, I hope I pronounce this correctly, Shea C said, define advertising.

1528
01:49:04,844 --> 01:49:09,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Were things like the Super Mario Brothers Super Show or the Sonic cartoon ads for a specific game?

1529
01:49:09,667 --> 01:49:10,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Not really.

1530
01:49:10,508 --> 01:49:15,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Were they media which kept the franchise visible, popular, and made us kids excited for the next game installment?

1531
01:49:15,530 --> 01:49:15,911
[SPEAKER_09]: You bet.

1532
01:49:16,471 --> 01:49:22,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Before the internet, gasp, TV ads, friends, and kiosks were the only way you'd actually see gameplay before getting it yourself.

1533
01:49:23,193 --> 01:49:25,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Magazines had reviews, but you'd only get stills.

1534
01:49:25,734 --> 01:49:27,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we've got trailers on demand and tons of review sites.

1535
01:49:27,975 --> 01:49:31,576
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like consumers are pulling information more than is being pushed to them.

1536
01:49:32,017 --> 01:49:37,418
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing they really need to nail with traditional advertising these days is making sure people know the title.

1537
01:49:37,839 --> 01:49:38,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting perspective.

1538
01:49:38,719 --> 01:49:41,200
[SPEAKER_09]: We were going down that line a little bit and talking about The Wizard and stuff.

1539
01:49:42,100 --> 01:49:52,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Degenerate Johnny said The only time I actually bought a console based on its advertisement alone was Tiger's Gamecom The commercial made the mobile gaming device as the shit

1540
01:49:52,811 --> 01:49:58,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, the little person's insulting remarks came off as insulting to the gaming community, but I recognized its satire.

1541
01:49:59,215 --> 01:50:02,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Not to mention it was pretty funny seeing the little guy get tossed around at the end of the ad.

1542
01:50:02,897 --> 01:50:04,958
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I'm fortunate to see that the device failed.

1543
01:50:05,058 --> 01:50:06,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, that thing failed.

1544
01:50:06,358 --> 01:50:11,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Since it had many features that were quite innovative for the late 90s, such as touchscreen controls and internet access.

1545
01:50:11,581 --> 01:50:15,824
[SPEAKER_09]: It goes to show that one must be mindful of its market if it hopes to make the product a success.

1546
01:50:16,684 --> 01:50:18,305
[SPEAKER_09]: And lastly, SHA100Matt says,

1547
01:50:40,860 --> 01:50:45,564
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the first time I ever got a real look at the graphics and games in action so I was immediately blown away.

1548
01:50:46,064 --> 01:50:48,426
[SPEAKER_09]: After that point I saved up my money and got the system at launch.

1549
01:50:48,706 --> 01:50:53,169
[SPEAKER_09]: I never realized that they'd sent out videos like that.

1550
01:50:53,189 --> 01:50:54,010
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of neat.

1551
01:50:55,785 --> 01:51:00,829
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if they were those really cheap cardboard tape things that could really fuck up your VCR if you used it wrong.

1552
01:51:01,609 --> 01:51:01,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1553
01:51:02,750 --> 01:51:05,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, we have not yet gone to Google+.

1554
01:51:05,612 --> 01:51:06,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me quickly get through Google+.

1555
01:51:07,013 --> 01:51:10,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft said, I would say that back in the 80s and 90s it worked.

1556
01:51:11,296 --> 01:51:18,060
[SPEAKER_09]: We got smothered with over-the-top, in-your-face advertisement back then and it probably got us to buy or ask our parents to get us a video game.

1557
01:51:18,561 --> 01:51:22,944
[SPEAKER_09]: But now, a lot of commercials for games are really bland and don't capture your attention that much.

1558
01:51:24,413 --> 01:51:30,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Critical Myth said, I can't say there was a commercial that did that for me, but print ads have convinced me more than a couple times.

1559
01:51:31,078 --> 01:51:32,960
[SPEAKER_09]: One I remember well was Xena Saga 2.

1560
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:35,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Cosmos had me at, hello.

1561
01:51:37,823 --> 01:51:43,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Maiko says, as much as I want to say no, it's the quality of the games that does it for me, like it did for the Dreamcast.

1562
01:51:43,687 --> 01:51:46,670
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to say yes if the Ouya counts, because I'm an idiot.

1563
01:51:46,970 --> 01:51:48,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so I guess there are Ouya commercials.

1564
01:51:48,791 --> 01:51:49,392
[SPEAKER_09]: What am I missing?

1565
01:51:49,972 --> 01:51:52,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there... Because that's the second person to say there are Ouya commercials.

1566
01:51:53,294 --> 01:51:54,255
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have just not seen one.

1567
01:51:54,935 --> 01:51:56,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's take a look here.

1568
01:51:56,716 --> 01:51:57,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob's on the hunt.

1569
01:51:57,937 --> 01:52:02,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Shane is adding that those videos were real VHS tapes and they were fantastic.

1570
01:52:07,063 --> 01:52:07,743
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be damned.

1571
01:52:07,824 --> 01:52:09,965
[SPEAKER_09]: There is an... Oh no, that says fan-made.

1572
01:52:11,620 --> 01:52:15,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if it's the Kickstarter ad these guys are referring to.

1573
01:52:15,223 --> 01:52:16,624
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably the Kickstarter video that they had.

1574
01:52:16,644 --> 01:52:17,405
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet that's what it is.

1575
01:52:17,465 --> 01:52:19,486
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like the modern type of ad.

1576
01:52:19,726 --> 01:52:20,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1577
01:52:23,209 --> 01:52:23,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1578
01:52:24,410 --> 01:52:31,975
[SPEAKER_09]: E3VL says, "...advertising campaigns worked on me in my youth due to the limited social media exposure, magazines, TV, and radio.

1579
01:52:32,376 --> 01:52:40,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Now with the internet involved, ads are everywhere and it's second nature to ignore them or it becomes background noise with the instant impulse hit the X or skip button when it's available."

1580
01:52:40,922 --> 01:53:10,134
[SPEAKER_09]: also now that I purchase things with my own money instead of my parents I tend to do research before purchasing and ads are just a way to get me curious about coming trends instead of impulse buys or begging for the blast processing for Christmas slash birthday and lastly Techie Q says no today's ads campaigns to sway me has less effect on me now thanks to internet but it did sway me more during the Super Nintendo era of gaming those early Super Mario World and Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past commercials swayed me hard to get a Super Nintendo

1581
01:53:10,794 --> 01:53:12,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Good answers tonight and good reminiscing

1582
01:53:32,060 --> 01:53:35,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news for the week.

1583
01:53:35,962 --> 01:53:38,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you to everybody on Facebook and Google for answering the question.

1584
01:53:38,784 --> 01:53:39,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

1585
01:53:39,404 --> 01:53:46,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so we've been talking about it and I'm sure you guys have no idea what Disney Infinity is even though we've been talking about it for months now.

1586
01:53:47,729 --> 01:53:49,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably months longer than everybody else, but...

1587
01:53:49,830 --> 01:54:16,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Disney Infinity finally got announced this week and basically it's this cool combination of like toys and a little base that you put them on and games and then they have this toy box mode so basically what kind of makes it different than Skylanders is it's not just one single I mean it is they have the toy box mode where you can kind of take all these toys and build your own world out of it which is kind of cool and

1588
01:54:18,322 --> 01:54:23,885
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not some single game that you have to buy characters for to unlock all the parts of the game.

1589
01:54:24,005 --> 01:54:25,626
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really the main thing.

1590
01:54:25,686 --> 01:54:30,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby was being funny on Twitter and saying, so is this something that I can like now?

1591
01:54:31,810 --> 01:54:33,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you giving me permission to like this?

1592
01:54:33,471 --> 01:54:35,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you gave everybody crap about Skylanders.

1593
01:54:36,372 --> 01:54:42,075
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I say it's a little bit different because each individual character and playset or whatever is its own thing.

1594
01:54:42,315 --> 01:54:50,378
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not necessarily like, oh, I have to buy Captain Jack Sparrow to get to this one part of the Monsters, Inc.

1595
01:54:50,398 --> 01:54:51,279
[SPEAKER_07]: world or something like that.

1596
01:54:51,679 --> 01:54:52,419
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like that at all.

1597
01:54:52,459 --> 01:54:55,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Each thing is its own game, and then what kind of ties them all together is the...

1598
01:54:56,801 --> 01:55:00,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Toybox mode where you can build wherever the fuck you want.

1599
01:55:00,442 --> 01:55:02,323
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've got racing stuff in there.

1600
01:55:02,343 --> 01:55:05,144
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like they're combining a little bit of the LittleBigPlanet stuff.

1601
01:55:05,424 --> 01:55:13,026
[SPEAKER_07]: You can set your camera at certain spots so you can do a 2D platformer or you can make a racing game or you can just do whatever.

1602
01:55:13,247 --> 01:55:15,307
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can share these all around the world.

1603
01:55:15,407 --> 01:55:16,748
[SPEAKER_07]: And it sounds like they're going to have...

1604
01:55:17,788 --> 01:55:19,368
[SPEAKER_07]: I think DLC you could buy for it.

1605
01:55:19,388 --> 01:55:20,729
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to have actual toys.

1606
01:55:20,769 --> 01:55:23,729
[SPEAKER_07]: The toys are like $12 each for each individual character.

1607
01:55:24,109 --> 01:55:31,931
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get play sets that are like $35, which are going to include a few characters and a world, as well as some different power-ups and stuff.

1608
01:55:33,312 --> 01:55:35,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk about total fan service on a lot of stuff.

1609
01:55:36,112 --> 01:55:38,013
[SPEAKER_07]: The game itself actually comes with three worlds.

1610
01:55:38,113 --> 01:55:39,313
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Monsters University...

1611
01:55:40,173 --> 01:55:53,697
[SPEAKER_07]: The Incredibles and Pirates of the Caribbean and they've got Captain Jack Sparrow, Mr. Incredible and Sully from Monsters U and Monsters Inc in that first playset or the first thing they're packing in there for $75.

1612
01:55:53,958 --> 01:55:54,678
[SPEAKER_09]: What a surprise!

1613
01:55:54,778 --> 01:55:55,358
[SPEAKER_09]: I had no idea.

1614
01:55:56,570 --> 01:55:56,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1615
01:55:57,331 --> 01:55:59,712
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, let's see what else.

1616
01:56:00,293 --> 01:56:03,895
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, they've got Tron, at least some hints of Tron in there.

1617
01:56:04,116 --> 01:56:05,777
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've got other characters.

1618
01:56:05,957 --> 01:56:10,800
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually, I think I posted a few things on there, like different screen grabs and stuff.

1619
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:11,221
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah.

1620
01:56:12,001 --> 01:56:15,262
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got like Phineas and Ferb is going to be something else that they have on there.

1621
01:56:15,322 --> 01:56:16,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Love Phineas and Ferb.

1622
01:56:16,482 --> 01:56:18,243
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've got, you know, of course.

1623
01:56:18,263 --> 01:56:19,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Jack Skellington.

1624
01:56:19,423 --> 01:56:20,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Jack Skellington was in there.

1625
01:56:20,824 --> 01:56:21,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Sign me up for that.

1626
01:56:21,744 --> 01:56:24,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Toy Story, obviously, because that was the kind of the Toy Box moment.

1627
01:56:24,965 --> 01:56:27,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Toy Story 3 is what kind of inspired them to do all this stuff.

1628
01:56:27,546 --> 01:56:27,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1629
01:56:28,226 --> 01:56:30,507
[SPEAKER_07]: And Cars is going to be something else.

1630
01:56:30,827 --> 01:56:32,567
[SPEAKER_07]: And Wreck-It Ralph is in there.

1631
01:56:32,748 --> 01:56:36,909
[SPEAKER_07]: And they even have some hints of like Sugar Rush, which would be pretty cool.

1632
01:56:37,889 --> 01:56:41,571
[SPEAKER_07]: All this stuff is supposed to be coming out.

1633
01:56:41,631 --> 01:56:45,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Frozen is going to have some characters with that when that movie comes out this fall.

1634
01:56:45,714 --> 01:56:48,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's a couple problems though.

1635
01:56:48,615 --> 01:56:52,978
[SPEAKER_09]: The Disney nerd in me wants to go all in on this shit.

1636
01:56:53,338 --> 01:56:56,960
[SPEAKER_09]: I collect the pins, which is an expensive hobby.

1637
01:56:58,821 --> 01:57:00,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not go to the figurines?

1638
01:57:01,383 --> 01:57:02,463
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's my concern.

1639
01:57:02,704 --> 01:57:04,765
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really worried about the quality of the game.

1640
01:57:05,425 --> 01:57:32,272
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm gonna be honest whether this is a rational reason or not I'm just being I'm keeping it real I'm worried about who's developing it they don't have an established product under their belt Avalanche like a lot of the stuff they put out have been kiddie games Toy Story 3 obviously was them too and if you look at what they did before Disney picked them up they did a lot of bad games like Sub-Zero Mythologies and all that now granted

1641
01:57:32,972 --> 01:57:38,637
[SPEAKER_09]: We all make mistakes and we should give them a chance that maybe this is something that will break through, but I'm concerned.

1642
01:57:42,075 --> 01:57:46,658
[SPEAKER_09]: The gameplay footage didn't really make me go, you know?

1643
01:57:47,198 --> 01:57:48,219
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't lose my shit.

1644
01:57:48,699 --> 01:57:50,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, did you watch any of the interview videos?

1645
01:57:50,380 --> 01:57:52,061
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually had more in-depth gameplay stuff.

1646
01:57:52,121 --> 01:57:52,961
[SPEAKER_07]: To be fair, no.

1647
01:57:52,981 --> 01:57:56,503
[SPEAKER_09]: I only watched the common trailer that was out there.

1648
01:57:56,523 --> 01:57:56,884
[SPEAKER_07]: It looked okay.

1649
01:57:56,904 --> 01:58:01,786
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's not like, you know, none of this is really making me go, oh, I gotta pick that up.

1650
01:58:01,827 --> 01:58:06,529
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the toy box mode sounds really cool, but once again, I was kind of even thinking about it.

1651
01:58:06,549 --> 01:58:07,350
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, do I even...

1652
01:58:08,050 --> 01:58:08,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Warhammer Disney K

1653
01:58:30,657 --> 01:58:31,658
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's just so cool.

1654
01:58:31,698 --> 01:58:34,841
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd have to see what stuff comes out and how it gets priced.

1655
01:58:36,202 --> 01:58:42,246
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's going to sell really well, and the fact that they have this whole kind of synergy where you can build your own world is kind of unique.

1656
01:58:42,366 --> 01:58:42,806
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1657
01:58:42,887 --> 01:58:47,610
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really going to set them apart from Skylanders, because Skylanders is like, you buy a bunch of characters, you play one game.

1658
01:58:48,291 --> 01:58:49,612
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a dungeon crawler, and that's it.

1659
01:58:49,872 --> 01:58:53,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas this, they could have multiple game types.

1660
01:58:53,134 --> 01:58:56,897
[SPEAKER_07]: They could have, you know, this is going to be a racing game, this is going to be an adventure game, whatever.

1661
01:58:57,097 --> 01:59:02,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Something to remember about those little RFIDs too is that they don't just, you know, they're not just chips that transmit data.

1662
01:59:02,840 --> 01:59:03,761
[SPEAKER_09]: They can save data.

1663
01:59:03,921 --> 01:59:04,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1664
01:59:04,201 --> 01:59:05,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a limited amount, right?

1665
01:59:05,601 --> 01:59:06,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a little bit.

1666
01:59:06,422 --> 01:59:09,704
[SPEAKER_09]: But maybe enough so that you could bring with you a level design.

1667
01:59:10,064 --> 01:59:10,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1668
01:59:10,744 --> 01:59:11,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

1669
01:59:12,025 --> 01:59:14,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Or at least you can share those on the internet, apparently.

1670
01:59:14,606 --> 01:59:17,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Like with other people and play their creations or invite your friends over.

1671
01:59:17,848 --> 01:59:20,449
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do four-player co-op over the internet.

1672
01:59:20,469 --> 01:59:23,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1673
01:59:24,870 --> 01:59:25,210
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1674
01:59:25,551 --> 01:59:28,434
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I'll wait until a little closer, look at some of the reviews.

1675
01:59:28,474 --> 01:59:32,418
[SPEAKER_09]: There's that part of me that's like, must have all figurines, must have them all.

1676
01:59:33,179 --> 01:59:34,721
[SPEAKER_09]: The figurines look cool.

1677
01:59:34,961 --> 01:59:36,903
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw pictures of them.

1678
01:59:37,504 --> 01:59:38,125
[SPEAKER_07]: They're well done.

1679
01:59:39,460 --> 01:59:44,122
[SPEAKER_07]: And here's the thing, too, that I'm not too positive on, but it looks like they articulate.

1680
01:59:44,203 --> 01:59:55,047
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like the arms, at least they've got seams on the arms where it looks like they could move, limited at least, but that's more than Skylanders can, so, you know, that'd be interesting.

1681
01:59:55,067 --> 01:59:58,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that why they're going to be more expensive than the figure, or is that just Disney tax?

1682
01:59:58,389 --> 02:00:00,150
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not that much more expensive than Skylanders.

1683
02:00:00,170 --> 02:00:01,110
[SPEAKER_07]: But they are more expensive.

1684
02:00:01,330 --> 02:00:02,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they are more expensive.

1685
02:00:02,451 --> 02:00:03,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that Disney tax?

1686
02:00:03,611 --> 02:00:04,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably Disney tax.

1687
02:00:05,792 --> 02:00:06,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Just curious.

1688
02:00:07,513 --> 02:00:11,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well that is definitely the future of gaming, like it or not.

1689
02:00:13,199 --> 02:00:25,030
[SPEAKER_09]: It concerns me though is that if we support Disney Infinity, that we're saying we want more of this, and I really worry about the barrage of knockoffs that this whole Skylander thing is going to cause.

1690
02:00:25,070 --> 02:00:25,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Pokemon.

1691
02:00:26,831 --> 02:00:28,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, I was talking to Shane about that.

1692
02:00:28,252 --> 02:00:32,193
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, can you imagine if Nintendo just said, we want to do Pokemon like this?

1693
02:00:32,714 --> 02:00:33,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Shane would have them all.

1694
02:00:33,734 --> 02:00:34,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my God.

1695
02:00:34,935 --> 02:00:36,195
[SPEAKER_09]: But he brought up a good point with me.

1696
02:00:36,235 --> 02:00:37,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe he'll call in the show later and talk about it.

1697
02:00:37,896 --> 02:00:40,257
[SPEAKER_09]: He said that the creator of Pokemon actually hates DLC.

1698
02:00:41,057 --> 02:00:43,198
[SPEAKER_09]: So, they may not be... But I...

1699
02:00:43,978 --> 02:00:46,601
[SPEAKER_07]: He may hate DLC, but they're going to have DLC in the next Pokemon game.

1700
02:00:48,303 --> 02:00:50,305
[SPEAKER_07]: He may hate it all he wants, but he's not calling a shot.

1701
02:00:50,325 --> 02:00:52,227
[SPEAKER_09]: And they used to do those Burger King toys back in the day.

1702
02:00:52,247 --> 02:00:52,868
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I told him.

1703
02:00:52,908 --> 02:00:55,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I said they used to have little toys for all the Pokemon.

1704
02:00:55,391 --> 02:01:02,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine that they will literally have Pokeballs that you put your fucking figurine in that you put it out on...

1705
02:01:03,399 --> 02:01:07,261
[SPEAKER_09]: That was Burger King like 12 years ago.

1706
02:01:07,361 --> 02:01:15,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to tell you, after they banned all those Pokeballs, we went to a Burger King and went through the drive-thru 10 times to get more Pokeballs so that we could hang them up on the tree.

1707
02:01:15,645 --> 02:01:16,565
[SPEAKER_05]: So you didn't have to get yourself with them?

1708
02:01:17,106 --> 02:01:19,107
[SPEAKER_05]: No, just so that we could have a pile of Pokeballs.

1709
02:01:19,787 --> 02:01:23,311
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually had a box full of Pokeballs and little Pokemon toys because we wanted all of them.

1710
02:01:24,392 --> 02:01:26,714
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally we're like, wait, this is stupid and gave them all away.

1711
02:01:26,914 --> 02:01:29,336
[SPEAKER_09]: I went as Ash Ketchum one Halloween.

1712
02:01:29,436 --> 02:01:32,740
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you to Burger King for those Pokeballs because they were great for my costume.

1713
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:41,188
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, and honestly, maybe the other thing that got me psyched about the whole Disney Infinity thing is the fact that they had Nero's me and you in the trailer, which is pretty awesome.

1714
02:01:41,208 --> 02:01:42,089
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, yes!

1715
02:01:43,956 --> 02:01:45,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Arcade Arcade Arcade Arcade Arcade Arcade Arcade

1716
02:02:12,060 --> 02:02:15,822
[SPEAKER_09]: and Darren Spahn, who is the owner of this with his wife, Mickey.

1717
02:02:16,102 --> 02:02:22,884
[SPEAKER_09]: What they're trying to do with this, they want to recreate the experience of arcade gaming saying, quote, people have lost that social experience.

1718
02:02:23,165 --> 02:02:24,925
[SPEAKER_09]: They sit on couches with their Xbox.

1719
02:02:24,945 --> 02:02:26,066
[SPEAKER_09]: They never talk to their kids.

1720
02:02:26,386 --> 02:02:31,608
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to come to a place where you can play together with your kids too and find something that the whole family enjoys.

1721
02:02:32,649 --> 02:02:35,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, it should be noted, this place has been around since November of 2010.

1722
02:02:36,532 --> 02:02:47,242
[SPEAKER_09]: It is just making the rounds on the Game Blog this week because of an article that was discovered on Statesman.com, which I'm assuming is kind of like an Austin, so people were able to find it on the internet and kind of figure out more about this place.

1723
02:02:47,642 --> 02:02:53,267
[SPEAKER_09]: But yay to this guy and his wife bringing back the retro arcade stuff.

1724
02:02:53,347 --> 02:02:54,028
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's great.

1725
02:02:55,602 --> 02:03:18,017
[SPEAKER_09]: even the article the original article talks about some games like Missile Command they don't make much money but he keeps them because they're classics and the other thing about the arcade I was looking at the actual website everything in that arcade is for sale so let's say you go in and you're playing Galaga and you're like I want to buy this machine you can buy it so it's almost like a interactive show floor where you could buy the games I think it's kind of awesome

1726
02:03:20,011 --> 02:03:20,391
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1727
02:03:21,071 --> 02:03:22,092
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll take all of them.

1728
02:03:23,152 --> 02:03:26,753
[SPEAKER_09]: There did seem to be a healthy amount of ticket spitting games, too.

1729
02:03:26,833 --> 02:03:30,714
[SPEAKER_09]: More like the hand-me-down kind of ticket spitting games, like things that were in arcades a few years ago.

1730
02:03:31,474 --> 02:03:32,555
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't go wrong with skee-ball.

1731
02:03:32,715 --> 02:03:33,435
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't love skee-ball.

1732
02:03:33,455 --> 02:03:34,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Skee-ball is amazing.

1733
02:03:34,635 --> 02:03:37,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Press the button to stop the light types of games, you know?

1734
02:03:38,177 --> 02:03:39,637
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the... That's how they throw birthday parties.

1735
02:03:39,657 --> 02:03:40,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoke and token.

1736
02:03:41,398 --> 02:03:42,718
[SPEAKER_05]: And spider stomp.

1737
02:03:44,319 --> 02:04:05,654
[SPEAKER_09]: uh apparently a second and third location elsewhere in Austin could be coming this year and you know remember guys he opened this place in November 2010 I mean the economy's been kind of in the shitter in the past couple years yet this place didn't go out of business that's awesome and clearly it's because of the Star Trek backdrop he has there in the arcade that's what keeps that place awesome anyhow

1738
02:04:06,721 --> 02:04:07,381
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a no fear.

1739
02:04:07,742 --> 02:04:09,242
[SPEAKER_05]: You know who else has a no fear?

1740
02:04:09,422 --> 02:04:10,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan, right?

1741
02:04:10,963 --> 02:04:11,623
[SPEAKER_05]: We had one.

1742
02:04:12,224 --> 02:04:13,784
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the last table we sold.

1743
02:04:14,085 --> 02:04:21,548
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to have a giant Picard picture on the wall with him saying make it so or something.

1744
02:04:21,788 --> 02:04:22,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Somewhere in there.

1745
02:04:22,449 --> 02:04:23,369
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be pretty awesome.

1746
02:04:26,150 --> 02:04:27,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on with more news.

1747
02:04:28,570 --> 02:04:29,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, it's my turn, isn't it?

1748
02:04:30,772 --> 02:04:31,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Silly iPad.

1749
02:04:32,273 --> 02:04:37,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there is a game coming out by an indie studio called Stab Yourself.

1750
02:04:38,398 --> 02:04:39,399
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the best name ever.

1751
02:04:39,799 --> 02:04:41,321
[SPEAKER_05]: It's stabyourself.net.

1752
02:04:42,362 --> 02:04:47,086
[SPEAKER_05]: They basically recreate 80s games and then apply modern physics to them.

1753
02:04:47,506 --> 02:04:54,312
[SPEAKER_05]: They've done a game called Not Tetris, where basically it's like Game Boy Tetris, except the bricks actually fall with the same momentum a brick really would.

1754
02:04:55,072 --> 02:04:55,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario, M-A-R-I-Zero

1755
02:05:20,806 --> 02:05:23,048
[SPEAKER_05]: and the ghosts don't move by themselves either.

1756
02:05:23,088 --> 02:05:25,129
[SPEAKER_05]: They might fall into you as you're turning.

1757
02:05:25,589 --> 02:05:30,433
[SPEAKER_05]: So it applies a new aspect of physics to the game and I need this in my life.

1758
02:05:30,493 --> 02:05:32,794
[SPEAKER_09]: That is actually badass, I've got to say.

1759
02:05:33,034 --> 02:05:35,176
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a really smart innovation.

1760
02:05:35,956 --> 02:05:41,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, it's stab yourself with love and good ideas is what they talk about in the name.

1761
02:05:41,080 --> 02:05:42,481
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stab yourself with innovation.

1762
02:05:42,681 --> 02:05:43,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, exactly.

1763
02:05:43,741 --> 02:05:45,262
[SPEAKER_05]: It's stabyourself.net.

1764
02:05:45,743 --> 02:05:46,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Go get it.

1765
02:05:46,523 --> 02:05:46,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I want it.

1766
02:05:47,144 --> 02:05:47,724
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to get it.

1767
02:05:48,625 --> 02:05:50,506
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that you can control it with a steering wheel.

1768
02:05:50,986 --> 02:05:51,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally did.

1769
02:05:51,747 --> 02:05:54,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, we've got Dan's steering wheel rig.

1770
02:05:55,169 --> 02:05:55,989
[SPEAKER_05]: We could totally do that.

1771
02:05:56,049 --> 02:05:56,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, no, no.

1772
02:05:57,450 --> 02:05:58,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I have to add something.

1773
02:05:58,711 --> 02:06:00,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Rewind back into the gaming week.

1774
02:06:00,832 --> 02:06:02,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what my husband is doing tonight?

1775
02:06:03,514 --> 02:06:08,617
[SPEAKER_05]: He is building himself a three monitor rig just for playing Gran Turismo and Outrun.

1776
02:06:10,427 --> 02:06:10,987
[SPEAKER_05]: My husband!

1777
02:06:11,228 --> 02:06:13,149
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't realize OutRun used three monitors.

1778
02:06:13,809 --> 02:06:14,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1779
02:06:14,390 --> 02:06:16,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the old OutRun or the new OutRun?

1780
02:06:16,271 --> 02:06:16,831
[SPEAKER_05]: The newer ones.

1781
02:06:17,892 --> 02:06:24,296
[SPEAKER_05]: He's basically building the rig so he can hook up his PC to do full three-screen gaming.

1782
02:06:24,797 --> 02:06:30,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if you're going to do something like that with an Xbox or a PS3, you actually have to have other systems, like multiple systems to get it to run.

1783
02:06:30,661 --> 02:06:33,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know Gran Turismo, you need like three systems, three monitors.

1784
02:06:33,562 --> 02:06:40,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but he's doing something so that he can play all of the PC-based games with three monitors.

1785
02:06:40,567 --> 02:06:43,109
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1786
02:07:01,385 --> 02:07:27,448
[SPEAKER_07]: um apparently the whole thing was that Wildman's Kickstarter needed to actually it needs to earn that money because otherwise they're gonna they would have had to lay everyone off anyways without um any of their like paid time off and stuff cashed out and any of the benefits or severances and stuff um and uh right now I think I'm actually gonna check to see how their Kickstarter is doing um

1787
02:07:29,977 --> 02:07:31,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1788
02:07:50,793 --> 02:07:54,477
[SPEAKER_07]: and unfortunately it's just bad timing I guess.

1789
02:07:54,677 --> 02:08:00,302
[SPEAKER_07]: They just had to lay them off now so they have money to actually do that.

1790
02:08:00,342 --> 02:08:04,166
[SPEAKER_07]: They're still operating but it's way slimmed down.

1791
02:08:04,386 --> 02:08:09,831
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, pretty much everybody's gone except for the head of the studio and I think a couple people.

1792
02:08:11,796 --> 02:08:13,539
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of going to suck.

1793
02:08:14,340 --> 02:08:21,111
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing too is Codemasters has laid off 80 people as well and they're restructuring.

1794
02:08:21,692 --> 02:08:26,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, there's three companies tonight that are having major, major problems.

1795
02:08:26,604 --> 02:08:27,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1796
02:08:27,804 --> 02:08:37,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Codemasters, really, they don't have... I mean, they have had some okay games come out, but a lot of their stuff recently hasn't done terribly well.

1797
02:08:37,528 --> 02:08:38,569
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say... I'm trying to think.

1798
02:08:38,969 --> 02:08:42,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Dirt 3 was the last game I remember them having put out.

1799
02:08:42,750 --> 02:08:52,214
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they have Grid 2 coming, and also their Formula 1 title didn't do terribly well, and I don't think their Formula 1 kart racing game did terribly well either.

1800
02:08:53,634 --> 02:08:54,455
[SPEAKER_07]: So that kind of sucks.

1801
02:08:54,875 --> 02:08:56,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they can make something other than racing games.

1802
02:08:59,299 --> 02:09:00,800
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they tried that and it wasn't terribly well.

1803
02:09:00,820 --> 02:09:05,003
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, but what's worked for them, like Dirt was one of their biggest games.

1804
02:09:05,564 --> 02:09:06,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Grid looked pretty cool.

1805
02:09:06,364 --> 02:09:07,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Grid too.

1806
02:09:07,265 --> 02:09:09,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Grid too, so I'm looking forward to see what that looks like.

1807
02:09:10,668 --> 02:09:15,151
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to see a next-gen Dirt game on the new consoles when they come out.

1808
02:09:15,211 --> 02:09:16,212
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that'd be pretty awesome.

1809
02:09:17,373 --> 02:09:37,502
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd also like to see a next-gen Ridge Racer that doesn't fucking suck Namco you have more time come on not a fucking rehash of what fuck seven or six or how many times what game did they actually have new tracks in was that four four had new tracks in it I mean seriously new Ridge Racer would be awesome

1810
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:40,741
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, moving on to another story here.

1811
02:09:58,109 --> 02:09:59,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

1812
02:10:18,265 --> 02:10:18,926
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.

1813
02:10:35,149 --> 02:10:42,214
[SPEAKER_09]: He announced his retirement on January 17th and the thread has grown to over 170 pages.

1814
02:10:42,915 --> 02:10:51,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob Pardo, the chief creative officer at Blizzard, came into the thread saying, "...this thread saddens me greatly.

1815
02:10:51,701 --> 02:11:00,568
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that the Battle.net forums have earned a reputation for rough justice, but I do not believe justice is being served by how people are speaking about Jay's departure from Diablo 3."

1816
02:11:01,989 --> 02:11:02,570
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.com

1817
02:11:18,547 --> 02:11:22,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting protective parent kind of attitude going on there.

1818
02:11:22,930 --> 02:11:25,552
[SPEAKER_09]: That's caring about your employees.

1819
02:11:25,612 --> 02:11:27,193
[SPEAKER_09]: That's interesting.

1820
02:11:27,313 --> 02:11:30,936
[SPEAKER_09]: They could hire me now.

1821
02:11:31,236 --> 02:11:33,618
[SPEAKER_09]: If you were the lead designer on Diablo 3, what would you do?

1822
02:11:35,839 --> 02:11:36,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Garrus.

1823
02:11:36,940 --> 02:11:38,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I didn't say it.

1824
02:11:38,941 --> 02:11:39,642
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't say it.

1825
02:11:41,483 --> 02:11:44,085
[SPEAKER_05]: I would license out to BioWare to make a Mass Effect MMO.

1826
02:11:45,136 --> 02:11:51,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, now he acknowledged also, this is what we're saying, the Diablo community deserves an even better game.

1827
02:11:52,601 --> 02:11:58,625
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a talented team in place and have no intention of stopping work on Diablo 3 until it is the best game in the franchise.

1828
02:11:59,706 --> 02:12:06,330
[SPEAKER_09]: So interestingly, this game is coming up on, what, nine months out and they're still trying to get the game they really want.

1829
02:12:07,759 --> 02:12:09,782
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a weird place we're at in the industry.

1830
02:12:09,842 --> 02:12:14,268
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's not that Diablo 3 is bad, but it was extremely disappointing.

1831
02:12:14,648 --> 02:12:15,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Extremely disappointing.

1832
02:12:15,770 --> 02:12:17,112
[SPEAKER_09]: And Torchlight 2 is kind of better.

1833
02:12:19,927 --> 02:12:22,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's open up the mailbag.

1834
02:12:22,549 --> 02:12:24,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see what the listeners have to say, shall we?

1835
02:12:26,551 --> 02:12:29,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is the place you can email us each week.

1836
02:12:30,114 --> 02:12:35,117
[SPEAKER_09]: And usually, DarkSakura will dive into the email bag headfirst, but not tonight.

1837
02:12:36,337 --> 02:12:41,521
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can tell by my sexy-ass voice tonight, I really don't have much of a voice to do it.

1838
02:12:41,661 --> 02:12:44,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Impersonating your mother earlier probably didn't help that.

1839
02:12:44,202 --> 02:12:44,883
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it didn't.

1840
02:12:44,903 --> 02:12:45,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm suffering for that now.

1841
02:12:46,884 --> 02:12:47,705
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what you need?

1842
02:12:47,725 --> 02:12:48,165
[SPEAKER_09]: More coffee.

1843
02:12:48,993 --> 02:12:51,395
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, that's a good idea and I know where you keep it, but I'm not doing it

1844
02:13:09,932 --> 02:13:10,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god Oh my god

1845
02:13:30,683 --> 02:13:31,484
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura

1846
02:13:53,661 --> 02:13:57,544
[SPEAKER_09]: This email definitely needs some more Dancer, so let's give him some Dancer.

1847
02:13:57,584 --> 02:13:58,845
[SPEAKER_09]: God damn it, now I can't find Dancer.

1848
02:13:59,746 --> 02:14:10,935
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that was like one of the first Bimani game I actually bought brand new that wasn't a DDR.

1849
02:14:15,330 --> 02:14:19,574
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember how we would all sit around with like little figurines and stand behind people while they played that.

1850
02:14:19,594 --> 02:14:20,034
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the best.

1851
02:14:20,054 --> 02:14:20,855
[SPEAKER_05]: That was absolutely the best.

1852
02:14:20,915 --> 02:14:24,038
[SPEAKER_05]: And then try to parra parra with Last Message.

1853
02:14:24,298 --> 02:14:26,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the thing I want to know about this email.

1854
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:30,804
[SPEAKER_09]: So I actually offline earlier in the week, I wrote back to Plagueis.

1855
02:14:30,844 --> 02:14:32,045
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm waiting to hear back.

1856
02:14:32,085 --> 02:14:33,246
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, yeah, it's us.

1857
02:14:33,546 --> 02:14:34,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, long story short.

1858
02:14:34,967 --> 02:14:40,132
[SPEAKER_09]: But my curiosity is I've been searching for an online radio show for a long while now.

1859
02:14:40,572 --> 02:14:50,137
[SPEAKER_09]: and after haphazardly stumbling across this podcast so it's like he was looking for the old show and found this mess instead.

1860
02:14:50,157 --> 02:14:51,778
[SPEAKER_05]: We still have our Bimani love.

1861
02:14:51,838 --> 02:14:53,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course we have our Bimani love.

1862
02:14:54,379 --> 02:14:55,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Akira Yamaoka is still God.

1863
02:14:59,562 --> 02:14:59,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

1864
02:15:01,403 --> 02:15:02,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on with more emails.

1865
02:15:02,683 --> 02:15:06,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I do have to say I have a special place in my heart for Desiree.

1866
02:15:07,646 --> 02:15:07,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is that?

1867
02:15:08,919 --> 02:15:11,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuckin' Desro I love Cobalt

1868
02:15:12,417 --> 02:15:14,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to an email from Redertainment.

1869
02:15:14,758 --> 02:15:18,698
[SPEAKER_09]: There is another aspect to the mandatory internet connection issue that's not being brought up.

1870
02:15:40,143 --> 02:15:56,274
[SPEAKER_09]: what if the person playing the game can't connect to the publisher's servers not because of any problem with the consumer or the publisher but because of an ISP's complete and utter fucking incompetence what if due to the ISP being run by morons who think a foresight is something only the uncircumcised deal with

1871
02:15:59,807 --> 02:16:00,288
[SPEAKER_09]: That was good.

1872
02:16:01,128 --> 02:16:07,695
[SPEAKER_09]: The consumer or the publisher cannot connect to one another because of a failure by one or more internet service providers.

1873
02:16:08,036 --> 02:16:14,843
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just one of the reasons why I think of publishers mandating consumers be connected to the internet as a bad idea.

1874
02:16:14,963 --> 02:16:19,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Stay black, redertainment, and yes, I did just come up with the foresight line.

1875
02:16:19,808 --> 02:16:20,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Trainer.

1876
02:16:21,130 --> 02:16:22,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that because you always say Garrus?

1877
02:16:23,372 --> 02:16:23,993
[SPEAKER_09]: He says trainer.

1878
02:16:24,293 --> 02:16:24,533
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1879
02:16:24,553 --> 02:16:25,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

1880
02:16:26,275 --> 02:16:29,899
[SPEAKER_09]: So... You notice I haven't said it once during the course of the show.

1881
02:16:29,959 --> 02:16:30,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I've said it like three times now.

1882
02:16:31,261 --> 02:16:36,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Shitty internet service providers being a reason... Well, I mean, you're preaching to the choir, Redertainment.

1883
02:16:36,446 --> 02:16:37,547
[SPEAKER_09]: This shit's a bad idea.

1884
02:16:37,627 --> 02:16:41,432
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're just throwing another ingredient in the pot on why this is a bad idea.

1885
02:16:41,572 --> 02:16:41,812
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean...

1886
02:16:43,374 --> 02:16:46,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, we had in the past, the show would drop several times.

1887
02:16:46,596 --> 02:16:54,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, maybe that wasn't the ISP's fault necessarily, but, uh, you know, if you have a bad router or something, you know, you're gonna pay for that with your game.

1888
02:16:54,463 --> 02:16:56,124
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, it's ridiculous.

1889
02:16:58,306 --> 02:16:59,807
[SPEAKER_09]: I, I agree with you, Red Entertainment.

1890
02:16:59,847 --> 02:17:00,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1891
02:17:00,568 --> 02:17:01,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, sir.

1892
02:17:01,189 --> 02:17:01,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1893
02:17:04,524 --> 02:17:06,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Another email here from AZHP.

1894
02:17:06,925 --> 02:17:07,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, OLR.

1895
02:17:07,586 --> 02:17:09,247
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a long one, by the way, but it's a good one.

1896
02:17:09,868 --> 02:17:10,688
[SPEAKER_09]: AZHP here.

1897
02:17:10,748 --> 02:17:12,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry in advance for the long email.

1898
02:17:12,230 --> 02:17:12,710
[SPEAKER_09]: You're forgiven.

1899
02:17:13,250 --> 02:17:17,474
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's on two subjects that are really important to me, and I'm sure some of you as well, so I hope you read it.

1900
02:17:17,974 --> 02:17:28,783
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember you guys mentioning the Awesome Games Done Quick Charity Marathon for the Prevent Cancer Foundation on the show last week, and I wanted to give a little more background on it in case anyone was interested in the marathon or the cause.

1901
02:17:29,423 --> 02:17:30,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching.

1902
02:17:55,505 --> 02:17:58,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Two-year research grants for cancer research.

1903
02:17:58,271 --> 02:17:59,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, job well done.

1904
02:17:59,674 --> 02:18:04,443
[SPEAKER_09]: I had no idea that they had collected all these travelers from around the world.

1905
02:18:05,754 --> 02:18:07,816
[SPEAKER_09]: I had no idea whatsoever that that was the case.

1906
02:18:07,856 --> 02:18:08,657
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you for sharing.

1907
02:18:09,377 --> 02:18:14,222
[SPEAKER_09]: I honestly thought it was like a group of like a college club or something that all was getting together to do it.

1908
02:18:14,362 --> 02:18:16,464
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's really cool.

1909
02:18:17,324 --> 02:18:18,265
[SPEAKER_09]: So props to you guys.

1910
02:18:20,067 --> 02:18:29,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you guys said, with all the bad press games have gotten due to recent events, it's really amazing that these people donated their vacation time and money to support this amazing cause.

1911
02:18:29,575 --> 02:18:45,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the more impressive runs were Final Fantasy IX done in 9 hours, Super Mario 64, all 120 stars done in under 2 hours by the world record holder Siglemic, Zelda Ocarina of Time done in 23 minutes using some game breaking bugs, and more.

1912
02:18:46,591 --> 02:18:56,041
[SPEAKER_09]: All the games were done in one sitting and it was amazing to watch all week, sometimes during work, and see how amazingly good and consistent people were at these games.

1913
02:18:56,362 --> 02:19:06,412
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't going to donate much originally, but after seeing how passionate these people were about the cause and the games, I eventually donated $80 over the week, though some people donated hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

1914
02:19:07,213 --> 02:19:08,393
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's really adorable.

1915
02:19:08,413 --> 02:19:08,994
[SPEAKER_09]: And it is sad.

1916
02:19:32,581 --> 02:19:33,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry for the long email, guys.

1917
02:19:34,143 --> 02:19:34,703
[SPEAKER_09]: You're forgiven.

1918
02:19:34,763 --> 02:19:35,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Good cause.

1919
02:19:35,664 --> 02:19:45,172
[SPEAKER_09]: And in case anyone is interested in watching the marathon videos, you can find them in the features section of speeddemosarchive.com Yours truly, AZHP.

1920
02:19:45,272 --> 02:19:48,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I hope it's an even bigger success for them next year.

1921
02:19:48,295 --> 02:19:49,956
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't realize they were bringing all these people in.

1922
02:19:49,977 --> 02:19:51,778
[SPEAKER_09]: They could do an expo out of this shit.

1923
02:19:51,898 --> 02:19:54,340
[SPEAKER_09]: A speedrun expo would be pretty awesome.

1924
02:19:54,380 --> 02:19:55,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it would be, actually.

1925
02:19:55,601 --> 02:19:58,404
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, bigger and better next time.

1926
02:19:59,997 --> 02:20:00,438
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.

1927
02:20:01,279 --> 02:20:01,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Good job, guys.

1928
02:20:02,681 --> 02:20:05,545
[SPEAKER_09]: If anybody from that effort is listening, a tip of the hat to you.

1929
02:20:07,088 --> 02:20:11,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Lastly, but not leastly, GamerGirl with an email.

1930
02:20:12,416 --> 02:20:13,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Or as she signed it, GG.

1931
02:20:14,699 --> 02:20:15,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Good game, GamerGirl.

1932
02:20:16,345 --> 02:20:20,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear OLR, I first would like to say that if I make any mistakes, i.e.

1933
02:20:20,166 --> 02:20:21,707
[SPEAKER_09]: grammatical errors, I apologize.

1934
02:20:22,087 --> 02:20:24,268
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys, as always, have an amazing show.

1935
02:20:24,548 --> 02:20:25,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep up the good work.

1936
02:20:25,568 --> 02:20:29,570
[SPEAKER_09]: I never thought my life would change so drastically with everyone's help.

1937
02:20:30,270 --> 02:20:37,313
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to thinking a lot about how everything good happened to me because of OLR, and it never ceases to amaze me how you guys are always helping everyone.

1938
02:20:37,833 --> 02:20:45,076
[SPEAKER_09]: As a matter of fact, as of January 19, 2013, your very own Dark Tetsuya and Gamer Girl are officially engaged.

1939
02:20:45,936 --> 02:20:46,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1940
02:20:47,258 --> 02:20:48,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations.

1941
02:20:49,480 --> 02:20:51,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Another OLR love story for the books, guys.

1942
02:20:51,903 --> 02:20:52,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Well done.

1943
02:20:52,804 --> 02:20:54,145
[SPEAKER_09]: As always, I enjoy the show.

1944
02:20:54,525 --> 02:20:58,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks again for introducing me to my best friend and soon-to-be life partner, Gamer Girl.

1945
02:21:00,011 --> 02:21:00,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1946
02:21:02,165 --> 02:21:03,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I happened to see that on Facebook earlier.

1947
02:21:04,087 --> 02:21:15,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, I mean, I know we got to say, yeah, I had heard of this before the email came in, but still, just to kind of hear, have it put in that perspective kind of way, like, you know, that they had met through OLR is really like, wow.

1948
02:21:18,539 --> 02:21:21,641
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been blown away with some of the emails and comments from beginning the past couple weeks.

1949
02:21:22,302 --> 02:21:24,504
[SPEAKER_09]: 2013 is the year you're trying to make me cry, y'all.

1950
02:21:25,984 --> 02:21:26,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, good job.

1951
02:21:26,885 --> 02:21:34,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Does this mean we have to send over... I don't know where they're getting married or whatever, if it's going to be here or... Because I think they have a distance right now between them.

1952
02:21:34,852 --> 02:21:38,295
[SPEAKER_09]: But I wonder if we need to send along a tape message or something.

1953
02:21:38,315 --> 02:21:39,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Or is that even appropriate?

1954
02:21:39,356 --> 02:21:39,696
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1955
02:21:41,037 --> 02:21:41,418
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1956
02:21:41,478 --> 02:21:43,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Get the speed run demo guys at your wedding reception.

1957
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:45,341
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how you do it.

1958
02:21:45,581 --> 02:21:46,062
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be great.

1959
02:21:47,983 --> 02:21:48,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Good job.

1960
02:21:49,685 --> 02:21:52,848
[SPEAKER_09]: A big congratulations and a perfect way to end the mailbag this week.

1961
02:21:52,888 --> 02:21:55,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1962
02:21:55,730 --> 02:21:56,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Wowzy, wowzy, wow.

1963
02:21:57,071 --> 02:21:58,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for doing the mailbox for me.

1964
02:21:58,893 --> 02:21:59,554
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

1965
02:21:59,974 --> 02:22:02,956
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're going to need to fend for yourself on this upcoming segment.

1966
02:22:04,037 --> 02:22:07,821
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to flip a 180, turn this car around and go from lovey-dovey stuff.

1967
02:22:07,841 --> 02:22:09,142
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to flip this bitch.

1968
02:22:09,222 --> 02:22:12,505
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to flip a bitch right now and get into the bitching.

1969
02:22:27,853 --> 02:22:32,978
[SPEAKER_05]: My FU goes to the old woman who was driving in front of me on my way here.

1970
02:22:35,380 --> 02:22:37,662
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how some people turn into the suicide lane?

1971
02:22:37,722 --> 02:22:38,843
[SPEAKER_05]: You know the turn lane in the middle?

1972
02:22:39,244 --> 02:22:42,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this woman doesn't even signal the moment this red truck starts pulling into it.

1973
02:22:42,687 --> 02:22:45,590
[SPEAKER_05]: We're on the inside lane heading toward here.

1974
02:22:46,050 --> 02:22:46,811
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1975
02:23:02,566 --> 02:23:04,688
[SPEAKER_05]: And she was just moving back and forth in between lanes.

1976
02:23:04,708 --> 02:23:06,769
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, I'm just going to use both lanes.

1977
02:23:06,809 --> 02:23:07,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck.

1978
02:23:07,609 --> 02:23:08,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm safer in the middle.

1979
02:23:09,551 --> 02:23:10,692
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, yeah.

1980
02:23:10,872 --> 02:23:13,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Another F you goes to me losing my voice.

1981
02:23:15,014 --> 02:23:19,017
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been fighting off getting sick, and I think I'm over it.

1982
02:23:19,137 --> 02:23:20,698
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just left me with a really sore throat.

1983
02:23:25,617 --> 02:23:29,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, DarkTetsuya and GamerGirl, guess what you have to look forward to?

1984
02:23:56,584 --> 02:23:56,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Grab!

1985
02:23:56,804 --> 02:23:56,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Grab!

1986
02:24:14,685 --> 02:24:17,027
[SPEAKER_05]: American Idol's on and this girl is good.

1987
02:24:17,207 --> 02:24:21,790
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, she is over the Nicki Minaj, Mariah thing.

1988
02:24:21,890 --> 02:24:22,751
[SPEAKER_09]: She's over that.

1989
02:24:22,851 --> 02:24:26,133
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I didn't even see that show.

1990
02:24:26,273 --> 02:24:29,435
[SPEAKER_07]: I had no idea because I don't watch cable anymore, even basic TV anymore.

1991
02:24:29,475 --> 02:24:31,717
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, I didn't even know.

1992
02:24:31,857 --> 02:24:33,818
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just crazy that I shouldn't.

1993
02:24:34,338 --> 02:24:35,319
[SPEAKER_09]: I see the billboards.

1994
02:24:35,679 --> 02:24:39,062
[SPEAKER_09]: But, well, in San Francisco, there was a huge one going over the Bay Bridge.

1995
02:24:39,202 --> 02:24:41,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so, I mean, that's fine.

1996
02:24:42,782 --> 02:24:44,684
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's see my FUs of the week.

1997
02:24:45,084 --> 02:24:53,471
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been getting, like, weird side pains again, and that always freaks me out because, you know, long-time listeners of the show remember, like, five years ago I was in the hospital because of some of that stuff.

1998
02:24:53,491 --> 02:24:55,653
[SPEAKER_09]: So, like, every time I get side pains, I get, like, really freaked out.

1999
02:24:55,673 --> 02:24:56,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, oh, my God, I'm sick again.

2000
02:24:56,814 --> 02:24:57,555
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's gas.

2001
02:24:58,215 --> 02:25:01,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, or, like, I'm just gaining weight or something, so...

2002
02:25:02,879 --> 02:25:05,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's to hoping it's fat, nothing else.

2003
02:25:05,800 --> 02:25:07,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Rob, avoid the Taco Bell.

2004
02:25:07,340 --> 02:25:07,540
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

2005
02:25:07,560 --> 02:25:09,340
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you get for eating Jack in the Box.

2006
02:25:09,800 --> 02:25:10,861
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't eat Jack in the Box.

2007
02:25:11,041 --> 02:25:12,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki talked about it.

2008
02:25:12,221 --> 02:25:14,701
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to eat Jack in the Box today.

2009
02:25:14,841 --> 02:25:16,782
[SPEAKER_07]: I really wanted to go there and be late.

2010
02:25:17,782 --> 02:25:20,862
[SPEAKER_09]: We went out for gay brunch as we usually do on Sundays.

2011
02:25:20,902 --> 02:25:22,763
[SPEAKER_09]: And I call it gay brunch because we eat brunch with other gays.

2012
02:25:23,483 --> 02:25:25,923
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wanted to eat healthy.

2013
02:25:26,403 --> 02:25:28,164
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry sir, we don't do salads until 11.30pm.

2014
02:25:30,339 --> 02:25:32,662
[SPEAKER_04]: LOL, it's time for red velvet pancakes.

2015
02:25:32,942 --> 02:25:34,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know, right?

2016
02:25:34,303 --> 02:25:40,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I got Hawaiian bread French toast, which is really good, don't get me wrong, but probably not the healthiest thing I could eat.

2017
02:25:41,311 --> 02:25:47,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas Alan's like, I was going to get the veggie omelette, but I decided I'd go a little dairy and get turkey.

2018
02:25:50,720 --> 02:26:05,918
[SPEAKER_05]: by the way, Alan has lost like a lot of weight I was about to say, Alan's doing really, really well you think I would like, you know, try to take some cues and do the same thing now you can be the like what's the old ass poem Jack Spratt and his wife laughs

2019
02:26:06,118 --> 02:26:07,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the thing.

2020
02:26:07,298 --> 02:26:09,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan's got the advantage on me where he walks to work and all that.

2021
02:26:10,039 --> 02:26:13,001
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've been very bad when it gets to motivated for exercise.

2022
02:26:13,021 --> 02:26:15,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I really need to really motivate myself to exercise.

2023
02:26:15,481 --> 02:26:17,062
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the only way I'm ever going to change things.

2024
02:26:17,402 --> 02:26:18,182
[SPEAKER_09]: And then snacking.

2025
02:26:18,382 --> 02:26:20,063
[SPEAKER_09]: I am a terrible, terrible snacker.

2026
02:26:20,523 --> 02:26:21,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Like that is my weakness.

2027
02:26:22,104 --> 02:26:23,884
[SPEAKER_09]: I really need to just get rid of every...

2028
02:26:25,405 --> 02:26:50,418
[SPEAKER_07]: like horrible snack out of this house and have nothing but carrots and celery in the fridge so I have no choice but then that's not fair on Fridays at our work they pop popcorn in a popcorn machine we have and I'm not talking about like a popcorn machine like an air popper I'm talking about a big fucking popcorn machine that they have the movie theaters popcorn machine they pop extra popcorn for me they gave me a bowl like a big ass bowl I eat more popcorn at that company than fucking people at the company other than me

2029
02:26:51,894 --> 02:26:52,234
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

2030
02:27:16,323 --> 02:27:17,324
[SPEAKER_09]: So here's the thing.

2031
02:27:18,224 --> 02:27:19,745
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't have that at Jack in the Box.

2032
02:27:19,845 --> 02:27:19,965
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

2033
02:27:20,065 --> 02:27:21,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Jack in the Box has deep fried tacos.

2034
02:27:21,966 --> 02:27:23,146
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what you get at Jack in the Box.

2035
02:27:24,107 --> 02:27:24,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Red Velvet Pancakes.

2036
02:27:24,807 --> 02:27:27,688
[SPEAKER_09]: We went to a brunch place once and they happened to have Red Velvet Pancakes.

2037
02:27:27,708 --> 02:27:28,769
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a place downtown, right?

2038
02:27:28,849 --> 02:27:29,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Ermagerd.

2039
02:27:30,110 --> 02:27:30,790
[SPEAKER_04]: That we went to.

2040
02:27:30,830 --> 02:27:31,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it Red Rabbit?

2041
02:27:31,970 --> 02:27:32,331
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

2042
02:27:32,391 --> 02:27:34,132
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to the pumpkin and you had Red Velvet.

2043
02:27:34,152 --> 02:27:34,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2044
02:27:35,452 --> 02:27:36,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Fucking amazing.

2045
02:27:37,133 --> 02:27:38,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I want pancakes now.

2046
02:27:38,794 --> 02:27:39,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

2047
02:27:39,537 --> 02:27:40,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Pancakes.

2048
02:27:40,619 --> 02:27:42,001
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, that's it for the FUs of the week.

2049
02:27:42,521 --> 02:27:46,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Skype lines soon, Twitter topics soon as well, but first, a couple more news stories.

2050
02:27:48,047 --> 02:27:48,347
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2051
02:27:49,128 --> 02:27:50,929
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's see here.

2052
02:27:51,029 --> 02:27:55,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk a little bit about the next generation of Kinect.

2053
02:27:55,092 --> 02:27:59,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, of course, we know that the next Xbox system is going to have Kinect.

2054
02:27:59,635 --> 02:28:02,156
[SPEAKER_07]: And we need to know what the hell it's going to be able to do.

2055
02:28:02,637 --> 02:28:04,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this may be kind of an idea.

2056
02:28:05,719 --> 02:28:14,505
[SPEAKER_07]: The company that was behind the Kinect sensor in the first place has this cool video that they put out kind of showing what it's going to do.

2057
02:28:18,487 --> 02:28:47,197
[SPEAKER_07]: everything that the original Kinect was supposed to do but didn't actually kind of do you know the whole closed thing they're saying that they're going to try to work this technology into pretty much everything into like you know non-display stuff to all the computers and it's just going to work it's going to have you know high speed tracking all that stuff and actually the little thing that they've got there the prototype looks exactly like the Kinect with some extra bullshit sticking out of the top I'm not really sure what the hell that is

2058
02:28:47,977 --> 02:28:52,320
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's in developers' hands right now, so they're going to be using this.

2059
02:28:52,800 --> 02:28:56,782
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's called Capri, the next generation of censors.

2060
02:28:59,863 --> 02:29:01,023
[SPEAKER_09]: The next generation.

2061
02:29:01,544 --> 02:29:01,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2062
02:29:01,944 --> 02:29:09,949
[SPEAKER_07]: They're saying it's supposed to have... They're going to be trying to fit it into everyday devices, and they're saying the same resolution as the Kinect.

2063
02:29:10,689 --> 02:29:12,350
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know.

2064
02:29:12,450 --> 02:29:13,151
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks pretty cool.

2065
02:29:14,151 --> 02:29:19,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the video... Watching the video reminded me a lot of just everything.

2066
02:29:19,494 --> 02:29:21,035
[SPEAKER_07]: They show this guy at a presentation.

2067
02:29:21,055 --> 02:29:21,135
[SPEAKER_07]: He's...

2068
02:29:24,232 --> 02:29:27,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Manipulating stuff on the screen as you would think you would be able to do.

2069
02:29:29,042 --> 02:29:29,724
[SPEAKER_07]: They're talking about...

2070
02:29:31,683 --> 02:29:36,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Even stuff to where, oh hey, I have someone coming over in facial recognition.

2071
02:29:36,485 --> 02:29:37,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's my friend.

2072
02:29:37,766 --> 02:29:39,166
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to unlock the door for him.

2073
02:29:39,807 --> 02:29:40,907
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he comes in and murders you.

2074
02:29:42,268 --> 02:29:47,690
[SPEAKER_07]: That's for switching channels on your TV by just kind of going, eh, moving my hand back and forth.

2075
02:29:48,391 --> 02:29:48,831
[SPEAKER_07]: That type of stuff.

2076
02:29:48,851 --> 02:29:50,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you know, pushing buttons on a remote is so hard.

2077
02:29:52,092 --> 02:29:53,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Move my hand back and forth.

2078
02:29:53,873 --> 02:29:56,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Swiping a fly away and your TV's going crazy.

2079
02:29:58,155 --> 02:30:00,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, one more news story for you guys.

2080
02:30:00,556 --> 02:30:06,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, this isn't gaming technically, but it is the voice of Geeks Network, you guys.

2081
02:30:06,078 --> 02:30:08,439
[SPEAKER_09]: So once in a while, we gotta blur the line a little bit.

2082
02:30:08,760 --> 02:30:18,304
[SPEAKER_09]: And this has to do with a musician who did make one of the greatest video game songs of the past 10 years still alive from Portal, right?

2083
02:30:20,805 --> 02:30:26,249
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm making a note here He is so nice in person

2084
02:30:36,275 --> 02:30:36,395
[SPEAKER_09]: L.A.

2085
02:30:36,455 --> 02:30:38,517
[SPEAKER_09]: faced with the Oakland booties

2086
02:31:07,890 --> 02:31:09,492
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard this, huh?

2087
02:31:09,753 --> 02:31:10,834
[SPEAKER_07]: I listened to it after.

2088
02:31:10,854 --> 02:31:15,840
[SPEAKER_07]: I only heard the lounge version by Lounge Against the Machine.

2089
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:16,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, right.

2090
02:31:17,362 --> 02:31:18,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Richard Cheese.

2091
02:31:18,784 --> 02:31:19,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

2092
02:31:19,264 --> 02:31:20,746
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, Sir Mix-A-Lot.

2093
02:31:20,946 --> 02:31:23,930
[SPEAKER_09]: So, technically, it is Sir Mix-A-Lot's song.

2094
02:31:24,070 --> 02:31:25,212
[SPEAKER_09]: And Joko did a cover.

2095
02:31:25,492 --> 02:31:27,653
[SPEAKER_07]: He did a cover, but it was a licensed cover.

2096
02:31:27,713 --> 02:31:31,256
[SPEAKER_07]: He licensed the rights to do that and he made his own original version.

2097
02:31:31,916 --> 02:31:34,298
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very unique and very different.

2098
02:31:34,318 --> 02:31:37,440
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like Johnny Cash's Hurt.

2099
02:31:37,460 --> 02:31:39,301
[SPEAKER_09]: The Nine Inch Nails version, amazing.

2100
02:31:39,601 --> 02:31:42,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny Cash's version, fucking amazing.

2101
02:31:43,043 --> 02:31:48,527
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard for me to say that because I love the Nine Inch Nails version so much, but they are both so fucking good, but very different.

2102
02:31:48,547 --> 02:31:53,370
[SPEAKER_05]: When Trent Reznor is saying that he likes it better, then you know you've got amazing.

2103
02:31:53,570 --> 02:31:54,551
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the problem.

2104
02:31:55,390 --> 02:31:56,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Glee, the TV show.

2105
02:31:56,971 --> 02:31:59,232
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they do a lot of covers and all that stuff.

2106
02:32:00,933 --> 02:32:07,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Here is the Glee version of Baby Got Back set to be on the Sadie Hawkins episode that will be on the 24th.

2107
02:32:08,197 --> 02:32:10,178
[SPEAKER_09]: This song was available in the U.S.

2108
02:32:10,298 --> 02:32:10,898
[SPEAKER_09]: iTunes store.

2109
02:32:11,038 --> 02:32:11,659
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pulled.

2110
02:32:11,739 --> 02:32:14,140
[SPEAKER_09]: It was still spotted on the Swedish iTunes store.

2111
02:32:14,200 --> 02:32:15,300
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yes, this is legit.

2112
02:32:15,661 --> 02:32:19,202
[SPEAKER_09]: See if you see any similarities here in the Glee version of Baby Got Back.

2113
02:32:21,404 --> 02:32:21,784
[SPEAKER_03]: L.A.

2114
02:32:21,844 --> 02:32:23,765
[SPEAKER_03]: face with the Oakland Moonies

2115
02:32:31,474 --> 02:32:33,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I heard that before somewhere.

2116
02:32:42,992 --> 02:32:48,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, it's one thing to cover the song, especially when you're going to do it like the original.

2117
02:32:50,115 --> 02:32:57,498
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I need to play the original version of Baby Got Back, but I'll do the Rob Roberts cover of Baby Got Back.

2118
02:32:57,538 --> 02:32:57,919
[SPEAKER_09]: You ready?

2119
02:32:58,819 --> 02:33:00,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God.

2120
02:33:00,420 --> 02:33:02,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Becky, look at her butt.

2121
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:03,261
[SPEAKER_09]: It is so big.

2122
02:33:03,321 --> 02:33:03,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, look.

2123
02:33:03,881 --> 02:33:05,882
[SPEAKER_09]: So obviously the original was very, very different, right?

2124
02:33:05,922 --> 02:33:07,043
[SPEAKER_09]: And had the whole beat to it.

2125
02:33:08,283 --> 02:33:13,266
[SPEAKER_09]: So, for Glee to just totally rip this off the way they did is kind of shitty.

2126
02:33:13,726 --> 02:33:15,107
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really shitty.

2127
02:33:15,167 --> 02:33:18,129
[SPEAKER_09]: To think that nobody would notice is crazy.

2128
02:33:18,469 --> 02:33:23,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, just so you know, Joko, what is making the internet rally around him is that he posted to his Twitter

2129
02:33:24,884 --> 02:33:25,625
[SPEAKER_09]: I had no idea.

2130
02:33:26,426 --> 02:33:27,146
[SPEAKER_09]: He had no clue.

2131
02:33:27,246 --> 02:33:28,367
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's like, WTF?

2132
02:33:28,708 --> 02:33:32,111
[SPEAKER_09]: And he is trying to see what kind of legal action is available at this point, but it's complicated.

2133
02:33:32,211 --> 02:33:36,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it wasn't really his song in the first place, although it was his arrangement.

2134
02:33:36,995 --> 02:33:37,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the best part.

2135
02:33:37,956 --> 02:33:39,117
[SPEAKER_09]: You might be getting to this, Loki.

2136
02:33:39,718 --> 02:33:47,025
[SPEAKER_09]: In the lyrics, if I were to play the full thing, a part where he changed the lyrics from Sir Mix-a-Lot to Johnny C...

2137
02:33:48,366 --> 02:33:52,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Glee sings in their version, Johnny C. So you know damn well where they got it.

2138
02:33:53,510 --> 02:33:54,631
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no mystery.

2139
02:33:55,192 --> 02:33:56,913
[SPEAKER_07]: They removed one of them at the end.

2140
02:33:57,514 --> 02:34:00,556
[SPEAKER_07]: The 1-900, you know, what was it?

2141
02:34:01,557 --> 02:34:05,000
[SPEAKER_07]: He did something else, 1-900 something, and then he changed it.

2142
02:34:06,341 --> 02:34:06,561
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

2143
02:34:08,953 --> 02:34:09,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, man.

2144
02:34:09,574 --> 02:34:12,556
[SPEAKER_07]: That is just blatant.

2145
02:34:14,098 --> 02:34:16,840
[SPEAKER_07]: And even he said they stole the arrangement.

2146
02:34:17,160 --> 02:34:24,407
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually duck sounds or something in the background that he sampled or something that are in that song in exactly the same spot.

2147
02:34:24,447 --> 02:34:26,869
[SPEAKER_07]: They stole the instrumental and just sang over it.

2148
02:34:30,272 --> 02:34:30,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah.

2149
02:34:32,228 --> 02:34:34,509
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, I don't know what's going to happen from here.

2150
02:34:34,649 --> 02:34:37,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think legally he could do anything about it?

2151
02:34:37,190 --> 02:34:37,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he can.

2152
02:34:37,670 --> 02:34:38,330
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he can.

2153
02:34:38,811 --> 02:34:40,731
[SPEAKER_09]: If they actually stole the lyrics or whatever?

2154
02:34:40,751 --> 02:34:41,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because it's his arrangement.

2155
02:34:42,172 --> 02:34:43,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that he definitely has a case.

2156
02:34:46,013 --> 02:34:51,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, gee, the folks in the chat rooms really seem to be enjoying the Rob Roberts cover of Baby Got Back.

2157
02:34:51,236 --> 02:34:53,857
[SPEAKER_09]: So, big butts and I cannot lie.

2158
02:34:54,177 --> 02:34:55,737
[SPEAKER_09]: You other brothers can't deny.

2159
02:34:56,618 --> 02:34:57,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, forget it.

2160
02:35:00,663 --> 02:35:01,444
[SPEAKER_09]: The original's awesome.

2161
02:35:01,504 --> 02:35:03,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, Alan is like, please stop.

2162
02:35:03,546 --> 02:35:04,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Please don't.

2163
02:35:04,867 --> 02:35:05,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Knock it off.

2164
02:35:05,287 --> 02:35:07,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but Alan, you weren't here watching Rob shake his ass.

2165
02:35:10,111 --> 02:35:11,633
[SPEAKER_09]: I like Ross Steel UT's comment.

2166
02:35:11,953 --> 02:35:13,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, that's some Milli Vanilli shit.

2167
02:35:15,357 --> 02:35:18,078
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to, there's a little bit of a clap that I heard in the beginning.

2168
02:35:18,118 --> 02:35:24,960
[SPEAKER_07]: I want them to do the vanilla ice defense where it's like, but see mine went, you know, the original went boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

2169
02:35:25,060 --> 02:35:28,121
[SPEAKER_06]: But mine went boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

2170
02:35:28,761 --> 02:35:30,221
[SPEAKER_07]: You see it's different, right?

2171
02:35:30,441 --> 02:35:30,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally.

2172
02:35:31,761 --> 02:35:32,542
[SPEAKER_07]: It's totally different.

2173
02:35:33,202 --> 02:35:35,122
[SPEAKER_07]: We added the psh in there.

2174
02:35:35,202 --> 02:35:35,903
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes it different.

2175
02:35:36,023 --> 02:35:37,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was so under pressure.

2176
02:35:37,914 --> 02:35:40,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma in the chat says, wait, hold it, Glee is still relevant?

2177
02:35:40,697 --> 02:35:44,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, but it's sinking in the ratings, but I heard they're going to renew it.

2178
02:35:44,420 --> 02:35:51,866
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to know, okay, because it's supposed to be this new guy that's coming to the school or whatever that's hitting on the clearly gay guy on the show.

2179
02:35:52,327 --> 02:35:58,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't it a little awkward to be singing a song about I like big butts and about all these things about butts that you like and stuff?

2180
02:35:58,612 --> 02:36:00,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it seems a little weird.

2181
02:36:01,174 --> 02:36:03,176
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't know.

2182
02:36:04,648 --> 02:36:05,990
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a weird song anyway.

2183
02:36:06,030 --> 02:36:08,973
[SPEAKER_09]: It's weird because no one over 12 watches Glee in the first place.

2184
02:36:09,273 --> 02:36:14,600
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, the people that watch Glee or whatever, do they really know what Baby Got Back is?

2185
02:36:14,660 --> 02:36:18,244
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, a lot of the kids were probably not even born when that song came out.

2186
02:36:21,371 --> 02:36:21,731
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2187
02:36:22,312 --> 02:36:23,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it that old?

2188
02:36:23,932 --> 02:36:26,334
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wish Glee would get cancelled.

2189
02:36:26,454 --> 02:36:27,074
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I wish.

2190
02:36:28,555 --> 02:36:28,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2191
02:36:31,136 --> 02:36:32,177
[SPEAKER_09]: That does it for news tonight.

2192
02:36:32,217 --> 02:36:33,037
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the last story.

2193
02:36:35,178 --> 02:36:38,920
[SPEAKER_09]: 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2194
02:36:38,960 --> 02:36:42,442
[SPEAKER_09]: The Skype line is open right now if you want to give us a call.

2195
02:36:43,022 --> 02:36:44,864
[SPEAKER_09]: and while we wait for some calls to come in.

2196
02:36:45,004 --> 02:36:47,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it is already lighting up on the phone.

2197
02:36:47,486 --> 02:36:50,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to the phones and say hello to whoever's on the line.

2198
02:36:50,869 --> 02:36:51,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.

2199
02:36:51,990 --> 02:36:52,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2200
02:36:53,431 --> 02:36:53,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

2201
02:36:55,173 --> 02:36:56,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that Bobby Blackwolf?

2202
02:36:56,894 --> 02:36:57,515
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Bobby.

2203
02:36:57,815 --> 02:36:58,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Bobby.

2204
02:36:58,696 --> 02:36:59,837
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't sound so good, Bobby.

2205
02:36:59,857 --> 02:37:02,920
[SPEAKER_09]: You sound like a sad panda or I should say a sad little birdie.

2206
02:37:03,100 --> 02:37:04,101
[SPEAKER_09]: What's wrong, Bobby?

2207
02:37:04,661 --> 02:37:05,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Sports ball.

2208
02:37:06,223 --> 02:37:08,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, did you have a rough day at work?

2209
02:37:10,647 --> 02:37:12,128
[SPEAKER_10]: I need a cheer up.

2210
02:37:12,148 --> 02:37:13,569
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there any new games coming out?

2211
02:37:13,629 --> 02:37:14,470
[SPEAKER_10]: I need a diversion.

2212
02:37:14,830 --> 02:37:15,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Not really.

2213
02:37:15,370 --> 02:37:17,051
[SPEAKER_09]: There's Ni No Kuni.

2214
02:37:17,111 --> 02:37:19,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Ni No Kuni's coming out this week, Poppy.

2215
02:37:21,754 --> 02:37:22,815
[SPEAKER_09]: You could try the demo.

2216
02:37:22,835 --> 02:37:26,437
[SPEAKER_11]: You could try your face.

2217
02:37:27,799 --> 02:37:28,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, wait.

2218
02:37:28,359 --> 02:37:30,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby, that's a response after my own heart.

2219
02:37:30,140 --> 02:37:31,941
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the Jamie defense right there.

2220
02:37:32,181 --> 02:37:35,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Bobby, it's just a game, Bobby.

2221
02:37:36,663 --> 02:37:39,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Here, I got something to help you out, okay?

2222
02:37:39,424 --> 02:37:46,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go back to a time when your team was winning things, which I don't know if that actually exists, but we'll make believe.

2223
02:37:47,188 --> 02:37:48,049
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2224
02:38:13,170 --> 02:38:14,973
[SPEAKER_09]: It kind of had a 2020 vibe to me.

2225
02:38:14,993 --> 02:38:19,678
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I mean, how many legit gamer news shows do you see on TV now?

2226
02:38:19,798 --> 02:38:20,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a lot.

2227
02:38:21,280 --> 02:38:22,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, exactly.

2228
02:38:22,802 --> 02:38:27,368
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was a clip from the Philly Classic Game Expo, right?

2229
02:38:27,924 --> 02:38:42,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, it was from 2004, in I think March of 2004, and it was the Philly Classic Gaming Expo, and I was actually a co-organizer of it, along with a couple other people, one of which was another moderator on the forums over at G4.

2230
02:38:43,735 --> 02:38:44,255
[SPEAKER_11]: And we had...

2231
02:38:45,336 --> 02:38:54,381
[SPEAKER_11]: All converged on Philly Classic 4 the year before, and we kind of had a table, and it was kind of a G4 forum meetup and stuff, and we had about 15 people.

2232
02:38:55,182 --> 02:38:57,743
[SPEAKER_11]: And for Philly Classic 5, it was like 50 people.

2233
02:38:57,803 --> 02:39:00,285
[SPEAKER_11]: It was kind of like our PAX 08 experience.

2234
02:39:00,705 --> 02:39:02,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, oh man, I love PAX 08.

2235
02:39:02,126 --> 02:39:03,987
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was basically the G4 version of it.

2236
02:39:04,187 --> 02:39:04,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

2237
02:39:04,968 --> 02:39:08,330
[SPEAKER_11]: And what a lot of people in the OR audience...

2238
02:39:09,289 --> 02:39:16,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Latched on to was the fact that when I was on it, beardless, because this was before the beard, there was a little bit of Bimani behind me.

2239
02:39:17,731 --> 02:39:21,532
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was actually my setup at the show.

2240
02:39:21,792 --> 02:39:24,472
[SPEAKER_11]: So as much as I rag on Bimani now, it wasn't dead then.

2241
02:39:25,573 --> 02:39:28,193
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Seventh Style had just come out, maybe.

2242
02:39:29,273 --> 02:39:30,654
[SPEAKER_11]: It was right around that time.

2243
02:39:30,954 --> 02:39:31,674
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not dead yet.

2244
02:39:32,563 --> 02:40:00,225
[SPEAKER_11]: and this was before Guitar Hero so I'm like you know these are classics instant classics that's what I'll call it and he wanted you know kind of some Ruddy Gore, Mark Wolf who's in the video he kind of wanted some other like different type of stuff so I'm like fine I'll bring my stuff all my import consoles and everything and I brought my stereo system and they provided the TV and I had I would run that weekend I think I ran Beatmania 2DX I had Para Para Paradise which we played once

2245
02:40:01,745 --> 02:40:09,448
[SPEAKER_11]: I had Taiko no Tetsujin and I had Donkey Kong.

2246
02:40:09,468 --> 02:40:10,328
[SPEAKER_11]: I had both versions.

2247
02:40:12,849 --> 02:40:16,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Tommy Tallarico was the first time he had ever played it.

2248
02:40:17,151 --> 02:40:21,733
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the pictures I posted up on Twitter was actually Tommy Tallarico playing Taiko no Tetsujin for the first time.

2249
02:40:23,090 --> 02:40:25,592
[SPEAKER_11]: and so because he was there, he was one of the guests there.

2250
02:40:25,632 --> 02:40:34,319
[SPEAKER_11]: They actually had at Philly Classic 5, they had, no, I think it was Philly Classic 4, they actually had, and I can't remember her name, but the woman from Tron.

2251
02:40:35,940 --> 02:40:36,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Olivia Wilde?

2252
02:40:37,041 --> 02:40:37,942
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, no, no.

2253
02:40:38,002 --> 02:40:38,882
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, the original Tron.

2254
02:40:39,103 --> 02:40:41,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Wendy, they did the music, right?

2255
02:40:42,465 --> 02:40:46,108
[SPEAKER_11]: No, the actual, the woman who played the love interest.

2256
02:40:46,809 --> 02:40:47,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

2257
02:40:48,231 --> 02:40:50,833
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's the only thing she's ever done that anybody remembers.

2258
02:40:51,453 --> 02:40:53,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there was a movement to bring her back for the new movie.

2259
02:40:53,635 --> 02:40:54,075
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't work.

2260
02:40:54,695 --> 02:40:58,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but that's where I met Sid Meier.

2261
02:40:58,698 --> 02:40:59,979
[SPEAKER_11]: He showed up there.

2262
02:41:00,019 --> 02:41:03,181
[SPEAKER_11]: And in Philly Classic 5, they had Howard Scott Warshaw, who made E.T.

2263
02:41:03,201 --> 02:41:03,982
[SPEAKER_11]: and all that stuff.

2264
02:41:04,542 --> 02:41:07,684
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was a lot of fun, and I exposed a lot of people to that.

2265
02:41:07,704 --> 02:41:09,726
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I also would run Guitaroman and Rez.

2266
02:41:10,868 --> 02:41:11,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Music Game

2267
02:41:29,940 --> 02:41:31,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Other people had the DDR stuff.

2268
02:41:31,361 --> 02:41:32,602
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, I don't do the DDR.

2269
02:41:32,642 --> 02:41:33,723
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm doing all the other stuff.

2270
02:41:33,763 --> 02:41:34,244
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

2271
02:41:34,344 --> 02:41:35,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Trying to bring the other stuff to light.

2272
02:41:35,785 --> 02:41:42,392
[SPEAKER_09]: If you like DDR, then you might like... I mean, it's not running anymore, though, right?

2273
02:41:42,752 --> 02:41:43,413
[SPEAKER_09]: It folded.

2274
02:41:43,513 --> 02:41:45,194
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm sure business reasons or whatever.

2275
02:41:45,234 --> 02:41:45,855
[SPEAKER_11]: They wanted to.

2276
02:41:45,935 --> 02:41:53,782
[SPEAKER_11]: We had big plans for Philly Classic 6, but unfortunately, the people that were up in Philadelphia that ran it, there was a little bit of drama.

2277
02:41:55,244 --> 02:42:20,378
[SPEAKER_11]: essentially the short version that I kind of remember is that they had kind of passed the keys on to another guy who completely changed the show and he changed it to something else and it folded after like two or three years so they had trusted somebody else with it and he's like yeah the classic games are kind of cool and stuff but we're going to expand and he thought really really big and then it kind of it petered out

2278
02:42:22,841 --> 02:42:23,742
[SPEAKER_09]: That sucks.

2279
02:42:24,022 --> 02:42:26,325
[SPEAKER_09]: You should definitely check out someday.

2280
02:42:26,465 --> 02:42:33,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it involves traveling to California, but California Extreme is an awesome classic game show with all the old school arcade machines and stuff.

2281
02:42:33,874 --> 02:42:35,016
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the kind of thing I think of.

2282
02:42:35,379 --> 02:42:39,361
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really, really lots of fun.

2283
02:42:39,381 --> 02:42:46,046
[SPEAKER_11]: There was one of the local arcade distributors that still worked in arcades with a lot of the classic systems.

2284
02:42:46,626 --> 02:42:52,670
[SPEAKER_11]: They were on the East Coast somewhere, but they brought 50 arcade machines all set to free play to this show.

2285
02:42:53,430 --> 02:42:59,554
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, what we did is, leading up to my little rhythm game thing, they had the gaming experience through time.

2286
02:43:00,114 --> 02:43:10,756
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was just, you could go up and go to these consoles and it would like, they started at like, you know, the Magnavox Odyssey and then an Atari 2600 all going up to Xbox, PlayStation 2 and stuff.

2287
02:43:10,776 --> 02:43:16,258
[SPEAKER_11]: So you could actually go down the line and see, you know, the next console in time.

2288
02:43:16,378 --> 02:43:17,798
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like an interactive timeline.

2289
02:43:18,138 --> 02:43:18,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2290
02:43:18,598 --> 02:43:18,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

2291
02:43:19,378 --> 02:43:22,339
[SPEAKER_11]: So we did stuff like that and it was a lot of fun.

2292
02:43:22,867 --> 02:43:26,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Many folks in chat saying we should have a VOGCon.

2293
02:43:26,189 --> 02:43:28,691
[SPEAKER_09]: We could have a VOGCon someday.

2294
02:43:28,731 --> 02:43:30,292
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not outside the realm of possibility.

2295
02:43:30,612 --> 02:43:35,616
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Brad from PodCulture, why don't you have VOGCon in Atlanta the day before DragonCon?

2296
02:43:36,336 --> 02:43:38,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, why don't we just have it at DragonCon?

2297
02:43:38,478 --> 02:43:39,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably the smartest idea.

2298
02:43:40,099 --> 02:43:48,264
[SPEAKER_09]: I think certainly there should be, whether it's official or unofficial, a VOG event at DragonCon is certainly within the realm of possibility for this year.

2299
02:43:48,304 --> 02:43:51,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, I've said we're going to have an official event.

2300
02:43:51,707 --> 02:43:51,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

2301
02:43:52,347 --> 02:43:53,908
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty much been confirmed to me.

2302
02:43:53,968 --> 02:43:56,950
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, obviously, I won't know for certain until, like, next month.

2303
02:43:57,170 --> 02:43:57,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

2304
02:43:57,871 --> 02:44:04,195
[SPEAKER_11]: But, no, we've already got, like, an official panel, which means we'll be in the program and all that stuff.

2305
02:44:04,835 --> 02:44:14,441
[SPEAKER_11]: But then other events, I mean, there's a huge gaming area, like tabletop gaming area downstairs, and we could easily, like, commandeer, like, a corner of that one night.

2306
02:44:14,761 --> 02:44:15,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

2307
02:44:15,482 --> 02:44:16,022
[SPEAKER_11]: For just us.

2308
02:44:16,282 --> 02:44:21,566
[SPEAKER_09]: So it sounds like if you want to meet as many VOG people as possible, Atlanta's going to be the place to be Labor Day weekend.

2309
02:44:21,846 --> 02:44:22,326
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

2310
02:44:22,627 --> 02:44:23,147
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

2311
02:44:23,167 --> 02:44:23,868
[SPEAKER_11]: You should do it.

2312
02:44:24,608 --> 02:44:26,330
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't be as depressed about sports ball.

2313
02:44:26,530 --> 02:44:26,890
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?

2314
02:44:27,411 --> 02:44:28,832
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't be as depressed about sports ball.

2315
02:44:28,872 --> 02:44:30,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it'll all be over by then.

2316
02:44:30,393 --> 02:44:32,555
[SPEAKER_09]: If the Niners lose in a couple weeks, will it make you feel better?

2317
02:44:33,716 --> 02:44:37,078
[SPEAKER_11]: No, see, I want them to win now because that means we lost to the champions.

2318
02:44:37,379 --> 02:44:38,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, that's a good way of thinking about it.

2319
02:44:39,200 --> 02:44:46,026
[SPEAKER_11]: And here's the thing that made it worse, the sports ball thing worse, is because of the whole video game industry tie-in on my Twitter.

2320
02:44:46,966 --> 02:44:51,310
[SPEAKER_11]: The majority of the video game industry, especially the PR context, guess where they live?

2321
02:44:51,510 --> 02:44:52,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, the Bay Area.

2322
02:44:52,711 --> 02:44:53,151
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that.

2323
02:44:54,151 --> 02:44:56,953
[SPEAKER_11]: So I did not check my personal Twitter all day.

2324
02:44:57,013 --> 02:44:58,093
[SPEAKER_11]: I just could not take it.

2325
02:44:58,133 --> 02:44:58,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Couldn't handle it.

2326
02:44:59,214 --> 02:45:04,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I think the saddest picture you posted was the confetti cannon behind you guys, and you just put unused.

2327
02:45:05,557 --> 02:45:06,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it was right there.

2328
02:45:06,998 --> 02:45:10,479
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually took another picture of just my drum next to it, and everybody else had left.

2329
02:45:11,160 --> 02:45:13,781
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just my drum next to the confetti cannon, but yeah, they...

2330
02:45:17,394 --> 02:45:18,054
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry about that.

2331
02:45:18,074 --> 02:45:20,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, there's always next year.

2332
02:45:20,696 --> 02:45:21,057
[SPEAKER_09]: There is.

2333
02:45:21,897 --> 02:45:23,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Bobby, focus on the positive.

2334
02:45:24,019 --> 02:45:27,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of good things coming with VOG and all that in the future.

2335
02:45:27,762 --> 02:45:31,325
[SPEAKER_09]: You did not have a show this week, sadly, but tell the folks where they can catch you next week.

2336
02:45:32,546 --> 02:45:33,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Right here on VOG.

2337
02:45:34,448 --> 02:45:35,569
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm the opening act.

2338
02:45:36,528 --> 02:45:38,409
[SPEAKER_11]: and I will be live next week.

2339
02:45:38,529 --> 02:45:41,191
[SPEAKER_11]: I will not be live the following week because of sports ball.

2340
02:45:41,971 --> 02:45:49,435
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was the other bad thing because I go to a party because it's the time I see a lot of my friends and so I never do a show on the big super sports ball day.

2341
02:45:49,995 --> 02:45:59,120
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was the first couple messages I got from my friends instead of saying, oh man, sorry and all that stuff and yeah, it was a closed game, blah, blah, blah.

2342
02:45:59,360 --> 02:45:59,861
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they were like,

2343
02:46:00,501 --> 02:46:04,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, this means you're coming to our Super Bowl party and bringing your pizza dip.

2344
02:46:04,383 --> 02:46:05,223
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm like, guys!

2345
02:46:05,444 --> 02:46:09,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you have actually had to fly to wherever they're having the Super Bowl this year?

2346
02:46:10,166 --> 02:46:12,367
[SPEAKER_11]: The plan was we were going to go to New Orleans.

2347
02:46:12,827 --> 02:46:18,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if we couldn't get into the game, we were going to do corporate events around New Orleans, maybe play in some of the bars.

2348
02:46:19,311 --> 02:46:23,993
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd march the tailgates outside of the Superdome, and then we'd go to a bar and watch the game at a bar.

2349
02:46:24,213 --> 02:46:25,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell me more about this pizza dip.

2350
02:46:28,644 --> 02:46:29,765
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a trade secret.

2351
02:46:51,227 --> 02:46:56,935
[SPEAKER_09]: and I also was given a tip that it is the best day to go to a theme park near here.

2352
02:46:57,035 --> 02:46:59,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Not Disneyland but one of the other ones, Magic Mountain.

2353
02:46:59,299 --> 02:47:00,901
[SPEAKER_09]: So I may go to Magic Mountain.

2354
02:47:02,028 --> 02:47:02,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we'll see.

2355
02:47:03,949 --> 02:47:05,770
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yep.

2356
02:47:05,810 --> 02:47:06,610
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys cheered me up.

2357
02:47:06,650 --> 02:47:07,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you guys.

2358
02:47:07,491 --> 02:47:07,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Aw, thank you.

2359
02:47:08,031 --> 02:47:08,711
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad we could.

2360
02:47:08,912 --> 02:47:12,994
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm glad we get to have you at the end of our show because you're always kind enough to have us on every week.

2361
02:47:13,014 --> 02:47:16,315
[SPEAKER_07]: I also cheered you up by beating all your scores on Forza Horizon.

2362
02:47:16,475 --> 02:47:16,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop it.

2363
02:47:18,837 --> 02:47:19,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, go kick his ass.

2364
02:47:20,317 --> 02:47:21,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

2365
02:47:21,818 --> 02:47:22,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Making hearts in your direction.

2366
02:47:23,739 --> 02:47:24,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Aw, thank you.

2367
02:47:26,401 --> 02:47:27,702
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel bad for your team.

2368
02:47:28,962 --> 02:47:32,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, you got DarkSakura kind of to care about football.

2369
02:47:32,545 --> 02:47:34,146
[SPEAKER_09]: That should make you feel better than anything else.

2370
02:47:34,606 --> 02:47:35,887
[SPEAKER_11]: And see, I would have gotten a ring.

2371
02:47:37,568 --> 02:47:40,349
[SPEAKER_11]: If we had gone in two weeks and won, I would have gotten a ring.

2372
02:47:41,770 --> 02:47:43,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know what?

2373
02:47:43,832 --> 02:47:45,032
[SPEAKER_09]: There's always next year.

2374
02:47:45,473 --> 02:47:48,314
[SPEAKER_09]: At DragonCon, I'll get you some onion rings.

2375
02:47:48,434 --> 02:47:49,035
[SPEAKER_09]: How's that sound?

2376
02:47:49,915 --> 02:47:50,576
[SPEAKER_11]: From the varsity.

2377
02:47:51,678 --> 02:47:53,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Locals will understand that.

2378
02:47:53,141 --> 02:47:56,787
[SPEAKER_07]: They should launch the puppy out of the cannon for a puppy bowl.

2379
02:47:57,288 --> 02:47:57,569
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

2380
02:47:57,689 --> 02:47:58,590
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm letting you go, Bobby.

2381
02:47:58,630 --> 02:47:59,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care.

2382
02:47:59,873 --> 02:48:00,874
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe a ferret instead.

2383
02:48:00,894 --> 02:48:01,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye!

2384
02:48:04,997 --> 02:48:07,680
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

2385
02:48:07,720 --> 02:48:10,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby was a little bit longer than we usually have the calls, but he's Bobby.

2386
02:48:10,422 --> 02:48:10,863
[SPEAKER_09]: He can do that.

2387
02:48:12,584 --> 02:48:15,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, also we got Twitter topics coming in.

2388
02:48:15,387 --> 02:48:20,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter.com slash OLR and we can read some of those topics here.

2389
02:48:23,574 --> 02:48:24,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

2390
02:48:25,076 --> 02:48:26,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no, we got more calls coming in.

2391
02:48:26,437 --> 02:48:26,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Never mind.

2392
02:48:27,077 --> 02:48:27,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's take the calls instead.

2393
02:48:28,439 --> 02:48:29,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2394
02:48:29,359 --> 02:48:29,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2395
02:48:32,276 --> 02:48:35,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, it's Codeman from the Down for Maintenance podcast.

2396
02:48:36,120 --> 02:48:38,282
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing, Codeman from the Down for Maintenance podcast?

2397
02:48:38,903 --> 02:48:39,704
[SPEAKER_09]: How you guys doing?

2398
02:48:40,304 --> 02:48:41,205
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, alright.

2399
02:48:41,305 --> 02:48:43,728
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess there was some big football news today, but you know.

2400
02:48:44,088 --> 02:48:44,949
[SPEAKER_04]: I like your picture.

2401
02:48:45,049 --> 02:48:45,870
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very army.

2402
02:48:46,851 --> 02:48:47,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's my tattoo.

2403
02:48:49,354 --> 02:48:50,355
[SPEAKER_09]: What does your tattoo say?

2404
02:48:50,515 --> 02:48:52,537
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you didn't call in to talk about that, but I'm asking anyway.

2405
02:48:54,138 --> 02:48:57,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever our souls are made of, hers and mine are the same.

2406
02:48:57,919 --> 02:48:58,660
[SPEAKER_08]: It's for me and my wife.

2407
02:48:58,980 --> 02:48:59,100
Aww.

2408
02:48:59,120 --> 02:49:01,521
[SPEAKER_08]: That's adorable.

2409
02:49:01,881 --> 02:49:02,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.

2410
02:49:02,362 --> 02:49:02,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Geez.

2411
02:49:03,062 --> 02:49:06,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, after the Bobby call and then now this little awe, I kind of feel down.

2412
02:49:07,484 --> 02:49:08,144
[SPEAKER_08]: But that was good.

2413
02:49:08,224 --> 02:49:08,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2414
02:49:08,685 --> 02:49:09,225
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.

2415
02:49:09,265 --> 02:49:11,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we cheered Bobby up, so now you cheer us up.

2416
02:49:11,746 --> 02:49:12,987
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

2417
02:49:14,228 --> 02:49:18,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, that call kind of made me think of, you know, I live in Oklahoma.

2418
02:49:18,491 --> 02:49:25,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Our team, our sports ball team, our college team didn't do very well this year either.

2419
02:49:25,877 --> 02:49:29,940
[SPEAKER_08]: But we usually do, you know, pretty well.

2420
02:49:30,180 --> 02:49:34,984
[SPEAKER_08]: We just didn't show up to any of the games mentally, I guess you would say.

2421
02:49:35,864 --> 02:49:36,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Look on the bright side.

2422
02:49:36,725 --> 02:49:38,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Your college team, at least their girlfriends are real.

2423
02:49:39,787 --> 02:49:40,088
[SPEAKER_08]: True.

2424
02:49:40,248 --> 02:49:41,108
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go, right?

2425
02:49:41,128 --> 02:49:41,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2426
02:49:44,123 --> 02:49:46,104
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I just wanted to call and say hi to you guys.

2427
02:49:48,805 --> 02:49:51,526
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually getting a chance to call you guys.

2428
02:49:51,906 --> 02:49:55,608
[SPEAKER_08]: The baby is asleep and I'm actually getting a chance to call in.

2429
02:49:55,668 --> 02:49:57,428
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm excited about that.

2430
02:49:57,728 --> 02:50:02,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'll bring this up because I'm looking through the Twitter topics for tonight and I noticed you sent us a tweet.

2431
02:50:03,351 --> 02:50:04,751
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have to show this to people in studio.

2432
02:50:04,791 --> 02:50:06,932
[SPEAKER_09]: You tweeted, me with a power glove.

2433
02:50:08,472 --> 02:50:09,093
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so bad.

2434
02:50:09,133 --> 02:50:11,414
[SPEAKER_09]: You actually tweeted us a picture of yourself.

2435
02:50:11,474 --> 02:50:12,654
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm showing the others in the studio there.

2436
02:50:12,974 --> 02:50:15,075
[SPEAKER_09]: A picture of you holding the power glove.

2437
02:50:15,315 --> 02:50:17,696
[SPEAKER_09]: And I like this little artsy pose you're doing with it too.

2438
02:50:17,936 --> 02:50:20,817
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very like... I really like your scarf.

2439
02:50:21,237 --> 02:50:22,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2440
02:50:22,698 --> 02:50:23,678
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got a scarf.

2441
02:50:24,559 --> 02:50:26,860
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very hipster, but not in a douchebag way.

2442
02:50:27,120 --> 02:50:28,800
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it.

2443
02:50:28,960 --> 02:50:32,622
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a very drunken night.

2444
02:50:32,662 --> 02:50:33,722
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like to talk about it.

2445
02:50:33,922 --> 02:50:34,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see.

2446
02:50:34,863 --> 02:50:35,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2447
02:50:36,365 --> 02:50:37,026
[SPEAKER_08]: and I'll see you next time.

2448
02:50:52,726 --> 02:50:56,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they call it a Power Glove for a reason, so... Obviously, yeah.

2449
02:50:57,169 --> 02:51:09,217
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I listen to you guys' show, and I just... Just, you know, like John on our podcast, he's from California as well, and it just makes me just so sad.

2450
02:51:09,578 --> 02:51:15,582
[SPEAKER_08]: All the stuff that you guys can do in California, and I can't do here in Oklahoma, and it makes me... It just makes me sad.

2451
02:51:15,602 --> 02:51:15,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2452
02:51:16,615 --> 02:51:18,137
[SPEAKER_05]: However, you have Waffle House, right?

2453
02:51:18,898 --> 02:51:24,983
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have Waffle House, although you don't really want to go in there most of the time because some of the plates are a little dirty.

2454
02:51:25,144 --> 02:51:29,428
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have Waffle House, and you should be glad for that fact because we don't have Waffle House and we never will.

2455
02:51:29,568 --> 02:51:36,034
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was going to say, Oklahoma at least has Dunkin' Donuts, and we're not getting those until apparently 2015 is announced this week.

2456
02:51:36,174 --> 02:51:38,636
[SPEAKER_09]: At least we're finally going to get them in SoCal.

2457
02:51:38,796 --> 02:51:39,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss Waffle House, Rob.

2458
02:51:40,518 --> 02:51:41,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

2459
02:51:41,399 --> 02:51:42,060
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that good.

2460
02:51:42,080 --> 02:51:42,981
[SPEAKER_05]: No, yes it is.

2461
02:51:43,522 --> 02:51:45,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I want my chocolate chip pancakes extra crispy, please.

2462
02:51:46,004 --> 02:51:46,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2463
02:51:46,545 --> 02:51:47,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are good.

2464
02:51:47,386 --> 02:51:48,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are very good.

2465
02:51:48,067 --> 02:51:48,868
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you wowing?

2466
02:51:48,888 --> 02:51:50,549
[SPEAKER_09]: The fact that we don't have Dunkin' Donuts here?

2467
02:51:51,090 --> 02:51:51,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2468
02:51:51,851 --> 02:51:53,373
[SPEAKER_09]: I figured you probably would.

2469
02:51:53,653 --> 02:51:53,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

2470
02:51:54,214 --> 02:51:54,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

2471
02:51:54,574 --> 02:51:54,814
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the...

2472
02:51:55,555 --> 02:52:00,036
[SPEAKER_09]: It is like the number one thing when I tell people on the East Coast, like, you know, because I'll go out to visit.

2473
02:52:00,056 --> 02:52:02,177
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll go to like New York or even when I was at PAX.

2474
02:52:02,477 --> 02:52:04,797
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, fuck, yes, we've got to go to Dunkin' Donuts.

2475
02:52:04,857 --> 02:52:06,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God, I haven't had Dunkin' Donuts in forever.

2476
02:52:06,318 --> 02:52:06,778
[SPEAKER_09]: We got to go.

2477
02:52:06,838 --> 02:52:08,778
[SPEAKER_09]: And like my friends are like, the fuck?

2478
02:52:09,078 --> 02:52:09,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, really?

2479
02:52:10,199 --> 02:52:11,139
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, no, you don't understand.

2480
02:52:11,179 --> 02:52:11,759
[SPEAKER_09]: I live in California.

2481
02:52:11,779 --> 02:52:12,579
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have Dunkin' Donuts.

2482
02:52:12,599 --> 02:52:14,520
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're like, where the fuck do you get donuts?

2483
02:52:14,940 --> 02:52:17,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I made Tiara drive me to Dunkin' Donuts in Las Vegas.

2484
02:52:17,600 --> 02:52:18,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm like, they don't.

2485
02:52:19,061 --> 02:52:23,002
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Ma and Pop stores or if you can find a Krispy Kreme that didn't go under.

2486
02:52:23,202 --> 02:52:23,542
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

2487
02:52:24,843 --> 02:52:27,365
[SPEAKER_08]: I did grow up with Krispy Kreme.

2488
02:52:27,405 --> 02:52:29,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Krispy Kreme is few and far between in Oklahoma.

2489
02:52:30,067 --> 02:52:35,012
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a couple of them around where I live, but they're pretty hard to find.

2490
02:52:35,252 --> 02:52:37,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Krispy Kreme in Alabama is like Starbucks.

2491
02:52:39,013 --> 02:52:39,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's what we have here.

2492
02:52:40,034 --> 02:52:41,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Starbucks everywhere.

2493
02:52:43,316 --> 02:52:43,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Krispy Kreme.

2494
02:52:44,177 --> 02:52:50,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, trying to bring it back to video games a little bit, I know you have been playing a little more Forza Horizon lately as well.

2495
02:52:50,262 --> 02:52:52,764
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that's something you were talking about on Down for Maintenance.

2496
02:52:52,844 --> 02:52:54,305
[SPEAKER_09]: So what are your thoughts on Forza?

2497
02:52:54,986 --> 02:52:56,547
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it.

2498
02:52:57,368 --> 02:53:03,853
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason why I love it, and I've mentioned this on my podcast, is that, you know, I think the last...

2499
02:53:04,752 --> 02:53:05,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my dryer just went off.

2500
02:53:07,513 --> 02:53:14,916
[SPEAKER_08]: The last racing game I played was Cruising USA and Bowling Alley Arcade.

2501
02:53:15,497 --> 02:53:20,038
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, I don't know, it kind of brings me back to that kind of racing.

2502
02:53:20,579 --> 02:53:22,960
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very arcade-y, and I like that about it.

2503
02:53:23,120 --> 02:53:26,321
[SPEAKER_08]: And the fact that you can race against...

2504
02:53:26,601 --> 02:53:27,282
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2505
02:53:48,897 --> 02:53:53,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're going to try to set a date and time for either this week or next, and we'll tweet about it.

2506
02:53:53,359 --> 02:53:58,001
[SPEAKER_09]: We need everybody possible to come join in on the fun, so look out for that, including Loki.

2507
02:53:59,121 --> 02:53:59,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2508
02:53:59,802 --> 02:54:01,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Loki, he's all over it.

2509
02:54:01,763 --> 02:54:04,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, he's been on that thing like white on rice, man.

2510
02:54:04,204 --> 02:54:04,724
[SPEAKER_08]: It's crazy.

2511
02:54:05,004 --> 02:54:05,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

2512
02:54:05,804 --> 02:54:06,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

2513
02:54:06,605 --> 02:54:08,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of took a break, though, to make more details.

2514
02:54:08,966 --> 02:54:14,508
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I'm making a, spoiler, a sticker for the back of my car that says, How am I driving?

2515
02:54:14,528 --> 02:54:14,988
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-RLR.

2516
02:54:15,008 --> 02:54:15,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesus.

2517
02:54:18,226 --> 02:54:19,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice advertisement.

2518
02:54:19,867 --> 02:54:21,787
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all over the car.

2519
02:54:21,927 --> 02:54:23,508
[SPEAKER_09]: You are so dumb, but I love it.

2520
02:54:23,608 --> 02:54:23,868
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2521
02:54:24,588 --> 02:54:30,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Codeman, tell the folks how they can tune into your podcast, which you do Google Hangouts and stuff now too, right?

2522
02:54:31,350 --> 02:54:31,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2523
02:54:31,830 --> 02:54:32,830
[SPEAKER_09]: You're playing with your format?

2524
02:54:32,870 --> 02:54:34,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to switch to video or what?

2525
02:54:35,311 --> 02:54:38,654
[SPEAKER_08]: We kind of do it back and forth every once in a while.

2526
02:54:38,674 --> 02:54:41,616
[SPEAKER_08]: We just kind of dabble in audio and video.

2527
02:54:41,677 --> 02:54:47,461
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, you can find us on YouTube at youtube.com backslash the DFM podcast.

2528
02:54:47,481 --> 02:54:50,584
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can follow us on Twitter at the DFM podcast.

2529
02:54:51,405 --> 02:54:56,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Then, of course, you can find us on iTunes at the DFM podcast.

2530
02:55:01,113 --> 02:55:02,534
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, we should be on there.

2531
02:55:02,554 --> 02:55:08,399
[SPEAKER_08]: We're on our eighth episode, actually the next episode, which you, DarkSakura, are going to guest on.

2532
02:55:08,680 --> 02:55:08,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2533
02:55:10,281 --> 02:55:13,344
[SPEAKER_08]: If you remember, I haven't sent you a reminder, so I don't know.

2534
02:55:14,113 --> 02:55:16,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I put it on my phone, so I've got everything.

2535
02:55:16,894 --> 02:55:18,454
[SPEAKER_05]: I have an alarm going off.

2536
02:55:18,854 --> 02:55:19,974
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where you've got to be, is in the phone.

2537
02:55:20,034 --> 02:55:23,635
[SPEAKER_08]: I've made no plans for that day.

2538
02:55:23,915 --> 02:55:34,097
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to get all three of you guys on all at once, but I knew that with all kinds of different time schedules and stuff like that, I probably couldn't manage that.

2539
02:55:35,157 --> 02:55:37,397
[SPEAKER_08]: We will have all three of you on now, so that's awesome.

2540
02:55:37,997 --> 02:55:40,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you very much for having us on and expertly plugged.

2541
02:55:40,938 --> 02:55:42,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Appreciate it, and best of luck with your show.

2542
02:55:42,930 --> 02:55:43,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, Rob.

2543
02:56:05,794 --> 02:56:06,595
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2544
02:56:34,951 --> 02:56:35,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

2545
02:56:35,792 --> 02:56:37,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Something he saw at MagFest.

2546
02:56:37,613 --> 02:56:41,895
[SPEAKER_09]: An original Atari 2600 game with the classic cartridge, box, and manual.

2547
02:56:42,475 --> 02:56:44,096
[SPEAKER_09]: CGE Adventures.

2548
02:56:44,396 --> 02:56:47,738
[SPEAKER_09]: It is amazing how people are still making stuff for the Atari 2600 even today.

2549
02:56:48,879 --> 02:56:54,182
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get all kinds of repros of stuff that were prototypes.

2550
02:56:54,522 --> 02:56:55,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Repro prototypes.

2551
02:56:55,122 --> 02:56:56,203
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how we have a Millipede for $5,200.

2552
02:56:57,470 --> 02:57:06,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Even some of those flashback consoles had some of the design challenge winners.

2553
02:57:06,933 --> 02:57:13,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Funny enough, I remember Bobby earlier was talking about Howard Scott Warshaw at the Expo in Philly.

2554
02:57:14,115 --> 02:57:18,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Saboteur, his last game, I think was one of those games that showed up in a flashback console at some point.

2555
02:57:19,377 --> 02:57:20,117
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of interesting.

2556
02:57:20,397 --> 02:57:21,478
[SPEAKER_09]: You do still see those show up.

2557
02:57:23,278 --> 02:57:24,158
[SPEAKER_09]: in one place or another.

2558
02:57:24,198 --> 02:57:27,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2559
02:57:28,040 --> 02:57:29,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiger Claw sending us some tweets.

2560
02:57:29,760 --> 02:57:33,442
[SPEAKER_09]: More League of Legends players banned for toxic behavior.

2561
02:57:35,302 --> 02:57:39,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, League of Legends is not going to put up with that shit anymore where people are harassing other people.

2562
02:57:41,265 --> 02:57:46,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Banned two prominent esports players for their toxic behavior in-game.

2563
02:57:47,267 --> 02:57:50,828
[SPEAKER_09]: The peak harassment score placed the account among the worst players

2564
02:57:52,089 --> 02:57:54,331
[SPEAKER_09]: 0.06 of all European accounts this month.

2565
02:57:54,391 --> 02:57:55,792
[SPEAKER_09]: That was InVision's account.

2566
02:57:56,152 --> 02:57:57,073
[SPEAKER_09]: He was banned.

2567
02:57:57,674 --> 02:57:58,274
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

2568
02:57:58,874 --> 02:57:59,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Good for them.

2569
02:58:01,136 --> 02:58:03,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Be accountable for your attitude in games.

2570
02:58:03,358 --> 02:58:05,120
[SPEAKER_09]: People want to be so anonymous.

2571
02:58:05,220 --> 02:58:09,163
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been doing a lot of PvP and WoW this week, and I'll talk about this on Horde House, plug, plug, later.

2572
02:58:09,643 --> 02:58:14,067
[SPEAKER_09]: But just some toxic fucking attitudes in these games that ruin it for everybody.

2573
02:58:14,887 --> 02:58:20,432
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm really glad to hear that League of Legends is taking some drastic moves to eliminate that shit.

2574
02:58:22,378 --> 02:58:29,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Also a tweet from Tiger Claw saying, games destigmatize violence, says a Connecticut governor.

2575
02:58:29,840 --> 02:58:31,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's probably all that needs to be said about that.

2576
02:58:31,521 --> 02:58:34,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Another politician putting their big ass foot in the conversation.

2577
02:58:37,203 --> 02:58:47,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Lastly here, RawSteelUT, in light of how the media readily brought Manti Teo's dead girlfriend story, have any of you been fooled by fake stories?

2578
02:58:48,046 --> 02:58:49,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm sure we have here on OLR.

2579
02:58:49,867 --> 02:58:51,048
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it happens.

2580
02:58:51,089 --> 02:58:53,732
[SPEAKER_09]: There'll be an article that spreads like wildfire.

2581
02:58:54,232 --> 02:58:56,295
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't like to think we're breaking the news.

2582
02:58:56,735 --> 02:59:00,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Once in a while, we get a little tip, but we try not to make a big deal out of it.

2583
02:59:00,520 --> 02:59:03,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes we talk about a game called Disney Infinity.

2584
02:59:04,024 --> 02:59:07,007
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a hidden secret for our listeners, and that's the way we want it to be.

2585
02:59:07,888 --> 02:59:08,829
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

2586
02:59:28,228 --> 02:59:38,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I'm sure back in the day when we were all younger, I'm sure some of us fell for the old EGM magazine pranks like that Shang Long was actually a character in Street Fighter.

2587
02:59:38,551 --> 02:59:38,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

2588
02:59:38,851 --> 02:59:40,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Ermac was actually in Mortal Kombat.

2589
02:59:40,892 --> 02:59:41,052
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2590
02:59:41,152 --> 02:59:41,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sure.

2591
02:59:41,612 --> 02:59:42,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Say that now.

2592
02:59:43,038 --> 02:59:47,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I also worked in an arcade for a while, too, and could actually check some of these machines myself.

2593
02:59:48,160 --> 02:59:52,622
[SPEAKER_09]: So you knew at that age how to go into the chips and actually look in the programming?

2594
02:59:52,962 --> 02:59:53,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, I totally knew that.

2595
02:59:54,043 --> 02:59:58,845
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Rob, what I knew is that usually on April 1st, there are going to be pranks done.

2596
02:59:59,085 --> 03:00:00,906
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe a damn thing on April 1st.

2597
03:00:00,926 --> 03:00:01,967
[SPEAKER_09]: They were in magazines.

2598
03:00:02,007 --> 03:00:02,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Or in April editions.

2599
03:00:03,047 --> 03:00:04,027
[SPEAKER_09]: And we were younger.

2600
03:00:04,168 --> 03:00:05,768
[SPEAKER_09]: But they were the April editions.

2601
03:00:05,888 --> 03:00:07,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but Rob, I'm special.

2602
03:00:07,549 --> 03:00:08,529
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are no fun at all.

2603
03:00:08,550 --> 03:00:09,430
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm special.

2604
03:00:10,862 --> 03:00:12,143
[SPEAKER_09]: No fun zone, everybody.

2605
03:00:12,163 --> 03:00:13,124
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why nobody's calling in.

2606
03:00:13,164 --> 03:00:14,125
[SPEAKER_09]: They know it's a no fun zone.

2607
03:00:14,685 --> 03:00:15,026
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2608
03:00:16,307 --> 03:00:17,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Last minute stories, Loki.

2609
03:00:17,948 --> 03:00:18,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything?

2610
03:00:18,729 --> 03:00:25,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Blockbuster UK has closed 160 of its stores because they're in administration right now.

2611
03:00:26,396 --> 03:00:31,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of a repeat of what they did over here in the U.S.

2612
03:00:33,562 --> 03:00:35,924
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a pretty cool THQ sale going on right now on Amazon.

2613
03:00:36,084 --> 03:00:36,645
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get a...

2614
03:00:37,445 --> 03:00:39,165
[SPEAKER_07]: A bunch of games for $25.

2615
03:00:39,625 --> 03:00:40,086
[SPEAKER_07]: 19 games.

2616
03:00:40,886 --> 03:00:45,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of which you probably have by now through the Humble Bundle or all the other Amazon sales that they've done.

2617
03:00:46,027 --> 03:00:47,227
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I have a lot of these games.

2618
03:00:47,927 --> 03:00:50,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I think I have all these games right now.

2619
03:00:51,688 --> 03:00:52,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Except for Nexuiz.

2620
03:00:52,748 --> 03:00:55,288
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have Nexuiz, but I'm not buying this for that.

2621
03:00:56,369 --> 03:00:58,149
[SPEAKER_07]: MX versus ATV Reflex, I don't have that either.

2622
03:01:00,049 --> 03:01:04,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Um... Sigh.

2623
03:01:05,461 --> 03:01:07,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Starbreeze Storm That is it.

2624
03:01:25,987 --> 03:01:26,508
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

2625
03:01:27,048 --> 03:01:32,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess that's going to do it for OLR tonight.

2626
03:01:32,694 --> 03:01:33,655
[SPEAKER_09]: No more calls coming in.

2627
03:01:34,036 --> 03:01:34,576
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

2628
03:01:35,217 --> 03:01:37,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody's too depressed about football.

2629
03:01:37,479 --> 03:01:37,860
[SPEAKER_09]: I get it.

2630
03:01:37,960 --> 03:01:38,320
[SPEAKER_09]: It's cool.

2631
03:01:38,500 --> 03:01:44,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and the killer is dead is pretty awesome looking, which I mentioned about a year ago.

2632
03:01:45,987 --> 03:01:55,490
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's the new Suda51 game and it kind of has that whole Killer7 vibe to it where it's all kind of cel-shaded and stuff but very bloody.

2633
03:01:55,710 --> 03:02:00,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, you know, with some of the games that they did after Killer7, you know, it was kind of toned down.

2634
03:02:00,871 --> 03:02:05,433
[SPEAKER_07]: They had the whole No More Heroes had kind of money spewing out of them instead of blood.

2635
03:02:05,873 --> 03:02:06,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is definitely blood.

2636
03:02:07,053 --> 03:02:09,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of blood and a guy with a big drill on his arm.

2637
03:02:10,954 --> 03:02:11,874
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds like my kind of game.

2638
03:02:12,114 --> 03:02:13,015
[SPEAKER_07]: He's Mr. Driller now.

2639
03:02:13,515 --> 03:02:14,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Driller.

2640
03:02:16,129 --> 03:02:18,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, that brings us to a close.

2641
03:02:18,190 --> 03:02:23,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Another episode of Orange Lounge Radio, but not until we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2642
03:02:24,255 --> 03:02:27,717
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, of course, we always like to say thank you for downloading and checking out our show.

2643
03:02:28,418 --> 03:02:29,278
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a free show.

2644
03:02:29,819 --> 03:02:37,004
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't played a commercial for the same game 20 weeks in a row to try and, you know, we just, we pay a little bit out of pocket because it's our hobby, whatever.

2645
03:02:37,524 --> 03:02:40,286
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, I've got to say, I do want to tip my hat

2646
03:02:40,726 --> 03:02:45,670
[SPEAKER_09]: People have been very kind in a pay it forward kind of way where like, you know, we've just had some nice things donated.

2647
03:02:45,690 --> 03:02:49,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Brad from PodCulture, all these mics you see were donated.

2648
03:02:49,434 --> 03:02:54,398
[SPEAKER_09]: And we do get, you know, like Grandpa from Horde House gave a lot of money to VOG on our 10th anniversary.

2649
03:02:54,678 --> 03:02:55,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Helped Kristen years ago.

2650
03:02:56,720 --> 03:02:57,621
[SPEAKER_09]: It helped out a big way.

2651
03:02:57,801 --> 03:02:59,883
[SPEAKER_04]: The soundboard, that's how we got to Pat.

2652
03:03:00,103 --> 03:03:15,454
[SPEAKER_09]: so you know pay it forward is kind of the motto here not to you know bring up a cheesy movie from years ago but if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio just spread the word tell a friend or two about the show and help us spread the word about the show and that's all we ask thank you to everyone who bought me games

2653
03:03:15,765 --> 03:03:17,466
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you to everybody who listened tonight.

2654
03:03:17,846 --> 03:03:21,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether it be live or on the podcast, you guys rock.

2655
03:03:21,428 --> 03:03:22,749
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you, Greg Proops.

2656
03:03:24,070 --> 03:03:26,371
[SPEAKER_07]: And I still have Steam games to give away at some point.

2657
03:03:26,971 --> 03:03:29,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I just haven't figured out how to do that yet.

2658
03:03:30,493 --> 03:03:33,055
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, somewhere buried over there, I think I see it.

2659
03:03:33,875 --> 03:03:36,237
[SPEAKER_07]: We still have the Migaran album to give away for something.

2660
03:03:36,277 --> 03:03:38,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we need to just do like a big closeout around here.

2661
03:03:38,874 --> 03:03:41,595
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

2662
03:03:41,975 --> 03:03:43,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, you shut off the iPad.

2663
03:03:43,616 --> 03:03:44,096
[SPEAKER_09]: You're good to go.

2664
03:03:44,116 --> 03:03:45,156
[SPEAKER_09]: What's your final thought tonight?

2665
03:03:45,256 --> 03:03:46,817
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to do a show on an iPad.

2666
03:03:48,818 --> 03:03:49,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, your final thought tonight?

2667
03:03:50,899 --> 03:03:53,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a new CD of music to listen to.

2668
03:03:53,219 --> 03:04:02,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for all the inspiration, I guess, Dubstep Arena channel on Forza Horizon.

2669
03:04:03,924 --> 03:04:05,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Although most of it's not really Dubstep.

2670
03:04:05,904 --> 03:04:06,945
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just Electronica.
