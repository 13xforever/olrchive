00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,800
DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki Tonight, January 20th, 2013, the final Rainfall

2
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,180
game is set to come to the U.S. Sony plans to make a big sale, and Disney Infinity is

3
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:31,740
finally officially unveiled.

4
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,960
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,220
where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:45,720
It is Orange Lounge Radio with episode 490 of our show for this January the 20th of 2013.

7
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,980
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next several hours to talk about

8
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:54,780
video games and the gamer lifestyle along with those of you in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

9
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,980
and the all important co-hosts here on the show.

10
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,340
First off, say hello to Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,700
I'm not in the kitchen.

12
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,220
What are you doing out of the kitchen?

13
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,220
Hosting a show.

14
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,220
No wait, no.

15
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,220
Hold on.

16
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,220
Put the angry emails down.

17
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,220
This is not a sexist joke.

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,220
She was actually in the kitchen making coffee.

19
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,220
Making coffee.

20
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,220
Now I have- That's what she wanted.

21
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,540
Chocolate mint creamer to go with my chocolate mint coffee.

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,540
All right.

23
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,540
There you go.

24
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,540
Minty.

25
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,540
Minty fresh.

26
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,540
Just like tonight's show?

27
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,540
I don't know.

28
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,100
Minty fresh.

29
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,100
Tech master Loki.

30
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,100
Hi.

31
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,100
Remember when fresh was a compliment?

32
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,100
Yes.

33
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,100
I remember the 90s.

34
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,260
Like funky fresh or I always think of crescent fresh from Siffle and Ollie which was an underrated

35
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,260
TV show.

36
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,260
Siffle and Ollie?

37
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,260
No.

38
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,260
Siffle and Ollie.

39
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,260
Not Siffle-less dark soccer.

40
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,420
I wonder how their rebirth- Be quiet when you're in the kitchen.

41
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,060
I wonder how their rebirth is doing.

42
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,420
I say that because she doesn't have a mind.

43
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,620
Because I remember like, hey, Siffle and Ollie are coming back.

44
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,620
They're doing game reviews.

45
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,620
Oh yeah.

46
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,260
I forgot after the first episode.

47
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,260
Yeah.

48
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,260
Exactly.

49
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,260
The first episode was funny though.

50
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,660
See, I think maybe that's the type of thing you're just going to have to marathon during

51
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,660
a weekend.

52
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,620
Like, you know, some people marathon what?

53
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,300
Game of Thrones or what else?

54
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,260
What are the other big TV shows people watch?

55
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,580
True Blood.

56
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,540
If you're Jamie, Supernatural and only Jamie.

57
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,540
Okay.

58
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,540
Doctor Who.

59
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,540
That's when a lot of people marathon.

60
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,180
Once Upon a Time, my friends, which okay.

61
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,180
Matt Cross.

62
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,140
Actually, we did.

63
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,020
We did actually have an anime night at my house kind of.

64
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,460
We watched Matt Cross Do You Remember Love, but then we watched the live action Rurouni

65
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,460
Kenshin movie and it was Amazeballs.

66
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,460
Oh yeah.

67
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,460
You invited me to come over and watch that.

68
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,460
Yeah, but you said no.

69
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,020
Well, we got stuck doing something else.

70
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,020
Yeah.

71
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,020
But Alan was working.

72
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,020
The Rurouni Kenshin movie was Amazeballs.

73
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,020
Was it?

74
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,020
Yeah.

75
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,020
Good times.

76
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,020
All right.

77
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,460
Well, again, we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock

78
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,360
Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network.

79
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,020
That is vognetwork.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

80
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,220
And if you want to participate live with our show, join us.

81
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,820
We have a live chat room, so if you do happen to be tuned in live tonight, make sure you're

82
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,260
in the chat room to get the full experience, live.vognetwork.com.

83
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,480
And it is possible to chat and multitask and do other things.

84
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,620
We don't take offense.

85
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,840
If you want to listen to the show, chat and play, I don't know, World of Warcraft or whatever

86
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,840
computer game, Civ 5, whatever.

87
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,900
But if you're watching sports ball, I'll shoot you.

88
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,900
Stop it.

89
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,900
That's disrespectful.

90
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,900
With a rubber band.

91
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,900
That's disrespectful.

92
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,900
With a rubber band.

93
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,980
Speaking of sports ball, there was no Bobby Black Wolf tonight because there was some

94
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,500
big sports ball games going on.

95
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:26,020
Ironically enough, our quote unquote local team, the San Francisco 49ers, even though

96
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,340
they're a hundred miles away, it's the closest NFL team we have, playing his Atlanta Falcons

97
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,720
and the Niners won.

98
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,260
So I think they're all drowning their sorrows in beer right now.

99
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,780
Dan calls them the 40 whiners.

100
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,180
Why is that?

101
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,180
I don't know.

102
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,540
I hate sports ball.

103
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:47,020
Well, when I first came into chat tonight, some of the chatters at live.vognetwork.com

104
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,020
were like, oh, Rob's team defeats Bobby's team.

105
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,020
And oh my gosh.

106
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,020
I'm like, wait, wait, wait.

107
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,020
No, no, no, no, no.

108
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,020
Let's be clear.

109
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,780
Just because the 49ers are local does not make them my team.

110
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,420
First off, I'm not really big on football.

111
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,100
I'm not going to sit here and say, you suck if you like football, because I don't believe

112
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,100
that.

113
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,260
Everybody's got their things that they're into.

114
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,500
It's just more socially acceptable to be into football.

115
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Let's be real.

116
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,660
When I make posts about like, oh, I'm so excited.

117
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,520
Such and such got evicted from Big Brother.

118
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,300
Everybody looks at me like weirdo.

119
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,300
You damn weirdo.

120
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,620
What's wrong with you?

121
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,980
Well, or gaming.

122
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,100
I want to talk about esports in a minute.

123
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,520
Acid Vampire made me cry.

124
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:27,180
But just to be clear, just to be clear, if I have a team, it is the Minnesota Vikings.

125
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,300
And that's because of Chris Cluey.

126
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,300
Let's Chris Cluey.

127
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,300
Why?

128
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,300
Who?

129
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,300
Chris Cluey.

130
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,180
He is the guy that wrote, he plays World of Warcraft for one.

131
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,060
He's an NFL player that plays World of Warcraft for one, which makes him awesome.

132
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,220
And two, he's the guy that wrote that, you know, profanity laced letter about the whole

133
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,220
gay marriage thing.

134
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,540
And like basically say you're an idiot if you don't support it.

135
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,540
It's cool.

136
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,540
Yeah.

137
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,420
So, you know, I don't use this term very often, but like, he's like a bro.

138
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,780
You know, Johnny apparently is spanking off to the show.

139
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,780
What?

140
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,780
What?

141
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,340
Says, I can multitask with the show, watch Californication, laugh at jokes, bleeping

142
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,700
off and listen to the show.

143
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,820
He means nodding off because he doesn't want to offend us, not sodding off.

144
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,820
All right.

145
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,820
La la la la la.

146
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,740
Anyhow, that, uh, little gem from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, what were you

147
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,660
saying about a city vampire earlier, making you cry in chat?

148
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,660
What was that about?

149
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,660
He said the Firefly was overrated.

150
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,060
So I said his butt was overrated.

151
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,260
That's okay because, um, Brad, Brad from pod culture is taking care of it for me.

152
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,260
Yes.

153
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,660
You also can get mature responses like such in our chat room from a host nonetheless.

154
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,980
Live.vognetwork.com again, Jamie, you said your butt is overrated.

155
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,980
Is that what you said?

156
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:46,020
But I say the same thing to my husband, except I tell him like, he'll be like, well, this,

157
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,020
this song's kind of weird.

158
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,860
It's like, well, your face is kind of weird, which just earns me a look.

159
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,860
All right.

160
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,860
So pun intended.

161
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,980
The kickoff topic I wanted to talk about tonight was ports.

162
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,980
Hold on.

163
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,980
All right.

164
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,260
Don't sit there and be all like, I met you.

165
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,260
Your pun.

166
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,260
Oh, okay.

167
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,500
I am going to punish you.

168
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,740
I thought you were, you were going on your tirade about football again.

169
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,740
I'm like, no, I don't care.

170
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,740
People like sports ball.

171
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:17,980
If they want this, the Stanley goal, you know, if they want the, the, the, I don't know,

172
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,220
the Uber league cup, they they're welcome to it.

173
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,700
Well, how often have we talked about video games ought to be a sport and that topic comes

174
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,700
up once in a while.

175
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,700
I don't know.

176
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,700
I don't know how people truly feel about that.

177
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,020
Like I say, like we all say it, but maybe we don't like, you know, and I think about

178
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:38,540
e-sports and that whole thing and it's still, e-sports still feels very like, I don't want

179
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,740
to say underground because I do see it getting more and more visibility, but let's be real.

180
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:49,340
They don't exactly televise star craft matches on NBC prime time or whatever.

181
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,660
We're not really at that level yet, but you know, thanks to the internet and the internet

182
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,940
is in many ways killing traditional broadcast mechanisms, right?

183
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:03,380
I mean, ratings for once powerhouse TV shows like American idol or way down.

184
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,020
And I think we have the internet today for a lot of that because, uh, you know, people

185
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,340
watch their Netflix or people watch the things that they want to see.

186
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,300
And some people prefer to watch these e-sports things and we've seen, you know, the online

187
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,820
streaming solutions like Ustream, Justin TV, or excuse me, it's Twitch TV or whatever,

188
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,820
all that stuff, uh, you know, is, is popular for the people who want to see it.

189
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,100
Um, you know, you log into a site like Twitch that actually shows you like, this is the

190
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,420
game that's being broadcast most of all.

191
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:34,380
Do you guys know what game is broadcast more than any other on Twitch TV?

192
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,020
The puppy bowl.

193
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,860
I wish, seriously though, do you know what video game is broadcast more than any other

194
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,860
on Twitch TV?

195
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,860
Star craft?

196
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,860
No.

197
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,860
World of Warcraft?

198
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,540
No, that, that world of Warcraft is number two.

199
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,700
And usually when it's world of Warcraft, it's PVP, at least in my experience.

200
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,780
I see way more PVP arena people doing that than anything else.

201
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,420
League of Legends is the game that I see stream more than anything else on Twitch TV.

202
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,020
So I just, you know, and that's a, that is, that game is built to be very competitive

203
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,420
and that whole, like, um, what do they call it?

204
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:12,660
The MOBA style games, which funny tangent, I actually downloaded League of Legends finally

205
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,860
this weekend.

206
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,100
I didn't get far enough.

207
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,900
I played the little tutorial and then it got into picking a character and dah, dah, dah.

208
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,460
And like, I literally had somewhere else to be, so I kind of stopped, but I am going

209
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,460
to try.

210
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,460
I have a long weekend.

211
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,300
Let's do a lot of people, uh, this weekend from work.

212
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,260
So I'm going to try and play a little more tomorrow because everybody always talks about

213
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,260
League of Legends and it is free.

214
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,140
So you know, why not?

215
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,460
And I also have dota too.

216
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,700
So it's like those MOBA games are becoming more and more.

217
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,100
Do we have any chatters that are really into that stuff?

218
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:45,580
Just out of curiosity, live.vognetwork.com, uh, Mako in our chat room says, what would

219
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,580
be Mico?

220
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:53,620
Mico says, watch today's Intel extreme masters finals was damn fantastic.

221
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,540
I admit to being a sad man.

222
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,380
Well, why is that sad?

223
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,780
Is that really any different than the people that all gathered around and watched the football

224
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,780
game?

225
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,620
And I'm not calling either one sad.

226
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,900
You're into whatever you're into.

227
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,540
I'm calling all of it sad.

228
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,540
I'm kidding.

229
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,540
Yeah.

230
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,980
And then you're going to go home and watch Supernatural.

231
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,460
So you know, I'm actually way behind on Supernatural to be honest.

232
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,460
No judgment here.

233
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,660
None at all.

234
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,060
And then you'll, then you'll post about it on Tumblr.

235
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:24,140
Uh, I did however, finish Sherlock, a city vampire in our chair and says, sports will

236
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:29,420
be more entertaining if the athletes were naked back in the day, the gladiator gladiator

237
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,660
arenas back in the day.

238
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:37,140
You know, I think the dangly bits are hilarious, so I'd just be busy laughing.

239
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,180
I don't even know how to respond to that.

240
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,340
Um, Rob can't even, oh, you know what, if you want to watch naked athletes, watch a

241
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:50,060
wrestling, that would be your sport then, because let's be real in what other, there's

242
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,340
only two sports I can think of where it's socially acceptable to run around in a speedo

243
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,540
the whole time.

244
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,900
One of them involves a swimming pool.

245
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,760
The other one is wrestling.

246
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,760
Think about it.

247
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:10,300
Um, also in our chat room at live.vogna, which wrestlers wear cups, uh, SGA 100 Matt says

248
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,860
league of legends and Korean star craft matches are broadcasted a lot.

249
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,860
That's right.

250
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:19,060
I wonder, what do you think it is about those types of games specifically that really draw

251
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,360
people in?

252
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,020
Why don't you see a lot of competitive music based games?

253
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,980
I hardly ever see a lot of like competitions online about that.

254
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:33,020
What is it about those games that you think really draws people into esports and watching

255
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,020
all that online?

256
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:40,500
Do you think it's because they're just designed to be that way?

257
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Any thoughts?

258
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,780
I really honestly don't know what the appeal is.

259
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:49,060
I mean, truly, I don't know what the appeal is and I can't even fathom what the appeal

260
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,060
is.

261
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,580
Well, to be fair, you haven't played it.

262
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:56,860
Unless it's like, you know, fantasy football type of attraction, you know, where you can

263
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,820
see your fantasy team play or whatever.

264
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
I don't know.

265
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,820
Logie?

266
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,820
I don't know.

267
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,060
We don't know why people get into this.

268
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,980
Seriously, they tried to do a fantasy football league at my old job and they asked me, you

269
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,260
know, to been in it and I was like, I don't know.

270
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,260
That's all I said.

271
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,420
One thing like watching, I don't know what that is.

272
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,060
Like watching the esports stuff is just more kind of, I mean, it's fun to watch people

273
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,060
play sometimes.

274
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,380
Like I used to watch Arena on G4 and that was sort of esports stuff.

275
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,180
I mean, I don't know how staged all that was, but it's basically, you know, two teams and

276
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,180
a commentary.

277
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,700
And that can be fun sometimes if it's a game you're interested in, like if they did a Grand

278
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,900
Theft Auto, although, you know, they'd have to show me because I'm so fucking awesome.

279
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:47,660
But hey, wait until five because no one plays anymore.

280
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,500
What about competitive Minecraft?

281
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,940
Although I guess that's not really a thing.

282
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,940
It could be.

283
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,940
It is a thing.

284
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,940
Is it?

285
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,940
No, it can be a thing.

286
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,580
Well, competitive Minecraft, they have usually it's different game modes like the people

287
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,580
set up.

288
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:06,260
For example, I've watched videos of people just creating their own kind of games, like

289
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:12,440
one of which, OK, everybody, we're going to throw you outside of this house and the first

290
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:18,300
person to, was it the last person to survive is the winner or something like that.

291
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,300
Like Minecraft Battle Royale?

292
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,300
Sort of.

293
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,580
And it was like it's basically a ton of monster zone.

294
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,940
They gave them like very little weapons and it was just, OK, survive and whoever survives

295
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,940
the longest.

296
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,260
And they have like rounds and stuff that deal with that.

297
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,260
And that's kind of entertaining.

298
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,940
It really blows my mind.

299
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:36,180
They haven't made a game out of battle royale or even like the Hunger Games they have on

300
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,180
Minecraft.

301
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,180
They have a Hunger Games servers.

302
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,180
OK.

303
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,180
All right.

304
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,140
They actually do play the Hunger Games like that, where they all start off and it's basically

305
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:48,540
everybody free for all and there's chess where they find stuff to help them survive.

306
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,700
For the record, I'm not talking about that iPhone game that was like a platformer shooter

307
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,700
based on.

308
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,700
You know what I'm talking about.

309
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,980
I mean, like, you know, strategize, find the weapons, find your opponents, that that whole

310
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,980
type of thing.

311
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,260
I know Marvel totally bit off battle royale specifically now because now there's like

312
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,780
an Avengers battle royale comic where they've taken like little bit characters from all

313
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,540
over the Marvel universe and make them basically kill each other off until there's one left.

314
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,020
And the cover is totally a rip off the movie.

315
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,860
Well, battle royale kind of gained a lot of popularity again, thanks to the Hunger Games.

316
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,100
I mean, you know, obviously, a lot of people saw the similarities and so forth.

317
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,180
But I heard at one point the CW was kicking around a battle royale show.

318
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,180
It's gone.

319
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,300
They are not moving forward with it.

320
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,500
That would definitely, I would totally watch it.

321
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,580
They said, hold on, guys.

322
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,740
It was nothing more than like an idea we kicked around.

323
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,740
But still, what an odd TV show.

324
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,300
Yeah, we can't put that out now that there's kids dying, you know, in the news.

325
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,940
I think it would make a great TV show as a drama.

326
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:55,260
I mean, I'm really surprised nobody's tried to pitch a like a literal Hunger Games reality

327
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,260
show.

328
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,260
Obviously, no death.

329
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,260
Paintball?

330
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,940
Paintballs or, you know, non lethal types of things like, you know, silly things of

331
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:07,140
your beatings and nerf the Nerf Hunger Games.

332
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,140
They have laser.

333
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,140
I watch that.

334
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,140
The Nerfing games.

335
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,140
There you go.

336
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,140
I'd even watch that.

337
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,100
You know, they need to bring back laser tag.

338
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,420
Yes.

339
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,420
Except not the bad cartoon.

340
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,420
Is that a TV show?

341
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,420
Yeah.

342
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,420
There's a bad laser tag cartoon.

343
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,420
Huh?

344
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,260
Well, I was I thought they actually had laser tag on TV.

345
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,700
I never thought they actually had it on TV.

346
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,140
The commercial.

347
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,140
No, no.

348
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,140
Back in the 90s.

349
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,140
They kind of had else.

350
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,140
You can see the 80s cartoons.

351
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,340
You can see all sorts of weird shit on in the morning in the 90s, you know, and.

352
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:41,620
Well, now you just see all sorts of weird shit on after midnight on Adult Swim.

353
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,580
There's a big difference, though, between Adventure Time, which is great.

354
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,580
Don't get me wrong.

355
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,580
I love it.

356
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,060
There's a big difference between that and like Fun House.

357
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,060
Okay.

358
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,860
Tiger class says they should do a survivor for kids.

359
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,220
They did.

360
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,740
It was called Lord of the Flies.

361
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,020
No, but they did.

362
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,020
They did.

363
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,780
It was like, was it Eco-Challenge or something like that?

364
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,220
They did have one for kids.

365
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,780
It was survivor for kids.

366
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:12,700
But I it was obviously a lot different, like because, you know, obviously you don't want

367
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,380
to do the psychological trauma with kids.

368
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:20,020
But there was I think it was mostly physical based like like Guts.

369
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,020
Guts was awesome.

370
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,020
Right.

371
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,340
I liked the announcer.

372
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,700
I'm hoping somebody in chat will remember the name of that show.

373
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,700
I need it.

374
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,700
I need a reality TV nerd.

375
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,380
If like Shane's listening, he might remember.

376
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,860
He'll know what show I'm talking about.

377
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,180
I don't remember what network it was on.

378
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,180
SSJ 100.

379
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,940
Matt says American Gladiators was the closest we had to that type of thing.

380
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,980
You know what happened with that reboot?

381
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:46,580
I was so excited because like American Gladiators was such bad ass TV back when we were growing

382
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,580
up.

383
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,460
It was like it was so just brain gone.

384
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,460
It doesn't matter.

385
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,780
It's just errors.

386
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,320
It was watching for the love of God.

387
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,480
It was.

388
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,780
Can you have a game show without all the reality bullshit tied to it?

389
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,980
I mean, that's everything nowadays.

390
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,780
It's like trying to get in the head of the contestant and like, let's find out about

391
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,780
their life.

392
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,780
I don't care what you like.

393
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,780
I want to see them play a game.

394
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,780
And that's it.

395
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,580
All I need to know about them is their name is Bob and they're from Detroit or something

396
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,580
like that.

397
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,580
That's it.

398
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,580
And they're a firefighter.

399
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,580
Whatever.

400
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,580
And there they were in the military.

401
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,580
You know, that type of thing.

402
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,580
That's all we need to know.

403
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,580
Yeah.

404
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,580
I think it just didn't work in primetime.

405
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,420
American Gladiator just came back as like a primetime show.

406
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,680
Like, you know, and it's just like, no, this is the type of thing that's meant to be like

407
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,680
Saturday at four o'clock.

408
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,680
I've already found the best show.

409
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,460
They need, what they need to do is take reality TV and just give it all to Canada because

410
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,080
Canada does it right.

411
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,080
Canada does it right.

412
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,300
I am addicted to Canada's worst drivers.

413
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,700
OK.

414
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,780
Shane is asking, is it the CBS one that had the kids living in the town?

415
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,780
Kid Nation?

416
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,180
No, I forgot about that one.

417
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,960
That one got a lot of shit because it was like really psychologically damaging to those

418
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
kids.

419
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,180
There was another one.

420
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,920
It was on cable.

421
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,920
It was on.

422
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,240
I don't think it was on Nickelodeon, but like Discovery Kids or something.

423
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,240
Somebody's got to know this.

424
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,400
I will look it up on Wikipedia, dammit.

425
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,040
All right.

426
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,160
I guess we'll move into how was your gaming week?

427
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,960
This way I can answer this question by looking.

428
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,440
Somebody's listening to the podcast, not live this week, going, I know the name of the show.

429
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,440
It was.

430
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,440
All right.

431
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,800
Let's go to Dark Sakura.

432
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,000
And how was your gaming week?

433
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,880
I played Minecraft last night for for four hours.

434
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
Wow.

435
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,880
What a what the turnaround.

436
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,880
Jamie's me.

437
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,200
Remember when you used to sit here on the show and say Minecraft's stupid.

438
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,360
I didn't say it was stupid.

439
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,400
I just said I wouldn't play it until someone paid for me, too.

440
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,080
And now that someone paid for me, too, that I'm playing it.

441
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,760
But I was busy working on my underground lair, which apparently Loki hasn't found yet.

442
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,200
I haven't really been playing that.

443
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,520
I've been see like I've been trying to do things that involve my brain in not the same

444
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
way Minecraft doesn't.

445
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,240
But it's just like I don't really know what I want to do with it right now.

446
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,440
And so I've been trying to do other things, but then my brain gets too tired.

447
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,200
So I play like dumb games like Skyrim with a ton of mods on it.

448
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,160
It's really unstable now, too.

449
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,520
Well, I was just doing other stuff.

450
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,400
So that's why I was playing Minecraft while I was doing other things.

451
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,780
But it's just sort of nice to sit back and have something mindless to sort of work on

452
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:15,040
that's a little creative and trying not to hit those guys that explode.

453
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,040
I hate them.

454
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,440
Because most of my houses are made out of glass.

455
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,800
My roofs are made out of glass.

456
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,960
I've got this whole network of underground tunnels built.

457
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,940
And I seriously have a mole village.

458
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,120
People can come live in my mole village if they want to.

459
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,320
I finally put a bed in my house.

460
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,760
Can you play whack-a-mole in your mole village?

461
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,760
No.

462
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,840
And I did play a little WoW.

463
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,880
I'm trying to get back into WoW.

464
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,480
I played some Mass Effect 3, but that's just because I was playing around with more of

465
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,400
the mods and I think I'm close to getting Flycam working.

466
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,780
Are you going to get into the whole...

467
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,240
The name slipped my mind.

468
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,360
When they make the movies out of video games.

469
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,360
Machinima.

470
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,360
Thank you.

471
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,360
Machinima.

472
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
Are you going to get into the whole Machinima thing?

473
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,080
No, but on my Mass Effect-ing Tumblr.

474
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,080
That's like your...

475
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,080
That's why I ask.

476
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,440
Because your Mass Effect-ing Tumblr, you're making still pictures.

477
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,440
That's kind of like getting your big toe in the door.

478
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,200
I'm doing Lull Effect is what it's called.

479
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,200
Lull Effect.

480
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,200
Is that like a thing?

481
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
It's not just you, it's a bunch of other people?

482
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Other people have done it, but now I'm making it a thing.

483
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,840
What if it's not very funny though?

484
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,880
A lot of people think it is.

485
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,040
So I've got 103 followers now.

486
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,040
Wow.

487
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,400
How come we can't get that many people listening to the show?

488
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
Shut up.

489
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,800
Does this show need Lull Effect?

490
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
It needs more Mass Effect.

491
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Tell a Mass Effect joke.

492
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
Caden.

493
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
Get out.

494
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:33,080
But I've also started doing this other thing that I call Shepherd and Tumblr.

495
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,880
I've done three versions now where one of them is like Shepherd looking at Tumblr on

496
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,880
a data pad.

497
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,600
And I've exploded it now to where Shepherd was looking at pictures of cats on Google.

498
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,560
And then I have another one where Shepherd's looking at Grumpy Cat.

499
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,640
It's actually one of the last ones I posted on Mass Effect.

500
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,280
And that's what people post on Tumblr.

501
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,760
Pictures of Shepherd looking at cats.

502
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,800
But that's on Mass Effect because most of Tumblr is built off of Lull Cats and the Grumpy

503
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
Cat.

504
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
So I did a Grumpy Cat one.

505
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,800
And tits.

506
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
And tits.

507
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,280
I found the funniest one because I also reblog a lot of funny fan comics.

508
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,120
And one of them is Tali saying, Shepherd, grab my boobs, and it's broship going honk.

509
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,480
And then it's flying off in the air going pilgrimage.

510
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,760
That's pretty much Tumblr in a nutshell.

511
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,760
So that's what I've been doing.

512
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,880
Oh, that and politics, but whatever.

513
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,240
SSU 100, Matt, you disappoint me.

514
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,440
You need to finish Mass Effect 3.

515
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,040
You do it with the extended cut.

516
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:35,880
So I've also been doing that and trying to get back into limbo, but I've just really

517
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,880
been busy.

518
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,280
I start school this week and my class is all online.

519
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,800
But hey, if anyone wants me to design them a website, I can do it for school credit.

520
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,280
All right.

521
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,280
So J-links remembered the show I was trying to think of.

522
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,280
Endurance.

523
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,280
Thank you, Tigerclaw.

524
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,560
Endurance was the name of Survivor for kids.

525
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,020
It was on NBC and then moved to Discovery Kids and I had the kids all split up into

526
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,560
teams and it was just, you know, they did all this.

527
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,200
Who could survive the longest before their bedtime?

528
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,280
Moving on.

529
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,560
I just had to put that to rest, that discussion from earlier.

530
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,400
All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

531
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,800
My gaming week was OK.

532
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,840
I played a few things that some new things, I guess.

533
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,400
I tried out the MOGA with the free game that came with it.

534
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:29,320
The what is it, Modern Combat 4, you know, the complete rip off of Call of Duty by Gameloft.

535
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,400
It was OK.

536
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,760
I'm not a huge fan of the MOGA controller, like the first one they put out.

537
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,360
Their new one that they showed at CES, the one that's full size, I think it'll be a little

538
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:46,520
bit better because, once again, it's kind of like the Vita controls.

539
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:52,080
It's cool that they have dual analog sticks and stuff, but it's just not the same as like

540
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,400
a console controller.

541
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,840
It's a little bit cramped, I guess.

542
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,560
But it worked all right and it was kind of fun until my wife said, what the hell are

543
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,560
you doing?

544
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,440
We went over to her parents' house and she's like, well, you should bring something to

545
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,440
do.

546
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,440
I'm like, OK.

547
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,440
So I brought something to do.

548
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,320
And of course, she did not, even though she asked me to.

549
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,880
And so I brought that and she's like, is that a controller for your phone?

550
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,240
Are you addicted to games or something?

551
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,400
You have that so that it's easier to play games on your phone?

552
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,720
I'm like, yeah, because I got it for free.

553
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:31,840
And yes, it is easier to play games like that on my phone.

554
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
It's not bad.

555
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,840
It's pretty cool.

556
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,800
If I want to play a game like that, it's a hell of a lot better than virtual sticks and

557
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,560
stuff on the actual screen.

558
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,760
So it worked out pretty cool.

559
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,160
What else did they play?

560
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,160
Oh, yeah.

561
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,960
More Skyrim on Steam with all my mods in there, although I'm going to start having to scale

562
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:58,160
back on some of those mods, because I'm running into crashing problems where it'll just dump

563
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,000
me for no apparent reason.

564
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:09,920
I can't build a forge at my house in Hearthfire because, I don't know, it just will crash

565
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,920
for no reason.

566
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,320
I'm not really sure why, but it's only one to build a forge.

567
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,120
And just some other weird stuff.

568
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,120
Like there's one I have.

569
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,440
It's called Midas Magic, which adds a bunch of different magic spells that they created

570
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,600
for the game.

571
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:29,440
The problem is, they have this thing that you put items in to craft these spells in

572
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:37,920
the Riverwood Trader, and when it creates a spell, the spell book is marked as steel.

573
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,640
And so you can't get the book without pissing everybody off.

574
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,680
And so the first spell I got, I'm like, okay, I'm going to turn invisible, I'm going to

575
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,880
sneak, and be invisible, and I'm going to grab the spell really quick, use the spell,

576
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,440
and then maybe they won't notice anything.

577
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,120
Nope, they all tried to murder me instead.

578
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,280
Which I mean, it's just a minor inconvenience because none of them can actually kill me,

579
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,320
but I just don't want to have to kill them, because that would be terrible, all these

580
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,440
quests I'll miss because I'm going to have to go kill all of them.

581
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:17,480
Then other games I played, I played one of the other games I backed on Kickstarter, the

582
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,240
Gianna Sisters game.

583
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,020
Oh yeah, how is that?

584
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,760
I have that from the Steam sale, still waiting to be played.

585
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,920
It's pretty cool actually, I do enjoy it.

586
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,120
Played it with an Xbox 360 controller, and it's a pretty awesome platformer.

587
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,800
I'm digging it, I tried it for a little bit and I was like, eh, I don't really want to

588
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,280
play this anymore, so I went back to Skyrim, but I liked it, I thought it was a pretty

589
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,280
cool game.

590
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:45,560
And then a new game I played on consoles this week, Forza Horizon, actually got into that

591
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
a bit.

592
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,880
Welcome to the cult of Forza Horizon, congratulations.

593
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,760
So I played that a bit, and it's fun.

594
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,520
First order of business is I drove on all the roads so I can get that achievement, and

595
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,160
I hit all the signs, so now I get free upgrades.

596
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,120
Did you look online to see where all the signs were?

597
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,120
No.

598
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,120
Oh, while you were driving?

599
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,120
Yeah, I was driving all the roads.

600
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,000
I haven't even done that yet.

601
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,520
There was a couple that I couldn't find right away, and then I was like, okay, looking at

602
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,520
the map and kind of, okay, there's probably something right here, I mean it's pretty obvious

603
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,400
where they're hiding some of them.

604
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,240
What did you think of the whole introduction and the setup, though?

605
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,920
Did you have the same reaction I did, where it's like, these rich spoiled brats?

606
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,560
Like, that was my reaction.

607
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,520
Not even that, but there's some things that are annoying me about it.

608
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:34,280
It's like, I'll still get radio chatter where it's like, hey, did you see that such a such

609
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,760
person has those signs out there, and if you hit them you'll get this guy like, I fucking

610
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,680
know because I hit all of them already, you stupid bitch.

611
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,200
I don't need you telling me this over and over again.

612
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,200
Or like, you know.

613
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,400
I think it's just randomized, Logan, it's not that serious.

614
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,000
Yeah, I understand, but they should shut that off if you've hit all the signs, or if you

615
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,360
know you hit a couple of signs, you should, they should shut that off.

616
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,440
Are you really gonna razz the game because some radio lady didn't know you hit all the

617
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,440
signs?

618
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:07,840
Well then, and also like, hey, hey, you haven't shown up to my wonderful showcase event, and

619
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,560
it's like, do you not like making money?

620
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,520
I mean, it's like, fucking stop bothering me, you stupid bitch, I don't wanna do your

621
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,520
fucking event.

622
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,200
I don't wanna race a, it's like, dude, like, and then the radio answer's hilarious, like,

623
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,200
he's all, dude, they have an event where you race a hot air balloon.

624
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,160
I'm sorry, but if I heard of like, this event I could go to to watch a car race a hot air

625
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,680
balloon, that'd be fucking boring, because hot air balloons are not fast.

626
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,000
It's a fun race, have you done the race yet?

627
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,800
Yes, I did the race, but hot air balloons are not known for their speed, okay?

628
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
It's just a hot air balloon.

629
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,240
Despite your snark, how do you really feel about the game?

630
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,240
It's alright.

631
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,560
It's a great game, it's like kind of Burnout Paradise Light, I guess, you know, that's

632
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,560
pretty much it.

633
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,960
You need to play some online, it's fun.

634
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,960
I'm sure it is.

635
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,720
One of these nights, we're gonna fill up a race with all VOG people, that's gonna be

636
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,720
interesting.

637
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,400
And I'll probably still get last place.

638
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:05,280
Well, I had to go into multiplayer to do some of my, the speed trap things, because fucking

639
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:11,160
caravan, like, always being from, goddamn minivan, just like, there, like, I'm flying

640
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:16,400
over the hill, like, four, like, you know, 160 miles an hour, goddamn minivan right there,

641
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:22,480
like, every time, just like some stupid, like, Volkswagen Beetle or something, it's just

642
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,480
like, boom!

643
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,000
So what, you, you go into the world Rome mode with other people?

644
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
You don't do racing?

645
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
By myself.

646
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Oh.

647
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Well, no, I have been doing racing.

648
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I haven't really been racing too much at the events, because I did, I did a lot of the

649
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,400
challenges and I got, you know, money from that, and then I bought some cars, and then

650
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,920
I, I said, hey, I'm gonna go beat everybody's scores on these things, and so I did that

651
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,560
for a lot of it, and kept racing back and forth, so I'm a Lamborghini.

652
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,640
A sitting vampire in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, racing a hot air balloon?

653
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,640
The hell?

654
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,640
Yep, that's a thing.

655
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,640
You race airplanes too.

656
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,640
Airplanes and apparently a helicopter, according to the radio, but I haven't done that yet.

657
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,600
Airplanes thing, man, some of that stuff pisses me off, because those cars handle, like,

658
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,600
crap.

659
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,240
Or like, I don't know, hey, let's race this Lamborghini on a dirt track, I mean, that

660
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:16,640
doesn't make any sense, or, or some of the ones where they're like, I want you to show

661
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,520
off for the people, and you have to do these cool, you know, you have to get, like, twenty

662
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,980
eight thousand points by driving down the street, it's like, how the fuck do I do that?

663
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,960
Have you played a lot with the customization mode?

664
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,400
Brad from Pod Culture in our chat room reminding us the creation mode in Forza is fantastic.

665
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
It is very good.

666
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,780
I don't know if you've played around a lot with the, like, you know, decal making and

667
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,780
all that.

668
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,780
Yeah, I have, I mean.

669
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,300
Oh, yeah, you made, like, an Orange Lodge radio car, didn't you?

670
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,940
Yeah, I have an Orange Lodge radio car.

671
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,940
That's nice.

672
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,780
Well, I haven't finished it yet, but I've got that started.

673
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:47,340
So Bobby made a VoG car, you made an OLR car, I think Brad made a Pod Culture car, we need

674
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,340
to, like.

675
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,980
I have to have a garis car.

676
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,500
You could do, you could make a garis car, probably.

677
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,620
Is it interesting how to do it, I mean, it's a lot of just, you have to manipulate the

678
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,260
shapes that they give you to make stuff.

679
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:03,740
I bet somebody else already made, I know there's N7 cars all over the place, that's easy.

680
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,700
Someone made a Tali car, but it wasn't very good.

681
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,580
But actually, like, instead of just, like, writing out Orange Lodge radio, I actually

682
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,140
pulled out my old business card, which is completely useless now since the phone number

683
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,980
and websites are all incorrect.

684
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:20,100
But I actually recreated the logo that was on there using just boxes.

685
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,100
Very cool.

686
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:25,740
All right, anything else for your gaming week?

687
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,740
I, uh, Call of Duty, I'm sure I played a little bit of that in Borderlands.

688
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,220
I think we restarted Borderlands on true Vault Hunter mode, and we're kind of back up to

689
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:37,740
where we were before, when we first started playing co-op, but I was kind of pissed off

690
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:42,260
at that because I tried, you know, we were trying to go back into the game and do all

691
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:46,700
the side missions and the original difficulty, and it's like, hey, you've unlocked this true

692
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,340
Vault Hunter mode, do you want to do that now?

693
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:52,220
I'm like, yeah, sure, whatever, let's bump up the difficulty and, you know, we can go

694
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:55,900
back there and it's like, well, if you decide to, you can change it later on in these settings

695
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,900
or whatever.

696
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:01,380
I'm like, okay, can't find the settings anywhere for that, and now that I'm in true Vault Hunter

697
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:06,460
mode, my game restarted, except I have all my weapons and, like, I'm still level, you

698
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:11,420
know, 50, but it's still annoying, I was like, god damn, I, you know, I was gonna do all

699
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:16,620
these side missions, now I just have to do them in this, now, I guess, it'll be a little

700
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,620
bit harder.

701
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:22,620
So I haven't downloaded any of the DLC, and I probably won't, maybe, you know, because

702
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,780
my friend's playing with me and I don't want to buy two copies of them, so that would be

703
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,780
annoying.

704
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,780
All right, is that it?

705
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,780
That's it.

706
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,580
Um, not a whole lot of new stuff, in fact, revisiting old stuff.

707
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:37,860
As far as new stuff goes, there's some iOS games, um, Final Fantasy All the Bravest,

708
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,180
a lot of you guys have been reading about this on the internet, it's kind of controversial.

709
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,180
I don't want to spoil my thoughts too much, because I actually wrote them down for a VoG

710
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:48,100
article that I'm going to post tomorrow after all the podcasts go up, uh, with some other

711
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,940
articles, there's some content going up next week.

712
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,940
Promises, promises.

713
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,940
Yeah, I know.

714
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:58,580
Uh, but, uh, yeah, Final Fantasy All the Bravest, um, interesting, that's all I'm going to say,

715
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,580
for now.

716
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,580
Stay tuned.

717
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,460
Uh, but I will talk a little more in depth about Temple Run 2.

718
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,060
Sequel to Temple Run, which, uh, has inspired a lot of knockoffs and so forth.

719
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:11,580
Temple Run 2 looks gorgeous on my iPad 3 Retina, I gotta say, for a free game.

720
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:16,940
Uh, Temple Run's a really great time killer, and, uh, it's funny because this game gets

721
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:20,420
compared to Pitfall and back and forth when the two games are kind of ripping each other

722
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,420
off.

723
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:25,960
I would say Pitfall, uh, and I'm talking about the iOS remake of Pitfall, not, or re-imagining

724
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,600
of Pitfall, let's be real, not the classic, classic Atari game.

725
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,920
Um, Pitfall really, the re-imagining really jacked a lot from the original Temple Run,

726
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,520
but it is kind of neat that Temple Run 2 also kind of went the route of the mine cars and

727
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,520
so forth.

728
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,080
I think it looks really good, uh, and it's, uh, addicting to play, and, and they kind

729
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,560
of changed the, you know, freemium elements of it, and it's, it's a little more compelling

730
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,600
than Pitfall, in my opinion.

731
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,440
So yeah, Temple Run 2, good times.

732
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,560
Um, otherwise, as far as, like, PC and consoles go, not a lot of new stuff.

733
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,760
I have Assassin's Creed 3 from the rental company ready to play, but I didn't get around

734
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,760
to it this weekend, so I'm gonna check that out during the week this week.

735
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:11,640
Um, and I did play World of Warcraft, of course, had an epic Civilization 5 match again on

736
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,640
Saturday night.

737
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:19,040
Uh, this time, it was myself and four other people were playing, so it was five of us

738
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:23,280
playing Civ 5, and, uh, we started, I think, around 8 o'clock.

739
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:29,040
I went to bed at 3.30, and we weren't even close to being done, so yeah, no, no VoG people,

740
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,040
unfortunately, this time.

741
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,600
I know we've been talking about, like, Bobby and I have been trying to play for a while,

742
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,160
and it just hasn't happened yet.

743
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:38,700
Um, but yeah, some of my, uh, IRL friends were all playing, and it was, it was a lot

744
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,700
of fun.

745
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:43,120
But the hilarious part is that I'm pretty much on an island all by myself.

746
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,320
I'm in, like, an Australia place all by myself with one computer opponent, and they are all

747
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,920
on another little continent, and they're just, they're all killing each other, so I'm

748
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:57,560
just like, okay, I'm happy here in my little arctic paradise, whatever, have fun.

749
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:05,760
All right, um, other games I've played this week, um, I went back, kicking it old school

750
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,240
on my 3DS, playing a DS game.

751
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,920
I've been playing Pokemon Pearl, because ever since that X and Y trailer came out, I'm like,

752
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,920
that looks really good.

753
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:20,040
Like, finally, they've got the Pokemon games looking like the cartoon series, like, it

754
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,480
took them long enough.

755
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,840
So I've kind of decided to go back and look at the older games in an effort to collect

756
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:31,240
Pokemon to transfer to X and Y at some point, so, you know, why not?

757
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:36,080
So I've got very far, but I have about three, four hours logged on Pokemon Pearl.

758
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,880
No particular reason I picked that one, that just happens to be the one that I had in my

759
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,040
collection from, like, years ago, so, and I never really got very far in it, so I'm

760
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,760
rediscovering it all over again.

761
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,760
There you go.

762
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:52,920
Um, so, yeah, wow, Civ, Pokemon, I guess that's really about it.

763
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,520
Nothing else to share for now.

764
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:58,400
Some random XBLA games here and there, but nothing worth talking in depth about.

765
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,000
So let's move on into housekeeping tonight.

766
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,520
You can, of course, always visit us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R, and you can also

767
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:12,320
visit us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, and, again, I would encourage

768
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,400
you as well to check out the Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com and support some

769
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,920
of the other shows that are on the network.

770
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,680
We got a lot of great shows throughout the week that play on the network, and encourage

771
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,760
you to check that out.

772
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,720
Also since I brought up Twitter, I wanted to talk about this real quick, somebody had

773
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,920
sent me a tweet the other day, and I thought this was a pretty neat, like, cause I wanted

774
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:37,600
to bring up, and sometimes people will tweet us at O-L-R and say, hey, please retweet this,

775
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,080
but remember, if your account is private, we can't retweet, like, the retweet button

776
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,640
is actually disabled.

777
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:50,640
So this was one of these things where somebody tweeted, it was, the Twitter handle is UnlimitedOneUps,

778
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,160
tweeted us, and said, hey, retweet this.

779
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,720
So I can't retweet it, so I'll do something a little different.

780
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:00,600
I will plug it here on the show, cause I think this is a really great cause.

781
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:10,360
It's called presspaws.org, but it's press P-A-W-S, like doggy paws and kitty paws.

782
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:15,040
I thought this was great, cause obviously, Orange Launch Radio, we've had a lot of, you

783
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,780
know, loved pets pass away this past year, unfortunately, it's very tragic.

784
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,840
So what better time to bring up something like this?

785
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:26,360
The website presspaws.org, saving animals with art and video games, and they're actually

786
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,800
doing this whole little gallery, February 9th at Gallery Nucleus, which I believe's

787
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,880
in the Chicago area, question mark?

788
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,720
So it's not really here, let me actually, actually now I'm curious where this is at.

789
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,720
I think the Twitter person was in the Chicago area, so I didn't see this, let me see real

790
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,720
quick.

791
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,680
Sorry guys, I like literally just brought it up.

792
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,280
Oh no, this is in the LA area, my bad, this is in Alhambra.

793
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,360
So that's really cool, it's in the LA area, and yeah, I think they hit their goal already

794
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:03,080
of 3,000 to, you know, raise the money and everything, but yeah, check out the website.

795
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,240
It's cute.

796
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,920
Look at all the doggies with the question mark blocks and the goombas and wearing the

797
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,920
Luigi hats.

798
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,920
There need to be more kitties.

799
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,880
There's another doggie, there aren't, there really aren't a lot of kitties here, are there?

800
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,880
There's one.

801
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,880
There's a kitty.

802
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,880
Yeah.

803
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,800
Definitely don't know your target audience on the internet.

804
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,080
Well, I thought it was cute and worth a shout out, so there you go.

805
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,480
It is cute, very good, and Tigerclaw reposted it in the chat room.

806
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,160
Thank you.

807
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,400
I wanted to mention something too real quick about my gaming week that I forgot to mention.

808
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:38,360
Wars of Horizon, love, love, love that Horizon base arena station on there.

809
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,760
Oh yeah, yeah, they've got some good music in the game.

810
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,560
Yeah, a lot of them, you know, a lot of them are actually songs I listened to already in

811
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,160
the car, but make a new CD for my car.

812
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,160
Yeah.

813
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,320
Although, although I have to say, what the fuck is Blue Monday by New Order doing on

814
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,320
that goddamn station?

815
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,440
It makes no fucking sense.

816
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,880
Why the fuck not?

817
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,520
Because it's not, it's not, it's not a base on, New Order belongs everywhere, if it was,

818
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,380
if it was the New Order remix that was in Blade or something, yes, that would totally

819
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,280
fit with that station, but New Order, it just, it doesn't, that would be perfect like on

820
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,280
the rock station or something.

821
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,560
Maybe your base just isn't high enough.

822
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:22,100
It doesn't have a lot of base in it, it's Blue Monday, I mean, come on.

823
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,200
At least it's not that horrible remake that was done a couple, oh my god, it was probably

824
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,200
about 10 years ago.

825
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,400
Yeah, and those guys were assholes and said, well, our version's better.

826
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,400
In hell.

827
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,440
Alright.

828
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,440
In nowhere.

829
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,280
Alright, uh, let's move on.

830
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,920
Let's get into gaming news and talk about what's been going on in the video game world

831
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:43,080

or tweet us or what have you.

834
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,360
Let's get into the news, Loki.

835
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:55,160
Alright, so let's talk a little bit about Nintendo and it's kind of interesting that

836
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:00,560
they decided to go ahead and merge their handheld and console divisions, which I hope that this

837
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,840
means that we're going to see a lot more kind of stuff that we used to have with even

838
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,560
like the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance and stuff like that where you see a lot of

839
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,840
synergy between the console versions and the portables like, you know, tying into each

840
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:17,360
other like, hey, you can unlock crap from the console version if you plug in your system

841
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,360
or whatever.

842
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,280
Maybe we see something like that with the 3DS and, you know, the Wii U or something

843
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,920
like that, some sort of cross connectivity with some games or something, that'd be pretty

844
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:32,920
awesome or, you know, better console games, I guess, on handhelds or, or I don't know,

845
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,480
maybe because the Wii U is almost like a 3DS anyways, just tied to a TV.

846
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,320
So yeah, I was going to say, I thought this was going to go more along your joke about

847
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,320
how the Wii U is just basically a DS without hinges.

848
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,760
It pretty much is.

849
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,680
Although we should add hinges, we should just like hinge it to the TV, clamp, clamp the

850
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,680
game pad to the TV, there you go, done.

851
00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:01,040
You know, actually, if you, well, I was going to see if there was a way to get like an external

852
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,040
monitor or something like that.

853
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:06,320
They should make that an external monitor that clips to your game pad that makes it

854
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,320
like a 3DS.

855
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,160
It's like, okay, I got the screen up here and yeah, I'm kind of thing.

856
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,280
Well, let me read this next story because the two kind of go hand in hand.

857
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,000
Maybe I want to talk about if, if the two go hand in hand or what it can mean.

858
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,360
And it's a report going around about the Wii U game sales.

859
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:26,160
Apparently the game sales are actually lagging behind the Wii and the GameCube.

860
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,160
Please note the keyword there.

861
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,920
It is the game sales.

862
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:36,920
Analyst Doug Kreutz of a Cohen and company is interpreting the software sales totals

863
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:42,160
for the November to December period were 43% lower than software sales for the Wii and

864
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,720
50% lower than those for the GameCube.

865
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,600
Ouch.

866
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:52,400
But then again, you know, the Wii U, I don't, I mean, even though a lot of people are like,

867
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,920
Wii U has got the biggest launch lineup ever and it's got all these games.

868
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,120
I mean, the reality is a lot of those games were already played by people a long time

869
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,980
ago and I don't think they were as exciting.

870
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:07,800
And especially alongside the Wii lineup, the original Wii, you know, you had a lot, a lot

871
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,120
more like everybody had to have Zelda.

872
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,080
And I think on the Wii U you get a lot of people that have to have Mario, but I think

873
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,920
people don't feel like they need to get much else.

874
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,920
Yeah.

875
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,880
Or let's say you own multiple consoles and say you're buying Call of Duty.

876
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,640
Are you going to buy the comp or buy Call of Duty for the console that you just got

877
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,080
that maybe your friends don't have yet or you can buy it for the one that your friends

878
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:31,480
are already on or, you know, you know, like you put and put out there.

879
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,040
I mean, there's a lot of games are just stuff that was either released slightly earlier

880
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,040
or at the same time.

881
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,600
I mean, it's not a lot of really exclusive new stuff.

882
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,840
And one of the big new exclusive games, Nintendo land was included with the console and most

883
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,840
people bought anyways.

884
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,120
Yeah, but Wii Sports was included with the Wii, which was an even bigger deal.

885
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:55,040
So I, I, but, but it, that's true it was, but this is also being sold alongside of it

886
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,040
as well.

887
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,040
I mean, that's got to hurt.

888
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,480
In fact, every week came with Wii Sports.

889
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,800
So there was no like, you know, double ski.

890
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,720
Well, in the beginning anyway, we came with Wii Sports, but, um, I don't know.

891
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,920
I just, there's not a lot of original games I think for right now.

892
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:14,020
Now to be fair, one thing that is pointed out is that, um, you know, e-shop downloads

893
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,400
don't get included in the NPD numbers.

894
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,580
So if people are buying games online, which they might've done over the holiday season

895
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:24,100
because they don't want to be caught in the mall, those numbers don't count.

896
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,460
I don't think that's as big of a factor as people are making it out to be.

897
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:32,820
I personally have a real hard time plunking down 50 bucks for a game with nothing tangible.

898
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,300
It's different when it's like 10, 15, you know, that's about 20 is about as high as

899
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,300
I go.

900
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,140
Perfect example, earth defense force 2017 portable, sigil only.

901
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:47,860
I was kind of staring at the screen cause I booted up my PSP or my vita, my vita this

902
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,860
week.

903
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:52,520
And I was like, you know, I was just looking at him like, do I really want to spend, no,

904
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:57,060
I'm not buying this for $40 that is too fucking expensive for digital download.

905
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,060
Sorry.

906
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,060
I forgot.

907
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,780
I totally forgot to talk about wake up club, but I'll get to that in part B.

908
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:05,660
But see, I spent more than a cost, well Dan did anyway, more than the cost of a Wii on

909
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,100
my graphics card.

910
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:14,220
And I can get games that play better, look better, and I can mod to hell and back.

911
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,820
Oh, you're going to be one of those people that are like PC gaming above all else.

912
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:24,500
To be honest, to be honest, I think PC gaming these days is really beating out the consoles.

913
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,100
I think that now people are starting to realize that you're getting a bit more of your money's

914
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:34,260
worth out of a PC gaming, I mean, except it's not yes and no.

915
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,720
Some games just don't run as smooth as they do on consoles because a lot of games are

916
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:44,600
optimized for the consoles, you know, because again, PCs all have that varying equipment,

917
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,600
which can make a difference.

918
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,260
But you know, consoles, everybody's got the same thing.

919
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:51,780
So a lot of times, you know, what works on the console doesn't necessarily work on PC.

920
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,580
I'm not, I mean, look at my gaming week.

921
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:57,380
I play World of Warcraft and Civ V. I'm not knocking PC gaming by any means, but I think

922
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,380
there's room at the table for both.

923
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:04,540
But I just think at this point, given the limitations with the Wii U software base,

924
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:08,620
and honestly that you're not getting anything really new out of it except for that little

925
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:13,660
controller, that my money was better spent on my graphics card.

926
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:18,420
Ross Deal UT in chat says, considering how low the Wii U storage is, I doubt that, talking

927
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,180
about the downloads, 32 gigs isn't a lot of space.

928
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,700
Yeah, that's an issue too.

929
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,260
I mean, granted, you can add your own drive to the system.

930
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:26,260
You know, they were touting that.

931
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,700
It's too early to really see the impact of that, I think.

932
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,980
You know, maybe when there's more desirable stuff, you know, we talked about how the Wii

933
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:37,820
U eShop is very indie friendly and we anticipate there's going to be a lot of good stuff that

934
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,740
comes in throughout the year.

935
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:44,620
I think it's still too early to gauge if a lot of people are actually doing that or not.

936
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:49,500
Now Ross Deal UT in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com actually follows up with another good comment

937
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,000
I wanted to read here.

938
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,420
Ross Deal UT actually left PC gaming because of the DRM.

939
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:59,420
And I got to admit, a lot of the PC games are shooting themselves in the foot when it

940
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,140
comes to DRM.

941
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:07,040
Not that consoles necessarily do a lot better, but like, you know, the SimCity shit, like

942
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,260
EA's upcoming SimCity game, I'm sorry, I am totally turned off to that game.

943
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,940
And it's because of the DRM.

944
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,460
Diablo 3 pissed a lot of people off.

945
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:18,860
You know, I think people are finally starting to say, you know what, I think we've hit our

946
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:22,600
limit with how tied we have to be to the internet.

947
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,680
You know, how much information we have to transmit from our computer on a regular basis

948
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,680
just to play a stupid game.

949
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,080
But it's the play with everybody else.

950
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:32,320
I mean, it's totally not because of the DRM, it's the play with everybody else, right?

951
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,320
Yeah.

952
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,120
But people wanted to cheat in SimCity.

953
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,000
Who didn't cheat in SimCity?

954
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,240
Everybody cheats in SimCity.

955
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,720
So why would you design your game to be online all the time so you can't cheat?

956
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,720
Hello?

957
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:48,360
However, Mass Effect 3, just for example, they wanted it online and they update the

958
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,160
game whenever they want to.

959
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,760
Still hackable, still cheatable.

960
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,080
Well, thankfully the single player multi, but they, they will nail your ass if you cheat

961
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,080
in the multiplayer.

962
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:00,200
But I'm also not an asshole and won't cheat in multiplayer.

963
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,000
So just saying.

964
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,880
Maybe other people are assholes and like to cheat in multiplayer.

965
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,240
Rama in our chatroom says, there are ways around DRM and for SimCity, I will do just

966
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,240
that.

967
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,240
That is exactly what's going to happen.

968
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,440
And I can't believe EA doesn't realize it.

969
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:19,920
Like some, somebody in a boardroom needs to get over their ego because just wait before

970
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,560
the game comes out, somebody will have hacked that DRM and we'll have an offline playable

971
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,200
downloadable SimCity.

972
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,080
Wait, that is exactly what will happen.

973
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,640
There's already hacks for just about any game out there.

974
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,600
There's ways to play it without the desk, which I'm actually starting to do with Mass

975
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,400
Effect 2 so that I can run text mod.

976
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:41,120
I'm just saying, because mine is a Amazon download.

977
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,520
I haven't said the G word.

978
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,640
All right.

979
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,600
So anyway, the point I wanted to get to was going back a story.

980
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:54,400
You were talking about the console division getting merged with the hardware division.

981
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:00,600
Could the Wii U's, I don't want to say underwhelming performance, but non overwhelming performance

982
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,320
be contributing to this?

983
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,320
Probably.

984
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:09,360
I would imagine it would be because they need to kind of figure out how they're going to

985
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:16,760
recapture the magic and the kind of serious rush for tight product that the Wii had.

986
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,400
I guess I don't really remember too much about the Wii launch.

987
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,880
I just know that the consoles are really hard to get.

988
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,560
I can tell you right now, they're not hard to get.

989
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:28,800
In fact, we're getting our consoles this early already and not like a year later, like with

990
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,960
the Wii.

991
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,860
That's because they're sitting on shelves.

992
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,440
They are sitting on shelves.

993
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,440
Stacks of them?

994
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,440
Yes.

995
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,440
It's not flying off the shelves and that's got to have them worried.

996
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:43,800
They don't want to have another 3DS debacle.

997
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,540
The 3DS is in a much better place now.

998
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,320
It is now, but what did that take?

999
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,140
They had to drop the price and put out a lot more games.

1000
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,140
Is that what they're going to have to do?

1001
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:57,320
If they have to drop the price of the Wii U within the first year, that's going to look

1002
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,280
like double failure on their part.

1003
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,160
I don't know anybody that doesn't think the problem with the Wii U right now is the lack

1004
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,800
of exclusive games, basically.

1005
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,200
Yes, there's an awesome Mario game.

1006
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,720
Yes, Nintendo Land is pretty good.

1007
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,040
But there's not enough of that.

1008
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,240
The 3DS had the exact same problem in the beginning.

1009
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,680
Exact same problem with the 3DS.

1010
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,440
You had a decent launch lineup, but nothing sustained it.

1011
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,200
Now we're getting in this position with the Wii U again, which I know you'll get into

1012
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,500
in a minute when we talk about the releases.

1013
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:33,100
It's going to be until next Christmas when we start getting the stuff people really want

1014
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,340
to get.

1015
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:35,340
That's the reality.

1016
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:42,360
Well, we don't even know what they have planned beyond, well, I guess, I mean, second quarter

1017
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,220
is going to be pretty much stuff that's held over from first quarter.

1018
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:47,740
Nintendo doesn't announce holiday ahead at E3.

1019
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:48,740
They never really have.

1020
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,820
I mean, think about it.

1021
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:53,700
Most of the big heavy hitters are always announced at E3.

1022
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,540
Other companies don't tend to do that as much.

1023
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:59,620
You might find out about stuff a little earlier, but Nintendo really kind of keeps it until

1024
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,620
E3.

1025
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,740
Especially with the new Xbox coming out this holiday.

1026
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:05,980
They're going to have to do something.

1027
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:09,780
They're going to have to really do something.

1028
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:13,300
Maybe the console's being merged so that the console people can work on a Wii U game.

1029
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,300
Who knows?

1030
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,300
I don't know.

1031
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,300
Push this button.

1032
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,300
Look.

1033
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,300
Hey, there's a 3DS hidden inside there.

1034
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,220
I bet you didn't know about that.

1035
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:23,100
Womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp.

1036
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:27,800
Maybe your whole little theory about the 3DS will soon become another Wii U gamepad.

1037
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,060
Maybe that will come to light.

1038
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,060
Who knows?

1039
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:34,700
Although I don't think the technology is capable in those 3DSs, but maybe there will be a

1040
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:39,540
3DS XL XL that will do it.

1041
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,540
4DS.

1042
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,540
4D or whatever.

1043
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:42,540
Yeah.

1044
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:43,540
That will do it.

1045
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:44,540
Who knows?

1046
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:45,540
That's an interesting question.

1047
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:49,580
Do you think the merging of the divisions means something for the next handheld?

1048
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:52,220
I guess anything's possible.

1049
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,700
All right, let's move on with more gaming news.

1050
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:55,700
Dark Sakura.

1051
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,700
Stupid iPad.

1052
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:57,700
Okay.

1053
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:06,820
So, well, we know that Sony has been losing money left and right, hand over fist.

1054
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:10,020
Well, they would like to make money hand over fist, but they've been losing it.

1055
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:16,860
So now they're actually selling their New York City headquarters for 1.1 billion.

1056
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:20,940
Sony Corp of America.

1057
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:25,420
They're going to be selling it off to the Chetric group, and it's supposed to close

1058
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,420
in March.

1059
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:38,580
Now, keep in mind that the company, it cost them, what was it, 770 million in debts that

1060
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:41,060
they're up to right now.

1061
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:45,100
So selling off this money is going to be a big, selling off the building, sorry, is going

1062
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,220
to be a huge recoup in lost income.

1063
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:53,340
However, I mean, what they're looking at, I'm not sure exactly what it costs to maintain

1064
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:57,540
the building, but they have a lot of money to make up.

1065
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:02,060
So you take a building, I know land taxes in New York are horrible.

1066
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,060
They're crazy.

1067
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,060
I used to do property taxes.

1068
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:05,900
Well, we all know New York City is an expensive place to live.

1069
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:06,900
It's no secret.

1070
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,220
And so, you know, the buildings there are worth a lot of money.

1071
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:15,800
But I mean, I don't see anything about a relocation of, of business getting a cheaper building,

1072
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,860
you know, place that's going to cost us money to maintain.

1073
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:20,740
I mean, for all we know, they could move to Montana.

1074
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,020
Can you imagine Sony in Montana?

1075
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:29,460
But they are going to be allowed to remain in the building for up to three years with

1076
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:32,340
the leaseback arrangement.

1077
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:35,260
So it's not like they're moving now.

1078
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:37,940
It's that they're letting the building go.

1079
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,980
Pretty much you're giving them the building back to the bank.

1080
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,380
We haven't heard anything about like jobs affected or anything.

1081
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:46,020
And also, I think it should be mentioned, I don't, Sony does more than PlayStation.

1082
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,020
Let's not forget.

1083
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,940
There is a lot at Sony.

1084
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:54,180
You know, not even just TVs, they have a whole motion picture division and music.

1085
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:58,080
And I'm sure I doubt very little PlayStation happens in Sony.

1086
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,220
You know, a lot of that is run out of the Bay Area.

1087
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:01,220
We know that.

1088
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:04,140
Well, in Japan for one, and in the Bay Area for the U.S.

1089
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:09,180
Like the video games division for Sony is really, I think, it's decent, but relatively

1090
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,460
small potatoes compared to the rest of what they do.

1091
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,460
Sure.

1092
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,460
Sure.

1093
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,780
So, but I'm not surprised to see it go.

1094
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:21,380
I mean, that's way too much expense and it's not even that interesting looking at the building.

1095
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:22,380
But it's in New York City.

1096
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,380
It's a big building.

1097
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,380
So there's a lot of stuff in New York City.

1098
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,820
It doesn't make it cool.

1099
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:29,660
It will be interesting to see who snatches it up.

1100
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:30,660
What?

1101
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:31,660
OK.

1102
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:34,140
Valid question.

1103
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:38,500
Probably some corporation with tons of money and corrupt practices to screw us over with.

1104
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,500
Bank of America.

1105
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,660
God, fuck Bank of America.

1106
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:42,660
Moving on, Loki.

1107
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:43,660
All right.

1108
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:48,200
So as we were talking about a little bit earlier, lots of games supposed to be coming out this

1109
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,780
fourth or first quarter for the Wii U.

1110
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:57,060
Although a lot of them, unfortunately, are just kind of like ports and stuff.

1111
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,260
But there are some good stuff.

1112
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:01,720
So let's talk a little bit about some things coming out.

1113
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:07,360
Need for Speed Most Wanted finally coming out to the Wii U in March on the 19th in the

1114
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:12,740
U.S. and or North America and in Europe on the 21st.

1115
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:13,740
Something really special about that.

1116
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:18,300
I don't even really know how they're supposed to, I guess, off screen play mode.

1117
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:23,460
So they're going to have that and then you can use it to select your cars and keeps track

1118
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,760
of your records or something like that.

1119
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,100
Also bundled, I guess, with the Ultimate Speed Pack, which is some piece of DLC, because

1120
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,780
that seems to be kind of the trend there.

1121
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:35,000
One of the games that was supposed to be highly anticipated for the first quarter, Aliens

1122
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,400
Colonial Marines, now doesn't really have a firm date.

1123
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:44,140
It's not going to be launching on the 12th with the actual game on the other consoles.

1124
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:48,660
Instead now it's just kind of TBA, you know.

1125
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:53,220
So hopefully that doesn't mean delayed past March, because that would be, you know, it's

1126
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:58,640
another big mature rated game for the console.

1127
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:03,360
The Amazing Spider-Man Ultimate Edition, you know, getting a port of a game that came out

1128
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:11,140
back in June, fantastic, and of course with DLC thrown in there as well.

1129
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:16,260
It's coming out in March, and then two games that were expected the first quarter, the

1130
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:21,700
Game & Wario and Wonderful 101, which, let's be honest here, two first party games, those

1131
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,100
aren't really that exciting.

1132
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:29,820
I mean, I know Game & Wario, they didn't really show a whole ton of that, and then the Wonderful

1133
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:32,780
101, sort of like Pikmin.

1134
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:38,520
Now those will begin to release date as far as the first half of 2013, so I will be willing

1135
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,800
to bet that that's probably going to be after first quarter.

1136
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,800
I think Wonderful 101 has its anticipators.

1137
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,700
I think you might be selling it short a little bit there.

1138
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,000
It's not going to sell that well.

1139
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,360
It's too niche, I'm sorry.

1140
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:56,280
Well, yeah, I think only because maybe the Wii U hasn't, you know, gotten out there as

1141
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,280
much as possible.

1142
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,120
It doesn't matter, the genre, I think it's going to be too niche.

1143
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:04,260
It's just, it's a niche appeal, I mean, to that.

1144
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:05,260
That's what's going to happen.

1145
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:08,780
And of course, nothing even mentioned yet.

1146
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:14,420
I think Wii Fit U is also supposed to be first half of 2013 as well, so April, May, June,

1147
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:15,420
there you go.

1148
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,500
You got your four title, or three titles there.

1149
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:23,580
One title is confirmed though for first quarter, and that's going to be LEGO City Undercover.

1150
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:28,740
That's actually launching on the Wii U in March, on the 3DS in April.

1151
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:32,720
Pretty much the only game that I was actually looking forward to at all.

1152
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:33,720
So there's that.

1153
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:37,600
And then for the 3DS, there's going to be Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon, which is coming

1154
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,000
on the 24th of March.

1155
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,800
So I want to say, well of course Fire Emblem in February, I want to say though that they

1156
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:50,720
haven't really announced any other 3DS titles, other than Smash Brothers, but that's just

1157
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,320
kind of like, hey, we're working on Smash Brothers, but they haven't really announced

1158
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:58,740
anything else for second quarter, first party I think.

1159
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:03,660
Oh, Brain Age Concentration Train, I think that's also February.

1160
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,860
Pokemon XY, but that's the end of the year.

1161
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:12,460
Well Pokemon, there's a Pokemon Mystery Dungeon game that's coming out at the end of March

1162
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:13,460
as well.

1163
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:18,940
But yeah, Pokemon XY would be the fourth quarter.

1164
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:23,980
So that's pretty much it, but once again, it's a lot of stuff that's ports, I mean unless

1165
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:28,720
you're, I mean I don't know, I don't know a lot of people would be really anticipating

1166
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:35,120
getting a game like this, unless this is your only console or something, I just don't see

1167
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:39,520
people going, oh I need to get Need for Speed, you know, it's not going to be a really big

1168
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:44,160
thing unless, you know, I mean there are really no racing games aside from Sonic and Sega

1169
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:51,120
All-Stars Racing, so that might be kind of good if you're into that.

1170
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,380
But yeah, it's a lot of ports.

1171
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:55,840
So that's the only thing that has me worried, is this isn't going to drive, I mean Lego

1172
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:59,280
City Undercover could drive some console sales because that's a pretty cool looking game,

1173
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:04,720
but it's not, there's no games that really scream, oh my god, I have to get a Wii U now.

1174
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,080
Well the Need for Speed thing, I don't think this is coming up on our show, or else I might

1175
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:12,200
be duplicating something, I hope not, but I remember reading something about the whole,

1176
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:16,400
that the Wii U version of Need for Speed will let you do the co-op, where you both drive

1177
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,640
and want to use on the gamepad and want to use on the TV, and I got to admit, that's

1178
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,980
pretty rad.

1179
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:25,340
You know, that they're able to install like that fully functional two player using the

1180
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:29,480
Wii U, that is something you're not going to see on the other systems.

1181
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,660
For what it's worth, I think that's a neat feature.

1182
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:38,980
I'll give that to them I guess, but once again though, it's not like, oh my god, that's really

1183
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:45,060
going to sell it for me, it's just, I don't know, it's sad that Lego City, let's not sell

1184
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:51,520
Lego City undercover that short, I mean it's a pretty awesome looking game, but I just,

1185
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:56,520
I don't know, I don't know if it's really going to be enough.

1186
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:02,000
Alright well moving on to another story, this is not about a Wii U release, but a Wii release,

1187
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,600
like you know, basic Wii, which you know, obviously a lot of people still own the Nintendo

1188
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:10,560
Wii, and it's not like your Wii U can't play Wii games, by the way I also transferred all

1189
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,680
my data from the Wii to the Wii U this week, it was pretty painless.

1190
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:18,860
So now I can play my virtual console games with the HDMI collection, woo hoo!

1191
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:23,220
But I really wish, sorry I'll get to the story eventually, I need to rant though, I really

1192
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:28,820
wish because this pisses me off that virtual console is too stupid for this, why doesn't

1193
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:35,700
the system know to automatically side letterbox or put into the right aspect ratio the virtual

1194
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,080
console games?

1195
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,600
Why does it still force them to widescreen?

1196
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:44,220
Why can't it know to script, because I can set it on my TV, sure, but that's such a pain

1197
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:48,440
in the ass, why can't when I boot up Zelda, which is a 4.3 game, like Zelda was not in

1198
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:52,860
widescreen on the NES, why can't it just know, oh, flip the resolution back to 4.3?

1199
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:57,800
Because they didn't program it in, because they cut corners.

1200
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,140
Well that's stupid and I hate it.

1201
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:06,580
It's just the same reason why they couldn't reprogram, you know, the emulator to run on

1202
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:07,580
your gamepad.

1203
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,160
But that's supposed to be coming, so they're developing it after that.

1204
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,640
Oh, that'd be nice that you'd have to buy an enhanced version of the fucking game they

1205
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:15,640
already have.

1206
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:18,640
I, no, that won't be happening.

1207
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,640
It won't be happening?

1208
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,640
It won't be happening.

1209
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,640
Are we absolutely sure of that?

1210
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,640
Because I bet it's gonna happen.

1211
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,040
It won't be happening.

1212
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:28,400
Look at the virtual console games I have on 3DS, I have not bought anything that wasn't

1213
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:34,160
free or not available, like I have a couple Game Boy games, those weren't available before.

1214
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,160
That's it.

1215
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,260
Maybe I have maybe two Game Boy games.

1216
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:42,380
I'm just saying, I bet you they're gonna do that kind of crap, because they tried to pull

1217
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:48,780
that shit with, are they still releasing those 3DS games, the retro ones that are in 3D now?

1218
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:50,540
They kind of like say, ah, fuck it.

1219
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:53,340
There's non-3D ones, all the Mega Man games, that was a big deal, remember?

1220
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:56,620
Yeah, I understand that, but are they doing those, remember how they're like Excitebike

1221
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,620
and stuff like that?

1222
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,780
I don't think there's been one in a while.

1223
00:58:58,780 --> 00:58:59,780
There were a few.

1224
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:02,740
They're like, ah, fuck it, no one's buying them, you know.

1225
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,280
It was like Xevious and Urban Champion and like all these, you know, interesting ones,

1226
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,200
but I haven't seen one in a little while.

1227
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:11,700
Anyhow.

1228
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Yeah, I thought, I thought we were gonna get like Zelda and 3D and stuff.

1229
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I guess not.

1230
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I guess it was too hard.

1231
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,680
Anyway, back to what I was originally going to talk about, a Wii game coming out on the

1232
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,680
Wii U.

1233
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:27,200
XSeed has decided to bring over Pandora's Tower to the Wii.

1234
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:32,520
Now this is important because this was the last Operation Rainfall, you guys remember

1235
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:37,540
that, those last of the three Op Rainfall games that, you know, Nintendo was never going

1236
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:41,540
to bring over here and then they finally brought out Xenoblade Chronicles, although it had

1237
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:46,860
that horrible, horrible GameStop exclusive thing, but you could order it from Nintendo.com,

1238
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:47,860
whatever.

1239
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:50,980
They, XSeed brought out The Last Story, which did very well for them.

1240
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:56,540
So now XSeed seems to be kind of our champion, that is kind of, didn't you predict that somebody

1241
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:59,620
like them might be the ones that ultimately step up and do this like a while ago?

1242
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:00,620
No.

1243
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:03,200
It's easier Ignition or XS game localization.

1244
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,860
So here they go, they're stepping up and putting out Pandora's Tower.

1245
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:10,980
Now it's going to be interesting to see how this does when the Wii U is what's really

1246
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:15,460
being pushed right now, but a lot of folks thought that Last Story, when it got price

1247
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:20,560
cuts 20 bucks, made a great pickup game for people to get with the Wii U, because again,

1248
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:21,880
you know, why not?

1249
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,560
You can use the backwards compatibility, very easy.

1250
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:27,680
So, any interest in Pandora's Tower, Loki?

1251
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,680
No.

1252
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:30,240
Too late?

1253
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:34,340
I don't play anything on my Wii, and actually it's funny, we booted up the Wii because Nelly

1254
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,560
was going to like play some more Animal Crossing.

1255
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:42,020
So I charged, I charged our controllers and...

1256
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:43,020
Animal Crossing.

1257
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:44,020
Sorry, I'm eating.

1258
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:45,700
Animal Crossing is on 3DS.

1259
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:46,700
That's a game coming out.

1260
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:47,700
No.

1261
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:48,780
But it's not dated.

1262
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:49,780
It's out in Japan.

1263
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:54,000
Yeah, that's a fourth quarter game, that's going to be sad that it's gotten that delayed.

1264
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,320
I don't think it can be.

1265
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,380
It's got to be sooner than that.

1266
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:59,940
Probably, could be a May game.

1267
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:00,940
We'll see.

1268
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:05,860
But I mean, seriously though, we forgot all about it because it was that, you know, highly

1269
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:09,700
anticipated that we completely forgot about the game.

1270
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,700
I don't know.

1271
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:15,820
What's it called?

1272
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:18,740
Animal Crossing Jump Out or something like that?

1273
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:19,740
Animal Crossing Jump Out.

1274
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:24,260
No, it's like Animal Crossing, it's the same fucking game on 3DS.

1275
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:25,260
I don't know.

1276
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:26,260
Occupy Nooks.

1277
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:27,260
I wish.

1278
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:28,260
That'd be great.

1279
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,260
That would be great.

1280
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:30,260
All right.

1281
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:31,260
Moving on.

1282
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:32,260
More news.

1283
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:36,660
Well, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.

1284
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:39,340
Now you know that you play as Raiden in that, right?

1285
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:45,180
Well, that's not what Kojima originally wanted, but he did let go of the story writing so

1286
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:47,220
that he could focus on production.

1287
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:54,100
He wanted it to be Gray Fox, who, as we all know from Metal Gear Solid, and he was a character

1288
01:01:54,100 --> 01:02:00,520
that had a lot of crap happen to him and a very, very crazy story if you'd followed

1289
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:05,940
the MSX Metal Gear games and, you know, really were a fan of the series.

1290
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:09,500
But he said, no, we're going to let the kids play, and they went Raiden, and they went

1291
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:12,820
hack and slash, so let's go with Raiden.

1292
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:16,620
It would have been so awesome to have a game with Gray Fox, don't you think?

1293
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:20,420
Instead, he gets stepped on by Metal Gear Pooh.

1294
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:21,420
Sad trombone.

1295
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:27,500
You know, it's funny, I actually forgot to mention, I played Anarchy Reigns during my

1296
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,460
game week this week, and it was very subpar.

1297
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:31,460
Really?

1298
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:38,220
Which sad me, because I love Platinum Games, and it was just, it was a mess.

1299
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:39,900
It just not set up well at all.

1300
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:43,980
I mean, there's no story, which is fine, I find no story being in there, but it was confusing

1301
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:47,900
on what the hell he had to do, and the gameplay was just kind of like, eh.

1302
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:50,420
It was like, Madworld was so much better.

1303
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:55,300
Why is, you know, Jack having to do this crap?

1304
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:59,620
Jack's fun to play in HD though, it was fun to play as that character, but it's just,

1305
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:01,140
I just didn't know what the fuck was going on.

1306
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:05,780
But I hope that that's not the case with Metal Gear Rising, but I think Metal Gear Rising

1307
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:06,780
looks pretty awesome.

1308
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:11,380
Well, also there was a comment regarding the trailer that might be Metal Gear Solid 5,

1309
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:12,380
The Phantom Pain.

1310
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:13,380
Oh yeah, that thing.

1311
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:18,580
Yeah, Kojima said that he really liked the trailer and the lighting, it was very good.

1312
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:20,580
Oh, you.

1313
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:25,580
Metal Gear Rising Revengeance is gonna be out on February 22nd, so keep your eyes open

1314
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:27,580
if you are interested.

1315
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:31,580
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out very

1316
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:32,580
soon.

1317
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:34,180
There's not much this week.

1318
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:40,940
It's pretty much just Ni No Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch on PS3 this week, which is

1319
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:41,940
not bad.

1320
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:44,300
I mean, it's supposed to be a pretty awesome PlayStation 3 game.

1321
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:49,100
Yeah, I want to check that out, but I don't know about the 60 bucks, though.

1322
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,900
I think I might rent it or wait for President.

1323
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:53,220
The reviews have said it's been worth it.

1324
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:54,220
Really?

1325
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:59,380
I mean, they said it's basically, what was the comparison I had?

1326
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:03,180
It was Dragon Quest with all the stuff that you hated from Dragon Quest ripped out of

1327
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:04,180
it.

1328
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:05,180
Huh.

1329
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:08,140
So, you know, that sounds pretty awesome.

1330
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:09,340
The demo didn't convince me.

1331
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:12,340
I didn't hate it like Bobby did, but it didn't convince me.

1332
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:15,460
Although the graphics were great.

1333
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:19,540
The only other thing that's coming out this week is a Sims 3 expansion pack, 70s, 80s,

1334
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:20,540
and 90s stuff.

1335
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:25,620
Do people still play Sims 3?

1336
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:26,620
Somebody must be.

1337
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:30,020
They still have a ton of fucking expansions coming out for the thing, so I don't understand

1338
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:31,020
why.

1339
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:32,020
Go to Ford.

1340
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:33,020
And also, apparently, that's it.

1341
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:37,260
Alright, going to Japan, Hitman Absolution on the Xbox 360.

1342
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:41,220
Yes, this is the Japanese version, making its way out on January 24th, as well as a

1343
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:44,820
game called Instant Brain, but that's a price reduction that was already out before.

1344
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:48,700
That is going into Cave, the best series, because that is a cave game.

1345
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:49,700
Those are the Xbox 360.

1346
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:53,060
Going to the PlayStation 3, things are a little bit bigger over there.

1347
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:56,940
Nobunaga Yoyobu online 10th anniversary box.

1348
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:59,800
I had no idea Nobunaga online was 10 years old, but there you go.

1349
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,700
That is out on the PlayStation 3 this week.

1350
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:03,620
Also Hitman Absolution there.

1351
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:07,620
Bleach Soul Ignition getting a price reduction as far as new games go.

1352
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:16,220
Heavy Fire Shattered Spear and Kamisama to Unmekikakume no Paradox in regular and limited

1353
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:19,060
edition and a Famitsu pack limited edition.

1354
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:20,060
That's god something.

1355
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:23,740
I'm trying to see, let's see if this is a game that we know over here.

1356
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:26,860
Oh, hold on, we wouldn't know that from the limited edition art.

1357
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:28,500
Let me look at regular edition.

1358
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:31,940
I'm trying to see if this is a game I recognize at all.

1359
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:34,340
I don't recognize it with the box art.

1360
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:37,700
Oh, it looks like a Disgaea Tactics-y type of game.

1361
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,900
Yeah, it's a Tactics game.

1362
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:41,300
I bet it's based on anime or something.

1363
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:42,300
With maids.

1364
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:43,300
Some of you in chat will know.

1365
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:44,300
Well, of course.

1366
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:45,300
Yeah.

1367
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:48,020
Somebody in chat, I bet, knows more about that.

1368
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:49,020
Mag.

1369
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:50,020
Remember Mag?

1370
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:51,020
Is also getting a price reduction.

1371
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:52,380
Goes into PlayStation 3 the best.

1372
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:54,820
Again, those are Japanese releases.

1373
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,260
Look at the handhelds really quick.

1374
01:05:56,260 --> 01:06:01,060
On the PlayStation Vita, pretty busy week actually, Demon Gaze.

1375
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:08,460
Yankai Totsuki Monster Monpiece, as well as Sakurosou no Pet no Kanojo.

1376
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:10,700
I'm assuming that's a pet sim game.

1377
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:11,700
All on the Vita.

1378
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:12,700
I don't know.

1379
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,500
It sounds about little girls.

1380
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,700
On the Wii U, nothing.

1381
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:20,340
No more Wii U games until January 31st is the next one.

1382
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:24,540
On the Nintendo 3DS, however, ooh, also nothing.

1383
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:26,300
Nothing really on the 3DS.

1384
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:30,940
Nintendo has very little activity over there until February 7th is the Dragon Quest VII

1385
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:31,820
remake.

1386
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:35,580
I'm sure a lot of people will be very excited about that on the 3DS, which I can't imagine

1387
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:36,860
they won't bring that over here.

1388
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:39,380
Nintendo's having a nap.

1389
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:40,380
Maybe a little bit.

1390
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:41,380
So there you go.

1391
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:42,380
Those are your Japanese releases.

1392
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:44,380
Well, we only have two things for the UK.

1393
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:48,380
On the 24th, we have Strike Suit Zero and the 25th Devil May Cry.

1394
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:49,700
Ah, yes.

1395
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:51,260
Devil May Cry.

1396
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:52,260
That came out this week.

1397
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:53,260
Yeah.

1398
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:54,260
I want to check it out.

1399
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,260
I do.

1400
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:56,260
All right.

1401
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:59,220
A couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

1402
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:00,220
Up first.

1403
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:01,220
Loki.

1404
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:02,220
All right.

1405
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:03,220
So let's talk about Majesco.

1406
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:09,580
Now, Majesco is, I would say, not long for this world anymore.

1407
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:13,660
And they've, you know, definitely had some problems.

1408
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:21,120
The company experienced a loss of 2.7 million as compared to, I guess, the 3.9 million loss

1409
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,020
the previous year.

1410
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:31,700
And they said the revenues are up to 132.3 million, but concluded with a net income of

1411
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:34,440
4.6 million down 2 million from last year.

1412
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:38,660
And let's be honest here, Majesco, they don't have a lot of games that they release anymore.

1413
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:42,580
Cookie Mama is not selling like it used to.

1414
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:44,680
Their last say, need investing mama, right?

1415
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,860
Was that the joke you made on Twitter?

1416
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:50,100
I don't remember.

1417
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,280
But I mean, come on.

1418
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:57,120
This is the company that decided that, hey, NBA Baller Beats is a good idea.

1419
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:03,920
So really, I mean, looking forward to what they have, they've only really got, they have

1420
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,120
the Young Justice license.

1421
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:09,440
So they've got that game coming out at the end of February.

1422
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,960
But I mean, Majesco is not one of those companies that puts out these really huge AAA games

1423
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:14,960
anymore.

1424
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:15,960
They just don't.

1425
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:22,680
And so it is kind of risky for them, because if these kind of non AAA titles don't sell

1426
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,160
well, then it kind of sucks for them.

1427
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:30,040
I mean, maybe Zumba is not selling as well as it used to, because I know they have Zumba.

1428
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:34,280
That's their kind of big license right now.

1429
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:35,960
But I don't know.

1430
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,240
No Zumba for the Wii U, I guess.

1431
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,040
So I mean, that's what's hurting them.

1432
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:43,320
So you talking about that made me look, I'm like, how much is NBA Baller Beats right now?

1433
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:45,200
Thirty four bucks on Amazon.

1434
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,680
Not going to fucking buy it.

1435
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,360
That's the game with the basketball.

1436
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:52,880
I am sitting here going, I bet I could pry that one from my boss.

1437
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,040
He's still got it in the packaging at his work.

1438
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,280
It's just sitting there because it's about to bring it over.

1439
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:58,580
Let's do some live gameplay stream.

1440
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:01,840
Who wants to watch League of Legends when you can watch NBA Baller Beats?

1441
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:02,840
Come on.

1442
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:05,080
Uh, we'll get Dark Soccer to play one.

1443
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:08,160
We'll call it two white guys play NBA Baller Beats.

1444
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,160
I'll play.

1445
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,160
There we go.

1446
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,520
There are no ballers and no beats.

1447
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:16,440
White men can't baller or beats.

1448
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:18,080
Plenty of white guys can beat.

1449
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,080
All right.

1450
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:24,640
And then, of course, their stock closed down under one dollar.

1451
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,160
They're down the 75 cents.

1452
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,720
So hey, if you think they're going to make a comeback, maybe it's something to buy some

1453
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:29,720
Majesco stock.

1454
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:30,720
75 cents.

1455
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:32,720
That's not bad.

1456
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:36,040
I wish it was much easier to just go online and buy some stock because I think it'll be

1457
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:40,440
fun to just go buy like, you know, 10 shares of Majesco just to say like, hey, I own part

1458
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:41,960
of Majesco.

1459
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:45,400
And then at the next shareholder meeting, you know, we can hold whoever accountable

1460
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:48,840
came up with NBA Baller Beats, although supposedly the game is fun.

1461
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:49,840
I should knock it.

1462
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:50,840
I haven't really played it.

1463
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:54,160
So they're going to try football one next.

1464
01:09:54,160 --> 01:10:00,800
I don't know how that would even work.

1465
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:04,920
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Launch Radio on Vogue Network

1466
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:07,520
dot com, use the passphrase yogurt.

1467
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,800
All right.

1468
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,540
Uh, one more story here.

1469
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:13,220
This is about the next PlayStation controller.

1470
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:16,780
You know, we had some rumors about this already, but now there's good.

1471
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:17,780
There's more rumors.

1472
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:18,780
No, no, no.

1473
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:19,780
That's good.

1474
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:21,020
They're just using this to illustrate the whole story.

1475
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:22,020
It is not the boomerang.

1476
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:23,020
People.

1477
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:24,020
It is not the boomer.

1478
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:25,020
It's coming back like a boomerang.

1479
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:30,620
But well, remember, remember when the boomerang thing was for the PlayStation three and everybody

1480
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:34,180
was like, no, that could have been comfortable.

1481
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:35,180
Who knows?

1482
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:39,940
I'm actually like, I mean, it looks so ridiculous.

1483
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:43,420
So bad, you know, it looks so ridiculous, but maybe it was comfortable.

1484
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:44,420
I mean, I don't know.

1485
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:46,420
It doesn't look like it would be very comfortable to me.

1486
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:47,420
Well, whatever.

1487
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:48,420
It's gone.

1488
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:49,420
Okay.

1489
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:50,420
But now.

1490
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:51,420
Okay.

1491
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:52,420
So we've heard about this move thing that might like actually be like a transformer

1492
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:56,020
and won't won't won't into the controller, right?

1493
01:10:56,020 --> 01:11:01,580
But that's not what the latest rumors are, apparently, uh, according to a senior game

1494
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:08,100
studio in a conversation with CVG, uh, Sony is going to mix up the dual shock design.

1495
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:12,980
There's going to be biometric sensors on the grips and an LCD touch screen because,

1496
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:16,340
you know, that's, that's what everything's got to have now is a fricking touch screen.

1497
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:21,100
Um, apparently they are trying to emulate the same user interface philosophies as the

1498
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:23,180
PlayStation Vita.

1499
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:26,340
Look, I like the Vita and all.

1500
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:27,340
Okay.

1501
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:28,340
The touch screen's cool.

1502
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:32,100
The two analog sticks are cool, but the rear touch pad, let it go.

1503
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:34,100
Stop trying to make rear touch pad happen.

1504
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:35,100
Stop.

1505
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:39,860
Don't you understand that reaching around is like, you know, it has some bad connotations

1506
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:40,860
to that.

1507
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:47,060
I mean, it's just even in DJ max, people who really like reaching around, even in DJ max,

1508
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:49,420
which I think does it better than most of the Vita games.

1509
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:54,060
Like I'm just like, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off.

1510
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:59,940
Anyhow, I can get, I thought for a second there, there were, instead of, you know, leading

1511
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:04,460
up to, Oh yeah, we're doing all the, we're mimicking the control interface of the Vita.

1512
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:07,300
It was going to be, we're maybe in the control interface of the Wii U.

1513
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:11,820
I mean, cause that's basically, it's like, ah, we can't think of anything to do.

1514
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:16,460
So we're going to try to emulate Nintendo because we think they're, we don't even know

1515
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:18,700
if that stuff's going to even take off on the Wii U.

1516
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:22,820
I mean, it's just, and I thought the whole thing is you wanted to push the Vita because,

1517
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:25,860
Hey, the Vita could be a second screen for these consoles or something.

1518
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:28,300
You need a reason to sell these things.

1519
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:33,500
Now, let's not say this would be a pretty awesome thing if they decide, Hey, the next

1520
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:37,660
gen console, it is going to be the Wii U that's going to be, or yeah, it is going to be Wii

1521
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:37,660


1522
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:41,100
No, it's going to be the Vita that they throw into the box.

1523
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:46,260
Like it comes with a Vita, you've got a Vita and you've got the PlayStation four, boom,

1524
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:47,700
right there, portable.

1525
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:52,260
And you know, you've got your console and you can take your controller when you go.

1526
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:53,820
I mean, cause I'm wrong.

1527
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:58,780
I bet it'd be pretty awesome if you could take that Wii U game tablet and stream games

1528
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:01,900
from a wifi spot somewhere else in the world.

1529
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:05,740
Kinda already do with the PlayStation three and the PSP for God's sake.

1530
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:05,980
Yeah.

1531
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:10,820
So wouldn't it be kind of awesome if you could do that or if you could, you know, play virtual

1532
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:12,340
console games on there, you can take that.

1533
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:16,900
I mean, it's a little bit big, but come on PS one classics and PS two classics, I'm talking

1534
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:19,460
about like the Wii U I'm just saying, you know, wouldn't it be awesome if you could

1535
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:20,500
do that with the Wii U controller?

1536
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:26,060
Um, you know, like, and again, it's pretty big, but people carry tablets around, so why

1537
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:26,260
not?

1538
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:27,020
All right.

1539
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:31,660
Regardless of whether this current rumor is factor crap or whatever, do you, how do you

1540
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:36,540
feel about them redesigning the dual shock for all practical purposes at the point we're

1541
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:40,220
at now throwing out the six axis and everything, you know, the PlayStation three controller

1542
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:45,260
you get now is a very tiny evolution from the original PlayStation controller.

1543
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:47,500
I mean, really, I mean, granted.

1544
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:47,820
Okay.

1545
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:50,140
I guess the analog sticks came a little later.

1546
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:54,140
The very, very first PlayStation controllers didn't have them, but still the, the, the

1547
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:59,420
core of that controller has not changed that much since the beginning.

1548
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:01,580
It's like, if it's, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

1549
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:03,660
I mean, seriously, I, I like the design now.

1550
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:06,620
So how do you feel about biometric sensors?

1551
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:07,420
I don't give a shit.

1552
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:12,540
I think it's honestly, I'll stick with my PC gaming regardless.

1553
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:16,060
I think it's gonna be a gimmick if biometric sensors are on the six axis.

1554
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:21,260
Um, yeah, it is a gimmick, but you know, it's a gimmick that also a lot of cell phone games

1555
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:25,900
and a lot of stuff, you know, uses, uh, yeah, no one really uses six axis anymore, but even

1556
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:29,900
like, it seems like a lot of the stuff that Sony has been doing lately has just been to

1557
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:34,540
kind of mimic, I mean, cause even with the, we, everybody got into the emotion gaming

1558
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:38,700
right after the, we, Oh yeah, we've been working on the move controller since, you know, a

1559
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:39,580
long time ago.

1560
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:41,100
You know, come on.

1561
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:42,460
It just, it never took off.

1562
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:45,820
And now, you know, some of these patents that we see look really ridiculous.

1563
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:49,340
I mean, no one's going to fucking strap move controllers to your feet and do like a flip

1564
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:50,780
kick in your goddamn living room.

1565
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:51,580
No, it's going to do that.

1566
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:56,060
So they need to come up with a new, they need to come up with something new.

1567
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:57,580
They need to come out with the wow factor.

1568
01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:01,260
Cause if you're fucking emulating someone else or doing the same shit you're doing now,

1569
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:02,140
no one's going to care.

1570
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:03,980
No one's going to be like, why do I have to buy this?

1571
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:05,660
I can already fucking do that now.

1572
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:08,620
That's really what it comes down to is the wow factor.

1573
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:10,380
That's what's going to sell your console.

1574
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:11,180
All right.

1575
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:14,540
Let's travel back in time to a time when you know what?

1576
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:17,420
The controller, it was a stick and a button and you liked it.

1577
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:17,980
That's it.

1578
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:19,260
One stick, one button.

1579
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:20,700
Hey, we have more buttons for this one.

1580
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:21,020
All right.

1581
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:25,100
Maybe this game isn't quite that old, but it's still a classic.

1582
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:29,180
So let's dive into the gaming vault where dark soccer is going to pick out an oldie

1583
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:32,700
moldy video game and say, Hey, play it.

1584
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:33,820
Cause it's cool.

1585
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:35,020
You probably forgot about it.

1586
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:35,900
It is a cool one.

1587
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,660
And probably not many people have seen it.

1588
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:43,660
Um, the classic game, um, in Japan was called, um, Zexex.

1589
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:45,260
I think I'm pronouncing it right.

1590
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:47,740
Cause it's X E X E X over here.

1591
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:49,420
We had it as Oreos.

1592
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:54,060
It was, uh, it came out in 1991, a side schooling shooting game, and it was actually really

1593
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:55,260
unique for its time.

1594
01:15:56,060 --> 01:16:00,700
Uh, Konami was really influenced by a lot of stuff that, um, Irem put out.

1595
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:04,620
It actually has the influences from R-Type, which everyone knows R-Type is among one of

1596
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:05,820
my favorite games.

1597
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:12,620
And, um, the tentacle mechanics that came from X-Multiply, it did not at all get a home

1598
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:18,220
release until it came out with Salamander portable that came out on the PSP, which,

1599
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:21,260
um, somebody in this room enabled me to get that game for my husband.

1600
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:21,980
Thank you, Loki.

1601
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:28,220
Um, it actually, it's, it's really, really an amazing shooter.

1602
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:34,140
Um, it had some, um, really, um, interesting, um, mechanics.

1603
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:39,900
Um, what happened with this one, like I said, it's similar to R-Type and X-Multiply.

1604
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:45,260
You play a ship called the flintlock that has this detachable orb called a flint and

1605
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:47,820
it acts sort of like, um, R-Type's force.

1606
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:55,180
Um, so you can get power ups to, uh, uh, boost, uh, Flint's power, your movement, your, uh,

1607
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:57,180
changing your weapon, increase your life count.

1608
01:16:57,980 --> 01:17:02,220
But, um, there are a bunch of changes that came out though in the non-Japanese versions.

1609
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:07,020
Um, some of them being, they removed all but one of the upgradable weapons and they changed

1610
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:07,900
the enemy patterns.

1611
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:14,780
Um, for different weapons, um, in, in the US, um, there was only the proton laser.

1612
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:20,620
Um, in the Japanese version, you start with a proton laser and then you get a homing laser,

1613
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:26,220
a shadow laser, a round laser, a spiral laser, which is a lot like the Gradius ripple, um,

1614
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:29,820
a search laser that's a kind of like a homing laser and a ground laser.

1615
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:36,860
It's very similar to, um, the, uh, the fire one that would travel across the floor from R-Type.

1616
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:41,900
And so basically the story of the game, you have to save the princess named Irene from

1617
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:47,020
the East, uh, from the planet East Square from an evil dude named Klaus.

1618
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:50,860
And there's different cut scenes and she's crying for help and she's tortured.

1619
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:57,420
And so you have to, um, basically, uh, go through the game and there's naked people

1620
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:58,860
in the ending of the game, just saying.

1621
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:07,660
But, but the big thing about, um, Zexix that I thought was really

1622
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:13,180
amazing and Rob, you can see this right in front of you, is, um, the level design.

1623
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:17,660
I mean, for 1991, I mean, this, the backgrounds look like shit right out of Tron.

1624
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:21,820
I mean, seriously, you've got, uh, very.

1625
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:23,580
Well, I like the little tentacle shots.

1626
01:18:23,580 --> 01:18:26,700
The thing does like it shoots out of these little 10.

1627
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:28,940
I actually had never really heard of this game.

1628
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:35,740
So Zexix is a really, I definitely see the Gradius inspired-ness in it, but, um,

1629
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:40,700
but a lot of the, the use of the flint is definitely like using the Force and R-Type.

1630
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:45,580
Um, the game is actually pretty challenging.

1631
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:47,180
It's a really difficult game.

1632
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:53,260
And, um, I thankfully got to play, um, a copy, uh, a while back off of the Supergun.

1633
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:57,820
Um, so this was ages ago.

1634
01:18:57,820 --> 01:19:02,700
I mean, this is actually a game that I don't know if it's, um, if they've gotten it to

1635
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:07,820
work on MAME yet, I'd have to check because Zexix is like, it's seriously one of the classics

1636
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:09,340
when it comes to, to shooters.

1637
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:15,580
It's not a bullet hell, definitely by any means, but it requires a lot of steady, um,

1638
01:19:15,580 --> 01:19:20,060
movement, a lot of, uh, really good reflex to make your way through it.

1639
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:22,380
And it's just an amazing game.

1640
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:27,740
So I would say, um, unfortunately, the only way to get ahold of it for any type of home

1641
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:31,340
version is getting the, um, PSP version.

1642
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:37,980
It's, uh, again, under the, um, Salamander portable, uh, and it's also, you can find

1643
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:40,300
this really inexpensive for PSP.

1644
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:41,180
It didn't cost a lot.

1645
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:45,980
I think when I bought it new, it was like 30 bucks and that's, you know, an import.

1646
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:48,460
And of course there's no region lockout on the PSP.

1647
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:52,060
So the chatters are saying it is in MAME.

1648
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:55,740
If you want to, if you want to turn to the dark side of the internet where everybody

1649
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:59,260
left, well, I haven't touched anything on MAME in ages.

1650
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:03,580
Dan and I are probably going to be making a new cab soon, but, um, but seriously, if

1651
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:07,900
anyone loves shooting games and especially if you're a fan of Konami shooters and love

1652
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:10,780
Irem shooters, you really owe it to yourself to play this one.

1653
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:12,060
ZEC6 is a great game.

1654
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:14,940
And that's it.

1655
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:15,980
All right.

1656
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:16,460
There it is.

1657
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:17,980
Your classic game of the week.

1658
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:18,480
ZEC6.

1659
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:21,180
Over here it was called Orius.

1660
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:22,860
Or Orius.

1661
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:26,540
If you happen to find an arcade cab of it, take a picture of it for me, please.

1662
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:28,380
All right.

1663
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:33,980
We are going to come back after a quick break here with more of Orange Lounge Radio, including

1664
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:37,580
a game we've talked about a bit here on Orange Lounge Radio, finally official this week.

1665
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:41,340
We're going to talk about Disney Infinity when we come back with more of Orange Lounge

1666
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:43,100
Radio right after this.

1667
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:56,300
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live with the 490th episode of our program

1668
01:20:56,940 --> 01:21:00,620
for this January the 20th of 2013.

1669
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:04,140
I hope those of you guys that have an extended weekend here in the States make the most of

1670
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:04,620
it.

1671
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:08,140
Let's let us not forget, though, the memory of Martin Luther King Jr.

1672
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:11,420
The reason why we have the weekend.

1673
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:15,180
In fact, I was going to play the I have a dream speech during the break tonight, but

1674
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:17,660
it's like 18 minutes, which is a little bit long for a break.

1675
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:22,780
But I encourage you all, you know, just as a little reminder of, uh, you know, what we've

1676
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:25,260
been through, uh, take a listen to it.

1677
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:29,740
Uh, also, uh, I wanted to talk getting back to games a little bit.

1678
01:21:29,740 --> 01:21:33,260
I promised, um, at the start of Part B because I forgot to talk about this during my gaming

1679
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:33,660
week.

1680
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:36,460
I want to talk about Wake Up Club on the PlayStation Vita.

1681
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:38,220
Have you guys heard about this game?

1682
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:39,900
And I use that term very loosely.

1683
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:43,820
Have you guys have you guys heard that a game at all or play they played that game?

1684
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:44,700
Heard about it?

1685
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:46,140
Anybody know?

1686
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:48,300
Okay, so I downloaded it today.

1687
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:49,500
Did you have you checked it out at all?

1688
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:49,900
No.

1689
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:50,460
Okay.

1690
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:54,780
It's this app for the PlayStation Vita, and it basically, you know, you can choose, you

1691
01:21:54,780 --> 01:22:00,220
know, from these different skins that are alarm clocks or whatever, like, um, you know,

1692
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:03,900
like a motor storm background or a journey background or whatever.

1693
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:07,020
And, you know, you can do the little alarm clock, but what you do is that when you're

1694
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:10,620
on the clock, you tell it what time you want to get up or whatever you put it to sleep.

1695
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:15,260
And then what happens is in the morning, it goes off, beep, beep, beep or whatever.

1696
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:19,180
And you have to actually tap your icon, which is moving around the screen.

1697
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:20,140
You have to tap it.

1698
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:22,460
And that signals to it that you've woken up.

1699
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:27,340
Now, what happens is that you've been paired up with 12 people who are getting up the same

1700
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:28,300
time issue.

1701
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:33,580
And so once you wake up, you can basically tap other people and it will send, I guess

1702
01:22:33,580 --> 01:22:35,100
it sends noises to their Vita.

1703
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:38,620
I don't, I've always been the first one up, so I don't know what happens, but like, I

1704
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:42,380
guess you tap the other icons and actually sends like voices to their Vita and tries

1705
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:42,860
to get them up.

1706
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:45,020
So it's like this whole like social network game.

1707
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:46,620
Wake up.

1708
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:47,020
Exactly.

1709
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:47,820
Wake up.

1710
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:48,700
Wake up.

1711
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:50,460
So calling it a game is a little weird.

1712
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:57,180
It's more of an app, but I got to say like taunted all you want, but the gamification

1713
01:22:57,180 --> 01:23:00,700
of an alarm clock is a pretty neat idea.

1714
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:01,420
I've got to say.

1715
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:07,980
And why, especially this is interesting on the Vita is that if you think about it, this

1716
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:13,500
gives people a reason to remember they have a Vita for real.

1717
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:17,020
I mean, there hasn't been a whole lot on the PlayStation Vita that like people have

1718
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:18,460
gotten that excited about.

1719
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:22,700
And I'm not saying like wake up club is the Vita system saver.

1720
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:27,980
No, nobody's going to buy a Vita just for silly wake up club, but something that gets

1721
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:35,580
the PlayStation Vita into your daily routine is a really smart move on Sony's part.

1722
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:37,500
I don't know if I'm giving them too much credit.

1723
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:41,900
Like if they really thought that that's what they were going to try to do, but if that

1724
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:46,220
was what they were going for, well played thoughts.

1725
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:51,180
I can see how it would be interesting and definitely it's a way to keep the Vita in

1726
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:56,060
the, like you said, putting it in someone's daily routine will keep it constantly in their

1727
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:56,460
eye.

1728
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:59,820
You know, like my, for example, I know it's not exactly the same, but having my iPhone,

1729
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:00,860
it's my alarm clock.

1730
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:05,580
You know, I keep in touch with my family through it, you know, texting all the time.

1731
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:07,740
I even use it at work now with text write off.

1732
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:12,700
But, but I mean, I'm saying, you know, it's, it's something that's part of my routine.

1733
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:15,740
So trying to incorporate the Vita as part of someone's routine actually gives people

1734
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:19,100
fresh and keeps it in the user's eyes.

1735
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:21,500
So they'll want to use it more often.

1736
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:22,940
I can see the logic behind it.

1737
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:24,460
I mean, and they gamified it.

1738
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:28,220
It's got trophies and you see the ranking of where you wake up.

1739
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:29,580
Well, now that's just silly.

1740
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:32,140
I know it's, it's a little silly, but it's silly.

1741
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:36,700
You know, it's more exciting than the iPhone alarm clock or the one that sits on your

1742
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:38,300
wall and goes, yep.

1743
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:41,820
But my iPhone alarm clock wakes me up to I'm sexy and I know it.

1744
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:43,820
Okay, that's true.

1745
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:45,340
I guess, I guess the Vita can't do that.

1746
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:47,580
You can make kitty noises.

1747
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:48,380
You can't have that.

1748
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:50,300
I can have kitty noises on my iPhone too.

1749
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:55,980
I can download a ringtone, but I can't necessarily, you know, wake other people up with it except

1750
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:56,700
for my husband.

1751
01:24:57,900 --> 01:25:02,940
Now I will say in my experience with wake up club, I still suffer from the rollover

1752
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:06,700
hit it to wake up, wake up the other people.

1753
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:07,100
All right.

1754
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:08,380
And then I go, it's cold.

1755
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:09,260
I'm going back to bed.

1756
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:12,460
You know, you made me, it hasn't really made me get up.

1757
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:13,980
You made me think of the alarm clock.

1758
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:16,860
Now that requires people to stand on it, to turn it off.

1759
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:17,740
Oh my God.

1760
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:22,140
And so I saw pictures on Tumblr of people like laying half in their bed with their face

1761
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:24,940
on the alarm clock to register the pressure.

1762
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:25,980
And they're still asleep.

1763
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:26,860
See, that would be me.

1764
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:28,300
I learned how to do it in my sleep.

1765
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:30,140
I turn off my iPhone all the time in my sleep.

1766
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:33,100
I need the Vita to give me an electric shock to really wake me up.

1767
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:35,820
Oh God.

1768
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:38,220
No, no, not the sounds of my mother waking me up.

1769
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:38,940
Rab.

1770
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:39,260
Rab.

1771
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:40,380
You're going to be late for work.

1772
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:41,100
Rab.

1773
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:41,580
That's it.

1774
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:42,300
That's what you need.

1775
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:44,940
If you get fired from your job, Rab, you're going to be homeless.

1776
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:46,780
Rab, you are not moving in here Rab.

1777
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:48,220
Rab.

1778
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:49,020
That's it.

1779
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:49,660
That's it.

1780
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:50,780
That's the, okay.

1781
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:53,980
This is a copyright orange on radio and me and Rab.

1782
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:57,980
This is your mom, the alarm clock.

1783
01:25:58,860 --> 01:26:00,140
That's what we need to invent Rab.

1784
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:01,180
Your mom, the alarm clock.

1785
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:06,620
All it is is whoever's mother going, get out of bed.

1786
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:07,740
It's time for school.

1787
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:12,460
No, actually at my house would be this and I have to hold this away.

1788
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:16,140
Jamie get out of bed.

1789
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:23,260
Now my throat hurts extra bad, but that would have been, um, my mom when I was in school.

1790
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:24,780
Neighbors are going to call the police.

1791
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:25,900
Sorry, Rab's neighbors.

1792
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:30,540
All right.

1793
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:31,740
That was my mom.

1794
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:32,780
That's wake up club.

1795
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:34,140
I just wanted to throw that out there.

1796
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:35,820
It is, it is a thing that happened this week.

1797
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:38,620
I forgot to talk about it because it's a game, but it's not.

1798
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:43,180
But you know, again, and Raginator in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, yeah,

1799
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:44,780
Rab, way too much credit.

1800
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:49,820
Whether it was a moment of genius amongst idiocy.

1801
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:50,860
I don't know.

1802
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:56,700
But all I'm saying is that if the Vita thinks of more things like this, let's gamify things

1803
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:57,500
that people do.

1804
01:26:58,140 --> 01:27:03,500
How about like an interactive cookbook, a recipe thing like, you know, recipes for bachelors.

1805
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:10,380
I would have to grow arms and smack my hand every time I say, I wonder what it'd be like

1806
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:11,900
if I put this in it.

1807
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:12,700
I can't bake.

1808
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:14,460
All right.

1809
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:15,740
Uh, let's go to some rapid fire news.

1810
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:18,700
Talk about some other video game news happening around the industry right now.

1811
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:19,900
I'm sorry for Rab's neighbors.

1812
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:21,260
It's all right.

1813
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:21,740
They'll deal.

1814
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:22,460
Logie.

1815
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:23,340
All right.

1816
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:28,540
Um, so let's talk a little bit about, uh, the survey that they sent out for call of

1817
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:35,260
duty and it's kind of, um, hinting at some stuff that may be available, um, for the next,

1818
01:27:35,980 --> 01:27:41,580
uh, iteration of it and includes like stuff, you know, saying, Hey, what kind of special

1819
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:43,180
things do you want at retail?

1820
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:47,420
So some of the stuff that, um, was, they came out of there, they were seeing a care package

1821
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:48,460
show pieces.

1822
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:52,540
Um, some of the things that they may include with the care package edition would be like

1823
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:53,980
a character of statuette.

1824
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:58,860
They send operational desktop century gun replica, which sounds fucking awesome.

1825
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:00,460
I would totally dig that.

1826
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:04,700
And then, um, there's a collectible sets featuring characters, vehicles, and scenery from the

1827
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:10,540
game, similar to like the hago or the halo mega block stuff, custom branded audio sound

1828
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:17,500
bar, lame custom branded gaming headset, also lame and custom branded wireless router.

1829
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:23,340
No, just don't operational desktop century gun.

1830
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:25,180
There's your winning, uh, pick right there.

1831
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:28,060
And, uh, they had some other pictures from it.

1832
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:32,620
Of course they took them down because of NDA, uh, they're saying also that, um, you know,

1833
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:36,300
that there might be a digital version to pre download to your console and then it'll be

1834
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:41,820
available to play at 1201 am on launch day, which is kind of cool if they did that.

1835
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:46,140
Um, and it says maybe that'll be something that'll be featured in next gen consoles,

1836
01:28:46,140 --> 01:28:50,380
being able to kind of pre download stuff like you can on steam, like steamer or a world

1837
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:52,060
of Warcraft did that with the expansions.

1838
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:53,900
Honestly, I don't know why they can't do that.

1839
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:57,900
I mean, they've got day one patches, you know, and stuff.

1840
01:28:58,860 --> 01:28:59,900
Well, let me put this away.

1841
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:04,220
Day one patches might not be a good way to go because let's say for example, you do that.

1842
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:09,020
Um, yeah, cause if they did with the console version, um, and you weren't able to connect

1843
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:10,780
online, it would never be able to play your game.

1844
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:15,500
But let's just say that they were able to lock that out to just the digital version.

1845
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:15,980
Why not?

1846
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:21,100
Why not have it built in where you can download the game and then piracy, you know, piracy

1847
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:23,580
is gone as far as print link before a release.

1848
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:25,260
I don't know.

1849
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:25,980
Sounds like a good idea.

1850
01:29:26,860 --> 01:29:31,180
Um, and then there's some, um, pretty good news here.

1851
01:29:31,180 --> 01:29:39,580
Uh, Skyrim, all the wonderful, uh, DLC that you've been missing on the PS3.

1852
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:40,940
It's finally coming.

1853
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:46,540
Um, Dragonborn, the latest expansion for the game, it's going to be hitting PC on February

1854
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:51,820
5th and then, uh, also in February, all the other expansions are going to be coming out

1855
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:54,620
as well on, uh, PS3.

1856
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:59,020
And I believe they're even offering them at half cost for the first.

1857
01:29:59,020 --> 01:29:59,900
Sorry, it's late.

1858
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:01,100
Sorry.

1859
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:02,700
It's not bad.

1860
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:09,100
I bought, I bought them all half off on, um, on PC and building the house and hearth fire

1861
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:11,660
is kind of cool, I guess.

1862
01:30:11,660 --> 01:30:12,460
Um, I don't know.

1863
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:16,380
I don't like the orphan kids saying, you know, Hey, you can adopt me.

1864
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:19,100
No, I'm not going to adopt you.

1865
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:22,060
Cause if it goes anything like Fable was, I never came home.

1866
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:24,140
And you can't kill the kids cause that's wrong.

1867
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:27,260
And you can't even do that in Skyrim.

1868
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:29,900
Although I'm sure, I'm sure somebody hacked it in.

1869
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:32,060
I'm sure some sicko hacked it.

1870
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:34,140
Of course you can do it on the PC.

1871
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:36,540
You see what PC gaming supports Dark Sakura?

1872
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:38,700
I wasn't paying attention.

1873
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:39,260
Sorry.

1874
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:39,980
Killing children.

1875
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:43,980
And for some reason, when I'd leave all of the women, all their clothes come off.

1876
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:45,900
I don't really know why that's happened.

1877
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:47,100
Sickos on the PC.

1878
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:47,740
I know.

1879
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:48,860
It's so weird.

1880
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:54,380
Also have a torture chamber with slave maidens, but Hey, I've got the PC sicko story to top

1881
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:56,380
all of this coming up, but hold on.

1882
01:30:56,380 --> 01:30:56,860
All right.

1883
01:30:56,860 --> 01:30:58,540
I think I need to get Skyrim now.

1884
01:30:58,540 --> 01:31:03,420
And then, uh, last but not least La Milana and Leisure Suit Larry are some of the titles

1885
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:09,020
that are included on the next, um, steam green light, including, and this is pretty cool.

1886
01:31:09,020 --> 01:31:15,820
They've got, um, let's see here, DLC quest, which honestly wasn't a very long game, but

1887
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:24,620
cool, uh, eat or masters of the broken world, Mac, um, the age of decadence, Yun pick and

1888
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:29,580
war for the overworld are some of the other titles that are going to be coming out.

1889
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:32,220
Um, let's see here.

1890
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:40,380
And, uh, a con a con Nero demon hunters, which I think, isn't that that, um, yeah, I want

1891
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:45,020
to see, isn't that the, uh, that new game that they're working on, uh, was it America

1892
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:45,820
McGee or something?

1893
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:49,980
I think that's that American McGee game, if I want to remember correctly.

1894
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:55,420
And then also a grow Brodo modeling app, which is actually, um, software.

1895
01:31:55,420 --> 01:32:01,660
And then the articity draft game design tool is another non gaming thing that got green

1896
01:32:01,660 --> 01:32:01,900
lit.

1897
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:07,820
So, um, just so you know, La Milana, that was a game that, you know, uh, dark Tetsuya

1898
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:09,900
used to write about a lot on orange launch radio.com.

1899
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:11,180
He was very excited about it.

1900
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:14,780
I actually went to dark Tetsuya and I said, could I get a quote, sir, about how you feel

1901
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:16,780
about La Milana getting the project green light?

1902
01:32:16,780 --> 01:32:17,740
And this is what he had to say.

1903
01:32:22,940 --> 01:32:27,340
That was an actual Kermit flail, by the way, that was an actual real deal Kermit flail.

1904
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:32,460
Just, you know, uh, I don't know if anybody was Kermit flailing over this more like the

1905
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:37,580
fuck, but, um, people are modding Alan wake on the PC.

1906
01:32:37,580 --> 01:32:39,660
Of course that's, that's what people do to PC games.

1907
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:40,700
They mod them.

1908
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:46,300
Um, but what, I guess apparently it wasn't supposed to be moddable.

1909
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:49,500
It was supposed to have permissions, licenses, whatever that ain't going to hackers going

1910
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:51,020
to hack hackers going to hack.

1911
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:52,300
And you got to love this.

1912
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:56,860
They, they did all 2.9 gigs, unraveled it, put it back together.

1913
01:32:56,860 --> 01:32:59,900
And what was the community tool that they put out?

1914
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:03,020
What did they put out in response to you'll never hack Alan wake.

1915
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:10,380
Somebody put a hello Kitty flashlight into Alan wake where the little flashlight will

1916
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:12,700
always be the little hello Kitty image.

1917
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:15,580
When it shines on the wall, you see, you can see the little bullet.

1918
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:19,180
Let me see if in the video, you get a little, a better shot to see it.

1919
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:20,060
You can kind of see it there.

1920
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:22,220
See hello, Kitty flashlight.

1921
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:23,420
That's awesome.

1922
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:25,740
Cause that's what my Alan wake needs.

1923
01:33:25,740 --> 01:33:26,860
And I can kill the bad guys.

1924
01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:30,860
Little shadows with hello, Kitty killing with cuteness.

1925
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:32,140
I can't.

1926
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:36,860
Well, this, I don't even know what the hell to say about this.

1927
01:33:36,860 --> 01:33:39,820
Uh, this community could have used a little bit of a cuteness.

1928
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:41,340
Cause this was just stupid.

1929
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:43,740
In fact, this is one of the stupidest things I've ever seen in gaming.

1930
01:33:43,740 --> 01:33:48,140
Like ever, uh, dark, dark, dark, dark Sakura.

1931
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:49,580
Did you see this?

1932
01:33:50,220 --> 01:33:50,780
Fuckery.

1933
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:57,260
This is the pre-order bonus for the European Australian island.

1934
01:33:57,260 --> 01:33:59,180
Riptide zombie bait edition.

1935
01:33:59,180 --> 01:33:59,500
What?

1936
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:00,540
It's a collector's edition.

1937
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:00,860
No, whatever.

1938
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:02,300
Not pre-order bonus, whatever.

1939
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:03,820
Severed limbs for everybody.

1940
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:04,860
Collector's edition.

1941
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:10,060
It is a severed torso of an apparently British female.

1942
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:14,860
And I'm only guessing that because she's got the little union Jack bra thing going

1943
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:20,780
for her, but she is all bloodified, decapitated, armless and limbless.

1944
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:22,300
It is gross.

1945
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:24,540
Who would want this in their house?

1946
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:31,820
And especially kind of fucking tacky to announce this type of thing.

1947
01:34:31,820 --> 01:34:36,300
The day that Joe Biden is sitting down with a video game industry to talk about, you

1948
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:40,380
know, what is there a correlation between that, blah, blah, blah.

1949
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:45,500
Now, before y'all correct me, I am aware it was the Europe and Australian pre-order

1950
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:46,140
bonus.

1951
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:50,700
So they were the ones to announce it, not the U S arm of the company.

1952
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:56,380
However, somebody finally figured, you know, maybe this is kind of tacky.

1953
01:34:56,380 --> 01:34:58,780
Maybe we don't really need this.

1954
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:01,740
Maybe, maybe this is just in bad taste.

1955
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:06,940
And so they came out and said, we sincerely regret this choice and we're committed to

1956
01:35:06,940 --> 01:35:09,260
making sure this will never happen again.

1957
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:13,180
Although does that what happens to the people that already pre-ordered it?

1958
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:13,820
Does this mean?

1959
01:35:13,820 --> 01:35:15,740
I don't know if they even say it won't happen again.

1960
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:17,740
They didn't say we're going to pull this.

1961
01:35:17,740 --> 01:35:18,860
We're not going to sell this.

1962
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:20,060
They don't mention that at all.

1963
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:22,220
They're just saying we won't do this again.

1964
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:25,740
Nothing to stop us from doing that.

1965
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:28,860
Nothing said that they're going to stop doing it now.

1966
01:35:28,860 --> 01:35:31,180
They just said, oh, well, we're not going to do it again.

1967
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:36,540
Alan alchemy in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says it's super sexed up and gross.

1968
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:38,380
It's for neckbeards to fat too.

1969
01:35:38,380 --> 01:35:39,740
See, that's the sick thing.

1970
01:35:39,740 --> 01:35:45,980
Like this is sick already, but then you have to realize because it is an inanimate object,

1971
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:47,820
somebody will stick their dick in it.

1972
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:53,180
And that makes it like 10 times, like a million times worse as if this could even get worse.

1973
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:55,820
You realize somebody's going to put their dick in it.

1974
01:35:55,820 --> 01:35:58,380
And it's just like, this is, this is too much.

1975
01:35:58,380 --> 01:35:59,820
That was a joke already made that.

1976
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:01,340
Yeah, just saying.

1977
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:06,060
Oh, but it doesn't end there.

1978
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:12,380
A new game was made this week by the encyclopedia dramatica forums.

1979
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:13,020
One of their members.

1980
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:13,740
Oh, go figure.

1981
01:36:15,580 --> 01:36:17,980
Called bullet to the head of the NRA.

1982
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:22,060
Yes, that is the name of the game bullet to the head of the NRA.

1983
01:36:22,060 --> 01:36:24,060
It is a first person shooter.

1984
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:29,500
If you want to call it that, that lets you, you just shoot NRA boss, Wayne LaPierre.

1985
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:39,500
The intent of this game was to do nothing, but to just piss people off and imagine encyclopedia

1986
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:44,220
dramatica releasing something that would just piss people off, quote, share this everywhere,

1987
01:36:44,220 --> 01:36:47,500
especially gun nut and anti-game websites.

1988
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:51,740
Also see if you can't send it to the NRA somehow, like through the feedback on their website

1989
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:52,540
or something.

1990
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:54,700
This is from forum user gizmo.

1991
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:59,980
Oh, 1942, who also is developing a game based on the Sandy Hook shooting.

1992
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:06,380
You will actually get to go to the Connecticut school and shoot kids because there's always

1993
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:08,540
going to be that guy on the internet.

1994
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:14,540
Dark Sakura, you look like you're about to just like, you're doing people, you're doing

1995
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:15,900
the SMH thing over there.

1996
01:37:15,900 --> 01:37:17,740
Like SMH.

1997
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:18,780
Shaking my head.

1998
01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:19,180
Oh.

1999
01:37:19,180 --> 01:37:20,460
Or SMGDH.

2000
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:21,500
Shaking my goddamn head.

2001
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:23,020
I just don't get people.

2002
01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:24,140
I really don't though.

2003
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:24,620
It's fine.

2004
01:37:24,620 --> 01:37:25,980
Well, here we are talking about it.

2005
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:27,900
So maybe the troll one, I don't know.

2006
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:28,620
Yeah, fuck them.

2007
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:29,740
It's an attention grab.

2008
01:37:29,740 --> 01:37:30,380
Nothing more.

2009
01:37:30,940 --> 01:37:34,460
But you know, you know, somebody's going to get this and be all, you know, his attention

2010
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:36,220
is going to grab Fox news.

2011
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:36,700
Yeah.

2012
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:43,020
But I like to file this, this stuff under the, uh, the banner of no incur now.

2013
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:43,900
No one important.

2014
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:50,780
Now somebody did point out this came out one day after the NRA had put out their own gun

2015
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:55,180
game, NRA practice range, which is available on the iOS.

2016
01:37:55,180 --> 01:37:57,340
It is rated for ages four and up.

2017
01:37:58,620 --> 01:37:59,820
Of course, that's all target.

2018
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:01,900
It's target practice, target practice.

2019
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:02,460
So it's okay.

2020
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:04,220
Here's a question, right?

2021
01:38:04,220 --> 01:38:07,260
I know this is rapid fire news and I'm not going very rapidly, but you know, there's

2022
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:08,460
a lot to say about this stuff.

2023
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:10,460
Would you let a four year old play point blank?

2024
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:17,100
Um, it's a gun game, but it's, it's carnival guns.

2025
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:22,860
It's, it's not, this is though, where my stance is with this is that if I were a parent,

2026
01:38:22,860 --> 01:38:26,300
I wouldn't let a child watch TV until they were older than five.

2027
01:38:27,660 --> 01:38:28,300
Good luck with that.

2028
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:31,580
That's what, that was our plan.

2029
01:38:31,580 --> 01:38:32,300
That didn't happen.

2030
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:36,220
I know plenty of parents who have been very successful with it just because, and I come

2031
01:38:36,220 --> 01:38:41,420
from that just because I've seen the difference of behavior with Becky's son when he's

2032
01:38:41,420 --> 01:38:46,300
allowed to play games and watch TV versus when he's limited access to playing games

2033
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:47,180
and watching TV.

2034
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:51,500
He's a lot happier of a kid when he gets to go outside and play more often.

2035
01:38:52,060 --> 01:38:58,380
So, um, I don't think I would allow, if I were a parent, I wouldn't allow TV or video

2036
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:02,780
games until they were old enough to actually have more of a comprehension factor attached

2037
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:03,100
to it.

2038
01:39:03,740 --> 01:39:04,380
That's just me.

2039
01:39:05,260 --> 01:39:07,100
You know, and I certainly wouldn't let it be a babysitter.

2040
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:11,340
Let's move on to some more rapid fire news, dark soccer.

2041
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:16,780
Um, well, you know how people were a little excited about Epic Mickey too?

2042
01:39:16,780 --> 01:39:21,580
Well, they were only a little excited because they only sold 270,000 copies in North America,

2043
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:26,060
which is about, oh, a million less than, uh, the first one did.

2044
01:39:26,620 --> 01:39:26,860
Yeah.

2045
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:28,780
The first one sold 1.3 million.

2046
01:39:28,780 --> 01:39:29,100
Yeah.

2047
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:29,900
Not even close.

2048
01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:30,860
Sorry.

2049
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:33,420
And the creator thinks they're going to do more.

2050
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:35,740
So, uh, that'd be great when Disney shuts them down.

2051
01:39:36,780 --> 01:39:44,540
Um, now there's also, um, six weeks of free, um, PS mobile games.

2052
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:47,020
It's going to be starting with Samurai Beatdown.

2053
01:39:47,580 --> 01:39:54,220
Um, you can get that on the PlayStation store and it's either for Vita or PlayStation certified

2054
01:39:54,220 --> 01:39:55,100
mobile devices.

2055
01:39:56,220 --> 01:40:01,180
And it's only going to be available in Japan, US, UK, Canada, France, Italy, Germany, Spain,

2056
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:02,300
and Australia.

2057
01:40:02,300 --> 01:40:04,140
So if you live in Zimbabwe, you're fucked.

2058
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:12,140
And then for fans of Shin Megami Tensei, um, Devil Summoner Soul Hackers is going to be

2059
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:13,820
out in the US in April.

2060
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:19,820
It's been set to release on 16th of April and, uh, nothing about our, uh, friends in

2061
01:40:19,820 --> 01:40:23,660
the UK if they're going to see anything, but, uh, who knows?

2062
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:31,820
It's also, um, a, uh, 3DS remake of the one that came out in the Sega Saturn in 1997.

2063
01:40:32,780 --> 01:40:33,020
Done.

2064
01:40:35,180 --> 01:40:35,500
All right.

2065
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:38,940
How about we go to the frugal question of the week?

2066
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:39,820
How about we?

2067
01:40:39,820 --> 01:40:40,460
How about it?

2068
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:41,180
How about it, huh?

2069
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:54,140
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, Google Plus at Orange Lounge Radio.

2070
01:40:54,140 --> 01:40:54,700
Put them together.

2071
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:55,980
You get frugal.

2072
01:40:56,860 --> 01:40:58,140
Here's our frugal question of the week.

2073
01:40:58,940 --> 01:41:01,340
We didn't talk about this story tonight, but I guess we will now.

2074
01:41:01,340 --> 01:41:05,740
A settlement was reached this week between the actor that portrayed Kevin Butler and

2075
01:41:05,740 --> 01:41:06,460
Sony.

2076
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:10,860
You may recall that the actor was spotted in a commercial for a tire store playing a

2077
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:12,140
Nintendo Wii.

2078
01:41:12,140 --> 01:41:14,220
This got us thinking about commercials and marketing.

2079
01:41:14,220 --> 01:41:16,300
That's really all there is to say on that story.

2080
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:17,900
Legal issues settled out of court.

2081
01:41:17,900 --> 01:41:18,620
What else is new?

2082
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:25,100
But since it got us thinking about commercials and marketing and like how, how, how big of

2083
01:41:25,100 --> 01:41:27,580
an impact does somebody like Kevin Butler really have?

2084
01:41:27,580 --> 01:41:33,020
So we went to frugal and we asked the listeners, has a gaming system or game commercial or

2085
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:36,460
advertising campaign ever worked on you?

2086
01:41:36,460 --> 01:41:39,900
Were it swayed you to make the decision to buy a game new?

2087
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:44,220
Was it something you experienced more in your youth or something you still find might tilt

2088
01:41:44,220 --> 01:41:45,180
your opinion today?

2089
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:49,500
Like I know a lot of us like we remember like Genesis does what Nintendo and some of those

2090
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:53,420
I'm just saying when PlayStation 4 comes out, they better bring him fucking back because

2091
01:41:53,420 --> 01:41:55,900
that that that's how you sell that shit.

2092
01:41:56,140 --> 01:41:59,740
Not creepy babies, but fucking Kevin Butler is saying, I'm back, bitches.

2093
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:00,860
Buy this shit.

2094
01:42:00,860 --> 01:42:01,260
Boom!

2095
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:02,940
I don't think that can happen now.

2096
01:42:02,940 --> 01:42:03,660
Why?

2097
01:42:03,660 --> 01:42:05,980
Because the whole legal stuff and all that.

2098
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:07,900
So throw enough money at him.

2099
01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:09,820
I'm sure he'll be like, oh, legal smeagle, whatever.

2100
01:42:10,940 --> 01:42:11,980
I'll put this in my pocket.

2101
01:42:11,980 --> 01:42:12,780
That's true.

2102
01:42:12,780 --> 01:42:13,340
Money talks.

2103
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:13,580
All right.

2104
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:18,780
Let's go to the folks on Facebook and Google and see if advertising campaigns ever actually

2105
01:42:18,780 --> 01:42:19,500
worked on them.

2106
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:20,940
We'll start with Tiger Claw on Facebook.

2107
01:42:21,740 --> 01:42:25,660
I've seen many commercials for the latest gaming consoles and neither one has swayed

2108
01:42:25,660 --> 01:42:26,460
me into buying one.

2109
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:31,100
I always believe the only way to make a decision whether to buy the console or not is to actually

2110
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:31,900
try it.

2111
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:33,340
Like the kiosks at the stores.

2112
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:38,380
Rageinator says as a kid in the early 80s before I became as jaded as I am today.

2113
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:38,780
Yeah.

2114
01:42:38,780 --> 01:42:43,420
But then again, commercials that were our marketing towards young kids typically work.

2115
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:48,860
Llama Juice says, look at it for the point of view as someone who isn't educated on video

2116
01:42:48,860 --> 01:42:49,980
games consoles.

2117
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:52,860
The average mom out there buying a game system for their kid.

2118
01:42:52,860 --> 01:42:53,980
They don't know the difference.

2119
01:42:53,980 --> 01:42:57,900
If they see more commercials for console A instead of console B, then they'll assume

2120
01:42:57,900 --> 01:43:00,060
console A is better on the flip side.

2121
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:01,820
Think about the commercials for the Ouya.

2122
01:43:01,820 --> 01:43:03,980
It's something that everyone was uneducated about.

2123
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:06,700
And then the ads for it got a mountain of people excited.

2124
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:10,460
That being said, as a kid, the commercials for the engage always got me.

2125
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:12,700
I wanted one of those things so badly as a kid.

2126
01:43:14,140 --> 01:43:15,980
You were a kid when the engage came out.

2127
01:43:15,980 --> 01:43:18,060
I was in my 20s commercials for the Ouya.

2128
01:43:18,780 --> 01:43:21,020
Yeah, I didn't know there were commercials for the Ouya.

2129
01:43:21,020 --> 01:43:22,220
Is that maybe online?

2130
01:43:22,220 --> 01:43:25,340
I don't think there's commercials for the Ouya at all.

2131
01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:26,940
I mean, there's the video.

2132
01:43:26,940 --> 01:43:31,260
Probably because people were uneducated about it.

2133
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:33,420
And then the ads for it got a mountain of people excited.

2134
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:33,820
I don't know.

2135
01:43:36,860 --> 01:43:41,020
Dark Tetsuya said, I did go to see the wizard when I heard Super Mario Brothers 3 was going

2136
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:41,740
to debut in it.

2137
01:43:41,740 --> 01:43:42,940
Does that count?

2138
01:43:42,940 --> 01:43:47,020
That was like the best product placement ever done in the history of ever.

2139
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:47,260
Yeah.

2140
01:43:47,260 --> 01:43:50,860
I have to admit that I was interested.

2141
01:43:50,860 --> 01:43:55,100
Who didn't get a gigantic nerd boner when they went and saw the wizard and saw Super

2142
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:57,500
Mario 3 like the first footage?

2143
01:43:57,500 --> 01:44:00,060
There has never been a better promotion ever.

2144
01:44:00,060 --> 01:44:01,660
I firmly believe that.

2145
01:44:01,660 --> 01:44:06,460
And the Power Glove, which by the way, I'm sorry, the Power Glove was a piece of shit.

2146
01:44:06,460 --> 01:44:07,180
It really was.

2147
01:44:07,180 --> 01:44:09,020
It was so shitty.

2148
01:44:09,020 --> 01:44:11,980
That and the U Force were both shitacular shit devices.

2149
01:44:11,980 --> 01:44:13,820
I already had a Power Glove when I saw that movie.

2150
01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:14,780
And wasn't it shit?

2151
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:15,580
Yes, it was.

2152
01:44:15,580 --> 01:44:17,420
It was absolute fucking shit.

2153
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:19,660
But it's so bad.

2154
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:23,820
It was like, this is cool, except wait, I can't do shit with this.

2155
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:28,540
You see the U Force in the little print ad, like playing punch out, and you think, oh

2156
01:44:28,540 --> 01:44:29,260
my God.

2157
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:31,580
Nintendo, bring back the Power Glove.

2158
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:35,740
I mean, seriously, that would be fucking awesome if it worked right.

2159
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:40,060
When they have haptic gloves, they need to have the Power Glove come back.

2160
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:44,300
Oh, the listeners are going to hate me for this, but you know how we always say time

2161
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:44,940
to penis.

2162
01:44:44,940 --> 01:44:47,420
My concern with the Power Glove is time to fist.

2163
01:44:49,660 --> 01:44:50,060
We know.

2164
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:54,140
It's so bad.

2165
01:44:54,140 --> 01:44:55,500
It's ripped for her pleasure.

2166
01:44:57,900 --> 01:45:01,900
Moving on to a comment from Burr brought these brain bleach.

2167
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:04,220
Now make it stop.

2168
01:45:04,220 --> 01:45:06,220
Burr says it was the you know what?

2169
01:45:06,220 --> 01:45:10,460
It was the Kevin Butler ads along with the price cut that came with the release of the

2170
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:14,860
slim that actually did help sway my opinion on the PlayStation 3 and finally got me to

2171
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:15,500
pick one up.

2172
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:21,180
To me, it was the moment that Sony finally meant business and let the games do the talking.

2173
01:45:21,180 --> 01:45:26,140
The original PlayStation 3 ads were way too obscure and stupid by contrast.

2174
01:45:26,940 --> 01:45:29,020
It was like when you let hipsters do commercials.

2175
01:45:30,540 --> 01:45:35,100
Veronica S. replied and said the very first Pokemon commercial that aired on TV caused

2176
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:36,940
me to buy Pokemon Blue version.

2177
01:45:36,940 --> 01:45:38,140
I was 11 years old.

2178
01:45:38,780 --> 01:45:43,340
You know, the Pokemon cartoon was a pretty great tie in and the Pokemon movie.

2179
01:45:43,980 --> 01:45:44,620
Good times.

2180
01:45:46,060 --> 01:45:46,460
Let's see.

2181
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:50,540
Acidic Vampire says, have you seen the Wii U launch commercial?

2182
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:51,100
Hell no.

2183
01:45:53,660 --> 01:45:54,460
He gives a big thumbs.

2184
01:45:54,460 --> 01:45:59,020
I actually I only saw it in a movie theater once, but I don't I like I'm becoming dark

2185
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:03,660
soccer over here, but I don't watch TV like I really don't like very, very rarely, very

2186
01:46:03,660 --> 01:46:03,900
rarely.

2187
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:07,500
The only thing I've seen so far and it's because we're watching, I think, Law and Order SV

2188
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:10,220
is there's a commercial over and over for like suicide.

2189
01:46:12,140 --> 01:46:12,700
Suicide.

2190
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:14,220
Have you has it occurred to you?

2191
01:46:14,380 --> 01:46:18,700
It's like, I don't really know what it's for other than, hey, you know, I got to buy me

2192
01:46:18,700 --> 01:46:19,820
some of that suicide.

2193
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:21,100
T.J.

2194
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:26,780
Janai says kiosks and store demos are the most helpful for my buying decisions.

2195
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:32,220
Steven M. replied and said the early Xbox promos for Kinect really got me excited to

2196
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:32,700
buy one.

2197
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:37,660
Dart Charger said in my youth, I was probably swayed by many video game commercials.

2198
01:46:37,660 --> 01:46:42,780
I mean, who could forget the commercial like Journey for the Atari 2600?

2199
01:46:42,860 --> 01:46:45,660
And he actually embedded the commercial here for us to.

2200
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:53,900
They presents the world's first rock video game Journey Escape.

2201
01:46:53,900 --> 01:46:54,940
The concert's over.

2202
01:46:54,940 --> 01:46:59,980
Now you must help each member of Journey Escape to mobs of love-crazed groupies, shifty-eyed

2203
01:46:59,980 --> 01:47:00,460
promoters.

2204
01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:09,340
Find your roadies and manager and run into the escape vehicle and live to rock another

2205
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:09,580
day.

2206
01:47:09,580 --> 01:47:15,180
Journey Escape for the Atari 2600 from Data Age.

2207
01:47:15,980 --> 01:47:16,540
You know what?

2208
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:19,180
Fuck Journey from last year.

2209
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:21,740
This is the true journey.

2210
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:26,220
I regret printing Journey on my games of the year list.

2211
01:47:26,220 --> 01:47:30,220
This just reminded me that that there will only be one video game named Journey.

2212
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:33,340
I'm teasing mostly.

2213
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:33,580
All right.

2214
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:39,340
Anyhow, Dart Charger went on and said today's marketing has matured with the modern gamer

2215
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:40,060
as well.

2216
01:47:40,060 --> 01:47:44,860
These promotions aren't limited to simply TV commercials or magazine advertisements anymore.

2217
01:47:44,860 --> 01:47:48,780
Companies recognize the various ways they can influence gamers simply through exposure

2218
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:52,780
across all mediums like game trailers, demos, and previews on gaming sites and magazines.

2219
01:47:52,780 --> 01:47:55,020
You left out viral marketing.

2220
01:47:55,020 --> 01:48:00,700
Every boardroom, you know, mid-management favorite thing to not understand.

2221
01:48:00,700 --> 01:48:01,580
Viral marketing.

2222
01:48:03,340 --> 01:48:05,180
We need you guys to create a viral video.

2223
01:48:05,820 --> 01:48:06,540
That's not how it works.

2224
01:48:06,540 --> 01:48:07,820
It has to multiply.

2225
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:08,460
Multiply.

2226
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:09,260
Spread.

2227
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:10,220
Share it like a disease.

2228
01:48:10,220 --> 01:48:11,500
It must feature cats.

2229
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:13,900
Andy R. replied and said, not usually.

2230
01:48:13,900 --> 01:48:18,860
I typically build up hype for the games I want on my own through reading articles and

2231
01:48:18,860 --> 01:48:19,420
such.

2232
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:22,860
If anything, big expensive ad campaigns turn me off to a game.

2233
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:26,860
When every single gaming site was running ads for Mass Effect 3, I got sick of seeing

2234
01:48:26,860 --> 01:48:27,340
it.

2235
01:48:27,340 --> 01:48:29,500
Probably part of the reason I still don't like the game.

2236
01:48:30,460 --> 01:48:33,980
And I was interested in buying Dishonored, but after seeing the trailer a million times

2237
01:48:33,980 --> 01:48:38,700
before the game launched, thanks to The Escapist and PA TV, I decided to pass on the game.

2238
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:40,060
Just do what I do.

2239
01:48:40,060 --> 01:48:40,860
Stop watching TV.

2240
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:43,100
Well, these are web shows, though.

2241
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:44,860
Stop watching TV web shows.

2242
01:48:44,860 --> 01:48:45,660
Use Adblock.

2243
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:52,300
I will admit, though, a lot of online sites can only seem to ever find one sponsor.

2244
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:55,500
Dan and I always pick the commercials for Hulu that talk about, like, food.

2245
01:48:57,580 --> 01:49:00,620
I like this approach that I hope I pronounce this correctly.

2246
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:04,700
Shaya C said, define advertising.

2247
01:49:04,700 --> 01:49:08,540
Were things like the Super Mario Brothers Super Show or the Sonic cartoon ads for a

2248
01:49:08,540 --> 01:49:09,580
specific game?

2249
01:49:09,580 --> 01:49:10,300
Not really.

2250
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:14,380
Were they media which kept the franchise visible, popular, and made us kids excited for the

2251
01:49:14,380 --> 01:49:15,420
next game installment?

2252
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:16,380
You bet.

2253
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:20,940
Before the internet, gasp, TV ads, friends, and kiosks were the only way you'd actually

2254
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:23,100
see gameplay before getting it yourself.

2255
01:49:23,100 --> 01:49:25,580
Magazines had reviews, but you'd only get stills.

2256
01:49:25,580 --> 01:49:27,900
Now we've got trailers on demand and tons of review sites.

2257
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:31,900
I feel like consumers are pulling information more than is being pushed to them.

2258
01:49:31,900 --> 01:49:36,140
The only thing they really need to nail with traditional advertising these days is making

2259
01:49:36,140 --> 01:49:37,740
sure people know the title.

2260
01:49:37,740 --> 01:49:38,620
Interesting perspective.

2261
01:49:38,620 --> 01:49:41,180
We were going down that line a little bit and talking about the wizard and stuff.

2262
01:49:41,980 --> 01:49:47,340
Degenerate Johnny said, the only time I actually bought a console based on its advertisement

2263
01:49:47,340 --> 01:49:49,260
alone was Tiger's Gamecom.

2264
01:49:49,260 --> 01:49:51,980
The commercial made the mobile gaming device as the shit.

2265
01:49:52,700 --> 01:49:57,100
Yes, the little person's insulting remarks came off as insulting to the gaming community,

2266
01:49:57,100 --> 01:49:59,020
but I recognized its satire.

2267
01:49:59,020 --> 01:50:01,980
Not to mention it was pretty funny seeing the little guy get tossed around at the end

2268
01:50:01,980 --> 01:50:02,700
of the ad.

2269
01:50:02,700 --> 01:50:04,860
And so I'm fortunate to see that the device failed.

2270
01:50:04,860 --> 01:50:06,140
Oh yeah, that thing failed.

2271
01:50:06,140 --> 01:50:09,580
Since it had many features that were quite innovative for the late 90s, such as touchscreen

2272
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:14,140
controls and internet access, it goes to show that one must be mindful of its market if

2273
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:15,820
it hopes to make the product a success.

2274
01:50:16,460 --> 01:50:21,660
And lastly, SHA100Matt says, back when I subscribed to Nintendo Power as a kid, I was sent, like

2275
01:50:21,660 --> 01:50:25,820
many other subscribers, a VHS tape of the Nintendo 64.

2276
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:29,980
Since there were no gaming blogs and gaming sites I was able to access back then, all

2277
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:34,220
I had to go on was brief articles on Nintendo Power and other gaming magazines.

2278
01:50:34,220 --> 01:50:39,180
But when I got the Nintendo 64 Power Preview video from Nintendo Power, I was sold on the

2279
01:50:39,180 --> 01:50:40,620
Nintendo 64.

2280
01:50:40,620 --> 01:50:44,140
It was the first time I ever got a real look at the graphics and games in action, so I

2281
01:50:44,140 --> 01:50:45,900
was immediately blown away.

2282
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:48,540
After that point, I saved up my money and got the system at launch.

2283
01:50:48,540 --> 01:50:53,260
I never realized that they'd sent out videos like that.

2284
01:50:53,260 --> 01:50:53,980
That's kind of neat.

2285
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:59,020
I wonder if they were those really cheap, like, cardboard tape things that could really

2286
01:50:59,020 --> 01:51:00,780
fuck up your VCR if you used it wrong.

2287
01:51:01,420 --> 01:51:02,300
I don't know.

2288
01:51:02,300 --> 01:51:06,220
All right, anyhow, we have not yet gone to Google Plus, so let me quickly get through

2289
01:51:06,220 --> 01:51:07,260
Google Plus's answers.

2290
01:51:07,820 --> 01:51:11,100
ActDef said, I would say that back in the 80s and 90s it worked.

2291
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:15,260
We got smothered with over-the-top, in-your-face advertisement back then, and it probably

2292
01:51:15,260 --> 01:51:18,380
got us to buy or ask our parents to get us a video games.

2293
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:22,460
But now, a lot of commercials for games are really bland and don't capture your attention

2294
01:51:22,460 --> 01:51:22,860
that much.

2295
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:28,460
CriticalMyth said, I can't say there was a commercial that did that for me, but print

2296
01:51:28,460 --> 01:51:30,860
ads have convinced me more than a couple times.

2297
01:51:30,860 --> 01:51:33,660
One I remember well was Xenosaga 2.

2298
01:51:33,660 --> 01:51:35,340
Cosmos had me at, hello.

2299
01:51:37,740 --> 01:51:41,740
Myko says, as much as I want to say no, it's the quality of the games that does it for

2300
01:51:41,740 --> 01:51:46,140
me, like it did for the Dreamcast, I have to say yes if the OUYA counts because I'm

2301
01:51:46,140 --> 01:51:46,780
an idiot.

2302
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:48,620
Okay, so I guess there are OUYA commercials.

2303
01:51:48,620 --> 01:51:49,820
What am I missing?

2304
01:51:49,820 --> 01:51:50,220
Are there?

2305
01:51:50,220 --> 01:51:52,540
Because that's the second person to say there are OUYA commercials.

2306
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:54,220
And I have just not seen one.

2307
01:51:54,780 --> 01:51:56,540
All right, let's take a look here.

2308
01:51:56,540 --> 01:51:57,820
Rob's on the hunt.

2309
01:51:57,820 --> 01:52:02,700
Shane is adding that those videos were real VHS tapes and they were fantastic.

2310
01:52:06,860 --> 01:52:09,900
I'll be damned, there is an, oh no, that says fan-made.

2311
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:15,420
But there is this seven, I wonder if it's the Kickstarter ad these guys are referring

2312
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:15,420


2313
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:16,380
It's probably the Kickstarter video that they had.

2314
01:52:16,380 --> 01:52:17,340
I bet that's what it is.

2315
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:19,580
It's like the modern type of ad.

2316
01:52:19,580 --> 01:52:20,080
Interesting.

2317
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:29,500
Let's see, E3VL says, advertising campaigns worked on me and my youth due to the limited

2318
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:32,220
social media exposure, magazines, TV, and radio.

2319
01:52:32,220 --> 01:52:36,140
Now with the internet involved, ads are everywhere and it's second nature to ignore them or it

2320
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:39,900
becomes background noise with the instant impulse, hit the X or skip button when it's

2321
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:40,700
available.

2322
01:52:40,700 --> 01:52:43,820
Also, now that I purchase things with my own money instead of my parents, I tend to do

2323
01:52:43,820 --> 01:52:47,820
research before purchasing and ads are just a way to get me curious about coming trends

2324
01:52:47,820 --> 01:52:52,860
instead of impulse buys or begging for the blast processing for Christmas slash birthday.

2325
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:59,500
And lastly, Techie Q says, no, today's ads campaigns to sway me has less effect on me

2326
01:52:59,500 --> 01:53:03,660
now thanks to internet, but it did sway me more during the Super Nintendo era of gaming.

2327
01:53:03,660 --> 01:53:08,140
Those early Super Mario World and Legend of Zelda, a link to the past commercials swayed

2328
01:53:08,140 --> 01:53:10,620
me hard to get a Super Nintendo.

2329
01:53:10,620 --> 01:53:12,460
Good answers tonight and good reminiscing.

2330
01:53:12,460 --> 01:53:19,100
All I know is the commercials for Grand Theft Auto San Andreas just pissed me off because

2331
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:22,220
I wanted to play Grand Theft Auto San Andreas more.

2332
01:53:22,220 --> 01:53:26,220
You know, it was like before it came out, I'm like, what now?

2333
01:53:26,220 --> 01:53:29,260
Oh, you know, that kind of stuff.

2334
01:53:29,260 --> 01:53:32,060
Or Grand Theft Auto 4, both of those.

2335
01:53:32,060 --> 01:53:36,060
All right, let's move on with some more gaming news for the week.

2336
01:53:36,060 --> 01:53:38,540
Thank you to everybody on Facebook and Google for answering the question.

2337
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:39,540
Loki.

2338
01:53:39,540 --> 01:53:43,780
All right, so we've been talking about it, and I'm sure you guys have no idea what Disney

2339
01:53:43,780 --> 01:53:48,420
Infinity is, even though we've been talking about it for months now, probably months longer

2340
01:53:48,420 --> 01:53:54,900
than everybody else, but Disney Infinity finally got announced this week, and basically it's

2341
01:53:54,900 --> 01:54:02,740
this cool combination of like toys and a little base that you put them on and games, and then

2342
01:54:02,740 --> 01:54:04,340
they have this toy box mode.

2343
01:54:04,340 --> 01:54:10,420
So basically, what kind of makes it different than Skylanders is it's not just one single,

2344
01:54:10,420 --> 01:54:14,100
I mean, it is, they have the toy box mode where you can kind of take all these toys

2345
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:19,300
and build your own world out of it, which is kind of cool, but it's not some single

2346
01:54:19,300 --> 01:54:24,100
game that you have to buy characters for to unlock all the parts of the game.

2347
01:54:24,100 --> 01:54:25,620
That's really the main thing.

2348
01:54:25,620 --> 01:54:31,580
Bobby was being funny on Twitter and saying, so is this something that I can like now?

2349
01:54:31,620 --> 01:54:34,940
You know, are you giving me permission to like this because you gave everybody crap

2350
01:54:34,940 --> 01:54:36,500
about Skylanders?

2351
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:40,420
And yeah, I say it's a little bit different because each individual character and playset

2352
01:54:40,420 --> 01:54:42,380
or whatever is its own thing.

2353
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:48,980
It's not necessarily like, oh, I have to buy Captain Jack Sparrow to get to this one part

2354
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:51,740
of the Monsters Inc. world or something like that.

2355
01:54:51,740 --> 01:54:52,740
It's not like that at all.

2356
01:54:52,740 --> 01:54:56,860
Each thing is its own game, and then what kind of ties them all together is the toy

2357
01:54:56,860 --> 01:55:02,020
box mode where you can build wherever the fuck you want, and they've got racing stuff

2358
01:55:02,020 --> 01:55:03,020
in there.

2359
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:05,460
It sounds like they're kind of combining a little bit of the Little Big Planet stuff.

2360
01:55:05,460 --> 01:55:09,780
You can set your camera at certain spots, so you can do like a 2D platformer, or you

2361
01:55:09,780 --> 01:55:14,740
can make a racing game, or you could just do whatever, and you could share these all

2362
01:55:14,740 --> 01:55:18,740
around the world, and it sounds like that they're going to have, I think DLC you could

2363
01:55:18,740 --> 01:55:19,740
buy for it.

2364
01:55:19,740 --> 01:55:20,740
They're going to have actual toys.

2365
01:55:20,740 --> 01:55:23,740
The toys are like 12 bucks each for each individual character.

2366
01:55:24,180 --> 01:55:25,180
You can get playsets.

2367
01:55:25,180 --> 01:55:29,780
They're like 35 bucks, which are going to include a few characters and like a world

2368
01:55:29,780 --> 01:55:35,420
as well as some different power-ups and stuff, and talk about total fan service on a lot

2369
01:55:35,420 --> 01:55:36,420
of stuff.

2370
01:55:36,420 --> 01:55:38,180
The game itself actually comes with three worlds.

2371
01:55:38,180 --> 01:55:42,700
It's Monsters University, The Incredibles, and Pirates of the Caribbean, and they've

2372
01:55:42,700 --> 01:55:49,420
got Captain Jack Sparrow, Mr. Incredible, and Sully from Monsters U and Monsters Inc.

2373
01:55:49,420 --> 01:55:54,060
in that first playset, or the first thing they're packing in there for 75 bucks.

2374
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:55,060
What a surprise.

2375
01:55:55,060 --> 01:55:56,060
I had no idea.

2376
01:55:56,060 --> 01:56:03,540
Yes, and then let's see what else, but yeah, they've got Tron, at least some hints of Tron

2377
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:06,580
in there, and they've got other characters.

2378
01:56:06,580 --> 01:56:12,100
I think I posted a few things on there, like different screen grabs and stuff, and they've

2379
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:15,260
got like Phineas and Ferb is going to be something else that they have on there.

2380
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:16,620
Love Phineas and Ferb.

2381
01:56:16,620 --> 01:56:18,660
And they've got, of course, the rest of them.

2382
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:19,900
Jack Skellington.

2383
01:56:19,900 --> 01:56:20,900
Yeah, Jack Skellington was in there.

2384
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:21,900
Sign me up for that.

2385
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:25,740
Toy Story, obviously, because that was kind of the Toy Box moment, Toy Story 3 is what

2386
01:56:25,740 --> 01:56:28,340
kind of inspired them to do all this stuff.

2387
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:33,200
And Cars is going to be something else, and Wreck-It Ralph is in there, and they even

2388
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:39,580
have some hints of like Sugar Rush, which should be pretty cool, and all this stuff

2389
01:56:39,580 --> 01:56:40,580
is supposed to be coming out.

2390
01:56:40,580 --> 01:56:43,980
Also, other things they didn't have, Frozen's going to have some characters with that when

2391
01:56:43,980 --> 01:56:45,820
that movie comes out this fall.

2392
01:56:45,820 --> 01:56:47,820
Here's a couple problems, though.

2393
01:56:47,820 --> 01:56:53,140
I mean, there's the Disney nerd in me wants to go all in on this shit, right?

2394
01:56:53,140 --> 01:56:59,100
I mean, you know, I collect the pins, which is an expensive hobby, you know, so why not

2395
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:00,100
go to the figurines?

2396
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:01,100
Right?

2397
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:02,580
I mean, but here's my concern.

2398
01:57:02,580 --> 01:57:05,480
I'm really worried about the quality of the game.

2399
01:57:05,480 --> 01:57:09,620
And I'm going to be honest, whether this is a rational reason or not, I'm just being I'm

2400
01:57:09,620 --> 01:57:10,760
keeping it real.

2401
01:57:10,760 --> 01:57:12,760
I'm worried about who's developing it.

2402
01:57:12,760 --> 01:57:15,900
They don't have an established product under their belt.

2403
01:57:15,900 --> 01:57:16,900
Avalanche.

2404
01:57:16,900 --> 01:57:21,980
Like, a lot of the stuff they put out have been kiddie games.

2405
01:57:21,980 --> 01:57:25,060
Toy Story 3, obviously, was them, too.

2406
01:57:25,060 --> 01:57:30,160
And if you look at what they did before Disney picked them up, they did a lot of bad games,

2407
01:57:30,160 --> 01:57:32,060
like Sub-Zero Mythologies and all that.

2408
01:57:32,060 --> 01:57:35,980
Now, granted, we all make mistakes, and we should give them a chance that maybe this

2409
01:57:35,980 --> 01:57:39,140
is something that will break through, but I'm concerned.

2410
01:57:39,140 --> 01:57:47,100
And the gameplay footage didn't really make me go, uhh, you know?

2411
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:48,100
I didn't lose my shit.

2412
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:50,300
Well, did you watch any of the interview videos?

2413
01:57:50,300 --> 01:57:52,140
They actually had more in-depth play gameplay stuff.

2414
01:57:52,140 --> 01:57:53,140
To be fair, no.

2415
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:56,060
I only watched the common trailer that was out there.

2416
01:57:56,060 --> 01:57:57,060
It looked OK.

2417
01:57:57,060 --> 01:58:01,580
I mean, it's not like, you know, none of this is really making me go, oh, I got it picked

2418
01:58:01,580 --> 01:58:02,580
up.

2419
01:58:02,580 --> 01:58:06,460
I mean, the Toy Box mode sounds really cool, but once again, I was kind of even thinking

2420
01:58:06,460 --> 01:58:11,940
about it, and I'm like, is this going to be really much different than Skylanders is

2421
01:58:11,940 --> 01:58:16,340
as far as, like, you're going to have to buy all this shit to, you know, what am I going

2422
01:58:16,340 --> 01:58:17,340
to have to buy?

2423
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:21,380
Am I going to have to buy, like, this Disney landscape, you know, thing or something to

2424
01:58:21,380 --> 01:58:23,740
have, like, you know, the Epcot Center or whatever?

2425
01:58:23,740 --> 01:58:24,740
And they have that.

2426
01:58:24,740 --> 01:58:27,940
The Epcot Center, you can actually put it in your world and stuff.

2427
01:58:27,940 --> 01:58:30,540
It'd be like Warhammer Disney-K.

2428
01:58:30,540 --> 01:58:31,540
I mean, it's just so cool.

2429
01:58:31,540 --> 01:58:36,060
I'd have to see what stuff comes out and, you know, how it gets priced and, you know,

2430
01:58:36,060 --> 01:58:37,700
I think it's going to sell really well.

2431
01:58:37,700 --> 01:58:41,420
And the fact that they have this whole kind of synergy where you can build your own world

2432
01:58:41,420 --> 01:58:42,420
is kind of unique.

2433
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:43,420
I don't know.

2434
01:58:43,420 --> 01:58:46,240
That's really going to set them apart from, like, Skylanders, because Skylanders is like,

2435
01:58:46,240 --> 01:58:49,220
you buy a bunch of characters, you play one game, you know, it's a dungeon crawler and

2436
01:58:49,220 --> 01:58:50,220
that's it.

2437
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:53,140
Whereas this, they could have multiple game types.

2438
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:56,580
They could have, you know, this is going to be a racing game, this is going to be an adventure

2439
01:58:56,580 --> 01:58:57,580
game.

2440
01:58:57,580 --> 01:59:00,980
Something to remember about those little RFIDs, too, is that they don't just, you know, they're

2441
01:59:00,980 --> 01:59:02,860
not just chips that transmit data.

2442
01:59:02,860 --> 01:59:03,860
They can save data.

2443
01:59:03,860 --> 01:59:04,860
Yes.

2444
01:59:04,860 --> 01:59:05,860
Just a limited amount, right?

2445
01:59:05,860 --> 01:59:06,860
Just a little bit.

2446
01:59:06,860 --> 01:59:10,100
But maybe enough so that, like, you could bring with you a level design.

2447
01:59:10,100 --> 01:59:11,100
Yes.

2448
01:59:11,100 --> 01:59:12,100
Maybe.

2449
01:59:12,100 --> 01:59:15,740
Or at least you can share those on the internet, apparently, like with other people and play

2450
01:59:15,740 --> 01:59:17,860
their creations or invite your friends over.

2451
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:24,780
You can do four-player co-op over the internet.

2452
01:59:24,780 --> 01:59:25,780
I don't know.

2453
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:28,240
I guess I'll wait till a little closer, look at some of the reviews.

2454
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:33,160
You know, there's that part of me that's like, must have all figurines, must have them all.

2455
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:34,860
But the figurines look cool.

2456
01:59:34,860 --> 01:59:35,980
I saw pictures of them.

2457
01:59:35,980 --> 01:59:38,860
I mean, they're well done.

2458
01:59:38,860 --> 01:59:44,220
And here's the thing, too, that I'm not too positive on, but it looks like they articulate.

2459
01:59:44,220 --> 01:59:47,580
It looks like the arms, at least they've got seams on the arms where it looks like they

2460
01:59:47,580 --> 01:59:52,820
could move, limited at least, but that's more than Skylanders can.

2461
01:59:52,820 --> 01:59:54,900
So you know, that'd be interesting.

2462
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:57,260
Is that why they're going to be more expensive than the figure?

2463
01:59:57,260 --> 01:59:58,500
Is that just Disney tax?

2464
01:59:58,500 --> 02:00:00,140
They're not that much more expensive than Skylanders.

2465
02:00:00,140 --> 02:00:01,140
But they are more expensive.

2466
02:00:01,140 --> 02:00:02,140
Yes, they are more expensive.

2467
02:00:02,140 --> 02:00:03,140
Is that Disney tax?

2468
02:00:03,140 --> 02:00:04,140
Probably Disney tax.

2469
02:00:05,140 --> 02:00:06,140
Just curious.

2470
02:00:07,140 --> 02:00:08,140
All right.

2471
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:11,140
Well, that is definitely the future of gaming, like it or not.

2472
02:00:11,140 --> 02:00:12,140
I don't know.

2473
02:00:12,140 --> 02:00:19,140
It concerns me, though, is that if we support Disney infinity, that like we're saying we

2474
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:20,140
want more of this.

2475
02:00:20,140 --> 02:00:24,140
And I really worry about the barrage of knockoffs that this whole Skylander thing is going to

2476
02:00:24,140 --> 02:00:25,140
cause.

2477
02:00:25,140 --> 02:00:26,140
Pokemon.

2478
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:28,140
Well, yeah, I was talking to Shane about that.

2479
02:00:28,140 --> 02:00:32,140
I was like, can you imagine if Nintendo just said we want to do Pokemon like this?

2480
02:00:32,140 --> 02:00:34,140
I would have them all my God.

2481
02:00:34,140 --> 02:00:36,140
But he brought up a good point with me.

2482
02:00:36,140 --> 02:00:37,140
Maybe I'll call in the show later.

2483
02:00:37,140 --> 02:00:38,140
Talk about it.

2484
02:00:38,140 --> 02:00:41,140
He said that the creator of Pokemon actually hates DLC.

2485
02:00:41,140 --> 02:00:43,140
So they may not be.

2486
02:00:43,140 --> 02:00:47,140
But he may hate DLC, but they're going to have DLC in the next Pokemon game.

2487
02:00:47,140 --> 02:00:50,140
He may hate it all he wants, but he's not calling a shot.

2488
02:00:50,140 --> 02:00:52,140
They used to do those Burger King toys back.

2489
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:55,140
That's why I told him I said they used to have a little toy.

2490
02:00:55,140 --> 02:01:00,140
Can you imagine that they will literally have like Pokeballs that you put your fucking figurine

2491
02:01:00,140 --> 02:01:02,140
in that you put it out on?

2492
02:01:02,140 --> 02:01:04,140
It's like that was that was Burger King.

2493
02:01:04,140 --> 02:01:05,140
You know what?

2494
02:01:05,140 --> 02:01:09,140
Twelve years ago, I have to tell you, after they banned all those Pokeballs, we went to

2495
02:01:09,140 --> 02:01:14,140
a Burger King and went through the drive through 10 times to get more Pokeballs so that we

2496
02:01:14,140 --> 02:01:16,140
could hang them up on the tree yourself with them.

2497
02:01:16,140 --> 02:01:18,140
No, just so that we could have a pile of Pokeballs.

2498
02:01:18,140 --> 02:01:22,140
We we actually had a box full of Pokeballs and Pokemon toys because we wanted all of

2499
02:01:22,140 --> 02:01:23,140
them.

2500
02:01:23,140 --> 02:01:26,140
And then finally we're like, wait, this is stupid and gave them away.

2501
02:01:26,140 --> 02:01:29,140
I actually I went as Ash Ketchum one Halloween.

2502
02:01:29,140 --> 02:01:32,140
And thank you to Burger King for those Pokeballs because they were great for my costume.

2503
02:01:32,140 --> 02:01:35,140
And you know, and honestly, you know, maybe the other thing they got me psyched about,

2504
02:01:35,140 --> 02:01:39,140
you know, the whole Disney infinity thing is the fact that they had Nero's Me and You

2505
02:01:39,140 --> 02:01:41,140
in the trailer, which is pretty awesome.

2506
02:01:41,140 --> 02:01:43,140
Yes.

2507
02:01:43,140 --> 02:01:44,140
That's awesome.

2508
02:01:44,140 --> 02:01:46,140
That song is awesome.

2509
02:01:46,140 --> 02:01:48,140
So at least somebody has good taste in music over there.

2510
02:01:48,140 --> 02:01:49,140
I think they do.

2511
02:01:49,140 --> 02:01:51,140
And I really like Step Step.

2512
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:52,140
All right.

2513
02:01:52,140 --> 02:01:56,140
Well, a little story that was circulating the game blogs this week was about pinballs

2514
02:01:56,140 --> 02:01:57,140
arcade.

2515
02:01:57,140 --> 02:01:58,140
That's with a Z.

2516
02:01:58,140 --> 02:02:01,140
It is a arcade located in Austin, Texas.

2517
02:02:01,140 --> 02:02:03,140
The cool place in Texas.

2518
02:02:03,140 --> 02:02:06,140
Pinball's arcade is kind of it's like a retro gaming place.

2519
02:02:06,140 --> 02:02:12,140
It's got arcade machines like Galaga, Street Fighter two, Jurassic Park, Lost World and

2520
02:02:12,140 --> 02:02:16,140
Darren's spawn, who is the owner of this with his wife, Mickey.

2521
02:02:16,140 --> 02:02:19,140
What they're trying to do with this, they want to recreate the experience of arcade

2522
02:02:19,140 --> 02:02:23,140
gaming, saying, quote, people have lost their that social experience.

2523
02:02:23,140 --> 02:02:24,140
They sit on couches with their Xbox.

2524
02:02:24,140 --> 02:02:26,140
They never talk to their kids.

2525
02:02:26,140 --> 02:02:29,140
You want to come to a place where you can play together with your kids, too, and find

2526
02:02:29,140 --> 02:02:32,140
something that the whole family enjoys.

2527
02:02:32,140 --> 02:02:36,140
Now, it should be noted, you know, this place has been around since November 2010.

2528
02:02:36,140 --> 02:02:39,140
It is just making the rounds on the game blog this week because of an article that

2529
02:02:39,140 --> 02:02:43,140
was discovered on statesman dot com, which I'm assuming is kind of like an Austin,

2530
02:02:43,140 --> 02:02:46,140
you know, so so people were able to find it on the Internet and kind of figure out

2531
02:02:46,140 --> 02:02:47,140
more about this place.

2532
02:02:47,140 --> 02:02:53,140
But yay to this guy trying to end his wife bringing back the retro arcade stuff.

2533
02:02:53,140 --> 02:02:55,140
I think that's great.

2534
02:02:55,140 --> 02:02:59,140
Even the article, the original article talks about some games like Missile Command,

2535
02:02:59,140 --> 02:03:02,140
they don't make much money, but he keeps them because they're classics.

2536
02:03:02,140 --> 02:03:05,140
And the other thing about the arcade, I was looking at the actual Web site.

2537
02:03:05,140 --> 02:03:07,140
Everything in that arcade is for sale.

2538
02:03:07,140 --> 02:03:11,140
So let's say you go in and you're playing Galaga and you're like, I want to buy this

2539
02:03:11,140 --> 02:03:12,140
machine. You can buy it.

2540
02:03:12,140 --> 02:03:17,140
So it's almost like a interactive show floor where you could buy the games.

2541
02:03:17,140 --> 02:03:19,140
It's kind of awesome.

2542
02:03:19,140 --> 02:03:22,140
Oh, no, I'll take all of them.

2543
02:03:22,140 --> 02:03:26,140
There did seem to be a healthy amount of ticket ticket spitting games to like more

2544
02:03:26,140 --> 02:03:29,140
like the hand-me-down kind of ticket spitting games, like things that were in

2545
02:03:29,140 --> 02:03:30,140
arcades a few years ago.

2546
02:03:30,140 --> 02:03:32,140
But, you know, we're on a skeeball.

2547
02:03:32,140 --> 02:03:36,140
Let's keep on keep on pressing the button to stop the light types of games.

2548
02:03:36,140 --> 02:03:38,140
You know, what was that?

2549
02:03:38,140 --> 02:03:43,140
They throw a birthday smoke and token and spider stomp.

2550
02:03:43,140 --> 02:03:47,140
Apparently, a second and third location elsewhere in Austin could be coming this

2551
02:03:47,140 --> 02:03:51,140
year. And, you know, remember, guys, he opened this place in November 2010.

2552
02:03:51,140 --> 02:03:54,140
I mean, the economy has been kind of in the shitter in the past couple of years,

2553
02:03:54,140 --> 02:03:57,140
yet this place didn't go out of business.

2554
02:03:57,140 --> 02:03:58,140
That's awesome.

2555
02:03:58,140 --> 02:04:02,140
And clearly it's because of the Star Trek backdrop he has there in the arcade.

2556
02:04:02,140 --> 02:04:05,140
That's what keeps that place awesome.

2557
02:04:05,140 --> 02:04:07,140
Anyhow, there's a no fear.

2558
02:04:07,140 --> 02:04:09,140
You know what? You know, who else has no fear?

2559
02:04:09,140 --> 02:04:11,140
Dan, right? Or had he had one?

2560
02:04:11,140 --> 02:04:13,140
Yeah, that was the last table we sold.

2561
02:04:13,140 --> 02:04:16,140
They need to have.

2562
02:04:16,140 --> 02:04:20,140
They need to have like a giant Picard picture on the wall with him, like saying,

2563
02:04:20,140 --> 02:04:22,140
make it so or something, somewhere in there.

2564
02:04:22,140 --> 02:04:25,140
I mean, that'd be pretty awesome.

2565
02:04:25,140 --> 02:04:28,140
All right, let's move on with more news.

2566
02:04:28,140 --> 02:04:30,140
Oh, yeah, it's my turn, isn't it?

2567
02:04:30,140 --> 02:04:32,140
Silly iPad.

2568
02:04:32,140 --> 02:04:38,140
Well, there is a game coming out by an indie studio called Stab Yourself.

2569
02:04:38,140 --> 02:04:40,140
That's the best name ever.

2570
02:04:40,140 --> 02:04:42,140
It's stabyourself.net.

2571
02:04:42,140 --> 02:04:47,140
They basically recreate 80s games and then apply modern physics to them.

2572
02:04:47,140 --> 02:04:51,140
They've done a game called Not Tetris, where basically it's like Game Boy Tetris,

2573
02:04:51,140 --> 02:04:54,140
except the bricks actually fall with the same momentum a brick really would.

2574
02:04:54,140 --> 02:05:00,140
Then there's Mario, which is M-A-R-I-0, where basically you go through the Mushroom Kingdom with a portal gun.

2575
02:05:00,140 --> 02:05:03,140
And now they have Not Pac-Man.

2576
02:05:03,140 --> 02:05:12,140
Not Pac-Man is, well, Pac-Man is on the screen, but instead of moving him around and the ghost moving around,

2577
02:05:13,140 --> 02:05:18,140
you actually tilt the screen, and you can use a keyboard, a mouse, a game pad, or a steering wheel.

2578
02:05:18,140 --> 02:05:20,140
Yes, you can use a steering wheel.

2579
02:05:20,140 --> 02:05:23,140
And the ghosts don't move by themselves either.

2580
02:05:23,140 --> 02:05:25,140
They might fall into you as you're turning.

2581
02:05:25,140 --> 02:05:30,140
So it applies a new aspect of physics to the game, and I need this in my life.

2582
02:05:30,140 --> 02:05:33,140
That is actually badass, I've got to say.

2583
02:05:33,140 --> 02:05:35,140
That is a really smart innovation.

2584
02:05:35,140 --> 02:05:41,140
Obviously, it's Stab Yourself with Love and Good Ideas is what they talk about in the name, right?

2585
02:05:41,140 --> 02:05:42,140
Stab Yourself with innovation.

2586
02:05:42,140 --> 02:05:43,140
Yes, exactly.

2587
02:05:43,140 --> 02:05:45,140
That's stabyourself.net.

2588
02:05:45,140 --> 02:05:48,140
Go get it. I want it. I'm gonna get it.

2589
02:05:48,140 --> 02:05:50,140
I love that you can control it with a steering wheel.

2590
02:05:50,140 --> 02:05:54,140
I totally do. Well, you know, we've got Dan's steering wheel rig.

2591
02:05:54,140 --> 02:05:57,140
We could totally do that. Oh, did, oh, no, no, no.

2592
02:05:57,140 --> 02:06:00,140
Okay, I have to add something. Rewind back into the gaming week.

2593
02:06:00,140 --> 02:06:02,140
Do you know what my husband is doing tonight?

2594
02:06:02,140 --> 02:06:09,140
He is building himself a three-monitor rig, just for playing Gran Turismo and OutRun.

2595
02:06:10,140 --> 02:06:11,140
My husband.

2596
02:06:11,140 --> 02:06:13,140
I didn't realize OutRun used three monitors.

2597
02:06:13,140 --> 02:06:14,140
Yeah.

2598
02:06:14,140 --> 02:06:16,140
Like the old OutRun or the new OutRun?

2599
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:17,140
The newer ones.

2600
02:06:17,140 --> 02:06:24,140
He's basically building the rig so he can hook up his PC to do full three-screen gaming.

2601
02:06:24,140 --> 02:06:29,140
Now, if you're gonna do something like that with an Xbox or a PS3, you actually have to have other systems.

2602
02:06:29,140 --> 02:06:31,140
Like multiple systems to get him to run.

2603
02:06:31,140 --> 02:06:33,140
Yeah, I know Gran Turismo, you need like three systems, three monitors.

2604
02:06:33,140 --> 02:06:38,140
Yeah, but he's doing something so that he can play all of the PC-based games.

2605
02:06:38,140 --> 02:06:39,140
Cool.

2606
02:06:39,140 --> 02:06:42,140
With three monitors. My husband's a dork.

2607
02:06:42,140 --> 02:06:44,140
That's why you love him, though.

2608
02:06:44,140 --> 02:06:47,140
I guess. He better get me that BeatMania now.

2609
02:06:47,140 --> 02:06:49,140
More news.

2610
02:06:49,140 --> 02:06:53,140
All right, so, layoffs. More layoffs.

2611
02:06:53,140 --> 02:07:00,140
So, starting off, Gas Powered Games had some layoffs, and this is right after they just launched a Kickstarter for a game called Wildman.

2612
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:07,140
Apparently, the whole thing was that Wildman's Kickstarter needed to actually...

2613
02:07:07,140 --> 02:07:19,140
It needs to earn that money because otherwise, they would have had to lay everyone off anyways without any of their paid time off and stuff cashed out and any of the benefits or severances and stuff.

2614
02:07:21,140 --> 02:07:23,140
And right now, I think...

2615
02:07:23,140 --> 02:07:26,140
I'm actually gonna check to see how their Kickstarter's doing.

2616
02:07:26,140 --> 02:07:41,140
Not looking good. They need to hit $1.1 million, and they're at $263,000, and they have 25 days to go. It's gonna be tough.

2617
02:07:41,140 --> 02:07:50,140
But basically, yeah. So, what he's saying is if they do hit their Kickstarter, they'll try to hire the people back that haven't found jobs yet and that kind of stuff.

2618
02:07:50,140 --> 02:08:00,140
Unfortunately, it's just bad timing, I guess. They just had to lay them off now so that they have money to actually do that.

2619
02:08:00,140 --> 02:08:10,140
They're still operating, but it's way slimmed down. In fact, pretty much everybody's gone except for the head of the studio and I think a couple people.

2620
02:08:10,140 --> 02:08:13,140
So, that's kinda gonna suck.

2621
02:08:14,140 --> 02:08:21,140
The other thing, too, is Codemasters has laid off 80 people as well, and they're restructuring.

2622
02:08:21,140 --> 02:08:26,140
Sorry, there's three companies tonight that are having major, major problems.

2623
02:08:26,140 --> 02:08:37,140
Yeah. Codemasters, really, they don't have... I mean, they have had some okay games come out, but a lot of their stuff recently hasn't done terribly well.

2624
02:08:37,140 --> 02:08:48,140
I'm trying to think. Dirt 3 was the last game I remember them having put out. I know they have Grid 2 coming, and also their Formula 1 title didn't do terribly well.

2625
02:08:48,140 --> 02:08:54,140
And I don't think their Formula 1 kart racing game did terribly well either. So, that kinda sucks.

2626
02:08:54,140 --> 02:09:01,140
Maybe they can make something other than racing games. I think they tried that and that wasn't terribly well either.

2627
02:09:01,140 --> 02:09:05,140
I was gonna say, but what's worked for them is that Dirt was one of their biggest games.

2628
02:09:05,140 --> 02:09:16,140
Grid looked pretty cool. Grid 2, so I'm looking forward to see what that looks like. I'd love to see a next-gen Dirt game on the new consoles when they come out. That'd be pretty awesome.

2629
02:09:16,140 --> 02:09:23,140
I'd also like to see a next-gen Ridge Racer that doesn't fucking suck, Namco. You have more time. Come on.

2630
02:09:23,140 --> 02:09:33,140
Not a fucking rehash of, what, fuck, 7 or 6? How many times? What game did they actually have new tracks in? Was that 4? 4 had new tracks in it?

2631
02:09:33,140 --> 02:09:37,140
I mean, seriously. New Ridge Racer would be awesome.

2632
02:09:37,140 --> 02:09:44,140
Alright, well, moving on to another story here. You know, where there is an internet, there will always be trolls.

2633
02:09:44,140 --> 02:09:50,140
And the folks at Blizzard, yes, Blizzard figured that out this week with Diablo 3 changes.

2634
02:09:50,140 --> 02:10:00,140
Jay Wilson, who was, I believe he was like the head designer on Diablo 3, he is stepping away to do other duties within Blizzard.

2635
02:10:00,140 --> 02:10:07,140
He's not leaving Blizzard, but he's worked on Diablo 3 for 7 years, and he will no longer be working on Diablo 3.

2636
02:10:07,140 --> 02:10:14,140
Well, instantly, in the departure thread, people were bashing Jay Wilson for the quality of Diablo 3.

2637
02:10:14,140 --> 02:10:21,140
You know, for many people, Diablo 3 has not lived up to expectations. The Always Online thing has rubbed people the wrong way.

2638
02:10:21,140 --> 02:10:28,140
The Real Money Auction House has rubbed some people the wrong way. PVP was promised, it still hasn't happened yet, although I guess dueling is coming in the next patch.

2639
02:10:28,140 --> 02:10:33,140
That's rubbed some people the wrong way. So, people have taken out their aggressions on this guy.

2640
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:42,140
He announced his retirement on January 17th, and the thread has grown to over 170 pages.

2641
02:10:42,140 --> 02:10:49,140
Rob Pardo, the Chief Creative Officer at Blizzard, came into the thread saying, quote,

2642
02:10:49,140 --> 02:11:01,140
This thread saddens me greatly. I know that the Battle.net forums have earned a reputation for rough justice, but I do not believe justice is being served by how people are speaking about Jay's departure from Diablo 3.

2643
02:11:01,140 --> 02:11:06,140
If you still feel the need to dish out blame, then I would prefer you direct it at me.

2644
02:11:06,140 --> 02:11:13,140
I was the executive producer on the project, I hired Jay, and I gave him advice and direction through the development process.

2645
02:11:13,140 --> 02:11:18,140
I was ultimately responsible for the game we released and take full responsibility for the quality of the result.

2646
02:11:18,140 --> 02:11:27,140
Very interesting, kind of like, you know, protective parent kind of attitude going on there. That's Karen about your employees. That's interesting.

2647
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:29,140
They could hire me now.

2648
02:11:30,140 --> 02:11:35,140
If you were the lead designer on Diablo 3, what would you do?

2649
02:11:35,140 --> 02:11:37,140
Garris.

2650
02:11:37,140 --> 02:11:40,140
Hey, I didn't say it. I didn't say it.

2651
02:11:40,140 --> 02:11:44,140
I would license out to Bioware to make a Mass Effect MMO.

2652
02:11:44,140 --> 02:11:52,140
Anyhow, now, he acknowledged also, this is what we're saying, the Diablo community deserves an even better game.

2653
02:11:52,140 --> 02:11:59,140
We have a talented team in place and have no intention of stopping work on Diablo 3 until it is the best game in the franchise.

2654
02:11:59,140 --> 02:12:07,140
So interesting, this game is coming up on, what, nine months out and they're still trying to get the game they really want.

2655
02:12:07,140 --> 02:12:15,140
This is a weird place we're at in the industry. I mean, it's not that Diablo 3 is, like, bad, but it was extremely disappointing. Extremely disappointing.

2656
02:12:15,140 --> 02:12:18,140
And Torchlight 2 is kind of better.

2657
02:12:19,140 --> 02:12:24,140
Anyhow, let's open up the mailbag. Let's see what the listeners have to say, shall we?

2658
02:12:26,140 --> 02:12:29,140
Mailbag orangelaunchrater.com is the place you can email us each week.

2659
02:12:29,140 --> 02:12:35,140
And usually Dark Soccer will dive into the email bag head first, but not tonight.

2660
02:12:35,140 --> 02:12:41,140
As you can tell by my sexy ass voice tonight, I really don't have much of a voice to do it.

2661
02:12:41,140 --> 02:12:44,140
Impersonating your mother earlier probably didn't help that.

2662
02:12:44,140 --> 02:12:46,140
No, it didn't. I'm suffering for that now.

2663
02:12:46,140 --> 02:12:48,140
You know what, you need more coffee.

2664
02:12:48,140 --> 02:12:51,140
You know what, that's a good idea and I know where you keep it, but I'm not doing it.

2665
02:12:51,140 --> 02:12:56,140
Alright, let's get to some emails tonight. I want to start with this email.

2666
02:12:56,140 --> 02:13:01,140
From Phlegus, emails us.

2667
02:13:01,140 --> 02:13:07,140
Hello Orangelaunch Radio crew, I'm going to keep this brief as I am most likely going to come off as extremely odd and potentially creepy.

2668
02:13:07,140 --> 02:13:09,140
But I assure you, I'm harmless.

2669
02:13:09,140 --> 02:13:16,140
I've been searching for an online radio show for a long while now and after haphazardly stumbling across this podcast the other day, I have to ask,

2670
02:13:16,140 --> 02:13:22,140
were you ever a Bimani-centric show who possibly covered 2DX8 style previews around late 2002?

2671
02:13:22,140 --> 02:13:26,140
If not, I apologize for the rather odd question and keep up the excellent work.

2672
02:13:26,140 --> 02:13:28,140
Love the show and it's wonderful cast.

2673
02:13:32,140 --> 02:13:34,140
You recognize that from the keyboard mania?

2674
02:13:34,140 --> 02:13:36,140
Yes, that would be us.

2675
02:13:36,140 --> 02:13:38,140
That is the show, absolutely.

2676
02:13:38,140 --> 02:13:45,140
You know, it's funny you should bring up 2DX8 style because you know what this email needs to just make it perfect.

2677
02:13:45,140 --> 02:13:47,140
I mean, I really appreciate the reminiscing.

2678
02:13:47,140 --> 02:13:48,140
More Haulik!

2679
02:13:48,140 --> 02:13:50,140
No, no, no, not more Haulik.

2680
02:13:50,140 --> 02:13:51,140
Dancer?

2681
02:13:51,140 --> 02:13:53,140
Yes, more Dancer.

2682
02:13:53,140 --> 02:13:57,140
This email definitely needs some more Dancer, so let's give him some Dancer.

2683
02:13:57,140 --> 02:13:59,140
God damn it, now I can't find Dancer.

2684
02:13:59,140 --> 02:14:11,140
You know, that was like one of the first Bimani game I actually bought brand new that wasn't a DDR.

2685
02:14:13,140 --> 02:14:14,140
You remember?

2686
02:14:15,140 --> 02:14:19,140
I remember how we would all sit around with like little figurines and stand behind people while they played that.

2687
02:14:19,140 --> 02:14:21,140
That was the best, that was absolutely the best.

2688
02:14:21,140 --> 02:14:24,140
And then try to Para Para with Last Message.

2689
02:14:24,140 --> 02:14:26,140
Here's the thing I want to know about this email.

2690
02:14:26,140 --> 02:14:32,140
So, I actually offline earlier in the week, I wrote back to Playgus, so I'm waiting to hear back.

2691
02:14:32,140 --> 02:14:35,140
And I was like, yeah, it's us, basically, long story short.

2692
02:14:35,140 --> 02:14:40,140
But my curiosity is, I've been searching for an online radio show for a long while now.

2693
02:14:40,140 --> 02:14:47,140
And after haphazardly stumbling across this podcast, so it's like, we was looking for the old show.

2694
02:14:47,140 --> 02:14:49,140
And found this mess instead.

2695
02:14:49,140 --> 02:14:51,140
We still have our Bimani love.

2696
02:14:52,140 --> 02:14:53,140
Of course we have our Bimani love.

2697
02:14:54,140 --> 02:14:56,140
Akira Yamaoka is still God.

2698
02:14:59,140 --> 02:15:02,140
Anyhow, let's move on with more emails.

2699
02:15:02,140 --> 02:15:06,140
Although, although, although I do have to say I have a special, special place in my heart for Desero.

2700
02:15:07,140 --> 02:15:08,140
Oh, why is that?

2701
02:15:08,140 --> 02:15:11,140
Fucking Desero. I love Cobalt.

2702
02:15:11,140 --> 02:15:14,140
Moving on to an email from Redertainment.

2703
02:15:14,140 --> 02:15:20,140
Hello Podcrafters, I've been following the recent discussion about video games needing to be connected to the internet.

2704
02:15:20,140 --> 02:15:21,140
So their users can play them.

2705
02:15:21,140 --> 02:15:27,140
This includes EA's recent SimCity announcement, always on DRM and other issues imposed by game companies.

2706
02:15:27,140 --> 02:15:32,140
In discussing this issue, some have brought up the prospect of the people playing the games not having access to the internet.

2707
02:15:32,140 --> 02:15:35,140
Either because they are poor or because they are in the military.

2708
02:15:35,140 --> 02:15:39,140
There is another aspect to the mandatory internet connection issue that's not being brought up.

2709
02:15:39,140 --> 02:15:43,140
What if the person playing the game can't connect to the publisher's servers.

2710
02:15:43,140 --> 02:15:45,140
Not because of any problem with the consumer or the publisher.

2711
02:15:45,140 --> 02:15:49,140
But because of an ISP's complete and utter fucking incompetence.

2712
02:15:49,140 --> 02:15:56,140
What if due to the ISP being run by morons who think of Foresight as something only the uncircumcised deal with.

2713
02:15:59,140 --> 02:16:00,140
That was good.

2714
02:16:00,140 --> 02:16:07,140
The consumer or the publisher cannot connect to one another because of a failure by one or more internet service providers.

2715
02:16:07,140 --> 02:16:14,140
This is just one of the reasons why I think of publishers mandating consumers to be connected to the internet as a bad idea.

2716
02:16:14,140 --> 02:16:20,140
Stay black. Retertainment. And yes, I did just come up with the Foresight line. Trainer.

2717
02:16:20,140 --> 02:16:24,140
Is that because you always say Garrus? He says trainer? I don't know. Anyway.

2718
02:16:24,140 --> 02:16:29,140
You notice I haven't said it once during the course of the show.

2719
02:16:29,140 --> 02:16:33,140
I've said it like three times now. Shitty internet service providers being a reason.

2720
02:16:33,140 --> 02:16:37,140
Well, I mean, you're preaching to the choir, Retertainment. This shit's a bad idea.

2721
02:16:37,140 --> 02:16:41,140
And you're just throwing another ingredient in the pot on why this is a bad idea.

2722
02:16:41,140 --> 02:16:46,140
I mean, we had in the past, this show would drop several times.

2723
02:16:46,140 --> 02:16:49,140
Now, maybe that wasn't the ISP's fault necessarily.

2724
02:16:49,140 --> 02:16:54,140
But, you know, if you have a bad router or something, you know, you're gonna pay for that with your game.

2725
02:16:54,140 --> 02:16:56,140
It's just ridiculous.

2726
02:16:58,140 --> 02:17:01,140
I agree with you, Retertainment. Yes. Yes, sir. Yes.

2727
02:17:04,140 --> 02:17:06,140
Another email here from AZHP.

2728
02:17:06,140 --> 02:17:09,140
Hey, OLR. This is a long one, by the way, but it's a good one.

2729
02:17:09,140 --> 02:17:12,140
AZHP here. Sorry in advance for the long email. You're forgiven.

2730
02:17:12,140 --> 02:17:16,140
But it's on two subjects that are really important to me, and I'm sure some of you as well.

2731
02:17:16,140 --> 02:17:17,140
So I hope you read it.

2732
02:17:17,140 --> 02:17:24,140
I remember you guys mentioning the awesome Games Done Quick charity marathon for the Prevent Cancer Foundation on the show last week.

2733
02:17:24,140 --> 02:17:28,140
And I wanted to give a little more background on it in case anyone was interested in the marathon or the cause.

2734
02:17:28,140 --> 02:17:33,140
Dozens of speedrunners from around the world, most of whom are record holders for various games,

2735
02:17:34,140 --> 02:17:41,140
paid their way to Washington, D.C. in order to speedrun games in order to raise money to support cancer research.

2736
02:17:41,140 --> 02:17:51,140
Their initial goal was $150,000, but due to the immense generosity of fellow gamers, they managed to raise over $420,000 over a seven-day marathon.

2737
02:17:51,140 --> 02:17:58,140
This means that the Prevent Cancer Foundation will be able to fund five two-year research grants for cancer research.

2738
02:17:58,140 --> 02:17:59,140
Well, job well done.

2739
02:17:59,140 --> 02:18:04,140
I had no idea that they had collected all these travelers from around the world.

2740
02:18:05,140 --> 02:18:08,140
I had no idea whatsoever that that was the case, so thank you for sharing.

2741
02:18:08,140 --> 02:18:14,140
I honestly thought it was like a group of like a college club or something that all was getting together to do it.

2742
02:18:14,140 --> 02:18:16,140
So I think that's really cool.

2743
02:18:17,140 --> 02:18:18,140
So props to you guys.

2744
02:18:19,140 --> 02:18:24,140
Like you guys said, with all the bad press games have gotten due to recent events,

2745
02:18:24,140 --> 02:18:29,140
it's really amazing that these people donated their vacation time and money to support this amazing cause.

2746
02:18:29,140 --> 02:18:33,140
Some of the more impressive runs were Final Fantasy IX done in nine hours,

2747
02:18:33,140 --> 02:18:40,140
Super Mario 64 all 120 stars done in under two hours by the world record holder Siglemic,

2748
02:18:40,140 --> 02:18:46,140
Zelda O'Green of Time done in 23 minutes using some game-breaking bugs, and more.

2749
02:18:46,140 --> 02:18:52,140
All the games were done in one sitting and it was amazing to watch all week, sometimes during work,

2750
02:18:52,140 --> 02:18:56,140
whoops, and see how amazingly good and consistent people were at these games.

2751
02:18:56,140 --> 02:19:01,140
I wasn't going to donate much originally, but after seeing how passionate these people were about the cause and the games,

2752
02:19:01,140 --> 02:19:06,140
I eventually donated $80 over the week, though some people donated hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

2753
02:19:06,140 --> 02:19:12,140
The runners read every donation comment that came through that week, but the one that touched me in a way I wouldn't have expected.

2754
02:19:12,140 --> 02:19:15,140
A donor during the O'Green of Time run said,

2755
02:19:15,140 --> 02:19:20,140
My grandmother's cat died of cancer. She used to watch me play O'Green of Time when I was a kid,

2756
02:19:20,140 --> 02:19:24,140
and I hope that she's watching you speedrun this game from kitty heaven right now.

2757
02:19:24,140 --> 02:19:30,140
I know it's silly, but I teared up a little bit. No, that's, that's, that's really adorable.

2758
02:19:30,140 --> 02:19:32,140
And it is sad.

2759
02:19:32,140 --> 02:19:35,140
Sorry for the long email, guys. You're forgiven. Good cause.

2760
02:19:35,140 --> 02:19:43,140
And in case anyone is interested in watching the marathon videos, you can find them in the features section of speeddemosarchive.com.

2761
02:19:43,140 --> 02:19:48,140
Yours truly AZHP. Well, I hope it's an even bigger success for them next year.

2762
02:19:48,140 --> 02:19:52,140
I didn't realize they were bringing all these people in. They could do an expo out of this shit. That's...

2763
02:19:52,140 --> 02:19:54,140
A speedrun expo would be pretty awesome.

2764
02:19:54,140 --> 02:19:59,140
Yeah, it would be, actually. So, you know, bigger and better next time.

2765
02:19:59,140 --> 02:20:02,140
That's great. Good job, guys.

2766
02:20:02,140 --> 02:20:06,140
If anybody from that effort is listening, a tip of the hat to you.

2767
02:20:06,140 --> 02:20:12,140
Lastly, but not leastly, gamergirl with an email.

2768
02:20:12,140 --> 02:20:16,140
Or as she signed it, GG. Good game, gamergirl.

2769
02:20:16,140 --> 02:20:22,140
Dear OLR, I first would like to say that if I make any mistakes, i.e. grammatical errors, I apologize.

2770
02:20:22,140 --> 02:20:25,140
You guys, as always, have an amazing show. Keep up the good work.

2771
02:20:25,140 --> 02:20:30,140
I never thought my life would change so drastically with everyone's help.

2772
02:20:30,140 --> 02:20:33,140
I got to thinking a lot about how everything good happened to me because of OLR,

2773
02:20:33,140 --> 02:20:37,140
and it never ceases to amaze me how you guys are always helping everyone.

2774
02:20:37,140 --> 02:20:45,140
As a matter of fact, as of January 19th, 2013, your very own Dark Tetsuya and gamergirl are officially engaged.

2775
02:20:45,140 --> 02:20:48,140
Wow. Congratulations.

2776
02:20:48,140 --> 02:20:54,140
Another OLR love story for the books, guys. Well done. As always, I enjoy the show.

2777
02:20:54,140 --> 02:20:58,140
Thanks again for introducing me to my best friend and soon to be life partner, gamergirl.

2778
02:20:58,140 --> 02:21:00,140
Wow.

2779
02:21:01,140 --> 02:21:03,140
I happened to see that on Facebook earlier.

2780
02:21:03,140 --> 02:21:08,140
Yeah, yeah. I had heard of this before the email came in, but still.

2781
02:21:08,140 --> 02:21:17,140
Just to kind of have it put in that perspective kind of way that they had met through OLR is really like, wow.

2782
02:21:17,140 --> 02:21:21,140
I've been blown away with some of the emails and comments we've been getting the past couple weeks.

2783
02:21:21,140 --> 02:21:25,140
2013 is the year you're trying to make me cry, y'all.

2784
02:21:25,140 --> 02:21:30,140
Well, good job. Does this mean we have to send over? I don't know where they're getting married or whatever,

2785
02:21:30,140 --> 02:21:34,140
if it's going to be here or because I think they have a distance right now between them.

2786
02:21:34,140 --> 02:21:40,140
But I wonder if we need to send along a tape message or something, or is that even appropriate? I don't know.

2787
02:21:40,140 --> 02:21:45,140
You know what? Get the speed run demo, guys, at your wedding reception. That's how you do it.

2788
02:21:45,140 --> 02:21:47,140
That'd be great.

2789
02:21:47,140 --> 02:21:52,140
Good job. A big congratulations and a perfect way to end the mailbag this week.

2790
02:21:52,140 --> 02:21:56,140
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. Wowzy, wowzy, wow.

2791
02:21:56,140 --> 02:21:58,140
Thanks for doing the mailbox for me.

2792
02:21:58,140 --> 02:22:03,140
You're welcome, but you're going to need to fend for yourself on this upcoming segment.

2793
02:22:03,140 --> 02:22:07,140
We're going to flip a 180, turn this car around and go from lovey-dovey stuff.

2794
02:22:07,140 --> 02:22:09,140
We're going to flip this bitch.

2795
02:22:09,140 --> 02:22:12,140
We're going to flip a bitch right now and get into the bitching.

2796
02:22:22,140 --> 02:22:27,140
This is punishment. This is fucked up.

2797
02:22:27,140 --> 02:22:33,140
My F.U. goes to the old woman who is driving in front of me on my way here.

2798
02:22:33,140 --> 02:22:39,140
You know how some people turn into the suicide lane, the turn lane in the middle?

2799
02:22:39,140 --> 02:22:43,140
Well, this woman doesn't even signal the moment this red truck starts pulling into it.

2800
02:22:43,140 --> 02:22:46,140
We're on the inside lane heading toward here.

2801
02:22:46,140 --> 02:22:49,140
She just swerves into the right lane, doesn't even look if there's somebody else there.

2802
02:22:49,140 --> 02:22:52,140
And I'm like, really, bitch? You thought that he was going to run into you?

2803
02:22:52,140 --> 02:22:54,140
Ugh, I was just so tired.

2804
02:22:54,140 --> 02:22:59,140
And so finally I ended up thinking, this woman is dangerous. I'm getting away from her.

2805
02:22:59,140 --> 02:23:02,140
And so I sped around her and got away from her.

2806
02:23:02,140 --> 02:23:05,140
And she was just moving back and forth in between lanes.

2807
02:23:05,140 --> 02:23:09,140
She's like, I'm going to use both lanes. Fuck. I'm safer in the middle.

2808
02:23:09,140 --> 02:23:14,140
So I was like, yeah. Another F.U. goes to me losing my voice.

2809
02:23:15,140 --> 02:23:19,140
I've been fighting off getting sick and I think I'm over it.

2810
02:23:19,140 --> 02:23:23,140
It's just left me with a really sore throat. So, yeah.

2811
02:23:26,140 --> 02:23:28,140
F.U. to my throat for hurting.

2812
02:23:28,140 --> 02:23:34,140
And F.U. for my brain being tired when I want to do something that involves a lot of thinking.

2813
02:23:34,140 --> 02:23:38,140
Especially in the form of actually working with some programs and stuff that I have on here.

2814
02:23:38,140 --> 02:23:41,140
Or learning to program, that would be fantastic.

2815
02:23:41,140 --> 02:23:43,140
But it seems like whenever I do that.

2816
02:23:43,140 --> 02:23:48,140
If somebody decides to watch Law and Order SVU, my brain is just like.

2817
02:23:48,140 --> 02:23:50,140
Like I just can't fucking concentrate.

2818
02:23:50,140 --> 02:23:54,140
Hey, Dark Tetsuya and Gamer Girl, guess what you have to look forward to?

2819
02:23:56,140 --> 02:23:57,140
Thank you.

2820
02:23:57,140 --> 02:23:58,140
Married life.

2821
02:23:58,140 --> 02:24:00,140
Thankfully we are almost done with Law and Order SVU.

2822
02:24:00,140 --> 02:24:04,140
We are in the 14th season. We are on the home stretch. It is almost over.

2823
02:24:04,140 --> 02:24:07,140
I just realized today, because we're sharing a Hulu account with some other people.

2824
02:24:07,140 --> 02:24:11,140
That American Idol just started. I'm like, when the fuck did that start?

2825
02:24:11,140 --> 02:24:14,140
I knew because my mom had to call me and tell me about how she.

2826
02:24:14,140 --> 02:24:17,140
Rab! American Idol is on and this girl is good.

2827
02:24:17,140 --> 02:24:23,140
No, no. She is over the Nicki Minaj Mariah thing. She is over that.

2828
02:24:23,140 --> 02:24:25,140
I didn't even see the picture.

2829
02:24:25,140 --> 02:24:29,140
I had no idea because I don't watch cable anymore or even basic TV anymore.

2830
02:24:29,140 --> 02:24:34,140
So, it's like I didn't even know. That's just crazy that I shouldn't.

2831
02:24:34,140 --> 02:24:36,140
I see the billboards.

2832
02:24:36,140 --> 02:24:39,140
Well, in San Francisco. There was a huge one going over the Bay Bridge.

2833
02:24:39,140 --> 02:24:42,140
Yeah, so, I mean, that's the crime.

2834
02:24:42,140 --> 02:24:45,140
All right, uh, let's see. My Fuse of the Week.

2835
02:24:45,140 --> 02:24:48,140
I've been getting like weird side pains again and that always freaks me out.

2836
02:24:48,140 --> 02:24:51,140
Because, you know, long time listeners of the show remember like five years ago,

2837
02:24:51,140 --> 02:24:53,140
I was in the hospital beating some of that stuff.

2838
02:24:53,140 --> 02:24:55,140
So, like every time I get side pains, I get like really freaked out.

2839
02:24:55,140 --> 02:24:57,140
Like, oh my God, I'm sick again.

2840
02:24:57,140 --> 02:24:58,140
And then it's gas.

2841
02:24:58,140 --> 02:25:01,140
Yeah, or like I'm just gaining weight or something.

2842
02:25:01,140 --> 02:25:05,140
So, here's to hoping it's fat if nothing else.

2843
02:25:05,140 --> 02:25:07,140
Hey, Rob. Avoid the Taco Bell.

2844
02:25:07,140 --> 02:25:08,140
What?

2845
02:25:09,140 --> 02:25:11,140
I didn't eat Jack in the Box.

2846
02:25:11,140 --> 02:25:13,140
Loki talked about it.

2847
02:25:13,140 --> 02:25:15,140
I wanted to eat Jack in the Box today.

2848
02:25:15,140 --> 02:25:17,140
I really wanted to go there and be late.

2849
02:25:17,140 --> 02:25:21,140
But I wanted, we went out for gay brunch as we usually do on Sundays.

2850
02:25:21,140 --> 02:25:23,140
And I call it gay brunch because we eat brunch with other gays.

2851
02:25:23,140 --> 02:25:26,140
And I wanted to eat healthy.

2852
02:25:26,140 --> 02:25:30,140
But I'm sorry, sir. We don't do salads until 1130.

2853
02:25:30,140 --> 02:25:33,140
LOL. It's time for red velvet pancakes.

2854
02:25:33,140 --> 02:25:34,140
Yeah, I know, right?

2855
02:25:34,140 --> 02:25:37,140
Well, I got like Hawaiian bread French toast, which is really good.

2856
02:25:37,140 --> 02:25:41,140
Don't get me wrong, but probably not the healthiest thing I could eat.

2857
02:25:41,140 --> 02:25:45,140
Whereas Alan's like, well, I was going to eat the veggie omelet,

2858
02:25:45,140 --> 02:25:48,140
but I decided I'd go a little dairy and get turkey.

2859
02:25:50,140 --> 02:25:52,140
By the way, Alan has lost like a lot of weight.

2860
02:25:52,140 --> 02:25:55,140
I was about to say, Alan's doing really, really well.

2861
02:25:55,140 --> 02:26:00,140
You think I would like, you know, try to take some cues and do the same thing.

2862
02:26:00,140 --> 02:26:05,140
Now you can be the like, what's the old-ass poem Jack Spratt and his wife?

2863
02:26:05,140 --> 02:26:07,140
Well, here's the thing.

2864
02:26:07,140 --> 02:26:10,140
Alan's got the advantage on me where he walks to work and all that.

2865
02:26:10,140 --> 02:26:13,140
And I've been very bad when it gets too motivated for exercise.

2866
02:26:13,140 --> 02:26:15,140
Like I really need to really motivate myself to exercise.

2867
02:26:15,140 --> 02:26:17,140
It's the only way I'm ever going to change things.

2868
02:26:17,140 --> 02:26:20,140
And then snacking. I am a terrible, terrible snacker.

2869
02:26:20,140 --> 02:26:22,140
Like that is my weakness.

2870
02:26:22,140 --> 02:26:27,140
I really need to just get rid of every horrible snack out of this house

2871
02:26:27,140 --> 02:26:29,140
and have nothing but carrots and celery in the fridge so I have no choice.

2872
02:26:29,140 --> 02:26:30,140
But then that's not fair at all.

2873
02:26:30,140 --> 02:26:33,140
On Fridays at our work, they pop popcorn in the popcorn machine that we have.

2874
02:26:33,140 --> 02:26:35,140
And I'm not talking about like a popcorn machine like an air popper.

2875
02:26:35,140 --> 02:26:40,140
I'm talking about a big fucking popcorn machine that they have at the movie theater's popcorn machine.

2876
02:26:40,140 --> 02:26:42,140
They pop extra popcorn for me.

2877
02:26:42,140 --> 02:26:46,140
They gave me a bowl. Like a big-ass bowl.

2878
02:26:46,140 --> 02:26:50,140
I eat more popcorn at that company than the fucking people at the company other than me.

2879
02:26:50,140 --> 02:26:52,140
Of course, I don't eat it all.

2880
02:26:52,140 --> 02:26:55,140
I normally skip lunch that day, but that's a lot of popcorn.

2881
02:26:55,140 --> 02:26:56,140
That's a lot of popcorn.

2882
02:26:56,140 --> 02:26:57,140
Some questions in the chat room.

2883
02:26:57,140 --> 02:26:59,140
Acidic Vampire in the chat says,

2884
02:26:59,140 --> 02:27:01,140
Red velvet pancakes? The fuck? I want that.

2885
02:27:01,140 --> 02:27:03,140
Is that a West Coast thing for Jack in the Box?

2886
02:27:03,140 --> 02:27:04,140
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2887
02:27:04,140 --> 02:27:07,140
Don't get them, by the way, at Denny's because they're awful.

2888
02:27:07,140 --> 02:27:08,140
They just like hush puppies.

2889
02:27:08,140 --> 02:27:09,140
They're just red food coloring. Yes.

2890
02:27:09,140 --> 02:27:12,140
Denny's does have the red velvet, but it's not like, it's not.

2891
02:27:12,140 --> 02:27:16,140
It's on the Hobbit menu so it gives you cancer and makes you live underground.

2892
02:27:16,140 --> 02:27:17,140
So here's the thing.

2893
02:27:17,140 --> 02:27:19,140
They don't have that at Jack in the Box.

2894
02:27:19,140 --> 02:27:21,140
No. Jack in the Box has deep fried tacos.

2895
02:27:21,140 --> 02:27:23,140
That's what you get at Jack in the Box.

2896
02:27:23,140 --> 02:27:24,140
Red velvet pancakes.

2897
02:27:24,140 --> 02:27:27,140
We went to a brunch place once and they happen to have red velvet pancakes.

2898
02:27:27,140 --> 02:27:29,140
It was like, oh my God.

2899
02:27:29,140 --> 02:27:30,140
That we went to.

2900
02:27:30,140 --> 02:27:31,140
Was it Red Rabbit?

2901
02:27:31,140 --> 02:27:32,140
I think so.

2902
02:27:32,140 --> 02:27:34,140
I went to have the pumpkin and you had red velvet.

2903
02:27:34,140 --> 02:27:36,140
Yeah. Fucking amazing.

2904
02:27:36,140 --> 02:27:38,140
I want pancakes now.

2905
02:27:38,140 --> 02:27:40,140
Good times. Pancakes.

2906
02:27:40,140 --> 02:27:42,140
All right. That's it for the FUs of the week.

2907
02:27:42,140 --> 02:27:43,140
Skype line soon.

2908
02:27:43,140 --> 02:27:44,140
Twitter topic soon as well.

2909
02:27:44,140 --> 02:27:47,140
But first, a couple more news stories.

2910
02:27:47,140 --> 02:27:48,140
All right.

2911
02:27:48,140 --> 02:27:50,140
And let's see here.

2912
02:27:50,140 --> 02:28:02,140
Let's talk a little bit about the next generation of Kinect because of course we know that the next Xbox system is going to have Kinect and we need to know what the hell it's going to be able to do.

2913
02:28:02,140 --> 02:28:04,140
Well, this may be kind of an idea.

2914
02:28:04,140 --> 02:28:14,140
The company that was behind the Kinect sensor in the first place has this cool video that they put out kind of showing what it's going to do.

2915
02:28:14,140 --> 02:28:21,140
And basically everything that the original Kinect was supposed to do but didn't actually kind of do.

2916
02:28:21,140 --> 02:28:23,140
You know, the whole closed thing.

2917
02:28:23,140 --> 02:28:33,140
They're saying that they're going to try to work this technology into pretty much everything into like, you know, non display stuff to all the computers.

2918
02:28:33,140 --> 02:28:34,140
And it's just going to work.

2919
02:28:34,140 --> 02:28:38,140
It's going to have, you know, high speed tracking, all that stuff.

2920
02:28:38,140 --> 02:28:45,140
And actually the little thing that they've got there, the prototype looks exactly like the Kinect with some extra bullshit sticking out of the top.

2921
02:28:45,140 --> 02:28:49,140
I'm not really sure what the hell that is, but it's in developers hands right now.

2922
02:28:49,140 --> 02:28:54,140
So they're going to be using this and it's called Capri.

2923
02:28:54,140 --> 02:28:59,140
The next generation of sensors.

2924
02:28:59,140 --> 02:29:01,140
The next generation.

2925
02:29:01,140 --> 02:29:06,140
Yeah, they're saying it's supposed to have they're going to be trying to fit it into everyday devices.

2926
02:29:06,140 --> 02:29:10,140
And they're seeing it the same resolution as the Kinect.

2927
02:29:10,140 --> 02:29:13,140
And it looks it looks pretty cool.

2928
02:29:13,140 --> 02:29:21,140
I mean, the video like watching the video reminded me a lot of just like everything like they show this guy at a presentation.

2929
02:29:21,140 --> 02:29:28,140
He's, you know, you know, manipulating stuff on the screen as you would think, you know, that you would be able to do.

2930
02:29:28,140 --> 02:29:36,140
You know, there's talking about like, you know, even stuff to where, you know, oh, hey, I have someone coming over and facial recognition.

2931
02:29:36,140 --> 02:29:37,140
Oh, it's my friend.

2932
02:29:37,140 --> 02:29:39,140
It's going to unlock the door for him.

2933
02:29:39,140 --> 02:29:41,140
And then he comes in and murders you.

2934
02:29:41,140 --> 02:29:48,140
You know, that's for like switching channels on your TV by just like kind of going and moving my hand back and forth.

2935
02:29:48,140 --> 02:29:51,140
That type of stuff, because, you know, pushing buttons are both so hard.

2936
02:29:51,140 --> 02:29:53,140
Move my hand back and forth.

2937
02:29:53,140 --> 02:29:57,140
Swiping a fly away. Your TV's going crazy.

2938
02:29:57,140 --> 02:30:00,140
All right. One more news story for you guys.

2939
02:30:00,140 --> 02:30:05,140
OK, this isn't gaming technically, but it is the voice of geeks network, you guys.

2940
02:30:05,140 --> 02:30:08,140
So once in a while, we got to blur the line a little bit.

2941
02:30:08,140 --> 02:30:17,140
And this has to do with a musician who did make one of like the greatest video game songs of the past 10 years still alive from Portal.

2942
02:30:17,140 --> 02:30:20,140
Right.

2943
02:30:20,140 --> 02:30:24,140
I'm making a joke. Oh, I'm talking about Jonathan.

2944
02:30:24,140 --> 02:30:27,140
So nice in person.

2945
02:30:27,140 --> 02:30:29,140
He's a lovable nerd.

2946
02:30:29,140 --> 02:30:36,140
And so, of course, the Internet rallied to his defense when people kind of wronged him.

2947
02:30:36,140 --> 02:30:39,140
This has to do with the Glee issue.

2948
02:30:39,140 --> 02:30:43,140
Here's the thing. An upcoming episode of Glee is going to feature Baby Got Back.

2949
02:30:43,140 --> 02:30:46,140
Now, Baby Got Back was a Sir Mix-a-Lot song.

2950
02:30:46,140 --> 02:30:52,140
But a few years ago, I think it was 2006, Joko did his own version of Baby Got Back.

2951
02:30:52,140 --> 02:30:54,140
And it was very different.

2952
02:31:01,140 --> 02:31:03,140
The Joko version.

2953
02:31:08,140 --> 02:31:10,140
You never heard this, huh?

2954
02:31:10,140 --> 02:31:12,140
I listened to it after.

2955
02:31:12,140 --> 02:31:15,140
The lounge version by Lounge Against the Machine.

2956
02:31:15,140 --> 02:31:17,140
Right, right.

2957
02:31:17,140 --> 02:31:19,140
Yeah, Richard Cheeze.

2958
02:31:19,140 --> 02:31:21,140
And, you know, of course, Mr. Mix-a-Lot.

2959
02:31:21,140 --> 02:31:24,140
So technically it is Sir Mix-a-Lot's song.

2960
02:31:24,140 --> 02:31:26,140
And Joko did a cover.

2961
02:31:26,140 --> 02:31:28,140
He did a cover, but it was a licensed cover.

2962
02:31:28,140 --> 02:31:31,140
He licensed the rights to do that and he made his own original version.

2963
02:31:31,140 --> 02:31:34,140
It's very unique and, you know, very different.

2964
02:31:34,140 --> 02:31:37,140
It's kind of like Johnny Cash's Hurt.

2965
02:31:37,140 --> 02:31:39,140
Like the Nine Inch Nails version. Amazing.

2966
02:31:39,140 --> 02:31:41,140
Johnny Cash's version.

2967
02:31:41,140 --> 02:31:43,140
Fucking amazing.

2968
02:31:43,140 --> 02:31:45,140
It's hard for me to say that because I love the Nine Inch Nails version so much.

2969
02:31:45,140 --> 02:31:48,140
But they are both so fucking good.

2970
02:31:48,140 --> 02:31:53,140
When Trent Reznor is saying that he likes it better, then you know you've got amazing.

2971
02:31:53,140 --> 02:31:55,140
But here's the problem.

2972
02:31:55,140 --> 02:31:57,140
Glee, the TV show.

2973
02:31:57,140 --> 02:32:00,140
They do a lot of covers and all that stuff.

2974
02:32:00,140 --> 02:32:08,140
Here is the Glee version of Baby Got Back set to be on the Sadie Hawkins episode that will be on the 24th.

2975
02:32:08,140 --> 02:32:11,140
This song was available in the US iTunes store.

2976
02:32:11,140 --> 02:32:14,140
It was pulled. It was still spotted on the Swedish iTunes store.

2977
02:32:14,140 --> 02:32:16,140
So yes, this is legit.

2978
02:32:16,140 --> 02:32:19,140
See if you see any similarities here in the Glee version of Baby Got Back.

2979
02:32:38,140 --> 02:32:42,140
I think I heard that before somewhere.

2980
02:32:42,140 --> 02:32:44,140
Look.

2981
02:32:44,140 --> 02:32:47,140
It's one thing to cover the song, especially when you're going to do it.

2982
02:32:47,140 --> 02:32:49,140
Like the original.

2983
02:32:49,140 --> 02:32:52,140
I don't think I need to play the original version of Baby Got Back.

2984
02:32:52,140 --> 02:32:57,140
But I'll do the Rob Roberts cover of Baby Got Back.

2985
02:32:57,140 --> 02:32:58,140
You ready?

2986
02:32:58,140 --> 02:33:00,140
Oh. My. God.

2987
02:33:00,140 --> 02:33:02,140
Becky, look at her butt.

2988
02:33:02,140 --> 02:33:04,140
It is so big.

2989
02:33:04,140 --> 02:33:06,140
Obviously the original was very, very different.

2990
02:33:06,140 --> 02:33:08,140
It had the whole beat to it.

2991
02:33:08,140 --> 02:33:13,140
So for Glee to just totally rip this off the way they did is kind of shitty.

2992
02:33:13,140 --> 02:33:15,140
It's really shitty.

2993
02:33:15,140 --> 02:33:18,140
To think that nobody would notice is crazy.

2994
02:33:18,140 --> 02:33:24,140
Now, just so you know, Joko, what is making the internet rally around him is that he posted to his Twitter.

2995
02:33:24,140 --> 02:33:26,140
I had no idea.

2996
02:33:26,140 --> 02:33:28,140
He had no clue.

2997
02:33:28,140 --> 02:33:30,140
And he's like, WTF.

2998
02:33:30,140 --> 02:33:32,140
And he is trying to see what kind of legal action is available at this point, but it's complicated.

2999
02:33:32,140 --> 02:33:36,140
I mean, it wasn't really his song in the first place, although it was his arrangement.

3000
02:33:36,140 --> 02:33:39,140
Here's the best part. You might be getting to this, Loki.

3001
02:33:39,140 --> 02:33:47,140
In the lyrics, if I were to play the full thing, a part where he changed the lyrics from Sir Mix-a-Lot to Johnny C.

3002
02:33:47,140 --> 02:33:51,140
Glee sings in their version, Johnny C.

3003
02:33:51,140 --> 02:33:53,140
So you know damn well where they got it.

3004
02:33:53,140 --> 02:33:55,140
There is no mystery.

3005
02:33:55,140 --> 02:33:57,140
They removed one of them at the end.

3006
02:33:57,140 --> 02:34:02,140
The 1-900, he did something else.

3007
02:34:02,140 --> 02:34:04,140
1-900 something and then he changed it.

3008
02:34:08,140 --> 02:34:10,140
I mean, come on, man.

3009
02:34:10,140 --> 02:34:12,140
That is just blatant.

3010
02:34:12,140 --> 02:34:17,140
And even he said they stole the arrangement.

3011
02:34:17,140 --> 02:34:24,140
There's actually duck sounds or something in the background that he sampled or something that are in that song in exactly the same spot.

3012
02:34:24,140 --> 02:34:27,140
Like they stole the instrumental and just sang over it.

3013
02:34:32,140 --> 02:34:34,140
So yeah, I don't know what's going to happen from here.

3014
02:34:34,140 --> 02:34:37,140
Do you think legally he could do anything about it?

3015
02:34:37,140 --> 02:34:38,140
Yeah, he can. I think he can.

3016
02:34:38,140 --> 02:34:40,140
If they actually stole the lyrics or whatever?

3017
02:34:40,140 --> 02:34:42,140
Yeah, because it's his arrangement.

3018
02:34:42,140 --> 02:34:44,140
I think that he definitely has a case.

3019
02:34:46,140 --> 02:34:51,140
Well, gee, the folks in the chat rooms really seem to be enjoying the Rob Roberts cover of Baby Got Back.

3020
02:34:51,140 --> 02:34:53,140
So big butts and I cannot lie.

3021
02:34:53,140 --> 02:34:55,140
You other brothers can't deny.

3022
02:35:00,140 --> 02:35:01,140
The original is awesome.

3023
02:35:01,140 --> 02:35:03,140
Meanwhile, Alan is like, please stop.

3024
02:35:03,140 --> 02:35:04,140
Please don't.

3025
02:35:04,140 --> 02:35:05,140
Knock it off.

3026
02:35:05,140 --> 02:35:07,140
Yeah, but Alan, you weren't here watching Rob shake his ass.

3027
02:35:09,140 --> 02:35:11,140
I like Ross Steel UT's comment.

3028
02:35:11,140 --> 02:35:13,140
Seriously, that's some Milli Vanilli shit.

3029
02:35:15,140 --> 02:35:17,140
There's a little bit of a clap that I heard in the beginning.

3030
02:35:17,140 --> 02:35:24,140
I want them to do the vanilla ice defense where it's like, but see, mine went, you know, the original went boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

3031
02:35:24,140 --> 02:35:27,140
But mine went boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

3032
02:35:27,140 --> 02:35:29,140
You see, it's different, right?

3033
02:35:29,140 --> 02:35:30,140
Totally.

3034
02:35:30,140 --> 02:35:32,140
It's totally different.

3035
02:35:32,140 --> 02:35:34,140
We added the the in there.

3036
02:35:34,140 --> 02:35:35,140
It makes it different.

3037
02:35:35,140 --> 02:35:36,140
Yeah.

3038
02:35:36,140 --> 02:35:37,140
So under pressure.

3039
02:35:37,140 --> 02:35:39,140
Rama in the chat says, wait, hold it.

3040
02:35:39,140 --> 02:35:43,140
Glee is still relevant apparently, but it's sinking in the ratings, but they're going to I think I heard they're going to.

3041
02:35:44,140 --> 02:35:51,140
I want to know, OK, because it's supposed to be this new guy that's coming to the school or whatever that's hitting on the the, you know, the clearly gay guy on the show.

3042
02:35:51,140 --> 02:35:58,140
Isn't it a little awkward to be singing a song about I like big butts and like about all these things about butts that you like and stuff?

3043
02:35:58,140 --> 02:36:00,140
Because it seems a little weird.

3044
02:36:00,140 --> 02:36:01,140
I mean.

3045
02:36:02,140 --> 02:36:03,140
I don't know.

3046
02:36:04,140 --> 02:36:08,140
It's just a weird song anyway, because no one over 12 watches Glee in the first place.

3047
02:36:09,140 --> 02:36:14,140
And honestly, the people that, you know, watch Glee or whatever, do they really know what baby got back is?

3048
02:36:14,140 --> 02:36:18,140
I mean, a lot of the kids were probably not even born when that song came out.

3049
02:36:21,140 --> 02:36:22,140
I don't know.

3050
02:36:22,140 --> 02:36:23,140
Is it that old?

3051
02:36:23,140 --> 02:36:24,140
All I do.

3052
02:36:24,140 --> 02:36:26,140
I just I just wish Glee would get canceled.

3053
02:36:26,140 --> 02:36:27,140
That's what I wish.

3054
02:36:28,140 --> 02:36:29,140
All right.

3055
02:36:30,140 --> 02:36:32,140
That does it for news tonight.

3056
02:36:32,140 --> 02:36:33,140
That was the last story.

3057
02:36:34,140 --> 02:36:36,140
1877 Game OLR.

3058
02:36:36,140 --> 02:36:39,140
Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

3059
02:36:39,140 --> 02:36:42,140
The Skype line is open right now if you want to give us a call.

3060
02:36:42,140 --> 02:36:45,140
And while we wait for some calls to come in.

3061
02:36:45,140 --> 02:36:47,140
Oh, it is already lighting up on the phone.

3062
02:36:47,140 --> 02:36:50,140
Let's go to the phones and say hello to whoever's on the line.

3063
02:36:50,140 --> 02:36:52,140
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3064
02:36:52,140 --> 02:36:53,140
Who's this?

3065
02:36:53,140 --> 02:36:54,140
Hi.

3066
02:36:54,140 --> 02:36:55,140
Hi.

3067
02:36:55,140 --> 02:36:56,140
Is that Bobby Blackwolf?

3068
02:36:56,140 --> 02:36:57,140
It's Bobby.

3069
02:36:57,140 --> 02:36:58,140
Hi, Bobby.

3070
02:36:58,140 --> 02:37:00,140
You don't sound so good, Bobby.

3071
02:37:00,140 --> 02:37:03,140
I feel like a sad panda or I should say a sad little birdie.

3072
02:37:03,140 --> 02:37:04,140
What's wrong, Bobby?

3073
02:37:04,140 --> 02:37:05,140
Sportsball.

3074
02:37:05,140 --> 02:37:09,140
Oh, did you have a rough day at work?

3075
02:37:11,140 --> 02:37:12,140
I need to cheer up.

3076
02:37:12,140 --> 02:37:13,140
Are there any new games coming out?

3077
02:37:13,140 --> 02:37:14,140
I need a diversion.

3078
02:37:14,140 --> 02:37:15,140
Not really.

3079
02:37:15,140 --> 02:37:16,140
Double may cry.

3080
02:37:16,140 --> 02:37:17,140
There's Nino Cooney.

3081
02:37:17,140 --> 02:37:19,140
Nino Cooney's coming out this week, Bobby.

3082
02:37:21,140 --> 02:37:23,140
You could try the demo.

3083
02:37:25,140 --> 02:37:27,140
You could try your face.

3084
02:37:27,140 --> 02:37:28,140
Hey, wait.

3085
02:37:28,140 --> 02:37:30,140
Bobby, that's a response after my own heart.

3086
02:37:30,140 --> 02:37:32,140
That's the Jamie defense right there.

3087
02:37:32,140 --> 02:37:36,140
Okay, Bobby, it's just a game, Bobby.

3088
02:37:36,140 --> 02:37:39,140
Here, I got something to help you out, okay?

3089
02:37:39,140 --> 02:37:42,140
Let's go back to a time when your team was winning things,

3090
02:37:42,140 --> 02:37:45,140
which I don't know if that actually exists,

3091
02:37:45,140 --> 02:37:49,140
but we'll make believe that there was a time your team was winning things.

3092
02:37:49,140 --> 02:37:54,140
No, seriously, you posted on Twitter this week some classic G4 material,

3093
02:37:54,140 --> 02:37:58,140
which is appropriately timed with the whole G4 officially dead,

3094
02:37:58,140 --> 02:38:01,140
even though many of us say it had the life sucked out of it years ago.

3095
02:38:01,140 --> 02:38:08,140
You were posting some classic stuff from G4's little 2020-style show Pulse, right?

3096
02:38:08,140 --> 02:38:09,140
Right.

3097
02:38:09,140 --> 02:38:12,140
It wasn't 2020 as much as it was just the news.

3098
02:38:12,140 --> 02:38:15,140
It kind of had a 2020 vibe to me, but yeah.

3099
02:38:15,140 --> 02:38:19,140
How many legit gamer news shows do you see on TV now?

3100
02:38:19,140 --> 02:38:20,140
Not a lot.

3101
02:38:20,140 --> 02:38:22,140
Yeah, exactly.

3102
02:38:22,140 --> 02:38:27,140
But it was a clip from the Philly Classic Game Expo, right?

3103
02:38:27,140 --> 02:38:33,140
Right. It was from 2004, in I think March of 2004,

3104
02:38:33,140 --> 02:38:35,140
and it was the Philly Classic Gaming Expo,

3105
02:38:35,140 --> 02:38:39,140
and I was actually a co-organizer of it along with a couple other people,

3106
02:38:39,140 --> 02:38:43,140
one of which was another moderator on the forums over at G4.

3107
02:38:43,140 --> 02:38:49,140
We had all converged on Philly Classic 4 the year before,

3108
02:38:49,140 --> 02:38:52,140
and we kind of had a table, and it was kind of a G4 forum meetup and stuff,

3109
02:38:52,140 --> 02:38:54,140
and we had about 15 people.

3110
02:38:54,140 --> 02:38:57,140
And for Philly Classic 5, it was like 50 people.

3111
02:38:57,140 --> 02:39:00,140
It was kind of like our PAX08 experience.

3112
02:39:00,140 --> 02:39:02,140
Yeah, oh man, I love PAX08.

3113
02:39:02,140 --> 02:39:04,140
But it was basically the G4 version of it.

3114
02:39:04,140 --> 02:39:05,140
Right.

3115
02:39:05,140 --> 02:39:09,140
And what a lot of people in the OR audience latched onto

3116
02:39:09,140 --> 02:39:12,140
was the fact that when I was on it, Beardless,

3117
02:39:12,140 --> 02:39:14,140
because this was before the beard,

3118
02:39:14,140 --> 02:39:17,140
there was a little bit of Bimani behind me,

3119
02:39:17,140 --> 02:39:21,140
and that was actually my setup at the show.

3120
02:39:21,140 --> 02:39:25,140
So as much as I rag on Bimani now, it wasn't dead then.

3121
02:39:25,140 --> 02:39:28,140
I think 7th Style had just come out maybe,

3122
02:39:28,140 --> 02:39:30,140
or it was right around that time.

3123
02:39:30,140 --> 02:39:32,140
I'm not dead yet.

3124
02:39:32,140 --> 02:39:35,140
And this was before Guitar Hero, so I'm like,

3125
02:39:35,140 --> 02:39:38,140
these are classics, instant classics, that's what I'll call it.

3126
02:39:38,140 --> 02:39:43,140
And he wanted some Ruddy Gore, Mark Wolf, who's in the video.

3127
02:39:43,140 --> 02:39:46,140
He kind of wanted some other different type of stuff,

3128
02:39:46,140 --> 02:39:48,140
so I'm like, fine, I'll bring my stuff,

3129
02:39:48,140 --> 02:39:50,140
all my import consoles and everything,

3130
02:39:50,140 --> 02:39:53,140
and I brought my stereo system and they provided the TV,

3131
02:39:53,140 --> 02:39:58,140
and I would run that weekend, I think I ran Beatmania 2DX,

3132
02:39:58,140 --> 02:40:01,140
I had Para Para Paradise, which we played once,

3133
02:40:01,140 --> 02:40:05,140
because of just the spacing.

3134
02:40:05,140 --> 02:40:09,140
I had Taiko no Tetsujin, and I had Donkey Konga,

3135
02:40:09,140 --> 02:40:11,140
I had both versions.

3136
02:40:11,140 --> 02:40:15,140
And Tommy Tallarico was the first time he had ever played it.

3137
02:40:15,140 --> 02:40:16,140
Oh wow.

3138
02:40:16,140 --> 02:40:18,140
And so one of the pictures I posted up on Twitter

3139
02:40:18,140 --> 02:40:21,140
was actually Tommy Tallarico playing Taiko no Tetsujin for the first time.

3140
02:40:21,140 --> 02:40:23,140
Oh, funny.

3141
02:40:23,140 --> 02:40:25,140
Because he was there, he was one of the guests there,

3142
02:40:25,140 --> 02:40:30,140
they actually had, I think it was Philly Classic 4,

3143
02:40:30,140 --> 02:40:32,140
they actually had, and I can't remember her name,

3144
02:40:32,140 --> 02:40:35,140
but the woman from Tron?

3145
02:40:35,140 --> 02:40:37,140
Olivia Wilde?

3146
02:40:37,140 --> 02:40:39,140
No, the original Tron.

3147
02:40:39,140 --> 02:40:42,140
Oh, Wendy, they did the music, right?

3148
02:40:42,140 --> 02:40:46,140
No, the woman who played the love interest.

3149
02:40:46,140 --> 02:40:48,140
Oh!

3150
02:40:48,140 --> 02:40:51,140
I think it's the only thing she's ever done that anybody remembers.

3151
02:40:51,140 --> 02:40:53,140
Because there was a movement to bring her back for the new movie,

3152
02:40:53,140 --> 02:40:55,140
it didn't work.

3153
02:40:55,140 --> 02:40:59,140
Yeah, but that's where I met Sid Meier,

3154
02:40:59,140 --> 02:41:01,140
showed up there, and in Philly Classic 5,

3155
02:41:01,140 --> 02:41:04,140
they had Howard Scott Warshaw, who made E.T. and all that stuff.

3156
02:41:04,140 --> 02:41:07,140
But it was a lot of fun, and I exposed a lot of people to that.

3157
02:41:07,140 --> 02:41:11,140
And then I also would run Guitar Man and Rez, as well.

3158
02:41:11,140 --> 02:41:14,140
So it was a whole music game, my area was like the music game area.

3159
02:41:14,140 --> 02:41:18,140
It looked like a lot of fun, even though music games that you were bringing

3160
02:41:18,140 --> 02:41:21,140
maybe weren't quote-unquote classic games,

3161
02:41:21,140 --> 02:41:25,140
still, I like the instant classic touch on it, it was still a convention.

3162
02:41:25,140 --> 02:41:28,140
Music games show up at every convention, deal with it.

3163
02:41:28,140 --> 02:41:31,140
Other people had the DDR stuff, I'm like,

3164
02:41:31,140 --> 02:41:33,140
I don't do the DDR, I'm doing all the other stuff.

3165
02:41:33,140 --> 02:41:35,140
There you go, trying to bring the other stuff to life.

3166
02:41:35,140 --> 02:41:38,140
If you like DDR, then you might like...

3167
02:41:39,140 --> 02:41:42,140
Why, I mean, it's not running anymore, though, right?

3168
02:41:42,140 --> 02:41:45,140
It folded, I'm sure business reasons or whatever.

3169
02:41:45,140 --> 02:41:48,140
They wanted to, we had big plans for Philly Classic 6,

3170
02:41:48,140 --> 02:41:52,140
but unfortunately, the people that were up in Philadelphia that ran it,

3171
02:41:52,140 --> 02:41:54,140
there was a little bit of drama.

3172
02:41:54,140 --> 02:41:57,140
Essentially, the short version that I kind of remember

3173
02:41:57,140 --> 02:42:00,140
is that they had kind of passed the keys on to another guy

3174
02:42:00,140 --> 02:42:03,140
who completely changed the show,

3175
02:42:03,140 --> 02:42:07,140
and he changed it to something else, and it folded after two or three years.

3176
02:42:07,140 --> 02:42:09,140
So they had trusted somebody else with it,

3177
02:42:09,140 --> 02:42:12,140
and he's like, yeah, the classic games are kind of cool and stuff,

3178
02:42:12,140 --> 02:42:15,140
but we're going to expand.

3179
02:42:15,140 --> 02:42:20,140
And he thought, really, really big, and then it petered out.

3180
02:42:22,140 --> 02:42:26,140
That sucks. You should definitely check out some day.

3181
02:42:26,140 --> 02:42:28,140
I know it involves traveling to California,

3182
02:42:28,140 --> 02:42:31,140
but California Extreme is an awesome classic game show

3183
02:42:31,140 --> 02:42:33,140
with all the old-school arcade machines and stuff.

3184
02:42:33,140 --> 02:42:35,140
That's the kind of thing I think of.

3185
02:42:35,140 --> 02:42:37,140
It's really, really lots of fun.

3186
02:42:39,140 --> 02:42:42,140
There was one of the local arcade distributors

3187
02:42:42,140 --> 02:42:46,140
that still worked in arcades with a lot of the classic systems.

3188
02:42:46,140 --> 02:42:48,140
They were on the East Coast somewhere,

3189
02:42:48,140 --> 02:42:53,140
but they brought 50 arcade machines all set to free play to this show.

3190
02:42:53,140 --> 02:42:57,140
Basically, what we did is, leading up to my little rhythm game thing,

3191
02:42:57,140 --> 02:43:00,140
they had the gaming experience through time.

3192
02:43:00,140 --> 02:43:02,140
You could go up and go to these consoles,

3193
02:43:02,140 --> 02:43:07,140
and they started at the Magnavox Odyssey and then an Atari 2600,

3194
02:43:07,140 --> 02:43:10,140
all going up to Xbox, PlayStation 2 and stuff.

3195
02:43:10,140 --> 02:43:16,140
So you could actually go down the line and see the next console in time.

3196
02:43:16,140 --> 02:43:18,140
It's like an interactive timeline.

3197
02:43:18,140 --> 02:43:19,140
Yeah.

3198
02:43:19,140 --> 02:43:20,140
Awesome.

3199
02:43:20,140 --> 02:43:22,140
We did stuff like that, and it was a lot of fun.

3200
02:43:22,140 --> 02:43:26,140
Many folks in chat saying, we should have a vogcon.

3201
02:43:26,140 --> 02:43:28,140
We could have a vogcon some day.

3202
02:43:28,140 --> 02:43:30,140
It's not outside the realm of possibility.

3203
02:43:30,140 --> 02:43:32,140
And then Brad from Pod Culture,

3204
02:43:32,140 --> 02:43:35,140
why don't you have vogcon in Atlanta the day before Dragon Con?

3205
02:43:35,140 --> 02:43:38,140
Yeah, because why don't we just have it at Dragon Con?

3206
02:43:38,140 --> 02:43:40,140
Probably the smartest idea.

3207
02:43:40,140 --> 02:43:44,140
I think certainly there should be, whether it's official or unofficial,

3208
02:43:44,140 --> 02:43:48,140
a vog event at Dragon Con is certainly within the realm of possibility for this year.

3209
02:43:48,140 --> 02:43:51,140
Well, I've said we're going to have an official event.

3210
02:43:51,140 --> 02:43:54,140
That's pretty much been confirmed to me.

3211
02:43:54,140 --> 02:43:57,140
Obviously, I won't know for certain until next month.

3212
02:43:57,140 --> 02:43:58,140
Right.

3213
02:43:58,140 --> 02:44:04,140
No, we've already got an official panel, which means we'll be in the program and all that stuff.

3214
02:44:04,140 --> 02:44:10,140
But then other events, there's a huge gaming area, tabletop gaming area downstairs,

3215
02:44:10,140 --> 02:44:14,140
and we could easily commandeer a corner of that one night.

3216
02:44:14,140 --> 02:44:15,140
Awesome.

3217
02:44:15,140 --> 02:44:16,140
For just us.

3218
02:44:16,140 --> 02:44:19,140
So it sounds like if you want to meet as many vog people as possible,

3219
02:44:19,140 --> 02:44:21,140
Atlanta's going to be the place to be Labor Day weekend.

3220
02:44:21,140 --> 02:44:22,140
That's right.

3221
02:44:22,140 --> 02:44:23,140
There you go.

3222
02:44:23,140 --> 02:44:24,140
You should do it.

3223
02:44:24,140 --> 02:44:26,140
I won't be as depressed about sportsball.

3224
02:44:26,140 --> 02:44:27,140
What's that?

3225
02:44:27,140 --> 02:44:29,140
I won't be as depressed about sportsball.

3226
02:44:29,140 --> 02:44:30,140
Yes, it'll all be over by then.

3227
02:44:30,140 --> 02:44:33,140
If the Niners lose in a couple weeks, we'll make you feel better?

3228
02:44:33,140 --> 02:44:37,140
No, see, I want them to win now because that means we lost to the champions.

3229
02:44:37,140 --> 02:44:39,140
Ah, that's a good way of thinking about it.

3230
02:44:39,140 --> 02:44:42,140
And here's the thing that made it worse, the sportsball thing worse,

3231
02:44:42,140 --> 02:44:46,140
is because of the whole video game industry tie-in on my Twitter.

3232
02:44:46,140 --> 02:44:51,140
The majority of the video game industry, especially the PR contacts, guess where they live?

3233
02:44:51,140 --> 02:44:54,140
Of course, the Bay Area. I know that, yes.

3234
02:44:54,140 --> 02:44:58,140
So I did not check my personal Twitter all day. I just could not take it.

3235
02:44:58,140 --> 02:44:59,140
Couldn't handle it.

3236
02:44:59,140 --> 02:45:03,140
Actually, I think the saddest picture you posted was the confetti cannon behind you guys,

3237
02:45:03,140 --> 02:45:05,140
and you just put unused.

3238
02:45:05,140 --> 02:45:07,140
Yes, it was right there.

3239
02:45:07,140 --> 02:45:11,140
I actually took another picture of just my drum next to it and everybody else had left.

3240
02:45:11,140 --> 02:45:14,140
It was just my drum next to the confetti cannon, but yeah.

3241
02:45:17,140 --> 02:45:20,140
I'm sorry. Hey, there's always next year.

3242
02:45:20,140 --> 02:45:21,140
There is.

3243
02:45:21,140 --> 02:45:27,140
Well, Bobby, focus on the positive. Lots of good things coming with VOG and all that in the future.

3244
02:45:27,140 --> 02:45:31,140
You did not have a show this week, sadly, but tell the folks where they can catch you next week.

3245
02:45:31,140 --> 02:45:38,140
Right here on VOG. I'm the opening act, and I will be live next week.

3246
02:45:38,140 --> 02:45:41,140
I will not be live the following week because of sportsball.

3247
02:45:41,140 --> 02:45:46,140
And that was the other bad, because I go to a party because it's time I see a lot of my friends,

3248
02:45:46,140 --> 02:45:49,140
and so I never do a show on the big super sportsball day.

3249
02:45:49,140 --> 02:45:50,140
Right.

3250
02:45:50,140 --> 02:45:54,140
The first couple messages I got from my friends, instead of saying,

3251
02:45:54,140 --> 02:45:59,140
oh man, sorry, and all that stuff, and yeah, it was a closed game, blah, blah, blah.

3252
02:45:59,140 --> 02:46:04,140
No, they were like, yes, this means you're coming to our Super Bowl party and bringing your pizza dip.

3253
02:46:04,140 --> 02:46:05,140
And I was like, guys.

3254
02:46:05,140 --> 02:46:09,140
Would you have actually had to fly to wherever they were having the Super Bowl this year?

3255
02:46:09,140 --> 02:46:12,140
The plan was we were going to go to New Orleans.

3256
02:46:12,140 --> 02:46:17,140
Even if we couldn't get into the game, we were going to do events, corporate events around New Orleans,

3257
02:46:17,140 --> 02:46:19,140
maybe playing some of the bars.

3258
02:46:19,140 --> 02:46:24,140
We'd march the tailgates outside of the Superdome, and then we'd go to a bar and watch the game at a bar.

3259
02:46:24,140 --> 02:46:28,140
Tell me more about this pizza dip.

3260
02:46:28,140 --> 02:46:31,140
It's a trade secret.

3261
02:46:31,140 --> 02:46:36,140
Maybe Loki will have a reason to come to Atlanta if the wife will let him.

3262
02:46:36,140 --> 02:46:42,140
All right, so visit our co-headliner, Bobby Blackwell, Sunday nights at the Voice of the Geeks Network, 5 o'clock.

3263
02:46:42,140 --> 02:46:47,140
We may actually end up being off on that Sunday too, the Super Sunday as well.

3264
02:46:47,140 --> 02:46:50,140
It's our lowest rated night of the year for obvious reasons.

3265
02:46:50,140 --> 02:46:56,140
And I also was given a tip that it is the best day to go to a theme park near here.

3266
02:46:56,140 --> 02:46:59,140
Not Disneyland, but one of the other ones, Magic Mountain.

3267
02:46:59,140 --> 02:47:01,140
So I may go to Magic Mountain.

3268
02:47:01,140 --> 02:47:02,140
All right.

3269
02:47:02,140 --> 02:47:03,140
We'll see.

3270
02:47:03,140 --> 02:47:04,140
So, yep.

3271
02:47:04,140 --> 02:47:05,140
And so thank you.

3272
02:47:05,140 --> 02:47:06,140
You guys cheered me up.

3273
02:47:06,140 --> 02:47:07,140
Thank you, guys.

3274
02:47:07,140 --> 02:47:08,140
Oh, thank you.

3275
02:47:08,140 --> 02:47:09,140
I'm glad we could.

3276
02:47:09,140 --> 02:47:13,140
And I'm glad we get to have you at the end of our show because you're always kind enough to have us on every week.

3277
02:47:13,140 --> 02:47:16,140
I also cheered you up by beating all your scores on For the Horizon.

3278
02:47:16,140 --> 02:47:17,140
Stop it.

3279
02:47:17,140 --> 02:47:18,140
All right.

3280
02:47:18,140 --> 02:47:19,140
Go kick his ass.

3281
02:47:19,140 --> 02:47:21,140
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

3282
02:47:21,140 --> 02:47:23,140
Making hearts in your direction.

3283
02:47:23,140 --> 02:47:24,140
Oh, thank you.

3284
02:47:24,140 --> 02:47:28,140
Because I feel bad for your team.

3285
02:47:28,140 --> 02:47:29,140
Oh, my God.

3286
02:47:29,140 --> 02:47:32,140
You got dark Sakura kind of to care about football.

3287
02:47:32,140 --> 02:47:34,140
That should make you feel better than anything else.

3288
02:47:34,140 --> 02:47:37,140
And see, I would have gotten a ring.

3289
02:47:37,140 --> 02:47:41,140
If we had gone in two weeks and one, I would have gotten a ring.

3290
02:47:41,140 --> 02:47:43,140
Well, you know what?

3291
02:47:43,140 --> 02:47:45,140
There's always next year?

3292
02:47:45,140 --> 02:47:48,140
At Dragon Con, I'll get you some onion rings.

3293
02:47:48,140 --> 02:47:49,140
How's that sound?

3294
02:47:49,140 --> 02:47:51,140
From the varsity.

3295
02:47:51,140 --> 02:47:56,140
They should understand that they should launch the puppy out of the cannon for a puppy bowl.

3296
02:47:56,140 --> 02:47:57,140
No.

3297
02:47:57,140 --> 02:47:58,140
Half time.

3298
02:47:58,140 --> 02:47:59,140
I'm letting you go, Bobby.

3299
02:47:59,140 --> 02:48:00,140
Take care.

3300
02:48:00,140 --> 02:48:01,140
All right.

3301
02:48:01,140 --> 02:48:02,140
Maybe a ferret instead.

3302
02:48:02,140 --> 02:48:05,140
One eight seven seven game.

3303
02:48:05,140 --> 02:48:07,140
All our user name on Skype is orange launch radio.

3304
02:48:07,140 --> 02:48:10,140
Bobby was a little bit longer than we usually have the calls, but he's Bobby.

3305
02:48:10,140 --> 02:48:12,140
He can do that.

3306
02:48:12,140 --> 02:48:13,140
Anyhow.

3307
02:48:13,140 --> 02:48:15,140
Also, we got Twitter topics coming in.

3308
02:48:15,140 --> 02:48:17,140
Twitter dot com slash O L R.

3309
02:48:17,140 --> 02:48:20,140
And we can read some of those topics here.

3310
02:48:23,140 --> 02:48:24,140
Let's see.

3311
02:48:24,140 --> 02:48:25,140
Oh, no.

3312
02:48:25,140 --> 02:48:26,140
We got more calls coming in.

3313
02:48:26,140 --> 02:48:27,140
Never mind.

3314
02:48:27,140 --> 02:48:28,140
Let's take the calls instead.

3315
02:48:28,140 --> 02:48:29,140
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

3316
02:48:29,140 --> 02:48:30,140
Who's this?

3317
02:48:32,140 --> 02:48:33,140
Hello.

3318
02:48:33,140 --> 02:48:34,140
It's Code Man.

3319
02:48:34,140 --> 02:48:36,140
Down for maintenance podcast.

3320
02:48:36,140 --> 02:48:37,140
How you doing?

3321
02:48:37,140 --> 02:48:38,140
Code Man from Down for maintenance podcast.

3322
02:48:38,140 --> 02:48:40,140
How you guys doing?

3323
02:48:40,140 --> 02:48:41,140
You know.

3324
02:48:41,140 --> 02:48:42,140
All right.

3325
02:48:42,140 --> 02:48:43,140
Great football news today.

3326
02:48:43,140 --> 02:48:45,140
But, you know, I like your picture.

3327
02:48:45,140 --> 02:48:46,140
It's very army.

3328
02:48:46,140 --> 02:48:48,140
Yeah, that's my tattoo.

3329
02:48:48,140 --> 02:48:50,140
What does your tattoo say?

3330
02:48:50,140 --> 02:48:54,140
I know you didn't call in to talk about that, but I'm asking anyway.

3331
02:48:54,140 --> 02:48:56,140
Whatever our souls are made of.

3332
02:48:56,140 --> 02:48:57,140
Hers and mine are the same.

3333
02:48:57,140 --> 02:49:00,140
It's for me and my wife.

3334
02:49:00,140 --> 02:49:01,140
Adorable.

3335
02:49:01,140 --> 02:49:02,140
Oh, wow.

3336
02:49:02,140 --> 02:49:03,140
Jeez.

3337
02:49:03,140 --> 02:49:07,140
Well, after the Bobby call and then now this little aw, I kind of feel down.

3338
02:49:07,140 --> 02:49:08,140
But that was good.

3339
02:49:08,140 --> 02:49:09,140
Thank you.

3340
02:49:09,140 --> 02:49:10,140
I appreciate that.

3341
02:49:10,140 --> 02:49:11,140
Well, we cheered Bobby up.

3342
02:49:11,140 --> 02:49:13,140
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

3343
02:49:13,140 --> 02:49:18,140
Well, you know, that call, it kind of made me think of, you know, I live in Oklahoma.

3344
02:49:18,140 --> 02:49:26,140
Our team, our sports ball team, our college team didn't do very well this year either.

3345
02:49:26,140 --> 02:49:30,140
But we usually do, you know, pretty well.

3346
02:49:30,140 --> 02:49:35,140
We just didn't show up to any of the games mentally, I guess you would say.

3347
02:49:35,140 --> 02:49:36,140
Look on the bright side.

3348
02:49:36,140 --> 02:49:39,140
Your college team, at least their girlfriends are real.

3349
02:49:39,140 --> 02:49:40,140
True.

3350
02:49:40,140 --> 02:49:41,140
There you go.

3351
02:49:41,140 --> 02:49:42,140
Right.

3352
02:49:42,140 --> 02:49:43,140
Yeah.

3353
02:49:43,140 --> 02:49:46,140
No, I just wanted to call and say hi to you guys.

3354
02:49:46,140 --> 02:49:51,140
And, you know, I this is actually I'm actually getting a chance to call you guys.

3355
02:49:51,140 --> 02:49:55,140
The baby is asleep and I'm actually getting a chance to call in.

3356
02:49:55,140 --> 02:49:57,140
So I'm excited about that.

3357
02:49:57,140 --> 02:50:01,140
Well, I'll bring this up because I'm looking through the Twitter topics for tonight.

3358
02:50:01,140 --> 02:50:03,140
And I noticed you sent us a tweet.

3359
02:50:03,140 --> 02:50:07,140
And after show this to people in studio, you tweeted me with a power glove.

3360
02:50:07,140 --> 02:50:09,140
Ah, it's so bad.

3361
02:50:09,140 --> 02:50:11,140
You actually tweeted us a picture of yourself.

3362
02:50:11,140 --> 02:50:15,140
I'm showing the others in studio there a picture of you holding the power glove.

3363
02:50:15,140 --> 02:50:17,140
And I like this little artsy pose you're doing with it, too.

3364
02:50:17,140 --> 02:50:21,140
It's very like I really like your scarf.

3365
02:50:21,140 --> 02:50:22,140
Yeah.

3366
02:50:22,140 --> 02:50:23,140
Thank you.

3367
02:50:23,140 --> 02:50:24,140
You got a scarf.

3368
02:50:24,140 --> 02:50:27,140
It's very hipster, but not in a douchebag way.

3369
02:50:27,140 --> 02:50:28,140
I like it.

3370
02:50:28,140 --> 02:50:32,140
Well, that was actually that was a very that was a very drunken night.

3371
02:50:32,140 --> 02:50:36,140
I don't like to talk about it, but oh, I see.

3372
02:50:36,140 --> 02:50:38,140
No, I was over at a friend's house and he had a power glove.

3373
02:50:38,140 --> 02:50:42,140
He just had it up on display because I think that's pretty much all you can really do with it.

3374
02:50:42,140 --> 02:50:46,140
And we took it down and started taking a whole bunch of pictures.

3375
02:50:46,140 --> 02:50:50,140
And I actually took a picture punching him in the face with it, too.

3376
02:50:50,140 --> 02:50:52,140
So that was that was pretty funny.

3377
02:50:52,140 --> 02:50:54,140
Well, they call it a power glove for a reason.

3378
02:50:54,140 --> 02:50:56,140
So obviously, yeah.

3379
02:50:56,140 --> 02:50:58,140
No, I I listen to you guys show.

3380
02:50:58,140 --> 02:51:07,140
And I I just oh, just, you know, like like John on on our podcast, he's from he's from California as well.

3381
02:51:07,140 --> 02:51:14,140
And it just makes me just so sad at all the stuff that you guys can do in California and I can't do here in Oklahoma.

3382
02:51:14,140 --> 02:51:16,140
And it makes me it just makes me sad.

3383
02:51:16,140 --> 02:51:18,140
Well, however, you have Waffle House, right?

3384
02:51:18,140 --> 02:51:25,140
We do have Waffle House, although you don't really want to go in there most of the time because some of the plates are a little a little dirty.

3385
02:51:25,140 --> 02:51:29,140
But you have Waffle House and you should be glad for that fact because we don't have Waffle House and we never will.

3386
02:51:29,140 --> 02:51:36,140
And I was going to say Oklahoma at least has Dunkin Donuts and we're not getting those until apparently 2015 is announced this week.

3387
02:51:36,140 --> 02:51:38,140
But at least we're finally going to get them in SoCal.

3388
02:51:38,140 --> 02:51:40,140
I miss Waffle House, Rob.

3389
02:51:40,140 --> 02:51:41,140
Wow.

3390
02:51:41,140 --> 02:51:42,140
Good.

3391
02:51:42,140 --> 02:51:43,140
I want no. Yes, it is.

3392
02:51:43,140 --> 02:51:45,140
I want my chocolate chip pancakes extra crispy.

3393
02:51:45,140 --> 02:51:46,140
Thank you.

3394
02:51:46,140 --> 02:51:48,140
Those are good. Those are very good.

3395
02:51:48,140 --> 02:51:50,140
What are you allowing the fact that we don't have Dunkin Donuts here?

3396
02:51:50,140 --> 02:51:51,140
Yeah.

3397
02:51:51,140 --> 02:51:53,140
I figured you probably would.

3398
02:51:53,140 --> 02:51:54,140
No, no.

3399
02:51:54,140 --> 02:52:00,140
It's the it is like the number one thing when I tell people on the East Coast, like, you know, because I'll go out to visit.

3400
02:52:00,140 --> 02:52:02,140
I'll go to New York or even when I was at PAX.

3401
02:52:02,140 --> 02:52:03,140
I'm like, fuck, yes.

3402
02:52:03,140 --> 02:52:04,140
We've got to go to Dunkin Donuts.

3403
02:52:04,140 --> 02:52:06,140
Oh, my God. I haven't had Dunkin Donuts in forever. We got to go.

3404
02:52:06,140 --> 02:52:08,140
And like my friends are like, the fuck?

3405
02:52:08,140 --> 02:52:10,140
Like, really? I'm like, no, you don't understand.

3406
02:52:10,140 --> 02:52:11,140
I live in California.

3407
02:52:11,140 --> 02:52:12,140
I don't have Dunkin Donuts.

3408
02:52:12,140 --> 02:52:14,140
And they're like, where the fuck do you get donuts?

3409
02:52:14,140 --> 02:52:17,140
I made tiara drive me to Dunkin Donuts in Las Vegas.

3410
02:52:17,140 --> 02:52:18,140
Yeah. I mean, they don't.

3411
02:52:18,140 --> 02:52:22,140
It's it's Mon Pop stores or if you can find a Krispy Kreme that didn't go under.

3412
02:52:22,140 --> 02:52:23,140
That's it.

3413
02:52:23,140 --> 02:52:24,140
Wow.

3414
02:52:24,140 --> 02:52:25,140
Krispy Kreme.

3415
02:52:25,140 --> 02:52:26,140
Krispy Kreme.

3416
02:52:26,140 --> 02:52:29,140
Yeah. Krispy Kreme is few and far between in Oklahoma.

3417
02:52:29,140 --> 02:52:32,140
There's a couple of them around where I live.

3418
02:52:32,140 --> 02:52:35,140
But yeah, they're they're pretty hard to find.

3419
02:52:35,140 --> 02:52:38,140
Krispy Kreme in Alabama is like Starbucks.

3420
02:52:38,140 --> 02:52:43,140
Yeah, that's what we have here. Starbucks everywhere.

3421
02:52:43,140 --> 02:52:44,140
Krispy Kreme.

3422
02:52:44,140 --> 02:52:46,140
Well, trying to bring it back to video games a little bit.

3423
02:52:46,140 --> 02:52:50,140
I know you have been playing a little more Forza Horizon lately as well.

3424
02:52:50,140 --> 02:52:52,140
I know that's something you were talking about on Down for Maintenance.

3425
02:52:52,140 --> 02:52:54,140
So what are your thoughts on Forza?

3426
02:52:54,140 --> 02:52:55,140
I love it.

3427
02:52:55,140 --> 02:52:58,140
And I'll tell you the reason why I love it.

3428
02:52:58,140 --> 02:53:00,140
And I've mentioned this on my podcast.

3429
02:53:00,140 --> 02:53:04,140
I said, you know, I I think the last.

3430
02:53:04,140 --> 02:53:06,140
Oh, my dryer just went off.

3431
02:53:06,140 --> 02:53:15,140
The last the last racing game I played was like Cruising USA and like Bowling Alley arcade.

3432
02:53:15,140 --> 02:53:20,140
And so and so it brings I don't know, it kind of brings me back to that kind of racing.

3433
02:53:20,140 --> 02:53:22,140
It's very arcadey. And I like that about it.

3434
02:53:22,140 --> 02:53:31,140
And and the fact that you can you can race against people in your car club and then and then you can have your car club race against other people.

3435
02:53:31,140 --> 02:53:33,140
And I think that's a really, really neat concept.

3436
02:53:33,140 --> 02:53:35,140
Of course, they could have had that before.

3437
02:53:35,140 --> 02:53:40,140
And I just never discovered racing games on, you know, these kinds of consoles.

3438
02:53:40,140 --> 02:53:42,140
But I don't know. It's a really fun game.

3439
02:53:42,140 --> 02:53:48,140
Although I really, really want to race somebody in the car club and I haven't raced them yet.

3440
02:53:48,140 --> 02:53:51,140
Well, we're going to try to set a date and time for either this week or next.

3441
02:53:51,140 --> 02:53:55,140
We'll we'll tweet about it. We need everybody possible to come join in on the fun.

3442
02:53:55,140 --> 02:53:59,140
So look out for that, including Loki. Yes.

3443
02:53:59,140 --> 02:54:03,140
Well, Loki, he's all over it. He's been on that thing like white on rice, man.

3444
02:54:03,140 --> 02:54:06,140
It's crazy. Absolutely. Absolutely.

3445
02:54:06,140 --> 02:54:08,140
I kind of took a break to make more details.

3446
02:54:08,140 --> 02:54:12,140
In fact, I'm making a spoiler, a sticker for the back of my car.

3447
02:54:12,140 --> 02:54:16,140
The back of my car is this. How are you? How am I driving? One eight seven seven game.

3448
02:54:18,140 --> 02:54:21,140
It's advertisement. Yeah, it's all over the car.

3449
02:54:21,140 --> 02:54:24,140
You are so dumb, but I love it. All right.

3450
02:54:24,140 --> 02:54:30,140
Code man, tell the folks how they can tune into your podcast, which you you do Google Hangouts and stuff now, too.

3451
02:54:30,140 --> 02:54:32,140
Right. You guys. Yeah. You're playing with your format.

3452
02:54:32,140 --> 02:54:35,140
Are you going to you're going to switch to video or what?

3453
02:54:35,140 --> 02:54:38,140
We kind of do it back and forth every once in a while.

3454
02:54:38,140 --> 02:54:41,140
We just kind of dabble in audio and video.

3455
02:54:41,140 --> 02:54:47,140
But yeah, you can find us on YouTube at YouTube dot com backslash the DFM podcast.

3456
02:54:47,140 --> 02:54:50,140
And you can follow us on Twitter at the DFM podcast.

3457
02:54:50,140 --> 02:54:55,140
Then, of course, you can find us on iTunes at the DFM.

3458
02:54:55,140 --> 02:55:00,140
Just look search for the DFM or the down for maintenance podcast.

3459
02:55:00,140 --> 02:55:02,140
And yeah, we should be on there.

3460
02:55:02,140 --> 02:55:08,140
We're we're on our eighth episode, actually, the next episode, which you dark soccer are going to guest on.

3461
02:55:08,140 --> 02:55:12,140
Yes. If you if you remember, I haven't sent you a reminder.

3462
02:55:12,140 --> 02:55:17,140
So I don't know. I put it on my phone. So I've got everything.

3463
02:55:17,140 --> 02:55:20,140
I have an alarm going off. That's what you've got to be is in the phone.

3464
02:55:20,140 --> 02:55:26,140
I've made new plans that kind of stat because, you know, I wanted to get all three of you guys on all at once.

3465
02:55:26,140 --> 02:55:33,140
But I you know, I knew that, you know, with with all kinds of different, you know, time schedules and stuff like that, I probably couldn't manage that.

3466
02:55:33,140 --> 02:55:37,140
So, you know, we will have all three of you on now. So that's awesome.

3467
02:55:37,140 --> 02:55:42,140
Well, thank you very much for having us on and expertly plugged. Appreciate it. Best of luck with your show.

3468
02:55:42,140 --> 02:55:48,140
Thank you very much, Rob. Tell the guys over there. I said hi at your next show. We will. All right. Take care, buddy.

3469
02:55:48,140 --> 02:55:50,140
See ya. See ya.

3470
02:55:50,140 --> 02:55:53,140
Whoa. We can squeeze in one more call. One eight seven seven game.

3471
02:55:53,140 --> 02:55:56,140
O.L.R. or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio. All one word.

3472
02:55:56,140 --> 02:56:00,140
Going to some more Twitter topics. SGA 100 Max sending us a couple tweets.

3473
02:56:00,140 --> 02:56:05,140
A pinball arcade museum in L.A. that is run by just one woman.

3474
02:56:05,140 --> 02:56:10,140
How have I not heard of this place? It's in L.A. I could go there on my way to Disneyland someday.

3475
02:56:10,140 --> 02:56:15,140
I'm trying to bring up the link right now. It is on a place called Arcade Heroes.

3476
02:56:15,140 --> 02:56:19,140
Let's see. It is in the L.A. area. It's called Pins and Needles.

3477
02:56:19,140 --> 02:56:24,140
I love it. This place looks awesome. I'm going to do more research on that.

3478
02:56:24,140 --> 02:56:29,140
You can check that out at arcadeheroes.com. That's the link that SSJ100 Matt just sent us.

3479
02:56:29,140 --> 02:56:33,140
That would be a great name for a store that sells jukeboxes and pinball machines.

3480
02:56:33,140 --> 02:56:37,140
Yeah. Let's see. Something he saw at Magfest.

3481
02:56:37,140 --> 02:56:42,140
An original Atari 2600 game with the classic cartridge box and manual.

3482
02:56:42,140 --> 02:56:48,140
CGE Adventures. It is amazing how people are still making stuff for the Atari 2600 even today.

3483
02:56:48,140 --> 02:56:55,140
You can get all kinds of repros of stuff that were prototypes. Repro prototypes.

3484
02:56:55,140 --> 02:56:57,140
That's how we have a millipede for 5200.

3485
02:56:57,140 --> 02:57:06,140
Even some of those flashback consoles had some of the design challenge winners.

3486
02:57:07,140 --> 02:57:14,140
Funny enough, I remember Bobby earlier was talking about Howard Scott Warshaw at the Expo in Philly.

3487
02:57:14,140 --> 02:57:19,140
Saboteur, his last game, I think, was one of those games that showed up in a flashback console at some point.

3488
02:57:19,140 --> 02:57:24,140
It's kind of interesting. You do still see those show up in one place or another.

3489
02:57:24,140 --> 02:57:28,140
Again, 1877 Game O.L.R. or a username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.

3490
02:57:28,140 --> 02:57:35,140
Tiger Koa sending us some tweets. More League of Legends players banned for toxic behavior.

3491
02:57:35,140 --> 02:57:40,140
Apparently League of Legends is not going to put up with that shit anymore where people are harassing other people.

3492
02:57:40,140 --> 02:57:46,140
Banned two prominent esports players for their toxic behavior in game.

3493
02:57:46,140 --> 02:57:54,140
The peak harassment score placed the account among the worst .06 of all European accounts this month.

3494
02:57:54,140 --> 02:57:57,140
That was InVision's account. He was banned.

3495
02:57:57,140 --> 02:58:00,140
You know what? Good for them.

3496
02:58:00,140 --> 02:58:03,140
Be accountable for your attitude in games.

3497
02:58:03,140 --> 02:58:07,140
People want to be so anonymous. I've been doing a lot of PVP and WoW this week.

3498
02:58:07,140 --> 02:58:10,140
I'll talk about this on Hoard House. Plug plug later.

3499
02:58:10,140 --> 02:58:14,140
Just some toxic fucking attitudes in these games that ruin it for everybody.

3500
02:58:14,140 --> 02:58:20,140
I'm really glad to hear that League of Legends has taken some drastic moves to eliminate that shit.

3501
02:58:22,140 --> 02:58:25,140
Also a tweet from Tiger Koa saying,

3502
02:58:25,140 --> 02:58:29,140
Games destigmatize violence, says a Connecticut governor.

3503
02:58:29,140 --> 02:58:31,140
Well, that's probably all that needs to be said about that.

3504
02:58:31,140 --> 02:58:34,140
Another politician putting their big ass foot in the conversation.

3505
02:58:36,140 --> 02:58:39,140
Lastly here, Raw Steel UT.

3506
02:58:39,140 --> 02:58:44,140
In light of how the media readily brought Manti Teo's dead girlfriend story,

3507
02:58:44,140 --> 02:58:47,140
have any of you been fooled by fake stories?

3508
02:58:47,140 --> 02:58:49,140
Oh, I'm sure we have here on OLR.

3509
02:58:49,140 --> 02:58:53,140
I mean, it happens. There'll be an article that spreads like wildfire.

3510
02:58:53,140 --> 02:58:56,140
We don't like to think we're breaking the news.

3511
02:58:56,140 --> 02:59:00,140
Once in a while we get a little tip, but we try not to make a big deal out of it.

3512
02:59:00,140 --> 02:59:03,140
Sometimes we talk about a game called Disney Infinity.

3513
02:59:03,140 --> 02:59:07,140
It's a hidden secret for our listeners, and that's the way we want it to be.

3514
02:59:07,140 --> 02:59:13,140
We learned the hard way many years ago that sometimes you don't necessarily want things to blow up out of proportion.

3515
02:59:13,140 --> 02:59:16,140
You don't have to be the guy that gets credited for breaking the news.

3516
02:59:16,140 --> 02:59:18,140
No one remembers it anyway.

3517
02:59:18,140 --> 02:59:20,140
Exactly. No one remembers it in this day and age anyway.

3518
02:59:20,140 --> 02:59:24,140
But yes, I'm sure in the history of this show we've been fooled by fake stories.

3519
02:59:24,140 --> 02:59:26,140
Unfortunately, none are coming to mind.

3520
02:59:28,140 --> 02:59:35,140
Hey, I'm sure back in the day when we were all younger, I'm sure some of us fell for the old EGM magazine pranks

3521
02:59:35,140 --> 02:59:38,140
like that Shang Long was actually a character in Street Fighter.

3522
02:59:38,140 --> 02:59:39,140
Nope.

3523
02:59:39,140 --> 02:59:40,140
Or Ermac was actually in Mortal Kombat.

3524
02:59:40,140 --> 02:59:41,140
No.

3525
02:59:41,140 --> 02:59:42,140
Oh, sure. Say that now.

3526
02:59:42,140 --> 02:59:47,140
Well, I also worked in an arcade for a while too and could actually check some of these machines myself.

3527
02:59:47,140 --> 02:59:52,140
So you knew at that age how to go into the chips and actually look in the programming?

3528
02:59:52,140 --> 02:59:53,140
Yep, I totally knew that.

3529
02:59:53,140 --> 02:59:58,140
No, Rob, what I knew is that usually on April 1st there are going to be pranks done.

3530
02:59:58,140 --> 03:00:00,140
I don't believe a damn thing on April 1st.

3531
03:00:00,140 --> 03:00:01,140
But they were in magazines.

3532
03:00:01,140 --> 03:00:02,140
Or in April Editions.

3533
03:00:02,140 --> 03:00:03,140
And we were younger.

3534
03:00:03,140 --> 03:00:05,140
But they were the April Editions.

3535
03:00:05,140 --> 03:00:07,140
Yeah, but Rob, I'm special.

3536
03:00:07,140 --> 03:00:08,140
You guys are no fun at all.

3537
03:00:08,140 --> 03:00:09,140
I'm special.

3538
03:00:10,140 --> 03:00:14,140
No fun zone, everybody. That's why nobody's calling in. They know it's a no fun zone.

3539
03:00:14,140 --> 03:00:18,140
All right. Last minute stories, Loki. Anything?

3540
03:00:18,140 --> 03:00:25,140
Blockposter UK has closed 160 of its stores because they're in administration right now.

3541
03:00:25,140 --> 03:00:31,140
Kind of a repeat of what they did over here in US.

3542
03:00:31,140 --> 03:00:35,140
There's a pretty cool THQ sale going on right now on Amazon.

3543
03:00:35,140 --> 03:00:39,140
You can get a bunch of games for 25 bucks. 19 games.

3544
03:00:39,140 --> 03:00:45,140
Most of which you probably have by now through the Humble Bundle or all the other Amazon sales that they've done.

3545
03:00:46,140 --> 03:00:47,140
I know I have a lot of these games.

3546
03:00:47,140 --> 03:00:49,140
Actually, I think I have all these games right now.

3547
03:00:49,140 --> 03:00:53,140
Except for Nexuiz. I don't have Nexuiz.

3548
03:00:53,140 --> 03:00:55,140
But I'm not buying this for that.

3549
03:00:55,140 --> 03:00:58,140
MX vs ATV reflex. I don't have that either.

3550
03:01:05,140 --> 03:01:06,140
What else?

3551
03:01:06,140 --> 03:01:09,140
Oh, Starbreeze. I guess they have a new game coming out called Storm.

3552
03:01:09,140 --> 03:01:12,140
I haven't released anything other than that.

3553
03:01:12,140 --> 03:01:15,140
But apparently they have an image teasing it.

3554
03:01:15,140 --> 03:01:17,140
I guess we'll hear more about that during E3.

3555
03:01:17,140 --> 03:01:19,140
Hopefully it's better than Syndicate.

3556
03:01:19,140 --> 03:01:20,140
If not sooner.

3557
03:01:24,140 --> 03:01:25,140
That is it.

3558
03:01:25,140 --> 03:01:26,140
That's it.

3559
03:01:26,140 --> 03:01:32,140
Well, I guess that's going to do it for OLR tonight.

3560
03:01:32,140 --> 03:01:33,140
No more calls coming in.

3561
03:01:33,140 --> 03:01:34,140
That's all right.

3562
03:01:34,140 --> 03:01:38,140
Everybody's too depressed about football. I get it. It's cool.

3563
03:01:38,140 --> 03:01:40,140
Oh, and the killer is dead is pretty awesome looking.

3564
03:01:41,140 --> 03:01:44,140
Which I mentioned about a year ago.

3565
03:01:44,140 --> 03:01:48,140
But it's the new Suda51 game.

3566
03:01:48,140 --> 03:01:52,140
And it kind of has that whole Killer7 vibe to it.

3567
03:01:52,140 --> 03:01:54,140
Where it's all kind of salty and stuff.

3568
03:01:54,140 --> 03:01:55,140
But very bloody.

3569
03:01:55,140 --> 03:01:59,140
I remember with some of the games that they did after Killer7.

3570
03:01:59,140 --> 03:02:00,140
It was kind of toned down.

3571
03:02:00,140 --> 03:02:05,140
They had the whole No More Heroes had money spewing out of them instead of blood.

3572
03:02:05,140 --> 03:02:06,140
Well, this is definitely blood.

3573
03:02:06,140 --> 03:02:09,140
Lots of blood and a guy with a big drill on his arm.

3574
03:02:10,140 --> 03:02:12,140
That sounds like my kind of game.

3575
03:02:12,140 --> 03:02:13,140
He's Mr. Driller now.

3576
03:02:13,140 --> 03:02:15,140
Mr. Driller.

3577
03:02:15,140 --> 03:02:16,140
All right.

3578
03:02:16,140 --> 03:02:18,140
Well, that brings us to a close.

3579
03:02:18,140 --> 03:02:19,140
Another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3580
03:02:19,140 --> 03:02:23,140
But not until we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

3581
03:02:23,140 --> 03:02:27,140
First off, of course, we always like to say thank you for downloading and checking out our show.

3582
03:02:27,140 --> 03:02:29,140
It is a free show.

3583
03:02:29,140 --> 03:02:32,140
We haven't played a commercial for the same game 20 weeks in a row.

3584
03:02:32,140 --> 03:02:36,140
We pay a little bit out of pocket because it's our hobby.

3585
03:02:36,140 --> 03:02:37,140
Whatever.

3586
03:02:37,140 --> 03:02:40,140
And actually, I've got to say, I do want to tip my hat.

3587
03:02:40,140 --> 03:02:43,140
People have been very kind in a pay it forward kind of way.

3588
03:02:43,140 --> 03:02:46,140
We're like, you know, we've just had some nice things donated like Brad from Pod Culture.

3589
03:02:46,140 --> 03:02:49,140
All these mics you see are we're donated.

3590
03:02:49,140 --> 03:02:54,140
And we do get, you know, like Grandpa from Hoard House gave a lot of money to Vogue on our anniversary.

3591
03:02:54,140 --> 03:02:56,140
Helped Kristen years ago.

3592
03:02:56,140 --> 03:02:57,140
It helped out a big way.

3593
03:02:57,140 --> 03:02:58,140
The soundboard.

3594
03:02:58,140 --> 03:03:00,140
That's how we got to PAX.

3595
03:03:00,140 --> 03:03:04,140
So, you know, pay it forward is kind of the motto here.

3596
03:03:04,140 --> 03:03:07,140
Not to, you know, bring up a cheesy movie from years ago.

3597
03:03:07,140 --> 03:03:10,140
But if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, just spread the word.

3598
03:03:10,140 --> 03:03:13,140
Tell a friend or two about the show and help us spread the word about the show.

3599
03:03:13,140 --> 03:03:14,140
And that's all we ask.

3600
03:03:14,140 --> 03:03:16,140
Thank you to everyone who bought me games.

3601
03:03:16,140 --> 03:03:18,140
And thank you to everybody who listened tonight.

3602
03:03:18,140 --> 03:03:20,140
Whether it be live or on the podcast.

3603
03:03:20,140 --> 03:03:22,140
You guys rock.

3604
03:03:22,140 --> 03:03:24,140
Thank you, Greg Proops.

3605
03:03:24,140 --> 03:03:27,140
And I still have steam games to give away at some point.

3606
03:03:27,140 --> 03:03:30,140
Haven't figured out how to do that yet.

3607
03:03:30,140 --> 03:03:32,140
And also, somewhere buried over there.

3608
03:03:32,140 --> 03:03:33,140
I think I see it.

3609
03:03:33,140 --> 03:03:36,140
We still have the Megaran album to give away for something.

3610
03:03:36,140 --> 03:03:38,140
Yeah, we need to just do like a big closeout around here.

3611
03:03:38,140 --> 03:03:41,140
Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

3612
03:03:41,140 --> 03:03:43,140
Jamie, you shut off the iPad.

3613
03:03:43,140 --> 03:03:44,140
You're good to go.

3614
03:03:44,140 --> 03:03:45,140
What's your final thought tonight?

3615
03:03:45,140 --> 03:03:48,140
It's hard to do a show on the iPad.

3616
03:03:48,140 --> 03:03:50,140
Loki, your final thought tonight?

3617
03:03:50,140 --> 03:03:53,140
I have a new CD of music to listen to.

3618
03:03:53,140 --> 03:03:56,140
Thanks for, was it, all the inspiration.

3619
03:03:56,140 --> 03:04:03,140
I guess Dubstep Arena channel on Forza Horizon.

3620
03:04:03,140 --> 03:04:05,140
Although, it's not really, most of it's not really Dubstep.

3621
03:04:05,140 --> 03:04:08,140
It's like just electronica.

3622
03:04:08,140 --> 03:04:12,140
My final thought for the night is why can Horde never win Isle of Conquest?

3623
03:04:12,140 --> 03:04:13,140
Stop being terrible, Horde.

3624
03:04:13,140 --> 03:04:14,140
I hate you.

3625
03:04:14,140 --> 03:04:17,140
Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

3626
03:04:17,140 --> 03:04:19,140
Thank you guys very much for tuning in and supporting the show.

3627
03:04:19,140 --> 03:04:22,140
We'll be back to do it all again next week.

3628
03:04:22,140 --> 03:04:25,140
So, have a wonderful night and a wonderful week.

3629
03:04:25,140 --> 03:04:26,140
Stay safe.

3630
03:04:56,140 --> 03:04:57,140
All still true.

3631
03:04:57,140 --> 03:04:58,140
See you next week.

3632
03:05:25,140 --> 03:05:26,140
Bye.
