00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, January 13th, 2013, a new gaming handheld debuts at CES,

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
PokÃ©mon X and Y is announced, and further details emerge on the Steam Box.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 489,

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
for this January the 13th of 2013.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
I'm sure there's like a numberology thing in there, a numerology thing in there,

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
because all I ever see on the Twitters is like, Happy 1-2-1-2, or Happy 1-3-1-3,

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
and everybody's looking for the number Zs.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
The numbers?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
The number Zs, yes.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
The numbers means we've been doing this too damn long.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
Exactly, exactly. The lovely voice you hear over there is my co-host,

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
say hello to the one and only Jamie Summers!

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
You should see how Rob is gesturing to me as if you could all see this.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Someday there might be a cam, we'll see.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
I will be wearing a shroud.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
I think that I will make the burqa fashion statement.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Lady Gaga might have you beat based on some pictures I saw on the internet.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Lady Gaga, okay?

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
That woman needs to take her Adderall.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Alright, my name, by the way, is Rob Roberts, of course.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
We are joined by all of you in our chat room, live, as we do tape live every Sunday night

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern on Sundays, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
And a big thank you to everybody at the Voice of Geeks Network

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
and all of you listening live in our chat room,

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
live.vognetwork.com for tuning in tonight.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
We'll be talking about games and CES and all that fun stuff here in a little bit,

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
but of course we have to introduce the third host on our program.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Say hello to Tech Master, Loki!

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Hi.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
How are you, Loki?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
I'm fine.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
So, a trip to Disneyland may be in your future,

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
based on what we were talking about before the show.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Well, not that I want to go, but my wife might-

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
How can you not want to go to Disneyland?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
How about she go with me and Dan?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
There you go.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
I'm fine with that.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
No, honestly, I'm seriously fine with that.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I told her that she could go with other people,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
but she wants to go to Disneyland,

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
and personally, I don't want to go to Disneyland

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
just because I don't really-

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
Most of the times I go, I have this anxiety about going on roller coasters,

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
although one time I got over that,

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
and then it came back, so I don't understand it.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
One time, I really loved roller coasters.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
What is with the macho men I know in my life,

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
and their polarizing fear of roller coasters?

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
It's weird. No, it's a weird, irrational thing.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
It's not that I think anything's going to happen.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
It's just my body reacts to it like that,

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
and even stupid shit.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
You know how they have that really crappy ride

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
that's over in California Adventure?

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
It's like the old carnival ride where you're on the swings or whatever.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Oh, I refuse to go on that one.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
The silly symphony swings now.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Yeah, that made me feel really sick to my stomach.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
It's just weird.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
What happens when-

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
It goes in the shock.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
When the wife says, you need to go on California Screamin',

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
what are you afraid is going to happen?

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Do you cry?

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
No, I don't cry.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I don't want to go.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I don't know.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
It's like I can't take the adrenaline rush or something.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
It's really weird.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
I don't know.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
The only thing that gets me on Screamin' is that first hill,

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
and then I'm fine.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
It's Neil Patrick Harris' soothing voice that helps me out every time.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Second thoughts? Too late.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I know that nothing is going to happen to me or anything.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
It's not like I'm afraid that the roller coaster

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
is going to fall off the tracks or something like that.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
I know nothing is going to happen to me.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
I'm perfectly safe in there.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
For some reason, I can't do it.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
There was one time I went.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
One of the last times I went with my family.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
It was kind of like that.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
I was like, I don't want to do this.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
We went on Thunder Mountain Railroad.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I was like, that wasn't so bad.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
We kept going on it over and over and over again.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
It was before it killed the people on there.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
It was actually pretty fun.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Don't talk about that, okay?

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Big Thunder is awesome if you go at night and sit in the back.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
It was pretty fun.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
I thought, okay, cool.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
I was pretty comfortable with it last time.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
This should be no big deal this time.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Went there again.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Last time we went, I was like,

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
why am I afraid of this stuff again?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
I don't understand. This doesn't make any sense.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
It's not that you think you're going to die on the ride.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
It's not even that I feel like I'm going to get sick.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
It's almost like a panic attack.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Like you might lose control of your bladder?

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
No, it's not even that.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
It's like a panic attack almost.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
You get the palpitations.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Does your heart start beating faster?

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
I don't understand.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
I don't go on roller coasters really.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
That's the thing.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
She wants to bring Josh too.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Not even besides the roller coaster stuff,

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
because I'm fine with just sitting out while she goes on roller coasters and that kind of thing

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
and just going on parts of the Caribbean and that kind of crap.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
But I don't want to take Josh on a plane,

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
because that is going to be a pain in the ass.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Why the hell would you fly anyway?

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
You could drive. Yeah, you could drive.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
The drive is easy.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
We're not going to drive because she won't...

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
She has to go to the bathroom all the time.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Well, so do I.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Tam puts up with it.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I'm trying to stop him a million times,

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
but I don't know.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
And then I also have to harass him for coffee.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
I also get that nervous

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
when I'm doing really big things.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
You remember last year,

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
and I never shut up about this,

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
and I'm going to tell the story again.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Remember last year when I had that big thing

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
where I was at the RuPaul's Drag Race finale

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
and I got to actually ask a question.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
It was supposed to be on TV.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Now it got cut, but it's like a deleted scene you can see online.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Yes, that's me, isn't it?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
If you Google it on Logo's site or whatever,

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
you can see the RuPaul's Drag Race Season 4 deleted scene,

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
and I'm the first guy that asked the question.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Well, I was so nervous before that.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
I literally thought I was going to barf,

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
and I had to go to the bathroom right before that happened.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
In fact, I asked one of the handlers,

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
I'm like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
I could feel my heart beating,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
but then all of a sudden when the camera's on,

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
I'm just like, I'll better.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
It just melted away.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
The only thing that will get me over going on roller coasters

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
is just going on roller coasters.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
That's really the only thing you can do.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Showtime is nothing for you, Rob.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
You said to sensitize yourself to it.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Let me introduce that phantom voice you just heard

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
who hadn't been introduced.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Who the hell was that guy?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
That disconnected, deep radio voice.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Well, you hopefully will recognize that disconnected, deep voice

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
as a voice you hear in the intro to the show every night.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Or the pre-intro, if you will.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
Say hello, everybody, to Jason, or VXJsonXVYZ.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
It's me, again.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
I'm doing this for almost a year,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
and that's crazy to me to think about.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Here you are, visiting yet again from Colorado.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
But it helps that you come out to San Francisco a lot for work

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
and we happen to be on the way.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
And then drive two hours and kill the better part of my Sunday.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
But hey, it's all for a good cause, so no complaints here.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Are we allowed to talk about your job here on the show?

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Yeah, I've meant when I had you talk about the game off.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
I can't remember, because sometimes we get people in here

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
who are in the game industry, so we can't say where they work.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Shane!

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
But it's the big N, Rob!

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
But anyway, you work at GitHub.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
I do.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
So you guys have your Git-togethers in San Francisco, right?

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
I wonder if that came up as a possible name for these big collections.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
They bring the whole company, because Git together.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
I'll give you that one on the house.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
We appreciate that. I'll run it by legal.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Make sure that it's still free.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
GitHub brings everybody in for twice yearly summits, January and August.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
And so I've been out here.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
The first time was when I started working here.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
The second time was the summit in August.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
We had a little Git-together in November for my team specifically.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
And now this is the second summit that I've been a part of with the company.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
It's the company's fifth, I believe.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
And it's my second.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
And it starts tomorrow.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
And I'm kind of excited.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Now, real quick, I sort of have a vague idea what GitHub is,

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
but I kind of feel like I'm not nerdy enough to GitHub.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
So what is GitHub?

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
And where could a beginner nerd like me,

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
what could I profit from visiting GitHub

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
and making it a part of my daily routine?

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Oh, man, you threw me a curveball.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
So the point of GitHub is to foster collaboration and development.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
The point is to make it easy to collaborate with fellow programmers,

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
fellow developers, designers, what have you,

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
and get things done mutually, beneficially.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
Our slogan is something close to making collaborative development easier

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
and I already screwed it up.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Collaborative development easier than by yourself.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Very much the open source movement,

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
but development in large part is better with multiple people, period.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
You yourself personally, I'm not sure that I have a specific use case for.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
We're branching out into documentation.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
One of the more interesting stories about GitHub last year

09:06.000 --> 09:12.000
was Obama for America had their whole back-end system,

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
their CMS and everything on GitHub.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
And they were actually doing a tour, so they dropped by the office.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
They were pretty cool people.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
Like writers, designers, developers,

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
there is a very obvious use case for them

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
because it's watching your works change through time.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
And if something goes wrong, you can go back to it.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
It's change control. It's revision control.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
You specifically, I'm not sure.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
In my day job, I work a lot with,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
I've been getting more and more,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
just dabbing my big toe into the Visual Basic macros.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Is that something you guys support?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Yeah, absolutely.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
The source behind those macros you can put on there,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
change them when you need to if something,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
if you find that a change...

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
There you go. You kind of sold me

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
because actually I had to learn.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Everything I learned about Visual Basic, I Googled.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
I didn't take a class or nothing.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
I was like, I know this is something possible.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I know if I click here,

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
I know it can run a macro to copy another cell

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
and put it on a clipboard and make it plain text

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
and stitch cells together and all that.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
I know that's possible.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
And I learned how to do all that through Googling.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
But GitHub, I probably could have done it in about a tenth of the time.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Humongous source control warehouse.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Source control database.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Yeah, I don't think about your day job.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
I just think about this when I hear about you.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
That's right.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
You could just use Google

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
because Google would probably source GitHub

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
as one of the responses for that.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Fair enough. Fair enough.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
That's fine. I do try to keep my day job and night job separate.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Because I don't want the day job knowing I have this gig

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
where I say fuck a lot.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
It's a little unprofessional and so forth.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
That trainer has such a potty mouth.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
We're going to use it in class.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Mr. Rob is psycho.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Bruce Wayne never goes to any of his functions as Batman.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I mean, it just doesn't make any sense.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
It's kind of like that.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
That's a very, very good...

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
And you're the Joker.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
No, no.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
I can imagine what a board meeting would go like now.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
So, Mr. Wayne, have you looked at the financial report?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
I'm Batman.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
I did not look at the financial report.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Mr. Wayne, are you okay?

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
I'm fine.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Also say hello joining us in studio.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Say hello, everybody.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
That is my Batman voice.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
I am Batman.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
Say hello, everybody, to Ry Chan is visiting us here in studio as well tonight.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
How are you doing?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Not too bad.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
I am psycho.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
You're looking at me like I'm psycho.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
The only thing I have in my head after you use that voice is the Snickers commercial.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Gotta love those old Snickers commercials.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
They were great.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
So what are you doing here?

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
You don't work out here.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
You're just here for fun.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
I actually managed to get a week off work.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
You gotta put that mic real close to your mouth.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
It's not that sensitive.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I managed to actually get a week off work.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Hooray.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Hooray.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Vacation.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
After retail holidays, I am so happy to be out.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Oh, my gosh.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
I can only imagine.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
I remember from the last time you were here, wasn't it like a crafting type of store or something?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
I work in the printing center in an OfficeMax.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Oh, okay.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Why did I get that?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
No, it was your other friend that worked in the crafting store.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
It was the gal that you brought that one show.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
She was pretty cool.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
I never met her before.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Oh.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Rachel?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Yeah.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Her mom runs Babetas.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
You gotta bring her back someday.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
I tried to.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
But for now, we got Ry.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
I love Ry too.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
So it works out.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
So Ry, what happens in San Francisco?

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
What kind of touristy things you've been doing over there?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
I just got in yesterday morning.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
No.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
You haven't had time to do shit.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Nothing yet.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
All right.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Anything on the agenda?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Dinner.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Dinner.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Dinner and more dinner and concerts and music and dinner.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
And relaxing and sleeping and a little bit of Diablo.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
You are a Diablo 3 nut.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
I am.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
I say that in the most, and it's interesting to me because I really tried to get on the Diablo 3 bandwagon.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
You and I even played some games together and I'm just like, it's not WoW.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
I can't.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Or it's not Diablo 2 to me.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
But Diablo 3, it's working for you.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
And I say, great, great.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Good for you.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
It's okay.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I may not like the same game that you like.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
What is it about Diablo 3 that keeps you coming back though?

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
Because you're like level 60 plus the uber levels and all that stuff, right?

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Yeah.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
I've got seven level 60 characters.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
I've got, my main character is Paragon 54 right now.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Jesus Christ.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Right now it's more of a social thing for me.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Just kind of hanging out with friends and play.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
That's fair.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
That's my excuse for WoW.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
I have a Paragon.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Do not.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Do not go there.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Can we get through one freaking show?

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
No.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Without you going there.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
All right.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Anyway.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
Jamie's sitting in the back going, well, if you have seven of them, why don't you try a Renegade?

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Just do the Renegade to get the full story.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Paragon.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Hey, I don't play Renegade.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Have you ever heard of Diablo 3?

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Rob!

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
Who was another person in this room that signed the damn blood pact?

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
I had to.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
I had to.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
All right.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Let's see.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
So what's your favorite class in Diablo 3?

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
My monk has been my favorite.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Monks are pretty cool.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I like the witch doctor and I like the monk.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Good times.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Where's PVP?

14:10.000 --> 14:17.000
1.0.7, which the opening notes just came out the other day for.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Is that something you're interested in or you're like meh?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Meh.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Okay.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
A dismissive hand wave?

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Yeah.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
But some of the other stuff coming in.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
The MP experience boost and all that kind of stuff is going to be fun.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
XP.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Love it.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Yay, more XP.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
Did you fool around with Torchlight 2 at all?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
I have not.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
I take offense to that.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
What?

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Did she fool?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Okay, sorry.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
It's a video game.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
I talk about cheating on WoW all the time.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Sometimes you have a relationship with a video game.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
I jest.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
Have you heard about the story that's floating around the game blogs this week?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Thanks, JB.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
What the fuck's so funny?

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
I jest.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
No, no.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
Macho Man in chat said new class for Diablo dork.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Shut up, Macho Man.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Alright.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Ooh, burn.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Macho Man, I would be all over that class.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Ooh, yeah.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Snap into a Batman.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Alright, um.

15:13.000 --> 15:19.000
Half Macho Man, half like, I don't know, the penguin from like the 1960s Batman or something.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
I don't really know what that is.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Call it 20 minutes into the show.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
We've lost it.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Quack, quack, quack.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Um.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
That's a good idea there, Loki.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Quack, quack, quack.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Um.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
We should just do a show like that.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I could just sit here and do Batman villains live.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Do you want to talk games tonight?

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
The April 1st, you know, Orange Lounge.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
The 500th episode.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
We'll just.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Well, not 500.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Oh, yeah, that is 500.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Yeah, remember we talked about this last week.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Goddammit.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
Well, there goes my plan to do it like as like all Batman villains because that would

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
be kind of.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
We'll make another show.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
I'm sorry, I totally could not make it through an entire show doing the Eartha Kitt Catwoman.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Uh, where was I?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Torchlight 2, Diablo 3.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
Yeah, you were starting to ask me about Torchlight.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Yes, I was, but I was also going on the tangent about that story that's around the game blogs

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
about how people can spend like 250 hours or like 1000 hours with one video game.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
I don't know what the fuck they're talking about.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Yeah, look at.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
I mean, I'm talking about like what was it like Romancing Saga 3 or like just these these

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
interesting video games that people are spending tons of time with.

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
And it's just about you just obsess over that one game and exploring every little nook

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
and cranny of it.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
I don't know.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
I don't know anything about my wrong crowd to talk about that story.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
I have no idea because nobody sits around trying to get the fly cam to work on Mass Effect

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
2 for hours.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
I never played that many hours in Grand Theft Auto 4.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Why don't you let Rai Chan talk?

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Walk walk walk.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
All right.

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
My monk is sitting at about six hundred and fifty five hours last I've checked.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
That's just my monk.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Is that is one.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
Is there a command in Diablo three like slash played?

16:57.000 --> 17:03.000
Because there's a game in World of Warcraft and it's kind of like who's actually willing

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
to type slash played because then it will show you how many hours you've invested on

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
that character in World of Warcraft and it can be very soul breaking.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Anybody else can look up that information on a player can't they?

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
Yeah you just look on your profile page and it'll show you how much time you spent with

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
each of your classes.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
But can other people see that at will whenever you're playing as that character?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Yes.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Okay.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
You can see my entire group of characters and how many hours have been spent.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
The only thing is is that it since I have two monks and two demon hunters it only shows

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
you the top of the two.

17:35.000 --> 17:40.000
Do you play with strangers ever or do you only like play exclusively with friends?

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
It depends on who's on.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
Right now I try to play with friends as much as possible and it's kind of hard because

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
I have so many on there so limit only four players per game.

17:51.000 --> 17:57.000
But if other people aren't on then we tend to join in public games right now.

17:57.000 --> 18:02.000
What's your best dumbass story from playing with strangers?

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
I think she has a unfortunately it's not it's not a random person but I think one of her

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
recent friends has the best story of the group so far.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Even better.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
No you're not getting the the wife and Skype.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Oh shit really?

18:15.000 --> 18:21.000
No names no names protect the innocent but just the whole the the long and the short

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
of the long.

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
We're in Gotham City we need to bring these people to justice so we need to hear the story.

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
What it what it amounts to is that Ryan is usually with a group of however many people

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
are actually online on either some kind of a ventrilo Skype whatever conference call.

18:36.000 --> 18:42.000
And she was telling me about this story about one of the one of the gamers was playing and

18:42.000 --> 18:48.000
the his Skype call was he didn't have headphones on it was playing and his wife hears another

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
woman's voice.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
And so the two of them are just broadcasting their fight to the whole rest of the party

18:53.000 --> 18:59.000
just just flipping their shit because there's some other woman's voice coming from the computer.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
Yeah just an oh my God you told me that you were going to if you were ever going to be

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
talking to another woman you would tell me about it.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
No this got it.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Oh it was.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
I think that's the best story she's told me so far.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
Really woman needs to get over her insecurity issues.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Yes.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Yeah.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
Listening to them scream and cuss at each other was not a good thing.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
It was the most entertaining 30 minutes of your life.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
That's what she's supposed to say.

19:23.000 --> 19:29.000
Well well in and VOG 006 who's in chat.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
It was actually the other person who was in with us.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
He hasn't figured out yet how to go through and change it.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
But he he's in there.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
New users new listeners.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
We love them slash Nick.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
All right.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Oh Nick please not so quick.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
All right.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Welcome to the show.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
I hope things go well.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
It's good to be back.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
Hope we get some more embarrassing stories throughout the night especially about other people.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Those are the best kind.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
All right.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
Let's talk about our gaming ways and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
Maybe it's you know more Diablo 3 or in Dark Soccer's case.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
I can't possibly imagine what she's been playing but I'm going to go over there and ask anyway.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Dark Soccer.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
How was your gaming playing a healthy this kiss my ass.

20:07.000 --> 20:13.000
No I played I played some well because I don't kick.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
I don't kiss as I kick it.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
OK.

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
Someone get that man a lozenge.

20:22.000 --> 20:34.000
So yeah I've I played some well and which Rob can vouch for since I chatted with him on while and we made my Jane Shepherd because I hate playing monks.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Actually I don't like monks.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Not much.

20:38.000 --> 20:44.000
I actually I really hate the animations for monks on blood elves are just too skinny.

20:44.000 --> 21:01.000
I also played Mass Effect 3 and Mass Effect 2 and I've actually my time in Mass Effect 2 has been nothing but trying to get fly cam to work which I have it working in everything except conversation modes although I did figure out the debug cam but it's still kind of a pain in the ass.

21:01.000 --> 21:07.000
I found out though interesting rendering issues that happen in the game when you try to enable the debug cam.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
So I'm also playing limbo which I'm really not very good at.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
I started playing that on the train again.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
I wanted to kind of get through some of those puzzles that I hadn't done in a while.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
I can't get past the damn block floating in the water.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Like do you crawl over it and then make it float or?

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
You use the block to get a rope that's slightly hidden behind a tree.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
The fuck? How am I supposed to see that?

21:29.000 --> 21:40.000
You you you grab the block you pull it back there's a little rope and you can scale the trees on their edges and there's a more or less broken branch that you push over it falls to the ground you push it over the water.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
The fuck?

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
You're at the very baby steps of that game. Oh wow.

21:43.000 --> 21:48.000
I know but I get pissed off and then it's like well fuck this noise I'm not gonna play anymore.

21:48.000 --> 22:10.000
That's a lot of the trick that's like the I don't want to call it the gimmick of the game because the design in general is really fantastic and it doesn't it doesn't abuse that but that's very much the the gimmick of the game is that the the scaling and the directional because you know it has the whole background foreground covers that it'll kind of do the foreground to trick your eyes when you're going forward and reset you from what's actually in the playable game.

22:11.000 --> 22:21.000
But yeah grab the block bring it back look for a tiny little rope dangling from the tree scale up you'll find a break in a tree action push.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Okay I'm doing that tonight you know.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
And now I wonder though if it's one of the games they've enabled with Linux yet.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
I have not been keeping any look at that library whatsoever.

22:31.000 --> 22:39.000
Anybody? Linux? Limbo? I mean it is Mac compatible so hopefully it's easy enough to bring to the whole saga.

22:39.000 --> 22:49.000
I just don't think it would be too hard for my netbook to handle the game but it's actually one that I can just actually leave on a screen and look around because I think it's pretty.

22:49.000 --> 22:54.000
Yeah it's two two tones the the the look of that game is ridiculously good.

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
I love monochromatic stuff and then I've actually started drawing again.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Yay drawing!

23:01.000 --> 23:14.000
Well I know I've talked about it on the show before but with my hand injury after my surgery I had a really hard time drawing because if I keep my hand in one position too long it'll cramp up really badly and painfully.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
I haven't been able to break down the scar tissue in my hand.

23:18.000 --> 23:25.000
So I found out the hard way that the pressure sensitivity in my tablet went out.

23:25.000 --> 23:33.000
So I actually took out paper and pencil and started drawing my one of my femsheps just drawing.

23:33.000 --> 23:41.000
And I got I managed to draw something I was in a lot of pain when I was done but I drew something and that's related to video games because of Garris.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
Okay femshep. Oh my god Rob.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
Trufflemania has landed on the Orange Lounge radio table.

23:47.000 --> 23:53.000
Hello my name is Jamie and I like to do drawings.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
You know what's funny? What?

23:55.000 --> 24:03.000
I spent two hours watching episodes of Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings.

24:03.000 --> 24:09.000
Which have you ever seen what that skit came from Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings?

24:09.000 --> 24:15.000
Wait the one that was on Saturday Night Live that Mike Myers did?

24:15.000 --> 24:21.000
Yeah I grew up watching Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings and I thought no one else had heard of it until I found out another friend of mine had.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
No I knew it was based on like a real thing so good times.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
Alright then I guess we're on to Loki. How was your game week?

24:28.000 --> 24:37.000
I played lots of Skyrim because I was working on getting the PC version. Well I got the PC version working of course.

24:37.000 --> 24:44.000
But I loaded on about I think I have 97 mods running right now.

24:45.000 --> 24:55.000
And the whole point was I wanted to add a bunch of stuff to the game so that it would seem not necessarily new but like I would forget what mods I put on there.

24:55.000 --> 25:00.000
So I wouldn't know if like hey I just haven't run across this yet or hey this is something new.

25:00.000 --> 25:05.000
So I did that and my character is really overpowered and stuff but it's kind of fun.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
And of course I had to mess with everything.

25:09.000 --> 25:20.000
Got super jumping, got this really creepy puppet master thing where there's these puppets that run around that you can summon that are really creepy looking.

25:20.000 --> 25:27.000
And then I have the mod where you can summon a bear that plays Miserulu which is awesome.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Wait what?

25:31.000 --> 25:45.000
It's a bear that plays Miserulu. It was great too because I really need to start broadcasting or recording this stuff because I was in a dungeon and you're supposed to be sneaking around or whatever to attack people.

25:45.000 --> 25:55.000
So what did I do? I spawned my puppet thing who ran down and charged after them. I spawned the bear that started playing Miserulu and I jumped down and hit him with a squeaky bat.

25:56.000 --> 26:02.000
If you are interested in broadcasting on the OLR broadcast channel I can give you all that information and the software. The software is free.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Okay.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
So yeah.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
That might be fun.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Not breaking any rules.

26:06.000 --> 26:22.000
So I've been playing a lot of that and played a little bit of well actually played quite a bit of Borderlands 2 this week. Finished the single player campaign and yeah we cheated.

26:22.000 --> 26:29.000
But that's alright though because it's a lot more fun when we have really overpowered guns. A lot more fun.

26:29.000 --> 26:34.000
So we did that and what else?

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
Do you own Borderlands on both the 360 and the PC?

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
I have Borderlands 1 on PC and 360. I have Borderlands 2 only on 360.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Okay.

26:45.000 --> 26:52.000
I have Borderlands 1 on PlayStation 3 and PC but that's because PS3 did the whole free with PlayStation Plus and I was like what the hell? Why not?

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
Nuts to lack of cross platform multiplayer. As always.

26:57.000 --> 27:10.000
And then today I tried playing Forza Horizon although I see I was going to play because I have the Microsoft racing wheel and I've been meaning to try that out.

27:10.000 --> 27:22.000
So the first thing I started trying to use the right racing wheel and I realized oh I need the AC adapter plugged in there because you have to have a battery pack and an AC adapter for the damn thing to work which is really ridiculous.

27:22.000 --> 27:36.000
So I did that and then when I tried syncing the racing wheel with the 360 I broke the, well I temporarily broke the sync button on the racing wheel so I had to take the whole thing apart to fix that.

27:36.000 --> 27:46.000
So I got that fixed. Finally with like 5 minutes left before I had to leave I got to play with the steering wheel and I realized I don't like the steering wheel.

27:47.000 --> 27:59.000
It kind of, well it doesn't suck but it's just like I oversteer so easy on that thing it's just not very comfortable and also I didn't really have it set up on like a TV stand or something like that.

27:59.000 --> 28:08.000
I'm not sure that thing was made for the type of arcade racer that Forza Horizon is anyway. I mean Forza Horizon and like Forza 4 control very differently.

28:09.000 --> 28:14.000
So yeah I'm probably not going to play with that because it's kind of a pain in the ass to set all that up.

28:14.000 --> 28:22.000
But I wanted to have used it for something because it was going to be used on the arcade cabinet but I just haven't gotten around to doing anything with it.

28:22.000 --> 28:31.000
So I just kind of like hey I have this thing I'm going to try it out and see if it's any good and it's alright but controller is probably going to be the way I go with that.

28:32.000 --> 28:43.000
And then what else did I play? I played a bit of Modern Warfare 3. I think we played about a day of that. No it was alright.

28:45.000 --> 28:50.000
I've been trying to play a lot more stuff on my Steam account. I've been downloading things.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Make use out of it. Good man.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Yeah.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Alright. Anything else?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
That's it yeah.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
Then let us go over to I guess I'll go and then our guests can go.

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
As far as my gaming week honestly not a whole lot of new stuff.

29:05.000 --> 29:13.000
You know this is kind of a time to catch up and to be fair I've been playing a lot of WoW because I'm trying to gear up a character so that she's ready to raid.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
Because we're having some changes in our raiding roster.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
When there was some other changes with guilds and things like that.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
That is all on Hoard House.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
By the way just I got to plug the other show I do.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
Best Little Hoard House in Azeroth. Hoardhouse.com.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
We had an epic show this week and if you like reality television at all.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
We had Ronnie who was on Big Brother CBS a couple years ago.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
Was our guest because he was like the video game nerd on his season.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
Well like he legit he knows his shit with WoW and he was on the show.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
So it was a great show so please please check it out at Hoardhouse.com.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
Even if you don't like reality TV it was still a fun show and we talked Warcraft.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
So that kind of took up a lot of my time.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
But I did I you know I actually was using Netflix on the Wii U.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
I know that's not a game but it's kind of my preferred Netflix device.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
I was watching a movie the other night.

29:55.000 --> 30:00.000
And then I was playing on the 3DS the demo for Mutant Mudds.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
Which I liked it's like a kind of like an 8-bit platformer.

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
But the whole fact that you can jump into the background and you come up into the foreground.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
The 3D kind of lends itself very well to that whole thing.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
But you know if you like retro games I'm sure Mutant Mudds is something that's right up your alley.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
And there's the demo so go check it out for 30 plays.

30:16.000 --> 30:21.000
And kind of because of Shane I found my copy of Pokemon Pearl.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
And it's always Shane's fault. Fucker.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
He is such a dealer.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
In a way in a way I mean I've done it to him too.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
It goes both ways but the talk of the new Pokemon games.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
I'm not going to spoil it because I know there's a news story coming up on it earlier.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
But I think we all know new Pokemon games were announced this week.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
And so I was asking questions about can you send Pokemon back and forth.

30:41.000 --> 30:46.000
Because the new game looks like it fixes like a lot of the problems I've had with the older games.

30:46.000 --> 30:53.000
And the older games I'm like they haven't they don't look any fucking different than they did in the original black and white Game Boy.

30:53.000 --> 30:58.000
Like they don't like yeah they're in color and there's extra things but they've changed very little.

30:58.000 --> 31:03.000
First rule of Nintendo development. Don't change anything unless you really have to.

31:03.000 --> 31:08.000
But this new one looks really like they have like totally redone it.

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
So I'm very excited about that. We'll talk more about the reboots later.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
Or I shouldn't say reboot. How it's not a reboot. We'll talk about that later.

31:16.000 --> 31:25.000
But then I got it got me to thinking I'm like well I kind of want to I want to be able to like be really cool and have like Pokemon from the old games that I can transfer into the new games.

31:25.000 --> 31:32.000
Because I guess every Pokemon game has to have the coding and the programming for every single stinking Pokemon before it.

31:32.000 --> 31:40.000
Because you transfer from one game to like I guess even the newest like black to white to have the classic Pokemon red and blue characters in them.

31:40.000 --> 31:48.000
Because it is possible to have like a what's a what's a great Pokemon from the red blue era. Let's say Jinx to have a Jinx.

31:48.000 --> 31:53.000
Porygon! Like like traitor all the way up. It's possible.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
So I'm kind of like well maybe I should just make use of the Pokemon games I have.

31:56.000 --> 32:03.000
I played for 30 minutes and I was like I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do this for 40 hours or however long it takes to play a game. But we'll see.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
How do you transfer your collections all the way up like that?

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
There's ways to do it. You have to you have to have the right systems and the right.

32:09.000 --> 32:18.000
But like you know in the original DS's had the well the Game Boy Advances could read both regular Game Boy games and advanced games.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
So I'm sure you can connect the two together and do it that way.

32:21.000 --> 32:27.000
Okay and then the DS's had the advanced port and the regular port like the original ones.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
Yeah the Fats did.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
So you could do it that way and then.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
And now DS is an upper all network based.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
They're all network based exactly so now you do it that way.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
Wow.

32:35.000 --> 32:43.000
That's crazy to think that Nintendo still has like a straight line of interconnection with at least one generation like that.

32:43.000 --> 32:48.000
Technist in our chatroom says I haven't played Pokemon since Red, Blue, Yellow. Well in my opinion Technist you haven't missed much.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
Same.

32:49.000 --> 32:55.000
But these new ones look like it's gonna really correct that.

32:55.000 --> 32:59.000
I tried to jump back in. We have Diamond and Pearl.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
We do have Diamond and Pearl.

33:01.000 --> 33:16.000
I told myself that I love the concept of what you can do with Pokemon and I would jump into it when I feel that the features, the hardware is available to make really cool features and so we both bought into Diamond and Pearl.

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
I played it for an hour or two maybe and I just said ehhh.

33:20.000 --> 33:25.000
And now I find out that Black 2 and White 2 are original DS and not 3DS.

33:25.000 --> 33:33.000
I don't really remember what my complaint about that was but it just surprised me because it came out well after the 3DS was in existence.

33:33.000 --> 33:40.000
Of course I haven't played regularly since Yellow. I actually still have the Game Boy, the special Game Boy from Yellow.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Yes you do.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
Let's see going to some comments from our chatters at live.vognetwork.com.

33:44.000 --> 33:50.000
AlphaCananagram says Skye, Pokemon kind of changed in a certain generation stats wise where it couldn't go up?

33:50.000 --> 33:55.000
SSJ100Matt says the farthest back you can go are the Game Boy Advance Leaf, Green, Fire, Red games.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Well it wouldn't surprise me if Shane lied to me y'all.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
I got all this from Shane so take it up with him.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
Alright he can call in later to defend himself.

34:03.000 --> 34:08.000
I'll go ahead and share the details of a private chat we were having between Shane and I.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
He was asking what starter Pokemon I picked in Pearl and what I named him.

34:11.000 --> 34:16.000
Because I just remembered he did have a really great name for his, what is it, Chimchar?

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Is it a little monkey? A little fire monkey?

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Umm, Chim...

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Yeah it's Chimchar.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
I don't think so that doesn't sound right.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
Well he named his Chimchar which we're going to call it now until the chatter corrects us.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
He named his Chimchar, Ho-Monkey.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Think about it, Ho-Monkey.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Homo and Key.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Homo, Homo and Key. Get it?

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
So I said well what do I name him?

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Name yours Flaming Finger.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
No, I picked a Piplup because they're little penguins and penguins are adorable right?

34:45.000 --> 34:51.000
And I was like well I didn't think to give it a dirty name because I need to know their regular name.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
I can't remember my name and their name.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
Like if you want me to learn Pokemon I just need to call it what it is right?

34:57.000 --> 35:01.000
I very rarely, I think I do this in any RPG I play.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
I don't change their names. I need to know their regular names.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
So in your head Sanrio's name is Kat?

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Yes.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
So...

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Sharmi was other Kat.

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
So Shane suggested I call, I should go back and call him Penisquin.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Didn't even think about that.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Didn't even think about that.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
Alright and Misty in chat by the way says it is Chimchar Jason.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
I thought we were still talking original 151.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
You are. Oh then you're thinking Charizard.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
No I'm thinking Chim...

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Chim...

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Oh Charmander.

35:33.000 --> 35:37.000
I remember Mankey and for the life of me I can't think of the evolved version of it.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
I named my Mankey a very dirty word in Japanese.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Alright anyhow.

35:43.000 --> 35:49.000
So now that I've been talking about Pokemon on this show for 10 minutes we should probably move on with other gaming.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
I was going to say one more thing about Forza Horizon.

35:51.000 --> 35:57.000
Of course obviously the one thing that's blatantly in your face is that stupid festival.

35:57.000 --> 36:01.000
Which I was like oh my god I don't fucking care about the god damn festival I want to race.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
I want to race. I don't care about it.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
You'll get it.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
That was the same thing that bothered me at first.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
That slowly slips into the background.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
It doesn't matter anymore. You'll be fine.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Thank you for bringing that up because I did spend a night on Forza Horizon.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
We had a fun night.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
Some of the VoG people. It was myself, Bobby, ActDeft, SSJ100Matt.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
We were all playing and it was a good time.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
So we'll probably do that again during the week.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
So keep an eye on Twitter for when we're going to play some Forza Horizon.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Because that's a fun game.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
So how do you add the VoG Car Club thing?

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Because I couldn't find that option.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Of course I only looked for about a minute.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
I'll invite you.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
If somebody hasn't already done it by the time those words left my mouth.

36:38.000 --> 36:43.000
Because if you're on the friends list of ActDeft or Bobby or somebody.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
They just go into the car club. They can find you.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
But I think for other people.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
I think when you go to the car club you can search for VoG.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
V-O-G.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
And that's the tag. V-O-G.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
It's easy to find.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Alright, let's move on.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Less Pokey, more me.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Yes, less Pokey, more Jason.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
Pokey Jason, how was your gaming week?

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
I have no idea how to respond to that.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
I didn't know this was that kind of show.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Hey, at least I didn't call you home monkey.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Alright.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
I have been a very bad gamer.

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
Like I believe I said at the top of the show.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
I was out here in November.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
I spent Christmas with my family in western Colorado.

37:25.000 --> 37:31.000
So I was away from all of my exciting electronic video boxes.

37:31.000 --> 37:35.000
I haven't played very much in a very long time.

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
I had the discussion with Jamie that I kind of started to poke back into limbo.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Because it sounded interesting.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
But my go to hobby is turning into music.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
And that's taking over quite a bit.

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
Because I don't know that I've even touched Borderlands 2 since October.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Maybe November.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
I just... I play lots of tiny little things.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
Like I have stupid apps on my phone.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
I touch my 3S every once in a great while.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
But I just don't...

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
There's nothing that I have that dedication to right now.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
I'll tell you a secret.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Mixing music is something I've kind of always wanted to get into as well.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
I've tried. I've downloaded programs to try and do it.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
But you can't do it software only.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
I took the plunge.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
I made the $500 investment to get a controller that appealed to...

38:18.000 --> 38:24.000
The $500 investment more like $1500 after my case, speakers, mixer, cables, and shit.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
Alan! That's what I want for my birthday.

38:28.000 --> 38:33.000
And that's kind of where I'm at right now.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
I pick up new music. I play around with it.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
I find ways to put it into mixes.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
Are you playing dubstep?

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
No. I was actually...

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
I've been asked that sarcastically.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
But I've gotten a few no shit requests about it.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
And I started thinking about my library.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
I'm like, well I have Skrillex because I was on that bandwagon.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Look at your library. Look at your choices.

38:55.000 --> 39:00.000
If my choices are based off my library, I have very few complaints.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
You actually just made me think of something though.

39:03.000 --> 39:08.000
There's a YouTube video of a cockatiel trilling dubstep.

39:09.000 --> 39:15.000
Because you know birds adapt to sounds around them into their language?

39:15.000 --> 39:19.000
The bird speaks dubstep.

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
I definitely need to see this sometime.

39:22.000 --> 39:28.000
People want some music to be played at a party or whatever.

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
I've gotten completely serious requests to play something like that.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
And I just kind of think of what I have in my library.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
And it's like, I know a couple of these artists.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
I have a couple of one-offs.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
I have Skrillex because everybody jumped on that bandwagon.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
Some people call knife party dubstep even though they are not.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
But I could not play 30 minutes worth.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Get Nero. Nero's awesome.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
Nero's...

39:49.000 --> 39:54.000
House dubstep and... what else does he do? Drum and bass.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
Yeah, I really enjoy Nero. I just don't have very much of his stuff.

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
In all fairness, because I don't want the dubstep fans to email the show.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
I hate you. Wub wub wub.

40:07.000 --> 40:14.000
I acquired the new Muse album this past week, which is a great album.

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
One of their songs though is a little bit dubstep experimentation.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
It's the best song on the whole album. It really is.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
It really is, for real.

40:22.000 --> 40:27.000
Yeah, my two joints right now are the general house genre.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
It's kind of progressive, electro, maybe down to trance.

40:30.000 --> 40:35.000
But then I play a lot of UK and Happy Hardcore that I've enjoyed for a very long time.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
And now I can actually do something interesting with it, so that's been pretty fun.

40:38.000 --> 40:44.000
And the great culmination of that is that my company, my employer, is putting on two shows this week.

40:44.000 --> 40:50.000
Tuesday at Mighty Down in San Francisco and Thursday a very public event at Public Works San Francisco.

40:50.000 --> 40:56.000
And I'm going to be on stage and I am freaking scared and excited and crazy.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
You're going to be like closely about to get on a roller coaster at Disneyland.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Yes, very much so.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Right.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
Ry, how was your gaming week? What kind of video games have you been playing lately?

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
Diablo?

41:07.000 --> 41:11.000
Not 24-7, but for the most of it.

41:11.000 --> 41:15.000
Just 22-7, you know. I need a couple of hours of work.

41:15.000 --> 41:22.000
Yeah, I went from Paragon, I believe, 47 up to 54 the past week.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
Running public games and whatnot.

41:26.000 --> 41:31.000
The only other thing that I've played recently was Lego Lord of the Rings that I got for my birthday.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Oh, of course.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
I really haven't gotten very far in it.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
Because?

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
Diablo 3.

41:40.000 --> 41:44.000
That's like a lot of games for me in World of Warcraft, so I don't feel bad.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Alright.

41:46.000 --> 41:50.000
Well, I hope you can discover some more games in the coming weeks.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
Because eventually you're going to hit Paragon 60 and then what?

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
Paragon 100.

41:55.000 --> 41:59.000
60 is the standard level cap, but Paragon is 100.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
And that's of course also per character.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
She has... no?

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
No, I am done after I get this character.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
That's what they all say, huh?

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
It can be. Paragon is still specific to a character.

42:12.000 --> 42:16.000
And should she want to, she does have six other characters anyways.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
Alright, anyhow.

42:17.000 --> 42:23.000
Not to mention the fact that there's an achievement for getting ten level 60s and having two of each class at level 60.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
She has the plan.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
It's all about the achievements.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Actually, that was another thing I was doing this week.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
I was trying to achievement hunt in old games.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Okay, guys.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Guess what game I played this week just to get an achievement.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
Yars.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Worse. Worse.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
Dino Dash.

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
What is an Xbox Live Arcade game worse than Yaris and worse than Dino Dash?

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Avatar.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Worse than Avatar.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Um...

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Xbox Live Arcade.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
It's offensive to anybody who listened to this show earlier today.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
Yes, I would say it beat and groovy.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Beat and groovy. I played beat and groovy this week.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Oh, shame on you.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
And I got a new achievement.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
To put money into that.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
I had to play every song in three button mode.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
I was so bored.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
And like, Alan walked out into the room.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
He's like, this looks bad.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
What is this?

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
I'm like, it's on Xbox Live Arcade.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
I'm like, doesn't it look like it's PlayStation 1?

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
He's like, yeah, look at those character animations.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Those are real next-gen right there.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
So...

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
Yeah.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
I had one of those weeks.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
Shame. Shame.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
That's just a travesty.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
No, shame to chat.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
Alright.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
I found something for you.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
Oh, this is for me.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
So this is...

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
Oh, yes. Okay.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
Because earlier when you were talking about the bird singing dubstep, I'm like...

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
Oh boy.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
This show's been derailed seven times from Sunday already.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
So...

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
What the hell?

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
What's another video gonna add to it?

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
Okay, here we go.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
I think that's the one.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
So this is bird singing dubstep.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
If there's an ad on this, so help me God.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
So help me God.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
Rod, it's not my fault.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
You need to have your ad block up.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
You're using Chrome, right?

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
No, you're not.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
Why are you using Chrome?

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
Firefox.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
Shame on you.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
That's it.

44:02.000 --> 44:17.000
That's it.

44:17.000 --> 44:24.000
The funny thing is that actually sounds like some pretty impressive beatboxing to an extent.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Stupid bird.

44:26.000 --> 44:31.000
My sister's birds would probably be something like that.

44:31.000 --> 44:36.000
She has a bird that's exactly like that.

44:36.000 --> 44:43.000
I like that it's dancing.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
I could just listen to that for three hours.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
I could see the appeal of dubstep.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
I could totally just listen to that tonight.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Let's go to break, you guys.

44:51.000 --> 44:56.000
We're gonna have our music break tonight.

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
Coming soon to DDR.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
You know what's funny though?

45:00.000 --> 45:05.000
Actually birds like in the wild will pick up sounds from civilization around them and

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
really incorporate that into their bird calls.

45:07.000 --> 45:11.000
Like I've heard birds do car alarms and construction sites.

45:11.000 --> 45:16.000
I've heard sounds of birds that sound like they're drilling, like in heavy construction

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
sites.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
SSJ100 Matt in our chat room says, congrats.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
OLR has found the end of the internet.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
That's right.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
We have collectively been eaten by a group.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
Good night everybody.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
I don't know.

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
I was just saying, tard's been replaced by dubstep bird.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
I don't know.

45:34.000 --> 45:40.000
I think Polly, the x-rated parrot might be a little, uh, you know, that came and went

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
though.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
No, it's not Polly.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
It's Ruby.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
Oh yeah, that.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
All right.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Let's, let's move on into some housekeeping.

45:47.000 --> 45:51.000
Facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, twitter.com slash OLR.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
You can also hear this show in Stitcher.

45:53.000 --> 45:57.000
Use thumbs up a lot if you listen there and share with all your friends and spread the

45:57.000 --> 46:04.000
word cause you know, I can't imagine why word of the show doesn't spread like wildfire across

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
the masses.

46:05.000 --> 46:10.000
By the way, speaking of popularity contests, uh, the podcast awards happened this past

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
week and we didn't win.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Uh, that's too bad.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
And I want to give a shout out.

46:15.000 --> 46:19.000
I got to give a shout out to my twitter buddy cause us independent podcasts have to stick

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
together.

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
I got to give a shout out to my twitter buddy Godfrey from a gamer tag radio and you know,

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
he, that is a hard working guy.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Uh, and he is very good at promoting his show.

46:29.000 --> 46:33.000
He's a very passionate podcaster and I honest to God thought he was going to win it.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
I really did.

46:34.000 --> 46:38.000
And you know, it was kind of that thing where it's like, I'd love to win it, but if Godfrey

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
won it, it's hard to be mad because you know, he's been nominated several times.

46:41.000 --> 46:45.000
He's, he's at this point they're becoming like the Susan Lucci of the podcast awards.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
And so it's like, let the, let the guy win already.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
He didn't win either.

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
And I was, I was like legit upset that he didn't win and we didn't win.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
So Rob was doing that thing where he fans his face a little bit.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
I won't cry.

46:56.000 --> 47:00.000
I'm not going to Las Vegas cause Godfrey is probably going to win this year.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
So I'll watch the speech from home.

47:02.000 --> 47:06.000
And then when he didn't win, I'm like, Oh God, that poor guy went all the way to Vegas.

47:06.000 --> 47:10.000
But it sounds like he had some great inspiration and all that and got to meet some really cool

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
people and do the networking.

47:11.000 --> 47:15.000
So shame on me for not going to Vegas, but I'm broke.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
I am broke.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
Christmas broke me.

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
So this was not a good time of the year for the podcast.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
Anyway, uh, that is it, uh, for housekeeping.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Let's get into some gaming news.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
Loki.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
All right.

47:28.000 --> 47:32.000
So let's talk a little bit about CES fun stuff.

47:32.000 --> 47:37.000
And of course one of the big major announcements, um, gaming wise, they kind of happened a little

47:37.000 --> 47:43.000
bit before CES even began was the new Nvidia handheld console that they're putting out.

47:43.000 --> 47:51.000
It's the Nvidia shield and it's a Tegra four, um, based handheld system.

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
And it kind of looks like a controller with a screen attached to it.

47:55.000 --> 47:59.000
And what's kind of unique about it though, aside from the fact that it looks like an

47:59.000 --> 48:03.000
Xbox three 60 controller and has the kind of almost the same button configuration.

48:03.000 --> 48:08.000
That thing is that, uh, first off the display is pretty high def.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
It's a seven 20 P display.

48:10.000 --> 48:16.000
Um, and of course, one of the things you can do with it is run Android games, obviously,

48:16.000 --> 48:24.000
because it is running Android and you can even run, um, PC games on there by streaming

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
them to your system.

48:26.000 --> 48:31.000
And they even have a way to, you know, it has an HDMI out on it, so you can play it

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
on your TV if you want.

48:33.000 --> 48:38.000
Um, but the whole fact that you can basically put in this mode where you stream stuff from

48:38.000 --> 48:42.000
your PC and you can even bring up steam and play like, you know, console games on that

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
is kind of cool.

48:44.000 --> 48:49.000
Um, I can stream anything I want from my, uh, PC to the gaming handheld.

48:49.000 --> 48:55.000
Um, I guess whatever supported from it, but yeah, so number of seconds before porn is

48:55.000 --> 48:59.000
displayed on one of these devices that has a web, it has a web browser in it cause it's

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
Android.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
So yes, it would be no time whatsoever.

49:02.000 --> 49:06.000
But if you think about it though, if you can stream from your PC and I'm assuming though

49:06.000 --> 49:12.000
that you can only do this, um, over LAN, I don't think it's actually, you know, over

49:12.000 --> 49:17.000
the internet, but you could probably do World of Warcraft, you know, sitting in bed with

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
the controller and stuff like that.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
You know, I don't know how you could do a lot sitting in bed.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Yeah.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
No chat though.

49:25.000 --> 49:31.000
Hypothetically, hypothetically, if I happen to have a TV in my bedroom, I could have boobies

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
on the TV and boobies on the little handheld.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
Yes.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
Here dog, I heard you like boobs.

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
So here's some boobs while you're watching boobs.

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
Um, but that's what technology is all about y'all.

49:42.000 --> 49:47.000
So yeah, they have, they have the whole, you know, steam big, uh, big picture mode support

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
on there.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Um, no price announced yet for it.

49:50.000 --> 49:54.000
And obviously, you know, because it's one of the first to fry or devices that has a

49:54.000 --> 49:58.000
ticker form a chip and it's, it'll be interesting to see what it can run.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
Um, they're saying, you know, more console quality games.

50:01.000 --> 50:06.000
Uh, some of the games that they have announced for it, Hawken, which was a PC kind of a mech

50:06.000 --> 50:10.000
shooter and actually, um, what was that?

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
One of the other titles was an old Wii game.

50:13.000 --> 50:18.000
The conduit is going to be getting like some sort of, you know, souped up version.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
They'll be on Android.

50:19.000 --> 50:23.000
Um, so there's that stuff.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
And then of course, you know, some other, you know, Android games, there's going to

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
be more tear for games coming out.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
Um, Nope.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
And like I said, no price point yet.

50:30.000 --> 50:34.000
That's kind of, everyone's like, Oh, it's going to kill the Ouya and stuff like that.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
They haven't announced the price yet.

50:36.000 --> 50:41.000
And the fact that, you know, this thing has got a display on it and the Tegra four, it's

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
most likely not going to be within that $99 price point.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
So I don't know.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
It'll be interesting to see.

50:48.000 --> 50:52.000
I think it's kind of exciting though, because you know, I've been looking forward to possibly

50:52.000 --> 50:57.000
making a computer that'll be hooked up to my TV at someday to use kind of like steam

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
big picture mode.

50:59.000 --> 51:03.000
And you know, the fact that I'll be able to stream stuff to a separate screen, kind of

51:03.000 --> 51:07.000
like you can with the Wii U would be kind of, kind of fun, you know, and actually be

51:07.000 --> 51:12.000
able to, when the wife is hogging the TV, you know, as she's been doing for the last

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
three months,

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
a lot of people on the internet dismissing this as unnecessary.

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
Uh, you know, why, why does Nvidia have to get into this too?

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Why they do their own hand?

51:22.000 --> 51:26.000
They have the chip and I think they've done their own like tablets or they've, I mean,

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
they're providing chips for tablets.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
Why not?

51:28.000 --> 51:32.000
I mean, they've got the Nvidia zone thing for their Tegra stuff, the Tegra 3 stuff.

51:32.000 --> 51:37.000
So because they can, I mean, they're already in the PC marketplace.

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
If you think about it though, this technology, that's the only thing.

51:40.000 --> 51:44.000
You're going to need a really high end graphics card in order to run this because it's built

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
into your graphics card as far as being able to stream to this device.

51:48.000 --> 51:53.000
So really new high end graphics card and it has to be the Nvidia card.

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
So that's why they're in this is because, oh, that's a really cool device.

51:57.000 --> 52:01.000
Oh crap, got to upgrade my graphics card and I have to buy Nvidia.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
So that means more money for them.

52:03.000 --> 52:07.000
It's win-win because they sell the device in the graphics card.

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
So when I first read about this, I was quick to blame the Ouya for this.

52:10.000 --> 52:15.000
I don't know what it is, but I, I, there was a part of me that said Nvidia is doing this

52:15.000 --> 52:19.000
because of the Ouya and because of the way the Ouya took off, Nvidia said, you know,

52:20.000 --> 52:25.000
you know what Ouya's got wrong about this is that Ouya's making them, making you hook it up to a TV.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
What if we did an Ouya that's handheld?

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
I mean, isn't that, that's what a lot of this stuff is.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
An Ouya that's handheld is a tablet.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Well, what, okay.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
With a Bluetooth controller.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Okay, what, isn't that kind of what this is?

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
I mean, it's not a tablet per se, but it might as well be.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
No, this is, I think something else.

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
I think this is just, their whole thing is they're trying to go after PC gaming because,

52:45.000 --> 52:51.000
I mean, they make money off of their chips, but I think they're gonna make more money off their graphics cards

52:51.000 --> 52:56.000
and all the tech that goes into that because, I mean, it's them and ATI, that's it.

52:56.000 --> 53:01.000
That's your choices for graphics cards and anything to edge out the competition to make people say,

53:01.000 --> 53:06.000
hey, you know what, I should get this because it's got, and if you think about it,

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
Nvidia's kind of done stuff like that.

53:07.000 --> 53:13.000
I mean, they have three displays and they have, you know, that built into it and the PhysX stuff

53:13.000 --> 53:20.000
and also now the streaming thing and CUDA cores where you can, you know, run other things using that.

53:20.000 --> 53:24.000
You know, PC applications that support those other cores.

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
I mean, that's kind of the direction they're going.

53:27.000 --> 53:32.000
So I wouldn't exactly blame the Ouya for it because, I mean, they don't know how it's gonna do yet.

53:32.000 --> 53:38.000
I mean, granted, you're seeing a lot more of these set top, I mean, the whole thing with CES was just like,

53:38.000 --> 53:45.000
you know, it's tablets and Google TV and 4K TVs is basically the three big things.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
But all people really want is an iPad.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
I don't think so.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Are you sure?

53:51.000 --> 53:55.000
Yeah. I mean, well, there's the Apple people that have to keep buying new things.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
There's a lot of Apple people though.

53:57.000 --> 54:01.000
There's a lot of people bought the Wii, but, you know, that doesn't mean that Nintendo's doing, you know,

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
really well with the next system.

54:03.000 --> 54:08.000
A quick context jump, at least as far as the consumer is concerned.

54:08.000 --> 54:17.000
A buddy of mine that has this dinosaur of a phone was blown away at the ability to take his Wii U game pad,

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
be in another room in the house and continue to browse the internet.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
He doesn't have to pull out his laptop.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
That too, really.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
Kind of awkward for this anyways. Sorry.

54:27.000 --> 54:34.000
But it was just, it was the most absurd thing for me to read is that, wow, I have four inches of the internet,

54:34.000 --> 54:39.000
right smack dab in this little handheld controller and I don't even have to be in the same room as the TV is in.

54:39.000 --> 54:44.000
And I did one of these things where I reached into my pocket and I pulled out my phone.

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
I was like, wow, I'm not confined to the house.

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
This is like five years in the future.

54:50.000 --> 54:55.000
And it's just strange because it's also like a connectivity excuse.

54:55.000 --> 55:01.000
If you can game anywhere, even on a screen that's that small, people will do it when they can.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
And I think there's application for it.

55:03.000 --> 55:07.000
It's not necessarily, it doesn't necessarily fit in best for us.

55:07.000 --> 55:12.000
Maybe, maybe not as much as another person, but for these people that just have little setups,

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
it has enough of an application to survive in the market, I think.

55:16.000 --> 55:21.000
Well, how do you win across the people, the elderly folks that like Wii Sports Bowling?

55:21.000 --> 55:24.000
You show them the voodoo magic that is TV on a thing that's not the TV.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
Holy crap, how did my TV get on this little piece of plastic?

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
It says black magic. I'm buying one.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
And then they bowl it, drop it, and...

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
Are you a wizard?

55:34.000 --> 55:37.000
Actually, in this case, it keeps working if they were to bowl that little controller.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Unless they like break off, snap off the screen.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
No, no, I can't connect anymore.

55:41.000 --> 55:45.000
I don't like this camera on this thing. I think it's going to steal my identity.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
That's an old...

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
I could see that.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
I've gotten that before.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
Have you really?

55:51.000 --> 55:57.000
Yeah, not camera specifically, but my name's on a website because I'm in a play.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Is there any problem with that?

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
That's why my mom won't join Facebook.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
I asked my mom. I asked my mom.

56:03.000 --> 56:07.000
My mom is on Twitter, and I'm not allowed to give out her Twitter handle or she will murder me.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
But my mom has always said like...

56:09.000 --> 56:15.000
And she's only on Twitter because she wants to follow Cher, Kathy Griffin, Barack Obama, and Rosie O'Donnell.

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
No Oprah?

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
Not yet. She probably just hasn't thought of that one.

56:18.000 --> 56:22.000
But anyway, she follows like four people, and then me. She stalks me on Twitter.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
But anyway, what was I really going to say?

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
Oh yes, my mom will not join Facebook, and her thing always is,

56:27.000 --> 56:31.000
Rob, I don't need to join Facebook.

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
People have their identities stolen on Facebook, Rob.

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
And no one wants to see my face.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
That's her line. No one wants to see my face.

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
My face isn't on Facebook. At least not my profile picture.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
There you go.

56:43.000 --> 56:47.000
People have their identities stolen because they gave their card to someone, which you do on a daily freaking basis.

56:47.000 --> 56:53.000
People get their identities stolen from a waiter at a restaurant who is not somebody that the restaurant probably wants representing them.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
But unfortunately shit happens.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
So, you know, you just gotta be careful.

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
Alright, let's move on with some more news, shall we?

57:00.000 --> 57:06.000
Talking about something else that was, you know, we didn't get a whole lot of gaming news out of CES this year.

57:06.000 --> 57:09.000
But there was a couple things here and there.

57:09.000 --> 57:15.000
And this was something that was gaining a lot of esteem, if you will, the talk at CES.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
It's Valve Steam Box.

57:17.000 --> 57:21.000
And it was confirmed by Gabe Newell that the Steam Box will run Linux.

57:21.000 --> 57:27.000
The Steam Box, of course, is a little PC in a box that's basically designed to be hooked up to the computer.

57:27.000 --> 57:32.000
It's basically out there to compete with the consoles, but it's a PC, it's Steam, and it will be Linux.

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
And this is the one from Valve.

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
From Valve. The official one from Valve.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.000
Yes.

57:40.000 --> 57:44.000
By the way, that box itself, not supposed to hit in 2013.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
That kind of surprises me.

57:46.000 --> 57:49.000
Why not strike now when all this stuff is a big hit?

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
I don't get what's so freaking difficult about this.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Like, what do they have planned for this?

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
I'm going back to an earlier prediction, by the way.

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
I am going back to an earlier prediction I had and I'm sticking by it.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Half-Life 3, when the Steam Box happens.

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
Probably.

58:01.000 --> 58:02.000
Why not?

58:02.000 --> 58:06.000
And people who have the Steam Box will get Half-Life 3 first.

58:06.000 --> 58:11.000
And watch that thing just cut the Ouya off of the kneecaps. Watch. Watch.

58:11.000 --> 58:14.000
There's a reason why it's not dropping this year.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Compatibility.

58:16.000 --> 58:19.000
Oh, because of Linux compatibility. They're waiting for more of the games.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
They need more developers to jump on.

58:21.000 --> 58:25.000
That's why Steam Linux is coming to Linux systems first.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Because they need to have that library base.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
They need it to be as successful as possible because when that thing drops,

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Why can't I play Mass Effect on there?

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Why can't I play World of Goo on there?

58:33.000 --> 58:36.000
Why can't I play Toki, Tory, Limbo?

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
Anyways.

58:37.000 --> 58:41.000
Well, how about a comment from Ben Krasnow, who is an electrical engineer with Valve.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Although I thought that's weird because I thought Valve people didn't have titles,

58:43.000 --> 58:47.000
but maybe that's just what's on his resume if you looked at his LinkedIn or something.

58:47.000 --> 58:52.000
Quote, With regards to the Steam Box news, there's been a lot of things stated in media which I didn't say.

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
For example, it's true that we are working on getting Steam into the living room

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
and are planning for a hardware box,

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
but we have no current plans to announce anything in 2013.

59:00.000 --> 59:03.000
So the Linux thing may end up being something...

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
The thing to draw from this, we're hearing about the Linux thing now,

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
but that may actually end up not being the case.

59:08.000 --> 59:13.000
Maybe it's running Linux now, but who knows what's going to happen.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Because it can't run Windows 8.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
That would look really weird.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Well, it can't run Windows period.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
It can't run Mac OS, so why wouldn't it run Linux?

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Mac OS like iOS. Wow.

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
It could run a modified version of Linux.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Yeah, anything like...

59:28.000 --> 59:31.000
They may put together the Steam OS.

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
The Steam OS, which is going to be a Linux kernel,

59:34.000 --> 59:38.000
their own different base utilities, whatever they need to do.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Call it Linux, call it not.

59:40.000 --> 59:44.000
Call it not Linux because it's proprietary.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
I don't know. What a big surprise.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
It's going to be based on the biggest open platform in the world.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Well, speaking of open platforms,

59:51.000 --> 59:54.000
Gabe Newell apparently looking at the Steam Box

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
as being something, or Steam in general,

59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000
as being something that is a very user-generated paradise.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Maybe taking a cue from GitHub. Who knows?

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Our view has always been...

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Wow, nice leap.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Yeah, nice.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Our view has always been that we should build tools for customers

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
and tools for partners.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
An editorial filter is fine,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
but there should be a bunch of editorial filters.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
The backend services should be network APIs that anybody can use.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
On the consumer side, anybody should be able to put up a store

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
that hooks into those services.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Some people will create team stores.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Some people will create Sony stores.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Some people will create stores with only games that they think meet their quality bar.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Somebody is going to create a store that says,

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
these are the worst games on Steam.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
So that's an example of where our thinking is leading us right now.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Very interesting.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Four letters.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.000
H-T-T-P.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Because the web is something that...

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Or what? What's the point you're making with that?

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Because that's become the universal communication mechanism.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
And let somebody do whatever the hell they want

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
and then interconnect it and host it

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
and make it available just by pointing to a different location

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000
and boom, the freedom of the internet and the open platform and hoorah.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
I don't want to be dismissive about it

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
because really it is the best thing to come to computing ever

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
besides computing existing in the first place.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.000
But it's just an interesting thing they're banking on, I guess.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I don't know. I don't really have a way to summarize it.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000
It's just funny that Steam has come from store to meta store

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000
and opening it all up, but there's still the linchpin holding it all together.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
I don't know. I feel like I'm still missing one last detail

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
that makes this whole narrative of everything Steam is doing

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.000
over the next three years to make sense.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Do you think the Steam box is going to be too late?

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Oh, hell no.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
No, not even a little bit.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
It's going to be a significant player, period.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
That's all there is to say about it.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000
I don't think it really matters if it's too late.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Yeah, because there's other Half-Life 3s on it.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Well, I don't think they're really going to necessarily put Half-Life 3

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
exclusive to the Steam box or anything like that,

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
but I think that it may launch with it or something.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
And there's other third-party manufacturers of this stuff,

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.000
so if you don't like the configuration of running Linux or anything like that,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
that probably wouldn't be something I'd be interested in.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000
I don't know. I just don't really want to run Linux.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
What about Linux Mint?

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Could Jamie get her precious Linux Mint on a Steam box, you think?

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Probably.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Why not? I can get Linux Mint on a USB drive.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000
If you can get Linux on a toaster, Rob, Mint will run on anything.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Here's what I would like to see.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.000
I would like to see more apps coming to Steam big picture mode,

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000
like, for example, Netflix and Hulu and that kind of stuff,

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
because right now that's the thing.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000
I wanted to build a PC that has this kind of cool interface

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
like the Xbox 360 and stuff,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000
and big picture mode definitely works for that stuff,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
and I know there's workarounds that you can do.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000
You can trick it into getting external programs to run it,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
but I'm talking about something that's actually in Steam big picture mode

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000
without having to do some workarounds and stuff.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
That would be pretty awesome, so that I can get all that stuff in there,

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
because that's really what I'm looking for,

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
is just watch TV stuff, play games,

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000
run it on a PC because things will look better.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
All right, let's move on with more news,

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
because there was news this week that had nothing to do with new fangled consoles

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
and new boxes and things,

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
but news about the good old consoles that are out now, right, Jamie?

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Yeah, some Pokemans.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Pokemon.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000
So Nintendo announced that Pokemon X and Pokemon Y

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
are going to be on the Nintendo 3DS,

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
and they should be out later this October.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Why are we thinking that far ahead, man?

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000
But it just makes me wonder if you get all chick Pokemon in one

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000
and all dude Pokemon in the other, because they're XY.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Even if Pokemon had XY chromosomes, I'm just saying.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:12.000
No, I think it has something to do with the way the final bosses are named or something.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Well, at any rate, they're actually saying that it's not a reboot,

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
it's just an evolution of the franchise,

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
and Game Freak has basically been working their ass off trying to get it out.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.000
The quote is saying that there has never been a conscious decision to reboot.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000
There's always been an evolution of the look and feel.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
No one gives a shit.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
So their Pikachu has evolved into a Raichu.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Yeah, their Pikachu is like a Pikachuer.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Their Wubachu has evolved into a Dubstepachu.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
That's never going to get old.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Never ever.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
And that's the sound that Pokemon still make in the games today, by the way.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000
They never learned how to say their names like they did in the cartoon,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.000
but you go like, you know, Ho Monkey, I choose you, and it goes...

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000
The best thing that the newer Pokemon games have ever given is,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
X, use the Pester Ball. It's super effective.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000
It's super effective.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Are you excited about Pokemon X and Y?

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
No.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Will you give it another chance?

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
No.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.000
I saw the little trailer video, and first things first about the trailer video.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Fennekin, totally adorable.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Have you seen Fennekin?

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
No.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Let me put it this way.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
DeviantArt, like, jizzed in their pants.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
DeviantArt pisses me off.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Why does DeviantArt piss you off?

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Besides the royalty thing.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Okay.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
I'm talking the community.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Don't bring up that crap about the royalties.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
I don't care about that.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
The community and all that.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Tumblr blew up.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
The royalty thing is...

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Oh God.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000
No, and actually, there are a lot of people who get their panties in a wad on DeviantArt these days,

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000
so I'm just completely kind of done, even though I did post something on there.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Done.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
So, wait a minute. You're done with DeviantArt, but you just posted there the other day?

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Yeah, because I actually use...

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.000
I pay for my DeviantArt account to host my portfolio.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
I guess that's fair.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
All right, look, look.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000
I got to show you this in the little trailer, although I'm sure I'm going to get hit with an ad here,

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:24.000
but I got to show you in this trailer the Fennekin, because Fennekin's super adorable.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
And finally, the game looks different.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:34.000
It's not that same sprite-based thing we've seen since the original freaking games.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000
It is like what you would expect to see on a 3DS.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
And Pikachu's still in it.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Pikachu!

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Okay, so, you know, it's like, yay, we're going to take over the world one little pocket monster at a time.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:00.000
But see, now it's actually like what a game from this year should look like, right?

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Okay, now that actually does look kind of fun, except I don't have a 3DS.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
And...

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
However, the PokÃ©mon all look retarded.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Okay, that's Chespin. He looks cute, right?

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000
No.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:19.000
And look at the battles! The battles look like a freaking Dragon Quest game, or something.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
How adorable is Fennekin?

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Okay, Fennekin is cute.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
See? See? He's like that's sassy.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
But only because it looks like Eevee.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Who put a fire fox in this game?

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Oh, he's so cute.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
And then that is, I don't know, Froakie.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
That looks disgusting.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
What's that shit on its nose?

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Are those glasses?

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
No, it's big snot bubbles.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000
That's what it is, he's blowing snot on whatever that raccoon thing is.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
And then Psyduck.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Psyduck is like the big joke of the series.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
No, that's Psyduck.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Psy.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000
So, tell me, here's the little, like, uber PokÃ©mon at the end, or whatever.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Is his name Boner?

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Ryze giving me the commentary.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
No, Rob, that one's Y.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
That one's X.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
You studied this trailer, you did your homework, right?

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
And the secret one is Boner.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I actually haven't, just saw somebody post it on my Facebook.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
What's up with that peacock deer? That was really weird.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I will probably give these...

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
So doesn't that, like, didn't that...

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Like, yeah, you go, okay, new PokÃ©mon game, yeah, whoopty shit, I've seen this before.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
But then you look at that trailer and you go, they finally fuckin' changed it.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000
I can do this, this looks good.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I will give this game a shot again.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Welcome to 2013, Nintendo.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
The same argument I made for Diamond and Pearl for the DS, I think the 3DS.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.000
And I hope Nintendo's giving a shit about online and modern technology

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000
and the things that they're actually continuing to build into their new systems.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
I'll give this a shot.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Does that mean you'll play it for two hours this time?

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
No, two and a half.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Two and a half.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Okay.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
It's an improvement, dammit.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
ActDeft in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000
dares to challenge Jamie, saying Magikarp is the big joke of the series.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Magikarp is...

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
What I said.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Psyduck was more the joke in the cartoons.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000
That's what, whatever, I don't care, it's PokÃ©mon.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
GameGuru, bringing logic into this argument, saying,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000
well, PokÃ©mon had to update to polygons to support 3D, so they couldn't use sprites anymore.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
GameGuru, you haven't played those NES classics.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000
They'll...

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Where they just put the different, like, sprite layers on different 3D planes.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Like, they could have done cheap-ass 3D if they wanted to.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
But I'm glad they didn't.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
They're finally doing the right thing.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
All right, let's move on with more news.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Loki.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:53.000
All right, so there is a neat little piece of technology that they showed off at...

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.000
I don't know if it was at CES, or it was just something that they showed off during CES,

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:07.000
but it is this brand-new thing called the Microsoft IllumiRoom.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.000
And what the IllumiRoom demo was is basically this...

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Kind of a combination of a projector and Kinect built in so that it senses the geometry of your room

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
and then extends your gameplay field beyond the TV.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000
And it could be supplemental stuff like, you know, they'll have...

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
You'll be racing in a game or something like that,

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.000
and the lighting effects from, like, cars driving by at night or something like that

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000
cast shadows on stuff that's in your room.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Or, you know, snow when you're walking through snow.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Or, you know, even, like, geometry for first-person shooters and that kind of thing.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Now, what's interesting about this is this is something we talked about before.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Not necessarily the IllumiRoom thing, but the kind of loss of hinting at it.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Like, for example, there's the whole patent back in September that, you know, kind of showed us this thing anyways,

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:06.000
saying that, you know, they have a patent to use, I guess, some sort of 3D glasses with this

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.000
and even maybe, you know, the Kinect and stuff like that.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
I don't think necessarily that this is going to work with the Kinect

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
because the way the projector works on this...

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:24.000
And this is similar to what they had in their Microsoft Home of the Future display,

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
which I think is on their campus.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
And this is what I've kind of alluded to before,

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000
where they showed off these different displays that are built into...

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Not necessarily built into the walls, but they are projected onto the walls.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:43.000
So they have, like, for example, this, like, kids' room that will have this...

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Fictional teenage girls, you know, favorite bands.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
You know, the posters on the wall are all dynamic.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
You know, it's showing her bands and stuff.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.000
And then, like, say, oh, Grandma's coming over today and they're going to stay in your room.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:00.000
And then the whole motif just changes completely to, you know, whoever's using it.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Like, they have a window that shows, you know, her dog at home on a security camera or something like that.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
So, basically, in this...

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:14.000
And they also have some projects that they've done with augmentive projectors,

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000
where you can actually use your shadows to control stuff like Kinect,

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000
where, you know, you have, you know, particles that you're moving your hand

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000
and your shadow's, like, picking them up and you can actually pick stuff up with your fingers,

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000
which is kind of neat.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
So I see that kind of stuff happening.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Now, whether is this going to be included in the next Xbox?

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
I think, if anything, this will be an accessory for the next Xbox.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:42.000
I don't think this is something that they can just throw in there because the setup is quite extensive.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:50.000
I mean, you're going to need the system, your TV, and you're going to mount a projector to your ceiling somehow,

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
or multiple projectors.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
So it'll be a little interesting how they do that.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000
But pretty cool tech demo that they show there.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Pretty cool and pretty non-existent in the end.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Yeah, it's one of those things where I'm like, is this snake oil?

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Like, the video is pretty impressive, the video that's floating around out there.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Yeah, well, it's a neat concept.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000
It's not, I mean, I wouldn't say it's snake oil, but they have, you know, a working prototype,

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000
like, even if they show this, you know, Home of the Future type thing, this Microsoft thing.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Well, what about, I don't live in the Home of the Future, Loki.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.000
They have a working prototype in a 100% Taylor setup.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I live in the Home of the Poor People Past.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000
I'm wondering, though, I'm wondering just basically how much this would cost,

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
because projectors aren't cheap.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And so, I mean, this would be cool technology if this is something that they launch with the system,

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
that you're immersed in your whole room.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000
I mean, that would be pretty cool.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Projectors can come at all sorts of levels.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Like, yes, a high quality projector isn't cheap,

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:53.000
but you can get a little thing that projects shadow puppets on the wall for your kids when they sleep for 20 bucks.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000
So, I mean, what is the level of projection technology in this thing?

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
It's somewhere in the middle, probably.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000
But I don't think it's going to be built into the next Xbox. I'm with you.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000
I think it's some type of accessory.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Well, they were even talking about, like, the tracking and stuff, better 3D modeling and capture and stuff.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Like, one of the things they said with the Kinect that they were going to change is that they're going to have,

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:21.000
instead of having that IR field just in one spot, it's going to sweep the room,

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000
so that you get a better idea of the geometry of the room, which is kind of cool.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:30.000
And this is one of their other projects, their Kinect Track project, that they were going to...

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000
They said the six degrees of freedom, or a six DOF tracker,

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:41.000
which allows real-time, low-cost pose estimation using our only commodity hardware.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:47.000
And, I don't know, it sounds interesting, but we'll see how they implement this.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000
I mean, like I said, it looked pretty exciting, that whole, like, Home of the Future thing and how they have...

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Because a lot of it was that they have some other technology that they call, like, Lightbox or something like that.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Basically, a lot of these displays that are projected from, you know, the ceiling and stuff like that.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
So, like, oh, I'm going to put this thing on the charger,

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000
and you see, like, a little HUD kind of appear next to whatever your device is,

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000
giving you information and the texture, you know, touching the surfaces and stuff.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:20.000
It's basically putting the display for your computer on any object or wall or whatever.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.000
So, it could be cool, and that would be also kind of neat if you think about it.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Like, imagine, you know, playing, like, Forza or something like that,

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:35.000
and then you have all, you know, you could have maps and all sorts of HUD equipment, you know, outside of the TV.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:39.000
But that time, though, if you're going to have all that stuff outside of the screen,

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000
you might as well just use the projector as your display in the first place.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Raginator in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com asks,

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Now the question is, how many steps away from Star Trek's holodeck is this projector?

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.000
We're getting closer. Now it's making the whole room show imagery. It's closer.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
They have technology that's in another one of their videos,

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000
because they have this whole research thing that they do a bunch of, like, future tech stuff.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:08.000
They have a 3D display that is pretty interesting. It can be viewed from 360 degrees.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000
So, you can't touch it yet, but we're getting there.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
We're getting there.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000
We're getting there.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:22.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, swim.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Alright, well, moving on for time issues. This sounds awesome. I'm looking forward to more information on it.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:36.000
I hope it's something that actually works, because the concept sounds great and could really enhance gaming.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Moving on, though, you know, a story that we've really kept an eye on,

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:46.000
and everybody has in the game industry this week, is the fallout from the tragedy last month in Connecticut.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:51.000
And I'm sure you guys all heard in the news about the gaming companies that were actually meeting with Joe Biden this week.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.000
There was even some controversy around that. Should they even be meeting with Joe Biden?

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Because is meeting with him admitting that they are part of the problem?

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Well, here's the reality, guys. I mean, no matter where you stand on that issue,

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:09.000
a survey company named Survey USA actually polled a bunch of parents.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:16.000
I don't know exactly what the qualifications were for this survey, but I guess it was all 50 states in the US, January 4th and 5th,

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.000
just over 1,000 parents who have children under the age of 18 living at home.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:27.000
89% of parents believe that violence in today's video games is a problem.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:34.000
75% believe that violence in video games contributes to violent behavior. 75%.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:42.000
3 out of 4. That is a line that transcends Democrat and Republican, and any of that.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:52.000
That is a vast majority. That's the reality. 75% of parents believe that violence in video games contributes to violent behavior.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Now, what I would be curious to know is, does that mean that they take an active role in what their kids should and should not play?

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
I wonder if the survey went to that.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Well, here's an example, and I know way too many. I'm not saying that any parent in this room does this,

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000
because I know you probably don't, really.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:24.000
There are some people who I know who have kids who really just let their kids sit unregulated and watch whatever they want to

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000
and play whatever they want to, and aren't even in the same room when they're playing a game.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:40.000
And of course, I don't think that it's a matter necessarily of the game or the show that's being influenced.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000
It's a matter of neglect being the influence, because the kid's going to act out when they're not getting the attention they need.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Let me run down some of the other stats, because Jamie, I'm really curious what you think about some of this.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:59.000
93% of parents, damn near all parents, nationwide say lack of supervision for children contributes to violence.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Agreed.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:05.000
92% of parents nationwide say bullying contributes to violence.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Very much agreed.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:12.000
86% of parents nationwide say crime in day-to-day life contributes.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
That depends.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:20.000
See, yes, because the news shows it is where I'm going with that.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.000
See, my point is that it's media is the contributor.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:30.000
How many people think that that horrible gunman, and I won't say his name,

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:37.000
how many people think that that horrible gunman did what he did so that he could go out with all the publicity?

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Because if he wanted to end it all, he could have done it in a different way.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000
But he did it in a way that was meant to get attention.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:51.000
I think he did it because his mother works there.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:59.000
I mean, I can't clearly put myself in that kind of mindset because I'm not a psychopath or sociopath,

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:07.000
but he went to the school that his mother taught at and shot her students and then her.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000
So that seems more of a big revenge thing.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Just because I want to spare you the males.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Technically, the mother was killed, then he went to the school.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Okay. But I think it's related.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:27.000
It's like, oh, she's gone, let's fuck up everything that meant something to her, and then we're done.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
I don't want to talk about him anymore.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000
But my point is I don't know how much of the media might have had something to do with that,

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
other than it gave it to him as an option.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.000
77% of parents nationwide say violence in TV and movies contributes.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.000
So, interesting enough, I mean, to be fair, as much as we're sitting here going,

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:52.000
oh my gosh, 75%, that is 2% lower than the number of parents who say TV and movies contributes.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:57.000
So, at least everybody's getting blamed equally, I guess.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:02.000
64% say violent toys contribute.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Here's what surprised me.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:10.000
75%, we already established, believe that violence in video games contributes.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Guess what got the exact same percentage?

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Also at 75%, exact same, easy access to guns contributes to violence.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Yeah.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.000
But on the exact same level as video games?

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Well, again, video games are the scapegoat.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:42.000
We have tons of research, psychiatric data, and statistics that show video games are not the responsible thing.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I think when you put a combination of preexisting mental conditions,

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:55.000
when you throw in easy access to weaponry, and when you throw in a few other external factors,

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:00.000
like, for example, the guy here in California who was bullied,

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:08.000
and he shot one of his bullies and got talked out of it, that's definitely a contributing factor.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000
I need to get this out there because the chat room is lighting up on this.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.000
And again, we don't want the podcast listeners sitting there going,

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
I'm going to write an email because they're wrong.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Folks in chat all over the place saying that it was not, she didn't work at the school.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
The media reported that, but the media fucked up a lot of the information at first.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Okay, fine.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000
But I think there was some type of connection between him and the school,

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
whether it was that he went there or something, I don't know.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
But anyway, you know.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Regardless, I think that maybe you might not have gotten the idea if it hadn't been something so publicized, you know.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:49.000
He's sick. We can all agree on that. Very, very, very sick.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Apparently, those surveyed were shown a video for Hitman Absolution.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:00.000
84% said that advertisement was inappropriate to show on TV at a time when children are watching.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Well, I'd actually kind of agree with that. You don't show a commercial like that during, you know, the Smurfs.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Not shown during the time when they were watching TV.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Yeah, that's true. That's right. They're not shown.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Once again, though.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Unless parents let their kids watch South Park unattended, which is an M-rated show.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Once again, though, I think, though, that a lot of this is just you're asking someone's opinion on this doesn't mean that they're right.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000
And doesn't mean they're educated on that stuff, too.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:41.000
I mean, you know, they're all, I think, violence. I think violence in video games, you know, is what's causing these people to be violent or whatever.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Well, you can think that. Just like you can think that, you know, because this person doesn't believe in a certain, you know, godly entity that they're violent.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Or, you know, because this person is a homosexual, they're violent. Or because this person is a certain race, they're violent.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:03.000
You know, you can think all these things, but it doesn't necessarily mean that any of this is correct.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:15.000
So, I mean, I don't know. I just, once again, we're just probably going to see more legislature with, you know, video games because everyone's believing now that video games are violent because the media told them.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:23.000
And oddly enough, you know, they question all this other stuff, but they don't question media, which makes no sense whatsoever. But fine.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Let me close with this comment, and then I want to move on from SSJ100, Matt.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:39.000
People look for answers to understand tragedy. They want a finger to point at because the fact of the matter is people are terrified of the fact that people could do something so horrible for no reason than just because.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000
I guess it's scapegoat.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Uh, one other story as a follow-up to this. And, you know, when this all first happened, I said, watch out because an angry mob is coming.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Guess what happened this week?

01:24:52.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Massachusetts, the state, pulled video games out of state-operated rest stops. Not all video games, but light gun games.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Time crisis. Removed. Lethal enforcers. Gone.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
House of the Dead.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000
I don't know if anybody had House of the Dead in the first place.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
But Lethal Enforcers first, really?

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Time crisis and Beachhead 2000 was another one. Beachhead 2000.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
That's not a light gun game.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:29.000
What a pretentious fucking game Beachhead 2000 was in many ways. Let's be real. But still, apparently...

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Too hot for Massachusetts.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Which version of Beachhead 2000?

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000
The one with that giant helmet.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Remember they also had the one where, at Golf Land, they had the one where you can actually sit inside the thing that's moving around?

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Oh, the Sudoji or whatever that thing was called? The Sumo.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Sumo. Sumo. That was it.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Yeah. Was it the Sumo version?

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Nah, I doubt it. I doubt it.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Fine. You know what? Yeah. Cool. That's your prerogative. You can do whatever the hell you want.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Because, you know what? It's your arcade. You can make those decisions.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000
I don't even know why it was a news story. Other than, oh, this happened, so let's make it into a story.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:12.000
But, like, seriously, if you don't like fighting games, if people are bullying each other and you take fighting games out of your arcade, that's your own choice.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Did they replace it with non-violent ticket games? Because I'd like to know if that actually happened.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:25.000
The games that remained. Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, and Cruis'n Exotica at one point. Like, Cruis'n World. It's not a porn game. It's like the Cruis'n race games. Remember that?

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Cruis'n Exotica. I mean, that's very violent. Can't you hit things? I mean, remember, Cruis'n USA, you can, like, explode here.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.000
And you can drive a school bus irresponsibly.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Can drive over 100 miles an hour, which doesn't happen in the States, except on race tracks.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Richard Davey, the State Secretary of Transportation in Massachusetts. Here's a quote.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Bottom line is, I think there isn't a person who doesn't believe that there isn't too much violence in our society, and games can glorify that.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:01.000
A video game in a public space could be used by anybody of any age.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:10.000
I think there isn't a person who doesn't believe that there isn't too much violence in our society, and games can glorify that.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.000
There is not one person who disagrees, apparently.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:19.000
My brain can't parse the first half of that sentence. It's like a triple negative to make the point.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Listen to this quote carefully one more time. Third time's the charm.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Bottom line is, I think there isn't a person who doesn't believe that there isn't too much violence in our society, and games can glorify that.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
It's a positive, because it's pretty negative.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:43.000
A person does not exist who doesn't believe that there isn't too much violence.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:51.000
So, I think it should be that, and he doesn't think that those people don't exist.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:28:00.000
So, if I were going to rephrase that, I think what he intends is, I think most people believe there's too much violence in our society.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Wouldn't that have been easier?

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
By the way, I don't think there's enough violence.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.000
He would have learned better grammar if he, you know, wasn't playing those violent video games.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
They're the blame.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Not playing violent video games leads to bad grammar.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:19.000
I want to make the most bloody grammar game ever. That'd be awesome.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.000
I don't know. Bloody...

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.000
I can't think of a...

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Hunt Peck Mame, the game.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:36.000
According to Jason in our chatroom, Jason, you're talking in our chatroom, apparently that quote was, quote-ception.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Negative-ception. I have no idea. It just hurt my head to try to deal with.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:51.000
There isn't a person who doesn't believe that there isn't too much violence.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
We get it! We get it!

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Alright, let's move on. More news.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Dark Sakura, one more story and then the release dates.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
DONG!

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:13.000
UK University is trying to use the Kinect to see if it will help stroke victims.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:19.000
I couldn't res- I'll put it away. I'll put it away. I will put it away.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:23.000
I'm gonna take that gong and shove it so far up your ass.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.000
I don't know, this is kind of payback for all the vuvuzelas up there.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.000
That is true. She was pretty terrible with that, wasn't she?

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.000
I'm gonna shove that gong so far up your ass that you burp brass.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Technically, I don't think it's a gong. Wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.000
So you're gonna put brass in my ass to give me brassy gas?

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Alright, seriously, read the fucking story. I'm gonna walk away.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000
I would much rather have dubstep bird.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Can we remix those together?

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
You have to add a reverb in it to make it go-

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:59.000
They need to have a bird that does the Inception sound.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:07.000
If you think about it, if you think about it, it probably exists on the internet somewhere.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Inception bird?

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.000
No, dubstep Inception HD here.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
That actually hurts.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:30.000
And I'm not meaning that in an exaggerating kind of way, it actually hurts.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Alright, just please read the story.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Nottingham Trent University has been awarded a 347,000 pound grant to build a prototype that will use Kinect for feedback to patients and to their doctors.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:57.000
These are for stroke victims. They're wanting to use the system to detect and track asymmetries on the patient's face.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:02.000
That means mouth, eyes, cheeks, like for facial exercises.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:09.000
I think it's for people who end up with ticks after strokes or being paralyzed.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:30.000
And this is actually being headed, looks like, by Dr. Philip Breeden, who is basically saying that the system is going to use those exercises and see how successful they are with that feedback provided by the Kinect system.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
So, pretty good.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:43.000
I'm glad to hear a story about gaming things and things that were done for gaming doing good after those past couple stories we had.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Agreed. And I mean, you really have to think about it.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Like, for example, they had all those PlayStations put together to calculate, you know, cures.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:03.000
They had, you know, now this technology with Kinect, they've got lots of cognitive therapy exercises that are being done with video games.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:10.000
And I think that there's too much negative focus being put on a lot of.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.000
They need to have more stuff like this go out in public. People go,

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Wouldn't that be nice?

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:20.000
But people are looking for their scapegoat and they don't want to see anything good come out of it, so fuck them.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Quick side story about the Kinect.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Went to a New Year's party. Couple friends of mine that have a little band, little two-piece keyboard chiptune off of Game Boy and live drum segments.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.000
A pretty good show. Just a tiny little house party for New Year's.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:45.000
And one of their friends created this very quick little visualization demo that uses the Kinect to, you know, it uses the 3D, the point field,

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:50.000
all of the features of the Kinect to create this reactive visualization.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:58.000
He implemented the ability to take the object and manipulate it in 3D space as far as the output is concerned.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:07.000
And then obviously you have control of the Kinect's tilt and how much of the space it actually, it will actually display.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:15.000
For all of the grief that I've given Kinect, as far as what it's capable of doing and representing, it's actually really good.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:23.000
This kind of thing, I wouldn't think that it'd be applicable to the granularity of a face, but from the right distance, why not?

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:29.000
I really enjoy hearing about these applications that are practical and promising at the same time.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Well, we've heard about Kinect being used by doctors. I mean, maybe not like hooked up to an Xbox or anything, but like, you know, that technology in PCs, you know, pretty awesome.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:46.000
All right, let's move on. Travel around the world and check out maybe some more affordable video games coming to a store near you. We'll start in the U.S., Loki.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.000
This week is Devil May Cry on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Woo!

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000
That's it.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
First big release of the New Year, though, right?

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Hey, Anarchy Reigns came out last week.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that. That's right, that's right. Shame on me.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
I've been told I need to play that.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.000
The game with potentially Bayonetta if you bought it from GameStop.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Really?

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Yeah, only from GameStop.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Oh, how nice.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Thank you, Sega! Fuck you and your goddamn GameStop shit. You're going the route of Nintendo now.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:20.000
All right, let's go to the Xbox 360 releases in Japan.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Japan also gets Devil May Cry this week, kind of one of those rare multi-regions in the same week.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Also, a game called Heavy Fire Shattered Spear makes its way to Japan this week. Both those games out on the 17th.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, of course, as you can expect, Devil May Cry is out there as well.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Dream Seat Club Zero, special... it's not edition, they have EDP on or something. They do a little stylization, I think, when that comes out this week on the PS3.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Blade Storm, the Hundred Years War gets a price reduction. Little Big Planet Karting hadn't come out in Japan until now.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000
It's finally coming out this week. With that comes the Move Racing Wheel.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:03.000
And some games moving into the best series, including Sengoku Musou 3, Empires.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Because, you know, they love their Dynasty Warriors.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:15.000
On the Vita this week, WRC 3, Fia World Rally Championship is the lone release this week on the PlayStation Vita.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:23.000
On the Wii U, nothing until January 31st. It's pretty dry over there with new releases, just like it is here.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Nothing on the 3DS either, so Nintendo's really slowed down this time of year, but same story over here, I guess.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
How about the UK, Dark Sakura?

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Well, I would tell you if the site was actually loading.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Oh, wow.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Come on, you butt-head.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Yes, I said butt-head. I called a website a butt-head.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
I think I got it here. What's this?

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
No, no, no, it loaded.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:52.000
On the 15th we have Devil May Cry on the 16th Retro City Rampage.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.000
And, yeah, that's it.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Slim pickins no matter where you live, but it's gonna take a month for things to really ramp up again.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Devil May Cry is still a pretty big deal, so there you go.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys in the Classic Game of the Week. Loki.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:16.000
So, indie game developers are saying positive things about the Wii U eShop

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.000
as opposed to what they were saying with the WiiWare service.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Apparently, Gaijin Games, Mike Rouse and Alex Neuse were saying that

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:31.000
we don't know for sure, but it felt like it wasn't taken seriously by Nintendo.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:35.000
The desire for gamers to buy stuff digitally, and they're talking about, of course, the WiiWare service.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:42.000
However, they're saying literally everything was easier this time around on the eShop.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:50.000
What's more friendly right out of the starting gate is the Wii U is developed for people to have an eShop

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000
to spend their money in and buy games easily.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:59.000
So, I don't know. I mean, cool that they're doing some more stuff.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.000
I mean, I don't know how this compares to, say, other platforms,

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.000
but at least they're doing better than they were before.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:13.000
I mean, that's like, I don't know, maybe going to the dollar store instead of Kmart.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:18.000
I mean, I don't know if that's, you know, oh, well, it's not as crappy as Kmart,

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.000
but it's still pretty crappy, but it's not as crappy.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.000
So, I don't know how it really compares.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:31.000
I'm still encouraged by some of these early things I'm hearing about the Wii U eShop

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
and that maybe we're going to see some really cool things on it.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000
I don't know. Do these indie developers get some preview codes

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:40.000
so they can get them sent out for reviews, unlike the Xbox indie games?

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Maybe. I don't know. I don't get those types of reviews, so I don't know.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.000
But I can tell you, I'm looking forward to the Zen pinballs coming out on the Wii U,

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:52.000
and that looks to be really cool, because they've got a Plants vs. Zombies table.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
That would be neat.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Anyhow, speaking of Nintendo, one of the big stories from last year

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.000
was that Nintendo Power shut down after all these years.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Well, the spirit of sorts lives on with Nintendo Force Magazine.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:11.000
It is a new product from a group of Nintendo-focused journalists and artists.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Don't read into that that it was like the old Nintendo Power team,

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000
because that's not the case.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.000
It's other types of journalists and fans from around the Internet.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000
They have released Nintendo Force Magazine.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Here's the thing, though. It's not your typical magazine.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:34.000
It is one that you can get in PDF form for $5, or you can get a collectible print for $18.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.000
I'm assuming, I'm left to assume, maybe Dark Soccer knows more about this stuff than I do,

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.000
but I'm left to assume that probably because there isn't a huge demand for this,

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:46.000
like it's not an international magazine or whatever, it's something that's more homegrown,

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:51.000
to kind of print these in a much smaller supply probably costs a little more money,

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:56.000
and that's why it's going to cost you $18 to get an actual printed copy version of this.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.000
In the first issue, though, Fire Emblem Awakening and Mutant Mudds Deluxe,

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.000
which is apparently a thing on 3DS or Wii U coming soon.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
So there you go.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.000
All right, let's travel to a simpler time in games.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Let's go back to a time when, like, Nintendo Power was still around.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:19.000
It's the classic game of the week where Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault,

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:25.000
and she's going to find a game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful brats, put down your Wii Us.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
And mow my lawn.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Mow my lawn, and then maybe I'll let you play this game.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Maybe you'll go get a phosphate.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:36.000
This game isn't super old, but believe it or not, it's getting old.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Yeah, that's why I picked it.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
What is the classic game of the week, Dark Cyra?

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Silent Hill 3.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Because I've done Silent Hill 2, but I haven't done my favorite, so now I'm doing my favorite.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Um, yeah, I picked the perfect thing to start off with, didn't I?

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
At least it wasn't bong.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.000
At any rate, Silent Hill 3 was done by Konami.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
We all know this.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Developed by Team Silent.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.000
And it came out in May 2003.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Now that it's, well, not quite ten years old, but getting up to ten years old,

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:15.000
so, um, I can do it.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:21.000
There was also a port to Windows done that I heard was absolutely wretched and haven't played yet.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.000
And then a high def version that came out in 2012, but it's shit.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.000
So it's 17 years after the original Silent Hill.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Um, and basically he's raising Heather, who really isn't named Heather,

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:42.000
but she's going by that name, and she's got an interesting haircut and dyes her hair blonde.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.000
She also does very interesting coordination with her jacket.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:57.000
So in this one, like other Silent Hill games, there are different aspects to the game.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:01.000
There is combat, you have exploration, and you have puzzle solving.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:06.000
You know, as in little riddles to solve as you go through the game.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:12.000
And of course picking up maps and bonuses for doing certain things in the game the right way.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:16.000
You, um, can change the difficulty of your puzzles.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Um, they're pretty, pretty difficult though, some of them can be.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:29.000
And like even the really hard puzzle in that one requires that you know quite a bit of Shakespeare to solve.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:34.000
You also get unlockable weapons and costume, which my favorite is the magical girl costume,

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:40.000
where she does Heather beam, or as I say, has a beam, because even in the American version,

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:46.000
she still, she has a very thick Japanese accent for just that attack.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:57.000
So you start off in the game at the mall, and then Claudia finds out she's being stalked by a guy in a trench coat.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:01.000
And then she goes and finds her dad.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.000
I won't say what he's like, because if you haven't played it by now, he's dead.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:09.000
And then she goes into Silent Hill. Yay!

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:14.000
And there's like this whole plot to Rebirth of God.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:19.000
It has a lot to do, like I said, it's technically the sequel to the first Silent Hill.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
It continues that story.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:24.000
It has very, very interesting creatures in that game too.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:32.000
And there's also a dude named Vincent, who isn't as cool as Vincent Valentine, but I won't go there.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:36.000
So like I said, there's three endings. You have the normal ending.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:47.000
You have a possessed ending and the revenge ending, which the revenge ending is actually the UFO ending.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:52.000
That has the best Silent Hill song ever, Silent Hill no Uta.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Silent Hill, Silent Hill, anyway.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:01.000
I know I've done it as a fortune cookie before, but I'm not doing it tonight.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:12.000
So yeah, Silent Hill 3 is seriously my favorite of the Silent Hill games, because I love how much work went into it.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:17.000
There's actually a full documentary on the making of this game that you can find on YouTube.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Where they went all out for the voice acting.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:26.000
They went all out for face models for the rendering of the animations.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
It was really, really well done.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:36.000
And then there's also another note that it was influenced by Jacob's Ladder.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Lots of different facets from that and other horror stories were incorporated into the game as influences.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Like I was talking about the face models, they actually were drawn from references to real life actors and actresses so that they would look realistic.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:07.000
The original name for Heather was actually Helen, but she was renamed Heather for her voice actress.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:14.000
And she was modeled after a French actress, actually a couple of them, after Charlotte Gainsborough.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:20.000
And another one that's actually very familiar to us, Vanessa Paradis, who was married to Johnny Depp for a while.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:25.000
And did a very, very, actually a few really good songs.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:34.000
So yeah, there was also now that Silent Hill Revelation 3D, which we were supposed to go see and never did, was based off of Silent Hill 3.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
There's always Blu-Ray.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Yeah, the Blu-Ray's gotta be out really soon.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:43.000
I'm totally getting it. So yeah, there you go. Silent Hill 3.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:49.000
And the source game for one of my favorite songs in DDR Extreme US.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Oh, the...

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000
You're Not Here.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Yeah, I'm like, I can sing it, I don't know the name.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
It was really good, the video and everything else, really good chart.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.000
That was one of the better things to come out of Extreme US.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Not that that was a bad game, all things considered.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Minus the crappy disc wheel. It was a really, really good game.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
There is your classic game of the week.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
And classic DDR reference of the week.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Yes, exactly. We have DDR references coming up in part B tonight.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:19.000
So don't go anywhere. We've got more Orange Lounge Radio to come, including apparently a DDR reference.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Fugu question of the week, rapid fire news, your emails and your phone calls.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:26.000
All when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live with episode number 489 of our show for this January the 13th of 2013.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Myself, Loki and DarkSakura are joined in studio tonight with Jason and Rai, who are visiting Colorado as they have been.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:54.000
And Jason, of course, I always like to acknowledge that without Jason, we wouldn't have an OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:58.000
So thank you to Jason for all the work he does with that.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:06.000
During the break, usually we don't talk about the break music because we can't play it due to copyright reasons.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:09.000
But I've got to give a plug to this guy so the podcasters can sneak him out too.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Because that remix that we played was great.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
So please give this guy a plug here where everybody can hear it.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Aethernaut's original works are on Bandcamp.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Aethernaut.bandcamp.com.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Same username on Soundcloud.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.000
That remix is one since it's obviously not his originally.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.000
You can get that on Soundcloud.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Soundcloud.com slash Aethernaut.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Let me, for the sake of the podcasters, let me play just a clip here.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Because I can do clips.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Let me play a clip of his remix of the moon during the break that I was like, wow, this guy is like really cool.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.000
So what's that website again, the Bandcamp site, right?

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.000
His Bandcamp is Aethernaut.bandcamp.com.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.000
This song in particular, Soundcloud.com slash Aethernaut.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.000
A-E-T-H-E-R-N-A-U-T.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Correct.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Nice stuff.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Good times. Good pick.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
I should let you pick the break music every week.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Woo!

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Alright, or was that, or was that, who discovered Aethernaut, was that right?

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
It was basically mutual.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000
That's the right answer.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.000
We went to a Chiptune showcase, we were both there, and we were both like, fuck yeah, dude.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Alright, very good.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:21.000
And it was mine that I was playing while we were doing stuff before the show over here.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Yeah, she was the one that actually had music running.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
She got it introduced to me.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Yes.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Alright.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:28.000
She'll get credit for that one.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:29.000
You guys have good taste.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Alright, let's move on.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Rapid Fire news time.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Some quick news stories, starting off with Loki.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Alright, so this is kind of cool.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:39.000
They have this, they have this, they have this, they have this.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:47.000
They have this mod for Minecraft, and it allows someone to actually connect multiple worlds together.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Now, they have this before where you can create multiple kind of worlds in Minecraft, but this is actually unifying servers.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:06.000
And the guy that developed this, was it, I guess it's the MD5 proxy system, which is now called Bungee Cord, if you look for it on the bucket.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Basically, he has it set up now.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:14.000
He's got a server with a lobby that allows, you know, like 2,000 people in there.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:21.000
And instead of, you know, searching for Minecraft servers and stuff that might be full, you go in this lobby and you pick a server out of there.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:22.000
And you get all the information.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:27.000
So it's almost like an MMO now where you can hop in and out of these servers and go, like, with your friends.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Like, say, hey, you know, I'm going to go build on the VoG Minecraft server right now, and then let's hop out.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:37.000
We're going to go to a server that's running, like, the Hunger Games minigame stuff.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Or, hey, I want to run to a server that's doing, like, you know, survival or something like that instead of creative.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
And you can do that, which is pretty awesome.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.000
So it's out there.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Not something I'm going to run on the Minecraft or our Minecraft server because we have enough trouble filling up one server, let alone multiple servers.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
And our server is whitelist only, which is important.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:01.000
But I think that makes it very attractive to play on because you don't get griefers.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Because if any of our listeners turn into griefers, I will beat you.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.000
And also I log, you know, it's logging whatever you do.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.000
So we will find you.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.000
I dig holes.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Don't be afraid to have fun.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.000
I mean, you know, I have rules listed.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Come on.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:20.000
It's just like I'll let you do whatever as long as you don't fuck up someone else's shit.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:27.000
You know, just do I have a sign now in my little I don't even know where you are, so I haven't added yet.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
So I live in a prairie dog town.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Well, once I find you, I'll add you or I'll show you how to do it.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
I'll put nasty notes in front of your house.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
My house is underground.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Which means you'll have to log in and finish your house.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Well, I can make it snow in her house.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
No, because my house is underground.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:46.000
My house is covered.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
My doors are covered in glass.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Can I can I get lava to flow through her house?

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Oh, that's griefing.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
You can make it snow in her house, actually.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Ah, there we go.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
No snow in my house.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000
We're not going to.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.000
My house is going to be constantly evolving, which is why I'm building it underground.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.000
All right. So that's kind of cool.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:09.000
And then Sony is actually kind of following the footsteps of Microsoft,

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:14.000
and they're going to have a web based store for the Sony Entertainment Network.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.000
So you can actually buy stuff and, you know, download it.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.000
They're working on automatic downloading to go with that.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
But it's kind of cool that they're doing that.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:23.000
So you can browse.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Welcome to 2007 Sony.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:28.000
About fucking time.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:34.000
I mean, I guess I guess they had to scrap all their plans when they rebuilt the whole fucking PSN a few years ago.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.000
But Jesus.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:38.000
And then finally, there's another bundle that you might be interested in.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
This is called the free bundle.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:46.000
And basically, regardless of what you might want to pay for this bundle, it's free.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:50.000
And you can pick up five games from the free bundle dot com.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:56.000
And these games are Nitronic Rush, which is a cool survival driving game.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
A Bobo's Big Adventure.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Yes, that's right. A Bobo from...

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Downloaded it.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Yes, from Double Dragon.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:06.000
And also, let's see, Ascension.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.000
It's a side scroller horror game, a celestial mechanical.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:17.000
And see, that's, I guess, has some animation done by Super Crate Box, his Paul Veer.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:24.000
And then I'm Scared, which they say is a self professed Minecraft meets Slender game.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.000
I was looking at it. I didn't want it.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.000
But they're all free for a limited amount of time.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Were you scared?

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
No, I was apathetic.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:38.000
So the free bundle, in case, you know, the humble bundle is too expensive for you.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
You know what the free bundle needs more of?

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Because this game's free?

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Frog Fractions. Just saying.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Alright.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:48.000
And look, they added another game to the free bundle.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Now they have Treasure Adventure Island.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Or Treasure Venture Game.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
So, that's cool.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Go download it for free.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
And it's up for another 32 days.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Alright, well if you like to let video game consoles have an influence on your car buying purchases, then maybe this car is for you.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:10.000
It's an official Xbox 360 car from Volkswagen.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:11.000
That's right.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Oh, it's only available in Mexico, however.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Act EFT. There you go, buddy.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Buy it, send pictures, please.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Well, there's a little picture here. I mean, this is more of a render, but it actually has like the little Xbox stripe along the bottom and it's like that green color or what have you.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:36.000
If you buy this, by the way, should you buy the Volkswagen Xbox 360, you get an Xbox 360 with a copy of Forza 4. What a deal.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Wow, Forza from like, not 2012, but from the year before that.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Which I think is like a packing game now in some of their systems.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Earlier, somebody brought up Bayonetta, probably because you were talking about the anarchy reigns.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:58.000
But Bayonetta, a lot of demand for Bayonetta to show up on the Wii U eShop because of the fact that Bayonetta 2 is going to turn up on Wii U.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:05.000
And people aren't necessarily going to be familiar with it unless they had a 360 or a Playstation 3 and played through that.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:13.000
So, Platinum Games Designer Hideki Kamiya was asked on Twitter, will the original Bayonetta come to Wii U?

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:18.000
And the response, it's up to Sega or Ninty, which is Twitter speak for Nintendo.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:23.000
So, apparently it is completely up to Sega and Nintendo if that's going to happen or not.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
So, no pressure, make it happen.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Not going to happen.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Not going to happen, I agree.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:32.000
One more story, I had a few friends that were talking about this and I thought this sounded really cool.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:38.000
And I watched a little bit of it, but not as much as like Flaco Jones and some other people I know that listen to this show.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:50.000
It was the third annual Awesome Games Done Quick Marathon raised more than $327,000 raised during this marathon.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:54.000
I didn't see, what, did I miss, what charity did that go for?

01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:00.000
I want to know, that's the most important part. Oh, Prevent Cancer Foundation. Oh, that's a very worthy cause, good job.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:06.000
They played through more than 120 titles, everything from Skyrim to Echo the Dolphin.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Good times.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:14.000
The viewers were also able to bid on items, make donations and leave comments that could have possibly been read on air.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Lots of good stuff that they played through and they did them quickly.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
It's not just a clever name.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Yoshi's Island in almost 100% in like three hours.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:29.000
They, they did, I mean, they did games that don't take necessarily that long to beat.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Like, um, I don't know, Mario 64, cause you could run through that without getting all the stars.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Although I don't know if they did 100% completion or whatever.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:39.000
And then they did Final Fantasy 9. Good lord.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:43.000
How do you do an RPG quick? I missed that one. I should try to find out.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
More A-mashing.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Alright, moving on.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
My laptop just died actually officially.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Oh.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Hold on, I got it to reboot.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Good times.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Yeah, it completely, uh, Linux doesn't blue screen, it black screens.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Alrighty then, maybe I should go to the FUGL question and we'll come back?

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Maybe.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Alright, let's go to the FUGL question.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Put Facebook and Google together and you get FUGL.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:21.000
And that's the inspiration for this segment of our show where we ask a question of our listeners on Facebook and Google Plus fan communities.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:25.000
And we read some of our favorite answers here on the air.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Here's the question this week.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:36.000
There's been a lot of talk the past couple weeks about the potential and speculative emphasis on that negative influence that video games have on society.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:39.000
But let's take a moment to talk about the good.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:44.000
What are some of the good things that video games have done for you in your life?

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:48.000
I wanted to offset all this negativity going around this week about, you know, violent video games.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.000
I want to hear the good stuff.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Let's give the media this to report on.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.000
They won't.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:56.000
On Google Plus, some of the good things that video games have done for you.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Act deft.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
I'll summarize my answer in one word.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Inspire.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Flaco Jones says, my wife and I had video games in common at the early stages of our relationship, and they continue to be a positive thing we bond over to this day.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:13.000
That's really cute.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Thank you.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.000
You're a month early, Flaco.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:20.000
And even even Alan and I do that.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Like we leveled characters together and wow.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:26.000
All right.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:27.000
We met over DDR.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Me and Ryan met over DDR.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:33.000
But yet in Loki's relationship, that doesn't end up being the case, really.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.000
No, not at all.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
It just goes to show you everybody's a little bit different.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.000
All right.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:45.000
For you, the good things that video games did is it gives you an excuse to get away from your wife for a couple hours every week.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.000
I'm just kidding.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:47.000
I'm kidding.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.000
I love Nellie.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.000
She knows that.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:50.000
All right.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:51.000
I can't get away from her.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.000
She's always watching.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
She's probably listening right now.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.000
All right.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.000
No, she's not.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.000
No, come on.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:56:59.000
I don't understand.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:00.000
It's so nerdy.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:01.000
You're a nerd, Matt.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:02.000
All right.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Redertainment says video games fill a role in my life that other people fill with movies, TV, books, music, et cetera.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Video games ever entertain me.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Video games also save me money.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Think about how much entertainment you get per dollar with a 40 hour long video game as opposed to a two to four hour long movie.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:21.000
That's a very good answer.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
And then think of a book and weep.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.000
All right.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.000
All right.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
I love this answer in our chat room.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Bobby Black Wolf in our chat.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Video games let me meet all you wonderful people as well as act deft.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Ouch.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Ouch.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Going to Facebook.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:45.000
I've got my stuff up, by the way.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Okay.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Well, let me do Facebook and then we'll go back to Rapid Fire News.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:49.000
That's live radio, kids.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Sometimes you have to mix it up a bit.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Facebook Code Man says to be honest, video games keep me balanced.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:58.000
I use video games as a distressing mechanism.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
When I have a long day, I think that's de-stressing.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.000
De-stressing, yeah.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.000
It's not distressing.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:03.000
I'll blame autocorrect for that.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.000
It is via mobile, so it was probably autocorrect.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:10.000
When I have a long day at work and get home, I first greet my family and spend time with them.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:14.000
But if it's a crazy stressful day, I play video games a bit to de-stress.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:18.000
It's the same as a person who reads a book or watches their favorite shows.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
It calms them down and brings them to a better level.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:26.000
AZHP responds and says, video games introduced me to pretty much all the friends I have now in one way or another.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:32.000
When I decided to start playing DDR, I could have never have guessed that it would lead to me meeting a group of like-minded people

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:39.000
who accepted me for who I am and created lifelong friendships that have lasted for, well, as long as this show has been running.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.000
It's true.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Without video games, I wouldn't have this show.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
I probably wouldn't be podcasting.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:45.000
I don't know.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:50.000
I like the sound of my voice so much, though, I would have think I would have discovered podcasting through, like, another hobby.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Who knows?

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:55.000
I don't actually like hearing my own voice, so that's why I don't listen to us.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Really?

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Yeah, no, it's true.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:01.000
I think that's why I was so timid, especially last time I was here.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:05.000
The tough thing, though, about it is that, like, I'm my own worst critic.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Like, I don't hate to hear my own voice, although, but I'll listen to myself and I'll go,

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Ugh, you sound so...

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:12.000
You should sound more...

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
What the hell are we talking about?

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
No, I'm actually...

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
But anyway, let's see, more answers.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Wendy S.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:25.000
I think video games have taught me about the sports whose games I play, FIFA, NBA 2K.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:28.000
They also keep your mind and reflexes sharp as you grow older.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:36.000
I honestly believe, due to video games, there will be less dementia among seniors in the future if you assume current gamers will keep playing as they age.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Finally, I wanted to note that I think when teenagers attain positions of responsibility in their guild or clan, it teaches them leadership and responsibility.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:51.000
That's an interesting way to... I like the angle that, you know, it keeps your certain skills up so that when you get old, you don't lose them.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.000
You know, we see this a lot.

01:59:54.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Well, I don't know how much you guys, like, go to old folks' homes, but they do, like, Wii bowling and that stuff is, like, still something they do.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:05.000
And a lot of that is to, I mean, we might, like, laugh, like, you know, play a better game, old guy.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:09.000
But it kind of still keeps all that function going.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:15.000
My grandma's in one of those places and I was looking at the calendar and they had a Wii bowling night every Monday. It was something else.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Alright, um...

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:20.000
I wasn't laughing at you, I was laughing at a comment in chat.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
What was the comment that made you laugh? Who said it?

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Raginator says, I agree with Rob Roberts. He does love the sound of his own voice.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
I'm sexy, damn it.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Not as much as I love Dubstep Bird.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
Alright, um...

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
I closed the window, damn it.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:44.000
James S. replies and says, I know I've read somewhere lately that there were a few scientific tests done by a university that had proven that gaming actually strengthened your brain in areas that are vital for everyday life.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Anything from basic motor skills to depth perception to decision making.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Games aren't the culprit for these random acts of violence.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Violence has always been there, gaming hasn't.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:56.000
It's just that some people are sick and need help, simple as that.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
You know, that's a really damn good way of looking at it.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:01.000
Violence has always been there, gaming hasn't.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Although one could argue, you know, chess has been around a long time.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:07.000
But I get what you're saying. I totally get what you're saying, dude. That's a good point.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:13.000
Alright, Dartetsuya says, even before you guys started OLR, there was a time?

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Even before you guys started OLR, I met you guys via the epic music game Parties that were thrown back in early 2000.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Not gonna lie, I miss those days.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Playing B-Mania 2DX till the sun came up the next day, good times.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Oh, how many days we had like that, right Jason?

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:35.000
Do you still have a lot of those old games, Dark Sakura?

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:38.000
I have every single Bimani game I've ever purchased.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:41.000
You know, one of these days for old time's sake, we need to have...

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:44.000
That should be the freaking game marathon.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Have an old school DVR night.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Our pajama party?

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:48.000
All night long.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Our pajama party?

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Oh yeah, we're not supposed to talk about that on the air.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:57.000
Put the ixnay on the illo pipe fay.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
I didn't say anything about that.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Okay, I know, anyway.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
I think we should do a drunk DDR fest.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.000
That'd be awesome.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:11.000
I've played DDR drunk before and I nearly busted my head open on somebody's clothes washer.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:20.000
I was actually going through my closet today and I found two unused DDR pads from DDR Universe 1 and Universe 2.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
They're still folded up in there.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Why am I not... You're not coming through very loud. I don't know why. That's weird.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Sorry, am I not talking loud?

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Now we are.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Anyways, yeah.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:39.000
I have two DDR pads. I think I sold the game, but I sold the pads that have never been used.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
They're still there.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:42.000
I wonder what else is there.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
Oh, I also dug through the closet.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:54.000
There's a lot more game, like, main cabinet buttons and stuff from when I was going to make all the Bimani controllers and stuff for it.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:57.000
I have a ton of crap in there. It's ridiculous.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:05.000
We have a full-size pop-in controller still. We have, I think, four 2DX controllers.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Yeah, it should be two American, two Japanese.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:14.000
You know, I actually found an official Konami PlayStation dance pad at the thrift store.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:20.000
I got a DDR story coming up. We can reminisce more, but I want to get to what more listeners said.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Okay, just let me know when I can read my rapid fire.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
We'll get to it. I promise.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Okay.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:29.000
See, all I did is I just switched that with that and we'll just keep going.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Alright, live radio. It's an adventure.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Burr replies and says,

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Video games have taught me history, given me an appreciation for music and art, introduced me to friends around the world, and inspired my imagination for almost 30 years now.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:48.000
What has watching endless cable television news and punditry done for the people on the other side of the table?

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Hear, hear.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:50.000
That was like-

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Comedians?

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.000
That was the appropriate level of bitchiness that an answer needs.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:59.000
That's, frame it. Cut, print. That's a great answer.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
All these answers are so good tonight.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:04.000
I'm reading them all. I don't care. This show's running long. I don't care.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000
We'll do it live.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:06.000
Yeah, fuck it. We'll do it live.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Rageinator.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
Well, here's three ways they help me.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:13.000
One, in terms of games like first person shooters, Call of Duty, Halo, they help me vent.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:17.000
If I'm pissed off at whomever, it's easier- it's better to take it out virtually-

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Whom? Awesome.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:24.000
It's better to take it out virtually, rather IRL, for a whole host of reasons.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Two, gaming serves as a social outlet, contrary to what older generations would have you believe.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:33.000
And online gaming is a lot cheaper than other things, such as a night out drinking with friends.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Thank you.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Ain't that the truth.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Do you know how much drinks cost at the bar?

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Yes.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:44.000
For like, I could get a Long Island iced tea top shelf or a month of wow. I get it. I get it.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:50.000
Three, online gaming gives you an opportunity to meet other people that odds are you wouldn't otherwise meet.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Or conversely, it, like Facebook, helps you maintain friendships with those that move out of your area.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Unlike Facebook though, one can do more than talk via text.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
Thank you.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Welcome. Alright, that was for Rageinator.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Tiger Claw says, Video games have been a part of my life ever since I was a kid.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:13.000
I know for a fact that you should never ever take video games seriously.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:19.000
They provided me with hours of entertainment, and also great during times when you're feeling down or bored.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Gamer Girl says, I suffer from major depressive disorder, and ever since I was a kid, it's been my way to shut things out till I'm ready to deal with them.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:28.000
This is a heavy answer.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:33.000
It's like a way for me to be someone else for a while, until I'm ready to deal with what's going on.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:37.000
And not only that, but it helped my reflexes as a kid due to being disabled.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:42.000
So it's always helped me deal with real life in some way or another, and always good.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:49.000
Why don't they fucking read that on Fox News?

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:52.000
Because it doesn't suit their agenda.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Sorry, I just had this moment of like, I'm angry now.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:01.000
I'm not angry at you, Gamer Girl. I think you're great.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:05.000
That answer is just so powerful.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:09.000
It's like, I'm speechless.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
It bears repeating, doesn't it?

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Gamer Girl, you got me to shut up. Congratulations. You got me to shut up with that answer.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:20.000
I've been trying that for years.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Lastly, DDR Dollar Bill.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:26.000
If it wasn't for DDR, I wouldn't have become more social and outgoing.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
But this is heavy stuff, guys.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Too long to tell this story, but the game was responsible for reigniting my desire for dancing and music.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:38.000
I do love gaming, though I do want a future where games are more interactive.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Wait for the usual crap about go play football or some other sport.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
Just not where the game is bad.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:46.000
A fighting game that you actually have to move?

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.000
Well, the holodeck's only a matter of time away.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
I read every single answer tonight.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
You don't have to visit Facebook or Google. Those are all great answers.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Maybe there'll be some late-coming answers later.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
You should still join our communities on Facebook.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google Plus.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Search for Orange Lounge Radio.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
You wanna know what my answer to that one is?

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:10.000
And it's very specific.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:14.000
Super Mario RPG taught me rhythm before anything else did.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Really?

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Yeah, it's the simplest story and it's the funniest little thing, but I came to this realization not long ago

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:25.000
and now that I'm all music-oriented, my brain is starting to work in that manner.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:32.000
I've listened to music, I've heard it, whatever, but I guess the finer points of music and music theory?

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.000
The bonus game on Yoster's Isle where the Yoshis race.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:39.000
The first time I tried it, AB, AB, AB, AB, mash the buttons.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
Why isn't it doing anything?

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:48.000
And one of the Yoshis gives you a hint or something like that talks about that you go with the backbeat of the song.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:53.000
It's like, oh, look at that. Alternate in time and your Yoshi runs away.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:57.000
And it was just like the simplest thing, but that was what really sealed the deal.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:02.000
Music games came along after the fact to really turn that into its own little world,

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:10.000
but that was the first time that music had something specific instead of just being the art as it is.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
It's really the only way that I can describe it.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:20.000
I remember that very distinctly, that things just felt different after an example of the backbeat in Super Mario RPG.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:25.000
For me, video games gave me this.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
I mean, for real. I know we joked about it a minute ago.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Video games gave me this.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:34.000
And this is almost an extension of when I was growing up, I got picked on a lot.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:35.000
I can't imagine why.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:40.000
But for real, guys, I got called fag and all those dirty words you can possibly imagine a lot.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:44.000
And then it's like those same kids would turn around and ask me for advice on video games.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
Like, how do I get to the second quest in Zelda?

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Or how do I find level nine in the second quest?

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Like, come meet me behind the building.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:54.000
That type of thing where it's like, I don't want the other kids to see that I'm talking to you,

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
but I know you're the video game expert.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:00.000
And in some ways, this is almost an extension of that.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
I'm still talking to people about video games.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:08.000
I might not be as good at them as I used to be, but here I am with a bunch of awesome, like-minded people.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
It's just great.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:11.000
I know.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
I know. I know. Especially you, Jamie.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Especially me.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Well, in an extension on the inspiration part, it has me writing, it has me drawing.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:23.000
You know, there's so much that it brings.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:27.000
And yeah, go read a book. A book will do the same thing.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:34.000
But I think just the visual part of it, having somebody else's characters that you can kind of run free with kind of helps too.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Absolutely.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Original works, original inspirations.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:43.000
All right, before we get back into Jamie's rapid fire news stories, anything else anyone wants to share on that topic?

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
Um, no.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
All right, let's get back to rapid fire news.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:48.000
I would like a pony.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Not really.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
You can't have a pony. You can play Barbie Horse Adventures.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
I'm actually super allergic to horses, so I really don't want a pony.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
You can have a virtual pony.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
So how about Marvel Super Heroes?

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:58.000
Derby Owners Club.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:09:59.000
And Legos.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
I miss Derby Owners Club.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:04.000
Um, they got rid of the one at Dave & Buster's.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Oh, sad.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.000
I didn't see it last time I was there.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Do you still have your card with your horse named Glue?

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:09.000
I have my binder.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Nice.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Yeah, I do have a horse named Glue.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
You had Politary.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
So you could whip Politary.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Politary is sad because Rob beat her too hard.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Um, anyway.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Um, so Lego Marvel Super Heroes is going to be coming out.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:28.000
And, I'm very happy.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:35.000
It's got an original storyline where Nick Fury needs the help of Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and other heroes to stop Loki and Galactus.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:38.000
That's a team I would never have seen together, Loki and Galactus.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:43.000
I would think Galactus would be too busy eating planets to deal with the, you know, Norse God.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:46.000
Whose planet he wants to eat.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:51.000
Also next up, Capcom Arcade Cabinet has been confirmed for the West.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Ooh.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Um, basically it's a platform for Xbox Live Arcade and PSN that will be coming in the US.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:05.000
And we should be seeing more information on it on February 7th as far as what games are coming out.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:08.000
But one of the confirmed games is Black Tiger for the US release.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
As well as Japan.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Dan will be happy.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Dan will be really happy.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
So basically it's Game Room.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
But it's only Capcom.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Capcom.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:24.000
And then, last but not least, LittleBigPlanet 2 Extras Edition is announced.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:32.000
And, um, it will have the, uh, recently, um, released cross controller pack.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:37.000
So that's used the Vita as a controller and the move pack, Rise of the Kaling.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
And all kinds of fun stuff.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:43.000
And, uh, however, I don't believe it has what date it's gonna be out on.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
So yeah, that's it.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
Alright.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:50.000
And now I got more stuff to do, don't I?

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
Uh, no. We'll go to Loki next.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Well, I got stuff to do.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Soon. Soon.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Yes.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:08.000
So, um, there was, of course, this lawsuit in place, um, from Gamefly who was saying they were getting unfair treatment for their, um,

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
you know, their packages going out.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:18.000
Because Netflix and, I guess, Blockbuster Online were getting sorted manually, um, through the postal system.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
Whereas their stuff was not.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
It was going through machines and those were breaking discs.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:31.000
In fact, there was actually some, uh, there was a screenshot or a photo of this, like, you know, bin that says Netflix and Blockbuster DVDs.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
Doesn't say Gamefly DVDs.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Um, and so it actually, they ruled in favor of Gamefly and, um, basically told, you know, the US Postal Service that,

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:49.000
hey, you guys need to either fix this or you need to let us know, you know, tell us what's going on.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
Why are you guys doing this?

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:59.000
I mean, it's obvious that, you know, that you're doing this stuff and, you know, these companies aren't paying you any extra money to have this preferential treatment.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Now, you either gotta do it for everybody or you're gonna do it for no one.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
So, interesting.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Um, hopefully that means less broken DVDs in the mail.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:15.000
I don't know, have you ever gotten anything from, you know, Gamefly that was smashed?

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:16.000
No.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Yeah, so.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Everything's worked fine for me.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Maybe it's just, like, more metropolitan areas, you know, where there's a lot more mail.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Maybe.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
I live in an apartment complex, you know.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:32.000
It's not like they handle the mail totally well around here sometimes, but it works.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:35.000
Um, moving on, I promised you some DDR talk.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Here you go.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:41.000
Dance Dance Revolution Classroom Edition made an appearance at CES this year.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Konami and United Healthcare Group teaming up to bring this.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:48.000
I thought that was kind of an interesting partnership between Konami and an insurance company.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Uh, but they brought the game to the show to show it off.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Um, I gotta tell you what surprised me about it is that it was neat kind of seeing, like, new DDR.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:00.000
And I was looking at it going, why did they, like, stop the console editions?

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Like, this is an interesting direction that they were going.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:05.000
I mean, granted, DDR is DDR, but I thought it was kind of cool.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:08.000
I mean, 48 people can play this game at once.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:11.000
That's, like, two PE classes or depending on whatever school you go to, right?

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:17.000
Um, and you look at it and they've got one, you know, one tunnel or what do you call that?

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:20.000
The area where the notes scroll up.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:24.000
Do they ever have a term for that? The scroll bar? Whatever.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
The area where the notes scroll up, there's three of them.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:30.000
One for beginners, intermediates, and advanced all at the same time.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:34.000
So I'm assuming that means that people who aren't as good as DDR can play, like, the beginner ones

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:38.000
and people who are getting better can play the advanced ones so that everybody can kind of play together.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
I thought that was kind of neat.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:45.000
Um, apparently the wireless dance pads are made by Performance Design Products

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:49.000
and they can actually track a dancer's progress, steps, body mass index,

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:52.000
and how many calories you burn through what is a plug-in smart card.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
BMI is still bullshit.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:15:02.000
Then why isn't PDP putting these out then for consumers to buy if they're making some decent dance pads, you know what I mean?

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:06.000
I was kind of looking at it and going, this is something I wouldn't mind having in my house, actually.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:09.000
I could play with people over the internet or something.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Konami has launched this game three schools in Florida, Georgia, and Texas, I guess are the test ground for this.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:24.000
There is a whole video, it looks like Polygon actually did an interview on the floor with some of the people that were showing it,

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
so you can check that out at polygon.com.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
They actually have a whole little video in their section.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
Yeah, it was kind of neat to look at.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:34.000
It made me miss the dinner days a little bit. It did.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
There's a lot that's really interesting about that concept that makes sense.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:44.000
It throws out all of these, you know, expected mechanisms of DDR out the window that, who gives two shits about accuracy?

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Pick whatever is interesting for you, change on the fly, and the important part of what you have to do is still available.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:57.000
You're still on a dance pad, you're still moving around, you're still doing something and getting that sort of feedback, but you're not,

02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:00.000
oh, I'm the triple A player of the town.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:10.000
It's weird, they kind of look like, of course they have the overly excited person working at the booth doing, oh, I'm doing this fancy dance work.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:20.000
But the pads themselves kind of look like a cross between the ignition pads where they're kind of thick, but they also are, it's that plastic cover on the top.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:28.000
The only thing I don't like about it is you can't tell, you drift on those types of pads when you can't tell where the actual arrows are versus everything else.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:33.000
But it would still be nice to buy one, you know, if it's going to work pretty well.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:37.000
Obviously, if you're using a PE class, it's got to work somewhat okay.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:43.000
And hell, I mean, we played on soft pads attached to a piece of wood with laminate over the top of them.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:49.000
I am assuming that that would work. It worked okay then.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:56.000
Yeah, they did look like the ignition pads to me, because from a distance I thought they were metal pads, and I was like, damn, this thing's going to be expensive.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:07.000
But yeah, it was more the big, fluffy, but thick, those pads that Red Octane used to do before they got into guitar hero business.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:16.000
There you go. All right. So, moving on. Did your computer go boom again?

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:20.000
All right, so let's move on to the next, let's just skip it and come back to it. Loki.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:29.000
All right. So, let's see, we've got an interesting patent for PlayStation.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Man, what is with PlayStation and coming out in some really strange ass patents.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:39.000
But this one now, they have got a patent for the Move. It looks like a new Move controller.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:48.000
And the differences with the new controller versus the old one, one that's going to have some sort of interchangeable face plates.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:58.000
So, for example, you can have the four directional buttons on there, or you can have the XO square triangle buttons.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:03.000
Also, it kind of looks like an ice cream scoop, almost.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
Well, they look like them anyway.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:13.000
Yeah, but instead of having the buttons actually on the side of the pad, your hand would be behind the ball, I guess.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:22.000
And what's also weird about it is they've got these foot attachment things and then in the most ridiculous image for a patent ever,

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:32.000
they have some dude with like four Move controllers, because I'm going to really buy four Move controllers for $40 each, doing a fucking like flip kick for a soccer game.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:36.000
He's got those things like attached to his shoes. That is nuts.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Yes. Like, I mean, that's just fucking ridiculous. No one's going to do that. You're going to kill yourself.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:51.000
And then we're going to see that on Fox News. Video gamer kills self while playing FIFA, attempting to do a flip kick, hits, you know, coffee table, dies.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Or how about kicks the 80 inch television right off the wall.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
Or somebody else nearby.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:02.000
You know, kickboxing game, Move controller flies off foot. Some weird shit happens.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Gamer loses leg in freak accident, kicking fan.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:15.000
Let's just put it this way. OK, I don't know why they're having some sort of this patent, but I hope that God, this is not this isn't what they're bringing for PlayStation four.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Hey, you like those Move controllers? Well, guess what? We're going to strap them to every orifice of your body.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:29.000
That's right. We're going to track all of those naughty bits. Does this really solve the very first sentences of this?

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Sony recently filed a patent that describes a method for determining the location of a PlayStation Move like controller through a sound capturing device.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:44.000
If it's obscured by something in the way, like a body, if you're if you're spinning, if you're moving, the sound really solve the problem.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:58.000
That's how they do it right now. They've got it uses sound, I think, for part of it because they've got so many microphones in the actual like PlayStation eye camera that I thought that's what it was using.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:03.000
I thought it was just light like a special a special wavelength that the camera can see.

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:06.000
It's a rotation, a little a little bit of both, I think.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:11.000
I do know that like for voice or something is supposed to be able to track you or track something.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:20.000
It's got like five microphones in that thing. I could just see cause variety three talking about, you know, now on the PlayStation four, it comes with four move controllers.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:25.000
Let me show you a demo now. I will take one controller and put them in each hand and I will shake them up and down.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Then I will insert the third move controller into my mouth where I will rock back and forth the fourth move controller.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:36.000
I will shove into my anus. Let's play sing star.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:48.000
It just, I mean, I'm sorry.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Okay, here's the thing. Okay. The move controller, it's, I think the move is not that bad, but you know what they're showing with this patent here is basically, you know, they're saying that the controller has got some, you know, the swabble face buttons and stuff.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:10.000
And that, you know, I don't know, I don't think they really know much other than looking at the pictures, but those controllers look a little weird.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Um, and I know they've tried, you know, the leg strap stuff, how they've tried that with, you know, the Wii and like, I know they have some fitness games where you can get a leg strap so they can tell that you're, you know, running or something like that.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:31.000
But if this, I guess this thing, it was a determination of controller, three dimensional location using image analysis and ultrasonic communications.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:40.000
So I thought that's how it worked already though. I mean, I don't understand what they would be doing differently in this one.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Thank you. SSU and Hunter Matt for getting my reference is Mr. Garrison's gyro cycle thing in that episode of South Park.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:54.000
That's exactly what I was thinking about with the whole PlayStation move patent. Anyhow, it's for the best, Jason, that you don't watch it.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:22:00.000
All right. Moving on. Let's go back to what we had to skip over. Jamie.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Okay. Um, the more news about the OUYA actually. Basically, they've figured out that since it already runs Android games, it will run emulated games too.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:19.000
So people who already have OUYA boards are, um, basically putting up videos that show them playing Street Fighter.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Street Fighter, Mario 64 are already running on the OUYA.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:27.000
I think I said this on the show when we bought our Wii, you know what the very first thing was that I did?

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
Emulate. Played Mario 64.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:35.000
Uh, yeah. Very yes to this. I am so excited. Actually, emulators might sell me to OUYA.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:38.000
And from based on the video, they run well.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:46.000
Yeah. The video was not. I looked at it too. All I have to say. Oh yeah.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:52.000
You all right over there? Do you need a move controller to enhance the experience?

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:58.000
No. I get the Mario 64 song stuck in my head and it lasts. It doesn't go away.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:02.000
I got Rob doing it.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:08.000
I hope it runs the 64 games. That means I can play F-Zero even though I can kind of...

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:15.000
You know what that means? It means my cross crystal dreams. Because that game only exists emulated.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:22.000
Sayin'. And Star Fox 2. If it'll do, um, SNES emulation. Ooh, Star Fox 2.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:29.000
You know what else it means? Yet another emulator with the most unworkable controller for the system with the most unworkable controller.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
Yes! Here it is running on the OUYA.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:43.000
Multiplayer golden eye over the internet. Yeah! That should be Android Pat possible. Come on.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:49.000
God, I wish. All right. Moving on. Where are we at? Oh, speaking of Virtual Console. What a nice transition.

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:50.000
You're welcome.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:56.000
The Wii U Virtual Console games. They will be playable on the gamepad. You know, eventually.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:06.000
A representative for Nintendo said that there is plans to make a Wii U Virtual Console game playable on the new controller solely.

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Which of course has the touch screen on it. Not that the touch screen is going to do you any good.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:15.000
But it's still a way that you can, you know, you can have your Virtual Console game and you can play it on the TV.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:21.000
Or then somebody wants to watch Oprah or whatever. You can move it to the little device.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:27.000
Because currently they have, you know, the whole, like, was it, emulator running in an emulator.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Which I'm sure is fantastic for, you know, processing, you know, emulating an emulator.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:37.000
And I think, Loki, you are right on the money. I think certain DS games, it's just a matter of time before this happens.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:43.000
Why not? I mean, like, Pokemon Pearl would be a great game for this. Honestly. Perfect. Perfect game for this.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:47.000
Because the bottom screen really isn't, it doesn't do a whole lot with the game.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
I have a better idea. I have a better idea.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:50.000
What?

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:57.000
How about a native Wii U Pokemon title that features both screens at all times or as much as possible.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:58.000
You're funny. You're funny.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:06.000
I've got a crazy idea too. What if Pokemon X and Y came out for the 3DS and the Wii U.

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:11.000
That you can buy your portable games on the Wii U.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:18.000
Or you can buy them on your 3DS and they are playable on the Wii U and the 3DS.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
That's madness though, I'm sure.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:25.000
Alright. Does that mean it's time for mailbag?

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:26.000
I'm trying to get it to load.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:29.000
I'm all twisted up. I have it up if you need me as a backup.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
Do you want me to move on? We'll come back to mailbag?

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:35.000
Okay. Let's... I'm just improvising tonight, y'all.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:40.000
Let's move on to the FUs of the week. What an appropriate time with computer issues to go to the FUs of the week.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:55.000
Music

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
Need I ask Dar Sakura what she's mad about?

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Fuck my nutbook. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
May I have more chocolate?

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:05.000
You absolutely may have more chocolate.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:06.000
Thank you.

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:07.000
It's in the fridge.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:08.000
Uh, Loki.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:14.000
I feed myself for forgetting to mention that I gassed it up this week on the Down for Maintenance podcast with Code Man and friends.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Oh, shit. That's the whole reason you go on other podcasts is to promote your own appearance.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Yes, but now I'm promoting my own appearance.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:25.000
You should mention it at the top of next week's show too. Give those guys some love.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
Will do. It was a lot of fun.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Alright, good deal. I haven't listened to the whole episode yet. I want to though.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:34.000
Uh, my FU of the week goes to Rush Limbaugh.

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
Because, what an asshole.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
What an asshole.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:43.000
I'm not even going to repeat what he said. If you've been reading the news, you know what he said. What an asshole.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:47.000
Don't Google it. Please. Don't give him more attention. He's an asshole. That's all you need to know.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Uh, Jason.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:53.000
I'll second that FU for you because I really don't have anything better.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:54.000
And it's always worth it.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:57.000
He's twice the asshole I thought he was.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Ry.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
Fuck you to my job.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Fuck you to retail.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
Fuck you to my boss.

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:05.000
Yes.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Store boss, not immediate boss.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
Yes, store boss, not my immediate boss.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:11.000
I love my immediate boss.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:12.000
It matters.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:15.000
It's always the quiet ones that are the angstiest, doesn't it?

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
Fuck it.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:23.000
Suddenly, she's become a level 64 renegade, so look out.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
Alright, uh, moving on.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:29.000
By the way, I finally found my favorite renegade option in Mass Effect 2.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:30.000
Yes.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Making the guy that poisons you drink his own drink.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.000
That was fun.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:35.000
Good times.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:36.000
I got mail up, by the way.

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
You did get mail up. Oh.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
Well then, you know what that means. I play the mail theme.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:43.000
And I talk about every week.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
Dark Soccer dives in the mail bag.

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:48.000
And she pulls out a couple emails that she feels like reading.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:51.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:54.000
And you should send us more because we only got two emails this week.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:55.000
That is sad.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:59.000
That's actually a good thing that we only got two because it's so much easier to open on my iPad that way.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
That's true. But still.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:02.000
I had a backup.

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:07.000
And probably I'm gonna be absent from chat for a while until I get a new laptop.

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Sorry to hear that. You can always do it on your iPad.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:14.000
Do you know how much of a pain in the ass it is to switch between the screens and monitor chat?

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
And have all this shit running?

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:20.000
I could get my laptop out, you know. I do have one. It works, barely, but it works.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
This is an iPad too and it likes to stink.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:23.000
No.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:26.000
I have an iPad, uh, outdated in two months.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
At least I still offer, you know, updates for yours.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:31.000
Anyway.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:32.000
Mailbag.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:33.000
At OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:36.000
Dude, learn to spell grammar.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:37.000
Okay.

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:41.000
Grammar is spelled G-R-A-M-M-A-R, not E-R.

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:46.000
I have to say sorry about the grammar last email, maybe in this one, but one, I agree with Rob.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
I like Majora's Mask way better.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:51.000
I may have spelled it wrong, but you spelled it right, but you didn't capitalize anything.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:56.000
To be fair, I'm really happy you agree with me, but I think they're kind of both overrated.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
Sorry, not sorry.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:04.000
Two, I didn't like Skyward Sword is cuz? No, that should be because.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:07.000
I didn't like the art direction. I like Twilight Princess's art style.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:10.000
I also hated how empty the sky world was.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:14.000
Also, how there was only like three different places to explore.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:17.000
Also, my biggest thing I dislike is the motion plus.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:21.000
It worked with Wii Sports Resorts, but not for a Zelda game.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
That was a whole sentence, by the way.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:29.000
Oh, and that came from, I guess, Chris, somebody. Chris is cool.

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:41.000
I think I mentioned in November that I've started watching a lot of video game related videos on YouTube video series.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:47.000
Game Grumps, Continue Show, a lot of things by their friends.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:51.000
I'll watch one-off, two-off, but I'm really subscribed and dedicated to Game Grumps right now.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:30:05.000
When they were playing the Zelda adventure game in Nintendo Land, they were saying that that whole game's play mechanics is better than the whole of Skyward Sword as far as Wii motion controls are concerned.

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:16.000
I say that incidentally because I haven't actually played Skyward Sword, but I did play a bit of the Nintendo Land setup and it was quite fun.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:23.000
It was simple. I don't know how it expands to full screen Zelda, but it just seems fun.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:26.000
Okay, I guess I don't have a point to that spiel. Second email!

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:29.000
Second email comes from Raginator.

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:49.000
It's usually about random ass stuff related to physics.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:58.000
Well, all of that being said, I had an epiphany not too long ago related to physics, specifically about dark matter, and I'd like to write a thesis on it.

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:05.000
However, I do have one hurdle to overcome. My math skills are not advanced enough to write the paper. I never took calculus.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:09.000
That was your first typo. Congratulations, your grammar has been astounding.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:12.000
He missed one of the E's in never. He spelled N-V-E-R.

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:15.000
Sorry, I thought the email needed Warholic.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Oh, and thoughts. Here's the next one. My thought here is to perhaps collaborate with someone in a university that has a working knowledge of physics and calculus.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:31.000
Now my questions for you are as follows. Does this route sound feasible to you and how would I go about this?

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:35.000
I'm sure I can't very well just waltz in and say, hey, want to do a thesis with me?

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:43.000
If my epiphany that I had works out as well as I think it will, it could be very well groundbreaking.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Craigslist. Seriously?

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:51.000
Sorry, one more time the question. Sorry, I got distracted.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Okay, he has an idea about writing a thesis, which I think your thesis is more what your idea would be.

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:03.000
It would be the paper that you're trying to write about dark matter.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:12.000
I think that without knowing all of the mathematics and the science behind it, you're probably not in the best position.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:17.000
I would say start doing interviews. Call heads of, call deans of physics departments.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:22.000
Call various schools that are in your area and make an appointment to speak with people and ask them about it.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:28.000
Take a class here and there. Community colleges offer physics courses and talk to your teacher after class.

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:34.000
If it's something that you're truly interested in doing, especially since you have tons of free time on your hand, fuck.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:36.000
Go to school.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:43.000
See if it's something that maybe, you know, this isn't always a great substitute, but iTunes U has a lot of really interesting and diverse offerings out there.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
Oh, there are tons of physics podcasts.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:49.000
Take a peek. Yeah. Physics podcast. Great, great suggestion.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:55.000
Yeah, I've even listened to a few of them because they were actually interesting podcasts that combined physics with religion.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:33:00.000
You can find them just as easily as you found this crap.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:03.000
They might fester a little less. Done.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:08.000
Good, good feedback to our soccer. Good job. Despite your computer issues of the email back tonight, I must say.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:12.000
Hey, I'm trying. That's why I got this thing. It just doesn't work for running everything.

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:16.000
All right. Let's jam through these couple last stories here and we'll get to the Skype line at one eight seven seven game.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:19.000
Oh, well, are not yet. Don't call yet, but we'll let you know.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:26.000
Loki. All right. So there was another tablet that was shown, you know, kind of a big gaming tablet.

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:31.000
It was the razor project Fiona thing, which is now called Razor's Edge.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:40.000
If you may remember, that is the one that has the two like kind of nunchuck looking things that are attached to it or across with the nunchuck in the PlayStation move.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:43.000
It's got these like analog handle things, but now it is available.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:56.000
Actually, I should say it's available without that for thousand dollars for the base model, the I five one or twelve hundred or thirteen hundred dollars for the pro model, which is a core I seven.

02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:00.000
But this is a tablet actually runs PC stuff. It's got Windows eight on it.

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:06.000
It's got, you know, a gaming card in it. In fact, actually, it's got a pretty high end Nvidia card in there.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:15.000
It's kind of a surprise about that, which I kind of brought up the point that so does this thing run as hot as like the surface of the sun?

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:26.000
Because if it's got like, you know, some mobile 640 processor or something like that, I have no kind of clue how this thing would run.

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:35.000
Cool. Fuck my laptop. I do all sorts of cooling mods to get the run somewhat cool and it still runs hot.

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:40.000
I don't know. It's interesting. If you're interested, though, they are, I think, taking preorders for it.

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:45.000
And I don't think they've announced a date when it's going to be available. But oh, I'm sorry.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:59.000
The base model is available now, but the pro models coming later and they're saying that the thirteen hundred dollar one can run dishonored at 60 frames per second,

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:03.000
which I don't think that's that processor intensive of a game.

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:09.000
So it's I don't know, but it's an option, I guess, if you really want to spend that kind of money.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:16.000
Honestly, though, if you're going to spend thirteen hundred dollars on something, you'll probably get a laptop that's just as nice for a lot cheaper.

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:22.000
Just saying you don't need a tablet for everything or you can actually I actually was looking.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:27.000
You can make your own tablet be fun. But will the tablet play this game?

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:32.000
I'm about to talk about I guess it will. I'll say an Android, but it doesn't run Android.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:36.000
Never mind. But you could run it anywhere. OK, like compatibility or something. All right.

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:40.000
Anyhow, regardless, this is a game that was due to come out last week.

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:45.000
I guess people have been demanding this. I didn't know there was a market, but OK.

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:52.000
It's the spiritual successor to the game Shaq Fu. Yes, Shaq Fu. You heard me, Shaq. Like Shaquille O'Neal?

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:57.000
Yeah. Shaq Down, a 2D side scrolling action game.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:03.000
It actually does star Shaq or Shaquille O'Neal, of course, came out for iOS and Android.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:08.000
In the game, you battle zombies across three stages and bosses and all that stuff.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:12.000
It was developed by Hiptic Games and published by One Spear Entertainment.

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:15.000
Shaquille O'Neal is a major shareholder in One Spear Entertainment.

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:21.000
So there you go. ShaqDown.com for more information, because I know you're all waiting for it.

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:25.000
Three stages, man. Don't like, you know, overwork yourselves.

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:30.000
I mean, that's just like a lot of content. That's so they can sell you stages four and five later.

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:35.000
Why? Fuck that. That's how it works now. That's what that's what users want, Loki.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:39.000
Haven't you heard? That's what everybody said. That's what the users want.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:46.000
More Shaq games? I don't think that's what they say. Although they do have, you know, is it Shaq Fu?

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Was it, um, the, uh, the Skype line is open one eight seven seven game.

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:54.000
Or a user name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio. Sorry, Loki.

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:58.000
They have that Shaq Fu with the Gaiden one, you know. Nice.

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:05.000
And then the sequel to that. So one of those stupid long name Shaq Fu, the something ultimate Grand Alpha Z Gaiden.

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:10.000
VidPower in our chat room. Shaq Fu Gaiden was awesome.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:15.000
I never thought I'd see Shaq Fu and awesome in the same sentence, but there you go. It has its fans.

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:21.000
What can you say? Uh, Twitter topics. I'll try to fill in with a few of those. Twitter dot com slash o l r.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:26.000
We got a few topics that we either talked about earlier in the show or last week. Like I see one from Flocko.

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:30.000
We hit that during Rapid Fire News. One from SSJ100 Matt that we hit last week.

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:34.000
Oh, we have a phone call coming in. So I'll go back to Twitter topics in a minute.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:37.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:41.000
Hey, this is VidPower. Hey, VidPower. How you doing?

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:45.000
Good. Good. How are you today? I'm all right. Thanks for asking. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:50.000
I just want to call in about and talk about CES. Did you go?

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:53.000
I did. I did. That's right. You're in Vegas. It's in your backyard.

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:58.000
It is. It is. It's really easy to get there and then have to put up with traffic.

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:03.000
Now, Bobby on his show calls this the Consumer Electronics Show, which is not open to consumers.

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:08.000
But you what you snuck into the back door or you work somewhere that got you in or what?

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:13.000
I kind of snuck in. I snuck in every year.

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:20.000
Fair enough. Wow, this is like the renegade report on the Consumer Electronics Show.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:25.000
See, VoG can't afford to send anybody, so we just have people sneak in.

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:29.000
I'm just kidding. This wasn't endorsed by VoG. All right.

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
VidPower, tell us about what you saw at CES.

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:36.000
Yeah, well, you know, since Microsoft wasn't there at CES this year,

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:42.000
the amount of video games are pretty, well, CES isn't really known for video games anyway.

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:47.000
But like this year, there were just like a small handful of games that were showing off.

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:53.000
So not much. The big games were over at Sony's booth.

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:58.000
God of War Ascension that were showing off was probably like the main big thing.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:07.000
But they had a bunch of other demos, like the new Sly Cooper game was there.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:11.000
They had that Book of Spells game that they were demoing.

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:16.000
Did you get to see 120-inch television sets that just made everything look, oh, my God?

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Yeah, yeah, I did. I did see one of those new 4K television sets with the crazy huge clear resolution.

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
Do we need that?

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:33.000
No, you don't. But it's pretty cool looking at it.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:38.000
I was at Fry's just last night with Alan very randomly. We were just over there kind of killing time.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:43.000
And we were looking at some of their really nice TVs. And like the new TVs, they're not even 4Ks.

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:46.000
They're just like the HDTVs, but like the newer type of plasma or whatever.

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:49.000
And they were showing on Blu-ray. Speed Racer was on one of them.

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:55.000
And it was so like it just looked fake. And I realized like Speed Racer wasn't exactly, you know, real to begin with.

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:59.000
Like you can tell that shit was done on a computer.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
Same thing with the Avengers was showing on another one of the TVs.

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:06.000
And I was like, you can really see like, you can really tell computer versus real.

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:14.000
This is like jaw-dropping how like the ultra precision of it all almost ruins the movie magic a little bit.

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:23.000
It does. It does. Sometimes it looks a little like too, a bit fake with all that computer that they put in there.

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:28.000
Yeah, yeah. Sometimes it does look a bit fake.

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:36.000
But yeah, you know, they had a display of a Blu-ray playing on a TV next to one of these 4K televisions.

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:41.000
And I guess if you compare the two, you can kind of see a clearer resolution.

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:45.000
But like the average person probably couldn't see.

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
Couldn't tell at all. It's just too much.

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:48.000
Yeah, couldn't tell.

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:52.000
4K is made to show like 48 frames a second The Hobbit. And I don't know if everybody's ready for that.

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:59.000
Now I know you've been listening since the music gaming days. Did you see the classroom DDR thing?

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:03.000
I did. I did see DDR classroom edition.

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Did you check it out?

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:11.000
I did. I did. So they had a demo on, it was a pretty like giant screen.

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:18.000
And it had like seven of these wireless pads all set up for just random people to come play on it.

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:26.000
And I, you know, being an old school DDR person, I went up and I tested out this pad.

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:32.000
It's surprisingly good. It didn't slip at all.

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:38.000
I don't know if they put anything under the pad or what, but like I was just doing like the expert level steps.

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:39.000
Yeah.

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:45.000
And yeah, it didn't slip at all. It definitely had the problem that most soft pads had.

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:52.000
You know, you can't really feel the position of the arrow. So, you know, you're always like a bit off center.

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:55.000
You're playing on it. But it was surprisingly good.

02:41:55.000 --> 02:42:04.000
Good, like just kind of like a throwback to the old school, like red octane ignition 2.0 pads.

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:09.000
Was the music in it all old school or was it kind of mixed with like contemporary stuff?

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:16.000
Like, you know, you know what? There were like pretty much it was all like licensed like American music.

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:22.000
So there were like no like, you know, Konami originals or, you know, Japanese stuff.

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:25.000
So it was just like it was really Americanized.

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
No butterfly?

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:31.000
Yeah, no, no butterfly. No butterfly.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:36.000
How am I supposed to show everybody in my PE class my patented Kyle Snyder spin?

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:41.000
Oh, yeah. I was like, oh, OK.

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:45.000
I think we saw that Uber song was like, yeah, like I have like a ton of everything.

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:50.000
Anyway, I guess they'll have to stick with like Lady Gaga and Rihanna or whatever.

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:53.000
Awesome. Well, it sounds like you had a good time at CES.

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:59.000
So since you are a consumer who somehow got into Consumer Electronics Show and it is about trying to get you to buy something.

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:03.000
Is there anything you walked out of the show going, I might buy that?

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:08.000
Not really. CES is more really.

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:11.000
What a successful expo.

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:20.000
CES is really more about like technology that like to have like in the back of your mind.

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:24.000
But a lot of it's like not ready for consumers yet.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:28.000
You know, most likely in the price, price level of all this stuff.

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:32.000
Yeah, it's for CES is for rich people, not the people who have to sneak in.

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:40.000
E3, just like E3 is technically supposed to be for a lot of shops to be able to pick up, pick up publishers, CES is meant.

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:46.000
These are the technologies that you can offer to consumers and you get bits and pieces of it are good ideas, but it's not.

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:51.000
It's technology for consumers, not Best Buy convention extreme.

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:56.000
Pretty much. Yeah, that's a really accurate statement.

02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:03.000
It's more, it's more of like technology that's like ready for consumer in like three to four years from now.

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:07.000
All right. Well, VidPower, I should probably let you go to try and get another call here before the night's over.

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
But thanks for the report from CES.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
No problem, no problem. Anytime.

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
All right. You take care, buddy. Have a great week.

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Later.

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:15.000
All right. Bye.

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:20.000
It's nice to hear from VidPower. I haven't heard from him in a while, even though I want to know more about how he got in.

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
That sounds a little sneaky there.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:30.000
All right. Excuse me while we wait for more calls at 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:36.000
Again, some Twitter topics out here. Tiger Claw on Twitter sending us a tweet to a story.

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:37.000
Yes, I heard about this.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:40.000
It's not really gaming per se, but it's just kind of lolsy.

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:47.000
You know, there's that site where you can do a petition to the White House and if it gets so many signatures, they like have to respond to it or whatever.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:51.000
Well, there was that whole petition to build a Death Star.

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:54.000
The White House replied this week and said no.

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:58.000
But I thought it was a very clever answer because it talked about we can't afford that kind of debt.

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:01.000
And this administration does not support blowing up other planets.

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
That was my favorite response.

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:04.000
That was great.

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
It was great. An amazing response.

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:09.000
All right. Let's go to the phones and take another call.

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
Hey, guys. This is Degenera Johnny.

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:14.000
Hey.

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:15.000
How are you guys doing?

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:16.000
Degenera Johnny. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
Not much. Can't complain.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:26.000
Well, actually, I do have a complaint to Brad from Pod Culture for getting me addicted to that fireball whiskey.

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:32.000
It's very cinnamon.

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:35.000
The influence of vog is spreading. I love it.

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
That just makes me shudder. Yuck.

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:39.000
Amazing.

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:44.000
Well, sadly, Brad from Pod Culture told me he wasn't listening live tonight, but hopefully he'll catch up on the podcast.

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
A good old hearty F.U.

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
Yeah. Oh, it's all good.

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:51.000
As a matter of fact, I'm using it for the Orange Lounge Radio drinking game.

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:55.000
So, what else do you mind, buddy?

02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:05.000
Basically, well, I wanted to touch up on the whole video game violence thing.

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:17.000
I'm a little afraid right now of the timing of this because I'm playing Dead Space 1 and 2 in preparation for Dead Space 3.

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:32.000
And my problem is that, aside from Devil May Cry, this is one of the AAA titles that's coming out since the shooting.

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:45.000
And Visceral Games has a tendency of pushing the envelope of putting certain adversaries in their games, namely babies and children.

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:50.000
If you looked at their past three games, Dante's Inferno, Dead Space, and Dead Space 2.

02:46:51.000 --> 02:47:06.000
And so my problem is, I'm a little scared about this, is if they decide to do that again in Dead Space 3, would we see more irate type of backlash?

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:26.000
We haven't really received it beforehand, but in light of the shooting, this might come up and say Visceral, it puts in the six-year-old or seven-year-old pack hunters in the game, or the exploding babies.

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:32.000
I'm just a little afraid that there might be a little backlash if they decide to do that.

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:42.000
Yeah, I hear what you're saying, and I agree with you to a point that it's like, now would be a great time to just show a little restraint, but at the same time, somebody's gonna push the envelope.

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:49.000
And if it's not these guys, then guess what'll end up on Fox News eventually? It'll be that game that the guys made about Columbine or whatever.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:58.000
The controversial thing that came out some time ago. There's always gonna be somebody pushing the envelope, but at the same time, that's what the First Amendment is for.

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:13.000
And I think I've heard this argument before, is that we might want to put all these restrictions, but what lengths are we willing to go to sacrifice the First Amendment to spare all these others, or what have you?

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:20.000
Drama's gonna unfold as a result of this, but it's not gonna be any different than what we've been dealing with for the past decade.

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:33.000
I sort of have a feeling, I don't know, the cynic in me sort of thinks you are gonna start to see some type of legislation about violent video games, very similar to how you have motion pictures.

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:44.000
You know, in reality, they would just mirror the frickin' motion picture thing. You know, no one under 17 admitted without parent or guardian or whatever, but then again, the Motion Picture Association needs to be reformed.

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:59.000
Now would be a great time to examine all of that, because the MPAA is kind of shit, and the way they look at things, and that violent movies can be, you know, rated R, no problem, and kids can get in, but show a penis, and oh my god, not safe for anybody, right?

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:13.000
It's like this weird, weird, you know, kind of bullshit. So now would be a great time to evaluate all of that, but I think it's inevitable. You're gonna see some type of parental controls on this, where there's gonna be certain type of games you don't buy without a driver's license.

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:29.000
I just, or some type of identification, I just think that is inevitable, but it's also a little bit naive, because with the internet, you can get anything. You know, how you gonna regulate an M-rated game on the internet? It's gonna be a lot harder.

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:36.000
So, and since we're all going towards digital distribution, that's kind of the reality. Movies are going that way too.

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:56.000
Marissa Congusto in chat says, most likely there will be a threat of legislation, and the industry will censor itself. I'm totally with you there, Marissa, but that kind of already happened in the mid-90s. That's how we have the video game rating system we have now, was the first time we went through all this crap in the mid-90s, and that was when the record industry did the whole, you know, explicit lyrics thing, and all of that.

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
And Walmart stopped carrying them.

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
All of that happened, so.

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:14.000
And the way I interpret what Biden was saying is that I think he acknowledges that the ESRB is by far far more responsible than the MPAA.

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:28.000
I think it's like basically hinting to everybody, just, you know what, let it be general knowledge. You know, you guys are better than the MPAA, you guys are far more superior, more accountable, more responsible, definitely.

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:44.000
I mean, just pick up a DVD and compare it to a video game and, you know, you'll have a hard time looking for a rating of the movie, much versus, you know, on the game where it's both on the front and the back, and it actually tells you, you know, in big bold letters, why it's rated at.

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:53.000
That is an amazing amount of credit to give to Vice President Biden, I hope you're right, to hold up the ESRB as, this is what movies should be doing.

02:50:53.000 --> 02:51:04.000
That is quite the, you know what, I gotta say though, I wish, because the MPAA really, they need to look at that hard, hard they need to look at that.

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:23.000
It blows my mind, literally blows my mind how a movie like Saw 7 or any of those movies gets an R rating, but the movie Shameless that showed, you know, that guy from X-Men, it showed his little, you know, well, not little, but, you know, showed his wiener in that movie and all that.

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:24.000
Showed his little X.

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
Yeah, his little X or whatever.

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:27.000
Little Jimmy.

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:31.000
That was NC-17, because heaven forbid people have sex.

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
Heaven forbid people have penises.

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:44.000
But decapitations and people setting on fire and eyes sewn shut and all that crazy shit the Saw movies show, no problem, no problem.

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:47.000
That, okay, there's a big problem here.

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:48.000
Big problem.

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.000
I would rather see fucking than blood.

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:51.000
Just saying.

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:52.000
Me too.

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:53.000
Who wouldn't?

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:54.000
I knew.

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
What sick fucker wants to see blood?

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.000
I realize there's a whole like horror movie.

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:01.000
Now, I do have a friend who's completely into the human centipede, so.

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:02.000
Oh, God.

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:03.000
Awesome.

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:11.000
I should recognize that horror movie has its own subculture, but at least they all kind of admit it's a weird thing.

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:16.000
Like most horror movie fans I know go, yeah, it's gross, but that's what I love about it is it's so cheesy.

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
I'm like, all right, at least you know where it is.

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.000
I showed her the toddler pee and she cracked up.

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
I love TV ratings.

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:28.000
Gaming ratings and TV ratings both have the general level.

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:36.000
And then they point out these subcategories, you know, crude language, comic mischief, and up to the suggestive situations and so on and so forth.

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:37.000
And those are good.

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:40.000
They're expanded classifications that make a lot of sense.

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
And movies don't.

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:48.000
GameGuru in chat says about my comment about what's going to happen nationwide says, I don't think so.

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:53.000
California tried that and the Supreme Court shot it down by saying video games are protected speech.

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:54.000
There was more to it.

02:52:54.000 --> 02:53:00.000
I don't remember all the details, but I want to say it was going to bust the employees and all this other stuff that didn't make sense.

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:05.000
And the fact that I think mature gaming's like couldn't be on the shelves or had to have some type.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
Basically, they were going to treat the violent video games like porn.

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:14.000
That was the problem is the labels they were giving to that and so forth was the problem.

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:17.000
And that there is really no like there was no cut and dry.

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
What makes a violent game?

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:23.000
You know, there was it was going to be it wasn't they weren't trusting the ESRB to do it.

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:24.000
That's the problem.

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:35.000
But for them to step in and say, OK, the ESRB can get away with the same stuff the MPAA can or we're going to form a government agency that's basically the ESRB all over again or whatever.

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:39.000
I don't think that necessarily is out of the realm of possibility.

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:42.000
And I think that could be something that happens.

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:56.000
I think it might I think that's the whole point of Rockefeller's bill that he's trying to introduce is like to evaluate video games in a certain light to see if there's legislation that's necessary.

02:53:56.000 --> 02:54:02.000
Otherwise, you know, then we'll let be what it is.

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:03.000
Exactly. All right.

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:07.000
DeGeneres, Johnny, I got to let you go so we wrap up the show, but thanks so much for your call, buddy.

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:08.000
No problem.

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:09.000
You guys have a great day.

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
You too. Take care.

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
That is going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
I am very sorry to those that didn't get through.

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
I know usually I try to take one or two more calls.

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
I need to wrap up the show in the next few minutes here.

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:23.000
So I'm going to kind of start to wind things down.

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
I want to close out the Twitter topics, though.

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:26.000
Twitter dot com slash O.L.R.

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:38.000
There was one other tweet here I wanted to read from act deft who sent a story to a story about the PlayStation three has likely outsold the Xbox 360.

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:40.000
What?

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000
Oh, maybe maybe worldwide.

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:45.000
I believe it worldwide because Japan, you know, worldwide tilted.

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000
Is that what it is about worldwide?

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:53.000
Yeah. So worldwide, it looks like the PlayStation three has outsold the Xbox 360.

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
This will be great news to Sony fans everywhere.

02:54:55.000 --> 02:55:01.000
But really, guys, just, you know, all the play what you like and enjoy it.

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:02.000
Exactly.

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
System is only as good as the games are on it.

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:05.000
But you know what?

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000
I will say this much.

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:12.000
We all gave the PlayStation three tons of shit when it first came out and it deserved it.

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:15.000
But they've really turned it around in many ways.

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
And this is the reward that they get to reap for that.

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:18.000
Congratulations.

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:20.000
Now, can you do something about the Vita?

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:22.000
Yeah, seriously.

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
Please land on that note.

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:25.000
All right.

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
That was it for the Twitter topics tonight.

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:28.000
Rapid fire news.

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:31.000
I don't think there was anything left in the show, but maybe if you got any sorry.

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:32.000
Last minute story.

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:33.000
Cox on fire.

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:34.000
What?

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:35.000
Read the chat.

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:36.000
All right.

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:37.000
Fair enough.

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
All right.

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:40.000
That's it.

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:42.000
We're going to wrap up the show and head on out here for the night.

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:49.000
But not before we go around to get everybody's final thoughts and a chance for me to say, of course, as always, support independent podcasting.

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:53.000
You know, even if you thought this show was shit, go download another independent.

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:56.000
First off, if you thought it was bad, I'm surprised you made it this far.

02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:03.000
If you thought it was bad, send us feedback, constructive criticism and tell us what you thought didn't work instead of being an asshole.

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:06.000
Mailbag at Orange Laundry dot com Facebook dot com.

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000
Orange Laundry do at O.L.R. on Twitter.

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.000
Let me let me give you an example of bad feedback.

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:15.000
Bad feedback would be Rob is a bitch or bad feedback would be Loki screams too much.

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:16.000
Bitch.

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:21.000
Good feedback would be the audio levels need to be looked at because sometimes Loki gets a little louder.

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:22.000
That's fair feedback.

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:27.000
Or, you know, Rob should not talk so much when he's talking about that.

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:28.000
That or whatever.

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:29.000
Or send us good feedback.

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:30.000
We appreciate both kinds.

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000
We appreciate Jamie for everything that she.

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:38.000
We love her and you don't have anything nice to pay her to do.

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.000
Mailbag at Orange Laundry dot com.

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:47.000
Or if the feedback is good, consider leaving a five star review on iTunes and help spread the word.

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:50.000
You know, the other shows spread like a disease.

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:53.000
There's a lot of gaming podcasts out there, a ton.

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:59.000
But unfortunately, a lot of the ones that get all the attention from places like iTunes and so forth.

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:06.000
Not all, but a lot are things that would be getting your attention anyway, because there are parts of million dollar websites.

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:12.000
And, you know, they poop out podcasts every other day because they have the resources to do it.

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:16.000
But I really encourage you check out the shows that independent producers are doing.

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:19.000
I brought up gamertag radio earlier in the show.

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:23.000
I'm going to, of course, plug VOD because all the hardworking independent folks that are out there.

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
Lots of great shows on the network.

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
We used to be on video game outsiders.

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:30.000
I still try to try to listen to as much as I can.

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:33.000
Loki and I were both on Down for Maintenance, a startup show.

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:36.000
My buddies got Game Buoy, another great indie show.

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:41.000
So just just support those that do this for the love of podcasting.

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:44.000
Jason needs his own show because he's got a sexy voice.

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:46.000
He does. He really does.

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:47.000
I hope that happens soon.

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:51.000
You need to have a very smooth R&B intro as well.

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:56.000
You know what? We need to be like the kudzu of the podcasting world where we spread over everything.

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:58.000
And are high in iron.

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:03.000
Anyhow, please tell a friend or two about the show because we don't have a lot of advertising dollars for any of that stuff.

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:07.000
Like us on Facebook and all that stuff. It really helps.

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:11.000
Anyway, I really want to thank our guests for being here, coming out all the way from Colorado.

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:15.000
I know it wasn't just us, the reason why you came out, but we still appreciate you.

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000
You still have to drive here from San Francisco, which is no small task.

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:18.000
Always a great part of it.

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:19.000
So we really appreciate it.

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:22.000
Thank you, Jason, for being on the show tonight.

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:24.000
Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:26.000
If you don't hear from me in August, send help.

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:32.000
Okay. And Rai, good luck with pushing it to Paragon 100. We're all rooting for you.

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:35.000
Well, the next patch will definitely help.

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:36.000
Alright, that'll be good.

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.000
Five hundred percent experience! Yes!

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:43.000
Yes! I will not be playing MP10. I don't care. Five hundred and ten percent.

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:46.000
I don't care. I will not be doing MP10.

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:49.000
Any final thoughts for our listeners, Rai?

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:55.000
I'm glad that I'm finally coming out of a shell a little bit more, talking a little bit more than I was last time.

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:58.000
Helps to have my own microphone and not be sharing with Rob.

02:58:58.000 --> 02:58:59.000
There you go.

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.000
He never lets go of his, Mike.

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:02.000
Thank you to Brad.

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:04.000
Love you, Brad.

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:05.000
Thank you!

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:08.000
So let's go around and talk to our hosts.

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:11.000
Dark Soccer, you got your scarf on. You're ready to go. What's your final thought?

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:14.000
I just wanted to put my scarf on. You need to stop judging me.

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:16.000
Thanks for the chocolate and the coffee.

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:17.000
You're welcome anytime.

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:18.000
That's my thought.

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:20.000
Alright, and my final thought...

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:21.000
So long and thanks for the fish.

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:24.000
My final thought tonight is...

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:27.000
I don't know.

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:28.000
Loki, your final...

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:30.000
You love the sound of your own voice.

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:31.000
Yes.

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
Four score in seventy years... No.

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
Loki, what's your final thought tonight?

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:39.000
I guess I'll play some different games this week.

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:43.000
I was already loading up Giana Sisters to try that since I have it on Steam.

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:52.000
Maybe I'll finish the VoG Minecraft website and play Minecraft.

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:53.000
I don't know.

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:54.000
I got a lot of stuff I want to do.

02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:57.000
And I have a bunch of random computer parts that I took from...

02:59:57.000 --> 03:00:03.000
Well, not took from work, but I had stored at work in my garage that I want to build something out of.

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:04.000
I don't really know what.

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:07.000
But, man, I have so many random computer parts.

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:09.000
It's like I keep finding stuff. It's ridiculous.

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:11.000
I don't know what to make out of it.

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:17.000
You should make one of those little mini boxes that put it in something that no one would expect to see it in.

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:19.000
Like build it out of a fake loader box or something.

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:22.000
Well, originally I had parts for...

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:26.000
I was building an arcade cabinet inside one of...

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:29.000
It's like a tiny...

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:32.000
What was it? Like the old LCD Frogger games.

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:35.000
Like the really small cabinet ones.

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:38.000
Although it doesn't fit without dremeling some stuff out.

03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:44.000
So I have a Pico ITX... I think it's Pico ITX board.

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:50.000
And then I've got a ton of arcade boards and all sorts of crazy shit.

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:54.000
You should actually build the ultimate jamma cabinet and call it the bad mamma jamma.

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:55.000
Bad mamma jamma.

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000
I think someone's done that.

03:00:57.000 --> 03:01:00.000
All right. That does it.

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:05.000
Oh, ActDeft wants me to tell you, you have been added to the VOG club on Forza Horizon.

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:06.000
Woo!

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:07.000
And we have to play this week.

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:11.000
Oh, you can't be any worse than me, Matt. Don't worry about it.

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:14.000
Nah. You should have seen me driving.

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:16.000
Battle for last place.

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:18.000
Fist bump. All right.

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:20.000
That's it. We're done. Another show in the can.

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:22.000
We'll be back next week to do it all over again.

03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:24.000
Have a wonderful week and be nice to each other.

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:26.000
And I don't know what else to say.

03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:28.000
So I'll play the ending music.

03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:31.000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:36.000

Music.
