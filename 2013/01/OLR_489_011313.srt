Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, January 13th, 2013, a new gaming handheld debuts at CES,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
PokÃ©mon X and Y is announced, and further details emerge on the Steam Box.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 489,

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
for this January the 13th of 2013.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sure there's like a numberology thing in there, a numerology thing in there,

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
because all I ever see on the Twitters is like, Happy 1-2-1-2, or Happy 1-3-1-3,

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and everybody's looking for the number Zs.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The numbers?

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The number Zs, yes.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The numbers means we've been doing this too damn long.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Exactly, exactly. The lovely voice you hear over there is my co-host,

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
say hello to the one and only Jamie Summers!

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You should see how Rob is gesturing to me as if you could all see this.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Someday there might be a cam, we'll see.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I will be wearing a shroud.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I think that I will make the burqa fashion statement.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Lady Gaga might have you beat based on some pictures I saw on the internet.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Lady Gaga, okay?

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That woman needs to take her Adderall.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Alright, my name, by the way, is Rob Roberts, of course.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We are joined by all of you in our chat room, live, as we do tape live every Sunday night

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern on Sundays, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And a big thank you to everybody at the Voice of Geeks Network

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and all of you listening live in our chat room,

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
live.vognetwork.com for tuning in tonight.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We'll be talking about games and CES and all that fun stuff here in a little bit,

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
but of course we have to introduce the third host on our program.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Say hello to Tech Master, Loki!

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hi.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
How are you, Loki?

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm fine.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So, a trip to Disneyland may be in your future,

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
based on what we were talking about before the show.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Well, not that I want to go, but my wife might-

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
How can you not want to go to Disneyland?

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
How about she go with me and Dan?

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
There you go.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm fine with that.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No, honestly, I'm seriously fine with that.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I told her that she could go with other people,

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
but she wants to go to Disneyland,

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and personally, I don't want to go to Disneyland

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
just because I don't really-

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Most of the times I go, I have this anxiety about going on roller coasters,

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
although one time I got over that,

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and then it came back, so I don't understand it.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
One time, I really loved roller coasters.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What is with the macho men I know in my life,

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and their polarizing fear of roller coasters?

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's weird. No, it's a weird, irrational thing.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's not that I think anything's going to happen.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's just my body reacts to it like that,

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and even stupid shit.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You know how they have that really crappy ride

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
that's over in California Adventure?

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's like the old carnival ride where you're on the swings or whatever.

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh, I refuse to go on that one.

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The silly symphony swings now.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yeah, that made me feel really sick to my stomach.

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's just weird.

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What happens when-

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It goes in the shock.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
When the wife says, you need to go on California Screamin',

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
what are you afraid is going to happen?

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Do you cry?

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
No, I don't cry.

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't want to go.

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't know.

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's like I can't take the adrenaline rush or something.

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's really weird.

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I don't know.

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The only thing that gets me on Screamin' is that first hill,

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and then I'm fine.

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's Neil Patrick Harris' soothing voice that helps me out every time.

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Second thoughts? Too late.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I know that nothing is going to happen to me or anything.

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's not like I'm afraid that the roller coaster

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
is going to fall off the tracks or something like that.

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I know nothing is going to happen to me.

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm perfectly safe in there.

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
For some reason, I can't do it.

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
There was one time I went.

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
One of the last times I went with my family.

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It was kind of like that.

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I was like, I don't want to do this.

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We went on Thunder Mountain Railroad.

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I was like, that wasn't so bad.

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We kept going on it over and over and over again.

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It was before it killed the people on there.

95
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It was actually pretty fun.

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Don't talk about that, okay?

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Big Thunder is awesome if you go at night and sit in the back.

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It was pretty fun.

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I thought, okay, cool.

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I was pretty comfortable with it last time.

101
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This should be no big deal this time.

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Went there again.

103
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Last time we went, I was like,

104
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
why am I afraid of this stuff again?

105
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I don't understand. This doesn't make any sense.

106
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's not that you think you're going to die on the ride.

107
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's not even that I feel like I'm going to get sick.

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's almost like a panic attack.

109
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Like you might lose control of your bladder?

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No, it's not even that.

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's like a panic attack almost.

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You get the palpitations.

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Does your heart start beating faster?

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't understand.

116
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't go on roller coasters really.

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That's the thing.

118
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
She wants to bring Josh too.

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Not even besides the roller coaster stuff,

120
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
because I'm fine with just sitting out while she goes on roller coasters and that kind of thing

121
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and just going on parts of the Caribbean and that kind of crap.

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But I don't want to take Josh on a plane,

123
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
because that is going to be a pain in the ass.

124
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Why the hell would you fly anyway?

125
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You could drive. Yeah, you could drive.

126
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The drive is easy.

127
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We're not going to drive because she won't...

128
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
She has to go to the bathroom all the time.

129
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Well, so do I.

130
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Tam puts up with it.

131
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm trying to stop him a million times,

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
but I don't know.

133
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And then I also have to harass him for coffee.

134
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I also get that nervous

135
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
when I'm doing really big things.

136
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You remember last year,

137
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and I never shut up about this,

138
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and I'm going to tell the story again.

139
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Remember last year when I had that big thing

140
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
where I was at the RuPaul's Drag Race finale

141
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and I got to actually ask a question.

142
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It was supposed to be on TV.

143
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Now it got cut, but it's like a deleted scene you can see online.

144
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes, that's me, isn't it?

145
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If you Google it on Logo's site or whatever,

146
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
you can see the RuPaul's Drag Race Season 4 deleted scene,

147
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and I'm the first guy that asked the question.

148
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Well, I was so nervous before that.

149
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I literally thought I was going to barf,

150
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and I had to go to the bathroom right before that happened.

151
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
In fact, I asked one of the handlers,

152
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.

153
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I could feel my heart beating,

154
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
but then all of a sudden when the camera's on,

155
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm just like, I'll better.

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It just melted away.

157
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The only thing that will get me over going on roller coasters

158
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
is just going on roller coasters.

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That's really the only thing you can do.

160
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Showtime is nothing for you, Rob.

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You said to sensitize yourself to it.

162
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Let me introduce that phantom voice you just heard

163
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
who hadn't been introduced.

164
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Who the hell was that guy?

165
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That disconnected, deep radio voice.

166
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Well, you hopefully will recognize that disconnected, deep voice

167
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
as a voice you hear in the intro to the show every night.

168
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Or the pre-intro, if you will.

169
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Say hello, everybody, to Jason, or VXJsonXVYZ.

170
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's me, again.

171
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm doing this for almost a year,

172
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
and that's crazy to me to think about.

173
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Here you are, visiting yet again from Colorado.

174
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But it helps that you come out to San Francisco a lot for work

175
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
and we happen to be on the way.

176
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And then drive two hours and kill the better part of my Sunday.

177
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But hey, it's all for a good cause, so no complaints here.

178
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Are we allowed to talk about your job here on the show?

179
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah, I've meant when I had you talk about the game off.

180
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I can't remember, because sometimes we get people in here

181
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
who are in the game industry, so we can't say where they work.

182
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Shane!

183
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But it's the big N, Rob!

184
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But anyway, you work at GitHub.

185
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I do.

186
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So you guys have your Git-togethers in San Francisco, right?

187
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I wonder if that came up as a possible name for these big collections.

188
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
They bring the whole company, because Git together.

189
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'll give you that one on the house.

190
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We appreciate that. I'll run it by legal.

191
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Make sure that it's still free.

192
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
GitHub brings everybody in for twice yearly summits, January and August.

193
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And so I've been out here.

194
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The first time was when I started working here.

195
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The second time was the summit in August.

196
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We had a little Git-together in November for my team specifically.

197
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And now this is the second summit that I've been a part of with the company.

198
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's the company's fifth, I believe.

199
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And it's my second.

200
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And it starts tomorrow.

201
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And I'm kind of excited.

202
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Now, real quick, I sort of have a vague idea what GitHub is,

203
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
but I kind of feel like I'm not nerdy enough to GitHub.

204
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So what is GitHub?

205
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And where could a beginner nerd like me,

206
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
what could I profit from visiting GitHub

207
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and making it a part of my daily routine?

208
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Oh, man, you threw me a curveball.

209
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So the point of GitHub is to foster collaboration and development.

210
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The point is to make it easy to collaborate with fellow programmers,

211
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
fellow developers, designers, what have you,

212
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and get things done mutually, beneficially.

213
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Our slogan is something close to making collaborative development easier

214
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and I already screwed it up.

215
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Collaborative development easier than by yourself.

216
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Very much the open source movement,

217
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
but development in large part is better with multiple people, period.

218
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You yourself personally, I'm not sure that I have a specific use case for.

219
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
We're branching out into documentation.

220
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
One of the more interesting stories about GitHub last year

221
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
was Obama for America had their whole back-end system,

222
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
their CMS and everything on GitHub.

223
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And they were actually doing a tour, so they dropped by the office.

224
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
They were pretty cool people.

225
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Like writers, designers, developers,

226
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
there is a very obvious use case for them

227
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
because it's watching your works change through time.

228
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And if something goes wrong, you can go back to it.

229
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's change control. It's revision control.

230
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You specifically, I'm not sure.

231
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
In my day job, I work a lot with,

232
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I've been getting more and more,

233
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
just dabbing my big toe into the Visual Basic macros.

234
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Is that something you guys support?

235
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yeah, absolutely.

236
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The source behind those macros you can put on there,

237
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
change them when you need to if something,

238
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
if you find that a change...

239
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
There you go. You kind of sold me

240
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
because actually I had to learn.

241
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Everything I learned about Visual Basic, I Googled.

242
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I didn't take a class or nothing.

243
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I was like, I know this is something possible.

244
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I know if I click here,

245
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I know it can run a macro to copy another cell

246
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
and put it on a clipboard and make it plain text

247
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and stitch cells together and all that.

248
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I know that's possible.

249
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And I learned how to do all that through Googling.

250
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But GitHub, I probably could have done it in about a tenth of the time.

251
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Humongous source control warehouse.

252
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Source control database.

253
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yeah, I don't think about your day job.

254
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I just think about this when I hear about you.

255
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That's right.

256
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You could just use Google

257
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
because Google would probably source GitHub

258
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
as one of the responses for that.

259
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Fair enough. Fair enough.

260
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That's fine. I do try to keep my day job and night job separate.

261
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Because I don't want the day job knowing I have this gig

262
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
where I say fuck a lot.

263
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's a little unprofessional and so forth.

264
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That trainer has such a potty mouth.

265
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
We're going to use it in class.

266
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Mr. Rob is psycho.

267
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Bruce Wayne never goes to any of his functions as Batman.

268
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I mean, it just doesn't make any sense.

269
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's kind of like that.

270
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's a very, very good...

271
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And you're the Joker.

272
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
No, no.

273
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I can imagine what a board meeting would go like now.

274
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So, Mr. Wayne, have you looked at the financial report?

275
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm Batman.

276
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I did not look at the financial report.

277
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Mr. Wayne, are you okay?

278
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm fine.

279
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Also say hello joining us in studio.

280
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Say hello, everybody.

281
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That is my Batman voice.

282
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I am Batman.

283
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Say hello, everybody, to Ry Chan is visiting us here in studio as well tonight.

284
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
How are you doing?

285
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Not too bad.

286
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I am psycho.

287
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You're looking at me like I'm psycho.

288
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The only thing I have in my head after you use that voice is the Snickers commercial.

289
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Gotta love those old Snickers commercials.

290
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
They were great.

291
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So what are you doing here?

292
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You don't work out here.

293
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You're just here for fun.

294
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I actually managed to get a week off work.

295
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You gotta put that mic real close to your mouth.

296
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's not that sensitive.

297
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I managed to actually get a week off work.

298
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Hooray.

299
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Hooray.

300
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Vacation.

301
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
After retail holidays, I am so happy to be out.

302
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh, my gosh.

303
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I can only imagine.

304
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I remember from the last time you were here, wasn't it like a crafting type of store or something?

305
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I work in the printing center in an OfficeMax.

306
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Oh, okay.

307
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Why did I get that?

308
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
No, it was your other friend that worked in the crafting store.

309
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It was the gal that you brought that one show.

310
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
She was pretty cool.

311
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I never met her before.

312
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Oh.

313
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Rachel?

314
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yeah.

315
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Her mom runs Babetas.

316
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You gotta bring her back someday.

317
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I tried to.

318
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But for now, we got Ry.

319
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I love Ry too.

320
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So it works out.

321
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So Ry, what happens in San Francisco?

322
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What kind of touristy things you've been doing over there?

323
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I just got in yesterday morning.

324
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
No.

325
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You haven't had time to do shit.

326
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Nothing yet.

327
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
All right.

328
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Anything on the agenda?

329
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Dinner.

330
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Dinner.

331
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Dinner and more dinner and concerts and music and dinner.

332
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And relaxing and sleeping and a little bit of Diablo.

333
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You are a Diablo 3 nut.

334
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I am.

335
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I say that in the most, and it's interesting to me because I really tried to get on the Diablo 3 bandwagon.

336
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You and I even played some games together and I'm just like, it's not WoW.

337
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I can't.

338
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Or it's not Diablo 2 to me.

339
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But Diablo 3, it's working for you.

340
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And I say, great, great.

341
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Good for you.

342
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's okay.

343
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I may not like the same game that you like.

344
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What is it about Diablo 3 that keeps you coming back though?

345
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Because you're like level 60 plus the uber levels and all that stuff, right?

346
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yeah.

347
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I've got seven level 60 characters.

348
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I've got, my main character is Paragon 54 right now.

349
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Jesus Christ.

350
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Right now it's more of a social thing for me.

351
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Just kind of hanging out with friends and play.

352
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
That's fair.

353
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That's my excuse for WoW.

354
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I have a Paragon.

355
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Do not.

356
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Do not go there.

357
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Can we get through one freaking show?

358
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
No.

359
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Without you going there.

360
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
All right.

361
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Anyway.

362
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Jamie's sitting in the back going, well, if you have seven of them, why don't you try a Renegade?

363
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Just do the Renegade to get the full story.

364
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Paragon.

365
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Hey, I don't play Renegade.

366
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Have you ever heard of Diablo 3?

367
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Rob!

368
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Who was another person in this room that signed the damn blood pact?

369
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I had to.

370
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I had to.

371
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
All right.

372
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Let's see.

373
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So what's your favorite class in Diablo 3?

374
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
My monk has been my favorite.

375
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Monks are pretty cool.

376
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I like the witch doctor and I like the monk.

377
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Good times.

378
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Where's PVP?

379
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
1.0.7, which the opening notes just came out the other day for.

380
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Is that something you're interested in or you're like meh?

381
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Meh.

382
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Okay.

383
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
A dismissive hand wave?

384
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yeah.

385
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But some of the other stuff coming in.

386
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The MP experience boost and all that kind of stuff is going to be fun.

387
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
XP.

388
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Love it.

389
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yay, more XP.

390
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Did you fool around with Torchlight 2 at all?

391
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I have not.

392
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I take offense to that.

393
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What?

394
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Did she fool?

395
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Okay, sorry.

396
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's a video game.

397
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I talk about cheating on WoW all the time.

398
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Sometimes you have a relationship with a video game.

399
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I jest.

400
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Have you heard about the story that's floating around the game blogs this week?

401
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Thanks, JB.

402
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What the fuck's so funny?

403
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I jest.

404
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
No, no.

405
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Macho Man in chat said new class for Diablo dork.

406
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Shut up, Macho Man.

407
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Alright.

408
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Ooh, burn.

409
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Macho Man, I would be all over that class.

410
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Ooh, yeah.

411
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Snap into a Batman.

412
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Alright, um.

413
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Half Macho Man, half like, I don't know, the penguin from like the 1960s Batman or something.

414
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I don't really know what that is.

415
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Call it 20 minutes into the show.

416
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
We've lost it.

417
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Quack, quack, quack.

418
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Um.

419
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That's a good idea there, Loki.

420
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Quack, quack, quack.

421
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Um.

422
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
We should just do a show like that.

423
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I could just sit here and do Batman villains live.

424
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Do you want to talk games tonight?

425
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
The April 1st, you know, Orange Lounge.

426
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The 500th episode.

427
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
We'll just.

428
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Well, not 500.

429
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Oh, yeah, that is 500.

430
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah, remember we talked about this last week.

431
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Goddammit.

432
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Well, there goes my plan to do it like as like all Batman villains because that would

433
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
be kind of.

434
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
We'll make another show.

435
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm sorry, I totally could not make it through an entire show doing the Eartha Kitt Catwoman.

436
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Uh, where was I?

437
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Torchlight 2, Diablo 3.

438
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah, you were starting to ask me about Torchlight.

439
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yes, I was, but I was also going on the tangent about that story that's around the game blogs

440
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
about how people can spend like 250 hours or like 1000 hours with one video game.

441
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I don't know what the fuck they're talking about.

442
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yeah, look at.

443
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I mean, I'm talking about like what was it like Romancing Saga 3 or like just these these

444
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
interesting video games that people are spending tons of time with.

445
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And it's just about you just obsess over that one game and exploring every little nook

446
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and cranny of it.

447
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't know.

448
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I don't know anything about my wrong crowd to talk about that story.

449
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I have no idea because nobody sits around trying to get the fly cam to work on Mass Effect

450
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
2 for hours.

451
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I never played that many hours in Grand Theft Auto 4.

452
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Why don't you let Rai Chan talk?

453
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Walk walk walk.

454
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
All right.

455
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
My monk is sitting at about six hundred and fifty five hours last I've checked.

456
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
That's just my monk.

457
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Is that is one.

458
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Is there a command in Diablo three like slash played?

459
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Because there's a game in World of Warcraft and it's kind of like who's actually willing

460
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
to type slash played because then it will show you how many hours you've invested on

461
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
that character in World of Warcraft and it can be very soul breaking.

462
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Anybody else can look up that information on a player can't they?

463
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yeah you just look on your profile page and it'll show you how much time you spent with

464
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
each of your classes.

465
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But can other people see that at will whenever you're playing as that character?

466
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yes.

467
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Okay.

468
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You can see my entire group of characters and how many hours have been spent.

469
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
The only thing is is that it since I have two monks and two demon hunters it only shows

470
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
you the top of the two.

471
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Do you play with strangers ever or do you only like play exclusively with friends?

472
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It depends on who's on.

473
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Right now I try to play with friends as much as possible and it's kind of hard because

474
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I have so many on there so limit only four players per game.

475
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But if other people aren't on then we tend to join in public games right now.

476
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What's your best dumbass story from playing with strangers?

477
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I think she has a unfortunately it's not it's not a random person but I think one of her

478
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
recent friends has the best story of the group so far.

479
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Even better.

480
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
No you're not getting the the wife and Skype.

481
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Oh shit really?

482
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
No names no names protect the innocent but just the whole the the long and the short

483
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
of the long.

484
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
We're in Gotham City we need to bring these people to justice so we need to hear the story.

485
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
What it what it amounts to is that Ryan is usually with a group of however many people

486
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
are actually online on either some kind of a ventrilo Skype whatever conference call.

487
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And she was telling me about this story about one of the one of the gamers was playing and

488
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
the his Skype call was he didn't have headphones on it was playing and his wife hears another

489
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
woman's voice.

490
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And so the two of them are just broadcasting their fight to the whole rest of the party

491
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
just just flipping their shit because there's some other woman's voice coming from the computer.

492
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah just an oh my God you told me that you were going to if you were ever going to be

493
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
talking to another woman you would tell me about it.

494
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
No this got it.

495
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Oh it was.

496
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I think that's the best story she's told me so far.

497
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Really woman needs to get over her insecurity issues.

498
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yes.

499
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Yeah.

500
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Listening to them scream and cuss at each other was not a good thing.

501
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It was the most entertaining 30 minutes of your life.

502
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
That's what she's supposed to say.

503
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Well well in and VOG 006 who's in chat.

504
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It was actually the other person who was in with us.

505
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
He hasn't figured out yet how to go through and change it.

506
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But he he's in there.

507
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
New users new listeners.

508
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
We love them slash Nick.

509
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
All right.

510
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Oh Nick please not so quick.

511
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
All right.

512
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Welcome to the show.

513
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I hope things go well.

514
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's good to be back.

515
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Hope we get some more embarrassing stories throughout the night especially about other people.

516
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Those are the best kind.

517
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
All right.

518
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Let's talk about our gaming ways and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

519
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Maybe it's you know more Diablo 3 or in Dark Soccer's case.

520
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I can't possibly imagine what she's been playing but I'm going to go over there and ask anyway.

521
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Dark Soccer.

522
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
How was your gaming playing a healthy this kiss my ass.

523
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
No I played I played some well because I don't kick.

524
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I don't kiss as I kick it.

525
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
OK.

526
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Someone get that man a lozenge.

527
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So yeah I've I played some well and which Rob can vouch for since I chatted with him on while and we made my Jane Shepherd because I hate playing monks.

528
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Actually I don't like monks.

529
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Not much.

530
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I actually I really hate the animations for monks on blood elves are just too skinny.

531
00:20:44,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I also played Mass Effect 3 and Mass Effect 2 and I've actually my time in Mass Effect 2 has been nothing but trying to get fly cam to work which I have it working in everything except conversation modes although I did figure out the debug cam but it's still kind of a pain in the ass.

532
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I found out though interesting rendering issues that happen in the game when you try to enable the debug cam.

533
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So I'm also playing limbo which I'm really not very good at.

534
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I started playing that on the train again.

535
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I wanted to kind of get through some of those puzzles that I hadn't done in a while.

536
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I can't get past the damn block floating in the water.

537
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Like do you crawl over it and then make it float or?

538
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You use the block to get a rope that's slightly hidden behind a tree.

539
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The fuck? How am I supposed to see that?

540
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You you you grab the block you pull it back there's a little rope and you can scale the trees on their edges and there's a more or less broken branch that you push over it falls to the ground you push it over the water.

541
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
The fuck?

542
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You're at the very baby steps of that game. Oh wow.

543
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I know but I get pissed off and then it's like well fuck this noise I'm not gonna play anymore.

544
00:21:48,000 --> 00:22:10,000
That's a lot of the trick that's like the I don't want to call it the gimmick of the game because the design in general is really fantastic and it doesn't it doesn't abuse that but that's very much the the gimmick of the game is that the the scaling and the directional because you know it has the whole background foreground covers that it'll kind of do the foreground to trick your eyes when you're going forward and reset you from what's actually in the playable game.

545
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:21,000
But yeah grab the block bring it back look for a tiny little rope dangling from the tree scale up you'll find a break in a tree action push.

546
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Okay I'm doing that tonight you know.

547
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And now I wonder though if it's one of the games they've enabled with Linux yet.

548
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I have not been keeping any look at that library whatsoever.

549
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Anybody? Linux? Limbo? I mean it is Mac compatible so hopefully it's easy enough to bring to the whole saga.

550
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I just don't think it would be too hard for my netbook to handle the game but it's actually one that I can just actually leave on a screen and look around because I think it's pretty.

551
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Yeah it's two two tones the the the look of that game is ridiculously good.

552
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I love monochromatic stuff and then I've actually started drawing again.

553
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Yay drawing!

554
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Well I know I've talked about it on the show before but with my hand injury after my surgery I had a really hard time drawing because if I keep my hand in one position too long it'll cramp up really badly and painfully.

555
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I haven't been able to break down the scar tissue in my hand.

556
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So I found out the hard way that the pressure sensitivity in my tablet went out.

557
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So I actually took out paper and pencil and started drawing my one of my femsheps just drawing.

558
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And I got I managed to draw something I was in a lot of pain when I was done but I drew something and that's related to video games because of Garris.

559
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Okay femshep. Oh my god Rob.

560
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Trufflemania has landed on the Orange Lounge radio table.

561
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Hello my name is Jamie and I like to do drawings.

562
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
You know what's funny? What?

563
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I spent two hours watching episodes of Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings.

564
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Which have you ever seen what that skit came from Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings?

565
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Wait the one that was on Saturday Night Live that Mike Myers did?

566
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Yeah I grew up watching Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings and I thought no one else had heard of it until I found out another friend of mine had.

567
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
No I knew it was based on like a real thing so good times.

568
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Alright then I guess we're on to Loki. How was your game week?

569
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I played lots of Skyrim because I was working on getting the PC version. Well I got the PC version working of course.

570
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But I loaded on about I think I have 97 mods running right now.

571
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And the whole point was I wanted to add a bunch of stuff to the game so that it would seem not necessarily new but like I would forget what mods I put on there.

572
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
So I wouldn't know if like hey I just haven't run across this yet or hey this is something new.

573
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
So I did that and my character is really overpowered and stuff but it's kind of fun.

574
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And of course I had to mess with everything.

575
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Got super jumping, got this really creepy puppet master thing where there's these puppets that run around that you can summon that are really creepy looking.

576
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And then I have the mod where you can summon a bear that plays Miserulu which is awesome.

577
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Wait what?

578
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It's a bear that plays Miserulu. It was great too because I really need to start broadcasting or recording this stuff because I was in a dungeon and you're supposed to be sneaking around or whatever to attack people.

579
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:55,000
So what did I do? I spawned my puppet thing who ran down and charged after them. I spawned the bear that started playing Miserulu and I jumped down and hit him with a squeaky bat.

580
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
If you are interested in broadcasting on the OLR broadcast channel I can give you all that information and the software. The software is free.

581
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Okay.

582
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
So yeah.

583
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
That might be fun.

584
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Not breaking any rules.

585
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So I've been playing a lot of that and played a little bit of well actually played quite a bit of Borderlands 2 this week. Finished the single player campaign and yeah we cheated.

586
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,000
But that's alright though because it's a lot more fun when we have really overpowered guns. A lot more fun.

587
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
So we did that and what else?

588
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Do you own Borderlands on both the 360 and the PC?

589
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I have Borderlands 1 on PC and 360. I have Borderlands 2 only on 360.

590
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Okay.

591
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I have Borderlands 1 on PlayStation 3 and PC but that's because PS3 did the whole free with PlayStation Plus and I was like what the hell? Why not?

592
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Nuts to lack of cross platform multiplayer. As always.

593
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And then today I tried playing Forza Horizon although I see I was going to play because I have the Microsoft racing wheel and I've been meaning to try that out.

594
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:22,000
So the first thing I started trying to use the right racing wheel and I realized oh I need the AC adapter plugged in there because you have to have a battery pack and an AC adapter for the damn thing to work which is really ridiculous.

595
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So I did that and then when I tried syncing the racing wheel with the 360 I broke the, well I temporarily broke the sync button on the racing wheel so I had to take the whole thing apart to fix that.

596
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:46,000
So I got that fixed. Finally with like 5 minutes left before I had to leave I got to play with the steering wheel and I realized I don't like the steering wheel.

597
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It kind of, well it doesn't suck but it's just like I oversteer so easy on that thing it's just not very comfortable and also I didn't really have it set up on like a TV stand or something like that.

598
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm not sure that thing was made for the type of arcade racer that Forza Horizon is anyway. I mean Forza Horizon and like Forza 4 control very differently.

599
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So yeah I'm probably not going to play with that because it's kind of a pain in the ass to set all that up.

600
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:22,000
But I wanted to have used it for something because it was going to be used on the arcade cabinet but I just haven't gotten around to doing anything with it.

601
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:31,000
So I just kind of like hey I have this thing I'm going to try it out and see if it's any good and it's alright but controller is probably going to be the way I go with that.

602
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And then what else did I play? I played a bit of Modern Warfare 3. I think we played about a day of that. No it was alright.

603
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I've been trying to play a lot more stuff on my Steam account. I've been downloading things.

604
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Make use out of it. Good man.

605
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Yeah.

606
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Alright. Anything else?

607
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
That's it yeah.

608
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Then let us go over to I guess I'll go and then our guests can go.

609
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
As far as my gaming week honestly not a whole lot of new stuff.

610
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:13,000
You know this is kind of a time to catch up and to be fair I've been playing a lot of WoW because I'm trying to gear up a character so that she's ready to raid.

611
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Because we're having some changes in our raiding roster.

612
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
When there was some other changes with guilds and things like that.

613
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
That is all on Hoard House.

614
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
By the way just I got to plug the other show I do.

615
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Best Little Hoard House in Azeroth. Hoardhouse.com.

616
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
We had an epic show this week and if you like reality television at all.

617
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
We had Ronnie who was on Big Brother CBS a couple years ago.

618
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Was our guest because he was like the video game nerd on his season.

619
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Well like he legit he knows his shit with WoW and he was on the show.

620
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
So it was a great show so please please check it out at Hoardhouse.com.

621
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Even if you don't like reality TV it was still a fun show and we talked Warcraft.

622
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
So that kind of took up a lot of my time.

623
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
But I did I you know I actually was using Netflix on the Wii U.

624
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I know that's not a game but it's kind of my preferred Netflix device.

625
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I was watching a movie the other night.

626
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And then I was playing on the 3DS the demo for Mutant Mudds.

627
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Which I liked it's like a kind of like an 8-bit platformer.

628
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
But the whole fact that you can jump into the background and you come up into the foreground.

629
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
The 3D kind of lends itself very well to that whole thing.

630
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
But you know if you like retro games I'm sure Mutant Mudds is something that's right up your alley.

631
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And there's the demo so go check it out for 30 plays.

632
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
And kind of because of Shane I found my copy of Pokemon Pearl.

633
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And it's always Shane's fault. Fucker.

634
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
He is such a dealer.

635
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
In a way in a way I mean I've done it to him too.

636
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It goes both ways but the talk of the new Pokemon games.

637
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I'm not going to spoil it because I know there's a news story coming up on it earlier.

638
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
But I think we all know new Pokemon games were announced this week.

639
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And so I was asking questions about can you send Pokemon back and forth.

640
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Because the new game looks like it fixes like a lot of the problems I've had with the older games.

641
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And the older games I'm like they haven't they don't look any fucking different than they did in the original black and white Game Boy.

642
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Like they don't like yeah they're in color and there's extra things but they've changed very little.

643
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
First rule of Nintendo development. Don't change anything unless you really have to.

644
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
But this new one looks really like they have like totally redone it.

645
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
So I'm very excited about that. We'll talk more about the reboots later.

646
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Or I shouldn't say reboot. How it's not a reboot. We'll talk about that later.

647
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:25,000
But then I got it got me to thinking I'm like well I kind of want to I want to be able to like be really cool and have like Pokemon from the old games that I can transfer into the new games.

648
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Because I guess every Pokemon game has to have the coding and the programming for every single stinking Pokemon before it.

649
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Because you transfer from one game to like I guess even the newest like black to white to have the classic Pokemon red and blue characters in them.

650
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Because it is possible to have like a what's a what's a great Pokemon from the red blue era. Let's say Jinx to have a Jinx.

651
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Porygon! Like like traitor all the way up. It's possible.

652
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So I'm kind of like well maybe I should just make use of the Pokemon games I have.

653
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I played for 30 minutes and I was like I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do this for 40 hours or however long it takes to play a game. But we'll see.

654
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
How do you transfer your collections all the way up like that?

655
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
There's ways to do it. You have to you have to have the right systems and the right.

656
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:18,000
But like you know in the original DS's had the well the Game Boy Advances could read both regular Game Boy games and advanced games.

657
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
So I'm sure you can connect the two together and do it that way.

658
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Okay and then the DS's had the advanced port and the regular port like the original ones.

659
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Yeah the Fats did.

660
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
So you could do it that way and then.

661
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And now DS is an upper all network based.

662
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
They're all network based exactly so now you do it that way.

663
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Wow.

664
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:43,000
That's crazy to think that Nintendo still has like a straight line of interconnection with at least one generation like that.

665
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Technist in our chatroom says I haven't played Pokemon since Red, Blue, Yellow. Well in my opinion Technist you haven't missed much.

666
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Same.

667
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
But these new ones look like it's gonna really correct that.

668
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I tried to jump back in. We have Diamond and Pearl.

669
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
We do have Diamond and Pearl.

670
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I told myself that I love the concept of what you can do with Pokemon and I would jump into it when I feel that the features, the hardware is available to make really cool features and so we both bought into Diamond and Pearl.

671
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I played it for an hour or two maybe and I just said ehhh.

672
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And now I find out that Black 2 and White 2 are original DS and not 3DS.

673
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I don't really remember what my complaint about that was but it just surprised me because it came out well after the 3DS was in existence.

674
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Of course I haven't played regularly since Yellow. I actually still have the Game Boy, the special Game Boy from Yellow.

675
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Yes you do.

676
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Let's see going to some comments from our chatters at live.vognetwork.com.

677
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
AlphaCananagram says Skye, Pokemon kind of changed in a certain generation stats wise where it couldn't go up?

678
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
SSJ100Matt says the farthest back you can go are the Game Boy Advance Leaf, Green, Fire, Red games.

679
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Well it wouldn't surprise me if Shane lied to me y'all.

680
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I got all this from Shane so take it up with him.

681
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Alright he can call in later to defend himself.

682
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I'll go ahead and share the details of a private chat we were having between Shane and I.

683
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
He was asking what starter Pokemon I picked in Pearl and what I named him.

684
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Because I just remembered he did have a really great name for his, what is it, Chimchar?

685
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Is it a little monkey? A little fire monkey?

686
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Umm, Chim...

687
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Yeah it's Chimchar.

688
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I don't think so that doesn't sound right.

689
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Well he named his Chimchar which we're going to call it now until the chatter corrects us.

690
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
He named his Chimchar, Ho-Monkey.

691
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Think about it, Ho-Monkey.

692
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Homo and Key.

693
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Homo, Homo and Key. Get it?

694
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
So I said well what do I name him?

695
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Name yours Flaming Finger.

696
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
No, I picked a Piplup because they're little penguins and penguins are adorable right?

697
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And I was like well I didn't think to give it a dirty name because I need to know their regular name.

698
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I can't remember my name and their name.

699
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Like if you want me to learn Pokemon I just need to call it what it is right?

700
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I very rarely, I think I do this in any RPG I play.

701
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I don't change their names. I need to know their regular names.

702
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
So in your head Sanrio's name is Kat?

703
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Yes.

704
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So...

705
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Sharmi was other Kat.

706
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
So Shane suggested I call, I should go back and call him Penisquin.

707
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Didn't even think about that.

708
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Didn't even think about that.

709
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Alright and Misty in chat by the way says it is Chimchar Jason.

710
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I thought we were still talking original 151.

711
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
You are. Oh then you're thinking Charizard.

712
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
No I'm thinking Chim...

713
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Chim...

714
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Oh Charmander.

715
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I remember Mankey and for the life of me I can't think of the evolved version of it.

716
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I named my Mankey a very dirty word in Japanese.

717
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Alright anyhow.

718
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
So now that I've been talking about Pokemon on this show for 10 minutes we should probably move on with other gaming.

719
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I was going to say one more thing about Forza Horizon.

720
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Of course obviously the one thing that's blatantly in your face is that stupid festival.

721
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Which I was like oh my god I don't fucking care about the god damn festival I want to race.

722
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I want to race. I don't care about it.

723
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
You'll get it.

724
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
That was the same thing that bothered me at first.

725
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
That slowly slips into the background.

726
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
It doesn't matter anymore. You'll be fine.

727
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Thank you for bringing that up because I did spend a night on Forza Horizon.

728
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
We had a fun night.

729
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Some of the VoG people. It was myself, Bobby, ActDeft, SSJ100Matt.

730
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
We were all playing and it was a good time.

731
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
So we'll probably do that again during the week.

732
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
So keep an eye on Twitter for when we're going to play some Forza Horizon.

733
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Because that's a fun game.

734
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
So how do you add the VoG Car Club thing?

735
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Because I couldn't find that option.

736
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Of course I only looked for about a minute.

737
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I'll invite you.

738
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
If somebody hasn't already done it by the time those words left my mouth.

739
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Because if you're on the friends list of ActDeft or Bobby or somebody.

740
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
They just go into the car club. They can find you.

741
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
But I think for other people.

742
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I think when you go to the car club you can search for VoG.

743
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
V-O-G.

744
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And that's the tag. V-O-G.

745
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
It's easy to find.

746
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Alright, let's move on.

747
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Less Pokey, more me.

748
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Yes, less Pokey, more Jason.

749
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Pokey Jason, how was your gaming week?

750
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I have no idea how to respond to that.

751
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I didn't know this was that kind of show.

752
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Hey, at least I didn't call you home monkey.

753
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Alright.

754
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I have been a very bad gamer.

755
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Like I believe I said at the top of the show.

756
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I was out here in November.

757
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I spent Christmas with my family in western Colorado.

758
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,000
So I was away from all of my exciting electronic video boxes.

759
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I haven't played very much in a very long time.

760
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I had the discussion with Jamie that I kind of started to poke back into limbo.

761
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Because it sounded interesting.

762
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
But my go to hobby is turning into music.

763
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And that's taking over quite a bit.

764
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Because I don't know that I've even touched Borderlands 2 since October.

765
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Maybe November.

766
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I just... I play lots of tiny little things.

767
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Like I have stupid apps on my phone.

768
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I touch my 3S every once in a great while.

769
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
But I just don't...

770
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
There's nothing that I have that dedication to right now.

771
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I'll tell you a secret.

772
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Mixing music is something I've kind of always wanted to get into as well.

773
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I've tried. I've downloaded programs to try and do it.

774
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
But you can't do it software only.

775
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I took the plunge.

776
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I made the $500 investment to get a controller that appealed to...

777
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,000
The $500 investment more like $1500 after my case, speakers, mixer, cables, and shit.

778
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Alan! That's what I want for my birthday.

779
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
And that's kind of where I'm at right now.

780
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I pick up new music. I play around with it.

781
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I find ways to put it into mixes.

782
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Are you playing dubstep?

783
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
No. I was actually...

784
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I've been asked that sarcastically.

785
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
But I've gotten a few no shit requests about it.

786
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And I started thinking about my library.

787
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I'm like, well I have Skrillex because I was on that bandwagon.

788
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Look at your library. Look at your choices.

789
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
If my choices are based off my library, I have very few complaints.

790
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
You actually just made me think of something though.

791
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
There's a YouTube video of a cockatiel trilling dubstep.

792
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Because you know birds adapt to sounds around them into their language?

793
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
The bird speaks dubstep.

794
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I definitely need to see this sometime.

795
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,000
People want some music to be played at a party or whatever.

796
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I've gotten completely serious requests to play something like that.

797
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
And I just kind of think of what I have in my library.

798
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And it's like, I know a couple of these artists.

799
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I have a couple of one-offs.

800
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I have Skrillex because everybody jumped on that bandwagon.

801
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Some people call knife party dubstep even though they are not.

802
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
But I could not play 30 minutes worth.

803
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Get Nero. Nero's awesome.

804
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Nero's...

805
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
House dubstep and... what else does he do? Drum and bass.

806
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Yeah, I really enjoy Nero. I just don't have very much of his stuff.

807
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
In all fairness, because I don't want the dubstep fans to email the show.

808
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I hate you. Wub wub wub.

809
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I acquired the new Muse album this past week, which is a great album.

810
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
One of their songs though is a little bit dubstep experimentation.

811
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It's the best song on the whole album. It really is.

812
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
It really is, for real.

813
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Yeah, my two joints right now are the general house genre.

814
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It's kind of progressive, electro, maybe down to trance.

815
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
But then I play a lot of UK and Happy Hardcore that I've enjoyed for a very long time.

816
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And now I can actually do something interesting with it, so that's been pretty fun.

817
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And the great culmination of that is that my company, my employer, is putting on two shows this week.

818
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Tuesday at Mighty Down in San Francisco and Thursday a very public event at Public Works San Francisco.

819
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And I'm going to be on stage and I am freaking scared and excited and crazy.

820
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
You're going to be like closely about to get on a roller coaster at Disneyland.

821
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Yes, very much so.

822
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Right.

823
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Ry, how was your gaming week? What kind of video games have you been playing lately?

824
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Diablo?

825
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Not 24-7, but for the most of it.

826
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Just 22-7, you know. I need a couple of hours of work.

827
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Yeah, I went from Paragon, I believe, 47 up to 54 the past week.

828
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Running public games and whatnot.

829
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
The only other thing that I've played recently was Lego Lord of the Rings that I got for my birthday.

830
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Oh, of course.

831
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I really haven't gotten very far in it.

832
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Because?

833
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Diablo 3.

834
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
That's like a lot of games for me in World of Warcraft, so I don't feel bad.

835
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Alright.

836
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Well, I hope you can discover some more games in the coming weeks.

837
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Because eventually you're going to hit Paragon 60 and then what?

838
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Paragon 100.

839
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
60 is the standard level cap, but Paragon is 100.

840
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And that's of course also per character.

841
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
She has... no?

842
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
No, I am done after I get this character.

843
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
That's what they all say, huh?

844
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
It can be. Paragon is still specific to a character.

845
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And should she want to, she does have six other characters anyways.

846
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Alright, anyhow.

847
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Not to mention the fact that there's an achievement for getting ten level 60s and having two of each class at level 60.

848
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
She has the plan.

849
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
It's all about the achievements.

850
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Actually, that was another thing I was doing this week.

851
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I was trying to achievement hunt in old games.

852
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Okay, guys.

853
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Guess what game I played this week just to get an achievement.

854
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Yars.

855
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Worse. Worse.

856
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Dino Dash.

857
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
What is an Xbox Live Arcade game worse than Yaris and worse than Dino Dash?

858
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Avatar.

859
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Worse than Avatar.

860
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Um...

861
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Xbox Live Arcade.

862
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
It's offensive to anybody who listened to this show earlier today.

863
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Yes, I would say it beat and groovy.

864
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Beat and groovy. I played beat and groovy this week.

865
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Oh, shame on you.

866
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
And I got a new achievement.

867
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
To put money into that.

868
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I had to play every song in three button mode.

869
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I was so bored.

870
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And like, Alan walked out into the room.

871
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
He's like, this looks bad.

872
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
What is this?

873
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I'm like, it's on Xbox Live Arcade.

874
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I'm like, doesn't it look like it's PlayStation 1?

875
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
He's like, yeah, look at those character animations.

876
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Those are real next-gen right there.

877
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
So...

878
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Yeah.

879
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I had one of those weeks.

880
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Shame. Shame.

881
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
That's just a travesty.

882
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
No, shame to chat.

883
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Alright.

884
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I found something for you.

885
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Oh, this is for me.

886
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So this is...

887
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Oh, yes. Okay.

888
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Because earlier when you were talking about the bird singing dubstep, I'm like...

889
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Oh boy.

890
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
This show's been derailed seven times from Sunday already.

891
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
So...

892
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
What the hell?

893
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
What's another video gonna add to it?

894
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Okay, here we go.

895
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I think that's the one.

896
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
So this is bird singing dubstep.

897
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
If there's an ad on this, so help me God.

898
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
So help me God.

899
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Rod, it's not my fault.

900
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
You need to have your ad block up.

901
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
You're using Chrome, right?

902
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
No, you're not.

903
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Why are you using Chrome?

904
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Firefox.

905
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Shame on you.

906
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
That's it.

907
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:17,000
That's it.

908
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:24,000
The funny thing is that actually sounds like some pretty impressive beatboxing to an extent.

909
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Stupid bird.

910
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,000
My sister's birds would probably be something like that.

911
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,000
She has a bird that's exactly like that.

912
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I like that it's dancing.

913
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I could just listen to that for three hours.

914
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I could see the appeal of dubstep.

915
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I could totally just listen to that tonight.

916
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Let's go to break, you guys.

917
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
We're gonna have our music break tonight.

918
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Coming soon to DDR.

919
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
You know what's funny though?

920
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Actually birds like in the wild will pick up sounds from civilization around them and

921
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
really incorporate that into their bird calls.

922
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Like I've heard birds do car alarms and construction sites.

923
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I've heard sounds of birds that sound like they're drilling, like in heavy construction

924
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
sites.

925
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
SSJ100 Matt in our chat room says, congrats.

926
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
OLR has found the end of the internet.

927
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
That's right.

928
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
We have collectively been eaten by a group.

929
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Good night everybody.

930
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge.

931
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I don't know.

932
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I was just saying, tard's been replaced by dubstep bird.

933
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I don't know.

934
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I think Polly, the x-rated parrot might be a little, uh, you know, that came and went

935
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
though.

936
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
No, it's not Polly.

937
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
It's Ruby.

938
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Oh yeah, that.

939
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
All right.

940
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Let's, let's move on into some housekeeping.

941
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, twitter.com slash OLR.

942
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
You can also hear this show in Stitcher.

943
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Use thumbs up a lot if you listen there and share with all your friends and spread the

944
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:04,000
word cause you know, I can't imagine why word of the show doesn't spread like wildfire across

945
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
the masses.

946
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
By the way, speaking of popularity contests, uh, the podcast awards happened this past

947
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
week and we didn't win.

948
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Uh, that's too bad.

949
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
And I want to give a shout out.

950
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I got to give a shout out to my twitter buddy cause us independent podcasts have to stick

951
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
together.

952
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I got to give a shout out to my twitter buddy Godfrey from a gamer tag radio and you know,

953
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
he, that is a hard working guy.

954
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Uh, and he is very good at promoting his show.

955
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
He's a very passionate podcaster and I honest to God thought he was going to win it.

956
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I really did.

957
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And you know, it was kind of that thing where it's like, I'd love to win it, but if Godfrey

958
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
won it, it's hard to be mad because you know, he's been nominated several times.

959
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
He's, he's at this point they're becoming like the Susan Lucci of the podcast awards.

960
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
And so it's like, let the, let the guy win already.

961
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
He didn't win either.

962
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
And I was, I was like legit upset that he didn't win and we didn't win.

963
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
So Rob was doing that thing where he fans his face a little bit.

964
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I won't cry.

965
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I'm not going to Las Vegas cause Godfrey is probably going to win this year.

966
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
So I'll watch the speech from home.

967
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
And then when he didn't win, I'm like, Oh God, that poor guy went all the way to Vegas.

968
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
But it sounds like he had some great inspiration and all that and got to meet some really cool

969
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
people and do the networking.

970
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
So shame on me for not going to Vegas, but I'm broke.

971
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I am broke.

972
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Christmas broke me.

973
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
So this was not a good time of the year for the podcast.

974
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Anyway, uh, that is it, uh, for housekeeping.

975
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Let's get into some gaming news.

976
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Loki.

977
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
All right.

978
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
So let's talk a little bit about CES fun stuff.

979
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,000
And of course one of the big major announcements, um, gaming wise, they kind of happened a little

980
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:43,000
bit before CES even began was the new Nvidia handheld console that they're putting out.

981
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:51,000
It's the Nvidia shield and it's a Tegra four, um, based handheld system.

982
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
And it kind of looks like a controller with a screen attached to it.

983
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
And what's kind of unique about it though, aside from the fact that it looks like an

984
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Xbox three 60 controller and has the kind of almost the same button configuration.

985
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,000
That thing is that, uh, first off the display is pretty high def.

986
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
It's a seven 20 P display.

987
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Um, and of course, one of the things you can do with it is run Android games, obviously,

988
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:24,000
because it is running Android and you can even run, um, PC games on there by streaming

989
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
them to your system.

990
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
And they even have a way to, you know, it has an HDMI out on it, so you can play it

991
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
on your TV if you want.

992
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Um, but the whole fact that you can basically put in this mode where you stream stuff from

993
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
your PC and you can even bring up steam and play like, you know, console games on that

994
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
is kind of cool.

995
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Um, I can stream anything I want from my, uh, PC to the gaming handheld.

996
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Um, I guess whatever supported from it, but yeah, so number of seconds before porn is

997
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
displayed on one of these devices that has a web, it has a web browser in it cause it's

998
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Android.

999
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
So yes, it would be no time whatsoever.

1000
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
But if you think about it though, if you can stream from your PC and I'm assuming though

1001
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,000
that you can only do this, um, over LAN, I don't think it's actually, you know, over

1002
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,000
the internet, but you could probably do World of Warcraft, you know, sitting in bed with

1003
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
the controller and stuff like that.

1004
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
You know, I don't know how you could do a lot sitting in bed.

1005
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Yeah.

1006
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
No chat though.

1007
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Hypothetically, hypothetically, if I happen to have a TV in my bedroom, I could have boobies

1008
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
on the TV and boobies on the little handheld.

1009
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Yes.

1010
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Here dog, I heard you like boobs.

1011
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
So here's some boobs while you're watching boobs.

1012
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Um, but that's what technology is all about y'all.

1013
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
So yeah, they have, they have the whole, you know, steam big, uh, big picture mode support

1014
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
on there.

1015
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Um, no price announced yet for it.

1016
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
And obviously, you know, because it's one of the first to fry or devices that has a

1017
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
ticker form a chip and it's, it'll be interesting to see what it can run.

1018
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Um, they're saying, you know, more console quality games.

1019
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Uh, some of the games that they have announced for it, Hawken, which was a PC kind of a mech

1020
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
shooter and actually, um, what was that?

1021
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
One of the other titles was an old Wii game.

1022
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
The conduit is going to be getting like some sort of, you know, souped up version.

1023
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
They'll be on Android.

1024
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Um, so there's that stuff.

1025
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And then of course, you know, some other, you know, Android games, there's going to

1026
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
be more tear for games coming out.

1027
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Um, Nope.

1028
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
And like I said, no price point yet.

1029
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
That's kind of, everyone's like, Oh, it's going to kill the Ouya and stuff like that.

1030
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
They haven't announced the price yet.

1031
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
And the fact that, you know, this thing has got a display on it and the Tegra four, it's

1032
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
most likely not going to be within that $99 price point.

1033
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
So I don't know.

1034
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
It'll be interesting to see.

1035
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I think it's kind of exciting though, because you know, I've been looking forward to possibly

1036
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,000
making a computer that'll be hooked up to my TV at someday to use kind of like steam

1037
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
big picture mode.

1038
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
And you know, the fact that I'll be able to stream stuff to a separate screen, kind of

1039
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
like you can with the Wii U would be kind of, kind of fun, you know, and actually be

1040
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,000
able to, when the wife is hogging the TV, you know, as she's been doing for the last

1041
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
three months,

1042
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
a lot of people on the internet dismissing this as unnecessary.

1043
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Uh, you know, why, why does Nvidia have to get into this too?

1044
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Why they do their own hand?

1045
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
They have the chip and I think they've done their own like tablets or they've, I mean,

1046
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
they're providing chips for tablets.

1047
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Why not?

1048
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I mean, they've got the Nvidia zone thing for their Tegra stuff, the Tegra 3 stuff.

1049
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
So because they can, I mean, they're already in the PC marketplace.

1050
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
If you think about it though, this technology, that's the only thing.

1051
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
You're going to need a really high end graphics card in order to run this because it's built

1052
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
into your graphics card as far as being able to stream to this device.

1053
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
So really new high end graphics card and it has to be the Nvidia card.

1054
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
So that's why they're in this is because, oh, that's a really cool device.

1055
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Oh crap, got to upgrade my graphics card and I have to buy Nvidia.

1056
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
So that means more money for them.

1057
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
It's win-win because they sell the device in the graphics card.

1058
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
So when I first read about this, I was quick to blame the Ouya for this.

1059
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I don't know what it is, but I, I, there was a part of me that said Nvidia is doing this

1060
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
because of the Ouya and because of the way the Ouya took off, Nvidia said, you know,

1061
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
you know what Ouya's got wrong about this is that Ouya's making them, making you hook it up to a TV.

1062
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
What if we did an Ouya that's handheld?

1063
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I mean, isn't that, that's what a lot of this stuff is.

1064
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
An Ouya that's handheld is a tablet.

1065
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Well, what, okay.

1066
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
With a Bluetooth controller.

1067
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Okay, what, isn't that kind of what this is?

1068
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I mean, it's not a tablet per se, but it might as well be.

1069
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
No, this is, I think something else.

1070
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I think this is just, their whole thing is they're trying to go after PC gaming because,

1071
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I mean, they make money off of their chips, but I think they're gonna make more money off their graphics cards

1072
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,000
and all the tech that goes into that because, I mean, it's them and ATI, that's it.

1073
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,000
That's your choices for graphics cards and anything to edge out the competition to make people say,

1074
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,000
hey, you know what, I should get this because it's got, and if you think about it,

1075
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Nvidia's kind of done stuff like that.

1076
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I mean, they have three displays and they have, you know, that built into it and the PhysX stuff

1077
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:20,000
and also now the streaming thing and CUDA cores where you can, you know, run other things using that.

1078
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
You know, PC applications that support those other cores.

1079
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I mean, that's kind of the direction they're going.

1080
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,000
So I wouldn't exactly blame the Ouya for it because, I mean, they don't know how it's gonna do yet.

1081
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I mean, granted, you're seeing a lot more of these set top, I mean, the whole thing with CES was just like,

1082
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:45,000
you know, it's tablets and Google TV and 4K TVs is basically the three big things.

1083
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
But all people really want is an iPad.

1084
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I don't think so.

1085
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Are you sure?

1086
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Yeah. I mean, well, there's the Apple people that have to keep buying new things.

1087
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
There's a lot of Apple people though.

1088
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
There's a lot of people bought the Wii, but, you know, that doesn't mean that Nintendo's doing, you know,

1089
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
really well with the next system.

1090
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
A quick context jump, at least as far as the consumer is concerned.

1091
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:17,000
A buddy of mine that has this dinosaur of a phone was blown away at the ability to take his Wii U game pad,

1092
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
be in another room in the house and continue to browse the internet.

1093
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
He doesn't have to pull out his laptop.

1094
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
That too, really.

1095
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Kind of awkward for this anyways. Sorry.

1096
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:34,000
But it was just, it was the most absurd thing for me to read is that, wow, I have four inches of the internet,

1097
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
right smack dab in this little handheld controller and I don't even have to be in the same room as the TV is in.

1098
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
And I did one of these things where I reached into my pocket and I pulled out my phone.

1099
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I was like, wow, I'm not confined to the house.

1100
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
This is like five years in the future.

1101
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
And it's just strange because it's also like a connectivity excuse.

1102
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:01,000
If you can game anywhere, even on a screen that's that small, people will do it when they can.

1103
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
And I think there's application for it.

1104
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
It's not necessarily, it doesn't necessarily fit in best for us.

1105
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Maybe, maybe not as much as another person, but for these people that just have little setups,

1106
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
it has enough of an application to survive in the market, I think.

1107
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Well, how do you win across the people, the elderly folks that like Wii Sports Bowling?

1108
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
You show them the voodoo magic that is TV on a thing that's not the TV.

1109
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Holy crap, how did my TV get on this little piece of plastic?

1110
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
It says black magic. I'm buying one.

1111
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
And then they bowl it, drop it, and...

1112
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Are you a wizard?

1113
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Actually, in this case, it keeps working if they were to bowl that little controller.

1114
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Unless they like break off, snap off the screen.

1115
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
No, no, I can't connect anymore.

1116
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I don't like this camera on this thing. I think it's going to steal my identity.

1117
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
That's an old...

1118
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I could see that.

1119
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I've gotten that before.

1120
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Have you really?

1121
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Yeah, not camera specifically, but my name's on a website because I'm in a play.

1122
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Is there any problem with that?

1123
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
That's why my mom won't join Facebook.

1124
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I asked my mom. I asked my mom.

1125
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
My mom is on Twitter, and I'm not allowed to give out her Twitter handle or she will murder me.

1126
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
But my mom has always said like...

1127
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:15,000
And she's only on Twitter because she wants to follow Cher, Kathy Griffin, Barack Obama, and Rosie O'Donnell.

1128
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
No Oprah?

1129
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Not yet. She probably just hasn't thought of that one.

1130
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
But anyway, she follows like four people, and then me. She stalks me on Twitter.

1131
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
But anyway, what was I really going to say?

1132
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Oh yes, my mom will not join Facebook, and her thing always is,

1133
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Rob, I don't need to join Facebook.

1134
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
People have their identities stolen on Facebook, Rob.

1135
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
And no one wants to see my face.

1136
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
That's her line. No one wants to see my face.

1137
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
My face isn't on Facebook. At least not my profile picture.

1138
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
There you go.

1139
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
People have their identities stolen because they gave their card to someone, which you do on a daily freaking basis.

1140
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:53,000
People get their identities stolen from a waiter at a restaurant who is not somebody that the restaurant probably wants representing them.

1141
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
But unfortunately shit happens.

1142
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
So, you know, you just gotta be careful.

1143
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Alright, let's move on with some more news, shall we?

1144
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Talking about something else that was, you know, we didn't get a whole lot of gaming news out of CES this year.

1145
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
But there was a couple things here and there.

1146
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:15,000
And this was something that was gaining a lot of esteem, if you will, the talk at CES.

1147
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
It's Valve Steam Box.

1148
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
And it was confirmed by Gabe Newell that the Steam Box will run Linux.

1149
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:27,000
The Steam Box, of course, is a little PC in a box that's basically designed to be hooked up to the computer.

1150
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,000
It's basically out there to compete with the consoles, but it's a PC, it's Steam, and it will be Linux.

1151
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
And this is the one from Valve.

1152
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
From Valve. The official one from Valve.

1153
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Yes.

1154
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
By the way, that box itself, not supposed to hit in 2013.

1155
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
That kind of surprises me.

1156
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Why not strike now when all this stuff is a big hit?

1157
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I don't get what's so freaking difficult about this.

1158
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Like, what do they have planned for this?

1159
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I'm going back to an earlier prediction, by the way.

1160
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I am going back to an earlier prediction I had and I'm sticking by it.

1161
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Half-Life 3, when the Steam Box happens.

1162
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Probably.

1163
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Why not?

1164
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
And people who have the Steam Box will get Half-Life 3 first.

1165
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,000
And watch that thing just cut the Ouya off of the kneecaps. Watch. Watch.

1166
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
There's a reason why it's not dropping this year.

1167
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Compatibility.

1168
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Oh, because of Linux compatibility. They're waiting for more of the games.

1169
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
They need more developers to jump on.

1170
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
That's why Steam Linux is coming to Linux systems first.

1171
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Because they need to have that library base.

1172
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
They need it to be as successful as possible because when that thing drops,

1173
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Why can't I play Mass Effect on there?

1174
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Why can't I play World of Goo on there?

1175
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Why can't I play Toki, Tory, Limbo?

1176
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Anyways.

1177
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Well, how about a comment from Ben Krasnow, who is an electrical engineer with Valve.

1178
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Although I thought that's weird because I thought Valve people didn't have titles,

1179
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
but maybe that's just what's on his resume if you looked at his LinkedIn or something.

1180
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Quote, With regards to the Steam Box news, there's been a lot of things stated in media which I didn't say.

1181
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
For example, it's true that we are working on getting Steam into the living room

1182
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
and are planning for a hardware box,

1183
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
but we have no current plans to announce anything in 2013.

1184
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
So the Linux thing may end up being something...

1185
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
The thing to draw from this, we're hearing about the Linux thing now,

1186
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
but that may actually end up not being the case.

1187
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Maybe it's running Linux now, but who knows what's going to happen.

1188
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Because it can't run Windows 8.

1189
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
That would look really weird.

1190
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Well, it can't run Windows period.

1191
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
It can't run Mac OS, so why wouldn't it run Linux?

1192
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Mac OS like iOS. Wow.

1193
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
It could run a modified version of Linux.

1194
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Yeah, anything like...

1195
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
They may put together the Steam OS.

1196
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
The Steam OS, which is going to be a Linux kernel,

1197
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
their own different base utilities, whatever they need to do.

1198
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Call it Linux, call it not.

1199
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Call it not Linux because it's proprietary.

1200
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I don't know. What a big surprise.

1201
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
It's going to be based on the biggest open platform in the world.

1202
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Well, speaking of open platforms,

1203
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Gabe Newell apparently looking at the Steam Box

1204
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
as being something, or Steam in general,

1205
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
as being something that is a very user-generated paradise.

1206
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Maybe taking a cue from GitHub. Who knows?

1207
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Our view has always been...

1208
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Wow, nice leap.

1209
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Yeah, nice.

1210
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Our view has always been that we should build tools for customers

1211
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
and tools for partners.

1212
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
An editorial filter is fine,

1213
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
but there should be a bunch of editorial filters.

1214
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
The backend services should be network APIs that anybody can use.

1215
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
On the consumer side, anybody should be able to put up a store

1216
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
that hooks into those services.

1217
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Some people will create team stores.

1218
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Some people will create Sony stores.

1219
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Some people will create stores with only games that they think meet their quality bar.

1220
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Somebody is going to create a store that says,

1221
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
these are the worst games on Steam.

1222
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
So that's an example of where our thinking is leading us right now.

1223
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Very interesting.

1224
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Four letters.

1225
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,000
H-T-T-P.

1226
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Because the web is something that...

1227
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Or what? What's the point you're making with that?

1228
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Because that's become the universal communication mechanism.

1229
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
And let somebody do whatever the hell they want

1230
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
and then interconnect it and host it

1231
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
and make it available just by pointing to a different location

1232
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,000
and boom, the freedom of the internet and the open platform and hoorah.

1233
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I don't want to be dismissive about it

1234
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
because really it is the best thing to come to computing ever

1235
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
besides computing existing in the first place.

1236
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:15,000
But it's just an interesting thing they're banking on, I guess.

1237
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I don't know. I don't really have a way to summarize it.

1238
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
It's just funny that Steam has come from store to meta store

1239
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:25,000
and opening it all up, but there's still the linchpin holding it all together.

1240
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I don't know. I feel like I'm still missing one last detail

1241
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
that makes this whole narrative of everything Steam is doing

1242
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:36,000
over the next three years to make sense.

1243
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Do you think the Steam box is going to be too late?

1244
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Oh, hell no.

1245
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
No, not even a little bit.

1246
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
It's going to be a significant player, period.

1247
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
That's all there is to say about it.

1248
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
I don't think it really matters if it's too late.

1249
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Yeah, because there's other Half-Life 3s on it.

1250
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Well, I don't think they're really going to necessarily put Half-Life 3

1251
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
exclusive to the Steam box or anything like that,

1252
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
but I think that it may launch with it or something.

1253
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,000
And there's other third-party manufacturers of this stuff,

1254
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,000
so if you don't like the configuration of running Linux or anything like that,

1255
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
that probably wouldn't be something I'd be interested in.

1256
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I don't know. I just don't really want to run Linux.

1257
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
What about Linux Mint?

1258
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Could Jamie get her precious Linux Mint on a Steam box, you think?

1259
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Probably.

1260
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Why not? I can get Linux Mint on a USB drive.

1261
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,000
If you can get Linux on a toaster, Rob, Mint will run on anything.

1262
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Here's what I would like to see.

1263
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I would like to see more apps coming to Steam big picture mode,

1264
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
like, for example, Netflix and Hulu and that kind of stuff,

1265
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
because right now that's the thing.

1266
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I wanted to build a PC that has this kind of cool interface

1267
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
like the Xbox 360 and stuff,

1268
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,000
and big picture mode definitely works for that stuff,

1269
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
and I know there's workarounds that you can do.

1270
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
You can trick it into getting external programs to run it,

1271
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
but I'm talking about something that's actually in Steam big picture mode

1272
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
without having to do some workarounds and stuff.

1273
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
That would be pretty awesome, so that I can get all that stuff in there,

1274
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
because that's really what I'm looking for,

1275
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
is just watch TV stuff, play games,

1276
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,000
run it on a PC because things will look better.

1277
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
All right, let's move on with more news,

1278
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
because there was news this week that had nothing to do with new fangled consoles

1279
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
and new boxes and things,

1280
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
but news about the good old consoles that are out now, right, Jamie?

1281
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Yeah, some Pokemans.

1282
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Pokemon.

1283
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
So Nintendo announced that Pokemon X and Pokemon Y

1284
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
are going to be on the Nintendo 3DS,

1285
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
and they should be out later this October.

1286
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Why are we thinking that far ahead, man?

1287
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,000
But it just makes me wonder if you get all chick Pokemon in one

1288
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,000
and all dude Pokemon in the other, because they're XY.

1289
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Even if Pokemon had XY chromosomes, I'm just saying.

1290
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,000
No, I think it has something to do with the way the final bosses are named or something.

1291
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Well, at any rate, they're actually saying that it's not a reboot,

1292
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
it's just an evolution of the franchise,

1293
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,000
and Game Freak has basically been working their ass off trying to get it out.

1294
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,000
The quote is saying that there has never been a conscious decision to reboot.

1295
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
There's always been an evolution of the look and feel.

1296
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
No one gives a shit.

1297
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
So their Pikachu has evolved into a Raichu.

1298
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Yeah, their Pikachu is like a Pikachuer.

1299
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Their Wubachu has evolved into a Dubstepachu.

1300
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
That's never going to get old.

1301
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Never ever.

1302
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
And that's the sound that Pokemon still make in the games today, by the way.

1303
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
They never learned how to say their names like they did in the cartoon,

1304
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,000
but you go like, you know, Ho Monkey, I choose you, and it goes...

1305
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:10,000
The best thing that the newer Pokemon games have ever given is,

1306
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
X, use the Pester Ball. It's super effective.

1307
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000
It's super effective.

1308
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Are you excited about Pokemon X and Y?

1309
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
No.

1310
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Will you give it another chance?

1311
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
No.

1312
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I saw the little trailer video, and first things first about the trailer video.

1313
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Fennekin, totally adorable.

1314
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Have you seen Fennekin?

1315
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
No.

1316
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Let me put it this way.

1317
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
DeviantArt, like, jizzed in their pants.

1318
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
DeviantArt pisses me off.

1319
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Why does DeviantArt piss you off?

1320
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Besides the royalty thing.

1321
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Okay.

1322
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I'm talking the community.

1323
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Don't bring up that crap about the royalties.

1324
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I don't care about that.

1325
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
The community and all that.

1326
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Tumblr blew up.

1327
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
The royalty thing is...

1328
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Oh God.

1329
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,000
No, and actually, there are a lot of people who get their panties in a wad on DeviantArt these days,

1330
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,000
so I'm just completely kind of done, even though I did post something on there.

1331
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Done.

1332
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
So, wait a minute. You're done with DeviantArt, but you just posted there the other day?

1333
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Yeah, because I actually use...

1334
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I pay for my DeviantArt account to host my portfolio.

1335
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I guess that's fair.

1336
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
All right, look, look.

1337
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I got to show you this in the little trailer, although I'm sure I'm going to get hit with an ad here,

1338
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:24,000
but I got to show you in this trailer the Fennekin, because Fennekin's super adorable.

1339
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
And finally, the game looks different.

1340
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:34,000
It's not that same sprite-based thing we've seen since the original freaking games.

1341
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
It is like what you would expect to see on a 3DS.

1342
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
And Pikachu's still in it.

1343
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Pikachu!

1344
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Okay, so, you know, it's like, yay, we're going to take over the world one little pocket monster at a time.

1345
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:00,000
But see, now it's actually like what a game from this year should look like, right?

1346
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Okay, now that actually does look kind of fun, except I don't have a 3DS.

1347
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
And...

1348
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
However, the PokÃ©mon all look retarded.

1349
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Okay, that's Chespin. He looks cute, right?

1350
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
No.

1351
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,000
And look at the battles! The battles look like a freaking Dragon Quest game, or something.

1352
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
How adorable is Fennekin?

1353
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Okay, Fennekin is cute.

1354
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
See? See? He's like that's sassy.

1355
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
But only because it looks like Eevee.

1356
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Who put a fire fox in this game?

1357
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Oh, he's so cute.

1358
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
And then that is, I don't know, Froakie.

1359
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
That looks disgusting.

1360
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
What's that shit on its nose?

1361
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Are those glasses?

1362
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
No, it's big snot bubbles.

1363
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,000
That's what it is, he's blowing snot on whatever that raccoon thing is.

1364
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
And then Psyduck.

1365
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Psyduck is like the big joke of the series.

1366
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
No, that's Psyduck.

1367
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Psy.

1368
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,000
So, tell me, here's the little, like, uber PokÃ©mon at the end, or whatever.

1369
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Is his name Boner?

1370
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Ryze giving me the commentary.

1371
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
No, Rob, that one's Y.

1372
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
That one's X.

1373
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
You studied this trailer, you did your homework, right?

1374
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
And the secret one is Boner.

1375
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I actually haven't, just saw somebody post it on my Facebook.

1376
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
What's up with that peacock deer? That was really weird.

1377
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I will probably give these...

1378
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
So doesn't that, like, didn't that...

1379
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Like, yeah, you go, okay, new PokÃ©mon game, yeah, whoopty shit, I've seen this before.

1380
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
But then you look at that trailer and you go, they finally fuckin' changed it.

1381
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I can do this, this looks good.

1382
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I will give this game a shot again.

1383
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Welcome to 2013, Nintendo.

1384
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
The same argument I made for Diamond and Pearl for the DS, I think the 3DS.

1385
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:54,000
And I hope Nintendo's giving a shit about online and modern technology

1386
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
and the things that they're actually continuing to build into their new systems.

1387
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
I'll give this a shot.

1388
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Does that mean you'll play it for two hours this time?

1389
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
No, two and a half.

1390
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Two and a half.

1391
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Okay.

1392
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
It's an improvement, dammit.

1393
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
ActDeft in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

1394
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,000
dares to challenge Jamie, saying Magikarp is the big joke of the series.

1395
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Magikarp is...

1396
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
What I said.

1397
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Psyduck was more the joke in the cartoons.

1398
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
That's what, whatever, I don't care, it's PokÃ©mon.

1399
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
GameGuru, bringing logic into this argument, saying,

1400
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:29,000
well, PokÃ©mon had to update to polygons to support 3D, so they couldn't use sprites anymore.

1401
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
GameGuru, you haven't played those NES classics.

1402
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
They'll...

1403
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Where they just put the different, like, sprite layers on different 3D planes.

1404
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Like, they could have done cheap-ass 3D if they wanted to.

1405
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
But I'm glad they didn't.

1406
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
They're finally doing the right thing.

1407
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
All right, let's move on with more news.

1408
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Loki.

1409
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:53,000
All right, so there is a neat little piece of technology that they showed off at...

1410
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:59,000
I don't know if it was at CES, or it was just something that they showed off during CES,

1411
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:07,000
but it is this brand-new thing called the Microsoft IllumiRoom.

1412
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,000
And what the IllumiRoom demo was is basically this...

1413
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Kind of a combination of a projector and Kinect built in so that it senses the geometry of your room

1414
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
and then extends your gameplay field beyond the TV.

1415
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
And it could be supplemental stuff like, you know, they'll have...

1416
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
You'll be racing in a game or something like that,

1417
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,000
and the lighting effects from, like, cars driving by at night or something like that

1418
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,000
cast shadows on stuff that's in your room.

1419
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Or, you know, snow when you're walking through snow.

1420
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Or, you know, even, like, geometry for first-person shooters and that kind of thing.

1421
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Now, what's interesting about this is this is something we talked about before.

1422
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Not necessarily the IllumiRoom thing, but the kind of loss of hinting at it.

1423
01:10:53,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Like, for example, there's the whole patent back in September that, you know, kind of showed us this thing anyways,

1424
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:06,000
saying that, you know, they have a patent to use, I guess, some sort of 3D glasses with this

1425
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:11,000
and even maybe, you know, the Kinect and stuff like that.

1426
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I don't think necessarily that this is going to work with the Kinect

1427
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
because the way the projector works on this...

1428
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:24,000
And this is similar to what they had in their Microsoft Home of the Future display,

1429
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
which I think is on their campus.

1430
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
And this is what I've kind of alluded to before,

1431
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,000
where they showed off these different displays that are built into...

1432
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Not necessarily built into the walls, but they are projected onto the walls.

1433
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:43,000
So they have, like, for example, this, like, kids' room that will have this...

1434
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Fictional teenage girls, you know, favorite bands.

1435
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
You know, the posters on the wall are all dynamic.

1436
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
You know, it's showing her bands and stuff.

1437
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,000
And then, like, say, oh, Grandma's coming over today and they're going to stay in your room.

1438
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:00,000
And then the whole motif just changes completely to, you know, whoever's using it.

1439
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Like, they have a window that shows, you know, her dog at home on a security camera or something like that.

1440
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
So, basically, in this...

1441
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:14,000
And they also have some projects that they've done with augmentive projectors,

1442
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
where you can actually use your shadows to control stuff like Kinect,

1443
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,000
where, you know, you have, you know, particles that you're moving your hand

1444
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
and your shadow's, like, picking them up and you can actually pick stuff up with your fingers,

1445
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
which is kind of neat.

1446
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
So I see that kind of stuff happening.

1447
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Now, whether is this going to be included in the next Xbox?

1448
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I think, if anything, this will be an accessory for the next Xbox.

1449
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I don't think this is something that they can just throw in there because the setup is quite extensive.

1450
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I mean, you're going to need the system, your TV, and you're going to mount a projector to your ceiling somehow,

1451
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
or multiple projectors.

1452
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,000
So it'll be a little interesting how they do that.

1453
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,000
But pretty cool tech demo that they show there.

1454
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Pretty cool and pretty non-existent in the end.

1455
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Yeah, it's one of those things where I'm like, is this snake oil?

1456
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Like, the video is pretty impressive, the video that's floating around out there.

1457
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Yeah, well, it's a neat concept.

1458
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:16,000
It's not, I mean, I wouldn't say it's snake oil, but they have, you know, a working prototype,

1459
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,000
like, even if they show this, you know, Home of the Future type thing, this Microsoft thing.

1460
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Well, what about, I don't live in the Home of the Future, Loki.

1461
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,000
They have a working prototype in a 100% Taylor setup.

1462
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I live in the Home of the Poor People Past.

1463
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:34,000
I'm wondering, though, I'm wondering just basically how much this would cost,

1464
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
because projectors aren't cheap.

1465
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,000
And so, I mean, this would be cool technology if this is something that they launch with the system,

1466
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
that you're immersed in your whole room.

1467
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I mean, that would be pretty cool.

1468
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Projectors can come at all sorts of levels.

1469
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Like, yes, a high quality projector isn't cheap,

1470
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,000
but you can get a little thing that projects shadow puppets on the wall for your kids when they sleep for 20 bucks.

1471
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
So, I mean, what is the level of projection technology in this thing?

1472
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
It's somewhere in the middle, probably.

1473
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,000
But I don't think it's going to be built into the next Xbox. I'm with you.

1474
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
I think it's some type of accessory.

1475
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Well, they were even talking about, like, the tracking and stuff, better 3D modeling and capture and stuff.

1476
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Like, one of the things they said with the Kinect that they were going to change is that they're going to have,

1477
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:21,000
instead of having that IR field just in one spot, it's going to sweep the room,

1478
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,000
so that you get a better idea of the geometry of the room, which is kind of cool.

1479
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:30,000
And this is one of their other projects, their Kinect Track project, that they were going to...

1480
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,000
They said the six degrees of freedom, or a six DOF tracker,

1481
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:41,000
which allows real-time, low-cost pose estimation using our only commodity hardware.

1482
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:47,000
And, I don't know, it sounds interesting, but we'll see how they implement this.

1483
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,000
I mean, like I said, it looked pretty exciting, that whole, like, Home of the Future thing and how they have...

1484
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Because a lot of it was that they have some other technology that they call, like, Lightbox or something like that.

1485
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Basically, a lot of these displays that are projected from, you know, the ceiling and stuff like that.

1486
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
So, like, oh, I'm going to put this thing on the charger,

1487
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
and you see, like, a little HUD kind of appear next to whatever your device is,

1488
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
giving you information and the texture, you know, touching the surfaces and stuff.

1489
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:20,000
It's basically putting the display for your computer on any object or wall or whatever.

1490
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:25,000
So, it could be cool, and that would be also kind of neat if you think about it.

1491
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Like, imagine, you know, playing, like, Forza or something like that,

1492
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:35,000
and then you have all, you know, you could have maps and all sorts of HUD equipment, you know, outside of the TV.

1493
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,000
But that time, though, if you're going to have all that stuff outside of the screen,

1494
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,000
you might as well just use the projector as your display in the first place.

1495
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Raginator in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com asks,

1496
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Now the question is, how many steps away from Star Trek's holodeck is this projector?

1497
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,000
We're getting closer. Now it's making the whole room show imagery. It's closer.

1498
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
They have technology that's in another one of their videos,

1499
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
because they have this whole research thing that they do a bunch of, like, future tech stuff.

1500
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:08,000
They have a 3D display that is pretty interesting. It can be viewed from 360 degrees.

1501
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
So, you can't touch it yet, but we're getting there.

1502
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
We're getting there.

1503
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
We're getting there.

1504
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:22,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, swim.

1505
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Alright, well, moving on for time issues. This sounds awesome. I'm looking forward to more information on it.

1506
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I hope it's something that actually works, because the concept sounds great and could really enhance gaming.

1507
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Moving on, though, you know, a story that we've really kept an eye on,

1508
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,000
and everybody has in the game industry this week, is the fallout from the tragedy last month in Connecticut.

1509
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:51,000
And I'm sure you guys all heard in the news about the gaming companies that were actually meeting with Joe Biden this week.

1510
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,000
There was even some controversy around that. Should they even be meeting with Joe Biden?

1511
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Because is meeting with him admitting that they are part of the problem?

1512
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Well, here's the reality, guys. I mean, no matter where you stand on that issue,

1513
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:09,000
a survey company named Survey USA actually polled a bunch of parents.

1514
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:16,000
I don't know exactly what the qualifications were for this survey, but I guess it was all 50 states in the US, January 4th and 5th,

1515
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:21,000
just over 1,000 parents who have children under the age of 18 living at home.

1516
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:27,000
89% of parents believe that violence in today's video games is a problem.

1517
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:34,000
75% believe that violence in video games contributes to violent behavior. 75%.

1518
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:42,000
3 out of 4. That is a line that transcends Democrat and Republican, and any of that.

1519
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:52,000
That is a vast majority. That's the reality. 75% of parents believe that violence in video games contributes to violent behavior.

1520
01:17:52,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Now, what I would be curious to know is, does that mean that they take an active role in what their kids should and should not play?

1521
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
I wonder if the survey went to that.

1522
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Well, here's an example, and I know way too many. I'm not saying that any parent in this room does this,

1523
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
because I know you probably don't, really.

1524
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:24,000
There are some people who I know who have kids who really just let their kids sit unregulated and watch whatever they want to

1525
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,000
and play whatever they want to, and aren't even in the same room when they're playing a game.

1526
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:40,000
And of course, I don't think that it's a matter necessarily of the game or the show that's being influenced.

1527
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:45,000
It's a matter of neglect being the influence, because the kid's going to act out when they're not getting the attention they need.

1528
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Let me run down some of the other stats, because Jamie, I'm really curious what you think about some of this.

1529
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:59,000
93% of parents, damn near all parents, nationwide say lack of supervision for children contributes to violence.

1530
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Agreed.

1531
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,000
92% of parents nationwide say bullying contributes to violence.

1532
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Very much agreed.

1533
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:12,000
86% of parents nationwide say crime in day-to-day life contributes.

1534
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
That depends.

1535
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:20,000
See, yes, because the news shows it is where I'm going with that.

1536
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,000
See, my point is that it's media is the contributor.

1537
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:30,000
How many people think that that horrible gunman, and I won't say his name,

1538
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:37,000
how many people think that that horrible gunman did what he did so that he could go out with all the publicity?

1539
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Because if he wanted to end it all, he could have done it in a different way.

1540
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
But he did it in a way that was meant to get attention.

1541
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:51,000
I think he did it because his mother works there.

1542
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:59,000
I mean, I can't clearly put myself in that kind of mindset because I'm not a psychopath or sociopath,

1543
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:07,000
but he went to the school that his mother taught at and shot her students and then her.

1544
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,000
So that seems more of a big revenge thing.

1545
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Just because I want to spare you the males.

1546
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Technically, the mother was killed, then he went to the school.

1547
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Okay. But I think it's related.

1548
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:27,000
It's like, oh, she's gone, let's fuck up everything that meant something to her, and then we're done.

1549
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
I don't want to talk about him anymore.

1550
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,000
But my point is I don't know how much of the media might have had something to do with that,

1551
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
other than it gave it to him as an option.

1552
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:41,000
77% of parents nationwide say violence in TV and movies contributes.

1553
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,000
So, interesting enough, I mean, to be fair, as much as we're sitting here going,

1554
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:52,000
oh my gosh, 75%, that is 2% lower than the number of parents who say TV and movies contributes.

1555
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:57,000
So, at least everybody's getting blamed equally, I guess.

1556
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:02,000
64% say violent toys contribute.

1557
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Here's what surprised me.

1558
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:10,000
75%, we already established, believe that violence in video games contributes.

1559
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Guess what got the exact same percentage?

1560
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Also at 75%, exact same, easy access to guns contributes to violence.

1561
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Yeah.

1562
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,000
But on the exact same level as video games?

1563
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Well, again, video games are the scapegoat.

1564
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:42,000
We have tons of research, psychiatric data, and statistics that show video games are not the responsible thing.

1565
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I think when you put a combination of preexisting mental conditions,

1566
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:55,000
when you throw in easy access to weaponry, and when you throw in a few other external factors,

1567
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:00,000
like, for example, the guy here in California who was bullied,

1568
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:08,000
and he shot one of his bullies and got talked out of it, that's definitely a contributing factor.

1569
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,000
I need to get this out there because the chat room is lighting up on this.

1570
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
And again, we don't want the podcast listeners sitting there going,

1571
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
I'm going to write an email because they're wrong.

1572
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Folks in chat all over the place saying that it was not, she didn't work at the school.

1573
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,000
The media reported that, but the media fucked up a lot of the information at first.

1574
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Okay, fine.

1575
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,000
But I think there was some type of connection between him and the school,

1576
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
whether it was that he went there or something, I don't know.

1577
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
But anyway, you know.

1578
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Regardless, I think that maybe you might not have gotten the idea if it hadn't been something so publicized, you know.

1579
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:49,000
He's sick. We can all agree on that. Very, very, very sick.

1580
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Apparently, those surveyed were shown a video for Hitman Absolution.

1581
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:00,000
84% said that advertisement was inappropriate to show on TV at a time when children are watching.

1582
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Well, I'd actually kind of agree with that. You don't show a commercial like that during, you know, the Smurfs.

1583
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Not shown during the time when they were watching TV.

1584
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Yeah, that's true. That's right. They're not shown.

1585
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Once again, though.

1586
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Unless parents let their kids watch South Park unattended, which is an M-rated show.

1587
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Once again, though, I think, though, that a lot of this is just you're asking someone's opinion on this doesn't mean that they're right.

1588
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
And doesn't mean they're educated on that stuff, too.

1589
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:41,000
I mean, you know, they're all, I think, violence. I think violence in video games, you know, is what's causing these people to be violent or whatever.

1590
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Well, you can think that. Just like you can think that, you know, because this person doesn't believe in a certain, you know, godly entity that they're violent.

1591
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Or, you know, because this person is a homosexual, they're violent. Or because this person is a certain race, they're violent.

1592
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:03,000
You know, you can think all these things, but it doesn't necessarily mean that any of this is correct.

1593
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:15,000
So, I mean, I don't know. I just, once again, we're just probably going to see more legislature with, you know, video games because everyone's believing now that video games are violent because the media told them.

1594
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:23,000
And oddly enough, you know, they question all this other stuff, but they don't question media, which makes no sense whatsoever. But fine.

1595
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Let me close with this comment, and then I want to move on from SSJ100, Matt.

1596
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:39,000
People look for answers to understand tragedy. They want a finger to point at because the fact of the matter is people are terrified of the fact that people could do something so horrible for no reason than just because.

1597
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
I guess it's scapegoat.

1598
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Uh, one other story as a follow-up to this. And, you know, when this all first happened, I said, watch out because an angry mob is coming.

1599
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Guess what happened this week?

1600
01:24:52,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Massachusetts, the state, pulled video games out of state-operated rest stops. Not all video games, but light gun games.

1601
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Time crisis. Removed. Lethal enforcers. Gone.

1602
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
House of the Dead.

1603
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
I don't know if anybody had House of the Dead in the first place.

1604
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
But Lethal Enforcers first, really?

1605
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Time crisis and Beachhead 2000 was another one. Beachhead 2000.

1606
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
That's not a light gun game.

1607
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:29,000
What a pretentious fucking game Beachhead 2000 was in many ways. Let's be real. But still, apparently...

1608
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Too hot for Massachusetts.

1609
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Which version of Beachhead 2000?

1610
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
The one with that giant helmet.

1611
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Remember they also had the one where, at Golf Land, they had the one where you can actually sit inside the thing that's moving around?

1612
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Oh, the Sudoji or whatever that thing was called? The Sumo.

1613
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Sumo. Sumo. That was it.

1614
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Yeah. Was it the Sumo version?

1615
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Nah, I doubt it. I doubt it.

1616
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Fine. You know what? Yeah. Cool. That's your prerogative. You can do whatever the hell you want.

1617
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Because, you know what? It's your arcade. You can make those decisions.

1618
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:01,000
I don't even know why it was a news story. Other than, oh, this happened, so let's make it into a story.

1619
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:12,000
But, like, seriously, if you don't like fighting games, if people are bullying each other and you take fighting games out of your arcade, that's your own choice.

1620
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Did they replace it with non-violent ticket games? Because I'd like to know if that actually happened.

1621
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:25,000
The games that remained. Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, and Cruis'n Exotica at one point. Like, Cruis'n World. It's not a porn game. It's like the Cruis'n race games. Remember that?

1622
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Cruis'n Exotica. I mean, that's very violent. Can't you hit things? I mean, remember, Cruis'n USA, you can, like, explode here.

1623
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,000
And you can drive a school bus irresponsibly.

1624
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Can drive over 100 miles an hour, which doesn't happen in the States, except on race tracks.

1625
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Richard Davey, the State Secretary of Transportation in Massachusetts. Here's a quote.

1626
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Bottom line is, I think there isn't a person who doesn't believe that there isn't too much violence in our society, and games can glorify that.

1627
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:01,000
A video game in a public space could be used by anybody of any age.

1628
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:10,000
I think there isn't a person who doesn't believe that there isn't too much violence in our society, and games can glorify that.

1629
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:14,000
There is not one person who disagrees, apparently.

1630
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:19,000
My brain can't parse the first half of that sentence. It's like a triple negative to make the point.

1631
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Listen to this quote carefully one more time. Third time's the charm.

1632
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Bottom line is, I think there isn't a person who doesn't believe that there isn't too much violence in our society, and games can glorify that.

1633
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
It's a positive, because it's pretty negative.

1634
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:43,000
A person does not exist who doesn't believe that there isn't too much violence.

1635
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:51,000
So, I think it should be that, and he doesn't think that those people don't exist.

1636
01:27:51,000 --> 01:28:00,000
So, if I were going to rephrase that, I think what he intends is, I think most people believe there's too much violence in our society.

1637
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Wouldn't that have been easier?

1638
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
By the way, I don't think there's enough violence.

1639
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:09,000
He would have learned better grammar if he, you know, wasn't playing those violent video games.

1640
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
They're the blame.

1641
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Not playing violent video games leads to bad grammar.

1642
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:19,000
I want to make the most bloody grammar game ever. That'd be awesome.

1643
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,000
I don't know. Bloody...

1644
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I can't think of a...

1645
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Hunt Peck Mame, the game.

1646
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:36,000
According to Jason in our chatroom, Jason, you're talking in our chatroom, apparently that quote was, quote-ception.

1647
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Negative-ception. I have no idea. It just hurt my head to try to deal with.

1648
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:51,000
There isn't a person who doesn't believe that there isn't too much violence.

1649
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
We get it! We get it!

1650
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Alright, let's move on. More news.

1651
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Dark Sakura, one more story and then the release dates.

1652
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
DONG!

1653
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:13,000
UK University is trying to use the Kinect to see if it will help stroke victims.

1654
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:19,000
I couldn't res- I'll put it away. I'll put it away. I will put it away.

1655
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:23,000
I'm gonna take that gong and shove it so far up your ass.

1656
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
I don't know, this is kind of payback for all the vuvuzelas up there.

1657
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,000
That is true. She was pretty terrible with that, wasn't she?

1658
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:33,000
I'm gonna shove that gong so far up your ass that you burp brass.

1659
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Technically, I don't think it's a gong. Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1660
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,000
So you're gonna put brass in my ass to give me brassy gas?

1661
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Alright, seriously, read the fucking story. I'm gonna walk away.

1662
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,000
I would much rather have dubstep bird.

1663
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Can we remix those together?

1664
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
You have to add a reverb in it to make it go-

1665
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,000
They need to have a bird that does the Inception sound.

1666
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:07,000
If you think about it, if you think about it, it probably exists on the internet somewhere.

1667
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Inception bird?

1668
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
No, dubstep Inception HD here.

1669
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
That actually hurts.

1670
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:30,000
And I'm not meaning that in an exaggerating kind of way, it actually hurts.

1671
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Alright, just please read the story.

1672
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Nottingham Trent University has been awarded a 347,000 pound grant to build a prototype that will use Kinect for feedback to patients and to their doctors.

1673
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:57,000
These are for stroke victims. They're wanting to use the system to detect and track asymmetries on the patient's face.

1674
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:02,000
That means mouth, eyes, cheeks, like for facial exercises.

1675
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:09,000
I think it's for people who end up with ticks after strokes or being paralyzed.

1676
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:30,000
And this is actually being headed, looks like, by Dr. Philip Breeden, who is basically saying that the system is going to use those exercises and see how successful they are with that feedback provided by the Kinect system.

1677
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
So, pretty good.

1678
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:43,000
I'm glad to hear a story about gaming things and things that were done for gaming doing good after those past couple stories we had.

1679
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Agreed. And I mean, you really have to think about it.

1680
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Like, for example, they had all those PlayStations put together to calculate, you know, cures.

1681
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:03,000
They had, you know, now this technology with Kinect, they've got lots of cognitive therapy exercises that are being done with video games.

1682
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:10,000
And I think that there's too much negative focus being put on a lot of.

1683
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:14,000
They need to have more stuff like this go out in public. People go,

1684
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Wouldn't that be nice?

1685
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
But people are looking for their scapegoat and they don't want to see anything good come out of it, so fuck them.

1686
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Quick side story about the Kinect.

1687
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Went to a New Year's party. Couple friends of mine that have a little band, little two-piece keyboard chiptune off of Game Boy and live drum segments.

1688
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:35,000
A pretty good show. Just a tiny little house party for New Year's.

1689
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:45,000
And one of their friends created this very quick little visualization demo that uses the Kinect to, you know, it uses the 3D, the point field,

1690
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:50,000
all of the features of the Kinect to create this reactive visualization.

1691
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:58,000
He implemented the ability to take the object and manipulate it in 3D space as far as the output is concerned.

1692
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:07,000
And then obviously you have control of the Kinect's tilt and how much of the space it actually, it will actually display.

1693
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:15,000
For all of the grief that I've given Kinect, as far as what it's capable of doing and representing, it's actually really good.

1694
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:23,000
This kind of thing, I wouldn't think that it'd be applicable to the granularity of a face, but from the right distance, why not?

1695
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:29,000
I really enjoy hearing about these applications that are practical and promising at the same time.

1696
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Well, we've heard about Kinect being used by doctors. I mean, maybe not like hooked up to an Xbox or anything, but like, you know, that technology in PCs, you know, pretty awesome.

1697
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:46,000
All right, let's move on. Travel around the world and check out maybe some more affordable video games coming to a store near you. We'll start in the U.S., Loki.

1698
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,000
This week is Devil May Cry on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1699
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Woo!

1700
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
That's it.

1701
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
First big release of the New Year, though, right?

1702
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Hey, Anarchy Reigns came out last week.

1703
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that. That's right, that's right. Shame on me.

1704
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
I've been told I need to play that.

1705
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,000
The game with potentially Bayonetta if you bought it from GameStop.

1706
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Really?

1707
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Yeah, only from GameStop.

1708
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Oh, how nice.

1709
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Thank you, Sega! Fuck you and your goddamn GameStop shit. You're going the route of Nintendo now.

1710
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:20,000
All right, let's go to the Xbox 360 releases in Japan.

1711
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Japan also gets Devil May Cry this week, kind of one of those rare multi-regions in the same week.

1712
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Also, a game called Heavy Fire Shattered Spear makes its way to Japan this week. Both those games out on the 17th.

1713
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, of course, as you can expect, Devil May Cry is out there as well.

1714
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Dream Seat Club Zero, special... it's not edition, they have EDP on or something. They do a little stylization, I think, when that comes out this week on the PS3.

1715
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Blade Storm, the Hundred Years War gets a price reduction. Little Big Planet Karting hadn't come out in Japan until now.

1716
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,000
It's finally coming out this week. With that comes the Move Racing Wheel.

1717
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:03,000
And some games moving into the best series, including Sengoku Musou 3, Empires.

1718
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Because, you know, they love their Dynasty Warriors.

1719
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:15,000
On the Vita this week, WRC 3, Fia World Rally Championship is the lone release this week on the PlayStation Vita.

1720
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:23,000
On the Wii U, nothing until January 31st. It's pretty dry over there with new releases, just like it is here.

1721
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Nothing on the 3DS either, so Nintendo's really slowed down this time of year, but same story over here, I guess.

1722
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
How about the UK, Dark Sakura?

1723
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Well, I would tell you if the site was actually loading.

1724
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Oh, wow.

1725
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Come on, you butt-head.

1726
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Yes, I said butt-head. I called a website a butt-head.

1727
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
I think I got it here. What's this?

1728
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
No, no, no, it loaded.

1729
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:52,000
On the 15th we have Devil May Cry on the 16th Retro City Rampage.

1730
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,000
And, yeah, that's it.

1731
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Slim pickins no matter where you live, but it's gonna take a month for things to really ramp up again.

1732
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Devil May Cry is still a pretty big deal, so there you go.

1733
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys in the Classic Game of the Week. Loki.

1734
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:16,000
So, indie game developers are saying positive things about the Wii U eShop

1735
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:20,000
as opposed to what they were saying with the WiiWare service.

1736
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Apparently, Gaijin Games, Mike Rouse and Alex Neuse were saying that

1737
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:31,000
we don't know for sure, but it felt like it wasn't taken seriously by Nintendo.

1738
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:35,000
The desire for gamers to buy stuff digitally, and they're talking about, of course, the WiiWare service.

1739
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:42,000
However, they're saying literally everything was easier this time around on the eShop.

1740
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:50,000
What's more friendly right out of the starting gate is the Wii U is developed for people to have an eShop

1741
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,000
to spend their money in and buy games easily.

1742
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:59,000
So, I don't know. I mean, cool that they're doing some more stuff.

1743
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:03,000
I mean, I don't know how this compares to, say, other platforms,

1744
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,000
but at least they're doing better than they were before.

1745
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:13,000
I mean, that's like, I don't know, maybe going to the dollar store instead of Kmart.

1746
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:18,000
I mean, I don't know if that's, you know, oh, well, it's not as crappy as Kmart,

1747
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:23,000
but it's still pretty crappy, but it's not as crappy.

1748
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:27,000
So, I don't know how it really compares.

1749
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,000
I'm still encouraged by some of these early things I'm hearing about the Wii U eShop

1750
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
and that maybe we're going to see some really cool things on it.

1751
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
I don't know. Do these indie developers get some preview codes

1752
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:40,000
so they can get them sent out for reviews, unlike the Xbox indie games?

1753
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Maybe. I don't know. I don't get those types of reviews, so I don't know.

1754
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:49,000
But I can tell you, I'm looking forward to the Zen pinballs coming out on the Wii U,

1755
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:52,000
and that looks to be really cool, because they've got a Plants vs. Zombies table.

1756
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
That would be neat.

1757
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Anyhow, speaking of Nintendo, one of the big stories from last year

1758
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:01,000
was that Nintendo Power shut down after all these years.

1759
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Well, the spirit of sorts lives on with Nintendo Force Magazine.

1760
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:11,000
It is a new product from a group of Nintendo-focused journalists and artists.

1761
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Don't read into that that it was like the old Nintendo Power team,

1762
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
because that's not the case.

1763
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:19,000
It's other types of journalists and fans from around the Internet.

1764
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,000
They have released Nintendo Force Magazine.

1765
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Here's the thing, though. It's not your typical magazine.

1766
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:34,000
It is one that you can get in PDF form for $5, or you can get a collectible print for $18.

1767
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:38,000
I'm assuming, I'm left to assume, maybe Dark Soccer knows more about this stuff than I do,

1768
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:42,000
but I'm left to assume that probably because there isn't a huge demand for this,

1769
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,000
like it's not an international magazine or whatever, it's something that's more homegrown,

1770
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:51,000
to kind of print these in a much smaller supply probably costs a little more money,

1771
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:56,000
and that's why it's going to cost you $18 to get an actual printed copy version of this.

1772
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:01,000
In the first issue, though, Fire Emblem Awakening and Mutant Mudds Deluxe,

1773
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,000
which is apparently a thing on 3DS or Wii U coming soon.

1774
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
So there you go.

1775
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,000
All right, let's travel to a simpler time in games.

1776
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Let's go back to a time when, like, Nintendo Power was still around.

1777
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:19,000
It's the classic game of the week where Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault,

1778
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:25,000
and she's going to find a game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful brats, put down your Wii Us.

1779
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
And mow my lawn.

1780
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Mow my lawn, and then maybe I'll let you play this game.

1781
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Maybe you'll go get a phosphate.

1782
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:36,000
This game isn't super old, but believe it or not, it's getting old.

1783
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Yeah, that's why I picked it.

1784
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
What is the classic game of the week, Dark Cyra?

1785
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Silent Hill 3.

1786
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Because I've done Silent Hill 2, but I haven't done my favorite, so now I'm doing my favorite.

1787
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Um, yeah, I picked the perfect thing to start off with, didn't I?

1788
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
At least it wasn't bong.

1789
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:58,000
At any rate, Silent Hill 3 was done by Konami.

1790
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
We all know this.

1791
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Developed by Team Silent.

1792
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,000
And it came out in May 2003.

1793
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Now that it's, well, not quite ten years old, but getting up to ten years old,

1794
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:15,000
so, um, I can do it.

1795
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:21,000
There was also a port to Windows done that I heard was absolutely wretched and haven't played yet.

1796
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,000
And then a high def version that came out in 2012, but it's shit.

1797
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,000
So it's 17 years after the original Silent Hill.

1798
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Um, and basically he's raising Heather, who really isn't named Heather,

1799
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:42,000
but she's going by that name, and she's got an interesting haircut and dyes her hair blonde.

1800
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:47,000
She also does very interesting coordination with her jacket.

1801
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:57,000
So in this one, like other Silent Hill games, there are different aspects to the game.

1802
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:01,000
There is combat, you have exploration, and you have puzzle solving.

1803
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:06,000
You know, as in little riddles to solve as you go through the game.

1804
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:12,000
And of course picking up maps and bonuses for doing certain things in the game the right way.

1805
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:16,000
You, um, can change the difficulty of your puzzles.

1806
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Um, they're pretty, pretty difficult though, some of them can be.

1807
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:29,000
And like even the really hard puzzle in that one requires that you know quite a bit of Shakespeare to solve.

1808
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:34,000
You also get unlockable weapons and costume, which my favorite is the magical girl costume,

1809
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:40,000
where she does Heather beam, or as I say, has a beam, because even in the American version,

1810
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:46,000
she still, she has a very thick Japanese accent for just that attack.

1811
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:57,000
So you start off in the game at the mall, and then Claudia finds out she's being stalked by a guy in a trench coat.

1812
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:01,000
And then she goes and finds her dad.

1813
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:05,000
I won't say what he's like, because if you haven't played it by now, he's dead.

1814
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:09,000
And then she goes into Silent Hill. Yay!

1815
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:14,000
And there's like this whole plot to Rebirth of God.

1816
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:19,000
It has a lot to do, like I said, it's technically the sequel to the first Silent Hill.

1817
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
It continues that story.

1818
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:24,000
It has very, very interesting creatures in that game too.

1819
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:32,000
And there's also a dude named Vincent, who isn't as cool as Vincent Valentine, but I won't go there.

1820
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:36,000
So like I said, there's three endings. You have the normal ending.

1821
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:47,000
You have a possessed ending and the revenge ending, which the revenge ending is actually the UFO ending.

1822
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:52,000
That has the best Silent Hill song ever, Silent Hill no Uta.

1823
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Silent Hill, Silent Hill, anyway.

1824
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:01,000
I know I've done it as a fortune cookie before, but I'm not doing it tonight.

1825
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:12,000
So yeah, Silent Hill 3 is seriously my favorite of the Silent Hill games, because I love how much work went into it.

1826
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:17,000
There's actually a full documentary on the making of this game that you can find on YouTube.

1827
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Where they went all out for the voice acting.

1828
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:26,000
They went all out for face models for the rendering of the animations.

1829
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
It was really, really well done.

1830
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:36,000
And then there's also another note that it was influenced by Jacob's Ladder.

1831
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Lots of different facets from that and other horror stories were incorporated into the game as influences.

1832
01:43:46,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Like I was talking about the face models, they actually were drawn from references to real life actors and actresses so that they would look realistic.

1833
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:07,000
The original name for Heather was actually Helen, but she was renamed Heather for her voice actress.

1834
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:14,000
And she was modeled after a French actress, actually a couple of them, after Charlotte Gainsborough.

1835
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:20,000
And another one that's actually very familiar to us, Vanessa Paradis, who was married to Johnny Depp for a while.

1836
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:25,000
And did a very, very, actually a few really good songs.

1837
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:34,000
So yeah, there was also now that Silent Hill Revelation 3D, which we were supposed to go see and never did, was based off of Silent Hill 3.

1838
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
There's always Blu-Ray.

1839
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Yeah, the Blu-Ray's gotta be out really soon.

1840
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
I'm totally getting it. So yeah, there you go. Silent Hill 3.

1841
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:49,000
And the source game for one of my favorite songs in DDR Extreme US.

1842
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Oh, the...

1843
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,000
You're Not Here.

1844
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Yeah, I'm like, I can sing it, I don't know the name.

1845
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
It was really good, the video and everything else, really good chart.

1846
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:01,000
That was one of the better things to come out of Extreme US.

1847
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Not that that was a bad game, all things considered.

1848
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Minus the crappy disc wheel. It was a really, really good game.

1849
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
There is your classic game of the week.

1850
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
And classic DDR reference of the week.

1851
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Yes, exactly. We have DDR references coming up in part B tonight.

1852
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:19,000
So don't go anywhere. We've got more Orange Lounge Radio to come, including apparently a DDR reference.

1853
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Fugu question of the week, rapid fire news, your emails and your phone calls.

1854
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:26,000
All when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1855
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live with episode number 489 of our show for this January the 13th of 2013.

1856
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Myself, Loki and DarkSakura are joined in studio tonight with Jason and Rai, who are visiting Colorado as they have been.

1857
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:54,000
And Jason, of course, I always like to acknowledge that without Jason, we wouldn't have an OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1858
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,000
So thank you to Jason for all the work he does with that.

1859
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:06,000
During the break, usually we don't talk about the break music because we can't play it due to copyright reasons.

1860
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,000
But I've got to give a plug to this guy so the podcasters can sneak him out too.

1861
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Because that remix that we played was great.

1862
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
So please give this guy a plug here where everybody can hear it.

1863
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Aethernaut's original works are on Bandcamp.

1864
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Aethernaut.bandcamp.com.

1865
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Same username on Soundcloud.

1866
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,000
That remix is one since it's obviously not his originally.

1867
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,000
You can get that on Soundcloud.

1868
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Soundcloud.com slash Aethernaut.

1869
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Let me, for the sake of the podcasters, let me play just a clip here.

1870
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Because I can do clips.

1871
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Let me play a clip of his remix of the moon during the break that I was like, wow, this guy is like really cool.

1872
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,000
So what's that website again, the Bandcamp site, right?

1873
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
His Bandcamp is Aethernaut.bandcamp.com.

1874
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:54,000
This song in particular, Soundcloud.com slash Aethernaut.

1875
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,000
A-E-T-H-E-R-N-A-U-T.

1876
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Correct.

1877
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Nice stuff.

1878
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Good times. Good pick.

1879
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
I should let you pick the break music every week.

1880
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Woo!

1881
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Alright, or was that, or was that, who discovered Aethernaut, was that right?

1882
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
It was basically mutual.

1883
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
That's the right answer.

1884
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,000
We went to a Chiptune showcase, we were both there, and we were both like, fuck yeah, dude.

1885
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Alright, very good.

1886
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:21,000
And it was mine that I was playing while we were doing stuff before the show over here.

1887
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Yeah, she was the one that actually had music running.

1888
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
She got it introduced to me.

1889
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Yes.

1890
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Alright.

1891
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,000
She'll get credit for that one.

1892
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,000
You guys have good taste.

1893
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Alright, let's move on.

1894
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Rapid Fire news time.

1895
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Some quick news stories, starting off with Loki.

1896
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Alright, so this is kind of cool.

1897
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,000
They have this, they have this, they have this, they have this.

1898
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:47,000
They have this mod for Minecraft, and it allows someone to actually connect multiple worlds together.

1899
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Now, they have this before where you can create multiple kind of worlds in Minecraft, but this is actually unifying servers.

1900
01:47:54,000 --> 01:48:06,000
And the guy that developed this, was it, I guess it's the MD5 proxy system, which is now called Bungee Cord, if you look for it on the bucket.

1901
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Basically, he has it set up now.

1902
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:14,000
He's got a server with a lobby that allows, you know, like 2,000 people in there.

1903
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:21,000
And instead of, you know, searching for Minecraft servers and stuff that might be full, you go in this lobby and you pick a server out of there.

1904
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,000
And you get all the information.

1905
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:27,000
So it's almost like an MMO now where you can hop in and out of these servers and go, like, with your friends.

1906
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Like, say, hey, you know, I'm going to go build on the VoG Minecraft server right now, and then let's hop out.

1907
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,000
We're going to go to a server that's running, like, the Hunger Games minigame stuff.

1908
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Or, hey, I want to run to a server that's doing, like, you know, survival or something like that instead of creative.

1909
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
And you can do that, which is pretty awesome.

1910
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:48,000
So it's out there.

1911
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Not something I'm going to run on the Minecraft or our Minecraft server because we have enough trouble filling up one server, let alone multiple servers.

1912
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
And our server is whitelist only, which is important.

1913
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:01,000
But I think that makes it very attractive to play on because you don't get griefers.

1914
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Because if any of our listeners turn into griefers, I will beat you.

1915
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:08,000
And also I log, you know, it's logging whatever you do.

1916
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,000
So we will find you.

1917
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,000
I dig holes.

1918
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Don't be afraid to have fun.

1919
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Yeah, exactly.

1920
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,000
I mean, you know, I have rules listed.

1921
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Come on.

1922
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:20,000
It's just like I'll let you do whatever as long as you don't fuck up someone else's shit.

1923
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:27,000
You know, just do I have a sign now in my little I don't even know where you are, so I haven't added yet.

1924
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
So I live in a prairie dog town.

1925
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Well, once I find you, I'll add you or I'll show you how to do it.

1926
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
I'll put nasty notes in front of your house.

1927
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
My house is underground.

1928
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Which means you'll have to log in and finish your house.

1929
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Well, I can make it snow in her house.

1930
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
No, because my house is underground.

1931
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,000
My house is covered.

1932
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
My doors are covered in glass.

1933
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Can I can I get lava to flow through her house?

1934
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Oh, that's griefing.

1935
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
You can make it snow in her house, actually.

1936
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Ah, there we go.

1937
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
No snow in my house.

1938
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:58,000
We're not going to.

1939
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:01,000
My house is going to be constantly evolving, which is why I'm building it underground.

1940
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,000
All right. So that's kind of cool.

1941
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:09,000
And then Sony is actually kind of following the footsteps of Microsoft,

1942
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:14,000
and they're going to have a web based store for the Sony Entertainment Network.

1943
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,000
So you can actually buy stuff and, you know, download it.

1944
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,000
They're working on automatic downloading to go with that.

1945
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
But it's kind of cool that they're doing that.

1946
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,000
So you can browse.

1947
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Welcome to 2007 Sony.

1948
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:28,000
About fucking time.

1949
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:34,000
I mean, I guess I guess they had to scrap all their plans when they rebuilt the whole fucking PSN a few years ago.

1950
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,000
But Jesus.

1951
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:38,000
And then finally, there's another bundle that you might be interested in.

1952
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
This is called the free bundle.

1953
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:46,000
And basically, regardless of what you might want to pay for this bundle, it's free.

1954
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:50,000
And you can pick up five games from the free bundle dot com.

1955
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:56,000
And these games are Nitronic Rush, which is a cool survival driving game.

1956
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
A Bobo's Big Adventure.

1957
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Yes, that's right. A Bobo from...

1958
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Downloaded it.

1959
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Yes, from Double Dragon.

1960
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:06,000
And also, let's see, Ascension.

1961
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:10,000
It's a side scroller horror game, a celestial mechanical.

1962
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:17,000
And see, that's, I guess, has some animation done by Super Crate Box, his Paul Veer.

1963
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:24,000
And then I'm Scared, which they say is a self professed Minecraft meets Slender game.

1964
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,000
I was looking at it. I didn't want it.

1965
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:30,000
But they're all free for a limited amount of time.

1966
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Were you scared?

1967
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
No, I was apathetic.

1968
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:38,000
So the free bundle, in case, you know, the humble bundle is too expensive for you.

1969
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
You know what the free bundle needs more of?

1970
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Because this game's free?

1971
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Frog Fractions. Just saying.

1972
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Alright.

1973
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:48,000
And look, they added another game to the free bundle.

1974
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Now they have Treasure Adventure Island.

1975
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Or Treasure Venture Game.

1976
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
So, that's cool.

1977
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Go download it for free.

1978
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
And it's up for another 32 days.

1979
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Alright, well if you like to let video game consoles have an influence on your car buying purchases, then maybe this car is for you.

1980
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:10,000
It's an official Xbox 360 car from Volkswagen.

1981
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,000
That's right.

1982
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Oh, it's only available in Mexico, however.

1983
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Act EFT. There you go, buddy.

1984
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Buy it, send pictures, please.

1985
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Well, there's a little picture here. I mean, this is more of a render, but it actually has like the little Xbox stripe along the bottom and it's like that green color or what have you.

1986
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:36,000
If you buy this, by the way, should you buy the Volkswagen Xbox 360, you get an Xbox 360 with a copy of Forza 4. What a deal.

1987
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Wow, Forza from like, not 2012, but from the year before that.

1988
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Which I think is like a packing game now in some of their systems.

1989
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Earlier, somebody brought up Bayonetta, probably because you were talking about the anarchy reigns.

1990
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:58,000
But Bayonetta, a lot of demand for Bayonetta to show up on the Wii U eShop because of the fact that Bayonetta 2 is going to turn up on Wii U.

1991
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:05,000
And people aren't necessarily going to be familiar with it unless they had a 360 or a Playstation 3 and played through that.

1992
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:13,000
So, Platinum Games Designer Hideki Kamiya was asked on Twitter, will the original Bayonetta come to Wii U?

1993
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:18,000
And the response, it's up to Sega or Ninty, which is Twitter speak for Nintendo.

1994
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:23,000
So, apparently it is completely up to Sega and Nintendo if that's going to happen or not.

1995
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
So, no pressure, make it happen.

1996
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Not going to happen.

1997
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Not going to happen, I agree.

1998
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:32,000
One more story, I had a few friends that were talking about this and I thought this sounded really cool.

1999
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:38,000
And I watched a little bit of it, but not as much as like Flaco Jones and some other people I know that listen to this show.

2000
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:50,000
It was the third annual Awesome Games Done Quick Marathon raised more than $327,000 raised during this marathon.

2001
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:54,000
I didn't see, what, did I miss, what charity did that go for?

2002
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:00,000
I want to know, that's the most important part. Oh, Prevent Cancer Foundation. Oh, that's a very worthy cause, good job.

2003
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:06,000
They played through more than 120 titles, everything from Skyrim to Echo the Dolphin.

2004
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Good times.

2005
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:14,000
The viewers were also able to bid on items, make donations and leave comments that could have possibly been read on air.

2006
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Lots of good stuff that they played through and they did them quickly.

2007
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
It's not just a clever name.

2008
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Yoshi's Island in almost 100% in like three hours.

2009
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:29,000
They, they did, I mean, they did games that don't take necessarily that long to beat.

2010
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Like, um, I don't know, Mario 64, cause you could run through that without getting all the stars.

2011
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Although I don't know if they did 100% completion or whatever.

2012
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,000
And then they did Final Fantasy 9. Good lord.

2013
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,000
How do you do an RPG quick? I missed that one. I should try to find out.

2014
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
More A-mashing.

2015
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Alright, moving on.

2016
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
My laptop just died actually officially.

2017
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Oh.

2018
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Hold on, I got it to reboot.

2019
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Good times.

2020
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Yeah, it completely, uh, Linux doesn't blue screen, it black screens.

2021
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Alrighty then, maybe I should go to the FUGL question and we'll come back?

2022
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Maybe.

2023
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Alright, let's go to the FUGL question.

2024
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Put Facebook and Google together and you get FUGL.

2025
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:21,000
And that's the inspiration for this segment of our show where we ask a question of our listeners on Facebook and Google Plus fan communities.

2026
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:25,000
And we read some of our favorite answers here on the air.

2027
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Here's the question this week.

2028
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:36,000
There's been a lot of talk the past couple weeks about the potential and speculative emphasis on that negative influence that video games have on society.

2029
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,000
But let's take a moment to talk about the good.

2030
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:44,000
What are some of the good things that video games have done for you in your life?

2031
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:48,000
I wanted to offset all this negativity going around this week about, you know, violent video games.

2032
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,000
I want to hear the good stuff.

2033
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Let's give the media this to report on.

2034
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000
They won't.

2035
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:56,000
On Google Plus, some of the good things that video games have done for you.

2036
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Act deft.

2037
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
I'll summarize my answer in one word.

2038
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Inspire.

2039
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Flaco Jones says, my wife and I had video games in common at the early stages of our relationship, and they continue to be a positive thing we bond over to this day.

2040
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,000
That's really cute.

2041
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Thank you.

2042
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,000
You're a month early, Flaco.

2043
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:20,000
And even even Alan and I do that.

2044
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Like we leveled characters together and wow.

2045
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,000
All right.

2046
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,000
We met over DDR.

2047
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Me and Ryan met over DDR.

2048
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:33,000
But yet in Loki's relationship, that doesn't end up being the case, really.

2049
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
No, not at all.

2050
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
It just goes to show you everybody's a little bit different.

2051
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:39,000
All right.

2052
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:45,000
For you, the good things that video games did is it gives you an excuse to get away from your wife for a couple hours every week.

2053
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,000
I'm just kidding.

2054
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,000
I'm kidding.

2055
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
I love Nellie.

2056
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,000
She knows that.

2057
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,000
All right.

2058
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,000
I can't get away from her.

2059
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,000
She's always watching.

2060
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
She's probably listening right now.

2061
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,000
All right.

2062
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,000
No, she's not.

2063
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,000
No, come on.

2064
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,000
I don't understand.

2065
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,000
It's so nerdy.

2066
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,000
You're a nerd, Matt.

2067
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,000
All right.

2068
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Redertainment says video games fill a role in my life that other people fill with movies, TV, books, music, et cetera.

2069
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Video games ever entertain me.

2070
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Video games also save me money.

2071
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Think about how much entertainment you get per dollar with a 40 hour long video game as opposed to a two to four hour long movie.

2072
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,000
That's a very good answer.

2073
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
And then think of a book and weep.

2074
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,000
All right.

2075
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,000
All right.

2076
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
I love this answer in our chat room.

2077
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Bobby Black Wolf in our chat.

2078
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Video games let me meet all you wonderful people as well as act deft.

2079
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Ouch.

2080
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Ouch.

2081
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Going to Facebook.

2082
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,000
I've got my stuff up, by the way.

2083
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Okay.

2084
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Well, let me do Facebook and then we'll go back to Rapid Fire News.

2085
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,000
That's live radio, kids.

2086
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Sometimes you have to mix it up a bit.

2087
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Facebook Code Man says to be honest, video games keep me balanced.

2088
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:58,000
I use video games as a distressing mechanism.

2089
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
When I have a long day, I think that's de-stressing.

2090
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,000
De-stressing, yeah.

2091
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:02,000
It's not distressing.

2092
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,000
I'll blame autocorrect for that.

2093
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:06,000
It is via mobile, so it was probably autocorrect.

2094
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:10,000
When I have a long day at work and get home, I first greet my family and spend time with them.

2095
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:14,000
But if it's a crazy stressful day, I play video games a bit to de-stress.

2096
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:18,000
It's the same as a person who reads a book or watches their favorite shows.

2097
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
It calms them down and brings them to a better level.

2098
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:26,000
AZHP responds and says, video games introduced me to pretty much all the friends I have now in one way or another.

2099
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:32,000
When I decided to start playing DDR, I could have never have guessed that it would lead to me meeting a group of like-minded people

2100
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:39,000
who accepted me for who I am and created lifelong friendships that have lasted for, well, as long as this show has been running.

2101
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,000
It's true.

2102
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Without video games, I wouldn't have this show.

2103
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
I probably wouldn't be podcasting.

2104
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,000
I don't know.

2105
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:50,000
I like the sound of my voice so much, though, I would have think I would have discovered podcasting through, like, another hobby.

2106
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Who knows?

2107
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:55,000
I don't actually like hearing my own voice, so that's why I don't listen to us.

2108
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Really?

2109
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Yeah, no, it's true.

2110
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:01,000
I think that's why I was so timid, especially last time I was here.

2111
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:05,000
The tough thing, though, about it is that, like, I'm my own worst critic.

2112
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Like, I don't hate to hear my own voice, although, but I'll listen to myself and I'll go,

2113
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Ugh, you sound so...

2114
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,000
You should sound more...

2115
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
What the hell are we talking about?

2116
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
No, I'm actually...

2117
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
But anyway, let's see, more answers.

2118
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Wendy S.

2119
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:25,000
I think video games have taught me about the sports whose games I play, FIFA, NBA 2K.

2120
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:28,000
They also keep your mind and reflexes sharp as you grow older.

2121
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:36,000
I honestly believe, due to video games, there will be less dementia among seniors in the future if you assume current gamers will keep playing as they age.

2122
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Finally, I wanted to note that I think when teenagers attain positions of responsibility in their guild or clan, it teaches them leadership and responsibility.

2123
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:51,000
That's an interesting way to... I like the angle that, you know, it keeps your certain skills up so that when you get old, you don't lose them.

2124
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:54,000
You know, we see this a lot.

2125
01:59:54,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Well, I don't know how much you guys, like, go to old folks' homes, but they do, like, Wii bowling and that stuff is, like, still something they do.

2126
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:05,000
And a lot of that is to, I mean, we might, like, laugh, like, you know, play a better game, old guy.

2127
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:09,000
But it kind of still keeps all that function going.

2128
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:15,000
My grandma's in one of those places and I was looking at the calendar and they had a Wii bowling night every Monday. It was something else.

2129
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Alright, um...

2130
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:20,000
I wasn't laughing at you, I was laughing at a comment in chat.

2131
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
What was the comment that made you laugh? Who said it?

2132
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Raginator says, I agree with Rob Roberts. He does love the sound of his own voice.

2133
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
I'm sexy, damn it.

2134
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Not as much as I love Dubstep Bird.

2135
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Alright, um...

2136
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
I closed the window, damn it.

2137
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:44,000
James S. replies and says, I know I've read somewhere lately that there were a few scientific tests done by a university that had proven that gaming actually strengthened your brain in areas that are vital for everyday life.

2138
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Anything from basic motor skills to depth perception to decision making.

2139
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Games aren't the culprit for these random acts of violence.

2140
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Violence has always been there, gaming hasn't.

2141
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:56,000
It's just that some people are sick and need help, simple as that.

2142
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
You know, that's a really damn good way of looking at it.

2143
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Violence has always been there, gaming hasn't.

2144
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Although one could argue, you know, chess has been around a long time.

2145
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:07,000
But I get what you're saying. I totally get what you're saying, dude. That's a good point.

2146
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Alright, Dartetsuya says, even before you guys started OLR, there was a time?

2147
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Even before you guys started OLR, I met you guys via the epic music game Parties that were thrown back in early 2000.

2148
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Not gonna lie, I miss those days.

2149
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Playing B-Mania 2DX till the sun came up the next day, good times.

2150
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Oh, how many days we had like that, right Jason?

2151
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Do you still have a lot of those old games, Dark Sakura?

2152
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:38,000
I have every single Bimani game I've ever purchased.

2153
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:41,000
You know, one of these days for old time's sake, we need to have...

2154
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:44,000
That should be the freaking game marathon.

2155
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Have an old school DVR night.

2156
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Our pajama party?

2157
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,000
All night long.

2158
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Our pajama party?

2159
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Oh yeah, we're not supposed to talk about that on the air.

2160
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

2161
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Put the ixnay on the illo pipe fay.

2162
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
I didn't say anything about that.

2163
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Okay, I know, anyway.

2164
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
I think we should do a drunk DDR fest.

2165
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,000
That'd be awesome.

2166
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:11,000
I've played DDR drunk before and I nearly busted my head open on somebody's clothes washer.

2167
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:20,000
I was actually going through my closet today and I found two unused DDR pads from DDR Universe 1 and Universe 2.

2168
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
They're still folded up in there.

2169
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Why am I not... You're not coming through very loud. I don't know why. That's weird.

2170
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Sorry, am I not talking loud?

2171
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Now we are.

2172
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Anyways, yeah.

2173
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:39,000
I have two DDR pads. I think I sold the game, but I sold the pads that have never been used.

2174
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
They're still there.

2175
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,000
I wonder what else is there.

2176
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Oh, I also dug through the closet.

2177
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:54,000
There's a lot more game, like, main cabinet buttons and stuff from when I was going to make all the Bimani controllers and stuff for it.

2178
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,000
I have a ton of crap in there. It's ridiculous.

2179
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:05,000
We have a full-size pop-in controller still. We have, I think, four 2DX controllers.

2180
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Yeah, it should be two American, two Japanese.

2181
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:14,000
You know, I actually found an official Konami PlayStation dance pad at the thrift store.

2182
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:20,000
I got a DDR story coming up. We can reminisce more, but I want to get to what more listeners said.

2183
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Okay, just let me know when I can read my rapid fire.

2184
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
We'll get to it. I promise.

2185
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Okay.

2186
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:29,000
See, all I did is I just switched that with that and we'll just keep going.

2187
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Alright, live radio. It's an adventure.

2188
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Burr replies and says,

2189
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Video games have taught me history, given me an appreciation for music and art, introduced me to friends around the world, and inspired my imagination for almost 30 years now.

2190
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:48,000
What has watching endless cable television news and punditry done for the people on the other side of the table?

2191
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Hear, hear.

2192
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:50,000
That was like-

2193
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:51,000
Comedians?

2194
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:55,000
That was the appropriate level of bitchiness that an answer needs.

2195
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:59,000
That's, frame it. Cut, print. That's a great answer.

2196
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
All these answers are so good tonight.

2197
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:04,000
I'm reading them all. I don't care. This show's running long. I don't care.

2198
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
We'll do it live.

2199
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:06,000
Yeah, fuck it. We'll do it live.

2200
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Rageinator.

2201
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Well, here's three ways they help me.

2202
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:13,000
One, in terms of games like first person shooters, Call of Duty, Halo, they help me vent.

2203
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:17,000
If I'm pissed off at whomever, it's easier- it's better to take it out virtually-

2204
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Whom? Awesome.

2205
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:24,000
It's better to take it out virtually, rather IRL, for a whole host of reasons.

2206
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Two, gaming serves as a social outlet, contrary to what older generations would have you believe.

2207
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:33,000
And online gaming is a lot cheaper than other things, such as a night out drinking with friends.

2208
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Thank you.

2209
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Ain't that the truth.

2210
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Do you know how much drinks cost at the bar?

2211
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Yes.

2212
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:44,000
For like, I could get a Long Island iced tea top shelf or a month of wow. I get it. I get it.

2213
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Three, online gaming gives you an opportunity to meet other people that odds are you wouldn't otherwise meet.

2214
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Or conversely, it, like Facebook, helps you maintain friendships with those that move out of your area.

2215
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Unlike Facebook though, one can do more than talk via text.

2216
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Thank you.

2217
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Welcome. Alright, that was for Rageinator.

2218
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Tiger Claw says, Video games have been a part of my life ever since I was a kid.

2219
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:13,000
I know for a fact that you should never ever take video games seriously.

2220
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:19,000
They provided me with hours of entertainment, and also great during times when you're feeling down or bored.

2221
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Gamer Girl says, I suffer from major depressive disorder, and ever since I was a kid, it's been my way to shut things out till I'm ready to deal with them.

2222
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:28,000
This is a heavy answer.

2223
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:33,000
It's like a way for me to be someone else for a while, until I'm ready to deal with what's going on.

2224
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:37,000
And not only that, but it helped my reflexes as a kid due to being disabled.

2225
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:42,000
So it's always helped me deal with real life in some way or another, and always good.

2226
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:49,000
Why don't they fucking read that on Fox News?

2227
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Because it doesn't suit their agenda.

2228
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Sorry, I just had this moment of like, I'm angry now.

2229
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:01,000
I'm not angry at you, Gamer Girl. I think you're great.

2230
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:05,000
That answer is just so powerful.

2231
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:09,000
It's like, I'm speechless.

2232
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
It bears repeating, doesn't it?

2233
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Gamer Girl, you got me to shut up. Congratulations. You got me to shut up with that answer.

2234
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:20,000
I've been trying that for years.

2235
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Lastly, DDR Dollar Bill.

2236
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:26,000
If it wasn't for DDR, I wouldn't have become more social and outgoing.

2237
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
But this is heavy stuff, guys.

2238
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Too long to tell this story, but the game was responsible for reigniting my desire for dancing and music.

2239
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:38,000
I do love gaming, though I do want a future where games are more interactive.

2240
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Wait for the usual crap about go play football or some other sport.

2241
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
Just not where the game is bad.

2242
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:46,000
A fighting game that you actually have to move?

2243
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Well, the holodeck's only a matter of time away.

2244
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
I read every single answer tonight.

2245
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
You don't have to visit Facebook or Google. Those are all great answers.

2246
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Maybe there'll be some late-coming answers later.

2247
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
You should still join our communities on Facebook.

2248
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google Plus.

2249
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Search for Orange Lounge Radio.

2250
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
You wanna know what my answer to that one is?

2251
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:10,000
And it's very specific.

2252
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:14,000
Super Mario RPG taught me rhythm before anything else did.

2253
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Really?

2254
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Yeah, it's the simplest story and it's the funniest little thing, but I came to this realization not long ago

2255
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:25,000
and now that I'm all music-oriented, my brain is starting to work in that manner.

2256
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:32,000
I've listened to music, I've heard it, whatever, but I guess the finer points of music and music theory?

2257
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:36,000
The bonus game on Yoster's Isle where the Yoshis race.

2258
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:39,000
The first time I tried it, AB, AB, AB, AB, mash the buttons.

2259
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Why isn't it doing anything?

2260
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:48,000
And one of the Yoshis gives you a hint or something like that talks about that you go with the backbeat of the song.

2261
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:53,000
It's like, oh, look at that. Alternate in time and your Yoshi runs away.

2262
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:57,000
And it was just like the simplest thing, but that was what really sealed the deal.

2263
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:02,000
Music games came along after the fact to really turn that into its own little world,

2264
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:10,000
but that was the first time that music had something specific instead of just being the art as it is.

2265
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
It's really the only way that I can describe it.

2266
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:20,000
I remember that very distinctly, that things just felt different after an example of the backbeat in Super Mario RPG.

2267
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:25,000
For me, video games gave me this.

2268
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
I mean, for real. I know we joked about it a minute ago.

2269
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Video games gave me this.

2270
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:34,000
And this is almost an extension of when I was growing up, I got picked on a lot.

2271
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:35,000
I can't imagine why.

2272
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:40,000
But for real, guys, I got called fag and all those dirty words you can possibly imagine a lot.

2273
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:44,000
And then it's like those same kids would turn around and ask me for advice on video games.

2274
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Like, how do I get to the second quest in Zelda?

2275
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Or how do I find level nine in the second quest?

2276
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Like, come meet me behind the building.

2277
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:54,000
That type of thing where it's like, I don't want the other kids to see that I'm talking to you,

2278
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
but I know you're the video game expert.

2279
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:00,000
And in some ways, this is almost an extension of that.

2280
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
I'm still talking to people about video games.

2281
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:08,000
I might not be as good at them as I used to be, but here I am with a bunch of awesome, like-minded people.

2282
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
It's just great.

2283
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:11,000
I know.

2284
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
I know. I know. Especially you, Jamie.

2285
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Especially me.

2286
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Well, in an extension on the inspiration part, it has me writing, it has me drawing.

2287
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:23,000
You know, there's so much that it brings.

2288
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:27,000
And yeah, go read a book. A book will do the same thing.

2289
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:34,000
But I think just the visual part of it, having somebody else's characters that you can kind of run free with kind of helps too.

2290
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Absolutely.

2291
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Original works, original inspirations.

2292
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:43,000
All right, before we get back into Jamie's rapid fire news stories, anything else anyone wants to share on that topic?

2293
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Um, no.

2294
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
All right, let's get back to rapid fire news.

2295
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:48,000
I would like a pony.

2296
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Not really.

2297
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
You can't have a pony. You can play Barbie Horse Adventures.

2298
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
I'm actually super allergic to horses, so I really don't want a pony.

2299
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
You can have a virtual pony.

2300
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
So how about Marvel Super Heroes?

2301
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Derby Owners Club.

2302
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,000
And Legos.

2303
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
I miss Derby Owners Club.

2304
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Um, they got rid of the one at Dave & Buster's.

2305
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Oh, sad.

2306
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,000
I didn't see it last time I was there.

2307
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Do you still have your card with your horse named Glue?

2308
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,000
I have my binder.

2309
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Nice.

2310
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Yeah, I do have a horse named Glue.

2311
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
You had Politary.

2312
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
So you could whip Politary.

2313
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Politary is sad because Rob beat her too hard.

2314
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,000
Um, anyway.

2315
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Um, so Lego Marvel Super Heroes is going to be coming out.

2316
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:28,000
And, I'm very happy.

2317
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:35,000
It's got an original storyline where Nick Fury needs the help of Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and other heroes to stop Loki and Galactus.

2318
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:38,000
That's a team I would never have seen together, Loki and Galactus.

2319
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:43,000
I would think Galactus would be too busy eating planets to deal with the, you know, Norse God.

2320
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Whose planet he wants to eat.

2321
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Also next up, Capcom Arcade Cabinet has been confirmed for the West.

2322
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Ooh.

2323
02:10:54,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Um, basically it's a platform for Xbox Live Arcade and PSN that will be coming in the US.

2324
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:05,000
And we should be seeing more information on it on February 7th as far as what games are coming out.

2325
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:08,000
But one of the confirmed games is Black Tiger for the US release.

2326
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
As well as Japan.

2327
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Dan will be happy.

2328
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Dan will be really happy.

2329
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
So basically it's Game Room.

2330
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
But it's only Capcom.

2331
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Capcom.

2332
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:24,000
And then, last but not least, LittleBigPlanet 2 Extras Edition is announced.

2333
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:32,000
And, um, it will have the, uh, recently, um, released cross controller pack.

2334
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:37,000
So that's used the Vita as a controller and the move pack, Rise of the Kaling.

2335
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
And all kinds of fun stuff.

2336
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:43,000
And, uh, however, I don't believe it has what date it's gonna be out on.

2337
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
So yeah, that's it.

2338
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
Alright.

2339
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:50,000
And now I got more stuff to do, don't I?

2340
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Uh, no. We'll go to Loki next.

2341
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Well, I got stuff to do.

2342
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Soon. Soon.

2343
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Yes.

2344
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:08,000
So, um, there was, of course, this lawsuit in place, um, from Gamefly who was saying they were getting unfair treatment for their, um,

2345
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
you know, their packages going out.

2346
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Because Netflix and, I guess, Blockbuster Online were getting sorted manually, um, through the postal system.

2347
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Whereas their stuff was not.

2348
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
It was going through machines and those were breaking discs.

2349
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:31,000
In fact, there was actually some, uh, there was a screenshot or a photo of this, like, you know, bin that says Netflix and Blockbuster DVDs.

2350
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
Doesn't say Gamefly DVDs.

2351
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Um, and so it actually, they ruled in favor of Gamefly and, um, basically told, you know, the US Postal Service that,

2352
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:49,000
hey, you guys need to either fix this or you need to let us know, you know, tell us what's going on.

2353
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
Why are you guys doing this?

2354
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:59,000
I mean, it's obvious that, you know, that you're doing this stuff and, you know, these companies aren't paying you any extra money to have this preferential treatment.

2355
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Now, you either gotta do it for everybody or you're gonna do it for no one.

2356
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
So, interesting.

2357
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Um, hopefully that means less broken DVDs in the mail.

2358
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:15,000
I don't know, have you ever gotten anything from, you know, Gamefly that was smashed?

2359
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:16,000
No.

2360
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Yeah, so.

2361
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
Everything's worked fine for me.

2362
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Maybe it's just, like, more metropolitan areas, you know, where there's a lot more mail.

2363
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Maybe.

2364
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
I live in an apartment complex, you know.

2365
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:32,000
It's not like they handle the mail totally well around here sometimes, but it works.

2366
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Um, moving on, I promised you some DDR talk.

2367
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Here you go.

2368
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:41,000
Dance Dance Revolution Classroom Edition made an appearance at CES this year.

2369
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Konami and United Healthcare Group teaming up to bring this.

2370
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:48,000
I thought that was kind of an interesting partnership between Konami and an insurance company.

2371
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Uh, but they brought the game to the show to show it off.

2372
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Um, I gotta tell you what surprised me about it is that it was neat kind of seeing, like, new DDR.

2373
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:00,000
And I was looking at it going, why did they, like, stop the console editions?

2374
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Like, this is an interesting direction that they were going.

2375
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,000
I mean, granted, DDR is DDR, but I thought it was kind of cool.

2376
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:08,000
I mean, 48 people can play this game at once.

2377
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:11,000
That's, like, two PE classes or depending on whatever school you go to, right?

2378
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Um, and you look at it and they've got one, you know, one tunnel or what do you call that?

2379
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:20,000
The area where the notes scroll up.

2380
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:24,000
Do they ever have a term for that? The scroll bar? Whatever.

2381
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
The area where the notes scroll up, there's three of them.

2382
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:30,000
One for beginners, intermediates, and advanced all at the same time.

2383
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:34,000
So I'm assuming that means that people who aren't as good as DDR can play, like, the beginner ones

2384
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:38,000
and people who are getting better can play the advanced ones so that everybody can kind of play together.

2385
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
I thought that was kind of neat.

2386
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Um, apparently the wireless dance pads are made by Performance Design Products

2387
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:49,000
and they can actually track a dancer's progress, steps, body mass index,

2388
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:52,000
and how many calories you burn through what is a plug-in smart card.

2389
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
BMI is still bullshit.

2390
02:14:54,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Then why isn't PDP putting these out then for consumers to buy if they're making some decent dance pads, you know what I mean?

2391
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:06,000
I was kind of looking at it and going, this is something I wouldn't mind having in my house, actually.

2392
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:09,000
I could play with people over the internet or something.

2393
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Konami has launched this game three schools in Florida, Georgia, and Texas, I guess are the test ground for this.

2394
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:24,000
There is a whole video, it looks like Polygon actually did an interview on the floor with some of the people that were showing it,

2395
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
so you can check that out at polygon.com.

2396
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
They actually have a whole little video in their section.

2397
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Yeah, it was kind of neat to look at.

2398
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:34,000
It made me miss the dinner days a little bit. It did.

2399
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
There's a lot that's really interesting about that concept that makes sense.

2400
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:44,000
It throws out all of these, you know, expected mechanisms of DDR out the window that, who gives two shits about accuracy?

2401
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Pick whatever is interesting for you, change on the fly, and the important part of what you have to do is still available.

2402
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:57,000
You're still on a dance pad, you're still moving around, you're still doing something and getting that sort of feedback, but you're not,

2403
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:00,000
oh, I'm the triple A player of the town.

2404
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:10,000
It's weird, they kind of look like, of course they have the overly excited person working at the booth doing, oh, I'm doing this fancy dance work.

2405
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:20,000
But the pads themselves kind of look like a cross between the ignition pads where they're kind of thick, but they also are, it's that plastic cover on the top.

2406
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:28,000
The only thing I don't like about it is you can't tell, you drift on those types of pads when you can't tell where the actual arrows are versus everything else.

2407
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:33,000
But it would still be nice to buy one, you know, if it's going to work pretty well.

2408
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:37,000
Obviously, if you're using a PE class, it's got to work somewhat okay.

2409
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:43,000
And hell, I mean, we played on soft pads attached to a piece of wood with laminate over the top of them.

2410
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:49,000
I am assuming that that would work. It worked okay then.

2411
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Yeah, they did look like the ignition pads to me, because from a distance I thought they were metal pads, and I was like, damn, this thing's going to be expensive.

2412
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:07,000
But yeah, it was more the big, fluffy, but thick, those pads that Red Octane used to do before they got into guitar hero business.

2413
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:16,000
There you go. All right. So, moving on. Did your computer go boom again?

2414
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:20,000
All right, so let's move on to the next, let's just skip it and come back to it. Loki.

2415
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:29,000
All right. So, let's see, we've got an interesting patent for PlayStation.

2416
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Man, what is with PlayStation and coming out in some really strange ass patents.

2417
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:39,000
But this one now, they have got a patent for the Move. It looks like a new Move controller.

2418
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:48,000
And the differences with the new controller versus the old one, one that's going to have some sort of interchangeable face plates.

2419
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:58,000
So, for example, you can have the four directional buttons on there, or you can have the XO square triangle buttons.

2420
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:03,000
Also, it kind of looks like an ice cream scoop, almost.

2421
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
Well, they look like them anyway.

2422
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:13,000
Yeah, but instead of having the buttons actually on the side of the pad, your hand would be behind the ball, I guess.

2423
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:22,000
And what's also weird about it is they've got these foot attachment things and then in the most ridiculous image for a patent ever,

2424
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:32,000
they have some dude with like four Move controllers, because I'm going to really buy four Move controllers for $40 each, doing a fucking like flip kick for a soccer game.

2425
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:36,000
He's got those things like attached to his shoes. That is nuts.

2426
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Yes. Like, I mean, that's just fucking ridiculous. No one's going to do that. You're going to kill yourself.

2427
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:51,000
And then we're going to see that on Fox News. Video gamer kills self while playing FIFA, attempting to do a flip kick, hits, you know, coffee table, dies.

2428
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Or how about kicks the 80 inch television right off the wall.

2429
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Or somebody else nearby.

2430
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:02,000
You know, kickboxing game, Move controller flies off foot. Some weird shit happens.

2431
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Gamer loses leg in freak accident, kicking fan.

2432
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:15,000
Let's just put it this way. OK, I don't know why they're having some sort of this patent, but I hope that God, this is not this isn't what they're bringing for PlayStation four.

2433
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Hey, you like those Move controllers? Well, guess what? We're going to strap them to every orifice of your body.

2434
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:29,000
That's right. We're going to track all of those naughty bits. Does this really solve the very first sentences of this?

2435
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Sony recently filed a patent that describes a method for determining the location of a PlayStation Move like controller through a sound capturing device.

2436
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:44,000
If it's obscured by something in the way, like a body, if you're if you're spinning, if you're moving, the sound really solve the problem.

2437
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:58,000
That's how they do it right now. They've got it uses sound, I think, for part of it because they've got so many microphones in the actual like PlayStation eye camera that I thought that's what it was using.

2438
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:03,000
I thought it was just light like a special a special wavelength that the camera can see.

2439
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:06,000
It's a rotation, a little a little bit of both, I think.

2440
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:11,000
I do know that like for voice or something is supposed to be able to track you or track something.

2441
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:20,000
It's got like five microphones in that thing. I could just see cause variety three talking about, you know, now on the PlayStation four, it comes with four move controllers.

2442
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Let me show you a demo now. I will take one controller and put them in each hand and I will shake them up and down.

2443
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Then I will insert the third move controller into my mouth where I will rock back and forth the fourth move controller.

2444
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:36,000
I will shove into my anus. Let's play sing star.

2445
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:48,000
It just, I mean, I'm sorry.

2446
02:20:48,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Okay, here's the thing. Okay. The move controller, it's, I think the move is not that bad, but you know what they're showing with this patent here is basically, you know, they're saying that the controller has got some, you know, the swabble face buttons and stuff.

2447
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:10,000
And that, you know, I don't know, I don't think they really know much other than looking at the pictures, but those controllers look a little weird.

2448
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Um, and I know they've tried, you know, the leg strap stuff, how they've tried that with, you know, the Wii and like, I know they have some fitness games where you can get a leg strap so they can tell that you're, you know, running or something like that.

2449
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:31,000
But if this, I guess this thing, it was a determination of controller, three dimensional location using image analysis and ultrasonic communications.

2450
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:40,000
So I thought that's how it worked already though. I mean, I don't understand what they would be doing differently in this one.

2451
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Thank you. SSU and Hunter Matt for getting my reference is Mr. Garrison's gyro cycle thing in that episode of South Park.

2452
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:54,000
That's exactly what I was thinking about with the whole PlayStation move patent. Anyhow, it's for the best, Jason, that you don't watch it.

2453
02:21:54,000 --> 02:22:00,000
All right. Moving on. Let's go back to what we had to skip over. Jamie.

2454
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Okay. Um, the more news about the OUYA actually. Basically, they've figured out that since it already runs Android games, it will run emulated games too.

2455
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:19,000
So people who already have OUYA boards are, um, basically putting up videos that show them playing Street Fighter.

2456
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Street Fighter, Mario 64 are already running on the OUYA.

2457
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:27,000
I think I said this on the show when we bought our Wii, you know what the very first thing was that I did?

2458
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
Emulate. Played Mario 64.

2459
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Uh, yeah. Very yes to this. I am so excited. Actually, emulators might sell me to OUYA.

2460
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:38,000
And from based on the video, they run well.

2461
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Yeah. The video was not. I looked at it too. All I have to say. Oh yeah.

2462
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:52,000
You all right over there? Do you need a move controller to enhance the experience?

2463
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:58,000
No. I get the Mario 64 song stuck in my head and it lasts. It doesn't go away.

2464
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:02,000
I got Rob doing it.

2465
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:08,000
I hope it runs the 64 games. That means I can play F-Zero even though I can kind of...

2466
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:15,000
You know what that means? It means my cross crystal dreams. Because that game only exists emulated.

2467
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Sayin'. And Star Fox 2. If it'll do, um, SNES emulation. Ooh, Star Fox 2.

2468
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:29,000
You know what else it means? Yet another emulator with the most unworkable controller for the system with the most unworkable controller.

2469
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
Yes! Here it is running on the OUYA.

2470
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:43,000
Multiplayer golden eye over the internet. Yeah! That should be Android Pat possible. Come on.

2471
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:49,000
God, I wish. All right. Moving on. Where are we at? Oh, speaking of Virtual Console. What a nice transition.

2472
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:50,000
You're welcome.

2473
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:56,000
The Wii U Virtual Console games. They will be playable on the gamepad. You know, eventually.

2474
02:23:56,000 --> 02:24:06,000
A representative for Nintendo said that there is plans to make a Wii U Virtual Console game playable on the new controller solely.

2475
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Which of course has the touch screen on it. Not that the touch screen is going to do you any good.

2476
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:15,000
But it's still a way that you can, you know, you can have your Virtual Console game and you can play it on the TV.

2477
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:21,000
Or then somebody wants to watch Oprah or whatever. You can move it to the little device.

2478
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:27,000
Because currently they have, you know, the whole, like, was it, emulator running in an emulator.

2479
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Which I'm sure is fantastic for, you know, processing, you know, emulating an emulator.

2480
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:37,000
And I think, Loki, you are right on the money. I think certain DS games, it's just a matter of time before this happens.

2481
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:43,000
Why not? I mean, like, Pokemon Pearl would be a great game for this. Honestly. Perfect. Perfect game for this.

2482
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Because the bottom screen really isn't, it doesn't do a whole lot with the game.

2483
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
I have a better idea. I have a better idea.

2484
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:50,000
What?

2485
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:57,000
How about a native Wii U Pokemon title that features both screens at all times or as much as possible.

2486
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:58,000
You're funny. You're funny.

2487
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:06,000
I've got a crazy idea too. What if Pokemon X and Y came out for the 3DS and the Wii U.

2488
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:11,000
That you can buy your portable games on the Wii U.

2489
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:18,000
Or you can buy them on your 3DS and they are playable on the Wii U and the 3DS.

2490
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
That's madness though, I'm sure.

2491
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:25,000
Alright. Does that mean it's time for mailbag?

2492
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:26,000
I'm trying to get it to load.

2493
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:29,000
I'm all twisted up. I have it up if you need me as a backup.

2494
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
Do you want me to move on? We'll come back to mailbag?

2495
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:35,000
Okay. Let's... I'm just improvising tonight, y'all.

2496
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:40,000
Let's move on to the FUs of the week. What an appropriate time with computer issues to go to the FUs of the week.

2497
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:55,000
Music

2498
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
Need I ask Dar Sakura what she's mad about?

2499
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Fuck my nutbook. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it.

2500
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
May I have more chocolate?

2501
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:05,000
You absolutely may have more chocolate.

2502
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Thank you.

2503
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:07,000
It's in the fridge.

2504
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Uh, Loki.

2505
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:14,000
I feed myself for forgetting to mention that I gassed it up this week on the Down for Maintenance podcast with Code Man and friends.

2506
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Oh, shit. That's the whole reason you go on other podcasts is to promote your own appearance.

2507
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:21,000
Yes, but now I'm promoting my own appearance.

2508
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:25,000
You should mention it at the top of next week's show too. Give those guys some love.

2509
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
Will do. It was a lot of fun.

2510
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Alright, good deal. I haven't listened to the whole episode yet. I want to though.

2511
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:34,000
Uh, my FU of the week goes to Rush Limbaugh.

2512
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
Because, what an asshole.

2513
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
What an asshole.

2514
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:43,000
I'm not even going to repeat what he said. If you've been reading the news, you know what he said. What an asshole.

2515
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Don't Google it. Please. Don't give him more attention. He's an asshole. That's all you need to know.

2516
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Uh, Jason.

2517
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:53,000
I'll second that FU for you because I really don't have anything better.

2518
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:54,000
And it's always worth it.

2519
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:57,000
He's twice the asshole I thought he was.

2520
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Ry.

2521
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Fuck you to my job.

2522
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Fuck you to retail.

2523
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Fuck you to my boss.

2524
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:05,000
Yes.

2525
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
Store boss, not immediate boss.

2526
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Yes, store boss, not my immediate boss.

2527
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:11,000
I love my immediate boss.

2528
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:12,000
It matters.

2529
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:15,000
It's always the quiet ones that are the angstiest, doesn't it?

2530
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
Fuck it.

2531
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:23,000
Suddenly, she's become a level 64 renegade, so look out.

2532
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
Alright, uh, moving on.

2533
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:29,000
By the way, I finally found my favorite renegade option in Mass Effect 2.

2534
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:30,000
Yes.

2535
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Making the guy that poisons you drink his own drink.

2536
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:34,000
That was fun.

2537
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:35,000
Good times.

2538
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:36,000
I got mail up, by the way.

2539
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
You did get mail up. Oh.

2540
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Well then, you know what that means. I play the mail theme.

2541
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:43,000
And I talk about every week.

2542
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
Dark Soccer dives in the mail bag.

2543
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:48,000
And she pulls out a couple emails that she feels like reading.

2544
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:51,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.

2545
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:54,000
And you should send us more because we only got two emails this week.

2546
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:55,000
That is sad.

2547
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:59,000
That's actually a good thing that we only got two because it's so much easier to open on my iPad that way.

2548
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
That's true. But still.

2549
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:02,000
I had a backup.

2550
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:07,000
And probably I'm gonna be absent from chat for a while until I get a new laptop.

2551
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Sorry to hear that. You can always do it on your iPad.

2552
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:14,000
Do you know how much of a pain in the ass it is to switch between the screens and monitor chat?

2553
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
And have all this shit running?

2554
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:20,000
I could get my laptop out, you know. I do have one. It works, barely, but it works.

2555
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
This is an iPad too and it likes to stink.

2556
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:23,000
No.

2557
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:26,000
I have an iPad, uh, outdated in two months.

2558
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
At least I still offer, you know, updates for yours.

2559
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:31,000
Anyway.

2560
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Mailbag.

2561
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:33,000
At OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2562
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Dude, learn to spell grammar.

2563
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Okay.

2564
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Grammar is spelled G-R-A-M-M-A-R, not E-R.

2565
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:46,000
I have to say sorry about the grammar last email, maybe in this one, but one, I agree with Rob.

2566
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
I like Majora's Mask way better.

2567
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:51,000
I may have spelled it wrong, but you spelled it right, but you didn't capitalize anything.

2568
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:56,000
To be fair, I'm really happy you agree with me, but I think they're kind of both overrated.

2569
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Sorry, not sorry.

2570
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:04,000
Two, I didn't like Skyward Sword is cuz? No, that should be because.

2571
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:07,000
I didn't like the art direction. I like Twilight Princess's art style.

2572
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:10,000
I also hated how empty the sky world was.

2573
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:14,000
Also, how there was only like three different places to explore.

2574
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:17,000
Also, my biggest thing I dislike is the motion plus.

2575
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:21,000
It worked with Wii Sports Resorts, but not for a Zelda game.

2576
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
That was a whole sentence, by the way.

2577
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:29,000
Oh, and that came from, I guess, Chris, somebody. Chris is cool.

2578
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:41,000
I think I mentioned in November that I've started watching a lot of video game related videos on YouTube video series.

2579
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:47,000
Game Grumps, Continue Show, a lot of things by their friends.

2580
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:51,000
I'll watch one-off, two-off, but I'm really subscribed and dedicated to Game Grumps right now.

2581
02:29:52,000 --> 02:30:05,000
When they were playing the Zelda adventure game in Nintendo Land, they were saying that that whole game's play mechanics is better than the whole of Skyward Sword as far as Wii motion controls are concerned.

2582
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:16,000
I say that incidentally because I haven't actually played Skyward Sword, but I did play a bit of the Nintendo Land setup and it was quite fun.

2583
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:23,000
It was simple. I don't know how it expands to full screen Zelda, but it just seems fun.

2584
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:26,000
Okay, I guess I don't have a point to that spiel. Second email!

2585
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:29,000
Second email comes from Raginator.

2586
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:49,000
It's usually about random ass stuff related to physics.

2587
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:58,000
Well, all of that being said, I had an epiphany not too long ago related to physics, specifically about dark matter, and I'd like to write a thesis on it.

2588
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:05,000
However, I do have one hurdle to overcome. My math skills are not advanced enough to write the paper. I never took calculus.

2589
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:09,000
That was your first typo. Congratulations, your grammar has been astounding.

2590
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:12,000
He missed one of the E's in never. He spelled N-V-E-R.

2591
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:15,000
Sorry, I thought the email needed Warholic.

2592
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:24,000
Oh, and thoughts. Here's the next one. My thought here is to perhaps collaborate with someone in a university that has a working knowledge of physics and calculus.

2593
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:31,000
Now my questions for you are as follows. Does this route sound feasible to you and how would I go about this?

2594
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:35,000
I'm sure I can't very well just waltz in and say, hey, want to do a thesis with me?

2595
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:43,000
If my epiphany that I had works out as well as I think it will, it could be very well groundbreaking.

2596
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:48,000
Craigslist. Seriously?

2597
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:51,000
Sorry, one more time the question. Sorry, I got distracted.

2598
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Okay, he has an idea about writing a thesis, which I think your thesis is more what your idea would be.

2599
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:03,000
It would be the paper that you're trying to write about dark matter.

2600
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:12,000
I think that without knowing all of the mathematics and the science behind it, you're probably not in the best position.

2601
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:17,000
I would say start doing interviews. Call heads of, call deans of physics departments.

2602
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:22,000
Call various schools that are in your area and make an appointment to speak with people and ask them about it.

2603
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:28,000
Take a class here and there. Community colleges offer physics courses and talk to your teacher after class.

2604
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:34,000
If it's something that you're truly interested in doing, especially since you have tons of free time on your hand, fuck.

2605
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Go to school.

2606
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:43,000
See if it's something that maybe, you know, this isn't always a great substitute, but iTunes U has a lot of really interesting and diverse offerings out there.

2607
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
Oh, there are tons of physics podcasts.

2608
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:49,000
Take a peek. Yeah. Physics podcast. Great, great suggestion.

2609
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:55,000
Yeah, I've even listened to a few of them because they were actually interesting podcasts that combined physics with religion.

2610
02:32:55,000 --> 02:33:00,000
You can find them just as easily as you found this crap.

2611
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:03,000
They might fester a little less. Done.

2612
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Good, good feedback to our soccer. Good job. Despite your computer issues of the email back tonight, I must say.

2613
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:12,000
Hey, I'm trying. That's why I got this thing. It just doesn't work for running everything.

2614
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:16,000
All right. Let's jam through these couple last stories here and we'll get to the Skype line at one eight seven seven game.

2615
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:19,000
Oh, well, are not yet. Don't call yet, but we'll let you know.

2616
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:26,000
Loki. All right. So there was another tablet that was shown, you know, kind of a big gaming tablet.

2617
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:31,000
It was the razor project Fiona thing, which is now called Razor's Edge.

2618
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:40,000
If you may remember, that is the one that has the two like kind of nunchuck looking things that are attached to it or across with the nunchuck in the PlayStation move.

2619
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:43,000
It's got these like analog handle things, but now it is available.

2620
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:56,000
Actually, I should say it's available without that for thousand dollars for the base model, the I five one or twelve hundred or thirteen hundred dollars for the pro model, which is a core I seven.

2621
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:00,000
But this is a tablet actually runs PC stuff. It's got Windows eight on it.

2622
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:06,000
It's got, you know, a gaming card in it. In fact, actually, it's got a pretty high end Nvidia card in there.

2623
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:15,000
It's kind of a surprise about that, which I kind of brought up the point that so does this thing run as hot as like the surface of the sun?

2624
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:26,000
Because if it's got like, you know, some mobile 640 processor or something like that, I have no kind of clue how this thing would run.

2625
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:35,000
Cool. Fuck my laptop. I do all sorts of cooling mods to get the run somewhat cool and it still runs hot.

2626
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:40,000
I don't know. It's interesting. If you're interested, though, they are, I think, taking preorders for it.

2627
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:45,000
And I don't think they've announced a date when it's going to be available. But oh, I'm sorry.

2628
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:59,000
The base model is available now, but the pro models coming later and they're saying that the thirteen hundred dollar one can run dishonored at 60 frames per second,

2629
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:03,000
which I don't think that's that processor intensive of a game.

2630
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:09,000
So it's I don't know, but it's an option, I guess, if you really want to spend that kind of money.

2631
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:16,000
Honestly, though, if you're going to spend thirteen hundred dollars on something, you'll probably get a laptop that's just as nice for a lot cheaper.

2632
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Just saying you don't need a tablet for everything or you can actually I actually was looking.

2633
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:27,000
You can make your own tablet be fun. But will the tablet play this game?

2634
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:32,000
I'm about to talk about I guess it will. I'll say an Android, but it doesn't run Android.

2635
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Never mind. But you could run it anywhere. OK, like compatibility or something. All right.

2636
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:40,000
Anyhow, regardless, this is a game that was due to come out last week.

2637
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:45,000
I guess people have been demanding this. I didn't know there was a market, but OK.

2638
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:52,000
It's the spiritual successor to the game Shaq Fu. Yes, Shaq Fu. You heard me, Shaq. Like Shaquille O'Neal?

2639
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:57,000
Yeah. Shaq Down, a 2D side scrolling action game.

2640
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:03,000
It actually does star Shaq or Shaquille O'Neal, of course, came out for iOS and Android.

2641
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:08,000
In the game, you battle zombies across three stages and bosses and all that stuff.

2642
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:12,000
It was developed by Hiptic Games and published by One Spear Entertainment.

2643
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:15,000
Shaquille O'Neal is a major shareholder in One Spear Entertainment.

2644
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:21,000
So there you go. ShaqDown.com for more information, because I know you're all waiting for it.

2645
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:25,000
Three stages, man. Don't like, you know, overwork yourselves.

2646
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:30,000
I mean, that's just like a lot of content. That's so they can sell you stages four and five later.

2647
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:35,000
Why? Fuck that. That's how it works now. That's what that's what users want, Loki.

2648
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:39,000
Haven't you heard? That's what everybody said. That's what the users want.

2649
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:46,000
More Shaq games? I don't think that's what they say. Although they do have, you know, is it Shaq Fu?

2650
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:50,000
Was it, um, the, uh, the Skype line is open one eight seven seven game.

2651
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:54,000
Or a user name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio. Sorry, Loki.

2652
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:58,000
They have that Shaq Fu with the Gaiden one, you know. Nice.

2653
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:05,000
And then the sequel to that. So one of those stupid long name Shaq Fu, the something ultimate Grand Alpha Z Gaiden.

2654
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:10,000
VidPower in our chat room. Shaq Fu Gaiden was awesome.

2655
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:15,000
I never thought I'd see Shaq Fu and awesome in the same sentence, but there you go. It has its fans.

2656
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:21,000
What can you say? Uh, Twitter topics. I'll try to fill in with a few of those. Twitter dot com slash o l r.

2657
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:26,000
We got a few topics that we either talked about earlier in the show or last week. Like I see one from Flocko.

2658
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:30,000
We hit that during Rapid Fire News. One from SSJ100 Matt that we hit last week.

2659
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:34,000
Oh, we have a phone call coming in. So I'll go back to Twitter topics in a minute.

2660
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:37,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2661
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:41,000
Hey, this is VidPower. Hey, VidPower. How you doing?

2662
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:45,000
Good. Good. How are you today? I'm all right. Thanks for asking. What's on your mind, buddy?

2663
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:50,000
I just want to call in about and talk about CES. Did you go?

2664
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:53,000
I did. I did. That's right. You're in Vegas. It's in your backyard.

2665
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:58,000
It is. It is. It's really easy to get there and then have to put up with traffic.

2666
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:03,000
Now, Bobby on his show calls this the Consumer Electronics Show, which is not open to consumers.

2667
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:08,000
But you what you snuck into the back door or you work somewhere that got you in or what?

2668
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:13,000
I kind of snuck in. I snuck in every year.

2669
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Fair enough. Wow, this is like the renegade report on the Consumer Electronics Show.

2670
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:25,000
See, VoG can't afford to send anybody, so we just have people sneak in.

2671
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:29,000
I'm just kidding. This wasn't endorsed by VoG. All right.

2672
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
VidPower, tell us about what you saw at CES.

2673
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:36,000
Yeah, well, you know, since Microsoft wasn't there at CES this year,

2674
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:42,000
the amount of video games are pretty, well, CES isn't really known for video games anyway.

2675
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:47,000
But like this year, there were just like a small handful of games that were showing off.

2676
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:53,000
So not much. The big games were over at Sony's booth.

2677
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:58,000
God of War Ascension that were showing off was probably like the main big thing.

2678
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:07,000
But they had a bunch of other demos, like the new Sly Cooper game was there.

2679
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:11,000
They had that Book of Spells game that they were demoing.

2680
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:16,000
Did you get to see 120-inch television sets that just made everything look, oh, my God?

2681
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Yeah, yeah, I did. I did see one of those new 4K television sets with the crazy huge clear resolution.

2682
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
Do we need that?

2683
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:33,000
No, you don't. But it's pretty cool looking at it.

2684
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:38,000
I was at Fry's just last night with Alan very randomly. We were just over there kind of killing time.

2685
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:43,000
And we were looking at some of their really nice TVs. And like the new TVs, they're not even 4Ks.

2686
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:46,000
They're just like the HDTVs, but like the newer type of plasma or whatever.

2687
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:49,000
And they were showing on Blu-ray. Speed Racer was on one of them.

2688
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:55,000
And it was so like it just looked fake. And I realized like Speed Racer wasn't exactly, you know, real to begin with.

2689
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:59,000
Like you can tell that shit was done on a computer.

2690
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
Same thing with the Avengers was showing on another one of the TVs.

2691
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:06,000
And I was like, you can really see like, you can really tell computer versus real.

2692
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:14,000
This is like jaw-dropping how like the ultra precision of it all almost ruins the movie magic a little bit.

2693
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:23,000
It does. It does. Sometimes it looks a little like too, a bit fake with all that computer that they put in there.

2694
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:28,000
Yeah, yeah. Sometimes it does look a bit fake.

2695
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:36,000
But yeah, you know, they had a display of a Blu-ray playing on a TV next to one of these 4K televisions.

2696
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:41,000
And I guess if you compare the two, you can kind of see a clearer resolution.

2697
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:45,000
But like the average person probably couldn't see.

2698
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
Couldn't tell at all. It's just too much.

2699
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:48,000
Yeah, couldn't tell.

2700
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:52,000
4K is made to show like 48 frames a second The Hobbit. And I don't know if everybody's ready for that.

2701
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:59,000
Now I know you've been listening since the music gaming days. Did you see the classroom DDR thing?

2702
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:03,000
I did. I did see DDR classroom edition.

2703
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Did you check it out?

2704
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:11,000
I did. I did. So they had a demo on, it was a pretty like giant screen.

2705
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:18,000
And it had like seven of these wireless pads all set up for just random people to come play on it.

2706
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:26,000
And I, you know, being an old school DDR person, I went up and I tested out this pad.

2707
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:32,000
It's surprisingly good. It didn't slip at all.

2708
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:38,000
I don't know if they put anything under the pad or what, but like I was just doing like the expert level steps.

2709
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:39,000
Yeah.

2710
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:45,000
And yeah, it didn't slip at all. It definitely had the problem that most soft pads had.

2711
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:52,000
You know, you can't really feel the position of the arrow. So, you know, you're always like a bit off center.

2712
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:55,000
You're playing on it. But it was surprisingly good.

2713
02:41:55,000 --> 02:42:04,000
Good, like just kind of like a throwback to the old school, like red octane ignition 2.0 pads.

2714
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:09,000
Was the music in it all old school or was it kind of mixed with like contemporary stuff?

2715
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Like, you know, you know what? There were like pretty much it was all like licensed like American music.

2716
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:22,000
So there were like no like, you know, Konami originals or, you know, Japanese stuff.

2717
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:25,000
So it was just like it was really Americanized.

2718
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
No butterfly?

2719
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:31,000
Yeah, no, no butterfly. No butterfly.

2720
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:36,000
How am I supposed to show everybody in my PE class my patented Kyle Snyder spin?

2721
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:41,000
Oh, yeah. I was like, oh, OK.

2722
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:45,000
I think we saw that Uber song was like, yeah, like I have like a ton of everything.

2723
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:50,000
Anyway, I guess they'll have to stick with like Lady Gaga and Rihanna or whatever.

2724
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:53,000
Awesome. Well, it sounds like you had a good time at CES.

2725
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:59,000
So since you are a consumer who somehow got into Consumer Electronics Show and it is about trying to get you to buy something.

2726
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:03,000
Is there anything you walked out of the show going, I might buy that?

2727
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:08,000
Not really. CES is more really.

2728
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:11,000
What a successful expo.

2729
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:20,000
CES is really more about like technology that like to have like in the back of your mind.

2730
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:24,000
But a lot of it's like not ready for consumers yet.

2731
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:28,000
You know, most likely in the price, price level of all this stuff.

2732
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:32,000
Yeah, it's for CES is for rich people, not the people who have to sneak in.

2733
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:40,000
E3, just like E3 is technically supposed to be for a lot of shops to be able to pick up, pick up publishers, CES is meant.

2734
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:46,000
These are the technologies that you can offer to consumers and you get bits and pieces of it are good ideas, but it's not.

2735
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:51,000
It's technology for consumers, not Best Buy convention extreme.

2736
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:56,000
Pretty much. Yeah, that's a really accurate statement.

2737
02:43:56,000 --> 02:44:03,000
It's more, it's more of like technology that's like ready for consumer in like three to four years from now.

2738
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:07,000
All right. Well, VidPower, I should probably let you go to try and get another call here before the night's over.

2739
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
But thanks for the report from CES.

2740
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
No problem, no problem. Anytime.

2741
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
All right. You take care, buddy. Have a great week.

2742
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:14,000
Later.

2743
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:15,000
All right. Bye.

2744
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:20,000
It's nice to hear from VidPower. I haven't heard from him in a while, even though I want to know more about how he got in.

2745
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
That sounds a little sneaky there.

2746
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:30,000
All right. Excuse me while we wait for more calls at 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2747
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:36,000
Again, some Twitter topics out here. Tiger Claw on Twitter sending us a tweet to a story.

2748
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:37,000
Yes, I heard about this.

2749
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:40,000
It's not really gaming per se, but it's just kind of lolsy.

2750
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:47,000
You know, there's that site where you can do a petition to the White House and if it gets so many signatures, they like have to respond to it or whatever.

2751
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:51,000
Well, there was that whole petition to build a Death Star.

2752
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:54,000
The White House replied this week and said no.

2753
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:58,000
But I thought it was a very clever answer because it talked about we can't afford that kind of debt.

2754
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:01,000
And this administration does not support blowing up other planets.

2755
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
That was my favorite response.

2756
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:04,000
That was great.

2757
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
It was great. An amazing response.

2758
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:09,000
All right. Let's go to the phones and take another call.

2759
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2760
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
Hey, guys. This is Degenera Johnny.

2761
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:14,000
Hey.

2762
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:15,000
How are you guys doing?

2763
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:16,000
Degenera Johnny. What's on your mind, buddy?

2764
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
Not much. Can't complain.

2765
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:26,000
Well, actually, I do have a complaint to Brad from Pod Culture for getting me addicted to that fireball whiskey.

2766
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:32,000
It's very cinnamon.

2767
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:35,000
The influence of vog is spreading. I love it.

2768
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
That just makes me shudder. Yuck.

2769
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:39,000
Amazing.

2770
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:44,000
Well, sadly, Brad from Pod Culture told me he wasn't listening live tonight, but hopefully he'll catch up on the podcast.

2771
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
A good old hearty F.U.

2772
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
Yeah. Oh, it's all good.

2773
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:51,000
As a matter of fact, I'm using it for the Orange Lounge Radio drinking game.

2774
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:55,000
So, what else do you mind, buddy?

2775
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:05,000
Basically, well, I wanted to touch up on the whole video game violence thing.

2776
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:17,000
I'm a little afraid right now of the timing of this because I'm playing Dead Space 1 and 2 in preparation for Dead Space 3.

2777
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:32,000
And my problem is that, aside from Devil May Cry, this is one of the AAA titles that's coming out since the shooting.

2778
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:45,000
And Visceral Games has a tendency of pushing the envelope of putting certain adversaries in their games, namely babies and children.

2779
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:50,000
If you looked at their past three games, Dante's Inferno, Dead Space, and Dead Space 2.

2780
02:46:51,000 --> 02:47:06,000
And so my problem is, I'm a little scared about this, is if they decide to do that again in Dead Space 3, would we see more irate type of backlash?

2781
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:26,000
We haven't really received it beforehand, but in light of the shooting, this might come up and say Visceral, it puts in the six-year-old or seven-year-old pack hunters in the game, or the exploding babies.

2782
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:32,000
I'm just a little afraid that there might be a little backlash if they decide to do that.

2783
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:42,000
Yeah, I hear what you're saying, and I agree with you to a point that it's like, now would be a great time to just show a little restraint, but at the same time, somebody's gonna push the envelope.

2784
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:49,000
And if it's not these guys, then guess what'll end up on Fox News eventually? It'll be that game that the guys made about Columbine or whatever.

2785
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:58,000
The controversial thing that came out some time ago. There's always gonna be somebody pushing the envelope, but at the same time, that's what the First Amendment is for.

2786
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:13,000
And I think I've heard this argument before, is that we might want to put all these restrictions, but what lengths are we willing to go to sacrifice the First Amendment to spare all these others, or what have you?

2787
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:20,000
Drama's gonna unfold as a result of this, but it's not gonna be any different than what we've been dealing with for the past decade.

2788
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:33,000
I sort of have a feeling, I don't know, the cynic in me sort of thinks you are gonna start to see some type of legislation about violent video games, very similar to how you have motion pictures.

2789
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:44,000
You know, in reality, they would just mirror the frickin' motion picture thing. You know, no one under 17 admitted without parent or guardian or whatever, but then again, the Motion Picture Association needs to be reformed.

2790
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:59,000
Now would be a great time to examine all of that, because the MPAA is kind of shit, and the way they look at things, and that violent movies can be, you know, rated R, no problem, and kids can get in, but show a penis, and oh my god, not safe for anybody, right?

2791
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:13,000
It's like this weird, weird, you know, kind of bullshit. So now would be a great time to evaluate all of that, but I think it's inevitable. You're gonna see some type of parental controls on this, where there's gonna be certain type of games you don't buy without a driver's license.

2792
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:29,000
I just, or some type of identification, I just think that is inevitable, but it's also a little bit naive, because with the internet, you can get anything. You know, how you gonna regulate an M-rated game on the internet? It's gonna be a lot harder.

2793
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:36,000
So, and since we're all going towards digital distribution, that's kind of the reality. Movies are going that way too.

2794
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:56,000
Marissa Congusto in chat says, most likely there will be a threat of legislation, and the industry will censor itself. I'm totally with you there, Marissa, but that kind of already happened in the mid-90s. That's how we have the video game rating system we have now, was the first time we went through all this crap in the mid-90s, and that was when the record industry did the whole, you know, explicit lyrics thing, and all of that.

2795
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
And Walmart stopped carrying them.

2796
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
All of that happened, so.

2797
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:14,000
And the way I interpret what Biden was saying is that I think he acknowledges that the ESRB is by far far more responsible than the MPAA.

2798
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:28,000
I think it's like basically hinting to everybody, just, you know what, let it be general knowledge. You know, you guys are better than the MPAA, you guys are far more superior, more accountable, more responsible, definitely.

2799
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:44,000
I mean, just pick up a DVD and compare it to a video game and, you know, you'll have a hard time looking for a rating of the movie, much versus, you know, on the game where it's both on the front and the back, and it actually tells you, you know, in big bold letters, why it's rated at.

2800
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:53,000
That is an amazing amount of credit to give to Vice President Biden, I hope you're right, to hold up the ESRB as, this is what movies should be doing.

2801
02:50:53,000 --> 02:51:04,000
That is quite the, you know what, I gotta say though, I wish, because the MPAA really, they need to look at that hard, hard they need to look at that.

2802
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:23,000
It blows my mind, literally blows my mind how a movie like Saw 7 or any of those movies gets an R rating, but the movie Shameless that showed, you know, that guy from X-Men, it showed his little, you know, well, not little, but, you know, showed his wiener in that movie and all that.

2803
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:24,000
Showed his little X.

2804
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
Yeah, his little X or whatever.

2805
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:27,000
Little Jimmy.

2806
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:31,000
That was NC-17, because heaven forbid people have sex.

2807
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
Heaven forbid people have penises.

2808
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:44,000
But decapitations and people setting on fire and eyes sewn shut and all that crazy shit the Saw movies show, no problem, no problem.

2809
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:47,000
That, okay, there's a big problem here.

2810
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:48,000
Big problem.

2811
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000
I would rather see fucking than blood.

2812
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:51,000
Just saying.

2813
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:52,000
Me too.

2814
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:53,000
Who wouldn't?

2815
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:54,000
I knew.

2816
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
What sick fucker wants to see blood?

2817
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,000
I realize there's a whole like horror movie.

2818
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:01,000
Now, I do have a friend who's completely into the human centipede, so.

2819
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:02,000
Oh, God.

2820
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:03,000
Awesome.

2821
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:11,000
I should recognize that horror movie has its own subculture, but at least they all kind of admit it's a weird thing.

2822
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:16,000
Like most horror movie fans I know go, yeah, it's gross, but that's what I love about it is it's so cheesy.

2823
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
I'm like, all right, at least you know where it is.

2824
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,000
I showed her the toddler pee and she cracked up.

2825
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
I love TV ratings.

2826
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:28,000
Gaming ratings and TV ratings both have the general level.

2827
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:36,000
And then they point out these subcategories, you know, crude language, comic mischief, and up to the suggestive situations and so on and so forth.

2828
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:37,000
And those are good.

2829
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:40,000
They're expanded classifications that make a lot of sense.

2830
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
And movies don't.

2831
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:48,000
GameGuru in chat says about my comment about what's going to happen nationwide says, I don't think so.

2832
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:53,000
California tried that and the Supreme Court shot it down by saying video games are protected speech.

2833
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:54,000
There was more to it.

2834
02:52:54,000 --> 02:53:00,000
I don't remember all the details, but I want to say it was going to bust the employees and all this other stuff that didn't make sense.

2835
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:05,000
And the fact that I think mature gaming's like couldn't be on the shelves or had to have some type.

2836
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
Basically, they were going to treat the violent video games like porn.

2837
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:14,000
That was the problem is the labels they were giving to that and so forth was the problem.

2838
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:17,000
And that there is really no like there was no cut and dry.

2839
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
What makes a violent game?

2840
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:23,000
You know, there was it was going to be it wasn't they weren't trusting the ESRB to do it.

2841
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:24,000
That's the problem.

2842
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:35,000
But for them to step in and say, OK, the ESRB can get away with the same stuff the MPAA can or we're going to form a government agency that's basically the ESRB all over again or whatever.

2843
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:39,000
I don't think that necessarily is out of the realm of possibility.

2844
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:42,000
And I think that could be something that happens.

2845
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:56,000
I think it might I think that's the whole point of Rockefeller's bill that he's trying to introduce is like to evaluate video games in a certain light to see if there's legislation that's necessary.

2846
02:53:56,000 --> 02:54:02,000
Otherwise, you know, then we'll let be what it is.

2847
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:03,000
Exactly. All right.

2848
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:07,000
DeGeneres, Johnny, I got to let you go so we wrap up the show, but thanks so much for your call, buddy.

2849
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:08,000
No problem.

2850
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:09,000
You guys have a great day.

2851
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
You too. Take care.

2852
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
That is going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2853
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
I am very sorry to those that didn't get through.

2854
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
I know usually I try to take one or two more calls.

2855
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
I need to wrap up the show in the next few minutes here.

2856
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:23,000
So I'm going to kind of start to wind things down.

2857
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
I want to close out the Twitter topics, though.

2858
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:26,000
Twitter dot com slash O.L.R.

2859
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:38,000
There was one other tweet here I wanted to read from act deft who sent a story to a story about the PlayStation three has likely outsold the Xbox 360.

2860
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:40,000
What?

2861
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:42,000
Oh, maybe maybe worldwide.

2862
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:45,000
I believe it worldwide because Japan, you know, worldwide tilted.

2863
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
Is that what it is about worldwide?

2864
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:53,000
Yeah. So worldwide, it looks like the PlayStation three has outsold the Xbox 360.

2865
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
This will be great news to Sony fans everywhere.

2866
02:54:55,000 --> 02:55:01,000
But really, guys, just, you know, all the play what you like and enjoy it.

2867
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:02,000
Exactly.

2868
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:04,000
System is only as good as the games are on it.

2869
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:05,000
But you know what?

2870
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
I will say this much.

2871
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:12,000
We all gave the PlayStation three tons of shit when it first came out and it deserved it.

2872
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:15,000
But they've really turned it around in many ways.

2873
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
And this is the reward that they get to reap for that.

2874
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:18,000
Congratulations.

2875
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,000
Now, can you do something about the Vita?

2876
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
Yeah, seriously.

2877
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,000
Please land on that note.

2878
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:25,000
All right.

2879
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
That was it for the Twitter topics tonight.

2880
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:28,000
Rapid fire news.

2881
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:31,000
I don't think there was anything left in the show, but maybe if you got any sorry.

2882
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:32,000
Last minute story.

2883
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:33,000
Cox on fire.

2884
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:34,000
What?

2885
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:35,000
Read the chat.

2886
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:36,000
All right.

2887
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:37,000
Fair enough.

2888
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
All right.

2889
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:40,000
That's it.

2890
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
We're going to wrap up the show and head on out here for the night.

2891
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:49,000
But not before we go around to get everybody's final thoughts and a chance for me to say, of course, as always, support independent podcasting.

2892
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:53,000
You know, even if you thought this show was shit, go download another independent.

2893
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:56,000
First off, if you thought it was bad, I'm surprised you made it this far.

2894
02:55:56,000 --> 02:56:03,000
If you thought it was bad, send us feedback, constructive criticism and tell us what you thought didn't work instead of being an asshole.

2895
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:06,000
Mailbag at Orange Laundry dot com Facebook dot com.

2896
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:08,000
Orange Laundry do at O.L.R. on Twitter.

2897
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,000
Let me let me give you an example of bad feedback.

2898
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:15,000
Bad feedback would be Rob is a bitch or bad feedback would be Loki screams too much.

2899
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:16,000
Bitch.

2900
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:21,000
Good feedback would be the audio levels need to be looked at because sometimes Loki gets a little louder.

2901
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:22,000
That's fair feedback.

2902
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:27,000
Or, you know, Rob should not talk so much when he's talking about that.

2903
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:28,000
That or whatever.

2904
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:29,000
Or send us good feedback.

2905
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:30,000
We appreciate both kinds.

2906
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
We appreciate Jamie for everything that she.

2907
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:38,000
We love her and you don't have anything nice to pay her to do.

2908
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:40,000
Mailbag at Orange Laundry dot com.

2909
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:47,000
Or if the feedback is good, consider leaving a five star review on iTunes and help spread the word.

2910
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:50,000
You know, the other shows spread like a disease.

2911
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:53,000
There's a lot of gaming podcasts out there, a ton.

2912
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:59,000
But unfortunately, a lot of the ones that get all the attention from places like iTunes and so forth.

2913
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:06,000
Not all, but a lot are things that would be getting your attention anyway, because there are parts of million dollar websites.

2914
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:12,000
And, you know, they poop out podcasts every other day because they have the resources to do it.

2915
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:16,000
But I really encourage you check out the shows that independent producers are doing.

2916
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:19,000
I brought up gamertag radio earlier in the show.

2917
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:23,000
I'm going to, of course, plug VOD because all the hardworking independent folks that are out there.

2918
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
Lots of great shows on the network.

2919
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
We used to be on video game outsiders.

2920
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:30,000
I still try to try to listen to as much as I can.

2921
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:33,000
Loki and I were both on Down for Maintenance, a startup show.

2922
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:36,000
My buddies got Game Buoy, another great indie show.

2923
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:41,000
So just just support those that do this for the love of podcasting.

2924
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:44,000
Jason needs his own show because he's got a sexy voice.

2925
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:46,000
He does. He really does.

2926
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:47,000
I hope that happens soon.

2927
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:51,000
You need to have a very smooth R&B intro as well.

2928
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:56,000
You know what? We need to be like the kudzu of the podcasting world where we spread over everything.

2929
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000
And are high in iron.

2930
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:03,000
Anyhow, please tell a friend or two about the show because we don't have a lot of advertising dollars for any of that stuff.

2931
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:07,000
Like us on Facebook and all that stuff. It really helps.

2932
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:11,000
Anyway, I really want to thank our guests for being here, coming out all the way from Colorado.

2933
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:15,000
I know it wasn't just us, the reason why you came out, but we still appreciate you.

2934
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
You still have to drive here from San Francisco, which is no small task.

2935
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:18,000
Always a great part of it.

2936
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:19,000
So we really appreciate it.

2937
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:22,000
Thank you, Jason, for being on the show tonight.

2938
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:24,000
Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2939
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:26,000
If you don't hear from me in August, send help.

2940
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:32,000
Okay. And Rai, good luck with pushing it to Paragon 100. We're all rooting for you.

2941
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:35,000
Well, the next patch will definitely help.

2942
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:36,000
Alright, that'll be good.

2943
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:38,000
Five hundred percent experience! Yes!

2944
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:43,000
Yes! I will not be playing MP10. I don't care. Five hundred and ten percent.

2945
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:46,000
I don't care. I will not be doing MP10.

2946
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:49,000
Any final thoughts for our listeners, Rai?

2947
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:55,000
I'm glad that I'm finally coming out of a shell a little bit more, talking a little bit more than I was last time.

2948
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:58,000
Helps to have my own microphone and not be sharing with Rob.

2949
02:58:58,000 --> 02:58:59,000
There you go.

2950
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:01,000
He never lets go of his, Mike.

2951
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:02,000
Thank you to Brad.

2952
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:04,000
Love you, Brad.

2953
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:05,000
Thank you!

2954
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:08,000
So let's go around and talk to our hosts.

2955
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:11,000
Dark Soccer, you got your scarf on. You're ready to go. What's your final thought?

2956
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:14,000
I just wanted to put my scarf on. You need to stop judging me.

2957
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:16,000
Thanks for the chocolate and the coffee.

2958
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:17,000
You're welcome anytime.

2959
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:18,000
That's my thought.

2960
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:20,000
Alright, and my final thought...

2961
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:21,000
So long and thanks for the fish.

2962
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:24,000
My final thought tonight is...

2963
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:27,000
I don't know.

2964
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:28,000
Loki, your final...

2965
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:30,000
You love the sound of your own voice.

2966
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:31,000
Yes.

2967
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:33,000
Four score in seventy years... No.

2968
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
Loki, what's your final thought tonight?

2969
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:39,000
I guess I'll play some different games this week.

2970
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:43,000
I was already loading up Giana Sisters to try that since I have it on Steam.

2971
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:52,000
Maybe I'll finish the VoG Minecraft website and play Minecraft.

2972
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:53,000
I don't know.

2973
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:54,000
I got a lot of stuff I want to do.

2974
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:57,000
And I have a bunch of random computer parts that I took from...

2975
02:59:57,000 --> 03:00:03,000
Well, not took from work, but I had stored at work in my garage that I want to build something out of.

2976
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:04,000
I don't really know what.

2977
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:07,000
But, man, I have so many random computer parts.

2978
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:09,000
It's like I keep finding stuff. It's ridiculous.

2979
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,000
I don't know what to make out of it.

2980
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:17,000
You should make one of those little mini boxes that put it in something that no one would expect to see it in.

2981
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:19,000
Like build it out of a fake loader box or something.

2982
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:22,000
Well, originally I had parts for...

2983
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:26,000
I was building an arcade cabinet inside one of...

2984
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:29,000
It's like a tiny...

2985
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:32,000
What was it? Like the old LCD Frogger games.

2986
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:35,000
Like the really small cabinet ones.

2987
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:38,000
Although it doesn't fit without dremeling some stuff out.

2988
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:44,000
So I have a Pico ITX... I think it's Pico ITX board.

2989
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:50,000
And then I've got a ton of arcade boards and all sorts of crazy shit.

2990
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:54,000
You should actually build the ultimate jamma cabinet and call it the bad mamma jamma.

2991
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:55,000
Bad mamma jamma.

2992
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
I think someone's done that.

2993
03:00:57,000 --> 03:01:00,000
All right. That does it.

2994
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:05,000
Oh, ActDeft wants me to tell you, you have been added to the VOG club on Forza Horizon.

2995
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:06,000
Woo!

2996
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:07,000
And we have to play this week.

2997
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:11,000
Oh, you can't be any worse than me, Matt. Don't worry about it.

2998
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:14,000
Nah. You should have seen me driving.

2999
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:16,000
Battle for last place.

3000
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:18,000
Fist bump. All right.

3001
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:20,000
That's it. We're done. Another show in the can.

3002
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:22,000
We'll be back next week to do it all over again.

3003
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:24,000
Have a wonderful week and be nice to each other.

3004
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:26,000
And I don't know what else to say.

3005
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:28,000
So I'll play the ending music.

3006
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:31,000
