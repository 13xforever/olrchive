2
00:00:31,854 --> 00:00:37,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:37,318 --> 00:00:47,526
[SPEAKER_02]: It is Orange Lounge Radio for this January the 27th, 2013, episode number 491 of our program on this lovely Sunday evening.

00:00:47,827 --> 00:00:58,215
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts with you all at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOG at Network.com where we do tape our show every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.

[SPEAKER_02]: Video games, gaming culture, and gaming lols are my co-hosts, first off, the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

6
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:29,577
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm not going to go into any detail about it because she's crazy.

7
00:01:30,418 --> 00:01:30,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

8
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,242
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but yeah, free.

9
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:34,556
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, freedom.

10
00:01:34,576 --> 00:01:35,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy, happy.

11
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,618
[SPEAKER_05]: And that same night I had gnocchi, so it was awesome.

12
00:01:39,178 --> 00:01:43,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm reminded of that scene from Braveheart, even though I can't stand Val Gibson, but you know, freedom!

13
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,359
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, forget it.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, I'll also say hello to the free tech master, Loki.

15
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:50,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

16
00:01:50,301 --> 00:01:51,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Terrible transition, I know.

17
00:01:51,322 --> 00:01:51,882
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you, Loki?

18
00:01:52,522 --> 00:01:53,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing fine.

19
00:01:53,302 --> 00:01:54,983
[SPEAKER_02]: And what won the dinner lottery for tonight?

20
00:01:55,623 --> 00:01:58,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimate cheeseburger from Jack in the Box.

21
00:01:58,644 --> 00:02:00,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Healthy as always, huh?

22
00:02:00,465 --> 00:02:00,906
[SPEAKER_10]: I was hungry.

23
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:02,727
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't eat anything all day, so, you know.

24
00:02:03,407 --> 00:02:07,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, our chatroom is open and welcoming your live comments.

25
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:17,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Live.VogNetwork.com Where Breakman, in our chatroom, starts off tonight saying, Quitting a job is one of the greatest experiences anyone can have.

26
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:20,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it like that scene from, what movie was that?

27
00:02:20,218 --> 00:02:21,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that Half Baked or something?

28
00:02:21,499 --> 00:02:27,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Where the guy's working at a fast food restaurant and he goes, Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool, I'm out.

29
00:02:27,703 --> 00:02:27,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

30
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:30,530
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen Half Baked and I need to.

31
00:02:31,871 --> 00:02:37,894
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to make like a list, you know, for your, because is Monday going to be your first full day off?

32
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:38,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you quit Friday or Thursday?

33
00:02:38,935 --> 00:02:39,635
[SPEAKER_05]: I quit Thursday.

34
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:40,616
[SPEAKER_05]: She's paying me for Friday.

35
00:02:40,976 --> 00:02:41,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

36
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:46,439
[SPEAKER_05]: And which I got, I saved, I actually saved a photo of the text message.

37
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,700
[SPEAKER_05]: So if she doesn't, I can nail her.

38
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:55,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was going to say, on Monday, you should have a like unemployment marathon and you can watch like, you know, Falling Down with Michael Douglas.

39
00:02:56,184 --> 00:02:57,385
[SPEAKER_02]: You can watch, you know.

40
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:58,325
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

41
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Half-baked?

42
00:02:59,086 --> 00:02:59,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that waiting?

43
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:01,968
[SPEAKER_02]: On Monday... Waiting, that would be a good one, too.

44
00:03:02,268 --> 00:03:06,831
[SPEAKER_05]: On Monday, though, I have an appointment in the morning and a job interview.

45
00:03:07,231 --> 00:03:07,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

46
00:03:08,332 --> 00:03:20,740
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it was sort of like... And it's funny, okay, I'll talk about this later, but I got a cat, and I thought I could go pick her up a little bit early, and then I ended up forgetting the paperwork at home, so I had to turn back around.

47
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,743
[SPEAKER_05]: The moment I started unlocking my door, I got a call about the other job, so...

48
00:03:26,644 --> 00:03:27,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's talk about that.

49
00:03:27,565 --> 00:03:30,946
[SPEAKER_02]: I did want to start off, you know, before we get into how was our gaming week.

50
00:03:31,346 --> 00:03:33,588
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some personal life updates we wanted to get out there.

51
00:03:34,028 --> 00:03:38,630
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yes, let's talk about DarkSakura, mommy once again for a new kitty, right?

52
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I have a new cat.

53
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:41,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Her name is Midna.

54
00:03:42,072 --> 00:03:45,654
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost named her Eri, but Midna seems to fit her better.

55
00:03:45,694 --> 00:03:46,434
[SPEAKER_05]: She's very impish.

56
00:03:46,734 --> 00:03:48,495
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's people that might not catch the reference.

57
00:03:48,815 --> 00:03:51,357
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess.

58
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:51,817
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

59
00:03:52,105 --> 00:03:59,471
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny, the other day I was like, so our little princess is perched on the couch and Dan's like, yeah, Twilight Princess.

60
00:04:00,853 --> 00:04:01,473
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty funny.

61
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:06,758
[SPEAKER_05]: She's about eight months old, maybe a little older, I don't know, but she's tiny.

62
00:04:06,818 --> 00:04:11,502
[SPEAKER_05]: She's still tiny and very lithe and has lime green eyes and she's all black.

63
00:04:11,982 --> 00:04:17,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I thought she was all completely black, but she has like a few little white hairs scattered across her chest.

64
00:04:18,107 --> 00:04:19,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that sounds like Maruko.

65
00:04:19,328 --> 00:04:19,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

66
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:21,090
[SPEAKER_05]: But she's really short for it.

67
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:21,811
[SPEAKER_05]: She's short for it.

68
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:23,932
[SPEAKER_05]: But she does walk with her tail in the air like he did.

69
00:04:25,394 --> 00:04:26,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

70
00:04:26,795 --> 00:04:31,880
[SPEAKER_05]: She's not really, I'd say, she doesn't press about, you know, but she does jump around a lot.

71
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,702
[SPEAKER_05]: And she adopted one of Shermie's toys as hers.

72
00:04:35,683 --> 00:04:38,806
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, well, Shermie loved it, so I'm glad the new kitty loves it.

73
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:39,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

74
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:41,888
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

75
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:03,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, hear mother play.

76
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:05,014
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, okay.

77
00:05:05,134 --> 00:05:06,034
[SPEAKER_05]: She does this all the time.

78
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:10,195
[SPEAKER_05]: And then like when I'm done playing, she'll just pick it up and carry it off in the corner and start licking it.

79
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:14,777
[SPEAKER_05]: And she hasn't had any accidents.

80
00:05:14,817 --> 00:05:19,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Normally, in my experience with a kitten, they have like a couple little poopy or pee-pee accidents.

81
00:05:20,058 --> 00:05:20,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a single one.

82
00:05:21,398 --> 00:05:22,799
[SPEAKER_05]: She knows where her box is.

83
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Good kitty.

84
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she's a good baby.

85
00:05:25,922 --> 00:05:28,245
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's just smart and she's cuddly.

86
00:05:28,946 --> 00:05:32,590
[SPEAKER_05]: But because she's still kind of a kitten, she loses attention really quickly.

87
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:34,393
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, okay, I'm done cuddling play.

88
00:05:35,226 --> 00:05:43,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiger Claw, our resident internet research expert at live.vognetwork.com found the picture that you'd posted on Twitter this week apparently.

89
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:44,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the one picture I did on Twitter.

90
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,430
[SPEAKER_02]: All the chatters are now going, duh.

91
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,731
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think I got it uploaded.

92
00:05:48,771 --> 00:05:58,655
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go to my Tumblr, which is Kuro Tsubasa, K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A, whatever Tsubasa is spelled like.

93
00:05:59,515 --> 00:06:01,116
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't even know how to spell your own damn name?

94
00:06:01,136 --> 00:06:08,140
[SPEAKER_02]: T-S-U-B-A-S-A Maybe you need a less complicated name like JaneShepard2.tumblr.com or something.

95
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:14,965
[SPEAKER_05]: It's K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A.tumblr.com Maybe that's too much.

96
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:15,485
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

97
00:06:17,385 --> 00:06:23,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but, uh, she's, uh, I have a picture of a video of her playing on my Tumblr.

98
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:27,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I tried to upload it from my phone and Brad, I don't care if you don't like cats, you don't have to live with her.

99
00:06:27,872 --> 00:06:28,832
[SPEAKER_05]: She's my cat, not yours.

100
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:31,900
[SPEAKER_05]: But she's adorable.

101
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,760
[SPEAKER_05]: She's sweet.

102
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Dogs can be cute, too.

103
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:34,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.

104
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:35,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially corgis.

105
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:36,121
[SPEAKER_05]: They stink.

106
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially corgis.

107
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:42,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I met a corgi at PetSmart when I was buying stuff for Midna.

108
00:06:42,363 --> 00:06:43,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you tempted?

109
00:06:43,843 --> 00:06:44,044
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

110
00:06:44,084 --> 00:06:44,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you tempted almost?

111
00:06:44,744 --> 00:06:48,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I found out firsthand now that I'm actually the same type of allergic to corgis I am to other dogs.

112
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:50,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, tragedy.

113
00:06:50,486 --> 00:06:50,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

114
00:06:51,646 --> 00:06:54,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep telling Alan, when we get a house someday, it's going to be Corgi Village.

115
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:55,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Breakman.

116
00:06:56,129 --> 00:07:00,754
[SPEAKER_05]: My cat is all black, but she's got just like a few scattering white furs on her chest.

117
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:02,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Like DarkSakura's heart.

118
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:03,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

119
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,119
[SPEAKER_05]: My heart is black with white fur.

120
00:07:07,241 --> 00:07:07,501
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

121
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, anything else before we move on to...

122
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:12,179
[SPEAKER_05]: She's just funny to watch explore.

123
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:12,960
[SPEAKER_05]: She's really cute.

124
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I love my new kitty.

125
00:07:15,641 --> 00:07:17,622
[SPEAKER_05]: But I still get a little nostalgic for Shermie.

126
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:24,826
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost picked up Shermie's mousy to give to the new kitten and I was like, I can't do it.

127
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:29,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, AkumaJP in our chat room has a theory saying, you know, cats do come back.

128
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:30,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Cats do come back.

129
00:07:30,787 --> 00:07:31,207
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.

130
00:07:31,487 --> 00:07:33,307
[SPEAKER_05]: But this cat was alive before Shermie died.

131
00:07:33,588 --> 00:07:35,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I've got her shot records from September.

132
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:36,728
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.

133
00:07:37,408 --> 00:07:40,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, she just doesn't act at all like Shermie did.

134
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:42,409
[SPEAKER_05]: She's completely different than Shermie.

135
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:44,689
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, she's cuddly and sweet and everything.

136
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,870
[SPEAKER_05]: But even, but Shermie was still stupidly neurotic when she was that old.

137
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,370
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to replace it.

138
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:51,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you're not trying to replace Shermie.

139
00:07:51,491 --> 00:07:52,571
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not trying to replace Shermie.

140
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:53,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

141
00:07:53,311 --> 00:07:54,392
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

142
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:25,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but, um, Dan ended up finding her under the liner underneath the couch.

143
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Brad would like to clarify what he said earlier.

144
00:08:29,282 --> 00:08:32,305
[SPEAKER_02]: He says being deathly allergic might have a bit to do with the hatred.

145
00:08:32,405 --> 00:08:33,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I could, I could see that.

146
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm like that with dogs, but I love dogs, but I'm stupidly allergic to them.

147
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:37,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

148
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:44,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it probably the only dog I think I could get away with having would be a pit, a pit or a boxer.

149
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:44,556
[SPEAKER_02]: No, thank you.

150
00:08:45,336 --> 00:08:46,377
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to tell you something, Rob.

151
00:08:46,738 --> 00:08:46,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

152
00:08:47,378 --> 00:08:53,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Pitbulls are actually among the most loyal and sweetest dogs, but they do require a good trainer.

153
00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:54,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Your sentence didn't contain the word corgi.

154
00:08:55,082 --> 00:08:57,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop caring.

155
00:08:57,443 --> 00:09:00,985
[SPEAKER_05]: I could have a Yorkie, but Dan was like, they're not real dogs.

156
00:09:02,346 --> 00:09:04,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we move on from kitty puppy chat?

157
00:09:05,387 --> 00:09:09,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure people who downloaded a video game podcast probably wouldn't mind kitty puppy chat.

158
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,210
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have to talk video games at some point.

159
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,531
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but my cat's awesome.

160
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:14,152
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have another personal story real quick.

161
00:09:14,212 --> 00:09:16,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so OLR today, like seriously, almost didn't happen.

162
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:19,974
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's because we went to Reno this weekend.

163
00:09:20,414 --> 00:09:21,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, it was a random thing.

164
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:23,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been having cabin fever lately.

165
00:09:24,156 --> 00:09:28,277
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the last big trip we took was when, oh, I didn't even go there with Alan.

166
00:09:28,297 --> 00:09:32,959
[SPEAKER_02]: I went with Victoria, but Disneyland in September was like the last like trip I went outside of the Bay Area.

167
00:09:32,979 --> 00:09:35,120
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't count Bay Area trips because that's like my second home.

168
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:35,300
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

169
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, it had been a few months since we'd really gone anywhere, so I was like, let's go somewhere.

170
00:09:39,762 --> 00:09:44,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to Chico, my old hometown, or let's go to Reno or something.

171
00:09:44,965 --> 00:09:47,527
[SPEAKER_02]: So we decided to go to Reno because we looked at the forecast and it was sunny.

172
00:09:47,607 --> 00:09:49,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunny, sunny, sunny, partially cloudy.

173
00:09:49,308 --> 00:09:51,749
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, okay, we won't run into any issues.

174
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, it's winter, but it'll be fine.

175
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,512
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be able to see some of the snow that's up there and we can go gamble.

176
00:09:56,312 --> 00:09:59,033
[SPEAKER_02]: So we drove up there, no problem, and had some fun.

177
00:09:59,293 --> 00:10:02,375
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do want to talk about casinos in a minute, because yes, it does relate to video games.

178
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:07,237
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, this morning, oh crap, it snowed overnight.

179
00:10:07,297 --> 00:10:12,720
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently, yeah, like at least an inch of snow fell over the mountains, and that means the chain controls were on.

180
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't have an SUV.

181
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:15,881
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't carry chains.

182
00:10:16,221 --> 00:10:17,302
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to put on chains.

183
00:10:17,762 --> 00:10:19,282
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even think I'm supposed to use chains in my car.

184
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:20,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I have to use these vinyl things.

185
00:10:20,783 --> 00:10:23,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Regardless, I don't really want to have to deal with all that fuckery.

186
00:10:23,804 --> 00:10:24,764
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, great.

187
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the word fuckery.

188
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you'll hear that word a lot on tonight's show, by the way.

189
00:10:29,526 --> 00:10:31,327
[SPEAKER_02]: The word of the day is fuckery.

190
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:34,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Where fucks are made.

191
00:10:36,349 --> 00:10:37,669
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where the fuck comes from.

192
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:38,609
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a fuckerary.

193
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:44,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, speaking of fuckerary, we're leaving Reno.

194
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:51,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, the snow, I guess, melted around noon because the sun finally came up and the clouds parted.

195
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:54,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very happy because I did not want to have to miss tonight's show.

196
00:10:54,894 --> 00:11:00,820
[SPEAKER_02]: More importantly, I did not want to have to miss work tomorrow because stupid me doesn't know how to put chains on a freaking car.

197
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:02,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, crisis averted.

198
00:11:03,222 --> 00:11:06,482
[SPEAKER_02]: But the cool thing about being in Reno is that you get to see all the new toys.

199
00:11:06,523 --> 00:11:10,004
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you what, they dump a lot of money into casino games.

200
00:11:10,084 --> 00:11:16,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how often you guys go into casinos and stuff, but there's a lot of neat technology to try and bring in your money.

201
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:29,411
[SPEAKER_02]: You may or may not know this, but a company that we've talked about on this show for a long time, Konami, has a huge game-making business in slot machines.

202
00:11:29,771 --> 00:11:30,912
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a huge part of their business.

203
00:11:30,952 --> 00:11:32,913
[SPEAKER_02]: They make a lot of various slot machines.

204
00:11:34,373 --> 00:11:38,675
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're old enough and you're at the casino, look in the corner of some of the slot machine games.

205
00:11:38,695 --> 00:11:40,216
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll sometimes see that they're made by Konami.

206
00:11:40,516 --> 00:11:43,557
[SPEAKER_02]: But what really struck me as interesting is that a lot of the...

207
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, wait, I have to clarify this because the folks in chat are like, really?

208
00:11:50,122 --> 00:11:50,983
[SPEAKER_02]: An inch of snow?

209
00:11:51,163 --> 00:11:52,784
[SPEAKER_02]: You were freaking out over an inch of snow?

210
00:11:53,124 --> 00:11:53,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

211
00:11:53,605 --> 00:11:56,367
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, in my defense, we're in California.

212
00:11:56,887 --> 00:11:58,448
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't get like snow ever.

213
00:11:58,588 --> 00:11:59,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you live in Tahoe.

214
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:00,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you, yeah.

215
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,852
[SPEAKER_02]: California does have its very beautiful snowy parts.

216
00:12:04,012 --> 00:12:05,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't live there.

217
00:12:05,413 --> 00:12:11,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in the sacraments where it gets up to 105, or no, my favorite term I heard this week.

218
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,282
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in Sacra Ghetto, California, and it gets up to like 105 here in the summer.

219
00:12:20,362 --> 00:12:23,504
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, the littlest snow will freak me out in our cars.

220
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:25,564
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't we don't antifreeze.

221
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,265
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of fuckery is antifreeze?

222
00:12:27,305 --> 00:12:28,526
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't use that shit here.

223
00:12:28,886 --> 00:12:30,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is just not something we're used to.

224
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:32,688
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, an inch of snow is a big deal.

225
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:35,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Bobby Blackwolf.

226
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,071
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a phrase I say very often on this show.

227
00:12:38,311 --> 00:12:38,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, no, no, no.

228
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:39,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

229
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,192
[SPEAKER_02]: But he says, I understand freaking out over an inch of snow.

230
00:12:42,392 --> 00:12:43,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in Georgia.

231
00:12:43,253 --> 00:12:44,033
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm from Alabama.

232
00:12:44,493 --> 00:12:49,995
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually did get snow in Mobile, which is technically a subtropical climate, but everything shuts down and you can't find bread.

233
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,236
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, you don't need chains for an inch of snow.

234
00:12:53,276 --> 00:12:54,577
[SPEAKER_02]: You will be safe in lower gear.

235
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:57,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, ah, but is that true going up and down a 5,000-foot mountain?

236
00:12:58,018 --> 00:12:59,018
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably the difference.

237
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:00,719
[SPEAKER_10]: You're actually fine.

238
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

239
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

240
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:04,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, tell the CHP that, okay?

241
00:13:04,923 --> 00:13:05,543
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyway.

242
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to the casino games.

243
00:13:07,805 --> 00:13:08,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Just drift, man.

244
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:09,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

245
00:13:09,507 --> 00:13:11,869
[SPEAKER_02]: The part about gaming.

246
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,361
[SPEAKER_02]: The part about gaming.

247
00:13:16,142 --> 00:13:18,363
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some interesting technology in some of these games.

248
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:22,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so don't laugh, but Alan and I were looking at a Sex and the City slot machine.

249
00:13:23,146 --> 00:13:23,967
[SPEAKER_02]: It was huge.

250
00:13:24,027 --> 00:13:25,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

251
00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:27,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the picture and I didn't get the reference.

252
00:13:27,369 --> 00:13:30,091
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing looked like it was like a $100,000 machine.

253
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:32,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was like super fancy, right?

254
00:13:32,753 --> 00:13:33,453
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't play it.

255
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:34,334
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't give it any money.

256
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:40,638
[SPEAKER_02]: But we were looking at it because we're like, this screen is like twice the size of what you see on a Derby's owner club.

257
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:45,863
[SPEAKER_10]: and you look at the little... How ironic that you would use that reference to a horse game.

258
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:48,367
[SPEAKER_02]: I see what you did there.

259
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:48,867
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

260
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:53,551
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at the screen and we look carefully at the little rolls of the slot machine.

261
00:13:53,851 --> 00:13:54,752
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in 3D.

262
00:13:55,312 --> 00:13:57,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the screens are in 3D.

263
00:13:57,694 --> 00:14:00,416
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, they're using the same technology in the 3D.

264
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:01,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Like no glasses or anything, right?

265
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:03,938
[SPEAKER_02]: They're using that glasses-free technology.

266
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:04,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan's old phone had it.

267
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,921
[SPEAKER_02]: That you see in the 3DS and all that stuff.

268
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:07,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

269
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,242
[SPEAKER_02]: On slot machines now.

270
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, her face is really long.

271
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:12,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

272
00:14:14,805 --> 00:14:19,347
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say I'm like the least girly girl ever because I didn't understand the maker of those shoes or whatever.

273
00:14:20,007 --> 00:14:20,847
[SPEAKER_05]: It's alright, it's alright.

274
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:25,349
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there was a 3D game I played later.

275
00:14:25,469 --> 00:14:30,410
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called, don't laugh, it was called Ladybug Wedding 2.

276
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,392
[SPEAKER_02]: And I won more money on that machine than I did anything.

277
00:14:35,632 --> 00:14:36,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, look, Alan and I have a thing.

278
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:38,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan, Alan, come here.

279
00:14:39,494 --> 00:14:40,594
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to put you on the spot.

280
00:14:41,909 --> 00:14:42,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Alan.

281
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:42,649
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

282
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,030
[SPEAKER_02]: What up?

283
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:43,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good.

284
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you enjoy Reno?

285
00:14:44,711 --> 00:14:44,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.

286
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:47,852
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm talking about some of the technology we saw in the casinos.

287
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:50,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you find the technology that they use in slot machines fascinating?

288
00:14:51,050 --> 00:15:17,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah once we passed the big monolith Sex and the City thing to make fun of it I then started noticing those 3D screens on a lot of the other newer machines and it was kind of like how the 3DS is where it's not so much that it pops out but especially like it looks like recessed like you can see like you know an inch like it looks like you're looking inside the screen.

289
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:43,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Codeman in our chatroom says I work in the casino business and Konami has a whole separate business for casinos they work closely with Bally they make some amazing pinball machines and Codeman continues those machines are made up have four separate screens on top of each other it was interesting to see them broken down the Ladybug game I was playing had that thing going on but the Sex and the City was like a true 3D but yeah the four screen 3D trick was really cool like it was a neat effect

290
00:15:43,906 --> 00:15:50,651
[SPEAKER_02]: But, okay, so to justify why I was playing Ladybug Wedding 2, tell the listeners about your strategy when it comes to slot machines.

291
00:15:51,051 --> 00:16:02,299
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend, Ira, who I've known for several years, he made a comment on the picture post I made on Facebook of the Sex and the City machine, and he's like, I'm dead serious.

292
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:11,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Play the gayest, most flamboyant slots you can find, because I played some unicorn magic bullshit in Las Vegas and won $1,100.

293
00:16:11,486 --> 00:16:11,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

294
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:14,088
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, all right.

295
00:16:14,488 --> 00:16:22,313
[SPEAKER_07]: So I found a unicorn slot and I found two, guess how gay this is, village people themed slot machines.

296
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:24,134
[SPEAKER_07]: I was down about 25 bucks.

297
00:16:24,254 --> 00:16:27,016
[SPEAKER_07]: I made all my money back and ended the night ahead $12.

298
00:16:27,076 --> 00:16:31,299
[SPEAKER_02]: This motherfucker hit the super jackpot on the village people slot machine.

299
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:33,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I put in a five and it cashed out like $37.

300
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:37,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, I just made all my money back and I'm ahead 12.

301
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:39,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I thought I just blew 20 bucks.

302
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:45,347
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even want to know what kind of fanfare you get with hitting the super jackpot on a Village People machine.

303
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:48,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Did this like a stage show occur?

304
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:50,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Ironically, you're trying to avoid the pooper.

305
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:56,492
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, on the little bonus stage, you hit these little things.

306
00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:59,353
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a party pooper, but yeah, like a nerd pops up.

307
00:16:59,493 --> 00:17:04,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they're doing the disco, and then if you click the wrong record, this nerd's like, what are you guys doing?

308
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:05,295
[SPEAKER_07]: This music's too loud.

309
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,856
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you end the bonus stage.

310
00:17:06,896 --> 00:17:07,496
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's the pooper.

311
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:08,556
[SPEAKER_07]: You're trying to avoid the pooper.

312
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:09,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I tell a lie?

313
00:17:09,597 --> 00:17:09,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

314
00:17:11,818 --> 00:17:33,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the slot machine themes are like Jungle Prince, Lion King, Fluffy Poodle Deluxe I played Kitty Glitter The amount of times my peripheral vision misread hot slots as hot slots I had to look and go, what?

315
00:17:33,943 --> 00:17:36,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, slots That happened like a dozen times

316
00:17:37,577 --> 00:17:39,058
[SPEAKER_07]: So what was your favorite machine that you played?

317
00:17:39,118 --> 00:17:40,339
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

318
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the village people, because I won all the money on it.

319
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:46,863
[SPEAKER_05]: I was actually going to say, I also like seeing the loosest sluts ever.

320
00:17:48,784 --> 00:17:54,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Quickly, the other 3D one I saw you playing, something like Miss Red, which was slutty red riding hood.

321
00:17:54,568 --> 00:18:04,734
[SPEAKER_07]: They have all of these princess sort of things, but they're all like sexed up, like Scarlet Hood, and she's got like a bikini on, and the wolf's all drooly and pervy.

322
00:18:04,754 --> 00:18:05,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

323
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:12,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I played one Red Riding Hood game that I didn't like, and then I played another one that I actually did really well on.

324
00:18:12,497 --> 00:18:19,440
[SPEAKER_07]: I could have, I made like five bucks, and then I was like, all right, I made five, I may as well spin it back down, and I ended up losing it.

325
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,162
[SPEAKER_07]: But that one I really liked, and that had a great 3D screen with a lot of little neat animations on it.

326
00:18:24,342 --> 00:18:25,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe it.

327
00:18:25,122 --> 00:18:26,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave it to the internets.

328
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:27,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiger Claw found a video.

329
00:18:27,663 --> 00:18:30,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's Little Ladybug 2, penny slot bonus mode.

330
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,365
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't really see the 3D effect in this thing.

331
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:36,246
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the game I was playing.

332
00:18:36,326 --> 00:18:37,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't know how to do that.

333
00:18:37,986 --> 00:18:40,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so you guys know, I'm not making it up.

334
00:18:40,827 --> 00:18:41,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Tiger.

335
00:18:41,428 --> 00:18:42,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm giving the mic back to Jamie.

336
00:18:43,148 --> 00:18:43,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Alan.

337
00:18:43,808 --> 00:18:45,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's kind of wrong that someone just scored with KKK.

338
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:48,190
[SPEAKER_05]: King, king, king.

339
00:18:49,523 --> 00:18:49,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

340
00:18:49,903 --> 00:18:50,484
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm from Alabama.

341
00:18:51,104 --> 00:18:51,524
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

342
00:18:51,645 --> 00:18:52,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

343
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:54,246
[SPEAKER_02]: No, thank you.

344
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:54,747
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

345
00:18:55,807 --> 00:18:56,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

346
00:18:56,107 --> 00:18:59,450
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do I want to say about casinos and all that stuff?

347
00:18:59,570 --> 00:18:59,890
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

348
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:07,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it's interesting that a lot of the stuff we see in like console gaming and all that we see for adult gaming as well.

349
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,237
[SPEAKER_02]: And that a lot of the same companies are involved.

350
00:19:10,397 --> 00:19:11,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was interesting.

351
00:19:11,638 --> 00:19:12,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Technology.

352
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:12,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

353
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:14,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

354
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Loco Poco links to crazy taxi slots.

355
00:19:18,502 --> 00:19:21,764
[SPEAKER_02]: They have slot machines for all sorts of weird things, like the Hangover.

356
00:19:22,064 --> 00:19:23,525
[SPEAKER_02]: The movie has a slot machine.

357
00:19:24,005 --> 00:19:25,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, it was in Vegas.

358
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:28,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess, but we were in Reno.

359
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:35,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay, well then they can't have any sort of Nevada gambling-themed slot machines in other parts of Nevada.

360
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:38,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is just the bonus feature in the Dreamcast.

361
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:42,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought this was an actual crazy taxi slot machine, but no, this is just the little bonus feature in the home version.

362
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:44,436
[SPEAKER_02]: You sneaky little bastard.

363
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:45,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow,

364
00:19:48,194 --> 00:19:48,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

365
00:19:48,775 --> 00:19:51,439
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we can get into some... I love how the chat room's looking for all these slot machines now.

366
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:51,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

367
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I got y'all thinking about gambling.

368
00:19:53,182 --> 00:19:53,863
[SPEAKER_05]: I need pachinko.

369
00:19:53,883 --> 00:19:58,049
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's talk about video games and console games and the things we've been playing this week.

370
00:19:58,069 --> 00:20:00,312
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have some housekeeping for tonight as well that's important.

371
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:02,856
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get to our gaming weeks first.

372
00:20:02,896 --> 00:20:04,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

373
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,661
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week was kitty.

374
00:20:06,603 --> 00:20:11,448
[SPEAKER_05]: No, actually, I played Mass Effect 2 again because I think I finally mastered Flycam.

375
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:21,781
[SPEAKER_05]: And if anyone wants to go to MassEffecting.tumblr.com, you can see a bunch of really neat screen grabs I was able to do with the Flycam.

376
00:20:22,642 --> 00:20:22,962
[SPEAKER_05]: And then...

377
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:30,647
[SPEAKER_05]: I played a game that I'm going to be... Well, I didn't play it for very long.

378
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:34,513
[SPEAKER_05]: But I played a game called Chompman, which we will be talking about later.

379
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:36,756
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's really about it.

380
00:20:37,177 --> 00:20:38,719
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had kind of an alarming week.

381
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:41,049
[SPEAKER_10]: All righty.

382
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki?

383
00:20:43,471 --> 00:20:44,672
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't play a whole lot this week.

384
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:47,194
[SPEAKER_10]: I played actually a little bit of Minecraft last night.

385
00:20:48,155 --> 00:20:55,400
[SPEAKER_10]: I was bored and my wife got into the next series of terrible TV shows that I'm going to have to sit through the entire series of.

386
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:58,783
[SPEAKER_10]: This new series is Grey's Anatomy.

387
00:20:59,223 --> 00:21:01,625
[SPEAKER_10]: I get to sit through the whole series of Grey's Anatomy.

388
00:21:01,645 --> 00:21:01,985
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

389
00:21:02,025 --> 00:21:02,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Run.

390
00:21:02,486 --> 00:21:02,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Run.

391
00:21:05,123 --> 00:21:09,686
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm thinking it's starting to go to my head because I don't think it's actually that bad right now.

392
00:21:10,726 --> 00:21:11,587
[SPEAKER_10]: You are so whipped.

393
00:21:11,867 --> 00:21:13,268
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm not watching it.

394
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:15,529
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm playing Skyrim, okay, with headphones on.

395
00:21:15,629 --> 00:21:19,711
[SPEAKER_10]: So occasionally I'll see Katherine Heigl take off her clothes and stuff.

396
00:21:19,731 --> 00:21:21,072
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm like, okay, this is not so bad.

397
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:28,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so it's just, you know, it's brief bits of Katherine Heigl.

398
00:21:28,837 --> 00:21:43,566
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyways, so yeah, the other thing I've been playing, Skyrim on PC with all the mods and stuff and kind of retracing my steps I did on the console version since I have, I'm probably going to play through the whole game now on PC because, well, I have more expansions on there.

399
00:21:43,586 --> 00:21:47,749
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought the two expansions out right now and probably will buy Dragonborn when that comes out.

400
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,372
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually bought some more games on Steam today.

401
00:21:53,072 --> 00:21:57,155
[SPEAKER_10]: But ironically, most of my game purchases now are not coming from Steam sales.

402
00:21:57,175 --> 00:22:01,217
[SPEAKER_10]: They're coming from Amazon sales, which all the games redeem on Steam.

403
00:22:01,257 --> 00:22:02,118
[SPEAKER_10]: They had one today.

404
00:22:02,818 --> 00:22:03,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they got to compete.

405
00:22:04,479 --> 00:22:05,440
[SPEAKER_10]: They're doing a good job.

406
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,541
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3 is doing a similar approach.

407
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:09,582
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole, what is it, 13 for $13?

408
00:22:11,303 --> 00:22:14,364
[SPEAKER_02]: LittleBigPlanet Karting is $10 right now.

409
00:22:14,504 --> 00:22:15,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I ought to be pissed.

410
00:22:15,945 --> 00:22:17,806
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought that game when it was brand new, like $50.

411
00:22:18,906 --> 00:22:22,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Considering doing that, except we have some free goods that we're sitting on.

412
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:25,529
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to get them sent to me.

413
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,750
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to do that.

414
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,271
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually have a sale going on right now.

415
00:22:29,411 --> 00:22:32,312
[SPEAKER_10]: It's five game arcade packs.

416
00:22:33,173 --> 00:22:35,194
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought first, oh, Xbox Live Arcade.

417
00:22:35,234 --> 00:22:35,774
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not bad.

418
00:22:36,674 --> 00:22:39,735
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually Steam games, but they were featured on Xbox Live Arcade.

419
00:22:39,796 --> 00:22:39,896
[SPEAKER_10]: It's

420
00:22:40,996 --> 00:22:45,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, Deadlight, Iron Brigade, Mark of the Ninja, and Toy Soldiers for $10.

421
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:51,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Or, if you did purchase one of those packs during December, you get another $5 off.

422
00:22:51,601 --> 00:22:54,062
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I did, and so I got it for $5.

423
00:22:55,262 --> 00:22:57,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Five games for $5, that's not a bad deal.

424
00:22:57,223 --> 00:22:59,184
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, I'm kind of having this huge collection of...

425
00:22:59,884 --> 00:23:01,145
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

426
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:22,707
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of like the Fallout shelter of the game industry.

427
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:29,093
[SPEAKER_10]: If everything goes to shit with the new consoles, I at least have this backup library of games to play.

428
00:23:30,114 --> 00:23:31,615
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's going to be fun.

429
00:23:32,015 --> 00:23:34,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Some folks in chat talking about the price of LittleBigPlanet carding.

430
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:38,862
[SPEAKER_02]: CriticalMyth said carding was $10 with PlayStation Plus, I think.

431
00:23:38,922 --> 00:23:39,502
[SPEAKER_02]: That is correct.

432
00:23:39,522 --> 00:23:41,304
[SPEAKER_02]: The $10 price is when you have PlayStation Plus.

433
00:23:41,764 --> 00:23:43,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like $14 if you don't.

434
00:23:44,025 --> 00:23:44,626
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cheap.

435
00:23:44,986 --> 00:23:45,626
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still very cheap.

436
00:23:46,006 --> 00:23:48,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I paid $50 for it, so sit down.

437
00:23:50,068 --> 00:23:50,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically.

438
00:23:51,109 --> 00:23:52,730
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, thank you for the clarification.

439
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's for PlayStation Plus.

440
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:57,052
[SPEAKER_10]: And then what else did I play this week?

441
00:23:57,192 --> 00:23:58,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, other things.

442
00:23:58,773 --> 00:24:01,254
[SPEAKER_10]: More Call of Duty, of course, because we're still playing Call of Duty.

443
00:24:01,374 --> 00:24:02,715
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still trying to get them to play something else.

444
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:06,937
[SPEAKER_10]: I have been trying to softmod some Xbox systems.

445
00:24:06,977 --> 00:24:10,940
[SPEAKER_10]: You've found five Xbox systems in a closet, literally at my work.

446
00:24:12,961 --> 00:24:15,462
[SPEAKER_10]: But they're broken in different ways, each one.

447
00:24:15,522 --> 00:24:19,184
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to have to piece some together this week to get one that actually works.

448
00:24:19,244 --> 00:24:19,985
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got some that...

449
00:24:20,485 --> 00:24:21,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

450
00:24:45,095 --> 00:24:45,735
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty much it.

451
00:24:46,216 --> 00:24:48,857
[SPEAKER_10]: I meant to play some more console games, but just didn't get around to it.

452
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:51,037
[SPEAKER_10]: A little Borderlands 2, actually.

453
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:51,838
[SPEAKER_10]: We played a little bit of that.

454
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:52,318
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit.

455
00:24:53,438 --> 00:24:54,959
[SPEAKER_02]: My week was mostly console games.

456
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:57,880
[SPEAKER_02]: One console game that was a majority of my gaming time.

457
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,962
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a game I said I wasn't going to buy, and then I had a moment of weakness and I bought it anyway, and I'm actually glad I did.

458
00:25:03,022 --> 00:25:07,844
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Ni No Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch, which came out this week on PlayStation 3.

459
00:25:09,405 --> 00:25:12,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I've sunk, you know, keep in mind, guys, I was gone all weekend.

460
00:25:12,126 --> 00:25:14,548
[SPEAKER_02]: I sunk about eight hours into the game during the week.

461
00:25:15,888 --> 00:25:20,351
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those that have played the game, and I'll keep this as spoiler-free as possible, I'm at the volcano.

462
00:25:21,292 --> 00:25:22,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, there's a volcano in the game somewhere.

463
00:25:23,353 --> 00:25:24,233
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about where I'm at.

464
00:25:24,253 --> 00:25:31,978
[SPEAKER_02]: But keep in mind, I've done, like, every side quest, and I'm very OC about kind of trying to do everything, and there is a lot of side quests and things you can do.

465
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:32,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

466
00:25:34,139 --> 00:25:37,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Nino Cooney, first off, the first thing you're going to notice about the game is the graphics.

467
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,540
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gorgeous game.

468
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,121
[SPEAKER_02]: It's level 5.

469
00:25:40,501 --> 00:25:48,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew they'd done Dragon Quest VIII and all that, but it didn't really click for me until I started playing Nino Cooney.

470
00:25:48,183 --> 00:25:52,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, why does this feel a lot like White Knight Chronicles to me?

471
00:25:53,144 --> 00:25:54,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, because level five did that game.

472
00:25:54,665 --> 00:25:56,345
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't let that comparison scare you off.

473
00:25:56,405 --> 00:26:03,388
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just they have like that, like the fonts are similar and some of the graphics are a little similar, but the art styles very, very different.

474
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:04,528
[SPEAKER_02]: The gameplay is very different, too.

475
00:26:04,568 --> 00:26:08,530
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want people like who didn't like White Knight Chronicles to say like, oh, well, fuck that then.

476
00:26:10,131 --> 00:26:13,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I do think, though, White Knight Chronicles is underrated, but that's another episode.

477
00:26:14,893 --> 00:26:17,935
[SPEAKER_02]: There's great graphics in the game.

478
00:26:18,256 --> 00:26:33,248
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing I really like about it is that it goes from, you know, you got this in-game anime style rendering that goes on to actual cut scenes that Studio Ghibli did of anime that's intermixed in with the game.

479
00:26:33,748 --> 00:26:43,016
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very interesting to me how you'll get these full-blown anime sequences and then you get some voiced over sequences and then you get text, like read the text.

480
00:26:43,596 --> 00:27:06,605
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't know like it doesn't bother me as much as it bothers other people because maybe that's just what I grew up on you know back in my day when I played Final Fantasy 6 or as we were calling it Final Fantasy 3 because you know we didn't have the internet back then I didn't know that there were more games in Japan we would read all the text you know that's just kind of how you did it so it doesn't really bother me as much um

481
00:27:07,745 --> 00:27:08,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

482
00:27:28,717 --> 00:27:31,038
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also that whole Pokemon element of the game.

483
00:27:31,338 --> 00:27:33,019
[SPEAKER_02]: And this slowly unfolds.

484
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:35,041
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you don't have it all right in the very beginning.

485
00:27:35,081 --> 00:27:37,362
[SPEAKER_02]: It slowly unfolds over the first few hours of the game.

486
00:27:37,702 --> 00:27:42,825
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, many of the monsters you run across in-game, you can actually capture and you use them in battle.

487
00:27:43,145 --> 00:27:45,847
[SPEAKER_02]: And the battle system is really interesting.

488
00:27:45,907 --> 00:27:47,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where the demo really failed.

489
00:27:48,248 --> 00:27:52,931
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know a lot of folks, you know, I'm sure a lot of you here at VOG heard Bobby talk about how he hated the demo.

490
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:57,013
[SPEAKER_02]: And I even said it was really disappointing as well, too, because it didn't really explain...

491
00:27:57,453 --> 00:27:58,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

492
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:47,077
[SPEAKER_02]: so the the battle sequences are actually very intricate they're kind of Final Fantasy 12-ish in that you actually run around a little battlefield and you're you know doing the auto attack and you might cast magic and you actually collect a little health and magic capsules that help you out uh on the uh battlefield and um yeah I it's it's a neat system um

493
00:28:47,877 --> 00:28:58,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the battles can be challenging, but there is an easy mode, or as I call easy modes in games now, thanks to some inside jokes here at the VOG Network, I call it Black Wolf Fun Forever mode, BFF mode.

494
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:06,361
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, there is a Black Wolf Fun Forever mode, or easy mode in the game, and I haven't had to use it yet, but I'm not afraid to if I run into a wall.

495
00:29:07,081 --> 00:29:08,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I have really loved the story so far.

496
00:29:09,382 --> 00:29:10,302
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been fantastic.

497
00:29:10,902 --> 00:29:22,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I have read some things online that a lot of critics were starting to razz the game around the 15 hour mark that it starts to get really grindy and that the story loses a lot of steam and so forth.

498
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:23,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not there yet.

499
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:25,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't comment on that.

500
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:28,970
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I'm talking about how much I'm into this game, you might want to take that with a grain of salt.

501
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:29,870
[SPEAKER_02]: I said it right up front.

502
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:34,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm only eight hours into the game, but it's a damn fine eight hours that I've spent so far.

503
00:29:34,312 --> 00:29:37,854
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's more I can say about other games that I've plunked a large sum of money on.

504
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,235
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, take it or leave it.

505
00:29:40,635 --> 00:29:42,016
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having a great time with the game so far.

506
00:29:42,096 --> 00:29:43,596
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do plan to finish it.

507
00:29:43,676 --> 00:29:44,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see why I wouldn't at this point.

508
00:29:45,437 --> 00:29:46,537
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

509
00:29:47,258 --> 00:29:47,938
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend it.

510
00:29:48,218 --> 00:29:48,998
[SPEAKER_02]: At least rent it.

511
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,599
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't go off that demo.

512
00:29:50,639 --> 00:29:51,419
[SPEAKER_02]: The demo was terrible.

513
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:57,862
[SPEAKER_02]: The demo... All they had to do was back up the demo about 20 minutes to really explain.

514
00:29:58,242 --> 00:29:59,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the demo...

515
00:30:01,023 --> 00:30:10,167
[SPEAKER_02]: where you're fighting the boss monster takes place about 20 minutes after you get your little Pokemon or your little monster for the first time and it explains how all that works.

516
00:30:10,687 --> 00:30:18,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand why they didn't just back the demo up 20 minutes and let you play through that little dungeon-y area to the boss and then end the demo there.

517
00:30:18,911 --> 00:30:24,833
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a poor, poor, poor decision and it's causing some people to think twice about the game.

518
00:30:26,334 --> 00:30:26,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.

519
00:30:27,254 --> 00:30:28,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Demos are important, y'all.

520
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:33,114
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's see.

521
00:30:33,154 --> 00:30:33,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to the chat room.

522
00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:38,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Breakman says, interesting is not a word that most listeners want to hear as a description of a game.

523
00:30:39,201 --> 00:30:41,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Interest equals what the fuck was the dev thinking?

524
00:30:41,623 --> 00:30:43,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, they could have done a better job.

525
00:30:44,807 --> 00:30:47,470
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're being as vague as apparently I am.

526
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:50,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, why do you think the dev was smoking crack?

527
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:51,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what do you think they could have done a better job?

528
00:30:53,315 --> 00:30:55,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'm missing something about that comment.

529
00:30:55,376 --> 00:31:01,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but I don't... You know, where's the part that I'm not catching, apparently?

530
00:31:01,497 --> 00:31:09,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, those are live comments at our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com Some other comments on the game in our chatroom.

531
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:14,361
[SPEAKER_02]: DungeonBuster says, Still liking the game right now, even with the issues, though I'm a big fan of Ghibli's stuff.

532
00:31:15,181 --> 00:31:18,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Dungeon Buster also says, Battle system kind of falls apart later.

533
00:31:18,422 --> 00:31:20,982
[SPEAKER_02]: The AI roles for your party members is kind of challenged.

534
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:37,086
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I am noticing that a little bit, that the party members are very liberal in their use of magic, which is very unlike the style I play with, and I can see where that gets really frustrating, but I think it's manageable right now.

535
00:31:37,386 --> 00:31:41,347
[SPEAKER_02]: And you always get to fill up on your HP and MP before a boss, so I'm not...

536
00:31:44,008 --> 00:31:48,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not hating it as much as other people do.

537
00:31:50,932 --> 00:31:51,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

538
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:56,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Loco Poco says, I love Studio Ghibli, but honestly, I didn't like the battle system in the demo at all.

539
00:31:56,216 --> 00:31:56,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you couldn't have.

540
00:31:56,836 --> 00:31:57,597
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't explain it.

541
00:31:59,218 --> 00:31:59,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

542
00:31:59,538 --> 00:32:04,942
[SPEAKER_02]: RawSteelUT says, All Breakman is saying is that interesting is what people tend to say when they can't be wholly complimentary.

543
00:32:05,402 --> 00:32:11,946
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I'm scared to be wholly complimentary because of what I'm seeing or what I've heard about the future and so forth.

544
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:13,608
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

545
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:14,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I am enjoying it.

546
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:21,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, if I were to judge this game on the eight hours alone, I would say yes, this is a must-buy if you love JRPGs.

547
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:23,455
[SPEAKER_02]: But then is that really fair?

548
00:32:23,783 --> 00:32:25,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you judge it on white barf?

549
00:32:26,425 --> 00:32:29,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and there are all these types of little references and jokes that I love.

550
00:32:29,908 --> 00:32:33,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there is a look for it in the grocery store in the very beginning of the game.

551
00:32:33,811 --> 00:32:36,793
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little sign in the background that says, what does it say?

552
00:32:36,853 --> 00:32:39,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yay, milk, it's white barf or something like that.

553
00:32:40,015 --> 00:32:40,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what?

554
00:32:41,016 --> 00:32:44,639
[SPEAKER_05]: AkumaJP says, without Ghibli, the game is just another rogue galaxy.

555
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,821
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't agree.

556
00:32:48,562 --> 00:32:48,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

557
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:48,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

558
00:32:50,672 --> 00:33:02,857
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's... I mean, the Ghibli stuff lends itself great, but Studio Ghibli wasn't involved with Dragon Quest VIII, and that was a lot of the similar things I like in both games.

559
00:33:04,337 --> 00:33:06,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, there you go.

560
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:07,919
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my thoughts.

561
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:08,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it or leave it.

562
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:15,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let you know next week after another eight hours of the game if I'm still as enthusiastic about the game as I am now.

563
00:33:16,923 --> 00:33:20,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us move on and talk about a little bit of housekeeping tonight.

564
00:33:46,362 --> 00:33:48,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome, unsolicited things.

565
00:33:48,864 --> 00:33:51,967
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to share with you guys something that was donated to the show this week.

566
00:33:52,027 --> 00:33:54,049
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't money, but it's still pretty awesome.

567
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:54,789
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys want to see it?

568
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:58,192
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got a gift this week, FedEx, here to the studio.

569
00:33:58,592 --> 00:33:58,972
[SPEAKER_02]: So you ready?

570
00:33:59,953 --> 00:34:00,294
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

571
00:34:00,694 --> 00:34:01,314
[SPEAKER_06]: No peeking!

572
00:34:01,795 --> 00:34:02,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

573
00:34:02,235 --> 00:34:04,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it's chocolate, because I want some.

574
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:06,879
[SPEAKER_05]: No peeking!

575
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:09,181
[SPEAKER_10]: If you guessed Rabid Weasel, you are correct.

576
00:34:09,621 --> 00:34:10,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a weasel.

577
00:34:14,161 --> 00:34:14,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Booze.

578
00:34:15,182 --> 00:34:16,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone sent us booze.

579
00:34:16,703 --> 00:34:20,546
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Brad from Pod Culture, who also... Do not open this in front of me.

580
00:34:20,566 --> 00:34:20,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I will throw up.

581
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:23,068
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought that might have actually been maple syrup for a second there.

582
00:34:23,168 --> 00:34:23,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, why?

583
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,129
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not a fan?

584
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:28,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything that's fake cinnamon, if I remotely smell it, makes me nauseous.

585
00:34:29,573 --> 00:34:30,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, look at that.

586
00:34:30,534 --> 00:34:34,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe you would talk negatively about a gift so graciously bestowed.

587
00:34:34,196 --> 00:34:34,497
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

588
00:34:34,637 --> 00:34:35,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate the gift.

589
00:34:35,778 --> 00:34:36,498
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very nice.

590
00:34:36,698 --> 00:34:40,421
[SPEAKER_05]: But anything that is... For real, I'm the same way with Spearmint.

591
00:34:41,422 --> 00:34:43,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Like anything that's real or fake Spearmint.

592
00:34:44,244 --> 00:34:45,064
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes me nauseous.

593
00:34:45,104 --> 00:34:46,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll say this more for me.

594
00:34:46,945 --> 00:34:47,425
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine by me.

595
00:34:47,445 --> 00:34:48,246
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome to it.

596
00:34:48,266 --> 00:34:49,286
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine by me.

597
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:51,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'll try to smell it.

598
00:34:51,467 --> 00:34:51,927
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

599
00:34:52,027 --> 00:34:52,528
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

600
00:34:53,308 --> 00:34:54,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, no, don't open it.

601
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:55,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Save it for 500.

602
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:58,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Brad from Pod Culture sent that.

603
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:01,472
[SPEAKER_02]: He also donated the mics that we use here on the show.

604
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:02,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Which we appreciate.

605
00:35:02,532 --> 00:35:09,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Hand-me-downs from Pod Culture, but they work great, obviously, as you can hear, and help the quality of our show immensely.

606
00:35:10,299 --> 00:35:17,105
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a nice big bottle of Fireball cinnamon whiskey, and he gave me some mixer ideas to use with this as well.

607
00:35:18,185 --> 00:35:19,887
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks like it burned a hole in the back of the bottle.

608
00:35:20,728 --> 00:35:21,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray.

609
00:35:22,109 --> 00:35:23,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you.

610
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:29,175
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very nice of you to send it to us, and I'll see if it makes me ill.

611
00:35:30,277 --> 00:35:33,540
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll invite Rice Princess over for the 500th episode, she'll drink it.

612
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:37,664
[SPEAKER_05]: We should probably pick up some Goldschlager for that.

613
00:35:38,945 --> 00:35:40,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute, but Goldschlager is cinnamony too.

614
00:35:41,087 --> 00:35:41,747
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's butterscotch.

615
00:35:42,568 --> 00:35:43,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't Goldschlager butterscotch?

616
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I always taste the cinnamony.

617
00:35:45,531 --> 00:35:46,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you thinking like butternips?

618
00:35:47,032 --> 00:35:48,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking of.

619
00:35:48,774 --> 00:35:50,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Goldschlager just tastes like burning.

620
00:35:50,896 --> 00:35:51,156
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

621
00:35:51,837 --> 00:35:55,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about something else, too, I want to do in housekeeping.

622
00:35:55,639 --> 00:36:02,004
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to talk about an article that was on our website that our pal Bobby Blackwolf posted that I thought was really good.

623
00:36:02,404 --> 00:36:08,268
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't like to talk about this subject a lot on our show because it keeps coming up as news.

624
00:36:08,348 --> 00:36:11,691
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say for about the past four years, nothing this thing has done.

625
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,312
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been gaming news.

626
00:36:13,792 --> 00:36:15,634
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

627
00:36:34,531 --> 00:37:03,819
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I want to point out is that at vognetwork.com, Bobby, who does the show before us, did a great little article kind of reflecting back on the better days of G4 when it actually was kind of an extension of an online network about video games and things like that and how that all started and kind of being in the community when all that was going on because I never knew that some of their shows had live chat rooms that you could go in and actually like chat during the show and all that and I don't know.

628
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,320
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that out at vognetwork.com

629
00:37:35,658 --> 00:37:39,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's move on now, I guess, into some video game news.

630
00:37:39,739 --> 00:37:40,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was all my housekeeping.

631
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Booze and G4.

632
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, appropriate.

633
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

634
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on to what is going on this week in gaming.

635
00:37:46,581 --> 00:37:46,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

636
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:52,103
[SPEAKER_10]: So, one of the big things that happened this week was THQ's assets were finally auctioned off.

637
00:37:52,703 --> 00:38:00,485
[SPEAKER_10]: And, unfortunately, their original plan to have one person buy everything and then kind of get out of debt...

638
00:38:00,885 --> 00:38:01,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Just didn't happen.

639
00:38:01,806 --> 00:38:05,988
[SPEAKER_10]: So, THQ is no more and all of their assets have been split up.

640
00:38:07,288 --> 00:38:10,050
[SPEAKER_10]: So, here's what happened, where everything went.

641
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:19,115
[SPEAKER_10]: So, first thing, Relic and Company of Heroes, the IP that Relic had, actually went to Sega.

642
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:24,597
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Sega's going to be doing that, which makes sense because they have some RTS franchises that they work on.

643
00:38:25,258 --> 00:38:27,359
[SPEAKER_10]: So, that should be cool.

644
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:34,725
[SPEAKER_10]: and then, of course, THQ Montreal, the studio, as well as the two IPs, 1666 and Underdog.

645
00:38:35,686 --> 00:38:37,947
[SPEAKER_10]: Those went to Ubisoft.

646
00:38:38,548 --> 00:38:40,129
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're going to have that now.

647
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:44,112
[SPEAKER_10]: As well as, let's see, Evolve, which was an unannounced IP.

648
00:38:44,313 --> 00:38:48,156
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess they're also saying it's called Metamorphosis.

649
00:38:48,756 --> 00:38:49,857
[SPEAKER_10]: That went to Take-Two.

650
00:38:51,158 --> 00:38:54,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Volition and Saints Row, as well as...

651
00:38:56,238 --> 00:38:58,459
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was just those two.

652
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:02,682
[SPEAKER_10]: So Volition, the studio, and Saintsboro, and I'm assuming Red Faction and all that stuff.

653
00:39:03,082 --> 00:39:07,264
[SPEAKER_10]: That actually went to Koch, which is Deep Silver.

654
00:39:07,484 --> 00:39:08,845
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the studio name you'd recognize.

655
00:39:10,025 --> 00:39:14,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Homefront went to Crytek, which should be interesting if we get a sequel out of that.

656
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:15,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Metro...

657
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:30,994
[SPEAKER_10]: 2033 and Metro Last Light that went to Deep Silver as well and then South Park The Stick of Truth the license for that went to Ubisoft so they will be publishing that game later this year

658
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:34,576
[SPEAKER_10]: That game should have been almost done.

659
00:39:35,596 --> 00:39:37,917
[SPEAKER_10]: That was supposed to come out in what, April, right?

660
00:39:38,237 --> 00:39:40,278
[SPEAKER_10]: It was March, but then it got pushed a little bit.

661
00:39:40,318 --> 00:39:41,498
[SPEAKER_10]: It was supposed to be like second quarter.

662
00:39:42,399 --> 00:39:45,440
[SPEAKER_10]: So the other one was the WWE franchise.

663
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,100
[SPEAKER_10]: That went to take two as well.

664
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,702
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're going to be seeing that coming out on their 2K games license.

665
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:52,482
[SPEAKER_10]: But none for Darksiders.

666
00:39:53,063 --> 00:39:54,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing for Darksiders.

667
00:39:55,103 --> 00:39:58,465
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are very upset about that, which kind of surprised me.

668
00:39:58,505 --> 00:40:01,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you think there would be enough upset people, somebody would have bought it.

669
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:12,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, from what I read, there was, I guess there are other franchises, the same, was it Virgil or Vigil was working out.

670
00:40:12,921 --> 00:40:18,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, that was also very risky, I guess, as far as an investment goes, but you would think that they would...

671
00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:23,611
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have thrown a dollar down for it, but, you know, I don't know.

672
00:40:23,731 --> 00:40:26,573
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, some of these, actually, it's kind of funny what they paid for them.

673
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:28,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have to, like, pay all those employees.

674
00:40:28,834 --> 00:40:32,676
[SPEAKER_02]: A dollar might have bought you a studio, but then how do you pay the employees?

675
00:40:32,756 --> 00:40:33,857
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem.

676
00:40:33,937 --> 00:40:34,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody's got to bankroll.

677
00:40:34,877 --> 00:40:35,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Just buy the IP.

678
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:37,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Make a crappy cell phone game out of it or something.

679
00:40:37,899 --> 00:40:38,219
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

680
00:40:40,211 --> 00:40:40,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Resell it.

681
00:40:41,412 --> 00:40:41,772
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

682
00:40:43,433 --> 00:40:45,554
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, no one bought it.

683
00:40:46,395 --> 00:40:50,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Although it may go to someone else.

684
00:40:51,257 --> 00:41:01,503
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing too is we don't know who's going to end up with all of the back catalog stuff because that didn't necessarily go to the respective publishers that bought the new franchises.

685
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:04,265
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just the stuff that was coming out.

686
00:41:05,285 --> 00:41:08,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Older games, that's going to go to completely different people.

687
00:41:09,027 --> 00:41:12,569
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd be interested to see how that turns out.

688
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:21,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Ross Steel, UT, in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Considering Deep Silver's marketing ideas, I think Saints Row is in the right place.

689
00:41:21,933 --> 00:41:30,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's a very tongue-in-cheek comment, but I just collectively groaned at that because of that horrific story from last week with the quote-unquote sculpture.

690
00:41:31,557 --> 00:41:33,818
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's just a foreign company.

691
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,379
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's just like Australia.

692
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:39,842
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they can get away with, I think... Well, actually, I'm surprised they could kind of get away with that at all.

693
00:41:39,862 --> 00:41:40,863
[SPEAKER_10]: It was Britain, but that's all right.

694
00:41:41,463 --> 00:41:41,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Still.

695
00:41:41,843 --> 00:41:43,024
[SPEAKER_10]: It was Australian Europe.

696
00:41:43,224 --> 00:41:44,885
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, whatever.

697
00:41:46,626 --> 00:41:47,407
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of glad, though.

698
00:41:47,447 --> 00:41:52,970
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they're trying to, I guess, boost, I guess, their presence in the marketplace.

699
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:55,812
[SPEAKER_10]: And definitely, those are some game franchises that would do that.

700
00:41:56,452 --> 00:41:59,073
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not surprised to see, of course...

701
00:42:00,074 --> 00:42:28,384
[SPEAKER_10]: take two not buying Saints Row because that would compete too much with Grand Theft Auto and I was surprised actually EA didn't try to pick it up but maybe they thought that you know they've got some of their own stuff and they would just crowd their lineup or something I don't know that's true but they have Homefront I mean that's Crytek and Crytek is published by EA so yay another military shooter game to go along with the other two or three military shooter franchises that they own

702
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:38,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have to say somewhere in here, though, I like that the community has been so supportive of what's been going on at THQ.

703
00:42:38,153 --> 00:42:41,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, sometimes we see a lot of these layoffs happen.

704
00:42:41,074 --> 00:42:44,715
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's, it's not that the community doesn't, but the community has always been very good.

705
00:42:44,755 --> 00:42:49,157
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just saying, like, sometimes it seems like what happens at the employee level is really cold.

706
00:42:49,217 --> 00:42:51,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's a very cold treatment of what happens to people.

707
00:42:52,258 --> 00:42:59,100
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of got the sense here that like, you know, the CEO and a lot of people involved really, like, really felt bad.

708
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:04,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I think a lot of people... You didn't have to be a genius to see that something like this was coming.

709
00:43:05,384 --> 00:43:10,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the sense that there was at least compassion for the people that were affected.

710
00:43:10,508 --> 00:43:16,712
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly the community is like... I've seen other game studios posting, Hey, were you at THQ?

711
00:43:16,792 --> 00:43:18,033
[SPEAKER_02]: No longer.

712
00:43:18,233 --> 00:43:19,113
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hiring right now.

713
00:43:19,193 --> 00:43:20,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Come over here.

714
00:43:20,394 --> 00:43:21,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a lot of Twitter buzz.

715
00:43:22,296 --> 00:43:23,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's great.

716
00:43:23,136 --> 00:43:24,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that gamers are helping other gamers.

717
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:27,799
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't see that in a lot of areas...

718
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,921
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

719
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Dead Rising Dead Island

720
00:44:18,045 --> 00:44:19,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Dead Rising is pretty much done.

721
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:22,307
[SPEAKER_10]: There will be another one, but we know there's going to be another one.

722
00:44:22,447 --> 00:44:26,470
[SPEAKER_10]: The last couple haven't been fantastic.

723
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,612
[SPEAKER_10]: At least we know the next Saints Row game will have a great trailer, if nothing else.

724
00:44:32,194 --> 00:44:33,615
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a very over-the-top game.

725
00:44:33,915 --> 00:44:38,818
[SPEAKER_10]: I would be interested to see what they're going to do with it.

726
00:44:39,098 --> 00:44:40,959
[SPEAKER_10]: South Beach doesn't have a whole lot going for it right now.

727
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,601
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't have a lot of stuff that they're publishing.

728
00:44:42,621 --> 00:44:46,143
[SPEAKER_10]: That we know about, to be fair.

729
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Dead Island Dead Island

730
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:16,286
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's nice to see them actually have some good franchises now.

731
00:45:16,326 --> 00:45:20,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, expanding their catalog, I guess.

732
00:45:20,831 --> 00:45:23,373
[SPEAKER_10]: So that might be one I'd worry about a little bit.

733
00:45:23,413 --> 00:45:27,878
[SPEAKER_10]: But I was worried about Saints Row IV anyways when they're like,

734
00:45:28,098 --> 00:45:40,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we're going to take this standalone game expansion that was really just going to be Saints Row the Third with some other cheesy bullshit on top of it, and we're going to make that its own game.

735
00:45:40,828 --> 00:45:42,770
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and now we're going to make that Saints Row the Fourth.

736
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:53,839
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like... So I'm already kind of worried about the game just because of how they've treated it, especially with the DLC and stuff, so...

737
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:57,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully they build it into something good.

738
00:45:57,542 --> 00:45:58,823
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as they keep that humor.

739
00:45:59,363 --> 00:46:00,744
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as they still have all the same writers.

740
00:46:00,764 --> 00:46:03,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Saints Row 3 is so fucking funny.

741
00:46:03,266 --> 00:46:06,228
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say, I was trying to... I should have looked real quick.

742
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:08,830
[SPEAKER_10]: What they bought it for.

743
00:46:09,891 --> 00:46:11,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, if only you had the money.

744
00:46:11,872 --> 00:46:12,573
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

745
00:46:31,972 --> 00:46:32,913
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

746
00:46:52,686 --> 00:46:55,388
[SPEAKER_02]: is apparently ending production in Japan.

747
00:46:55,789 --> 00:47:01,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you forgot what the Neo Geo X was, you know, I think we all remember what the Neo Geo was many years ago.

748
00:47:01,113 --> 00:47:03,294
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that very expensive brick of a system.

749
00:47:03,594 --> 00:47:04,675
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a couple of them in my house.

750
00:47:05,316 --> 00:47:08,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and then they show up in arcade machines, right, and all that.

751
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,460
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what was awesome about them, though?

752
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:10,720
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

753
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Having the memory cards so you could save your game at the arcade and go home and play it.

754
00:47:14,743 --> 00:47:17,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised you didn't pick one of these up, these little Neo Geo Xs.

755
00:47:17,225 --> 00:47:17,865
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no point.

756
00:47:17,905 --> 00:47:20,087
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing on there that we didn't want that we don't already own.

757
00:47:20,387 --> 00:47:26,209
[SPEAKER_02]: So, well, and you would have lost your chance now anyway, because apparently the production of it has come to a halt in Japan.

758
00:47:26,249 --> 00:47:28,389
[SPEAKER_02]: These things just came out in December, so I don't know what's going on.

759
00:47:29,089 --> 00:47:33,451
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyhow... It's not actually discontinuing.

760
00:47:33,831 --> 00:47:33,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh?

761
00:47:34,691 --> 00:47:36,772
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the limited... What have you heard that I'm not hearing?

762
00:47:36,852 --> 00:47:44,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the limited edition is being discontinued, the one that comes with Ninja Master, but they're still producing it, I guess...

763
00:47:46,114 --> 00:47:52,600
[SPEAKER_10]: and Blaze, which is one of the distributors, said it's still being available.

764
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,263
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just that the limited edition that was originally the launch lineup is no more.

765
00:47:56,643 --> 00:47:58,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there a follow-up that I missed or something?

766
00:47:58,344 --> 00:47:59,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm not seeing that.

767
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:00,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they did a follow-up.

768
00:48:01,527 --> 00:48:02,848
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a few places around it.

769
00:48:02,928 --> 00:48:04,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Eurogamer is one that had it.

770
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:07,792
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to say, I'm trying to think.

771
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:11,175
[SPEAKER_10]: And Gadget also had it.

772
00:48:11,395 --> 00:48:14,698
[SPEAKER_10]: They were saying, I guess, I don't know.

773
00:48:16,178 --> 00:48:19,821
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I read it, that they were... It wasn't quite discontinued.

774
00:48:19,921 --> 00:48:24,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm interested to see how long this can kind of... Do you think something like this can sustain itself?

775
00:48:24,545 --> 00:48:30,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably, it's... Since we all believe the fact that it would have disappeared as quick as it showed up... It really should have.

776
00:48:30,529 --> 00:48:37,215
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, no offense, it's just... I mean, the handheld device itself, it's very similar to what I have with the Dingu.

777
00:48:37,735 --> 00:48:39,717
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like this arm...

778
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:40,878
[SPEAKER_10]: But...

779
00:49:05,373 --> 00:49:06,654
[SPEAKER_10]: No, apparently it is.

780
00:49:06,794 --> 00:49:07,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's still going.

781
00:49:08,294 --> 00:49:21,620
[SPEAKER_10]: And even in the US, they said Tomo Inc., the company behind the Neo Geo X, says the production hasn't ceased on the main Neo Geo standalone handheld, but has ceased on the Neo Geo X Gold Limited Edition.

782
00:49:22,441 --> 00:49:23,841
[SPEAKER_10]: But that was the plan anyways.

783
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe I wanted the Limited Edition.

784
00:49:26,582 --> 00:49:32,405
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're saying they're going to add more games and peripherals and software updates.

785
00:49:35,652 --> 00:49:42,535
[SPEAKER_02]: GameGuru in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says they should just put out the Neo Geo games on PC like Sega does for Genesis games.

786
00:49:43,375 --> 00:49:46,356
[SPEAKER_02]: A few of them are on Wii Virtual Console.

787
00:49:47,736 --> 00:49:50,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't some of them on PlayStation 3 as well?

788
00:49:50,197 --> 00:49:50,938
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe so.

789
00:49:50,998 --> 00:49:58,520
[SPEAKER_02]: I think PlayStation 3 has a few of those games and they're not PS1 classics, obviously, but like a similar classics library.

790
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,041
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they call it like SNK Collection.

791
00:50:00,401 --> 00:50:03,142
[SPEAKER_02]: You do see those Neo Geo games kind of pop up other places.

792
00:50:03,602 --> 00:50:04,543
[SPEAKER_02]: But, correct.

793
00:50:04,563 --> 00:50:05,624
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think PC's one of them.

794
00:50:06,145 --> 00:50:08,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, you know, you just, like, download MAME.

795
00:50:09,428 --> 00:50:12,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I told you to do that, but we all know.

796
00:50:12,831 --> 00:50:13,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

797
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:15,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on with more news.

798
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:15,514
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

799
00:50:16,807 --> 00:50:23,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, now we know that there's been rumors going around about what is going to be the new Xbox.

800
00:50:24,371 --> 00:50:26,853
[SPEAKER_05]: And we know that there was that completely fabricated story.

801
00:50:27,653 --> 00:50:33,257
[SPEAKER_05]: So, this though is actually what I found was looking to be quite a bit different.

802
00:50:34,777 --> 00:50:37,619
[SPEAKER_05]: They're actually talking about specs up for the system itself.

803
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:40,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Talking about it under the code name Durango.

804
00:50:41,824 --> 00:50:44,567
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, again, I don't know if it has anything to do with the rumor.

805
00:50:44,747 --> 00:50:47,870
[SPEAKER_02]: We take everything with a huge grain of salt when it comes to these type of rumors, right?

806
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:49,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, especially since that other story was fabricated.

807
00:50:50,032 --> 00:50:52,274
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, it's quite a bit different.

808
00:50:52,394 --> 00:51:06,108
[SPEAKER_05]: So, they're saying that it's codenamed Durango and that they have a little bit of the tech saying that it's supposed to run on an 8-core CPU, an AMD CPU at 1.6 gigahertz, just like the new PlayStation thing.

809
00:51:06,968 --> 00:51:33,706
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, that it's, uh, running on the, um, Jaguar technology And, uh, apparently, uh, it's supposed to be working with a 32, uh, uh, meg of RAM and 8 gigabytes of memory Of, uh, it looks like, I think they're graphic memory So, it's looking pretty, pretty big I mean, again, I don't know if this is actually true But, it seems to make sense and looks pretty impressive

810
00:51:35,598 --> 00:51:38,520
[SPEAKER_02]: To be fair, Microsoft does have a history of stuff leaking out.

811
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:48,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we do know there was that guy on Tumblr that was all, I'm so sick of people making shit up about Microsoft rumors, I'm going to make shit up about Microsoft and spread it all over the internet to prove a point.

812
00:51:49,325 --> 00:51:50,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, dude, point made.

813
00:51:51,886 --> 00:51:58,090
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, so there's all that fake stuff out there, but you also know what they say, where there's smoke, there's fire.

814
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:01,591
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are the types of things people are talking about and speculating and so forth.

815
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:02,212
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

816
00:52:03,072 --> 00:52:10,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Aside from saying this is true, because we don't know if it's true or not, what do you think about if it was true?

817
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:14,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think this could be the direction that Microsoft should be going in?

818
00:52:14,434 --> 00:52:19,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'll tell you this, that crap that was made up on the Tumblr and all that, that sounded awful.

819
00:52:20,255 --> 00:52:28,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I should say it sounded cool, but in reality, the whole tablet being that much integrated, it just didn't sound feasible.

820
00:52:29,077 --> 00:52:30,277
[SPEAKER_02]: It just wasn't going to work.

821
00:52:30,477 --> 00:52:30,717
[SPEAKER_02]: This...

822
00:52:32,477 --> 00:52:37,680
[SPEAKER_05]: This didn't say anything about the tablet at all.

823
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,600
[SPEAKER_05]: It just talked about running power.

824
00:52:40,861 --> 00:52:52,306
[SPEAKER_05]: It also was comparing it with the Orbis graphics for the new PlayStation and saying that still the Orbis is turning out to be probably more powerful in terms of graphic capability than the new Xbox.

825
00:52:52,766 --> 00:52:52,886
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

826
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:57,981
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds pretty much what I expected anyway.

827
00:52:58,301 --> 00:53:06,149
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to go with, I think, more of processing with, I think, more in terms of how the Xbox is now.

828
00:53:06,189 --> 00:53:09,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, focus on the games, how they play, not necessarily exactly how they look.

829
00:53:10,734 --> 00:53:13,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, Sony has always been about flash.

830
00:53:15,419 --> 00:53:22,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it'll be interesting to see, but at the end of the day, we won't really know until E3, but more speculation to continue until then.

831
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:30,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Look around E3 week, though, because didn't Microsoft's entire presentation get blown the morning of their press conference or something this last year?

832
00:53:31,771 --> 00:53:34,153
[SPEAKER_02]: The Halo 4 stuff all leaked out or something?

833
00:53:35,494 --> 00:53:36,655
[SPEAKER_02]: It was either this year or last year.

834
00:53:36,795 --> 00:53:40,318
[SPEAKER_02]: It just all went on the internet the day of or something.

835
00:53:40,338 --> 00:53:41,018
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crazy.

836
00:53:41,459 --> 00:53:43,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, more news, Logie.

837
00:53:45,325 --> 00:53:48,427
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so kind of a similar thing with the PlayStation 3.

838
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:53,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Kotaku apparently received some documentation.

839
00:53:54,571 --> 00:53:55,792
[SPEAKER_10]: 90 PDFs, they say.

840
00:53:55,972 --> 00:53:58,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, that's a lot of PDFs.

841
00:54:00,174 --> 00:54:13,443
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is being released by an individual known as SuperDAE, which you may remember was one of the guys that sold one of the Xbox development kits, the brand new ones for the next system, on eBay, or at least attempted to sell one.

842
00:54:14,243 --> 00:54:17,245
[SPEAKER_10]: and some of the details coming from that.

843
00:54:17,305 --> 00:54:23,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Spec-wise, of course, they're saying that it's going to have 8 gigs of RAM, 2.2 gigabytes of video RAM.

844
00:54:24,109 --> 00:54:31,653
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to have a CPU that's built out of four dual-core AMD 64 bulldozer processors, so a total of eight cores.

845
00:54:32,133 --> 00:54:36,255
[SPEAKER_10]: A GPU that's AMD R10XX.

846
00:54:36,535 --> 00:54:41,238
[SPEAKER_10]: They haven't really said what kind of GPU yet, but something around that spec.

847
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:52,173
[SPEAKER_10]: 4 USB 3.0 ports, 2 Ethernet ports, a Blu-ray drive, of course, and a 160GB hard drive.

848
00:54:55,126 --> 00:55:01,768
[SPEAKER_10]: As well as they're saying HDMI optical 2.0, 5.1, and 7.1 channel sound.

849
00:55:01,928 --> 00:55:04,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is pretty much similar to what they have right now with the PlayStation 3.

850
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,471
[SPEAKER_10]: The controller, they're not really saying too much about it.

851
00:55:11,632 --> 00:55:12,332
[SPEAKER_10]: It could change.

852
00:55:14,153 --> 00:55:20,935
[SPEAKER_10]: They're saying that the difference right now with the controller is it's going to be similar to the Vita controller.

853
00:55:21,515 --> 00:55:24,900
[SPEAKER_10]: They're at least going to add some sort of touch sensor to the Vita.

854
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:30,606
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Robin mentioned that's probably that stupid back touch panel thing.

855
00:55:31,187 --> 00:55:31,888
[SPEAKER_10]: God, I hope not.

856
00:55:32,048 --> 00:55:33,750
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be a waste of time.

857
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:38,155
[SPEAKER_10]: But right now they're saying that it's got... Stop trying to make back touch happen.

858
00:55:41,378 --> 00:55:42,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Some sort of touchpad on there.

859
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:48,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe even another... I don't know if they're going to have an actual screen or something on that.

860
00:55:49,504 --> 00:55:57,049
[SPEAKER_10]: They're also doing something with the account management right now where you're going to be able to link local accounts together.

861
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:00,392
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really know what that's supposed to do as far as maybe...

862
00:56:03,203 --> 00:56:03,563
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

863
00:56:03,603 --> 00:56:04,324
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

864
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:30,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Could this be all angsty Tumblr person made up too?

865
00:56:31,461 --> 00:56:38,926
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think so because the guy has had access to what was supposed to be a kit.

866
00:56:39,206 --> 00:56:44,809
[SPEAKER_10]: This is supposed to be coming from a developer kit for the next PlayStation system.

867
00:56:45,209 --> 00:56:49,933
[SPEAKER_10]: So, a lot of this could change, but it's just getting closer to the specs right now.

868
00:56:50,413 --> 00:56:54,796
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think you're really going to know until the system comes out, but everyone wants to speculate.

869
00:56:54,816 --> 00:56:58,699
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you compare this to the Durango...

870
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:20,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Xbox Lube specs, they're both very similar 8 core processors, you're going to have a pretty high end video card in there 8 gigs of RAM, HDMI, USB 3.0 stuff and Blu-ray so they're both pretty similar as far as that goes it's going to be how they use that

871
00:57:21,618 --> 00:57:22,199
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

872
00:57:42,495 --> 00:57:43,296
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

873
00:58:05,056 --> 00:58:14,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to the Times this week and in the business section mentioned kind of in passing that they're waiting to see what Microsoft does before making any announcements regarding PlayStation 4.

874
00:58:14,882 --> 00:58:18,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Harai goes as far to say they're going to let Microsoft make the first move.

875
00:58:19,065 --> 00:58:22,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how much of that is kind of like, you know, kind of paraphrasing or what.

876
00:58:22,647 --> 00:58:30,772
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, the quote from the original article is, why go first when your competitors can look at your specifications and come up with something better?

877
00:58:32,034 --> 00:58:32,514
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

878
00:58:52,901 --> 00:58:54,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and they do what works for them.

879
00:58:55,283 --> 00:59:02,868
[SPEAKER_02]: A story I don't think is coming up on tonight's show, but I was reading a little bit about beforehand, was what were the top 20 selling games in Japan last year?

880
00:59:03,448 --> 00:59:05,029
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like all Nintendo games.

881
00:59:05,049 --> 00:59:07,351
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no Xbox, of course, because it's Japan.

882
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:09,912
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a spittering of PlayStation 3.

883
00:59:10,193 --> 00:59:11,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Resident Evil 6 was in there.

884
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:16,076
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a random PSP game that was some robot game.

885
00:59:16,097 --> 00:59:18,118
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of it is Nintendo.

886
00:59:18,158 --> 00:59:19,119
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's my thought.

887
00:59:19,499 --> 00:59:22,501
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Japan's a pretty decent-sized market, but I mean,

888
00:59:23,281 --> 00:59:31,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Aren't they declining as far as their market share in the whole big span of everything worldwide?

889
00:59:32,127 --> 00:59:33,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Console sales and game sales.

890
00:59:33,828 --> 00:59:36,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty soon, that's not going to matter.

891
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:41,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's how the purchasing goes in Australia.

892
00:59:41,072 --> 00:59:44,234
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not going to matter that the consoles don't do well in there.

893
00:59:45,675 --> 00:59:45,955
[SPEAKER_10]: I think.

894
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:51,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Other interesting comment from chat here, talking about the PlayStation 4.

895
00:59:51,992 --> 00:59:59,074
[SPEAKER_02]: RossDLUT says, especially with Sony, who can ill afford another $599 US dollars fiasco.

896
01:00:00,255 --> 01:00:03,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Piggybacking on that, maybe wait for some of the tech to become cheaper.

897
01:00:04,096 --> 01:00:05,317
[SPEAKER_02]: before they launched their system.

898
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:07,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Storing it out there.

899
01:00:07,959 --> 01:00:09,701
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think in hearing what he says?

900
01:00:09,761 --> 01:00:21,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I want to say I saw something else that came out after this that was kind of like, you know, that Sony's, like, this doesn't mean that we're not going to, you know, do something competitive or whatever, because obviously they want to keep investors happy.

901
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:23,492
[SPEAKER_02]: But what do you think this all means, Loki?

902
01:00:23,532 --> 01:00:28,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think there might be actual reason for there not to show the PlayStation 4 this year?

903
01:00:28,636 --> 01:00:29,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that might actually come to life?

904
01:00:30,307 --> 01:00:34,889
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if they're going to show it or not, but I don't think that they can really wait too long.

905
01:00:35,029 --> 01:00:54,255
[SPEAKER_10]: If you think about it, they can't really make their system spec-wise so much greater than the X. I mean, they're not going to do that for one, because of cost, and two, because when these games are being put out on multi-platforms, which they're probably going to, you're not going to really see that much of a benefit to having additional...

906
01:00:54,955 --> 01:01:03,224
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I guess additional power, the game might play a little bit better, but most of the time they're going to be developing it across the board.

907
01:01:03,244 --> 01:01:04,285
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be similar.

908
01:01:04,305 --> 01:01:09,410
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if you look at the PlayStation 3 versus the Xbox 360, wasn't the PlayStation 3 supposed to be a more powerful system?

909
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:16,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Yet a lot of the games that come out on the PlayStation 3 chug and just don't even have the frame rate that the Xbox 360 games do.

910
01:01:17,478 --> 01:01:19,301
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know.

911
01:01:19,441 --> 01:01:24,027
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that they should take the safe approach, actually.

912
01:01:26,089 --> 01:01:31,977
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of wondering what they're going to do with extra things or gimmicks with these controllers because...

913
01:01:33,138 --> 01:01:34,599
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't work with six axis.

914
01:01:35,479 --> 01:01:36,519
[SPEAKER_10]: They tried to make it happen.

915
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:37,480
[SPEAKER_10]: It just wasn't working.

916
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:42,121
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't think touch controls are really going to add anything either.

917
01:01:42,181 --> 01:01:43,082
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just going to be annoying.

918
01:01:43,102 --> 01:01:48,184
[SPEAKER_02]: And move hasn't really taken off either, even though move is actually one of the better motion controls.

919
01:01:48,224 --> 01:01:49,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think it is actually pretty good.

920
01:01:50,084 --> 01:01:50,985
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very accurate.

921
01:01:51,145 --> 01:01:57,487
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I was trying to use... In fact, I was trying to play Connect Party today to show my son this stuff, and we have a window behind...

922
01:01:57,967 --> 01:02:09,240
[SPEAKER_10]: you know the team or where the you know in the view of the connect and it wasn't working because there was sun outside and so connect is like saying fuck you i am not working um

923
01:02:10,934 --> 01:02:34,667
[SPEAKER_10]: so yeah i mean it seems like the move stuff works pretty good but like even you know uh nelly was like so this is supposed to be some big you know motion controller thing i'm like yeah well the next one that comes out probably be way better than this is just the first generation of it but then they they never work as good as they say they're going to never that's why i'm gonna wait you know because i've already been fooled three or four times

924
01:02:35,895 --> 01:02:40,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting perspective from AkumaJP in our chatroom, who actually lives in Japan.

925
01:02:40,578 --> 01:02:46,261
[SPEAKER_02]: AkumaJP at live.vognetwork.com saying, Yeah, almost all mobile phone now.

926
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:50,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Even Tokyo Game Show from last year was all Gris, Mobage, all mobile now.

927
01:02:51,404 --> 01:02:53,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Even we all now almost all mobile.

928
01:02:54,511 --> 01:03:00,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, you know, I want to say when I looked at that list, it was a lot of 3DS stuff you even saw there.

929
01:03:00,134 --> 01:03:06,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, portable, which, you know, it doesn't surprise me that that's, you know, it's just, it's a different culture in Japan.

930
01:03:06,478 --> 01:03:07,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Very different.

931
01:03:07,939 --> 01:03:12,822
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot more of the, you know, commuters than you might have here and so forth.

932
01:03:13,282 --> 01:03:20,366
[SPEAKER_02]: And just, you know, especially in places like Tokyo, smaller living spaces where you don't have, like Kinect just doesn't fucking work there, right?

933
01:03:20,386 --> 01:03:20,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

934
01:03:20,806 --> 01:03:49,383
[SPEAKER_02]: so you know handhelds are the way to go so just different but the sad thing is we got a lot of mobile stuff here too but I don't think I don't want to see mobile replace gaming there's a lot that mobile can't do although ironically enough we have a an interesting story tonight about a online type of game that's trying to emulate console a little more but there's so much that mobile can't do like it just can't give you that same experience I don't know so

935
01:03:51,051 --> 01:04:16,037
[SPEAKER_05]: He also explains Mobile Gay as a mobile game Oh, I see, it was an abbreviation Well, let's move on, DarkSakura As soon as I can get it I'm on my iPad again Okay, well this is a game I brought up during what I was playing And I just played a little bit of it this week because honestly I wanted a nap It's called Chompston And it's a mix of Pac-Man and Bomberman

936
01:04:16,297 --> 01:04:17,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, so you're saying this game puts you to sleep?

937
01:04:18,299 --> 01:04:20,040
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I was sleepy already.

938
01:04:22,081 --> 01:04:30,828
[SPEAKER_05]: The game is actually, the sound effects work in time with the music, kind of like how, great, now I can't think of the puzzle game.

939
01:04:32,189 --> 01:04:32,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Luminous.

940
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:34,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Luminous, exactly.

941
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:40,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of like how Luminous did, so as you get the dots and throw bombs, it works in time with the music.

942
01:04:41,016 --> 01:04:42,357
[SPEAKER_05]: The music in the game is actually pretty neat.

943
01:04:43,669 --> 01:04:45,351
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

944
01:05:01,989 --> 01:05:03,790
[SPEAKER_05]: and you get different power-ups for them as well.

945
01:05:04,231 --> 01:05:17,240
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really neat, but you download the game at, and I'm going to have to say out the site, ContraLogic.com slash games slash Chompston, C-H-O-M-P-S-T-O-N.

946
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:18,961
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely worth your time.

947
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:23,304
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a fun game and it gets tricky, so support them.

948
01:05:25,532 --> 01:05:25,852
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

949
01:05:26,972 --> 01:05:29,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

950
01:05:29,673 --> 01:05:34,694
[SPEAKER_02]: If for whatever reason you've already worn out Chompston and you want to check out something else this week.

951
01:05:35,615 --> 01:05:36,755
[SPEAKER_02]: What's coming out to a store near you?

952
01:05:37,135 --> 01:05:38,135
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a whole lot this week.

953
01:05:38,175 --> 01:05:43,437
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty much the Hitman HD Trilogy on PS3 and Xbox 360.

954
01:05:45,257 --> 01:05:55,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, if you were looking for a new PlayStation 3 console, they have the new 500GB one, you know, the one that came with the Instant Game Collection, basically the PlayStation Plus for a year.

955
01:05:55,662 --> 01:05:58,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they have that now in white, in case you didn't want a black console.

956
01:05:59,724 --> 01:06:04,986
[SPEAKER_10]: And... That's pretty much it.

957
01:06:05,846 --> 01:06:07,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, it was supposed to be this week, Heavy Fire...

958
01:06:09,688 --> 01:06:16,456
[SPEAKER_10]: Shattered Spear but that probably got delayed because massive games never fucking come out on time

959
01:06:20,215 --> 01:06:23,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's travel to Japan and check out what's coming out in Japan.

960
01:06:24,497 --> 01:06:27,058
[SPEAKER_02]: If anything, it's been kind of slow lately.

961
01:06:27,118 --> 01:06:29,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's one thing on the radar on the Xbox 360.

962
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:33,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Love Toray, bitter version in limited and regular edition.

963
01:06:33,982 --> 01:06:37,203
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your lone Xbox 360 release, but we already talked about Xbox 360.

964
01:06:37,283 --> 01:06:38,804
[SPEAKER_05]: I completely misheard you say that.

965
01:06:38,844 --> 01:06:40,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you said toire, which means toilet.

966
01:06:41,937 --> 01:06:42,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, no.

967
01:06:43,638 --> 01:06:51,321
[SPEAKER_02]: On PlayStation 3, Excel World, Kasoku no Choten, also in regular and limited editions from Bandai Namco, comes out this week.

968
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:53,502
[SPEAKER_02]: FIFA Street gets a price reduction.

969
01:06:53,722 --> 01:06:56,663
[SPEAKER_02]: And in Japan this week, PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.

970
01:06:56,803 --> 01:07:01,265
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize they didn't get the game when we did, but they are now getting their version this week on the PlayStation 3.

971
01:07:01,545 --> 01:07:03,946
[SPEAKER_02]: January the 31st is when you can expect to see that.

972
01:07:04,506 --> 01:07:14,253
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Vita this week, also PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale and Sengoku Hime 3, Tenka Okirisaku Hikari Tokage comes out in regular and limited edition.

973
01:07:14,654 --> 01:07:16,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, they love their limited editions over there.

974
01:07:18,248 --> 01:07:21,629
[SPEAKER_02]: and unlike over here, their limited editions actually get filled most of the time.

975
01:07:21,809 --> 01:07:22,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'll get into that later.

976
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:23,890
[SPEAKER_05]: And usually have better stuff.

977
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:26,991
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Wii U, yes, there is a Wii U release this week.

978
01:07:27,091 --> 01:07:32,733
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Shin Hokuro Musou comes out this week.

979
01:07:33,033 --> 01:07:34,094
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm trying to see what this is.

980
01:07:34,154 --> 01:07:36,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this Fist of the North Star for fuck's sake?

981
01:07:36,115 --> 01:07:37,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, pull up the thing.

982
01:07:37,955 --> 01:07:38,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

983
01:07:39,216 --> 01:07:40,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's Fist of the North Star, Ken's Rage 2.

984
01:07:41,617 --> 01:07:42,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good lord.

985
01:07:44,895 --> 01:07:46,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Can always count on another Fist of the North Star game.

986
01:07:46,636 --> 01:07:49,379
[SPEAKER_05]: God, how long has Fist of the North Star been out, like, since 1979?

987
01:07:49,779 --> 01:07:50,620
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm serious.

988
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:52,601
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know.

989
01:07:52,621 --> 01:07:55,163
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's been out that, like, Hokuto no Ken's been out that long.

990
01:07:55,183 --> 01:07:58,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's coming out on Xbox 360 in two weeks.

991
01:07:59,287 --> 01:08:02,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember Punch Mania, the Hokuto no Ken version of Punch Mania?

992
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:03,450
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.

993
01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:04,191
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great.

994
01:08:04,231 --> 01:08:04,911
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.

995
01:08:05,252 --> 01:08:10,816
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's funny to me that, like, you know, that's all the Wii U's got on it is a franchise from 1979.

996
01:08:13,218 --> 01:08:14,019
[SPEAKER_02]: coming out this week.

997
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:17,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, but look, those games are still popular in all seriousness.

998
01:08:17,304 --> 01:08:18,986
[SPEAKER_02]: I want one of those at my house.

999
01:08:19,026 --> 01:08:19,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Mildly popular.

1000
01:08:19,807 --> 01:08:21,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go to UK.

1001
01:08:22,825 --> 01:08:26,268
[SPEAKER_05]: On the 29th, we have Let's Fish hooked on for the Vita.

1002
01:08:27,409 --> 01:08:34,474
[SPEAKER_05]: We have on the 30th, Skulls of the Shogun, which is coming out for Xbox 360, PC, and the Windows phone.

1003
01:08:34,494 --> 01:08:35,475
[SPEAKER_05]: I just thought that was interesting.

1004
01:08:35,995 --> 01:08:39,338
[SPEAKER_05]: On the 31st, Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed for PC.

1005
01:08:40,338 --> 01:08:40,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

1006
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:50,006
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on February 1st, we have Hitman HD Trilogy and Ni No Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch.

1007
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:51,467
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1008
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:58,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, just a few more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

1009
01:08:58,812 --> 01:09:00,133
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, Loki.

1010
01:09:00,734 --> 01:09:09,120
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, apparently the whole pay-to-win thing with EA is still continuing.

1011
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:15,825
[SPEAKER_10]: And now, Dead Space fans, fans of a very hardcore franchise, are so happy to find out that

1012
01:09:16,405 --> 01:09:17,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, guess what?

1013
01:09:17,166 --> 01:09:18,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Microtransactions are here.

1014
01:09:18,827 --> 01:09:19,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay!

1015
01:09:19,707 --> 01:09:21,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Free-to-play microtransactions.

1016
01:09:21,609 --> 01:09:26,072
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently they say the reason this is happening is because mobile gamers.

1017
01:09:26,592 --> 01:09:27,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Mobile gamers, yes.

1018
01:09:27,773 --> 01:09:32,697
[SPEAKER_10]: There are a lot of players out there, especially players coming from mobile games who are accustomed to microtransactions.

1019
01:09:33,417 --> 01:09:37,259
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like, I need this now and I want this now.

1020
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:40,660
[SPEAKER_10]: And they'll need instant gratification.

1021
01:09:40,701 --> 01:09:43,462
[SPEAKER_10]: So we included an option in order to attract those players.

1022
01:09:43,882 --> 01:09:52,586
[SPEAKER_10]: So if they're like, oh, I need 5,000 Tugston because I'm short on this upgrade, they can have it.

1023
01:09:53,186 --> 01:09:56,008
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to make sure that we're expanding our audience as well.

1024
01:09:56,388 --> 01:10:02,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, so that's the way you expand your audience is you have microtransactions in your fucking game because mobile...

1025
01:10:03,348 --> 01:10:05,190
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't expand your audience because think about it.

1026
01:10:06,231 --> 01:10:08,633
[SPEAKER_10]: People aren't going to buy this game because they have microtransactions in it.

1027
01:10:08,693 --> 01:10:16,021
[SPEAKER_10]: All you're doing is saying, hey, people that are used to paying microtransactions for stuff may buy this microtransaction stuff in our game.

1028
01:10:18,533 --> 01:10:21,034
[SPEAKER_02]: That is some dumbass logic this guy is using.

1029
01:10:21,114 --> 01:10:22,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1030
01:10:22,195 --> 01:10:27,877
[SPEAKER_02]: The games industry is in trouble if that's the way that people making decisions are really thinking.

1031
01:10:28,797 --> 01:10:33,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Just say, we're putting it in the game because people are dumb enough to buy it.

1032
01:10:33,419 --> 01:10:34,319
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the reality.

1033
01:10:34,959 --> 01:10:36,160
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make free money.

1034
01:10:37,861 --> 01:10:40,462
[SPEAKER_02]: We think because of mobile games, people are dumb enough to buy it.

1035
01:10:40,922 --> 01:10:43,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Mobile games coming over to console?

1036
01:10:44,624 --> 01:10:46,465
[SPEAKER_02]: What fuck backwards logic is that?

1037
01:10:46,906 --> 01:10:49,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody is saying it's supposedly going the other way.

1038
01:10:50,328 --> 01:10:52,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's going to mobile.

1039
01:10:52,849 --> 01:10:57,492
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not suddenly going to come over to console because you're designing the game so that they can spend more money.

1040
01:10:58,132 --> 01:11:02,913
[SPEAKER_10]: I guarantee that there is nobody on the face of the planet that says, hey, you know what?

1041
01:11:03,513 --> 01:11:06,214
[SPEAKER_10]: I like this game because there's microtransactions in it.

1042
01:11:06,254 --> 01:11:08,814
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what else mobile games have going for them?

1043
01:11:08,954 --> 01:11:10,395
[SPEAKER_02]: They're 99 cents.

1044
01:11:12,335 --> 01:11:14,715
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a huge difference.

1045
01:11:15,075 --> 01:11:17,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you middle managers understand this?

1046
01:11:18,516 --> 01:11:18,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Volume.

1047
01:11:19,696 --> 01:11:20,977
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where you make your money, volume.

1048
01:11:21,057 --> 01:11:22,417
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are dumb enough to buy it.

1049
01:11:23,797 --> 01:11:26,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if one person buys it, it's three bucks they didn't have before.

1050
01:11:28,055 --> 01:11:30,097
[SPEAKER_02]: and you see EA doing this in a lot of their games.

1051
01:11:30,598 --> 01:11:31,699
[SPEAKER_10]: They were the first to do it.

1052
01:11:31,719 --> 01:11:34,942
[SPEAKER_10]: They used to put out, they had cheats in their games and then guess what?

1053
01:11:35,163 --> 01:11:36,704
[SPEAKER_10]: They stopped having cheats in their games.

1054
01:11:36,764 --> 01:11:38,646
[SPEAKER_10]: The Godfather game had cheats in it.

1055
01:11:39,147 --> 01:11:40,348
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, but guess what?

1056
01:11:40,749 --> 01:11:44,633
[SPEAKER_10]: When you buy it on the Xbox 360, you're actually going to have to buy those cheats in-game.

1057
01:11:45,473 --> 01:12:04,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby on his show tonight when we were on the phone call at the end was talking about SimCity and how he was playing the beta and was saying how he didn't have enough simoleons or whatever to do some of the things he wanted to do I said, oh I bet you could probably log into the EA store when the game comes out and get 100,000 simoleons for $2.99 and you're right, that's the type of thing that you used to type a cheat code in to get and unlock

1058
01:12:05,742 --> 01:12:07,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, because here's the thing.

1059
01:12:07,443 --> 01:12:08,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Why wouldn't they do this?

1060
01:12:08,984 --> 01:12:16,989
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if you think about it, if you're making a game, why wouldn't you give the opportunity or miss out on the opportunity to make a little bit more money?

1061
01:12:17,129 --> 01:12:21,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Which also is the real reason that game is all online DRM.

1062
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:22,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't fucking kid yourself.

1063
01:12:23,413 --> 01:12:26,675
[SPEAKER_02]: All this stuff about, you know, the interaction with other people.

1064
01:12:26,695 --> 01:12:27,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-uh.

1065
01:12:27,455 --> 01:12:27,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-uh.

1066
01:12:28,096 --> 01:12:29,277
[SPEAKER_02]: It's to sell you this shit.

1067
01:12:29,637 --> 01:12:34,160
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way the cheat codes can't happen offline.

1068
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:34,540
[SPEAKER_02]: But wait.

1069
01:12:35,182 --> 01:12:36,311
[SPEAKER_02]: they will, hackers will get it

1070
01:12:37,993 --> 01:12:41,555
[SPEAKER_02]: And sadly, that's the only way these guys are going to learn their lesson.

1071
01:12:41,615 --> 01:12:45,377
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, oh, but the hackers are so mean to us.

1072
01:12:45,737 --> 01:12:49,919
[SPEAKER_06]: We lost all this money on the game and it was the hackers' fault.

1073
01:12:49,959 --> 01:12:51,200
[SPEAKER_10]: The hackers did it, Loki.

1074
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:58,984
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure that so many people out there pirated The Sims 3 because that's why they released so many fucking expansions to this game.

1075
01:12:59,444 --> 01:13:04,707
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if it wasn't doing well, they wouldn't release 90,000 expansions for The Sims 3.

1076
01:13:06,558 --> 01:13:33,708
[SPEAKER_10]: you saw how many came out for Sims 2 back in the day I never paid for one but I'm telling you though that they're making people buy this and they're not just like you know for 70s 80s and 90s stuff that just came out it's like 20 bucks and you get crap for your house $20 for not even a really a huge game expansion $40 for a really big expansion like going to a you know university life that's coming out in March and

1077
01:13:34,848 --> 01:13:38,370
[SPEAKER_10]: They literally have one or two expansions a month coming out for this stuff.

1078
01:13:39,191 --> 01:13:40,312
[SPEAKER_10]: It's ridiculous.

1079
01:13:40,572 --> 01:13:41,712
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know why they're doing it?

1080
01:13:41,913 --> 01:13:44,234
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because people are buying them.

1081
01:13:44,454 --> 01:13:46,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, you're a company looking to make money.

1082
01:13:46,595 --> 01:13:47,876
[SPEAKER_10]: You're looking to stay alive.

1083
01:13:48,216 --> 01:13:48,857
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you going to do?

1084
01:13:49,197 --> 01:13:53,399
[SPEAKER_10]: If people are buying DLC stuff, you're going to put it in your game.

1085
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:56,501
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to have these microtransactions in there because people buy them.

1086
01:13:57,402 --> 01:13:59,363
[SPEAKER_10]: People may bitch about them online, but you know what?

1087
01:13:59,383 --> 01:14:00,704
[SPEAKER_10]: At the end of the day, people are buying them.

1088
01:14:00,844 --> 01:14:02,485
[SPEAKER_10]: If they weren't buying them, they wouldn't put it in the game.

1089
01:14:06,621 --> 01:14:06,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Atari Inc.

1090
01:14:07,402 --> 01:14:09,765
[SPEAKER_02]: filed for Chapter 11 restructuring bankruptcy this week.

1091
01:14:25,983 --> 01:14:33,088
[SPEAKER_02]: and it is trying to basically separate itself from Atari SA, which is the French parent company and be its own independent business.

1092
01:14:33,488 --> 01:14:36,991
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, you know, that's not how they really reported on CNN.

1093
01:14:37,011 --> 01:14:39,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody else says, Atari went bankrupt this week.

1094
01:14:39,412 --> 01:14:40,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember Pong?

1095
01:14:40,253 --> 01:14:42,494
[SPEAKER_02]: People are dumb.

1096
01:14:42,614 --> 01:14:43,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Atari's bankrupt.

1097
01:14:43,695 --> 01:14:45,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna miss Pong.

1098
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Combat.

1099
01:14:50,157 --> 01:14:51,838
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, let's be real, guys.

1100
01:14:51,898 --> 01:14:55,841
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of that Atari that we know went away with a game crash in 84.

1101
01:14:56,322 --> 01:14:59,024
[SPEAKER_02]: What did Atari recently have going for it?

1102
01:14:59,404 --> 01:15:07,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Alone in the Dark, Test Drive Unlimited, Retro Arcade releases.

1103
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:09,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let me rephrase.

1104
01:15:09,572 --> 01:15:12,014
[SPEAKER_02]: What did Atari have going for it that THQ didn't?

1105
01:15:14,039 --> 01:15:42,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Alone in the Dark but I'm you're missing my point a lot of this is kind of happening to a lot of these guys you know is that it's not enough they had Dragon Ball Z for a while they also had what oh god I will forever associate this with with modern Atari was the Driver 3 on PlayStation that buggy as hell game wasn't that them

1106
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:44,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Driver 3 was fantastic.

1107
01:15:44,111 --> 01:15:45,352
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a pinnacle of buggy-ass games.

1108
01:16:03,453 --> 01:16:04,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, where was it?

1109
01:16:04,633 --> 01:16:12,355
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Atari, then it was GT Interactive, and then GT Interactive became Infogrames, and that's when the French side of it came in.

1110
01:16:12,755 --> 01:16:21,457
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Infogrames bought Hasbro Interactive, which acquired Atari, and then Infogrames changed their name to Atari, and they used the Atari name in the logo.

1111
01:16:22,637 --> 01:16:27,498
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, Atari, as it is now, wasn't even the same company as it was before anyway.

1112
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:32,679
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably just going to evolve again, and maybe they'll find their next big thing.

1113
01:16:32,739 --> 01:16:33,099
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1114
01:16:35,635 --> 01:16:41,580
[SPEAKER_05]: To register for participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on VOGnetwork.com, use the passphrase straw.

1115
01:16:42,301 --> 01:16:51,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's go back to a more classic time when Atari was like, you know, that was like Nintendo or Sony or what it was, Atari.

1116
01:16:52,329 --> 01:16:53,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, this game may not be that old.

1117
01:16:53,931 --> 01:16:54,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe it is.

1118
01:16:54,491 --> 01:16:56,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I think you did pick a game that old this week.

1119
01:16:56,453 --> 01:16:56,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Close.

1120
01:16:56,953 --> 01:16:57,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Really close.

1121
01:16:57,674 --> 01:16:59,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty, pretty decently old.

1122
01:16:59,338 --> 01:16:59,598
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1123
01:17:13,226 --> 01:17:18,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's not as old as Hokuto no Ken, which, thanks for, I forget who said it, came out in 83.

1124
01:17:18,892 --> 01:17:23,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Rygar is the game of the week.

1125
01:17:23,116 --> 01:17:28,662
[SPEAKER_05]: It came out by Tecmo in 1986, and it was an arcade game called Argus no Senshi.

1126
01:17:30,463 --> 01:17:36,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Which means, I mean, you pretty much play as the legendary warrior, and you're getting a...

1127
01:17:37,330 --> 01:17:45,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Attacked on all sides, and you use this disc armor weapon that's basically a shield with a long chain attached to it.

1128
01:17:46,735 --> 01:17:54,879
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically, I always think that it's kind of like they're...

1129
01:17:57,216 --> 01:17:58,738
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the word I'm trying to think of?

1130
01:17:58,798 --> 01:18:01,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Their derivative of Rastan.

1131
01:18:02,081 --> 01:18:03,503
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same type of platforming game.

1132
01:18:05,685 --> 01:18:11,832
[SPEAKER_05]: But it came out basically you play as a guy named...

1133
01:18:13,333 --> 01:18:17,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Rhaegar, who is a dead warrior who rose from his grave.

1134
01:18:18,336 --> 01:18:25,681
[SPEAKER_05]: To use the disc armor and other weapons to try to stop this guy named Rhaegar, who took over the land of Argon.

1135
01:18:25,981 --> 01:18:33,846
[SPEAKER_05]: You just go through and you basically shoot people and you shoot animals.

1136
01:18:34,466 --> 01:18:38,728
[SPEAKER_05]: and you shoot spiders and you shoot dragons and you shoot midgets.

1137
01:18:39,189 --> 01:18:44,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I want to say real quick, and you'll probably get into this in a minute, but a lot of people in chat are like, oh, I remember this game on the NES.

1138
01:18:45,132 --> 01:18:49,214
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're actually talking about the arcade version of Rygar, which was very, very different.

1139
01:18:49,234 --> 01:18:49,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I am.

1140
01:18:50,294 --> 01:18:53,456
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know if you'll get into the NES one at all and why it was different.

1141
01:18:53,636 --> 01:18:54,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold your horses!

1142
01:18:54,536 --> 01:18:55,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep your pants on!

1143
01:18:56,337 --> 01:18:57,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted our chatters to pay attention.

1144
01:18:58,098 --> 01:18:58,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't run away yet.

1145
01:18:59,059 --> 01:18:59,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Meh.

1146
01:19:00,894 --> 01:19:10,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at any rate, as I was getting to, the game has been ported to the Sharp X68000, the Commodore 64, the Sega Master System, but that was only in Japan.

1147
01:19:10,961 --> 01:19:13,643
[SPEAKER_05]: It was called Argus no Jujiken.

1148
01:19:14,543 --> 01:19:20,727
[SPEAKER_05]: It came out for the ZX Spectrum 48K, the Amstrad 6128, and the Atari Lynx.

1149
01:19:21,568 --> 01:19:29,373
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on the Xbox, it was included in a compilation that was the Tecmo Classic Arcade, and now there is a Wii Virtual Console version as well.

1150
01:19:29,693 --> 01:19:30,654
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the arcade version.

1151
01:19:31,314 --> 01:19:36,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the Atari Lynx is probably the closest to the arcade version.

1152
01:19:36,759 --> 01:19:37,399
[SPEAKER_03]: That's weird.

1153
01:19:41,654 --> 01:19:44,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, however, it did have some different rounds.

1154
01:19:44,798 --> 01:19:48,262
[SPEAKER_05]: There were only 23 rounds, but it was supposed to be pretty close to the arcade version.

1155
01:19:48,882 --> 01:19:49,904
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I actually have it.

1156
01:19:49,924 --> 01:19:54,509
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't think of Atari Lynx as, like, the arcade-accurate system ever, you know?

1157
01:19:55,109 --> 01:19:55,910
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd be surprised.

1158
01:19:56,010 --> 01:19:58,433
[SPEAKER_02]: The one on Xbox was, I actually have that collection you're talking about.

1159
01:19:58,453 --> 01:20:00,756
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not bad, but it's also not 360 backwards compatible.

1160
01:20:01,356 --> 01:20:01,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Sucks.

1161
01:20:02,097 --> 01:20:02,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1162
01:20:03,891 --> 01:20:06,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Hachamecha Daishengeki Platform Action RPG

1163
01:20:25,050 --> 01:20:27,012
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was quite a bit different.

1164
01:20:28,373 --> 01:20:37,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, you go through different settings to try to kill the evil King Ligar, Blah, who is on the planet of Argol, which was Argus in Japan.

1165
01:20:38,663 --> 01:20:48,011
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have to visit the five gods who give you different items, and you go through different realms, and they all have a boss, and all this fun stuff.

1166
01:20:49,201 --> 01:20:51,203
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's a little bit different.

1167
01:20:51,763 --> 01:21:09,379
[SPEAKER_05]: With the difference in the versions, the arcade version is more side-scrolling, the NES one is an open-ended action-adventure game, sort of Metroidvania-like, and at the start of the game you have access to some of the worlds and then you get the other worlds opened up as you go.

1168
01:21:11,221 --> 01:21:14,924
[SPEAKER_05]: You also had permanent power-ups in the NES version.

1169
01:21:15,965 --> 01:21:17,786
[SPEAKER_05]: and different experience points you could use.

1170
01:21:18,726 --> 01:21:33,031
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a new, I guess kind of like a sequel that came out, Rygar the Legendary Adventure that came out on PS2 and it was a transition to 3D style gameplay and it was pretty much rated okay.

1171
01:21:33,851 --> 01:21:37,192
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is a Wii port that came out in 2007.

1172
01:21:37,873 --> 01:21:39,193
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go, Rygar.

1173
01:21:39,973 --> 01:21:41,494
[SPEAKER_05]: The arcade version is the best one.

1174
01:21:43,410 --> 01:21:44,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the NES one.

1175
01:21:44,251 --> 01:21:45,673
[SPEAKER_02]: The NES one had a great soundtrack.

1176
01:21:45,693 --> 01:21:47,236
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I really liked about it.

1177
01:21:47,296 --> 01:21:48,618
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're so different.

1178
01:21:48,658 --> 01:21:51,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they really should just be considered two separate games.

1179
01:21:51,902 --> 01:21:53,725
[SPEAKER_02]: The arcade one is so different from the NES one.

1180
01:21:53,765 --> 01:21:56,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, look at Strider in the arcade and on the Genesis.

1181
01:21:57,070 --> 01:21:57,971
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the NES one.

1182
01:21:58,051 --> 01:21:59,814
[SPEAKER_05]: The NES one was actually based off the Strider manga.

1183
01:22:00,014 --> 01:22:05,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah, that is a very good comparison, is that the Rygar games are that different, like the Strider games are.

1184
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,201
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very good comparison.

1185
01:22:07,621 --> 01:22:15,229
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I love the NES Strider, but I know you think it's shit, because you have the Genesis... No, I didn't say I think it's shit, it's just a different game.

1186
01:22:16,449 --> 01:22:17,910
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of like them both, myself.

1187
01:22:44,481 --> 01:22:45,502
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, how dare you?

1188
01:22:45,522 --> 01:22:46,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you understand?

1189
01:22:46,682 --> 01:22:49,464
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the foundation that all internet video game media is based on.

1190
01:22:49,504 --> 01:22:50,205
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't have a tie.

1191
01:22:50,225 --> 01:22:51,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I have a personality disorder.

1192
01:23:11,714 --> 01:23:12,615
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called honoree.

1193
01:23:14,197 --> 01:23:15,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to take a break.

1194
01:23:15,278 --> 01:23:21,303
[SPEAKER_02]: On that note, we're going to take a break and when we come back with Orange Launch Radio, we've got more, yet again, more on Disney Infinity tonight.

1195
01:23:21,343 --> 01:23:21,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeez, Loki.

1196
01:23:21,923 --> 01:23:24,025
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't stop with the Disney Infinity news.

1197
01:23:24,506 --> 01:23:26,528
[SPEAKER_02]: And Nintendo had an avalanche of news this week.

1198
01:23:26,628 --> 01:23:28,189
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk all about that and get into that.

1199
01:23:28,249 --> 01:23:36,677
[SPEAKER_02]: When we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio, your phone calls, your emails, and much more when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.

1200
01:23:43,208 --> 01:23:53,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this January the 27th, 2013, episode number 491 in progress.

1201
01:23:54,254 --> 01:23:58,177
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to start off this part of the show with some rapid fire news.

1202
01:23:58,677 --> 01:24:00,238
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're ready, Loki, take it away.

1203
01:24:00,718 --> 01:24:00,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

1204
01:24:01,819 --> 01:24:02,159
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1205
01:24:02,439 --> 01:24:06,041
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's talk a little bit about Disney Infinity.

1206
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:07,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, can't.

1207
01:24:07,922 --> 01:24:10,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Can't go another show without talking more Disney Infinity.

1208
01:24:10,983 --> 01:24:14,524
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to actually put out lots of content, which is kind of a duh.

1209
01:24:16,085 --> 01:24:24,687
[SPEAKER_10]: I've actually heard some people saying, hey, we might not actually see any more standalone games from Disney Interactive now that they have this Disney Infinity thing.

1210
01:24:24,707 --> 01:24:27,568
[SPEAKER_10]: And that kind of seems somewhat true.

1211
01:24:27,668 --> 01:24:31,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't they close a lot of that?

1212
01:24:32,441 --> 01:24:33,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they did.

1213
01:24:33,342 --> 01:24:41,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the whole, like, there was not jokes, but commentary going around about how there won't be another split second or what that racing game and, you know.

1214
01:24:41,828 --> 01:24:44,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, because BlackRock's, I think, close.

1215
01:24:44,090 --> 01:24:45,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah.

1216
01:24:45,310 --> 01:24:47,592
[SPEAKER_10]: So, that's too bad.

1217
01:24:48,773 --> 01:24:50,814
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, they've got quite a bit coming out.

1218
01:24:50,835 --> 01:24:52,856
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, some of which I'm about to tell you about.

1219
01:24:53,136 --> 01:24:55,998
[SPEAKER_10]: And this isn't exactly all out there yet.

1220
01:24:57,299 --> 01:24:58,200
[SPEAKER_10]: So, let's see here.

1221
01:24:58,280 --> 01:24:58,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's talk...

1222
01:24:59,881 --> 01:25:02,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Disney Infinity Sully from Monsters Inc.

1223
01:25:02,163 --> 01:25:02,643
[SPEAKER_10]: and Monsters U

1224
01:25:23,659 --> 01:25:45,845
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, of course, to go with that, they've got a bunch of other side characters, including in the Incredibles universe, Dash, Mrs. Incredible, Violet in Syndrome, Monsters U, they've got Mike and Randall, Pirates of the Caribbean, Captain Barboza, and Davy Jones.

1225
01:25:46,565 --> 01:25:48,706
[SPEAKER_10]: They're also going to be doing some additional play sets.

1226
01:25:48,946 --> 01:25:55,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Zoro and Cars are going to be the first two play sets that are launched alongside this as well.

1227
01:25:55,528 --> 01:26:01,731
[SPEAKER_10]: And with Zoro, you're going to get Zoro and Tonto, and then Cars, Lightning McQueen, and I can't remember who else.

1228
01:26:02,411 --> 01:26:02,671
[SPEAKER_10]: I think...

1229
01:26:03,631 --> 01:26:05,392
[SPEAKER_10]: Might be Flo, yeah.

1230
01:26:06,772 --> 01:26:10,614
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, of course, they're going to have some triple packs in case you want to get a few characters at a time.

1231
01:26:10,654 --> 01:26:12,615
[SPEAKER_10]: Sidekicks and villains are going to be the two themes of those.

1232
01:26:14,755 --> 01:26:17,597
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I know one of the questions was, hey, when are we going to see Mickey Mouse?

1233
01:26:18,897 --> 01:26:45,955
[SPEAKER_10]: and you're not going to wait that long September is when you're going to see Mickey Mouse as a standalone character I'm not sure the garb that they had the picture of was Sorcerer's Apprentice so I'm not sure if it's going to be Sorcerer's Apprentice Mickey or if it may even be its own adventure set by then we'll see I think Phineas and Ferb is somewhere during the summer and then fall you're going to get Frozen the playset for that and Wreck-It Ralph sadly we have to wait so long for Wreck-It Ralph Phineas and Ferb needs to be now

1234
01:26:47,445 --> 01:26:51,227
[SPEAKER_10]: but those are all going to be available soon.

1235
01:26:51,367 --> 01:26:57,690
[SPEAKER_02]: That is weird that Wreck-It Ralph isn't towards the start because I would have thought that the Blu-ray would be out around April-ish.

1236
01:26:57,710 --> 01:27:01,511
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just trying to probably space it out because you've got two play sets coming out.

1237
01:27:01,531 --> 01:27:06,893
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got the stuff that ties in with Monsters University and Zorro and then Cars.

1238
01:27:06,913 --> 01:27:08,234
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be a little much.

1239
01:27:08,354 --> 01:27:10,255
[SPEAKER_10]: I was hoping during the summer...

1240
01:27:10,555 --> 01:27:11,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait for Disney Infinity Giants.

1241
01:27:40,307 --> 01:27:44,301
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think they're going to come out with anything like Skyliner's Giants because they don't really need to.

1242
01:27:44,321 --> 01:27:44,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Fool.

1243
01:27:50,202 --> 01:27:53,504
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't need to do it for Skylanders either if you really think about it.

1244
01:27:53,524 --> 01:27:56,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they do because it has to expand the games.

1245
01:27:57,086 --> 01:27:59,267
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't need a little Big Planet 2, Loki.

1246
01:27:59,828 --> 01:28:00,928
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll find a way.

1247
01:28:01,249 --> 01:28:01,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

1248
01:28:02,729 --> 01:28:03,590
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll find a way.

1249
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:04,310
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1250
01:28:05,231 --> 01:28:06,772
[SPEAKER_02]: All the content's on the disc anyway.

1251
01:28:07,612 --> 01:28:12,235
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have to have a new edition in another year for the rest of the content.

1252
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:13,320
[SPEAKER_10]: True.

1253
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:19,643
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're going to find out about all the characters anyways for Disney Infinity because the content for this entire year is actually on the disc.

1254
01:28:20,744 --> 01:28:24,585
[SPEAKER_02]: That is interesting too because you know people are going to hack the shit out of this game the minute it's out.

1255
01:28:24,785 --> 01:28:32,269
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything they're trying to keep under wraps with Frozen, be ready for that to hit the internet the minute this game leaks.

1256
01:28:32,529 --> 01:28:36,472
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be a little harder, though, because you need RFID stuff to do that.

1257
01:28:36,492 --> 01:28:41,855
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know what they've done with Skylanders as far as rewriting RFID tags.

1258
01:28:41,875 --> 01:28:43,816
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure that's possible.

1259
01:28:44,036 --> 01:28:45,597
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not really sure how they would do it.

1260
01:28:45,717 --> 01:28:49,860
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be a little bit more complicated than just unlocking everything.

1261
01:28:50,407 --> 01:28:51,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Hacker's going to hack.

1262
01:28:51,608 --> 01:28:54,932
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure that they are, but I'm just saying it's a little bit more complicated.

1263
01:28:55,632 --> 01:28:56,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Not everybody's going to be doing it.

1264
01:28:57,955 --> 01:29:01,038
[SPEAKER_10]: The Ouya is getting a controller redesign.

1265
01:29:01,058 --> 01:29:02,319
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually think it looks kind of cool.

1266
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:04,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people are saying the D-pad sucks.

1267
01:29:05,282 --> 01:29:12,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, the grips on the analog sticks were not rubberized enough, so they kind of changed it and added a little rubberized top to it.

1268
01:29:13,170 --> 01:29:21,412
[SPEAKER_10]: They also, I guess, are adjusting the touchpad sensitivity and moving the triggers closer to the body.

1269
01:29:21,792 --> 01:29:27,693
[SPEAKER_10]: And the D-pad is now, instead of the circular D-pad, it's a cross-shaped D-pad.

1270
01:29:27,753 --> 01:29:30,174
[SPEAKER_10]: And people are seeing the pictures and they're like, oh, it's terrible.

1271
01:29:30,194 --> 01:29:32,754
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like the Xbox 360 controller.

1272
01:29:32,934 --> 01:29:35,455
[SPEAKER_10]: However, you're not looking at it close enough because actually the...

1273
01:29:36,395 --> 01:29:42,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, circle part on there, the corners, you know, the little pie shaped stuff are actually attached to the controller.

1274
01:29:42,917 --> 01:29:45,998
[SPEAKER_10]: The D-pad itself is the only thing that rocks in there.

1275
01:29:46,618 --> 01:29:55,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so it actually is a true D-pad and not like the Xbox 360 controller, which is kind of a, you know, D-pad on top of a circle and the whole thing rocks.

1276
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:57,861
[SPEAKER_10]: So, be interesting to see.

1277
01:29:57,941 --> 01:29:59,763
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still looking forward to my system in a couple months.

1278
01:29:59,843 --> 01:30:01,123
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, that'll be cool.

1279
01:30:01,684 --> 01:30:03,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Bring it in.

1280
01:30:04,586 --> 01:30:09,689
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, of course, the... I don't know if it's a sign of desperation, but...

1281
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:12,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, get your friends to buy a Vita.

1282
01:30:13,062 --> 01:30:14,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we need people to buy a Vita.

1283
01:30:14,743 --> 01:30:22,164
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you do, you get $20 in PlayStation Network credit and 1,000 Sony Rewards points.

1284
01:30:23,004 --> 01:30:28,605
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really know what 1,000 Rewards points buys you, but cool, I guess.

1285
01:30:28,985 --> 01:30:30,865
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, some sort of referral program.

1286
01:30:31,245 --> 01:30:36,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of along the lines of that, actually, I'm thinking of selling my Vita because I'm just not playing anything on it.

1287
01:30:37,046 --> 01:30:37,447
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1288
01:30:37,467 --> 01:30:38,107
[SPEAKER_05]: You may have a buyer.

1289
01:30:38,707 --> 01:30:39,487
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know.

1290
01:30:39,807 --> 01:30:40,207
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

1291
01:30:40,905 --> 01:30:42,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Still waiting for a Grand Theft Auto game?

1292
01:30:42,631 --> 01:30:43,273
Stop waiting.

1293
01:30:43,955 --> 01:30:44,557
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not coming.

1294
01:30:46,934 --> 01:30:51,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of Grand Theft Auto, second half of May, from what I hear, is supposed to be coming out.

1295
01:30:52,815 --> 01:30:53,536
[SPEAKER_10]: That makes sense.

1296
01:30:53,956 --> 01:30:56,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Right in time for school to be out, so all the kids can go home and play.

1297
01:30:56,076 --> 01:30:56,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, because we were bothering them.

1298
01:30:57,016 --> 01:31:00,637
[SPEAKER_10]: We were on a conference call at Take-Two, and they were, hey, so what's it coming out?

1299
01:31:00,897 --> 01:31:01,998
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're all, second half of May.

1300
01:31:02,738 --> 01:31:05,978
[SPEAKER_10]: At least that's where it's targeted right now.

1301
01:31:07,159 --> 01:31:12,260
[SPEAKER_10]: They're looking at a new build of it next week, and assuming that everything's up to snuff, it'll be the second half.

1302
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:15,681
[SPEAKER_10]: At the end of February, they're going to be announcing collector's editions.

1303
01:31:16,322 --> 01:31:20,483
[SPEAKER_10]: One for $79.99, one for $134.99 to $149.99.

1304
01:31:20,683 --> 01:31:23,144
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't know what's in there yet.

1305
01:31:23,565 --> 01:31:24,485
[SPEAKER_10]: But you didn't hear that here.

1306
01:31:24,585 --> 01:31:28,987
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, it doesn't take a rock of scientists to guess, oh, they'll probably be collector's editions.

1307
01:31:29,047 --> 01:31:29,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.

1308
01:31:30,047 --> 01:31:31,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Long-awaited games always have collector's editions.

1309
01:31:31,868 --> 01:31:32,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

1310
01:31:32,248 --> 01:31:33,489
[SPEAKER_02]: The time frame makes sense.

1311
01:31:34,009 --> 01:31:36,530
[SPEAKER_02]: None of this is unreasonable news.

1312
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:37,290
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still begging.

1313
01:31:37,550 --> 01:31:38,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Still begging.

1314
01:31:39,711 --> 01:31:43,713
[SPEAKER_10]: My boss will take me, but Destination PlayStation, I'm going to have a playable build of it.

1315
01:31:44,514 --> 01:31:45,834
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to play that game!

1316
01:31:46,575 --> 01:31:47,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course you do.

1317
01:31:47,115 --> 01:31:50,997
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, listen, you asshole, you're going to bring me to... You're bringing me down there.

1318
01:31:51,357 --> 01:31:52,198
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll win you, fans.

1319
01:31:52,618 --> 01:31:57,861
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, going to a game that Loki's not playing, but if he had a Wii U, he might be playing this.

1320
01:31:58,341 --> 01:32:07,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Zombie U. So news this week, the Zombie U originally had intended to have a co-op mode, but it was shelved pretty early into development, which kind of makes sense.

1321
01:32:08,727 --> 01:32:14,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Producer of the game said that we thought we could not deliver it on time.

1322
01:32:15,453 --> 01:32:20,098
[SPEAKER_02]: How to bring a cooperative experience and still keep fear and tension is a question we would love to address, though.

1323
01:32:20,979 --> 01:32:25,324
[SPEAKER_02]: So, probably in Zombie U2, which I think is inevitable at this point, but we'll see.

1324
01:32:26,785 --> 01:32:29,408
[SPEAKER_02]: I always wanted to see that band as a zombie.

1325
01:32:31,827 --> 01:32:35,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

1326
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:42,214
[SPEAKER_02]: 300,000 survivors apparently have died so far in ZombiU, according to the servers at Ubisoft.

1327
01:32:44,735 --> 01:32:45,176
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1328
01:32:45,616 --> 01:32:47,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they're no longer survivors now, aren't they?

1329
01:32:48,143 --> 01:33:04,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on to some interesting news about the Wii U. Apparently, your Wii Shop purchases will not earn you Club Nintendo coins on Wii U. In other words, these two stores are very separate.

1330
01:33:05,850 --> 01:33:14,494
[SPEAKER_02]: If you transfer your Wii content to the Wii U and you buy WiiWare Virtual Console games on the Wii U's Wii Mode, you don't get Wii U coins out of that.

1331
01:33:15,174 --> 01:33:20,017
[SPEAKER_02]: because, face it, Nintendos, Wii, and Wii U modes don't know how to talk to each other.

1332
01:33:20,377 --> 01:33:34,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you and I were chatting before the show about this, and I don't remember which one of us said it, but we were joking about this whole $1.50 upgrade is probably going to be something, you know, like if you want to get an upgrade to your game and play it on the Wii U. Yeah, exactly.

1333
01:33:34,485 --> 01:33:34,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1334
01:33:57,834 --> 01:34:00,755
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were joking about that they'll probably be in the Wii mode.

1335
01:34:00,795 --> 01:34:05,717
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be the Wii U Virtual Console upgrade channel that will actually transfer it.

1336
01:34:06,438 --> 01:34:14,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I was saying you'll probably have to buy the upgrade in the Wii Virtual Console because Nintendo doesn't know how to get the two things to talk to each other.

1337
01:34:14,781 --> 01:34:15,841
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know online.

1338
01:34:16,582 --> 01:34:20,864
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not so much that the Wii can't talk to the Wii U part of the device, but it's the online part.

1339
01:34:21,124 --> 01:34:25,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Nintendo can't figure out how to hook up your Wii and Wii U accounts.

1340
01:34:25,726 --> 01:34:26,366
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't do it.

1341
01:34:27,426 --> 01:34:28,787
[SPEAKER_02]: This proves they can't do it.

1342
01:34:30,349 --> 01:34:30,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1343
01:34:32,110 --> 01:34:36,714
[SPEAKER_10]: And I made the joke that, you know, when you're doing the upgrade, you know how they have the little loading screen stuff?

1344
01:34:36,734 --> 01:34:39,836
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be a little Pikmin running into your wallet and snatching a dollar out.

1345
01:34:41,017 --> 01:34:41,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of funny.

1346
01:34:41,938 --> 01:34:43,759
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I said, stop being funny when we're not on air.

1347
01:34:44,099 --> 01:34:44,339
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

1348
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:45,880
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1349
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:46,981
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't make the point to do that.

1350
01:34:47,281 --> 01:34:47,621
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1351
01:34:48,042 --> 01:34:51,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is a game that's available on virtual console on the 3DS, I know.

1352
01:34:51,744 --> 01:34:52,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Xevious.

1353
01:34:52,865 --> 01:35:06,514
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a 30th anniversary tribute album paying homage to the original soundtrack of the shooter and lots of different game composers that are contributing to this soundtrack.

1354
01:35:06,574 --> 01:35:11,057
[SPEAKER_02]: It is going to be out January 29th on iTunes through Namco Sounds.

1355
01:35:11,617 --> 01:35:12,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

1356
01:35:12,138 --> 01:35:14,539
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some previews up on YouTube if you want to check that out.

1357
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:17,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize that game was turning 30 years old.

1358
01:35:17,842 --> 01:35:18,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeesh.

1359
01:35:18,442 --> 01:35:19,142
[SPEAKER_05]: How does it feel to be old?

1360
01:35:20,864 --> 01:35:21,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Old.

1361
01:35:22,925 --> 01:35:24,066
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

1362
01:35:24,744 --> 01:35:25,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I got some stuff.

1363
01:35:27,166 --> 01:35:29,907
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, this is sad news.

1364
01:35:29,967 --> 01:35:34,970
[SPEAKER_05]: The composer for Heavy Rain, Norman Corbell, died at 56 years old.

1365
01:35:36,431 --> 01:35:43,095
[SPEAKER_05]: He was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer on August 15, 2012.

1366
01:35:43,295 --> 01:35:46,978
[SPEAKER_05]: This was posted on the 27th and he died at 2.56pm that day.

1367
01:35:47,018 --> 01:35:47,618
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's very sad news.

1368
01:35:54,013 --> 01:35:56,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1369
01:36:12,871 --> 01:36:14,131
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it is super funny.

1370
01:36:15,031 --> 01:36:25,354
[SPEAKER_05]: But this one was actually, the interesting thing about this is that the Minecraft guy, Marcus Person, actually donated $2,000 to this project.

1371
01:36:25,434 --> 01:36:28,974
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's got the approval of our Minecraft dude.

1372
01:36:29,434 --> 01:36:30,735
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's on Steam, so go get it.

1373
01:36:32,515 --> 01:36:38,916
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in other news, someone didn't link me the story.

1374
01:36:41,477 --> 01:36:41,817
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.

1375
01:36:42,486 --> 01:36:43,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I'm looking right at it.

1376
01:36:43,787 --> 01:36:44,907
[SPEAKER_05]: I found it, shush.

1377
01:36:46,688 --> 01:36:51,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Resident Evil 6 PC is going to come with some bonus stuff.

1378
01:36:51,190 --> 01:36:58,273
[SPEAKER_05]: It comes with the Mercenaries No Mercy mode, which is a time attack with waves of enemies.

1379
01:36:59,334 --> 01:37:01,835
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll see how well people do on that one.

1380
01:37:01,935 --> 01:37:09,379
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, I believe that after that you'll be able to buy the MIA Siege mode DLC.

1381
01:37:10,479 --> 01:37:11,680
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

1382
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:18,023
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be, well, at least in Europe, it's going to be €19.99 or €29.99.

1383
01:37:19,884 --> 01:37:22,365
[SPEAKER_05]: So who knows what will be here?

1384
01:37:22,825 --> 01:37:23,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Expensive.

1385
01:37:24,706 --> 01:37:25,106
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1386
01:37:25,566 --> 01:37:29,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to a part of the show we call the Fugle Question of the Week.

1387
01:37:30,328 --> 01:37:31,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a funny word.

1388
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:35,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what we did, we smashed the word Facebook and Google together and we got Fugle.

1389
01:37:36,566 --> 01:38:03,660
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the term is a portmanteau bless you alright Voogle question of the week going to the question we asked this week which is in a follow up to something we talked about earlier in the show with the whole Dead Space 3 and the fact that you will be able to buy some of these guns with real money because of mobile phone gamers are to blame for this

1390
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:14,074
[SPEAKER_02]: So we asked our Facebook and Google community members this week, have you ever bought a microtransaction in a console game of something you could have used in-game currency to unlock?

1391
01:38:14,194 --> 01:38:14,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Why or why not?

1392
01:38:15,578 --> 01:38:22,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think this sort of mobile, and I put that in quotes, design in games is a good thing or a bad thing?

1393
01:38:23,143 --> 01:38:24,204
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start with Google tonight.

1394
01:38:25,024 --> 01:38:30,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Critical Myth says, I've never knowingly done so, but sometimes it's hard to tell with costumes and weapons and so on.

1395
01:38:31,068 --> 01:38:33,730
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's single player, I don't think it matters one way or the other.

1396
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:38,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think it's BS when multiplayer items go for sale in that manner for obvious reasons.

1397
01:38:40,532 --> 01:38:41,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1398
01:38:57,143 --> 01:39:01,087
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't... I mean, because it's all co-op, it doesn't necessarily throw the game out of whack.

1399
01:39:01,567 --> 01:39:07,312
[SPEAKER_02]: But I kind of... I think the obvious reasons you state there are probably more in the head-to-head multiplayer games.

1400
01:39:07,852 --> 01:39:08,813
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my guess anyway.

1401
01:39:09,994 --> 01:39:10,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

1402
01:39:11,736 --> 01:39:12,316
[SPEAKER_02]: More answers.

1403
01:39:12,376 --> 01:39:13,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Entertainment on Google Plus says...

1404
01:39:15,458 --> 01:39:19,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I've paid real monies for games and items I could earn in-game.

1405
01:39:19,399 --> 01:39:22,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't do this because I'm used to doing so by prior experience.

1406
01:39:22,740 --> 01:39:25,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I did this because of the general philosophy I have towards things.

1407
01:39:25,841 --> 01:39:29,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want to expediently.

1408
01:39:31,262 --> 01:39:35,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Flaco Jones says, I've never paid for something that I could earn normally in a console game.

1409
01:39:35,443 --> 01:39:42,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, with guides and FAQs freely available on the internet to show you where every last item is hidden and how to get it, it seems like it would be a waste of money.

1410
01:39:44,778 --> 01:39:46,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to Facebook and some of the answers there.

1411
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:52,485
[SPEAKER_02]: James S. If they incorporate a way for you to obtain the items by collecting in-game currency, then whatever.

1412
01:39:52,826 --> 01:39:56,729
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just one of the many evolutions of the gaming industry in today's troublesome economy.

1413
01:39:57,130 --> 01:40:01,314
[SPEAKER_02]: We all must take the necessary steps in order to keep our heads above water.

1414
01:40:01,674 --> 01:40:05,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether or not that means pissing some people off in the process.

1415
01:40:05,457 --> 01:40:06,178
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a business.

1416
01:40:06,438 --> 01:40:06,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Deal with it.

1417
01:40:08,649 --> 01:40:10,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm, I don't know.

1418
01:40:12,194 --> 01:40:16,819
[SPEAKER_02]: I think folks will deal with it when they stop buying the games, but regardless.

1419
01:40:16,900 --> 01:40:22,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the mobile phone logic is you only paid 99 cents for the game in the first place, not 60.

1420
01:40:23,368 --> 01:40:25,410
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the big discrepancy here.

1421
01:40:25,691 --> 01:40:25,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1422
01:40:27,192 --> 01:40:27,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe Videa says,

1423
01:40:55,826 --> 01:41:05,447
[SPEAKER_02]: again though if the extra pretties are something that takes away from the core game then it doesn't matter don't want to spend the money on it then don't some people like to collect all the pretties though let them waste their money on what they want

1424
01:41:06,903 --> 01:41:10,066
[SPEAKER_02]: AKVG Games replies and says,

1425
01:41:28,341 --> 01:41:33,605
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more to that, but I can't read all of these answers, so please check out the full-length responses on Facebook.

1426
01:41:34,566 --> 01:41:41,691
[SPEAKER_02]: RedTheHaze replies and says, There was a console game I avoided because of the microtransactions, and that was Gotham City Imposters.

1427
01:41:42,112 --> 01:41:46,175
[SPEAKER_02]: The game was $15 and had the option to purchase upgrades which could be unlocked in the game.

1428
01:41:46,775 --> 01:41:50,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have no problem with it, but it took too much time to unlock the upgrades.

1429
01:41:50,738 --> 01:41:52,600
[SPEAKER_02]: It resulted with unbalanced gameplay...

1430
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:54,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Gossip City Impostors

1431
01:42:12,654 --> 01:42:13,534
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember if it did.

1432
01:42:13,734 --> 01:42:14,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I not call that?

1433
01:42:15,275 --> 01:42:16,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it did.

1434
01:42:16,375 --> 01:42:17,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be wrong.

1435
01:42:17,196 --> 01:42:17,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be wrong.

1436
01:42:17,676 --> 01:42:19,357
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying, I called it.

1437
01:42:19,377 --> 01:42:21,638
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 is still pretty cheap, but... Anyhow.

1438
01:42:22,158 --> 01:42:25,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Burr replies and says, Most microtransactions feel like paying for cheat codes.

1439
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:27,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the hell are we paying for cheat codes?

1440
01:42:28,281 --> 01:42:36,105
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like insult heaped upon injury considering that on today's consoles we can no longer cheat in our games because of achievements, trophies, etc.

1441
01:42:36,726 --> 01:42:40,147
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that comment really hits the nail on the head to what I think.

1442
01:42:40,227 --> 01:42:41,048
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were talking...

1443
01:42:41,548 --> 01:43:10,048
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier in the show about the whole like SimCity and how that's all changed I think this is right up the alley of why that all went down that way Degenerate Johnny said honestly I think it all depends on the player I personally have no partook in microtransactions in games with the exception of wow damn that sparkly horse however I do see that there's a growing market for them as games are becoming progressively longer and more frequent it makes life harder for the completionist to master the game in time for the next game to be released and

1444
01:43:10,348 --> 01:43:13,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the most skillful players have a rough time keeping up.

1445
01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:16,331
[SPEAKER_02]: These microtransactions help save time for these players.

1446
01:43:16,411 --> 01:43:17,792
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this one continues as well.

1447
01:43:18,252 --> 01:43:20,173
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's my question.

1448
01:43:20,653 --> 01:43:25,315
[SPEAKER_02]: How does the sparkly horse help you save time?

1449
01:43:25,335 --> 01:43:29,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess technically you don't have to buy a flying mount if you have one.

1450
01:43:29,617 --> 01:43:40,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, wasn't it that it used to be that if you bought one of the mounts with faster speed, naturally, that you automatically unlocked Master Flying?

1451
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:42,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the Uber.

1452
01:43:42,521 --> 01:43:44,241
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you still have to pay for Flying.

1453
01:43:44,421 --> 01:43:55,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, not paying for Flying, but I thought that it was right before they patched it out that if you had... Yes, if you get the in-game achievement for the Violet Drake, you would automatically unlock the 310 Flying.

1454
01:43:55,464 --> 01:43:55,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1455
01:43:55,804 --> 01:43:57,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's been patched out since.

1456
01:43:57,024 --> 01:43:57,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1457
01:43:59,905 --> 01:44:03,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Andy R said, I've bought plenty of DLC, mostly rock band.

1458
01:44:03,147 --> 01:44:11,171
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I appreciate the answers, but the Sparkly Horse and rock band songs aren't necessarily things you can unlock with in-game money.

1459
01:44:11,632 --> 01:44:14,093
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a key difference, too.

1460
01:44:14,393 --> 01:44:19,256
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why I wanted to draw that distinction, especially with rock band, is that it's so different.

1461
01:44:19,716 --> 01:44:30,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you're actually paying for a song that is new and you understand that licensing goes into getting that song in the game and so forth, it's very different for me.

1462
01:44:31,780 --> 01:44:36,081
[SPEAKER_02]: While Andy R agrees, I draw the line when it is something unlockable in the game.

1463
01:44:36,141 --> 01:44:36,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, there you go.

1464
01:44:37,402 --> 01:44:39,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's mostly because I'm stingy about that kind of thing.

1465
01:44:39,943 --> 01:44:43,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no problems buying add-ons to a game I'm enjoying throughout.

1466
01:44:43,664 --> 01:44:45,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a good way to put it, add-ons.

1467
01:44:46,325 --> 01:44:46,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly...

1468
01:44:48,010 --> 01:44:52,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Anomalous Underdog says, no, the only DLC I ever bought was more songs for Rocksmith.

1469
01:44:53,315 --> 01:44:57,759
[SPEAKER_02]: DLC that adds substantially new content is the only kind of DLC I'm ever willing to buy.

1470
01:44:58,119 --> 01:45:03,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Rock Band, Rocksmith, Guitar Hero, it's all, it's, it's all, hell, DDR.

1471
01:45:03,524 --> 01:45:04,745
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all the same, honestly.

1472
01:45:05,346 --> 01:45:08,248
[SPEAKER_02]: So, except when the DDR songs were on the disc.

1473
01:45:08,308 --> 01:45:11,831
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a little more shady, a little bit shady, a little bit.

1474
01:45:13,174 --> 01:45:14,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for all the questions.

1475
01:45:14,275 --> 01:45:26,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, to read the responses in full, check out our Facebook community, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, or you can search for Orange Lounge Radio on Google+, we're there as well, and you can read those answers.

1476
01:45:27,264 --> 01:45:33,849
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get back into some more news, and we already started to talk about one of these a minute ago, Loki, right?

1477
01:45:34,549 --> 01:45:35,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, yes.

1478
01:45:36,110 --> 01:45:38,912
[SPEAKER_10]: So lots of Nintendo news.

1479
01:45:39,432 --> 01:45:43,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, they had another Nintendo Direct.

1480
01:45:45,069 --> 01:45:46,170
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what you want to call it.

1481
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:48,913
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not really a press conference, but video that they made.

1482
01:45:50,955 --> 01:45:59,763
[SPEAKER_10]: They talked about a few game announcements and releases and then showed you some stuff, I guess.

1483
01:46:00,864 --> 01:46:01,245
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1484
01:46:01,345 --> 01:46:07,351
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a little hesitant on everything that I saw just because we don't know when a lot of this stuff is coming out.

1485
01:46:07,891 --> 01:46:24,704
[SPEAKER_10]: but let's just go over what they talked about so first things first um one of the big announcements was that they're gonna do an HD remake of Legends of Zelda Wind Waker and it's gonna have better graphics and gonna be on the Wii U and have all the Wii U stuff it's supposed to be coming out this fall

1486
01:46:27,176 --> 01:46:30,320
[SPEAKER_10]: So, neat, although I'm not that excited about it.

1487
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:38,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though Wind Waker is a pretty fun game, and I really do like Wind Waker, I actually thought that the new graphics don't look good.

1488
01:46:39,993 --> 01:46:40,674
[SPEAKER_10]: It's too much bloom.

1489
01:46:41,961 --> 01:46:52,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this was one of those announcements where it wasn't really surprising, and it's funny because I got into a debate with somebody on Facebook about this, about that I didn't really feel a lot of this news that came out of Nintendo was that surprising.

1490
01:46:53,468 --> 01:46:55,669
[SPEAKER_02]: And, like, it's like, well, how could you have called Wind Waker?

1491
01:46:55,769 --> 01:46:56,870
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, well, there's a difference.

1492
01:46:57,290 --> 01:47:00,392
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that I predicted it or I knew it was coming.

1493
01:47:00,452 --> 01:47:01,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's not what I'm talking about.

1494
01:47:01,993 --> 01:47:05,095
[SPEAKER_02]: When I heard the news that Wind Waker was coming out, I did more one of those...

1495
01:47:05,655 --> 01:47:06,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that makes sense.

1496
01:47:07,076 --> 01:47:09,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, actually, yeah, why didn't we see this coming?

1497
01:47:09,779 --> 01:47:12,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they always do a Zelda remake for consoles these days, it seems.

1498
01:47:13,242 --> 01:47:15,944
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the new Zelda on, you know, 3DS.

1499
01:47:16,504 --> 01:47:20,047
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a Mario remake launch the original DS.

1500
01:47:20,488 --> 01:47:25,672
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Zelda on Game Boy Advance that was, you know, cross-playable.

1501
01:47:25,973 --> 01:47:30,857
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the Zelda that launched the Wii was essentially a GameCube Zelda game, but, you know, with the controls.

1502
01:47:31,537 --> 01:47:38,324
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this whole reimagining of previous Zelda games isn't exactly a new territory for Nintendo.

1503
01:47:38,564 --> 01:47:42,708
[SPEAKER_10]: No, and I always thought that they would be doing HD remakes of games.

1504
01:47:42,728 --> 01:47:46,151
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it would be Wii games that they would do HD remakes of.

1505
01:47:46,832 --> 01:47:48,673
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess Mario GameCube games close enough.

1506
01:47:49,174 --> 01:47:49,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing, though.

1507
01:47:51,016 --> 01:47:53,158
[SPEAKER_10]: They also said they're working on another Zelda game.

1508
01:47:54,299 --> 01:47:54,499
[SPEAKER_10]: But...

1509
01:47:55,949 --> 01:47:57,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like, hey, we're working on Smash Bros.

1510
01:47:58,550 --> 01:48:01,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Grass is green, Pope is Catholic, bear shit in woods.

1511
01:48:02,631 --> 01:48:04,452
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't know when it's coming out.

1512
01:48:05,092 --> 01:48:07,353
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say at least next year, not later.

1513
01:48:08,634 --> 01:48:09,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Super Smash Bros.

1514
01:48:10,914 --> 01:48:13,595
[SPEAKER_10]: for the Wii U and 3DS is supposed to be showcased at E3.

1515
01:48:14,636 --> 01:48:15,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Doesn't say coming out this year, though.

1516
01:48:16,336 --> 01:48:17,837
[SPEAKER_10]: I like to point that out.

1517
01:48:19,498 --> 01:48:31,245
[SPEAKER_10]: They showed a video for the Yoshi game, that alleged Yoshi game that we saw in the debug menus and stuff on the whole Wii U community thing.

1518
01:48:32,766 --> 01:48:34,928
[SPEAKER_10]: It's done in the style of Kirby's Epic Yarn.

1519
01:48:37,096 --> 01:48:37,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

1520
01:48:38,397 --> 01:48:42,041
[SPEAKER_10]: No mentioning when that's coming out, but they're working on it.

1521
01:48:43,503 --> 01:48:51,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, very briefly in a video, a new game from Monolith Soft that looks sort of like Xenoblade for the Wii U.

1522
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:57,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, that was OK of all the various announcements made.

1523
01:48:58,043 --> 01:49:10,890
[SPEAKER_02]: That one was more one where it's like it was like, yay, because clearly, you know, Xenoblade had kind of a rough transition going from Japan to the US and, you know, all the stuff that went with that.

1524
01:49:11,330 --> 01:49:18,033
[SPEAKER_02]: But it came out and that kind of shows that, OK, maybe Nintendo's putting a little more stock in this than they did when it was originally on the Wii.

1525
01:49:18,474 --> 01:49:22,396
[SPEAKER_02]: So that piece of news was like got a smile out of me.

1526
01:49:24,464 --> 01:49:27,987
[SPEAKER_10]: One that I was kind of, I don't know, it was a little weird.

1527
01:49:28,387 --> 01:49:30,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Shimogami Tensei Crossfire Emblem.

1528
01:49:33,030 --> 01:49:33,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1529
01:49:33,591 --> 01:49:36,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was the one where I was like, now that's a surprise.

1530
01:49:37,353 --> 01:49:40,155
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, okay, cool, cool.

1531
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:41,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm with you here.

1532
01:49:42,017 --> 01:49:42,477
[SPEAKER_02]: That was cool.

1533
01:49:43,041 --> 01:49:44,903
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to tell you right now, that's not going to sell very well.

1534
01:49:45,404 --> 01:49:48,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Just because you've got two very niche franchises.

1535
01:49:48,246 --> 01:49:52,851
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, Fire Emblem, there are rabid fans for it, but let's be honest.

1536
01:49:54,153 --> 01:49:56,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Your soccer moms are not going to be buying this game.

1537
01:49:56,074 --> 01:50:00,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, but maybe the expectations and the budget aren't that high.

1538
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:06,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, I mean, by that logic, they would have stopped making Fire Emblem games a long time ago, but they haven't.

1539
01:50:06,445 --> 01:50:35,969
[SPEAKER_02]: so I suppose that audience as small as it may be or as niche as it may be is enough to substantiate this happening I hope they're right no the soccer moms won't buy this but that's not who Nintendo needed to talk to with this little press conference thing they did either this wasn't a soccer mom conference if Reggie Fils-Aimé wanted to talk to the soccer moms he'd go on Ellen they announced that the Miiverse is coming to smartphones so you can be able to browse the Miiverse stuff on there

1540
01:50:37,846 --> 01:50:40,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that was surprising and not surprising at the same time.

1541
01:50:40,768 --> 01:50:44,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, you're like, oh, holy shit, a Nintendo app on the iPhone.

1542
01:50:44,649 --> 01:50:49,852
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you're like, oh, yeah, the investors have been, like, breathing down their fucking necks to do something on the iPhone.

1543
01:50:50,132 --> 01:50:54,514
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the Pokemon company finally did their thing, you know, for what it's worth on the iPhone.

1544
01:50:56,355 --> 01:50:58,036
[SPEAKER_02]: This is to appease investors.

1545
01:50:58,176 --> 01:51:00,077
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Nintendo's move to appease investors.

1546
01:51:00,377 --> 01:51:00,837
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what this is.

1547
01:51:00,857 --> 01:51:05,440
[SPEAKER_10]: I just hope it's good because they sure as hell don't know how to code anything for the internet.

1548
01:51:05,540 --> 01:51:05,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Well...

1549
01:51:06,974 --> 01:51:13,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Me-verse is one of the more fascinating features of the Wii U. I guess we'll leave it at that.

1550
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:16,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Pleasant surprises.

1551
01:51:16,761 --> 01:51:17,662
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good way to put it.

1552
01:51:17,762 --> 01:51:25,167
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a pleasant surprise on the Wii U. This summer, we're going to be getting a sequel to Wii Party, a party game that no one fucking bought.

1553
01:51:28,055 --> 01:51:29,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now, wait a minute, Loki.

1554
01:51:29,477 --> 01:51:35,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm calling you out on this because you just said, here's one that soccer moms won't give a shit about, yet now here's WeParty.

1555
01:51:36,264 --> 01:51:37,685
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who did buy that game?

1556
01:51:38,566 --> 01:51:39,107
[SPEAKER_02]: No one.

1557
01:51:39,267 --> 01:51:40,168
[SPEAKER_02]: No, soccer moms.

1558
01:51:40,228 --> 01:51:41,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody bought it.

1559
01:51:41,249 --> 01:51:41,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Trust me.

1560
01:51:41,850 --> 01:51:42,931
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to sell this game.

1561
01:51:43,251 --> 01:51:44,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody fucking bought it.

1562
01:51:45,774 --> 01:51:47,576
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just like, is it Mario Party?

1563
01:51:47,896 --> 01:51:48,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope.

1564
01:51:48,276 --> 01:51:48,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't care.

1565
01:51:50,278 --> 01:51:52,540
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why they would make a sequel to a game that didn't sell.

1566
01:51:52,620 --> 01:51:53,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's Nintendo.

1567
01:51:53,761 --> 01:51:55,022
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll do whatever they want.

1568
01:51:55,082 --> 01:51:56,923
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's minimal effort.

1569
01:51:57,663 --> 01:52:04,328
[SPEAKER_10]: But one of the big things that they were touting with this is that you'll be able to do two-player gameplay on the gamepad.

1570
01:52:04,968 --> 01:52:06,530
[SPEAKER_10]: And you'll be able to basically just...

1571
01:52:07,594 --> 01:52:14,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of like how they showed some of the demos and stuff that you could do, like stuff where you can play air hockey or whatever on the gamepad.

1572
01:52:15,579 --> 01:52:19,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Although, explain to me how that's going to fucking work since it doesn't have multi-touch.

1573
01:52:20,682 --> 01:52:29,407
[SPEAKER_02]: WeParty, VGCharts.com, 1.67 million in North America, 3.27 million in Europe.

1574
01:52:29,467 --> 01:52:31,268
[SPEAKER_02]: This is games being made for Europe.

1575
01:52:31,629 --> 01:52:33,590
[SPEAKER_02]: North America sold less than Japan, too.

1576
01:52:33,990 --> 01:52:37,132
[SPEAKER_02]: But 1.67 is nothing to bat your eyelashes at, so...

1577
01:52:37,540 --> 01:52:40,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I wonder how many of those were after the game dropped down to nothing.

1578
01:52:42,201 --> 01:52:44,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like me to look at the week-by-week detail?

1579
01:52:44,242 --> 01:52:44,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I would.

1580
01:52:45,102 --> 01:52:46,123
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd love to.

1581
01:52:46,443 --> 01:52:47,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's take a peek.

1582
01:52:47,503 --> 01:52:48,823
[SPEAKER_10]: I can tell you that no one bought that.

1583
01:52:50,004 --> 01:52:53,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, again, Europe was the biggest selling region for that game.

1584
01:52:53,225 --> 01:52:54,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is really odd.

1585
01:52:54,405 --> 01:52:56,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they not get a Mario Party game over there or something?

1586
01:52:57,206 --> 01:52:57,546
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1587
01:52:57,606 --> 01:52:59,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's just different strokes for different folks, right?

1588
01:52:59,767 --> 01:53:00,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1589
01:53:00,127 --> 01:53:01,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to bring it up here week-by-week.

1590
01:53:03,388 --> 01:53:03,888
Nah.

1591
01:53:05,639 --> 01:53:06,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep going.

1592
01:53:06,160 --> 01:53:06,960
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll figure it out.

1593
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:07,540
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1594
01:53:08,041 --> 01:53:12,824
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, of course, one of the announcements was the whole Virtual Console trial thing.

1595
01:53:14,645 --> 01:53:20,288
[SPEAKER_02]: The highest amount of sales were the week of November 27th, but that's the Black Friday week in 2010.

1596
01:53:20,328 --> 01:53:20,568
[SPEAKER_02]: It did sell...

1597
01:53:25,291 --> 01:53:26,232
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1598
01:53:44,789 --> 01:54:02,394
[SPEAKER_10]: So, the Virtual Console Trial Program basically kind of gets you guys hooked on buying Virtual Console games for the Wii U. You would be able to purchase, they're going to have 30 cent games and they're going to be available for 30 days, basically a month for each.

1599
01:54:02,814 --> 01:54:29,007
[SPEAKER_10]: so the first one of course for January was Balloon Fight and then for February they're going to have F-Zero March is Punch Out featuring Mr. Dream, April Kirby's Adventure, May Super Metroid June Yoshi and July Donkey Kong and 30 cents each and you know if you don't buy them during that time frame then you're going to have to pay the $1 or $1.50 to upgrade them or you know not

1600
01:54:32,548 --> 01:54:33,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it so hard?

1601
01:54:57,483 --> 01:54:58,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1602
01:55:16,010 --> 01:55:17,251
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1603
01:55:41,563 --> 01:55:47,069
[SPEAKER_02]: and thank fuck, finally, you don't have to put your TV into 4.3 mode.

1604
01:55:47,889 --> 01:55:52,774
[SPEAKER_02]: It will finally, like it knows to scrunch down the image of the picture to be appropriate.

1605
01:55:52,834 --> 01:55:55,837
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not all stretched like the Wii Virtual Console was.

1606
01:55:55,997 --> 01:55:57,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God, finally.

1607
01:55:58,119 --> 01:56:03,264
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, are those two things enough to really substantiate a buck fifty upgrade?

1608
01:56:04,265 --> 01:56:07,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, and that's not $1.50 for the game, people.

1609
01:56:08,248 --> 01:56:11,150
[SPEAKER_02]: That's $1.50 when you already dropped seven or eight on it.

1610
01:56:11,430 --> 01:56:12,872
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my big sticking point.

1611
01:56:13,192 --> 01:56:14,073
[SPEAKER_02]: People are forgetting.

1612
01:56:14,133 --> 01:56:16,274
[SPEAKER_02]: We already paid a decent amount of money.

1613
01:56:16,294 --> 01:56:23,060
[SPEAKER_10]: And the reason that they're doing that, they claim, is because there's no... Well, the reason we think is because there's no real way to link them.

1614
01:56:23,470 --> 01:56:25,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Yet, at the same time, there's no real way to link it.

1615
01:56:26,932 --> 01:56:35,638
[SPEAKER_10]: When they not know that you've already purchased it and wouldn't charge you just the $1.50, so they do know that you bought it, the least they could do is, hey, you know what?

1616
01:56:36,639 --> 01:56:37,559
[SPEAKER_10]: You bought these games.

1617
01:56:37,780 --> 01:56:38,300
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll tell you what.

1618
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:39,741
[SPEAKER_10]: You import them over.

1619
01:56:41,042 --> 01:56:44,944
[SPEAKER_10]: When those downloads become available, you get the Wii U version for free.

1620
01:56:45,685 --> 01:56:47,006
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, really, what are they missing out on?

1621
01:56:47,146 --> 01:56:47,506
[SPEAKER_10]: A dollar?

1622
01:56:48,046 --> 01:56:48,867
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, come on.

1623
01:56:49,748 --> 01:56:50,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Just do that.

1624
01:56:50,908 --> 01:56:53,270
[SPEAKER_10]: It would show some really, you know, hey, you know what?

1625
01:56:54,691 --> 01:56:55,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Network Multiplayer

1626
01:57:11,169 --> 01:57:12,090
[SPEAKER_02]: How hard is that?

1627
01:57:12,810 --> 01:57:14,771
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess too laggy or something.

1628
01:57:15,251 --> 01:57:16,812
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hard to build netcode in emulators.

1629
01:57:17,072 --> 01:57:20,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, but wait, they already did that shit on PC.

1630
01:57:20,854 --> 01:57:27,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Homebrew emulators have netcode where you can play games over the internet.

1631
01:57:28,278 --> 01:57:28,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Multiplayer.

1632
01:57:29,178 --> 01:57:30,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, go fake.

1633
01:57:30,959 --> 01:57:35,541
[SPEAKER_10]: If only the company that fucking made the games could come up with netcode.

1634
01:57:35,981 --> 01:57:39,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, but that would be asking them to embrace the internet and they don't fucking understand yet.

1635
01:57:42,523 --> 01:57:42,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that it?

1636
01:57:43,183 --> 01:57:43,443
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

1637
01:57:43,664 --> 01:57:43,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

1638
01:57:44,244 --> 01:57:44,524
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done.

1639
01:57:46,045 --> 01:57:46,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't sure if there was more.

1640
01:57:47,425 --> 01:57:47,705
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1641
01:57:48,025 --> 01:58:00,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's move on with something else about the Wii U. And a very interesting comment that was made this week by Crystal Dynamics, who, of course, as you know, are making the Wii U...

1642
01:58:01,431 --> 01:58:30,120
[SPEAKER_02]: or excuse me they're not making the Wii that was the comment Crystal Dynamics is making Tomb Raider and the comment was about a Wii U version of Tomb Raider because you know why not we had you know Batman Arkham City and you know these other games that were Mass Effect 3 were ported to Wii U so where's our Tomb Raider port to the Wii U and you know if creative director Noah Hughes if you try to read between the lines of what he said here it's probably not happening

1643
01:58:31,061 --> 01:58:32,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always a fan of Nintendo systems.

1644
01:58:32,783 --> 01:58:39,030
[SPEAKER_02]: In particular, they really push interface design, and from a game design perspective, it's fun to play with the new interfaces.

1645
01:58:39,251 --> 01:58:42,975
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's the nice little, like, I'm going to say something nice, and then here's the but.

1646
01:58:43,195 --> 01:58:49,123
[SPEAKER_02]: But, having said that, it's something that I think we would want to tailor the experience to if we were going to do it.

1647
01:58:49,523 --> 01:58:58,709
[SPEAKER_02]: and currently we're offering it on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC and all three of those are really trying to deliver roughly the same experience but delivered best on each platform.

1648
01:58:59,050 --> 01:59:08,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I think something like the Wii U often asks you to do something unique based on a unique interface so that's something as a gamer I love but it's something that you don't want to do half-heartedly as a developer.

1649
01:59:09,733 --> 01:59:23,851
[SPEAKER_02]: so in other words they don't want to try and at least what I'm hearing in here they don't want to try and put Tomb Raider on the Wii U when it wasn't really designed with the Wii U in mind when there's something extra going on there and I say makes sense to me yeah

1650
01:59:25,037 --> 01:59:46,023
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, maybe there's somewhere else where Lara Croft can fit on the Wii U You know, there were those games, the Xbox Live, thank you, the Guardian of Light, the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade games I bet one of those games could be done very well on the Wii U If they wanted to do that, I don't know

1651
01:59:46,603 --> 01:59:59,170
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think it's really late for them to, they've been working on Tomb Raider for a while, it's probably late to them to make a port and it might not be that beneficial because they're worried that the numbers aren't there yet to support that.

1652
01:59:59,370 --> 02:00:00,931
[SPEAKER_02]: No, makes sense to me, I get it.

1653
02:00:02,372 --> 02:00:14,378
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I honestly, I think the people that want to play Tomb Raider probably already have, are the types of people that already have Xbox, Playstation 3 or a PC, you know, like PC's a pretty big market, you know.

1654
02:00:15,507 --> 02:00:17,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's move on with more news.

1655
02:00:17,388 --> 02:00:17,908
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

1656
02:00:19,029 --> 02:00:25,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is the news we've been waiting for and it's already been all over the place and I'm sure everyone knows about it, but this is super, super awesome.

1657
02:00:25,973 --> 02:00:37,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, we talked last week about how Jonathan Coulton had been kind of shafted, well actually really shafted when it came to Glee's treatment of his cover of Baby Got Back.

1658
02:00:38,354 --> 02:00:47,770
[SPEAKER_05]: So now, even though there's still some legal research going on with this what he's done is re-released his original as a cover of a cover of his cover

1659
02:00:49,392 --> 02:00:56,315
[SPEAKER_05]: So now it's listed on iTunes, Amazon, and Google Play as Baby Got Back in the style of Glee.

1660
02:00:57,636 --> 02:00:58,656
[SPEAKER_05]: And I paid for it.

1661
02:00:58,716 --> 02:00:59,677
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's a good cause.

1662
02:00:59,777 --> 02:01:02,938
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically what's going to happen with this, he's using the same license he had before.

1663
02:01:03,759 --> 02:01:15,684
[SPEAKER_05]: So after basically Sir Mix-a-Lot gets paid, then the proceeds, and iTunes, then any other proceeds are going to be donated to the VH1 Save the Music Foundation and the It Gets Better Project.

1664
02:01:16,344 --> 02:01:22,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Which roundaboutly goes back to Glee because they're also sending donations to that.

1665
02:01:23,910 --> 02:01:30,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a lot of the comments I've been reading is that Glee is supposed to be all anti-bullying and stuff, but what is Fox doing to JoCo in this case?

1666
02:01:30,896 --> 02:01:31,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much, yeah.

1667
02:01:31,937 --> 02:01:33,038
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of sick.

1668
02:01:33,198 --> 02:01:35,380
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it comes down to the bottom line, it's all about greed.

1669
02:01:36,308 --> 02:01:38,590
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who the real winner is in this scenario, though?

1670
02:01:39,030 --> 02:01:39,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Sir Mix-a-Lot.

1671
02:01:39,871 --> 02:01:40,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1672
02:01:40,111 --> 02:01:41,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, dude, all this money.

1673
02:01:42,633 --> 02:01:45,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's given Sir Mix-a-Lot any thought recently, you know?

1674
02:01:46,156 --> 02:01:46,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

1675
02:01:46,937 --> 02:01:48,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what's the last thing he's done?

1676
02:01:48,458 --> 02:01:50,820
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy's like, thank God I can pay the rent this month.

1677
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:56,804
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he's actually, to tell you the truth, he's actually still been, I think he did, like, a lot of producing.

1678
02:01:57,525 --> 02:01:58,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I wouldn't doubt it.

1679
02:01:58,846 --> 02:01:59,687
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what happens to a lot of those.

1680
02:01:59,707 --> 02:02:02,949
[SPEAKER_05]: But honestly, the last Sir Mix-a-Lot song that ever came out that I gave a damn about was Buttermilk Biscuits.

1681
02:02:03,270 --> 02:02:03,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.

1682
02:02:04,010 --> 02:02:04,891
[SPEAKER_05]: So, just saying.

1683
02:02:05,886 --> 02:02:08,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Guru in our chatroom says, Coverception.

1684
02:02:10,310 --> 02:02:14,653
[SPEAKER_10]: He needs to actually be knighted, and then he can really be Sir Mix-a-Lot.

1685
02:02:16,754 --> 02:02:18,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that would be awesome.

1686
02:02:20,737 --> 02:02:21,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

1687
02:02:21,178 --> 02:02:22,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't we have that happen?

1688
02:02:23,119 --> 02:02:23,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1689
02:02:23,519 --> 02:02:25,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Write the Queen of England and suggest that.

1690
02:02:25,281 --> 02:02:26,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, he's not English, for one.

1691
02:02:26,762 --> 02:02:28,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

1692
02:02:28,043 --> 02:02:28,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

1693
02:02:28,984 --> 02:02:30,084
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll make an exception.

1694
02:02:30,104 --> 02:02:31,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Make an exception.

1695
02:02:31,345 --> 02:02:33,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that actually non-Englishmen can be knighted.

1696
02:02:34,608 --> 02:02:34,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1697
02:02:35,589 --> 02:02:37,131
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to double check it, but I think so.

1698
02:02:37,552 --> 02:02:41,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe Sir Mix-a-Lot can just be an ambassador, you know, if it's good enough for something.

1699
02:02:41,677 --> 02:02:43,239
[SPEAKER_05]: How about we just call him Mr. Mix-a-Lot?

1700
02:02:43,960 --> 02:02:44,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Mix-a-Lot?

1701
02:02:45,582 --> 02:02:48,065
[SPEAKER_10]: The ambassador to large posteriors.

1702
02:02:49,848 --> 02:02:50,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Bootyvania.

1703
02:02:53,644 --> 02:02:55,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, moving on, Loki.

1704
02:02:56,565 --> 02:03:01,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so... This guy, I don't know what to do.

1705
02:03:01,847 --> 02:03:04,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, can these people get voted out of office already?

1706
02:03:05,148 --> 02:03:06,108
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, seriously?

1707
02:03:06,548 --> 02:03:08,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Senator Leland Yee.

1708
02:03:08,729 --> 02:03:11,270
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1709
02:03:26,378 --> 02:03:30,139
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure he's trying to pass another anti-gaming law or something like that.

1710
02:03:32,139 --> 02:03:42,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is in response to all the voices you're hearing in the community about, hey, stop blaming us for that sick stuff that happened at Sandy Hook.

1711
02:03:43,122 --> 02:03:47,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's where he's saying gamers need to kind of be quiet.

1712
02:03:47,202 --> 02:03:49,083
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, no, you be quiet.

1713
02:03:49,663 --> 02:03:49,863
Yeah.

1714
02:03:50,143 --> 02:03:51,003
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you shut up!

1715
02:04:22,091 --> 02:04:24,615
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, I do have an expansion for what I just said.

1716
02:04:25,596 --> 02:04:31,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody can be knighted, but they can't accept a peerage unless they renounce their current citizenship.

1717
02:04:32,647 --> 02:04:33,247
[SPEAKER_05]: So, just saying.

1718
02:04:33,408 --> 02:04:35,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Leland Yee should certainly not be knighted.

1719
02:04:35,811 --> 02:04:36,793
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he should be set on fire.

1720
02:04:37,967 --> 02:04:38,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, did I say that out loud?

1721
02:04:38,968 --> 02:04:39,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1722
02:04:39,709 --> 02:04:40,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Metaphorically.

1723
02:04:40,570 --> 02:04:41,951
[SPEAKER_05]: He needs to be fired.

1724
02:04:42,312 --> 02:04:42,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1725
02:04:42,912 --> 02:04:43,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Fired.

1726
02:04:43,373 --> 02:04:43,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Much better.

1727
02:04:44,454 --> 02:04:46,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he ran for mayor of San Francisco, if I remember right.

1728
02:04:46,957 --> 02:04:47,437
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't get it.

1729
02:04:47,858 --> 02:04:49,740
[SPEAKER_05]: He can be smothered in a bag of dicks.

1730
02:04:50,641 --> 02:04:51,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Metaphorically.

1731
02:04:51,422 --> 02:04:51,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Metaphorically.

1732
02:04:52,983 --> 02:04:53,924
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, I don't know.

1733
02:04:54,185 --> 02:04:54,425
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean...

1734
02:04:57,100 --> 02:05:02,505
[SPEAKER_10]: There's just a lot of ignorant people out there, and they're only getting older.

1735
02:05:02,785 --> 02:05:04,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you say that quote from him, too?

1736
02:05:04,306 --> 02:05:05,027
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that again?

1737
02:05:05,147 --> 02:05:16,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Gamers need to... It wasn't gamers need to shut up, but gamers need to... Gamers have just got to quiet down, and then gamers have no credibility in this argument.

1738
02:05:16,757 --> 02:05:16,917
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1739
02:05:19,983 --> 02:05:23,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, let me make your job easier in passing these unconstitutional laws.

1740
02:05:23,725 --> 02:05:24,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just quiet down.

1741
02:05:24,886 --> 02:05:34,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't I just ignore the First Amendment that gives me the right to call you out on your hate spewing and misjudgment of our community?

1742
02:05:34,231 --> 02:05:37,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, you people of color, why don't you just quiet down?

1743
02:05:37,853 --> 02:05:40,495
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't need to pass these equality laws or anything.

1744
02:05:40,535 --> 02:05:40,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Why don't you just...

1745
02:05:41,235 --> 02:05:42,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop complaining.

1746
02:05:43,136 --> 02:05:44,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, gays, shut up.

1747
02:05:44,836 --> 02:05:48,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, seriously, gays, just stop complaining.

1748
02:05:48,457 --> 02:05:50,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them throw you in trash cans.

1749
02:05:50,678 --> 02:05:51,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Bag is just a word.

1750
02:05:51,879 --> 02:05:54,139
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just trying to do my job here, okay?

1751
02:05:54,219 --> 02:05:55,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Passing these laws.

1752
02:05:55,580 --> 02:05:56,260
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what?

1753
02:05:56,740 --> 02:06:01,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Women get the same thing too because we're told we're not able to decide what goes on with our girl bits.

1754
02:06:02,762 --> 02:06:04,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, you don't have a vag, you can't talk about it.

1755
02:06:05,447 --> 02:06:06,408
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I think.

1756
02:06:06,629 --> 02:06:08,051
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say the same thing to the non-gamers.

1757
02:06:08,432 --> 02:06:09,914
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't game, you're not allowed to talk about it.

1758
02:06:09,954 --> 02:06:12,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you saying Leland Yee should play a video game?

1759
02:06:12,198 --> 02:06:13,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I think he should.

1760
02:06:13,360 --> 02:06:16,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, he can't grow a vag, but at least he can pick up a controller.

1761
02:06:19,420 --> 02:06:21,702
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I guess we could arrange that in some surgery.

1762
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:50,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Custard's Revenge

1763
02:07:16,645 --> 02:07:18,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this comment, and I think we'll end with this.

1764
02:07:18,406 --> 02:07:21,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of Zaku in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

1765
02:07:21,248 --> 02:07:24,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Leland Yee channeling his inner Marie Antoinette.

1766
02:07:24,991 --> 02:07:26,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Go eat cake, gamers.

1767
02:07:28,413 --> 02:07:29,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Very well spoken.

1768
02:07:29,854 --> 02:07:31,515
[SPEAKER_02]: But we all know what happened to Marie Antoinette.

1769
02:07:32,236 --> 02:07:32,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Metaphorically.

1770
02:07:33,637 --> 02:07:36,198
[SPEAKER_05]: No, she got... It really happened to her.

1771
02:07:36,478 --> 02:07:39,080
[SPEAKER_05]: And besides that, though, I think that... I think he...

1772
02:07:40,581 --> 02:07:43,783
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got my inner history nerd is totally just screaming.

1773
02:07:43,803 --> 02:07:44,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it go, girl.

1774
02:07:44,344 --> 02:07:44,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it go.

1775
02:07:44,704 --> 02:07:45,344
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just tell them to chat.

1776
02:07:45,985 --> 02:07:46,665
Okay.

1777
02:07:47,626 --> 02:07:55,852
[SPEAKER_02]: See what you're missing by not being at live.vognetwork.com Well, if you think it's just Leland Yee, you're wrong.

1778
02:07:56,932 --> 02:08:01,796
[SPEAKER_02]: More light gun games and gun games disappearing after more complaints.

1779
02:08:05,151 --> 02:08:05,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Wake up!

1780
02:08:24,571 --> 02:08:25,771
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting blamed for this.

1781
02:08:26,352 --> 02:08:39,737
[SPEAKER_02]: You, who might not even be into some of these video games, you as a gamer, as somebody who sought out this podcast and downloaded it knowing we talked about video games, you are a gamer one way or the other.

1782
02:08:41,057 --> 02:08:42,838
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 99.9% sure you are.

1783
02:08:43,238 --> 02:08:47,760
[SPEAKER_02]: You are being blamed for this tragedy that happened back east.

1784
02:08:48,901 --> 02:08:49,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Wake up.

1785
02:08:50,041 --> 02:08:52,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't forget about the other people who are getting blamed for it too.

1786
02:08:55,077 --> 02:08:55,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they?

1787
02:08:55,457 --> 02:08:56,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yes.

1788
02:08:56,758 --> 02:08:59,919
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's... I mean, like, movies and TV and so forth.

1789
02:08:59,959 --> 02:09:05,581
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like a lot of that is getting... No, I'm talking about autism spectrum people who are also getting shafted out of the whole thing, too.

1790
02:09:05,701 --> 02:09:06,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that's very true.

1791
02:09:06,821 --> 02:09:07,782
[SPEAKER_10]: You know who's to blame?

1792
02:09:08,942 --> 02:09:11,163
[SPEAKER_10]: It's that damn show, Grey's Anatomy.

1793
02:09:11,743 --> 02:09:12,003
[SPEAKER_10]: It is.

1794
02:09:12,644 --> 02:09:13,304
[SPEAKER_02]: It's to blame.

1795
02:09:13,624 --> 02:09:13,864
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

1796
02:09:14,044 --> 02:09:14,844
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Glee's fault.

1797
02:09:14,864 --> 02:09:16,585
[SPEAKER_10]: There's so much violence on that show.

1798
02:09:16,645 --> 02:09:18,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Blood and guts everywhere.

1799
02:09:18,266 --> 02:09:19,346
[SPEAKER_10]: And sex.

1800
02:09:19,926 --> 02:09:21,947
[SPEAKER_10]: There's sexing on that show.

1801
02:09:22,767 --> 02:09:24,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Glee taught me how to steal.

1802
02:09:26,347 --> 02:09:29,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I robbed a 7-Eleven because Glee said it was okay to steal.

1803
02:09:29,210 --> 02:09:31,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I pirated all that music because Glee made it okay.

1804
02:09:32,132 --> 02:09:33,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Fox is saying, hey, this is what we do.

1805
02:09:34,854 --> 02:09:40,098
[SPEAKER_10]: We copy that floppy until the cows come home.

1806
02:09:40,839 --> 02:09:41,319
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

1807
02:09:41,419 --> 02:09:42,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, what are you going to do about it?

1808
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:44,842
[SPEAKER_10]: You should be happy that I'm listening to your music.

1809
02:09:44,862 --> 02:09:49,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Why don't you go make some more music so I can steal that too?

1810
02:09:52,896 --> 02:09:53,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't have a headache now.

1811
02:10:09,279 --> 02:10:13,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Our first email comes from, I mispronounced the name, Ramaditya.

1812
02:10:14,122 --> 02:10:15,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi guys, this is Ramaditya.

1813
02:10:16,544 --> 02:10:20,647
[SPEAKER_05]: This month I tried to give you pictures from my wedding, but unfortunately Facebook blocked your access.

1814
02:10:21,047 --> 02:10:24,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I would like to share one of the greatest parts of my marriage ceremony, the Star Wars wedding party.

1815
02:10:25,690 --> 02:10:29,893
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually a YouTube video, so we really can't pull it up and watch it right now during the show.

1816
02:10:30,734 --> 02:10:33,997
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the first three minutes where actually my greetings and preparation.

1817
02:10:34,377 --> 02:10:37,819
[SPEAKER_05]: You may watch the duel in front of the audience when you reach the middle part of the video.

1818
02:10:38,220 --> 02:10:42,563
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope this will inspire other fellow gamers to do something unique to their unforgettable events in life.

1819
02:10:43,704 --> 02:10:46,386
[SPEAKER_05]: See, Dan and I, when we got married, we just went to the courthouse.

1820
02:10:46,686 --> 02:10:49,048
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he made faces at me, and I punched him.

1821
02:10:50,529 --> 02:10:52,310
[SPEAKER_05]: I punched him in the arm and told him to knock it off.

1822
02:10:53,411 --> 02:10:54,112
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my wedding.

1823
02:10:55,228 --> 02:10:56,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for sharing it with us.

1824
02:11:09,944 --> 02:11:10,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, next email.

1825
02:11:10,885 --> 02:11:11,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Good day, OLR.

1826
02:11:11,766 --> 02:11:13,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for reading my email on the show.

1827
02:11:14,008 --> 02:11:15,670
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe you guys are still on the air.

1828
02:11:16,030 --> 02:11:16,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Neither can we.

1829
02:11:16,791 --> 02:11:17,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Neither can we.

1830
02:11:18,312 --> 02:11:21,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I've started listening from the beginning and it's brought back some outstanding memories.

1831
02:11:21,695 --> 02:11:25,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize if this runs a little long, but I first heard the show in a rather unusual way.

1832
02:11:25,699 --> 02:11:29,843
[SPEAKER_05]: It was at an old glow-in-the-dark bowling alley double arcade owned by the nicest group of people I've ever met.

1833
02:11:30,663 --> 02:11:34,907
[SPEAKER_05]: What I mean by double arcade is... Somebody was playing this show at a bowling alley?

1834
02:11:35,528 --> 02:11:35,548
[SPEAKER_05]: I...

1835
02:11:36,589 --> 02:11:37,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me read it.

1836
02:11:37,910 --> 02:11:39,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me read the damn email!

1837
02:11:39,071 --> 02:11:40,212
[SPEAKER_05]: We say fucking shit.

1838
02:11:40,812 --> 02:11:41,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck, fuck, cock.

1839
02:11:42,414 --> 02:11:42,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1840
02:11:43,314 --> 02:11:49,600
[SPEAKER_05]: What I mean by double arcade is that it was split into two adjoining rooms, each with their own genre of cabinets.

1841
02:11:49,620 --> 02:11:51,901
[SPEAKER_05]: The first room was row after row of fighting games.

1842
02:11:52,322 --> 02:11:53,383
[SPEAKER_05]: The other was the Bimani room.

1843
02:11:53,843 --> 02:12:22,779
[SPEAKER_05]: That host near weekly tournaments of each and yearly Bimani Game Festival On the morning of said festival, I remember hearing a clip from your show talking about 2DX And loved hearing the host chat it up I completely forgot to ask about it, I was too excited waiting for Chorus K to arrive And I've been keeping an ear out ever since Just to a few weeks ago, while looking up a new WoW podcast to listen to I somehow ended up downloading an episode of Horde House The whole episode I kept thinking, boy this Rob Roberts guy sure sounds awfully damn familiar And then you eventually mentioned OLR

1844
02:12:24,020 --> 02:12:28,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I downloaded the newest episode of that and voila, I've somehow managed to find my show all these years later.

1845
02:12:29,184 --> 02:12:32,946
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you so much for everything you do and have done for the last decade now.

1846
02:12:33,326 --> 02:12:38,570
[SPEAKER_05]: You've reminded me of some just simply unbelievable memories of a place that got flooded years and years ago now.

1847
02:12:38,670 --> 02:12:39,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Much love.

1848
02:12:39,931 --> 02:12:40,951
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's Plagius?

1849
02:12:41,132 --> 02:12:41,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Plagius?

1850
02:12:42,970 --> 02:12:45,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, Horde House did something good.

1851
02:12:46,672 --> 02:12:47,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm teasing, I'm teasing.

1852
02:12:48,153 --> 02:12:50,074
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty amazing.

1853
02:12:50,174 --> 02:12:52,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Still, the whole bowling alley thing blows me away.

1854
02:12:52,916 --> 02:12:56,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I have heard that this show gets played in some very interesting places.

1855
02:12:56,958 --> 02:12:59,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard there was a GameStop that was playing this show somewhere.

1856
02:12:59,540 --> 02:13:01,221
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, can't you get in trouble for that?

1857
02:13:01,241 --> 02:13:02,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we use naughty language.

1858
02:13:02,822 --> 02:13:04,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they were doing it after hours or what.

1859
02:13:04,523 --> 02:13:05,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we talking about the evil G?

1860
02:13:06,504 --> 02:13:07,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right?

1861
02:13:08,245 --> 02:13:09,226
[SPEAKER_02]: So it must have been after hours.

1862
02:13:09,246 --> 02:13:09,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the irony.

1863
02:13:10,306 --> 02:13:10,907
[SPEAKER_02]: It must have been.

1864
02:13:10,967 --> 02:13:11,287
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1865
02:13:12,327 --> 02:13:14,229
[SPEAKER_10]: That evil G must be Goodfellas.

1866
02:13:14,309 --> 02:13:16,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Goodyear Tires, clearly.

1867
02:13:16,230 --> 02:13:17,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Goodyear Tires.

1868
02:13:17,150 --> 02:13:18,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn that Goodyear Tires.

1869
02:13:18,551 --> 02:13:22,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, also, this was a few years ago before there was so much fuckery.

1870
02:13:22,293 --> 02:13:23,574
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, let's be real.

1871
02:13:23,894 --> 02:13:28,557
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a time and place when that was a store we all went to regularly.

1872
02:13:28,797 --> 02:13:29,657
[SPEAKER_05]: And my husband worked at.

1873
02:13:29,798 --> 02:13:30,278
Exactly.

1874
02:13:31,038 --> 02:13:31,639
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different now.

1875
02:13:32,099 --> 02:13:36,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard of a LAN gaming center that was playing this show at one point, which, you know, that's pretty cool.

1876
02:13:37,123 --> 02:13:37,823
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, bowling alley.

1877
02:13:38,103 --> 02:13:42,647
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to say to all the bowling alleys, how do you cheer on bowlers?

1878
02:13:43,743 --> 02:13:44,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll the ball!

1879
02:13:45,864 --> 02:13:46,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Knock the pin!

1880
02:13:47,304 --> 02:13:48,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Go Turkey!

1881
02:13:48,204 --> 02:13:49,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Get that turkey!

1882
02:13:49,444 --> 02:13:50,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Clap, clap, clap.

1883
02:13:50,705 --> 02:13:51,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1884
02:13:51,325 --> 02:13:52,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I need J-Links.

1885
02:13:53,265 --> 02:13:54,766
[SPEAKER_02]: J-Links, how do you cheer a bowler?

1886
02:13:54,886 --> 02:13:59,127
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes me think of Global at... What the fuck is that?

1887
02:13:59,607 --> 02:13:59,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Country Club.

1888
02:13:59,867 --> 02:14:00,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Country Club Lanes.

1889
02:14:00,627 --> 02:14:00,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1890
02:14:00,967 --> 02:14:03,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, one of our old school DDR spots.

1891
02:14:03,308 --> 02:14:06,269
[SPEAKER_05]: The last time I did Global was when Mel and Melody were in town.

1892
02:14:06,609 --> 02:14:07,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't you come too?

1893
02:14:07,691 --> 02:14:36,857
[SPEAKER_05]: probably we need to go global it was like 2 in the morning and we were like you know what this email wants me to do it makes me want to go bowling because I haven't been bowling in forever let's do it while I'm not working last email hey OLR decided to put some time into getting the Wiimote working on my Windows 7 machine but apparently the new Wiimotes don't like to play with Windows do you have any suggestions you can point me towards or even better a surefire way to get it to work tanks in advance and this comes from Xenocore

1894
02:14:37,700 --> 02:14:39,182
[SPEAKER_10]: It should just work.

1895
02:14:40,324 --> 02:14:43,048
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Bluetooth, so it'd work like any Bluetooth device.

1896
02:14:43,068 --> 02:14:45,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes they can be a little bit tricky to set up.

1897
02:14:45,532 --> 02:14:54,004
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember I had a Bluetooth dongle for my laptop, and I tried getting a Wii remote to work with that with an emulator, and it was just like...

1898
02:14:54,244 --> 02:14:55,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope, not going to do it.

1899
02:14:56,145 --> 02:15:04,847
[SPEAKER_10]: So it may just be you might need to try a different adapter or you may need to try syncing in a different way.

1900
02:15:04,887 --> 02:15:06,547
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you can't just push the sync button.

1901
02:15:06,567 --> 02:15:10,368
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you have to push the 1 and 2 buttons at the same time, if I remember correctly.

1902
02:15:11,909 --> 02:15:17,170
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I got one to sync up to my Android phone to play some games on that.

1903
02:15:18,130 --> 02:15:20,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, that was my old Android phone.

1904
02:15:20,051 --> 02:15:20,931
[SPEAKER_10]: I should try the new one too.

1905
02:15:21,792 --> 02:15:26,478
[SPEAKER_10]: but I've got a Bluetooth controller for that now and I think this laptop has Bluetooth built in.

1906
02:15:27,058 --> 02:15:30,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Hell, I know my wife's netbook has Bluetooth built in so I should try that.

1907
02:15:30,963 --> 02:15:33,606
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to read this part of his signature too.

1908
02:15:34,367 --> 02:15:35,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Power corrupts.

1909
02:15:35,249 --> 02:15:36,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

1910
02:15:36,891 --> 02:15:38,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Trivial power corrupts disproportionately.

1911
02:15:39,934 --> 02:15:40,295
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

1912
02:15:41,055 --> 02:15:41,415
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1913
02:15:42,175 --> 02:15:42,636
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it?

1914
02:15:42,936 --> 02:15:43,416
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1915
02:15:43,496 --> 02:15:44,896
[SPEAKER_02]: We need more bowling alley emails.

1916
02:15:44,976 --> 02:15:48,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at orangeslimesradio.com And we're spent.

1917
02:15:48,757 --> 02:15:52,839
[SPEAKER_10]: So where's the craziest place you kids have listened to this show?

1918
02:15:52,959 --> 02:15:55,139
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of what I want to know, like for real.

1919
02:15:55,159 --> 02:15:56,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of miss strikes now.

1920
02:15:57,940 --> 02:15:58,941
[SPEAKER_02]: There still is a strike.

1921
02:15:58,981 --> 02:16:00,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but that's when we need to go.

1922
02:16:00,381 --> 02:16:01,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, because you haven't been in a while.

1923
02:16:01,841 --> 02:16:02,782
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't been in ages.

1924
02:16:03,122 --> 02:16:03,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1925
02:16:04,702 --> 02:16:05,663
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I was just in Reno.

1926
02:16:05,683 --> 02:16:06,603
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what they have in Reno?

1927
02:16:07,469 --> 02:16:16,112
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR1 Did you go to where your DDR cherry was popped?

1928
02:16:17,032 --> 02:16:35,619
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because that was in Vegas Oh, that's right, you were in Reno I was at the Rocky Horror 25th Anniversary Convention the first time I played DDR We decided to say fuck it and we didn't go to shock treatment night But anyway, the story I really want to say In Reno, it's a huge bowling center I think it's like the National Bowling Did you go to Circus Circus?

1929
02:16:37,287 --> 02:16:38,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, oh yeah, that's where I saw DDR Supernova.

1930
02:16:38,947 --> 02:16:39,488
[SPEAKER_02]: But bowling!

1931
02:16:39,768 --> 02:16:40,668
[SPEAKER_02]: National, oh, forget it.

1932
02:16:41,848 --> 02:16:43,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they still have the Daytona machines there?

1933
02:16:43,469 --> 02:16:45,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they had like a ton of Daytona machines.

1934
02:16:45,349 --> 02:16:49,830
[SPEAKER_02]: No, actually, truth be told, Circus Circus, sad.

1935
02:16:50,090 --> 02:16:53,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because it's the same thing that happened to every other arcade.

1936
02:16:53,191 --> 02:16:53,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Ticket machines.

1937
02:16:54,291 --> 02:16:56,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Ticket machines, ticket machines, ticket machines, ticket machines.

1938
02:16:56,732 --> 02:16:57,252
[SPEAKER_02]: And just like...

1939
02:16:58,132 --> 02:17:01,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like DarkTetsuya said about Country Club Lanes, which we haven't been to in forever.

1940
02:17:01,214 --> 02:17:03,735
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTetsuya said, yeah, no DDR there anymore.

1941
02:17:03,915 --> 02:17:06,036
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

1942
02:17:06,416 --> 02:17:12,240
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTetsuya says, now it's all Dave and Buster style games like the Pac-Man Battle Royale and Faster Than Light or whatever that ticket game is.

1943
02:17:12,380 --> 02:17:12,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Lame.

1944
02:17:13,240 --> 02:17:17,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'd hope they'd at least gotten DDR, X2, but X3... Or X2 or X3, but alas.

1945
02:17:17,683 --> 02:17:22,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Circus Circus, the only thing I caught, there was a driving game, and I don't even remember which one it was.

1946
02:17:22,887 --> 02:17:26,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one of the flashy... It wasn't like initial D or anything.

1947
02:17:26,470 --> 02:17:27,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was like...

1948
02:17:28,331 --> 02:17:30,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Have they made a racing game out of Fast and Furious?

1949
02:17:30,193 --> 02:17:30,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1950
02:17:30,493 --> 02:17:31,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was that.

1951
02:17:31,334 --> 02:17:34,656
[SPEAKER_10]: The Fast and Furious games are very similar to Cruisin'.

1952
02:17:34,756 --> 02:17:35,497
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the same.

1953
02:17:35,557 --> 02:17:36,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't we have Sugar Rush?

1954
02:17:36,898 --> 02:17:38,599
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that and DDR.

1955
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:42,002
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rest, ticket games, claw machines.

1956
02:17:42,723 --> 02:17:46,366
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Circus Circus, the casinos have the whole carnival barkers and those games.

1957
02:17:46,706 --> 02:17:48,948
[SPEAKER_02]: That's still one of the few places you see that, too.

1958
02:17:49,128 --> 02:17:53,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, now so many places have automated games.

1959
02:17:53,351 --> 02:17:55,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Horsey Races and all that stuff.

1960
02:17:55,092 --> 02:18:01,836
[SPEAKER_10]: They may have buried them back in the arcades because their arcades kind of go in some subterranean caverns and crap back there.

1961
02:18:01,956 --> 02:18:02,476
[SPEAKER_02]: We looked.

1962
02:18:02,536 --> 02:18:05,898
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a whole little... Now, granted, it was really crowded when we were there, which is weird.

1963
02:18:05,918 --> 02:18:06,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was weird.

1964
02:18:06,919 --> 02:18:07,939
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Saturday night.

1965
02:18:10,043 --> 02:18:12,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Silver Legacy has theirs tucked away in the Child Care Center.

1966
02:18:12,886 --> 02:18:18,552
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who had more arcade games was my favorite ghetto as fuck casino in the world.

1967
02:18:18,592 --> 02:18:22,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this place, Calneva, which is on the strip in Reno.

1968
02:18:24,198 --> 02:18:25,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I just said Reno has a strip.

1969
02:18:26,780 --> 02:18:28,161
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so pathetic compared to Vegas.

1970
02:18:28,241 --> 02:18:31,183
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does have a strip, and the Cal Neva is there.

1971
02:18:31,684 --> 02:18:34,886
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love the Cal Neva because it's just so ghetto.

1972
02:18:35,146 --> 02:18:42,851
[SPEAKER_02]: And because there's no more Fitzgerald's or Virginian, there's got to be a ghetto casino that holds that down.

1973
02:18:43,231 --> 02:18:44,892
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Cal Neva really takes the cake.

1974
02:18:44,932 --> 02:18:47,454
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the second floor, they have arcade games.

1975
02:18:47,874 --> 02:18:51,957
[SPEAKER_02]: But they don't have really a lot of ticket spitters, probably because they can't pay somebody to run a ticket counter.

1976
02:18:52,277 --> 02:18:56,060
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have old-ass recycled arcade games up there on the second floor.

1977
02:18:56,540 --> 02:18:59,462
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was pretty, like a Neo Geo machine and that type of stuff.

1978
02:18:59,782 --> 02:19:00,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1979
02:19:01,724 --> 02:19:01,924
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1980
02:19:03,125 --> 02:19:03,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

1981
02:19:06,107 --> 02:19:06,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

1982
02:19:08,028 --> 02:19:10,470
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, was that the arcade in The Wizard?

1983
02:19:10,970 --> 02:19:11,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

1984
02:19:12,652 --> 02:19:13,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Might have been.

1985
02:19:14,073 --> 02:19:15,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I want to go look that up.

1986
02:19:15,053 --> 02:19:16,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they go to Reno in The Wizard?

1987
02:19:16,374 --> 02:19:16,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they did.

1988
02:19:18,175 --> 02:19:18,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit.

1989
02:19:18,896 --> 02:19:20,397
[SPEAKER_02]: He touched my breast!

1990
02:19:20,477 --> 02:19:20,857
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1991
02:19:21,177 --> 02:19:22,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was Vegas for some reason.

1992
02:19:22,498 --> 02:19:23,099
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was Reno.

1993
02:19:23,119 --> 02:19:23,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

1994
02:19:24,158 --> 02:19:26,500
[SPEAKER_02]: The only movie I associate with Reno is Sister Act.

1995
02:19:28,682 --> 02:19:30,223
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Reno and Gamora.

1996
02:19:31,584 --> 02:19:31,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.

1997
02:19:32,005 --> 02:19:35,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Reno, it's time for the FUs of the week, everybody.

1998
02:19:37,389 --> 02:19:38,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the FU of the week music?

1999
02:19:38,350 --> 02:19:38,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.

2000
02:19:42,093 --> 02:19:43,474
[SPEAKER_10]: We need new music.

2001
02:19:43,555 --> 02:19:46,177
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll help you get on that.

2002
02:19:46,197 --> 02:19:48,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get on that.

2003
02:19:48,219 --> 02:19:48,659
[SPEAKER_10]: I tried.

2004
02:19:48,719 --> 02:19:49,900
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't work out very well.

2005
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:50,641
[SPEAKER_02]: FU of the week music.

2006
02:19:53,288 --> 02:19:54,530
[SPEAKER_02]: So 500 is going to come up.

2007
02:19:54,550 --> 02:19:56,672
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still going to have that same intro from seven years ago.

2008
02:19:56,932 --> 02:19:59,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that, I mean, Midi Head did a great job.

2009
02:19:59,235 --> 02:20:01,818
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great, but you know, seven years.

2010
02:20:01,979 --> 02:20:05,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Midi Head, if you're still listening to us, make us a new one, please.

2011
02:20:05,683 --> 02:20:06,104
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't scream.

2012
02:20:08,274 --> 02:20:09,515
[SPEAKER_02]: FU's the week time, DarkSakura.

2013
02:20:09,855 --> 02:20:10,495
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2014
02:20:12,156 --> 02:20:18,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess FU to not having a job now, but at the same time not having my old job is awesome.

2015
02:20:19,801 --> 02:20:22,342
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess that's good.

2016
02:20:24,143 --> 02:20:25,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm done.

2017
02:20:26,900 --> 02:20:27,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

2018
02:20:27,940 --> 02:20:31,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, F you to drivers making right turns.

2019
02:20:31,221 --> 02:20:35,003
[SPEAKER_10]: For some reason, people cannot make a right turn fast enough for my satisfaction.

2020
02:20:35,563 --> 02:20:37,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, they will slow down to, like, no speed at all.

2021
02:20:38,084 --> 02:20:40,304
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand why it's so hard to make a right turn.

2022
02:20:41,105 --> 02:20:44,126
[SPEAKER_10]: And to this dick, like, I don't know what it was.

2023
02:20:44,506 --> 02:20:51,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Some guy coming off the freeway today and, like, went across five lanes, no signaling whatsoever.

2024
02:20:51,428 --> 02:20:53,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, but managed to signal during his left turn.

2025
02:20:54,129 --> 02:20:57,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, actually in the middle of his turn, he flipped on his signal for no apparent reason.

2026
02:20:58,030 --> 02:21:02,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Stupid kid driver.

2027
02:21:02,812 --> 02:21:06,794
[SPEAKER_02]: My FU of the week goes to Chain Requirements on IAD.

2028
02:21:08,014 --> 02:21:08,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Nuff said.

2029
02:21:10,635 --> 02:21:12,296
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm looking at Wikipedia.

2030
02:21:13,601 --> 02:21:19,362
[SPEAKER_02]: They finally arrive in Reno, where it is revealed that Hayley wants her share of the prize money to help her father buy a house.

2031
02:21:19,782 --> 02:21:29,424
[SPEAKER_02]: With the help of an acquaintance trucker, they use the money won at craps tables to train Jimmy on several games in the Reno arcades using Nintendo PlayChoice 10 machines.

2032
02:21:31,104 --> 02:21:32,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that was... I need to find that scene.

2033
02:21:34,245 --> 02:21:34,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Online somewhere.

2034
02:21:34,925 --> 02:21:39,906
[SPEAKER_02]: But which... They don't say on wiki what... It may have been a set, so that's why.

2035
02:21:40,046 --> 02:21:41,046
[SPEAKER_02]: It may have been a set.

2036
02:21:41,126 --> 02:21:42,246
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually a very good point.

2037
02:21:44,046 --> 02:21:44,586
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, anyhow.

2038
02:21:45,447 --> 02:21:45,787
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2039
02:21:47,148 --> 02:21:50,089
[SPEAKER_10]: So Blockbuster is closing more stores, which is kind of bad.

2040
02:21:50,769 --> 02:21:52,650
[SPEAKER_10]: They're closing another 300 stores in the U.S.

2041
02:21:52,690 --> 02:21:52,810
[SPEAKER_10]: here.

2042
02:21:52,830 --> 02:21:55,832
[SPEAKER_10]: They just closed another 160 in the U.K.

2043
02:21:55,892 --> 02:21:58,373
[SPEAKER_10]: where they've recently filed bankruptcy there.

2044
02:21:59,213 --> 02:22:04,316
[SPEAKER_10]: And that brings them down to a total of 500 stores in the States and 500 stores in the U.K.

2045
02:22:04,976 --> 02:22:10,719
[SPEAKER_10]: What is kind of unique and not something that's actually reported on this article here and something I've got to know a little bit of information on is

2046
02:22:11,109 --> 02:22:11,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Game Retail

2047
02:22:25,111 --> 02:22:31,034
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I was on the call I was on to this week.

2048
02:22:31,655 --> 02:22:33,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they'll pick up your copy of MLB.

2049
02:22:34,176 --> 02:22:35,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, not MLB because it's too late for that.

2050
02:22:35,997 --> 02:22:36,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Bioshock, though.

2051
02:22:36,717 --> 02:22:37,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Bioshock Infinite.

2052
02:22:37,378 --> 02:22:41,140
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll be able to pick up your local blockbuster if you are ever so inclined.

2053
02:22:43,501 --> 02:22:45,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Very important research I need to do here live on this show.

2054
02:22:46,023 --> 02:22:47,683
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very, very, very important.

2055
02:22:48,324 --> 02:22:51,626
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, what is that guy in the background?

2056
02:22:51,646 --> 02:22:51,726
What?

2057
02:22:53,561 --> 02:22:54,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, hold on.

2058
02:22:54,041 --> 02:22:55,422
[SPEAKER_02]: No one wears that.

2059
02:22:56,182 --> 02:22:57,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wears Speedos in public.

2060
02:22:57,802 --> 02:23:09,306
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, hold on.

2061
02:23:09,326 --> 02:23:09,606
Hallie!

2062
02:23:09,666 --> 02:23:11,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Got you, Jimmy boy.

2063
02:23:12,087 --> 02:23:13,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Time to go home, son.

2064
02:23:14,007 --> 02:23:17,528
[SPEAKER_03]: We're too late.

2065
02:23:18,188 --> 02:23:20,229
[SPEAKER_03]: He touched me!

2066
02:23:24,252 --> 02:23:25,332
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not the Calnava.

2067
02:23:25,933 --> 02:23:27,733
[SPEAKER_02]: The arcade at the Calnava is on the second floor.

2068
02:23:28,394 --> 02:23:29,734
[SPEAKER_02]: That does look like a Hollywood stage.

2069
02:23:30,074 --> 02:23:31,015
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably where that was filmed.

2070
02:23:31,475 --> 02:23:32,475
[SPEAKER_02]: They might have just said it was that.

2071
02:23:33,456 --> 02:23:36,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, very important question we had to answer.

2072
02:23:38,618 --> 02:23:39,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that was crucial.

2073
02:23:40,359 --> 02:23:43,960
[SPEAKER_02]: I could not continue the show until I knew if that was the Calnava or not.

2074
02:23:45,981 --> 02:23:48,062
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if she's used that line before.

2075
02:23:48,522 --> 02:23:50,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, now that she's grown up a bit.

2076
02:23:55,307 --> 02:23:58,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Shane Alinko in our chatroom says, Jimmy grew up to be super hot.

2077
02:24:01,994 --> 02:24:02,754
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, moving on.

2078
02:24:03,415 --> 02:24:09,081
[SPEAKER_02]: One last story for you guys tonight, and this has to do with an arcade beat-em-up game coming to Facebook.

2079
02:24:09,521 --> 02:24:13,545
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently it's turning some heads because it is a console-quality game.

2080
02:24:13,825 --> 02:24:18,070
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when we think of Facebook games, we don't think of a lot of really great games where it's, you know...

2081
02:24:18,550 --> 02:24:21,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Click for and then give me money for more energy pills.

2082
02:24:21,572 --> 02:24:23,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's just not a lot of great, great games on Facebook.

2083
02:24:24,194 --> 02:24:35,482
[SPEAKER_02]: The only one that I think a lot of console and PC gamers will give any cred to is maybe like You Don't Know Jack, you know, because it's, you know, that kind of gets a little bit of a break.

2084
02:24:35,882 --> 02:25:00,948
[SPEAKER_02]: But not a lot of hardcore stuff on Facebook Well, I don't know if you guys knew about this But there's a new developer, N-Way And this is a San Francisco-based company They were founded in 2011 It was founded by game industry veterans And their sole purpose is console-quality multiplayer games To the web and mobile platforms David Jones is with this studio He was the founder of DMA Designs Wasn't he a monkey?

2085
02:25:01,308 --> 02:25:04,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's now Rockstar North He created Lemmings

2086
02:25:05,969 --> 02:25:08,892
[SPEAKER_02]: and the original 2D Grand Theft Auto.

2087
02:25:09,072 --> 02:25:12,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Stig Hedlund, who was the lead designer in the first two entries for Diablo.

2088
02:25:13,457 --> 02:25:22,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Chronoblade is the game that they've put together, which if you actually look at some of the screenshots, I'm like, that does kind of look like Diablo, but more of like a...

2089
02:25:23,366 --> 02:25:25,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, not like that same type of perspective.

2090
02:25:25,489 --> 02:25:37,342
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks a little more, I don't want to say hack and slash because that is kind of Diablo, but you see, it looks like there's the red orb and the blue orb and, you know, there is definitely, I mean, I look at this and I go, oh, this is like an Xbox Live Arcade game, right?

2091
02:25:37,362 --> 02:25:38,043
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2092
02:25:38,263 --> 02:25:40,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, apparently it is something that is on Facebook.

2093
02:25:41,186 --> 02:25:48,353
[SPEAKER_02]: They're calling it an arcade-style brawler, and it apparently is going to be very similar to Diablo.

2094
02:25:49,074 --> 02:25:55,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Chrono Blade exists in a series of parallel worlds that will band together to fight against a common foe.

2095
02:25:56,342 --> 02:26:01,287
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm assuming this means maybe the parallel universes is how you interact with your friends?

2096
02:26:01,847 --> 02:26:09,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but they also say this is a way to have a Viking-themed world and steampunk world and kind of cross all these areas together.

2097
02:26:09,769 --> 02:26:10,549
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty cool.

2098
02:26:11,229 --> 02:26:16,430
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be completely free to play, and there is a beta sign-up website if you want to check that out.

2099
02:26:16,490 --> 02:26:19,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this will be the Facebook game that it will be okay to like.

2100
02:26:20,891 --> 02:26:21,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

2101
02:26:23,431 --> 02:26:23,851
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

2102
02:26:25,371 --> 02:26:27,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you play a game like that, even though it's on Facebook?

2103
02:26:28,277 --> 02:26:28,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki?

2104
02:26:29,018 --> 02:26:29,178
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

2105
02:26:29,558 --> 02:26:29,698
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

2106
02:26:30,819 --> 02:26:31,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, fair enough.

2107
02:26:31,340 --> 02:26:32,281
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't Facebook game.

2108
02:26:32,741 --> 02:26:34,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I hear you.

2109
02:26:34,803 --> 02:26:45,172
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call and we'll take your calls here on the show for a few minutes here and whatever you want to talk about tonight.

2110
02:26:45,633 --> 02:26:48,175
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want us to watch more scenes from The Wizard, we can do that too.

2111
02:26:48,335 --> 02:26:48,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Just let us know.

2112
02:26:49,476 --> 02:26:50,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll queue it up.

2113
02:26:50,097 --> 02:26:50,757
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds fun.

2114
02:26:51,038 --> 02:26:51,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2115
02:26:51,818 --> 02:26:54,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe for each caller tonight I will play a new scene from The Wizard.

2116
02:26:56,123 --> 02:26:57,024
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2117
02:26:57,685 --> 02:27:00,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, do you have any last-minute news stories while we wait for those calls to come in?

2118
02:27:00,287 --> 02:27:04,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, that's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2119
02:27:06,031 --> 02:27:08,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently there is a company, Team Pixel.

2120
02:27:08,954 --> 02:27:10,455
[SPEAKER_10]: They're an independent company.

2121
02:27:10,575 --> 02:27:15,739
[SPEAKER_10]: They are crowdfunding to buy THQ's Homeworld IP.

2122
02:27:16,740 --> 02:27:20,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently they are trying to raise, I guess...

2123
02:27:21,984 --> 02:27:28,930
[SPEAKER_10]: $50,000 by February 7th in order to acquire the property to make another Homeworld game.

2124
02:27:29,570 --> 02:27:30,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to the phones.

2125
02:27:30,251 --> 02:27:31,071
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a call coming in.

2126
02:27:31,492 --> 02:27:32,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2127
02:27:32,572 --> 02:27:32,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2128
02:27:33,769 --> 02:27:35,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it is me, one named Jason.

2129
02:27:35,789 --> 02:27:37,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Jason, long time no see.

2130
02:27:37,430 --> 02:27:37,850
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

2131
02:27:38,450 --> 02:27:39,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, a terribly long time.

2132
02:27:39,890 --> 02:27:41,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but you're back in Colorado now.

2133
02:27:42,011 --> 02:27:50,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I am back in Colorado after a seven-hour train delay that got me in town at one o'clock in the morning and was kind of garbage by the end of it.

2134
02:27:51,333 --> 02:27:55,834
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that you're back in Colorado, how was it to hear me bitch about one inch of snow ruining my day?

2135
02:27:57,214 --> 02:28:04,779
[SPEAKER_08]: I chuckled but I also kind of, I know exactly how you feel because when I first went out to California in March, St.

2136
02:28:04,799 --> 02:28:20,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Patrick's Day weekend, it was snowing over the Sierra Nevada and the bus that I was on had to throw on chains or some other, you know, whatever a vehicle of that size has to use and go like 25 miles an hour over Donner Pass and that whole bus ride was just garbage.

2137
02:28:21,380 --> 02:28:22,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you, Jason.

2138
02:28:22,200 --> 02:28:24,502
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a true friend, making the listeners understand my pain.

2139
02:28:24,582 --> 02:28:26,663
[SPEAKER_02]: So what did you really want to call in to talk about tonight?

2140
02:28:27,443 --> 02:28:28,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kind of an idle thought.

2141
02:28:28,844 --> 02:28:36,949
[SPEAKER_08]: When I was listening to you talk about your trip to Reno, a co-worker mentioned something to me a couple of months ago, something along those lines.

2142
02:28:37,449 --> 02:28:44,093
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said that it was a sad day when he realized that audio – musical hardware companies –

2143
02:28:45,013 --> 02:28:53,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Produce things predominantly for churches and broadcast and not like musicians and clubs and studios or anything like that.

2144
02:28:54,700 --> 02:29:05,648
[SPEAKER_08]: And so he started to get to explaining how as churches crop up and start having recordings and even if you know of churches that broadcast on the local stations over the air in the area...

2145
02:29:06,948 --> 02:29:29,305
[SPEAKER_08]: and I had thought about a church that I used to go to when I was really young and I remember being in the production studio and seeing all of those screens, this gigantic mixer, all of the audio coming out of these ridiculously powerful speakers for recording an orchestra, the preacher and whatever else that they have going on.

2146
02:29:29,545 --> 02:29:30,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see that.

2147
02:29:30,426 --> 02:29:34,048
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's a lot of television around the church program and so forth.

2148
02:29:34,088 --> 02:29:36,090
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I always associate church in my mind.

2149
02:29:36,450 --> 02:29:39,312
[SPEAKER_02]: The church I went to when I was younger was a very small place.

2150
02:29:39,953 --> 02:29:44,776
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the whole freaking place could probably hold maybe, maybe 80 people.

2151
02:29:45,097 --> 02:29:47,358
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so there was nothing like what you're talking about.

2152
02:29:47,398 --> 02:29:53,343
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know there's other churches like, you know, you get these mega churches that are like, you know, that it's like going to a rock concert.

2153
02:29:53,463 --> 02:29:57,206
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they called my church when I lived in Alabama, Six Flags Over Jesus.

2154
02:29:59,197 --> 02:30:02,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, go to Google Maps and look up Dauphin Way Baptist Church.

2155
02:30:02,579 --> 02:30:03,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know.

2156
02:30:03,800 --> 02:30:07,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Texas has some just like some churches buy arenas.

2157
02:30:08,323 --> 02:30:08,984
[SPEAKER_02]: They are that big.

2158
02:30:09,184 --> 02:30:10,144
[SPEAKER_05]: We built an arena.

2159
02:30:10,305 --> 02:30:14,747
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, no, I told like now that you're saying this, I'm like, yeah, that makes sense.

2160
02:30:14,787 --> 02:30:16,749
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is kind of an interesting parallel, too.

2161
02:30:16,789 --> 02:30:27,636
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm assuming that's the parallel you're making, too, is that a lot of stuff that maybe we get in gaming might have been developed for, you know, lounge gaming or whatever you want to call it, casino gaming.

2162
02:30:28,052 --> 02:30:28,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, absolutely.

2163
02:30:28,712 --> 02:30:42,757
[SPEAKER_08]: And you already laid all of it out when you were talking about it because, sure, the DS is a tiny screen and has two screen depth 3D, but you were just talking about, and I saw the picture too, a four screen, I don't know, how big was that, would you say, 150 inch screen?

2164
02:30:44,438 --> 02:30:45,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that is gigantic.

2165
02:30:45,899 --> 02:30:46,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, probably.

2166
02:30:46,959 --> 02:30:51,801
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it had enough space so that you had, I think, four... You saw Alan post on his Facebook, right?

2167
02:30:51,821 --> 02:30:55,622
[SPEAKER_02]: It had room for at least, I think, six people to sit.

2168
02:30:56,043 --> 02:30:56,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2169
02:30:57,243 --> 02:30:59,704
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was one edge of the screen to the other.

2170
02:30:59,864 --> 02:31:02,725
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like those fancy chairs that vibrate.

2171
02:31:02,745 --> 02:31:05,546
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel the bass in your ass if you hit the jackpot.

2172
02:31:05,967 --> 02:31:06,247
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's...

2173
02:31:07,347 --> 02:31:09,950
[SPEAKER_08]: That's gotta be one fun share to sit in when you get a jackpot.

2174
02:31:10,050 --> 02:31:12,732
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Sex and the City game, for fuck's sake.

2175
02:31:13,293 --> 02:31:14,614
[SPEAKER_08]: And that only makes it even better.

2176
02:31:14,634 --> 02:31:15,675
[SPEAKER_08]: That explains everything.

2177
02:31:15,695 --> 02:31:17,757
[SPEAKER_02]: That is... Oh my god.

2178
02:31:18,398 --> 02:31:19,799
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the part that blew me away.

2179
02:31:20,059 --> 02:31:21,100
[SPEAKER_10]: This game is orgasmic.

2180
02:31:21,120 --> 02:31:21,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

2181
02:31:21,801 --> 02:31:22,121
[SPEAKER_02]: This?

2182
02:31:22,562 --> 02:31:23,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, deal or no deal?

2183
02:31:24,263 --> 02:31:24,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I get that.

2184
02:31:24,884 --> 02:31:25,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Wheel of Fortune?

2185
02:31:25,985 --> 02:31:26,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I get that.

2186
02:31:27,066 --> 02:31:27,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Sex and the City?

2187
02:31:28,827 --> 02:31:29,068
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2188
02:31:32,249 --> 02:31:39,392
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, there's a lot of little old ladies that love Sex and the City and they love Reno, so I guess it does make sense.

2189
02:31:39,832 --> 02:31:51,617
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of people, I remember CES both this and last year, I believe, that people, they scoff about the 100-inch TVs and the life-size TVs and everything else like that.

2190
02:31:51,657 --> 02:31:54,539
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, oh yeah, Bill Gates is going to have three of these in his house.

2191
02:31:56,059 --> 02:32:18,249
[SPEAKER_08]: I have, the Red Robin closest to me has an 80 inch TV in one of the dining areas and it's mighty impressive to look at but it's there's certainly application for all of this stuff that you wouldn't imagine would be the result after seeing it shown off and the fact that they really do advertise it to everybody and the best and most rich people pick them up rich companies rather

2192
02:32:19,429 --> 02:32:25,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good point is that we often forget about the many commercial uses of this stuff.

2193
02:32:25,513 --> 02:32:33,458
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there is a very large football game occurring next week that people are going to want to, you know, go to a bar together and watch.

2194
02:32:33,518 --> 02:32:38,842
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope that bar has one of these 100 screen TVs that they want to fit a lot of people in there and they can all get a good view of the game, you know.

2195
02:32:39,961 --> 02:32:43,022
[SPEAKER_08]: One very small related note that I figured I would talk about.

2196
02:32:44,862 --> 02:32:54,505
[SPEAKER_08]: I read something a while ago about corporate parties and big conventions, notably like, for example, the Democratic and Republican National Conventions.

2197
02:32:54,805 --> 02:33:04,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Rentals for these kind of items don't really exist, so they buy up these huge gobs of resources, of digital resources, and I've even heard stories about...

2198
02:33:05,682 --> 02:33:31,216
[SPEAKER_08]: and they sell that stuff off to recoup as much cost as possible dirt cheap so if you know anybody that puts together some kind of a party where they have to buy up expensive items keep talking to them after it wraps up because there's probably a good chance you'll get some serious deals on things if you live in a swing state that's likely to host one of these conventions in 2016 check Craigslist the next day that's what you're saying

2199
02:33:32,491 --> 02:33:37,953
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know that they... I'm pretty sure there's a lot of legislation that tries to go in about along Craigslist, but you never know.

2200
02:33:37,973 --> 02:33:42,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe a staffer got their hands on something and, oh, sure, I'll buy it and throw it in the till.

2201
02:33:42,155 --> 02:33:42,975
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it could happen.

2202
02:33:43,375 --> 02:33:48,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me, you never know, because you're not... The Democratic and Republican parties aren't technically a part of the government.

2203
02:33:48,957 --> 02:33:50,397
[SPEAKER_02]: They're their own independent things.

2204
02:33:50,437 --> 02:33:57,520
[SPEAKER_02]: They can kind of... And trust me, as somebody who used to date a politician, it's... I used this word earlier and got yelled at for it, but I'm going to use it here.

2205
02:33:57,560 --> 02:33:59,921
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very interesting to see how all that works.

2206
02:34:01,281 --> 02:34:02,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, that's all I'll say.

2207
02:34:03,022 --> 02:34:04,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to ask you this before I let you go.

2208
02:34:05,002 --> 02:34:06,203
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this I'm seeing in chat?

2209
02:34:06,323 --> 02:34:08,104
[SPEAKER_02]: You still to this day have not seen The Wizard?

2210
02:34:08,744 --> 02:34:12,925
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I was wondering who was going to bring it up, but I didn't think it would be during this call.

2211
02:34:13,786 --> 02:34:15,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Surprise!

2212
02:34:15,546 --> 02:34:17,207
[SPEAKER_08]: The first answer is that me and movies.

2213
02:34:17,367 --> 02:34:19,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that looks interesting, and it's not in theaters anymore.

2214
02:34:19,768 --> 02:34:22,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that looks interesting, and it's not in theaters anymore.

2215
02:34:22,469 --> 02:34:25,210
[SPEAKER_08]: I really enjoy movies, and I really don't see very many of them.

2216
02:34:25,470 --> 02:34:26,250
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very strange.

2217
02:34:26,730 --> 02:34:52,539
[SPEAKER_08]: but I didn't even see um not Captain N oh the the Mario Brothers Super Show I didn't watch that until Ryan made me watch it like two years ago uh somehow I missed that in my youth and plenty of other of these fun little gaming things that everybody knows about except for me well all I have to say is you better set aside 90 minutes next time you're in the Bay Area I don't have a problem with that all right all right buddy I'm gonna let you go try and get another call in all right you have a good one thanks you too all right bye

2218
02:34:54,059 --> 02:34:59,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting, you know, that sometimes there's these uses for things that we don't always think about.

2219
02:34:59,322 --> 02:35:02,924
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very interesting, like the music DJ stuff.

2220
02:35:03,365 --> 02:35:05,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Churches are a big business for that.

2221
02:35:05,842 --> 02:35:06,803
[SPEAKER_05]: who would have thought of that?

2222
02:35:07,644 --> 02:35:33,084
[SPEAKER_05]: I always remembered we actually had a really again this was at the megachurch that I went to god thank god I'm not around that anymore but they had a whole full AV set up with like something I want to say like five different sound panels spotlights you name it and an orchestra pit I'm not joking wow good big stuff alright we got another call coming in so let's go to it hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

2223
02:35:33,869 --> 02:35:36,670
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Jim Sowie.

2224
02:35:36,730 --> 02:35:37,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Woo!

[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, buddy.

[SPEAKER_01]: Dude.

[SPEAKER_01]: Me.

2230
02:35:42,733 --> 02:35:44,674
[SPEAKER_01]: You got an interest to know when you're going to put chains on your tires?

2231
02:35:45,034 --> 02:35:45,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.

2232
02:35:45,894 --> 02:35:48,616
[SPEAKER_01]: I... Check the... For an interest to know?

2233
02:35:48,836 --> 02:35:51,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Google I-80 chain controls.

2234
02:35:51,157 --> 02:35:52,377
[SPEAKER_02]: This is public information.

2235
02:35:52,437 --> 02:35:53,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Google it from last night.

2236
02:35:53,758 --> 02:35:54,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear to God.

2237
02:35:54,438 --> 02:35:56,119
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not... I don't make the rules.

2238
02:35:56,199 --> 02:35:58,540
[SPEAKER_02]: The Highway Patrol or Caltrans or whoever does.

2239
02:35:59,020 --> 02:35:59,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's... Well...

2240
02:36:00,541 --> 02:36:01,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude Bros!

2241
02:36:16,943 --> 02:36:22,665
[SPEAKER_02]: crash their car, airbags deployed and everything, and scary stuff.

2242
02:36:22,745 --> 02:36:27,347
[SPEAKER_02]: So an inch of snow or not, it's how it kind of fucks with those roads.

2243
02:36:27,407 --> 02:36:31,948
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I want to remind you guys, you're going downhill for a big part of that.

2244
02:36:32,048 --> 02:36:33,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you cross Donner Summit, you're going downhill.

2245
02:36:34,429 --> 02:36:36,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I barely step on the gas driving home.

2246
02:36:38,370 --> 02:36:39,671
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, Rob.

2247
02:36:41,791 --> 02:36:43,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Two days ago, I got seven inches of snow.

2248
02:36:45,312 --> 02:36:50,734
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was, I'm not kidding you, it was minus 40 Celsius, which is like, I think minus 45 Fahrenheit.

2249
02:36:50,774 --> 02:36:52,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the cars wouldn't start, Rob.

2250
02:36:52,994 --> 02:36:53,934
[SPEAKER_01]: The cars would not start.

2251
02:36:54,375 --> 02:36:56,535
[SPEAKER_01]: The cars wouldn't start.

2252
02:36:56,935 --> 02:36:58,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Where in Canada do you live again?

2253
02:36:59,936 --> 02:37:03,397
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Elk Lake, so I am like, do you know where Detroit is?

2254
02:37:03,837 --> 02:37:04,877
[SPEAKER_01]: I know where Detroit is.

2255
02:37:05,458 --> 02:37:07,058
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 10 hours north of Buffalo.

2256
02:37:07,838 --> 02:37:08,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.

2257
02:37:08,778 --> 02:37:11,019
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where I live, buddy.

2258
02:37:11,039 --> 02:37:12,299
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 hours north of Buffalo.

2259
02:37:12,319 --> 02:37:14,100
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 hours north of Buffalo.

2260
02:37:16,377 --> 02:37:18,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I see this huge lake in Canada.

2261
02:37:18,918 --> 02:37:20,019
[SPEAKER_02]: So you live by this big lake?

2262
02:37:21,119 --> 02:37:22,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's the Montreal River.

2263
02:37:22,480 --> 02:37:24,500
[SPEAKER_01]: I live, the Montreal River goes right through my backyard.

2264
02:37:25,001 --> 02:37:25,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, okay.

2265
02:37:26,061 --> 02:37:28,882
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 100 feet from ice fishing right in Pickerel, buddy.

2266
02:37:29,222 --> 02:37:30,123
[SPEAKER_01]: I caught seven this morning.

2267
02:37:31,946 --> 02:37:33,527
[SPEAKER_01]: But listen, listen, forget about this.

2268
02:37:33,607 --> 02:37:38,450
[SPEAKER_01]: You were talking the other day before too about the craziest place that people have listened to Orange Lounge Radio.

2269
02:37:39,151 --> 02:37:42,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, like six years ago, I guess.

2270
02:37:42,173 --> 02:37:43,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, about six.

2271
02:37:43,653 --> 02:37:46,775
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you guys were on the old place.

2272
02:37:47,376 --> 02:37:49,657
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started listening to you guys.

2273
02:37:49,697 --> 02:37:51,919
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I worked at the sausage factory called Schneider's.

2274
02:37:52,439 --> 02:37:53,720
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was an elevator operator.

2275
02:37:53,740 --> 02:37:55,721
[SPEAKER_01]: I just moved the elevator up and down five floors.

2276
02:37:57,583 --> 02:37:58,423
[SPEAKER_01]: with meat on it.

2277
02:37:58,463 --> 02:37:59,224
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my job all day.

2278
02:37:59,664 --> 02:38:04,386
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Sunday nights when I could get away, I'd go to the top of the elevator where the little motor is and stuff.

2279
02:38:04,746 --> 02:38:12,569
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually had an Ethernet cord that I pulled through from the third floor up the fourth floor up the fifth floor into this room in an old, old 386 or Pentium II.

2280
02:38:13,069 --> 02:38:14,509
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an old computer.

2281
02:38:14,889 --> 02:38:19,271
[SPEAKER_01]: But I could just barely run fucking Winamp on it and I would listen to OLR for the last three hours of my shift.

2282
02:38:19,831 --> 02:38:20,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.

2283
02:38:21,092 --> 02:38:24,333
[SPEAKER_02]: We were in some empty ass elevator in the middle of Canada.

2284
02:38:24,353 --> 02:38:24,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2285
02:38:25,719 --> 02:38:29,348
[SPEAKER_01]: The top of a sausage factory At least it was the top of a sausage factory, right?

2286
02:38:29,508 --> 02:38:30,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow

2287
02:38:31,474 --> 02:38:41,196
[SPEAKER_01]: and that was it, that was my job every Sunday night because there was nothing to do Sunday night so the other shift would end at 7 but I would get paid to stay there till midnight because someone's got to be on the elevator like you know, fucking union jobs, right?

2288
02:38:41,576 --> 02:38:49,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, talking about the long Ethernet cable that makes me think of the year do you remember when we did the live DDR tournament in San Francisco?

2289
02:38:49,638 --> 02:39:00,280
[SPEAKER_02]: B3 or whatever it was called at Pier 39 we actually broadcast from Pier 39 it's one of our more like if we were to make a resume like the Orange Islands Radio resume that would be on there because you know, Pier 39 is a big touristy spot

2290
02:39:00,800 --> 02:39:05,225
[SPEAKER_02]: and we had to run, didn't we have to go to Radio Shack and buy like a 100 foot cable?

2291
02:39:05,325 --> 02:39:05,906
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

2292
02:39:05,926 --> 02:39:06,446
[SPEAKER_02]: To run it?

2293
02:39:06,887 --> 02:39:08,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I had to do too.

2294
02:39:08,428 --> 02:39:09,870
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to steal one from the IT department.

2295
02:39:09,930 --> 02:39:10,471
[SPEAKER_01]: God.

2296
02:39:11,852 --> 02:39:12,973
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.

2297
02:39:13,153 --> 02:39:17,618
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to go to maintenance and get like this drill, dude, the drill bit on this drill that the maintenance guy gave me was sick.

2298
02:39:18,079 --> 02:39:19,220
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like two and a half feet long.

2299
02:39:20,051 --> 02:39:21,532
[SPEAKER_01]: with a big brick bit on it.

2300
02:39:21,612 --> 02:39:22,953
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, where can I drill it?

2301
02:39:23,573 --> 02:39:24,574
[SPEAKER_02]: But now how does it feel?

2302
02:39:24,614 --> 02:39:25,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Anywhere you want.

2303
02:39:25,835 --> 02:39:26,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't hit a wire.

2304
02:39:27,596 --> 02:39:33,079
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel knowing now, like six years later, like no problem, just bring up the iPhone?

2305
02:39:33,339 --> 02:39:34,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know, right?

2306
02:39:34,520 --> 02:39:37,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what kind of coverage you have up there, but I mean, even if on 3G.

2307
02:39:38,042 --> 02:39:38,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent coverage.

2308
02:39:38,923 --> 02:39:39,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, then you can.

2309
02:39:40,343 --> 02:39:41,244
[SPEAKER_01]: We have DSL.

2310
02:39:41,264 --> 02:39:45,467
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the same DSL that I had when I lived down south, but there's 500 people in my town, so it never slows down.

2311
02:39:45,687 --> 02:39:46,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my gosh.

2312
02:39:46,767 --> 02:39:47,468
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no tweeners.

2313
02:39:48,689 --> 02:39:53,893
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to the elementary school, there's 12 kids, I think, from the ages of 10 to 16 in the entire town.

2314
02:39:55,054 --> 02:39:55,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, boy, oh, boy.

2315
02:39:55,975 --> 02:39:57,556
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so right away.

2316
02:39:57,916 --> 02:39:58,757
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different life.

2317
02:39:58,777 --> 02:40:02,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Jim, you've thrown the gauntlet, and I love what SSJ100Matt is suggesting in chat.

2318
02:40:03,280 --> 02:40:05,081
[SPEAKER_02]: We should have this topic as a foogle question.

2319
02:40:05,141 --> 02:40:07,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Strangest place you've listened to OLR.

2320
02:40:07,803 --> 02:40:09,484
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a hell of a way to— Good luck, people.

2321
02:40:09,705 --> 02:40:11,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm curious.

2322
02:40:11,366 --> 02:40:14,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's going to be the top of an elevator at a sausage factory?

2323
02:40:15,058 --> 02:40:15,438
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

2324
02:40:15,458 --> 02:40:19,120
[SPEAKER_01]: With a 100-foot Ethernet cord going downstairs to a manager's office that I had to break into.

2325
02:40:19,420 --> 02:40:25,642
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to break into a manager's office and install a router so that I could take the cord out of the back of his computer and stick it in the little router bridge thing.

2326
02:40:25,702 --> 02:40:26,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, you know what I'm talking about.

2327
02:40:27,203 --> 02:40:29,984
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to stick the other cord in because you can't just stick the two cords together.

2328
02:40:30,324 --> 02:40:30,885
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

2329
02:40:31,045 --> 02:40:33,065
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to have a little router thing in the middle.

2330
02:40:33,306 --> 02:40:34,066
[SPEAKER_02]: You're hardcore, Jim.

2331
02:40:34,086 --> 02:40:34,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.

2332
02:40:35,086 --> 02:40:36,847
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hardcore.

2333
02:40:37,067 --> 02:40:37,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't take this the wrong way.

2334
02:40:37,727 --> 02:40:41,389
[SPEAKER_01]: I was desperate to listen to anything besides Canadian radio.

2335
02:40:41,989 --> 02:40:44,410
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know any more Canadian radio.

2336
02:40:44,870 --> 02:40:46,891
[SPEAKER_01]: And ever since then, Rob, I've been in love with you, man.

2337
02:40:47,271 --> 02:40:48,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it all Atlantis and Rush?

2338
02:40:48,592 --> 02:40:50,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, shucks.

2339
02:40:50,352 --> 02:40:53,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I think about packing sausage, Rob, I think of you.

2340
02:40:56,515 --> 02:40:59,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the only sausage factory I think of is a place in the Castro.

2341
02:40:59,656 --> 02:41:00,316
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not what you think.

2342
02:41:00,356 --> 02:41:01,757
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually an Italian restaurant.

2343
02:41:01,777 --> 02:41:05,478
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's funny because when you talk about the sausage factory, I'm like, oh, it's a yummy restaurant in the Castro.

2344
02:41:05,778 --> 02:41:07,959
[SPEAKER_05]: The Castro is like the gayest part of San Francisco.

2345
02:41:08,259 --> 02:41:08,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2346
02:41:09,760 --> 02:41:10,320
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway.

2347
02:41:11,060 --> 02:41:12,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Jim, I'm going to let you go.

2348
02:41:12,422 --> 02:41:21,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I let you go, I'm just going to say, in my defense about the whole one-inch-a-snow thing, come to my neck of the woods sometimes and get through a 105-degree summer.

2349
02:41:23,613 --> 02:41:26,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm looking for two plane tickets now.

2350
02:41:26,476 --> 02:41:27,738
[SPEAKER_01]: I can use it.

2351
02:41:27,758 --> 02:41:28,258
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll melt.

2352
02:41:28,538 --> 02:41:28,899
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll melt.

2353
02:41:28,919 --> 02:41:29,139
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2354
02:41:29,559 --> 02:41:31,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Jim, buddy, have a good one, and thanks for the story.

2355
02:41:31,281 --> 02:41:31,742
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great.

2356
02:41:32,321 --> 02:41:32,922
[SPEAKER_01]: You too, guys.

2357
02:41:32,942 --> 02:41:33,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone be safe, okay?

2358
02:41:34,164 --> 02:41:34,484
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

2359
02:41:34,524 --> 02:41:34,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

2360
02:41:34,885 --> 02:41:35,405
[SPEAKER_01]: You too.

2361
02:41:35,565 --> 02:41:36,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget.

2362
02:41:36,186 --> 02:41:36,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget, okay?

2363
02:41:36,947 --> 02:41:39,010
[SPEAKER_01]: This is winter driving safety tip, okay?

2364
02:41:39,250 --> 02:41:39,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

2365
02:41:40,152 --> 02:41:45,920
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going up a hill and your tires start to spin, you're giving it too much gas or not enough.

2366
02:41:48,163 --> 02:41:49,004
[SPEAKER_02]: What a helpful tip.

2367
02:41:50,754 --> 02:41:51,755
[SPEAKER_02]: and he hung up on that.

2368
02:41:53,236 --> 02:41:53,716
[SPEAKER_02]: You jerk.

2369
02:41:53,916 --> 02:41:54,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did you find that?

2370
02:41:56,117 --> 02:41:57,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Very important Alan question.

2371
02:41:57,258 --> 02:41:57,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did you find that?

2372
02:41:58,359 --> 02:42:02,261
[SPEAKER_07]: It was on the nice leather recliner but under a Snuggie.

2373
02:42:03,081 --> 02:42:05,363
[SPEAKER_02]: We couldn't find the fourth microphone for Alan tonight.

2374
02:42:05,783 --> 02:42:07,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently it was under a Snuggie.

2375
02:42:08,785 --> 02:42:09,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knew?

2376
02:42:09,886 --> 02:42:10,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of cold.

2377
02:42:13,004 --> 02:42:15,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, how many Snuggies do you have to wear for minus 40?

2378
02:42:15,469 --> 02:42:18,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that like five layers of Snuggies?

2379
02:42:18,394 --> 02:42:18,975
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2380
02:42:19,015 --> 02:42:21,600
[SPEAKER_10]: I think your body just gets used to it at some point, you know?

2381
02:42:22,031 --> 02:42:23,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it gets used to it when you're dead.

2382
02:42:24,132 --> 02:42:24,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop it.

2383
02:42:24,692 --> 02:42:25,773
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's go to the phones.

2384
02:42:25,813 --> 02:42:26,673
[SPEAKER_02]: We have another call coming in.

2385
02:42:26,693 --> 02:42:27,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2386
02:42:27,634 --> 02:42:27,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2387
02:42:28,675 --> 02:42:30,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma.

2388
02:42:30,415 --> 02:42:32,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey, hey, what's up, Ranma?

2389
02:42:32,937 --> 02:42:33,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, not much.

2390
02:42:35,198 --> 02:42:37,019
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in a bit of a pissy mood.

2391
02:42:37,039 --> 02:42:38,139
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to vent.

2392
02:42:38,860 --> 02:42:39,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, please.

2393
02:42:40,301 --> 02:42:43,122
[SPEAKER_02]: When I think of where do I want to vent, I think of Orange Launch Radio.

2394
02:42:43,222 --> 02:42:44,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, by all means, the stage is yours.

2395
02:42:45,868 --> 02:42:49,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, every morning, part of my normal routine, I read the paper.

2396
02:42:49,291 --> 02:42:52,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Until I get to a certain point in the paper, I put it down and go about my business.

2397
02:42:53,274 --> 02:42:56,436
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I'm reading the editorials like I usually do.

2398
02:42:56,717 --> 02:42:58,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I see something here in the paper?

2399
02:42:59,118 --> 02:43:01,881
[SPEAKER_09]: I swear to you, I have never seen before.

2400
02:43:02,901 --> 02:43:04,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a bad feeling I know where this is going.

2401
02:43:04,703 --> 02:43:05,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for it.

2402
02:43:05,664 --> 02:43:06,024
[SPEAKER_09]: You!

2403
02:43:07,185 --> 02:43:10,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming off of what we explored on our podcast last week?

2404
02:43:10,648 --> 02:43:10,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh!

2405
02:43:10,748 --> 02:43:10,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh!

2406
02:43:13,981 --> 02:43:16,983
[SPEAKER_09]: The title goes, Put the Blame on Video Games.

2407
02:43:17,523 --> 02:43:22,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Never in an entire moment I wanted to punch a window so badly in my life.

2408
02:43:24,728 --> 02:43:26,869
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people out there that think this way.

2409
02:43:26,909 --> 02:43:32,792
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a shocking reality, and it is infuriating that people can be so ignorant.

2410
02:43:33,993 --> 02:43:36,254
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the gist of the argument, or did you even get that far?

2411
02:43:36,895 --> 02:43:39,636
[SPEAKER_09]: It was only two paragraphs from two different people.

2412
02:43:40,797 --> 02:43:41,658
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all it was.

2413
02:43:41,738 --> 02:43:42,098
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just...

2414
02:43:44,501 --> 02:43:45,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, what is local?

2415
02:43:45,802 --> 02:43:49,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty much just saying the biggest reason for gun violence is the violence associated with video games.

2416
02:43:49,944 --> 02:43:51,925
[SPEAKER_09]: They are a breeding ground for future murderers.

2417
02:43:52,406 --> 02:43:56,428
[SPEAKER_09]: It is too easy to sit in front of a video game and shoot animated figures on the screen.

2418
02:43:56,728 --> 02:43:59,530
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no moral responsibility for the characters you shoot up.

2419
02:43:59,910 --> 02:44:02,372
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no pain when your character is killed or wounded.

2420
02:44:02,792 --> 02:44:07,295
[SPEAKER_09]: It is all done knowing that the only thing you have to do is reload the game to get a new life.

2421
02:44:07,535 --> 02:44:08,936
[SPEAKER_00]: A breeding ground for future murderers.

2422
02:44:08,956 --> 02:44:11,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, DarkSakura, you know, since you're job hunting again, you could be a murderer.

2423
02:44:11,899 --> 02:44:13,020
[SPEAKER_09]: That could be your new career.

2424
02:44:13,060 --> 02:44:13,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Contract killer?

2425
02:44:13,741 --> 02:44:13,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2426
02:44:13,841 --> 02:44:14,882
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, because you play video games.

2427
02:44:32,438 --> 02:44:34,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Clearly, what did you say you've been playing this week?

2428
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Mass Effect and Bomberman mixed with Pac-Man?

2429
02:44:37,862 --> 02:44:38,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, shit.

2430
02:44:38,623 --> 02:44:39,343
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a terrorist.

2431
02:44:39,423 --> 02:44:40,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Bomberman.

2432
02:44:40,284 --> 02:44:41,365
[SPEAKER_02]: You bomb things.

2433
02:44:42,626 --> 02:44:47,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Except if I was actually going to be a contract killer, I'd use blades and poisons, so that doesn't work for me.

2434
02:44:47,889 --> 02:44:48,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Not my style, sorry.

2435
02:44:48,810 --> 02:44:51,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you're going to have to play more Thief and Assassin's Creed.

2436
02:44:54,334 --> 02:44:54,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

2437
02:44:55,155 --> 02:44:57,737
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing video games taught me how to do is throw balloons at people.

2438
02:44:57,917 --> 02:45:00,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, we don't know right from wrong.

2439
02:45:02,182 --> 02:45:05,346
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't do magic, so clearly WoW hasn't helped me.

2440
02:45:05,546 --> 02:45:11,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Because gamers, gaming, Ranma has some, and you know, obviously I'm not saying this at you, but the person who wrote that.

2441
02:45:12,654 --> 02:45:17,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Gamers, obviously, we don't know how to tell the difference between the real world and our digital world.

2442
02:45:18,427 --> 02:45:19,888
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just like movies are real.

2443
02:45:20,248 --> 02:45:21,388
[SPEAKER_02]: All movies are documentaries.

2444
02:45:21,428 --> 02:45:23,289
[SPEAKER_02]: The Blair Witch Project, totally true.

2445
02:45:24,070 --> 02:45:24,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

2446
02:45:28,692 --> 02:45:28,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

2447
02:45:29,172 --> 02:45:29,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2448
02:45:30,853 --> 02:45:32,234
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a horror film, that's for sure.

2449
02:45:34,084 --> 02:45:44,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, the thing that really pissed me off the most about this is that something like this you would expect in the New York Post or as I like to call the Republican News Daily.

2450
02:45:45,388 --> 02:45:48,850
[SPEAKER_09]: This came out of the Daily News, the leftist paper that I read.

2451
02:45:49,470 --> 02:45:50,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what?

2452
02:45:50,390 --> 02:45:52,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Leland Yee is a Democrat.

2453
02:45:52,691 --> 02:45:56,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Idiocy does not know Republican and Democrat balance.

2454
02:45:56,332 --> 02:45:57,873
[SPEAKER_02]: There are idiots on both sides.

2455
02:45:58,553 --> 02:46:00,034
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another harsh reality.

2456
02:46:00,094 --> 02:46:01,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Idiocy is nonpartisan.

2457
02:46:01,734 --> 02:46:03,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, idiocy is nonpartisan.

2458
02:46:03,495 --> 02:46:06,856
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are people that are way too extreme in their thinking on both sides.

2459
02:46:06,916 --> 02:46:07,656
[SPEAKER_02]: That's reality.

2460
02:46:08,837 --> 02:46:13,619
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, after the initial shock of it, I realized, you know, this is why I'm in the middle.

2461
02:46:13,959 --> 02:46:16,380
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear what both sides have to say before I make my decision.

2462
02:46:16,440 --> 02:46:17,880
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the way I look at it.

2463
02:46:17,900 --> 02:46:19,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Because this is just, no.

2464
02:46:20,061 --> 02:46:20,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

2465
02:46:23,184 --> 02:46:25,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we always talk about third party.

2466
02:46:25,225 --> 02:46:27,466
[SPEAKER_02]: There needs to be a third party in this country.

2467
02:46:27,506 --> 02:46:35,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's start somewhere with not being so naive when it comes to media.

2468
02:46:36,050 --> 02:46:37,551
[SPEAKER_05]: I like what SSJ100Mass said.

2469
02:46:37,791 --> 02:46:39,471
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a white mage in Final Fantasy XI.

2470
02:46:39,491 --> 02:46:41,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that gives me the credentials to perform surgery.

2471
02:46:41,672 --> 02:46:42,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

2472
02:46:43,553 --> 02:46:47,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really good at... Crap, what's that surgery game now?

2473
02:46:48,615 --> 02:46:49,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Trauma.

2474
02:46:49,395 --> 02:46:50,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Trauma Center.

2475
02:46:50,396 --> 02:46:54,917
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I should be a weatherman because I was a black mage in Final Fantasy XI.

2476
02:46:54,997 --> 02:46:56,257
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's gonna rain.

2477
02:46:56,497 --> 02:46:57,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Bolt 3, motherfucker.

2478
02:46:58,918 --> 02:47:00,199
[SPEAKER_09]: That's exactly what I'm talking about.

2479
02:47:02,039 --> 02:47:04,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Ranma, thank you for making us all angry.

2480
02:47:04,240 --> 02:47:07,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for sharing your pain with all of us here and the listeners.

2481
02:47:07,761 --> 02:47:08,741
[SPEAKER_02]: We really appreciate it.

2482
02:47:09,161 --> 02:47:12,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else you want to... Akuma JP makes a good statement.

2483
02:47:12,982 --> 02:47:14,823
[SPEAKER_05]: White mage doesn't perform surgery, they just pray.

2484
02:47:15,267 --> 02:47:15,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Heal, please.

2485
02:47:15,947 --> 02:47:16,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Prop, please.

2486
02:47:17,208 --> 02:47:19,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Ranma, anything else you want to share with listeners before I let you go tonight?

2487
02:47:20,550 --> 02:47:23,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, listen to this week's episode of Anime Jam Session.

2488
02:47:23,891 --> 02:47:25,672
[SPEAKER_09]: We go over two hours.

2489
02:47:25,932 --> 02:47:32,556
[SPEAKER_09]: We posted, we added a special rant because some dipshit decided to post their rules for cosplay.

2490
02:47:33,176 --> 02:47:35,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I remember reading that, bitch.

2491
02:47:35,577 --> 02:47:36,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no.

2492
02:47:36,538 --> 02:47:37,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yes.

2493
02:47:37,298 --> 02:47:44,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Because of me going nuts and a bunch of other people, she took the post down and she deleted her like page.

2494
02:47:45,879 --> 02:47:55,285
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's still archived because once it's on the internet it's there forever and people have reposted the archive Ranma, this is for this week's episode of Anime Jam Session I'll let you borrow this, okay?

2495
02:48:00,751 --> 02:48:01,612
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2496
02:48:23,033 --> 02:48:25,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, she was... She opened up the bottom part.

2497
02:48:26,015 --> 02:48:27,115
[SPEAKER_00]: She was awesome.

2498
02:48:27,135 --> 02:48:28,476
[SPEAKER_02]: That was awesome.

2499
02:48:29,636 --> 02:48:31,397
[SPEAKER_02]: How fucking clever is that, right?

2500
02:48:32,117 --> 02:48:37,040
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's this screen grab on Tumblr of her and then all these Facebook comments.

2501
02:48:37,440 --> 02:48:38,220
[SPEAKER_02]: She's fat.

2502
02:48:38,480 --> 02:48:40,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it really is bigger on the inside.

2503
02:48:40,201 --> 02:48:42,482
[SPEAKER_02]: All this other just really... Garbage.

2504
02:48:43,243 --> 02:48:44,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, garbage is the only way to say it.

2505
02:48:44,743 --> 02:48:45,244
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like...

2506
02:48:46,324 --> 02:48:48,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought she was hot, to be honest.

2507
02:48:48,747 --> 02:48:50,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, she was.

2508
02:48:50,209 --> 02:48:53,352
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to see those assholes cosplay and pull off something that clever.

2509
02:48:56,957 --> 02:49:05,747
[SPEAKER_09]: But the thing is, that argument's been going on in the cosplay world for years because there's actual photographers that refuse to take pictures of people that are plus size.

2510
02:49:07,410 --> 02:49:09,472
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw in chat says...

2511
02:49:24,728 --> 02:49:46,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in Reno, that's my excuse I'm waiting for the podcast before I hear but I'm sure they covered it very well so I will tip my hat and mention Understation Live this week hopefully they get the podcast updated soon because I would love to hear those guys rant on the TARDIS thing because that was I thought she was a great looking gal and very clever

2512
02:49:47,455 --> 02:49:49,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it was phenomenal.

2513
02:49:49,437 --> 02:49:50,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Simple as that.

2514
02:49:50,898 --> 02:49:52,739
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to wear that dress for like a wedding.

2515
02:49:53,059 --> 02:49:54,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I would wear that dress.

2516
02:49:54,240 --> 02:49:54,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit.

2517
02:49:55,201 --> 02:49:55,481
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2518
02:49:56,502 --> 02:49:57,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma, I got to let you go.

2519
02:49:57,583 --> 02:49:57,863
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2520
02:49:58,444 --> 02:49:59,064
[SPEAKER_02]: You got it, bro.

2521
02:49:59,144 --> 02:49:59,365
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2522
02:49:59,405 --> 02:49:59,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care, buddy.

2523
02:50:00,325 --> 02:50:00,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

2524
02:50:01,246 --> 02:50:01,506
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2525
02:50:01,546 --> 02:50:02,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys so much for the calls.

2526
02:50:02,827 --> 02:50:03,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have to wrap up.

2527
02:50:04,208 --> 02:50:05,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to close up the Skype line for tonight.

2528
02:50:06,130 --> 02:50:10,113
[SPEAKER_02]: If you did not get through, though, I always say, please write down your thoughts.

2529
02:50:10,273 --> 02:50:10,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Send an email.

2530
02:50:11,054 --> 02:50:11,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Make Jamie work.

2531
02:50:12,975 --> 02:50:14,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLondonTrader.com.

2532
02:50:15,297 --> 02:50:15,818
[SPEAKER_02]: or Twitter.

2533
02:50:15,878 --> 02:50:17,299
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta get to Twitter topics as well.

2534
02:50:17,879 --> 02:50:20,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, did you have last minute stories before I get to the tweets?

2535
02:50:21,201 --> 02:50:22,082
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just a couple tonight.

2536
02:50:22,122 --> 02:50:24,503
[SPEAKER_10]: There were layoffs over at SuperBot.

2537
02:50:25,444 --> 02:50:25,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

2538
02:50:26,024 --> 02:50:26,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no.

2539
02:50:26,425 --> 02:50:29,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Sony confirmed that, so that kind of sucks.

2540
02:50:29,507 --> 02:50:30,367
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't say how many, though.

2541
02:50:32,659 --> 02:50:33,760
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's see.

2542
02:50:33,820 --> 02:50:35,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a couple quick tweets here.

2543
02:50:36,321 --> 02:50:38,001
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, let me – I'm sorry, guys.

2544
02:50:38,021 --> 02:50:38,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to pull this up.

2545
02:50:39,262 --> 02:50:40,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Live radio, it's a blast.

2546
02:50:40,523 --> 02:50:45,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pulling this up on the show computer because I couldn't find my iPad because I think it's still in the luggage.

2547
02:50:46,285 --> 02:50:48,986
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm bringing up the show computer tweets real quick.

2548
02:50:51,828 --> 02:50:54,869
[SPEAKER_02]: There were two, and the first one was from – here we go, Tiger Claw.

2549
02:50:55,269 --> 02:51:01,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Disney is prepared to look at game violence because, you know, there is that call on the industry –

2550
02:51:02,651 --> 02:51:03,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Are games too violent?

2551
02:51:03,711 --> 02:51:04,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Disney.

2552
02:51:05,852 --> 02:51:11,154
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I think who's putting out the most violent video games in existence right now, I go, oh, shit, it's Disney.

2553
02:51:11,775 --> 02:51:12,335
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, right?

2554
02:51:13,415 --> 02:51:21,278
[SPEAKER_02]: But to be fair, Disney, you know, they stuck their big toe in the water with the more serious gaming with the whole split second.

2555
02:51:21,298 --> 02:51:22,679
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, they closed that studios.

2556
02:51:22,759 --> 02:51:23,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2557
02:51:23,339 --> 02:51:26,120
[SPEAKER_10]: The only violent game I can think of that they published was Turok.

2558
02:51:27,159 --> 02:51:44,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Robert Iger said, quote, at Disney, there's very little violent content, but I still want to make sure we're asking ourselves the right questions in term of that standard and also ensure we're willing to be a part of a dialogue in today's world that I think is pretty necessary in terms of what our role is and what our role should be.

2559
02:51:44,891 --> 02:51:47,432
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I got to be honest, I wouldn't read too much into that.

2560
02:51:47,472 --> 02:51:49,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's just saying the right answer.

2561
02:51:50,494 --> 02:51:53,795
[SPEAKER_02]: because at the video game industry, you don't really want to poo-poo it.

2562
02:51:55,936 --> 02:52:08,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was smart that all those guys went to go meet with Biden when he asked the video game companies to meet with him because it's like if you don't sit there and represent yourself, somebody else will do it for you, and it's probably not the person you want representing yourself.

2563
02:52:08,939 --> 02:52:16,982
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's nice that Disney said this, but it's kind of the expected answer, I think.

2564
02:52:18,182 --> 02:52:23,546
[SPEAKER_02]: One more tweet here from SSJ100Matt who tweeted us, New age of gaming classifieds?

2565
02:52:24,086 --> 02:52:29,410
[SPEAKER_02]: A group has started on Facebook for people looking to buy, sell, rent arcade machines.

2566
02:52:30,270 --> 02:52:30,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

2567
02:52:31,231 --> 02:52:35,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcade Exchange, a Facebook community for buying and selling the classics.

2568
02:52:35,473 --> 02:52:37,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you can find one of these for pinball, DarkSakura.

2569
02:52:39,256 --> 02:53:00,875
[SPEAKER_02]: it is listed as a page created to help bring together the hundreds of collectors and enthusiasts from around the world into one place it's through Facebook but it allows members to post their for sale or wanted ads just for arcade machines and their related parts that's kind of rad I'm going to look at the Facebook community myself right now facebook.com slash arcade exchange all one word

2570
02:53:02,665 --> 02:53:06,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, a Killer Instinct, PCB, HD, and Marquee.

2571
02:53:06,608 --> 02:53:08,489
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't boot up, but it's $75.

2572
02:53:10,871 --> 02:53:14,193
[SPEAKER_02]: That's literally just the little board, not even the machine or anything.

2573
02:53:14,213 --> 02:53:15,194
[SPEAKER_02]: That's still kind of neat, though.

2574
02:53:16,975 --> 02:53:19,717
[SPEAKER_02]: A Pump It Up Fiesta 2010 upgrade kit for $400.

2575
02:53:20,017 --> 02:53:22,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, look, pinball machines.

2576
02:53:22,318 --> 02:53:26,801
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Terminator 2, Roadshow, Revenge from Mars.

2577
02:53:27,542 --> 02:53:28,623
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.

2578
02:53:28,663 --> 02:53:29,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Revenge from Mars, $1,800. $1,800.

2579
02:53:32,572 --> 02:53:33,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that one's going to be expensive.

2580
02:53:34,855 --> 02:53:35,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

2581
02:53:35,596 --> 02:53:36,036
[SPEAKER_02]: That's neat.

2582
02:53:36,116 --> 02:53:37,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for that link, SSJ100Math.

2583
02:53:37,418 --> 02:53:37,919
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great one.

2584
02:53:38,099 --> 02:53:39,500
[SPEAKER_02]: I may get rid of some of my stuff.

2585
02:53:40,702 --> 02:53:43,365
[SPEAKER_02]: One more tweet from RossDLUT coming in here at the last minute.

2586
02:53:43,385 --> 02:53:43,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll read this.

2587
02:53:44,046 --> 02:53:46,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Can gaming get outside of the man cave?

2588
02:53:46,709 --> 02:53:51,495
[SPEAKER_02]: The reaction of people speaking against the Dead Island statue suggests we're still stuck in.

2589
02:53:53,499 --> 02:53:55,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure I'm following the logic on that.

2590
02:53:55,700 --> 02:53:59,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't people speaking out against the Dead Island statue be a good thing?

2591
02:53:59,122 --> 02:54:02,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that was pretty irresponsible.

2592
02:54:03,205 --> 02:54:07,247
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was not, it was just, it was, it's just in bad taste.

2593
02:54:07,628 --> 02:54:09,749
[SPEAKER_02]: That whole thing was just in bad taste.

2594
02:54:11,890 --> 02:54:15,933
[SPEAKER_02]: But am I, am I thinking that maybe the statue itself suggests that we're still stuck in?

2595
02:54:16,373 --> 02:54:17,494
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to send an email, sir.

2596
02:54:17,514 --> 02:54:19,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to, I would love to hear your thoughts elaborated.

2597
02:54:20,115 --> 02:54:21,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at orange lingerie dot com.

2598
02:54:23,192 --> 02:54:26,074
[SPEAKER_02]: More last minute stories tonight, Loki?

2599
02:54:27,155 --> 02:54:27,355
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

2600
02:54:27,856 --> 02:54:28,016
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

2601
02:54:28,777 --> 02:54:29,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's it then.

2602
02:54:29,757 --> 02:54:30,438
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it, yeah.

2603
02:54:30,758 --> 02:54:31,659
[SPEAKER_02]: We're wrapping up the show.

02:55:49,711 --> 02:55:54,656
