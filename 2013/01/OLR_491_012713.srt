Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this January 27th, 2013, episode number 491 of our program on this lovely Sunday evening.

00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:58,000
My name is Rob Roberts with you all at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOG at Network.com, where we do tape our show every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Joining me in studio to talk about video games and gaming culture and gaming lolz, emphasis on lolz, are my co-hosts.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
First off, the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Lol.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How are you?

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm free.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Free?

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Free.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Free as a bird.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I quit my job.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Congratulations! Yay, applause.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Now I need another one, but I have an interview on Monday.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
There you go. Just line them right up.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But I'm not going to go into any detail about it because she's crazy.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yeah.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So, um, but yeah, free.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
There you go.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Free.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Happy. Happy.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And that same night I had Noki, so it was awesome.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm reminded of that scene from Braveheart, even though I can't stand Belle Gibson, but you know, freedom!

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You know, forget it.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Anyhow, I'll also say hello to the free tech master, Loki.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hello.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Terrible transition, I know. How are you, Loki?

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm doing fine.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And what won the dinner lottery for tonight?

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Ultimate cheeseburger from Jack in the Box.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Healthy as always, huh?

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I was hungry. I didn't eat anything all day, so, you know.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Alright, our chat room is open and welcoming your live comments.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Live.vognetwork.com where Breakman in our chat room starts off tonight saying,

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Quitting a job is one of the greatest experiences anyone can have.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Was it like that scene from, what movie was that? Was that Half Baked or something?

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Where the guys work in a fast food restaurant and he goes,

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. You're cool. I'm out.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I haven't seen Half Baked. Did I need to?

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You need to make like a list, you know, for your, because is Monday going to be your first full day off?

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Did you quit Friday or Thursday?

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I quit Thursday. She's paying me for Friday.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And which I got, I saved, I actually saved a photo of the text message.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So if she doesn't, I can nail her.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Well, I was going to say, on Monday, you should have an unemployment marathon

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and you can watch like, you know, Falling Down with Michael Douglas.

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You can watch, you know.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You know what?

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Half Baked.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
On Monday.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Waiting, that would be a good one too.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
On Monday, though, I have an appointment in the morning and a job interview.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Oh.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So it was sort of like, and I, it's funny, I, okay, I'll talk about this later, but I got a cat

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and I thought I could go pick her up a little bit early and then I ended up forgetting the paperwork at home,

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
so I had to turn back around.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The moment I started unlocking my door, I called about the other jobs, so.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Well, let's talk about that.

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I did want to start off, you know, before we get into how was our gaming week.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We have some personal life updates we wanted to get out there.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And so, yes, let's talk about Dark Sakura.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Mommy once again for a new kitty, right?

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes, I have a new cat.

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Her name is Midna.

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I almost named her Aerie, but Midna seems to fit her better.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
She's very impish.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And there's people that might not catch the reference.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's from Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
There you go.

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Which is funny, the other day I was like, so our little princess is perched on the couch

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and Dan's like, yeah, Twilight Princess.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It was pretty funny.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
She's about eight months old, maybe a little older, I don't know, but she's tiny.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
She's still tiny and very lithe and has lime green eyes and she's all black.

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Actually, I thought she was all completely black,

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
but she has like a few little white hairs scattered across her chest.

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Sounds like Maruko.

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah, but she's really short-furred.

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
She's short-furred, but she does walk with her tail in the air like he did.

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
She's not really, I'd say, she doesn't press about, you know, but she does jump around a lot.

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And she adopted one of Shermie's toys as hers.

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So I was like, well, Shermie loved it, so I'm glad the new kitty loves it.

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But she's so smart.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
She comes in the back room, looks at me, and then runs away.

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And I'm like, what?

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So she runs back in the room and looks at me and makes a squeak, so I follow her.

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
She picks up this toy in her mouth.

94
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's like one of these long felt things on a string.

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
She picks it up in her mouth, carries it over to me, and drops it at my feet.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Like, hear mother play.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So I was like, okay.

98
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
She does this all the time.

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And then like when I'm done playing, she'll just pick it up and carry it off in the corner and start licking it.

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And she hasn't had any accidents.

101
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Normally, in my experience with a kitten, they have like a couple little poopy or pee-pee accidents.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Not a single one.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
She knows where her box is.

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Good kitty.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah, she's a good baby.

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And she's just smart and she's cuddly.

107
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But because she's still kind of a kitten, she loses attention really quickly.

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So she's like, okay, I'm done cuddling play.

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Tigerclaw, our resident internet research expert at live.vognetwork.com, found the picture that you posted on Twitter this week, apparently.

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah, the one picture I did on Twitter.

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
All the chatters are now going, duh.

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But I think I got it uploaded.

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If you go to my Tumblr, which is kurotsubasa.

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A.

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Whatever tsubasa is spelled like.

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You don't even know how to spell your own damn name.

117
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
T-S-U-B-A-S-A.

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Maybe you need a less complicated name.

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Shut up.

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Like janeshepard2.tumblr.com or something.

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's kurotsubasa.tumblr.com.

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Maybe that's too much.

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
No.

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But she's, I have a video of her playing on my Tumblr.

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I just tried to upload it from my phone.

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And Brad, I don't care if you don't like cats.

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You don't have to live with her.

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
She's my cat, not yours.

129
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But she's adorable.

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
She's sweet.

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Dogs can be cute too.

132
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Not really.

133
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Especially corgis.

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
They stink.

135
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Especially corgis.

136
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I met a corgi at PetSmart when I was buying stuff for Midna.

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Were you tempted?

138
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
No.

139
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Were you tempted almost?

140
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Because I found out first hand now that I'm actually the same type of allergic to corgis

141
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I am to other dogs.

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh.

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Tragedy.

144
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah.

145
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I keep telling Alan when we get a house someday, it's gonna be Corgi Village.

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yes, break man.

147
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
My cat is all black.

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But she's got just like a few scattering white furs on her chest.

149
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Like Dark Sakura's heart.

150
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah.

151
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
My heart is black with white fur.

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Alright.

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Anyhow.

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Anything else before we move on to other stuff?

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
She's just funny to watch explore.

156
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
She's really cute.

157
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I love my new kitty.

158
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I mean, but I still get a little nostalgic for Shermie, you know?

159
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I can't...

160
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I almost picked up Shermie's mousey to give to the new kitten and I was like, I can't

161
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
do it.

162
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Well AkumaJP in our chat room has a theory saying, you know, cats do come back.

163
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Cats do come back.

164
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You never know.

165
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But this cat was alive before Shermie died.

166
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Because I've got her shot records from September.

167
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You never know.

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Well, she just doesn't act at all like Shermie did.

169
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
She's completely different than Shermie.

170
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I mean, she's cuddly and sweet and everything.

171
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But even, but Shermie was still stupidly neurotic when she was that old.

172
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You don't want to replace it.

173
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Like, you're not trying to replace Shermie.

174
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
No, I'm not trying to replace Shermie.

175
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's not like I'm getting Shermie 2.0, the sequel for MatchingService.com.

176
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You know, I've just got, I've got Midna now.

177
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Although her other nickname, her other name is Ninja.

178
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Because when Dan brought the cousins over and he texted me from home and said, hey,

179
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
where's the cat?

180
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Did you take her to the show?

181
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm like, no.

182
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
First of all, like her carrier is still out in the dining room.

183
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Hello.

184
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And I think that my cat would probably freak out if I tried to bring her.

185
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Um, but, um, Dan ended up finding her under the liner underneath the couch.

186
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Now, Brad would like to clarify what he said earlier.

187
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
He says being deathly allergic might have a bit to do with the hatred.

188
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Well, yeah, I could, I could see that.

189
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Well, I'm like that with dogs, but I love dogs, but I'm stupidly allergic to them.

190
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah.

191
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I mean, it probably the only dog I think I could get away with having would be a pit,

192
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
a pit or a boxer.

193
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
No, thank you.

194
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm going to tell you something, Rob.

195
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Pit bulls are actually among the most loyal and sweetest dogs, but they do require a good

196
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
trainer.

197
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
La, la, la, la, la.

198
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Your sentence didn't contain the word corgi.

199
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Stop caring.

200
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Like I could have like a Yorkie, but Dan is like, they're not real dogs.

201
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
All right.

202
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Can we move on from kitty kitty puppy chat as much as I'm sure people, you know, who

203
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
did a video game podcast probably wouldn't mind kitty puppy chat.

204
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You know, we do have to talk video games at some point, but my cat's awesome, but I have

205
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
another personal story real quick.

206
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay.

207
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So oil art today, like seriously almost didn't happen.

208
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And it's because we went to Reno this weekend.

209
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Uh, just, it was a random thing.

210
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I've been having cabin fever lately.

211
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You know, the last big trip we took was when I didn't even go there with Alan.

212
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I went with Victoria, but Disneyland in September was like the last like trip I went outside

213
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
of the Bay area.

214
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't count Bay area trips cause it's like my second home.

215
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So like, you know, it'd been a few months since we'd really gone anywhere.

216
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So I was like, let's go somewhere.

217
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Let's go to Chico, my old hometown, or let's go to, uh, let's go to Reno or something.

218
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So we decided to go to Reno because we looked at the forecast and it was sunny, sunny, sunny,

219
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
sunny, partially cloudy.

220
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
We're like, okay, we won't run into any issues.

221
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Sure.

222
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's winter, but it'll be fine.

223
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
We'll be able to see some of the snow that's up there and we can go gamble.

224
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So we drove up there, no problem.

225
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And that's some fun.

226
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And I do want to talk about casinos in a minute because yes, it does relate to video games.

227
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Uh, but then this morning, Oh crap, it snowed overnight.

228
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And apparently, yeah.

229
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Uh, like at least an inch of snow fell over the mountains and that means the chain controls

230
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
are on.

231
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Well, I don't have an SUV.

232
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I don't carry chains.

233
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I don't know how to put on chains.

234
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I don't even think I'm supposed to use chains in my car.

235
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I think I have to use these vinyl things regardless.

236
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I don't really want to have to deal with all that fuckery.

237
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So I'm like, great.

238
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Now I'm like the word fuckery.

239
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah.

240
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You'll hear that word a lot on tonight's show, by the way.

241
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Uh, the word of the day is fuckery.

242
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Um, where fucks are made.

243
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's where the fuck comes from.

244
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's a fuckery.

245
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Anyhow, speaking of fuckery, uh, we're leaving Reno and uh, yeah, no, finally the snow, I

246
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
guess melted around noon cause the sun finally came up and the clouds parted.

247
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I was very happy because I did not want to have to miss tonight's show.

248
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And more importantly, I did not want to have to miss work tomorrow because stupid me doesn't

249
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
know how to put chains on a fricking car.

250
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Anyhow, crisis averted.

251
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But the cool thing about being in Reno is that you get to see all the new toys and I'll tell you

252
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
what, they dump a lot of money into casino games.

253
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I don't know how often you guys like go into casinos and stuff, but there's a lot of like neat

254
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
technology to try and bring in your money.

255
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Um, you may or may not know this, but a company that we've talked about on the show for a long

256
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
time, Konami, has a huge, uh, game making business in slot machines.

257
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That's a huge part of their business.

258
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
They make a lot of various slot machines.

259
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
If you ever, you know, if you're old enough and you're at the casino, look at the corner of some

260
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
of the slot machine games, you'll sometimes see that they're made by Konami.

261
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But what really like struck me as interesting is that a lot of the, um, okay, wait, I have to

262
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
clarify this cause the folks in chat are like, really?

263
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
An inch of snow?

264
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You were freaking out over an inch of snow.

265
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Hold on. All right.

266
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
In my defense, we're in California.

267
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
We don't get like snow ever.

268
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Unless you live in Tahoe.

269
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Unless you, yeah.

270
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
California does have its very beautiful snowy parts.

271
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I don't live, I don't live there.

272
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I live in the sacraments where it gets up to 105 or no, my favorite term I heard this week.

273
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
100 and fuck.

274
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Sacra ghetto.

275
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I live in Sacra ghetto, California, and it gets up to like 105 here in the summer.

276
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So yes, the littlest snow will freak me out in our cars.

277
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
We don't, we don't antifreeze.

278
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What kind of fuckery is antifreeze?

279
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
We don't use that shit here.

280
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Like this is just not something we're used to.

281
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So yes, an inch of snow is a big deal.

282
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Thank you, Bobby Black Wolf.

283
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's not a phrase I say very often on this show.

284
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh no, no, no, no.

285
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Just kidding.

286
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But he says, I understand freaking out over an inch of snow.

287
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I live in Georgia.

288
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm from Alabama.

289
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
We actually did get snow in Mobile, which is technically a subtropical climate, but

290
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
everything shuts down and you can't find bread.

291
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
SSJ 100 Matt says, you don't need chains for an inch of snow.

292
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You'll be safe in lower gear.

293
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Ah, but is that true going up and down a 5,000 foot mountain?

294
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That's probably the difference.

295
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That's why you're fine.

296
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Eh, whatever.

297
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Anyway, well tell the CHP that.

298
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Okay.

299
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So anyway, we're back to the casino games.

300
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Just drift, man.

301
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Come on.

302
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The part about gaming.

303
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Uh, the part about gaming.

304
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Uh, there are some interesting technology in some of these games.

305
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Okay, so don't laugh.

306
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But Alan and I were looking at a sex in the city slot machine.

307
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It was huge.

308
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Shut up.

309
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I saw the picture and I didn't get the reference.

310
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
This thing looked like it was like $100,000 machine.

311
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I mean, it was like super fancy, right?

312
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And we didn't play it.

313
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
We didn't give it any money, but we were looking at it cause we're like, this is like,

314
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
this screen is like twice the size of what you see on like a Derby's owner club.

315
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And you look at the little.

316
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
How ironic that you would use that reference to a horse game.

317
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I see what you did there.

318
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
All right, so we're looking at the screen and we look carefully at the little rolls

319
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
of the slot machine.

320
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's in 3D like the screens are in 3D and I'm like, they're using the same technology

321
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
in the three, like no glasses or anything, right?

322
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
They're using that glasses free technology.

323
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Dan's old phone had it.

324
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
That you see in the 3DS and all that stuff on slot machines now.

325
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Man, her face is really long.

326
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Although I have to say I'm like the least girly girl ever cause I didn't understand

327
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
the maker of those shoes or whatever.

328
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's all right.

329
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's all right.

330
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Uh, so yeah, there was a 3D game I played later.

331
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It was called, um, don't laugh.

332
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It was called ladybug wedding too.

333
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And I won more money on that machine that did anything.

334
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Okay, look, Alan and I have the Alan.

335
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Alan, come here.

336
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I need to put you on the spot.

337
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Hi Alan.

338
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
How are you?

339
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What happened?

340
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Good.

341
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Did you enjoy Reno?

342
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I did.

343
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So I'm talking about like some of the technology we saw in the casinos.

344
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Did you find the technology that they use in slot machines like fascinating?

345
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah.

346
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Um, once we passed the big monolith sex in the city thing to make fun of it.

347
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Um, I then started noticing those 3D screens on a lot of the other newer machines and it

348
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
was kind of like how the 3DS is where it's not so much that it pops out, but especially

349
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
like it, it looks like recess, like you can see like, you know, an inch, like it looks

350
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
like you're looking inside the screen.

351
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Uh, code man in our chat room says I work in the casino business and Konami has a whole

352
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
separate business for casinos.

353
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
They work closely with Bali.

354
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
They, they make some amazing pinball machines and code man continues.

355
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Those machines are made up, have four separate screens on top of each other.

356
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It was interesting to see them broken down.

357
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The ladybug game I was playing had that thing going on, but the sex in the city was like

358
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
a true 3D, but yeah, the four screen 3D trick was really cool.

359
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Like it was, it was a neat effect, but okay.

360
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So to justify why I was playing ladybug wedding to tell the listeners about your strategy

361
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
when it comes to slot machines, my friend, uh, Ira, who I've known for several years,

362
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
um, he made a comment on the picture post I made on Facebook of the sex in the city

363
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
city machine and he's like, I'm dead serious.

364
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Play the gayest, most flamboyant slots you can find.

365
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Cause I did, I played some like unicorn magic bullshit in Las Vegas and won $1,100.

366
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And I was like, all right, so I played a unit.

367
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I found a unicorn slot and I found it too.

368
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Guess how gay this is?

369
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Village people themed slot machines.

370
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I was down about 25 bucks.

371
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I made all my money back and ended the night ahead, $12.

372
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
This, this motherfucker hit the super jackpot on the village people slot machine.

373
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yeah.

374
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I put in a five and it cashed out like $37.

375
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I was like, I just made all my money back and I'm ahead 12.

376
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I cause I thought I just blew 20 bucks.

377
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I don't even want, I made it all back.

378
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You get with hitting the super jackpot on a village people machine.

379
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Well, ironically, like a stage show occurring.

380
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Ironically, you're trying to avoid the pooper.

381
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And yes, on the, on the little bonus stage, you're trying, you hit these little things.

382
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's a party pooper, but yeah, like a nerd pops up cause they're doing the disco.

383
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And then if you click the wrong record, this nerd's like, what are you guys doing?

384
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
This music's too loud.

385
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And then you end the, you end the bonus stage.

386
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And he's the pooper.

387
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You're trying to avoid the pooper.

388
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Did I tell a lie?

389
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So yeah, I was looking for, and some of the slot machine themes are like jungle prince, lion king, fluffy poodle deluxe.

390
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Like every absurd.

391
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I played kitty glitter.

392
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Yeah, kitty glitter.

393
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And the amount of times my peripheral vision misread hot slots is hot slots.

394
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And I had to look and go, what?

395
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Oh, slots that happened like a dozen times.

396
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So what was your favorite machine that you played?

397
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Well, the village people, cause I went all the money on it.

398
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I was actually going to say, I also like seeing the loosest sluts ever.

399
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Uh, quickly, the other 3d one, I saw you playing something like miss red, which was slutty red riding hood.

400
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,000
They have all of these, um, princess sort of thing, but they're all like sexed up like Scarlet hood.

401
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And she's got like a bikini on and the Wolf's all drooly and pervy.

402
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I played one red riding hood game that I didn't like.

403
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And then I played another one that I actually did really well on.

404
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I could have, I, I made like five bucks and then I was like, all right, I made five.

405
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I may as well spin it back down and I ended up losing it.

406
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
But that one I really liked.

407
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And that had a great 3d screen with a lot of little neat animations on it.

408
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I can't believe it.

409
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Leave it to the internets.

410
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Tiger claw found a video.

411
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Here's little ladybug two penny slot bonus mode.

412
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You don't really see the 3d effect on this thing.

413
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That was the game I was playing.

414
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
That's, I wouldn't mind.

415
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Just so you guys know, I'm not making it up.

416
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Thank you.

417
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Tiger.

418
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Okay.

419
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm giving the mic back to Jamie.

420
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
All right.

421
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Thank you, Alan.

422
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I think it's kind of wrong that someone just scored with KKK.

423
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
King, King, King.

424
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Shut up.

425
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm from Alabama.

426
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
All right.

427
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Wow.

428
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
No, thank you.

429
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
All right.

430
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Uh, let's see what else I want to say about, um, casinos and all that stuff.

431
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't know.

432
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I just think it's interesting that a lot of the stuff we see in like console gaming and

433
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
all that we see for adult gaming as well.

434
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And that a lot of the same companies are involved.

435
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I thought it was interesting.

436
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Technology.

437
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yay.

438
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Uh, really?

439
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Loco Poco links to crazy taxi slots.

440
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
They have slot machines for all sorts of weird things.

441
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Like the hangover, the movie has a slot machine.

442
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Like really?

443
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Of course.

444
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It was in Vegas.

445
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah, I guess, but we were in Reno.

446
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Oh, okay.

447
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Well then they can't have any sort of, you know, Nevada gambling themed slot machines

448
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
in other parts of Nevada.

449
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Oh, this is just the bonus feature in the Dreamcat.

450
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I thought this was an actual crazy taxi slot machine, but no, this is just the little bonus

451
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
feature in the home version.

452
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You sneaky little bastard.

453
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
All right.

454
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Uh, anyhow, let's move on.

455
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I guess we can get into chat rooms looking for all these slot machines now.

456
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I know.

457
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Look, I got y'all thinking about gambling pachinko.

458
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
All right.

459
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Let's talk about video games and console games and the things we've been playing this week.

460
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And then I have some housekeeping for tonight as well.

461
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
That's important.

462
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
So let's get to our gaming weeks first dark soccer.

463
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
How was your gaming week?

464
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
My gaming week was kitty.

465
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
No, actually, um, I played Mass Effect 2 again cause I'm, I think I finally mastered

466
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
fly cam.

467
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And, uh, if anyone wants to go to mass effecting.tumblr.com, you can see, um, a bunch of, uh, really

468
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
neat, uh, screen grabs I was able to do with the fly cam.

469
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And then, um, I, uh, I played a game that I'm going to be, well, I didn't play it for

470
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
very long, but, um, I played a game called Chomp Man, which we will be talking about

471
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
today.

472
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And, uh, that's really about it.

473
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I've had kind of a alarming week, so.

474
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Alrighty.

475
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Uh, Loki.

476
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Um, I didn't play a whole lot this week.

477
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I played actually a little bit of Minecraft last night.

478
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Um, I was bored and my wife got into the next series of terrible TV shows that I'm going

479
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
to have to sit through the entire series of.

480
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
This new series is Grey's Anatomy.

481
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I get to sit through the whole series of Grey's Anatomy.

482
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm sorry.

483
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Run.

484
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm, I'm thinking it's starting to go in my head because I don't think it's actually that

485
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
bad right now.

486
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's, it.

487
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You are so wet.

488
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm not, no, I'm not watching it.

489
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm playing Skyrim, okay, with headphones on.

490
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So occasionally I'll see Katherine Heigl, like, take off her clothes and stuff.

491
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So I'm like, okay, this is not so bad.

492
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But, um, yeah, so it's just, you know, it's brief bits of Katherine Heigl.

493
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
But anyways, so yeah, the other thing I've been playing, Skyrim, um, on PC with all the

494
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
mods and stuff and, um, kind of retracing my steps I did on the console version since

495
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I have, I'm probably going to play through the whole game now on PC because, um, well,

496
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I have more expansions on there.

497
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I bought the two expansions out right now and probably will buy Dragonborn when that

498
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
comes out.

499
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Um, I actually bought some more games on Steam today, but ironically most of my game purchases

500
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
now are not coming from, like, Steam sales.

501
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
They're coming from Amazon sales, which, you know, all the games redeem on Steam.

502
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
They had one today.

503
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It was, well, they got to compete.

504
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
They're doing a good job.

505
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Uh, they have station three is doing a similar approach.

506
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
This whole, like, what is it?

507
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
13 for 13.

508
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Like little big planet carding is $10 right now.

509
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Like I ought to be pissed.

510
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I bought that game when it was brand new, like 50 bucks.

511
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Considering doing that, except we, we have some free goods that are, we're sitting on.

512
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm trying to get in, um, uh, trying to do that, but yeah, they actually have a sale

513
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
going on right now.

514
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's their weekly.

515
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's five game arcade packs.

516
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And now I thought first I'm all Xbox live arcade.

517
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That's not bad.

518
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Um, but it's actually seen games, but they were featured on Xbox live arcade.

519
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's, uh, um, insanely twisted shadow planet, dead light, iron brigade, mark the ninja

520
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
and toy soldiers for $10.

521
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Or if you did purchase one of those packs during December, you get another $5 off.

522
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
So I did.

523
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
And so I got it for five bucks, five games for five bucks.

524
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
That's not a bad deal.

525
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And so I'm kind of having this huge collection of games, mostly indie games that are going

526
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
to be on this, you know, on my steam account, which eventually I'm hoping this year to build

527
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
a nice new media PC to hook up to my TV.

528
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
That'll be kind of my new gaming thing.

529
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Cause I've been getting a lot more games through steam for cheap than buying console games.

530
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I mean, I do play console games still, but you know, it's kind of think of it like the

531
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
fallout shelter of the game industry.

532
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
If everything, everything goes to shit with the new consoles, I at least have this backup,

533
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
um, you know, library of games to play.

534
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
So that's going to be fun.

535
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Um, some folks in chat talking about the price, a little big planet carding, uh, critical

536
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
myths said carding was $10 with PlayStation plus.

537
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I think that is correct.

538
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
The $10 price is when you, it's like 14 bucks.

539
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
If you don't, it's cheap.

540
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It's still very cheap.

541
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I paid 50 for it.

542
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So, so sit down basically.

543
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
But yes, thank you for the clarification.

544
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Yes.

545
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
For PlayStation plus.

546
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Um, and then, uh, what else did I play this week?

547
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Oh, um, other things, um, more quality of course, cause we're still playing quality.

548
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I'm still trying to get them to play something else.

549
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Um, I have been trying to soft mod some Xbox systems.

550
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You found five Xbox systems in a closet, literally at my work.

551
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Um, but they're broken in different ways, each one.

552
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So I'm trying to, I'm going to have to piece some together this week to get one that actually

553
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
works.

554
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Like I've got some that the disk drive doesn't work.

555
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
One that the audio chip is messed up.

556
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
One that doesn't power on.

557
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You know, but together with five systems, we should have enough to build one or two

558
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
that are, you know, working correctly.

559
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And I have all the stuff now to soft mod them.

560
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
So, hopefully I'll be able to do that.

561
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And put some emulators on there, cause that's what we're going to do with those things.

562
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And then, uh, what else did I do this week?

563
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Huh, that's pretty much it.

564
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I meant to play some more console games, but just didn't get around to it.

565
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
A little Borderlands 2 actually, we played a little bit of that.

566
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
A little bit.

567
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Uh, my week was mostly console games.

568
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
One console game that was a majority of my gaming time.

569
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's a game I said I wasn't going to buy, and then I had a moment of weakness and I bought it anyway.

570
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And I'm actually glad I did.

571
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It's Ni No Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch, which came out this week on PlayStation 3.

572
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Um, I've sunk, you know, keep in mind guys, I was gone all weekend.

573
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I sunk about eight hours into the game during the week.

574
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Uh, and for those that have played the game, I'll keep this as spoiler free as possible.

575
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I'm at the volcano.

576
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Ooh, there's a volcano in the game somewhere.

577
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Uh, that's about where I'm at.

578
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
But keep in mind, I've done like every side quest, and I'm very O.C. about kind of trying to do everything.

579
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And there is a lot of side quests and things you can do.

580
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Um, Ni No Kuni, first off, the first thing you're going to notice about the game is the graphics.

581
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It's a gorgeous game.

582
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You know, it's level five.

583
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Who I didn't, you know, I knew they'd done Dragon Quest VIII and all that, but it didn't really click for me until I started playing Ni No Kuni.

584
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I'm like, why does this feel a lot like White Knight Chronicles to me?

585
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Oh, because level five did that game.

586
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
But don't let that comparison scare you off.

587
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It just, they have, like, the fonts are similar and some of the graphics are a little similar.

588
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
But the art style is very, very different.

589
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
The gameplay is very different too.

590
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I don't want people who didn't like White Knight Chronicles to say like, oh, well fuck that then.

591
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Um, which I do think though, White Knight Chronicles is underrated, but that's another episode.

592
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Um, there's, uh, great graphics in the game.

593
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And one thing I really like about it is that it goes from, you know, you got this in-game anime style rendering that goes on

594
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:33,000
to actual cutscenes that Studio Ghibli did of anime that's intermixed in with the game.

595
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It is very interesting to me how you'll get these full-blown anime sequences, and then you get some voice-over sequences,

596
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
and then you get text. Like, read the text.

597
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
But, I don't know, like, it doesn't bother me as much as it bothers other people because maybe that's just what I grew up on.

598
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:57,000
You know, back in my day, when I played Final Fantasy VI, or as we were calling it, Final Fantasy III,

599
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
because, you know, we didn't have the internet back then, I didn't know that there were more games in Japan,

600
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
we would read all the text. You know, that's just kind of how you did it. So it doesn't really bother me as much.

601
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Um, but the game is gorgeous. Soundtrack's great, too.

602
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:20,000
The soundtrack is by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, who I believe also did the music in Dragon Quest VIII.

603
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,000
So, there's actually a lot in common with Dragon Quest VIII. I mean, the art style's very similar, and the music sounds very similar.

604
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:35,000
There's also that whole Pokemon element of the game, and this slowly unfolds. I mean, you don't have it all right in the very beginning,

605
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
it slowly unfolds over the first few hours of the game, but yes, many of the monsters you run across in-game you can actually capture,

606
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:48,000
and you use them in battle. And the battle system is really interesting, and this is where the demo really failed.

607
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And I know a lot of folks, you know, I'm sure a lot of you here at VoG heard Bobby talk about how he hated the demo,

608
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
and I even said it was really disappointing as well, too, because it didn't really explain things at all.

609
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Well, the first five hours of the game do a much better job explaining the battle system,

610
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
and how you actually are supposed to be switching quite frequently between yourself, your little Pokemon people,

611
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,000
and, you know, in later stages of the game, controlling other members of your party, essentially, who are usually controlled by an AI,

612
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
but you might have to switch to a particular individual to actually catch one of the little monsters.

613
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:32,000
So, the battle sequences are actually very intricate. They're kind of Final Fantasy XII-ish, in that you actually run around a little battlefield,

614
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:43,000
and you're, you know, doing the auto-attack, and you might cast magic, and you actually collect a little health and magic capsules that help you out on the battlefield.

615
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Yeah, it's a neat system. Some of the battles can be challenging, but there is an easy mode, or as I call it, easy modes in games now,

616
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,000
thanks to some inside jokes here at the VoG network. I call it Black Wolf Fun Forever mode, BFF mode.

617
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
So, yes, there is a Black Wolf Fun Forever mode, or easy mode in the game, and I haven't had to use it yet,

618
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
but I'm not afraid to if I run into a wall. I have really loved the story so far. It's been fantastic.

619
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Now, I have read some things online that a lot of critics were starting to razz the game around the 15-hour mark,

620
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
that it starts to get really grindy, and that the story loses a lot of steam and so forth.

621
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'm not there yet. I can't comment on that, so when I'm talking about how much I'm into this game,

622
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
you might want to take that with a grain of salt. I said it right up front. I'm only eight hours into the game,

623
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
but it's a damn fine eight hours that I've spent so far, and that's more I can say about other games that I've plunked a large sum of money on.

624
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So, take it or leave it. I'm having a great time with the game so far, and I do plan to finish it.

625
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I don't see why I wouldn't at this point. So, yeah, I recommend it. At least rent it, but don't go off that demo.

626
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:58,000
The demo was terrible. The demo, all they had to do was back up the demo about 20 minutes to really explain,

627
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:06,000
because the demo where you're fighting the boss monster takes place about 20 minutes after you get your little Pokemon

628
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
or your little monster for the first time, and it explains how all that works.

629
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I don't understand why they didn't just back the demo up 20 minutes and let you play through that little dungeon-y area

630
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
to the boss and then end the demo there. That was a poor, poor, poor decision.

631
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And, you know, it's causing some people to think twice about the game. Oops. Demos are important, y'all.

632
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
So, let's see, going to the chat room. Breakman says,

633
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Interesting is not a word that most listeners want to hear as a description of a game.

634
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Interest equals what the fuck was the dev thinking? Seriously, they could have done a better job.

635
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
But you're being as vague as apparently I am. Like, why do you think the dev was smoking crack?

636
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Or why do you think they could have done a better job? Maybe I'm missing something about that comment.

637
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I don't know, but I don't, you know, where's the part that I'm not catching, apparently?

638
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Again, those are live comments at our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

639
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Some other comments on the game in our chat room. Dungeonbuster says,

640
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Still liking the game right now, even with the issues, though I'm a big fan of Ghibli's stuff.

641
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Dungeonbuster also says, Battle system kind of falls apart later. The AI roles for your party members is kind of challenged.

642
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:29,000
You know, I am noticing that a little bit, that the party members are very liberal in their use of magic,

643
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
which is very unlike the style I play with, and I can see where that gets really frustrating, but

644
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I think it's manageable right now. And you always get to fill up on your HP and MP before a boss.

645
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:49,000
So I'm not, I'm not hating it as much as other people do.

646
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Let's see, LocoPoco says, I love Studio Ghibli, but honestly I didn't like the battle system in the demo at all.

647
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Well, you couldn't have, they didn't explain it.

648
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Let's see, RawSteelUT says, All BreakMan is saying is that interesting is what people tend to say when they can't be wholly complimentary.

649
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:12,000
See, I'm scared to be wholly complimentary because of, you know, what I'm seeing, or what I've heard about the future and so forth.

650
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:22,000
So I don't know, I am enjoying, yes, if I were to judge this game on the eight hours alone, I would say, yes, this is a must buy if you love JRPGs.

651
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
But then is that really fair?

652
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Would you judge it on white barf?

653
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Yes, and there are all these types of like little references and jokes that I love.

654
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Yes, there is a look for it in the grocery store in the very beginning of the game.

655
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
There's a little sign in the background that says, what does it say? Like, yay, milk, it's white barf or something like that.

656
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Like, what?

657
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
AkumaJP says, Without Ghibli, the game is just another rogue galaxy.

658
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
No, I don't agree. Sorry.

659
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I think it's, I mean, the Ghibli stuff lends itself great, but Studio Ghibli wasn't involved with Dragon Quest 8.

660
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And, you know, that was a lot of the similar things I like in both games.

661
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Anyhow, there you go. That's my thoughts. Take it or leave it.

662
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I'll let you know in next week, after another eight hours of the game, if I'm still as enthusiastic about the game as I am now.

663
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
For now, however, let us move on and talk about a little bit of housekeeping tonight.

664
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I want to start off with this tonight.

665
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Okay, so you know how we don't really ask for money here at Orange Lounge Radio.

666
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:35,000
We do this because, you know, we want to have fun and, you know, we just invite you guys here to spend the show with us.

667
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And, you know, it's more about the community and so forth.

668
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And we don't actually have these illusions that we're going to profit off the show or anything like that, right?

669
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Well, occasionally, once in a while, we get these awesome, unsolicited things.

670
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
So I want to share with you guys something that was donated to the show this week.

671
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
It wasn't money, but it's still pretty awesome. You guys want to see it?

672
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
So we got a gift this week, FedEx, here to the studio. So you ready?

673
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
All right.

674
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
No peeking!

675
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Okay. I hope it's chocolate, because I want some.

676
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
No peeking!

677
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
If you guessed rabid weasel, you are correct.

678
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I want a weasel.

679
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Booze. Someone sent us booze. That was Brad from Pod Culture, who also-

680
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Do not open this in front of me or I will throw up.

681
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I thought that might have actually been maple syrup for a second there.

682
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Oh, are you not a fan?

683
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Anything that's fake cinnamon, if I remotely smell it, makes me nauseous.

684
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Oh, look at that. I can't believe you would talk negatively about a gift so graciously.

685
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
No, no, no. I appreciate the gift. It's very nice. But anything that is-

686
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,000
For real, I'm the same way with spearmint. Like, anything that's real or fake spearmint, it makes me nauseous.

687
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Well, I'll say this more for me. That's fine by me.

688
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You're welcome to it.

689
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
That's fine by me.

690
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Okay, I'll try to smell it.

691
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
There you go. There you go. Anyhow, no, don't open it. Save it for $500.

692
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Brad from Pod Culture sent that. He also donated the mics that we use here on the show.

693
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Which we appreciate.

694
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:10,000
They're kind of hand-me-downs from Pod Culture, but they work great, obviously, as you can hear, and help the quality of our show immensely.

695
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,000
So, this is a nice big bottle of Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey, and he gave me some mixer ideas to use with this as well.

696
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
So, and it looks like it burned a hole in the back of the bottle. Hooray.

697
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Well, thank you. It was very nice of you to send it to us, and I will, um, I'll see if it makes me ill.

698
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I'll invite Rice Princess over for the 500th episode. She'll drink it. All right.

699
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Although, we should probably pick up some Goldschlager for that.

700
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Wait a minute. The Goldschlager is cinnamony, too.

701
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
It's butterscotch. Isn't Goldschlager butterscotch?

702
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I don't know. I always taste the cinnamon in me.

703
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Butterscotch. It's burning.

704
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Are you thinking, like, butternips?

705
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
It tastes like burning.

706
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I don't know. I'm thinking of Goldschlager.

707
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Goldschlager just tastes like burning.

708
00:35:51,000 --> 00:36:02,000
All right. Let's talk about something else, too, I want to do in housekeeping, and I want to talk about an article that was on our website that our pal Bobby Blackwolf posted that I thought was really good.

709
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And I don't like to talk about this subject a lot on our show because it keeps coming up as news, and I say for about the past four years, nothing this thing has done.

710
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,000
It has been gaming news, but G4 television kind of finally ended of sorts this week.

711
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Technically, I think they're still going to run off reruns for a couple months while they do that transition to the Esquire channel.

712
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:34,000
However, they did have a pretty awesome end to Attack of the Show with a little scene that tipped the hat back to tech TV, which I thought that was the way to end it.

713
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:50,000
But what I want to point out is that at vognetwork.com, Bobby, who does the show before us, did a great little article kind of reflecting back on the better days of G4 when it actually was kind of an extension of an online network about video games and things like that.

714
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And how that all started and kind of being in the community when all that was going on.

715
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Because I never knew that some of their shows had live chat rooms that you could go in and actually chat during the show and all that.

716
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:16,000
But anyway, Bobby and I have talked offline about some of that stuff, so I knew a few of the stories, but even in reading the article, I just kind of see it all in one place, and there was even a few things in there I didn't know about about his involvement early on.

717
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:30,000
So it was a really neat kind of reflection piece. It's not news so much as it is, hey, I was a big supporter of this network up until the day that they basically squashed tech TV, and it was a great read.

718
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
So check that out at vognetwork.com.

719
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Alright, let's move on now I guess into some video game news. I think that was all my housekeeping. Booze and G4. Alright, appropriate.

720
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Yes.

721
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Let's move on to what is going on this week in gaming. Loki.

722
00:37:47,000 --> 00:38:01,000
So one of the big things that happened this week was THQ's assets were finally auctioned off, and unfortunately their original plan to have one person buy everything and them kind of get out of debt just didn't happen.

723
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:10,000
So THQ is no more, and all of their assets have been split up. So here's what happened where everything went.

724
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:19,000
So first thing, Relic and Company of Heroes, the IP that Relic had, actually went to Sega.

725
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:27,000
So Sega is going to be doing that, which makes sense because they have some RTS franchises that they work on. So that should be cool.

726
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And then of course THQ Montreal, the studio as well as the two IPs, 1666 and underdog. Those went to Ubisoft. So they're going to have that now, as well as let's see Evolve which was an unannounced IP that I guess they're also saying it's called metamorphosis.

727
00:38:48,000 --> 00:39:02,000
That went to Take-Two, Volition and Saints Row, as well as I think it was just those two. So Volition, the studio, and Saints Row, and I'm assuming Red Faction and all that stuff.

728
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:09,000
That actually went to Koch, which is Deep Silver. That's the studio name you'd recognize.

729
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Homefront went to Crytek, which should be interesting if we get a sequel out of that.

730
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light, that went to Deep Silver as well. And then South Park, the Stick of Truth, the license for that went to Ubisoft. So they will be publishing that game later this year.

731
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,000
That game should have been almost done. That was slated to come out in what, April, right?

732
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It was March, but then it got pushed a little bit. It was supposed to be like second quarter. So the other one was the WWE franchise that went to Take-Two as well. So you're going to be seeing that coming out under the 2K Games license.

733
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
But none for Darksiders.

734
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Nothing for Darksiders.

735
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:02,000
A lot of people are very upset about that, which kind of surprised me, because if you think there would be enough upset people, somebody would have bought it.

736
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Well, from what I read, there was, I guess there were other franchises, the same, how was it, Vergil or Vigil was working out. Apparently that was also very risky, I guess, as far as an investment goes.

737
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:27,000
But you would think that they would, I would have thrown a dollar down for it, but you know, I don't know. Some of these actually, it's kind of funny what they paid for.

738
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Then you have to pay all those employees. A dollar might have bought you a studio, but then how do you pay the employees? That's the problem. Somebody's got to bankroll.

739
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Just buy the IP. Make a crappy cell phone game out of it or something. Resell it. I don't know.

740
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:51,000
So, yeah, no one bought it. Although it may, you know, go to someone else.

741
00:40:51,000 --> 00:41:01,000
The other thing, too, is we don't know who's going to end up with all of the back catalog stuff, because that didn't necessarily go to the respective publishers that bought the new franchises.

742
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:12,000
That's just the stuff that was coming out. Older games, that's going to go to completely different people. So, I'd be interested to see how that turns out.

743
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Rossdielut in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, considering Deep Silver's marketing ideas, I think Saints Row is in the right place.

744
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I don't know if that's a very tongue-in-cheek comment, but I just collectively groan at that because of that horrific story from last week with the quote-unquote sculpture.

745
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:40,000
But that's just a foreign company. I mean, that's just like Australia. I mean, they can get away with it, I think. Well, actually, I'm surprised they could kind of get away with that at all.

746
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
It was Britain, but that's all right. Still.

747
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It was Australia and Europe. I mean, whatever. I'm kind of glad, though. I mean, they're trying to, I guess, boost, I guess, their presence in the marketplace.

748
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And definitely, those are some game franchises that would do that. I'm not surprised to see, of course, Take Two not buying Saints Row because that would compete too much with Grand Theft Auto.

749
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And I was surprised, actually, EA didn't try to pick it up, but maybe they thought that, you know, they've got some of their own stuff and they would just crowd their lineup or something. I don't know.

750
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
That's true.

751
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:29,000
But they have Homefront. I mean, that's Crytek, and Crytek is published by EA. So, yay, another military shooter game to go along with the other two or three military shooter franchises that they own.

752
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I have to say somewhere in here, though, I like that the community has been so supportive of what's been going on at THQ. Like, you know, sometimes we see a lot of these layoffs happen, and it's not that the community doesn't improve.

753
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:52,000
The community has always been very good, but I'm just saying, like, sometimes it seems like what happens at the employee level is really cold. Like, there's a very cold treatment of what happens to people.

754
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And I kind of got the sense here that, like, you know, the CEO and a lot of people involved really, like, really felt bad. You know, even though I think a lot of people, you know, you didn't have to be a genius to see that something like this was coming, I got the sense that there was at least compassion for the people that were affected.

755
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:33,000
And certainly the community is like, you know, I've seen other game studios posting, hey, were you at THQ? No longer. You know, we're hiring right now. Come over here. You know, just a lot of, like, Twitter buzz, and I think that's great. I love that gamers are helping other gamers. You don't see that in a lot of areas of work, really. So I think that's really great that everybody's helping each other out.

756
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:49,000
How do you think about how this all went down? I mean, I guess it's not too surprising, but, Loki, what's kind of your impression of, like, you know, how now that we've seen where all the chips fall, do you think some of these properties are in danger? Do you think most of them found a good home or what?

757
00:43:49,000 --> 00:44:07,000
That'd be interesting to see what happens in Saints Row, because South Peak, I mean, they've put out a couple, you know, good franchises, but they don't really have a whole ton. Dead Rising was kind of a gamble they did, and some of the other stuff that they put out, you probably, I mean, hell, I don't even remember what they were. That's how memorable they were.

758
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I think Dead Rising's kind of already done, too. Like, you know, they tried to put out another one, and it's, like, you know, like... Well, not Dead Rising, I'm sorry, Dead Island. Yeah, you got me started, too. Dead Island.

759
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Yeah, Dead Rising's pretty much done. I mean, there'll be another one, but we know there's gonna be another one. But, you know, the last couple haven't been fantastic. At least we know the next Saints Row game will have a great trailer, if nothing else.

760
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I'm, you know, it's just a very over-the-top game. I would be interested to see what they're gonna do with it, but, yeah, I mean, South Peak doesn't have a whole lot going for it right now. They don't have a lot of stuff that they're publishing, so it would be kind of nice.

761
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
That we know about, to be fair.

762
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Normally, they don't have a lot that they're publishing. I mean, let's put it this way. Some of their last big games that they had were Two Worlds. That franchise, Two Worlds and Two Worlds 2, which didn't do very well.

763
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:10,000
And they also had, you know, of course, Dead Island, which did well for them. And a lot of other smaller titles that you'll never hear of. They've published some stuff for that.

764
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:20,000
But it's nice to see them actually have some good franchises now. Well, I mean, expanding their catalog, I guess.

765
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:28,000
So, that might be one I had to worry about a little bit, but I was worried about Saints Row IV anyways, when they're like,

766
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Yeah, we're gonna take this standalone game expansion that was really just gonna be Saints Row III with some other cheesy bullshit on top of it, and we're gonna make that its own game.

767
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Oh, and now we're gonna make that Saints Row IV. So, I'm already kind of worried about the game, just because of how they've treated it, especially with the DLC and stuff.

768
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Hopefully they build it into something good.

769
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,000
As long as they keep that humor. As long as they still have all the same writers, because Saints Row III is so fucking funny.

770
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I want to say, I was trying to, I should have looked real quick. What they bought it for, it was, man, if only you had the money.

771
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Oh yeah, because you got that kind of money lying around.

772
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I know, holy man.

773
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
It was only a couple million.

774
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Yeah, it was only 22.3 million.

775
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:32,000
You see something like Instagram sell for 1 billion dollars, then you see Saints Row goes for less than 1% of that. It's crazy.

776
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Well, like, let's see, the cheapest one they had was Homefront. They bought it for half a million dollars. The IP. I mean, I don't know.

777
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Alright, well, let's move on to a product now that was pretty much, it sounds like it's over after it barely just began, but it was a little piece of renaissance.

778
00:46:50,000 --> 00:47:01,000
It's the Neo Geo X. It's apparently ending production in Japan. Now, if you forgot what the Neo Geo X was, you know, I think we all remember what the Neo Geo was many years ago.

779
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
It was that very expensive brick of a system.

780
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I got a couple of them in my house.

781
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Well, and then they show up in arcade machines, right, and all that.

782
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,000
You know, it was awesome about having the memory card so you could save your game at the arcade and go home and play it.

783
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I'm surprised you didn't pick one of these up, these little Neo Geo X's.

784
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
There's no point. There's nothing on there that we didn't want that we don't already own.

785
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:28,000
So, well, you would have lost your chance now anyway, because apparently the production of it has come to a halt in Japan. These things just came out in December, so I don't know what's going on.

786
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
But anyhow, it's not actually discontinuing.

787
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Oh?

788
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
It's the limited-

789
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
What have you heard that I'm not hearing?

790
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Well, the limited edition is being discontinued. The one that comes with Ninja Master, but they're still producing it.

791
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I guess, you know, Blaze, which is one of the distributors, said that it's still being available.

792
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
It's just that the limited edition that was originally the launch lineup is no more.

793
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Was there a follow-up that I missed or something? Because I'm not seeing the-

794
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Yeah, they did a follow-up.

795
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:11,000
There was a few places around it, Eurogamer's one that had it, and I want to say, I'm trying to think, Engadget also had it.

796
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:20,000
They were saying that, I guess, I don't know. I know I read it, that they were- it wasn't quite discontinued.

797
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Well, I'm interested to see how long this can kind of- do you think something like this can sustain itself?

798
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Probably all-

799
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Since we all believe the fact that it would have disappeared as quick as it showed up.

800
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:37,000
It really should have. I mean, no offense, it's just- I mean, the handheld device itself, it's very similar to what I have with the Dingoo.

801
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:45,000
It's just like this ARM emulator thing that runs Neo Geo games. That's what the Dingoo did, and it does it for a lot cheaper.

802
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Just because it's SNK branded and it has this little thing that it plugs into so you can hook up to your TV.

803
00:48:52,000 --> 00:49:02,000
He did the same thing with the Dingoo, but it wasn't very, I don't know, pretty, I guess, because you had to have a cable going from your device to the TV.

804
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:21,000
But, no, apparently it is- yeah, it's still going, and even in the US, they said Tomo Inc., the company behind the Neo Geo X says the production hasn't seized on the main Neo Geo stand-alone handheld, but has ceased on the Neo Geo X Gold Limited Edition.

805
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
But that was the plan anyways.

806
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Well, maybe I wanted the Limited Edition.

807
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:33,000
And they're saying they're going to add more games and peripherals and software updates.

808
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:43,000
GameGuru in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says they should just put out the Neo Geo games on PC like Sega does for Genesis games.

809
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
A few of them are on Wii Virtual Console.

810
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Aren't some of them on PlayStation 3 as well? I believe so. I think PlayStation 3 has a few of those games and they're not PS1 classics, obviously, but like a similar classics library.

811
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I think they call it like SNK Collection.

812
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
You do see those Neo Geo games kind of pop up other places.

813
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
But, correct, I don't think PC is one of them.

814
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Although, you know, you just like download MAME.

815
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Not that I told you to do that, but we all know.

816
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Alright. Let's move on with more news. DarkSakura.

817
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Okay. Well, now we know that there's been rumors going around about what is going to be the new Xbox.

818
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
And we know that there was that completely fabricated story.

819
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:33,000
So, this though is actually what I found was looking to be quite a bit different.

820
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
They're actually talking about specs up for the system itself.

821
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Talking about it under the code name Durango.

822
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I don't, again, I don't know if it has anything to do with the rumor.

823
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
We take everything with a huge grain of salt when it comes to these type of rumors.

824
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Yeah, especially since that other story was fabricated.

825
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
But, you know, it's quite a bit different.

826
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:00,000
So, they're saying that it's code named Durango and that they have a little bit of the tech saying that it's supposed to run on an 8 core CPU.

827
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
An AMD CPU at 1.6 gigahertz.

828
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Just like the new PlayStation thing.

829
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,000
And that it's running on the Jaguar technology.

830
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And apparently it's supposed to be working with a 32 meg of RAM and 8 gigabytes of memory.

831
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
It looks like, I think, the graphic memory.

832
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
So, it's looking pretty, pretty big.

833
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I mean, again, I don't know if this is actually true.

834
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
But it seems to make sense and looks pretty impressive.

835
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
To be fair, Microsoft does have a history of stuff leaking out.

836
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Now, we do know there was that guy on Tumblr that was all,

837
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I'm so sick of people making shit up about Microsoft rumors.

838
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I'm going to make shit up about Microsoft and spread it all over the internet to prove a point.

839
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Alright, dude. Point made.

840
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
But, you know, so there's all that fake stuff out there.

841
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
But you don't also know what they say.

842
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Where there's smoke, there's fire.

843
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
And these are the types of things people are talking about and speculating and so forth.

844
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
So, aside from saying this is true, because we don't know if it's true or not,

845
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
what do you think about if it was true?

846
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Do you think this could be the direction that Microsoft should be going in?

847
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Because I'll tell you this.

848
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
That crap that was made up on the Tumblr and all that, that sounded awful.

849
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I mean, I should say it sounded cool.

850
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
But in reality, the whole tablet being that much integrated into the,

851
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
it just didn't sound feasible.

852
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
It just wasn't going to work.

853
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
This doesn't sound outside the realm of possibility, honestly.

854
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
This didn't say anything about the tablet at all.

855
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It just talked about running power.

856
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
It also was comparing it with the Orbis graphics for the new PlayStation.

857
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
And saying that still the Orbis is turning out to be probably more powerful

858
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
in terms of graphic capability than the new Xbox.

859
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
It sounds almost pretty much what I expected, anyway.

860
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,000
They're going to go with, I think, more of processing with,

861
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I think, more in terms of how the Xbox is now.

862
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I mean, focus on the games, how they play, not necessarily exactly how they look.

863
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Which Sony has always been about Flash.

864
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Well, it'll be interesting to see.

865
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
But at the end of the day, we won't really know until E3.

866
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
But more speculation to continue until then.

867
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Look around E3 a week, though,

868
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
because didn't Microsoft's entire presentation get blown

869
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
like the morning of their press conference or something this last year?

870
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
The Halo 4 stuff all leaked out or something?

871
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Yeah.

872
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
It was either this year or last year.

873
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
It just all went on the internet the day of or something.

874
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
It was crazy.

875
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Anyhow, more news, Logie.

876
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,000
All right, so kind of a similar thing with the PlayStation 3.

877
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Kotaku apparently received some documentation.

878
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
90 PDFs, they say.

879
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Wow, that's a lot of PDFs.

880
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
And this is being released by an individual known as SuperDAE,

881
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
which you may remember was one of the guys that

882
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
sold one of the Xbox development kits, the brand new ones for the next system,

883
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
on eBay, or at least attempted to sell one.

884
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
And some of the details coming from that spec-wise.

885
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Of course, they're saying that it's going to have 8 gigs of RAM,

886
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
or 2.2 gigabytes of video RAM.

887
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:30,000
They're going to have a CPU that's built out of four dual-core AMD 64 bulldozer processors,

888
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
so a total of eight cores.

889
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
A GPU that's AMD R10XX.

890
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:42,000
They haven't really said what kind of GPU yet, but something around that spec.

891
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Four USB 3.0 ports, two Ethernet ports, a Blu-ray drive, of course.

892
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Why not?

893
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
And a 160 gigabyte hard drive.

894
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:02,000
As well as, they're saying, HDMI optical 2.0, 5.1, and 7.1 channel sound,

895
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,000
which is pretty much similar to what they have right now with the PlayStation 3.

896
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
The controller, they're not really saying too much about it.

897
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
It could change.

898
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
They're saying that the difference right now with the controller

899
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
is it's going to be similar to the Vita.

900
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
They're at least going to add some sort of touch sensor to the Vita.

901
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I think Robin mentioned that's probably that stupid back touch panel thing.

902
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
God, I hope not. It's going to be a waste of time.

903
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
But right now, they're saying that it's got...

904
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Stop trying to make back touch happen.

905
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Some sort of touch pad on there.

906
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Maybe even another...

907
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I don't know if they're going to have an actual screen or something on that.

908
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
They're also doing something with the account management right now,

909
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:58,000
where you're going to be able to, I guess, link local accounts together.

910
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I don't really know what that's supposed to do as far as maybe...

911
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I don't know if you're downloading...

912
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Maybe it's just like, okay, X and X people are on this console.

913
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
You downloaded DLC, both of you get it.

914
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I don't know if that really works.

915
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I mean, isn't that how it kind of works now?

916
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Is that supposed to be non-intentional that,

917
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
oh, because I downloaded some DLC on this console,

918
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,000
it's not supposed to be available to this other person?

919
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I don't know.

920
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Could this be all angsty Tumblr person made up too?

921
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I don't think so because the guy has had access to what at least was supposed to be a kit.

922
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:45,000
This is supposed to be coming from a developer kit for the next PlayStation system.

923
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,000
A lot of this could change, but it's just getting closer to the specs right now.

924
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I don't think you're really going to know until the system comes out,

925
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
but everyone wants to speculate.

926
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:02,000
If you compare this to the Durango Xbox lube specs,

927
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
they're both very similar.

928
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Eight core processors, you're going to have a pretty high-end video card in there,

929
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:16,000
eight gigs of RAM, HDMI, USB 3.0 stuff, and Blu-ray.

930
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
So they're both pretty similar as far as that goes.

931
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
It's going to be, I guess, how they use that.

932
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
It's really going to determine which system is better.

933
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Or they're both going to be about the same as they are now.

934
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Well, following up with this a little bit and kind of piggybacking on some things

935
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
we were talking about at the end of 2012.

936
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
We did a list list right at the end of the year where we were saying,

937
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
what do you guys think is the biggest prediction in gaming for 2013?

938
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
And one of the things I put out there that was kind of like half funny

939
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
but half serious thing is I thought there would be no PlayStation 4 this year,

940
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
even though everybody's kind of expecting it with the new Xbox.

941
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
And it was actually voted as the top answer by the listeners.

942
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Well, an interesting story this week makes that sound like it may not have been

943
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
that far off of a prediction.

944
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Read into this what you will, but Kazurai, Sony's CEO,

945
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
talked to the Times this week.

946
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
And in the business section mentioned kind of in passing

947
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
that they're waiting to see what Microsoft does before making any announcements

948
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
regarding PlayStation 4.

949
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Harai goes as far as to say they're going to let Microsoft make the first move.

950
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I don't know how much of that is kind of like paraphrasing or what.

951
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
But anyway, the quote from the original article is,

952
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
why go first when your competitors can look at your specifications

953
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
and come up with something better?

954
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Now, you might remember last time, Sony did go after Microsoft.

955
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Microsoft had the jump last time.

956
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
They were a year ahead of the other guys.

957
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,000
This time around, Nintendo went first, but Nintendo's kind of

958
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
marching to their own little beat now.

959
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Yeah, you can't really compare that because spec-wise

960
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
they're just a little ahead of the presentation.

961
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
We pat them on the head and go, oh, Nintendo.

962
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Well, and they do what works for them.

963
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
A story I don't think is coming up on tonight's show,

964
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
but I was reading a little bit about beforehand was,

965
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
what were the top 20 selling games in Japan last year?

966
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
They're like all Nintendo games.

967
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
There's no Xbox, of course, because it's Japan.

968
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
There's a spittering of PlayStation 3.

969
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I think Resident Evil 6 was in there.

970
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
There was a random PSP game that was some robot game.

971
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
But most of it is Nintendo.

972
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Here's my thought.

973
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I know Japan's a pretty decent-sized market,

974
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,000
but aren't they kind of declining as far as their market share

975
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
in the whole big span of everything worldwide,

976
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
console sales and game sales.

977
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Pretty soon that's not going to matter.

978
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:40,000
It's like, okay, here's how the purchasing goes in Australia.

979
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,000
It's not going to matter that the consoles don't do well in there, I think.

980
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Other interesting comment from chat here,

981
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
talking about the PlayStation 4.

982
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Rasteel UT says, especially with Sony,

983
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:00,000
who can ill afford another $599 US dollar fiasco.

984
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Piggybacking on that, maybe wait for some of the tech to become cheaper

985
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
before they launch their system.

986
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Starting it out there.

987
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
What do you think in hearing what he says?

988
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Now, I want to say I saw something else that came out after this

989
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
that was kind of like that Sony's,

990
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
this doesn't mean that we're not going to do something competitive or whatever,

991
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
because obviously they want to keep investors happy,

992
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
but what do you think this all means, Loki?

993
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Do you think there might be actual reason for there not to show the PlayStation 4 this year?

994
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Do you think that might actually come to light?

995
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I don't know if they're going to show it or not,

996
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
but I don't think that they can really wait too long.

997
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
If you think about it, they can't really make their system spec-wise

998
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
so much greater than the X.

999
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I mean, they're not going to do that, for one, because of cost,

1000
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,000
and two, because when these games are being put out on multi-platforms,

1001
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
which they're probably going to,

1002
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
you're not going to really see that much of a benefit to having additional,

1003
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I mean, I guess additional power, the game might play a little bit better,

1004
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,000
but most of the time they're going to be developing it across the board.

1005
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
It's going to be similar.

1006
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
I mean, if you look at the PlayStation 3 versus the Xbox 360,

1007
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
wasn't the PlayStation 3 supposed to be a more powerful system,

1008
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
yet a lot of the games that come out on the PlayStation 3 chug

1009
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,000
and just don't even have the frame rate that the Xbox 360 games do?

1010
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
So I don't know.

1011
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
I think that they should take the safe approach, actually,

1012
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:30,000
and I'm kind of wondering what they're going to do with extra things

1013
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,000
or gimmicks with these controllers because it didn't work with 6-axis.

1014
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
They tried to make it happen. It just wasn't working,

1015
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:42,000
and I don't think touch controls are really going to add anything either.

1016
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
It's just going to be annoying.

1017
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
And Move hasn't really taken off either,

1018
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
even though Move is actually one of the better motion controls.

1019
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Yeah, I think it is actually pretty good.

1020
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
It's very accurate.

1021
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,000
In fact, I was trying to play a Kinect party today to show my son this stuff,

1022
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:02,000
and we have a window behind in the view of the Kinect,

1023
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
and it wasn't working because there was sun outside.

1024
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:11,000
And so Kinect was saying, fuck you, I am not working.

1025
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,000
So yeah, it seems like the Move stuff works pretty good.

1026
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,000
But even Nelly was like, so is this supposed to be some big motion controller thing?

1027
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I'm like, yeah, the next one that comes out will probably be way better.

1028
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
This is just the first generation of it.

1029
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:30,000
But then they never work as good as they say they're going to. Never.

1030
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,000
That's why I'm going to wait because I've already been fooled three or four times.

1031
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Interesting perspective from Akuma JP in our chat room who actually lives in Japan.

1032
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:46,000
AkumaJP at live.vognetwork.com saying, yeah, almost all mobile phone now.

1033
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Even Tokyo Game Show from last year was all gree, mobage, all mobile now.

1034
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Even we all now almost all mobile, which I want to say when I looked at that list,

1035
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
it was a lot of 3DS stuff you even saw there.

1036
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Yeah, and portable, which it doesn't surprise me.

1037
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:08,000
It's a different culture in Japan, very different.

1038
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,000
A lot more of the commuters than you might have here and so forth.

1039
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:18,000
And just especially in places like Tokyo, smaller living spaces.

1040
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Connect just doesn't fucking work there.

1041
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
So handhelds are the way to go.

1042
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
So just different.

1043
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
But the sad thing is we got a lot of mobile stuff here, too.

1044
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
But I don't want to see mobile replace gaming.

1045
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
There's a lot that mobile can't do.

1046
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Although, ironically enough, we have an interesting story tonight

1047
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:43,000
about an online type of game that's trying to emulate console a little more.

1048
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
But there's so much that mobile can't do.

1049
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
It just can't give you that same experience.

1050
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
I don't know.

1051
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,000
He also explains mobage as a mobile game.

1052
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Oh, I see. It was an abbreviation.

1053
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Well, let's move on. Dark Sakura.

1054
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
As soon as I can get it.

1055
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
I'm on my iPad again.

1056
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Okay, well, this is a game I brought up during what I was playing.

1057
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And I just played a little bit of it this week because, honestly, I wanted a nap.

1058
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
It's called Chompston, and it's a mix of Pac-Man and Bomberman.

1059
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Wait, so you're saying this game put you to sleep?

1060
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,000
No, I was sleepy already.

1061
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,000
The game is actually the sound effects work in time with the music.

1062
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Kind of like how great now I can't think of the puzzle game.

1063
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Luminous.

1064
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Exactly.

1065
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Kind of like how Luminous did.

1066
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,000
So as you get the dots and throw bombs, it works in time with the music.

1067
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
The music of the game is actually pretty neat.

1068
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
But you get different kinds of enemies.

1069
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Like you have these purple ghosts that can walk through bombs

1070
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,000
and red enemies that shoot fireballs at you and green ones that are really fast.

1071
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,000
But as you go trying to collect your little rainbow dots, you can drop bombs

1072
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
and explode exactly like they do in Bomberman.

1073
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
And you get different power-ups for them as well.

1074
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,000
It's really neat, but you download the game at,

1075
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
and I'm going to have to say out the site,

1076
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,000
contralogic.com slash games slash Chompston.

1077
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
C-H-O-M-P-S-T-O-N.

1078
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
It's definitely worth your time.

1079
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:24,000
It's a fun game, and it gets tricky, so support them.

1080
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
All right.

1081
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates

1082
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
if for whatever reason you've already worn out Chompston

1083
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
and you want to check out something else this week.

1084
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
What's coming out to a store near you?

1085
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
It's not a whole lot this week.

1086
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:44,000
It's pretty much the Hitman HD trilogy on PS3 and Xbox 360.

1087
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Also, if you were looking for a new PlayStation 3 console,

1088
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
they have the new 500-gigabyte one,

1089
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
the one that came with the instant game collection,

1090
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
basically the PlayStation Plus for a year.

1091
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Well, they have that now in white in case you didn't want a black console,

1092
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:05,000
and that's pretty much it.

1093
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Also, it was supposed to be this week a heavy fire shattered spear,

1094
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
but that probably got delayed

1095
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:17,000
because massive games never fucking come out on time.

1096
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Let's travel to Japan and check out what's coming out in Japan.

1097
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
If anything, it's been kind of slow lately.

1098
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Well, there's one thing on the radar on the Xbox 360.

1099
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Love, Tori, bitter version in limited and regular edition.

1100
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
That's your lone Xbox 360 release, but we already talked about Xbox.

1101
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
I completely misheard you say that.

1102
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I thought you said toire, which means toilet.

1103
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Oh, no, no.

1104
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:48,000
On PlayStation 3, Excel World, Kasoku no Choten,

1105
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
also in regular and limited editions from Bandai Namco comes out this week.

1106
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:57,000
FIFA Street gets a price reduction, and in Japan this week, PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.

1107
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I didn't realize they didn't get the game when we did,

1108
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
but they are now getting their version this week on the PlayStation 3.

1109
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
January 31st is when you can expect to see that.

1110
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
On the Vita this week, also PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale,

1111
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:15,000
and Sengoku Hime 3, Tenka o Kirisaku Hikari Tokage comes out in regular and limited edition

1112
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
because, you know, they love their limited editions over there.

1113
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
And unlike over here, their limited editions actually get filled most of the time.

1114
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Oh, I'll get into that later.

1115
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
And usually have better stuff.

1116
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
On the Wii U, yes, there is a Wii U release this week.

1117
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:34,000
It's Shen Hokuro Musou comes out this week, and we're trying to see what this is.

1118
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Is this Fist of the North Star, for fuck's sake?

1119
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Hold on, pull up the thing. Yeah.

1120
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Yeah, it's Fist of the North Star, Ken's Rage 2.

1121
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Oh, good lord.

1122
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
You can always count on another Fist of the North Star game.

1123
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,000
How long has Fist of the North Star been out, like, since 1979?

1124
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
No, I'm serious. I know, I know.

1125
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
I think it's been out that, like, Hokuto no Ken's been out that long.

1126
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Well, it's coming out on Xbox 360 in two weeks.

1127
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Do you remember Punch Mania, the Hokuto no Ken version of Punch Mania?

1128
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
I do. I do.

1129
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
That was great.

1130
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I guess it was fun.

1131
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,000
But it's just, it's funny to me that, like, you know, that's all the Wii U's got on it,

1132
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
is a franchise from 1979 coming out this week.

1133
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Alright, but look, those games are still popular in all seriousness.

1134
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
I want one of those at my house.

1135
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
They sell for a reason.

1136
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Mildly popular.

1137
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Alright, let's go to UK.

1138
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
On the 29th, we have Let's Fish Hooked On for the Vita.

1139
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:34,000
We have on the 30th, Skulls of the Shogun, which is coming out for Xbox 360, PC, and the Windows Phone.

1140
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I just thought that was interesting.

1141
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,000
On the 31st, Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed for PC.

1142
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Yay.

1143
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:48,000
And then on February 1st, we have Hitman trilogy, Hitman HD trilogy, sorry,

1144
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
and Ni No Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch.

1145
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
That's it.

1146
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Alright, just a few more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

1147
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
But first, Loki.

1148
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:09,000
So, um, yeah, apparently the whole pay-to-win thing with EA is still continuing.

1149
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:16,000
And now, Dead Space fans, you know, fans of a very hardcore franchise are so happy to find out that,

1150
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
hey, guess what?

1151
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Microtransactions are here. Yay.

1152
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Free-to-play microtransactions.

1153
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:27,000
And apparently they say the reason this is happening is because mobile gamers, mobile gamers, yes,

1154
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:33,000
there are a lot of players out there, especially players coming from mobile games who are accustomed to microtransactions.

1155
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
They're like, I need this now, and I want this now.

1156
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:43,000
And they'll need instant gratification, so we included an option in order to attract those players.

1157
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:52,000
So if they're like, oh, I need 5,000 Tugston, because I'm short on this upgrade, they can have it.

1158
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,000
We need to make sure that we're expanding our audience as well.

1159
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Yes, so that's the way you expand your audience, is you have microtransactions in your fucking game, because mobile.

1160
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
It doesn't expand your audience, because think about it.

1161
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
People aren't going to buy this game because they have microtransactions in it.

1162
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:16,000
All you're doing is saying, hey, people that are used to paying microtransactions for stuff may buy this microtransaction stuff in our game.

1163
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:21,000
That is some dumbass logic this guy is using. I'm sorry.

1164
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:27,000
The games industry is in trouble if that's the way that people making decisions are really thinking.

1165
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Just say, we're putting it in the game because people are dumb enough to buy it.

1166
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
That's the reality.

1167
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:40,000
We want to make free money, and we think because of mobile games, people are dumb enough to buy it.

1168
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Mobile games coming over to console, what the fuck backwards logic is that?

1169
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Everybody is saying it's supposedly going the other way.

1170
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Everybody's going to mobile.

1171
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:57,000
They're not suddenly going to come over to console because you're designing the game so that they can spend more money.

1172
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I guarantee that there is nobody on the face of the planet that says, hey, you know what?

1173
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,000
I like this game because there's microtransactions in it.

1174
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
You know what else mobile games have going for them?

1175
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
They're 99 cents.

1176
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
That's a huge difference.

1177
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Why don't you middle managers understand this?

1178
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Volume. That's where you make your money. Volume.

1179
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
And people are dumb enough to buy it.

1180
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Even if one person buys it, it's three bucks they didn't have before.

1181
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
And you see EA doing this in a lot of their games.

1182
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
They were the first to do it.

1183
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
They used to put out, they had cheats in their games, and then guess what?

1184
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
They stopped having cheats in their games.

1185
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
The Godfather game had cheats in it.

1186
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Oh, but guess what?

1187
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,000
When you buy it on the Xbox 360, you're actually going to have to buy those cheats in game.

1188
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Bobby on his show tonight, when we were on the phone call at the end,

1189
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
was talking about SimCity and how he was playing the beta,

1190
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
and was saying how he didn't have enough simoleons or whatever

1191
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
to do some of the things he wanted to do.

1192
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I said, oh, I bet you could probably log into the EA store when the game comes out

1193
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,000
and get 100,000 simoleons for $2.99.

1194
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,000
And you're right. That's the type of thing that you used to type a cheat code in to get and unlock.

1195
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Of course, because here's the thing.

1196
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Why wouldn't they do this?

1197
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
If you think about it, if you're making a game,

1198
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:17,000
why wouldn't you miss out on the opportunity to make a little bit more money?

1199
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Which also is the real reason that game is all online DRM.

1200
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Don't fucking kid yourself.

1201
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
All this stuff about, you know, the interaction with other people.

1202
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

1203
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
It's to sell you this shit.

1204
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
So that way, the cheat codes can't happen offline.

1205
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
But wait, hackers will get it.

1206
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,000
And sadly, that's the only way these guys are going to learn their lesson.

1207
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:45,000
And then they'll, oh, but the hackers are so mean to us.

1208
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
We lost all this money on the game and it was the hackers' fault.

1209
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Please, please, yeah, I'm sure that so many people out there pirated The Sims 3

1210
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,000
because that's why they released so many fucking expansions to this game.

1211
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:05,000
I mean, if it wasn't doing well, they wouldn't release 90,000 expansions for The Sims 3.

1212
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Well, you saw how many came out for Sims 2 back in the day.

1213
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I never paid for one.

1214
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
But I'm telling you, though, that people buy this

1215
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:20,000
and they're not just like, you know, for 70s, 80s, and 90s stuff that just came out.

1216
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
It's like 20 bucks and you get crap for your house.

1217
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Twenty dollars for not even really a huge game expansion.

1218
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Forty dollars for a really big expansion like going to a university life that's coming out in March.

1219
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I mean, they literally have one or two expansions a month coming out for this stuff.

1220
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
It's just, it's ridiculous.

1221
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
And you know why they're doing it?

1222
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
It's because people are buying them.

1223
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I mean, seriously, you're a company looking to make money.

1224
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
You're looking to stay alive.

1225
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
What are you going to do?

1226
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,000
If people are buying DLC stuff, you're going to put it in your game.

1227
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
You're going to have these microtransactions in there because people buy them.

1228
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
People may bitch about them online, but you know what?

1229
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
At the end of the day, people are buying them.

1230
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
If they weren't buying them, they wouldn't put it in the game.

1231
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Alright, well, this may be the way some other game companies go if they don't learn to evolve to what people really want.

1232
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,000
You know, because this company apparently couldn't do it and it's very unfortunate.

1233
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Atari Inc. filed for Chapter 11, Restructuring Bankruptcy, this week.

1234
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:33,000
And it is trying to basically separate itself from Atari S.A., which is the French parent company, and be its own independent business.

1235
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,000
But of course, you know, that's not how they really reported on CNN.

1236
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Everybody else says, Atari went bankrupt this week. Remember Pong?

1237
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
People are dumb.

1238
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Atari's bankrupt. I'm going to miss Pong.

1239
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Combat?

1240
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I mean, let's be real, guys. A lot of that Atari that we know went away with the game crash in 84.

1241
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
What did Atari recently have going for it, you know?

1242
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Alone in the Dark.

1243
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Test Drive Unlimited.

1244
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Retro Arcade Releases.

1245
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Okay, let me rephrase.

1246
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
What did Atari have going for it that THQ didn't?

1247
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Alone in the Dark.

1248
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
You're missing my point.

1249
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
This is kind of happening to a lot of these guys, you know?

1250
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
It's not enough?

1251
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
They had Dragon Ball Z for a while.

1252
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:34,000
They also had what? Oh god, I will forever associate this with modern Atari.

1253
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:40,000
It was the Driver 3 on PlayStation, that buggy as hell game.

1254
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Wasn't that them?

1255
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Was it them or Midway? I can't remember.

1256
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
I think it was them. It was Atari.

1257
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
So, anyhow.

1258
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,000
But Driver 3 was fantastic. It is a pinnacle of buggy-ass games.

1259
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:59,000
I wouldn't really think this means that Atari is like totally going away in all this.

1260
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Although, okay, if you want to really follow things...

1261
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Let's see, where was it?

1262
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:10,000
It was Atari, then it was GT Interactive, and then GT Interactive became Infogrames.

1263
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
And that's when the French side of it came in.

1264
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,000
And then Infogrames bought Hasbro Interactive, which acquired Atari.

1265
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:21,000
And then Infogrames changed their name to Atari, and they used the Atari name in the logo.

1266
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:27,000
So, yeah. Atari, as it is now, wasn't even the same company as it was before anyway.

1267
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:33,000
It's probably just going to evolve again, and maybe they'll find their next big thing. I don't know.

1268
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:41,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on VogueNetwork.com, use the passphrase STRAW.

1269
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Well, let's go back to a more classic time when Atari was like, you know...

1270
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:51,000
That was like Nintendo, or Sony, or when it was Atari.

1271
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Actually, this game may not be that old. Or maybe it is. Actually, I think you did pick a game that old this week. Close. Really close.

1272
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Pretty decently old.

1273
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Alright. Well, there was no Infogrames or GT involved with Atari when this game came out.

1274
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
It's a classic game of the week.

1275
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Dark Soccer is going to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you kids should be playing this game.

1276
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Well, it's not as old as Hokuto no Ken, which, thanks for, I forget who said it, came out in 83.

1277
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Rygar is the game of the week. It came out by Tecmo in 1986, and it was an arcade game called Arcus no Senshi.

1278
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Which means, I mean, you pretty much play as the legendary warrior, and you're getting attacked on all sides.

1279
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:45,000
And you use this disc armor weapon that's basically a shield with a long chain attached to it.

1280
01:17:46,000 --> 01:18:01,000
And, basically, I always think that it's kind of like their, what's the word I'm trying to think of, their derivative of Rastan.

1281
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
It's the same type of platforming game.

1282
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:17,000
But it came out, basically, you play as a guy named Rygar, who is a dead warrior who rose from his grave.

1283
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Aha!

1284
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:26,000
You use the disc armor and other weapons to try to stop this guy named Rygar, who took over the land of Arghor.

1285
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:39,000
So, you just go through and you basically shoot people, and you shoot animals, and you shoot spiders, and you shoot dragons, and you shoot midgets.

1286
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Now, I want to say real quick, and you'll probably get into this in a minute, but a lot of people in chat are like, oh, I remember this game on the NES.

1287
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,000
But you're actually talking about the arcade version of Rygar, which was very, very different.

1288
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Yes, I am.

1289
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,000
But I don't know if you'll get into the NES one at all, and why it was different, but yeah.

1290
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Hold your horses!

1291
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Keep your pants on!

1292
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
I wanted our chatters to pay attention. Don't run away yet.

1293
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Meh.

1294
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Well, at any rate, as I was getting to, the game was imported to the Sharp X68000, the Commodore 64, the Sega Master System, but that was only in Japan.

1295
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
It was called Argus no Jujiken.

1296
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:21,000
It came out for the ZX Spectrum, 48K, the Amstrad 6128, and the Atari Lynx.

1297
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:29,000
And then, on the Xbox, it was included in a compilation that was the type of classic arcade, and now there is a Wii Virtual Console version as well.

1298
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
That's the arcade version.

1299
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Now, the Atari Lynx is probably the closest to the arcade version.

1300
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
That's weird.

1301
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Let me finish.

1302
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,000
However, it did have some different rounds.

1303
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
There were only 23 rounds, but it was supposed to be pretty close to the arcade version.

1304
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
I think I actually have it.

1305
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:54,000
I just don't think of Atari Lynx as like the arcade accurate system ever, you know.

1306
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
You'd be surprised.

1307
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
The one on Xbox was, I actually have that collection you're talking about.

1308
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
It's not bad, but it's also not 360 hours compatible.

1309
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Sucks.

1310
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Yeah.

1311
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:15,000
At any rate, it also came out on the NES, and it was released as Argus no Senshi Hachamecha Daishengeki.

1312
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,000
That's kind of a tongue twister.

1313
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Anyway, it was basically a platform action RPG, and it was quite a bit different.

1314
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Basically, you go through different settings to try to kill the evil king Lygar Blaw, who was on the planet of Argul, which was Argus in Japan.

1315
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:48,000
And then you have to visit the five gods who give you different items, and you go through different realms, and they all have a boss, and all this fun stuff.

1316
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
But yeah, it's a little bit different.

1317
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:57,000
With the difference in the versions, the arcade version is more side-scrolling.

1318
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:03,000
The NES one is an open-ended action-adventure game, sort of Metroidvania-like.

1319
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:10,000
And at the start of the game, you have access to some of the worlds, and then you get the other worlds opened up as you go.

1320
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:18,000
You also had permanent power-ups in the NES version, and different experience points you could use.

1321
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:26,000
There was a new sequel that came out, Rygar the Legendary Adventure, that came out on PS2.

1322
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:33,000
And it was a transition to 3D-style gameplay, and it was pretty much rated okay.

1323
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,000
And there is a Wii port that came out in 2007.

1324
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:42,000
So there you go. Rygar. The arcade version is the best one.

1325
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I like the NES one. The NES one had a great soundtrack. That's what I really liked about it.

1326
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,000
But they're so different. I mean, they really should just be considered two separate games.

1327
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
The arcade one is so different from the NES one.

1328
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Well, look at Strider in the arcade and on the Genesis.

1329
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
And then the NES one. The NES one was actually based off the Strider manga.

1330
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Okay, yeah. That is a very good comparison.

1331
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:06,000
The Rygar games are that different, like the Strider games are.

1332
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
That's a very good comparison.

1333
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,000
See, I love the NES Strider, but I know you think it's shit because you have that Genesis...

1334
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,000
No, I didn't say I think it's shit. It's just a different game.

1335
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,000
There's like this one jump in that game that's super stupid to make.

1336
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Oh, the triangle jump?

1337
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Yeah. But I liked it because it was based off the...

1338
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
I like the story in it because it's based off the Strider manga.

1339
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
You know, it's basically telling that whole story.

1340
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:36,000
But I tend to think that the platformer is more fun, in my opinion.

1341
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
And the same way with Rygar.

1342
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I like, you know, the hack and slash.

1343
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
I kind of like them both, myself.

1344
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
I kind of like them both. They're two different games.

1345
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
You know, it's like me saying that I like playing Donkey Kong and Tetris.

1346
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,000
No, you must pick one. This is gaming culture. There's no room for ties.

1347
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Bite my ass.

1348
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
If you please.

1349
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
One must be better, DarkSakura. How dare you?

1350
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Don't you understand? This is the foundation that all internet video game media is based on.

1351
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
You can't have a tie.

1352
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Yeah, but I have a personality disorder.

1353
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Alright.

1354
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
It's called honoree.

1355
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Alright, we're going to take a break. On that note, we're going to take a break.

1356
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,000
And when we come back with Orange Lounge Radio, we've got more, yet again, more on Disney Infinity tonight.

1357
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Geez, Loki. It just doesn't stop with the Disney Infinity news.

1358
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,000
And Nintendo had an avalanche of news this week. We're going to talk all about that and get into that.

1359
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:37,000
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, your phone calls, your emails, and much more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1360
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live on this January the 27th, 2013, episode number 491 in progress.

1361
01:23:53,000 --> 01:24:00,000
And we're going to start off this part of the show with some rapid fire news. If you're ready, Loki, take it away.

1362
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Sure.

1363
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Alright, so let's talk a little bit about Disney Infinity. Of course, can't go another show without talking more Disney Infinity.

1364
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:15,000
They're going to actually put out lots of content, which is kind of a duh.

1365
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:24,000
And I've actually heard some people saying, you know, hey, we might not actually see any more standalone games from Disney Interactive now that they have this Disney Infinity thing.

1366
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,000
And that kind of seems somewhat true.

1367
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Didn't they close a lot of that?

1368
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Yeah, they did.

1369
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Because the whole like, there was not jokes, but commentary going around about how there won't be another split second or what that racing game and you know.

1370
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Yeah, because Black Rocks, I think.

1371
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Yeah, yeah.

1372
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
So that's too bad.

1373
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,000
But yeah, they've got quite a bit coming out. In fact, so much I'm about to tell you about.

1374
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,000
And this isn't exactly all out there yet.

1375
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:01,000
So let's see here. Let's talk, let's see, Disney Infinity.

1376
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:13,000
And we've got, I know at launch, you've got the starter packs, which have, you know, of course, the three main characters of each of the adventure packs that are in there.

1377
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:23,000
So you've got Mr. Incredible and Captain Jack Sparrow and Sully from Monsters Inc and Monsters U.

1378
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:39,000
And then, of course, to go with that, they've got a bunch of other side characters, including, you know, in the Incredibles universe, Dash, Mrs. Incredible, Violet and Syndrome, Monsters U.

1379
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:46,000
They've got Mike and Randall, Pirates of the Caribbean, Captain Barboza and Davy Jones.

1380
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:55,000
They're also going to be doing some additional playsets. Zorro and Kars are going to be the first two playsets that are launched alongside this as well.

1381
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:02,000
And with Zorro, you're going to get Zorro and Tonto and then Kars, Lightning McQueen and I can't remember who else.

1382
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
It might be Flo, yeah.

1383
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:10,000
And then, of course, they're going to have some triple packs in case you want to get a few characters at a time.

1384
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Sidekicks and Villains are going to be the two themes of those.

1385
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,000
And then I know one of the questions was, hey, when are we going to see Mickey Mouse?

1386
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:23,000
And you're not going to wait that long. September is when you're going to see Mickey Mouse as a standalone character.

1387
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I'm not sure. The garb that they had the picture of was Sorcerer's Apprentice.

1388
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:34,000
So I'm not sure if it's going to be Sorcerer's Apprentice, Mickey, or if it may even be its own adventure set by then.

1389
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,000
We'll see. I think Phineas and Ferb is somewhere during the summer.

1390
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:42,000
And then fall, you're going to get Frozen, the play set for that, and Wreck-It Ralph.

1391
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Sadly, we have to wait so long for Wreck-It Ralph.

1392
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Phineas and Ferb needs to be now.

1393
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:51,000
But those are all going to be available soon.

1394
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:57,000
That is weird that Wreck-It Ralph isn't towards the start because I would have thought that the Blu-ray would be out around April.

1395
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,000
But they may, they're just trying to probably space it out because I mean, you've got two play sets coming out.

1396
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:06,000
They've got the stuff that ties in with Monsters University and Zorro and then Kars.

1397
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:10,000
I mean, it might be a little much. I was hoping during the summer.

1398
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:14,000
That could change if, you know, it's rolling.

1399
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:20,000
And also along this time, too, you're going to be able to get the token packs, which tokens unlock stuff in the game.

1400
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:28,000
So like, you know, the bus from the Muppets or Abu as an elephant or something like that.

1401
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Tigerclaw asks, how long until we see Star Wars characters in Disney Infinity?

1402
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
I don't know.

1403
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Probably not that long.

1404
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Wait for Disney Infinity Giants.

1405
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:46,000
I don't think they're going to come out with anything like, you know, like Skylanders Giants because they don't really need to.

1406
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Fool.

1407
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,000
They don't need to do it for Skylanders either, if you really think about it.

1408
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Well, they do because it has to expand the game.

1409
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
They didn't need a little big planet, too, Loki.

1410
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
They'll find a way. Come on. They'll find a way.

1411
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
All right.

1412
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
The content's on the disk anyway.

1413
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
They're going to have to have a new edition in another year for the rest of the content.

1414
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
True.

1415
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:20,000
And we're going to find out about all the characters anyways for Disney Infinity because the content for this entire year is actually on the disk.

1416
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:25,000
That is interesting, too, because you know people are going to hack the shit out of this game the minute it's out.

1417
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:32,000
So anything that they're trying to keep under wraps with Frozen, be ready for that to hit the internet the minute this game leaks.

1418
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,000
It's going to be a little harder, though, because you need RFID stuff to do that.

1419
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:42,000
But I don't know what they've done with Skylanders, you know, as far as rewriting RFID tags.

1420
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,000
I'm sure that's possible. I'm not really sure how they would do it.

1421
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:50,000
It would be a little bit more complicated than just unlocking everything.

1422
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Hackers going to hack.

1423
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,000
I'm not sure that they are, but I'm just saying it's a little bit more complicated.

1424
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Not everybody's going to be doing it.

1425
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:01,000
The Ouya is getting a controller redesign.

1426
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
I actually think it looks kind of cool.

1427
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
There's some people are saying the D-pad sucks.

1428
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Apparently the grips on the analog sticks were not rubberized enough, so they kind of changed it and added a little rubberized top to it.

1429
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:21,000
They also, I guess we're adjusting the touchpad sensitivity and moving the triggers closer to the body.

1430
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:27,000
And the D-pad is now, instead of the circular D-pad, it's a cross-shaped D-pad.

1431
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,000
And people are seeing the pictures and they're like, oh, it's terrible.

1432
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Looks like the Xbox 360 controller.

1433
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:42,000
However, you're not looking at it close enough, because actually the circle part on there, the corners, the little pie-shaped stuff, are actually attached to the controller.

1434
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,000
The D-pad itself is the only thing that rocks in there.

1435
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:55,000
So it actually is a true D-pad and not like the Xbox 360 controller, which is kind of a D-pad on top of a circle and the whole thing rocks.

1436
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
So it'll be interesting to see.

1437
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:01,000
I'm still looking forward to my system in a couple months, so that'll be cool.

1438
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Bring it in.

1439
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:14,000
And then, of course, the, I don't know if it's a sign of desperation, but hey, get your friends to buy a Vita, because we need people to buy a Vita.

1440
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:22,000
And if you do, you get $20 in PlayStation Network credit and 1,000 Sony Rewards points.

1441
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:28,000
I don't really know what 1,000 Rewards points buys you, but cool, I guess.

1442
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,000
I mean, some sort of referral program.

1443
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Kind of along the lines of that, actually, I'm thinking of selling my Vita, because I'm just not playing anything on it.

1444
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
You know what? You may have a buyer.

1445
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
So, I don't know. We'll see.

1446
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Still waiting for a Grand Theft Auto game.

1447
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Still waiting. It's not coming.

1448
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Speaking of Grand Theft Auto, second half of May, from what I hear, is supposed to be coming out.

1449
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Do you collect your-

1450
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
That makes sense. Right in time for school to be out, so all the kids can go home and play.

1451
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Yeah, because we were bothering them. We were on a conference call at Take-Two, and they're like,

1452
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Hey, so when's it coming out?

1453
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
And they're all, second half of May.

1454
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Lisa's word, it's targeted right now.

1455
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Of course, that all depends on, they're looking at a new build of it next week,

1456
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
and assuming that everything's up to something, it'll be the second half.

1457
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,000
At the end of February, they're going to be announcing collector's editions.

1458
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:21,000
They're going to have one for $79.99, one for $134.99 to $149.99.

1459
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,000
They don't know what's in there yet, but you didn't hear that here.

1460
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,000
But then again, it doesn't take a rockish scientist to guess,

1461
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Oh, they'll probably be collector's editions, you know?

1462
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Yeah, of course.

1463
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Long-awaited games always have collector's editions.

1464
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Of course, and-

1465
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
The time frame makes sense.

1466
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
And-

1467
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
None of this is unreasonable news.

1468
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I'm still begging, still begging my boss to take me,

1469
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,000
but Destination PlayStation, I'm going to have a playable build of it now.

1470
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
I want to play that game!

1471
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Of course you do.

1472
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
I'm like, listen you asshole, you're going to bring me to-

1473
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
You're bringing me down there.

1474
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
That'll win you fans.

1475
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Alright, going to a game that Loki's not playing,

1476
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,000
but if he had a Wii U, he might be playing this.

1477
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Zombie U.

1478
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:04,000
So news this week, the Zombie U originally had intended to have a co-op mode,

1479
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
but it was shelved pretty early into development,

1480
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
which, you know, kind of makes sense.

1481
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:15,000
The producer of the game said that we thought we could not deliver it on time.

1482
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,000
How to bring a cooperative experience and still keep fear and tension

1483
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
is a question we would love to address, though.

1484
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,000
So, probably in Zombie U, too, which I think is inevitable at this point,

1485
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
but we'll see.

1486
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
But yeah, that was-

1487
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
I always wanted to see that banned as a zombie.

1488
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Shut up.

1489
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:39,000
300,000 survivors apparently have died so far in Zombie U,

1490
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
according to the servers at Ubisoft.

1491
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
There you go.

1492
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Well, they're no longer survivors now, aren't they?

1493
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Alright, moving on to some interesting news about the Wii U.

1494
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Apparently, your Wii Shop purchases will not earn you Club Nintendo coins on Wii U.

1495
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:05,000
In other words, these two stores are very separate.

1496
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
If you transfer your Wii content to the Wii U,

1497
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,000
and you buy WiiWare virtual console games on the Wii U's Wii mode,

1498
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,000
you don't get Wii U coins out of that.

1499
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Because, face it, Nintendo's Wii and Wii U modes don't know how to talk to each other.

1500
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Loki, you and I were chatting before the show about this,

1501
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
and I don't remember which one of us said it,

1502
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,000
but we were joking about this whole $1.50 upgrade

1503
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
is probably going to be something, you know,

1504
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,000
like if you want to get an upgrade to your game and play it on the Wii U.

1505
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Yeah, in case you haven't heard about it, the Wii U is going to have virtual console, finally.

1506
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
You're going to be able to play on your gamepad,

1507
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,000
and you're also going to reassign your controls and stuff like that,

1508
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
and save states and all that fun stuff.

1509
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:49,000
But, it's going to cost you, you're going to have to buy your games again.

1510
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,000
However, if you have the original game and you ported it over to your Wii U,

1511
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:57,000
you can buy it for $1.50 for Super Nintendo and $1 for Nintendo games.

1512
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,000
And we were joking about that they'll probably be in the Wii mode,

1513
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,000
they'll be the Wii U virtual console upgrade channel.

1514
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
They'll actually transfer, I was saying,

1515
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,000
you'll probably have to buy the upgrade in the Wii virtual console,

1516
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:14,000
because Nintendo doesn't know how to get the two things to talk to each other.

1517
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
They don't know online.

1518
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,000
It's not so much that the Wii can't talk to the Wii U part of the device,

1519
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
but it's the online part.

1520
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Like, Nintendo can't figure out how to hook up your Wii and Wii U accounts.

1521
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
They can't do it.

1522
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,000
This proves they can't do it.

1523
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Yeah.

1524
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
And I made the joke that, you know, when you're doing the upgrade,

1525
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
you know how they have the little loading screen stuff,

1526
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,000
it's gonna be a little Pikmin running into your wallet and snatching a dollar out.

1527
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
So, kind of funny.

1528
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
And then I said, stop being funny when we're not on air.

1529
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
I know.

1530
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
There you go.

1531
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
I don't make it a point to do that.

1532
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:51,000
All right, well, this is a game that's available on virtual console on the 3DS, I know.

1533
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Xevious, there's a 30th anniversary tribute album,

1534
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:02,000
paying homage to the original soundtrack of the shooter,

1535
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:06,000
and lots of different game composers that are contributing to this soundtrack.

1536
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:11,000
It is gonna be out January 29th on iTunes through Namco Sounds.

1537
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Very cool.

1538
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,000
There's some previews up on YouTube if you want to check that out.

1539
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
I didn't realize that game was turning 30 years old.

1540
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
How does it feel to be old?

1541
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Old.

1542
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Dark Sakura, what do you got for us?

1543
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,000
I got some stuff.

1544
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,000
First of all, this is sad news.

1545
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:35,000
The composer for Heavy Rain, Norman Corbell, died at 56 years old.

1546
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Passed away on,

1547
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:44,000
he was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer on August 15th, 2012.

1548
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:50,000
And, let's see, this was posted on the 27th, and he died at 2.56 PM that day.

1549
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
So that's very sadness.

1550
01:35:53,000 --> 01:36:01,000
And then, in happier news, there is a Greenlight game that is actually out now,

1551
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,000
that I really came close to buying today, it looks super fun.

1552
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Except I have a lot of stuff to pay for and just quit my job.

1553
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
But it's called No Time to Explain.

1554
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
The trailer for this is absolutely hilarious.

1555
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
I mean, it is super funny.

1556
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:22,000
But this one was actually, the interesting thing about this is that the Minecraft guy, Marcus Person,

1557
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,000
actually donated $2,000 to this project.

1558
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,000
So it's got the approval of our Minecraft dude.

1559
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,000
And it's on Steam, so go get it.

1560
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:41,000
And then, in other news, someone didn't link me the story.

1561
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,000
There we go.

1562
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
I was like, I'm looking right at it.

1563
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I found it, shush.

1564
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Resident Evil 6 PC is going to come with some bonus stuff.

1565
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:59,000
It comes with the Mercenaries No Mercy mode, which is a time attack with waves of enemies.

1566
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:02,000
And we'll see how well people do on that one.

1567
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:10,000
And also, I believe that after that, you'll be able to buy the MIA Siege mode DLC.

1568
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
So there you go.

1569
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:20,000
It's going to be, well, at least in Europe, it's going to be $19.99 or $29.99 euro.

1570
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,000
So who knows what will be here.

1571
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Expensive.

1572
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
All right.

1573
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Let's go to a part of the show we call the FUGL Question of the Week.

1574
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Well, that's a funny word.

1575
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Well, what we did, we smashed the word Facebook and Google together, and we got FUGL.

1576
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:41,000
I believe the term is a portmanteau.

1577
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Bless you.

1578
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
All right.

1579
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:48,000
FUGL Question of the Week, going to the question we asked this week,

1580
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,000
which is in a follow-up to something we talked about earlier in the show

1581
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:59,000
with the whole Dead Space 3 and the fact that you will be able to buy some of these guns with real money.

1582
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:04,000
And because of mobile, phone gamers are to blame for this.

1583
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,000
So we asked our Facebook and Google community members this week,

1584
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:14,000
have you ever bought a microtransaction in a console game of something you could have used in-game currency to unlock?

1585
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Why or why not?

1586
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Do you think this sort of mobile, and I put that in quotes,

1587
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:23,000
design in games is a good thing or a bad thing?

1588
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
We'll start with Google tonight.

1589
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Critical Myth says, I've never knowingly done so, but sometimes it's hard to tell with costumes and weapons and so on.

1590
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,000
But if it's single player, I don't think it matters one way or the other.

1591
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:40,000
I do think it's BS when multiplayer items go for sale in that manner for obvious reasons.

1592
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Actually, I wouldn't have minded hearing a little elaboration on that because Mass Effect does that whole thing.

1593
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
It's not the most bullshit thing I've ever seen.

1594
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
I don't really care for it.

1595
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:55,000
And I think it's a horrible value too compared to how long it takes to get the in-game currency to do it.

1596
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:01,000
But because it's all co-op, it doesn't necessarily throw the game out of whack.

1597
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:07,000
But I think the obvious reasons you state there are probably more in the head-to-head multiplayer games.

1598
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
That's my guess anyway.

1599
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Anyhow, more answers.

1600
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Redertainment on Google Plus says, yes, I've paid real monies for games and items I could earn in-game.

1601
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:22,000
I didn't do this because I'm used to doing so by prior experience.

1602
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,000
I did this because of the general philosophy I have towards things.

1603
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:30,000
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want to expediently.

1604
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Flaco Jones says, I've never paid for something that I could earn normally in a console game.

1605
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:41,000
I meet with guides and FAQs freely available on the internet to show you where every last item is hidden and how to get it.

1606
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:44,000
It seems like it would be a waste of money.

1607
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Going to Facebook and some of the answers there, James S.

1608
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:52,000
If they incorporate a way for you to obtain the items by collecting in-game currency, then whatever.

1609
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:57,000
This is just one of the many evolutions of the gaming industry in today's troublesome economy.

1610
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:01,000
We all must take the necessary steps in order to keep our heads above water.

1611
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Whether or not that means pissing some people off in the process.

1612
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,000
It's a business, deal with it.

1613
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Hmm, I don't know. I think folks will deal with it when they stop buying the games.

1614
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:23,000
But regardless, again, the mobile phone logic is you only paid 99 cents for the game in the first place, not 60.

1615
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,000
That's the big discrepancy here, anyway.

1616
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Jovadea says, I could really care less about microtransactions for items I can still pick up with in-game money.

1617
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:35,000
There are some in-game unlockables that are just a huge pain in the ass.

1618
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:39,000
So it might be worth it for something like that if I'm too putsy to unlock it myself.

1619
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:43,000
But I can just ignore it and enjoy the game normally if I don't want to put out the cash.

1620
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:47,000
It only becomes annoying when the microtransaction is for something I can't get myself in-game,

1621
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:52,000
or so difficult to unlock it could take years to save up in-game due to just how you get the game money.

1622
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,000
That's just the company pushing you to spend more money for more pretties.

1623
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Again, though, if the extra pretties are something that takes away from the core game, then it doesn't matter.

1624
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Don't want to spend the money on it, then don't.

1625
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Some people like to collect all the pretties, though. Let them waste their money on what they want.

1626
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:13,000
AKVG Games replies and says, I have never bought anything that was microtransaction related.

1627
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:17,000
The closest thing to it was DLC for either character skin or expansion of a story.

1628
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:21,000
I don't believe I'll ever pay money for anything in a game that you could earn or unlock.

1629
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,000
I understand why people pay to get something ahead of time.

1630
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,000
But in my personal opinion, you lose a couple things from doing so.

1631
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:33,000
There's more to that, but I can't read all of these answers, so please check out the full-length responses on Facebook.

1632
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Redthehaze replies and says, there was a console game I avoided because of the microtransactions,

1633
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
and that was Gotham City Impostors.

1634
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:46,000
The game was $15 and had the option to purchase upgrades, which could be unlocked in the game.

1635
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,000
I would have no problem with it, but it took too much time to unlock the upgrades.

1636
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:56,000
It resulted with unbalanced gameplay, giving the advantage to those who spent a lot of time and or those who paid money.

1637
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:05,000
That being said, I will pick up Dead Space 3 and goes on to say that the Dead Space 3 upgrades are co-op multiplayer and single player and so on.

1638
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Uh, Gotham City Impostors, that game kind of flopped a rude though, didn't it?

1639
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
I think so.

1640
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
And did it go free to play at some point?

1641
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Uh, I don't remember if it did.

1642
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Did I not call that?

1643
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,000
I thought it did. I could be wrong. I could be wrong.

1644
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
I'm just saying, I called it.

1645
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,000
$15 is still pretty cheap, but anyhow.

1646
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Burr replies and says, most microtransactions feel like paying for cheat codes.

1647
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Why the hell are we paying for cheat codes?

1648
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:36,000
It feels like insult heaped upon injury considering that on today's consoles we can no longer cheat in our games because of achievements, trophies, etc.

1649
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,000
I think that comment really hits the nail on the head to what I think.

1650
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:45,000
And we were talking earlier in the show about the whole, like, SimCity and how that's all changed.

1651
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,000
I think this is right up the alley of why that all went down that way.

1652
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Degenerate Johnny said, honestly, I think it all depends on the player.

1653
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:58,000
I personally have no partook in microtransactions in games with the exception of wow.

1654
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Damn that sparkly horse.

1655
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
However, I do see that there's a growing market for them.

1656
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:10,000
As games are becoming progressively longer and more frequent, it makes life harder for the completionist to master the game in time for the next game to be released.

1657
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Even the most skillful players have a rough time keeping up.

1658
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,000
These microtransactions help save time for these players.

1659
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
And again, this one continues as well.

1660
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
But here's my question.

1661
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:25,000
How does the sparkly horse help you save time?

1662
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:29,000
I guess technically you don't have to buy a flying mount if you have one.

1663
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Wait, wasn't it that it used to be that if you bought one of the mounts with faster speed naturally that you automatically unlocked Master Flying?

1664
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Not the Uber. No, you still have to pay for flying.

1665
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Not paying for flying, but I thought that it was right before they patched it out that if you had...

1666
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:55,000
If you get the in-game achievement for the Violet Drake, you would automatically unlock the 310 flying.

1667
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Yeah, that's been patched out since.

1668
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Andy R said, I've bought plenty of DLC, mostly rock bands.

1669
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:11,000
See, I appreciate the answers, but the sparkly horse and rock band songs aren't necessarily things you can unlock with in-game money.

1670
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:14,000
And that's a key difference too. Especially with rock band.

1671
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:19,000
And the reason why I wanted to draw that distinction, especially with rock band, is that it's so different.

1672
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Like when you're actually paying for a song that is new and you understand that licensing goes into getting that song in the game and so forth.

1673
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
It's very different for me.

1674
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:36,000
While Andy R agrees, I draw the line when it is something unlockable in the game.

1675
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Alright, there you go.

1676
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:44,000
I think it's mostly because I'm stingy about that kind of thing. I have no problems buying add-ons to a game I'm enjoying throughout.

1677
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
I think that's a good way to put it, add-ons.

1678
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:53,000
And lastly, Annamalous Underdog says, no, the only DLC I ever bought was more songs for Rocksmith.

1679
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:58,000
DLC that adds substantially new content is the only kind of DLC I'm ever willing to buy.

1680
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Rock band, Rocksmith, Guitar Hero, it's all...

1681
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Hell, DDR. They're all the same, honestly.

1682
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Except when the DDR songs were on the disc. That was a little more shady. Little bit shady.

1683
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Little bit.

1684
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Thank you for all the questions. Please, to read the responses in full, check out our Facebook community.

1685

Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

1686
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Or you can search for Orange Lounge Radio on Google Plus. We're there as well and you can read those answers.

1687
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Alright, let's get back into some more news.

1688
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:34,000
And we already started to talk about one of these a minute ago, Loki, right?

1689
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Yes, yes. So, lots of Nintendo news. Basically, they had another Nintendo Direct...

1690
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:49,000
I don't know what you want to call it. It's not really a press conference, but video that they made.

1691
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:58,000
And they talked about a few game announcements and releases and then showed you some stuff, I guess.

1692
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:03,000
So, I don't know. I'm a little hesitant on everything that I saw.

1693
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Just because we don't know when a lot of this stuff is coming out.

1694
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
But let's just go over what they talked about.

1695
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:18,000
So, first things first. One of the big announcements was that they're gonna do an HD remake of Legends of the Wind Waker.

1696
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:23,000
And it's gonna have better graphics and gonna be on the Wii U and have all the Wii U stuff.

1697
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
It's supposed to be coming out this fall.

1698
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:35,000
So, neat. Although I'm not that excited about it. Even though Wind Waker is a pretty fun game and I really do like Wind Waker.

1699
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:41,000
I actually thought that the new graphics don't look good. It's too much bloom.

1700
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:45,000
This was one of those announcements where it wasn't really surprising.

1701
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:49,000
And it's funny because I got into a debate with somebody on Facebook about this.

1702
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:53,000
I didn't really feel a lot of this news that came out of Nintendo was that surprising.

1703
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:57,000
And it's like, well, how could you have called Wind Waker? And I'm like, well, there's a difference.

1704
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:02,000
It's not that I predicted it or I knew it was coming. That's not what I'm talking about.

1705
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:07,000
When I heard the news that Wind Waker was coming out, I did more one of those, oh yeah, that makes sense.

1706
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Yeah, actually, why didn't we see this coming? Because they always do a Zelda remake for consoles these days, it seems.

1707
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:20,000
We had the new Zelda on 3DS. We had a Mario remake launch the original DS.

1708
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:26,000
We had Zelda on Game Boy Advance that was cross playable.

1709
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:32,000
The Zelda that launched the Wii was essentially a GameCube Zelda game, but with the controls.

1710
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:38,000
This whole reimagining of previous Zelda games isn't exactly a new territory for Nintendo.

1711
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:44,000
No, and I always thought that they would be doing HD remakes of games. I thought it would be Wii games.

1712
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:49,000
So they would do HD remakes of. And I guess, I mean, are GameCube games close enough?

1713
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Here's the thing, though. They also said they're working on another Zelda game.

1714
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:58,000
But, you know, just like, hey, we're working on Smash Brothers.

1715
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Grass is green. Pope is Catholic. Bear shit in woods.

1716
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:08,000
We don't know when it's coming out. And, you know, I would say at least next year, not later.

1717
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Super Smash Brothers for the Wii U and 3DS is supposed to be showcased at E3.

1718
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Doesn't say coming out this year, though. I'd like to point that out.

1719
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:28,000
They showed a video for the Yoshi game. That alleged Yoshi game that we saw in the debug menus and stuff on.

1720
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:35,000
The whole Wii U community thing. And it's done in the style of Kirby's Epic Yarn.

1721
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Cool. No mentioning when that's coming out, but they're working on it.

1722
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Also, a new, very briefly in a video, a new game from Monolith Soft that looks sort of like Xenoblade for the Wii U.

1723
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Once again.

1724
01:48:54,000 --> 01:49:02,000
That was, okay, of all the various announcements made, that one was more one where it's like, it was like, yay.

1725
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Because clearly, you know, Xenoblade had kind of a rough transition going from Japan to the U.S.

1726
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
And, you know, all the stuff that went with that.

1727
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:18,000
But it came out, and that kind of shows that, okay, maybe Nintendo's putting a little more stock in this than they did when it was originally on the Wii.

1728
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:23,000
So that piece of news was like, got a smile out of me.

1729
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:31,000
One that I was kind of, I don't know, it was a little weird, Shin Megami Tensei Crossfire Emblem.

1730
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Interesting.

1731
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Yeah, that was the one where I was like, now that's a surprise.

1732
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:40,000
That's, that's, that's, okay, cool, cool.

1733
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
I'm with you here.

1734
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,000
That was cool.

1735
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
I'm gonna tell you right now, that's not gonna sell very well.

1736
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:53,000
And just because you got two very niche franchises, I mean, Fire Emblem, there are rabbit fans for it, but let's be honest.

1737
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Your soccer moms are not gonna be buying this game.

1738
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Well, but maybe the expectations and the budget aren't that high.

1739
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Because, I mean, by that logic, they would have stopped making Fire Emblem games a long time ago, but they haven't.

1740
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:13,000
So, that audience, as small as it may be, or as niche as it may be, is enough to substantiate this happening.

1741
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
I hope they're right.

1742
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:22,000
No, the soccer moms won't buy this, but that's not who Nintendo needed to talk to with this little press conference thingy they did, either.

1743
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
This wasn't a soccer mom conference.

1744
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:28,000
If Reggie Fils-Aime wanted to talk to the soccer moms, he'd go on Ellen.

1745
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:36,000
They announced that the Miiverse is coming to smartphones, so you're gonna be able to browse the Miiverse stuff on there.

1746
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Now, that was, it was surprising and not surprising at the same time.

1747
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Because, you know, you're like, oh, holy shit, a Nintendo app on the iPhone, but then you're like, oh yeah, the investors have been, like, breathing down their fucking necks to do something on the iPhone.

1748
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:54,000
You know, the Pokemon company finally did their thing, you know, for what it's worth on the iPhone.

1749
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:00,000
This is to appease investors. This is Nintendo's move to appease investors.

1750
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:05,000
I just hope it's good, because they sure as hell don't know how to code anything for the internet.

1751
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Well, Miiverse is one of the more fascinating features of the Wii U. I guess we'll leave it at that.

1752
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Pleasant surprises. That's a good way to put it. It's a pleasant surprise on the Wii U.

1753
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:25,000
This summer, um, we're gonna be getting a sequel to Wii Party, a party game that no one fucking bought.

1754
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Well now, wait a minute, Loki. I'm calling you out on this, because you just said, here's one that Soccer Moms won't give a shit about, yet now here's Wii Party. You know who did buy that game?

1755
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
No one! No, Soccer Moms.

1756
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Nobody bought it. Trust me, I had to sell this game. Nobody fucking bought it.

1757
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:50,000
It was just like, is it Mario Party? Nope. Don't care. Don't need it.

1758
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,000
I don't know why they would make a sequel to a game that didn't sell, but...

1759
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Because it's Nintendo. They'll do whatever they want. I mean, it's minimal effort.

1760
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:04,000
But, one of the big things that they were, you know, touting with this is that you'll be able to do two-player gameplay on the gamepad.

1761
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:15,000
And you'll be able to basically just, kind of like how they showed some of the demos and stuff that you could do, like stuff, you know, where you can play, you know, air hockey or whatever on the gamepad.

1762
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Although, explain to me how that's gonna fucking work, since it doesn't have multi-touch?

1763
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Wii Party, VGCharts.com, 1.67 million in North America, 3.27 million in Europe. This is games being made for Europe.

1764
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:37,000
North America sold less than Japan, too. But 1.67 is nothing to bat your eyelashes at, so...

1765
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Yeah, I wonder how many of those were after the game dropped down to nothing.

1766
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Would you like me to look at the week-by-week detail?

1767
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Yes, I would. I'd love to.

1768
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Let's take a peek.

1769
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
I can tell you that no one bought that.

1770
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Well, again, Europe was the biggest selling region for that game, so...

1771
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Which is really odd. Did they not get like a Mario Party game over there or something?

1772
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,000
I don't know. Maybe it's just, you know, different strokes for different folks, right?

1773
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Let's see, I'm trying to bring it up here week-by-week.

1774
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Keep going, I'll figure it out.

1775
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Alright. And then, of course, one of the announcements was the whole Virtual Console trial thing.

1776
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:21,000
The highest amount of sales were the week of November 27th, but that's the Black Friday week in 2010.

1777
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:28,000
It did sell, like, it sold almost a million the first year it was out, in 2010.

1778
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:34,000
But it sold 300,000 more in 2011, which I imagine is when that price drop was.

1779
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:38,000
It was before that. It was like a few months after it came out.

1780
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Okay, so, yeah, that's why there was so many offered up for Black Friday, clearing out inventory.

1781
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:54,000
So, the Virtual Console trial program basically kind of gets you guys hooked on buying Virtual Console games for the Wii U.

1782
01:53:54,000 --> 01:54:02,000
You would be able to purchase, they're going to have 30 set games, and they're going to be available for 30 days, basically a month for each.

1783
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:08,000
So first one, of course, for January was Balloon Fight, and then for February they're going to have F-Zero.

1784
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:18,000
March is Punch Out featuring Mr. Dream, April Kirby's Adventure, May Super Metroid, June Yoshi, and July Donkey Kong.

1785
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:31,000
And 30 cents each, and, you know, if you don't buy them during that time frame, then you're going to have to pay the $1 or $1.50 to upgrade them, or, you know, not.

1786
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:39,000
I'm not a big fan of the upgrade fees, because I just don't get it, because I feel like the, you know, and they're talking about,

1787
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:44,000
oh, well, they're new emulators, you can play them on the gamepad, I'm like, big fucking deal, you know, it's not-

1788
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Why is it a good-

1789
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Why can't I- where are the goddamn leaderboards, or even online play, or, you know, like, something else to really push this Virtual Console thing forward?

1790
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Why is it so hard for them to code an emulator for that stuff? I can tell you this much, there's people that had emul- when that homebrew channel came out,

1791
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:11,000
there's people that had emulators running for all games, you know, all games of a certain- or, you know, all games that are compatible with an emulator.

1792
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Relatively easy, I don't understand why this is such a problem.

1793
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:22,000
But I will say this, I did spend the 30 cents to get Balloon Fight, I didn't have it before, and I thought, you know, what the heck, let me just kind of take a-

1794
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:29,000
30 cents, for god's sake, I'll take a look at it, and I will say the sound is actually really good, I don't- and it's weird because-

1795
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,000
I noticed that too.

1796
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Yeah, the NES had that mono sound, so I don't know if they did something to maybe fake a stereo emulation, but like, having the TV sound and the gamepad sound actually sounds kind of nice.

1797
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:51,000
And, thank fuck, finally, you don't have to put your TV into 4-3 mode, it will finally- like it knows to scrunch down the image of the picture.

1798
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:58,000
To be appropriate, it's not all stretched like the Wii Virtual Console was. Thank god, finally.

1799
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:03,000
But again, are those two things enough to really substantiate a buck fifty upgrade?

1800
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Remember, and that's not a buck fifty for the game, people, that's a buck fifty when you already dropped seven or eight on it.

1801
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:16,000
That's my big sticking point. People are forgetting, we already paid a decent amount of money for these games.

1802
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:23,000
And the reason that they're doing that, they claim, is because there's no- or, well, the reason we think is because there's no real way to link them.

1803
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Yet, at the same time, there's no real way to link it when they not know that you've already purchased it and wouldn't charge you just the dollar, dollar fifty.

1804
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:38,000
So, they do know that you bought it. The least they could do is, hey, you know what? You bought these games, I'll tell you what.

1805
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:45,000
You import them over, when those downloads become available, you get the Wii, you know, Wii U version for free.

1806
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:50,000
I mean, really, what are they missing out on? A dollar? I mean, come on. Just do that.

1807
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:56,000
I would show some really, you know, hey, you know what? We put this emulator out.

1808
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Or just give it slightly enhanced value. You know, like, how hard would it be to have, you know, certificates, achievements, trophies, whatever, for you beat the virtual-

1809
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Network multiplayer.

1810
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Network- for real! How hard is that? I guess, too laggy or something.

1811
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:20,000
It's hard to build netcode in emulators. Oh, but wait, they already did that shit on PC.

1812
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Exactly.

1813
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Homebrew emulators have netcode where you can play games over the internet. Multiplayer. Oh, go fake.

1814
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Oh, Foliath. You know, the company that fucking made the games could come up with netcode. Oh, but that would be asking them to embrace the internet and they don't fucking understand yet.

1815
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Is that it?

1816
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,000
That's it. Oh, okay. I'm dead.

1817
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,000
I wasn't sure if there was more.

1818
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Alright, well, let's move on with something else about the Wii U.

1819
01:57:50,000 --> 01:58:00,000
And a very interesting comment that was made this week by Crystal Dynamics, who, of course, as you know, are making the Wii U-

1820
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Or, excuse me, they're not making the Wii- That was the comment.

1821
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Crystal Dynamics is making Tomb Raider, and the comment was about a Wii U version of Tomb Raider.

1822
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Because, you know, why not? We had, you know, Batman, Arkham City, and, you know, these other games that were- Mass Effect 3 were ported to Wii U.

1823
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:21,000
So, where's our Tomb Raider port to the Wii U?

1824
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:30,000
And, you know, if creative director Noah Hughes, if you try to read between the lines of what he said here, it's probably not happening.

1825
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Quote, I'm always a fan of Nintendo systems. In particular, they really push interface design, and from a game design perspective, it's fun to play with the new interfaces.

1826
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:43,000
So, there's the nice little, like, I'm gonna say something nice, and then here's the but.

1827
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:49,000
But, having said that, it's something that I think we would want to tailor the experience to if we were gonna do it.

1828
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:53,000
And currently, we're offering it on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1829
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:59,000
And all three of those are really trying to deliver roughly the same experience, but delivered best on each platform.

1830
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:05,000
I think something like the Wii U often asks you to do something unique based on a unique interface, so that's something as a gamer I love.

1831
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:09,000
But it's something that you don't want to do half-heartedly as a developer.

1832
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:20,000
So, in other words, they don't want to try and, at least what I'm hearing in here, they don't want to try and put Tomb Raider on the Wii U when it wasn't really designed with the Wii U in mind, when there's something extra going on there.

1833
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:23,000
And I say, makes sense to me.

1834
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Yeah.

1835
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:30,000
You know, maybe there's somewhere else where Lara Croft can fit on the Wii U.

1836
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:40,000
You know, there were those games, the Xbox Live, thank you, the Guardian of Light, the PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live Arcade games.

1837
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:46,000
I bet one of those games could be done very well on the Wii U, if they wanted to do that, I don't know.

1838
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:53,000
I just think it's really late for them to, they've been working on Tomb Raider for a while, it's probably late for them to make a port.

1839
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:59,000
And it might not be that beneficial because they're worried that the numbers aren't there yet to support that.

1840
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
No, makes sense to me. I get it.

1841
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:12,000
And honestly, I think the people that want to play Tomb Raider probably already have, are the types of people that already have Xbox, PlayStation 3, or a PC.

1842
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,000
You know, like PC's a pretty big market, you know.

1843
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Anyhow, let's move on with more news. Dark Sakura.

1844
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Well, this is the news we've been waiting for, and it's already been all over the place and I'm sure everyone knows about it, but this is super, super awesome.

1845
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Basically, we talked last week about how Jonathan Coulton had been kind of shafted, well actually really shafted when it came to Glee's treatment of his cover of Baby Got Back.

1846
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:48,000
So now, even though there's still some legal research going on with this, what he's done is re-released his original as a cover of a cover of his cover.

1847
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:57,000
So now it's listed on iTunes, Amazon, and Google Play as Baby Got Back in the style of Glee.

1848
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:03,000
And I paid for it, I mean it's a good cause, but basically what's going to happen with this, he's using the same license he had before.

1849
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:16,000
So after basically Sir Mix-A-Lot gets paid, then the proceeds, well and iTunes, then any other proceeds are going to be donated to the VH1 Save the Music Foundation and the It Gets Better project.

1850
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Which roundaboutly goes back to Glee because they're also sending donations to that, so.

1851
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Yeah, a lot of what I, the comments I've been reading is that, you know, Glee is supposed to be all anti-bullying and stuff, but what is Fox doing to JoCo in this case?

1852
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Pretty much, yeah.

1853
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,000
It's kind of sick.

1854
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:36,000
I mean, it comes down to the bottom line, it's all about greed.

1855
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:40,000
You know who the real winner is in this scenario though? Sir Mix-A-Lot.

1856
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Yeah, he's like, dude, all this money.

1857
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Who's given Sir Mix-A-Lot any thought recently, you know?

1858
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Seriously, like what's the last thing he's done?

1859
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,000
That guy's like, thank god I can pay the rent this month.

1860
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:57,000
No, he's actually, to tell you the truth, he's actually still been, I think he did like a lot of producing.

1861
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Yeah, I wouldn't doubt it.

1862
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:03,000
But honestly, the last Sir Mix-A-Lot song that ever came out that I gave a damn about was Buttermilk Biscuits.

1863
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Huh.

1864
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,000
So, just saying.

1865
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Game guru in our chat room says, Coversception.

1866
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:16,000
He needs to actually be knighted, and then he can really be Sir Mix-A-Lot.

1867
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Because that would be awesome.

1868
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,000
I love it.

1869
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Why can't we have that happen?

1870
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:27,000
I don't know, write the Queen of England and suggest that, oh yeah, he's not English for one.

1871
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Who cares, whatever, we'll make an exception.

1872
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Make an exception.

1873
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:34,000
I think that actually non-Englishmen can be knighted.

1874
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Okay.

1875
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
I'd have to double check it, but I think so.

1876
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Well, maybe Sir Mix-A-Lot can just be an ambassador, you know, if it's good enough for something.

1877
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
How about we just call him Mr. Mix-A-Lot?

1878
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Mr. Mix-A-Lot?

1879
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:49,000
The ambassador to large posteriors.

1880
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Bootyvania.

1881
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Alright, moving on, Loki.

1882
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Alright, so, this guy, I don't know what to do.

1883
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Seriously, can these people get voted out of office already?

1884
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:08,000
I mean, seriously, Senator Leland Yee.

1885
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:14,000
You know, you hear that name, you know it's got to be something anti-gaming, and of course that's what it is.

1886
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Apparently, he made a comment to the San Francisco Chronicle saying, hey, gamers just have to quiet down.

1887
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Because gamers have no credibility in this argument, saying about the violent video games thing.

1888
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:30,000
I'm sure he's trying to pass another anti-gaming law or something like that.

1889
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:43,000
I think this is in response to all the, you know, voices you're hearing in the community about, hey, stop blaming us for that sick stuff that happened at Sandy Hook.

1890
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:47,000
I think that's where he's saying, you know, gamers need to kind of be quiet.

1891
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
And it's like, no, you be quiet.

1892
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
No, you shut up.

1893
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
I know, right? Such a mature argument, right?

1894
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:56,000
But, like, in some ways I'm completely serious.

1895
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Like, I find that little comment by him to be very dismissive that, like, gamers are just a bunch of, like, angry kids.

1896
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:11,000
And it's like, you know, most of us are, or I should say there's a big part of us that really grew up on video games as a part of our culture.

1897
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:19,000
And we're in our mid-30s and even 40s now, and it's like, by the way, we vote, and you're not the mayor of San Francisco for that reason.

1898
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
Partially.

1899
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:25,000
By the way, I do have an expansion for what I just said.

1900
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Yeah.

1901
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Anybody can be knighted, but they can't accept a peerage unless they renounce their current citizenship.

1902
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
So, just saying.

1903
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Well, Leland Yee should certainly not be knighted.

1904
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
No, he should be set on fire.

1905
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:39,000
I mean, did I say that a lot?

1906
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Metaphorically.

1907
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Metaphorically. He needs to be fired.

1908
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Yes.

1909
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Fired.

1910
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Much better. Much better.

1911
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Well, he ran for mayor of San Francisco, if I remember right. He didn't get it.

1912
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
He can be smothered in the back of dicks.

1913
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Metaphorically.

1914
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Metaphorically.

1915
02:04:52,000 --> 02:05:02,000
I just, I don't know. I mean, there's just a lot of ignorant people out there, and they're only getting older.

1916
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Can you say that quote from him too? What was that again? Gamers need to, it wasn't gamers need to shut up, but gamers need to...

1917
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Gamers have just got to quiet down, and then gamers have no credibility in this argument.

1918
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:17,000
What?

1919
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Yes, let me make your job easier in passing these unconstitutional laws. Let me just quiet down.

1920
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Why don't I just ignore the first amendment that gives me the right to call you out on your state spewing and misjudgment of our community?

1921
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Hey, you people of color, why don't you just quiet down, okay? We don't need to pass these equality laws or anything.

1922
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Why don't you just stop complaining?

1923
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Yeah, hey gays, shut up.

1924
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Yes, seriously, gays, just stop complaining.

1925
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Let them throw you in trash cans. Fag is just a word.

1926
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:55,000
I'm just trying to do my job here, okay? Passing these laws.

1927
02:05:55,000 --> 02:06:02,000
But you know what? Women get the same thing too, because we're told we're not able to decide what goes on with our, you know, girl bits.

1928
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:08,000
I'm sorry, you don't have a vag, you can't talk about it. That's what I think, and I say the same thing to the non-gamers.

1929
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
You don't game, you're not allowed to talk about it.

1930
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Are you saying Leland Yee should play a video game?

1931
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Yes, I think he should. I mean, he can't grow a vag, but at least he can pick up a controller.

1932
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:22,000
I mean, I guess we could arrange that in a, you know, some surgery.

1933
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:27,000
But maybe Leland Yee, okay, in all seriousness, maybe Leland Yee needs to play Journey.

1934
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
I'm not talking about the one from 84.

1935
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Leland Yee maybe needs to stop focusing so much on the Grand Theft Autos and the, you know, what the hell, Manhunt, which is like a 10-year-old game anyway.

1936
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:44,000
And maybe he needs to start focusing on, like, some of the, you know, other things that makes our community great.

1937
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:47,000
You know, again, Journey was voted Game of the Year.

1938
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:54,000
No one's playing Manhunt anymore. I mean, seriously, my school just bring up, you know, Custard's Revenge.

1939
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
All those kids are getting their-

1940
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Pixel dick.

1941
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:05,000
They're just getting exposed to porn, you know, because of these games like Custard's Revenge that no one plays.

1942
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Or, like, you know, Manhunt that probably most kids nowadays don't even- they don't know that game.

1943
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:14,000
They don't even know what it is because it's so fucking old.

1944
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Legend- I love this comment and I think we'll end with this.

1945
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Legend of Zaku in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

1946
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Leland Yee channeling his inner Marie Antoinette. Go eat cake, gamers.

1947
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Very well spoken. But we all know what happened to Marie Antoinette.

1948
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Well, yeah, but-

1949
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Metaphorically.

1950
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:40,000
No, she got- she really happened to her. And besides that, though, I think that, uh, I think he-

1951
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:43,000
God, my inner history nerd is totally just screaming.

1952
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Let it go, girl. Let it go.

1953
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:45,000
I'll just tell him in chat.

1954
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:50,000
Okay. See what you're missing by not being at live.vognetwork.com.

1955
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Well, uh, if you think it's just Leland Yee, you're wrong.

1956
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:02,000
More light gun games and gun games disappearing after more complaints.

1957
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:07,000
I'm sick of reporting on this stuff. Can we just go to the mailbag?

1958
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Let's just not report on it. Out of that, I-

1959
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Well, no, because- because the reality is there's too many people that are sitting by and watching this happen.

1960
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:25,000
So I do feel a responsibility to say, wake up. You're getting blamed for this.

1961
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:39,000
You, who might not even be into some of these video games, that you as a gamer, as somebody who sought out this podcast and downloaded it, knowing we talked about video games, you are a gamer one way or the other.

1962
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:48,000
I'm- I'm- I'm 99.9% sure you are. You are being blamed for this tragedy that happened back East.

1963
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Wake up.

1964
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Don't forget about the other people who are getting blamed for it, too.

1965
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:01,000
Are they? Well, yes, but let's- I mean, like, movies and TV and so forth, it seems like a lot of that-

1966
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Now I'm talking about autism spectrum people who are also getting shafted out of the whole thing, too.

1967
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,000
Yes, that's very true.

1968
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:11,000
You know who's to blame? It's that damn show, Grey's Anatomy.

1969
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,000
It is-

1970
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
It's the blame.

1971
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
It is- it's Glee's fault.

1972
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:22,000
There's so much violence on that show, blood and guts everywhere, and sex. There's sexing on that show.

1973
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Glee taught me how to steal.

1974
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:29,000
I robbed a 7-Eleven because Glee said it was okay to steal.

1975
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Hey, I pirated all that music because Glee made it okay. Fox is saying, hey, this is what we do.

1976
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
We copy- we copy that floppy until-

1977
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
You got exposure?

1978
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Until the cows come home and says, you know what, hey, what are you gonna do?

1979
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:45,000
But you should be happy then listening to your music.

1980
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Why don't you go make some more music so I can steal that, too?

1981
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
I guess we should go to the mailbag.

1982
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:59,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place where you can send your emails every week.

1983
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:02,000
And Dark Soccer will dive in the email bag head first to read them.

1984
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:03,000
Yay!

1985
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. Dark Soccer.

1986
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
I'm gonna have a headache now.

1987
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Our first email comes from, I'm gonna mispronounce the name, Ramaditya.

1988
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Hi guys, this is Ramaditya.

1989
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:21,000
This month I tried to give you pictures from my wedding, but unfortunately Facebook blocked your access.

1990
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Now I would like to share one of the greatest parts of my marriage ceremony, the Star Wars wedding party.

1991
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:30,000
And it's actually a YouTube video, so we really can't pull it up and watch it right now during the show.

1992
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:34,000
This is the first three minutes where actually my greetings and preparation.

1993
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:38,000
You may watch the duel in front of the audience when you reach the middle part of the video.

1994
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:43,000
I hope this will inspire other fellow gamers to do something unique to their unforgettable events in life.

1995
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:46,000
See, Dan and I, when we got married, we just went to the courthouse.

1996
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:49,000
And then he, like, made faces at me and I punched him.

1997
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:52,000
I punched him in the arm and told him to knock it off.

1998
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
That was my wedding.

1999
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
You punched your husband on your wedding day.

2000
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Yeah.

2001
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:00,000
But that's what worked for you guys, and that's what's most important.

2002
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
At the end of the day, you guys are the ones getting married.

2003
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:06,000
We will watch your awesome duel when we are not live during the show.

2004
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
But thank you for sharing it with us.

2005
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:10,000
Next email.

2006
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Good day, OLR. Thank you so much for reading my email on the show.

2007
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
I can't believe you guys are still on the air.

2008
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:16,000
Neither can we.

2009
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Neither can we.

2010
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:21,000
I've started listening from the beginning and it's brought back some outstanding memories.

2011
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:25,000
I apologize if this runs a little long, but I first heard the show in a rather unusual way.

2012
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:30,000
It was at an old glow-in-the-dark bowling alley double arcade owned by the nicest group of people I've ever met.

2013
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:33,000
What I mean by double arcade is-

2014
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
Somebody was playing this show at a bowling alley?

2015
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
I don't know. Let me read it.

2016
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Awesome.

2017
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Let me read the damn email!

2018
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:40,000
We say fucking shit.

2019
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Fuck, fuck, cock.

2020
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Okay.

2021
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:49,000
What I mean by double arcade is that it was split into two adjoining rooms, each with their own genre of cabinets.

2022
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:52,000
The first room was row after row of fighting games.

2023
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:58,000
The other was the bimani room that hosts near-weekly tournaments of each and yearly bimani game festival.

2024
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:02,000
On the morning of said festival, I remember hearing a clip from your show talking about 2DX.

2025
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
I loved hearing the host chat it up.

2026
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:08,000
I completely forgot to ask about it. I was too excited waiting for Chorus K to arrive.

2027
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
And I've been keeping an ear out ever since.

2028
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Just to a few weeks ago, while looking up a new WoW podcast to listen to, I somehow ended up downloading an episode of Hoard House.

2029
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:21,000
The whole episode, I kept thinking, boy, this Rob Roberts cost sure sounds awfully damn familiar.

2030
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
And then you eventually mentioned OLR.

2031
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:29,000
I downloaded the newest episode of that, and voila, I've somehow managed to find my show all these years later.

2032
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:33,000
So thank you so much for everything you do and have done for the last decade now.

2033
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:38,000
You've reminded me of some just simply unbelievable memories of a place that got flooded years and years ago now.

2034
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Much love. I guess it's Plagius? Plagius?

2035
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Wow. Hoard House did something good. Who knew that? I'm teasing, I'm teasing. That's pretty amazing.

2036
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Those are grandpa's jokes.

2037
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
Still, the whole bowling alley thing blows me away.

2038
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:56,000
I guess I have heard that this show gets played in some very interesting places.

2039
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:59,000
I heard there was a GameStop that was playing this show somewhere.

2040
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:02,000
And I'm like, can't you get in trouble for that? Because we use naughty language.

2041
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
I don't know if they were doing it after hours or what.

2042
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Are we talking about the Evil G?

2043
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:09,000
Yeah, right? So it must have been after hours.

2044
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Oh, the irony.

2045
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
It must have been. I don't know.

2046
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:16,000
That Evil G must be Goodfellas, or Goodyear Tires.

2047
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Goodyear Tires. Damn that Goodyear Tires.

2048
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Well, also, this was a few years ago before there was so much fuckery.

2049
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:28,000
I mean, let's be real. There was a time and place when that was a store we all went to regularly.

2050
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
And my husband worked at?

2051
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Exactly. It's different now.

2052
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:37,000
I've heard of a LAN gaming center that was playing this show at one point, which, you know, that's pretty cool.

2053
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:43,000
But yeah, bowling alley. So I want to say to all the bowling alleys, how do you cheer on bowlers?

2054
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Roll the ball.

2055
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Knock the pin.

2056
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Go turkey.

2057
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
Get that turkey. Clap, clap, clap.

2058
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:53,000
I don't know. I need Jay Links.

2059
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Jay Links, how do you cheer a bowler?

2060
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
It makes me think of Global at...

2061
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
What the fuck is that?

2062
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Country Club Lanes.

2063
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
Yeah, one of our old school DDR spots.

2064
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:07,000
The last time I did Global was when Mel and Melody were in town, and I think... Didn't you come too?

2065
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Probably. We need to go Global now.

2066
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
It was like two in the morning, and we were like...

2067
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:15,000
You know what this email wants me to do? It makes me want to go bowling, because I haven't been bowling in forever.

2068
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Let's do it while I'm not working.

2069
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Last email.

2070
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:25,000
Hey, OLR. Decided to put some time into getting the Wiimote working on my Windows 7 machine.

2071
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:28,000
But apparently the new Wiimotes don't like to play with Windows.

2072
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Do you have any suggestions you can point me towards, or even better, a sure-far way to get it to work?

2073
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
Tanks in advance.

2074
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:37,000
And this comes from Xenocore.

2075
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:43,000
It should just work. I mean, it's Bluetooth, so it'd work like any Bluetooth device.

2076
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Sometimes they can be a little bit tricky to set up.

2077
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Like, I remember I had a Bluetooth dongle for my laptop, and I tried getting the Wiimote to work with that with an emulator.

2078
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
And it was just like, nope, not gonna do it.

2079
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:05,000
So it may just be you might need to try a different adapter, or you may need to try, like, you know, syncing in a different way.

2080
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:11,000
I know you can't just push the sync button. I think you have to push the 1 and 2 buttons at the same time, if I remember correctly.

2081
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:17,000
I know I got one to sync up to my Android phone to play some games on that.

2082
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Actually, that was my old Android phone. I should try the new one, too.

2083
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:26,000
But I've got a Bluetooth controller for that now, and I think this laptop has Bluetooth built in.

2084
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Hell, I know my wife's netbook has Bluetooth built in, so I should try that.

2085
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:33,000
I have to read this part of his signature, too.

2086
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely, trivial power corrupts disproportionately.

2087
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:41,000
I love it. That's it.

2088
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:42,000
That's it?

2089
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:43,000
That's it.

2090
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:47,000
We need more bowling alley emails. Mailbag at orangesontradio.com.

2091
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:48,000
And we're spent.

2092
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:52,000
So where's the craziest place you kids have listened to this show?

2093
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:55,000
That's kind of what I want to know, like, for real.

2094
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
I kind of miss strikes now.

2095
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
There still is a strike.

2096
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
I know, but that's why we need to go.

2097
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Oh, because you haven't been in a while.

2098
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:03,000
I haven't been in ages.

2099
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:04,000
All right.

2100
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:07,000
You know I was just in Reno. You know what they have in Reno?

2101
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:08,000
DDR1.

2102
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:13,000
No, no, no, not even. I did see a DDR supernova machine this way. I should have said that. I did see DDR supernovas.

2103
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Did you go to where your DDR cherry was popped?

2104
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:17,000
No, because that was in Vegas.

2105
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Oh, that's right. You went to Reno.

2106
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:22,000
I was at the Rocky Horror 25th Anniversary Convention the first time I played DDR.

2107
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:25,000
We decided to say, fuck it. We didn't go to Shock Treatment Night.

2108
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:34,000
But anyway, the story I really want to say, in Reno, they have, like, it's a huge bowling center that's, like, I think it's like the national bowling.

2109
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Did you go to Circus Circus?

2110
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's where I saw DDR supernova.

2111
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:41,000
But bowling! National. Oh, forget it.

2112
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Did they sell the Daytona machines there? Because they had, like, a ton of Daytona machines.

2113
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:53,000
No, actually, truth be told, Circus Circus, sad. I mean, because it's the same thing that happened to every other arcade.

2114
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Ticket machines. Ticket machines, ticket machines, ticket machines, ticket machines.

2115
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:01,000
And just like, um, just like Dark Tetsuya said about Country Club Lanes, which we haven't been to in forever,

2116
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Dark Tetsuya said, yeah, no DDR there anymore. This is all in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

2117
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Dark Tetsuya says, now it's all Dave and Buster style games like the Pac-Man Battle Royale and Faster Than Light or whatever that ticket game is.

2118
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Lame.

2119
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:17,000
I mean, I'd hope they at least gotten DDR X2, but X3 or X2 or X3 were the last.

2120
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:22,000
Yeah, Circus Circus, the only thing I caught, there was a driving game and I don't even remember which one it was.

2121
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:26,000
Uh, just one of the flashy, it wasn't even, it wasn't like Initial D or anything.

2122
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:30,000
It was, I think it was like, have they made a racing game out of Fast and Furious?

2123
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Yeah. I think it was that.

2124
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:35,000
The Fast and Furious games are very similar to, uh, Cruisin'. It's the same.

2125
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
Why can't we have Sugar Rush?

2126
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:41,000
It was that and DDR. And the rest, ticket games.

2127
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Uh, claw machines, the, you know, Circus Circus, the casinos have the whole carnival barkers and those games.

2128
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:53,000
That's still one of the few places you see that too. I mean, you know, now so many places have automated.

2129
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:54,000
Yeah.

2130
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:55,000
Horsey races and all that stuff.

2131
02:17:55,000 --> 02:18:02,000
They may have had, they may have buried them back in the arcades cause their arcades kind of go in like some subterranean caverns and crap back there.

2132
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:05,000
We looked, we did a whole little, now granted, it was really crowded when we were there.

2133
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Wow.

2134
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Which is weird.

2135
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Yeah, it was weird.

2136
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Well, Saturday night.

2137
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Silver Legacy has theirs tucked away in the childcare center.

2138
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:20,000
You know who had more arcade games was my favorite ghetto as fuck casino in the world. I love this place. Calneva.

2139
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Which is on the, it's on the strip in Reno. I just said Reno has a strip. It's so pathetic compared to Vegas.

2140
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:35,000
But it does have a strip and the Calneva is there and, uh, I love the Calneva cause it's just, it's just so ghetto.

2141
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:43,000
And you know, because there's no more Fitzgerald's or Virginia and you know, there's got, there's got to be a ghetto casino that holds that down.

2142
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:52,000
And so Calneva really tastes the cake, but on the second floor they have arcade games, but they don't have really a lot of ticket spitters probably cause they can't pay somebody to run a ticket counter.

2143
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:59,000
So they have like old ass recycled arcade games up there on the second floor. So that was pretty like a Neo Geo machine and that type of stuff.

2144
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
Yeah.

2145
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
No.

2146
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Anyhow.

2147
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
Let's move on.

2148
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:14,000
SSG 100 Matt says, was that the arcade in the wizard? I don't remember. Might've been.

2149
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Now I want to go look that up. Did they go to Reno in the wizard? Yes, they did.

2150
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:24,000
Holy shit. It probably touched my breast. Right. I thought that was Vegas for some reason. It was Reno.

2151
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:28,000
The only movie I associate with Reno is Sister Act.

2152
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:31,000
It's Reno and Gamora.

2153
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Uh, Oh yes. Speaking of, uh, Reno, it's time for the FUs of the week, everybody.

2154
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:39,000
Uh, where's the FU of the week music. Here it is.

2155
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:57,000
So 500 is going to come up. We're still going to have that same intro from seven years ago.

2156
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:02,000
I mean, Midi Head did a great job. It's great, but you know, seven years.

2157
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Hey Midi Head, if you're still listening to us, make us a new one, please.

2158
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,000
All right. Inhale.

2159
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:08,000
I won't scream.

2160
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
FU is the week time. Varsagra.

2161
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:19,000
I don't know. I guess FU did not having a job now, but at the same time, not having my old job is awesome.

2162
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:23,000
So I guess that's good.

2163
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:26,000
Yeah. I'm done.

2164
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Loki, um, FU to drivers making right turns.

2165
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:35,000
For some reason, people cannot make right turn fast enough for my satisfaction.

2166
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Like they will slow down to like no speed at all.

2167
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:42,000
I don't understand why it's so hard to make a right turn and to this dick.

2168
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Like, I don't know what it was.

2169
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Some guy coming off the freeway today and like went across five lanes, no signaling whatsoever.

2170
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:54,000
Oh, but managed to signal during his left turn.

2171
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Like actually in the middle of the turn, he flipped on a signal for no apparent reason.

2172
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:02,000
Stupid kid driver.

2173
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:07,000
My FU of the week goes to chain requirements on IAD.

2174
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Enough said.

2175
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:13,000
So I'm looking at Wikipedia.

2176
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:21,000
They finally arrive in Reno, where it is revealed that Haley wants her share of the prize money to help her father buy a house with the help of an acquaintance trucker.

2177
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:30,000
They use the money when it craps tables to train Jimmy on several games in the Reno arcades using Nintendo play choice, 10 machines.

2178
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Maybe that was, I need to find that scene online.

2179
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:39,000
So which, which, uh, they don't say on, on Wiki, what, what may have been set.

2180
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
So that's why it may have been a set.

2181
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
That's actually a very good point.

2182
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
All right. Anyhow.

2183
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:46,000
All right.

2184
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Um, so blockbusters closing more stores, which is kind of bad.

2185
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Um, they're closing up 300 stores in the U S here.

2186
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:58,000
They just closed another 160 in the UK where they've recently filed bankruptcy there.

2187
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:04,000
And, uh, that brings them down to a total of 500 stores in the States and 500 stores in the UK.

2188
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:13,000
What is kind of unique and not something that's actually reported on this article here in something I've got to know a little bit of information on is they're actually going to start doing game retail.

2189
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Oh, really?

2190
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:17,000
Yeah. Not just rental.

2191
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
You will be able to preorder your games there.

2192
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:20,000
Hmm.

2193
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:21,000
Soon.

2194
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:24,000
Actually starting with, uh, March.

2195
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
That's why I was on the call.

2196
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
I was on to this week.

2197
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Uh, yeah, so maybe they'll pick up your copy of a MLB or why I will be cause it's too late for that Bioshock though.

2198
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Bioshock infinite.

2199
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:41,000
You'll be able to pick up your local blockbuster if you are ever so inclined.

2200
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
Very important research I need to do here.

2201
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Live on this show.

2202
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
This is very, very, very important.

2203
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:51,000
First off, what is that guy in the background?

2204
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Okay, hold on.

2205
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:55,000
No one wears that.

2206
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
No one, no, nobody wears Speedos in public.

2207
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:58,000
All right, hold on.

2208
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
Got you, Jimmy boy.

2209
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
Time to go home, son.

2210
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:15,000
We're too late.

2211
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
He touched my breast!

2212
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:22,000
That is not the Calneva.

2213
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:25,000
The arcade at the Calneva is on the second floor.

2214
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
That does look like a Hollywood stage.

2215
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:28,000
It's probably where that was filmed.

2216
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:29,000
Yeah.

2217
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:30,000
They might've just said it was that.

2218
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Anyhow, very important, very important question we had to answer.

2219
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
I mean, that was crucial.

2220
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:40,000
I could not continue the show until I knew if that was the case.

2221
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:44,000
I could not continue the show until I knew if that was the Calneva or not.

2222
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:48,000
I wonder if she's used that line before.

2223
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:51,000
Like, now that she's grown up a bit.

2224
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:58,000
Shane Alingo in our chat room says, Jimmy grew up to be super hot.

2225
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:02,000
All right, moving on.

2226
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
One last story for you guys tonight.

2227
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:09,000
And this has to do with an arcade beat-em-up game coming to Facebook.

2228
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:13,000
And apparently it's turning some heads because it is a console-quality game.

2229
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:17,000
You know, when we think of Facebook games, we don't think of a lot of really great games.

2230
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:21,000
Or it's, you know, click and then give me money for more energy pills.

2231
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:24,000
Like, there's just not a lot of great, great games on Facebook.

2232
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:31,000
The only one that I think a lot of console and PC gamers will give any cred to is maybe, like, You Don't Know Jack.

2233
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:35,000
You know, because it's, you know, that kind of gets a little bit of a break.

2234
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:38,000
But not a lot of hardcore stuff on Facebook.

2235
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Well, I don't know if you guys knew about this, but there's a new developer, N-Way.

2236
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:46,000
And this is a San Francisco-based company. They were founded in 2011.

2237
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
It was founded by game industry veterans.

2238
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:54,000
And their sole purpose is console-quality multiplayer games to the web and mobile platforms.

2239
02:24:56,000 --> 02:25:00,000
David Jones is with this studio. He was the founder of DMA Designs.

2240
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:01,000
Wasn't he a monkey?

2241
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
Well, it's now Rockstar North.

2242
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:08,000
He created Lemmings and the original 2D Grand Theft Auto.

2243
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:13,000
Stieg Hedlund, who was the lead designer in the first two entries for Diablo.

2244
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:16,000
Chronoblade is the game that they've put together.

2245
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:21,000
Which, if you actually look at some of the screenshots, I'm like, that does kind of look like Diablo.

2246
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:25,000
But more of like a, I don't know, not like that same type of perspective.

2247
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:29,000
It looks a little more, I don't want to say hack and slash, because that is kind of Diablo.

2248
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
But you see, it looks like there's the red orb and the blue orb.

2249
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:37,000
And, you know, there is definitely, I mean, I look at this and I go, oh, this is like an Xbox Live arcade game, right?

2250
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:41,000
Nope. Apparently it is something that is on Facebook.

2251
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
They're calling it an arcade-style brawler.

2252
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:48,000
And it apparently is going to be very similar to Diablo.

2253
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:56,000
Chronoblade exists in a series of parallel worlds that will band together to fight against a common foe.

2254
02:25:56,000 --> 02:26:01,000
So, I'm assuming this means maybe the parallel universes is how you interact with your friends?

2255
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:09,000
I don't know, but they also say this is a way to have like a Viking-themed world and steampunk world and kind of cross all these areas together.

2256
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
So that's pretty cool.

2257
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:15,000
And it's going to be completely free to play and there is a beta sign-up website if you want to check that out.

2258
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:20,000
If, you know, maybe this will be the Facebook game that it will be okay to like.

2259
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Who knows?

2260
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
There you go.

2261
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:28,000
Would you play a game like that even though it's on Facebook?

2262
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:29,000
Loki?

2263
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:30,000
No.

2264
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
No? Alright, fair enough.

2265
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:33,000
I just know a Facebook game.

2266
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Yeah, I hear you.

2267
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:40,000
1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.

2268
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:44,000
And we'll take your calls here on the show for a few minutes here.

2269
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
And whatever you want to talk about tonight.

2270
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
If you want us to watch more scenes from the wizard, we can do that too.

2271
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Just let us know. I'll queue it up.

2272
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:51,000
That sounds so fun.

2273
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:52,000
Alright.

2274
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:55,000
I'm ready for each caller tonight. I will play a new scene from the wizard.

2275
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Alright.

2276
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Loki, do you have any last minute news stories while we wait for those calls to come in?

2277
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:05,000
Again, that's OrangeLoungeRadio all one word on Skype or 1877 Game OLR.

2278
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:09,000
Apparently there is a company, Team Pixel.

2279
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
They're an independent company.

2280
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:16,000
They are crowdfunding to buy THQ's Homeworld IP.

2281
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Apparently they are trying to raise, I guess, $50,000 by February 7th in order to acquire the property to make another Homeworld game.

2282
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Let's go to the phones. We have a call coming in.

2283
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2284
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
Oh, it is me. One named Jason.

2285
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Hey, Jason. Long time no see. How are you?

2286
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Yes, a terribly long time.

2287
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
I know, but you're back in Colorado now.

2288
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:50,000
I am back in Colorado after a seven hour train delay that got me in town at one o'clock in the morning and was kind of garbage by the end of it.

2289
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
But, you know, train problems.

2290
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:56,000
And now that you're back in Colorado, how was it to hear me bitch about one inch of snow ruining my day?

2291
02:27:56,000 --> 02:28:06,000
I chuckled, but I also kind of, I know exactly how you feel because when I first went out to California in March, St. Patrick's Day weekend,

2292
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:15,000
it was snowing over the Sierra Nevada and the bus that I was on had to throw on chains or some other, you know, whatever vehicle that size has to use

2293
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:21,000
and go like 25 miles an hour over Donner Pass and that whole bus ride was just garbage.

2294
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Well, thank you, Jason. You're a true friend, making the listeners understand my pain. So what did you really want to call in to talk about tonight?

2295
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Just kind of an idle thought when I was listening to you talk about your trip to Reno.

2296
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:37,000
A coworker mentioned something to me a couple of months ago, something along those lines.

2297
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:49,000
And he said that it was a sad day when he realized that audio, musical hardware companies produce things predominantly for churches and broadcast

2298
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:54,000
and not like musicians and clubs and studios or anything like that.

2299
02:28:54,000 --> 02:29:00,000
And so he started to get to explaining how as churches crop up and start having recordings

2300
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:06,000
and even if you know of churches that broadcast on the local stations over the air in the area.

2301
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:11,000
And I had thought about a church that I used to go to when I was really young

2302
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:17,000
and I remember being in the production studio and seeing all of those screens, this gigantic mixer,

2303
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:29,000
all of the audio coming out of these ridiculously powerful speakers for recording an orchestra, the preacher and whatever else that they have going on.

2304
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:36,000
I could see that. There's a lot of television around the church program and so forth and I always associate church in my mind.

2305
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:45,000
The church I went to when I was younger was a very small place and the whole freaking place could probably hold maybe 80 people.

2306
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:53,000
So there was nothing like what you're talking about. But I know there's other churches like you get these mega churches that are like, you know, that it's like going to a rock concert.

2307
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:58,000
You know what they call my church? When I lived in Alabama, six flags over Jesus.

2308
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:02,000
Seriously, go to Google Maps and look up Dauphinway Baptist Church.

2309
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:09,000
Oh, I know. Texas has some just like some churches buy arenas. They are that big.

2310
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:10,000
We built an arena.

2311
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:14,000
So, yeah, no, I told like now that you're saying this, I'm like, yeah, that makes sense.

2312
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:27,000
And it is kind of an interesting parallel to and I'm assuming that's the parallel you were making, too, is that a lot of stuff that maybe we get in gaming might have been developed for, you know, lounge gaming or whatever you want to call it, casino gaming.

2313
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Yeah, absolutely. And you already you already laid all of it out when you were talking about it, because, sure, the DS is a tiny screen and has two screen depth 3D.

2314
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:44,000
But you were just talking about and I saw the picture to a four screen. I don't know how big was that? Would you say one hundred fifty inch screen?

2315
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:51,000
Oh, that is gigantic. Yeah. I mean, it had enough space so that you had, I think, for you saw Alan posted on Facebook.

2316
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Right. It had like room for at least, I think, six people to sit. Yeah.

2317
02:30:56,000 --> 02:31:04,000
And, you know, that was one edge of the screen to the other. And they're like those fancy chairs that, you know, vibrate like you feel the bass in your ass.

2318
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:10,000
If you hit the jackpot. I mean, that's got to be one fun chair to sit in when you get a jackpot.

2319
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:14,000
It's a Sex and the City game, for fuck's sake. And that only makes it even better.

2320
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
That explains everything.

2321
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:20,000
That is. Oh, my God. That was the part that blew me away. I'm like.

2322
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:21,000
This game is orgasmic.

2323
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:29,000
Really? This? Like, Deal or No Deal? I get that. Wheel of Fortune? I get that. Sex and the City? What?

2324
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:39,000
But, you know, there's a lot of little old ladies that love Sex and the City and they love Reno. So, I guess it does make sense.

2325
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:51,000
And a lot of people, I remember CES both this and last year, I believe, that people, they scoff about the 100-inch TVs and the, you know, the life-size TVs and everything else like that.

2326
02:31:51,000 --> 02:32:00,000
It's like, oh, yeah, Bill Gates is going to have three of these in his house. I have, the Red Robin closest to me has an 80-inch TV in one of the dining areas.

2327
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:13,000
And it's mighty impressive to look at. But it's, there's certainly application for all of this stuff that you wouldn't imagine would be the result after seeing it shown off and the fact that they really do advertise it to everybody.

2328
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:17,000
And the best and most rich people pick them up.

2329
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
Like, essentially, rich companies, rather.

2330
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:33,000
Very good point is that we often forget about the many commercial uses of this stuff. You know, there is a very large football game occurring next week that people are going to want to, you know, go to a bar together and watch.

2331
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:39,000
And I hope that bar has one of these 100-screen TVs if they want to fit a lot of people in there and they can all get a good view of the game, you know?

2332
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:43,000
One very small related note that I figured I would talk about.

2333
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:44,000
Sure.

2334
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:54,000
I read something a while ago about, like, corporate parties and big conventions, notably, like, for example, oh, I don't know, the Democratic and Republican national conventions.

2335
02:32:54,000 --> 02:33:02,000
The rentals for these kind of items don't really exist, so they buy up these huge gobs of resources, of digital resources.

2336
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:07,000
And I've even heard stories about, oh, crap, what were they called? Segways. There we go.

2337
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:12,000
And they sell that stuff off to recoup as much cost as possible dirt cheap.

2338
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:24,000
So if you know anybody that puts together some kind of a party where they have to buy up expensive items, keep talking to them after it wraps up because there's probably a good chance you'll get some serious deals on things.

2339
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:31,000
If you live in a swing state that's likely to host one of these conventions in 2016, check Craigslist the next day. That's what you're saying?

2340
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:43,000
I don't know. I'm pretty sure there's a lot of legislation that tries to go along Craigslist, but you never know. Maybe a staffer got their hands on something and, oh, sure, I'll buy it and throw it in the till. I mean, it could happen.

2341
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:50,000
Trust me, you never know. The Democratic and Republican parties aren't technically a part of the government. They're their own independent things.

2342
02:33:50,000 --> 02:34:00,000
And trust me, as somebody who used to date a politician, I used this word earlier and got yelled at for it, but I'm going to use it here. It's very interesting to see how all that works.

2343
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:08,000
Anyhow, that's all I'll say. I gotta ask you this before I let you go. What is this I'm seeing in chat? You still to this day have not seen The Wizard?

2344
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:13,000
You know, I was wondering who was going to bring it up, but I didn't think it would be during this call.

2345
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:14,000
Surprise!

2346
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:22,000
The first answer is that me and movies, oh, that looks interesting and it's not in theaters anymore. Oh, that looks interesting and it's not in theaters anymore.

2347
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:34,000
I really enjoy movies and I really don't see very many of them. It's very strange. But I didn't even see, not Captain N, oh, the Mario Brothers Super Show. I didn't watch that until Ryan made me watch it like two years ago.

2348
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:41,000
Somehow I missed that in my youth and plenty of other of these fun little gaming things that everybody knows about, except for me.

2349
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:45,000
Well, all I have to say is you better set aside 90 minutes next time you're in the Bay Area.

2350
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
I don't have a problem with that.

2351
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:51,000
All right. All right, buddy, I'm going to let you go try and get another call in, all right? Have a good one.

2352
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:52,000
Thanks, YouTube.

2353
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:53,000
All right, bye.

2354
02:34:53,000 --> 02:35:05,000
Very interesting, you know, that sometimes there's these uses for things that we don't always think about. That's a very interesting, like the music, DJ stuff, churches are a big business for that.

2355
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
Who would have thought of that?

2356
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:14,000
I always remembered we actually had a really, again, this was at the mega church that I went to. God, thank God I'm not around that anymore.

2357
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:26,000
But they had a whole full AV set up with like something, I want to say, like five different sound panels, spotlights, you name it, and an orchestra pit. I'm not joking.

2358
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:31,000
Wow. Good. Big stuff. All right, we got another call coming in, so let's go to it.

2359
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2360
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:37,000
It's Jim Sully. Woo!

2361
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:38,000
Hey, buddy, how you doing?

2362
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:41,000
Dude, Rob.

2363
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:42,000
Me?

2364
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:45,000
You got an inch of snow and you're going to put chains on your tires? Come on.

2365
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
I checked the-

2366
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:48,000
For an inch of snow?

2367
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Google I-80 chain controls. This is public information. Google it from last night. I swear to God. I don't make the rules, the Highway Patrol or Caltrans or whoever does.

2368
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:06,000
I think it's, well, I would say I think it's silly, but at the same time, driving home, we saw two accidents.

2369
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:11,000
And there wasn't even really snow on the road, but there was still a little bit of ice and the residue snow.

2370
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:22,000
And we saw about like six dude bros in a Suzuki crash their car, airbags deployed and everything and scary stuff.

2371
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:27,000
An inch of snow or not, it's how it kind of fucks with those roads.

2372
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:34,000
And again, I want to remind you guys, you're going downhill for a big part of that. Once you cross Donner Summit, you're going downhill.

2373
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:37,000
I don't, I barely step on the gas driving home.

2374
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:44,000
Listen, Rob, two days ago I got seven inches of snow.

2375
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:51,000
And it was, I'm not kidding you, it was minus 40 Celsius, which is like, I think minus 45 Fahrenheit. Yeah.

2376
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:54,000
The cars wouldn't start, Rob. The cars would not start.

2377
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:59,000
Wait, where in Canada do you live again?

2378
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:07,000
I'm Elk Lake, so I am like, do you know where Detroit is? I know where Detroit is. I'm 10 hours north of Buffalo.

2379
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:13,000
Oh my God. Wow. This is where I live, buddy. 10 hours north of Buffalo.

2380
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:16,000
10 hours north of Buffalo.

2381
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:21,000
Wow. Oh yeah, I see this huge, huge lake in Canada. So you live by this big lake?

2382
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Well, it's the Montreal River. I live, the Montreal River goes right through my backyard.

2383
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:31,000
I'm 100 feet from ice fishing right now, pickerel, buddy. I got seven this morning.

2384
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:39,000
But listen, listen, forget about this. You were talking before, too, about the craziest place that people have listened to Orange Lounge Radio.

2385
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:47,000
Dude, like six years ago, I guess. Like, yeah, about six. I think you guys were on, you guys were on the old place.

2386
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:52,000
And I started listening to you guys. And then I worked at this sausage factory called Schneider's.

2387
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:59,000
And I was an elevator operator. I just moved the elevator up and down five floors with meat on it. That was my job all day.

2388
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:04,000
And then Sunday nights when I could get away, I'd go to the top of the elevator where the little motor is and stuff.

2389
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:13,000
And I actually had an ethernet cord that I pulled through from the third floor, up the fourth floor, up the fifth floor into this room in an old, old 386 or Pentium II.

2390
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:19,000
It was an old computer, but I could just barely run fucking Winamp on it. And I would listen to OLR for the last three hours of my shift.

2391
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:26,000
Oh my god. We were in some empty-ass elevator in the middle of Canada. That with an ethernet...

2392
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:29,000
At the top of a sausage factory. At least it was the top of a sausage factory, right?

2393
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
Wow.

2394
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:36,000
And that was it. That was my job every Sunday night. Because there was nothing to do Sunday nights. The other shift would end at seven.

2395
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:41,000
But I would get paid to stay there till midnight because someone's gonna be on the elevator. Like, do the fucking union jobs, right?

2396
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:46,000
Oh my god. Talking about the long ethernet cable that makes me think of the year.

2397
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:52,000
Do you remember when we did the live DDR tournament in San Francisco? B3 or whatever it was called? At Pier 39.

2398
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:58,000
We actually broadcast from Pier 39. It's one of our more, like, if we were to make a resume, like the Orange Mountains Radio & Resume, that would be on there.

2399
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:05,000
Because, you know, Pier 39 is a big touristy spot. And we had to run. Do we have to go to Radio Shack and buy, like, a 100-foot cable?

2400
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:06,000
I think so.

2401
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:07,000
To run it? To where?

2402
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:10,000
Yeah, that's what I had to do too. I had to steal one from the IT department.

2403
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Oh my god.

2404
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:18,000
One for a cable or a spool. I had to go to maintenance and get, like, this drill. Dude, the drill bit on this drill that the maintenance guy gave me was sick.

2405
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:23,000
It was, like, two and a half feet long with a big brick bit on it. And I was like, well, where can I drill it?

2406
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:24,000
But now how does it feel?

2407
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:27,000
Anywhere you want. Don't hit a wire.

2408
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:34,000
How do you feel knowing now, like, six years later? Like, no problem. Just bring up the iPhone and, well, then I don't know.

2409
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:35,000
Oh, I know, right?

2410
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:38,000
I don't know what kind of coverage you have up there, but, I mean, even if on three...

2411
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:39,000
Well, excellent coverage.

2412
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:40,000
Oh, then you can...

2413
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:45,000
We have DSL. We have the same DSL that I had when I lived down south, but there's 500 people in my town, so it never slows down.

2414
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:46,000
Oh my gosh.

2415
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Like, there's no tweeners. There's... If you go to the elementary school, there's 12 kids, I think, from the ages of 10 to 16 in the entire town.

2416
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
Oh, boy oh boy.

2417
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
It's so... I know, eh? It's a different life.

2418
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:05,000
Jim, you've thrown the gauntlet, and I love what SSJ100 Matt is suggesting in chat. We should have this topic as a FUGL question.

2419
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
Strangest place you've listened to OLR.

2420
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:08,000
That's a hell of a way to...

2421
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:09,000
Good luck, people.

2422
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
Yeah, it's... I'm curious to know this.

2423
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:14,000
Who's gonna be the top of an elevator at a sausage factory?

2424
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:15,000
I don't know.

2425
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:19,000
With a hundred foot of Ethernet cord going downstairs to a manager's office that I had to break into.

2426
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:25,000
I had to break into a manager's office and install a router so that I could take the cord out of the back of his computer and stick it in the little router bridge thing.

2427
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
Look, you know what I'm talking about.

2428
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:30,000
And then you have to stick the other cord in because you can't just stick the two cords together.

2429
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:31,000
No, no, no.

2430
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
Could have a little router thing in the middle.

2431
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:34,000
You're hardcore, Jim.

2432
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:35,000
Oh my god.

2433
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:41,000
I was hardcore. Don't take this the wrong way. I was desperate to listen to anything besides, like, Canadian radio.

2434
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:44,000
I didn't want to listen to anywhere Canadian radio.

2435
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:47,000
And ever since then, Rob, I've been in love with you, man.

2436
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:48,000
Was it all Alanis and Rush?

2437
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Well, shucks.

2438
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:56,000
Every time I think about packing sausage, Rob, I think of you.

2439
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:59,000
Well, the only sausage factory I think of is a place in the Castro.

2440
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
And it's not what you think. It's actually an Italian restaurant.

2441
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:05,000
But it's funny because when you talk about the sausage factory, I'm like, oh, it's a yummy restaurant in the Castro.

2442
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:08,000
The Castro is, like, the gayest part of San Francisco.

2443
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
Yes. But anyway.

2444
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:16,000
Well, Jim, I'm going to let you go. Before I let you go, I'm just going to say, in my defense about the whole, like, one inch of snow thing,

2445
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:22,000
come to my neck of the woods sometimes and get through 105 degrees summer.

2446
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:27,000
Oh, I'm looking for two plane tickets now. I can use it.

2447
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:32,000
You'll melt. All right. Jim, buddy, have a good one. And thanks for the story. That was great.

2448
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
You too, guys. Everyone be safe, okay?

2449
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:35,000
All right. Bye.

2450
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:39,000
Don't forget. Don't forget, okay? This is winter driving safety tip, okay?

2451
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:40,000
Okay.

2452
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:48,000
If you're going up a hill and your tires start to spin, you're giving it too much gas or not enough.

2453
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
What a helpful tip.

2454
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:53,000
And he hung up on that. You jerk.

2455
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
Where did you find that?

2456
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:58,000
No, very important Allen question. Where did you find that?

2457
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:02,000
It was on the nice leather recliner, but under a Snuggie.

2458
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:03,000
Snuggie was hiding it.

2459
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:08,000
We couldn't find the fourth microphone for Allen tonight. Apparently, it was under a Snuggie.

2460
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:12,000
Who knew? Speaking of cold.

2461
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Yes, how many Snuggies do you have to wear for minus 40?

2462
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
Is that, like, five layers of Snuggie?

2463
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:22,000
I don't know. I think your body just gets used to it at some point, you know?

2464
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
Yes, it gets used to it when you're dead.

2465
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:28,000
Stop it. All right, let's go to the phones. We have another call coming in. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio. Who's this?

2466
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
Hey, hey, hey. It's Ronma.

2467
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
Hey, hey, hey. What's up, Ronma?

2468
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:38,000
Hey, not much. I'm in a bit of a pissy mood. I want to vent.

2469
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:45,000
Well, please. When I think of where do I want to vent, I think of Orange Lawn's Radio. Please, by all means, the stage is yours.

2470
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:53,000
Well, every morning, part of my normal routine, I read the paper. I get to a certain point in the paper. I put it down and go about my business.

2471
02:42:53,000 --> 02:43:02,000
So, I'm reading the editorials like I usually do. Did I see something here in the paper? I swear to you, I have never seen before.

2472
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:05,000
I have a bad feeling I know where this is going. Go for it.

2473
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:12,000
Oh, you! Coming off of what we explored on our podcast last week. Oh.

2474
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:22,000
Yeah, the title goes, Put the Blame on Video Games. Never in the entire moment I wanted to punch a window so badly in my life.

2475
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:32,000
There are people out there that think this way. This is a shocking reality, and it is infuriating that people could be so ignorant.

2476
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:36,000
What was the gist of the argument, or did you even get that far?

2477
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:43,000
It was only two paragraphs from two different people. That's all it was. It's just one person.

2478
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:49,000
Now, what is local? They're pretty much just saying the biggest reason for gun violence is the violence associated with video games.

2479
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:56,000
They are a breeding ground for future murderers. It is too easy to sit in front of a video game and shoot animated figures on the screen.

2480
02:43:56,000 --> 02:44:02,000
There is no moral responsibility for the characters you shoot up. There is no pain when your character is killed or wounded.

2481
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:07,000
It is all done knowing that the only thing you have to do is reload the game to get a new life.

2482
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:17,000
Okay, now, if all the violence I've done through video games, and that means when I see someone trying to shoot my ass, I should see them sitting there with an Xbox 360 controller trying to target and auto-aim.

2483
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:28,000
A breeding ground for future murderers. Well, Dark Sakura, you know, since you're job hunting again, you could be a murderer. That could be your new career.

2484
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:29,000
Contract killer?

2485
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:38,000
Yes. I mean, because you play video games, clearly. What did you say you've been playing this week? Mass Effect and Bomberman mixed with Pac-Man? Well, shit.

2486
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
You're a terrorist. Bomberman.

2487
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Oh boy, yeah, you bomb things.

2488
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:49,000
Except if I was actually gonna be a contract killer, I'd use, like, blades and poisons, so that doesn't work for me. Not my style, sorry.

2489
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:52,000
Well, you're gonna have to play more Thief and Assassin's Creed.

2490
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:58,000
Nope. The only thing video games taught me how to do is throw balloons at people.

2491
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:01,000
Because, you know, we don't know right from wrong.

2492
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:05,000
And I can't do magic, so clearly, you know, WoW hasn't helped me.

2493
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:12,000
Because gamers, gaming, Rama has some, you know, obviously I'm not saying this at you, but the person who wrote that.

2494
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:17,000
Gamers, obviously, we don't know how to tell the difference between the real world and our digital world.

2495
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:24,000
You know, just like movies are real. All movies are documentaries. The Blair Witch Project, totally true. Right?

2496
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:29,000
Wow. Yeah.

2497
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
It was a horror film, that's for sure.

2498
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:43,000
But, Rob, the thing that really pissed me off the most about this is that something like this you would expect in the New York Post, or as I like to call it, the Republican News Daily.

2499
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:48,000
This came out of the Daily News, the leftist paper that I read.

2500
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:59,000
Guess what? Leland Yee is a Democrat. Idiocy does not know Republican and Democrat balance. There are idiots on both sides. That's another harsh reality.

2501
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:01,000
Idiocy is non-partisan.

2502
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:07,000
Yeah, idiocy is non-partisan. And there are people that are way too extreme in their thinking on both sides. That's reality.

2503
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:16,000
You know, after the initial shock event, I realized, you know, this is why I'm in the middle. I hear what both sides have to say before I make my decision.

2504
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
That's the way I look at it. Because this is just, no.

2505
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:21,000
Yep.

2506
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:27,000
Maybe there should be, like, I know we always talk about third party. There needs to be a third party in this country.

2507
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:35,000
Well, let's start somewhere with, like, you know, just, like, not being so naive when it comes to media.

2508
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:41,000
I like what SSJ100Mass said. I was a white mage in Final Fantasy XI. I guess that gives me the credentials to perform surgery.

2509
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:43,000
Absolutely. Curata.

2510
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:47,000
I'm really good at, um, crap, what's that surgery game now?

2511
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:49,000
Trauma.

2512
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:50,000
Trauma Center.

2513
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:57,000
You know, I should be a weatherman because I was a black mage in Final Fantasy XI, so, you know, it's gonna rain. Bolt 3, motherfucker.

2514
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

2515
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:10,000
Well, Rama, thank you for making us all angry. Thank you for sharing in your pain with all of us here and the listeners. We really appreciate it. Anything else you want to, uh...

2516
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:14,000
IkumaJP makes a good statement. White mage doesn't perform surgery, they just pray.

2517
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:16,000
Heal, please. Prop, please.

2518
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:19,000
Alright, uh, Rama, anything else you want to share with the listeners before I let you go tonight?

2519
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:32,000
Yes, listen to this week's episode of Anime Jam Session. We go over two hours. We post, we added a special rant because some dipshit decided to post their rules for cosplay.

2520
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:34,000
Oh, I remember reading that, bitch.

2521
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:36,000
Oh, no.

2522
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:44,000
Yes, yes, because of me going nuts and a bunch of other people, she took the post down and locked, and she deleted her like page.

2523
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:50,000
But it's still archived, because once it's on the internet, it's there forever, and people have reposted the archive.

2524
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:55,000
Rama, this is for this week's episode of Anime Jam Session. I'll let you borrow this, okay?

2525
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:09,000
You know what else pissed me off in the cosplay world this week? And this was all over Tumblr. But there was this girl at a convention, and I don't remember which one, sorry.

2526
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:14,000
Oh, I remember reading about that. There are people that I associate with that are friends with her.

2527
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:16,000
No, wait, what happened? What happened?

2528
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:22,000
I didn't even say who it was. It's like you read my mind. Okay, it was the girl in the TARDIS dress.

2529
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:24,000
Oh, yeah, she was...

2530
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:26,000
And she opened up the bottom part.

2531
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:28,000
She was awesome!

2532
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
It was awesome! Like, how fucking clever is that, right?

2533
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:41,000
And then, so there's this screen grab on Tumblr of her, and then all these Facebook comments. She's fat. I guess it really is bigger on the inside. All this other, like, just really...

2534
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:42,000


2535
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:48,000
Yeah, garbage is the only way to say it. And I'm like, I thought she was hot, to be honest.

2536
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:49,000


2537
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:53,000
I'd like to see those assholes cosplay and pull off something that clever.

2538
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:54,000


2539
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:55,000
And I bet...

2540
02:48:56,000 --> 02:49:05,000
I'm not sure what the thing is. That argument's been going on in the cosplay world for years, because there are actual photographers that refuse to take pictures of people that are plus size.

2541
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:07,000
Oh, my God.

2542
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:09,000
And when, like, they don't exist, drama.

2543
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:19,000
I show them my photos. I'm like, you see these plus-sized cosplayers? They're doing some remarkable, a remarkable job in what they do. I'd like to see someone skinny pull that off. Just saying.

2544
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:33,000
Tigerclaw in chat says, Travis talked about this last night on Understation Live. I was in Reno. That's my excuse. I'm waiting for the podcast before I hear, but I will, I'm sure they covered it very well, so I will tip my hat and mention Understation Live this week.

2545
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:46,000
Hopefully they get the podcast updated soon, because I would like to, I would love to hear those guys rant on the TARDIS thing, because that was, I, she was, I thought she was a great looking gal and very clever.

2546
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:49,000
Yes. Yes, it was. It was phenomenal. Simple as that.

2547
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
I want to wear that dress for, like, a wedding.

2548
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:57,000
I would wear that dress. Shit. All right. Rama, I gotta let you go, all right?

2549
02:49:58,000 --> 02:49:59,000
Oh, you got it, bro.

2550
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:01,000
All right. Take care, buddy. Later.

2551
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:11,000
All right. Thank you guys so much for the calls. I do have to wrap up. I'm going to close up the Skypline for tonight. If you did not get through, though, I always say please write down your thoughts, send an email, make Jamie work.

2552
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:20,000
Mailbag at orangeontrader.com. Or Twitter. I gotta get to Twitter topics as well. Loki, did you have last minute stories before I get to the tweets?

2553
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:22,000
There's just a couple tonight.

2554
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
There were layoffs over at Superbot. Thanks.

2555
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:26,000


2556
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:30,000
Yeah, Sony confirmed that, so that kind of sucks. They didn't say how many, though.

2557
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:45,000
All right. Let's see. Just a couple quick tweets here. And actually, let me, I'm sorry, guys. I'm going to pull this up. Live radio. It's a blast. I'm pulling this up on the show computer because I couldn't find my iPad because I think it's still in the luggage.

2558
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
So, I'm bringing up the show computer tweets real quick.

02:50:48,000 --> 02:51:04,000
There were two, and the first one was from, here we go, Tigerclaw. Disney is prepared to look at game violence because, you know, there is that call on the industry. Are games to violence? Well, Disney.

2560
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:12,000
You know, when I think who's putting out the most violent video games in existence right now, I go, oh, shit, it's Disney. You know, right?

2561
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:22,000
But to be fair, Disney, you know, they stuck their big toe in the water with the more serious gaming with the whole split second, but then again, they closed that studios. I don't know.

2562
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:26,000
The only violent game I can think of that they published was Turok.

2563
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:44,000
Well, Robert Iger said, quote, at Disney, there's very little violent content, but I still want to make sure we're asking ourselves the right questions in term of that standard and also ensure we're willing to be a part of a dialogue in today's world that I think is pretty necessary in terms of what our role is and what our role should be.

2564
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:49,000
You know, I got to be honest. I wouldn't read too much into that. I think he's just saying the right answer.

2565
02:51:50,000 --> 02:52:08,000
You know, because at the video game industry, you don't really want to poo poo it. I think it was smart that all those guys went to go meet with Biden when he asked the video game companies to meet with him because it's like, if you don't sit there and represent yourself, somebody else will do it for you and it's probably not the person you want representing yourself.

2566
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:17,000
So, I think it's nice that Disney said this, but it's kind of the expected answer, I think.

2567
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:29,000
One more tweet here from SSJ100Matt who tweeted us, new age of gaming classifieds. A group has started on Facebook for people looking to buy, sell, rent arcade machines.

2568
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:37,000
Really? Arcade Exchange, a Facebook community for buying and selling the classics. Maybe you can find one of these for Pinball Dark Sakura.

2569
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:44,000
It is listed as a page created to help bring together the hundreds of collectors and enthusiasts from around the world into one place.

2570
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:51,000
It's through Facebook, but it allows members to post their for sale or wanted ads just for arcade machines and their related parts.

2571
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:57,000
That's kind of rad. I'm going to look at the Facebook community myself right now.

2572
02:52:57,000 --> 02:53:09,000
Facebook.com slash Arcade Exchange, all one word. Oh yeah. Ooh, a Killer Instinct PCB, HD and Marquee. It doesn't boot up, but it's 75 bucks.

2573
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:15,000
That's just, that's like literally just the little board, not even the machine or anything. That's still kind of neat though.

2574
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:26,000
A Pump It Up Fiesta 2010 upgrade kit for $400. Oh look, pinball machines. There's a Terminator 2, Roadshow, Revenge from Mars.

2575
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:34,000
That's pretty cool. I wouldn't mind the Revenge from Mars. Revenge from Mars, 1800 bucks. Yeah, that one's going to be expensive.

2576
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:39,000
Huh. That's neat. Thanks for that link. That's a great one. Maybe get rid of my stuff.

2577
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:46,000
Uh, one more tweet from Ross Steel UT coming in here at the last minute. I'll read this. Can gaming get outside of the man cave?

2578
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:52,000
The reaction to people speaking against the Dead Island statue suggests we're still stuck in.

2579
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:59,000
I'm not sure I'm following the logic on that. Wouldn't people speaking out against the Dead Island statue be a good thing?

2580
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:10,000
Because that was pretty irresponsible. And it was not, it was just, it was, it's just in bad taste. That whole thing was just in bad taste.

2581
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:20,000
But am I, am I thinking that maybe the statue itself suggests that we're still stuck in? You need to send an email, Sarah. I want to, I would love to hear your thoughts. Elaborated.

2582
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:30,000
Nailbag at orange lounge radio.com. Um, more, uh, last minute stories tonight. Loki. No, no, I guess that's it then. That's it. Yeah.

2583
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:37,000
We're wrapping up the show. It's about that time anyway. Uh, we're going to go around and get last minute thoughts in a minute here and final thoughts and all that.

2584
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:44,000
But, uh, first I want to say thank you very much for downloading our show tonight. Thank you for tuning into orange lounge radio and supporting independent podcasting.

2585
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:56,000

2586
02:54:57,000 --> 02:55:05,000
Um, just help spread the word. That's all we ask. So, all right, let's, uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night and we'll start with Loki. Your final thoughts tonight.

2587
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:15,000
I almost bought another game for steam. Um, it's addicting. Well, it has max pain, max pain threes down the 14 bucks and I mean that's a $60 game right there. So there you go.

2588
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:26,000
Um, I may do that cause I wanted to see how the multiplayer combat games for rockstar have gotten since, uh, granted thought of, uh, dark soccer. Your final thought tonight.

2589
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:49,000
And my final thought tonight is it's time for more Nino Cooney. Thank you everybody very much for listening to the show tonight. We'll be back to do it again next week. I think, uh, stay tuned to our Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R, but one way or another, for those of you that celebrate it, enjoy the football game on Sunday.

2590
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:57,000
And for those of you that don't enjoy the empty shopping malls and all the other things that there will be to do next Sunday. Have a great week or museums as the case may be. Right?

2591
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:01,000
Yes, that's right. I'm going to the Crocker Museum to see a Norman Rockwell exhibit.

2592
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:05,000
Sounds like fun. All right. Have a great night everybody. We'll see you next time. And next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
