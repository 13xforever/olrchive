00:14.141 --> 00:24.884
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, January 20th, 2013, the final Rainfall game is set to come to the US, Sony plans to make a big sale, and Disney Infinity is finally officially unveiled.

00:31.758 --> 00:37.121
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.201 --> 00:43.924
[SPEAKER_09]: It is Orange Lounge Radio with episode 490 of our show for this January the 20th of 2013.

00:45.685 --> 00:56.570
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next several hours to talk about video games and the gamer lifestyle along with those of you in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and the all important co-hosts here on the show.

00:56.710 --> 00:59.211
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, say hello to Jamie Summers.

00:59.411 --> 01:00.132
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not in the kitchen.

01:00.632 --> 01:01.793
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you doing out of the kitchen?

01:02.973 --> 01:03.654
[SPEAKER_05]: Hosting a show.

01:03.914 --> 01:04.234
[SPEAKER_09]: No, wait.

01:04.294 --> 01:04.414
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

01:04.835 --> 01:05.135
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

01:05.195 --> 01:06.135
[SPEAKER_09]: Put the angry emails down.

01:06.155 --> 01:07.296
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not a sexist joke.

01:07.336 --> 01:08.717
[SPEAKER_09]: She was actually in the kitchen making coffee.

01:08.737 --> 01:09.417
[SPEAKER_05]: Making coffee.

01:09.457 --> 01:12.419
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I have chocolate mint cream ready to go in my chocolate mint coffee.

01:12.539 --> 01:12.779
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:12.819 --> 01:13.459
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

01:13.600 --> 01:13.940
[SPEAKER_09]: Minty.

01:14.100 --> 01:14.660
[SPEAKER_09]: Minty Fresh.

01:15.281 --> 01:16.381
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like tonight's show?

01:16.501 --> 01:16.801
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:17.462 --> 01:20.724
[SPEAKER_09]: Say hello to the always fresh Tech Master Loki.

01:20.944 --> 01:21.184
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

01:21.544 --> 01:23.005
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember when Fresh was a compliment?

01:23.865 --> 01:24.686
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I remember the 90s.

01:24.846 --> 01:29.809
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Funky Fresh or I always think of Crescent Fresh from Syphil and Ollie, which was an underrated TV show.

01:30.464 --> 01:33.385
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Syphil and Ollie, not Syphilis, DarkSakura.

01:33.425 --> 01:35.346
[SPEAKER_09]: Be quiet when you're in the kitchen.

01:35.486 --> 01:36.886
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder how their rebirth is doing.

01:37.286 --> 01:38.307
[SPEAKER_07]: I say that because she doesn't have a mic.

01:38.327 --> 01:40.528
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I remember like, hey, Syphil and Ollie are coming back.

01:40.548 --> 01:41.388
[SPEAKER_07]: They're doing game reviews.

01:42.388 --> 01:43.009
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

01:43.049 --> 01:44.569
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot after the first episode.

01:44.589 --> 01:45.049
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

01:45.069 --> 01:46.390
[SPEAKER_09]: The first episode was funny, though.

01:47.230 --> 01:51.251
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe, see, I think maybe that's the type of thing you're just going to have to marathon during a weekend.

01:51.291 --> 01:56.392
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, some people marathon, what, Game of Thrones or what else?

01:56.412 --> 01:57.792
[SPEAKER_09]: What are the other big TV shows people watch?

01:58.153 --> 02:02.494
[SPEAKER_09]: True Blood, if you're Jamie, Supernatural, and only Jamie.

02:02.914 --> 02:05.094
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Doctor Who, that's one a lot of people marathon.

02:05.494 --> 02:08.415
[SPEAKER_09]: Once Upon a Time, my friends, which, okay.

02:09.173 --> 02:31.916
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt Cross actually we did we did actually have an anime night at my house kind of we actually we watched Matt Cross Do You Remember Love but then we watched the live-action Rurouni Kenshin movie and it was amazeballs oh yeah you invited me to come over and watch that yeah but you said no we got stuck doing something else yeah but Alan was working the Rurouni Kenshin movie was amazeballs was it yeah good times all right

02:32.316 --> 02:39.221
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, again, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network.

02:39.281 --> 02:43.084
[SPEAKER_09]: That is vognetwork.com right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

02:43.124 --> 02:45.686
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want to participate live with our show, join us.

02:46.207 --> 02:47.328
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a live chat room.

[SPEAKER_09]: So if you do happen to be tuned in live tonight, make sure you're in the chat room to get the full experience.

02:51.711 --> 02:53.852
[SPEAKER_09]: Live.vognetwork.com.

02:54.213 --> 02:57.415
[SPEAKER_09]: And it is possible to chat and multitask and do other things.

02:57.455 --> 02:58.176
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't take offense.

02:58.616 --> 03:04.158
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to listen to the show, chat, and play, I don't know, World of Warcraft or whatever computer game, Civ 5, whatever computer game.

03:04.178 --> 03:05.759
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're watching sports ball, I'll shoot you.

03:06.599 --> 03:07.120
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop it.

03:07.440 --> 03:08.120
[SPEAKER_09]: That's disrespectful.

03:08.140 --> 03:09.041
[SPEAKER_05]: With a rubber band.

03:09.081 --> 03:10.001
[SPEAKER_05]: That's disrespectful.

03:10.021 --> 03:10.801
[SPEAKER_05]: With a rubber band.

03:11.502 --> 03:17.444
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of sports ball, there was no Bobby Blackwolf tonight because there was some big sports ball games going on.

03:19.625 --> 03:20.545
[SPEAKER_09]: Ironically enough, our...

03:22.407 --> 03:24.729
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan calls them the 40 whiners

03:38.342 --> 03:39.643
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know I hate sports ball

03:57.850 --> 03:58.110
[SPEAKER_09]: Outro Music

04:15.697 --> 04:16.497
[SPEAKER_09]: What's wrong with you?

04:16.557 --> 04:17.418
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, or gaming.

04:18.218 --> 04:19.659
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to talk about esports in a minute.

04:19.919 --> 04:21.240
[SPEAKER_05]: Acid Vampire made me cry.

04:21.400 --> 04:26.382
[SPEAKER_09]: But just to be clear, just to be clear, if I have a team, it is the Minnesota Vikings.

04:27.122 --> 04:28.523
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's because of Chris Cluey.

04:28.543 --> 04:28.803
[SPEAKER_01]: Chirp.

04:29.743 --> 04:30.284
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris Cluey.

04:30.304 --> 04:30.424
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

04:30.504 --> 04:30.644
[SPEAKER_01]: Who?

04:31.044 --> 04:31.564
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris Cluey.

04:31.825 --> 04:35.928
[SPEAKER_09]: He is the guy that wrote, he plays World of Warcraft for one.

04:36.148 --> 04:38.710
[SPEAKER_09]: He's an NFL player that plays World of Warcraft for one, which makes him awesome.

04:39.030 --> 04:44.073
[SPEAKER_09]: And two, he's the guy that wrote that, you know, profanity-laced letter about the whole gay marriage thing.

04:44.093 --> 04:46.355
[SPEAKER_09]: And like basically say, you're an idiot if you don't support it.

04:46.375 --> 04:46.956
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's cool.

04:47.116 --> 04:53.680
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so, you know, I don't use this term very often, but like, he's like a bro, you know?

04:54.461 --> 04:56.242
[SPEAKER_05]: Johnny apparently is spanking off to the show.

04:56.502 --> 04:56.743
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

04:56.763 --> 04:56.843
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

04:58.684 --> 04:59.004
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

04:59.904 --> 05:04.626
[SPEAKER_05]: Says I can multitask with the show, watch Californication, laugh at jokes, bleeping off, and listen to the show.

05:04.726 --> 05:08.587
[SPEAKER_09]: He means nodding off because he doesn't want to offend us, not sodding off.

05:08.927 --> 05:09.208
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

05:10.288 --> 05:16.290
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, that little gem from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

05:16.530 --> 05:19.752
[SPEAKER_09]: What were you saying about a city vampire earlier making you cry in chat?

05:19.792 --> 05:20.272
[SPEAKER_09]: What was that about?

05:20.292 --> 05:23.073
[SPEAKER_05]: He said the firefly was overrated, so I said his butt was overrated.

05:24.912 --> 05:29.076
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay, because Brad from PodCulture is taking care of it for me.

05:29.236 --> 05:34.360
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you also can get mature responses like such in our chat room from a host, nonetheless.

05:34.720 --> 05:38.924
[SPEAKER_09]: Live.VogNetwork.com Again, Jamie, you said your butt is overrated.

05:38.984 --> 05:39.585
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what you said?

05:39.785 --> 05:41.206
[SPEAKER_04]: But I say the same thing to my husband.

05:43.308 --> 05:47.051
[SPEAKER_05]: Except I tell him, like, he'll be like, well, this song's kind of weird.

05:47.071 --> 05:48.512
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, well, your face is kind of weird.

05:49.953 --> 05:51.355
[SPEAKER_05]: Which just earns me a look.

05:52.307 --> 05:57.149
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so pun intended, the kickoff topic I wanted to talk about tonight was sports.

05:57.770 --> 05:58.270
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

05:58.330 --> 06:01.732
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, don't sit there and be all like... No, I meant your pun.

06:02.092 --> 06:02.532
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

06:03.693 --> 06:04.533
[SPEAKER_09]: I am kind of punishing.

06:04.553 --> 06:06.694
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought you were going on your tirade about football again.

06:06.754 --> 06:07.935
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, everybody's got their thing.

06:08.315 --> 06:08.855
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

06:09.055 --> 06:10.716
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care if people like sports ball.

06:10.736 --> 06:20.841
[SPEAKER_05]: If they want the Stanley goal, you know, if they want the, I don't know, the Uber League cup, they're welcome to it.

06:21.061 --> 06:24.784
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, how often have we talked about video games ought to be a sport?

06:24.884 --> 06:26.465
[SPEAKER_09]: And that topic comes up once in a while.

06:26.525 --> 06:28.667
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how people truly feel about that.

06:28.707 --> 06:30.648
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I say, like we all say it, but maybe we don't.

06:30.949 --> 06:34.952
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, and I think about eSports and that whole thing.

06:34.992 --> 06:37.594
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's still – eSports still feels very like –

06:38.334 --> 06:43.358
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to say underground because I do see it getting more and more visibility, but let's be real.

06:43.719 --> 06:48.903
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't exactly televise StarCraft matches on NBC Primetime or whatever.

06:49.284 --> 06:57.511
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not really at that level yet, but thanks to the internet, and the internet is in many ways killing traditional broadcast mechanisms, right?

06:58.051 --> 07:05.718
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, ratings for once powerhouse TV shows like American Idol are way down, and I think we have the internet to thank for a lot of that because...

07:06.598 --> 07:09.279
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, people watch their Netflix or people watch the things that they want to see.

07:09.299 --> 07:12.601
[SPEAKER_09]: And some people prefer to watch these esports things.

07:12.621 --> 07:19.443
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've seen, you know, the online streaming solutions like Ustream, Justin TV, or excuse me, it's Twitch TV or whatever.

07:19.784 --> 07:23.365
[SPEAKER_09]: All that stuff, you know, is popular for the people who want to see it.

07:24.665 --> 07:29.848
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you log in to a site like Twitch that actually shows you, like, this is the game that's being broadcast most of all.

07:30.408 --> 07:34.209
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you guys know what game is broadcast more than any other on Twitch TV?

07:34.389 --> 07:34.950
[SPEAKER_05]: The Puppy Bowl.

07:36.130 --> 07:36.530
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish.

07:38.511 --> 07:41.533
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously though, do you know what video game is broadcast more than any other on Twitch TV?

07:42.493 --> 07:44.054
[SPEAKER_09]: StarCraft?

07:44.294 --> 07:44.554
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

07:44.955 --> 07:45.675
[SPEAKER_07]: World of Warcraft?

07:46.035 --> 07:48.376
[SPEAKER_09]: No, World of Warcraft is number two.

07:48.496 --> 07:50.878
[SPEAKER_09]: And usually when it's World of Warcraft, it's PvP.

07:50.938 --> 07:55.260
[SPEAKER_09]: At least in my experience, I see way more PvP arena people doing that than anything else.

07:55.760 --> 07:57.803
[SPEAKER_09]: League of Legends League of Legends

08:14.040 --> 08:38.810
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't get far enough I played the little tutorial and then it got into picking a character and da da da and like I literally had somewhere else to be so I kind of stopped but I am gonna try I have a long weekend as do a lot of people uh this weekend from work so I'm gonna try and play a little more tomorrow because everybody always talks about League of Legends and it is free so you know why not and I also have Dota 2 so it's like those MOBA games are becoming more and more do we have any chatters that are really into that stuff

08:39.790 --> 08:53.253
[SPEAKER_09]: Just out of curiosity, live.vognetwork.com Mako in our chatroom says, Watch today's Intel Extreme Masters Finals was damn fantastic.

08:53.773 --> 08:55.413
[SPEAKER_09]: I admit to being a sad man.

08:55.713 --> 08:56.774
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, why is that sad?

08:57.374 --> 09:02.055
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that really any different than the people that all gathered around and watched the football game?

09:02.475 --> 09:04.215
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not calling either one sad.

09:04.495 --> 09:05.855
[SPEAKER_09]: You're into whatever you're into.

09:05.875 --> 09:06.976
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm calling all of it sad.

09:07.856 --> 09:08.316
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

09:08.775 --> 09:11.197
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and then you're going to go home and watch Supernatural.

09:11.297 --> 09:13.419
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm actually way behind on Supernatural, to be honest.

09:13.439 --> 09:14.299
[SPEAKER_09]: No judgment here.

09:14.479 --> 09:14.940
[SPEAKER_09]: None at all.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.422
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you'll post about it on Tumblr.

09:19.123 --> 09:20.464
[SPEAKER_05]: I did, however, finish Sherlock.

09:22.265 --> 09:26.608
[SPEAKER_09]: Acidic Vampire in our chatroom says, Sports would be more entertaining if the athletes were naked.

09:27.629 --> 09:30.471
[SPEAKER_09]: Back in the day, the Gladiator Arena was back in the day.

09:30.651 --> 09:33.754
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think the dangly bits are hilarious, so I'd just be busy laughing.

09:33.794 --> 09:34.134
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

09:37.202 --> 09:37.663
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

09:49.901 --> 09:55.043
[SPEAKER_09]: There's only two sports I can think of where it's socially acceptable to run around in a Speedo the whole time.

09:55.504 --> 09:56.924
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them involves a swimming pool.

09:57.905 --> 09:58.945
[SPEAKER_09]: The other one is wrestling.

09:59.666 --> 10:00.186
[SPEAKER_09]: Think about it.

10:03.068 --> 10:06.469
[SPEAKER_09]: Also in our chatroom at live.vog.org You can also tell which wrestlers wear cups.

10:09.171 --> 10:13.713
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100 Matt says League of Legends and Korean StarCraft matches are broadcasted a lot.

10:13.753 --> 10:14.254
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

10:15.234 --> 10:19.935
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder what do you think it is about those types of games specifically that really draw people in?

10:20.315 --> 10:24.756
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't you see a lot of competitive music-based games?

10:25.136 --> 10:27.837
[SPEAKER_09]: I hardly ever see a lot of competitions online about that.

10:27.897 --> 10:33.738
[SPEAKER_09]: What is it about those games that you think really draws people into esports and watching all that online?

10:34.578 --> 10:39.060
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think it's because they're just designed to be that way?

10:40.440 --> 10:40.960
[SPEAKER_09]: Any thoughts?

10:41.827 --> 10:44.189
[SPEAKER_05]: I really honestly don't know what the appeal is.

10:44.950 --> 10:49.214
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, truly, I don't know what the appeal is and I can't even fathom what the appeal is.

10:49.995 --> 10:51.356
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, to be fair, you haven't played it.

10:51.576 --> 10:59.703
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless it's like, you know, fantasy football type of attraction, you know, where you can see your fantasy team play or whatever.

10:59.923 --> 11:00.324
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

11:01.705 --> 11:01.945
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki?

11:03.547 --> 11:03.867
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

11:05.789 --> 11:07.110
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know why people get into this.

11:08.030 --> 11:15.255
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, they tried to do a fantasy football league at my old job, and they asked me to been in it, and I was like, I don't know.

11:15.555 --> 11:16.215
[SPEAKER_05]: That was all I said.

11:16.816 --> 11:18.097
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what that is.

11:18.557 --> 11:22.660
[SPEAKER_07]: Watching the esports stuff is just more kind of... I mean, it's fun to watch people play sometimes.

11:22.720 --> 11:26.542
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to watch Arena on G4 and that sort of esports stuff.

11:26.582 --> 11:34.347
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't know how staged all that was, but it's basically two teams and a commentary, and that can be fun sometimes if it's a game you're interested in.

11:34.907 --> 11:36.188
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if they did it with Grand Theft Auto...

11:37.489 --> 11:40.770
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, you know, they'd have to show me because I'm so fucking awesome.

11:40.830 --> 11:46.031
[SPEAKER_07]: But, hey, I'll wait until five because no one plays it anymore.

11:47.611 --> 11:49.072
[SPEAKER_09]: What about competitive Minecraft?

11:49.372 --> 11:50.892
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I guess that's not really a thing.

11:50.952 --> 11:51.392
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be.

11:51.552 --> 11:52.332
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a thing.

11:52.452 --> 11:52.693
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it?

11:53.213 --> 11:54.013
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it can be a thing.

11:55.513 --> 12:00.014
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, competitive Minecraft they have, usually it's different game modes like the people set up.

12:00.454 --> 12:03.235
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, I've watched videos of...

12:04.576 --> 12:17.751
[SPEAKER_07]: people just creating their own kind of games like one of which okay everybody we're gonna throw you outside of this house and the first person to was it the last person to survive is the winner or something like that.

12:17.971 --> 12:18.712
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Minecraft

12:18.752 --> 12:19.292
[SPEAKER_01]: Battle Royale

12:38.924 --> 12:59.405
[SPEAKER_09]: they actually do play the Hunger Games like that where they all start off and it's basically everybody free for all and there's chests where they find stuff to help them survive for the record I'm not talking about that iPhone game that was like a platformer or shooter based on you know what I'm talking about strategize, find the weapons find your opponents, that whole type of thing

12:59.716 --> 13:13.016
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Marvel totally bit off Battle Royale specifically now because now there's like an Avengers Battle Royale comic where they've taken like little bit characters from all over the Marvel Universe and make them basically kill each other off until there's one left.

13:13.457 --> 13:15.139
[SPEAKER_05]: And the cover is totally a rip off the movie.

13:15.900 --> 13:39.397
[SPEAKER_09]: well Battle Royale kind of gained a lot of popularity again thanks to the Hunger Games I mean and you know obviously a lot of people saw the similarities and so forth um but I heard at one point the CW was kicking around a Battle Royale show it's gone it they they they are not moving forward with it that would that would definitely I would totally watch it they said hold on guys it was nothing more than like an idea we kicked around but still wouldn't

13:39.717 --> 13:44.158
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we can't put that out now that there's kids dying, you know, in the news.

13:44.378 --> 13:46.879
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would make a great TV show as a drama.

13:46.979 --> 13:55.522
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean... I'm really surprised nobody's tried to pitch a, like, a literal Hunger Games reality show.

13:56.022 --> 13:56.802
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously no death.

13:56.822 --> 13:57.422
[SPEAKER_09]: With paintball?

13:57.602 --> 14:00.823
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, like paintballs or, you know, non-lethal types of things.

14:00.924 --> 14:01.884
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, silly things.

14:01.904 --> 14:02.684
[SPEAKER_09]: Severe beatings.

14:04.024 --> 14:04.325
[SPEAKER_09]: Nerf.

14:04.665 --> 14:05.645
[SPEAKER_09]: The Nerf Hunger Games.

14:05.665 --> 14:05.765
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

14:07.133 --> 14:07.854
[SPEAKER_04]: They have laser tag jackets.

14:07.874 --> 14:08.496
[SPEAKER_04]: I would watch that.

14:08.596 --> 14:09.577
[SPEAKER_07]: The Nerfing Games.

14:10.178 --> 14:10.719
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

14:10.840 --> 14:11.661
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd even watch that.

14:11.922 --> 14:13.044
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what they need to bring back?

14:13.865 --> 14:14.446
[SPEAKER_07]: Laser tag.

14:14.686 --> 14:14.947
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes!

14:16.430 --> 14:17.531
[SPEAKER_04]: Except not the bad cartoon.

14:17.572 --> 14:18.353
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that a TV show?

14:18.553 --> 14:20.517
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there was a bad laser tag cartoon.

14:21.406 --> 14:25.769
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Adventure Time There's a big difference between that and Funhaus

14:52.164 --> 14:54.049
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiger Claw says they should do a survivor for kids.

14:54.851 --> 14:55.453
[SPEAKER_09]: They did.

14:56.235 --> 14:57.117
[SPEAKER_09]: It was called...

14:59.980 --> 15:00.501
[SPEAKER_09]: Lord of the Flies

15:24.400 --> 15:26.720
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping somebody in chat will remember the name of that show.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.661
[SPEAKER_09]: I need a reality TV nerd.

15:28.681 --> 15:30.301
[SPEAKER_09]: If Shane's listening, he might remember.

15:30.701 --> 15:31.781
[SPEAKER_09]: He'll know what show I'm talking about.

15:31.801 --> 15:34.002
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even remember what network it was on.

15:34.442 --> 15:38.563
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt says, American Gladiators was the closest we had to that type of thing.

15:38.883 --> 15:40.583
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, what happened with that reboot?

15:41.263 --> 15:47.065
[SPEAKER_09]: I was so excited because American Gladiators was such badass TV back when we were growing up.

15:47.245 --> 15:50.265
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so just brain gone.

15:50.465 --> 15:50.985
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter.

15:51.065 --> 15:51.645
[SPEAKER_07]: It was watching...

15:54.534 --> 15:59.756
[SPEAKER_07]: For the love of God, it was, can you have a game show without all the reality bullshit tied to it?

15:59.836 --> 16:00.997
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's everything nowadays.

16:01.077 --> 16:04.218
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like trying to get in the head of the contestant and like, let's find out about their life.

16:04.278 --> 16:05.319
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't fucking care about their life.

16:05.379 --> 16:06.699
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see them play a game.

16:07.019 --> 16:07.339
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.

16:07.560 --> 16:12.001
[SPEAKER_07]: All I need to know about them is their name is Bob and they're from Detroit or something like that.

16:12.041 --> 16:12.382
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

16:12.462 --> 16:13.662
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're a firefighter.

16:13.942 --> 16:14.423
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

16:14.783 --> 16:16.223
[SPEAKER_09]: And they were in the military.

16:16.243 --> 16:17.044
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that type of thing.

16:17.064 --> 16:17.724
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all we need to know.

16:18.447 --> 16:20.589
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think it just didn't work in prime time.

16:20.689 --> 16:23.131
[SPEAKER_09]: American Gladiators came back as a prime time show.

16:23.411 --> 16:27.655
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just like, no, this is the type of thing that's meant to be Saturday at 4 o'clock.

16:27.715 --> 16:28.836
[SPEAKER_05]: I've already found the best show.

16:29.057 --> 16:32.460
[SPEAKER_05]: What they need to do is take reality TV and just give it all to Canada because Canada does it right.

16:33.781 --> 16:34.561
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada does it right.

16:34.581 --> 16:36.183
[SPEAKER_05]: I am addicted to Canada's Worst Drivers.

16:38.281 --> 16:43.385
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Shane is asking, is it the CBS one that had the kids living in the town, Kid Nation?

16:43.565 --> 16:50.470
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I forgot about that one, but that one got a lot of shit because it was like really psychologically damaging to those kids.

16:50.770 --> 16:51.611
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another one.

16:52.211 --> 16:52.972
[SPEAKER_09]: It was on cable.

16:53.908 --> 16:54.689
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

17:18.112 --> 17:38.944
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Minecraft last night for four hours Wow, what the turnaround Jamie's made Remember when you used to sit here on the show and say Minecraft's stupid I didn't say it was stupid I just said I wouldn't play it until someone paid for me to And now that someone paid for me to then I'm playing it But I was busy working on my underground lair Which apparently Loki hasn't found yet

17:39.910 --> 17:41.251
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't really been playing, though.

17:41.271 --> 17:45.032
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been trying to do things that involve my brain.

17:46.273 --> 17:49.574
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's say Minecraft doesn't, but I don't really know what I want to do with it right now.

17:51.055 --> 17:57.778
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been trying to do other things, but then my brain gets too tired, so I play dumb games like Skyrim with a ton of mods on it.

17:58.158 --> 17:59.399
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really unstable now, too.

18:00.031 --> 18:05.213
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was just doing other stuff, so that's why I was playing Minecraft while I was doing other things.

18:05.313 --> 18:11.175
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just sort of nice to sit back and have something mindless to sort of work on that's a little creative.

18:12.076 --> 18:15.677
[SPEAKER_05]: And trying not to hit those guys that explode, I hate them.

18:15.937 --> 18:17.498
[SPEAKER_05]: Because most of my houses are made out of glass.

18:18.218 --> 18:19.559
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, my roofs are made out of glass.

18:20.719 --> 18:25.701
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got this whole network of underground tunnels built, and I seriously have a mole village.

18:25.801 --> 18:27.462
[SPEAKER_05]: People can come live in my mole village if they want to.

18:28.162 --> 18:29.183
[SPEAKER_05]: I finally put a bed in my house.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.144
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you play whack-a-mole in your mole village?

18:32.184 --> 18:32.324
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

18:33.644 --> 18:35.545
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did play a little WoW.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.386
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to get back into WoW.

18:38.186 --> 18:44.288
[SPEAKER_05]: I played some Mass Effect 3, but that's just because I was playing around with more of the mods and I think I'm close to getting Flycam working.

18:44.428 --> 18:48.830
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to get into the whole... The name slipped my mind.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.211
[SPEAKER_09]: When they make the movies out of video games.

18:51.231 --> 18:51.611
[SPEAKER_05]: Machinima.

18:51.751 --> 18:52.491
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Machinima.

18:52.511 --> 18:53.852
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to get into the whole Machinima thing?

18:54.032 --> 18:56.233
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but on my Mass Effecting Tumblr.

18:57.673 --> 19:00.014
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I asked, because you're mass-affecting Tumblr.

19:00.074 --> 19:01.294
[SPEAKER_09]: You're making still pictures.

19:01.334 --> 19:02.495
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of like getting your big toe in the door.

19:02.515 --> 19:03.875
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing lol effect, is what it's called.

19:04.195 --> 19:04.755
[SPEAKER_05]: Lol effect.

19:04.835 --> 19:05.495
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that like a thing?

19:05.636 --> 19:06.876
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just you, it's a bunch of other people?

19:07.096 --> 19:09.036
[SPEAKER_05]: Other people have done it, but now I'm making it a thing.

19:09.136 --> 19:10.317
[SPEAKER_09]: What if it's not very funny, though?

19:10.897 --> 19:12.938
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people think it is, so I've got 103 followers now.

19:12.958 --> 19:13.038
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

19:15.338 --> 19:17.300
[SPEAKER_09]: How come we can't get that many people listening to the show?

19:17.840 --> 19:19.762
[SPEAKER_09]: Does this show need lol effect?

19:19.822 --> 19:20.723
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs more mass effect.

19:20.763 --> 19:21.763
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell a mass effect joke.

19:22.784 --> 19:23.124
[SPEAKER_05]: Kaden.

19:25.586 --> 19:26.067
[SPEAKER_05]: Get out.

19:27.968 --> 19:32.051
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've also started doing this other thing that I call Shepard and Tumblr.

19:33.132 --> 19:37.556
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done three versions now where one of them is like Shepard looking at Tumblr on a data pad.

19:37.936 --> 19:42.119
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've exploded it now to where Shepard was looking at pictures of cats on Google.

19:42.519 --> 19:44.601
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I have another one where Shepard's looking at Grumpy Cat.

19:46.588 --> 19:47.409
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

20:16.096 --> 20:17.917
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty much Tumblr in a nutshell.

20:18.718 --> 20:19.778
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what I've been doing.

20:19.918 --> 20:21.099
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that and politics, but whatever.

20:22.019 --> 20:23.680
[SPEAKER_05]: SSU100, Matt, you disappoint me.

20:24.901 --> 20:28.603
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to finish Mass Effect 3 and do it with the extended cut.

20:30.004 --> 20:36.247
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've also been doing that and trying to get back into limbo, but I've just really been busy.

20:36.287 --> 20:38.348
[SPEAKER_05]: I start school this week and my class is all online.

20:38.488 --> 20:41.590
[SPEAKER_05]: But hey, if anyone wants me to design them a website, I can do it for school credits.

20:43.743 --> 20:47.984
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so J-Links remembered the show I was trying to think of.

20:48.244 --> 20:51.785
[SPEAKER_09]: Endurance was the name of Survivor for kids.

20:52.565 --> 20:59.586
[SPEAKER_09]: It was on NBC and then moved to Discovery Kids and it had the kids all split up into teams and it was just, you know, they did all these challenges.

20:59.606 --> 21:01.487
[SPEAKER_07]: Who could survive the longest before their bedtime?

21:02.947 --> 21:03.627
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

21:04.407 --> 21:07.348
[SPEAKER_09]: I just had to put that to rest, that discussion from earlier.

21:08.683 --> 21:09.824
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

21:29.304 --> 21:32.085
[SPEAKER_07]: It was okay.

21:32.185 --> 21:36.127
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a huge fan of the MOGA controller, like the first one they put out.

21:36.687 --> 21:40.988
[SPEAKER_07]: Their new one that they showed at CES, the one that's full size, I think it'll be a little bit better.

21:41.909 --> 21:45.470
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, once again, it's kind of like the Vita controls.

21:45.710 --> 21:53.093
[SPEAKER_07]: Vita, it's cool that they have dual analog sticks and stuff, but it's just not the same as a console controller.

21:53.133 --> 21:55.414
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little bit cramped, I guess.

21:55.774 --> 21:57.596
[SPEAKER_07]: But it worked alright, and it was kind of fun.

21:58.336 --> 21:59.777
[SPEAKER_07]: Until my wife said, what the hell are you doing?

21:59.797 --> 22:03.761
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we went over to her parents' house, and she's like, well, you should bring something to do.

22:04.361 --> 22:04.862
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, okay.

22:05.042 --> 22:08.324
[SPEAKER_07]: So I brought something to do, and of course she did not, even though she asked me to.

22:10.226 --> 22:14.029
[SPEAKER_07]: So I brought that, and she's like, is that a controller for your phone?

22:14.870 --> 22:16.972
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you addicted to games or something?

22:16.992 --> 22:21.395
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like, you have that so that it's easier to play games on your phone?

22:21.856 --> 22:24.438
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, yeah, because I got it for free.

22:27.798 --> 22:29.880
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, it is easier to play games like that on my phone.

22:31.762 --> 22:32.182
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not bad.

22:32.422 --> 22:33.403
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty cool.

22:34.084 --> 22:40.389
[SPEAKER_07]: If I want to play a game like that, it's a hell of a lot better than virtual sticks and stuff on the actual screen.

22:41.390 --> 22:42.091
[SPEAKER_07]: It worked out pretty cool.

22:45.033 --> 22:45.514
[SPEAKER_07]: What else did I play?

22:46.471 --> 22:50.355
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, more Skyrim on Steam with all my mods in there.

22:50.456 --> 22:59.526
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, I'm going to start having to scale back on some of those mods because I'm running into crashing problems where it'll just dump me for no apparent reason.

22:59.546 --> 23:06.474
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I can't build a forge at my house in Hearthfire because...

23:08.470 --> 23:10.512
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it just will crash for no reason.

23:10.632 --> 23:13.334
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not really sure why, but it's only when I build a forge.

23:14.135 --> 23:16.997
[SPEAKER_07]: And just some other weird stuff.

23:17.017 --> 23:21.901
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there's one I have, it's called Midas Magic, which adds a bunch of different magic spells that they created for the game.

23:22.562 --> 23:31.249
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is they have this thing that you put items in to craft these spells in the Riverwood Trader.

23:31.929 --> 23:36.913
[SPEAKER_07]: And when it creates a spell, the spell book is marked as steel.

23:37.814 --> 23:54.365
[SPEAKER_07]: and so you can't get the book without like pissing everybody off and so like the first spell I got I'm like okay I'm going to turn invisible I'm gonna sneak and be invisible and I'm gonna grab the spell really quick use the spell and then maybe they won't notice anything

23:54.785 --> 23:56.646
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope, they all tried to murder me instead.

23:57.006 --> 24:00.147
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, I mean, it's just a minor inconvenience because none of them can actually kill me.

24:00.187 --> 24:04.269
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just don't want to have to kill them because that would be terrible.

24:04.489 --> 24:07.991
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, all these quests I'll miss because I'd have to go kill all of them.

24:10.251 --> 24:15.314
[SPEAKER_07]: Then other games I played, I played one of the other games I backed on Kickstarter.

24:15.774 --> 24:18.735
[SPEAKER_07]: The, was it the Gianna Sisters?

24:19.355 --> 24:20.836
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, how is that?

24:21.176 --> 24:23.517
[SPEAKER_09]: I have that from the Steam sale still waiting to be played.

24:24.292 --> 24:24.892
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

24:40.240 --> 24:43.744
[SPEAKER_07]: and then a new game I played on consoles this week, Forza Horizon.

24:44.465 --> 24:45.906
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually got into that a bit.

24:46.527 --> 24:49.710
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the cult of Forza Horizon.

24:49.770 --> 24:50.591
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

24:50.671 --> 24:53.334
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I played that a bit and it's fun.

24:54.455 --> 25:00.562
[SPEAKER_07]: First order of business is I drove on all the roads so I can get that achievement and I hit all the signs so now I get free upgrades.

25:01.102 --> 25:02.904
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you look online to see where all the signs were?

25:03.864 --> 25:07.067
[SPEAKER_07]: I was driving all the roads.

25:07.087 --> 25:07.907
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't even done that yet.

25:07.927 --> 25:09.969
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a couple that I couldn't find right away.

25:10.089 --> 25:14.612
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I was like, okay, looking at the map and kind of, okay, there's probably something right here.

25:14.652 --> 25:16.674
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's pretty obvious where they're hiding some of them.

25:17.154 --> 25:19.396
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you think of the whole introduction and the setup though?

25:19.416 --> 25:23.559
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you have the same reaction I did where it's like, these rich, spoiled brats?

25:24.981 --> 25:25.681
[SPEAKER_07]: That was my reaction.

25:25.701 --> 25:28.382
[SPEAKER_07]: Not even that, but there are some things that are annoying me about it.

25:28.442 --> 25:36.746
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, I'll still get radio chatter where it's like, hey, did you see that such and such person has those signs out there?

25:36.786 --> 25:41.327
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you hit them, you'll get this guy like, I fucking know because I hit all of them already, you stupid bitch.

25:41.828 --> 25:43.948
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need you telling me this over and over again.

25:44.208 --> 25:47.130
[SPEAKER_09]: Or like, you know... I think it's just randomized, Loki.

25:47.350 --> 25:50.451
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I understand, but they should shut that off if you've hit all the signs.

25:50.631 --> 25:53.212
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if, you know, you hit a couple of signs, you should...

25:53.786 --> 25:54.466
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

26:18.155 --> 26:19.857
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, and then the radio net is hilarious.

26:19.917 --> 26:23.820
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, he's all, dude, they have an event where you race a hot air balloon.

26:24.321 --> 26:29.885
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, but if I heard of, like, this event I could go to to watch a car race a hot air balloon, that would be fucking boring.

26:30.226 --> 26:32.027
[SPEAKER_07]: Because hot air balloons are not fast.

26:32.087 --> 26:32.868
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fun race.

26:33.128 --> 26:33.869
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you done the race yet?

26:34.129 --> 26:38.553
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I did the race, but hot air balloons are not known for their speed, okay?

26:38.793 --> 26:39.874
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a hot air balloon.

26:39.894 --> 26:42.056
[SPEAKER_09]: Despite your snark, how do you really feel about the game?

26:42.076 --> 26:42.557
[SPEAKER_07]: It's alright.

26:42.757 --> 26:43.558
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an okay game.

26:43.598 --> 26:46.561
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like kind of Burnout Paradise Lite, I guess.

26:47.463 --> 26:48.344
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much it.

26:49.185 --> 26:50.146
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to play some online.

26:50.767 --> 26:51.107
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fun.

26:52.108 --> 26:52.649
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure it is.

26:52.689 --> 26:55.272
[SPEAKER_09]: One of these nights, we're going to fill up a race with all VOG people.

26:55.312 --> 26:56.173
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be interesting.

26:57.014 --> 26:58.316
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll probably still get last place.

26:58.516 --> 27:10.239
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I had to go into multiplayer to do some of the speed trap things because fucking caravan, like always being from goddamn minivan, just like there.

27:10.539 --> 27:14.460
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm flying over the hill like 160 miles an hour.

27:14.780 --> 27:16.200
[SPEAKER_07]: Goddamn minivan right there.

27:16.520 --> 27:17.401
[SPEAKER_07]: Like every time.

27:17.981 --> 27:22.262
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just like some stupid like Volkswagen Beetle or something.

27:22.282 --> 27:22.722
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like...

27:23.522 --> 27:48.472
[SPEAKER_07]: boom wait you you go into the world roam mode with other people you don't do by myself racing oh well no i have been doing racing i haven't really been racing too much of the events because i did i did a lot of the challenges and i got you know money from that and i bought some cars and then i i said hey i'm gonna go beat everybody's scores on these things and so i did that uh for a lot of it and kept racing back and forth uh lamborghini

27:48.692 --> 27:52.573
[SPEAKER_09]: Acidic Vampire in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Racing a hot air balloon?

27:52.674 --> 27:53.094
[SPEAKER_09]: The hell?

27:53.414 --> 27:53.834
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

27:54.354 --> 27:55.254
[SPEAKER_09]: You race airplanes, too.

27:55.475 --> 27:58.936
[SPEAKER_07]: Airplanes and apparently a helicopter, according to the radio, but I haven't done that yet.

27:59.416 --> 28:00.256
[SPEAKER_07]: Airplanes thing, man.

28:01.177 --> 28:04.138
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of that stuff pisses me off because those cars handle like crap.

28:05.458 --> 28:06.959
[SPEAKER_07]: Or like, I don't know.

28:07.879 --> 28:10.780
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, let's race this Lamborghini on a dirt track.

28:10.840 --> 28:12.141
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that doesn't make any sense.

28:12.461 --> 28:12.541
[SPEAKER_07]: Or...

28:14.821 --> 28:22.668
[SPEAKER_07]: or some of the ones where they're like, I want you to show off for the people and you have to do these cool, you know, you have to get like 28,000 points by driving down the street.

28:22.728 --> 28:24.630
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, how the fuck do I do that?

28:24.930 --> 28:26.692
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you played a lot with the customization mode?

28:26.932 --> 28:31.356
[SPEAKER_09]: Brad from PodCulture in our chat room reminding us the creation mode in Forza is fantastic.

28:31.416 --> 28:32.116
[SPEAKER_09]: It is very good.

28:32.137 --> 28:35.159
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you've played around a lot with the like, you know, decal making and all that.

28:35.239 --> 28:36.200
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I have.

28:36.300 --> 28:38.182
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, you made like an Orange Nose Radio card, didn't you?

28:38.422 --> 28:39.063
[SPEAKER_07]: N7 cars all over the place.

28:39.083 --> 28:39.383
[SPEAKER_07]: That's easy.

29:03.644 --> 29:05.585
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone made a tally card, but it wasn't very good.

29:05.945 --> 29:14.588
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of just writing out Orange Lounge Radio, I actually pulled out my old business card, which is completely useless now since the phone number and websites are all incorrect.

29:14.868 --> 29:20.010
[SPEAKER_07]: But I actually recreated the logo that was on there using just boxes.

29:20.509 --> 29:20.869
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

29:21.650 --> 29:22.751
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anything else for your gaming week?

29:26.715 --> 29:28.757
[SPEAKER_07]: Call of Duty, I'm sure I played a little bit of that in Borderlands.

29:28.797 --> 29:36.325
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we restarted Borderlands on true Vault Hunter mode, and we're kind of back up to where we were before when we first started playing co-op, but

29:37.199 --> 29:44.225
[SPEAKER_07]: I was kind of pissed off at that because I tried, you know, we were trying to go back into the game and do all the side missions in the original difficulty.

29:44.805 --> 29:47.468
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, hey, you've unlocked this true Vault Hunter mode.

29:47.488 --> 29:48.328
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to do that now?

29:48.348 --> 29:49.289
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, yeah, sure, whatever.

29:49.349 --> 29:52.632
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's bump up the difficulty and, you know, we can go back there.

29:52.652 --> 29:56.275
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, well, if you decide you can change it later on in these settings or whatever.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.176
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, okay.

29:58.517 --> 30:00.098
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't find the settings anywhere for that.

30:00.338 --> 30:02.440
[SPEAKER_07]: And now that I'm in true Vault Hunter mode, my game restarted.

30:03.809 --> 30:09.452
[SPEAKER_07]: Except I have all my weapons and I'm still level 50, but it's still annoying.

30:09.512 --> 30:12.053
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, god damn, I was going to do all these side missions.

30:12.193 --> 30:13.914
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I just have to do them in this.

30:15.175 --> 30:15.755
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I guess.

30:16.035 --> 30:17.036
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be a little bit harder.

30:18.390 --> 30:20.312
[SPEAKER_07]: So I haven't downloaded any of the DLC and I probably won't.

30:21.152 --> 30:25.936
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, you know, because my friend's playing with me and I don't want to buy two copies of those.

30:27.337 --> 30:27.878
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, is that it?

30:28.378 --> 30:28.658
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

30:29.399 --> 30:30.039
[SPEAKER_09]: My Gaming Week.

30:30.940 --> 30:32.041
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a whole lot of new stuff.

30:32.081 --> 30:33.302
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, revisiting old stuff.

30:33.602 --> 30:35.544
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as new stuff goes, there's some iOS games.

30:36.384 --> 30:37.705
[SPEAKER_09]: Final Fantasy All the Bravest.

30:37.986 --> 30:39.887
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of you guys have been reading about this on the internet.

30:39.907 --> 30:40.788
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of controversial.

30:41.248 --> 30:46.893
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to spoil my thoughts too much because I actually wrote them down for a VOG article that I'm going to post tomorrow after all the podcasts go up.

30:47.614 --> 30:48.435
[SPEAKER_09]: with some other articles.

30:48.455 --> 30:49.756
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some content going up next week.

30:49.777 --> 30:50.618
[SPEAKER_01]: Promises, promises.

30:51.018 --> 30:51.379
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know.

30:52.260 --> 30:54.463
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, Final Fantasy All the Bravest.

30:56.405 --> 30:57.006
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

30:57.126 --> 30:58.888
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I'm going to say for now.

30:59.389 --> 30:59.870
[SPEAKER_09]: Stay tuned.

31:00.450 --> 31:02.193
[SPEAKER_09]: But I will talk a little more in depth about Temple Run 2.

31:03.414 --> 31:06.695
[SPEAKER_09]: sequel to Temple Run, which has inspired a lot of knockoffs and so forth.

31:07.075 --> 31:11.196
[SPEAKER_09]: Temple Run 2 looks gorgeous on my iPad 3 Retina, I gotta say, for a free game.

31:12.236 --> 31:14.897
[SPEAKER_09]: Temple Run's a really great time killer.

31:15.437 --> 31:20.478
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's funny because this game gets compared to Pitfall and back and forth when the two games are kind of ripping each other off.

31:20.818 --> 31:29.040
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say Pitfall, and I'm talking about the iOS remake of Pitfall, or reimagining of Pitfall, let's be real, not the classic, classic Atari game.

31:29.620 --> 31:30.341
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

31:53.337 --> 31:56.480
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, as far as PC and consoles go, not a lot of new stuff.

31:56.660 --> 32:03.205
[SPEAKER_09]: I have Assassin's Creed 3 from the rental company ready to play, but I didn't get around to it this weekend, so I'm going to check that out during the week this week.

32:04.846 --> 32:08.389
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did play World of Warcraft, of course.

32:09.290 --> 32:12.373
[SPEAKER_09]: Had an epic Civilization V match again on Saturday night.

32:12.893 --> 32:15.315
[SPEAKER_09]: This time it was myself and...

32:16.856 --> 32:18.297
[SPEAKER_09]: Four other people were playing.

32:18.317 --> 32:23.118
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was five of us playing Civ V. And we started, I think, around 8 o'clock.

32:23.338 --> 32:26.479
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to bed at 3.30, and we weren't even close to being done.

32:27.039 --> 32:27.659
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.

32:27.980 --> 32:29.820
[SPEAKER_09]: No VOG people, unfortunately, this time.

32:29.860 --> 32:32.481
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we've been talking about, like, Bobby and I have been trying to play for a while.

32:32.901 --> 32:33.662
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

32:55.504 --> 33:20.986
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever have fun all right um other games i've played this week um i went back kicking it old school on my 3ds playing a ds game i've been playing pokemon pearl because ever since that x and y trailer came out i'm like that looks really good like finally they've got the pokemon games looking like the cartoon series like it took them long enough

33:21.446 --> 33:45.059
[SPEAKER_09]: so I've kind of decided to go back and look at the older games in an effort to collect Pokemon to transfer to X and Y at some point so you know why not so I've got very far but I have about three four hours logged on Pokemon Pearl no particular reason I picked that one that just happens to be the one that I had in my collection from like years ago so and I never really got very far in it so I'm rediscovering it all over again there you go

33:47.300 --> 33:53.665
[SPEAKER_09]: so yeah, WoW Civ, Pokemon I guess that's really about it nothing else to share for now

33:54.423 --> 34:23.493
[SPEAKER_09]: some random XBLA games here and there nothing worth talking in depth about so let's move on into housekeeping tonight you can of course always visit us on Twitter twitter.com slash OLR and you can also visit us on Facebook facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and again I would encourage you as well to check out the Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com and support some of the other shows that are on the network we got a lot of great shows throughout the week that play on the network and encourage you to check that out

34:24.153 --> 34:25.134
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

34:42.389 --> 34:45.993
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

35:00.510 --> 35:09.220
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called PressPaws.org, but it's Press P-A-W-S, like doggy paws and kitty paws.

35:10.481 --> 35:18.450
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought this was great, because obviously, Orange Lounge Radio, we've had a lot of loved pets pass away this past year, unfortunately.

35:18.470 --> 35:19.351
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very tragic.

35:19.731 --> 35:21.472
[SPEAKER_09]: So what better time to bring up something like this?

35:21.813 --> 35:25.875
[SPEAKER_09]: The website PressPaws.org, Saving Animals with Art and Video Games.

35:25.895 --> 35:32.400
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're actually doing this whole little gallery, February 9th, at Gallery Nucleus, which I believe is in the Chicago area?

35:32.720 --> 35:35.141
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not really here.

35:35.382 --> 35:36.963
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, now I'm curious where this is at.

35:37.783 --> 35:42.226
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the Twitter person was in the Chicago area, so I didn't see this.

35:42.266 --> 35:43.047
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me see real quick.

35:44.915 --> 35:46.636
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry guys, I literally just brought it up.

35:46.696 --> 35:47.756
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no, this is in the LA area.

35:47.796 --> 35:48.136
[SPEAKER_09]: My bad.

35:48.476 --> 35:49.717
[SPEAKER_09]: This is in Alhambra.

35:51.198 --> 35:51.918
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's really cool.

35:51.958 --> 35:53.158
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in the LA area.

35:54.119 --> 36:00.221
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I think they hit their goal already of $3,000 to raise the money and everything.

36:00.261 --> 36:01.922
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, check out the website.

36:03.002 --> 36:03.423
[SPEAKER_09]: It's cute.

36:04.143 --> 36:07.504
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at all the doggies with the question mark blocks and the goombas and wearing the Luigi hats.

36:07.524 --> 36:08.505
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to be more kitties.

36:10.385 --> 36:11.085
[SPEAKER_09]: There's another doggy.

36:11.105 --> 36:13.306
[SPEAKER_09]: There really aren't a lot of kitties here, are there?

36:13.766 --> 36:14.166
[SPEAKER_09]: There's one.

36:14.186 --> 36:15.366
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a kitty.

36:16.887 --> 36:17.167
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

36:17.747 --> 36:19.767
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely don't know your target audience on the internet.

36:22.168 --> 36:24.028
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I thought it was cute and worth a shout out, so there you go.

36:24.048 --> 36:24.668
[SPEAKER_05]: It is cute.

36:24.788 --> 36:25.188
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

36:25.308 --> 36:27.009
[SPEAKER_05]: And Tiger Claw reposted it in the chat room.

36:27.349 --> 36:27.809
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

36:29.189 --> 36:32.650
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to mention something, too, real quick about my gaming week that I forgot to mention.

36:33.290 --> 36:34.090
[SPEAKER_07]: Forza Horizon.

36:34.470 --> 36:38.151
[SPEAKER_07]: Love, love, love that Horizon Base Arena station on there.

36:38.965 --> 36:40.850
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, yeah, they've got some good music in the game.

36:40.870 --> 36:47.364
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, a lot of them, you know, a lot of them actually songs I listen to already in the car, but make a new CD for my car.

36:47.785 --> 36:47.926
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

36:49.281 --> 36:54.044
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, I have to say, what the fuck is Blue Monday by New Order doing on that goddamn station?

36:54.124 --> 36:55.264
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes no fucking sense.

36:55.385 --> 36:56.145
[SPEAKER_07]: Why the fuck not?

36:56.565 --> 37:00.487
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's not a base song.

37:00.507 --> 37:01.588
[SPEAKER_07]: New Order belongs everywhere.

37:01.628 --> 37:08.352
[SPEAKER_07]: If it was the New Order remix that was in Blade or something, yes, that would totally fit with that station.

37:08.432 --> 37:12.594
[SPEAKER_07]: But New Order, that would be perfect on the Rock station or something like that.

37:12.614 --> 37:13.795
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe your base just isn't high enough.

37:14.495 --> 37:16.597
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have a lot of bass in it.

37:16.737 --> 37:18.518
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Blue Monday.

37:18.538 --> 37:19.259
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, come on.

37:22.081 --> 37:25.883
[SPEAKER_09]: At least it's not that horrible remake that was done a couple... It was probably about 10 years ago.

37:26.544 --> 37:29.085
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and those guys were assholes and said, well, our version's better.

37:30.386 --> 37:30.787
[SPEAKER_09]: In hell.

37:31.947 --> 37:33.268
[SPEAKER_05]: In nowhere.

37:34.629 --> 37:36.070
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on.

37:36.190 --> 37:41.494
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get into gaming news and talk about what's been going on in the video game world this week with you guys commenting and participating live.

37:41.674 --> 37:42.655
[SPEAKER_09]: Live.vognetwork.com

37:43.055 --> 37:47.497
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are listening to the podcast, you can always email us, mailbag at orangeandreda.com or tweet us or what have you.

37:47.857 --> 37:48.577
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get into the news.

37:48.657 --> 37:48.917
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

37:49.317 --> 37:49.698
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

37:50.038 --> 37:52.919
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's talk a little bit about Nintendo.

37:53.079 --> 37:58.901
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's kind of interesting that they decided to go ahead and merge their handheld and console divisions.

37:59.261 --> 38:25.215
[SPEAKER_07]: which I hope that this means that we're going to see a lot more kind of stuff that we used to have with even like the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance and stuff like that where you see a lot of synergy between the console versions and the portables like you know tying into each other like hey you can unlock crap from the console version if you plug in your system or whatever maybe we see something like that with the 3DS and you know the Wii U or something like that some sort of cross connectivity with some games or something

38:25.575 --> 38:26.376
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be pretty awesome.

38:27.136 --> 38:31.198
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, you know, better console games, I guess, on handhelds.

38:31.338 --> 38:35.481
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, I don't know, maybe because the Wii U is almost like a 3DS anyway.

38:35.501 --> 38:36.701
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just tied to a TV.

38:36.721 --> 38:43.165
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was going to say, I thought this was going to go more along your joke about how the Wii U is just basically a DS without hinges.

38:43.325 --> 38:44.005
[SPEAKER_09]: It pretty much is.

38:45.786 --> 38:46.927
[SPEAKER_07]: Although we should add hinges.

38:46.987 --> 38:48.668
[SPEAKER_07]: We should just, like, hinge it to the TV.

38:49.388 --> 38:50.649
[SPEAKER_07]: Clamp the gamepad to the TV.

38:50.669 --> 38:51.510
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go, done.

38:51.530 --> 38:52.090
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

38:54.648 --> 39:01.977
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, actually, if you, well, I was going to see if there was a way to get like an external monitor or something like that.

39:02.018 --> 39:07.144
[SPEAKER_07]: They should make that an external monitor that clips to your gamepad that makes it like a 3DS.

39:07.204 --> 39:10.929
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, okay, I got the screen up here and yeah, I'm kind of fine.

39:11.365 --> 39:14.848
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let me read this next story because the two kind of go hand in hand, maybe.

39:14.888 --> 39:17.511
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to talk about if the two go hand in hand or what it can mean.

39:17.951 --> 39:21.134
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a report going around about the Wii U game sales.

39:21.754 --> 39:25.718
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, the game sales are actually lagging behind the Wii and the GameCube.

39:26.018 --> 39:27.079
[SPEAKER_09]: Please note the keyword there.

39:27.119 --> 39:28.801
[SPEAKER_09]: It is the game sales.

39:29.881 --> 39:36.045
[SPEAKER_09]: Analyst Doug Kreutz of Cohen & Company is interpreting the software sales.

39:36.585 --> 39:45.071
[SPEAKER_09]: Totals for the November to December period were 43% lower than software sales for the Wii and 50% lower than those for the GameCube.

39:45.851 --> 39:46.091
[SPEAKER_09]: Ouch.

39:47.532 --> 39:48.072
[SPEAKER_09]: But then again...

39:49.173 --> 40:14.121
[SPEAKER_09]: you know the Wii U I don't I mean even though a lot of people are like Wii U's got the biggest launch lineup ever and it's got all these games I mean the reality is a lot of those games were already played by people a long time ago and I don't think they were as exciting and especially alongside the Wii lineup the original Wii you know you had a lot of a lot more like everybody had to have Zelda and I think on the Wii U you get a lot of people that have to have Mario but I think people don't feel like they need

40:14.281 --> 40:14.642
[SPEAKER_09]: and much more.

40:34.461 --> 40:38.782
[SPEAKER_07]: Slightly earlier or at the same time, I mean, it's not a lot of really exclusive new stuff.

40:39.482 --> 40:44.624
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the big new exclusive games, Nintendo Land, was included with the console that most people bought anyways.

40:44.664 --> 40:47.964
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but Wii Sports was included with the Wii, which was an even bigger deal.

40:49.125 --> 40:55.586
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's true, it was, but this is also being sold alongside of it as well.

40:55.626 --> 40:57.046
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's got to hurt the sales.

40:57.087 --> 41:01.788
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, every Wii came with Wii Sports, so there was no double skew.

41:01.808 --> 41:03.048
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, in the beginning anyway.

41:03.348 --> 41:03.948
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

41:24.356 --> 41:27.357
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that's as big of a factor as people are making it out to be.

41:28.257 --> 41:32.319
[SPEAKER_09]: I personally have a real hard time plunking down $50 for a game with nothing tangible.

41:32.759 --> 41:36.560
[SPEAKER_09]: It's different when it's like $10, $15, $20 is about as high as I go.

41:36.720 --> 41:40.141
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect example, Earth Defense Force 2017 Portable, Sigil only.

41:40.221 --> 41:44.502
[SPEAKER_07]: I was kind of staring at the screen because I booted up my Vita this week and I was like, you know...

41:50.644 --> 41:52.166
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking and I'm like, do I really want to spend?

41:52.266 --> 41:54.008
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not buying this for $40.

41:54.089 --> 41:56.652
[SPEAKER_07]: That is too fucking expensive for a digital download.

41:57.112 --> 41:57.393
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

41:57.913 --> 41:58.814
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot.

41:58.874 --> 42:03.180
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally forgot to talk about Wake Up Club, but I'll get to that in part B. But see, I spent more than a cost.

42:03.500 --> 42:04.521
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Dan did anyway.

42:04.581 --> 42:06.464
[SPEAKER_05]: More than the cost of a Wii on my graphics card.

42:07.925 --> 42:14.149
[SPEAKER_05]: and I can get games that play better, look better, and I can mod to hell and back.

42:14.349 --> 42:19.052
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you're going to be one of those people that are like PC gaming above all else.

42:19.172 --> 42:23.895
[SPEAKER_05]: To be honest, I think PC gaming these days is really beating out the consoles.

42:24.576 --> 42:30.099
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that now people are starting to realize that you're getting a bit more of your money's worth out of PC gaming.

42:31.020 --> 42:31.280
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

42:31.880 --> 42:58.455
[SPEAKER_09]: except it's not yes and no some games just don't run as smooth as they do on consoles because a lot of games are optimized for the consoles you know because again PCs all have that varying equipment which can make a difference but you know consoles everybody's got the same thing so a lot of times you know what works on the console doesn't necessarily work on PC I'm not I mean look at my gaming week I play World of Warcraft and Civ 5 I'm not knocking PC gaming by any means but I think there's room at the table for both

42:58.780 --> 43:12.428
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think at this point given the limitations with the Wii U software base and honestly that you're not getting anything really new out of it except for that little controller that my money was better spent on my graphics card.

43:13.659 --> 43:21.245
[SPEAKER_09]: Ross Steel UT in chat says, considering how low the Wii U storage is, I doubt that, talking about the downloads, 32 gigs isn't a lot of space.

43:21.285 --> 43:22.306
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's an issue too.

43:22.786 --> 43:25.068
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, granted, you can add your own drive to the system.

43:25.228 --> 43:26.829
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they were touting that.

43:27.210 --> 43:29.972
[SPEAKER_09]: It's too early to really see the impact of that, I think.

43:30.652 --> 43:38.959
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, maybe when there's more desirable stuff, you know, we talked about how the Wii U eShop is very indie friendly, and we anticipate there's going to be a lot of good stuff that comes in throughout the year.

43:39.820 --> 43:43.243
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's still too early to gauge if a lot of people are actually doing that or not.

43:44.765 --> 43:50.189
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, RossDLUT in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com actually follows up with another good comment I wanted to read here.

43:51.130 --> 44:14.930
[SPEAKER_09]: Rostio UT actually left PC gaming because of the DRM and I got to admit a lot of the PC games are shooting themselves in the foot when it comes to DRM not that consoles necessarily do a lot better but like you know the SimCity shit like EA's upcoming SimCity game I'm sorry I am totally turned off to that game and it's because of the DRM Diablo 3 pissed a lot of people off

44:15.830 --> 44:18.092
[SPEAKER_09]: I think people are finally starting to say, you know what?

44:18.372 --> 44:22.094
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we've hit our limit with how tied we have to be to the internet.

44:22.715 --> 44:26.377
[SPEAKER_09]: How much information we have to transmit from our computer on a regular basis just to play a stupid game.

44:26.397 --> 44:28.038
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's to play with everybody else.

44:28.118 --> 44:30.160
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's totally not because of the DRM.

44:30.260 --> 44:32.061
[SPEAKER_07]: It's to play with everybody else, right?

44:32.681 --> 44:36.483
[SPEAKER_09]: But people wanted to cheat in SimCity Who didn't cheat in SimCity?

44:36.683 --> 44:42.025
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody cheats in SimCity So why would you design your game to be online all the time so you can't cheat?

44:42.646 --> 44:43.166
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

44:43.786 --> 45:01.274
[SPEAKER_05]: However, Mass Effect 3 Just for example, they wanted it online and they update the game whenever they want to Still hackable, still cheatable Well, thankfully the single player multiplayer But they will nail your ass if you cheat in the multiplayer But I'm also not an asshole and won't cheat in multiplayer So, just saying

45:02.881 --> 45:05.363
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe other people are assholes and like to cheat in multiplayer.

45:05.923 --> 45:10.287
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma in our chatroom says there are ways around DRM and for SimCity I will do just that.

45:10.487 --> 45:14.069
[SPEAKER_09]: That is exactly what's going to happen and I can't believe EA doesn't realize it.

45:15.951 --> 45:19.193
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody in a boardroom needs to get over their ego because just wait.

45:19.493 --> 45:24.657
[SPEAKER_09]: Before the game comes out somebody will have hacked that DRM and will have an offline, playable, downloadable SimCity.

45:25.078 --> 45:25.318
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait.

45:26.318 --> 45:27.760
[SPEAKER_09]: That is exactly what will happen.

45:27.980 --> 45:30.442
[SPEAKER_05]: There's already hacks for just about any game out there.

45:30.482 --> 45:32.143
[SPEAKER_05]: There's ways to play it without the disc.

45:32.483 --> 45:39.751
[SPEAKER_05]: which I'm actually starting to do with Mass Effect 2 so that I can run text mod I mean just saying because mine is a Amazon download

45:41.239 --> 46:02.934
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't said the G word alright so anyway the point I wanted to get to was going back a story you were talking about the console division getting merged with the hardware division could the Wii U's I don't want to say underwhelming performance but non-overwhelming performance be contributing to this probably

46:03.815 --> 46:17.266
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd imagine it would be because they need to kind of figure out how they're going to recapture the magic in the kind of serious rush for product that the Wii had, I guess.

46:17.466 --> 46:19.388
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really remember too much about the Wii launch.

46:19.428 --> 46:21.410
[SPEAKER_07]: I just know that the consoles were really hard to get.

46:21.970 --> 46:23.312
[SPEAKER_07]: I can tell you right now they're not hard to get.

46:23.572 --> 46:29.137
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, we're getting our consoles this early already and not like a year later like with the Wii.

46:29.837 --> 46:31.558
[SPEAKER_07]: That's because they're sitting on shelves.

46:31.838 --> 46:33.059
[SPEAKER_07]: They are sitting on shelves.

46:33.119 --> 46:33.819
[SPEAKER_01]: Stacks of them?

46:34.199 --> 46:34.439
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

46:34.779 --> 46:37.620
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not flying off the shelves, and that's got to have them worried.

46:38.541 --> 46:42.943
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they don't want to have another 3DS debacle.

46:43.763 --> 46:45.744
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but the 3DS is in a much better place now.

46:46.525 --> 46:48.407
[SPEAKER_07]: It is now, but what does that take?

46:48.447 --> 46:50.548
[SPEAKER_07]: They have to drop the price and put out a lot more games.

46:51.149 --> 46:59.535
[SPEAKER_07]: If they have to drop the price of the Wii U within the first year, that's going to look like double failure on their part.

47:00.036 --> 47:06.521
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know anybody that doesn't think the problem with the Wii U right now is the lack of exclusive games, basically.

47:06.901 --> 47:09.002
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, yes, there's an awesome Mario game.

47:09.142 --> 47:10.743
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Nintendo Land's pretty good.

47:11.163 --> 47:14.745
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, but there's not enough of that.

47:14.805 --> 47:17.787
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the 3DS had the exact same problem in the beginning.

47:17.987 --> 47:19.228
[SPEAKER_09]: Exact same problem with the 3DS.

47:19.628 --> 47:22.429
[SPEAKER_09]: You had a decent launch lineup, but nothing sustained it.

47:22.990 --> 47:27.552
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and now we're getting in this position with the Wii U again, which I know you'll get into in a minute when we talk about the releases.

47:27.612 --> 47:33.415
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, it's going to be until next Christmas when we start getting the stuff people really want to get.

47:34.235 --> 47:34.916
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the reality.

47:35.716 --> 47:41.881
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we don't even know what they have planned beyond... Well, I guess, I mean... They'll announce it all at E3.

47:41.921 --> 47:45.043
[SPEAKER_07]: Second quarter is going to be pretty much stuff that's held over from first quarter.

47:45.063 --> 47:47.064
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo doesn't announce holiday ahead at E3.

47:47.745 --> 47:48.585
[SPEAKER_09]: They never really have.

47:48.805 --> 47:49.566
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, think about it.

47:49.646 --> 47:52.768
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of the big heavy hitters are always announced at E3.

47:53.649 --> 47:55.490
[SPEAKER_09]: Other companies don't tend to do that as much.

47:55.530 --> 47:59.773
[SPEAKER_09]: You might find out about stuff a little earlier, but Nintendo really kind of keeps it until E3.

48:02.358 --> 48:04.699
[SPEAKER_09]: especially with the new Xbox coming out this holiday.

48:04.719 --> 48:05.720
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to have to do something.

48:05.880 --> 48:08.701
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to have to really do something.

48:09.602 --> 48:13.263
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe the console's being merged so that the console people can work on a Wii U game.

48:13.283 --> 48:13.683
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

48:14.104 --> 48:14.944
[SPEAKER_07]: Push this button.

48:16.145 --> 48:18.246
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, hey, there's a 3DS hidden inside there.

48:19.086 --> 48:19.987
[SPEAKER_09]: Bet you didn't know about that.

48:22.728 --> 48:27.569
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe, maybe your whole little theory about the 3DS will soon become another Wii U gamepad.

48:27.609 --> 48:28.729
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe that will come to light.

48:28.769 --> 48:29.149
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

48:29.889 --> 48:39.771
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I don't think the technology is capable in those 3DSs, but maybe there will be a 3DS XL XL that will do it.

48:39.791 --> 48:41.252
[SPEAKER_09]: 40 or whatever, yeah.

48:41.452 --> 48:42.252
[SPEAKER_09]: That will do it.

48:42.472 --> 48:42.892
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

48:44.332 --> 48:45.352
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an interesting question.

48:45.372 --> 48:48.873
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think the merging of the divisions means something for the next handheld?

48:50.998 --> 48:51.979
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess anything's possible.

48:53.141 --> 48:54.583
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on with more gaming news.

48:54.623 --> 48:55.204
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.

48:56.326 --> 48:57.387
[SPEAKER_05]: Stupid iPad.

48:59.710 --> 48:59.951
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

49:00.547 --> 49:06.491
[SPEAKER_05]: So, well, we know that Sony has been losing money left and right, hand over fist.

49:07.131 --> 49:09.412
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they would like to make money hand over fist, but they've been losing it.

49:09.973 --> 49:15.836
[SPEAKER_05]: So now they're actually selling their New York City headquarters for $1.1 billion.

49:16.837 --> 49:17.918
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony Corp of America.

49:20.879 --> 49:26.043
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be selling it off to the Chetrick Group, and it's supposed to close in March.

49:26.963 --> 49:38.487
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, keep in mind that the company, it cost them, what was it, $770 million in debt.

49:38.527 --> 49:39.847
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're up to right now.

49:41.028 --> 49:47.950
[SPEAKER_05]: So selling off this money is going to be a big, selling off the building, sorry, is going to be a huge recoup in lost income.

49:48.910 --> 49:53.832
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I'm not sure exactly what it costs to maintain the building.

49:54.932 --> 50:08.899
[SPEAKER_05]: But they have a lot of money to make up So you take a building I know land taxes in New York are horrible They're crazy I used to do property taxes Well we all know New York City is an expensive place to live It's no secret And so the buildings there are worth a lot of money

50:09.626 --> 50:17.835
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see anything about a relocation of business, getting a cheaper building, a place that's going to cost less money to maintain.

50:18.596 --> 50:20.498
[SPEAKER_05]: For all we know, they could move to Montana.

50:21.679 --> 50:23.000
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine Sony in Montana?

50:23.921 --> 50:24.101
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

50:25.808 --> 50:31.392
[SPEAKER_05]: They are going to be allowed to remain in the building for up to three years with the lease back arrangement.

50:32.353 --> 50:34.295
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not like they're moving now.

50:35.215 --> 50:37.617
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that they're letting the building go.

50:37.838 --> 50:39.759
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much they're giving the building back to the bank.

50:40.019 --> 50:42.381
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't heard anything about jobs affected or anything.

50:42.581 --> 50:46.604
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I think it should be mentioned, Sony does more than PlayStation, let's not forget.

50:46.765 --> 50:48.206
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a lot at Sony.

50:48.986 --> 51:03.172
[SPEAKER_09]: you know not even just TVs they have a whole motion picture division and music and I'm sure I doubt very little PlayStation happens in Sony you know we a lot of that has run out of the Bay Area we know that well in Japan for one and in the Bay Area for the U.S.

51:04.271 --> 51:10.993
[SPEAKER_05]: The video games division for Sony is really, I think, it's decent but relatively small potatoes compared to the rest of what they do.

51:11.153 --> 51:12.034
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, sure.

51:13.314 --> 51:14.654
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm not surprised to see it go.

51:14.814 --> 51:20.156
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's way too much expense and it's not even that interesting looking of a building.

51:21.337 --> 51:22.197
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's in New York City.

51:22.237 --> 51:22.857
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a big building.

51:23.117 --> 51:24.317
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of stuff in New York City.

51:24.358 --> 51:25.118
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't make it cool.

51:25.838 --> 51:28.879
[SPEAKER_09]: It will be interesting to see who snatches it up.

51:31.314 --> 51:31.554
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

51:31.995 --> 51:32.215
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

51:32.416 --> 51:33.017
[SPEAKER_09]: Valid question.

51:33.738 --> 51:38.405
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably some corporation with tons of money and corrupt practices to screw us over with.

51:38.425 --> 51:39.186
[SPEAKER_05]: Bank of America.

51:39.467 --> 51:40.869
[SPEAKER_05]: God fuck Bank of America.

51:41.423 --> 51:42.323
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on, Loki.

51:43.404 --> 51:57.927
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so as we were talking about a little bit earlier, lots of games supposed to be coming out this first quarter for the Wii U. Although a lot of them, unfortunately, are just kind of like ports and stuff, but there's some good stuff.

51:58.207 --> 52:01.068
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's talk a little bit about some things coming out.

52:01.668 --> 52:12.175
[SPEAKER_07]: Need for Speed Most Wanted finally coming out to the Wii U in March on the 19th in the US or North America and in Europe on the 21st.

52:12.596 --> 52:13.736
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing really special about that.

52:13.796 --> 52:17.579
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even really know how they're supposed to, I guess, off-screen play mode.

52:18.259 --> 52:24.744
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're going to have that and then you can use it to select your cars and keeps track of your records or something like that.

52:25.584 --> 52:30.708
[SPEAKER_07]: Also bundled, I guess, with the Ultimate Speed Pack which is some piece of DLC because that seems to be kind of the trend there.

52:31.668 --> 52:38.335
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the games that was supposed to be highly anticipated for the first quarter, Aliens Colonial Marines, now doesn't really have a firm date.

52:38.375 --> 52:43.040
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to be launching on the 12th with the actual game on the other consoles.

52:43.881 --> 52:45.062
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead now it's just kind of...

52:46.618 --> 53:09.620
[SPEAKER_07]: TBA you know so hopefully that doesn't mean delayed past March because that would be you know it's another big mature rated game for the console the amazing Spider-Man Ultimate Edition you know getting a port of a game that came out back in June fantastic and of course with DLC thrown in there as well

53:10.982 --> 53:12.023
[SPEAKER_07]: That's coming out in March.

53:12.483 --> 53:22.993
[SPEAKER_07]: And then two games that were expected the first quarter, the Game & Wario and Wonderful 101, which, let's be honest here, two first-party games, those aren't really that exciting.

53:23.273 --> 53:28.278
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know Game & Wario, they didn't really show a whole ton of that.

53:28.959 --> 53:30.260
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the Wonderful 101, sort of like Pikmin...

53:32.782 --> 53:47.574
[SPEAKER_07]: now those are beginning to release date as far as the first half of 2013 so I will be willing to bet that that's probably going to be after first quarter I think Wonderful 101 has its anticipators I think you might be selling it short a little bit there it's not going to sell that well

53:48.903 --> 53:49.743
[SPEAKER_09]: It's too niche.

53:49.863 --> 53:50.604
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

53:51.464 --> 53:56.386
[SPEAKER_09]: I think only because maybe the Wii U hasn't gotten out there as much as possible.

53:56.406 --> 53:57.026
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter.

53:57.347 --> 53:59.828
[SPEAKER_07]: The genre, I think it's going to be too niche.

54:00.028 --> 54:03.589
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a niche appeal to that.

54:04.129 --> 54:04.970
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's going to happen.

54:05.050 --> 54:07.311
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, nothing even mentioned yet.

54:07.731 --> 54:13.153
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Wii Fit U is also supposed to be first half of 2013 as well.

54:13.233 --> 54:14.354
[SPEAKER_07]: So April, May, June.

54:14.394 --> 54:14.774
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

54:14.914 --> 54:17.135
[SPEAKER_07]: You got your three titles there.

54:18.475 --> 54:23.156
[SPEAKER_07]: One title is confirmed, though, for first quarter, and that's going to be LEGO City Undercover.

54:23.476 --> 54:27.817
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually launching on the Wii U in March, on the 3DS in April.

54:28.637 --> 54:31.198
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much the only game that I was actually looking forward to at all.

54:32.658 --> 54:33.158
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's that.

54:33.238 --> 54:38.399
[SPEAKER_07]: And then for the 3DS, there's going to be Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon, which is coming on the 24th of March.

54:38.419 --> 54:38.459
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

54:41.980 --> 54:44.901
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say, well, of course, Fire Emblem in February.

54:44.941 --> 54:52.303
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say, though, that they haven't really announced any other 3DS titles other than Smash Bros., but that's just kind of like, hey, we're working on a Smash Bros.

54:52.343 --> 54:52.584
[SPEAKER_07]: game.

54:53.644 --> 54:58.145
[SPEAKER_07]: But they haven't really announced anything else for second quarter, first party, I think.

54:58.886 --> 55:04.227
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Brain Age Concentration Training, I think that's also February.

55:04.527 --> 55:06.088
[SPEAKER_07]: Pokemon XY, but that's the end of the year.

55:07.640 --> 55:12.939
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a Pokemon Mystery Dungeon game that's coming out at the end of March as well.

55:14.574 --> 55:15.915
[SPEAKER_07]: Pokemon X, Y Pokemon X, Y

55:39.073 --> 55:39.774
[SPEAKER_07]: A really big thing.

55:39.814 --> 55:45.158
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless, you know, there are really no racing games aside from Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing.

55:45.238 --> 55:48.700
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that might be kind of good if you're into that.

55:50.987 --> 56:20.239
[SPEAKER_09]: but yeah it's a lot of ports so that's the only thing that has me worried I mean LEGO City Undercover could drive some console sales because that's a pretty cool looking game but it's not there's no games that really scream oh my god I have to get a Wii U now well the Need for Speed thing I don't think this is coming up on our show or else I might be duplicating something I hope not but I remember reading something about the whole that the Wii U version of Need for Speed will let you do the co-op where you both drive and want to use on the gamepad and want to use on the TV and I gotta admit that's pretty rad

56:21.399 --> 56:28.225
[SPEAKER_09]: They're able to install that fully functional two-player using the Wii U. That is something you're not going to see on the other systems.

56:29.466 --> 56:31.647
[SPEAKER_07]: For what it's worth, I think that's a neat feature.

56:32.088 --> 56:33.188
[SPEAKER_07]: Give that to them, I guess.

56:36.171 --> 56:39.973
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, though, it's not like, oh my god, that's really going to sell it for me.

56:40.074 --> 56:40.414
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just...

56:41.872 --> 56:42.572
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

56:42.652 --> 56:47.074
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sad that, you know, LEGO City, let's not sell LEGO City undercover, you know, that short.

56:47.094 --> 56:48.995
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's a pretty awesome looking game.

56:49.575 --> 56:51.996
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just, I don't know.

56:52.517 --> 56:54.938
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's really going to be enough.

56:56.478 --> 56:56.779
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

56:57.179 --> 56:58.359
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, moving on to another story.

56:58.419 --> 57:01.501
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not about a Wii U release, but a Wii release.

57:01.921 --> 57:03.942
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, basic Wii.

57:04.502 --> 57:09.004
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, you know, obviously a lot of people still own the Nintendo Wii, and it's not like your Wii U can't play Wii games.

57:09.574 --> 57:36.366
[SPEAKER_09]: by the way I also transferred all my data from the Wii to the Wii U this week it was pretty painless so now I can play my virtual console games with the HDMI collection woohoo but I really wish sorry I'll get to this story eventually I need to rant though I really wish because this pisses me off that virtual console is too stupid for this why doesn't the system know to automatically side letterbox or put into the right aspect ratio the virtual console games

57:37.046 --> 57:38.987
[SPEAKER_09]: Why does it still force them to widescreen?

57:39.568 --> 57:41.289
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't it know to script?

57:41.549 --> 57:44.872
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I can set it on my TV, sure, but that's such a pain in the ass.

57:45.372 --> 57:52.057
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't when I boot up Zelda, which is a 4.3 game, like Zelda was not in widescreen on the NES, why can't it just know, oh, flip the resolution back to 4.3?

57:55.131 --> 57:56.012
[SPEAKER_07]: Outro Outro Outro Outro

58:18.650 --> 58:19.451
[SPEAKER_07]: It won't be happening.

58:19.471 --> 58:21.093
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we absolutely sure of that?

58:21.113 --> 58:22.674
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I bet it's going to happen.

58:23.955 --> 58:26.238
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at the virtual console games I have on 3DS.

58:26.478 --> 58:30.281
[SPEAKER_09]: I have not bought anything that wasn't free or not available.

58:30.742 --> 58:31.723
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a couple Game Boy games.

58:32.163 --> 58:33.244
[SPEAKER_09]: Those weren't available before.

58:34.025 --> 58:34.365
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

58:34.966 --> 58:36.768
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe I have maybe two Game Boy games.

58:38.405 --> 58:47.733
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying, I bet you they're going to do that kind of crap, because they try to pull that shit with... Are they still releasing those 3DS games, the retro ones that are in 3D now?

58:48.794 --> 58:50.255
[SPEAKER_07]: They kind of say, yeah, fuck it.

58:50.395 --> 58:53.377
[SPEAKER_09]: There's non-3D ones, all the Mega Man games, that was a big deal, remember?

58:53.437 --> 58:56.980
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I understand that, but are they doing those, remember how they're Excitebike and stuff like that?

58:57.000 --> 58:58.301
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there's been one in a while.

58:58.742 --> 58:59.402
[SPEAKER_07]: There were a few.

58:59.903 --> 59:02.605
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, eh, fuck it, no one's buying them, you know?

59:02.935 --> 59:09.110
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like Xevious and Urban Champion and all these interesting ones but I haven't seen one in a little while.

59:11.376 --> 59:11.657
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

59:13.052 --> 59:15.834
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I thought we were going to get like Zelda in 3D and stuff.

59:16.394 --> 59:16.835
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess not.

59:16.855 --> 59:17.475
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it was too hard.

59:17.575 --> 59:19.497
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, back to what I was originally going to talk about.

59:19.637 --> 59:27.122
[SPEAKER_09]: A Wii game coming out on the Wii U. XSEED has decided to bring over Pandora's Tower to the Wii.

59:27.202 --> 59:32.006
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, this is important because this was the last Operation Rainfall.

59:32.066 --> 59:32.586
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys remember that?

59:32.606 --> 59:38.210
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the last of the three Op Rainfall games that Nintendo was never going to bring over here.

59:38.370 --> 59:41.833
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they finally brought out Xenoblade Chronicles, although it had that

59:42.533 --> 59:44.235
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Exceed or Ignition or Axis game localization.

01:00:03.163 --> 01:00:03.704
[SPEAKER_09]: So here they go.

01:00:03.724 --> 01:00:05.545
[SPEAKER_09]: They're stepping up and putting out Pandora's Tower.

01:00:05.825 --> 01:00:11.991
[SPEAKER_09]: Now it's going to be interesting to see how this does when the Wii U is what's really being pushed right now.

01:00:12.151 --> 01:00:21.860
[SPEAKER_09]: But a lot of folks thought that Last Story, when it got price cuts $20, made a great pickup game for people to get with the Wii U. Because again, why not?

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:23.221
[SPEAKER_09]: You can use the backwards compatibility.

01:00:23.341 --> 01:00:23.802
[SPEAKER_09]: Very easy.

01:00:25.303 --> 01:00:26.924
[SPEAKER_09]: Any interest in Pandora's Tower, Loki?

01:00:28.346 --> 01:00:28.526
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

01:00:28.546 --> 01:00:28.586
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

01:00:30.334 --> 01:00:31.395
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't play anything on my Wii.

01:00:31.875 --> 01:00:32.595
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it's funny.

01:00:32.635 --> 01:00:36.236
[SPEAKER_07]: We booted up the Wii because Nelly was going to play some more Animal Crossing.

01:00:36.516 --> 01:00:42.577
[SPEAKER_07]: So I charged our controllers and... Animal Crossing.

01:00:42.977 --> 01:00:43.617
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I'm eating.

01:00:44.197 --> 01:00:45.478
[SPEAKER_09]: Animal Crossing is on 3DS.

01:00:45.598 --> 01:00:46.378
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a game coming out.

01:00:47.098 --> 01:00:47.738
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's not dated.

01:00:48.738 --> 01:00:49.418
[SPEAKER_09]: It's out in Japan.

01:00:50.319 --> 01:00:51.239
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a fourth quarter game.

01:00:51.259 --> 01:00:53.719
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be sad that it's gotten that delayed.

01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:55.000
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it can be.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.260
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got to be sooner than that.

01:00:57.162 --> 01:01:24.670
[SPEAKER_07]: probably yeah it could be a May game we'll see but I mean seriously though we forgot all about it because it was that you know highly anticipated that we completely forgot about the game I don't know what's it called Animal Crossing Jump Out or something like that Animal Crossing Jump Out no it's like Animal Crossing it's the same fucking game on 3DS I don't know

01:01:25.006 --> 01:01:30.544
[SPEAKER_09]: Occupy Nooks I wish, that would be great Alright, moving on, more news

01:01:31.437 --> 01:01:36.360
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:38.721
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you know that you play as Raiden in that, right?

01:01:39.522 --> 01:01:46.706
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's not what Kojima originally wanted, but he did let go of the story writing so that he could focus on production.

01:01:47.206 --> 01:01:54.471
[SPEAKER_05]: He wanted it to be Gray Fox, who, as we all know from Metal Gear Solid, and he was a character that's...

01:01:55.371 --> 01:02:04.858
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of crap happened to him, and a very, very crazy story if you'd followed the MSX Metal Gear games and really were a fan of the series.

01:02:05.759 --> 01:02:11.183
[SPEAKER_05]: But he said, no, we're going to let the kids play, and they want Raiden, and they want Hack and Slash, so let's go with Raiden.

01:02:12.819 --> 01:02:16.060
[SPEAKER_05]: It would have been so awesome to have a game with Gray Fox, don't you think?

01:02:16.961 --> 01:02:19.082
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead he gets stepped on by Metal Gear.

01:02:20.382 --> 01:02:21.103
[SPEAKER_09]: Sad trombone.

01:02:23.164 --> 01:02:30.207
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's funny, I actually forgot to mention, I played Anarchy Reigns during my game week this week, and it was very subpar.

01:02:30.787 --> 01:02:31.127
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

01:02:31.327 --> 01:02:34.629
[SPEAKER_07]: Which saddened me because I love Platinum games, and...

01:02:35.769 --> 01:02:37.990
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just... It was a mess.

01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:39.631
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not set up well at all.

01:02:39.932 --> 01:02:41.192
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's no story, which is fine.

01:02:41.212 --> 01:02:46.716
[SPEAKER_07]: I find no story being in there, but it was confusing on what the hell you had to do, and the gameplay was just kind of like, eh.

01:02:47.816 --> 01:02:49.537
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like, Mad World was so much better.

01:02:50.038 --> 01:02:54.960
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is, you know, Jack having to do this crap?

01:02:55.361 --> 01:02:56.802
[SPEAKER_07]: Jack's for the play in HD, though.

01:02:56.842 --> 01:02:58.663
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun to play as that character, but it's just...

01:02:59.683 --> 01:03:00.903
[SPEAKER_07]: I just didn't know what the fuck was going on.

01:03:01.023 --> 01:03:03.664
[SPEAKER_07]: But I hope that that's not the case with Metal Gear Rising.

01:03:04.604 --> 01:03:06.545
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think Metal Gear Rising looks pretty awesome.

01:03:06.965 --> 01:03:12.166
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, also there was a comment regarding the trailer that might be Metal Gear Solid V, The Phantom Pain.

01:03:12.426 --> 01:03:13.186
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, that thing.

01:03:13.566 --> 01:03:16.567
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Kojima said that he really liked the trailer and the lighting was very good.

01:03:20.548 --> 01:03:26.469
[SPEAKER_05]: Metal Gear Rising Revengeance is going to be out on February 22nd, so keep your eyes open if you are interested.

01:03:27.799 --> 01:03:31.762
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out very soon.

01:03:32.782 --> 01:03:33.783
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not much this week.

01:03:34.083 --> 01:03:40.207
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty much just Ni No Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch on PS3 this week.

01:03:40.687 --> 01:03:41.468
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is not bad.

01:03:41.488 --> 01:03:44.390
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's supposed to be a pretty awesome PlayStation 3 game.

01:03:44.410 --> 01:03:45.330
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I want to check that out.

01:03:46.511 --> 01:03:49.072
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about the $60 though.

01:03:49.193 --> 01:03:51.714
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I might rent it or wait for credit.

01:03:51.734 --> 01:03:53.215
[SPEAKER_07]: The reviews have said it's been worth it.

01:03:53.435 --> 01:03:53.595
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

01:03:53.615 --> 01:03:55.997
[SPEAKER_07]: They said it's basically... What was the...

01:03:56.617 --> 01:04:01.959
[SPEAKER_07]: The only other thing that's coming out this week is a Sims 3 expansion pack 70s, 80s, and 90s stuff Do people still play Sims 3?

01:04:25.703 --> 01:04:33.057
[SPEAKER_07]: they still have a ton of fucking expansions coming out for the thing so I don't understand why and also apparently apparently that's it

01:04:34.127 --> 01:04:37.410
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, going to Japan, Hitman Absolution on the Xbox 360.

01:04:37.450 --> 01:04:43.516
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, this is the Japanese version, making its way out on January 24th, as well as a game called Instant Brain, but that's a price reduction.

01:04:43.556 --> 01:04:44.517
[SPEAKER_09]: That was already out before.

01:04:44.757 --> 01:04:47.800
[SPEAKER_09]: That is going into Cave, the best series, because that is a cave game.

01:04:48.621 --> 01:04:49.762
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the Xbox 360.

01:04:49.802 --> 01:04:52.585
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to the PlayStation 3, things are a little bit bigger over there.

01:04:53.045 --> 01:04:56.369
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobunaga Yoyabu Online 10th Anniversary Box.

01:04:57.009 --> 01:04:58.070
[SPEAKER_09]: No Paradox, God Something

01:05:20.923 --> 01:05:23.684
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I'm trying to see, let's see if this is a game that we know over here.

01:05:24.525 --> 01:05:26.926
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, hold on, we wouldn't know that from the limited edition art.

01:05:26.986 --> 01:05:28.527
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me look at regular edition.

01:05:29.967 --> 01:05:31.688
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to see if this is a game I recognize at all.

01:05:32.529 --> 01:05:33.849
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't recognize it with the box art.

01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:37.571
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it looks like a Disgaea Tactics-y type of game.

01:05:37.591 --> 01:05:38.711
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a Tactics game.

01:05:39.972 --> 01:05:41.173
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet it's based on anime or something.

01:05:41.193 --> 01:05:41.393
[SPEAKER_01]: With mates.

01:05:41.413 --> 01:05:42.213
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of you chat will know.

01:05:42.873 --> 01:05:43.434
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, of course.

01:05:43.934 --> 01:05:44.174
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:05:45.891 --> 01:05:47.312
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody in chat, I bet, knows more about that.

01:05:48.012 --> 01:05:48.473
[SPEAKER_09]: Mag.

01:05:48.793 --> 01:05:49.413
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember Mag?

01:05:49.974 --> 01:05:51.074
[SPEAKER_09]: Is also getting a price reduction.

01:05:51.094 --> 01:05:52.315
[SPEAKER_09]: Goes into PlayStation 3 the best.

01:05:52.335 --> 01:05:54.176
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, those are Japanese releases.

01:05:54.737 --> 01:05:56.098
[SPEAKER_09]: Looking at the handhelds really quick.

01:05:56.238 --> 01:05:59.280
[SPEAKER_09]: On the PlayStation Vita, pretty busy week, actually.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:07.525
[SPEAKER_09]: Demon Gaze, Genkai Totsuki Monster Monpiece, as well as Sakuraso no Pet no Kanojo.

01:06:08.726 --> 01:06:10.267
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm assuming that's a Pet Sim game.

01:06:10.647 --> 01:06:11.888
[SPEAKER_09]: All on the Vita.

01:06:11.908 --> 01:06:12.608
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:06:12.628 --> 01:06:13.489
[SPEAKER_09]: It talks about little girls.

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:16.451
[SPEAKER_09]: On the Wii U, nothing.

01:06:16.671 --> 01:06:19.514
[SPEAKER_09]: No more Wii U games until January 31st is the next one.

01:06:20.315 --> 01:06:23.637
[SPEAKER_09]: On the Nintendo 3DS, however, ooh, also nothing.

01:06:24.378 --> 01:06:25.519
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing really on the 3DS.

01:06:25.979 --> 01:06:31.264
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo has very little activity over there until February 7th is the Dragon Quest VII remake.

01:06:31.304 --> 01:06:36.568
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure a lot of people will be very excited about that on the 3DS, which I can imagine they won't bring that over here.

01:06:36.929 --> 01:06:38.070
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo's having a nap.

01:06:39.251 --> 01:06:39.811
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe a little bit.

01:06:40.752 --> 01:06:41.152
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

01:06:41.172 --> 01:06:42.113
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are your Japanese releases.

01:06:42.845 --> 01:06:44.285
[SPEAKER_05]: We only have two things for the UK.

01:06:44.346 --> 01:06:46.346
[SPEAKER_05]: On the 24th, we have Strike Suit Zero.

01:06:46.426 --> 01:06:47.827
[SPEAKER_05]: And the 25th, Devil May Cry.

01:06:49.287 --> 01:06:49.607
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, yes.

01:06:49.647 --> 01:06:50.307
[SPEAKER_09]: Devil May Cry.

01:06:51.188 --> 01:06:52.008
[SPEAKER_09]: That came out this week.

01:06:52.448 --> 01:06:52.688
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:06:52.788 --> 01:06:53.428
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to check it out.

01:06:53.468 --> 01:06:53.668
[SPEAKER_09]: I do.

01:06:54.389 --> 01:06:54.669
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:06:55.289 --> 01:06:56.789
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple more news stories for you guys.

01:06:56.809 --> 01:06:58.890
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the classic game of the week.

01:06:59.090 --> 01:07:00.210
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, Loki.

01:07:00.691 --> 01:07:01.091
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

01:07:01.631 --> 01:07:03.351
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's talk about Majesco.

01:07:03.571 --> 01:07:08.753
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Majesco is, I would say, not long for this world anymore.

01:07:09.433 --> 01:07:11.214
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've, you know...

01:07:12.034 --> 01:07:13.535
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely had some problems.

01:07:13.635 --> 01:07:21.902
[SPEAKER_07]: The company experienced a loss of $2.7 million as compared to, I guess, the $3.9 million loss the previous year.

01:07:22.862 --> 01:07:33.671
[SPEAKER_07]: And they said the revenues are up to $132.3 million, but concluded with a net income of $4.6 million down $2 million from last year.

01:07:34.331 --> 01:07:38.614
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's be honest here, Majesco, they don't have a lot of games that they're releasing.

01:07:38.634 --> 01:07:40.476
[SPEAKER_07]: Cookie Mama is not selling like it used to.

01:07:42.517 --> 01:07:44.518
[SPEAKER_07]: Their last say need investing mama, right?

01:07:44.638 --> 01:07:45.719
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that the joke you made on Twitter?

01:07:48.681 --> 01:07:49.261
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember.

01:07:50.021 --> 01:07:51.202
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, come on.

01:07:51.222 --> 01:07:55.805
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the company that decided that, hey, NBA Baller Beats is a good idea.

01:07:56.805 --> 01:07:57.506
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so...

01:07:58.587 --> 01:08:08.676
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, I mean, looking forward to what they have, they've only really got... They have the Young Justice license, so they've got that game coming out at the end of February.

01:08:09.357 --> 01:08:14.301
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, Majesco's not one of those companies that puts out these really huge AAA games anymore.

01:08:14.602 --> 01:08:15.402
[SPEAKER_07]: They just don't.

01:08:17.144 --> 01:08:23.070
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is kind of risky for them, because if these kind of non-AAA titles don't sell well, then...

01:08:24.151 --> 01:08:24.931
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of sucks for them.

01:08:25.231 --> 01:08:29.874
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, maybe Zumba's not selling as well as it used to because I know they have Zumba.

01:08:29.914 --> 01:08:31.515
[SPEAKER_07]: That's their kind of big license right now.

01:08:34.077 --> 01:08:35.398
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know.

01:08:35.938 --> 01:08:37.099
[SPEAKER_07]: No Zumba for the Wii U, I guess.

01:08:37.179 --> 01:08:38.680
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe that's what's hurting them.

01:08:38.982 --> 01:08:40.683
[SPEAKER_09]: So you talking about that made me look.

01:08:40.723 --> 01:08:43.163
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, how much is NBA Baller Beats right now?

01:08:43.183 --> 01:08:44.944
[SPEAKER_09]: $34 on Amazon.

01:08:45.024 --> 01:08:46.405
[SPEAKER_09]: Not going to fucking buy it.

01:08:46.525 --> 01:08:47.985
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the game with the basketball.

01:08:48.045 --> 01:08:52.787
[SPEAKER_07]: I am sitting here going... I bet I could pry that one from my boss.

01:08:52.807 --> 01:08:54.928
[SPEAKER_07]: He's still got it in the packaging at his work.

01:08:54.988 --> 01:08:56.548
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just sitting there because it's a basketball.

01:08:56.568 --> 01:08:57.128
[SPEAKER_09]: Bring it over.

01:08:57.188 --> 01:08:58.529
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do some live gameplay stream.

01:08:58.569 --> 01:09:01.650
[SPEAKER_09]: Who wants to watch League of Legends when you can watch NBA Baller Beats?

01:09:01.790 --> 01:09:02.170
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.

01:09:03.731 --> 01:09:05.031
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get DarkSakura to play one.

01:09:05.051 --> 01:09:07.532
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll call it Two White Guys Play NBA Baller Beats.

01:09:08.211 --> 01:09:08.632
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll play.

01:09:08.992 --> 01:09:09.753
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

01:09:09.793 --> 01:09:11.296
[SPEAKER_07]: There are no ballers and no beats.

01:09:12.417 --> 01:09:16.103
[SPEAKER_07]: White men can't baller or beats.

01:09:16.403 --> 01:09:17.445
[SPEAKER_05]: Plenty of white guys can beat.

01:09:18.411 --> 01:09:20.752
[SPEAKER_07]: All in Mississippi.

01:09:20.892 --> 01:09:23.674
[SPEAKER_07]: Their stock closed down under $1.

01:09:24.555 --> 01:09:25.995
[SPEAKER_07]: They're down to 75 cents.

01:09:26.135 --> 01:09:30.398
[SPEAKER_07]: So hey, if you think they're going to make a comeback, maybe it's time to buy some Majesco stock.

01:09:30.558 --> 01:09:31.638
[SPEAKER_07]: 75 cents, that's not bad.

01:09:32.779 --> 01:09:41.004
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish it was much easier to just go online and buy some stock because I think it would be fun to just go buy 10 shares of Majesco just to say, hey, I own part of Majesco.

01:09:41.904 --> 01:09:46.686
[SPEAKER_09]: And then at the next shareholder meeting, you know, we can hold whoever accountable came up with NBA Baller Beats.

01:09:47.166 --> 01:09:48.847
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, actually, supposedly the game is fun.

01:09:48.907 --> 01:09:49.647
[SPEAKER_09]: I should not get it.

01:09:49.667 --> 01:09:50.428
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't really played it.

01:09:50.648 --> 01:09:53.709
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to try Football 1 next.

01:09:54.329 --> 01:09:56.830
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how that would even work.

01:10:00.752 --> 01:10:07.455
[SPEAKER_05]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lodge Radio on VOGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, yogurt.

01:10:08.396 --> 01:10:10.437
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, one more story here.

01:10:10.477 --> 01:10:12.899
[SPEAKER_09]: This is about the next PlayStation controller.

01:10:13.199 --> 01:10:17.461
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we had some rumors about this already, but now there's more rumors.

01:10:17.501 --> 01:10:17.922
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

01:10:17.982 --> 01:10:20.723
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just using this to illustrate the whole story.

01:10:21.043 --> 01:10:22.464
[SPEAKER_09]: It is not the boomerang, people.

01:10:22.604 --> 01:10:23.225
[SPEAKER_09]: It is not the boomerang.

01:10:23.245 --> 01:10:24.546
[SPEAKER_07]: It's coming back like a boomerang.

01:10:24.766 --> 01:10:32.330
[SPEAKER_09]: But, well, remember when the boomerang thing was for the PlayStation 3 and everybody was like, no!

01:10:33.051 --> 01:10:34.151
[SPEAKER_07]: That could have been comfortable.

01:10:34.211 --> 01:10:34.651
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

01:10:34.671 --> 01:10:34.852
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

01:10:34.872 --> 01:10:35.452
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually like,

01:10:36.949 --> 01:10:38.650
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like such a history thing to say.

01:10:38.670 --> 01:10:39.530
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks so ridiculous.

01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:40.631
[SPEAKER_09]: The boomerang wasn't so bad, you know.

01:10:41.091 --> 01:10:43.392
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks so ridiculous, but maybe it was comfortable.

01:10:43.432 --> 01:10:44.272
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we don't know.

01:10:44.392 --> 01:10:46.213
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't look like it would be very comfortable to me.

01:10:46.393 --> 01:10:46.893
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, whatever.

01:10:47.013 --> 01:10:47.433
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gone.

01:10:47.694 --> 01:10:53.176
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so we've heard about this move thing that might actually be like a transformer into the controller, right?

01:10:55.817 --> 01:10:58.099
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's not what the latest rumors are.

01:10:58.179 --> 01:11:07.506
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, according to a senior game studio in a conversation with CVG, Sony is going to mix up the DualShock design.

01:11:07.967 --> 01:11:12.750
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be biometric sensors on the grips and an LCD touchscreen.

01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:15.853
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, that's what everything's got to have now is a freaking touchscreen.

01:11:16.994 --> 01:11:22.218
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, they are trying to emulate the same user interface philosophies as the PlayStation Vita.

01:11:23.661 --> 01:11:26.447
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, I like the Vita and all, okay?

01:11:26.487 --> 01:11:31.237
[SPEAKER_09]: The touchscreen's cool, the two analog sticks are cool, but the rear touchpad, let it go.

01:11:31.958 --> 01:11:33.521
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop trying to make rear touchpad happen.

01:11:33.962 --> 01:11:34.183
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop.

01:11:35.868 --> 01:11:40.253
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you understand that reaching around is like, you know, has some bad connotations to that?

01:11:40.333 --> 01:11:45.579
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's just... Even in DJ Max, which I think... I know some people who really like reaching around.

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:50.465
[SPEAKER_09]: Even in DJ Max, which I think does it better than most of the Vita games, like, I'm just like, turn it off.

01:11:50.685 --> 01:11:51.166
[SPEAKER_09]: Turn it off.

01:11:51.686 --> 01:11:52.107
[SPEAKER_09]: Turn it off.

01:11:53.989 --> 01:11:54.249
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

01:11:56.856 --> 01:12:08.601
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought for a second there, instead of leading up to, oh yeah, we're mimicking the control interface of the Vita, it was going to be, we're mimicking the control interface of the Wii U. Because that's basically...

01:12:09.537 --> 01:12:10.438
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

01:12:28.892 --> 01:12:41.299
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, let's not say this would be a pretty awesome thing if they decide, hey, the next-gen console, it is going to be the Wii U. It's going to be the Vita that they throw into the box.

01:12:41.419 --> 01:12:42.259
[SPEAKER_07]: It comes with a Vita.

01:12:42.739 --> 01:12:44.920
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got a Vita, and you've got the PlayStation 4.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:45.201
[SPEAKER_07]: Boom!

01:12:46.281 --> 01:12:46.721
[SPEAKER_07]: Right there.

01:12:47.062 --> 01:12:52.285
[SPEAKER_07]: Portable, and you've got your console, and you can take your controller when you go.

01:12:52.325 --> 01:13:01.932
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, because, don't get me wrong, I bet it would be pretty awesome if you could take that Wii U game tablet and stream games from a Wi-Fi spot somewhere else in the world.

01:13:01.952 --> 01:13:05.754
[SPEAKER_09]: Which you can kind of already do with the PlayStation 3 and the PSP, for God's sake.

01:13:05.814 --> 01:13:08.096
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so wouldn't it be kind of awesome if you could do that?

01:13:08.396 --> 01:13:12.399
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if you could play virtual console games on there, you could take that.

01:13:12.419 --> 01:13:13.900
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's a little bit big, but come on.

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:14.940
[SPEAKER_09]: PS1 classics?

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:16.041
[SPEAKER_09]: And PS2 classics?

01:13:16.641 --> 01:13:21.503
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about the Wii U. I'm just saying, wouldn't it be awesome if you could do that with the Wii U controller?

01:13:21.663 --> 01:13:27.046
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty big, but people carry tablets around, so why not?

01:13:27.106 --> 01:13:33.889
[SPEAKER_09]: Regardless of whether this current rumor is fact or crap or whatever, how do you feel about them redesigning the DualShock?

01:13:34.957 --> 01:13:59.331
[SPEAKER_09]: for all practical purposes at the point we're at now throwing out the six axis and everything you know the PlayStation 3 controller you get now is a very tiny evolution from the original PlayStation controller I mean really I mean granted okay I guess the analog sticks came a little later the very very first PlayStation controllers didn't have them but still the core of that controller has not changed that much since the beginning

01:13:59.591 --> 01:14:00.252
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:14:12.819 --> 01:14:13.719
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's going to be a gimmick.

01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:16.141
[SPEAKER_07]: Biometric sensors are on there.

01:14:17.581 --> 01:14:18.522
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is a gimmick.

01:14:18.682 --> 01:14:22.964
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a gimmick that also a lot of cell phone games and a lot of stuff uses.

01:14:23.424 --> 01:14:25.265
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no one really uses 6Xs anymore.

01:14:25.525 --> 01:14:35.490
[SPEAKER_07]: But even like... It seems like a lot of the stuff that Sony's been doing lately has just been to kind of mimic... Because even with the Wii, everybody got into motion gaming right after the Wii.

01:14:35.970 --> 01:14:39.532
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, we've been working on the Move controller since a long time ago.

01:14:39.552 --> 01:14:39.672
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:14:40.672 --> 01:15:05.298
[SPEAKER_07]: come on it just it never took off and now you know some of these patents that we see look really ridiculous i mean no one's gonna fucking strap move controllers to your feet and do like a flip kick in your goddamn living room no one's gonna do that um so they need to come up with a new they need to come up with something new then you come out with the wow factor because if you're fucking emulating someone else or doing the same shit you're doing now no one's gonna care no one's gonna be like why do i have to buy this i can already fucking do that now

01:15:05.795 --> 01:15:08.677
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really what it comes down to is the wow factor.

01:15:08.837 --> 01:15:10.037
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's going to sell your console.

01:15:10.558 --> 01:15:10.838
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

01:15:11.418 --> 01:15:14.260
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's travel back in time to a time when, you know what?

01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:17.481
[SPEAKER_09]: The controller, it was a stick and a button, and you liked it.

01:15:17.561 --> 01:15:18.022
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

01:15:18.282 --> 01:15:19.222
[SPEAKER_09]: One stick, one button.

01:15:19.502 --> 01:15:20.763
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, we have more buttons for this one.

01:15:20.863 --> 01:15:21.183
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:15:21.243 --> 01:15:23.004
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe this game isn't quite that old.

01:15:24.045 --> 01:15:30.848
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's still a classic, so let's dive into the gaming vault where DarkSakura is going to pick out an oldie moldie video game and say, Hey...

01:15:31.969 --> 01:15:33.730
[SPEAKER_09]: Play it, because it's cool.

01:15:33.970 --> 01:15:35.070
[SPEAKER_09]: You probably forgot about it.

01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:37.731
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a cool one, and probably not many people have seen it.

01:15:38.932 --> 01:15:43.954
[SPEAKER_05]: The classic game in Japan was called Zexex.

01:15:44.134 --> 01:15:46.495
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm pronouncing it right, because it's X-E-X-E-X.

01:15:47.575 --> 01:15:48.935
[SPEAKER_05]: Over here we had it as Oreus.

01:15:49.676 --> 01:15:55.357
[SPEAKER_05]: It came out in 1991, a side-scrolling shooting game, and it was actually really unique for its time.

01:15:56.497 --> 01:16:00.758
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami was really influenced by a lot of stuff that Irem put out.

01:16:00.938 --> 01:16:09.260
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually has influences from R-Type, which everyone knows R-Type is among one of my favorite games, and the tentacle mechanics that came from X-Multiply.

01:16:10.669 --> 01:16:21.359
[SPEAKER_05]: It did not at all get a home release until it came out with Salamander Portable that came out on the PSP, which somebody in this room enabled me to get that game for my husband.

01:16:21.399 --> 01:16:22.080
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Loki.

01:16:24.903 --> 01:16:27.825
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it's really, really an amazing shooter.

01:16:28.686 --> 01:16:34.011
[SPEAKER_05]: It had some really interesting mechanics.

01:16:36.073 --> 01:16:39.975
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened with this one, like I said, it's similar to R-Type and X-Multiply.

01:16:40.015 --> 01:16:44.417
[SPEAKER_05]: You play a ship called the Flintlock that has this detachable orb called a Flint.

01:16:45.258 --> 01:16:47.639
[SPEAKER_05]: And it acts sort of like R-Type's force.

01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:57.324
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can get power-ups to boost Flint's power, your movement, you're changing your weapon, increase your life count.

01:16:58.125 --> 01:17:02.267
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are a bunch of changes that came out, though, in the non-Japanese versions.

01:17:02.807 --> 01:17:03.568
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them being...

01:17:04.028 --> 01:17:07.950
[SPEAKER_05]: They removed all but one of the upgradeable weapons and they changed the enemy patterns.

01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:14.833
[SPEAKER_05]: For different weapons, in the US, there was only the proton laser.

01:17:16.493 --> 01:17:29.839
[SPEAKER_05]: In the Japanese version, you start with a proton laser and then you get a homing laser, a shadow laser, a round laser, a spiral laser, which is a lot like the Gradius Ripple, a search laser that's kind of like a homing laser, and a ground laser.

01:17:30.939 --> 01:17:36.943
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very similar to the fire one that would travel across the floor from R-Type.

01:17:38.264 --> 01:17:46.750
[SPEAKER_05]: And so basically the story of the game, you have to save the princess named Irene from the planet East Square from an evil dude named Klaus.

01:17:47.210 --> 01:17:50.412
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's different cutscenes and she's crying for help and she's tortured.

01:17:51.213 --> 01:17:55.976
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you have to basically go through the game.

01:17:56.096 --> 01:17:58.958
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's naked people in the ending of the game, just saying.

01:18:00.739 --> 01:18:01.980
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen up, acidic vampire.

01:18:03.662 --> 01:18:12.789
[SPEAKER_05]: But the big thing about Zexix that I thought was really amazing, and Rob, you can see this right in front of you, is the level design.

01:18:13.409 --> 01:18:17.673
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, for 1991, the backgrounds look like shit right out of Tron.

01:18:17.833 --> 01:18:18.794
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously.

01:18:19.394 --> 01:18:24.918
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got very... Well, I like the little tentacle shots the thing does.

01:18:24.938 --> 01:18:25.159
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:18:25.279 --> 01:18:26.720
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, it shoots out all these little tentacles.

01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:29.202
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually had never really heard of this game, so...

01:18:29.662 --> 01:18:34.646
[SPEAKER_09]: Zexix is a really... I definitely see the Gradius inspiredness in it.

01:18:35.067 --> 01:18:40.752
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot of the use of the flint is definitely like using the force in R-Type.

01:18:42.753 --> 01:18:45.235
[SPEAKER_05]: The game is actually pretty challenging.

01:18:45.756 --> 01:18:47.117
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really difficult game.

01:18:47.477 --> 01:18:53.242
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thankfully got to play a copy a while back off of the Supergun.

01:18:54.783 --> 01:18:57.805
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so, this was ages ago.

01:18:57.945 --> 01:19:03.688
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is actually a game that I don't know if it's, um, if they've gotten it to work on MAME yet.

01:19:03.828 --> 01:19:09.471
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to check because Zexex is like, it's seriously one of the classics when it comes to shooters.

01:19:09.532 --> 01:19:11.713
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a bullet hell, definitely, by any means.

01:19:12.433 --> 01:19:19.836
[SPEAKER_05]: But it requires a lot of steady movement, a lot of really good reflex to make your way through it.

01:19:20.316 --> 01:19:22.037
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just an amazing game.

01:19:22.537 --> 01:19:31.321
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would say, unfortunately, the only way to get a hold of it for any type of home version is getting the PSP version.

01:19:31.561 --> 01:19:35.463
[SPEAKER_05]: It's again under the Salamander Portable.

01:19:36.503 --> 01:19:56.068
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's also you can find this really inexpensive for PSP it didn't cost a lot I think when I bought it new it was like 30 bucks and that's you know an import and of course there's no region lockout on the PSP so the chatters are saying it is in Maine if you want to if you want to turn to the dark side of the internet where everybody's at

01:19:56.877 --> 01:19:59.338
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I haven't touched anything on name and ages.

01:19:59.378 --> 01:20:01.400
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan and I are probably going to be making a new cab soon.

01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:10.925
[SPEAKER_05]: But seriously, if anyone loves shooting games, and especially if you're a fan of Konami shooters and love Irem shooters, you really owe it to yourself to play this one.

01:20:10.945 --> 01:20:12.126
[SPEAKER_05]: Zexix is a great game.

01:20:14.188 --> 01:20:43.122
[SPEAKER_09]: and that's it alright there it is your classic game of the week over here it was called Oreus if you happen to find an arcade cab of it take a picture of it for me please alright we are going to come back after a quick break here with more of Orange Lounge Radio including a game we've talked about a bit here on Orange Lounge Radio finally official this week we're going to talk about Disney Infinity when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this

01:20:49.474 --> 01:20:59.161
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live with the 490th episode of our program for this January the 20th of 2013.

01:20:59.381 --> 01:21:04.345
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope those of you guys that have an extended weekend here in the States make the most of it.

01:21:05.105 --> 01:21:11.551
[SPEAKER_09]: Let us not forget, though, the memory of Martin Luther King Jr., the reason why we have the weekend.

01:21:11.631 --> 01:21:17.537
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I was going to play the I Have a Dream speech during the break tonight, but it's like 18 minutes, which is a little bit long for a break.

01:21:17.897 --> 01:21:25.283
[SPEAKER_09]: But I encourage you all, just as a little reminder of what we've been through, take a listen to it.

01:21:26.645 --> 01:21:36.594
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I wanted to talk, getting back to games a little bit, I promised at the start of Part B, because I forgot to talk about this during my gaming week, I want to talk about Wake Up Club on the PlayStation Vita.

01:21:36.614 --> 01:21:44.402
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you guys heard about this game, and I use that term very loosely, have you guys heard that game at all, or played that game, heard about it?

01:21:44.902 --> 01:21:45.223
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody?

01:21:45.243 --> 01:21:45.423
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody?

01:21:45.663 --> 01:21:45.843
[SPEAKER_09]: No?

01:21:46.303 --> 01:21:47.404
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

01:21:47.424 --> 01:21:48.384
[SPEAKER_09]: I downloaded it today.

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:49.545
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you checked it out at all?

01:21:49.585 --> 01:21:49.785
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

01:21:50.065 --> 01:22:05.533
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, it's this app for the PlayStation Vita, and it basically, you know, you can choose from these different skins that are alarm clocks or whatever, like a motor storm background or a journey background or whatever, and you can do the little alarm clock.

01:22:05.613 --> 01:22:10.435
[SPEAKER_09]: But what you do is that when you're on the clock, you tell it what time you want to get up or whatever, you put it to sleep.

01:22:10.835 --> 01:22:12.216
[SPEAKER_09]: And then what happens is in the morning,

01:22:13.036 --> 01:22:14.598
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:22:37.017 --> 01:22:37.238
[SPEAKER_09]: Wake up!

01:22:37.258 --> 01:22:37.498
[SPEAKER_09]: Wake up!

01:22:37.518 --> 01:22:37.698
[SPEAKER_09]: Wake up!

01:22:54.175 --> 01:23:01.544
[SPEAKER_09]: Taunt it all you want, but the gamification of an alarm clock is a pretty neat idea, I've got to say.

01:23:02.185 --> 01:23:11.897
[SPEAKER_09]: And why especially this is interesting on the Vita is that if you think about it, this gives people a reason to remember they have a Vita.

01:23:13.138 --> 01:23:13.598
[SPEAKER_09]: For real.

01:23:13.678 --> 01:23:18.300
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there hasn't been a whole lot on the PlayStation Vita that people have gotten that excited about.

01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:22.701
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not saying that Wake Up Club is the Vita system saver.

01:23:22.881 --> 01:23:25.922
[SPEAKER_09]: No, nobody's going to buy a Vita just for silly Wake Up Club.

01:23:26.622 --> 01:23:35.245
[SPEAKER_09]: But something that gets the PlayStation Vita into your daily routine is a really smart move on Sony's part.

01:23:35.765 --> 01:23:37.826
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I'm giving them too much credit, but...

01:23:38.687 --> 01:23:41.132
[SPEAKER_09]: if they really thought that's what they were going to try to do.

01:23:41.573 --> 01:23:44.660
[SPEAKER_09]: But if that was what they were going for, well played.

01:23:45.943 --> 01:23:46.263
[SPEAKER_09]: Thoughts?

01:23:48.012 --> 01:24:02.843
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see how it would be interesting and definitely it's a way to keep the Vita in the... Like you said, putting it in someone's daily routine will keep it constantly in their... For example, I know it's not exactly the same, but having my iPhone, it's my alarm clock.

01:24:03.143 --> 01:24:06.326
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep in touch with my family through it, texting all the time.

01:24:06.666 --> 01:24:07.527
[SPEAKER_05]: I even use it at work now.

01:24:07.547 --> 01:24:08.187
[SPEAKER_05]: It's text write-off.

01:24:08.687 --> 01:24:08.968
But...

01:24:09.568 --> 01:24:10.369
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:24:32.262 --> 01:24:33.643
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:24:58.030 --> 01:24:58.970
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:25:17.097 --> 01:25:17.838
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god.

01:25:17.858 --> 01:25:26.044
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I saw pictures on Tumblr of people like laying half in their bed with their face on the alarm clock to register the pressure and they're still asleep.

01:25:26.184 --> 01:25:26.965
[SPEAKER_05]: See, that would be me.

01:25:27.065 --> 01:25:28.126
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd learn how to do it in my sleep.

01:25:28.546 --> 01:25:30.167
[SPEAKER_05]: I turn off my iPhone all the time in my sleep.

01:25:30.307 --> 01:25:33.169
[SPEAKER_05]: I need the Vita to give me an electric shock to really wake me up.

01:25:34.590 --> 01:25:34.871
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob.

01:25:35.211 --> 01:25:35.631
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God.

01:25:35.952 --> 01:25:38.234
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, not the sounds of my mother waking me up.

01:25:38.354 --> 01:25:38.734
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob.

01:25:39.114 --> 01:25:40.356
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, you're going to be late for work.

01:25:40.496 --> 01:25:40.916
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob.

01:25:41.196 --> 01:25:41.697
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

01:25:41.757 --> 01:25:42.397
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what you need.

01:25:42.417 --> 01:25:45.000
[SPEAKER_09]: If you get fired from your job, Rob, you're going to be homeless.

01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:46.881
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, you are not moving in here, Rob.

01:25:47.642 --> 01:25:48.823
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, get up.

01:25:49.123 --> 01:25:50.044
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

01:25:50.524 --> 01:25:54.048
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, this is a copyright Orange Jones Radio and me and Rob.

01:25:55.349 --> 01:25:58.071
[SPEAKER_05]: This is your mom, the alarm clock.

01:25:59.052 --> 01:26:00.233
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we need to invent, Rob.

01:26:00.333 --> 01:26:01.254
[SPEAKER_05]: Your mom, the alarm clock.

01:26:03.069 --> 01:26:04.609
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, get out of bed!

01:26:04.629 --> 01:26:06.590
[SPEAKER_05]: The neighbors are going to call the police.

01:26:06.610 --> 01:26:07.390
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry Rob's neighbors.

01:26:30.272 --> 01:26:30.593
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:26:31.533 --> 01:26:31.954
[SPEAKER_09]: That was my mom.

01:26:31.974 --> 01:26:32.775
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Wake Up Club.

01:26:32.915 --> 01:26:34.096
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to throw that out there.

01:26:34.276 --> 01:26:36.578
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a thing that happened this week I forgot to talk about.

01:26:36.758 --> 01:26:38.640
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's a game, but it's not.

01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:44.825
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, again, Enrageinator and our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, yeah, Rob, way too much credit.

01:26:45.717 --> 01:26:49.140
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder what it'd be like if I put this in it.

01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:49.800
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't bake.

01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:50.601
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:27:14.096 --> 01:27:15.917
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's go to some rapid-fire news.

01:27:15.937 --> 01:27:18.738
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk about some other video game news happening around the industry right now.

01:27:18.878 --> 01:27:19.938
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry for Rob's neighbors.

01:27:20.899 --> 01:27:21.239
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all right.

01:27:21.399 --> 01:27:21.779
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll deal.

01:27:21.899 --> 01:27:22.139
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki?

01:27:22.679 --> 01:27:22.999
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:28.982
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's talk a little bit about the survey that they sent out for Call of Duty.

01:27:29.542 --> 01:27:37.165
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of hinting at some stuff that may be available for the next iteration of it.

01:27:37.885 --> 01:27:39.566
[SPEAKER_07]: And it includes stuff saying...

01:27:40.046 --> 01:27:42.909
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, what kind of special things do you want at retail?

01:28:02.048 --> 01:28:08.391
[SPEAKER_07]: There's collectible sets featuring character vehicles and scenery from the game, similar to the Halo Mega Bloks stuff.

01:28:08.932 --> 01:28:10.893
[SPEAKER_07]: Custom-branded audio soundbar.

01:28:11.253 --> 01:28:11.473
[SPEAKER_07]: Lame.

01:28:12.053 --> 01:28:14.295
[SPEAKER_07]: Custom-branded gaming headset.

01:28:14.435 --> 01:28:14.995
[SPEAKER_07]: Also lame.

01:28:15.275 --> 01:28:17.556
[SPEAKER_07]: And custom-branded wireless router.

01:28:18.937 --> 01:28:20.338
[SPEAKER_07]: No, just don't.

01:28:21.219 --> 01:28:22.901
[SPEAKER_07]: Operational Desktop Sentry Gun.

01:28:23.501 --> 01:28:25.163
[SPEAKER_07]: There's your winning pick right there.

01:28:26.464 --> 01:28:28.085
[SPEAKER_07]: And they had some other pictures from it.

01:28:28.125 --> 01:28:29.967
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, they took them down because of NDA.

01:28:30.587 --> 01:28:37.193
[SPEAKER_07]: They're saying also that there might be a digital version to pre-download to your console, and then it'll be available to play at 12.01 a.m.

01:28:37.213 --> 01:28:37.734
[SPEAKER_07]: on launch day.

01:28:39.615 --> 01:28:48.660
[SPEAKER_07]: which is kind of cool if they did that and it says maybe that'll be something that'll be featured in next-gen consoles being able to kind of pre-download stuff like you can on Steam

01:28:48.953 --> 01:28:51.934
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, like Steam or World of Warcraft did that with the expansions.

01:28:52.214 --> 01:28:53.834
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I don't know why they can't do that.

01:28:54.014 --> 01:28:58.035
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they've got day one patches, you know, and stuff.

01:28:59.035 --> 01:29:00.035
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let me put it this way.

01:29:00.075 --> 01:29:03.816
[SPEAKER_07]: Day one patches might not be a good way to go because, let's say, for example, you do that.

01:29:05.596 --> 01:29:10.677
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if they did it with the console version and you weren't able to connect online, you would never be able to play your game.

01:29:10.937 --> 01:29:13.378
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's just say that they were able to lock that out to just...

01:29:15.659 --> 01:29:16.039
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

01:29:16.119 --> 01:29:23.644
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not have it built in where you can download the game and then piracy is gone as far as print late before release.

01:29:23.664 --> 01:29:25.204
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

01:29:25.445 --> 01:29:26.065
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like a good idea.

01:29:28.566 --> 01:29:31.128
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's some pretty good news here.

01:29:31.948 --> 01:29:32.789
[SPEAKER_07]: Skyrim.

01:29:33.509 --> 01:29:39.153
[SPEAKER_07]: All the wonderful DLC that you've been missing on the PS3.

01:29:39.833 --> 01:29:40.874
[SPEAKER_07]: It's finally coming.

01:29:41.754 --> 01:29:44.916
[SPEAKER_07]: Dragonborn, the latest expansion for the game.

01:29:44.936 --> 01:29:46.877
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be hitting PC on February 5th.

01:29:48.177 --> 01:29:55.061
[SPEAKER_07]: Also in February, all the other expansions are going to be coming out as well on PS3.

01:29:55.141 --> 01:29:59.123
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe they're even offering them at half cost for the first week.

01:29:59.143 --> 01:30:00.083
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry it's late.

01:30:00.764 --> 01:30:01.304
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

01:30:02.424 --> 01:30:03.266
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not bad.

01:30:03.386 --> 01:30:06.231
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought them all half off on PC.

01:30:07.834 --> 01:30:11.521
[SPEAKER_07]: Building the house in Hearthfire is kind of cool, I guess.

01:30:12.202 --> 01:30:12.563
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

01:30:12.663 --> 01:30:14.006
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like the Orphan Kid scene.

01:30:15.044 --> 01:30:16.545
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you can adopt me!

01:30:16.965 --> 01:30:19.025
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not gonna adopt you.

01:30:19.245 --> 01:30:22.166
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if it goes anything like Fable was, I never came home.

01:30:22.206 --> 01:30:24.227
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can't kill the kids, because that's wrong.

01:30:25.548 --> 01:30:27.028
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can't even do that in Skyrim.

01:30:27.428 --> 01:30:29.829
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I'm sure somebody hacked it in.

01:30:30.049 --> 01:30:32.110
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure some sicko hacked it in.

01:30:32.150 --> 01:30:33.910
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course you can do it on the PC.

01:30:34.330 --> 01:30:36.591
[SPEAKER_09]: You see what PC gaming supports, DarkSakura?

01:30:37.792 --> 01:30:39.052
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't paying attention, sorry.

01:30:39.414 --> 01:30:40.015
[SPEAKER_07]: Killing children.

01:30:41.296 --> 01:30:44.059
[SPEAKER_07]: And for some reason when I loot all of the women all their clothes come off.

01:30:44.099 --> 01:30:45.982
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really know why that happens.

01:30:46.002 --> 01:30:47.083
[SPEAKER_09]: Sickos on the PC.

01:30:47.323 --> 01:30:47.664
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

01:30:47.864 --> 01:30:48.525
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so weird.

01:30:49.065 --> 01:30:51.428
[SPEAKER_07]: Also have a torture chamber with slave maidens.

01:30:52.569 --> 01:30:56.173
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got the PC sicko story to top all of this coming up but hold on.

01:30:56.974 --> 01:30:58.176
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I need to get Skyrim now.

01:30:59.637 --> 01:31:07.845
[SPEAKER_07]: Last but not least, La Milana and Leisure Suit Larry are some of the titles that are included on the next Steam Greenlight.

01:31:08.365 --> 01:31:09.126
[SPEAKER_07]: This is pretty cool.

01:31:09.166 --> 01:31:16.473
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got DLC Quest, which honestly wasn't a very long game, but cool.

01:31:17.214 --> 01:31:22.479
[SPEAKER_07]: Eidor, Masters of the Broken World, Mac, The Age of Decadence,

01:31:23.039 --> 01:31:29.121
[SPEAKER_07]: Yunpik, and War for the Overworld are some of the other titles that are going to be coming out.

01:31:29.961 --> 01:31:32.442
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

01:31:33.302 --> 01:31:37.404
[SPEAKER_07]: And Akaneiro Demon Hunters, which I think... Isn't that that...

01:31:39.944 --> 01:31:43.648
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, isn't that the new game that they're working on?

01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:45.930
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it American McGee or something?

01:31:46.570 --> 01:31:49.673
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's that American McGee game, if I remember correctly.

01:31:50.174 --> 01:31:55.478
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also a Groboto modeling app, which is actually software.

01:31:55.559 --> 01:32:01.944
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the Articity Draft game design tool is another non-gaming thing that got greenlit.

01:32:02.785 --> 01:32:10.012
[SPEAKER_09]: So, just so you know, La Mulana, that was a game that, you know, Dark Tetsuya used to write about a lot on OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

01:32:10.052 --> 01:32:11.073
[SPEAKER_09]: He was very excited about it.

01:32:11.414 --> 01:32:16.919
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually went to Dark Tetsuya and I said, could I get a quote, sir, about how you feel about La Mulana getting the Project Greenlight?

01:32:16.939 --> 01:32:17.860
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is what he had to say.

01:32:23.171 --> 01:32:24.933
[SPEAKER_09]: That was an actual Kermit flail, by the way.

01:32:24.953 --> 01:32:26.975
[SPEAKER_09]: That was an actual, real deal Kermit flail.

01:32:27.535 --> 01:32:27.956
[SPEAKER_09]: Just so you know.

01:32:29.397 --> 01:32:31.540
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if anybody was Kermit flailing over this.

01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:32.861
[SPEAKER_09]: More like, da fuck?

01:32:33.962 --> 01:32:37.646
[SPEAKER_09]: But people are modding Alan Wake on the PC.

01:32:37.786 --> 01:32:39.788
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, that's what people do to PC games.

01:32:39.828 --> 01:32:40.329
[SPEAKER_09]: They mod them.

01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:42.210
[SPEAKER_09]: But what...

01:32:44.152 --> 01:33:03.112
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess apparently it wasn't supposed to be moddable, it was supposed to have permissions, licenses, whatever, that ain't gonna, hackers gonna hack, hackers gonna hack, and you gotta love this, they did all 2.9 gigs, unraveled it, put it back together, and what was the community tool that they put out, what did they put out in response to you'll never hack Alan Wake?

01:33:03.752 --> 01:33:13.894
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody put a Hello Kitty flashlight into Alan Wake where the little flashlight will actually always be the little Hello Kitty image when it shines on the wall.

01:33:14.614 --> 01:33:15.695
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see the little boat.

01:33:15.735 --> 01:33:18.395
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me see if in the video you get a better shot of it.

01:33:18.495 --> 01:33:19.195
[SPEAKER_01]: I can kind of see it.

01:33:19.215 --> 01:33:20.115
[SPEAKER_09]: You can kind of see it there?

01:33:20.195 --> 01:33:20.396
[SPEAKER_09]: See?

01:33:20.716 --> 01:33:20.976
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

01:33:20.996 --> 01:33:22.256
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello Kitty flashlight.

01:33:22.996 --> 01:33:23.496
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.

01:33:23.516 --> 01:33:28.677
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's what my Alan Wake needs and I can kill the bad guys, the little shadows, with Hello Kitty.

01:33:29.998 --> 01:33:30.898
[SPEAKER_09]: Kill them with cuteness.

01:33:31.818 --> 01:33:32.218
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't.

01:33:33.467 --> 01:33:36.949
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this... I don't even know what the hell to say about this.

01:33:37.390 --> 01:33:41.232
[SPEAKER_09]: This community could have used a little bit of cuteness, because this was just stupid.

01:33:41.532 --> 01:33:44.374
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, this is one of the stupidest things I've ever seen in gaming, like, ever.

01:33:47.316 --> 01:33:50.799
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, did you see this fuckery?

01:33:51.739 --> 01:33:59.305
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the pre-order bonus for the European Australian Dead Island Riptide Zombie Bait Edition.

01:33:59.345 --> 01:33:59.505
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

01:33:59.625 --> 01:34:00.606
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a collector's edition.

01:34:00.686 --> 01:34:00.986
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, whatever.

01:34:01.006 --> 01:34:01.727
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a pre-order bonus.

01:34:01.847 --> 01:34:02.187
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

01:34:02.387 --> 01:34:03.828
[SPEAKER_09]: Severed limbs for everybody.

01:34:03.929 --> 01:34:04.869
[SPEAKER_09]: Collector's edition.

01:34:04.989 --> 01:34:20.882
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a severed torso of an apparently British female, and I'm only guessing that because she's got the little Union Jack bra thing going for her, but she is all bloodified, decapitated, armless, and limbless.

01:34:21.562 --> 01:34:22.403
[SPEAKER_09]: It is gross.

01:34:22.983 --> 01:34:24.624
[SPEAKER_09]: Who would want this in their house?

01:34:25.465 --> 01:34:40.154
[SPEAKER_09]: And especially kind of fucking tacky to announce this type of thing the day that Joe Biden is sitting down with the video game industry to talk about, you know, is there a correlation between blah, blah, blah.

01:34:40.495 --> 01:34:45.998
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, before y'all correct me, I am aware it was the Europe and Australian pre-order bonus.

01:34:46.339 --> 01:34:49.201
[SPEAKER_09]: So they were the ones to announce it, not the U.S.

01:34:50.121 --> 01:34:50.762
[SPEAKER_09]: arm of the company.

01:34:51.882 --> 01:35:08.918
[SPEAKER_09]: However, somebody finally figured, you know, maybe this is kind of tacky Maybe we don't really need this Maybe this is just in bad taste And so they came out and said, we sincerely regret this choice And we're committed to making sure this will never happen again

01:35:09.438 --> 01:35:13.440
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, what happens to the people that already pre-ordered it?

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:15.861
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if they even say it won't happen again.

01:35:15.881 --> 01:35:17.702
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't say we're going to pull this.

01:35:17.862 --> 01:35:18.962
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not going to sell this.

01:35:19.002 --> 01:35:20.163
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't mention that at all.

01:35:20.183 --> 01:35:22.344
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just saying we won't do this again.

01:35:26.646 --> 01:35:28.947
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing said that they're going to stop doing it now.

01:35:29.007 --> 01:35:31.168
[SPEAKER_07]: They just said, oh, well, we're not going to do it again.

01:35:32.604 --> 01:36:01.427
[SPEAKER_09]: AlanAlchemy in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says it's super sexed up and gross it's for neckbeards to fap too see that's the sick thing like this is sick already but then you have to realize because it is an inanimate object somebody will stick their dick in it and that makes it like 10 times like a million times worse as if this could even get worse you realize somebody's gonna put their dick in it and it's just like this is too much that was a joke already made that just saying

01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:06.102
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, but it doesn't end there.

01:36:08.625 --> 01:36:12.471
[SPEAKER_09]: A new game was made this week by the Encyclopedia Dramatica forums.

01:36:12.631 --> 01:36:12.912
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, go figure.

01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:18.001
[SPEAKER_09]: called Bullet to the Head of the NRA.

01:36:18.101 --> 01:36:19.602
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that is the name of the game.

01:36:20.022 --> 01:36:21.783
[SPEAKER_09]: Bullet to the Head of the NRA.

01:36:22.223 --> 01:36:29.566
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a first-person shooter, if you want to call it that, that lets you just shoot NRA boss Wayne LaPierre.

01:36:31.827 --> 01:36:35.949
[SPEAKER_09]: The intent of this game was to do nothing but to just piss people off.

01:36:37.655 --> 01:36:38.155
[SPEAKER_09]: Ding, ding, ding.

01:36:38.195 --> 01:36:41.897
[SPEAKER_09]: Imagine Encyclopedia Dramatica releasing something that would just piss people off.

01:36:42.257 --> 01:36:47.199
[SPEAKER_09]: Quote, share this everywhere, especially gun nut and anti-game websites.

01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:52.362
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, see if you can't send it to the NRA somehow, like through the feedback on their website or something.

01:36:52.702 --> 01:37:00.065
[SPEAKER_09]: This is from forum user Gizmo01942 who also is developing a game based on the Sandy Hook shooting.

01:37:00.945 --> 01:37:04.247
[SPEAKER_09]: You will actually get to go to the Connecticut school and shoot kids because...

01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:08.573
[SPEAKER_09]: There's always gonna be that guy on the internet.

01:37:10.751 --> 01:37:14.153
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, you look like you're about to just... I hate people.

01:37:14.333 --> 01:37:15.834
[SPEAKER_09]: You're doing the SMH thing over there.

01:37:16.975 --> 01:37:17.375
[SPEAKER_09]: SMH?

01:37:17.896 --> 01:37:18.496
[SPEAKER_09]: Shake my head.

01:37:19.116 --> 01:37:20.537
[SPEAKER_09]: Or SMGDH.

01:37:20.577 --> 01:37:21.698
[SPEAKER_09]: Shake my goddamn head.

01:37:21.718 --> 01:37:22.659
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't get people.

01:37:23.239 --> 01:37:24.700
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't, so it's fine.

01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:27.161
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here we are talking about it, so maybe the troll won.

01:37:27.281 --> 01:37:27.722
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:37:28.082 --> 01:37:28.682
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, fuck them.

01:37:28.782 --> 01:37:29.783
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an attention grab.

01:37:29.903 --> 01:37:30.423
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing more.

01:37:31.084 --> 01:37:35.086
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know somebody's going to get this and be all... You know who's attention is going to grab?

01:37:35.226 --> 01:37:35.847
[SPEAKER_07]: Fox News.

01:37:36.314 --> 01:37:41.398
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I like to file this stuff under the banner of no one care.

01:37:42.899 --> 01:37:44.020
[SPEAKER_09]: No one important.

01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:54.848
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, somebody did point out, this came out one day after the NRA had put out their own gun game, NRA Practice Range, which is available on the iOS.

01:37:55.368 --> 01:37:57.410
[SPEAKER_09]: It is rated for ages 4 and up.

01:37:58.795 --> 01:37:59.896
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, that's all Target.

01:37:59.956 --> 01:38:00.836
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Target practice.

01:38:01.456 --> 01:38:02.737
[SPEAKER_09]: Target practice, so it's okay.

01:38:03.398 --> 01:38:04.098
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's a question.

01:38:04.378 --> 01:38:08.260
[SPEAKER_09]: I know this is rapid-fire news, and I'm not going very rapidly, but there's a lot to say about this stuff.

01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:10.561
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you let a four-year-old play point-blank?

01:38:14.283 --> 01:38:17.925
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a gun game, but it's carnival guns.

01:38:18.426 --> 01:38:26.350
[SPEAKER_05]: This is where my stance is with this, is that if I were a parent, I wouldn't let a child watch TV until they were older than five.

01:38:27.858 --> 01:38:30.619
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck with that.

01:38:30.819 --> 01:38:31.580
[SPEAKER_07]: That was our plan.

01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:32.380
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't happen.

01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:34.540
[SPEAKER_05]: I know plenty of parents who have been very successful with it.

01:38:36.101 --> 01:38:47.265
[SPEAKER_05]: I come for that just because I've seen the difference in behavior with Becky's son when he's allowed to play games and watch TV versus when he's limited access to playing games and watching TV.

01:38:47.345 --> 01:38:51.566
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a lot happier of a kid when he gets to go outside and play more often.

01:38:52.186 --> 01:39:03.191
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't think I would allow, if I were a parent, I wouldn't allow TV or video games until they were old enough to actually have more of a comprehension factor attached to it.

01:39:03.931 --> 01:39:04.411
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just me.

01:39:05.712 --> 01:39:07.092
[SPEAKER_05]: And I certainly wouldn't let it be a babysitter.

01:39:09.198 --> 01:39:10.799
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on to some more rapid fire news.

01:39:10.839 --> 01:39:12.599
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:16.581
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know how people were a little excited about Epic Mickey 2?

01:39:16.981 --> 01:39:26.165
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they were only a little excited because they only sold 270,000 copies in North America, which is about, oh, a million less than the first one did.

01:39:26.785 --> 01:39:28.506
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the first one sold 1.3 million.

01:39:29.106 --> 01:39:30.026
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, not even close.

01:39:30.646 --> 01:39:31.087
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

01:39:31.727 --> 01:39:35.748
[SPEAKER_05]: And the creator thinks they're going to do more, so that would be great when Disney shuts them down.

01:39:37.049 --> 01:39:37.149
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

01:39:38.709 --> 01:39:44.571
[SPEAKER_05]: Now there's also six weeks of free PS Mobile games.

01:39:44.671 --> 01:39:47.132
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be starting with Samurai Beatdown.

01:39:48.312 --> 01:39:55.155
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get that on the PlayStation Store, and it's either for Vita or PlayStation certified mobile devices.

01:39:56.155 --> 01:40:02.017
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's only going to be available in Japan, US, UK, Canada, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Australia.

01:40:02.437 --> 01:40:04.178
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you live in Zimbabwe, you're fucked.

01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:31.207
[SPEAKER_05]: and then for fans of Shin Megami Tensei Devil Summoner Soul Hackers is going to be out in the US in April it's been set to release on 16th of April and nothing about our friends in the UK if they're going to see anything but who knows it's also a 3DS remake of the one that came out in the Sega Saturn in 1997 done

01:40:35.359 --> 01:40:38.961
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, how about we go to the Fugle question of the week?

01:40:39.021 --> 01:40:39.601
[SPEAKER_05]: How about we?

01:40:39.941 --> 01:40:40.481
[SPEAKER_09]: How about it?

01:40:40.601 --> 01:40:41.302
[SPEAKER_05]: How about it, huh?

01:40:49.645 --> 01:40:58.429
[SPEAKER_09]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio Google Plus at Orange Lounge Radio Put them together, you get Fugle Here's our Fugle question of the week

01:40:59.113 --> 01:41:01.215
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't talk about this story tonight but I guess we will now.

01:41:01.495 --> 01:41:06.199
[SPEAKER_09]: A settlement was reached this week between the actor that portrayed Kevin Butler and Sony.

01:41:06.639 --> 01:41:11.883
[SPEAKER_09]: You may recall that the actor was spotted in a commercial for a tire store playing a Nintendo Wii.

01:41:12.284 --> 01:41:14.165
[SPEAKER_09]: This got us thinking about commercials and marketing.

01:41:14.365 --> 01:41:16.127
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really all there is to say on that story.

01:41:16.447 --> 01:41:17.988
[SPEAKER_09]: Legal issues settled out of court.

01:41:18.048 --> 01:41:18.689
[SPEAKER_09]: What else is new?

01:41:20.990 --> 01:41:27.714
[SPEAKER_09]: But since it got us thinking about commercials and marketing and like how big of an impact does somebody like Kevin Butler really have?

01:41:27.734 --> 01:41:36.259
[SPEAKER_09]: So we went to Fugle and we asked the listeners, has a gaming system, game commercial or advertising campaign ever worked on you?

01:41:36.659 --> 01:41:39.501
[SPEAKER_09]: Where it swayed you to make the decision to buy a game new?

01:41:40.101 --> 01:41:45.124
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it something you experienced more in your youth or something you still find might tilt your opinion today?

01:41:45.444 --> 01:41:46.846
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that can happen now.

01:42:03.064 --> 01:42:03.985
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw on Facebook

01:42:21.924 --> 01:42:26.548
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen many commercials for the latest gaming consoles, and neither one has swayed me into buying one.

01:42:26.628 --> 01:42:33.433
[SPEAKER_09]: I always believe the only way to make a decision whether to buy the console or not is to actually try it, like the kiosks at the stores.

01:42:34.254 --> 01:42:38.798
[SPEAKER_09]: Ragenator says, as a kid in the early 80s, before I became as jaded as I am today, yeah.

01:42:38.958 --> 01:42:43.522
[SPEAKER_09]: But then again, commercials that were our marketing towards young kids typically work.

01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:46.281
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted one of those things so badly as a kid.

01:43:14.349 --> 01:43:16.030
[SPEAKER_09]: You were a kid when the N-Gage came out.

01:43:16.170 --> 01:43:16.791
[SPEAKER_09]: I was in my 20s.

01:43:16.811 --> 01:43:18.132
[SPEAKER_07]: There's commercials for the Ouya?

01:43:18.952 --> 01:43:20.993
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I didn't know there were commercials for the Ouya.

01:43:21.174 --> 01:43:22.334
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that maybe online?

01:43:23.775 --> 01:43:25.456
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there's commercials for the Ouya at all.

01:43:26.157 --> 01:43:27.558
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if he meant to say the Wii.

01:43:28.698 --> 01:43:29.279
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably.

01:43:29.859 --> 01:43:33.502
[SPEAKER_09]: Because people were uneducated about it and then the ads for it got a mountain of people excited?

01:43:33.602 --> 01:43:33.902
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:43:37.019 --> 01:43:40.620
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkTetsuya said, I did go to see The Wizard when I heard Super Mario Bros.

01:43:40.881 --> 01:43:41.821
[SPEAKER_09]: 3 was going to debut in it.

01:43:41.861 --> 01:43:42.541
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that count?

01:43:43.102 --> 01:43:46.864
[SPEAKER_09]: That was like the best product placement ever done in the history of ever.

01:43:47.124 --> 01:43:50.906
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I have to admit that I was interested.

01:43:50.966 --> 01:43:56.809
[SPEAKER_09]: Who didn't get a gigantic nerd boner when they went and saw The Wizard and saw Super Mario 3 like the first footage?

01:43:57.669 --> 01:44:00.130
[SPEAKER_09]: There has never been a better promotion, ever.

01:44:00.750 --> 01:44:01.690
[SPEAKER_09]: I firmly believe that.

01:44:01.750 --> 01:44:06.292
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Power Glove, which, by the way, I'm sorry, the Power Glove was a piece of shit.

01:44:06.672 --> 01:44:07.552
[SPEAKER_09]: It really was.

01:44:07.912 --> 01:44:08.832
[SPEAKER_09]: It was so shitty.

01:44:09.133 --> 01:44:12.193
[SPEAKER_09]: That and the U-Force were both shittacular shit diversions.

01:44:12.213 --> 01:44:13.894
[SPEAKER_07]: I already had a Power Glove when I saw that movie.

01:44:13.914 --> 01:44:14.794
[SPEAKER_09]: And wasn't it shit?

01:44:14.954 --> 01:44:15.574
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it was.

01:44:15.735 --> 01:44:17.135
[SPEAKER_07]: It was absolute fucking shit.

01:44:17.555 --> 01:44:19.757
[SPEAKER_09]: But, it's so bad.

01:44:20.678 --> 01:44:23.941
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like, this is cool, except, wait, I can't do shit with this.

01:44:23.961 --> 01:44:29.407
[SPEAKER_09]: You see the U-Force in the little print ad, like, playing Punch-Out, and you think, oh my god.

01:44:30.227 --> 01:44:31.689
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo, bring back the Power Glove.

01:44:31.729 --> 01:44:33.711
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, that would be fucking awesome.

01:44:34.732 --> 01:44:35.833
[SPEAKER_07]: If it worked right.

01:44:37.463 --> 01:44:40.106
[SPEAKER_07]: When they have haptic gloves, they need to have the power glove come back.

01:44:41.307 --> 01:44:45.010
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the listeners are going to hate me for this, but you know how we always say time to penis?

01:44:45.090 --> 01:44:47.533
[SPEAKER_09]: My concern with the power glove is time to fist.

01:44:49.655 --> 01:44:50.235
[SPEAKER_05]: We know.

01:44:53.298 --> 01:44:54.099
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so bad.

01:44:54.359 --> 01:44:55.581
[SPEAKER_07]: It's ripped for her pleasure.

01:44:58.123 --> 01:45:02.224
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to a comment from Burr.

01:45:04.365 --> 01:45:15.528
[SPEAKER_09]: Burr says, you know what, it was the Kevin Butler ads along with the price cut that came with the release of the Slim that actually did help sway my opinion on the PlayStation 3 and finally got me to pick one up.

01:45:16.349 --> 01:45:20.970
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, it was the moment that Sony finally meant business and let the games do the talking.

01:45:21.330 --> 01:45:26.252
[SPEAKER_09]: The original PlayStation 3 ads were way too obscure and stupid by contrast.

01:45:27.111 --> 01:45:29.052
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like when you let hipsters do commercials.

01:45:30.673 --> 01:45:36.956
[SPEAKER_09]: Veronica S. replied and said, The very first Pokemon commercial that aired on TV caused me to buy Pokemon Blue version.

01:45:37.096 --> 01:45:38.197
[SPEAKER_09]: I was 11 years old.

01:45:38.917 --> 01:45:42.419
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the Pokemon cartoon was a pretty great tie-in.

01:45:42.459 --> 01:45:43.399
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Pokemon movie?

01:45:44.139 --> 01:45:44.700
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

01:45:46.281 --> 01:45:46.581
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

01:45:46.641 --> 01:45:50.302
[SPEAKER_09]: Acidic Vampire says, Have you seen the Wii U launch commercial?

01:45:50.643 --> 01:45:51.143
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell no.

01:45:53.584 --> 01:45:54.925
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:46:20.841 --> 01:46:26.904
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Janai says, kiosks and store demos are the most helpful for my buying decisions.

01:46:27.864 --> 01:46:32.747
[SPEAKER_09]: Steven M replied and said, the early Xbox promos for Kinect really got me excited to buy one.

01:46:33.547 --> 01:46:37.729
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkCharger said, in my youth, I was probably swayed by many video game commercials.

01:46:37.849 --> 01:46:42.331
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, who could forget the commercial like Journey for the Atari 2600?

01:46:43.031 --> 01:46:46.253
[SPEAKER_09]: And he actually embedded the commercial here for us to watch.

01:46:49.961 --> 01:46:53.583
[SPEAKER_03]: Data Age presents the world's first rock video game, Journey Escape.

01:46:54.083 --> 01:46:54.763
[SPEAKER_03]: The concert's over.

01:46:54.783 --> 01:47:09.651
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you must help each member of Journey Escape through mobs of love-crazed groupies, shifty-eyed promoters, photographers, find your roadies and manager, and run for the escape vehicle and live to rock another day.

01:47:12.472 --> 01:47:15.293
[SPEAKER_03]: Journey Escape for the Atari 2600 from Data Age.

01:47:16.174 --> 01:47:16.674
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

01:47:17.614 --> 01:47:19.235
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck Journey from last year.

01:47:20.496 --> 01:47:21.816
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the true Journey.

01:47:23.577 --> 01:47:26.279
[SPEAKER_09]: I regret putting Journey on my Games of the Year list.

01:47:26.339 --> 01:47:30.281
[SPEAKER_09]: This just reminded me that there will only be one video game named Journey.

01:47:31.302 --> 01:47:31.902
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm teasing.

01:47:32.602 --> 01:47:32.942
[SPEAKER_09]: Mostly.

01:47:33.483 --> 01:47:34.803
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anyhow.

01:47:35.724 --> 01:47:36.805
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkCharger went on and said,

01:47:44.929 --> 01:47:45.189
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

01:48:03.567 --> 01:48:05.228
[SPEAKER_09]: We need you guys to create a viral video.

01:48:30.656 --> 01:48:38.785
[SPEAKER_09]: and I was interested in buying Dishonored but after seeing the trailer a million times before the game launched thanks to The Escapist and PATV I decided to pass on the game.

01:48:39.506 --> 01:48:40.147
[SPEAKER_04]: Just do what I do.

01:48:40.207 --> 01:48:40.968
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop watching TV.

01:48:41.648 --> 01:48:43.270
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, these are web shows though.

01:48:43.290 --> 01:48:44.471
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop watching TV web shows.

01:48:45.112 --> 01:48:45.673
[SPEAKER_04]: Use Adblock.

01:48:47.674 --> 01:48:52.157
[SPEAKER_09]: I will admit though, a lot of online sites can only seem to ever find one sponsor.

01:48:52.417 --> 01:48:55.539
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan and I always pick the commercials for Hulu that talk about like food.

01:48:57.780 --> 01:49:04.464
[SPEAKER_09]: I like this approach that, I hope I pronounce this correctly, Shea C said, define advertising.

01:49:04.844 --> 01:49:09.367
[SPEAKER_09]: Were things like the Super Mario Brothers Super Show or the Sonic cartoon ads for a specific game?

01:49:09.667 --> 01:49:10.167
[SPEAKER_09]: Not really.

01:49:10.508 --> 01:49:15.450
[SPEAKER_09]: Were they media which kept the franchise visible, popular, and made us kids excited for the next game installment?

01:49:15.530 --> 01:49:15.911
[SPEAKER_09]: You bet.

01:49:16.471 --> 01:49:22.753
[SPEAKER_09]: Before the internet, gasp, TV ads, friends, and kiosks were the only way you'd actually see gameplay before getting it yourself.

01:49:23.193 --> 01:49:25.314
[SPEAKER_09]: Magazines had reviews, but you'd only get stills.

01:49:25.734 --> 01:49:27.935
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we've got trailers on demand and tons of review sites.

01:49:27.975 --> 01:49:31.576
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like consumers are pulling information more than is being pushed to them.

01:49:32.017 --> 01:49:37.418
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing they really need to nail with traditional advertising these days is making sure people know the title.

01:49:37.839 --> 01:49:38.699
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting perspective.

01:49:38.719 --> 01:49:41.200
[SPEAKER_09]: We were going down that line a little bit and talking about The Wizard and stuff.

01:49:42.100 --> 01:49:52.058
[SPEAKER_09]: Degenerate Johnny said The only time I actually bought a console based on its advertisement alone was Tiger's Gamecom The commercial made the mobile gaming device as the shit

01:49:52.811 --> 01:49:58.874
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, the little person's insulting remarks came off as insulting to the gaming community, but I recognized its satire.

01:49:59.215 --> 01:50:02.556
[SPEAKER_09]: Not to mention it was pretty funny seeing the little guy get tossed around at the end of the ad.

01:50:02.897 --> 01:50:04.958
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I'm fortunate to see that the device failed.

01:50:05.058 --> 01:50:06.038
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, that thing failed.

01:50:06.358 --> 01:50:11.161
[SPEAKER_09]: Since it had many features that were quite innovative for the late 90s, such as touchscreen controls and internet access.

01:50:11.581 --> 01:50:15.824
[SPEAKER_09]: It goes to show that one must be mindful of its market if it hopes to make the product a success.

01:50:16.684 --> 01:50:18.305
[SPEAKER_09]: And lastly, SHA100Matt says,

01:50:40.860 --> 01:50:45.564
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the first time I ever got a real look at the graphics and games in action so I was immediately blown away.

01:50:46.064 --> 01:50:48.426
[SPEAKER_09]: After that point I saved up my money and got the system at launch.

01:50:48.706 --> 01:50:53.169
[SPEAKER_09]: I never realized that they'd sent out videos like that.

01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:54.010
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of neat.

01:50:55.785 --> 01:51:00.829
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if they were those really cheap cardboard tape things that could really fuck up your VCR if you used it wrong.

01:51:01.609 --> 01:51:01.929
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:05.532
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, we have not yet gone to Google+.

01:51:05.612 --> 01:51:06.953
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me quickly get through Google+.

01:51:07.013 --> 01:51:10.915
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft said, I would say that back in the 80s and 90s it worked.

01:51:11.296 --> 01:51:18.060
[SPEAKER_09]: We got smothered with over-the-top, in-your-face advertisement back then and it probably got us to buy or ask our parents to get us a video game.

01:51:18.561 --> 01:51:22.944
[SPEAKER_09]: But now, a lot of commercials for games are really bland and don't capture your attention that much.

01:51:24.413 --> 01:51:30.518
[SPEAKER_09]: Critical Myth said, I can't say there was a commercial that did that for me, but print ads have convinced me more than a couple times.

01:51:31.078 --> 01:51:32.960
[SPEAKER_09]: One I remember well was Xena Saga 2.

01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:35.501
[SPEAKER_09]: Cosmos had me at, hello.

01:51:37.823 --> 01:51:43.347
[SPEAKER_09]: Maiko says, as much as I want to say no, it's the quality of the games that does it for me, like it did for the Dreamcast.

01:51:43.687 --> 01:51:46.670
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to say yes if the Ouya counts, because I'm an idiot.

01:51:46.970 --> 01:51:48.711
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so I guess there are Ouya commercials.

01:51:48.791 --> 01:51:49.392
[SPEAKER_09]: What am I missing?

01:51:49.972 --> 01:51:52.534
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there... Because that's the second person to say there are Ouya commercials.

01:51:53.294 --> 01:51:54.255
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have just not seen one.

01:51:54.935 --> 01:51:56.256
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's take a look here.

01:51:56.716 --> 01:51:57.557
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob's on the hunt.

01:51:57.937 --> 01:52:02.780
[SPEAKER_09]: Shane is adding that those videos were real VHS tapes and they were fantastic.

01:52:07.063 --> 01:52:07.743
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be damned.

01:52:07.824 --> 01:52:09.965
[SPEAKER_09]: There is an... Oh no, that says fan-made.

01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:15.203
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if it's the Kickstarter ad these guys are referring to.

01:52:15.223 --> 01:52:16.624
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably the Kickstarter video that they had.

01:52:16.644 --> 01:52:17.405
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet that's what it is.

01:52:17.465 --> 01:52:19.486
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like the modern type of ad.

01:52:19.726 --> 01:52:20.167
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

01:52:23.209 --> 01:52:23.569
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

01:52:24.410 --> 01:52:31.975
[SPEAKER_09]: E3VL says, "...advertising campaigns worked on me in my youth due to the limited social media exposure, magazines, TV, and radio.

01:52:32.376 --> 01:52:40.402
[SPEAKER_09]: Now with the internet involved, ads are everywhere and it's second nature to ignore them or it becomes background noise with the instant impulse hit the X or skip button when it's available."

01:52:40.922 --> 01:53:10.134
[SPEAKER_09]: also now that I purchase things with my own money instead of my parents I tend to do research before purchasing and ads are just a way to get me curious about coming trends instead of impulse buys or begging for the blast processing for Christmas slash birthday and lastly Techie Q says no today's ads campaigns to sway me has less effect on me now thanks to internet but it did sway me more during the Super Nintendo era of gaming those early Super Mario World and Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past commercials swayed me hard to get a Super Nintendo

01:53:10.794 --> 01:53:12.455
[SPEAKER_09]: Good answers tonight and good reminiscing

01:53:32.060 --> 01:53:35.922
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news for the week.

01:53:35.962 --> 01:53:38.664
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you to everybody on Facebook and Google for answering the question.

01:53:38.784 --> 01:53:39.044
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

01:53:39.404 --> 01:53:46.748
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so we've been talking about it and I'm sure you guys have no idea what Disney Infinity is even though we've been talking about it for months now.

01:53:47.729 --> 01:53:49.390
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably months longer than everybody else, but...

01:53:49.830 --> 01:54:16.621
[SPEAKER_07]: Disney Infinity finally got announced this week and basically it's this cool combination of like toys and a little base that you put them on and games and then they have this toy box mode so basically what kind of makes it different than Skylanders is it's not just one single I mean it is they have the toy box mode where you can kind of take all these toys and build your own world out of it which is kind of cool and

01:54:18.322 --> 01:54:23.885
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not some single game that you have to buy characters for to unlock all the parts of the game.

01:54:24.005 --> 01:54:25.626
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really the main thing.

01:54:25.686 --> 01:54:30.869
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby was being funny on Twitter and saying, so is this something that I can like now?

01:54:31.810 --> 01:54:33.411
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you giving me permission to like this?

01:54:33.471 --> 01:54:35.912
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you gave everybody crap about Skylanders.

01:54:36.372 --> 01:54:42.075
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I say it's a little bit different because each individual character and playset or whatever is its own thing.

01:54:42.315 --> 01:54:50.378
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not necessarily like, oh, I have to buy Captain Jack Sparrow to get to this one part of the Monsters, Inc.

01:54:50.398 --> 01:54:51.279
[SPEAKER_07]: world or something like that.

01:54:51.679 --> 01:54:52.419
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like that at all.

01:54:52.459 --> 01:54:55.701
[SPEAKER_07]: Each thing is its own game, and then what kind of ties them all together is the...

01:54:56.801 --> 01:55:00.042
[SPEAKER_07]: Toybox mode where you can build wherever the fuck you want.

01:55:00.442 --> 01:55:02.323
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've got racing stuff in there.

01:55:02.343 --> 01:55:05.144
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like they're combining a little bit of the LittleBigPlanet stuff.

01:55:05.424 --> 01:55:13.026
[SPEAKER_07]: You can set your camera at certain spots so you can do a 2D platformer or you can make a racing game or you can just do whatever.

01:55:13.247 --> 01:55:15.307
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can share these all around the world.

01:55:15.407 --> 01:55:16.748
[SPEAKER_07]: And it sounds like they're going to have...

01:55:17.788 --> 01:55:19.368
[SPEAKER_07]: I think DLC you could buy for it.

01:55:19.388 --> 01:55:20.729
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to have actual toys.

01:55:20.769 --> 01:55:23.729
[SPEAKER_07]: The toys are like $12 each for each individual character.

01:55:24.109 --> 01:55:31.931
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get play sets that are like $35, which are going to include a few characters and a world, as well as some different power-ups and stuff.

01:55:33.312 --> 01:55:35.792
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk about total fan service on a lot of stuff.

01:55:36.112 --> 01:55:38.013
[SPEAKER_07]: The game itself actually comes with three worlds.

01:55:38.113 --> 01:55:39.313
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Monsters University...

01:55:40.173 --> 01:55:53.697
[SPEAKER_07]: The Incredibles and Pirates of the Caribbean and they've got Captain Jack Sparrow, Mr. Incredible and Sully from Monsters U and Monsters Inc in that first playset or the first thing they're packing in there for $75.

01:55:53.958 --> 01:55:54.678
[SPEAKER_09]: What a surprise!

01:55:54.778 --> 01:55:55.358
[SPEAKER_09]: I had no idea.

01:55:56.570 --> 01:55:56.750
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

01:55:57.331 --> 01:55:59.712
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, let's see what else.

01:56:00.293 --> 01:56:03.895
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, they've got Tron, at least some hints of Tron in there.

01:56:04.116 --> 01:56:05.777
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've got other characters.

01:56:05.957 --> 01:56:10.800
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually, I think I posted a few things on there, like different screen grabs and stuff.

01:56:10.900 --> 01:56:11.221
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah.

01:56:12.001 --> 01:56:15.262
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got like Phineas and Ferb is going to be something else that they have on there.

01:56:15.322 --> 01:56:16.062
[SPEAKER_07]: Love Phineas and Ferb.

01:56:16.482 --> 01:56:18.243
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've got, you know, of course.

01:56:18.263 --> 01:56:19.023
[SPEAKER_07]: Jack Skellington.

01:56:19.423 --> 01:56:20.804
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Jack Skellington was in there.

01:56:20.824 --> 01:56:21.544
[SPEAKER_07]: Sign me up for that.

01:56:21.744 --> 01:56:24.945
[SPEAKER_07]: Toy Story, obviously, because that was the kind of the Toy Box moment.

01:56:24.965 --> 01:56:27.406
[SPEAKER_07]: Toy Story 3 is what kind of inspired them to do all this stuff.

01:56:27.546 --> 01:56:27.806
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

01:56:28.226 --> 01:56:30.507
[SPEAKER_07]: And Cars is going to be something else.

01:56:30.827 --> 01:56:32.567
[SPEAKER_07]: And Wreck-It Ralph is in there.

01:56:32.748 --> 01:56:36.909
[SPEAKER_07]: And they even have some hints of like Sugar Rush, which would be pretty cool.

01:56:37.889 --> 01:56:41.571
[SPEAKER_07]: All this stuff is supposed to be coming out.

01:56:41.631 --> 01:56:45.213
[SPEAKER_07]: Frozen is going to have some characters with that when that movie comes out this fall.

01:56:45.714 --> 01:56:48.155
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's a couple problems though.

01:56:48.615 --> 01:56:52.978
[SPEAKER_09]: The Disney nerd in me wants to go all in on this shit.

01:56:53.338 --> 01:56:56.960
[SPEAKER_09]: I collect the pins, which is an expensive hobby.

01:56:58.821 --> 01:57:00.862
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not go to the figurines?

01:57:01.383 --> 01:57:02.463
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's my concern.

01:57:02.704 --> 01:57:04.765
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really worried about the quality of the game.

01:57:05.425 --> 01:57:32.272
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm gonna be honest whether this is a rational reason or not I'm just being I'm keeping it real I'm worried about who's developing it they don't have an established product under their belt Avalanche like a lot of the stuff they put out have been kiddie games Toy Story 3 obviously was them too and if you look at what they did before Disney picked them up they did a lot of bad games like Sub-Zero Mythologies and all that now granted

01:57:32.972 --> 01:57:38.637
[SPEAKER_09]: We all make mistakes and we should give them a chance that maybe this is something that will break through, but I'm concerned.

01:57:42.075 --> 01:57:46.658
[SPEAKER_09]: The gameplay footage didn't really make me go, you know?

01:57:47.198 --> 01:57:48.219
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't lose my shit.

01:57:48.699 --> 01:57:50.360
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, did you watch any of the interview videos?

01:57:50.380 --> 01:57:52.061
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually had more in-depth gameplay stuff.

01:57:52.121 --> 01:57:52.961
[SPEAKER_07]: To be fair, no.

01:57:52.981 --> 01:57:56.503
[SPEAKER_09]: I only watched the common trailer that was out there.

01:57:56.523 --> 01:57:56.884
[SPEAKER_07]: It looked okay.

01:57:56.904 --> 01:58:01.786
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's not like, you know, none of this is really making me go, oh, I gotta pick that up.

01:58:01.827 --> 01:58:06.529
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the toy box mode sounds really cool, but once again, I was kind of even thinking about it.

01:58:06.549 --> 01:58:07.350
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, do I even...

01:58:08.050 --> 01:58:08.570
[SPEAKER_07]: Warhammer Disney K

01:58:30.657 --> 01:58:31.658
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's just so cool.

01:58:31.698 --> 01:58:34.841
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd have to see what stuff comes out and how it gets priced.

01:58:36.202 --> 01:58:42.246
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's going to sell really well, and the fact that they have this whole kind of synergy where you can build your own world is kind of unique.

01:58:42.366 --> 01:58:42.806
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

01:58:42.887 --> 01:58:47.610
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really going to set them apart from Skylanders, because Skylanders is like, you buy a bunch of characters, you play one game.

01:58:48.291 --> 01:58:49.612
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a dungeon crawler, and that's it.

01:58:49.872 --> 01:58:53.094
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas this, they could have multiple game types.

01:58:53.134 --> 01:58:56.897
[SPEAKER_07]: They could have, you know, this is going to be a racing game, this is going to be an adventure game, whatever.

01:58:57.097 --> 01:59:02.780
[SPEAKER_09]: Something to remember about those little RFIDs too is that they don't just, you know, they're not just chips that transmit data.

01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:03.761
[SPEAKER_09]: They can save data.

01:59:03.921 --> 01:59:04.121
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

01:59:04.201 --> 01:59:05.521
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a limited amount, right?

01:59:05.601 --> 01:59:06.122
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a little bit.

01:59:06.422 --> 01:59:09.704
[SPEAKER_09]: But maybe enough so that you could bring with you a level design.

01:59:10.064 --> 01:59:10.264
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

01:59:10.744 --> 01:59:11.004
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

01:59:12.025 --> 01:59:14.346
[SPEAKER_07]: Or at least you can share those on the internet, apparently.

01:59:14.606 --> 01:59:17.808
[SPEAKER_07]: Like with other people and play their creations or invite your friends over.

01:59:17.848 --> 01:59:20.449
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do four-player co-op over the internet.

01:59:20.469 --> 01:59:23.571
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:59:24.870 --> 01:59:25.210
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:59:25.551 --> 01:59:28.434
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I'll wait until a little closer, look at some of the reviews.

01:59:28.474 --> 01:59:32.418
[SPEAKER_09]: There's that part of me that's like, must have all figurines, must have them all.

01:59:33.179 --> 01:59:34.721
[SPEAKER_09]: The figurines look cool.

01:59:34.961 --> 01:59:36.903
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw pictures of them.

01:59:37.504 --> 01:59:38.125
[SPEAKER_07]: They're well done.

01:59:39.460 --> 01:59:44.122
[SPEAKER_07]: And here's the thing, too, that I'm not too positive on, but it looks like they articulate.

01:59:44.203 --> 01:59:55.047
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like the arms, at least they've got seams on the arms where it looks like they could move, limited at least, but that's more than Skylanders can, so, you know, that'd be interesting.

01:59:55.067 --> 01:59:58.289
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that why they're going to be more expensive than the figure, or is that just Disney tax?

01:59:58.389 --> 02:00:00.150
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not that much more expensive than Skylanders.

02:00:00.170 --> 02:00:01.110
[SPEAKER_07]: But they are more expensive.

02:00:01.330 --> 02:00:02.391
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they are more expensive.

02:00:02.451 --> 02:00:03.231
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that Disney tax?

02:00:03.611 --> 02:00:04.412
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably Disney tax.

02:00:05.792 --> 02:00:06.273
[SPEAKER_09]: Just curious.

02:00:07.513 --> 02:00:11.497
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well that is definitely the future of gaming, like it or not.

02:00:13.199 --> 02:00:25.030
[SPEAKER_09]: It concerns me though is that if we support Disney Infinity, that we're saying we want more of this, and I really worry about the barrage of knockoffs that this whole Skylander thing is going to cause.

02:00:25.070 --> 02:00:25.690
[SPEAKER_07]: Pokemon.

02:00:26.831 --> 02:00:28.232
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, I was talking to Shane about that.

02:00:28.252 --> 02:00:32.193
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, can you imagine if Nintendo just said, we want to do Pokemon like this?

02:00:32.714 --> 02:00:33.694
[SPEAKER_09]: Shane would have them all.

02:00:33.734 --> 02:00:34.634
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my God.

02:00:34.935 --> 02:00:36.195
[SPEAKER_09]: But he brought up a good point with me.

02:00:36.235 --> 02:00:37.816
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe he'll call in the show later and talk about it.

02:00:37.896 --> 02:00:40.257
[SPEAKER_09]: He said that the creator of Pokemon actually hates DLC.

02:00:41.057 --> 02:00:43.198
[SPEAKER_09]: So, they may not be... But I...

02:00:43.978 --> 02:00:46.601
[SPEAKER_07]: He may hate DLC, but they're going to have DLC in the next Pokemon game.

02:00:48.303 --> 02:00:50.305
[SPEAKER_07]: He may hate it all he wants, but he's not calling a shot.

02:00:50.325 --> 02:00:52.227
[SPEAKER_09]: And they used to do those Burger King toys back in the day.

02:00:52.247 --> 02:00:52.868
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I told him.

02:00:52.908 --> 02:00:55.371
[SPEAKER_09]: I said they used to have little toys for all the Pokemon.

02:00:55.391 --> 02:01:02.698
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine that they will literally have Pokeballs that you put your fucking figurine in that you put it out on...

02:01:03.399 --> 02:01:07.261
[SPEAKER_09]: That was Burger King like 12 years ago.

02:01:07.361 --> 02:01:15.625
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to tell you, after they banned all those Pokeballs, we went to a Burger King and went through the drive-thru 10 times to get more Pokeballs so that we could hang them up on the tree.

02:01:15.645 --> 02:01:16.565
[SPEAKER_05]: So you didn't have to get yourself with them?

02:01:17.106 --> 02:01:19.107
[SPEAKER_05]: No, just so that we could have a pile of Pokeballs.

02:01:19.787 --> 02:01:23.311
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually had a box full of Pokeballs and little Pokemon toys because we wanted all of them.

02:01:24.392 --> 02:01:26.714
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally we're like, wait, this is stupid and gave them all away.

02:01:26.914 --> 02:01:29.336
[SPEAKER_09]: I went as Ash Ketchum one Halloween.

02:01:29.436 --> 02:01:32.740
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you to Burger King for those Pokeballs because they were great for my costume.

02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:41.188
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, and honestly, maybe the other thing that got me psyched about the whole Disney Infinity thing is the fact that they had Nero's me and you in the trailer, which is pretty awesome.

02:01:41.208 --> 02:01:42.089
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, yes!

02:01:43.956 --> 02:01:45.998
[SPEAKER_07]: Arcade Arcade Arcade Arcade Arcade Arcade Arcade

02:02:12.060 --> 02:02:15.822
[SPEAKER_09]: and Darren Spahn, who is the owner of this with his wife, Mickey.

02:02:16.102 --> 02:02:22.884
[SPEAKER_09]: What they're trying to do with this, they want to recreate the experience of arcade gaming saying, quote, people have lost that social experience.

02:02:23.165 --> 02:02:24.925
[SPEAKER_09]: They sit on couches with their Xbox.

02:02:24.945 --> 02:02:26.066
[SPEAKER_09]: They never talk to their kids.

02:02:26.386 --> 02:02:31.608
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to come to a place where you can play together with your kids too and find something that the whole family enjoys.

02:02:32.649 --> 02:02:35.751
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, it should be noted, this place has been around since November of 2010.

02:02:36.532 --> 02:02:47.242
[SPEAKER_09]: It is just making the rounds on the Game Blog this week because of an article that was discovered on Statesman.com, which I'm assuming is kind of like an Austin, so people were able to find it on the internet and kind of figure out more about this place.

02:02:47.642 --> 02:02:53.267
[SPEAKER_09]: But yay to this guy and his wife bringing back the retro arcade stuff.

02:02:53.347 --> 02:02:54.028
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's great.

02:02:55.602 --> 02:03:18.017
[SPEAKER_09]: even the article the original article talks about some games like Missile Command they don't make much money but he keeps them because they're classics and the other thing about the arcade I was looking at the actual website everything in that arcade is for sale so let's say you go in and you're playing Galaga and you're like I want to buy this machine you can buy it so it's almost like a interactive show floor where you could buy the games I think it's kind of awesome

02:03:20.011 --> 02:03:20.391
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

02:03:21.071 --> 02:03:22.092
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll take all of them.

02:03:23.152 --> 02:03:26.753
[SPEAKER_09]: There did seem to be a healthy amount of ticket spitting games, too.

02:03:26.833 --> 02:03:30.714
[SPEAKER_09]: More like the hand-me-down kind of ticket spitting games, like things that were in arcades a few years ago.

02:03:31.474 --> 02:03:32.555
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't go wrong with skee-ball.

02:03:32.715 --> 02:03:33.435
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't love skee-ball.

02:03:33.455 --> 02:03:34.595
[SPEAKER_05]: Skee-ball is amazing.

02:03:34.635 --> 02:03:37.076
[SPEAKER_09]: Press the button to stop the light types of games, you know?

02:03:38.177 --> 02:03:39.637
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the... That's how they throw birthday parties.

02:03:39.657 --> 02:03:40.537
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoke and token.

02:03:41.398 --> 02:03:42.718
[SPEAKER_05]: And spider stomp.

02:03:44.319 --> 02:04:05.654
[SPEAKER_09]: uh apparently a second and third location elsewhere in Austin could be coming this year and you know remember guys he opened this place in November 2010 I mean the economy's been kind of in the shitter in the past couple years yet this place didn't go out of business that's awesome and clearly it's because of the Star Trek backdrop he has there in the arcade that's what keeps that place awesome anyhow

02:04:06.721 --> 02:04:07.381
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a no fear.

02:04:07.742 --> 02:04:09.242
[SPEAKER_05]: You know who else has a no fear?

02:04:09.422 --> 02:04:10.683
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan, right?

02:04:10.963 --> 02:04:11.623
[SPEAKER_05]: We had one.

02:04:12.224 --> 02:04:13.784
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the last table we sold.

02:04:14.085 --> 02:04:21.548
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to have a giant Picard picture on the wall with him saying make it so or something.

02:04:21.788 --> 02:04:22.429
[SPEAKER_07]: Somewhere in there.

02:04:22.449 --> 02:04:23.369
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be pretty awesome.

02:04:26.150 --> 02:04:27.211
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on with more news.

02:04:28.570 --> 02:04:29.691
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, it's my turn, isn't it?

02:04:30.772 --> 02:04:31.593
[SPEAKER_05]: Silly iPad.

02:04:32.273 --> 02:04:37.297
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there is a game coming out by an indie studio called Stab Yourself.

02:04:38.398 --> 02:04:39.399
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the best name ever.

02:04:39.799 --> 02:04:41.321
[SPEAKER_05]: It's stabyourself.net.

02:04:42.362 --> 02:04:47.086
[SPEAKER_05]: They basically recreate 80s games and then apply modern physics to them.

02:04:47.506 --> 02:04:54.312
[SPEAKER_05]: They've done a game called Not Tetris, where basically it's like Game Boy Tetris, except the bricks actually fall with the same momentum a brick really would.

02:04:55.072 --> 02:04:55.772
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario, M-A-R-I-Zero

02:05:20.806 --> 02:05:23.048
[SPEAKER_05]: and the ghosts don't move by themselves either.

02:05:23.088 --> 02:05:25.129
[SPEAKER_05]: They might fall into you as you're turning.

02:05:25.589 --> 02:05:30.433
[SPEAKER_05]: So it applies a new aspect of physics to the game and I need this in my life.

02:05:30.493 --> 02:05:32.794
[SPEAKER_09]: That is actually badass, I've got to say.

02:05:33.034 --> 02:05:35.176
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a really smart innovation.

02:05:35.956 --> 02:05:41.000
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, it's stab yourself with love and good ideas is what they talk about in the name.

02:05:41.080 --> 02:05:42.481
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stab yourself with innovation.

02:05:42.681 --> 02:05:43.561
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, exactly.

02:05:43.741 --> 02:05:45.262
[SPEAKER_05]: It's stabyourself.net.

02:05:45.743 --> 02:05:46.303
[SPEAKER_05]: Go get it.

02:05:46.523 --> 02:05:46.924
[SPEAKER_05]: I want it.

02:05:47.144 --> 02:05:47.724
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to get it.

02:05:48.625 --> 02:05:50.506
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that you can control it with a steering wheel.

02:05:50.986 --> 02:05:51.727
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally did.

02:05:51.747 --> 02:05:54.608
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, we've got Dan's steering wheel rig.

02:05:55.169 --> 02:05:55.989
[SPEAKER_05]: We could totally do that.

02:05:56.049 --> 02:05:56.970
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, no, no.

02:05:57.450 --> 02:05:58.591
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I have to add something.

02:05:58.711 --> 02:06:00.352
[SPEAKER_05]: Rewind back into the gaming week.

02:06:00.832 --> 02:06:02.393
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what my husband is doing tonight?

02:06:03.514 --> 02:06:08.617
[SPEAKER_05]: He is building himself a three monitor rig just for playing Gran Turismo and Outrun.

02:06:10.427 --> 02:06:10.987
[SPEAKER_05]: My husband!

02:06:11.228 --> 02:06:13.149
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't realize OutRun used three monitors.

02:06:13.809 --> 02:06:14.009
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:16.231
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the old OutRun or the new OutRun?

02:06:16.271 --> 02:06:16.831
[SPEAKER_05]: The newer ones.

02:06:17.892 --> 02:06:24.296
[SPEAKER_05]: He's basically building the rig so he can hook up his PC to do full three-screen gaming.

02:06:24.797 --> 02:06:30.641
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if you're going to do something like that with an Xbox or a PS3, you actually have to have other systems, like multiple systems to get it to run.

02:06:30.661 --> 02:06:33.422
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know Gran Turismo, you need like three systems, three monitors.

02:06:33.562 --> 02:06:40.187
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but he's doing something so that he can play all of the PC-based games with three monitors.

02:06:40.567 --> 02:06:43.109
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:07:01.385 --> 02:07:27.448
[SPEAKER_07]: um apparently the whole thing was that Wildman's Kickstarter needed to actually it needs to earn that money because otherwise they're gonna they would have had to lay everyone off anyways without um any of their like paid time off and stuff cashed out and any of the benefits or severances and stuff um and uh right now I think I'm actually gonna check to see how their Kickstarter is doing um

02:07:29.977 --> 02:07:31.218
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

02:07:50.793 --> 02:07:54.477
[SPEAKER_07]: and unfortunately it's just bad timing I guess.

02:07:54.677 --> 02:08:00.302
[SPEAKER_07]: They just had to lay them off now so they have money to actually do that.

02:08:00.342 --> 02:08:04.166
[SPEAKER_07]: They're still operating but it's way slimmed down.

02:08:04.386 --> 02:08:09.831
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, pretty much everybody's gone except for the head of the studio and I think a couple people.

02:08:11.796 --> 02:08:13.539
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of going to suck.

02:08:14.340 --> 02:08:21.111
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing too is Codemasters has laid off 80 people as well and they're restructuring.

02:08:21.692 --> 02:08:26.379
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, there's three companies tonight that are having major, major problems.

02:08:26.604 --> 02:08:27.684
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

02:08:27.804 --> 02:08:37.428
[SPEAKER_07]: Codemasters, really, they don't have... I mean, they have had some okay games come out, but a lot of their stuff recently hasn't done terribly well.

02:08:37.528 --> 02:08:38.569
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say... I'm trying to think.

02:08:38.969 --> 02:08:42.690
[SPEAKER_07]: Dirt 3 was the last game I remember them having put out.

02:08:42.750 --> 02:08:52.214
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they have Grid 2 coming, and also their Formula 1 title didn't do terribly well, and I don't think their Formula 1 kart racing game did terribly well either.

02:08:53.634 --> 02:08:54.455
[SPEAKER_07]: So that kind of sucks.

02:08:54.875 --> 02:08:56.837
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they can make something other than racing games.

02:08:59.299 --> 02:09:00.800
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they tried that and it wasn't terribly well.

02:09:00.820 --> 02:09:05.003
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, but what's worked for them, like Dirt was one of their biggest games.

02:09:05.564 --> 02:09:06.344
[SPEAKER_07]: Grid looked pretty cool.

02:09:06.364 --> 02:09:07.205
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Grid too.

02:09:07.265 --> 02:09:09.807
[SPEAKER_07]: Grid too, so I'm looking forward to see what that looks like.

02:09:10.668 --> 02:09:15.151
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to see a next-gen Dirt game on the new consoles when they come out.

02:09:15.211 --> 02:09:16.212
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that'd be pretty awesome.

02:09:17.373 --> 02:09:37.502
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd also like to see a next-gen Ridge Racer that doesn't fucking suck Namco you have more time come on not a fucking rehash of what fuck seven or six or how many times what game did they actually have new tracks in was that four four had new tracks in it I mean seriously new Ridge Racer would be awesome

02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:40.741
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, moving on to another story here.

02:09:58.109 --> 02:09:59.350
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

02:10:18.265 --> 02:10:18.926
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.

02:10:35.149 --> 02:10:42.214
[SPEAKER_09]: He announced his retirement on January 17th and the thread has grown to over 170 pages.

02:10:42.915 --> 02:10:51.201
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob Pardo, the chief creative officer at Blizzard, came into the thread saying, "...this thread saddens me greatly.

02:10:51.701 --> 02:11:00.568
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that the Battle.net forums have earned a reputation for rough justice, but I do not believe justice is being served by how people are speaking about Jay's departure from Diablo 3."

02:11:01.989 --> 02:11:02.570
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.com

02:11:18.547 --> 02:11:22.850
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting protective parent kind of attitude going on there.

02:11:22.930 --> 02:11:25.552
[SPEAKER_09]: That's caring about your employees.

02:11:25.612 --> 02:11:27.193
[SPEAKER_09]: That's interesting.

02:11:27.313 --> 02:11:30.936
[SPEAKER_09]: They could hire me now.

02:11:31.236 --> 02:11:33.618
[SPEAKER_09]: If you were the lead designer on Diablo 3, what would you do?

02:11:35.839 --> 02:11:36.199
[SPEAKER_09]: Garrus.

02:11:36.940 --> 02:11:38.481
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I didn't say it.

02:11:38.941 --> 02:11:39.642
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't say it.

02:11:41.483 --> 02:11:44.085
[SPEAKER_05]: I would license out to BioWare to make a Mass Effect MMO.

02:11:45.136 --> 02:11:51.781
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, now he acknowledged also, this is what we're saying, the Diablo community deserves an even better game.

02:11:52.601 --> 02:11:58.625
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a talented team in place and have no intention of stopping work on Diablo 3 until it is the best game in the franchise.

02:11:59.706 --> 02:12:06.330
[SPEAKER_09]: So interestingly, this game is coming up on, what, nine months out and they're still trying to get the game they really want.

02:12:07.759 --> 02:12:09.782
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a weird place we're at in the industry.

02:12:09.842 --> 02:12:14.268
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's not that Diablo 3 is bad, but it was extremely disappointing.

02:12:14.648 --> 02:12:15.730
[SPEAKER_09]: Extremely disappointing.

02:12:15.770 --> 02:12:17.112
[SPEAKER_09]: And Torchlight 2 is kind of better.

02:12:19.927 --> 02:12:22.509
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's open up the mailbag.

02:12:22.549 --> 02:12:24.130
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see what the listeners have to say, shall we?

02:12:26.551 --> 02:12:29.513
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is the place you can email us each week.

02:12:30.114 --> 02:12:35.117
[SPEAKER_09]: And usually, DarkSakura will dive into the email bag headfirst, but not tonight.

02:12:36.337 --> 02:12:41.521
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can tell by my sexy-ass voice tonight, I really don't have much of a voice to do it.

02:12:41.661 --> 02:12:44.162
[SPEAKER_09]: Impersonating your mother earlier probably didn't help that.

02:12:44.202 --> 02:12:44.883
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it didn't.

02:12:44.903 --> 02:12:45.964
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm suffering for that now.

02:12:46.884 --> 02:12:47.705
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what you need?

02:12:47.725 --> 02:12:48.165
[SPEAKER_09]: More coffee.

02:12:48.993 --> 02:12:51.395
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, that's a good idea and I know where you keep it, but I'm not doing it

02:13:09.932 --> 02:13:10.332
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god Oh my god

02:13:30.683 --> 02:13:31.484
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura

02:13:53.661 --> 02:13:57.544
[SPEAKER_09]: This email definitely needs some more Dancer, so let's give him some Dancer.

02:13:57.584 --> 02:13:58.845
[SPEAKER_09]: God damn it, now I can't find Dancer.

02:13:59.746 --> 02:14:10.935
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that was like one of the first Bimani game I actually bought brand new that wasn't a DDR.

02:14:15.330 --> 02:14:19.574
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember how we would all sit around with like little figurines and stand behind people while they played that.

02:14:19.594 --> 02:14:20.034
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the best.

02:14:20.054 --> 02:14:20.855
[SPEAKER_05]: That was absolutely the best.

02:14:20.915 --> 02:14:24.038
[SPEAKER_05]: And then try to parra parra with Last Message.

02:14:24.298 --> 02:14:26.500
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the thing I want to know about this email.

02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:30.804
[SPEAKER_09]: So I actually offline earlier in the week, I wrote back to Plagueis.

02:14:30.844 --> 02:14:32.045
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm waiting to hear back.

02:14:32.085 --> 02:14:33.246
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, yeah, it's us.

02:14:33.546 --> 02:14:34.927
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, long story short.

02:14:34.967 --> 02:14:40.132
[SPEAKER_09]: But my curiosity is I've been searching for an online radio show for a long while now.

02:14:40.572 --> 02:14:50.137
[SPEAKER_09]: and after haphazardly stumbling across this podcast so it's like he was looking for the old show and found this mess instead.

02:14:50.157 --> 02:14:51.778
[SPEAKER_05]: We still have our Bimani love.

02:14:51.838 --> 02:14:53.359
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course we have our Bimani love.

02:14:54.379 --> 02:14:55.860
[SPEAKER_09]: Akira Yamaoka is still God.

02:14:59.562 --> 02:14:59.842
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

02:15:01.403 --> 02:15:02.583
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on with more emails.

02:15:02.683 --> 02:15:06.345
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I do have to say I have a special place in my heart for Desiree.

02:15:07.646 --> 02:15:07.966
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is that?

02:15:08.919 --> 02:15:11.138
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuckin' Desro I love Cobalt

02:15:12.417 --> 02:15:14.738
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to an email from Redertainment.

02:15:14.758 --> 02:15:18.698
[SPEAKER_09]: There is another aspect to the mandatory internet connection issue that's not being brought up.

02:15:40.143 --> 02:15:56.274
[SPEAKER_09]: what if the person playing the game can't connect to the publisher's servers not because of any problem with the consumer or the publisher but because of an ISP's complete and utter fucking incompetence what if due to the ISP being run by morons who think a foresight is something only the uncircumcised deal with

02:15:59.807 --> 02:16:00.288
[SPEAKER_09]: That was good.

02:16:01.128 --> 02:16:07.695
[SPEAKER_09]: The consumer or the publisher cannot connect to one another because of a failure by one or more internet service providers.

02:16:08.036 --> 02:16:14.843
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just one of the reasons why I think of publishers mandating consumers be connected to the internet as a bad idea.

02:16:14.963 --> 02:16:19.528
[SPEAKER_09]: Stay black, redertainment, and yes, I did just come up with the foresight line.

02:16:19.808 --> 02:16:20.169
[SPEAKER_09]: Trainer.

02:16:21.130 --> 02:16:22.351
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that because you always say Garrus?

02:16:23.372 --> 02:16:23.993
[SPEAKER_09]: He says trainer.

02:16:24.293 --> 02:16:24.533
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

02:16:24.553 --> 02:16:25.614
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

02:16:26.275 --> 02:16:29.899
[SPEAKER_09]: So... You notice I haven't said it once during the course of the show.

02:16:29.959 --> 02:16:30.900
[SPEAKER_09]: I've said it like three times now.

02:16:31.261 --> 02:16:36.406
[SPEAKER_09]: Shitty internet service providers being a reason... Well, I mean, you're preaching to the choir, Redertainment.

02:16:36.446 --> 02:16:37.547
[SPEAKER_09]: This shit's a bad idea.

02:16:37.627 --> 02:16:41.432
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're just throwing another ingredient in the pot on why this is a bad idea.

02:16:41.572 --> 02:16:41.812
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean...

02:16:43.374 --> 02:16:46.276
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, we had in the past, the show would drop several times.

02:16:46.596 --> 02:16:54.383
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, maybe that wasn't the ISP's fault necessarily, but, uh, you know, if you have a bad router or something, you know, you're gonna pay for that with your game.

02:16:54.463 --> 02:16:56.124
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, it's ridiculous.

02:16:58.306 --> 02:16:59.807
[SPEAKER_09]: I, I agree with you, Red Entertainment.

02:16:59.847 --> 02:17:00.088
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

02:17:00.568 --> 02:17:01.068
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, sir.

02:17:01.189 --> 02:17:01.429
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

02:17:04.524 --> 02:17:06.585
[SPEAKER_09]: Another email here from AZHP.

02:17:06.925 --> 02:17:07.546
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, OLR.

02:17:07.586 --> 02:17:09.247
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a long one, by the way, but it's a good one.

02:17:09.868 --> 02:17:10.688
[SPEAKER_09]: AZHP here.

02:17:10.748 --> 02:17:12.110
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry in advance for the long email.

02:17:12.230 --> 02:17:12.710
[SPEAKER_09]: You're forgiven.

02:17:13.250 --> 02:17:17.474
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's on two subjects that are really important to me, and I'm sure some of you as well, so I hope you read it.

02:17:17.974 --> 02:17:28.783
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember you guys mentioning the Awesome Games Done Quick Charity Marathon for the Prevent Cancer Foundation on the show last week, and I wanted to give a little more background on it in case anyone was interested in the marathon or the cause.

02:17:29.423 --> 02:17:30.304
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching.

02:17:55.505 --> 02:17:58.191
[SPEAKER_09]: Two-year research grants for cancer research.

02:17:58.271 --> 02:17:59.093
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, job well done.

02:17:59.674 --> 02:18:04.443
[SPEAKER_09]: I had no idea that they had collected all these travelers from around the world.

02:18:05.754 --> 02:18:07.816
[SPEAKER_09]: I had no idea whatsoever that that was the case.

02:18:07.856 --> 02:18:08.657
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you for sharing.

02:18:09.377 --> 02:18:14.222
[SPEAKER_09]: I honestly thought it was like a group of like a college club or something that all was getting together to do it.

02:18:14.362 --> 02:18:16.464
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's really cool.

02:18:17.324 --> 02:18:18.265
[SPEAKER_09]: So props to you guys.

02:18:20.067 --> 02:18:29.095
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you guys said, with all the bad press games have gotten due to recent events, it's really amazing that these people donated their vacation time and money to support this amazing cause.

02:18:29.575 --> 02:18:45.891
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the more impressive runs were Final Fantasy IX done in 9 hours, Super Mario 64, all 120 stars done in under 2 hours by the world record holder Siglemic, Zelda Ocarina of Time done in 23 minutes using some game breaking bugs, and more.

02:18:46.591 --> 02:18:56.041
[SPEAKER_09]: All the games were done in one sitting and it was amazing to watch all week, sometimes during work, and see how amazingly good and consistent people were at these games.

02:18:56.362 --> 02:19:06.412
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't going to donate much originally, but after seeing how passionate these people were about the cause and the games, I eventually donated $80 over the week, though some people donated hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

02:19:07.213 --> 02:19:08.393
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's really adorable.

02:19:08.413 --> 02:19:08.994
[SPEAKER_09]: And it is sad.

02:19:32.581 --> 02:19:33.922
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry for the long email, guys.

02:19:34.143 --> 02:19:34.703
[SPEAKER_09]: You're forgiven.

02:19:34.763 --> 02:19:35.224
[SPEAKER_09]: Good cause.

02:19:35.664 --> 02:19:45.172
[SPEAKER_09]: And in case anyone is interested in watching the marathon videos, you can find them in the features section of speeddemosarchive.com Yours truly, AZHP.

02:19:45.272 --> 02:19:48.015
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I hope it's an even bigger success for them next year.

02:19:48.295 --> 02:19:49.956
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't realize they were bringing all these people in.

02:19:49.977 --> 02:19:51.778
[SPEAKER_09]: They could do an expo out of this shit.

02:19:51.898 --> 02:19:54.340
[SPEAKER_09]: A speedrun expo would be pretty awesome.

02:19:54.380 --> 02:19:55.461
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it would be, actually.

02:19:55.601 --> 02:19:58.404
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, bigger and better next time.

02:19:59.997 --> 02:20:00.438
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.

02:20:01.279 --> 02:20:01.820
[SPEAKER_09]: Good job, guys.

02:20:02.681 --> 02:20:05.545
[SPEAKER_09]: If anybody from that effort is listening, a tip of the hat to you.

02:20:07.088 --> 02:20:11.574
[SPEAKER_09]: Lastly, but not leastly, GamerGirl with an email.

02:20:12.416 --> 02:20:13.918
[SPEAKER_09]: Or as she signed it, GG.

02:20:14.699 --> 02:20:15.560
[SPEAKER_09]: Good game, GamerGirl.

02:20:16.345 --> 02:20:20.126
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear OLR, I first would like to say that if I make any mistakes, i.e.

02:20:20.166 --> 02:20:21.707
[SPEAKER_09]: grammatical errors, I apologize.

02:20:22.087 --> 02:20:24.268
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys, as always, have an amazing show.

02:20:24.548 --> 02:20:25.308
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep up the good work.

02:20:25.568 --> 02:20:29.570
[SPEAKER_09]: I never thought my life would change so drastically with everyone's help.

02:20:30.270 --> 02:20:37.313
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to thinking a lot about how everything good happened to me because of OLR, and it never ceases to amaze me how you guys are always helping everyone.

02:20:37.833 --> 02:20:45.076
[SPEAKER_09]: As a matter of fact, as of January 19, 2013, your very own Dark Tetsuya and Gamer Girl are officially engaged.

02:20:45.936 --> 02:20:46.277
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

02:20:47.258 --> 02:20:48.239
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations.

02:20:49.480 --> 02:20:51.782
[SPEAKER_09]: Another OLR love story for the books, guys.

02:20:51.903 --> 02:20:52.563
[SPEAKER_09]: Well done.

02:20:52.804 --> 02:20:54.145
[SPEAKER_09]: As always, I enjoy the show.

02:20:54.525 --> 02:20:58.310
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks again for introducing me to my best friend and soon-to-be life partner, Gamer Girl.

02:21:00.011 --> 02:21:00.312
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

02:21:02.165 --> 02:21:03.866
[SPEAKER_05]: I happened to see that on Facebook earlier.

02:21:04.087 --> 02:21:15.977
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, I mean, I know we got to say, yeah, I had heard of this before the email came in, but still, just to kind of hear, have it put in that perspective kind of way, like, you know, that they had met through OLR is really like, wow.

02:21:18.539 --> 02:21:21.641
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been blown away with some of the emails and comments from beginning the past couple weeks.

02:21:22.302 --> 02:21:24.504
[SPEAKER_09]: 2013 is the year you're trying to make me cry, y'all.

02:21:25.984 --> 02:21:26.565
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, good job.

02:21:26.885 --> 02:21:34.411
[SPEAKER_09]: Does this mean we have to send over... I don't know where they're getting married or whatever, if it's going to be here or... Because I think they have a distance right now between them.

02:21:34.852 --> 02:21:38.295
[SPEAKER_09]: But I wonder if we need to send along a tape message or something.

02:21:38.315 --> 02:21:39.296
[SPEAKER_09]: Or is that even appropriate?

02:21:39.356 --> 02:21:39.696
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

02:21:41.037 --> 02:21:41.418
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

02:21:41.478 --> 02:21:43.880
[SPEAKER_09]: Get the speed run demo guys at your wedding reception.

02:21:43.920 --> 02:21:45.341
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how you do it.

02:21:45.581 --> 02:21:46.062
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be great.

02:21:47.983 --> 02:21:48.404
[SPEAKER_09]: Good job.

02:21:49.685 --> 02:21:52.848
[SPEAKER_09]: A big congratulations and a perfect way to end the mailbag this week.

02:21:52.888 --> 02:21:55.690
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:21:55.730 --> 02:21:56.671
[SPEAKER_09]: Wowzy, wowzy, wow.

02:21:57.071 --> 02:21:58.553
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for doing the mailbox for me.

02:21:58.893 --> 02:21:59.554
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

02:21:59.974 --> 02:22:02.956
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're going to need to fend for yourself on this upcoming segment.

02:22:04.037 --> 02:22:07.821
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to flip a 180, turn this car around and go from lovey-dovey stuff.

02:22:07.841 --> 02:22:09.142
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to flip this bitch.

02:22:09.222 --> 02:22:12.505
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to flip a bitch right now and get into the bitching.

02:22:27.853 --> 02:22:32.978
[SPEAKER_05]: My FU goes to the old woman who was driving in front of me on my way here.

02:22:35.380 --> 02:22:37.662
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how some people turn into the suicide lane?

02:22:37.722 --> 02:22:38.843
[SPEAKER_05]: You know the turn lane in the middle?

02:22:39.244 --> 02:22:42.667
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this woman doesn't even signal the moment this red truck starts pulling into it.

02:22:42.687 --> 02:22:45.590
[SPEAKER_05]: We're on the inside lane heading toward here.

02:22:46.050 --> 02:22:46.811
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:23:02.566 --> 02:23:04.688
[SPEAKER_05]: And she was just moving back and forth in between lanes.

02:23:04.708 --> 02:23:06.769
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, I'm just going to use both lanes.

02:23:06.809 --> 02:23:07.089
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck.

02:23:07.609 --> 02:23:08.410
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm safer in the middle.

02:23:09.551 --> 02:23:10.692
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, yeah.

02:23:10.872 --> 02:23:13.293
[SPEAKER_05]: Another F you goes to me losing my voice.

02:23:15.014 --> 02:23:19.017
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been fighting off getting sick, and I think I'm over it.

02:23:19.137 --> 02:23:20.698
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just left me with a really sore throat.

02:23:25.617 --> 02:23:29.379
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, DarkTetsuya and GamerGirl, guess what you have to look forward to?

02:23:56.584 --> 02:23:56.784
[SPEAKER_07]: Grab!

02:23:56.804 --> 02:23:56.985
[SPEAKER_07]: Grab!

02:24:14.685 --> 02:24:17.027
[SPEAKER_05]: American Idol's on and this girl is good.

02:24:17.207 --> 02:24:21.790
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, she is over the Nicki Minaj, Mariah thing.

02:24:21.890 --> 02:24:22.751
[SPEAKER_09]: She's over that.

02:24:22.851 --> 02:24:26.133
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I didn't even see that show.

02:24:26.273 --> 02:24:29.435
[SPEAKER_07]: I had no idea because I don't watch cable anymore, even basic TV anymore.

02:24:29.475 --> 02:24:31.717
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, I didn't even know.

02:24:31.857 --> 02:24:33.818
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just crazy that I shouldn't.

02:24:34.338 --> 02:24:35.319
[SPEAKER_09]: I see the billboards.

02:24:35.679 --> 02:24:39.062
[SPEAKER_09]: But, well, in San Francisco, there was a huge one going over the Bay Bridge.

02:24:39.202 --> 02:24:41.023
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so, I mean, that's fine.

02:24:42.782 --> 02:24:44.684
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's see my FUs of the week.

02:24:45.084 --> 02:24:53.471
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been getting, like, weird side pains again, and that always freaks me out because, you know, long-time listeners of the show remember, like, five years ago I was in the hospital because of some of that stuff.

02:24:53.491 --> 02:24:55.653
[SPEAKER_09]: So, like, every time I get side pains, I get, like, really freaked out.

02:24:55.673 --> 02:24:56.754
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, oh, my God, I'm sick again.

02:24:56.814 --> 02:24:57.555
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's gas.

02:24:58.215 --> 02:25:01.518
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, or, like, I'm just gaining weight or something, so...

02:25:02.879 --> 02:25:05.139
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's to hoping it's fat, nothing else.

02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:07.040
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Rob, avoid the Taco Bell.

02:25:07.340 --> 02:25:07.540
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:09.340
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you get for eating Jack in the Box.

02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:10.861
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't eat Jack in the Box.

02:25:11.041 --> 02:25:12.081
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki talked about it.

02:25:12.221 --> 02:25:14.701
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to eat Jack in the Box today.

02:25:14.841 --> 02:25:16.782
[SPEAKER_07]: I really wanted to go there and be late.

02:25:17.782 --> 02:25:20.862
[SPEAKER_09]: We went out for gay brunch as we usually do on Sundays.

02:25:20.902 --> 02:25:22.763
[SPEAKER_09]: And I call it gay brunch because we eat brunch with other gays.

02:25:23.483 --> 02:25:25.923
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wanted to eat healthy.

02:25:26.403 --> 02:25:28.164
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry sir, we don't do salads until 11.30pm.

02:25:30.339 --> 02:25:32.662
[SPEAKER_04]: LOL, it's time for red velvet pancakes.

02:25:32.942 --> 02:25:34.163
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know, right?

02:25:34.303 --> 02:25:40.710
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I got Hawaiian bread French toast, which is really good, don't get me wrong, but probably not the healthiest thing I could eat.

02:25:41.311 --> 02:25:47.778
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas Alan's like, I was going to get the veggie omelette, but I decided I'd go a little dairy and get turkey.

02:25:50.720 --> 02:26:05.918
[SPEAKER_05]: by the way, Alan has lost like a lot of weight I was about to say, Alan's doing really, really well you think I would like, you know, try to take some cues and do the same thing now you can be the like what's the old ass poem Jack Spratt and his wife laughs

02:26:06.118 --> 02:26:07.138
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the thing.

02:26:07.298 --> 02:26:09.959
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan's got the advantage on me where he walks to work and all that.

02:26:10.039 --> 02:26:13.001
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've been very bad when it gets to motivated for exercise.

02:26:13.021 --> 02:26:15.461
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I really need to really motivate myself to exercise.

02:26:15.481 --> 02:26:17.062
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the only way I'm ever going to change things.

02:26:17.402 --> 02:26:18.182
[SPEAKER_09]: And then snacking.

02:26:18.382 --> 02:26:20.063
[SPEAKER_09]: I am a terrible, terrible snacker.

02:26:20.523 --> 02:26:21.684
[SPEAKER_09]: Like that is my weakness.

02:26:22.104 --> 02:26:23.884
[SPEAKER_09]: I really need to just get rid of every...

02:26:25.405 --> 02:26:50.418
[SPEAKER_07]: like horrible snack out of this house and have nothing but carrots and celery in the fridge so I have no choice but then that's not fair on Fridays at our work they pop popcorn in a popcorn machine we have and I'm not talking about like a popcorn machine like an air popper I'm talking about a big fucking popcorn machine that they have the movie theaters popcorn machine they pop extra popcorn for me they gave me a bowl like a big ass bowl I eat more popcorn at that company than fucking people at the company other than me

02:26:51.894 --> 02:26:52.234
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

02:27:16.323 --> 02:27:17.324
[SPEAKER_09]: So here's the thing.

02:27:18.224 --> 02:27:19.745
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't have that at Jack in the Box.

02:27:19.845 --> 02:27:19.965
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

02:27:20.065 --> 02:27:21.906
[SPEAKER_09]: Jack in the Box has deep fried tacos.

02:27:21.966 --> 02:27:23.146
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what you get at Jack in the Box.

02:27:24.107 --> 02:27:24.747
[SPEAKER_09]: Red Velvet Pancakes.

02:27:24.807 --> 02:27:27.688
[SPEAKER_09]: We went to a brunch place once and they happened to have Red Velvet Pancakes.

02:27:27.708 --> 02:27:28.769
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a place downtown, right?

02:27:28.849 --> 02:27:29.429
[SPEAKER_09]: Ermagerd.

02:27:30.110 --> 02:27:30.790
[SPEAKER_04]: That we went to.

02:27:30.830 --> 02:27:31.770
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it Red Rabbit?

02:27:31.970 --> 02:27:32.331
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

02:27:32.391 --> 02:27:34.132
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to the pumpkin and you had Red Velvet.

02:27:34.152 --> 02:27:34.532
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

02:27:35.452 --> 02:27:36.132
[SPEAKER_09]: Fucking amazing.

02:27:37.133 --> 02:27:38.033
[SPEAKER_04]: I want pancakes now.

02:27:38.794 --> 02:27:39.234
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

02:27:39.537 --> 02:27:40.158
[SPEAKER_09]: Pancakes.

02:27:40.619 --> 02:27:42.001
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, that's it for the FUs of the week.

02:27:42.521 --> 02:27:46.788
[SPEAKER_09]: Skype lines soon, Twitter topics soon as well, but first, a couple more news stories.

02:27:48.047 --> 02:27:48.347
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:27:49.128 --> 02:27:50.929
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's see here.

02:27:51.029 --> 02:27:55.072
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk a little bit about the next generation of Kinect.

02:27:55.092 --> 02:27:59.275
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, of course, we know that the next Xbox system is going to have Kinect.

02:27:59.635 --> 02:28:02.156
[SPEAKER_07]: And we need to know what the hell it's going to be able to do.

02:28:02.637 --> 02:28:04.698
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this may be kind of an idea.

02:28:05.719 --> 02:28:14.505
[SPEAKER_07]: The company that was behind the Kinect sensor in the first place has this cool video that they put out kind of showing what it's going to do.

02:28:18.487 --> 02:28:47.197
[SPEAKER_07]: everything that the original Kinect was supposed to do but didn't actually kind of do you know the whole closed thing they're saying that they're going to try to work this technology into pretty much everything into like you know non-display stuff to all the computers and it's just going to work it's going to have you know high speed tracking all that stuff and actually the little thing that they've got there the prototype looks exactly like the Kinect with some extra bullshit sticking out of the top I'm not really sure what the hell that is

02:28:47.977 --> 02:28:52.320
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's in developers' hands right now, so they're going to be using this.

02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:56.782
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's called Capri, the next generation of censors.

02:28:59.863 --> 02:29:01.023
[SPEAKER_09]: The next generation.

02:29:01.544 --> 02:29:01.744
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

02:29:01.944 --> 02:29:09.949
[SPEAKER_07]: They're saying it's supposed to have... They're going to be trying to fit it into everyday devices, and they're saying the same resolution as the Kinect.

02:29:10.689 --> 02:29:12.350
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know.

02:29:12.450 --> 02:29:13.151
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks pretty cool.

02:29:14.151 --> 02:29:19.334
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the video... Watching the video reminded me a lot of just everything.

02:29:19.494 --> 02:29:21.035
[SPEAKER_07]: They show this guy at a presentation.

02:29:21.055 --> 02:29:21.135
[SPEAKER_07]: He's...

02:29:24.232 --> 02:29:27.719
[SPEAKER_07]: Manipulating stuff on the screen as you would think you would be able to do.

02:29:29.042 --> 02:29:29.724
[SPEAKER_07]: They're talking about...

02:29:31.683 --> 02:29:36.465
[SPEAKER_07]: Even stuff to where, oh hey, I have someone coming over in facial recognition.

02:29:36.485 --> 02:29:37.406
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's my friend.

02:29:37.766 --> 02:29:39.166
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to unlock the door for him.

02:29:39.807 --> 02:29:40.907
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he comes in and murders you.

02:29:42.268 --> 02:29:47.690
[SPEAKER_07]: That's for switching channels on your TV by just kind of going, eh, moving my hand back and forth.

02:29:48.391 --> 02:29:48.831
[SPEAKER_07]: That type of stuff.

02:29:48.851 --> 02:29:50.852
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you know, pushing buttons on a remote is so hard.

02:29:52.092 --> 02:29:53.353
[SPEAKER_07]: Move my hand back and forth.

02:29:53.873 --> 02:29:56.014
[SPEAKER_07]: Swiping a fly away and your TV's going crazy.

02:29:58.155 --> 02:30:00.316
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, one more news story for you guys.

02:30:00.556 --> 02:30:06.038
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, this isn't gaming technically, but it is the voice of Geeks Network, you guys.

02:30:06.078 --> 02:30:08.439
[SPEAKER_09]: So once in a while, we gotta blur the line a little bit.

02:30:08.760 --> 02:30:18.304
[SPEAKER_09]: And this has to do with a musician who did make one of the greatest video game songs of the past 10 years still alive from Portal, right?

02:30:20.805 --> 02:30:26.249
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm making a note here He is so nice in person

02:30:36.275 --> 02:30:36.395
[SPEAKER_09]: L.A.

02:30:36.455 --> 02:30:38.517
[SPEAKER_09]: faced with the Oakland booties

02:31:07.890 --> 02:31:09.492
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard this, huh?

02:31:09.753 --> 02:31:10.834
[SPEAKER_07]: I listened to it after.

02:31:10.854 --> 02:31:15.840
[SPEAKER_07]: I only heard the lounge version by Lounge Against the Machine.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:16.381
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, right.

02:31:17.362 --> 02:31:18.463
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Richard Cheese.

02:31:18.784 --> 02:31:19.004
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

02:31:19.264 --> 02:31:20.746
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, Sir Mix-A-Lot.

02:31:20.946 --> 02:31:23.930
[SPEAKER_09]: So, technically, it is Sir Mix-A-Lot's song.

02:31:24.070 --> 02:31:25.212
[SPEAKER_09]: And Joko did a cover.

02:31:25.492 --> 02:31:27.653
[SPEAKER_07]: He did a cover, but it was a licensed cover.

02:31:27.713 --> 02:31:31.256
[SPEAKER_07]: He licensed the rights to do that and he made his own original version.

02:31:31.916 --> 02:31:34.298
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very unique and very different.

02:31:34.318 --> 02:31:37.440
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like Johnny Cash's Hurt.

02:31:37.460 --> 02:31:39.301
[SPEAKER_09]: The Nine Inch Nails version, amazing.

02:31:39.601 --> 02:31:42.263
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny Cash's version, fucking amazing.

02:31:43.043 --> 02:31:48.527
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard for me to say that because I love the Nine Inch Nails version so much, but they are both so fucking good, but very different.

02:31:48.547 --> 02:31:53.370
[SPEAKER_05]: When Trent Reznor is saying that he likes it better, then you know you've got amazing.

02:31:53.570 --> 02:31:54.551
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the problem.

02:31:55.390 --> 02:31:56.831
[SPEAKER_09]: Glee, the TV show.

02:31:56.971 --> 02:31:59.232
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they do a lot of covers and all that stuff.

02:32:00.933 --> 02:32:07.777
[SPEAKER_09]: Here is the Glee version of Baby Got Back set to be on the Sadie Hawkins episode that will be on the 24th.

02:32:08.197 --> 02:32:10.178
[SPEAKER_09]: This song was available in the U.S.

02:32:10.298 --> 02:32:10.898
[SPEAKER_09]: iTunes store.

02:32:11.038 --> 02:32:11.659
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pulled.

02:32:11.739 --> 02:32:14.140
[SPEAKER_09]: It was still spotted on the Swedish iTunes store.

02:32:14.200 --> 02:32:15.300
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yes, this is legit.

02:32:15.661 --> 02:32:19.202
[SPEAKER_09]: See if you see any similarities here in the Glee version of Baby Got Back.

02:32:21.404 --> 02:32:21.784
[SPEAKER_03]: L.A.

02:32:21.844 --> 02:32:23.765
[SPEAKER_03]: face with the Oakland Moonies

02:32:31.474 --> 02:32:33.216
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I heard that before somewhere.

02:32:42.992 --> 02:32:48.975
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, it's one thing to cover the song, especially when you're going to do it like the original.

02:32:50.115 --> 02:32:57.498
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I need to play the original version of Baby Got Back, but I'll do the Rob Roberts cover of Baby Got Back.

02:32:57.538 --> 02:32:57.919
[SPEAKER_09]: You ready?

02:32:58.819 --> 02:33:00.060
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God.

02:33:00.420 --> 02:33:02.100
[SPEAKER_09]: Becky, look at her butt.

02:33:02.280 --> 02:33:03.261
[SPEAKER_09]: It is so big.

02:33:03.321 --> 02:33:03.741
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, look.

02:33:03.881 --> 02:33:05.882
[SPEAKER_09]: So obviously the original was very, very different, right?

02:33:05.922 --> 02:33:07.043
[SPEAKER_09]: And had the whole beat to it.

02:33:08.283 --> 02:33:13.266
[SPEAKER_09]: So, for Glee to just totally rip this off the way they did is kind of shitty.

02:33:13.726 --> 02:33:15.107
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really shitty.

02:33:15.167 --> 02:33:18.129
[SPEAKER_09]: To think that nobody would notice is crazy.

02:33:18.469 --> 02:33:23.832
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, just so you know, Joko, what is making the internet rally around him is that he posted to his Twitter

02:33:24.884 --> 02:33:25.625
[SPEAKER_09]: I had no idea.

02:33:26.426 --> 02:33:27.146
[SPEAKER_09]: He had no clue.

02:33:27.246 --> 02:33:28.367
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's like, WTF?

02:33:28.708 --> 02:33:32.111
[SPEAKER_09]: And he is trying to see what kind of legal action is available at this point, but it's complicated.

02:33:32.211 --> 02:33:36.415
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it wasn't really his song in the first place, although it was his arrangement.

02:33:36.995 --> 02:33:37.836
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the best part.

02:33:37.956 --> 02:33:39.117
[SPEAKER_09]: You might be getting to this, Loki.

02:33:39.718 --> 02:33:47.025
[SPEAKER_09]: In the lyrics, if I were to play the full thing, a part where he changed the lyrics from Sir Mix-a-Lot to Johnny C...

02:33:48.366 --> 02:33:52.810
[SPEAKER_09]: Glee sings in their version, Johnny C. So you know damn well where they got it.

02:33:53.510 --> 02:33:54.631
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no mystery.

02:33:55.192 --> 02:33:56.913
[SPEAKER_07]: They removed one of them at the end.

02:33:57.514 --> 02:34:00.556
[SPEAKER_07]: The 1-900, you know, what was it?

02:34:01.557 --> 02:34:05.000
[SPEAKER_07]: He did something else, 1-900 something, and then he changed it.

02:34:06.341 --> 02:34:06.561
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

02:34:08.953 --> 02:34:09.554
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, man.

02:34:09.574 --> 02:34:12.556
[SPEAKER_07]: That is just blatant.

02:34:14.098 --> 02:34:16.840
[SPEAKER_07]: And even he said they stole the arrangement.

02:34:17.160 --> 02:34:24.407
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually duck sounds or something in the background that he sampled or something that are in that song in exactly the same spot.

02:34:24.447 --> 02:34:26.869
[SPEAKER_07]: They stole the instrumental and just sang over it.

02:34:30.272 --> 02:34:30.352
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah.

02:34:32.228 --> 02:34:34.509
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, I don't know what's going to happen from here.

02:34:34.649 --> 02:34:37.170
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think legally he could do anything about it?

02:34:37.190 --> 02:34:37.510
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he can.

02:34:37.670 --> 02:34:38.330
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he can.

02:34:38.811 --> 02:34:40.731
[SPEAKER_09]: If they actually stole the lyrics or whatever?

02:34:40.751 --> 02:34:41.892
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because it's his arrangement.

02:34:42.172 --> 02:34:43.733
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that he definitely has a case.

02:34:46.013 --> 02:34:51.156
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, gee, the folks in the chat rooms really seem to be enjoying the Rob Roberts cover of Baby Got Back.

02:34:51.236 --> 02:34:53.857
[SPEAKER_09]: So, big butts and I cannot lie.

02:34:54.177 --> 02:34:55.737
[SPEAKER_09]: You other brothers can't deny.

02:34:56.618 --> 02:34:57.178
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, forget it.

02:35:00.663 --> 02:35:01.444
[SPEAKER_09]: The original's awesome.

02:35:01.504 --> 02:35:03.265
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, Alan is like, please stop.

02:35:03.546 --> 02:35:04.006
[SPEAKER_09]: Please don't.

02:35:04.867 --> 02:35:05.247
[SPEAKER_09]: Knock it off.

02:35:05.287 --> 02:35:07.409
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but Alan, you weren't here watching Rob shake his ass.

02:35:10.111 --> 02:35:11.633
[SPEAKER_09]: I like Ross Steel UT's comment.

02:35:11.953 --> 02:35:13.855
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, that's some Milli Vanilli shit.

02:35:15.357 --> 02:35:18.078
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to, there's a little bit of a clap that I heard in the beginning.

02:35:18.118 --> 02:35:24.960
[SPEAKER_07]: I want them to do the vanilla ice defense where it's like, but see mine went, you know, the original went boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

02:35:25.060 --> 02:35:28.121
[SPEAKER_06]: But mine went boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

02:35:28.761 --> 02:35:30.221
[SPEAKER_07]: You see it's different, right?

02:35:30.441 --> 02:35:30.861
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally.

02:35:31.761 --> 02:35:32.542
[SPEAKER_07]: It's totally different.

02:35:33.202 --> 02:35:35.122
[SPEAKER_07]: We added the psh in there.

02:35:35.202 --> 02:35:35.903
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes it different.

02:35:36.023 --> 02:35:37.323
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was so under pressure.

02:35:37.914 --> 02:35:40.617
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma in the chat says, wait, hold it, Glee is still relevant?

02:35:40.697 --> 02:35:44.180
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, but it's sinking in the ratings, but I heard they're going to renew it.

02:35:44.420 --> 02:35:51.866
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to know, okay, because it's supposed to be this new guy that's coming to the school or whatever that's hitting on the clearly gay guy on the show.

02:35:52.327 --> 02:35:58.592
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't it a little awkward to be singing a song about I like big butts and about all these things about butts that you like and stuff?

02:35:58.612 --> 02:36:00.794
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it seems a little weird.

02:36:01.174 --> 02:36:03.176
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't know.

02:36:04.648 --> 02:36:05.990
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a weird song anyway.

02:36:06.030 --> 02:36:08.973
[SPEAKER_09]: It's weird because no one over 12 watches Glee in the first place.

02:36:09.273 --> 02:36:14.600
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, the people that watch Glee or whatever, do they really know what Baby Got Back is?

02:36:14.660 --> 02:36:18.244
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, a lot of the kids were probably not even born when that song came out.

02:36:21.371 --> 02:36:21.731
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

02:36:22.312 --> 02:36:23.092
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it that old?

02:36:23.932 --> 02:36:26.334
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wish Glee would get cancelled.

02:36:26.454 --> 02:36:27.074
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I wish.

02:36:28.555 --> 02:36:28.995
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

02:36:31.136 --> 02:36:32.177
[SPEAKER_09]: That does it for news tonight.

02:36:32.217 --> 02:36:33.037
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the last story.

02:36:35.178 --> 02:36:38.920
[SPEAKER_09]: 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:36:38.960 --> 02:36:42.442
[SPEAKER_09]: The Skype line is open right now if you want to give us a call.

02:36:43.022 --> 02:36:44.864
[SPEAKER_09]: and while we wait for some calls to come in.

02:36:45.004 --> 02:36:47.446
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it is already lighting up on the phone.

02:36:47.486 --> 02:36:50.549
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to the phones and say hello to whoever's on the line.

02:36:50.869 --> 02:36:51.970
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.

02:36:51.990 --> 02:36:52.350
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

02:36:53.431 --> 02:36:53.832
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

02:36:55.173 --> 02:36:56.414
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that Bobby Blackwolf?

02:36:56.894 --> 02:36:57.515
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Bobby.

02:36:57.815 --> 02:36:58.516
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Bobby.

02:36:58.696 --> 02:36:59.837
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't sound so good, Bobby.

02:36:59.857 --> 02:37:02.920
[SPEAKER_09]: You sound like a sad panda or I should say a sad little birdie.

02:37:03.100 --> 02:37:04.101
[SPEAKER_09]: What's wrong, Bobby?

02:37:04.661 --> 02:37:05.442
[SPEAKER_10]: Sports ball.

02:37:06.223 --> 02:37:08.585
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, did you have a rough day at work?

02:37:10.647 --> 02:37:12.128
[SPEAKER_10]: I need a cheer up.

02:37:12.148 --> 02:37:13.569
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there any new games coming out?

02:37:13.629 --> 02:37:14.470
[SPEAKER_10]: I need a diversion.

02:37:14.830 --> 02:37:15.330
[SPEAKER_09]: Not really.

02:37:15.370 --> 02:37:17.051
[SPEAKER_09]: There's Ni No Kuni.

02:37:17.111 --> 02:37:19.433
[SPEAKER_09]: Ni No Kuni's coming out this week, Poppy.

02:37:21.754 --> 02:37:22.815
[SPEAKER_09]: You could try the demo.

02:37:22.835 --> 02:37:26.437
[SPEAKER_11]: You could try your face.

02:37:27.799 --> 02:37:28.179
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, wait.

02:37:28.359 --> 02:37:30.120
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby, that's a response after my own heart.

02:37:30.140 --> 02:37:31.941
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the Jamie defense right there.

02:37:32.181 --> 02:37:35.943
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Bobby, it's just a game, Bobby.

02:37:36.663 --> 02:37:39.284
[SPEAKER_09]: Here, I got something to help you out, okay?

02:37:39.424 --> 02:37:46.088
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go back to a time when your team was winning things, which I don't know if that actually exists, but we'll make believe.

02:37:47.188 --> 02:37:48.049
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:38:13.170 --> 02:38:14.973
[SPEAKER_09]: It kind of had a 2020 vibe to me.

02:38:14.993 --> 02:38:19.678
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I mean, how many legit gamer news shows do you see on TV now?

02:38:19.798 --> 02:38:20.239
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a lot.

02:38:21.280 --> 02:38:22.061
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, exactly.

02:38:22.802 --> 02:38:27.368
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was a clip from the Philly Classic Game Expo, right?

02:38:27.924 --> 02:38:42.914
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, it was from 2004, in I think March of 2004, and it was the Philly Classic Gaming Expo, and I was actually a co-organizer of it, along with a couple other people, one of which was another moderator on the forums over at G4.

02:38:43.735 --> 02:38:44.255
[SPEAKER_11]: And we had...

02:38:45.336 --> 02:38:54.381
[SPEAKER_11]: All converged on Philly Classic 4 the year before, and we kind of had a table, and it was kind of a G4 forum meetup and stuff, and we had about 15 people.

02:38:55.182 --> 02:38:57.743
[SPEAKER_11]: And for Philly Classic 5, it was like 50 people.

02:38:57.803 --> 02:39:00.285
[SPEAKER_11]: It was kind of like our PAX 08 experience.

02:39:00.705 --> 02:39:02.086
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, oh man, I love PAX 08.

02:39:02.126 --> 02:39:03.987
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was basically the G4 version of it.

02:39:04.187 --> 02:39:04.447
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

02:39:04.968 --> 02:39:08.330
[SPEAKER_11]: And what a lot of people in the OR audience...

02:39:09.289 --> 02:39:16.811
[SPEAKER_11]: Latched on to was the fact that when I was on it, beardless, because this was before the beard, there was a little bit of Bimani behind me.

02:39:17.731 --> 02:39:21.532
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was actually my setup at the show.

02:39:21.792 --> 02:39:24.472
[SPEAKER_11]: So as much as I rag on Bimani now, it wasn't dead then.

02:39:25.573 --> 02:39:28.193
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Seventh Style had just come out, maybe.

02:39:29.273 --> 02:39:30.654
[SPEAKER_11]: It was right around that time.

02:39:30.954 --> 02:39:31.674
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not dead yet.

02:39:32.563 --> 02:40:00.225
[SPEAKER_11]: and this was before Guitar Hero so I'm like you know these are classics instant classics that's what I'll call it and he wanted you know kind of some Ruddy Gore, Mark Wolf who's in the video he kind of wanted some other like different type of stuff so I'm like fine I'll bring my stuff all my import consoles and everything and I brought my stereo system and they provided the TV and I had I would run that weekend I think I ran Beatmania 2DX I had Para Para Paradise which we played once

02:40:01.745 --> 02:40:09.448
[SPEAKER_11]: I had Taiko no Tetsujin and I had Donkey Kong.

02:40:09.468 --> 02:40:10.328
[SPEAKER_11]: I had both versions.

02:40:12.849 --> 02:40:16.991
[SPEAKER_11]: Tommy Tallarico was the first time he had ever played it.

02:40:17.151 --> 02:40:21.733
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the pictures I posted up on Twitter was actually Tommy Tallarico playing Taiko no Tetsujin for the first time.

02:40:23.090 --> 02:40:25.592
[SPEAKER_11]: and so because he was there, he was one of the guests there.

02:40:25.632 --> 02:40:34.319
[SPEAKER_11]: They actually had at Philly Classic 5, they had, no, I think it was Philly Classic 4, they actually had, and I can't remember her name, but the woman from Tron.

02:40:35.940 --> 02:40:36.821
[SPEAKER_05]: Olivia Wilde?

02:40:37.041 --> 02:40:37.942
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, no, no.

02:40:38.002 --> 02:40:38.882
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, the original Tron.

02:40:39.103 --> 02:40:41.845
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Wendy, they did the music, right?

02:40:42.465 --> 02:40:46.108
[SPEAKER_11]: No, the actual, the woman who played the love interest.

02:40:46.809 --> 02:40:47.049
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

02:40:48.231 --> 02:40:50.833
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's the only thing she's ever done that anybody remembers.

02:40:51.453 --> 02:40:53.515
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there was a movement to bring her back for the new movie.

02:40:53.635 --> 02:40:54.075
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't work.

02:40:54.695 --> 02:40:58.678
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but that's where I met Sid Meier.

02:40:58.698 --> 02:40:59.979
[SPEAKER_11]: He showed up there.

02:41:00.019 --> 02:41:03.181
[SPEAKER_11]: And in Philly Classic 5, they had Howard Scott Warshaw, who made E.T.

02:41:03.201 --> 02:41:03.982
[SPEAKER_11]: and all that stuff.

02:41:04.542 --> 02:41:07.684
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was a lot of fun, and I exposed a lot of people to that.

02:41:07.704 --> 02:41:09.726
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I also would run Guitaroman and Rez.

02:41:10.868 --> 02:41:11.368
[SPEAKER_11]: Music Game

02:41:29.940 --> 02:41:31.301
[SPEAKER_11]: Other people had the DDR stuff.

02:41:31.361 --> 02:41:32.602
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, I don't do the DDR.

02:41:32.642 --> 02:41:33.723
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm doing all the other stuff.

02:41:33.763 --> 02:41:34.244
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

02:41:34.344 --> 02:41:35.645
[SPEAKER_09]: Trying to bring the other stuff to light.

02:41:35.785 --> 02:41:42.392
[SPEAKER_09]: If you like DDR, then you might like... I mean, it's not running anymore, though, right?

02:41:42.752 --> 02:41:43.413
[SPEAKER_09]: It folded.

02:41:43.513 --> 02:41:45.194
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm sure business reasons or whatever.

02:41:45.234 --> 02:41:45.855
[SPEAKER_11]: They wanted to.

02:41:45.935 --> 02:41:53.782
[SPEAKER_11]: We had big plans for Philly Classic 6, but unfortunately, the people that were up in Philadelphia that ran it, there was a little bit of drama.

02:41:55.244 --> 02:42:20.378
[SPEAKER_11]: essentially the short version that I kind of remember is that they had kind of passed the keys on to another guy who completely changed the show and he changed it to something else and it folded after like two or three years so they had trusted somebody else with it and he's like yeah the classic games are kind of cool and stuff but we're going to expand and he thought really really big and then it kind of it petered out

02:42:22.841 --> 02:42:23.742
[SPEAKER_09]: That sucks.

02:42:24.022 --> 02:42:26.325
[SPEAKER_09]: You should definitely check out someday.

02:42:26.465 --> 02:42:33.854
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it involves traveling to California, but California Extreme is an awesome classic game show with all the old school arcade machines and stuff.

02:42:33.874 --> 02:42:35.016
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the kind of thing I think of.

02:42:35.379 --> 02:42:39.361
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really, really lots of fun.

02:42:39.381 --> 02:42:46.046
[SPEAKER_11]: There was one of the local arcade distributors that still worked in arcades with a lot of the classic systems.

02:42:46.626 --> 02:42:52.670
[SPEAKER_11]: They were on the East Coast somewhere, but they brought 50 arcade machines all set to free play to this show.

02:42:53.430 --> 02:42:59.554
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, what we did is, leading up to my little rhythm game thing, they had the gaming experience through time.

02:43:00.114 --> 02:43:10.756
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was just, you could go up and go to these consoles and it would like, they started at like, you know, the Magnavox Odyssey and then an Atari 2600 all going up to Xbox, PlayStation 2 and stuff.

02:43:10.776 --> 02:43:16.258
[SPEAKER_11]: So you could actually go down the line and see, you know, the next console in time.

02:43:16.378 --> 02:43:17.798
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like an interactive timeline.

02:43:18.138 --> 02:43:18.318
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

02:43:18.598 --> 02:43:18.898
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

02:43:19.378 --> 02:43:22.339
[SPEAKER_11]: So we did stuff like that and it was a lot of fun.

02:43:22.867 --> 02:43:26.109
[SPEAKER_09]: Many folks in chat saying we should have a VOGCon.

02:43:26.189 --> 02:43:28.691
[SPEAKER_09]: We could have a VOGCon someday.

02:43:28.731 --> 02:43:30.292
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not outside the realm of possibility.

02:43:30.612 --> 02:43:35.616
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Brad from PodCulture, why don't you have VOGCon in Atlanta the day before DragonCon?

02:43:36.336 --> 02:43:38.438
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, why don't we just have it at DragonCon?

02:43:38.478 --> 02:43:39.959
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably the smartest idea.

02:43:40.099 --> 02:43:48.264
[SPEAKER_09]: I think certainly there should be, whether it's official or unofficial, a VOG event at DragonCon is certainly within the realm of possibility for this year.

02:43:48.304 --> 02:43:51.406
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, I've said we're going to have an official event.

02:43:51.707 --> 02:43:51.887
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

02:43:52.347 --> 02:43:53.908
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty much been confirmed to me.

02:43:53.968 --> 02:43:56.950
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, obviously, I won't know for certain until, like, next month.

02:43:57.170 --> 02:43:57.350
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

02:43:57.871 --> 02:44:04.195
[SPEAKER_11]: But, no, we've already got, like, an official panel, which means we'll be in the program and all that stuff.

02:44:04.835 --> 02:44:14.441
[SPEAKER_11]: But then other events, I mean, there's a huge gaming area, like tabletop gaming area downstairs, and we could easily, like, commandeer, like, a corner of that one night.

02:44:14.761 --> 02:44:15.142
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

02:44:15.482 --> 02:44:16.022
[SPEAKER_11]: For just us.

02:44:16.282 --> 02:44:21.566
[SPEAKER_09]: So it sounds like if you want to meet as many VOG people as possible, Atlanta's going to be the place to be Labor Day weekend.

02:44:21.846 --> 02:44:22.326
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

02:44:22.627 --> 02:44:23.147
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

02:44:23.167 --> 02:44:23.868
[SPEAKER_11]: You should do it.

02:44:24.608 --> 02:44:26.330
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't be as depressed about sports ball.

02:44:26.530 --> 02:44:26.890
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?

02:44:27.411 --> 02:44:28.832
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't be as depressed about sports ball.

02:44:28.872 --> 02:44:30.313
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it'll all be over by then.

02:44:30.393 --> 02:44:32.555
[SPEAKER_09]: If the Niners lose in a couple weeks, will it make you feel better?

02:44:33.716 --> 02:44:37.078
[SPEAKER_11]: No, see, I want them to win now because that means we lost to the champions.

02:44:37.379 --> 02:44:38.600
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, that's a good way of thinking about it.

02:44:39.200 --> 02:44:46.026
[SPEAKER_11]: And here's the thing that made it worse, the sports ball thing worse, is because of the whole video game industry tie-in on my Twitter.

02:44:46.966 --> 02:44:51.310
[SPEAKER_11]: The majority of the video game industry, especially the PR context, guess where they live?

02:44:51.510 --> 02:44:52.571
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, the Bay Area.

02:44:52.711 --> 02:44:53.151
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that.

02:44:54.151 --> 02:44:56.953
[SPEAKER_11]: So I did not check my personal Twitter all day.

02:44:57.013 --> 02:44:58.093
[SPEAKER_11]: I just could not take it.

02:44:58.133 --> 02:44:58.794
[SPEAKER_09]: Couldn't handle it.

02:44:59.214 --> 02:45:04.997
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I think the saddest picture you posted was the confetti cannon behind you guys, and you just put unused.

02:45:05.557 --> 02:45:06.938
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it was right there.

02:45:06.998 --> 02:45:10.479
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually took another picture of just my drum next to it, and everybody else had left.

02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:13.781
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just my drum next to the confetti cannon, but yeah, they...

02:45:17.394 --> 02:45:18.054
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry about that.

02:45:18.074 --> 02:45:20.396
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, there's always next year.

02:45:20.696 --> 02:45:21.057
[SPEAKER_09]: There is.

02:45:21.897 --> 02:45:23.399
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Bobby, focus on the positive.

02:45:24.019 --> 02:45:27.002
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of good things coming with VOG and all that in the future.

02:45:27.762 --> 02:45:31.325
[SPEAKER_09]: You did not have a show this week, sadly, but tell the folks where they can catch you next week.

02:45:32.546 --> 02:45:33.707
[SPEAKER_11]: Right here on VOG.

02:45:34.448 --> 02:45:35.569
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm the opening act.

02:45:36.528 --> 02:45:38.409
[SPEAKER_11]: and I will be live next week.

02:45:38.529 --> 02:45:41.191
[SPEAKER_11]: I will not be live the following week because of sports ball.

02:45:41.971 --> 02:45:49.435
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was the other bad thing because I go to a party because it's the time I see a lot of my friends and so I never do a show on the big super sports ball day.

02:45:49.995 --> 02:45:59.120
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was the first couple messages I got from my friends instead of saying, oh man, sorry and all that stuff and yeah, it was a closed game, blah, blah, blah.

02:45:59.360 --> 02:45:59.861
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they were like,

02:46:00.501 --> 02:46:04.363
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, this means you're coming to our Super Bowl party and bringing your pizza dip.

02:46:04.383 --> 02:46:05.223
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm like, guys!

02:46:05.444 --> 02:46:09.546
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you have actually had to fly to wherever they're having the Super Bowl this year?

02:46:10.166 --> 02:46:12.367
[SPEAKER_11]: The plan was we were going to go to New Orleans.

02:46:12.827 --> 02:46:18.971
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if we couldn't get into the game, we were going to do corporate events around New Orleans, maybe play in some of the bars.

02:46:19.311 --> 02:46:23.993
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd march the tailgates outside of the Superdome, and then we'd go to a bar and watch the game at a bar.

02:46:24.213 --> 02:46:25.334
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell me more about this pizza dip.

02:46:28.644 --> 02:46:29.765
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a trade secret.

02:46:51.227 --> 02:46:56.935
[SPEAKER_09]: and I also was given a tip that it is the best day to go to a theme park near here.

02:46:57.035 --> 02:46:59.038
[SPEAKER_09]: Not Disneyland but one of the other ones, Magic Mountain.

02:46:59.299 --> 02:47:00.901
[SPEAKER_09]: So I may go to Magic Mountain.

02:47:02.028 --> 02:47:02.948
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we'll see.

02:47:03.949 --> 02:47:05.770
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yep.

02:47:05.810 --> 02:47:06.610
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys cheered me up.

02:47:06.650 --> 02:47:07.171
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you guys.

02:47:07.491 --> 02:47:07.991
[SPEAKER_09]: Aw, thank you.

02:47:08.031 --> 02:47:08.711
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad we could.

02:47:08.912 --> 02:47:12.994
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm glad we get to have you at the end of our show because you're always kind enough to have us on every week.

02:47:13.014 --> 02:47:16.315
[SPEAKER_07]: I also cheered you up by beating all your scores on Forza Horizon.

02:47:16.475 --> 02:47:16.996
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop it.

02:47:18.837 --> 02:47:19.857
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, go kick his ass.

02:47:20.317 --> 02:47:21.118
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

02:47:21.818 --> 02:47:22.979
[SPEAKER_05]: Making hearts in your direction.

02:47:23.739 --> 02:47:24.640
[SPEAKER_10]: Aw, thank you.

02:47:26.401 --> 02:47:27.702
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel bad for your team.

02:47:28.962 --> 02:47:32.265
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, you got DarkSakura kind of to care about football.

02:47:32.545 --> 02:47:34.146
[SPEAKER_09]: That should make you feel better than anything else.

02:47:34.606 --> 02:47:35.887
[SPEAKER_11]: And see, I would have gotten a ring.

02:47:37.568 --> 02:47:40.349
[SPEAKER_11]: If we had gone in two weeks and won, I would have gotten a ring.

02:47:41.770 --> 02:47:43.071
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know what?

02:47:43.832 --> 02:47:45.032
[SPEAKER_09]: There's always next year.

02:47:45.473 --> 02:47:48.314
[SPEAKER_09]: At DragonCon, I'll get you some onion rings.

02:47:48.434 --> 02:47:49.035
[SPEAKER_09]: How's that sound?

02:47:49.915 --> 02:47:50.576
[SPEAKER_11]: From the varsity.

02:47:51.678 --> 02:47:53.021
[SPEAKER_07]: Locals will understand that.

02:47:53.141 --> 02:47:56.787
[SPEAKER_07]: They should launch the puppy out of the cannon for a puppy bowl.

02:47:57.288 --> 02:47:57.569
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

02:47:57.689 --> 02:47:58.590
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm letting you go, Bobby.

02:47:58.630 --> 02:47:59.031
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care.

02:47:59.873 --> 02:48:00.874
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe a ferret instead.

02:48:00.894 --> 02:48:01.315
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye!

02:48:04.997 --> 02:48:07.680
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

02:48:07.720 --> 02:48:10.402
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby was a little bit longer than we usually have the calls, but he's Bobby.

02:48:10.422 --> 02:48:10.863
[SPEAKER_09]: He can do that.

02:48:12.584 --> 02:48:15.107
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, also we got Twitter topics coming in.

02:48:15.387 --> 02:48:20.371
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter.com slash OLR and we can read some of those topics here.

02:48:23.574 --> 02:48:24.175
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

02:48:25.076 --> 02:48:26.397
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no, we got more calls coming in.

02:48:26.437 --> 02:48:26.777
[SPEAKER_09]: Never mind.

02:48:27.077 --> 02:48:27.938
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's take the calls instead.

02:48:28.439 --> 02:48:29.339
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:48:29.359 --> 02:48:29.680
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

02:48:32.276 --> 02:48:35.980
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, it's Codeman from the Down for Maintenance podcast.

02:48:36.120 --> 02:48:38.282
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing, Codeman from the Down for Maintenance podcast?

02:48:38.903 --> 02:48:39.704
[SPEAKER_09]: How you guys doing?

02:48:40.304 --> 02:48:41.205
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, alright.

02:48:41.305 --> 02:48:43.728
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess there was some big football news today, but you know.

02:48:44.088 --> 02:48:44.949
[SPEAKER_04]: I like your picture.

02:48:45.049 --> 02:48:45.870
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very army.

02:48:46.851 --> 02:48:47.872
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's my tattoo.

02:48:49.354 --> 02:48:50.355
[SPEAKER_09]: What does your tattoo say?

02:48:50.515 --> 02:48:52.537
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you didn't call in to talk about that, but I'm asking anyway.

02:48:54.138 --> 02:48:57.499
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever our souls are made of, hers and mine are the same.

02:48:57.919 --> 02:48:58.660
[SPEAKER_08]: It's for me and my wife.

02:48:58.980 --> 02:48:59.100
Aww.

02:48:59.120 --> 02:49:01.521
[SPEAKER_08]: That's adorable.

02:49:01.881 --> 02:49:02.322
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.

02:49:02.362 --> 02:49:02.742
[SPEAKER_08]: Geez.

02:49:03.062 --> 02:49:06.824
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, after the Bobby call and then now this little awe, I kind of feel down.

02:49:07.484 --> 02:49:08.144
[SPEAKER_08]: But that was good.

02:49:08.224 --> 02:49:08.565
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

02:49:08.685 --> 02:49:09.225
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.

02:49:09.265 --> 02:49:11.386
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we cheered Bobby up, so now you cheer us up.

02:49:11.746 --> 02:49:12.987
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:49:14.228 --> 02:49:18.311
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, that call kind of made me think of, you know, I live in Oklahoma.

02:49:18.491 --> 02:49:25.656
[SPEAKER_08]: Our team, our sports ball team, our college team didn't do very well this year either.

02:49:25.877 --> 02:49:29.940
[SPEAKER_08]: But we usually do, you know, pretty well.

02:49:30.180 --> 02:49:34.984
[SPEAKER_08]: We just didn't show up to any of the games mentally, I guess you would say.

02:49:35.864 --> 02:49:36.685
[SPEAKER_08]: Look on the bright side.

02:49:36.725 --> 02:49:38.787
[SPEAKER_09]: Your college team, at least their girlfriends are real.

02:49:39.787 --> 02:49:40.088
[SPEAKER_08]: True.

02:49:40.248 --> 02:49:41.108
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go, right?

02:49:41.128 --> 02:49:41.769
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:49:44.123 --> 02:49:46.104
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I just wanted to call and say hi to you guys.

02:49:48.805 --> 02:49:51.526
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually getting a chance to call you guys.

02:49:51.906 --> 02:49:55.608
[SPEAKER_08]: The baby is asleep and I'm actually getting a chance to call in.

02:49:55.668 --> 02:49:57.428
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm excited about that.

02:49:57.728 --> 02:50:02.990
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'll bring this up because I'm looking through the Twitter topics for tonight and I noticed you sent us a tweet.

02:50:03.351 --> 02:50:04.751
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have to show this to people in studio.

02:50:04.791 --> 02:50:06.932
[SPEAKER_09]: You tweeted, me with a power glove.

02:50:08.472 --> 02:50:09.093
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so bad.

02:50:09.133 --> 02:50:11.414
[SPEAKER_09]: You actually tweeted us a picture of yourself.

02:50:11.474 --> 02:50:12.654
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm showing the others in the studio there.

02:50:12.974 --> 02:50:15.075
[SPEAKER_09]: A picture of you holding the power glove.

02:50:15.315 --> 02:50:17.696
[SPEAKER_09]: And I like this little artsy pose you're doing with it too.

02:50:17.936 --> 02:50:20.817
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very like... I really like your scarf.

02:50:21.237 --> 02:50:22.438
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

02:50:22.698 --> 02:50:23.678
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got a scarf.

02:50:24.559 --> 02:50:26.860
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very hipster, but not in a douchebag way.

02:50:27.120 --> 02:50:28.800
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it.

02:50:28.960 --> 02:50:32.622
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a very drunken night.

02:50:32.662 --> 02:50:33.722
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like to talk about it.

02:50:33.922 --> 02:50:34.843
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see.

02:50:34.863 --> 02:50:35.143
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:50:36.365 --> 02:50:37.026
[SPEAKER_08]: and I'll see you next time.

02:50:52.726 --> 02:50:56.889
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they call it a Power Glove for a reason, so... Obviously, yeah.

02:50:57.169 --> 02:51:09.217
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I listen to you guys' show, and I just... Just, you know, like John on our podcast, he's from California as well, and it just makes me just so sad.

02:51:09.578 --> 02:51:15.582
[SPEAKER_08]: All the stuff that you guys can do in California, and I can't do here in Oklahoma, and it makes me... It just makes me sad.

02:51:15.602 --> 02:51:15.802
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:51:16.615 --> 02:51:18.137
[SPEAKER_05]: However, you have Waffle House, right?

02:51:18.898 --> 02:51:24.983
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have Waffle House, although you don't really want to go in there most of the time because some of the plates are a little dirty.

02:51:25.144 --> 02:51:29.428
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have Waffle House, and you should be glad for that fact because we don't have Waffle House and we never will.

02:51:29.568 --> 02:51:36.034
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was going to say, Oklahoma at least has Dunkin' Donuts, and we're not getting those until apparently 2015 is announced this week.

02:51:36.174 --> 02:51:38.636
[SPEAKER_09]: At least we're finally going to get them in SoCal.

02:51:38.796 --> 02:51:39.998
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss Waffle House, Rob.

02:51:40.518 --> 02:51:41.199
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

02:51:41.399 --> 02:51:42.060
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that good.

02:51:42.080 --> 02:51:42.981
[SPEAKER_05]: No, yes it is.

02:51:43.522 --> 02:51:45.984
[SPEAKER_05]: I want my chocolate chip pancakes extra crispy, please.

02:51:46.004 --> 02:51:46.345
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

02:51:46.545 --> 02:51:47.266
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are good.

02:51:47.386 --> 02:51:48.027
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are very good.

02:51:48.067 --> 02:51:48.868
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you wowing?

02:51:48.888 --> 02:51:50.549
[SPEAKER_09]: The fact that we don't have Dunkin' Donuts here?

02:51:51.090 --> 02:51:51.751
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

02:51:51.851 --> 02:51:53.373
[SPEAKER_09]: I figured you probably would.

02:51:53.653 --> 02:51:53.853
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

02:51:54.214 --> 02:51:54.414
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

02:51:54.574 --> 02:51:54.814
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the...

02:51:55.555 --> 02:52:00.036
[SPEAKER_09]: It is like the number one thing when I tell people on the East Coast, like, you know, because I'll go out to visit.

02:52:00.056 --> 02:52:02.177
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll go to like New York or even when I was at PAX.

02:52:02.477 --> 02:52:04.797
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, fuck, yes, we've got to go to Dunkin' Donuts.

02:52:04.857 --> 02:52:06.298
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God, I haven't had Dunkin' Donuts in forever.

02:52:06.318 --> 02:52:06.778
[SPEAKER_09]: We got to go.

02:52:06.838 --> 02:52:08.778
[SPEAKER_09]: And like my friends are like, the fuck?

02:52:09.078 --> 02:52:09.759
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, really?

02:52:10.199 --> 02:52:11.139
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, no, you don't understand.

02:52:11.179 --> 02:52:11.759
[SPEAKER_09]: I live in California.

02:52:11.779 --> 02:52:12.579
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have Dunkin' Donuts.

02:52:12.599 --> 02:52:14.520
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're like, where the fuck do you get donuts?

02:52:14.940 --> 02:52:17.500
[SPEAKER_04]: I made Tiara drive me to Dunkin' Donuts in Las Vegas.

02:52:17.600 --> 02:52:18.361
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm like, they don't.

02:52:19.061 --> 02:52:23.002
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Ma and Pop stores or if you can find a Krispy Kreme that didn't go under.

02:52:23.202 --> 02:52:23.542
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

02:52:24.843 --> 02:52:27.365
[SPEAKER_08]: I did grow up with Krispy Kreme.

02:52:27.405 --> 02:52:29.947
[SPEAKER_08]: Krispy Kreme is few and far between in Oklahoma.

02:52:30.067 --> 02:52:35.012
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a couple of them around where I live, but they're pretty hard to find.

02:52:35.252 --> 02:52:37.154
[SPEAKER_05]: Krispy Kreme in Alabama is like Starbucks.

02:52:39.013 --> 02:52:39.954
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's what we have here.

02:52:40.034 --> 02:52:41.435
[SPEAKER_09]: Starbucks everywhere.

02:52:43.316 --> 02:52:43.917
[SPEAKER_08]: Krispy Kreme.

02:52:44.177 --> 02:52:50.102
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, trying to bring it back to video games a little bit, I know you have been playing a little more Forza Horizon lately as well.

02:52:50.262 --> 02:52:52.764
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that's something you were talking about on Down for Maintenance.

02:52:52.844 --> 02:52:54.305
[SPEAKER_09]: So what are your thoughts on Forza?

02:52:54.986 --> 02:52:56.547
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it.

02:52:57.368 --> 02:53:03.853
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason why I love it, and I've mentioned this on my podcast, is that, you know, I think the last...

02:53:04.752 --> 02:53:05.753
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my dryer just went off.

02:53:07.513 --> 02:53:14.916
[SPEAKER_08]: The last racing game I played was Cruising USA and Bowling Alley Arcade.

02:53:15.497 --> 02:53:20.038
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, I don't know, it kind of brings me back to that kind of racing.

02:53:20.579 --> 02:53:22.960
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very arcade-y, and I like that about it.

02:53:23.120 --> 02:53:26.321
[SPEAKER_08]: And the fact that you can race against...

02:53:26.601 --> 02:53:27.282
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:53:48.897 --> 02:53:53.279
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're going to try to set a date and time for either this week or next, and we'll tweet about it.

02:53:53.359 --> 02:53:58.001
[SPEAKER_09]: We need everybody possible to come join in on the fun, so look out for that, including Loki.

02:53:59.121 --> 02:53:59.342
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

02:53:59.802 --> 02:54:01.382
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Loki, he's all over it.

02:54:01.763 --> 02:54:04.184
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, he's been on that thing like white on rice, man.

02:54:04.204 --> 02:54:04.724
[SPEAKER_08]: It's crazy.

02:54:05.004 --> 02:54:05.584
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

02:54:05.804 --> 02:54:06.365
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

02:54:06.605 --> 02:54:08.766
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of took a break, though, to make more details.

02:54:08.966 --> 02:54:14.508
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I'm making a, spoiler, a sticker for the back of my car that says, How am I driving?

02:54:14.528 --> 02:54:14.988
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-RLR.

02:54:15.008 --> 02:54:15.128
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesus.

02:54:18.226 --> 02:54:19.766
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice advertisement.

02:54:19.867 --> 02:54:21.787
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all over the car.

02:54:21.927 --> 02:54:23.508
[SPEAKER_09]: You are so dumb, but I love it.

02:54:23.608 --> 02:54:23.868
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:54:24.588 --> 02:54:30.770
[SPEAKER_09]: Codeman, tell the folks how they can tune into your podcast, which you do Google Hangouts and stuff now too, right?

02:54:31.350 --> 02:54:31.570
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

02:54:31.830 --> 02:54:32.830
[SPEAKER_09]: You're playing with your format?

02:54:32.870 --> 02:54:34.371
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to switch to video or what?

02:54:35.311 --> 02:54:38.654
[SPEAKER_08]: We kind of do it back and forth every once in a while.

02:54:38.674 --> 02:54:41.616
[SPEAKER_08]: We just kind of dabble in audio and video.

02:54:41.677 --> 02:54:47.461
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, you can find us on YouTube at youtube.com backslash the DFM podcast.

02:54:47.481 --> 02:54:50.584
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can follow us on Twitter at the DFM podcast.

02:54:51.405 --> 02:54:56.329
[SPEAKER_08]: Then, of course, you can find us on iTunes at the DFM podcast.

02:55:01.113 --> 02:55:02.534
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, we should be on there.

02:55:02.554 --> 02:55:08.399
[SPEAKER_08]: We're on our eighth episode, actually the next episode, which you, DarkSakura, are going to guest on.

02:55:08.680 --> 02:55:08.960
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

02:55:10.281 --> 02:55:13.344
[SPEAKER_08]: If you remember, I haven't sent you a reminder, so I don't know.

02:55:14.113 --> 02:55:16.873
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I put it on my phone, so I've got everything.

02:55:16.894 --> 02:55:18.454
[SPEAKER_05]: I have an alarm going off.

02:55:18.854 --> 02:55:19.974
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where you've got to be, is in the phone.

02:55:20.034 --> 02:55:23.635
[SPEAKER_08]: I've made no plans for that day.

02:55:23.915 --> 02:55:34.097
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to get all three of you guys on all at once, but I knew that with all kinds of different time schedules and stuff like that, I probably couldn't manage that.

02:55:35.157 --> 02:55:37.397
[SPEAKER_08]: We will have all three of you on now, so that's awesome.

02:55:37.997 --> 02:55:40.818
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you very much for having us on and expertly plugged.

02:55:40.938 --> 02:55:42.138
[SPEAKER_09]: Appreciate it, and best of luck with your show.

02:55:42.930 --> 02:55:43.911
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, Rob.

02:56:05.794 --> 02:56:06.595
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:56:34.951 --> 02:56:35.352
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

02:56:35.792 --> 02:56:37.273
[SPEAKER_09]: Something he saw at MagFest.

02:56:37.613 --> 02:56:41.895
[SPEAKER_09]: An original Atari 2600 game with the classic cartridge, box, and manual.

02:56:42.475 --> 02:56:44.096
[SPEAKER_09]: CGE Adventures.

02:56:44.396 --> 02:56:47.738
[SPEAKER_09]: It is amazing how people are still making stuff for the Atari 2600 even today.

02:56:48.879 --> 02:56:54.182
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get all kinds of repros of stuff that were prototypes.

02:56:54.522 --> 02:56:55.102
[SPEAKER_05]: Repro prototypes.

02:56:55.122 --> 02:56:56.203
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how we have a Millipede for $5,200.

02:56:57.470 --> 02:57:06.053
[SPEAKER_09]: Even some of those flashback consoles had some of the design challenge winners.

02:57:06.933 --> 02:57:13.735
[SPEAKER_09]: Funny enough, I remember Bobby earlier was talking about Howard Scott Warshaw at the Expo in Philly.

02:57:14.115 --> 02:57:18.577
[SPEAKER_09]: Saboteur, his last game, I think was one of those games that showed up in a flashback console at some point.

02:57:19.377 --> 02:57:20.117
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of interesting.

02:57:20.397 --> 02:57:21.478
[SPEAKER_09]: You do still see those show up.

02:57:23.278 --> 02:57:24.158
[SPEAKER_09]: in one place or another.

02:57:24.198 --> 02:57:27.360
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:57:28.040 --> 02:57:29.240
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiger Claw sending us some tweets.

02:57:29.760 --> 02:57:33.442
[SPEAKER_09]: More League of Legends players banned for toxic behavior.

02:57:35.302 --> 02:57:39.704
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, League of Legends is not going to put up with that shit anymore where people are harassing other people.

02:57:41.265 --> 02:57:46.106
[SPEAKER_09]: Banned two prominent esports players for their toxic behavior in-game.

02:57:47.267 --> 02:57:50.828
[SPEAKER_09]: The peak harassment score placed the account among the worst players

02:57:52.089 --> 02:57:54.331
[SPEAKER_09]: 0.06 of all European accounts this month.

02:57:54.391 --> 02:57:55.792
[SPEAKER_09]: That was InVision's account.

02:57:56.152 --> 02:57:57.073
[SPEAKER_09]: He was banned.

02:57:57.674 --> 02:57:58.274
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

02:57:58.874 --> 02:57:59.615
[SPEAKER_09]: Good for them.

02:58:01.136 --> 02:58:03.058
[SPEAKER_09]: Be accountable for your attitude in games.

02:58:03.358 --> 02:58:05.120
[SPEAKER_09]: People want to be so anonymous.

02:58:05.220 --> 02:58:09.163
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been doing a lot of PvP and WoW this week, and I'll talk about this on Horde House, plug, plug, later.

02:58:09.643 --> 02:58:14.067
[SPEAKER_09]: But just some toxic fucking attitudes in these games that ruin it for everybody.

02:58:14.887 --> 02:58:20.432
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm really glad to hear that League of Legends is taking some drastic moves to eliminate that shit.

02:58:22.378 --> 02:58:29.220
[SPEAKER_09]: Also a tweet from Tiger Claw saying, games destigmatize violence, says a Connecticut governor.

02:58:29.840 --> 02:58:31.501
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's probably all that needs to be said about that.

02:58:31.521 --> 02:58:34.562
[SPEAKER_09]: Another politician putting their big ass foot in the conversation.

02:58:37.203 --> 02:58:47.606
[SPEAKER_09]: Lastly here, RawSteelUT, in light of how the media readily brought Manti Teo's dead girlfriend story, have any of you been fooled by fake stories?

02:58:48.046 --> 02:58:49.647
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm sure we have here on OLR.

02:58:49.867 --> 02:58:51.048
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it happens.

02:58:51.089 --> 02:58:53.732
[SPEAKER_09]: There'll be an article that spreads like wildfire.

02:58:54.232 --> 02:58:56.295
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't like to think we're breaking the news.

02:58:56.735 --> 02:59:00.439
[SPEAKER_09]: Once in a while, we get a little tip, but we try not to make a big deal out of it.

02:59:00.520 --> 02:59:03.944
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes we talk about a game called Disney Infinity.

02:59:04.024 --> 02:59:07.007
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a hidden secret for our listeners, and that's the way we want it to be.

02:59:07.888 --> 02:59:08.829
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

02:59:28.228 --> 02:59:38.431
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I'm sure back in the day when we were all younger, I'm sure some of us fell for the old EGM magazine pranks like that Shang Long was actually a character in Street Fighter.

02:59:38.551 --> 02:59:38.751
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

02:59:38.851 --> 02:59:40.631
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Ermac was actually in Mortal Kombat.

02:59:40.892 --> 02:59:41.052
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

02:59:41.152 --> 02:59:41.532
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sure.

02:59:41.612 --> 02:59:42.152
[SPEAKER_09]: Say that now.

02:59:43.038 --> 02:59:47.580
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I also worked in an arcade for a while, too, and could actually check some of these machines myself.

02:59:48.160 --> 02:59:52.622
[SPEAKER_09]: So you knew at that age how to go into the chips and actually look in the programming?

02:59:52.962 --> 02:59:53.983
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, I totally knew that.

02:59:54.043 --> 02:59:58.845
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Rob, what I knew is that usually on April 1st, there are going to be pranks done.

02:59:59.085 --> 03:00:00.906
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe a damn thing on April 1st.

03:00:00.926 --> 03:00:01.967
[SPEAKER_09]: They were in magazines.

03:00:02.007 --> 03:00:02.987
[SPEAKER_05]: Or in April editions.

03:00:03.047 --> 03:00:04.027
[SPEAKER_09]: And we were younger.

03:00:04.168 --> 03:00:05.768
[SPEAKER_09]: But they were the April editions.

03:00:05.888 --> 03:00:07.229
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but Rob, I'm special.

03:00:07.549 --> 03:00:08.529
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are no fun at all.

03:00:08.550 --> 03:00:09.430
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm special.

03:00:10.862 --> 03:00:12.143
[SPEAKER_09]: No fun zone, everybody.

03:00:12.163 --> 03:00:13.124
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why nobody's calling in.

03:00:13.164 --> 03:00:14.125
[SPEAKER_09]: They know it's a no fun zone.

03:00:14.685 --> 03:00:15.026
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

03:00:16.307 --> 03:00:17.728
[SPEAKER_09]: Last minute stories, Loki.

03:00:17.948 --> 03:00:18.309
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything?

03:00:18.729 --> 03:00:25.595
[SPEAKER_07]: Blockbuster UK has closed 160 of its stores because they're in administration right now.

03:00:26.396 --> 03:00:31.420
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of a repeat of what they did over here in the U.S.

03:00:33.562 --> 03:00:35.924
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a pretty cool THQ sale going on right now on Amazon.

03:00:36.084 --> 03:00:36.645
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get a...

03:00:37.445 --> 03:00:39.165
[SPEAKER_07]: A bunch of games for $25.

03:00:39.625 --> 03:00:40.086
[SPEAKER_07]: 19 games.

03:00:40.886 --> 03:00:45.787
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of which you probably have by now through the Humble Bundle or all the other Amazon sales that they've done.

03:00:46.027 --> 03:00:47.227
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I have a lot of these games.

03:00:47.927 --> 03:00:50.667
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I think I have all these games right now.

03:00:51.688 --> 03:00:52.728
[SPEAKER_07]: Except for Nexuiz.

03:00:52.748 --> 03:00:55.288
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have Nexuiz, but I'm not buying this for that.

03:00:56.369 --> 03:00:58.149
[SPEAKER_07]: MX versus ATV Reflex, I don't have that either.

03:01:00.049 --> 03:01:04.350
[SPEAKER_07]: Um... Sigh.

03:01:05.461 --> 03:01:07.383
[SPEAKER_07]: Starbreeze Storm That is it.

03:01:25.987 --> 03:01:26.508
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

03:01:27.048 --> 03:01:32.654
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess that's going to do it for OLR tonight.

03:01:32.694 --> 03:01:33.655
[SPEAKER_09]: No more calls coming in.

03:01:34.036 --> 03:01:34.576
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

03:01:35.217 --> 03:01:37.359
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody's too depressed about football.

03:01:37.479 --> 03:01:37.860
[SPEAKER_09]: I get it.

03:01:37.960 --> 03:01:38.320
[SPEAKER_09]: It's cool.

03:01:38.500 --> 03:01:44.487
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and the killer is dead is pretty awesome looking, which I mentioned about a year ago.

03:01:45.987 --> 03:01:55.490
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's the new Suda51 game and it kind of has that whole Killer7 vibe to it where it's all kind of cel-shaded and stuff but very bloody.

03:01:55.710 --> 03:02:00.831
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, you know, with some of the games that they did after Killer7, you know, it was kind of toned down.

03:02:00.871 --> 03:02:05.433
[SPEAKER_07]: They had the whole No More Heroes had kind of money spewing out of them instead of blood.

03:02:05.873 --> 03:02:06.673
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is definitely blood.

03:02:07.053 --> 03:02:09.234
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of blood and a guy with a big drill on his arm.

03:02:10.954 --> 03:02:11.874
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds like my kind of game.

03:02:12.114 --> 03:02:13.015
[SPEAKER_07]: He's Mr. Driller now.

03:02:13.515 --> 03:02:14.455
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Driller.

03:02:16.129 --> 03:02:18.150
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, that brings us to a close.

03:02:18.190 --> 03:02:23.054
[SPEAKER_09]: Another episode of Orange Lounge Radio, but not until we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

03:02:24.255 --> 03:02:27.717
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, of course, we always like to say thank you for downloading and checking out our show.

03:02:28.418 --> 03:02:29.278
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a free show.

03:02:29.819 --> 03:02:37.004
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't played a commercial for the same game 20 weeks in a row to try and, you know, we just, we pay a little bit out of pocket because it's our hobby, whatever.

03:02:37.524 --> 03:02:40.286
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, I've got to say, I do want to tip my hat

03:02:40.726 --> 03:02:45.670
[SPEAKER_09]: People have been very kind in a pay it forward kind of way where like, you know, we've just had some nice things donated.

03:02:45.690 --> 03:02:49.374
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Brad from PodCulture, all these mics you see were donated.

03:02:49.434 --> 03:02:54.398
[SPEAKER_09]: And we do get, you know, like Grandpa from Horde House gave a lot of money to VOG on our 10th anniversary.

03:02:54.678 --> 03:02:55.980
[SPEAKER_09]: Helped Kristen years ago.

03:02:56.720 --> 03:02:57.621
[SPEAKER_09]: It helped out a big way.

03:02:57.801 --> 03:02:59.883
[SPEAKER_04]: The soundboard, that's how we got to Pat.

03:03:00.103 --> 03:03:15.454
[SPEAKER_09]: so you know pay it forward is kind of the motto here not to you know bring up a cheesy movie from years ago but if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio just spread the word tell a friend or two about the show and help us spread the word about the show and that's all we ask thank you to everyone who bought me games

03:03:15.765 --> 03:03:17.466
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you to everybody who listened tonight.

03:03:17.846 --> 03:03:21.328
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether it be live or on the podcast, you guys rock.

03:03:21.428 --> 03:03:22.749
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you, Greg Proops.

03:03:24.070 --> 03:03:26.371
[SPEAKER_07]: And I still have Steam games to give away at some point.

03:03:26.971 --> 03:03:29.053
[SPEAKER_07]: I just haven't figured out how to do that yet.

03:03:30.493 --> 03:03:33.055
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, somewhere buried over there, I think I see it.

03:03:33.875 --> 03:03:36.237
[SPEAKER_07]: We still have the Migaran album to give away for something.

03:03:36.277 --> 03:03:38.378
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we need to just do like a big closeout around here.

03:03:38.874 --> 03:03:41.595
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

03:03:41.975 --> 03:03:43.596
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, you shut off the iPad.

03:03:43.616 --> 03:03:44.096
[SPEAKER_09]: You're good to go.

03:03:44.116 --> 03:03:45.156
[SPEAKER_09]: What's your final thought tonight?

03:03:45.256 --> 03:03:46.817
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to do a show on an iPad.

03:03:48.818 --> 03:03:49.858
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, your final thought tonight?

03:03:50.899 --> 03:03:53.099
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a new CD of music to listen to.

03:03:53.219 --> 03:04:02.863
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for all the inspiration, I guess, Dubstep Arena channel on Forza Horizon.

03:04:03.924 --> 03:04:05.864
[SPEAKER_07]: Although most of it's not really Dubstep.

03:04:05.904 --> 03:04:06.945
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just Electronica.

03:04:08.979 --> 03:04:12.560
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought for the night is why can Horde never win Isle of Conquest?

03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:13.901
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop being terrible, Horde.

03:04:13.961 --> 03:04:14.401
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate you.

03:04:15.261 --> 03:04:17.562
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

03:04:17.582 --> 03:04:19.842
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys very much for tuning in and supporting the show.

03:04:20.242 --> 03:04:22.043
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be back to do it all again next week.

03:04:22.323 --> 03:04:25.444
[SPEAKER_09]: So have a wonderful night and a wonderful week.

03:04:25.524 --> 03:04:25.884
