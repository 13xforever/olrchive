00:00.000 --> 00:17.800
DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki Tonight, January 20th, 2013, the final Rainfall

00:17.800 --> 00:23.180
game is set to come to the U.S. Sony plans to make a big sale, and Disney Infinity is

00:23.180 --> 00:31.740
finally officially unveiled.

00:31.740 --> 00:34.960
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.960 --> 00:37.220
where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.220 --> 00:45.720
It is Orange Lounge Radio with episode 490 of our show for this January the 20th of 2013.

00:45.720 --> 00:48.980
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next several hours to talk about

00:48.980 --> 00:54.780
video games and the gamer lifestyle along with those of you in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

00:54.780 --> 00:56.980
and the all important co-hosts here on the show.

00:56.980 --> 00:59.340
First off, say hello to Jamie Summers.

00:59.340 --> 01:00.700
I'm not in the kitchen.

01:00.700 --> 01:03.220
What are you doing out of the kitchen?

01:03.220 --> 01:04.220
Hosting a show.

01:04.220 --> 01:05.220
No wait, no.

01:05.220 --> 01:06.220
Hold on.

01:06.220 --> 01:07.220
Put the angry emails down.

01:07.220 --> 01:08.220
This is not a sexist joke.

01:08.220 --> 01:09.220
She was actually in the kitchen making coffee.

01:09.220 --> 01:10.220
Making coffee.

01:10.220 --> 01:11.220
Now I have- That's what she wanted.

01:11.220 --> 01:12.540
Chocolate mint creamer to go with my chocolate mint coffee.

01:12.540 --> 01:13.540
All right.

01:13.540 --> 01:14.540
There you go.

01:14.540 --> 01:15.540
Minty.

01:15.540 --> 01:16.540
Minty fresh.

01:16.540 --> 01:17.540
Just like tonight's show?

01:17.540 --> 01:18.540
I don't know.

01:19.100 --> 01:20.100
Minty fresh.

01:20.100 --> 01:21.100
Tech master Loki.

01:21.100 --> 01:22.100
Hi.

01:22.100 --> 01:23.100
Remember when fresh was a compliment?

01:23.100 --> 01:24.100
Yes.

01:24.100 --> 01:25.100
I remember the 90s.

01:25.100 --> 01:29.260
Like funky fresh or I always think of crescent fresh from Siffle and Ollie which was an underrated

01:29.260 --> 01:30.260
TV show.

01:30.260 --> 01:31.260
Siffle and Ollie?

01:31.260 --> 01:32.260
No.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.260
Siffle and Ollie.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.260
Not Siffle-less dark soccer.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.420
I wonder how their rebirth- Be quiet when you're in the kitchen.

01:35.420 --> 01:37.060
I wonder how their rebirth is doing.

01:37.060 --> 01:38.420
I say that because she doesn't have a mind.

01:38.420 --> 01:40.620
Because I remember like, hey, Siffle and Ollie are coming back.

01:40.620 --> 01:41.620
They're doing game reviews.

01:41.620 --> 01:42.620
Oh yeah.

01:42.620 --> 01:44.260
I forgot after the first episode.

01:44.260 --> 01:45.260
Yeah.

01:45.260 --> 01:46.260
Exactly.

01:46.260 --> 01:47.260
The first episode was funny though.

01:47.980 --> 01:50.660
See, I think maybe that's the type of thing you're just going to have to marathon during

01:50.660 --> 01:51.660
a weekend.

01:51.660 --> 01:53.620
Like, you know, some people marathon what?

01:53.620 --> 01:56.300
Game of Thrones or what else?

01:56.300 --> 01:58.260
What are the other big TV shows people watch?

01:58.260 --> 01:59.580
True Blood.

01:59.580 --> 02:02.540
If you're Jamie, Supernatural and only Jamie.

02:02.540 --> 02:03.540
Okay.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.540
Doctor Who.

02:04.540 --> 02:05.540
That's when a lot of people marathon.

02:05.540 --> 02:09.180
Once Upon a Time, my friends, which okay.

02:09.180 --> 02:11.180
Matt Cross.

02:11.180 --> 02:13.140
Actually, we did.

02:13.140 --> 02:17.020
We did actually have an anime night at my house kind of.

02:17.780 --> 02:20.460
We watched Matt Cross Do You Remember Love, but then we watched the live action Rurouni

02:20.460 --> 02:22.460
Kenshin movie and it was Amazeballs.

02:22.460 --> 02:23.460
Oh yeah.

02:23.460 --> 02:24.460
You invited me to come over and watch that.

02:24.460 --> 02:25.460
Yeah, but you said no.

02:25.460 --> 02:27.020
Well, we got stuck doing something else.

02:27.020 --> 02:28.020
Yeah.

02:28.020 --> 02:29.020
But Alan was working.

02:29.020 --> 02:30.020
The Rurouni Kenshin movie was Amazeballs.

02:30.020 --> 02:31.020
Was it?

02:31.020 --> 02:32.020
Yeah.

02:32.020 --> 02:33.020
Good times.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.020
All right.

02:34.020 --> 02:37.460
Well, again, we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock

02:37.460 --> 02:39.360
Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network.

02:39.360 --> 02:43.020
That is vognetwork.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:43.020 --> 02:46.220
And if you want to participate live with our show, join us.

02:46.220 --> 02:49.820
We have a live chat room, so if you do happen to be tuned in live tonight, make sure you're

02:49.820 --> 02:54.260
in the chat room to get the full experience, live.vognetwork.com.

02:54.260 --> 02:57.480
And it is possible to chat and multitask and do other things.

02:57.480 --> 02:58.620
We don't take offense.

02:58.620 --> 03:02.840
If you want to listen to the show, chat and play, I don't know, World of Warcraft or whatever

03:02.840 --> 03:03.840
computer game, Civ 5, whatever.

03:03.840 --> 03:06.900
But if you're watching sports ball, I'll shoot you.

03:06.900 --> 03:07.900
Stop it.

03:07.900 --> 03:08.900
That's disrespectful.

03:08.900 --> 03:09.900
With a rubber band.

03:09.900 --> 03:10.900
That's disrespectful.

03:10.900 --> 03:11.900
With a rubber band.

03:11.900 --> 03:15.980
Speaking of sports ball, there was no Bobby Black Wolf tonight because there was some

03:15.980 --> 03:18.500
big sports ball games going on.

03:18.500 --> 03:26.020
Ironically enough, our quote unquote local team, the San Francisco 49ers, even though

03:26.020 --> 03:30.340
they're a hundred miles away, it's the closest NFL team we have, playing his Atlanta Falcons

03:30.340 --> 03:31.720
and the Niners won.

03:31.720 --> 03:34.260
So I think they're all drowning their sorrows in beer right now.

03:34.260 --> 03:36.780
Dan calls them the 40 whiners.

03:36.780 --> 03:38.180
Why is that?

03:38.180 --> 03:39.180
I don't know.

03:39.180 --> 03:40.540
I hate sports ball.

03:40.540 --> 03:47.020
Well, when I first came into chat tonight, some of the chatters at live.vognetwork.com

03:47.020 --> 03:50.020
were like, oh, Rob's team defeats Bobby's team.

03:50.020 --> 03:51.020
And oh my gosh.

03:51.020 --> 03:52.020
I'm like, wait, wait, wait.

03:52.020 --> 03:53.020
No, no, no, no, no.

03:53.020 --> 03:54.020
Let's be clear.

03:54.020 --> 03:56.780
Just because the 49ers are local does not make them my team.

03:56.780 --> 03:59.420
First off, I'm not really big on football.

03:59.420 --> 04:03.100
I'm not going to sit here and say, you suck if you like football, because I don't believe

04:03.100 --> 04:04.100
that.

04:04.100 --> 04:05.260
Everybody's got their things that they're into.

04:05.260 --> 04:07.500
It's just more socially acceptable to be into football.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.500
Let's be real.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.660
When I make posts about like, oh, I'm so excited.

04:10.660 --> 04:12.520
Such and such got evicted from Big Brother.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.300
Everybody looks at me like weirdo.

04:14.300 --> 04:15.300
You damn weirdo.

04:15.300 --> 04:16.620
What's wrong with you?

04:16.620 --> 04:17.980
Well, or gaming.

04:17.980 --> 04:20.100
I want to talk about esports in a minute.

04:20.100 --> 04:21.520
Acid Vampire made me cry.

04:21.520 --> 04:27.180
But just to be clear, just to be clear, if I have a team, it is the Minnesota Vikings.

04:27.180 --> 04:29.300
And that's because of Chris Cluey.

04:29.300 --> 04:30.300
Let's Chris Cluey.

04:30.300 --> 04:31.300
Why?

04:31.300 --> 04:32.300
Who?

04:32.300 --> 04:33.300
Chris Cluey.

04:33.300 --> 04:36.180
He is the guy that wrote, he plays World of Warcraft for one.

04:36.180 --> 04:39.060
He's an NFL player that plays World of Warcraft for one, which makes him awesome.

04:39.060 --> 04:43.220
And two, he's the guy that wrote that, you know, profanity laced letter about the whole

04:43.220 --> 04:44.220
gay marriage thing.

04:44.220 --> 04:46.540
And like basically say you're an idiot if you don't support it.

04:46.540 --> 04:47.540
It's cool.

04:47.540 --> 04:48.540
Yeah.

04:48.540 --> 04:53.420
So, you know, I don't use this term very often, but like, he's like a bro.

04:53.420 --> 04:56.780
You know, Johnny apparently is spanking off to the show.

04:56.780 --> 04:57.780
What?

04:57.780 --> 04:58.780
What?

04:58.780 --> 05:03.340
Says, I can multitask with the show, watch Californication, laugh at jokes, bleeping

05:03.340 --> 05:04.700
off and listen to the show.

05:04.740 --> 05:08.820
He means nodding off because he doesn't want to offend us, not sodding off.

05:08.820 --> 05:09.820
All right.

05:09.820 --> 05:11.820
La la la la la.

05:11.820 --> 05:16.740
Anyhow, that, uh, little gem from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, what were you

05:16.740 --> 05:19.660
saying about a city vampire earlier, making you cry in chat?

05:19.660 --> 05:20.660
What was that about?

05:20.660 --> 05:21.660
He said the Firefly was overrated.

05:21.660 --> 05:25.060
So I said his butt was overrated.

05:25.060 --> 05:29.260
That's okay because, um, Brad, Brad from pod culture is taking care of it for me.

05:29.260 --> 05:30.260
Yes.

05:30.260 --> 05:34.660
You also can get mature responses like such in our chat room from a host nonetheless.

05:34.660 --> 05:38.980
Live.vognetwork.com again, Jamie, you said your butt is overrated.

05:38.980 --> 05:39.980
Is that what you said?

05:39.980 --> 05:46.020
But I say the same thing to my husband, except I tell him like, he'll be like, well, this,

05:46.020 --> 05:47.020
this song's kind of weird.

05:47.020 --> 05:51.860
It's like, well, your face is kind of weird, which just earns me a look.

05:51.860 --> 05:52.860
All right.

05:52.860 --> 05:53.860
So pun intended.

05:53.860 --> 05:57.980
The kickoff topic I wanted to talk about tonight was ports.

05:57.980 --> 05:58.980
Hold on.

05:58.980 --> 05:59.980
All right.

05:59.980 --> 06:01.260
Don't sit there and be all like, I met you.

06:01.260 --> 06:02.260
Your pun.

06:02.260 --> 06:03.260
Oh, okay.

06:03.260 --> 06:04.500
I am going to punish you.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.740
I thought you were, you were going on your tirade about football again.

06:06.740 --> 06:09.740
I'm like, no, I don't care.

06:09.740 --> 06:10.740
People like sports ball.

06:10.740 --> 06:17.980
If they want this, the Stanley goal, you know, if they want the, the, the, I don't know,

06:17.980 --> 06:21.220
the Uber league cup, they they're welcome to it.

06:21.220 --> 06:25.700
Well, how often have we talked about video games ought to be a sport and that topic comes

06:25.700 --> 06:26.700
up once in a while.

06:26.700 --> 06:27.700
I don't know.

06:27.700 --> 06:28.700
I don't know how people truly feel about that.

06:28.700 --> 06:33.020
Like I say, like we all say it, but maybe we don't like, you know, and I think about

06:33.020 --> 06:38.540
e-sports and that whole thing and it's still, e-sports still feels very like, I don't want

06:38.540 --> 06:43.740
to say underground because I do see it getting more and more visibility, but let's be real.

06:43.740 --> 06:49.340
They don't exactly televise star craft matches on NBC prime time or whatever.

06:49.340 --> 06:53.660
We're not really at that level yet, but you know, thanks to the internet and the internet

06:53.660 --> 06:57.940
is in many ways killing traditional broadcast mechanisms, right?

06:57.940 --> 07:03.380
I mean, ratings for once powerhouse TV shows like American idol or way down.

07:03.380 --> 07:07.020
And I think we have the internet today for a lot of that because, uh, you know, people

07:07.020 --> 07:09.340
watch their Netflix or people watch the things that they want to see.

07:09.340 --> 07:14.300
And some people prefer to watch these e-sports things and we've seen, you know, the online

07:14.300 --> 07:19.820
streaming solutions like Ustream, Justin TV, or excuse me, it's Twitch TV or whatever,

07:19.820 --> 07:23.820
all that stuff, uh, you know, is, is popular for the people who want to see it.

07:23.820 --> 07:28.100
Um, you know, you log into a site like Twitch that actually shows you like, this is the

07:28.100 --> 07:30.420
game that's being broadcast most of all.

07:30.420 --> 07:34.380
Do you guys know what game is broadcast more than any other on Twitch TV?

07:34.380 --> 07:36.020
The puppy bowl.

07:36.020 --> 07:40.860
I wish, seriously though, do you know what video game is broadcast more than any other

07:40.860 --> 07:41.860
on Twitch TV?

07:41.860 --> 07:42.860
Star craft?

07:42.860 --> 07:43.860
No.

07:43.860 --> 07:44.860
World of Warcraft?

07:44.860 --> 07:48.540
No, that, that world of Warcraft is number two.

07:48.540 --> 07:51.700
And usually when it's world of Warcraft, it's PVP, at least in my experience.

07:51.700 --> 07:55.780
I see way more PVP arena people doing that than anything else.

07:55.780 --> 08:00.420
League of Legends is the game that I see stream more than anything else on Twitch TV.

08:00.420 --> 08:04.020
So I just, you know, and that's a, that is, that game is built to be very competitive

08:04.020 --> 08:06.420
and that whole, like, um, what do they call it?

08:06.420 --> 08:12.660
The MOBA style games, which funny tangent, I actually downloaded League of Legends finally

08:12.660 --> 08:13.860
this weekend.

08:13.860 --> 08:15.100
I didn't get far enough.

08:15.100 --> 08:18.900
I played the little tutorial and then it got into picking a character and dah, dah, dah.

08:18.900 --> 08:22.460
And like, I literally had somewhere else to be, so I kind of stopped, but I am going

08:22.460 --> 08:23.460
to try.

08:23.460 --> 08:24.460
I have a long weekend.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.300
Let's do a lot of people, uh, this weekend from work.

08:26.300 --> 08:29.260
So I'm going to try and play a little more tomorrow because everybody always talks about

08:29.260 --> 08:31.260
League of Legends and it is free.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.140
So you know, why not?

08:33.140 --> 08:34.460
And I also have dota too.

08:34.460 --> 08:36.700
So it's like those MOBA games are becoming more and more.

08:36.700 --> 08:39.100
Do we have any chatters that are really into that stuff?

08:39.100 --> 08:45.580
Just out of curiosity, live.vognetwork.com, uh, Mako in our chat room says, what would

08:45.580 --> 08:46.580
be Mico?

08:46.580 --> 08:53.620
Mico says, watch today's Intel extreme masters finals was damn fantastic.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.540
I admit to being a sad man.

08:55.540 --> 08:57.380
Well, why is that sad?

08:57.380 --> 09:01.780
Is that really any different than the people that all gathered around and watched the football

09:01.780 --> 09:02.780
game?

09:02.780 --> 09:04.620
And I'm not calling either one sad.

09:04.620 --> 09:05.900
You're into whatever you're into.

09:05.900 --> 09:07.540
I'm calling all of it sad.

09:07.540 --> 09:08.540
I'm kidding.

09:08.540 --> 09:09.540
Yeah.

09:09.540 --> 09:10.980
And then you're going to go home and watch Supernatural.

09:10.980 --> 09:13.460
So you know, I'm actually way behind on Supernatural to be honest.

09:13.460 --> 09:14.460
No judgment here.

09:14.460 --> 09:15.660
None at all.

09:15.660 --> 09:18.060
And then you'll, then you'll post about it on Tumblr.

09:18.060 --> 09:24.140
Uh, I did however, finish Sherlock, a city vampire in our chair and says, sports will

09:24.140 --> 09:29.420
be more entertaining if the athletes were naked back in the day, the gladiator gladiator

09:29.420 --> 09:30.660
arenas back in the day.

09:30.660 --> 09:37.140
You know, I think the dangly bits are hilarious, so I'd just be busy laughing.

09:37.140 --> 09:39.180
I don't even know how to respond to that.

09:39.180 --> 09:44.340
Um, Rob can't even, oh, you know what, if you want to watch naked athletes, watch a

09:44.340 --> 09:50.060
wrestling, that would be your sport then, because let's be real in what other, there's

09:50.060 --> 09:54.340
only two sports I can think of where it's socially acceptable to run around in a speedo

09:54.340 --> 09:55.540
the whole time.

09:55.540 --> 09:57.900
One of them involves a swimming pool.

09:57.900 --> 09:59.760
The other one is wrestling.

09:59.760 --> 10:00.760
Think about it.

10:00.760 --> 10:10.300
Um, also in our chat room at live.vogna, which wrestlers wear cups, uh, SGA 100 Matt says

10:10.300 --> 10:13.860
league of legends and Korean star craft matches are broadcasted a lot.

10:13.860 --> 10:14.860
That's right.

10:14.860 --> 10:19.060
I wonder, what do you think it is about those types of games specifically that really draw

10:19.060 --> 10:20.360
people in?

10:20.360 --> 10:25.020
Why don't you see a lot of competitive music based games?

10:25.020 --> 10:27.980
I hardly ever see a lot of like competitions online about that.

10:27.980 --> 10:33.020
What is it about those games that you think really draws people into esports and watching

10:33.020 --> 10:34.020
all that online?

10:34.020 --> 10:40.500
Do you think it's because they're just designed to be that way?

10:40.500 --> 10:41.500
Any thoughts?

10:41.500 --> 10:44.780
I really honestly don't know what the appeal is.

10:44.780 --> 10:49.060
I mean, truly, I don't know what the appeal is and I can't even fathom what the appeal

10:49.060 --> 10:50.060
is.

10:50.060 --> 10:51.580
Well, to be fair, you haven't played it.

10:51.580 --> 10:56.860
Unless it's like, you know, fantasy football type of attraction, you know, where you can

10:56.860 --> 10:59.820
see your fantasy team play or whatever.

10:59.820 --> 11:01.820
I don't know.

11:01.820 --> 11:02.820
Logie?

11:02.820 --> 11:05.820
I don't know.

11:05.820 --> 11:08.060
We don't know why people get into this.

11:08.060 --> 11:12.980
Seriously, they tried to do a fantasy football league at my old job and they asked me, you

11:12.980 --> 11:15.260
know, to been in it and I was like, I don't know.

11:15.260 --> 11:16.260
That's all I said.

11:16.260 --> 11:18.420
One thing like watching, I don't know what that is.

11:18.420 --> 11:22.060
Like watching the esports stuff is just more kind of, I mean, it's fun to watch people

11:22.060 --> 11:23.060
play sometimes.

11:23.060 --> 11:26.380
Like I used to watch Arena on G4 and that was sort of esports stuff.

11:26.380 --> 11:31.180
I mean, I don't know how staged all that was, but it's basically, you know, two teams and

11:31.180 --> 11:32.180
a commentary.

11:32.180 --> 11:35.700
And that can be fun sometimes if it's a game you're interested in, like if they did a Grand

11:35.700 --> 11:40.900
Theft Auto, although, you know, they'd have to show me because I'm so fucking awesome.

11:40.900 --> 11:47.660
But hey, wait until five because no one plays anymore.

11:47.660 --> 11:49.500
What about competitive Minecraft?

11:49.500 --> 11:50.940
Although I guess that's not really a thing.

11:50.940 --> 11:51.940
It could be.

11:51.940 --> 11:52.940
It is a thing.

11:52.940 --> 11:53.940
Is it?

11:53.940 --> 11:54.940
No, it can be a thing.

11:54.940 --> 11:59.580
Well, competitive Minecraft, they have usually it's different game modes like the people

11:59.580 --> 12:00.580
set up.

12:00.580 --> 12:06.260
For example, I've watched videos of people just creating their own kind of games, like

12:06.260 --> 12:12.440
one of which, OK, everybody, we're going to throw you outside of this house and the first

12:12.440 --> 12:18.300
person to, was it the last person to survive is the winner or something like that.

12:18.300 --> 12:19.300
Like Minecraft Battle Royale?

12:19.300 --> 12:20.300
Sort of.

12:20.300 --> 12:22.580
And it was like it's basically a ton of monster zone.

12:22.580 --> 12:26.940
They gave them like very little weapons and it was just, OK, survive and whoever survives

12:26.940 --> 12:27.940
the longest.

12:27.940 --> 12:29.260
And they have like rounds and stuff that deal with that.

12:29.260 --> 12:30.260
And that's kind of entertaining.

12:30.940 --> 12:31.940
It really blows my mind.

12:31.940 --> 12:36.180
They haven't made a game out of battle royale or even like the Hunger Games they have on

12:36.180 --> 12:37.180
Minecraft.

12:37.180 --> 12:38.180
They have a Hunger Games servers.

12:38.180 --> 12:39.180
OK.

12:39.180 --> 12:40.180
All right.

12:40.180 --> 12:43.140
They actually do play the Hunger Games like that, where they all start off and it's basically

12:43.140 --> 12:48.540
everybody free for all and there's chess where they find stuff to help them survive.

12:48.540 --> 12:52.700
For the record, I'm not talking about that iPhone game that was like a platformer shooter

12:52.700 --> 12:53.700
based on.

12:53.700 --> 12:54.700
You know what I'm talking about.

12:54.700 --> 12:58.980
I mean, like, you know, strategize, find the weapons, find your opponents, that that whole

12:58.980 --> 12:59.980
type of thing.

13:00.700 --> 13:04.260
I know Marvel totally bit off battle royale specifically now because now there's like

13:04.260 --> 13:08.780
an Avengers battle royale comic where they've taken like little bit characters from all

13:08.780 --> 13:13.540
over the Marvel universe and make them basically kill each other off until there's one left.

13:13.540 --> 13:16.020
And the cover is totally a rip off the movie.

13:16.020 --> 13:19.860
Well, battle royale kind of gained a lot of popularity again, thanks to the Hunger Games.

13:19.860 --> 13:24.100
I mean, you know, obviously, a lot of people saw the similarities and so forth.

13:24.100 --> 13:29.180
But I heard at one point the CW was kicking around a battle royale show.

13:29.180 --> 13:30.180
It's gone.

13:30.180 --> 13:32.300
They are not moving forward with it.

13:32.300 --> 13:35.500
That would definitely, I would totally watch it.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.580
They said, hold on, guys.

13:36.580 --> 13:38.740
It was nothing more than like an idea we kicked around.

13:38.740 --> 13:39.740
But still, what an odd TV show.

13:39.740 --> 13:44.300
Yeah, we can't put that out now that there's kids dying, you know, in the news.

13:44.300 --> 13:46.940
I think it would make a great TV show as a drama.

13:46.940 --> 13:55.260
I mean, I'm really surprised nobody's tried to pitch a like a literal Hunger Games reality

13:55.260 --> 13:56.260
show.

13:56.260 --> 13:57.260
Obviously, no death.

13:57.260 --> 13:58.260
Paintball?

13:58.260 --> 14:01.940
Paintballs or, you know, non lethal types of things like, you know, silly things of

14:01.940 --> 14:07.140
your beatings and nerf the Nerf Hunger Games.

14:07.140 --> 14:08.140
They have laser.

14:08.140 --> 14:09.140
I watch that.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.140
The Nerfing games.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.140
There you go.

14:11.140 --> 14:12.140
I'd even watch that.

14:12.140 --> 14:15.100
You know, they need to bring back laser tag.

14:15.100 --> 14:16.420
Yes.

14:16.420 --> 14:17.420
Except not the bad cartoon.

14:17.420 --> 14:18.420
Is that a TV show?

14:18.420 --> 14:19.420
Yeah.

14:19.420 --> 14:20.420
There's a bad laser tag cartoon.

14:20.420 --> 14:21.420
Huh?

14:21.420 --> 14:25.260
Well, I was I thought they actually had laser tag on TV.

14:25.260 --> 14:26.700
I never thought they actually had it on TV.

14:27.140 --> 14:28.140
The commercial.

14:28.140 --> 14:29.140
No, no.

14:29.140 --> 14:30.140
Back in the 90s.

14:30.140 --> 14:31.140
They kind of had else.

14:31.140 --> 14:32.140
You can see the 80s cartoons.

14:32.140 --> 14:35.340
You can see all sorts of weird shit on in the morning in the 90s, you know, and.

14:35.340 --> 14:41.620
Well, now you just see all sorts of weird shit on after midnight on Adult Swim.

14:41.620 --> 14:45.580
There's a big difference, though, between Adventure Time, which is great.

14:45.580 --> 14:46.580
Don't get me wrong.

14:46.580 --> 14:47.580
I love it.

14:47.580 --> 14:51.060
There's a big difference between that and like Fun House.

14:51.060 --> 14:52.060
Okay.

14:52.060 --> 14:54.860
Tiger class says they should do a survivor for kids.

14:54.860 --> 14:56.220
They did.

14:56.740 --> 15:00.740
It was called Lord of the Flies.

15:00.740 --> 15:02.020
No, but they did.

15:02.020 --> 15:03.020
They did.

15:03.020 --> 15:05.780
It was like, was it Eco-Challenge or something like that?

15:05.780 --> 15:07.220
They did have one for kids.

15:07.220 --> 15:08.780
It was survivor for kids.

15:08.780 --> 15:12.700
But I it was obviously a lot different, like because, you know, obviously you don't want

15:12.700 --> 15:14.380
to do the psychological trauma with kids.

15:14.380 --> 15:20.020
But there was I think it was mostly physical based like like Guts.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.020
Guts was awesome.

15:21.020 --> 15:22.020
Right.

15:22.020 --> 15:24.340
I liked the announcer.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.700
I'm hoping somebody in chat will remember the name of that show.

15:26.700 --> 15:27.700
I need it.

15:27.700 --> 15:28.700
I need a reality TV nerd.

15:28.700 --> 15:30.380
If like Shane's listening, he might remember.

15:30.380 --> 15:31.860
He'll know what show I'm talking about.

15:31.860 --> 15:34.180
I don't remember what network it was on.

15:34.180 --> 15:35.180
SSJ 100.

15:35.180 --> 15:38.940
Matt says American Gladiators was the closest we had to that type of thing.

15:38.940 --> 15:40.980
You know what happened with that reboot?

15:40.980 --> 15:46.580
I was so excited because like American Gladiators was such bad ass TV back when we were growing

15:46.580 --> 15:47.580
up.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.460
It was like it was so just brain gone.

15:50.460 --> 15:51.460
It doesn't matter.

15:51.460 --> 15:52.780
It's just errors.

15:52.780 --> 15:55.320
It was watching for the love of God.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.480
It was.

15:56.480 --> 15:59.780
Can you have a game show without all the reality bullshit tied to it?

15:59.780 --> 16:00.980
I mean, that's everything nowadays.

16:00.980 --> 16:03.780
It's like trying to get in the head of the contestant and like, let's find out about

16:03.780 --> 16:04.780
their life.

16:04.780 --> 16:05.780
I don't care what you like.

16:05.780 --> 16:06.780
I want to see them play a game.

16:06.780 --> 16:07.780
And that's it.

16:07.780 --> 16:11.580
All I need to know about them is their name is Bob and they're from Detroit or something

16:11.580 --> 16:12.580
like that.

16:12.580 --> 16:13.580
That's it.

16:13.580 --> 16:14.580
And they're a firefighter.

16:14.580 --> 16:15.580
Whatever.

16:15.580 --> 16:16.580
And there they were in the military.

16:16.580 --> 16:17.580
You know, that type of thing.

16:17.580 --> 16:18.580
That's all we need to know.

16:18.580 --> 16:19.580
Yeah.

16:19.580 --> 16:20.580
I think it just didn't work in primetime.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.420
American Gladiator just came back as like a primetime show.

16:23.420 --> 16:26.680
Like, you know, and it's just like, no, this is the type of thing that's meant to be like

16:26.680 --> 16:27.680
Saturday at four o'clock.

16:27.680 --> 16:28.680
I've already found the best show.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.460
They need, what they need to do is take reality TV and just give it all to Canada because

16:31.460 --> 16:34.080
Canada does it right.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.080
Canada does it right.

16:35.080 --> 16:37.300
I am addicted to Canada's worst drivers.

16:37.300 --> 16:38.700
OK.

16:38.700 --> 16:42.780
Shane is asking, is it the CBS one that had the kids living in the town?

16:42.780 --> 16:43.780
Kid Nation?

16:43.780 --> 16:45.180
No, I forgot about that one.

16:45.180 --> 16:49.960
That one got a lot of shit because it was like really psychologically damaging to those

16:49.960 --> 16:50.960
kids.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.180
There was another one.

16:52.180 --> 16:53.920
It was on cable.

16:53.920 --> 16:54.920
It was on.

16:54.920 --> 16:59.240
I don't think it was on Nickelodeon, but like Discovery Kids or something.

16:59.240 --> 17:00.240
Somebody's got to know this.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.400
I will look it up on Wikipedia, dammit.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.040
All right.

17:04.040 --> 17:07.160
I guess we'll move into how was your gaming week?

17:07.160 --> 17:09.960
This way I can answer this question by looking.

17:09.960 --> 17:13.440
Somebody's listening to the podcast, not live this week, going, I know the name of the show.

17:13.440 --> 17:14.440
It was.

17:14.440 --> 17:15.440
All right.

17:15.440 --> 17:16.800
Let's go to Dark Sakura.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.000
And how was your gaming week?

17:18.040 --> 17:20.880
I played Minecraft last night for for four hours.

17:20.880 --> 17:21.880
Wow.

17:21.880 --> 17:22.880
What a what the turnaround.

17:22.880 --> 17:23.880
Jamie's me.

17:23.880 --> 17:27.200
Remember when you used to sit here on the show and say Minecraft's stupid.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.360
I didn't say it was stupid.

17:28.360 --> 17:31.400
I just said I wouldn't play it until someone paid for me, too.

17:31.400 --> 17:34.080
And now that someone paid for me, too, that I'm playing it.

17:34.080 --> 17:39.760
But I was busy working on my underground lair, which apparently Loki hasn't found yet.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.200
I haven't really been playing that.

17:41.200 --> 17:46.520
I've been see like I've been trying to do things that involve my brain in not the same

17:46.520 --> 17:47.520
way Minecraft doesn't.

17:47.520 --> 17:50.240
But it's just like I don't really know what I want to do with it right now.

17:50.240 --> 17:53.440
And so I've been trying to do other things, but then my brain gets too tired.

17:53.440 --> 17:58.200
So I play like dumb games like Skyrim with a ton of mods on it.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.160
It's really unstable now, too.

18:00.160 --> 18:02.520
Well, I was just doing other stuff.

18:02.520 --> 18:05.400
So that's why I was playing Minecraft while I was doing other things.

18:05.400 --> 18:09.780
But it's just sort of nice to sit back and have something mindless to sort of work on

18:09.780 --> 18:15.040
that's a little creative and trying not to hit those guys that explode.

18:15.040 --> 18:16.040
I hate them.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.440
Because most of my houses are made out of glass.

18:18.440 --> 18:20.800
My roofs are made out of glass.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.960
I've got this whole network of underground tunnels built.

18:23.960 --> 18:25.940
And I seriously have a mole village.

18:25.940 --> 18:28.120
People can come live in my mole village if they want to.

18:28.120 --> 18:30.320
I finally put a bed in my house.

18:30.320 --> 18:32.760
Can you play whack-a-mole in your mole village?

18:32.760 --> 18:33.760
No.

18:33.760 --> 18:35.840
And I did play a little WoW.

18:35.840 --> 18:37.880
I'm trying to get back into WoW.

18:37.880 --> 18:41.480
I played some Mass Effect 3, but that's just because I was playing around with more of

18:41.480 --> 18:44.400
the mods and I think I'm close to getting Flycam working.

18:44.400 --> 18:47.780
Are you going to get into the whole...

18:47.780 --> 18:49.240
The name slipped my mind.

18:49.240 --> 18:51.360
When they make the movies out of video games.

18:51.360 --> 18:52.360
Machinima.

18:52.360 --> 18:53.360
Thank you.

18:53.360 --> 18:54.360
Machinima.

18:54.360 --> 18:55.360
Are you going to get into the whole Machinima thing?

18:55.360 --> 18:57.080
No, but on my Mass Effect-ing Tumblr.

18:57.080 --> 18:58.080
That's like your...

18:58.080 --> 18:59.080
That's why I ask.

18:59.080 --> 19:01.440
Because your Mass Effect-ing Tumblr, you're making still pictures.

19:01.440 --> 19:02.440
That's kind of like getting your big toe in the door.

19:02.440 --> 19:04.200
I'm doing Lull Effect is what it's called.

19:04.200 --> 19:05.200
Lull Effect.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.200
Is that like a thing?

19:06.200 --> 19:07.200
It's not just you, it's a bunch of other people?

19:07.200 --> 19:09.200
Other people have done it, but now I'm making it a thing.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.840
What if it's not very funny though?

19:10.840 --> 19:11.880
A lot of people think it is.

19:11.880 --> 19:14.040
So I've got 103 followers now.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.040
Wow.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.400
How come we can't get that many people listening to the show?

19:17.400 --> 19:18.400
Shut up.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.800
Does this show need Lull Effect?

19:19.800 --> 19:20.800
It needs more Mass Effect.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.800
Tell a Mass Effect joke.

19:22.800 --> 19:23.800
Caden.

19:23.800 --> 19:24.800
Get out.

19:24.800 --> 19:33.080
But I've also started doing this other thing that I call Shepherd and Tumblr.

19:33.080 --> 19:36.880
I've done three versions now where one of them is like Shepherd looking at Tumblr on

19:36.880 --> 19:37.880
a data pad.

19:37.880 --> 19:42.600
And I've exploded it now to where Shepherd was looking at pictures of cats on Google.

19:42.600 --> 19:46.560
And then I have another one where Shepherd's looking at Grumpy Cat.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.640
It's actually one of the last ones I posted on Mass Effect.

19:48.640 --> 19:51.280
And that's what people post on Tumblr.

19:51.280 --> 19:53.760
Pictures of Shepherd looking at cats.

19:53.760 --> 19:58.800
But that's on Mass Effect because most of Tumblr is built off of Lull Cats and the Grumpy

19:58.800 --> 19:59.800
Cat.

19:59.800 --> 20:00.800
So I did a Grumpy Cat one.

20:00.800 --> 20:01.800
And tits.

20:01.800 --> 20:02.800
And tits.

20:02.800 --> 20:06.280
I found the funniest one because I also reblog a lot of funny fan comics.

20:06.280 --> 20:11.120
And one of them is Tali saying, Shepherd, grab my boobs, and it's broship going honk.

20:11.120 --> 20:16.480
And then it's flying off in the air going pilgrimage.

20:16.480 --> 20:18.760
That's pretty much Tumblr in a nutshell.

20:18.760 --> 20:19.760
So that's what I've been doing.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.880
Oh, that and politics, but whatever.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.240
SSU 100, Matt, you disappoint me.

20:24.240 --> 20:27.440
You need to finish Mass Effect 3.

20:27.440 --> 20:30.040
You do it with the extended cut.

20:30.040 --> 20:35.880
So I've also been doing that and trying to get back into limbo, but I've just really

20:35.880 --> 20:36.880
been busy.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.280
I start school this week and my class is all online.

20:38.280 --> 20:42.800
But hey, if anyone wants me to design them a website, I can do it for school credit.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.280
All right.

20:44.280 --> 20:48.280
So J-links remembered the show I was trying to think of.

20:48.280 --> 20:49.280
Endurance.

20:49.280 --> 20:50.280
Thank you, Tigerclaw.

20:50.280 --> 20:52.560
Endurance was the name of Survivor for kids.

20:52.560 --> 20:56.020
It was on NBC and then moved to Discovery Kids and I had the kids all split up into

20:56.020 --> 20:59.560
teams and it was just, you know, they did all this.

20:59.560 --> 21:03.200
Who could survive the longest before their bedtime?

21:03.200 --> 21:04.280
Moving on.

21:04.280 --> 21:07.560
I just had to put that to rest, that discussion from earlier.

21:07.560 --> 21:10.400
All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

21:10.400 --> 21:11.800
My gaming week was OK.

21:11.800 --> 21:15.840
I played a few things that some new things, I guess.

21:15.840 --> 21:20.400
I tried out the MOGA with the free game that came with it.

21:20.400 --> 21:29.320
The what is it, Modern Combat 4, you know, the complete rip off of Call of Duty by Gameloft.

21:29.320 --> 21:31.400
It was OK.

21:32.120 --> 21:36.760
I'm not a huge fan of the MOGA controller, like the first one they put out.

21:36.760 --> 21:40.360
Their new one that they showed at CES, the one that's full size, I think it'll be a little

21:40.360 --> 21:46.520
bit better because, once again, it's kind of like the Vita controls.

21:46.520 --> 21:52.080
It's cool that they have dual analog sticks and stuff, but it's just not the same as like

21:52.080 --> 21:53.400
a console controller.

21:53.400 --> 21:55.840
It's a little bit cramped, I guess.

21:55.840 --> 21:59.560
But it worked all right and it was kind of fun until my wife said, what the hell are

21:59.560 --> 22:00.560
you doing?

22:00.600 --> 22:03.440
We went over to her parents' house and she's like, well, you should bring something to

22:03.440 --> 22:04.440
do.

22:04.440 --> 22:05.440
I'm like, OK.

22:05.440 --> 22:06.440
So I brought something to do.

22:06.440 --> 22:09.320
And of course, she did not, even though she asked me to.

22:09.320 --> 22:14.880
And so I brought that and she's like, is that a controller for your phone?

22:14.880 --> 22:18.240
Are you addicted to games or something?

22:18.240 --> 22:21.400
You have that so that it's easier to play games on your phone?

22:21.400 --> 22:24.720
I'm like, yeah, because I got it for free.

22:24.720 --> 22:31.840
And yes, it is easier to play games like that on my phone.

22:31.840 --> 22:32.840
It's not bad.

22:32.840 --> 22:33.840
It's pretty cool.

22:33.840 --> 22:38.800
If I want to play a game like that, it's a hell of a lot better than virtual sticks and

22:38.800 --> 22:40.560
stuff on the actual screen.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.760
So it worked out pretty cool.

22:42.760 --> 22:46.160
What else did they play?

22:46.160 --> 22:47.160
Oh, yeah.

22:47.160 --> 22:51.960
More Skyrim on Steam with all my mods in there, although I'm going to start having to scale

22:51.960 --> 22:58.160
back on some of those mods, because I'm running into crashing problems where it'll just dump

22:58.160 --> 23:00.000
me for no apparent reason.

23:00.000 --> 23:09.920
I can't build a forge at my house in Hearthfire because, I don't know, it just will crash

23:09.920 --> 23:10.920
for no reason.

23:10.920 --> 23:14.320
I'm not really sure why, but it's only one to build a forge.

23:14.320 --> 23:17.120
And just some other weird stuff.

23:17.120 --> 23:18.120
Like there's one I have.

23:18.120 --> 23:21.440
It's called Midas Magic, which adds a bunch of different magic spells that they created

23:21.440 --> 23:22.600
for the game.

23:22.600 --> 23:29.440
The problem is, they have this thing that you put items in to craft these spells in

23:29.440 --> 23:37.920
the Riverwood Trader, and when it creates a spell, the spell book is marked as steel.

23:37.920 --> 23:42.640
And so you can't get the book without pissing everybody off.

23:42.640 --> 23:47.680
And so the first spell I got, I'm like, okay, I'm going to turn invisible, I'm going to

23:47.680 --> 23:52.880
sneak, and be invisible, and I'm going to grab the spell really quick, use the spell,

23:52.880 --> 23:54.440
and then maybe they won't notice anything.

23:54.440 --> 23:57.120
Nope, they all tried to murder me instead.

23:57.120 --> 24:00.280
Which I mean, it's just a minor inconvenience because none of them can actually kill me,

24:00.280 --> 24:05.320
but I just don't want to have to kill them, because that would be terrible, all these

24:05.320 --> 24:10.440
quests I'll miss because I'm going to have to go kill all of them.

24:10.440 --> 24:17.480
Then other games I played, I played one of the other games I backed on Kickstarter, the

24:17.480 --> 24:19.240
Gianna Sisters game.

24:19.240 --> 24:21.020
Oh yeah, how is that?

24:21.020 --> 24:23.760
I have that from the Steam sale, still waiting to be played.

24:23.760 --> 24:26.920
It's pretty cool actually, I do enjoy it.

24:26.920 --> 24:31.120
Played it with an Xbox 360 controller, and it's a pretty awesome platformer.

24:31.120 --> 24:35.800
I'm digging it, I tried it for a little bit and I was like, eh, I don't really want to

24:35.800 --> 24:39.280
play this anymore, so I went back to Skyrim, but I liked it, I thought it was a pretty

24:39.280 --> 24:40.280
cool game.

24:40.280 --> 24:45.560
And then a new game I played on consoles this week, Forza Horizon, actually got into that

24:45.560 --> 24:46.560
a bit.

24:46.840 --> 24:50.880
Welcome to the cult of Forza Horizon, congratulations.

24:50.880 --> 24:54.760
So I played that a bit, and it's fun.

24:54.760 --> 24:58.520
First order of business is I drove on all the roads so I can get that achievement, and

24:58.520 --> 25:01.160
I hit all the signs, so now I get free upgrades.

25:01.160 --> 25:03.120
Did you look online to see where all the signs were?

25:03.120 --> 25:04.120
No.

25:04.120 --> 25:05.120
Oh, while you were driving?

25:05.120 --> 25:06.120
Yeah, I was driving all the roads.

25:06.120 --> 25:08.000
I haven't even done that yet.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.520
There was a couple that I couldn't find right away, and then I was like, okay, looking at

25:11.520 --> 25:15.520
the map and kind of, okay, there's probably something right here, I mean it's pretty obvious

25:15.520 --> 25:17.400
where they're hiding some of them.

25:17.400 --> 25:19.240
What did you think of the whole introduction and the setup, though?

25:19.240 --> 25:23.920
Did you have the same reaction I did, where it's like, these rich spoiled brats?

25:23.920 --> 25:25.560
Like, that was my reaction.

25:25.560 --> 25:28.520
Not even that, but there's some things that are annoying me about it.

25:28.520 --> 25:34.280
It's like, I'll still get radio chatter where it's like, hey, did you see that such a such

25:34.280 --> 25:38.760
person has those signs out there, and if you hit them you'll get this guy like, I fucking

25:38.760 --> 25:41.680
know because I hit all of them already, you stupid bitch.

25:41.680 --> 25:44.200
I don't need you telling me this over and over again.

25:44.200 --> 25:45.200
Or like, you know.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.400
I think it's just randomized, Logan, it's not that serious.

25:47.400 --> 25:51.000
Yeah, I understand, but they should shut that off if you've hit all the signs, or if you

25:51.000 --> 25:55.360
know you hit a couple of signs, you should, they should shut that off.

25:55.360 --> 25:58.440
Are you really gonna razz the game because some radio lady didn't know you hit all the

25:58.440 --> 25:59.440
signs?

25:59.440 --> 26:07.840
Well then, and also like, hey, hey, you haven't shown up to my wonderful showcase event, and

26:07.840 --> 26:10.560
it's like, do you not like making money?

26:10.560 --> 26:14.520
I mean, it's like, fucking stop bothering me, you stupid bitch, I don't wanna do your

26:14.520 --> 26:15.520
fucking event.

26:15.520 --> 26:20.200
I don't wanna race a, it's like, dude, like, and then the radio answer's hilarious, like,

26:20.200 --> 26:24.200
he's all, dude, they have an event where you race a hot air balloon.

26:24.200 --> 26:28.160
I'm sorry, but if I heard of like, this event I could go to to watch a car race a hot air

26:28.160 --> 26:31.680
balloon, that'd be fucking boring, because hot air balloons are not fast.

26:31.680 --> 26:34.000
It's a fun race, have you done the race yet?

26:34.000 --> 26:38.800
Yes, I did the race, but hot air balloons are not known for their speed, okay?

26:38.800 --> 26:39.800
It's just a hot air balloon.

26:39.800 --> 26:42.240
Despite your snark, how do you really feel about the game?

26:42.240 --> 26:43.240
It's alright.

26:43.240 --> 26:47.560
It's a great game, it's like kind of Burnout Paradise Light, I guess, you know, that's

26:47.560 --> 26:48.560
pretty much it.

26:48.560 --> 26:51.960
You need to play some online, it's fun.

26:51.960 --> 26:52.960
I'm sure it is.

26:52.960 --> 26:55.720
One of these nights, we're gonna fill up a race with all VOG people, that's gonna be

26:55.720 --> 26:56.720
interesting.

26:56.720 --> 26:58.400
And I'll probably still get last place.

26:58.400 --> 27:05.280
Well, I had to go into multiplayer to do some of my, the speed trap things, because fucking

27:05.280 --> 27:11.160
caravan, like, always being from, goddamn minivan, just like, there, like, I'm flying

27:11.160 --> 27:16.400
over the hill, like, four, like, you know, 160 miles an hour, goddamn minivan right there,

27:16.400 --> 27:22.480
like, every time, just like some stupid, like, Volkswagen Beetle or something, it's just

27:22.480 --> 27:23.480
like, boom!

27:23.480 --> 27:28.000
So what, you, you go into the world Rome mode with other people?

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
You don't do racing?

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
By myself.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Oh.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Well, no, I have been doing racing.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
I haven't really been racing too much at the events, because I did, I did a lot of the

27:36.000 --> 27:39.400
challenges and I got, you know, money from that, and then I bought some cars, and then

27:39.400 --> 27:43.920
I, I said, hey, I'm gonna go beat everybody's scores on these things, and so I did that

27:43.920 --> 27:48.560
for a lot of it, and kept racing back and forth, so I'm a Lamborghini.

27:48.560 --> 27:52.640
A sitting vampire in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, racing a hot air balloon?

27:52.640 --> 27:53.640
The hell?

27:53.640 --> 27:54.640
Yep, that's a thing.

27:54.640 --> 27:55.640
You race airplanes too.

27:55.640 --> 27:59.640
Airplanes and apparently a helicopter, according to the radio, but I haven't done that yet.

27:59.640 --> 28:04.600
Airplanes thing, man, some of that stuff pisses me off, because those cars handle, like,

28:04.600 --> 28:05.600
crap.

28:05.600 --> 28:11.240
Or like, I don't know, hey, let's race this Lamborghini on a dirt track, I mean, that

28:11.240 --> 28:16.640
doesn't make any sense, or, or some of the ones where they're like, I want you to show

28:16.640 --> 28:20.520
off for the people, and you have to do these cool, you know, you have to get, like, twenty

28:20.520 --> 28:24.980
eight thousand points by driving down the street, it's like, how the fuck do I do that?

28:24.980 --> 28:26.960
Have you played a lot with the customization mode?

28:26.960 --> 28:31.400
Brad from Pod Culture in our chat room reminding us the creation mode in Forza is fantastic.

28:31.400 --> 28:32.400
It is very good.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.780
I don't know if you've played around a lot with the, like, you know, decal making and

28:34.780 --> 28:35.780
all that.

28:35.780 --> 28:36.780
Yeah, I have, I mean.

28:36.780 --> 28:38.300
Oh, yeah, you made, like, an Orange Lodge radio car, didn't you?

28:38.300 --> 28:39.940
Yeah, I have an Orange Lodge radio car.

28:39.940 --> 28:40.940
That's nice.

28:40.940 --> 28:42.780
Well, I haven't finished it yet, but I've got that started.

28:42.780 --> 28:47.340
So Bobby made a VoG car, you made an OLR car, I think Brad made a Pod Culture car, we need

28:47.340 --> 28:48.340
to, like.

28:48.340 --> 28:49.980
I have to have a garis car.

28:49.980 --> 28:52.500
You could do, you could make a garis car, probably.

28:52.500 --> 28:56.620
Is it interesting how to do it, I mean, it's a lot of just, you have to manipulate the

28:56.620 --> 28:59.260
shapes that they give you to make stuff.

28:59.260 --> 29:03.740
I bet somebody else already made, I know there's N7 cars all over the place, that's easy.

29:03.740 --> 29:05.700
Someone made a Tali car, but it wasn't very good.

29:05.700 --> 29:08.580
But actually, like, instead of just, like, writing out Orange Lodge radio, I actually

29:08.580 --> 29:12.140
pulled out my old business card, which is completely useless now since the phone number

29:12.140 --> 29:14.980
and websites are all incorrect.

29:14.980 --> 29:20.100
But I actually recreated the logo that was on there using just boxes.

29:20.100 --> 29:21.100
Very cool.

29:21.100 --> 29:25.740
All right, anything else for your gaming week?

29:25.740 --> 29:28.740
I, uh, Call of Duty, I'm sure I played a little bit of that in Borderlands.

29:28.740 --> 29:33.220
I think we restarted Borderlands on true Vault Hunter mode, and we're kind of back up to

29:33.220 --> 29:37.740
where we were before, when we first started playing co-op, but I was kind of pissed off

29:37.740 --> 29:42.260
at that because I tried, you know, we were trying to go back into the game and do all

29:42.260 --> 29:46.700
the side missions and the original difficulty, and it's like, hey, you've unlocked this true

29:46.700 --> 29:48.340
Vault Hunter mode, do you want to do that now?

29:48.340 --> 29:52.220
I'm like, yeah, sure, whatever, let's bump up the difficulty and, you know, we can go

29:52.220 --> 29:55.900
back there and it's like, well, if you decide to, you can change it later on in these settings

29:55.900 --> 29:56.900
or whatever.

29:56.900 --> 30:01.380
I'm like, okay, can't find the settings anywhere for that, and now that I'm in true Vault Hunter

30:01.380 --> 30:06.460
mode, my game restarted, except I have all my weapons and, like, I'm still level, you

30:06.460 --> 30:11.420
know, 50, but it's still annoying, I was like, god damn, I, you know, I was gonna do all

30:11.420 --> 30:16.620
these side missions, now I just have to do them in this, now, I guess, it'll be a little

30:16.620 --> 30:17.620
bit harder.

30:17.620 --> 30:22.620
So I haven't downloaded any of the DLC, and I probably won't, maybe, you know, because

30:22.620 --> 30:26.780
my friend's playing with me and I don't want to buy two copies of them, so that would be

30:26.780 --> 30:27.780
annoying.

30:27.780 --> 30:28.780
All right, is that it?

30:28.780 --> 30:29.780
That's it.

30:30.180 --> 30:33.580
Um, not a whole lot of new stuff, in fact, revisiting old stuff.

30:33.580 --> 30:37.860
As far as new stuff goes, there's some iOS games, um, Final Fantasy All the Bravest,

30:37.860 --> 30:41.180
a lot of you guys have been reading about this on the internet, it's kind of controversial.

30:41.180 --> 30:44.180
I don't want to spoil my thoughts too much, because I actually wrote them down for a VoG

30:44.180 --> 30:48.100
article that I'm going to post tomorrow after all the podcasts go up, uh, with some other

30:48.100 --> 30:49.940
articles, there's some content going up next week.

30:49.940 --> 30:50.940
Promises, promises.

30:50.940 --> 30:51.940
Yeah, I know.

30:51.940 --> 30:58.580
Uh, but, uh, yeah, Final Fantasy All the Bravest, um, interesting, that's all I'm going to say,

30:58.580 --> 30:59.580
for now.

30:59.580 --> 31:00.580
Stay tuned.

31:00.580 --> 31:03.460
Uh, but I will talk a little more in depth about Temple Run 2.

31:03.460 --> 31:07.060
Sequel to Temple Run, which, uh, has inspired a lot of knockoffs and so forth.

31:07.060 --> 31:11.580
Temple Run 2 looks gorgeous on my iPad 3 Retina, I gotta say, for a free game.

31:11.580 --> 31:16.940
Uh, Temple Run's a really great time killer, and, uh, it's funny because this game gets

31:16.940 --> 31:20.420
compared to Pitfall and back and forth when the two games are kind of ripping each other

31:20.420 --> 31:21.420
off.

31:21.420 --> 31:25.960
I would say Pitfall, uh, and I'm talking about the iOS remake of Pitfall, not, or re-imagining

31:25.960 --> 31:29.600
of Pitfall, let's be real, not the classic, classic Atari game.

31:29.600 --> 31:33.920
Um, Pitfall really, the re-imagining really jacked a lot from the original Temple Run,

31:33.920 --> 31:37.520
but it is kind of neat that Temple Run 2 also kind of went the route of the mine cars and

31:37.520 --> 31:38.520
so forth.

31:38.520 --> 31:42.080
I think it looks really good, uh, and it's, uh, addicting to play, and, and they kind

31:42.080 --> 31:46.560
of changed the, you know, freemium elements of it, and it's, it's a little more compelling

31:46.560 --> 31:48.600
than Pitfall, in my opinion.

31:48.600 --> 31:52.440
So yeah, Temple Run 2, good times.

31:52.440 --> 31:56.560
Um, otherwise, as far as, like, PC and consoles go, not a lot of new stuff.

31:56.560 --> 32:00.760
I have Assassin's Creed 3 from the rental company ready to play, but I didn't get around

32:00.760 --> 32:03.760
to it this weekend, so I'm gonna check that out during the week this week.

32:03.760 --> 32:11.640
Um, and I did play World of Warcraft, of course, had an epic Civilization 5 match again on

32:11.640 --> 32:12.640
Saturday night.

32:12.640 --> 32:19.040
Uh, this time, it was myself and four other people were playing, so it was five of us

32:19.040 --> 32:23.280
playing Civ 5, and, uh, we started, I think, around 8 o'clock.

32:23.280 --> 32:29.040
I went to bed at 3.30, and we weren't even close to being done, so yeah, no, no VoG people,

32:29.040 --> 32:30.040
unfortunately, this time.

32:30.040 --> 32:32.600
I know we've been talking about, like, Bobby and I have been trying to play for a while,

32:32.600 --> 32:34.160
and it just hasn't happened yet.

32:34.160 --> 32:38.700
Um, but yeah, some of my, uh, IRL friends were all playing, and it was, it was a lot

32:38.700 --> 32:39.700
of fun.

32:39.700 --> 32:43.120
But the hilarious part is that I'm pretty much on an island all by myself.

32:43.120 --> 32:48.320
I'm in, like, an Australia place all by myself with one computer opponent, and they are all

32:48.320 --> 32:51.920
on another little continent, and they're just, they're all killing each other, so I'm

32:51.920 --> 32:57.560
just like, okay, I'm happy here in my little arctic paradise, whatever, have fun.

32:57.560 --> 33:05.760
All right, um, other games I've played this week, um, I went back, kicking it old school

33:05.760 --> 33:08.240
on my 3DS, playing a DS game.

33:08.240 --> 33:12.920
I've been playing Pokemon Pearl, because ever since that X and Y trailer came out, I'm like,

33:12.920 --> 33:13.920
that looks really good.

33:13.920 --> 33:20.040
Like, finally, they've got the Pokemon games looking like the cartoon series, like, it

33:20.040 --> 33:21.480
took them long enough.

33:21.480 --> 33:26.840
So I've kind of decided to go back and look at the older games in an effort to collect

33:26.840 --> 33:31.240
Pokemon to transfer to X and Y at some point, so, you know, why not?

33:31.240 --> 33:36.080
So I've got very far, but I have about three, four hours logged on Pokemon Pearl.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.880
No particular reason I picked that one, that just happens to be the one that I had in my

33:38.880 --> 33:43.040
collection from, like, years ago, so, and I never really got very far in it, so I'm

33:43.040 --> 33:44.760
rediscovering it all over again.

33:44.760 --> 33:45.760
There you go.

33:45.760 --> 33:52.920
Um, so, yeah, wow, Civ, Pokemon, I guess that's really about it.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.520
Nothing else to share for now.

33:54.520 --> 33:58.400
Some random XBLA games here and there, but nothing worth talking in depth about.

33:58.400 --> 34:02.000
So let's move on into housekeeping tonight.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.520
You can, of course, always visit us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R, and you can also

34:06.520 --> 34:12.320
visit us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, and, again, I would encourage

34:12.320 --> 34:17.400
you as well to check out the Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com and support some

34:17.400 --> 34:18.920
of the other shows that are on the network.

34:18.920 --> 34:22.680
We got a lot of great shows throughout the week that play on the network, and encourage

34:22.680 --> 34:24.760
you to check that out.

34:24.760 --> 34:28.720
Also since I brought up Twitter, I wanted to talk about this real quick, somebody had

34:28.720 --> 34:32.920
sent me a tweet the other day, and I thought this was a pretty neat, like, cause I wanted

34:32.920 --> 34:37.600
to bring up, and sometimes people will tweet us at O-L-R and say, hey, please retweet this,

34:37.600 --> 34:41.080
but remember, if your account is private, we can't retweet, like, the retweet button

34:41.080 --> 34:42.640
is actually disabled.

34:42.640 --> 34:50.640
So this was one of these things where somebody tweeted, it was, the Twitter handle is UnlimitedOneUps,

34:50.640 --> 34:53.160
tweeted us, and said, hey, retweet this.

34:53.160 --> 34:55.720
So I can't retweet it, so I'll do something a little different.

34:55.720 --> 35:00.600
I will plug it here on the show, cause I think this is a really great cause.

35:00.600 --> 35:10.360
It's called presspaws.org, but it's press P-A-W-S, like doggy paws and kitty paws.

35:10.360 --> 35:15.040
I thought this was great, cause obviously, Orange Launch Radio, we've had a lot of, you

35:15.040 --> 35:19.780
know, loved pets pass away this past year, unfortunately, it's very tragic.

35:19.780 --> 35:21.840
So what better time to bring up something like this?

35:21.840 --> 35:26.360
The website presspaws.org, saving animals with art and video games, and they're actually

35:26.360 --> 35:30.800
doing this whole little gallery, February 9th at Gallery Nucleus, which I believe's

35:30.800 --> 35:33.880
in the Chicago area, question mark?

35:33.880 --> 35:37.720
So it's not really here, let me actually, actually now I'm curious where this is at.

35:37.760 --> 35:42.720
I think the Twitter person was in the Chicago area, so I didn't see this, let me see real

35:42.720 --> 35:43.720
quick.

35:43.720 --> 35:46.680
Sorry guys, I like literally just brought it up.

35:46.680 --> 35:51.280
Oh no, this is in the LA area, my bad, this is in Alhambra.

35:51.280 --> 35:56.360
So that's really cool, it's in the LA area, and yeah, I think they hit their goal already

35:56.360 --> 36:03.080
of 3,000 to, you know, raise the money and everything, but yeah, check out the website.

36:03.080 --> 36:04.240
It's cute.

36:04.240 --> 36:06.920
Look at all the doggies with the question mark blocks and the goombas and wearing the

36:06.920 --> 36:07.920
Luigi hats.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.920
There need to be more kitties.

36:09.920 --> 36:13.880
There's another doggie, there aren't, there really aren't a lot of kitties here, are there?

36:13.880 --> 36:14.880
There's one.

36:14.880 --> 36:16.880
There's a kitty.

36:16.880 --> 36:17.880
Yeah.

36:17.880 --> 36:20.800
Definitely don't know your target audience on the internet.

36:20.800 --> 36:24.080
Well, I thought it was cute and worth a shout out, so there you go.

36:24.080 --> 36:27.480
It is cute, very good, and Tigerclaw reposted it in the chat room.

36:27.480 --> 36:29.160
Thank you.

36:29.160 --> 36:33.400
I wanted to mention something too real quick about my gaming week that I forgot to mention.

36:33.400 --> 36:38.360
Wars of Horizon, love, love, love that Horizon base arena station on there.

36:38.360 --> 36:40.760
Oh yeah, yeah, they've got some good music in the game.

36:40.760 --> 36:44.560
Yeah, a lot of them, you know, a lot of them are actually songs I listened to already in

36:44.560 --> 36:48.160
the car, but make a new CD for my car.

36:48.160 --> 36:49.160
Yeah.

36:49.160 --> 36:53.320
Although, although I have to say, what the fuck is Blue Monday by New Order doing on

36:53.320 --> 36:54.320
that goddamn station?

36:54.320 --> 36:55.440
It makes no fucking sense.

36:55.440 --> 36:56.880
Why the fuck not?

36:56.880 --> 37:02.520
Because it's not, it's not, it's not a base on, New Order belongs everywhere, if it was,

37:02.520 --> 37:07.380
if it was the New Order remix that was in Blade or something, yes, that would totally

37:07.380 --> 37:11.280
fit with that station, but New Order, it just, it doesn't, that would be perfect like on

37:11.280 --> 37:12.280
the rock station or something.

37:12.280 --> 37:14.560
Maybe your base just isn't high enough.

37:14.560 --> 37:22.100
It doesn't have a lot of base in it, it's Blue Monday, I mean, come on.

37:22.100 --> 37:25.200
At least it's not that horrible remake that was done a couple, oh my god, it was probably

37:25.200 --> 37:26.200
about 10 years ago.

37:26.200 --> 37:30.400
Yeah, and those guys were assholes and said, well, our version's better.

37:30.400 --> 37:31.400
In hell.

37:31.440 --> 37:32.440
Alright.

37:32.440 --> 37:33.440
In nowhere.

37:33.440 --> 37:36.280
Alright, uh, let's move on.

37:36.280 --> 37:38.920
Let's get into gaming news and talk about what's been going on in the video game world

37:38.920 --> 37:43.080
this week with you guys commenting and participating live, live.vognetwork.com.

37:43.080 --> 37:46.600
If you are listening to the podcast, you can always email us, mailbag at orangelandrater.com

37:46.600 --> 37:47.960
or tweet us or what have you.

37:47.960 --> 37:49.360
Let's get into the news, Loki.

37:49.360 --> 37:55.160
Alright, so let's talk a little bit about Nintendo and it's kind of interesting that

37:55.160 --> 38:00.560
they decided to go ahead and merge their handheld and console divisions, which I hope that this

38:00.560 --> 38:04.840
means that we're going to see a lot more kind of stuff that we used to have with even

38:04.840 --> 38:08.560
like the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance and stuff like that where you see a lot of

38:08.560 --> 38:12.840
synergy between the console versions and the portables like, you know, tying into each

38:12.840 --> 38:17.360
other like, hey, you can unlock crap from the console version if you plug in your system

38:17.360 --> 38:18.360
or whatever.

38:18.360 --> 38:21.280
Maybe we see something like that with the 3DS and, you know, the Wii U or something

38:21.280 --> 38:25.920
like that, some sort of cross connectivity with some games or something, that'd be pretty

38:25.920 --> 38:32.920
awesome or, you know, better console games, I guess, on handhelds or, or I don't know,

38:32.920 --> 38:37.480
maybe because the Wii U is almost like a 3DS anyways, just tied to a TV.

38:37.480 --> 38:40.320
So yeah, I was going to say, I thought this was going to go more along your joke about

38:40.320 --> 38:43.320
how the Wii U is just basically a DS without hinges.

38:43.320 --> 38:45.760
It pretty much is.

38:45.760 --> 38:49.680
Although we should add hinges, we should just like hinge it to the TV, clamp, clamp the

38:49.680 --> 38:54.680
game pad to the TV, there you go, done.

38:54.680 --> 39:01.040
You know, actually, if you, well, I was going to see if there was a way to get like an external

39:01.040 --> 39:02.040
monitor or something like that.

39:02.040 --> 39:06.320
They should make that an external monitor that clips to your game pad that makes it

39:06.320 --> 39:07.320
like a 3DS.

39:07.320 --> 39:11.160
It's like, okay, I got the screen up here and yeah, I'm kind of thing.

39:11.160 --> 39:14.280
Well, let me read this next story because the two kind of go hand in hand.

39:14.280 --> 39:18.000
Maybe I want to talk about if, if the two go hand in hand or what it can mean.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.360
And it's a report going around about the Wii U game sales.

39:21.360 --> 39:26.160
Apparently the game sales are actually lagging behind the Wii and the GameCube.

39:26.160 --> 39:27.160
Please note the keyword there.

39:27.160 --> 39:29.920
It is the game sales.

39:29.920 --> 39:36.920
Analyst Doug Kreutz of a Cohen and company is interpreting the software sales totals

39:36.920 --> 39:42.160
for the November to December period were 43% lower than software sales for the Wii and

39:42.160 --> 39:45.720
50% lower than those for the GameCube.

39:45.720 --> 39:47.600
Ouch.

39:47.600 --> 39:52.400
But then again, you know, the Wii U, I don't, I mean, even though a lot of people are like,

39:52.400 --> 39:55.920
Wii U has got the biggest launch lineup ever and it's got all these games.

39:55.920 --> 40:00.120
I mean, the reality is a lot of those games were already played by people a long time

40:00.120 --> 40:02.980
ago and I don't think they were as exciting.

40:02.980 --> 40:07.800
And especially alongside the Wii lineup, the original Wii, you know, you had a lot, a lot

40:07.800 --> 40:10.120
more like everybody had to have Zelda.

40:10.120 --> 40:13.080
And I think on the Wii U you get a lot of people that have to have Mario, but I think

40:13.080 --> 40:14.920
people don't feel like they need to get much else.

40:14.920 --> 40:15.920
Yeah.

40:15.920 --> 40:18.880
Or let's say you own multiple consoles and say you're buying Call of Duty.

40:18.880 --> 40:22.640
Are you going to buy the comp or buy Call of Duty for the console that you just got

40:22.640 --> 40:26.080
that maybe your friends don't have yet or you can buy it for the one that your friends

40:26.080 --> 40:31.480
are already on or, you know, you know, like you put and put out there.

40:31.480 --> 40:35.040
I mean, there's a lot of games are just stuff that was either released slightly earlier

40:35.040 --> 40:36.040
or at the same time.

40:36.040 --> 40:39.600
I mean, it's not a lot of really exclusive new stuff.

40:39.600 --> 40:43.840
And one of the big new exclusive games, Nintendo land was included with the console and most

40:43.840 --> 40:44.840
people bought anyways.

40:44.840 --> 40:48.120
Yeah, but Wii Sports was included with the Wii, which was an even bigger deal.

40:48.120 --> 40:55.040
So I, I, but, but it, that's true it was, but this is also being sold alongside of it

40:55.040 --> 40:56.040
as well.

40:56.040 --> 40:57.040
I mean, that's got to hurt.

40:57.040 --> 40:59.480
In fact, every week came with Wii Sports.

40:59.480 --> 41:01.800
So there was no like, you know, double ski.

41:01.800 --> 41:05.720
Well, in the beginning anyway, we came with Wii Sports, but, um, I don't know.

41:05.720 --> 41:08.920
I just, there's not a lot of original games I think for right now.

41:08.920 --> 41:14.020
Now to be fair, one thing that is pointed out is that, um, you know, e-shop downloads

41:14.020 --> 41:16.400
don't get included in the NPD numbers.

41:16.400 --> 41:20.580
So if people are buying games online, which they might've done over the holiday season

41:20.580 --> 41:24.100
because they don't want to be caught in the mall, those numbers don't count.

41:24.100 --> 41:27.460
I don't think that's as big of a factor as people are making it out to be.

41:27.460 --> 41:32.820
I personally have a real hard time plunking down 50 bucks for a game with nothing tangible.

41:32.820 --> 41:36.300
It's different when it's like 10, 15, you know, that's about 20 is about as high as

41:36.300 --> 41:37.300
I go.

41:37.300 --> 41:40.140
Perfect example, earth defense force 2017 portable, sigil only.

41:40.140 --> 41:47.860
I was kind of staring at the screen cause I booted up my PSP or my vita, my vita this

41:47.860 --> 41:48.860
week.

41:48.860 --> 41:52.520
And I was like, you know, I was just looking at him like, do I really want to spend, no,

41:52.520 --> 41:57.060
I'm not buying this for $40 that is too fucking expensive for digital download.

41:57.060 --> 41:58.060
Sorry.

41:58.060 --> 41:59.060
I forgot.

41:59.060 --> 42:01.780
I totally forgot to talk about wake up club, but I'll get to that in part B.

42:01.780 --> 42:05.660
But see, I spent more than a cost, well Dan did anyway, more than the cost of a Wii on

42:05.660 --> 42:08.100
my graphics card.

42:08.100 --> 42:14.220
And I can get games that play better, look better, and I can mod to hell and back.

42:14.220 --> 42:17.820
Oh, you're going to be one of those people that are like PC gaming above all else.

42:17.820 --> 42:24.500
To be honest, to be honest, I think PC gaming these days is really beating out the consoles.

42:24.500 --> 42:28.100
I think that now people are starting to realize that you're getting a bit more of your money's

42:28.100 --> 42:34.260
worth out of a PC gaming, I mean, except it's not yes and no.

42:34.260 --> 42:38.720
Some games just don't run as smooth as they do on consoles because a lot of games are

42:38.720 --> 42:44.600
optimized for the consoles, you know, because again, PCs all have that varying equipment,

42:44.600 --> 42:45.600
which can make a difference.

42:45.600 --> 42:48.260
But you know, consoles, everybody's got the same thing.

42:48.260 --> 42:51.780
So a lot of times, you know, what works on the console doesn't necessarily work on PC.

42:51.780 --> 42:53.580
I'm not, I mean, look at my gaming week.

42:53.580 --> 42:57.380
I play World of Warcraft and Civ V. I'm not knocking PC gaming by any means, but I think

42:57.380 --> 42:58.380
there's room at the table for both.

42:58.380 --> 43:04.540
But I just think at this point, given the limitations with the Wii U software base,

43:04.540 --> 43:08.620
and honestly that you're not getting anything really new out of it except for that little

43:08.620 --> 43:13.660
controller, that my money was better spent on my graphics card.

43:13.660 --> 43:18.420
Ross Deal UT in chat says, considering how low the Wii U storage is, I doubt that, talking

43:18.420 --> 43:21.180
about the downloads, 32 gigs isn't a lot of space.

43:21.180 --> 43:22.700
Yeah, that's an issue too.

43:22.700 --> 43:25.260
I mean, granted, you can add your own drive to the system.

43:25.260 --> 43:26.260
You know, they were touting that.

43:27.260 --> 43:30.700
It's too early to really see the impact of that, I think.

43:30.700 --> 43:33.980
You know, maybe when there's more desirable stuff, you know, we talked about how the Wii

43:33.980 --> 43:37.820
U eShop is very indie friendly and we anticipate there's going to be a lot of good stuff that

43:37.820 --> 43:39.740
comes in throughout the year.

43:39.740 --> 43:44.620
I think it's still too early to gauge if a lot of people are actually doing that or not.

43:44.620 --> 43:49.500
Now Ross Deal UT in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com actually follows up with another good comment

43:49.500 --> 43:51.000
I wanted to read here.

43:51.000 --> 43:55.420
Ross Deal UT actually left PC gaming because of the DRM.

43:55.420 --> 43:59.420
And I got to admit, a lot of the PC games are shooting themselves in the foot when it

43:59.420 --> 44:01.140
comes to DRM.

44:01.140 --> 44:07.040
Not that consoles necessarily do a lot better, but like, you know, the SimCity shit, like

44:07.040 --> 44:11.260
EA's upcoming SimCity game, I'm sorry, I am totally turned off to that game.

44:11.260 --> 44:12.940
And it's because of the DRM.

44:12.940 --> 44:15.460
Diablo 3 pissed a lot of people off.

44:15.460 --> 44:18.860
You know, I think people are finally starting to say, you know what, I think we've hit our

44:18.860 --> 44:22.600
limit with how tied we have to be to the internet.

44:22.600 --> 44:25.680
You know, how much information we have to transmit from our computer on a regular basis

44:25.680 --> 44:26.680
just to play a stupid game.

44:26.680 --> 44:28.080
But it's the play with everybody else.

44:28.080 --> 44:32.320
I mean, it's totally not because of the DRM, it's the play with everybody else, right?

44:32.320 --> 44:33.320
Yeah.

44:33.320 --> 44:35.120
But people wanted to cheat in SimCity.

44:35.120 --> 44:37.000
Who didn't cheat in SimCity?

44:37.000 --> 44:38.240
Everybody cheats in SimCity.

44:38.240 --> 44:42.720
So why would you design your game to be online all the time so you can't cheat?

44:42.720 --> 44:43.720
Hello?

44:43.720 --> 44:48.360
However, Mass Effect 3, just for example, they wanted it online and they update the

44:48.360 --> 44:50.160
game whenever they want to.

44:50.160 --> 44:51.760
Still hackable, still cheatable.

44:52.280 --> 44:56.080
Well, thankfully the single player multi, but they, they will nail your ass if you cheat

44:56.080 --> 44:57.080
in the multiplayer.

44:57.080 --> 45:00.200
But I'm also not an asshole and won't cheat in multiplayer.

45:00.200 --> 45:03.000
So just saying.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.880
Maybe other people are assholes and like to cheat in multiplayer.

45:05.880 --> 45:10.240
Rama in our chatroom says, there are ways around DRM and for SimCity, I will do just

45:10.240 --> 45:11.240
that.

45:11.240 --> 45:12.240
That is exactly what's going to happen.

45:12.240 --> 45:14.440
And I can't believe EA doesn't realize it.

45:14.440 --> 45:19.920
Like some, somebody in a boardroom needs to get over their ego because just wait before

45:19.960 --> 45:23.560
the game comes out, somebody will have hacked that DRM and we'll have an offline playable

45:23.560 --> 45:25.200
downloadable SimCity.

45:25.200 --> 45:28.080
Wait, that is exactly what will happen.

45:28.080 --> 45:30.640
There's already hacks for just about any game out there.

45:30.640 --> 45:33.600
There's ways to play it without the desk, which I'm actually starting to do with Mass

45:33.600 --> 45:35.400
Effect 2 so that I can run text mod.

45:35.400 --> 45:41.120
I'm just saying, because mine is a Amazon download.

45:41.120 --> 45:43.520
I haven't said the G word.

45:43.520 --> 45:46.640
All right.

45:46.640 --> 45:50.600
So anyway, the point I wanted to get to was going back a story.

45:50.600 --> 45:54.400
You were talking about the console division getting merged with the hardware division.

45:54.400 --> 46:00.600
Could the Wii U's, I don't want to say underwhelming performance, but non overwhelming performance

46:00.600 --> 46:02.320
be contributing to this?

46:02.320 --> 46:03.320
Probably.

46:03.320 --> 46:09.360
I would imagine it would be because they need to kind of figure out how they're going to

46:09.360 --> 46:16.760
recapture the magic and the kind of serious rush for tight product that the Wii had.

46:16.760 --> 46:19.400
I guess I don't really remember too much about the Wii launch.

46:19.400 --> 46:21.880
I just know that the consoles are really hard to get.

46:21.880 --> 46:23.560
I can tell you right now, they're not hard to get.

46:23.560 --> 46:28.800
In fact, we're getting our consoles this early already and not like a year later, like with

46:28.800 --> 46:29.960
the Wii.

46:29.960 --> 46:31.860
That's because they're sitting on shelves.

46:31.860 --> 46:33.440
They are sitting on shelves.

46:33.440 --> 46:34.440
Stacks of them?

46:34.440 --> 46:35.440
Yes.

46:35.440 --> 46:38.440
It's not flying off the shelves and that's got to have them worried.

46:39.080 --> 46:43.800
They don't want to have another 3DS debacle.

46:43.800 --> 46:46.540
The 3DS is in a much better place now.

46:46.540 --> 46:48.320
It is now, but what did that take?

46:48.320 --> 46:51.140
They had to drop the price and put out a lot more games.

46:51.140 --> 46:53.140
Is that what they're going to have to do?

46:53.140 --> 46:57.320
If they have to drop the price of the Wii U within the first year, that's going to look

46:57.320 --> 47:00.280
like double failure on their part.

47:00.280 --> 47:04.160
I don't know anybody that doesn't think the problem with the Wii U right now is the lack

47:04.160 --> 47:06.800
of exclusive games, basically.

47:07.200 --> 47:09.200
Yes, there's an awesome Mario game.

47:09.200 --> 47:11.720
Yes, Nintendo Land is pretty good.

47:11.720 --> 47:15.040
But there's not enough of that.

47:15.040 --> 47:18.240
The 3DS had the exact same problem in the beginning.

47:18.240 --> 47:19.680
Exact same problem with the 3DS.

47:19.680 --> 47:23.440
You had a decent launch lineup, but nothing sustained it.

47:23.440 --> 47:26.200
Now we're getting in this position with the Wii U again, which I know you'll get into

47:26.200 --> 47:29.500
in a minute when we talk about the releases.

47:29.500 --> 47:33.100
It's going to be until next Christmas when we start getting the stuff people really want

47:33.100 --> 47:34.340
to get.

47:34.340 --> 47:35.340
That's the reality.

47:35.780 --> 47:42.360
Well, we don't even know what they have planned beyond, well, I guess, I mean, second quarter

47:42.360 --> 47:45.220
is going to be pretty much stuff that's held over from first quarter.

47:45.220 --> 47:47.740
Nintendo doesn't announce holiday ahead at E3.

47:47.740 --> 47:48.740
They never really have.

47:48.740 --> 47:49.820
I mean, think about it.

47:49.820 --> 47:53.700
Most of the big heavy hitters are always announced at E3.

47:53.700 --> 47:55.540
Other companies don't tend to do that as much.

47:55.540 --> 47:59.620
You might find out about stuff a little earlier, but Nintendo really kind of keeps it until

47:59.620 --> 48:00.620
E3.

48:02.340 --> 48:04.740
Especially with the new Xbox coming out this holiday.

48:04.740 --> 48:05.980
They're going to have to do something.

48:05.980 --> 48:09.780
They're going to have to really do something.

48:09.780 --> 48:13.300
Maybe the console's being merged so that the console people can work on a Wii U game.

48:13.300 --> 48:14.300
Who knows?

48:14.300 --> 48:15.300
I don't know.

48:15.300 --> 48:16.300
Push this button.

48:16.300 --> 48:17.300
Look.

48:17.300 --> 48:18.300
Hey, there's a 3DS hidden inside there.

48:18.300 --> 48:20.220
I bet you didn't know about that.

48:20.220 --> 48:23.100
Womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp.

48:23.100 --> 48:27.800
Maybe your whole little theory about the 3DS will soon become another Wii U gamepad.

48:27.800 --> 48:29.060
Maybe that will come to light.

48:29.060 --> 48:30.060
Who knows?

48:30.060 --> 48:34.700
Although I don't think the technology is capable in those 3DSs, but maybe there will be a

48:34.700 --> 48:39.540
3DS XL XL that will do it.

48:39.540 --> 48:40.540
4DS.

48:40.540 --> 48:41.540
4D or whatever.

48:41.540 --> 48:42.540
Yeah.

48:42.540 --> 48:43.540
That will do it.

48:43.540 --> 48:44.540
Who knows?

48:44.540 --> 48:45.540
That's an interesting question.

48:45.540 --> 48:49.580
Do you think the merging of the divisions means something for the next handheld?

48:49.580 --> 48:52.220
I guess anything's possible.

48:52.220 --> 48:54.700
All right, let's move on with more gaming news.

48:54.700 --> 48:55.700
Dark Sakura.

48:55.700 --> 48:56.700
Stupid iPad.

48:56.700 --> 48:57.700
Okay.

48:57.700 --> 49:06.820
So, well, we know that Sony has been losing money left and right, hand over fist.

49:06.820 --> 49:10.020
Well, they would like to make money hand over fist, but they've been losing it.

49:10.020 --> 49:16.860
So now they're actually selling their New York City headquarters for 1.1 billion.

49:16.860 --> 49:20.940
Sony Corp of America.

49:20.940 --> 49:25.420
They're going to be selling it off to the Chetric group, and it's supposed to close

49:25.420 --> 49:26.420
in March.

49:26.420 --> 49:38.580
Now, keep in mind that the company, it cost them, what was it, 770 million in debts that

49:38.580 --> 49:41.060
they're up to right now.

49:41.060 --> 49:45.100
So selling off this money is going to be a big, selling off the building, sorry, is going

49:45.100 --> 49:48.220
to be a huge recoup in lost income.

49:48.220 --> 49:53.340
However, I mean, what they're looking at, I'm not sure exactly what it costs to maintain

49:53.340 --> 49:57.540
the building, but they have a lot of money to make up.

49:57.540 --> 50:02.060
So you take a building, I know land taxes in New York are horrible.

50:02.060 --> 50:03.060
They're crazy.

50:03.060 --> 50:04.060
I used to do property taxes.

50:04.060 --> 50:05.900
Well, we all know New York City is an expensive place to live.

50:05.900 --> 50:06.900
It's no secret.

50:06.900 --> 50:09.220
And so, you know, the buildings there are worth a lot of money.

50:09.220 --> 50:15.800
But I mean, I don't see anything about a relocation of, of business getting a cheaper building,

50:15.800 --> 50:17.860
you know, place that's going to cost us money to maintain.

50:17.860 --> 50:20.740
I mean, for all we know, they could move to Montana.

50:21.500 --> 50:24.020
Can you imagine Sony in Montana?

50:24.020 --> 50:29.460
But they are going to be allowed to remain in the building for up to three years with

50:29.460 --> 50:32.340
the leaseback arrangement.

50:32.340 --> 50:35.260
So it's not like they're moving now.

50:35.260 --> 50:37.940
It's that they're letting the building go.

50:37.940 --> 50:39.980
Pretty much you're giving them the building back to the bank.

50:39.980 --> 50:42.380
We haven't heard anything about like jobs affected or anything.

50:42.380 --> 50:46.020
And also, I think it should be mentioned, I don't, Sony does more than PlayStation.

50:46.020 --> 50:47.020
Let's not forget.

50:47.020 --> 50:48.940
There is a lot at Sony.

50:48.940 --> 50:54.180
You know, not even just TVs, they have a whole motion picture division and music.

50:54.180 --> 50:58.080
And I'm sure I doubt very little PlayStation happens in Sony.

50:58.080 --> 51:00.220
You know, a lot of that is run out of the Bay Area.

51:00.220 --> 51:01.220
We know that.

51:01.220 --> 51:04.140
Well, in Japan for one, and in the Bay Area for the U.S.

51:04.140 --> 51:09.180
Like the video games division for Sony is really, I think, it's decent, but relatively

51:09.180 --> 51:11.460
small potatoes compared to the rest of what they do.

51:11.460 --> 51:12.460
Sure.

51:12.460 --> 51:13.460
Sure.

51:13.460 --> 51:14.780
So, but I'm not surprised to see it go.

51:14.780 --> 51:21.380
I mean, that's way too much expense and it's not even that interesting looking at the building.

51:21.380 --> 51:22.380
But it's in New York City.

51:22.380 --> 51:23.380
It's a big building.

51:23.380 --> 51:24.380
So there's a lot of stuff in New York City.

51:24.380 --> 51:25.820
It doesn't make it cool.

51:25.820 --> 51:29.660
It will be interesting to see who snatches it up.

51:29.660 --> 51:30.660
What?

51:30.660 --> 51:31.660
OK.

51:31.660 --> 51:34.140
Valid question.

51:34.140 --> 51:38.500
Probably some corporation with tons of money and corrupt practices to screw us over with.

51:38.500 --> 51:39.500
Bank of America.

51:39.500 --> 51:41.660
God, fuck Bank of America.

51:41.660 --> 51:42.660
Moving on, Loki.

51:42.660 --> 51:43.660
All right.

51:43.980 --> 51:48.200
So as we were talking about a little bit earlier, lots of games supposed to be coming out this

51:48.200 --> 51:51.780
fourth or first quarter for the Wii U.

51:51.780 --> 51:57.060
Although a lot of them, unfortunately, are just kind of like ports and stuff.

51:57.060 --> 51:58.260
But there are some good stuff.

51:58.260 --> 52:01.720
So let's talk a little bit about some things coming out.

52:01.720 --> 52:07.360
Need for Speed Most Wanted finally coming out to the Wii U in March on the 19th in the

52:07.360 --> 52:12.740
U.S. and or North America and in Europe on the 21st.

52:12.740 --> 52:13.740
Something really special about that.

52:13.740 --> 52:18.300
I don't even really know how they're supposed to, I guess, off screen play mode.

52:18.300 --> 52:23.460
So they're going to have that and then you can use it to select your cars and keeps track

52:23.460 --> 52:25.760
of your records or something like that.

52:25.760 --> 52:29.100
Also bundled, I guess, with the Ultimate Speed Pack, which is some piece of DLC, because

52:29.100 --> 52:31.780
that seems to be kind of the trend there.

52:31.780 --> 52:35.000
One of the games that was supposed to be highly anticipated for the first quarter, Aliens

52:35.000 --> 52:38.400
Colonial Marines, now doesn't really have a firm date.

52:38.400 --> 52:44.140
It's not going to be launching on the 12th with the actual game on the other consoles.

52:44.140 --> 52:48.660
Instead now it's just kind of TBA, you know.

52:48.660 --> 52:53.220
So hopefully that doesn't mean delayed past March, because that would be, you know, it's

52:53.220 --> 52:58.640
another big mature rated game for the console.

52:58.640 --> 53:03.360
The Amazing Spider-Man Ultimate Edition, you know, getting a port of a game that came out

53:03.360 --> 53:11.140
back in June, fantastic, and of course with DLC thrown in there as well.

53:11.140 --> 53:16.260
It's coming out in March, and then two games that were expected the first quarter, the

53:16.260 --> 53:21.700
Game & Wario and Wonderful 101, which, let's be honest here, two first party games, those

53:21.700 --> 53:23.100
aren't really that exciting.

53:23.100 --> 53:29.820
I mean, I know Game & Wario, they didn't really show a whole ton of that, and then the Wonderful

53:29.820 --> 53:32.780
101, sort of like Pikmin.

53:32.780 --> 53:38.520
Now those will begin to release date as far as the first half of 2013, so I will be willing

53:38.520 --> 53:41.800
to bet that that's probably going to be after first quarter.

53:41.800 --> 53:44.800
I think Wonderful 101 has its anticipators.

53:44.800 --> 53:46.700
I think you might be selling it short a little bit there.

53:46.700 --> 53:49.000
It's not going to sell that well.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.360
It's too niche, I'm sorry.

53:50.360 --> 53:56.280
Well, yeah, I think only because maybe the Wii U hasn't, you know, gotten out there as

53:56.280 --> 53:57.280
much as possible.

53:57.280 --> 54:00.120
It doesn't matter, the genre, I think it's going to be too niche.

54:00.120 --> 54:04.260
It's just, it's a niche appeal, I mean, to that.

54:04.260 --> 54:05.260
That's what's going to happen.

54:05.260 --> 54:08.780
And of course, nothing even mentioned yet.

54:08.780 --> 54:14.420
I think Wii Fit U is also supposed to be first half of 2013 as well, so April, May, June,

54:14.420 --> 54:15.420
there you go.

54:15.420 --> 54:18.500
You got your four title, or three titles there.

54:18.500 --> 54:23.580
One title is confirmed though for first quarter, and that's going to be LEGO City Undercover.

54:23.580 --> 54:28.740
That's actually launching on the Wii U in March, on the 3DS in April.

54:28.740 --> 54:32.720
Pretty much the only game that I was actually looking forward to at all.

54:32.720 --> 54:33.720
So there's that.

54:33.720 --> 54:37.600
And then for the 3DS, there's going to be Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon, which is coming

54:37.600 --> 54:40.000
on the 24th of March.

54:40.000 --> 54:45.800
So I want to say, well of course Fire Emblem in February, I want to say though that they

54:45.800 --> 54:50.720
haven't really announced any other 3DS titles, other than Smash Brothers, but that's just

54:50.720 --> 54:54.320
kind of like, hey, we're working on Smash Brothers, but they haven't really announced

54:54.320 --> 54:58.740
anything else for second quarter, first party I think.

54:58.740 --> 55:03.660
Oh, Brain Age Concentration Train, I think that's also February.

55:03.660 --> 55:06.860
Pokemon XY, but that's the end of the year.

55:06.860 --> 55:12.460
Well Pokemon, there's a Pokemon Mystery Dungeon game that's coming out at the end of March

55:12.460 --> 55:13.460
as well.

55:13.460 --> 55:18.940
But yeah, Pokemon XY would be the fourth quarter.

55:18.940 --> 55:23.980
So that's pretty much it, but once again, it's a lot of stuff that's ports, I mean unless

55:23.980 --> 55:28.720
you're, I mean I don't know, I don't know a lot of people would be really anticipating

55:28.720 --> 55:35.120
getting a game like this, unless this is your only console or something, I just don't see

55:35.120 --> 55:39.520
people going, oh I need to get Need for Speed, you know, it's not going to be a really big

55:39.520 --> 55:44.160
thing unless, you know, I mean there are really no racing games aside from Sonic and Sega

55:44.160 --> 55:51.120
All-Stars Racing, so that might be kind of good if you're into that.

55:51.120 --> 55:52.380
But yeah, it's a lot of ports.

55:52.380 --> 55:55.840
So that's the only thing that has me worried, is this isn't going to drive, I mean Lego

55:55.840 --> 55:59.280
City Undercover could drive some console sales because that's a pretty cool looking game,

55:59.280 --> 56:04.720
but it's not, there's no games that really scream, oh my god, I have to get a Wii U now.

56:04.720 --> 56:08.080
Well the Need for Speed thing, I don't think this is coming up on our show, or else I might

56:08.080 --> 56:12.200
be duplicating something, I hope not, but I remember reading something about the whole,

56:12.200 --> 56:16.400
that the Wii U version of Need for Speed will let you do the co-op, where you both drive

56:16.400 --> 56:19.640
and want to use on the gamepad and want to use on the TV, and I got to admit, that's

56:19.640 --> 56:20.980
pretty rad.

56:20.980 --> 56:25.340
You know, that they're able to install like that fully functional two player using the

56:25.340 --> 56:29.480
Wii U, that is something you're not going to see on the other systems.

56:29.480 --> 56:31.660
For what it's worth, I think that's a neat feature.

56:31.660 --> 56:38.980
I'll give that to them I guess, but once again though, it's not like, oh my god, that's really

56:38.980 --> 56:45.060
going to sell it for me, it's just, I don't know, it's sad that Lego City, let's not sell

56:45.060 --> 56:51.520
Lego City undercover that short, I mean it's a pretty awesome looking game, but I just,

56:51.520 --> 56:56.520
I don't know, I don't know if it's really going to be enough.

56:56.520 --> 57:02.000
Alright well moving on to another story, this is not about a Wii U release, but a Wii release,

57:02.000 --> 57:06.600
like you know, basic Wii, which you know, obviously a lot of people still own the Nintendo

57:06.600 --> 57:10.560
Wii, and it's not like your Wii U can't play Wii games, by the way I also transferred all

57:10.560 --> 57:13.680
my data from the Wii to the Wii U this week, it was pretty painless.

57:13.680 --> 57:18.860
So now I can play my virtual console games with the HDMI collection, woo hoo!

57:18.860 --> 57:23.220
But I really wish, sorry I'll get to the story eventually, I need to rant though, I really

57:23.220 --> 57:28.820
wish because this pisses me off that virtual console is too stupid for this, why doesn't

57:28.820 --> 57:35.700
the system know to automatically side letterbox or put into the right aspect ratio the virtual

57:35.700 --> 57:37.080
console games?

57:37.080 --> 57:39.600
Why does it still force them to widescreen?

57:39.600 --> 57:44.220
Why can't it know to script, because I can set it on my TV, sure, but that's such a pain

57:44.220 --> 57:48.440
in the ass, why can't when I boot up Zelda, which is a 4.3 game, like Zelda was not in

57:48.440 --> 57:52.860
widescreen on the NES, why can't it just know, oh, flip the resolution back to 4.3?

57:52.860 --> 57:57.800
Because they didn't program it in, because they cut corners.

57:57.800 --> 57:59.140
Well that's stupid and I hate it.

57:59.140 --> 58:06.580
It's just the same reason why they couldn't reprogram, you know, the emulator to run on

58:06.580 --> 58:07.580
your gamepad.

58:08.160 --> 58:11.160
But that's supposed to be coming, so they're developing it after that.

58:11.160 --> 58:14.640
Oh, that'd be nice that you'd have to buy an enhanced version of the fucking game they

58:14.640 --> 58:15.640
already have.

58:15.640 --> 58:18.640
I, no, that won't be happening.

58:18.640 --> 58:19.640
It won't be happening?

58:19.640 --> 58:20.640
It won't be happening.

58:20.640 --> 58:21.640
Are we absolutely sure of that?

58:21.640 --> 58:22.640
Because I bet it's gonna happen.

58:22.640 --> 58:24.040
It won't be happening.

58:24.040 --> 58:28.400
Look at the virtual console games I have on 3DS, I have not bought anything that wasn't

58:28.400 --> 58:34.160
free or not available, like I have a couple Game Boy games, those weren't available before.

58:34.160 --> 58:35.160
That's it.

58:35.160 --> 58:38.260
Maybe I have maybe two Game Boy games.

58:38.260 --> 58:42.380
I'm just saying, I bet you they're gonna do that kind of crap, because they tried to pull

58:42.380 --> 58:48.780
that shit with, are they still releasing those 3DS games, the retro ones that are in 3D now?

58:48.780 --> 58:50.540
They kind of like say, ah, fuck it.

58:50.540 --> 58:53.340
There's non-3D ones, all the Mega Man games, that was a big deal, remember?

58:53.340 --> 58:56.620
Yeah, I understand that, but are they doing those, remember how they're like Excitebike

58:56.620 --> 58:57.620
and stuff like that?

58:57.620 --> 58:58.780
I don't think there's been one in a while.

58:58.780 --> 58:59.780
There were a few.

58:59.780 --> 59:02.740
They're like, ah, fuck it, no one's buying them, you know.

59:02.800 --> 59:07.280
It was like Xevious and Urban Champion and like all these, you know, interesting ones,

59:07.280 --> 59:09.200
but I haven't seen one in a little while.

59:11.200 --> 59:11.700
Anyhow.

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
Yeah, I thought, I thought we were gonna get like Zelda and 3D and stuff.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
I guess not.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
I guess it was too hard.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.680
Anyway, back to what I was originally going to talk about, a Wii game coming out on the

59:20.680 --> 59:21.680
Wii U.

59:21.680 --> 59:27.200
XSeed has decided to bring over Pandora's Tower to the Wii.

59:27.200 --> 59:32.520
Now this is important because this was the last Operation Rainfall, you guys remember

59:32.520 --> 59:37.540
that, those last of the three Op Rainfall games that, you know, Nintendo was never going

59:37.540 --> 59:41.540
to bring over here and then they finally brought out Xenoblade Chronicles, although it had

59:41.540 --> 59:46.860
that horrible, horrible GameStop exclusive thing, but you could order it from Nintendo.com,

59:46.860 --> 59:47.860
whatever.

59:47.860 --> 59:50.980
They, XSeed brought out The Last Story, which did very well for them.

59:50.980 --> 59:56.540
So now XSeed seems to be kind of our champion, that is kind of, didn't you predict that somebody

59:56.540 --> 59:59.620
like them might be the ones that ultimately step up and do this like a while ago?

59:59.620 --> 01:00:00.620
No.

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:03.200
It's easier Ignition or XS game localization.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.860
So here they go, they're stepping up and putting out Pandora's Tower.

01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:10.980
Now it's going to be interesting to see how this does when the Wii U is what's really

01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:15.460
being pushed right now, but a lot of folks thought that Last Story, when it got price

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:20.560
cuts 20 bucks, made a great pickup game for people to get with the Wii U, because again,

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:21.880
you know, why not?

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:24.560
You can use the backwards compatibility, very easy.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:27.680
So, any interest in Pandora's Tower, Loki?

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:28.680
No.

01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:30.240
Too late?

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:34.340
I don't play anything on my Wii, and actually it's funny, we booted up the Wii because Nelly

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:36.560
was going to like play some more Animal Crossing.

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:42.020
So I charged, I charged our controllers and...

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:43.020
Animal Crossing.

01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:44.020
Sorry, I'm eating.

01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:45.700
Animal Crossing is on 3DS.

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:46.700
That's a game coming out.

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:47.700
No.

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:48.780
But it's not dated.

01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:49.780
It's out in Japan.

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:54.000
Yeah, that's a fourth quarter game, that's going to be sad that it's gotten that delayed.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.320
I don't think it can be.

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:57.380
It's got to be sooner than that.

01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:59.940
Probably, could be a May game.

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:00.940
We'll see.

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:05.860
But I mean, seriously though, we forgot all about it because it was that, you know, highly

01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:09.700
anticipated that we completely forgot about the game.

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:11.700
I don't know.

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:15.820
What's it called?

01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:18.740
Animal Crossing Jump Out or something like that?

01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:19.740
Animal Crossing Jump Out.

01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:24.260
No, it's like Animal Crossing, it's the same fucking game on 3DS.

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:25.260
I don't know.

01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:26.260
Occupy Nooks.

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:27.260
I wish.

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.260
That'd be great.

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:29.260
That would be great.

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:30.260
All right.

01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:31.260
Moving on.

01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:32.260
More news.

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:36.660
Well, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:39.340
Now you know that you play as Raiden in that, right?

01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:45.180
Well, that's not what Kojima originally wanted, but he did let go of the story writing so

01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:47.220
that he could focus on production.

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:54.100
He wanted it to be Gray Fox, who, as we all know from Metal Gear Solid, and he was a character

01:01:54.100 --> 01:02:00.520
that had a lot of crap happen to him and a very, very crazy story if you'd followed

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:05.940
the MSX Metal Gear games and, you know, really were a fan of the series.

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:09.500
But he said, no, we're going to let the kids play, and they went Raiden, and they went

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:12.820
hack and slash, so let's go with Raiden.

01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:16.620
It would have been so awesome to have a game with Gray Fox, don't you think?

01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:20.420
Instead, he gets stepped on by Metal Gear Pooh.

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:21.420
Sad trombone.

01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:27.500
You know, it's funny, I actually forgot to mention, I played Anarchy Reigns during my

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:30.460
game week this week, and it was very subpar.

01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:31.460
Really?

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:38.220
Which sad me, because I love Platinum Games, and it was just, it was a mess.

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:39.900
It just not set up well at all.

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:43.980
I mean, there's no story, which is fine, I find no story being in there, but it was confusing

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:47.900
on what the hell he had to do, and the gameplay was just kind of like, eh.

01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:50.420
It was like, Madworld was so much better.

01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:55.300
Why is, you know, Jack having to do this crap?

01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:59.620
Jack's fun to play in HD though, it was fun to play as that character, but it's just,

01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:01.140
I just didn't know what the fuck was going on.

01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:05.780
But I hope that that's not the case with Metal Gear Rising, but I think Metal Gear Rising

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:06.780
looks pretty awesome.

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:11.380
Well, also there was a comment regarding the trailer that might be Metal Gear Solid 5,

01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:12.380
The Phantom Pain.

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:13.380
Oh yeah, that thing.

01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:18.580
Yeah, Kojima said that he really liked the trailer and the lighting, it was very good.

01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:20.580
Oh, you.

01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:25.580
Metal Gear Rising Revengeance is gonna be out on February 22nd, so keep your eyes open

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:27.580
if you are interested.

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:31.580
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out very

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:32.580
soon.

01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:34.180
There's not much this week.

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:40.940
It's pretty much just Ni No Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch on PS3 this week, which is

01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:41.940
not bad.

01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:44.300
I mean, it's supposed to be a pretty awesome PlayStation 3 game.

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:49.100
Yeah, I want to check that out, but I don't know about the 60 bucks, though.

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:51.900
I think I might rent it or wait for President.

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:53.220
The reviews have said it's been worth it.

01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:54.220
Really?

01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:59.380
I mean, they said it's basically, what was the comparison I had?

01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:03.180
It was Dragon Quest with all the stuff that you hated from Dragon Quest ripped out of

01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:04.180
it.

01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:05.180
Huh.

01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:08.140
So, you know, that sounds pretty awesome.

01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:09.340
The demo didn't convince me.

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:12.340
I didn't hate it like Bobby did, but it didn't convince me.

01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:15.460
Although the graphics were great.

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:19.540
The only other thing that's coming out this week is a Sims 3 expansion pack, 70s, 80s,

01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:20.540
and 90s stuff.

01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:25.620
Do people still play Sims 3?

01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:26.620
Somebody must be.

01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:30.020
They still have a ton of fucking expansions coming out for the thing, so I don't understand

01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:31.020
why.

01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:32.020
Go to Ford.

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:33.020
And also, apparently, that's it.

01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:37.260
Alright, going to Japan, Hitman Absolution on the Xbox 360.

01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:41.220
Yes, this is the Japanese version, making its way out on January 24th, as well as a

01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:44.820
game called Instant Brain, but that's a price reduction that was already out before.

01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:48.700
That is going into Cave, the best series, because that is a cave game.

01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:49.700
Those are the Xbox 360.

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:53.060
Going to the PlayStation 3, things are a little bit bigger over there.

01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:56.940
Nobunaga Yoyobu online 10th anniversary box.

01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:59.800
I had no idea Nobunaga online was 10 years old, but there you go.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.700
That is out on the PlayStation 3 this week.

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:03.620
Also Hitman Absolution there.

01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:07.620
Bleach Soul Ignition getting a price reduction as far as new games go.

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:16.220
Heavy Fire Shattered Spear and Kamisama to Unmekikakume no Paradox in regular and limited

01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:19.060
edition and a Famitsu pack limited edition.

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:20.060
That's god something.

01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:23.740
I'm trying to see, let's see if this is a game that we know over here.

01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:26.860
Oh, hold on, we wouldn't know that from the limited edition art.

01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:28.500
Let me look at regular edition.

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:31.940
I'm trying to see if this is a game I recognize at all.

01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:34.340
I don't recognize it with the box art.

01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:37.700
Oh, it looks like a Disgaea Tactics-y type of game.

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.900
Yeah, it's a Tactics game.

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:41.300
I bet it's based on anime or something.

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:42.300
With maids.

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:43.300
Some of you in chat will know.

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:44.300
Well, of course.

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:45.300
Yeah.

01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:48.020
Somebody in chat, I bet, knows more about that.

01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:49.020
Mag.

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:50.020
Remember Mag?

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:51.020
Is also getting a price reduction.

01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:52.380
Goes into PlayStation 3 the best.

01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:54.820
Again, those are Japanese releases.

01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.260
Look at the handhelds really quick.

01:05:56.260 --> 01:06:01.060
On the PlayStation Vita, pretty busy week actually, Demon Gaze.

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:08.460
Yankai Totsuki Monster Monpiece, as well as Sakurosou no Pet no Kanojo.

01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:10.700
I'm assuming that's a pet sim game.

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:11.700
All on the Vita.

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:12.700
I don't know.

01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:14.500
It sounds about little girls.

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:16.700
On the Wii U, nothing.

01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:20.340
No more Wii U games until January 31st is the next one.

01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:24.540
On the Nintendo 3DS, however, ooh, also nothing.

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:26.300
Nothing really on the 3DS.

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:30.940
Nintendo has very little activity over there until February 7th is the Dragon Quest VII

01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:31.820
remake.

01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:35.580
I'm sure a lot of people will be very excited about that on the 3DS, which I can't imagine

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:36.860
they won't bring that over here.

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:39.380
Nintendo's having a nap.

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:40.380
Maybe a little bit.

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:41.380
So there you go.

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:42.380
Those are your Japanese releases.

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:44.380
Well, we only have two things for the UK.

01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:48.380
On the 24th, we have Strike Suit Zero and the 25th Devil May Cry.

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:49.700
Ah, yes.

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:51.260
Devil May Cry.

01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:52.260
That came out this week.

01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:53.260
Yeah.

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:54.260
I want to check it out.

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:55.260
I do.

01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:56.260
All right.

01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:59.220
A couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:00.220
Up first.

01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:01.220
Loki.

01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:02.220
All right.

01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:03.220
So let's talk about Majesco.

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:09.580
Now, Majesco is, I would say, not long for this world anymore.

01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:13.660
And they've, you know, definitely had some problems.

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:21.120
The company experienced a loss of 2.7 million as compared to, I guess, the 3.9 million loss

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.020
the previous year.

01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:31.700
And they said the revenues are up to 132.3 million, but concluded with a net income of

01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:34.440
4.6 million down 2 million from last year.

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:38.660
And let's be honest here, Majesco, they don't have a lot of games that they release anymore.

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:42.580
Cookie Mama is not selling like it used to.

01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:44.680
Their last say, need investing mama, right?

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:46.860
Was that the joke you made on Twitter?

01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:50.100
I don't remember.

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:51.280
But I mean, come on.

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:57.120
This is the company that decided that, hey, NBA Baller Beats is a good idea.

01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:03.920
So really, I mean, looking forward to what they have, they've only really got, they have

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:06.120
the Young Justice license.

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:09.440
So they've got that game coming out at the end of February.

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:13.960
But I mean, Majesco is not one of those companies that puts out these really huge AAA games

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:14.960
anymore.

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:15.960
They just don't.

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:22.680
And so it is kind of risky for them, because if these kind of non AAA titles don't sell

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.160
well, then it kind of sucks for them.

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:30.040
I mean, maybe Zumba is not selling as well as it used to, because I know they have Zumba.

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:34.280
That's their kind of big license right now.

01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:35.960
But I don't know.

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.240
No Zumba for the Wii U, I guess.

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:39.040
So I mean, that's what's hurting them.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:43.320
So you talking about that made me look, I'm like, how much is NBA Baller Beats right now?

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:45.200
Thirty four bucks on Amazon.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.680
Not going to fucking buy it.

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:48.360
That's the game with the basketball.

01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:52.880
I am sitting here going, I bet I could pry that one from my boss.

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.040
He's still got it in the packaging at his work.

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.280
It's just sitting there because it's about to bring it over.

01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:58.580
Let's do some live gameplay stream.

01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:01.840
Who wants to watch League of Legends when you can watch NBA Baller Beats?

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:02.840
Come on.

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.080
Uh, we'll get Dark Soccer to play one.

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:08.160
We'll call it two white guys play NBA Baller Beats.

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:09.160
I'll play.

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.160
There we go.

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.520
There are no ballers and no beats.

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:16.440
White men can't baller or beats.

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.080
Plenty of white guys can beat.

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.080
All right.

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:24.640
And then, of course, their stock closed down under one dollar.

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.160
They're down the 75 cents.

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:28.720
So hey, if you think they're going to make a comeback, maybe it's something to buy some

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:29.720
Majesco stock.

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:30.720
75 cents.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:32.720
That's not bad.

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:36.040
I wish it was much easier to just go online and buy some stock because I think it'll be

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:40.440
fun to just go buy like, you know, 10 shares of Majesco just to say like, hey, I own part

01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:41.960
of Majesco.

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:45.400
And then at the next shareholder meeting, you know, we can hold whoever accountable

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:48.840
came up with NBA Baller Beats, although supposedly the game is fun.

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:49.840
I should knock it.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:50.840
I haven't really played it.

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:54.160
So they're going to try football one next.

01:09:54.160 --> 01:10:00.800
I don't know how that would even work.

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:04.920
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Launch Radio on Vogue Network

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:07.520
dot com, use the passphrase yogurt.

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:08.800
All right.

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.540
Uh, one more story here.

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:13.220
This is about the next PlayStation controller.

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:16.780
You know, we had some rumors about this already, but now there's good.

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:17.780
There's more rumors.

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:18.780
No, no, no.

01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:19.780
That's good.

01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:21.020
They're just using this to illustrate the whole story.

01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:22.020
It is not the boomerang.

01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:23.020
People.

01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:24.020
It is not the boomer.

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:25.020
It's coming back like a boomerang.

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:30.620
But well, remember, remember when the boomerang thing was for the PlayStation three and everybody

01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:34.180
was like, no, that could have been comfortable.

01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:35.180
Who knows?

01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:39.940
I'm actually like, I mean, it looks so ridiculous.

01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:43.420
So bad, you know, it looks so ridiculous, but maybe it was comfortable.

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:44.420
I mean, I don't know.

01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:46.420
It doesn't look like it would be very comfortable to me.

01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:47.420
Well, whatever.

01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:48.420
It's gone.

01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:49.420
Okay.

01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:50.420
But now.

01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:51.420
Okay.

01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:52.420
So we've heard about this move thing that might like actually be like a transformer

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:56.020
and won't won't won't into the controller, right?

01:10:56.020 --> 01:11:01.580
But that's not what the latest rumors are, apparently, uh, according to a senior game

01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:08.100
studio in a conversation with CVG, uh, Sony is going to mix up the dual shock design.

01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:12.980
There's going to be biometric sensors on the grips and an LCD touch screen because,

01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:16.340
you know, that's, that's what everything's got to have now is a fricking touch screen.

01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:21.100
Um, apparently they are trying to emulate the same user interface philosophies as the

01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:23.180
PlayStation Vita.

01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:26.340
Look, I like the Vita and all.

01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:27.340
Okay.

01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:28.340
The touch screen's cool.

01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:32.100
The two analog sticks are cool, but the rear touch pad, let it go.

01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:34.100
Stop trying to make rear touch pad happen.

01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:35.100
Stop.

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:39.860
Don't you understand that reaching around is like, you know, it has some bad connotations

01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:40.860
to that.

01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:47.060
I mean, it's just even in DJ max, people who really like reaching around, even in DJ max,

01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:49.420
which I think does it better than most of the Vita games.

01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:54.060
Like I'm just like, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off.

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:59.940
Anyhow, I can get, I thought for a second there, there were, instead of, you know, leading

01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:04.460
up to, Oh yeah, we're doing all the, we're mimicking the control interface of the Vita.

01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:07.300
It was going to be, we're maybe in the control interface of the Wii U.

01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:11.820
I mean, cause that's basically, it's like, ah, we can't think of anything to do.

01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:16.460
So we're going to try to emulate Nintendo because we think they're, we don't even know

01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:18.700
if that stuff's going to even take off on the Wii U.

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:22.820
I mean, it's just, and I thought the whole thing is you wanted to push the Vita because,

01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:25.860
Hey, the Vita could be a second screen for these consoles or something.

01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:28.300
You need a reason to sell these things.

01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:33.500
Now, let's not say this would be a pretty awesome thing if they decide, Hey, the next

01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:37.660
gen console, it is going to be the Wii U that's going to be, or yeah, it is going to be Wii

01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:37.660


01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:41.100
No, it's going to be the Vita that they throw into the box.

01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:46.260
Like it comes with a Vita, you've got a Vita and you've got the PlayStation four, boom,

01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:47.700
right there, portable.

01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:52.260
And you know, you've got your console and you can take your controller when you go.

01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:53.820
I mean, cause I'm wrong.

01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:58.780
I bet it'd be pretty awesome if you could take that Wii U game tablet and stream games

01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:01.900
from a wifi spot somewhere else in the world.

01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:05.740
Kinda already do with the PlayStation three and the PSP for God's sake.

01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:05.980
Yeah.

01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:10.820
So wouldn't it be kind of awesome if you could do that or if you could, you know, play virtual

01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:12.340
console games on there, you can take that.

01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:16.900
I mean, it's a little bit big, but come on PS one classics and PS two classics, I'm talking

01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:19.460
about like the Wii U I'm just saying, you know, wouldn't it be awesome if you could

01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:20.500
do that with the Wii U controller?

01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:26.060
Um, you know, like, and again, it's pretty big, but people carry tablets around, so why

01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:26.260
not?

01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:27.020
All right.

01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:31.660
Regardless of whether this current rumor is factor crap or whatever, do you, how do you

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:36.540
feel about them redesigning the dual shock for all practical purposes at the point we're

01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:40.220
at now throwing out the six axis and everything, you know, the PlayStation three controller

01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:45.260
you get now is a very tiny evolution from the original PlayStation controller.

01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:47.500
I mean, really, I mean, granted.

01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:47.820
Okay.

01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:50.140
I guess the analog sticks came a little later.

01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:54.140
The very, very first PlayStation controllers didn't have them, but still the, the, the

01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:59.420
core of that controller has not changed that much since the beginning.

01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:01.580
It's like, if it's, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:03.660
I mean, seriously, I, I like the design now.

01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:06.620
So how do you feel about biometric sensors?

01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:07.420
I don't give a shit.

01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:12.540
I think it's honestly, I'll stick with my PC gaming regardless.

01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:16.060
I think it's gonna be a gimmick if biometric sensors are on the six axis.

01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:21.260
Um, yeah, it is a gimmick, but you know, it's a gimmick that also a lot of cell phone games

01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:25.900
and a lot of stuff, you know, uses, uh, yeah, no one really uses six axis anymore, but even

01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:29.900
like, it seems like a lot of the stuff that Sony has been doing lately has just been to

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:34.540
kind of mimic, I mean, cause even with the, we, everybody got into the emotion gaming

01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:38.700
right after the, we, Oh yeah, we've been working on the move controller since, you know, a

01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:39.580
long time ago.

01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:41.100
You know, come on.

01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:42.460
It just, it never took off.

01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:45.820
And now, you know, some of these patents that we see look really ridiculous.

01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:49.340
I mean, no one's going to fucking strap move controllers to your feet and do like a flip

01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:50.780
kick in your goddamn living room.

01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:51.580
No, it's going to do that.

01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:56.060
So they need to come up with a new, they need to come up with something new.

01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:57.580
They need to come out with the wow factor.

01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:01.260
Cause if you're fucking emulating someone else or doing the same shit you're doing now,

01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:02.140
no one's going to care.

01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:03.980
No one's going to be like, why do I have to buy this?

01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:05.660
I can already fucking do that now.

01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:08.620
That's really what it comes down to is the wow factor.

01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:10.380
That's what's going to sell your console.

01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:11.180
All right.

01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:14.540
Let's travel back in time to a time when you know what?

01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:17.420
The controller, it was a stick and a button and you liked it.

01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:17.980
That's it.

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.260
One stick, one button.

01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:20.700
Hey, we have more buttons for this one.

01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:21.020
All right.

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:25.100
Maybe this game isn't quite that old, but it's still a classic.

01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:29.180
So let's dive into the gaming vault where dark soccer is going to pick out an oldie

01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:32.700
moldy video game and say, Hey, play it.

01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:33.820
Cause it's cool.

01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:35.020
You probably forgot about it.

01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:35.900
It is a cool one.

01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:37.660
And probably not many people have seen it.

01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:43.660
Um, the classic game, um, in Japan was called, um, Zexex.

01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:45.260
I think I'm pronouncing it right.

01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:47.740
Cause it's X E X E X over here.

01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:49.420
We had it as Oreos.

01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:54.060
It was, uh, it came out in 1991, a side schooling shooting game, and it was actually really

01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:55.260
unique for its time.

01:15:56.060 --> 01:16:00.700
Uh, Konami was really influenced by a lot of stuff that, um, Irem put out.

01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:04.620
It actually has the influences from R-Type, which everyone knows R-Type is among one of

01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:05.820
my favorite games.

01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:12.620
And, um, the tentacle mechanics that came from X-Multiply, it did not at all get a home

01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:18.220
release until it came out with Salamander portable that came out on the PSP, which,

01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:21.260
um, somebody in this room enabled me to get that game for my husband.

01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:21.980
Thank you, Loki.

01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:28.220
Um, it actually, it's, it's really, really an amazing shooter.

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:34.140
Um, it had some, um, really, um, interesting, um, mechanics.

01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:39.900
Um, what happened with this one, like I said, it's similar to R-Type and X-Multiply.

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:45.260
You play a ship called the flintlock that has this detachable orb called a flint and

01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:47.820
it acts sort of like, um, R-Type's force.

01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:55.180
Um, so you can get power ups to, uh, uh, boost, uh, Flint's power, your movement, your, uh,

01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:57.180
changing your weapon, increase your life count.

01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:02.220
But, um, there are a bunch of changes that came out though in the non-Japanese versions.

01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:07.020
Um, some of them being, they removed all but one of the upgradable weapons and they changed

01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:07.900
the enemy patterns.

01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:14.780
Um, for different weapons, um, in, in the US, um, there was only the proton laser.

01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:20.620
Um, in the Japanese version, you start with a proton laser and then you get a homing laser,

01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:26.220
a shadow laser, a round laser, a spiral laser, which is a lot like the Gradius ripple, um,

01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:29.820
a search laser that's a kind of like a homing laser and a ground laser.

01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:36.860
It's very similar to, um, the, uh, the fire one that would travel across the floor from R-Type.

01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:41.900
And so basically the story of the game, you have to save the princess named Irene from

01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:47.020
the East, uh, from the planet East Square from an evil dude named Klaus.

01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:50.860
And there's different cut scenes and she's crying for help and she's tortured.

01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:57.420
And so you have to, um, basically, uh, go through the game and there's naked people

01:17:57.420 --> 01:17:58.860
in the ending of the game, just saying.

01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:07.660
But, but the big thing about, um, Zexix that I thought was really

01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:13.180
amazing and Rob, you can see this right in front of you, is, um, the level design.

01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:17.660
I mean, for 1991, I mean, this, the backgrounds look like shit right out of Tron.

01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:21.820
I mean, seriously, you've got, uh, very.

01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:23.580
Well, I like the little tentacle shots.

01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:26.700
The thing does like it shoots out of these little 10.

01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:28.940
I actually had never really heard of this game.

01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:35.740
So Zexix is a really, I definitely see the Gradius inspired-ness in it, but, um,

01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:40.700
but a lot of the, the use of the flint is definitely like using the Force and R-Type.

01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:45.580
Um, the game is actually pretty challenging.

01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:47.180
It's a really difficult game.

01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:53.260
And, um, I thankfully got to play, um, a copy, uh, a while back off of the Supergun.

01:18:54.460 --> 01:18:57.820
Um, so this was ages ago.

01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:02.700
I mean, this is actually a game that I don't know if it's, um, if they've gotten it to

01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:07.820
work on MAME yet, I'd have to check because Zexix is like, it's seriously one of the classics

01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:09.340
when it comes to, to shooters.

01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:15.580
It's not a bullet hell, definitely by any means, but it requires a lot of steady, um,

01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:20.060
movement, a lot of, uh, really good reflex to make your way through it.

01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:22.380
And it's just an amazing game.

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:27.740
So I would say, um, unfortunately, the only way to get ahold of it for any type of home

01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:31.340
version is getting the, um, PSP version.

01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:37.980
It's, uh, again, under the, um, Salamander portable, uh, and it's also, you can find

01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:40.300
this really inexpensive for PSP.

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:41.180
It didn't cost a lot.

01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:45.980
I think when I bought it new, it was like 30 bucks and that's, you know, an import.

01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:48.460
And of course there's no region lockout on the PSP.

01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:52.060
So the chatters are saying it is in MAME.

01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:55.740
If you want to, if you want to turn to the dark side of the internet where everybody

01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:59.260
left, well, I haven't touched anything on MAME in ages.

01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:03.580
Dan and I are probably going to be making a new cab soon, but, um, but seriously, if

01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:07.900
anyone loves shooting games and especially if you're a fan of Konami shooters and love

01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:10.780
Irem shooters, you really owe it to yourself to play this one.

01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:12.060
ZEC6 is a great game.

01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:14.940
And that's it.

01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:15.980
All right.

01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:16.460
There it is.

01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:17.980
Your classic game of the week.

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:18.480
ZEC6.

01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:21.180
Over here it was called Orius.

01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:22.860
Or Orius.

01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:26.540
If you happen to find an arcade cab of it, take a picture of it for me, please.

01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:28.380
All right.

01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:33.980
We are going to come back after a quick break here with more of Orange Lounge Radio, including

01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:37.580
a game we've talked about a bit here on Orange Lounge Radio, finally official this week.

01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:41.340
We're going to talk about Disney Infinity when we come back with more of Orange Lounge

01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:43.100
Radio right after this.

01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:56.300
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live with the 490th episode of our program

01:20:56.940 --> 01:21:00.620
for this January the 20th of 2013.

01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:04.140
I hope those of you guys that have an extended weekend here in the States make the most of

01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:04.620
it.

01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:08.140
Let's let us not forget, though, the memory of Martin Luther King Jr.

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:11.420
The reason why we have the weekend.

01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:15.180
In fact, I was going to play the I have a dream speech during the break tonight, but

01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:17.660
it's like 18 minutes, which is a little bit long for a break.

01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:22.780
But I encourage you all, you know, just as a little reminder of, uh, you know, what we've

01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:25.260
been through, uh, take a listen to it.

01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:29.740
Uh, also, uh, I wanted to talk getting back to games a little bit.

01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:33.260
I promised, um, at the start of Part B because I forgot to talk about this during my gaming

01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:33.660
week.

01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:36.460
I want to talk about Wake Up Club on the PlayStation Vita.

01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:38.220
Have you guys heard about this game?

01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:39.900
And I use that term very loosely.

01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:43.820
Have you guys have you guys heard that a game at all or play they played that game?

01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:44.700
Heard about it?

01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:46.140
Anybody know?

01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:48.300
Okay, so I downloaded it today.

01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:49.500
Did you have you checked it out at all?

01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:49.900
No.

01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:50.460
Okay.

01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:54.780
It's this app for the PlayStation Vita, and it basically, you know, you can choose, you

01:21:54.780 --> 01:22:00.220
know, from these different skins that are alarm clocks or whatever, like, um, you know,

01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:03.900
like a motor storm background or a journey background or whatever.

01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:07.020
And, you know, you can do the little alarm clock, but what you do is that when you're

01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:10.620
on the clock, you tell it what time you want to get up or whatever you put it to sleep.

01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:15.260
And then what happens is in the morning, it goes off, beep, beep, beep or whatever.

01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:19.180
And you have to actually tap your icon, which is moving around the screen.

01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:20.140
You have to tap it.

01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:22.460
And that signals to it that you've woken up.

01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:27.340
Now, what happens is that you've been paired up with 12 people who are getting up the same

01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:28.300
time issue.

01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:33.580
And so once you wake up, you can basically tap other people and it will send, I guess

01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:35.100
it sends noises to their Vita.

01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:38.620
I don't, I've always been the first one up, so I don't know what happens, but like, I

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:42.380
guess you tap the other icons and actually sends like voices to their Vita and tries

01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:42.860
to get them up.

01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:45.020
So it's like this whole like social network game.

01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:46.620
Wake up.

01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:47.020
Exactly.

01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:47.820
Wake up.

01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:48.700
Wake up.

01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:50.460
So calling it a game is a little weird.

01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:57.180
It's more of an app, but I got to say like taunted all you want, but the gamification

01:22:57.180 --> 01:23:00.700
of an alarm clock is a pretty neat idea.

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:01.420
I've got to say.

01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:07.980
And why, especially this is interesting on the Vita is that if you think about it, this

01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:13.500
gives people a reason to remember they have a Vita for real.

01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:17.020
I mean, there hasn't been a whole lot on the PlayStation Vita that like people have

01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:18.460
gotten that excited about.

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:22.700
And I'm not saying like wake up club is the Vita system saver.

01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:27.980
No, nobody's going to buy a Vita just for silly wake up club, but something that gets

01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:35.580
the PlayStation Vita into your daily routine is a really smart move on Sony's part.

01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:37.500
I don't know if I'm giving them too much credit.

01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:41.900
Like if they really thought that that's what they were going to try to do, but if that

01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:46.220
was what they were going for, well played thoughts.

01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:51.180
I can see how it would be interesting and definitely it's a way to keep the Vita in

01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:56.060
the, like you said, putting it in someone's daily routine will keep it constantly in their

01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:56.460
eye.

01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:59.820
You know, like my, for example, I know it's not exactly the same, but having my iPhone,

01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:00.860
it's my alarm clock.

01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:05.580
You know, I keep in touch with my family through it, you know, texting all the time.

01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:07.740
I even use it at work now with text write off.

01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:12.700
But, but I mean, I'm saying, you know, it's, it's something that's part of my routine.

01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:15.740
So trying to incorporate the Vita as part of someone's routine actually gives people

01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:19.100
fresh and keeps it in the user's eyes.

01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:21.500
So they'll want to use it more often.

01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:22.940
I can see the logic behind it.

01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:24.460
I mean, and they gamified it.

01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:28.220
It's got trophies and you see the ranking of where you wake up.

01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:29.580
Well, now that's just silly.

01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:32.140
I know it's, it's a little silly, but it's silly.

01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:36.700
You know, it's more exciting than the iPhone alarm clock or the one that sits on your

01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:38.300
wall and goes, yep.

01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:41.820
But my iPhone alarm clock wakes me up to I'm sexy and I know it.

01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:43.820
Okay, that's true.

01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:45.340
I guess, I guess the Vita can't do that.

01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:47.580
You can make kitty noises.

01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:48.380
You can't have that.

01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:50.300
I can have kitty noises on my iPhone too.

01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:55.980
I can download a ringtone, but I can't necessarily, you know, wake other people up with it except

01:24:55.980 --> 01:24:56.700
for my husband.

01:24:57.900 --> 01:25:02.940
Now I will say in my experience with wake up club, I still suffer from the rollover

01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:06.700
hit it to wake up, wake up the other people.

01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:07.100
All right.

01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:08.380
And then I go, it's cold.

01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:09.260
I'm going back to bed.

01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:12.460
You know, you made me, it hasn't really made me get up.

01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:13.980
You made me think of the alarm clock.

01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:16.860
Now that requires people to stand on it, to turn it off.

01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:17.740
Oh my God.

01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:22.140
And so I saw pictures on Tumblr of people like laying half in their bed with their face

01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:24.940
on the alarm clock to register the pressure.

01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:25.980
And they're still asleep.

01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:26.860
See, that would be me.

01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:28.300
I learned how to do it in my sleep.

01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:30.140
I turn off my iPhone all the time in my sleep.

01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:33.100
I need the Vita to give me an electric shock to really wake me up.

01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:35.820
Oh God.

01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:38.220
No, no, not the sounds of my mother waking me up.

01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:38.940
Rab.

01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:39.260
Rab.

01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:40.380
You're going to be late for work.

01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:41.100
Rab.

01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:41.580
That's it.

01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:42.300
That's what you need.

01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:44.940
If you get fired from your job, Rab, you're going to be homeless.

01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:46.780
Rab, you are not moving in here Rab.

01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:48.220
Rab.

01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:49.020
That's it.

01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:49.660
That's it.

01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:50.780
That's the, okay.

01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:53.980
This is a copyright orange on radio and me and Rab.

01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:57.980
This is your mom, the alarm clock.

01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:00.140
That's what we need to invent Rab.

01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:01.180
Your mom, the alarm clock.

01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:06.620
All it is is whoever's mother going, get out of bed.

01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:07.740
It's time for school.

01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:12.460
No, actually at my house would be this and I have to hold this away.

01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:16.140
Jamie get out of bed.

01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:23.260
Now my throat hurts extra bad, but that would have been, um, my mom when I was in school.

01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:24.780
Neighbors are going to call the police.

01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:25.900
Sorry, Rab's neighbors.

01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:30.540
All right.

01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:31.740
That was my mom.

01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:32.780
That's wake up club.

01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:34.140
I just wanted to throw that out there.

01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:35.820
It is, it is a thing that happened this week.

01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:38.620
I forgot to talk about it because it's a game, but it's not.

01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:43.180
But you know, again, and Raginator in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, yeah,

01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:44.780
Rab, way too much credit.

01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:49.820
Whether it was a moment of genius amongst idiocy.

01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:50.860
I don't know.

01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:56.700
But all I'm saying is that if the Vita thinks of more things like this, let's gamify things

01:26:56.700 --> 01:26:57.500
that people do.

01:26:58.140 --> 01:27:03.500
How about like an interactive cookbook, a recipe thing like, you know, recipes for bachelors.

01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:10.380
I would have to grow arms and smack my hand every time I say, I wonder what it'd be like

01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:11.900
if I put this in it.

01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:12.700
I can't bake.

01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:14.460
All right.

01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:15.740
Uh, let's go to some rapid fire news.

01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:18.700
Talk about some other video game news happening around the industry right now.

01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:19.900
I'm sorry for Rab's neighbors.

01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:21.260
It's all right.

01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:21.740
They'll deal.

01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:22.460
Logie.

01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:23.340
All right.

01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:28.540
Um, so let's talk a little bit about, uh, the survey that they sent out for call of

01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:35.260
duty and it's kind of, um, hinting at some stuff that may be available, um, for the next,

01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:41.580
uh, iteration of it and includes like stuff, you know, saying, Hey, what kind of special

01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:43.180
things do you want at retail?

01:27:43.180 --> 01:27:47.420
So some of the stuff that, um, was, they came out of there, they were seeing a care package

01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:48.460
show pieces.

01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:52.540
Um, some of the things that they may include with the care package edition would be like

01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:53.980
a character of statuette.

01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:58.860
They send operational desktop century gun replica, which sounds fucking awesome.

01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:00.460
I would totally dig that.

01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:04.700
And then, um, there's a collectible sets featuring characters, vehicles, and scenery from the

01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:10.540
game, similar to like the hago or the halo mega block stuff, custom branded audio sound

01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:17.500
bar, lame custom branded gaming headset, also lame and custom branded wireless router.

01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:23.340
No, just don't operational desktop century gun.

01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:25.180
There's your winning, uh, pick right there.

01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:28.060
And, uh, they had some other pictures from it.

01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:32.620
Of course they took them down because of NDA, uh, they're saying also that, um, you know,

01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:36.300
that there might be a digital version to pre download to your console and then it'll be

01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:41.820
available to play at 1201 am on launch day, which is kind of cool if they did that.

01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:46.140
Um, and it says maybe that'll be something that'll be featured in next gen consoles,

01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:50.380
being able to kind of pre download stuff like you can on steam, like steamer or a world

01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:52.060
of Warcraft did that with the expansions.

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:53.900
Honestly, I don't know why they can't do that.

01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:57.900
I mean, they've got day one patches, you know, and stuff.

01:28:58.860 --> 01:28:59.900
Well, let me put this away.

01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:04.220
Day one patches might not be a good way to go because let's say for example, you do that.

01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:09.020
Um, yeah, cause if they did with the console version, um, and you weren't able to connect

01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:10.780
online, it would never be able to play your game.

01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:15.500
But let's just say that they were able to lock that out to just the digital version.

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:15.980
Why not?

01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:21.100
Why not have it built in where you can download the game and then piracy, you know, piracy

01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:23.580
is gone as far as print link before a release.

01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:25.260
I don't know.

01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:25.980
Sounds like a good idea.

01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:31.180
Um, and then there's some, um, pretty good news here.

01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:39.580
Uh, Skyrim, all the wonderful, uh, DLC that you've been missing on the PS3.

01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:40.940
It's finally coming.

01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:46.540
Um, Dragonborn, the latest expansion for the game, it's going to be hitting PC on February

01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:51.820
5th and then, uh, also in February, all the other expansions are going to be coming out

01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:54.620
as well on, uh, PS3.

01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:59.020
And I believe they're even offering them at half cost for the first.

01:29:59.020 --> 01:29:59.900
Sorry, it's late.

01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:01.100
Sorry.

01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:02.700
It's not bad.

01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:09.100
I bought, I bought them all half off on, um, on PC and building the house and hearth fire

01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:11.660
is kind of cool, I guess.

01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:12.460
Um, I don't know.

01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:16.380
I don't like the orphan kids saying, you know, Hey, you can adopt me.

01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:19.100
No, I'm not going to adopt you.

01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:22.060
Cause if it goes anything like Fable was, I never came home.

01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:24.140
And you can't kill the kids cause that's wrong.

01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:27.260
And you can't even do that in Skyrim.

01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:29.900
Although I'm sure, I'm sure somebody hacked it in.

01:30:29.900 --> 01:30:32.060
I'm sure some sicko hacked it.

01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:34.140
Of course you can do it on the PC.

01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:36.540
You see what PC gaming supports Dark Sakura?

01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:38.700
I wasn't paying attention.

01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:39.260
Sorry.

01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:39.980
Killing children.

01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:43.980
And for some reason, when I'd leave all of the women, all their clothes come off.

01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:45.900
I don't really know why that's happened.

01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:47.100
Sickos on the PC.

01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:47.740
I know.

01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:48.860
It's so weird.

01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:54.380
Also have a torture chamber with slave maidens, but Hey, I've got the PC sicko story to top

01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:56.380
all of this coming up, but hold on.

01:30:56.380 --> 01:30:56.860
All right.

01:30:56.860 --> 01:30:58.540
I think I need to get Skyrim now.

01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:03.420
And then, uh, last but not least La Milana and Leisure Suit Larry are some of the titles

01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:09.020
that are included on the next, um, steam green light, including, and this is pretty cool.

01:31:09.020 --> 01:31:15.820
They've got, um, let's see here, DLC quest, which honestly wasn't a very long game, but

01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:24.620
cool, uh, eat or masters of the broken world, Mac, um, the age of decadence, Yun pick and

01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:29.580
war for the overworld are some of the other titles that are going to be coming out.

01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:32.220
Um, let's see here.

01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:40.380
And, uh, a con a con Nero demon hunters, which I think, isn't that that, um, yeah, I want

01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:45.020
to see, isn't that the, uh, that new game that they're working on, uh, was it America

01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:45.820
McGee or something?

01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:49.980
I think that's that American McGee game, if I want to remember correctly.

01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:55.420
And then also a grow Brodo modeling app, which is actually, um, software.

01:31:55.420 --> 01:32:01.660
And then the articity draft game design tool is another non gaming thing that got green

01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:01.900
lit.

01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:07.820
So, um, just so you know, La Milana, that was a game that, you know, uh, dark Tetsuya

01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:09.900
used to write about a lot on orange launch radio.com.

01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:11.180
He was very excited about it.

01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:14.780
I actually went to dark Tetsuya and I said, could I get a quote, sir, about how you feel

01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:16.780
about La Milana getting the project green light?

01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:17.740
And this is what he had to say.

01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:27.340
That was an actual Kermit flail, by the way, that was an actual real deal Kermit flail.

01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:32.460
Just, you know, uh, I don't know if anybody was Kermit flailing over this more like the

01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:37.580
fuck, but, um, people are modding Alan wake on the PC.

01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:39.660
Of course that's, that's what people do to PC games.

01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:40.700
They mod them.

01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:46.300
Um, but what, I guess apparently it wasn't supposed to be moddable.

01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:49.500
It was supposed to have permissions, licenses, whatever that ain't going to hackers going

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:51.020
to hack hackers going to hack.

01:32:51.020 --> 01:32:52.300
And you got to love this.

01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:56.860
They, they did all 2.9 gigs, unraveled it, put it back together.

01:32:56.860 --> 01:32:59.900
And what was the community tool that they put out?

01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:03.020
What did they put out in response to you'll never hack Alan wake.

01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:10.380
Somebody put a hello Kitty flashlight into Alan wake where the little flashlight will

01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:12.700
always be the little hello Kitty image.

01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:15.580
When it shines on the wall, you see, you can see the little bullet.

01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:19.180
Let me see if in the video, you get a little, a better shot to see it.

01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:20.060
You can kind of see it there.

01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:22.220
See hello, Kitty flashlight.

01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:23.420
That's awesome.

01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:25.740
Cause that's what my Alan wake needs.

01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:26.860
And I can kill the bad guys.

01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:30.860
Little shadows with hello, Kitty killing with cuteness.

01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:32.140
I can't.

01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:36.860
Well, this, I don't even know what the hell to say about this.

01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:39.820
Uh, this community could have used a little bit of a cuteness.

01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:41.340
Cause this was just stupid.

01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:43.740
In fact, this is one of the stupidest things I've ever seen in gaming.

01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:48.140
Like ever, uh, dark, dark, dark, dark Sakura.

01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:49.580
Did you see this?

01:33:50.220 --> 01:33:50.780
Fuckery.

01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:57.260
This is the pre-order bonus for the European Australian island.

01:33:57.260 --> 01:33:59.180
Riptide zombie bait edition.

01:33:59.180 --> 01:33:59.500
What?

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:00.540
It's a collector's edition.

01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:00.860
No, whatever.

01:34:00.860 --> 01:34:02.300
Not pre-order bonus, whatever.

01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:03.820
Severed limbs for everybody.

01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:04.860
Collector's edition.

01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:10.060
It is a severed torso of an apparently British female.

01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:14.860
And I'm only guessing that because she's got the little union Jack bra thing going

01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:20.780
for her, but she is all bloodified, decapitated, armless and limbless.

01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:22.300
It is gross.

01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:24.540
Who would want this in their house?

01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:31.820
And especially kind of fucking tacky to announce this type of thing.

01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:36.300
The day that Joe Biden is sitting down with a video game industry to talk about, you

01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:40.380
know, what is there a correlation between that, blah, blah, blah.

01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:45.500
Now, before y'all correct me, I am aware it was the Europe and Australian pre-order

01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:46.140
bonus.

01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:50.700
So they were the ones to announce it, not the U S arm of the company.

01:34:51.740 --> 01:34:56.380
However, somebody finally figured, you know, maybe this is kind of tacky.

01:34:56.380 --> 01:34:58.780
Maybe we don't really need this.

01:34:58.780 --> 01:35:01.740
Maybe, maybe this is just in bad taste.

01:35:02.860 --> 01:35:06.940
And so they came out and said, we sincerely regret this choice and we're committed to

01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:09.260
making sure this will never happen again.

01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:13.180
Although does that what happens to the people that already pre-ordered it?

01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:13.820
Does this mean?

01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:15.740
I don't know if they even say it won't happen again.

01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:17.740
They didn't say we're going to pull this.

01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:18.860
We're not going to sell this.

01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:20.060
They don't mention that at all.

01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:22.220
They're just saying we won't do this again.

01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:25.740
Nothing to stop us from doing that.

01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:28.860
Nothing said that they're going to stop doing it now.

01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:31.180
They just said, oh, well, we're not going to do it again.

01:35:32.380 --> 01:35:36.540
Alan alchemy in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says it's super sexed up and gross.

01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:38.380
It's for neckbeards to fat too.

01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:39.740
See, that's the sick thing.

01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:45.980
Like this is sick already, but then you have to realize because it is an inanimate object,

01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:47.820
somebody will stick their dick in it.

01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:53.180
And that makes it like 10 times, like a million times worse as if this could even get worse.

01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:55.820
You realize somebody's going to put their dick in it.

01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:58.380
And it's just like, this is, this is too much.

01:35:58.380 --> 01:35:59.820
That was a joke already made that.

01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:01.340
Yeah, just saying.

01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:06.060
Oh, but it doesn't end there.

01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:12.380
A new game was made this week by the encyclopedia dramatica forums.

01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:13.020
One of their members.

01:36:13.020 --> 01:36:13.740
Oh, go figure.

01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:17.980
Called bullet to the head of the NRA.

01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:22.060
Yes, that is the name of the game bullet to the head of the NRA.

01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:24.060
It is a first person shooter.

01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:29.500
If you want to call it that, that lets you, you just shoot NRA boss, Wayne LaPierre.

01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:39.500
The intent of this game was to do nothing, but to just piss people off and imagine encyclopedia

01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:44.220
dramatica releasing something that would just piss people off, quote, share this everywhere,

01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:47.500
especially gun nut and anti-game websites.

01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:51.740
Also see if you can't send it to the NRA somehow, like through the feedback on their website

01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:52.540
or something.

01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:54.700
This is from forum user gizmo.

01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:59.980
Oh, 1942, who also is developing a game based on the Sandy Hook shooting.

01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:06.380
You will actually get to go to the Connecticut school and shoot kids because there's always

01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:08.540
going to be that guy on the internet.

01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:14.540
Dark Sakura, you look like you're about to just like, you're doing people, you're doing

01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:15.900
the SMH thing over there.

01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:17.740
Like SMH.

01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:18.780
Shaking my head.

01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:19.180
Oh.

01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:20.460
Or SMGDH.

01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:21.500
Shaking my goddamn head.

01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:23.020
I just don't get people.

01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:24.140
I really don't though.

01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:24.620
It's fine.

01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:25.980
Well, here we are talking about it.

01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:27.900
So maybe the troll one, I don't know.

01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:28.620
Yeah, fuck them.

01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:29.740
It's an attention grab.

01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:30.380
Nothing more.

01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:34.460
But you know, you know, somebody's going to get this and be all, you know, his attention

01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:36.220
is going to grab Fox news.

01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:36.700
Yeah.

01:37:36.700 --> 01:37:43.020
But I like to file this, this stuff under the, uh, the banner of no incur now.

01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:43.900
No one important.

01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:50.780
Now somebody did point out this came out one day after the NRA had put out their own gun

01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:55.180
game, NRA practice range, which is available on the iOS.

01:37:55.180 --> 01:37:57.340
It is rated for ages four and up.

01:37:58.620 --> 01:37:59.820
Of course, that's all target.

01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:01.900
It's target practice, target practice.

01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:02.460
So it's okay.

01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:04.220
Here's a question, right?

01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:07.260
I know this is rapid fire news and I'm not going very rapidly, but you know, there's

01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:08.460
a lot to say about this stuff.

01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:10.460
Would you let a four year old play point blank?

01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:17.100
Um, it's a gun game, but it's, it's carnival guns.

01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:22.860
It's, it's not, this is though, where my stance is with this is that if I were a parent,

01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:26.300
I wouldn't let a child watch TV until they were older than five.

01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:28.300
Good luck with that.

01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:31.580
That's what, that was our plan.

01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:32.300
That didn't happen.

01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:36.220
I know plenty of parents who have been very successful with it just because, and I come

01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:41.420
from that just because I've seen the difference of behavior with Becky's son when he's

01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:46.300
allowed to play games and watch TV versus when he's limited access to playing games

01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:47.180
and watching TV.

01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:51.500
He's a lot happier of a kid when he gets to go outside and play more often.

01:38:52.060 --> 01:38:58.380
So, um, I don't think I would allow, if I were a parent, I wouldn't allow TV or video

01:38:58.380 --> 01:39:02.780
games until they were old enough to actually have more of a comprehension factor attached

01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:03.100
to it.

01:39:03.740 --> 01:39:04.380
That's just me.

01:39:05.260 --> 01:39:07.100
You know, and I certainly wouldn't let it be a babysitter.

01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:11.340
Let's move on to some more rapid fire news, dark soccer.

01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:16.780
Um, well, you know how people were a little excited about Epic Mickey too?

01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:21.580
Well, they were only a little excited because they only sold 270,000 copies in North America,

01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:26.060
which is about, oh, a million less than, uh, the first one did.

01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:26.860
Yeah.

01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:28.780
The first one sold 1.3 million.

01:39:28.780 --> 01:39:29.100
Yeah.

01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:29.900
Not even close.

01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:30.860
Sorry.

01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:33.420
And the creator thinks they're going to do more.

01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.740
So, uh, that'd be great when Disney shuts them down.

01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:44.540
Um, now there's also, um, six weeks of free, um, PS mobile games.

01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:47.020
It's going to be starting with Samurai Beatdown.

01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:54.220
Um, you can get that on the PlayStation store and it's either for Vita or PlayStation certified

01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:55.100
mobile devices.

01:39:56.220 --> 01:40:01.180
And it's only going to be available in Japan, US, UK, Canada, France, Italy, Germany, Spain,

01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:02.300
and Australia.

01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:04.140
So if you live in Zimbabwe, you're fucked.

01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:12.140
And then for fans of Shin Megami Tensei, um, Devil Summoner Soul Hackers is going to be

01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:13.820
out in the US in April.

01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:19.820
It's been set to release on 16th of April and, uh, nothing about our, uh, friends in

01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:23.660
the UK if they're going to see anything, but, uh, who knows?

01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:31.820
It's also, um, a, uh, 3DS remake of the one that came out in the Sega Saturn in 1997.

01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:33.020
Done.

01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:35.500
All right.

01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:38.940
How about we go to the frugal question of the week?

01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:39.820
How about we?

01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:40.460
How about it?

01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:41.180
How about it, huh?

01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:54.140
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, Google Plus at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:54.700
Put them together.

01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:55.980
You get frugal.

01:40:56.860 --> 01:40:58.140
Here's our frugal question of the week.

01:40:58.940 --> 01:41:01.340
We didn't talk about this story tonight, but I guess we will now.

01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:05.740
A settlement was reached this week between the actor that portrayed Kevin Butler and

01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:06.460
Sony.

01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:10.860
You may recall that the actor was spotted in a commercial for a tire store playing a

01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:12.140
Nintendo Wii.

01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:14.220
This got us thinking about commercials and marketing.

01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:16.300
That's really all there is to say on that story.

01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:17.900
Legal issues settled out of court.

01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:18.620
What else is new?

01:41:20.860 --> 01:41:25.100
But since it got us thinking about commercials and marketing and like how, how, how big of

01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:27.580
an impact does somebody like Kevin Butler really have?

01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:33.020
So we went to frugal and we asked the listeners, has a gaming system or game commercial or

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:36.460
advertising campaign ever worked on you?

01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:39.900
Were it swayed you to make the decision to buy a game new?

01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:44.220
Was it something you experienced more in your youth or something you still find might tilt

01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:45.180
your opinion today?

01:41:45.180 --> 01:41:49.500
Like I know a lot of us like we remember like Genesis does what Nintendo and some of those

01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:53.420
I'm just saying when PlayStation 4 comes out, they better bring him fucking back because

01:41:53.420 --> 01:41:55.900
that that that's how you sell that shit.

01:41:56.140 --> 01:41:59.740
Not creepy babies, but fucking Kevin Butler is saying, I'm back, bitches.

01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:00.860
Buy this shit.

01:42:00.860 --> 01:42:01.260
Boom!

01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:02.940
I don't think that can happen now.

01:42:02.940 --> 01:42:03.660
Why?

01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:05.980
Because the whole legal stuff and all that.

01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:07.900
So throw enough money at him.

01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:09.820
I'm sure he'll be like, oh, legal smeagle, whatever.

01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:11.980
I'll put this in my pocket.

01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:12.780
That's true.

01:42:12.780 --> 01:42:13.340
Money talks.

01:42:13.340 --> 01:42:13.580
All right.

01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:18.780
Let's go to the folks on Facebook and Google and see if advertising campaigns ever actually

01:42:18.780 --> 01:42:19.500
worked on them.

01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:20.940
We'll start with Tiger Claw on Facebook.

01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:25.660
I've seen many commercials for the latest gaming consoles and neither one has swayed

01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:26.460
me into buying one.

01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:31.100
I always believe the only way to make a decision whether to buy the console or not is to actually

01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:31.900
try it.

01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:33.340
Like the kiosks at the stores.

01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:38.380
Rageinator says as a kid in the early 80s before I became as jaded as I am today.

01:42:38.380 --> 01:42:38.780
Yeah.

01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:43.420
But then again, commercials that were our marketing towards young kids typically work.

01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:48.860
Llama Juice says, look at it for the point of view as someone who isn't educated on video

01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:49.980
games consoles.

01:42:49.980 --> 01:42:52.860
The average mom out there buying a game system for their kid.

01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:53.980
They don't know the difference.

01:42:53.980 --> 01:42:57.900
If they see more commercials for console A instead of console B, then they'll assume

01:42:57.900 --> 01:43:00.060
console A is better on the flip side.

01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:01.820
Think about the commercials for the Ouya.

01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:03.980
It's something that everyone was uneducated about.

01:43:03.980 --> 01:43:06.700
And then the ads for it got a mountain of people excited.

01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:10.460
That being said, as a kid, the commercials for the engage always got me.

01:43:10.460 --> 01:43:12.700
I wanted one of those things so badly as a kid.

01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:15.980
You were a kid when the engage came out.

01:43:15.980 --> 01:43:18.060
I was in my 20s commercials for the Ouya.

01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:21.020
Yeah, I didn't know there were commercials for the Ouya.

01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:22.220
Is that maybe online?

01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:25.340
I don't think there's commercials for the Ouya at all.

01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:26.940
I mean, there's the video.

01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:31.260
Probably because people were uneducated about it.

01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:33.420
And then the ads for it got a mountain of people excited.

01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:33.820
I don't know.

01:43:36.860 --> 01:43:41.020
Dark Tetsuya said, I did go to see the wizard when I heard Super Mario Brothers 3 was going

01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:41.740
to debut in it.

01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:42.940
Does that count?

01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:47.020
That was like the best product placement ever done in the history of ever.

01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:47.260
Yeah.

01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:50.860
I have to admit that I was interested.

01:43:50.860 --> 01:43:55.100
Who didn't get a gigantic nerd boner when they went and saw the wizard and saw Super

01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:57.500
Mario 3 like the first footage?

01:43:57.500 --> 01:44:00.060
There has never been a better promotion ever.

01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:01.660
I firmly believe that.

01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:06.460
And the Power Glove, which by the way, I'm sorry, the Power Glove was a piece of shit.

01:44:06.460 --> 01:44:07.180
It really was.

01:44:07.180 --> 01:44:09.020
It was so shitty.

01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:11.980
That and the U Force were both shitacular shit devices.

01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:13.820
I already had a Power Glove when I saw that movie.

01:44:13.820 --> 01:44:14.780
And wasn't it shit?

01:44:14.780 --> 01:44:15.580
Yes, it was.

01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:17.420
It was absolute fucking shit.

01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:19.660
But it's so bad.

01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:23.820
It was like, this is cool, except wait, I can't do shit with this.

01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:28.540
You see the U Force in the little print ad, like playing punch out, and you think, oh

01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:29.260
my God.

01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:31.580
Nintendo, bring back the Power Glove.

01:44:31.580 --> 01:44:35.740
I mean, seriously, that would be fucking awesome if it worked right.

01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:40.060
When they have haptic gloves, they need to have the Power Glove come back.

01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:44.300
Oh, the listeners are going to hate me for this, but you know how we always say time

01:44:44.300 --> 01:44:44.940
to penis.

01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:47.420
My concern with the Power Glove is time to fist.

01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:50.060
We know.

01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:54.140
It's so bad.

01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:55.500
It's ripped for her pleasure.

01:44:57.900 --> 01:45:01.900
Moving on to a comment from Burr brought these brain bleach.

01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:04.220
Now make it stop.

01:45:04.220 --> 01:45:06.220
Burr says it was the you know what?

01:45:06.220 --> 01:45:10.460
It was the Kevin Butler ads along with the price cut that came with the release of the

01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:14.860
slim that actually did help sway my opinion on the PlayStation 3 and finally got me to

01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:15.500
pick one up.

01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:21.180
To me, it was the moment that Sony finally meant business and let the games do the talking.

01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:26.140
The original PlayStation 3 ads were way too obscure and stupid by contrast.

01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:29.020
It was like when you let hipsters do commercials.

01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:35.100
Veronica S. replied and said the very first Pokemon commercial that aired on TV caused

01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:36.940
me to buy Pokemon Blue version.

01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:38.140
I was 11 years old.

01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:43.340
You know, the Pokemon cartoon was a pretty great tie in and the Pokemon movie.

01:45:43.980 --> 01:45:44.620
Good times.

01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:46.460
Let's see.

01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:50.540
Acidic Vampire says, have you seen the Wii U launch commercial?

01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:51.100
Hell no.

01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:54.460
He gives a big thumbs.

01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:59.020
I actually I only saw it in a movie theater once, but I don't I like I'm becoming dark

01:45:59.020 --> 01:46:03.660
soccer over here, but I don't watch TV like I really don't like very, very rarely, very

01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:03.900
rarely.

01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:07.500
The only thing I've seen so far and it's because we're watching, I think, Law and Order SV

01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:10.220
is there's a commercial over and over for like suicide.

01:46:12.140 --> 01:46:12.700
Suicide.

01:46:12.700 --> 01:46:14.220
Have you has it occurred to you?

01:46:14.380 --> 01:46:18.700
It's like, I don't really know what it's for other than, hey, you know, I got to buy me

01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:19.820
some of that suicide.

01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:21.100
T.J.

01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:26.780
Janai says kiosks and store demos are the most helpful for my buying decisions.

01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:32.220
Steven M. replied and said the early Xbox promos for Kinect really got me excited to

01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:32.700
buy one.

01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:37.660
Dart Charger said in my youth, I was probably swayed by many video game commercials.

01:46:37.660 --> 01:46:42.780
I mean, who could forget the commercial like Journey for the Atari 2600?

01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:45.660
And he actually embedded the commercial here for us to.

01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:53.900
They presents the world's first rock video game Journey Escape.

01:46:53.900 --> 01:46:54.940
The concert's over.

01:46:54.940 --> 01:46:59.980
Now you must help each member of Journey Escape to mobs of love-crazed groupies, shifty-eyed

01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:00.460
promoters.

01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:09.340
Find your roadies and manager and run into the escape vehicle and live to rock another

01:47:09.340 --> 01:47:09.580
day.

01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:15.180
Journey Escape for the Atari 2600 from Data Age.

01:47:15.980 --> 01:47:16.540
You know what?

01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:19.180
Fuck Journey from last year.

01:47:20.380 --> 01:47:21.740
This is the true journey.

01:47:23.340 --> 01:47:26.220
I regret printing Journey on my games of the year list.

01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:30.220
This just reminded me that that there will only be one video game named Journey.

01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:33.340
I'm teasing mostly.

01:47:33.340 --> 01:47:33.580
All right.

01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:39.340
Anyhow, Dart Charger went on and said today's marketing has matured with the modern gamer

01:47:39.340 --> 01:47:40.060
as well.

01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:44.860
These promotions aren't limited to simply TV commercials or magazine advertisements anymore.

01:47:44.860 --> 01:47:48.780
Companies recognize the various ways they can influence gamers simply through exposure

01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:52.780
across all mediums like game trailers, demos, and previews on gaming sites and magazines.

01:47:52.780 --> 01:47:55.020
You left out viral marketing.

01:47:55.020 --> 01:48:00.700
Every boardroom, you know, mid-management favorite thing to not understand.

01:48:00.700 --> 01:48:01.580
Viral marketing.

01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:05.180
We need you guys to create a viral video.

01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:06.540
That's not how it works.

01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:07.820
It has to multiply.

01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:08.460
Multiply.

01:48:08.460 --> 01:48:09.260
Spread.

01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:10.220
Share it like a disease.

01:48:10.220 --> 01:48:11.500
It must feature cats.

01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:13.900
Andy R. replied and said, not usually.

01:48:13.900 --> 01:48:18.860
I typically build up hype for the games I want on my own through reading articles and

01:48:18.860 --> 01:48:19.420
such.

01:48:19.420 --> 01:48:22.860
If anything, big expensive ad campaigns turn me off to a game.

01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:26.860
When every single gaming site was running ads for Mass Effect 3, I got sick of seeing

01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:27.340
it.

01:48:27.340 --> 01:48:29.500
Probably part of the reason I still don't like the game.

01:48:30.460 --> 01:48:33.980
And I was interested in buying Dishonored, but after seeing the trailer a million times

01:48:33.980 --> 01:48:38.700
before the game launched, thanks to The Escapist and PA TV, I decided to pass on the game.

01:48:39.340 --> 01:48:40.060
Just do what I do.

01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:40.860
Stop watching TV.

01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:43.100
Well, these are web shows, though.

01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:44.860
Stop watching TV web shows.

01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:45.660
Use Adblock.

01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:52.300
I will admit, though, a lot of online sites can only seem to ever find one sponsor.

01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:55.500
Dan and I always pick the commercials for Hulu that talk about, like, food.

01:48:57.580 --> 01:49:00.620
I like this approach that I hope I pronounce this correctly.

01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:04.700
Shaya C said, define advertising.

01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:08.540
Were things like the Super Mario Brothers Super Show or the Sonic cartoon ads for a

01:49:08.540 --> 01:49:09.580
specific game?

01:49:09.580 --> 01:49:10.300
Not really.

01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:14.380
Were they media which kept the franchise visible, popular, and made us kids excited for the

01:49:14.380 --> 01:49:15.420
next game installment?

01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:16.380
You bet.

01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:20.940
Before the internet, gasp, TV ads, friends, and kiosks were the only way you'd actually

01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:23.100
see gameplay before getting it yourself.

01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:25.580
Magazines had reviews, but you'd only get stills.

01:49:25.580 --> 01:49:27.900
Now we've got trailers on demand and tons of review sites.

01:49:27.900 --> 01:49:31.900
I feel like consumers are pulling information more than is being pushed to them.

01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:36.140
The only thing they really need to nail with traditional advertising these days is making

01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:37.740
sure people know the title.

01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:38.620
Interesting perspective.

01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:41.180
We were going down that line a little bit and talking about the wizard and stuff.

01:49:41.980 --> 01:49:47.340
Degenerate Johnny said, the only time I actually bought a console based on its advertisement

01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:49.260
alone was Tiger's Gamecom.

01:49:49.260 --> 01:49:51.980
The commercial made the mobile gaming device as the shit.

01:49:52.700 --> 01:49:57.100
Yes, the little person's insulting remarks came off as insulting to the gaming community,

01:49:57.100 --> 01:49:59.020
but I recognized its satire.

01:49:59.020 --> 01:50:01.980
Not to mention it was pretty funny seeing the little guy get tossed around at the end

01:50:01.980 --> 01:50:02.700
of the ad.

01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:04.860
And so I'm fortunate to see that the device failed.

01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:06.140
Oh yeah, that thing failed.

01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:09.580
Since it had many features that were quite innovative for the late 90s, such as touchscreen

01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:14.140
controls and internet access, it goes to show that one must be mindful of its market if

01:50:14.140 --> 01:50:15.820
it hopes to make the product a success.

01:50:16.460 --> 01:50:21.660
And lastly, SHA100Matt says, back when I subscribed to Nintendo Power as a kid, I was sent, like

01:50:21.660 --> 01:50:25.820
many other subscribers, a VHS tape of the Nintendo 64.

01:50:25.820 --> 01:50:29.980
Since there were no gaming blogs and gaming sites I was able to access back then, all

01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:34.220
I had to go on was brief articles on Nintendo Power and other gaming magazines.

01:50:34.220 --> 01:50:39.180
But when I got the Nintendo 64 Power Preview video from Nintendo Power, I was sold on the

01:50:39.180 --> 01:50:40.620
Nintendo 64.

01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:44.140
It was the first time I ever got a real look at the graphics and games in action, so I

01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:45.900
was immediately blown away.

01:50:45.900 --> 01:50:48.540
After that point, I saved up my money and got the system at launch.

01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:53.260
I never realized that they'd sent out videos like that.

01:50:53.260 --> 01:50:53.980
That's kind of neat.

01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:59.020
I wonder if they were those really cheap, like, cardboard tape things that could really

01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:00.780
fuck up your VCR if you used it wrong.

01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:02.300
I don't know.

01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:06.220
All right, anyhow, we have not yet gone to Google Plus, so let me quickly get through

01:51:06.220 --> 01:51:07.260
Google Plus's answers.

01:51:07.820 --> 01:51:11.100
ActDef said, I would say that back in the 80s and 90s it worked.

01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:15.260
We got smothered with over-the-top, in-your-face advertisement back then, and it probably

01:51:15.260 --> 01:51:18.380
got us to buy or ask our parents to get us a video games.

01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:22.460
But now, a lot of commercials for games are really bland and don't capture your attention

01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:22.860
that much.

01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:28.460
CriticalMyth said, I can't say there was a commercial that did that for me, but print

01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:30.860
ads have convinced me more than a couple times.

01:51:30.860 --> 01:51:33.660
One I remember well was Xenosaga 2.

01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:35.340
Cosmos had me at, hello.

01:51:37.740 --> 01:51:41.740
Myko says, as much as I want to say no, it's the quality of the games that does it for

01:51:41.740 --> 01:51:46.140
me, like it did for the Dreamcast, I have to say yes if the OUYA counts because I'm

01:51:46.140 --> 01:51:46.780
an idiot.

01:51:46.780 --> 01:51:48.620
Okay, so I guess there are OUYA commercials.

01:51:48.620 --> 01:51:49.820
What am I missing?

01:51:49.820 --> 01:51:50.220
Are there?

01:51:50.220 --> 01:51:52.540
Because that's the second person to say there are OUYA commercials.

01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:54.220
And I have just not seen one.

01:51:54.780 --> 01:51:56.540
All right, let's take a look here.

01:51:56.540 --> 01:51:57.820
Rob's on the hunt.

01:51:57.820 --> 01:52:02.700
Shane is adding that those videos were real VHS tapes and they were fantastic.

01:52:06.860 --> 01:52:09.900
I'll be damned, there is an, oh no, that says fan-made.

01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:15.420
But there is this seven, I wonder if it's the Kickstarter ad these guys are referring

01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:15.420


01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:16.380
It's probably the Kickstarter video that they had.

01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:17.340
I bet that's what it is.

01:52:17.340 --> 01:52:19.580
It's like the modern type of ad.

01:52:19.580 --> 01:52:20.080
Interesting.

01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:29.500
Let's see, E3VL says, advertising campaigns worked on me and my youth due to the limited

01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:32.220
social media exposure, magazines, TV, and radio.

01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:36.140
Now with the internet involved, ads are everywhere and it's second nature to ignore them or it

01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:39.900
becomes background noise with the instant impulse, hit the X or skip button when it's

01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:40.700
available.

01:52:40.700 --> 01:52:43.820
Also, now that I purchase things with my own money instead of my parents, I tend to do

01:52:43.820 --> 01:52:47.820
research before purchasing and ads are just a way to get me curious about coming trends

01:52:47.820 --> 01:52:52.860
instead of impulse buys or begging for the blast processing for Christmas slash birthday.

01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:59.500
And lastly, Techie Q says, no, today's ads campaigns to sway me has less effect on me

01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:03.660
now thanks to internet, but it did sway me more during the Super Nintendo era of gaming.

01:53:03.660 --> 01:53:08.140
Those early Super Mario World and Legend of Zelda, a link to the past commercials swayed

01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:10.620
me hard to get a Super Nintendo.

01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:12.460
Good answers tonight and good reminiscing.

01:53:12.460 --> 01:53:19.100
All I know is the commercials for Grand Theft Auto San Andreas just pissed me off because

01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:22.220
I wanted to play Grand Theft Auto San Andreas more.

01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:26.220
You know, it was like before it came out, I'm like, what now?

01:53:26.220 --> 01:53:29.260
Oh, you know, that kind of stuff.

01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:32.060
Or Grand Theft Auto 4, both of those.

01:53:32.060 --> 01:53:36.060
All right, let's move on with some more gaming news for the week.

01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:38.540
Thank you to everybody on Facebook and Google for answering the question.

01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:39.540
Loki.

01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:43.780
All right, so we've been talking about it, and I'm sure you guys have no idea what Disney

01:53:43.780 --> 01:53:48.420
Infinity is, even though we've been talking about it for months now, probably months longer

01:53:48.420 --> 01:53:54.900
than everybody else, but Disney Infinity finally got announced this week, and basically it's

01:53:54.900 --> 01:54:02.740
this cool combination of like toys and a little base that you put them on and games, and then

01:54:02.740 --> 01:54:04.340
they have this toy box mode.

01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:10.420
So basically, what kind of makes it different than Skylanders is it's not just one single,

01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:14.100
I mean, it is, they have the toy box mode where you can kind of take all these toys

01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:19.300
and build your own world out of it, which is kind of cool, but it's not some single

01:54:19.300 --> 01:54:24.100
game that you have to buy characters for to unlock all the parts of the game.

01:54:24.100 --> 01:54:25.620
That's really the main thing.

01:54:25.620 --> 01:54:31.580
Bobby was being funny on Twitter and saying, so is this something that I can like now?

01:54:31.620 --> 01:54:34.940
You know, are you giving me permission to like this because you gave everybody crap

01:54:34.940 --> 01:54:36.500
about Skylanders?

01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:40.420
And yeah, I say it's a little bit different because each individual character and playset

01:54:40.420 --> 01:54:42.380
or whatever is its own thing.

01:54:42.380 --> 01:54:48.980
It's not necessarily like, oh, I have to buy Captain Jack Sparrow to get to this one part

01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:51.740
of the Monsters Inc. world or something like that.

01:54:51.740 --> 01:54:52.740
It's not like that at all.

01:54:52.740 --> 01:54:56.860
Each thing is its own game, and then what kind of ties them all together is the toy

01:54:56.860 --> 01:55:02.020
box mode where you can build wherever the fuck you want, and they've got racing stuff

01:55:02.020 --> 01:55:03.020
in there.

01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:05.460
It sounds like they're kind of combining a little bit of the Little Big Planet stuff.

01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:09.780
You can set your camera at certain spots, so you can do like a 2D platformer, or you

01:55:09.780 --> 01:55:14.740
can make a racing game, or you could just do whatever, and you could share these all

01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:18.740
around the world, and it sounds like that they're going to have, I think DLC you could

01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:19.740
buy for it.

01:55:19.740 --> 01:55:20.740
They're going to have actual toys.

01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:23.740
The toys are like 12 bucks each for each individual character.

01:55:24.180 --> 01:55:25.180
You can get playsets.

01:55:25.180 --> 01:55:29.780
They're like 35 bucks, which are going to include a few characters and like a world

01:55:29.780 --> 01:55:35.420
as well as some different power-ups and stuff, and talk about total fan service on a lot

01:55:35.420 --> 01:55:36.420
of stuff.

01:55:36.420 --> 01:55:38.180
The game itself actually comes with three worlds.

01:55:38.180 --> 01:55:42.700
It's Monsters University, The Incredibles, and Pirates of the Caribbean, and they've

01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:49.420
got Captain Jack Sparrow, Mr. Incredible, and Sully from Monsters U and Monsters Inc.

01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:54.060
in that first playset, or the first thing they're packing in there for 75 bucks.

01:55:54.060 --> 01:55:55.060
What a surprise.

01:55:55.060 --> 01:55:56.060
I had no idea.

01:55:56.060 --> 01:56:03.540
Yes, and then let's see what else, but yeah, they've got Tron, at least some hints of Tron

01:56:03.540 --> 01:56:06.580
in there, and they've got other characters.

01:56:06.580 --> 01:56:12.100
I think I posted a few things on there, like different screen grabs and stuff, and they've

01:56:12.100 --> 01:56:15.260
got like Phineas and Ferb is going to be something else that they have on there.

01:56:15.260 --> 01:56:16.620
Love Phineas and Ferb.

01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:18.660
And they've got, of course, the rest of them.

01:56:18.900 --> 01:56:19.900
Jack Skellington.

01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:20.900
Yeah, Jack Skellington was in there.

01:56:20.900 --> 01:56:21.900
Sign me up for that.

01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:25.740
Toy Story, obviously, because that was kind of the Toy Box moment, Toy Story 3 is what

01:56:25.740 --> 01:56:28.340
kind of inspired them to do all this stuff.

01:56:28.340 --> 01:56:33.200
And Cars is going to be something else, and Wreck-It Ralph is in there, and they even

01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:39.580
have some hints of like Sugar Rush, which should be pretty cool, and all this stuff

01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:40.580
is supposed to be coming out.

01:56:40.580 --> 01:56:43.980
Also, other things they didn't have, Frozen's going to have some characters with that when

01:56:43.980 --> 01:56:45.820
that movie comes out this fall.

01:56:45.820 --> 01:56:47.820
Here's a couple problems, though.

01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:53.140
I mean, there's the Disney nerd in me wants to go all in on this shit, right?

01:56:53.140 --> 01:56:59.100
I mean, you know, I collect the pins, which is an expensive hobby, you know, so why not

01:56:59.100 --> 01:57:00.100
go to the figurines?

01:57:00.100 --> 01:57:01.100
Right?

01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:02.580
I mean, but here's my concern.

01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:05.480
I'm really worried about the quality of the game.

01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:09.620
And I'm going to be honest, whether this is a rational reason or not, I'm just being I'm

01:57:09.620 --> 01:57:10.760
keeping it real.

01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:12.760
I'm worried about who's developing it.

01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:15.900
They don't have an established product under their belt.

01:57:15.900 --> 01:57:16.900
Avalanche.

01:57:16.900 --> 01:57:21.980
Like, a lot of the stuff they put out have been kiddie games.

01:57:21.980 --> 01:57:25.060
Toy Story 3, obviously, was them, too.

01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:30.160
And if you look at what they did before Disney picked them up, they did a lot of bad games,

01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:32.060
like Sub-Zero Mythologies and all that.

01:57:32.060 --> 01:57:35.980
Now, granted, we all make mistakes, and we should give them a chance that maybe this

01:57:35.980 --> 01:57:39.140
is something that will break through, but I'm concerned.

01:57:39.140 --> 01:57:47.100
And the gameplay footage didn't really make me go, uhh, you know?

01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:48.100
I didn't lose my shit.

01:57:48.100 --> 01:57:50.300
Well, did you watch any of the interview videos?

01:57:50.300 --> 01:57:52.140
They actually had more in-depth play gameplay stuff.

01:57:52.140 --> 01:57:53.140
To be fair, no.

01:57:53.140 --> 01:57:56.060
I only watched the common trailer that was out there.

01:57:56.060 --> 01:57:57.060
It looked OK.

01:57:57.060 --> 01:58:01.580
I mean, it's not like, you know, none of this is really making me go, oh, I got it picked

01:58:01.580 --> 01:58:02.580
up.

01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:06.460
I mean, the Toy Box mode sounds really cool, but once again, I was kind of even thinking

01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:11.940
about it, and I'm like, is this going to be really much different than Skylanders is

01:58:11.940 --> 01:58:16.340
as far as, like, you're going to have to buy all this shit to, you know, what am I going

01:58:16.340 --> 01:58:17.340
to have to buy?

01:58:17.340 --> 01:58:21.380
Am I going to have to buy, like, this Disney landscape, you know, thing or something to

01:58:21.380 --> 01:58:23.740
have, like, you know, the Epcot Center or whatever?

01:58:23.740 --> 01:58:24.740
And they have that.

01:58:24.740 --> 01:58:27.940
The Epcot Center, you can actually put it in your world and stuff.

01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:30.540
It'd be like Warhammer Disney-K.

01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:31.540
I mean, it's just so cool.

01:58:31.540 --> 01:58:36.060
I'd have to see what stuff comes out and, you know, how it gets priced and, you know,

01:58:36.060 --> 01:58:37.700
I think it's going to sell really well.

01:58:37.700 --> 01:58:41.420
And the fact that they have this whole kind of synergy where you can build your own world

01:58:41.420 --> 01:58:42.420
is kind of unique.

01:58:42.420 --> 01:58:43.420
I don't know.

01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:46.240
That's really going to set them apart from, like, Skylanders, because Skylanders is like,

01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:49.220
you buy a bunch of characters, you play one game, you know, it's a dungeon crawler and

01:58:49.220 --> 01:58:50.220
that's it.

01:58:50.220 --> 01:58:53.140
Whereas this, they could have multiple game types.

01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:56.580
They could have, you know, this is going to be a racing game, this is going to be an adventure

01:58:56.580 --> 01:58:57.580
game.

01:58:57.580 --> 01:59:00.980
Something to remember about those little RFIDs, too, is that they don't just, you know, they're

01:59:00.980 --> 01:59:02.860
not just chips that transmit data.

01:59:02.860 --> 01:59:03.860
They can save data.

01:59:03.860 --> 01:59:04.860
Yes.

01:59:04.860 --> 01:59:05.860
Just a limited amount, right?

01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:06.860
Just a little bit.

01:59:06.860 --> 01:59:10.100
But maybe enough so that, like, you could bring with you a level design.

01:59:10.100 --> 01:59:11.100
Yes.

01:59:11.100 --> 01:59:12.100
Maybe.

01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:15.740
Or at least you can share those on the internet, apparently, like with other people and play

01:59:15.740 --> 01:59:17.860
their creations or invite your friends over.

01:59:17.860 --> 01:59:24.780
You can do four-player co-op over the internet.

01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:25.780
I don't know.

01:59:25.780 --> 01:59:28.240
I guess I'll wait till a little closer, look at some of the reviews.

01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:33.160
You know, there's that part of me that's like, must have all figurines, must have them all.

01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:34.860
But the figurines look cool.

01:59:34.860 --> 01:59:35.980
I saw pictures of them.

01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:38.860
I mean, they're well done.

01:59:38.860 --> 01:59:44.220
And here's the thing, too, that I'm not too positive on, but it looks like they articulate.

01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:47.580
It looks like the arms, at least they've got seams on the arms where it looks like they

01:59:47.580 --> 01:59:52.820
could move, limited at least, but that's more than Skylanders can.

01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:54.900
So you know, that'd be interesting.

01:59:54.900 --> 01:59:57.260
Is that why they're going to be more expensive than the figure?

01:59:57.260 --> 01:59:58.500
Is that just Disney tax?

01:59:58.500 --> 02:00:00.140
They're not that much more expensive than Skylanders.

02:00:00.140 --> 02:00:01.140
But they are more expensive.

02:00:01.140 --> 02:00:02.140
Yes, they are more expensive.

02:00:02.140 --> 02:00:03.140
Is that Disney tax?

02:00:03.140 --> 02:00:04.140
Probably Disney tax.

02:00:05.140 --> 02:00:06.140
Just curious.

02:00:07.140 --> 02:00:08.140
All right.

02:00:08.140 --> 02:00:11.140
Well, that is definitely the future of gaming, like it or not.

02:00:11.140 --> 02:00:12.140
I don't know.

02:00:12.140 --> 02:00:19.140
It concerns me, though, is that if we support Disney infinity, that like we're saying we

02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:20.140
want more of this.

02:00:20.140 --> 02:00:24.140
And I really worry about the barrage of knockoffs that this whole Skylander thing is going to

02:00:24.140 --> 02:00:25.140
cause.

02:00:25.140 --> 02:00:26.140
Pokemon.

02:00:26.140 --> 02:00:28.140
Well, yeah, I was talking to Shane about that.

02:00:28.140 --> 02:00:32.140
I was like, can you imagine if Nintendo just said we want to do Pokemon like this?

02:00:32.140 --> 02:00:34.140
I would have them all my God.

02:00:34.140 --> 02:00:36.140
But he brought up a good point with me.

02:00:36.140 --> 02:00:37.140
Maybe I'll call in the show later.

02:00:37.140 --> 02:00:38.140
Talk about it.

02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:41.140
He said that the creator of Pokemon actually hates DLC.

02:00:41.140 --> 02:00:43.140
So they may not be.

02:00:43.140 --> 02:00:47.140
But he may hate DLC, but they're going to have DLC in the next Pokemon game.

02:00:47.140 --> 02:00:50.140
He may hate it all he wants, but he's not calling a shot.

02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:52.140
They used to do those Burger King toys back.

02:00:52.140 --> 02:00:55.140
That's why I told him I said they used to have a little toy.

02:00:55.140 --> 02:01:00.140
Can you imagine that they will literally have like Pokeballs that you put your fucking figurine

02:01:00.140 --> 02:01:02.140
in that you put it out on?

02:01:02.140 --> 02:01:04.140
It's like that was that was Burger King.

02:01:04.140 --> 02:01:05.140
You know what?

02:01:05.140 --> 02:01:09.140
Twelve years ago, I have to tell you, after they banned all those Pokeballs, we went to

02:01:09.140 --> 02:01:14.140
a Burger King and went through the drive through 10 times to get more Pokeballs so that we

02:01:14.140 --> 02:01:16.140
could hang them up on the tree yourself with them.

02:01:16.140 --> 02:01:18.140
No, just so that we could have a pile of Pokeballs.

02:01:18.140 --> 02:01:22.140
We we actually had a box full of Pokeballs and Pokemon toys because we wanted all of

02:01:22.140 --> 02:01:23.140
them.

02:01:23.140 --> 02:01:26.140
And then finally we're like, wait, this is stupid and gave them away.

02:01:26.140 --> 02:01:29.140
I actually I went as Ash Ketchum one Halloween.

02:01:29.140 --> 02:01:32.140
And thank you to Burger King for those Pokeballs because they were great for my costume.

02:01:32.140 --> 02:01:35.140
And you know, and honestly, you know, maybe the other thing they got me psyched about,

02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:39.140
you know, the whole Disney infinity thing is the fact that they had Nero's Me and You

02:01:39.140 --> 02:01:41.140
in the trailer, which is pretty awesome.

02:01:41.140 --> 02:01:43.140
Yes.

02:01:43.140 --> 02:01:44.140
That's awesome.

02:01:44.140 --> 02:01:46.140
That song is awesome.

02:01:46.140 --> 02:01:48.140
So at least somebody has good taste in music over there.

02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:49.140
I think they do.

02:01:49.140 --> 02:01:51.140
And I really like Step Step.

02:01:51.140 --> 02:01:52.140
All right.

02:01:52.140 --> 02:01:56.140
Well, a little story that was circulating the game blogs this week was about pinballs

02:01:56.140 --> 02:01:57.140
arcade.

02:01:57.140 --> 02:01:58.140
That's with a Z.

02:01:58.140 --> 02:02:01.140
It is a arcade located in Austin, Texas.

02:02:01.140 --> 02:02:03.140
The cool place in Texas.

02:02:03.140 --> 02:02:06.140
Pinball's arcade is kind of it's like a retro gaming place.

02:02:06.140 --> 02:02:12.140
It's got arcade machines like Galaga, Street Fighter two, Jurassic Park, Lost World and

02:02:12.140 --> 02:02:16.140
Darren's spawn, who is the owner of this with his wife, Mickey.

02:02:16.140 --> 02:02:19.140
What they're trying to do with this, they want to recreate the experience of arcade

02:02:19.140 --> 02:02:23.140
gaming, saying, quote, people have lost their that social experience.

02:02:23.140 --> 02:02:24.140
They sit on couches with their Xbox.

02:02:24.140 --> 02:02:26.140
They never talk to their kids.

02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:29.140
You want to come to a place where you can play together with your kids, too, and find

02:02:29.140 --> 02:02:32.140
something that the whole family enjoys.

02:02:32.140 --> 02:02:36.140
Now, it should be noted, you know, this place has been around since November 2010.

02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:39.140
It is just making the rounds on the game blog this week because of an article that

02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:43.140
was discovered on statesman dot com, which I'm assuming is kind of like an Austin,

02:02:43.140 --> 02:02:46.140
you know, so so people were able to find it on the Internet and kind of figure out

02:02:46.140 --> 02:02:47.140
more about this place.

02:02:47.140 --> 02:02:53.140
But yay to this guy trying to end his wife bringing back the retro arcade stuff.

02:02:53.140 --> 02:02:55.140
I think that's great.

02:02:55.140 --> 02:02:59.140
Even the article, the original article talks about some games like Missile Command,

02:02:59.140 --> 02:03:02.140
they don't make much money, but he keeps them because they're classics.

02:03:02.140 --> 02:03:05.140
And the other thing about the arcade, I was looking at the actual Web site.

02:03:05.140 --> 02:03:07.140
Everything in that arcade is for sale.

02:03:07.140 --> 02:03:11.140
So let's say you go in and you're playing Galaga and you're like, I want to buy this

02:03:11.140 --> 02:03:12.140
machine. You can buy it.

02:03:12.140 --> 02:03:17.140
So it's almost like a interactive show floor where you could buy the games.

02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:19.140
It's kind of awesome.

02:03:19.140 --> 02:03:22.140
Oh, no, I'll take all of them.

02:03:22.140 --> 02:03:26.140
There did seem to be a healthy amount of ticket ticket spitting games to like more

02:03:26.140 --> 02:03:29.140
like the hand-me-down kind of ticket spitting games, like things that were in

02:03:29.140 --> 02:03:30.140
arcades a few years ago.

02:03:30.140 --> 02:03:32.140
But, you know, we're on a skeeball.

02:03:32.140 --> 02:03:36.140
Let's keep on keep on pressing the button to stop the light types of games.

02:03:36.140 --> 02:03:38.140
You know, what was that?

02:03:38.140 --> 02:03:43.140
They throw a birthday smoke and token and spider stomp.

02:03:43.140 --> 02:03:47.140
Apparently, a second and third location elsewhere in Austin could be coming this

02:03:47.140 --> 02:03:51.140
year. And, you know, remember, guys, he opened this place in November 2010.

02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:54.140
I mean, the economy has been kind of in the shitter in the past couple of years,

02:03:54.140 --> 02:03:57.140
yet this place didn't go out of business.

02:03:57.140 --> 02:03:58.140
That's awesome.

02:03:58.140 --> 02:04:02.140
And clearly it's because of the Star Trek backdrop he has there in the arcade.

02:04:02.140 --> 02:04:05.140
That's what keeps that place awesome.

02:04:05.140 --> 02:04:07.140
Anyhow, there's a no fear.

02:04:07.140 --> 02:04:09.140
You know what? You know, who else has no fear?

02:04:09.140 --> 02:04:11.140
Dan, right? Or had he had one?

02:04:11.140 --> 02:04:13.140
Yeah, that was the last table we sold.

02:04:13.140 --> 02:04:16.140
They need to have.

02:04:16.140 --> 02:04:20.140
They need to have like a giant Picard picture on the wall with him, like saying,

02:04:20.140 --> 02:04:22.140
make it so or something, somewhere in there.

02:04:22.140 --> 02:04:25.140
I mean, that'd be pretty awesome.

02:04:25.140 --> 02:04:28.140
All right, let's move on with more news.

02:04:28.140 --> 02:04:30.140
Oh, yeah, it's my turn, isn't it?

02:04:30.140 --> 02:04:32.140
Silly iPad.

02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:38.140
Well, there is a game coming out by an indie studio called Stab Yourself.

02:04:38.140 --> 02:04:40.140
That's the best name ever.

02:04:40.140 --> 02:04:42.140
It's stabyourself.net.

02:04:42.140 --> 02:04:47.140
They basically recreate 80s games and then apply modern physics to them.

02:04:47.140 --> 02:04:51.140
They've done a game called Not Tetris, where basically it's like Game Boy Tetris,

02:04:51.140 --> 02:04:54.140
except the bricks actually fall with the same momentum a brick really would.

02:04:54.140 --> 02:05:00.140
Then there's Mario, which is M-A-R-I-0, where basically you go through the Mushroom Kingdom with a portal gun.

02:05:00.140 --> 02:05:03.140
And now they have Not Pac-Man.

02:05:03.140 --> 02:05:12.140
Not Pac-Man is, well, Pac-Man is on the screen, but instead of moving him around and the ghost moving around,

02:05:13.140 --> 02:05:18.140
you actually tilt the screen, and you can use a keyboard, a mouse, a game pad, or a steering wheel.

02:05:18.140 --> 02:05:20.140
Yes, you can use a steering wheel.

02:05:20.140 --> 02:05:23.140
And the ghosts don't move by themselves either.

02:05:23.140 --> 02:05:25.140
They might fall into you as you're turning.

02:05:25.140 --> 02:05:30.140
So it applies a new aspect of physics to the game, and I need this in my life.

02:05:30.140 --> 02:05:33.140
That is actually badass, I've got to say.

02:05:33.140 --> 02:05:35.140
That is a really smart innovation.

02:05:35.140 --> 02:05:41.140
Obviously, it's Stab Yourself with Love and Good Ideas is what they talk about in the name, right?

02:05:41.140 --> 02:05:42.140
Stab Yourself with innovation.

02:05:42.140 --> 02:05:43.140
Yes, exactly.

02:05:43.140 --> 02:05:45.140
That's stabyourself.net.

02:05:45.140 --> 02:05:48.140
Go get it. I want it. I'm gonna get it.

02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:50.140
I love that you can control it with a steering wheel.

02:05:50.140 --> 02:05:54.140
I totally do. Well, you know, we've got Dan's steering wheel rig.

02:05:54.140 --> 02:05:57.140
We could totally do that. Oh, did, oh, no, no, no.

02:05:57.140 --> 02:06:00.140
Okay, I have to add something. Rewind back into the gaming week.

02:06:00.140 --> 02:06:02.140
Do you know what my husband is doing tonight?

02:06:02.140 --> 02:06:09.140
He is building himself a three-monitor rig, just for playing Gran Turismo and OutRun.

02:06:10.140 --> 02:06:11.140
My husband.

02:06:11.140 --> 02:06:13.140
I didn't realize OutRun used three monitors.

02:06:13.140 --> 02:06:14.140
Yeah.

02:06:14.140 --> 02:06:16.140
Like the old OutRun or the new OutRun?

02:06:16.140 --> 02:06:17.140
The newer ones.

02:06:17.140 --> 02:06:24.140
He's basically building the rig so he can hook up his PC to do full three-screen gaming.

02:06:24.140 --> 02:06:29.140
Now, if you're gonna do something like that with an Xbox or a PS3, you actually have to have other systems.

02:06:29.140 --> 02:06:31.140
Like multiple systems to get him to run.

02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:33.140
Yeah, I know Gran Turismo, you need like three systems, three monitors.

02:06:33.140 --> 02:06:38.140
Yeah, but he's doing something so that he can play all of the PC-based games.

02:06:38.140 --> 02:06:39.140
Cool.

02:06:39.140 --> 02:06:42.140
With three monitors. My husband's a dork.

02:06:42.140 --> 02:06:44.140
That's why you love him, though.

02:06:44.140 --> 02:06:47.140
I guess. He better get me that BeatMania now.

02:06:47.140 --> 02:06:49.140
More news.

02:06:49.140 --> 02:06:53.140
All right, so, layoffs. More layoffs.

02:06:53.140 --> 02:07:00.140
So, starting off, Gas Powered Games had some layoffs, and this is right after they just launched a Kickstarter for a game called Wildman.

02:07:01.140 --> 02:07:07.140
Apparently, the whole thing was that Wildman's Kickstarter needed to actually...

02:07:07.140 --> 02:07:19.140
It needs to earn that money because otherwise, they would have had to lay everyone off anyways without any of their paid time off and stuff cashed out and any of the benefits or severances and stuff.

02:07:21.140 --> 02:07:23.140
And right now, I think...

02:07:23.140 --> 02:07:26.140
I'm actually gonna check to see how their Kickstarter's doing.

02:07:26.140 --> 02:07:41.140
Not looking good. They need to hit $1.1 million, and they're at $263,000, and they have 25 days to go. It's gonna be tough.

02:07:41.140 --> 02:07:50.140
But basically, yeah. So, what he's saying is if they do hit their Kickstarter, they'll try to hire the people back that haven't found jobs yet and that kind of stuff.

02:07:50.140 --> 02:08:00.140
Unfortunately, it's just bad timing, I guess. They just had to lay them off now so that they have money to actually do that.

02:08:00.140 --> 02:08:10.140
They're still operating, but it's way slimmed down. In fact, pretty much everybody's gone except for the head of the studio and I think a couple people.

02:08:10.140 --> 02:08:13.140
So, that's kinda gonna suck.

02:08:14.140 --> 02:08:21.140
The other thing, too, is Codemasters has laid off 80 people as well, and they're restructuring.

02:08:21.140 --> 02:08:26.140
Sorry, there's three companies tonight that are having major, major problems.

02:08:26.140 --> 02:08:37.140
Yeah. Codemasters, really, they don't have... I mean, they have had some okay games come out, but a lot of their stuff recently hasn't done terribly well.

02:08:37.140 --> 02:08:48.140
I'm trying to think. Dirt 3 was the last game I remember them having put out. I know they have Grid 2 coming, and also their Formula 1 title didn't do terribly well.

02:08:48.140 --> 02:08:54.140
And I don't think their Formula 1 kart racing game did terribly well either. So, that kinda sucks.

02:08:54.140 --> 02:09:01.140
Maybe they can make something other than racing games. I think they tried that and that wasn't terribly well either.

02:09:01.140 --> 02:09:05.140
I was gonna say, but what's worked for them is that Dirt was one of their biggest games.

02:09:05.140 --> 02:09:16.140
Grid looked pretty cool. Grid 2, so I'm looking forward to see what that looks like. I'd love to see a next-gen Dirt game on the new consoles when they come out. That'd be pretty awesome.

02:09:16.140 --> 02:09:23.140
I'd also like to see a next-gen Ridge Racer that doesn't fucking suck, Namco. You have more time. Come on.

02:09:23.140 --> 02:09:33.140
Not a fucking rehash of, what, fuck, 7 or 6? How many times? What game did they actually have new tracks in? Was that 4? 4 had new tracks in it?

02:09:33.140 --> 02:09:37.140
I mean, seriously. New Ridge Racer would be awesome.

02:09:37.140 --> 02:09:44.140
Alright, well, moving on to another story here. You know, where there is an internet, there will always be trolls.

02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:50.140
And the folks at Blizzard, yes, Blizzard figured that out this week with Diablo 3 changes.

02:09:50.140 --> 02:10:00.140
Jay Wilson, who was, I believe he was like the head designer on Diablo 3, he is stepping away to do other duties within Blizzard.

02:10:00.140 --> 02:10:07.140
He's not leaving Blizzard, but he's worked on Diablo 3 for 7 years, and he will no longer be working on Diablo 3.

02:10:07.140 --> 02:10:14.140
Well, instantly, in the departure thread, people were bashing Jay Wilson for the quality of Diablo 3.

02:10:14.140 --> 02:10:21.140
You know, for many people, Diablo 3 has not lived up to expectations. The Always Online thing has rubbed people the wrong way.

02:10:21.140 --> 02:10:28.140
The Real Money Auction House has rubbed some people the wrong way. PVP was promised, it still hasn't happened yet, although I guess dueling is coming in the next patch.

02:10:28.140 --> 02:10:33.140
That's rubbed some people the wrong way. So, people have taken out their aggressions on this guy.

02:10:33.140 --> 02:10:42.140
He announced his retirement on January 17th, and the thread has grown to over 170 pages.

02:10:42.140 --> 02:10:49.140
Rob Pardo, the Chief Creative Officer at Blizzard, came into the thread saying, quote,

02:10:49.140 --> 02:11:01.140
This thread saddens me greatly. I know that the Battle.net forums have earned a reputation for rough justice, but I do not believe justice is being served by how people are speaking about Jay's departure from Diablo 3.

02:11:01.140 --> 02:11:06.140
If you still feel the need to dish out blame, then I would prefer you direct it at me.

02:11:06.140 --> 02:11:13.140
I was the executive producer on the project, I hired Jay, and I gave him advice and direction through the development process.

02:11:13.140 --> 02:11:18.140
I was ultimately responsible for the game we released and take full responsibility for the quality of the result.

02:11:18.140 --> 02:11:27.140
Very interesting, kind of like, you know, protective parent kind of attitude going on there. That's Karen about your employees. That's interesting.

02:11:27.140 --> 02:11:29.140
They could hire me now.

02:11:30.140 --> 02:11:35.140
If you were the lead designer on Diablo 3, what would you do?

02:11:35.140 --> 02:11:37.140
Garris.

02:11:37.140 --> 02:11:40.140
Hey, I didn't say it. I didn't say it.

02:11:40.140 --> 02:11:44.140
I would license out to Bioware to make a Mass Effect MMO.

02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:52.140
Anyhow, now, he acknowledged also, this is what we're saying, the Diablo community deserves an even better game.

02:11:52.140 --> 02:11:59.140
We have a talented team in place and have no intention of stopping work on Diablo 3 until it is the best game in the franchise.

02:11:59.140 --> 02:12:07.140
So interesting, this game is coming up on, what, nine months out and they're still trying to get the game they really want.

02:12:07.140 --> 02:12:15.140
This is a weird place we're at in the industry. I mean, it's not that Diablo 3 is, like, bad, but it was extremely disappointing. Extremely disappointing.

02:12:15.140 --> 02:12:18.140
And Torchlight 2 is kind of better.

02:12:19.140 --> 02:12:24.140
Anyhow, let's open up the mailbag. Let's see what the listeners have to say, shall we?

02:12:26.140 --> 02:12:29.140
Mailbag orangelaunchrater.com is the place you can email us each week.

02:12:29.140 --> 02:12:35.140
And usually Dark Soccer will dive into the email bag head first, but not tonight.

02:12:35.140 --> 02:12:41.140
As you can tell by my sexy ass voice tonight, I really don't have much of a voice to do it.

02:12:41.140 --> 02:12:44.140
Impersonating your mother earlier probably didn't help that.

02:12:44.140 --> 02:12:46.140
No, it didn't. I'm suffering for that now.

02:12:46.140 --> 02:12:48.140
You know what, you need more coffee.

02:12:48.140 --> 02:12:51.140
You know what, that's a good idea and I know where you keep it, but I'm not doing it.

02:12:51.140 --> 02:12:56.140
Alright, let's get to some emails tonight. I want to start with this email.

02:12:56.140 --> 02:13:01.140
From Phlegus, emails us.

02:13:01.140 --> 02:13:07.140
Hello Orangelaunch Radio crew, I'm going to keep this brief as I am most likely going to come off as extremely odd and potentially creepy.

02:13:07.140 --> 02:13:09.140
But I assure you, I'm harmless.

02:13:09.140 --> 02:13:16.140
I've been searching for an online radio show for a long while now and after haphazardly stumbling across this podcast the other day, I have to ask,

02:13:16.140 --> 02:13:22.140
were you ever a Bimani-centric show who possibly covered 2DX8 style previews around late 2002?

02:13:22.140 --> 02:13:26.140
If not, I apologize for the rather odd question and keep up the excellent work.

02:13:26.140 --> 02:13:28.140
Love the show and it's wonderful cast.

02:13:32.140 --> 02:13:34.140
You recognize that from the keyboard mania?

02:13:34.140 --> 02:13:36.140
Yes, that would be us.

02:13:36.140 --> 02:13:38.140
That is the show, absolutely.

02:13:38.140 --> 02:13:45.140
You know, it's funny you should bring up 2DX8 style because you know what this email needs to just make it perfect.

02:13:45.140 --> 02:13:47.140
I mean, I really appreciate the reminiscing.

02:13:47.140 --> 02:13:48.140
More Haulik!

02:13:48.140 --> 02:13:50.140
No, no, no, not more Haulik.

02:13:50.140 --> 02:13:51.140
Dancer?

02:13:51.140 --> 02:13:53.140
Yes, more Dancer.

02:13:53.140 --> 02:13:57.140
This email definitely needs some more Dancer, so let's give him some Dancer.

02:13:57.140 --> 02:13:59.140
God damn it, now I can't find Dancer.

02:13:59.140 --> 02:14:11.140
You know, that was like one of the first Bimani game I actually bought brand new that wasn't a DDR.

02:14:13.140 --> 02:14:14.140
You remember?

02:14:15.140 --> 02:14:19.140
I remember how we would all sit around with like little figurines and stand behind people while they played that.

02:14:19.140 --> 02:14:21.140
That was the best, that was absolutely the best.

02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:24.140
And then try to Para Para with Last Message.

02:14:24.140 --> 02:14:26.140
Here's the thing I want to know about this email.

02:14:26.140 --> 02:14:32.140
So, I actually offline earlier in the week, I wrote back to Playgus, so I'm waiting to hear back.

02:14:32.140 --> 02:14:35.140
And I was like, yeah, it's us, basically, long story short.

02:14:35.140 --> 02:14:40.140
But my curiosity is, I've been searching for an online radio show for a long while now.

02:14:40.140 --> 02:14:47.140
And after haphazardly stumbling across this podcast, so it's like, we was looking for the old show.

02:14:47.140 --> 02:14:49.140
And found this mess instead.

02:14:49.140 --> 02:14:51.140
We still have our Bimani love.

02:14:52.140 --> 02:14:53.140
Of course we have our Bimani love.

02:14:54.140 --> 02:14:56.140
Akira Yamaoka is still God.

02:14:59.140 --> 02:15:02.140
Anyhow, let's move on with more emails.

02:15:02.140 --> 02:15:06.140
Although, although, although I do have to say I have a special, special place in my heart for Desero.

02:15:07.140 --> 02:15:08.140
Oh, why is that?

02:15:08.140 --> 02:15:11.140
Fucking Desero. I love Cobalt.

02:15:11.140 --> 02:15:14.140
Moving on to an email from Redertainment.

02:15:14.140 --> 02:15:20.140
Hello Podcrafters, I've been following the recent discussion about video games needing to be connected to the internet.

02:15:20.140 --> 02:15:21.140
So their users can play them.

02:15:21.140 --> 02:15:27.140
This includes EA's recent SimCity announcement, always on DRM and other issues imposed by game companies.

02:15:27.140 --> 02:15:32.140
In discussing this issue, some have brought up the prospect of the people playing the games not having access to the internet.

02:15:32.140 --> 02:15:35.140
Either because they are poor or because they are in the military.

02:15:35.140 --> 02:15:39.140
There is another aspect to the mandatory internet connection issue that's not being brought up.

02:15:39.140 --> 02:15:43.140
What if the person playing the game can't connect to the publisher's servers.

02:15:43.140 --> 02:15:45.140
Not because of any problem with the consumer or the publisher.

02:15:45.140 --> 02:15:49.140
But because of an ISP's complete and utter fucking incompetence.

02:15:49.140 --> 02:15:56.140
What if due to the ISP being run by morons who think of Foresight as something only the uncircumcised deal with.

02:15:59.140 --> 02:16:00.140
That was good.

02:16:00.140 --> 02:16:07.140
The consumer or the publisher cannot connect to one another because of a failure by one or more internet service providers.

02:16:07.140 --> 02:16:14.140
This is just one of the reasons why I think of publishers mandating consumers to be connected to the internet as a bad idea.

02:16:14.140 --> 02:16:20.140
Stay black. Retertainment. And yes, I did just come up with the Foresight line. Trainer.

02:16:20.140 --> 02:16:24.140
Is that because you always say Garrus? He says trainer? I don't know. Anyway.

02:16:24.140 --> 02:16:29.140
You notice I haven't said it once during the course of the show.

02:16:29.140 --> 02:16:33.140
I've said it like three times now. Shitty internet service providers being a reason.

02:16:33.140 --> 02:16:37.140
Well, I mean, you're preaching to the choir, Retertainment. This shit's a bad idea.

02:16:37.140 --> 02:16:41.140
And you're just throwing another ingredient in the pot on why this is a bad idea.

02:16:41.140 --> 02:16:46.140
I mean, we had in the past, this show would drop several times.

02:16:46.140 --> 02:16:49.140
Now, maybe that wasn't the ISP's fault necessarily.

02:16:49.140 --> 02:16:54.140
But, you know, if you have a bad router or something, you know, you're gonna pay for that with your game.

02:16:54.140 --> 02:16:56.140
It's just ridiculous.

02:16:58.140 --> 02:17:01.140
I agree with you, Retertainment. Yes. Yes, sir. Yes.

02:17:04.140 --> 02:17:06.140
Another email here from AZHP.

02:17:06.140 --> 02:17:09.140
Hey, OLR. This is a long one, by the way, but it's a good one.

02:17:09.140 --> 02:17:12.140
AZHP here. Sorry in advance for the long email. You're forgiven.

02:17:12.140 --> 02:17:16.140
But it's on two subjects that are really important to me, and I'm sure some of you as well.

02:17:16.140 --> 02:17:17.140
So I hope you read it.

02:17:17.140 --> 02:17:24.140
I remember you guys mentioning the awesome Games Done Quick charity marathon for the Prevent Cancer Foundation on the show last week.

02:17:24.140 --> 02:17:28.140
And I wanted to give a little more background on it in case anyone was interested in the marathon or the cause.

02:17:28.140 --> 02:17:33.140
Dozens of speedrunners from around the world, most of whom are record holders for various games,

02:17:34.140 --> 02:17:41.140
paid their way to Washington, D.C. in order to speedrun games in order to raise money to support cancer research.

02:17:41.140 --> 02:17:51.140
Their initial goal was $150,000, but due to the immense generosity of fellow gamers, they managed to raise over $420,000 over a seven-day marathon.

02:17:51.140 --> 02:17:58.140
This means that the Prevent Cancer Foundation will be able to fund five two-year research grants for cancer research.

02:17:58.140 --> 02:17:59.140
Well, job well done.

02:17:59.140 --> 02:18:04.140
I had no idea that they had collected all these travelers from around the world.

02:18:05.140 --> 02:18:08.140
I had no idea whatsoever that that was the case, so thank you for sharing.

02:18:08.140 --> 02:18:14.140
I honestly thought it was like a group of like a college club or something that all was getting together to do it.

02:18:14.140 --> 02:18:16.140
So I think that's really cool.

02:18:17.140 --> 02:18:18.140
So props to you guys.

02:18:19.140 --> 02:18:24.140
Like you guys said, with all the bad press games have gotten due to recent events,

02:18:24.140 --> 02:18:29.140
it's really amazing that these people donated their vacation time and money to support this amazing cause.

02:18:29.140 --> 02:18:33.140
Some of the more impressive runs were Final Fantasy IX done in nine hours,

02:18:33.140 --> 02:18:40.140
Super Mario 64 all 120 stars done in under two hours by the world record holder Siglemic,

02:18:40.140 --> 02:18:46.140
Zelda O'Green of Time done in 23 minutes using some game-breaking bugs, and more.

02:18:46.140 --> 02:18:52.140
All the games were done in one sitting and it was amazing to watch all week, sometimes during work,

02:18:52.140 --> 02:18:56.140
whoops, and see how amazingly good and consistent people were at these games.

02:18:56.140 --> 02:19:01.140
I wasn't going to donate much originally, but after seeing how passionate these people were about the cause and the games,

02:19:01.140 --> 02:19:06.140
I eventually donated $80 over the week, though some people donated hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

02:19:06.140 --> 02:19:12.140
The runners read every donation comment that came through that week, but the one that touched me in a way I wouldn't have expected.

02:19:12.140 --> 02:19:15.140
A donor during the O'Green of Time run said,

02:19:15.140 --> 02:19:20.140
My grandmother's cat died of cancer. She used to watch me play O'Green of Time when I was a kid,

02:19:20.140 --> 02:19:24.140
and I hope that she's watching you speedrun this game from kitty heaven right now.

02:19:24.140 --> 02:19:30.140
I know it's silly, but I teared up a little bit. No, that's, that's, that's really adorable.

02:19:30.140 --> 02:19:32.140
And it is sad.

02:19:32.140 --> 02:19:35.140
Sorry for the long email, guys. You're forgiven. Good cause.

02:19:35.140 --> 02:19:43.140
And in case anyone is interested in watching the marathon videos, you can find them in the features section of speeddemosarchive.com.

02:19:43.140 --> 02:19:48.140
Yours truly AZHP. Well, I hope it's an even bigger success for them next year.

02:19:48.140 --> 02:19:52.140
I didn't realize they were bringing all these people in. They could do an expo out of this shit. That's...

02:19:52.140 --> 02:19:54.140
A speedrun expo would be pretty awesome.

02:19:54.140 --> 02:19:59.140
Yeah, it would be, actually. So, you know, bigger and better next time.

02:19:59.140 --> 02:20:02.140
That's great. Good job, guys.

02:20:02.140 --> 02:20:06.140
If anybody from that effort is listening, a tip of the hat to you.

02:20:06.140 --> 02:20:12.140
Lastly, but not leastly, gamergirl with an email.

02:20:12.140 --> 02:20:16.140
Or as she signed it, GG. Good game, gamergirl.

02:20:16.140 --> 02:20:22.140
Dear OLR, I first would like to say that if I make any mistakes, i.e. grammatical errors, I apologize.

02:20:22.140 --> 02:20:25.140
You guys, as always, have an amazing show. Keep up the good work.

02:20:25.140 --> 02:20:30.140
I never thought my life would change so drastically with everyone's help.

02:20:30.140 --> 02:20:33.140
I got to thinking a lot about how everything good happened to me because of OLR,

02:20:33.140 --> 02:20:37.140
and it never ceases to amaze me how you guys are always helping everyone.

02:20:37.140 --> 02:20:45.140
As a matter of fact, as of January 19th, 2013, your very own Dark Tetsuya and gamergirl are officially engaged.

02:20:45.140 --> 02:20:48.140
Wow. Congratulations.

02:20:48.140 --> 02:20:54.140
Another OLR love story for the books, guys. Well done. As always, I enjoy the show.

02:20:54.140 --> 02:20:58.140
Thanks again for introducing me to my best friend and soon to be life partner, gamergirl.

02:20:58.140 --> 02:21:00.140
Wow.

02:21:01.140 --> 02:21:03.140
I happened to see that on Facebook earlier.

02:21:03.140 --> 02:21:08.140
Yeah, yeah. I had heard of this before the email came in, but still.

02:21:08.140 --> 02:21:17.140
Just to kind of have it put in that perspective kind of way that they had met through OLR is really like, wow.

02:21:17.140 --> 02:21:21.140
I've been blown away with some of the emails and comments we've been getting the past couple weeks.

02:21:21.140 --> 02:21:25.140
2013 is the year you're trying to make me cry, y'all.

02:21:25.140 --> 02:21:30.140
Well, good job. Does this mean we have to send over? I don't know where they're getting married or whatever,

02:21:30.140 --> 02:21:34.140
if it's going to be here or because I think they have a distance right now between them.

02:21:34.140 --> 02:21:40.140
But I wonder if we need to send along a tape message or something, or is that even appropriate? I don't know.

02:21:40.140 --> 02:21:45.140
You know what? Get the speed run demo, guys, at your wedding reception. That's how you do it.

02:21:45.140 --> 02:21:47.140
That'd be great.

02:21:47.140 --> 02:21:52.140
Good job. A big congratulations and a perfect way to end the mailbag this week.

02:21:52.140 --> 02:21:56.140
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. Wowzy, wowzy, wow.

02:21:56.140 --> 02:21:58.140
Thanks for doing the mailbox for me.

02:21:58.140 --> 02:22:03.140
You're welcome, but you're going to need to fend for yourself on this upcoming segment.

02:22:03.140 --> 02:22:07.140
We're going to flip a 180, turn this car around and go from lovey-dovey stuff.

02:22:07.140 --> 02:22:09.140
We're going to flip this bitch.

02:22:09.140 --> 02:22:12.140
We're going to flip a bitch right now and get into the bitching.

02:22:22.140 --> 02:22:27.140
This is punishment. This is fucked up.

02:22:27.140 --> 02:22:33.140
My F.U. goes to the old woman who is driving in front of me on my way here.

02:22:33.140 --> 02:22:39.140
You know how some people turn into the suicide lane, the turn lane in the middle?

02:22:39.140 --> 02:22:43.140
Well, this woman doesn't even signal the moment this red truck starts pulling into it.

02:22:43.140 --> 02:22:46.140
We're on the inside lane heading toward here.

02:22:46.140 --> 02:22:49.140
She just swerves into the right lane, doesn't even look if there's somebody else there.

02:22:49.140 --> 02:22:52.140
And I'm like, really, bitch? You thought that he was going to run into you?

02:22:52.140 --> 02:22:54.140
Ugh, I was just so tired.

02:22:54.140 --> 02:22:59.140
And so finally I ended up thinking, this woman is dangerous. I'm getting away from her.

02:22:59.140 --> 02:23:02.140
And so I sped around her and got away from her.

02:23:02.140 --> 02:23:05.140
And she was just moving back and forth in between lanes.

02:23:05.140 --> 02:23:09.140
She's like, I'm going to use both lanes. Fuck. I'm safer in the middle.

02:23:09.140 --> 02:23:14.140
So I was like, yeah. Another F.U. goes to me losing my voice.

02:23:15.140 --> 02:23:19.140
I've been fighting off getting sick and I think I'm over it.

02:23:19.140 --> 02:23:23.140
It's just left me with a really sore throat. So, yeah.

02:23:26.140 --> 02:23:28.140
F.U. to my throat for hurting.

02:23:28.140 --> 02:23:34.140
And F.U. for my brain being tired when I want to do something that involves a lot of thinking.

02:23:34.140 --> 02:23:38.140
Especially in the form of actually working with some programs and stuff that I have on here.

02:23:38.140 --> 02:23:41.140
Or learning to program, that would be fantastic.

02:23:41.140 --> 02:23:43.140
But it seems like whenever I do that.

02:23:43.140 --> 02:23:48.140
If somebody decides to watch Law and Order SVU, my brain is just like.

02:23:48.140 --> 02:23:50.140
Like I just can't fucking concentrate.

02:23:50.140 --> 02:23:54.140
Hey, Dark Tetsuya and Gamer Girl, guess what you have to look forward to?

02:23:56.140 --> 02:23:57.140
Thank you.

02:23:57.140 --> 02:23:58.140
Married life.

02:23:58.140 --> 02:24:00.140
Thankfully we are almost done with Law and Order SVU.

02:24:00.140 --> 02:24:04.140
We are in the 14th season. We are on the home stretch. It is almost over.

02:24:04.140 --> 02:24:07.140
I just realized today, because we're sharing a Hulu account with some other people.

02:24:07.140 --> 02:24:11.140
That American Idol just started. I'm like, when the fuck did that start?

02:24:11.140 --> 02:24:14.140
I knew because my mom had to call me and tell me about how she.

02:24:14.140 --> 02:24:17.140
Rab! American Idol is on and this girl is good.

02:24:17.140 --> 02:24:23.140
No, no. She is over the Nicki Minaj Mariah thing. She is over that.

02:24:23.140 --> 02:24:25.140
I didn't even see the picture.

02:24:25.140 --> 02:24:29.140
I had no idea because I don't watch cable anymore or even basic TV anymore.

02:24:29.140 --> 02:24:34.140
So, it's like I didn't even know. That's just crazy that I shouldn't.

02:24:34.140 --> 02:24:36.140
I see the billboards.

02:24:36.140 --> 02:24:39.140
Well, in San Francisco. There was a huge one going over the Bay Bridge.

02:24:39.140 --> 02:24:42.140
Yeah, so, I mean, that's the crime.

02:24:42.140 --> 02:24:45.140
All right, uh, let's see. My Fuse of the Week.

02:24:45.140 --> 02:24:48.140
I've been getting like weird side pains again and that always freaks me out.

02:24:48.140 --> 02:24:51.140
Because, you know, long time listeners of the show remember like five years ago,

02:24:51.140 --> 02:24:53.140
I was in the hospital beating some of that stuff.

02:24:53.140 --> 02:24:55.140
So, like every time I get side pains, I get like really freaked out.

02:24:55.140 --> 02:24:57.140
Like, oh my God, I'm sick again.

02:24:57.140 --> 02:24:58.140
And then it's gas.

02:24:58.140 --> 02:25:01.140
Yeah, or like I'm just gaining weight or something.

02:25:01.140 --> 02:25:05.140
So, here's to hoping it's fat if nothing else.

02:25:05.140 --> 02:25:07.140
Hey, Rob. Avoid the Taco Bell.

02:25:07.140 --> 02:25:08.140
What?

02:25:09.140 --> 02:25:11.140
I didn't eat Jack in the Box.

02:25:11.140 --> 02:25:13.140
Loki talked about it.

02:25:13.140 --> 02:25:15.140
I wanted to eat Jack in the Box today.

02:25:15.140 --> 02:25:17.140
I really wanted to go there and be late.

02:25:17.140 --> 02:25:21.140
But I wanted, we went out for gay brunch as we usually do on Sundays.

02:25:21.140 --> 02:25:23.140
And I call it gay brunch because we eat brunch with other gays.

02:25:23.140 --> 02:25:26.140
And I wanted to eat healthy.

02:25:26.140 --> 02:25:30.140
But I'm sorry, sir. We don't do salads until 1130.

02:25:30.140 --> 02:25:33.140
LOL. It's time for red velvet pancakes.

02:25:33.140 --> 02:25:34.140
Yeah, I know, right?

02:25:34.140 --> 02:25:37.140
Well, I got like Hawaiian bread French toast, which is really good.

02:25:37.140 --> 02:25:41.140
Don't get me wrong, but probably not the healthiest thing I could eat.

02:25:41.140 --> 02:25:45.140
Whereas Alan's like, well, I was going to eat the veggie omelet,

02:25:45.140 --> 02:25:48.140
but I decided I'd go a little dairy and get turkey.

02:25:50.140 --> 02:25:52.140
By the way, Alan has lost like a lot of weight.

02:25:52.140 --> 02:25:55.140
I was about to say, Alan's doing really, really well.

02:25:55.140 --> 02:26:00.140
You think I would like, you know, try to take some cues and do the same thing.

02:26:00.140 --> 02:26:05.140
Now you can be the like, what's the old-ass poem Jack Spratt and his wife?

02:26:05.140 --> 02:26:07.140
Well, here's the thing.

02:26:07.140 --> 02:26:10.140
Alan's got the advantage on me where he walks to work and all that.

02:26:10.140 --> 02:26:13.140
And I've been very bad when it gets too motivated for exercise.

02:26:13.140 --> 02:26:15.140
Like I really need to really motivate myself to exercise.

02:26:15.140 --> 02:26:17.140
It's the only way I'm ever going to change things.

02:26:17.140 --> 02:26:20.140
And then snacking. I am a terrible, terrible snacker.

02:26:20.140 --> 02:26:22.140
Like that is my weakness.

02:26:22.140 --> 02:26:27.140
I really need to just get rid of every horrible snack out of this house

02:26:27.140 --> 02:26:29.140
and have nothing but carrots and celery in the fridge so I have no choice.

02:26:29.140 --> 02:26:30.140
But then that's not fair at all.

02:26:30.140 --> 02:26:33.140
On Fridays at our work, they pop popcorn in the popcorn machine that we have.

02:26:33.140 --> 02:26:35.140
And I'm not talking about like a popcorn machine like an air popper.

02:26:35.140 --> 02:26:40.140
I'm talking about a big fucking popcorn machine that they have at the movie theater's popcorn machine.

02:26:40.140 --> 02:26:42.140
They pop extra popcorn for me.

02:26:42.140 --> 02:26:46.140
They gave me a bowl. Like a big-ass bowl.

02:26:46.140 --> 02:26:50.140
I eat more popcorn at that company than the fucking people at the company other than me.

02:26:50.140 --> 02:26:52.140
Of course, I don't eat it all.

02:26:52.140 --> 02:26:55.140
I normally skip lunch that day, but that's a lot of popcorn.

02:26:55.140 --> 02:26:56.140
That's a lot of popcorn.

02:26:56.140 --> 02:26:57.140
Some questions in the chat room.

02:26:57.140 --> 02:26:59.140
Acidic Vampire in the chat says,

02:26:59.140 --> 02:27:01.140
Red velvet pancakes? The fuck? I want that.

02:27:01.140 --> 02:27:03.140
Is that a West Coast thing for Jack in the Box?

02:27:03.140 --> 02:27:04.140
No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:27:04.140 --> 02:27:07.140
Don't get them, by the way, at Denny's because they're awful.

02:27:07.140 --> 02:27:08.140
They just like hush puppies.

02:27:08.140 --> 02:27:09.140
They're just red food coloring. Yes.

02:27:09.140 --> 02:27:12.140
Denny's does have the red velvet, but it's not like, it's not.

02:27:12.140 --> 02:27:16.140
It's on the Hobbit menu so it gives you cancer and makes you live underground.

02:27:16.140 --> 02:27:17.140
So here's the thing.

02:27:17.140 --> 02:27:19.140
They don't have that at Jack in the Box.

02:27:19.140 --> 02:27:21.140
No. Jack in the Box has deep fried tacos.

02:27:21.140 --> 02:27:23.140
That's what you get at Jack in the Box.

02:27:23.140 --> 02:27:24.140
Red velvet pancakes.

02:27:24.140 --> 02:27:27.140
We went to a brunch place once and they happen to have red velvet pancakes.

02:27:27.140 --> 02:27:29.140
It was like, oh my God.

02:27:29.140 --> 02:27:30.140
That we went to.

02:27:30.140 --> 02:27:31.140
Was it Red Rabbit?

02:27:31.140 --> 02:27:32.140
I think so.

02:27:32.140 --> 02:27:34.140
I went to have the pumpkin and you had red velvet.

02:27:34.140 --> 02:27:36.140
Yeah. Fucking amazing.

02:27:36.140 --> 02:27:38.140
I want pancakes now.

02:27:38.140 --> 02:27:40.140
Good times. Pancakes.

02:27:40.140 --> 02:27:42.140
All right. That's it for the FUs of the week.

02:27:42.140 --> 02:27:43.140
Skype line soon.

02:27:43.140 --> 02:27:44.140
Twitter topic soon as well.

02:27:44.140 --> 02:27:47.140
But first, a couple more news stories.

02:27:47.140 --> 02:27:48.140
All right.

02:27:48.140 --> 02:27:50.140
And let's see here.

02:27:50.140 --> 02:28:02.140
Let's talk a little bit about the next generation of Kinect because of course we know that the next Xbox system is going to have Kinect and we need to know what the hell it's going to be able to do.

02:28:02.140 --> 02:28:04.140
Well, this may be kind of an idea.

02:28:04.140 --> 02:28:14.140
The company that was behind the Kinect sensor in the first place has this cool video that they put out kind of showing what it's going to do.

02:28:14.140 --> 02:28:21.140
And basically everything that the original Kinect was supposed to do but didn't actually kind of do.

02:28:21.140 --> 02:28:23.140
You know, the whole closed thing.

02:28:23.140 --> 02:28:33.140
They're saying that they're going to try to work this technology into pretty much everything into like, you know, non display stuff to all the computers.

02:28:33.140 --> 02:28:34.140
And it's just going to work.

02:28:34.140 --> 02:28:38.140
It's going to have, you know, high speed tracking, all that stuff.

02:28:38.140 --> 02:28:45.140
And actually the little thing that they've got there, the prototype looks exactly like the Kinect with some extra bullshit sticking out of the top.

02:28:45.140 --> 02:28:49.140
I'm not really sure what the hell that is, but it's in developers hands right now.

02:28:49.140 --> 02:28:54.140
So they're going to be using this and it's called Capri.

02:28:54.140 --> 02:28:59.140
The next generation of sensors.

02:28:59.140 --> 02:29:01.140
The next generation.

02:29:01.140 --> 02:29:06.140
Yeah, they're saying it's supposed to have they're going to be trying to fit it into everyday devices.

02:29:06.140 --> 02:29:10.140
And they're seeing it the same resolution as the Kinect.

02:29:10.140 --> 02:29:13.140
And it looks it looks pretty cool.

02:29:13.140 --> 02:29:21.140
I mean, the video like watching the video reminded me a lot of just like everything like they show this guy at a presentation.

02:29:21.140 --> 02:29:28.140
He's, you know, you know, manipulating stuff on the screen as you would think, you know, that you would be able to do.

02:29:28.140 --> 02:29:36.140
You know, there's talking about like, you know, even stuff to where, you know, oh, hey, I have someone coming over and facial recognition.

02:29:36.140 --> 02:29:37.140
Oh, it's my friend.

02:29:37.140 --> 02:29:39.140
It's going to unlock the door for him.

02:29:39.140 --> 02:29:41.140
And then he comes in and murders you.

02:29:41.140 --> 02:29:48.140
You know, that's for like switching channels on your TV by just like kind of going and moving my hand back and forth.

02:29:48.140 --> 02:29:51.140
That type of stuff, because, you know, pushing buttons are both so hard.

02:29:51.140 --> 02:29:53.140
Move my hand back and forth.

02:29:53.140 --> 02:29:57.140
Swiping a fly away. Your TV's going crazy.

02:29:57.140 --> 02:30:00.140
All right. One more news story for you guys.

02:30:00.140 --> 02:30:05.140
OK, this isn't gaming technically, but it is the voice of geeks network, you guys.

02:30:05.140 --> 02:30:08.140
So once in a while, we got to blur the line a little bit.

02:30:08.140 --> 02:30:17.140
And this has to do with a musician who did make one of like the greatest video game songs of the past 10 years still alive from Portal.

02:30:17.140 --> 02:30:20.140
Right.

02:30:20.140 --> 02:30:24.140
I'm making a joke. Oh, I'm talking about Jonathan.

02:30:24.140 --> 02:30:27.140
So nice in person.

02:30:27.140 --> 02:30:29.140
He's a lovable nerd.

02:30:29.140 --> 02:30:36.140
And so, of course, the Internet rallied to his defense when people kind of wronged him.

02:30:36.140 --> 02:30:39.140
This has to do with the Glee issue.

02:30:39.140 --> 02:30:43.140
Here's the thing. An upcoming episode of Glee is going to feature Baby Got Back.

02:30:43.140 --> 02:30:46.140
Now, Baby Got Back was a Sir Mix-a-Lot song.

02:30:46.140 --> 02:30:52.140
But a few years ago, I think it was 2006, Joko did his own version of Baby Got Back.

02:30:52.140 --> 02:30:54.140
And it was very different.

02:31:01.140 --> 02:31:03.140
The Joko version.

02:31:08.140 --> 02:31:10.140
You never heard this, huh?

02:31:10.140 --> 02:31:12.140
I listened to it after.

02:31:12.140 --> 02:31:15.140
The lounge version by Lounge Against the Machine.

02:31:15.140 --> 02:31:17.140
Right, right.

02:31:17.140 --> 02:31:19.140
Yeah, Richard Cheeze.

02:31:19.140 --> 02:31:21.140
And, you know, of course, Mr. Mix-a-Lot.

02:31:21.140 --> 02:31:24.140
So technically it is Sir Mix-a-Lot's song.

02:31:24.140 --> 02:31:26.140
And Joko did a cover.

02:31:26.140 --> 02:31:28.140
He did a cover, but it was a licensed cover.

02:31:28.140 --> 02:31:31.140
He licensed the rights to do that and he made his own original version.

02:31:31.140 --> 02:31:34.140
It's very unique and, you know, very different.

02:31:34.140 --> 02:31:37.140
It's kind of like Johnny Cash's Hurt.

02:31:37.140 --> 02:31:39.140
Like the Nine Inch Nails version. Amazing.

02:31:39.140 --> 02:31:41.140
Johnny Cash's version.

02:31:41.140 --> 02:31:43.140
Fucking amazing.

02:31:43.140 --> 02:31:45.140
It's hard for me to say that because I love the Nine Inch Nails version so much.

02:31:45.140 --> 02:31:48.140
But they are both so fucking good.

02:31:48.140 --> 02:31:53.140
When Trent Reznor is saying that he likes it better, then you know you've got amazing.

02:31:53.140 --> 02:31:55.140
But here's the problem.

02:31:55.140 --> 02:31:57.140
Glee, the TV show.

02:31:57.140 --> 02:32:00.140
They do a lot of covers and all that stuff.

02:32:00.140 --> 02:32:08.140
Here is the Glee version of Baby Got Back set to be on the Sadie Hawkins episode that will be on the 24th.

02:32:08.140 --> 02:32:11.140
This song was available in the US iTunes store.

02:32:11.140 --> 02:32:14.140
It was pulled. It was still spotted on the Swedish iTunes store.

02:32:14.140 --> 02:32:16.140
So yes, this is legit.

02:32:16.140 --> 02:32:19.140
See if you see any similarities here in the Glee version of Baby Got Back.

02:32:38.140 --> 02:32:42.140
I think I heard that before somewhere.

02:32:42.140 --> 02:32:44.140
Look.

02:32:44.140 --> 02:32:47.140
It's one thing to cover the song, especially when you're going to do it.

02:32:47.140 --> 02:32:49.140
Like the original.

02:32:49.140 --> 02:32:52.140
I don't think I need to play the original version of Baby Got Back.

02:32:52.140 --> 02:32:57.140
But I'll do the Rob Roberts cover of Baby Got Back.

02:32:57.140 --> 02:32:58.140
You ready?

02:32:58.140 --> 02:33:00.140
Oh. My. God.

02:33:00.140 --> 02:33:02.140
Becky, look at her butt.

02:33:02.140 --> 02:33:04.140
It is so big.

02:33:04.140 --> 02:33:06.140
Obviously the original was very, very different.

02:33:06.140 --> 02:33:08.140
It had the whole beat to it.

02:33:08.140 --> 02:33:13.140
So for Glee to just totally rip this off the way they did is kind of shitty.

02:33:13.140 --> 02:33:15.140
It's really shitty.

02:33:15.140 --> 02:33:18.140
To think that nobody would notice is crazy.

02:33:18.140 --> 02:33:24.140
Now, just so you know, Joko, what is making the internet rally around him is that he posted to his Twitter.

02:33:24.140 --> 02:33:26.140
I had no idea.

02:33:26.140 --> 02:33:28.140
He had no clue.

02:33:28.140 --> 02:33:30.140
And he's like, WTF.

02:33:30.140 --> 02:33:32.140
And he is trying to see what kind of legal action is available at this point, but it's complicated.

02:33:32.140 --> 02:33:36.140
I mean, it wasn't really his song in the first place, although it was his arrangement.

02:33:36.140 --> 02:33:39.140
Here's the best part. You might be getting to this, Loki.

02:33:39.140 --> 02:33:47.140
In the lyrics, if I were to play the full thing, a part where he changed the lyrics from Sir Mix-a-Lot to Johnny C.

02:33:47.140 --> 02:33:51.140
Glee sings in their version, Johnny C.

02:33:51.140 --> 02:33:53.140
So you know damn well where they got it.

02:33:53.140 --> 02:33:55.140
There is no mystery.

02:33:55.140 --> 02:33:57.140
They removed one of them at the end.

02:33:57.140 --> 02:34:02.140
The 1-900, he did something else.

02:34:02.140 --> 02:34:04.140
1-900 something and then he changed it.

02:34:08.140 --> 02:34:10.140
I mean, come on, man.

02:34:10.140 --> 02:34:12.140
That is just blatant.

02:34:12.140 --> 02:34:17.140
And even he said they stole the arrangement.

02:34:17.140 --> 02:34:24.140
There's actually duck sounds or something in the background that he sampled or something that are in that song in exactly the same spot.

02:34:24.140 --> 02:34:27.140
Like they stole the instrumental and just sang over it.

02:34:32.140 --> 02:34:34.140
So yeah, I don't know what's going to happen from here.

02:34:34.140 --> 02:34:37.140
Do you think legally he could do anything about it?

02:34:37.140 --> 02:34:38.140
Yeah, he can. I think he can.

02:34:38.140 --> 02:34:40.140
If they actually stole the lyrics or whatever?

02:34:40.140 --> 02:34:42.140
Yeah, because it's his arrangement.

02:34:42.140 --> 02:34:44.140
I think that he definitely has a case.

02:34:46.140 --> 02:34:51.140
Well, gee, the folks in the chat rooms really seem to be enjoying the Rob Roberts cover of Baby Got Back.

02:34:51.140 --> 02:34:53.140
So big butts and I cannot lie.

02:34:53.140 --> 02:34:55.140
You other brothers can't deny.

02:35:00.140 --> 02:35:01.140
The original is awesome.

02:35:01.140 --> 02:35:03.140
Meanwhile, Alan is like, please stop.

02:35:03.140 --> 02:35:04.140
Please don't.

02:35:04.140 --> 02:35:05.140
Knock it off.

02:35:05.140 --> 02:35:07.140
Yeah, but Alan, you weren't here watching Rob shake his ass.

02:35:09.140 --> 02:35:11.140
I like Ross Steel UT's comment.

02:35:11.140 --> 02:35:13.140
Seriously, that's some Milli Vanilli shit.

02:35:15.140 --> 02:35:17.140
There's a little bit of a clap that I heard in the beginning.

02:35:17.140 --> 02:35:24.140
I want them to do the vanilla ice defense where it's like, but see, mine went, you know, the original went boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

02:35:24.140 --> 02:35:27.140
But mine went boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

02:35:27.140 --> 02:35:29.140
You see, it's different, right?

02:35:29.140 --> 02:35:30.140
Totally.

02:35:30.140 --> 02:35:32.140
It's totally different.

02:35:32.140 --> 02:35:34.140
We added the the in there.

02:35:34.140 --> 02:35:35.140
It makes it different.

02:35:35.140 --> 02:35:36.140
Yeah.

02:35:36.140 --> 02:35:37.140
So under pressure.

02:35:37.140 --> 02:35:39.140
Rama in the chat says, wait, hold it.

02:35:39.140 --> 02:35:43.140
Glee is still relevant apparently, but it's sinking in the ratings, but they're going to I think I heard they're going to.

02:35:44.140 --> 02:35:51.140
I want to know, OK, because it's supposed to be this new guy that's coming to the school or whatever that's hitting on the the, you know, the clearly gay guy on the show.

02:35:51.140 --> 02:35:58.140
Isn't it a little awkward to be singing a song about I like big butts and like about all these things about butts that you like and stuff?

02:35:58.140 --> 02:36:00.140
Because it seems a little weird.

02:36:00.140 --> 02:36:01.140
I mean.

02:36:02.140 --> 02:36:03.140
I don't know.

02:36:04.140 --> 02:36:08.140
It's just a weird song anyway, because no one over 12 watches Glee in the first place.

02:36:09.140 --> 02:36:14.140
And honestly, the people that, you know, watch Glee or whatever, do they really know what baby got back is?

02:36:14.140 --> 02:36:18.140
I mean, a lot of the kids were probably not even born when that song came out.

02:36:21.140 --> 02:36:22.140
I don't know.

02:36:22.140 --> 02:36:23.140
Is it that old?

02:36:23.140 --> 02:36:24.140
All I do.

02:36:24.140 --> 02:36:26.140
I just I just wish Glee would get canceled.

02:36:26.140 --> 02:36:27.140
That's what I wish.

02:36:28.140 --> 02:36:29.140
All right.

02:36:30.140 --> 02:36:32.140
That does it for news tonight.

02:36:32.140 --> 02:36:33.140
That was the last story.

02:36:34.140 --> 02:36:36.140
1877 Game OLR.

02:36:36.140 --> 02:36:39.140
Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:36:39.140 --> 02:36:42.140
The Skype line is open right now if you want to give us a call.

02:36:42.140 --> 02:36:45.140
And while we wait for some calls to come in.

02:36:45.140 --> 02:36:47.140
Oh, it is already lighting up on the phone.

02:36:47.140 --> 02:36:50.140
Let's go to the phones and say hello to whoever's on the line.

02:36:50.140 --> 02:36:52.140
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:36:52.140 --> 02:36:53.140
Who's this?

02:36:53.140 --> 02:36:54.140
Hi.

02:36:54.140 --> 02:36:55.140
Hi.

02:36:55.140 --> 02:36:56.140
Is that Bobby Blackwolf?

02:36:56.140 --> 02:36:57.140
It's Bobby.

02:36:57.140 --> 02:36:58.140
Hi, Bobby.

02:36:58.140 --> 02:37:00.140
You don't sound so good, Bobby.

02:37:00.140 --> 02:37:03.140
I feel like a sad panda or I should say a sad little birdie.

02:37:03.140 --> 02:37:04.140
What's wrong, Bobby?

02:37:04.140 --> 02:37:05.140
Sportsball.

02:37:05.140 --> 02:37:09.140
Oh, did you have a rough day at work?

02:37:11.140 --> 02:37:12.140
I need to cheer up.

02:37:12.140 --> 02:37:13.140
Are there any new games coming out?

02:37:13.140 --> 02:37:14.140
I need a diversion.

02:37:14.140 --> 02:37:15.140
Not really.

02:37:15.140 --> 02:37:16.140
Double may cry.

02:37:16.140 --> 02:37:17.140
There's Nino Cooney.

02:37:17.140 --> 02:37:19.140
Nino Cooney's coming out this week, Bobby.

02:37:21.140 --> 02:37:23.140
You could try the demo.

02:37:25.140 --> 02:37:27.140
You could try your face.

02:37:27.140 --> 02:37:28.140
Hey, wait.

02:37:28.140 --> 02:37:30.140
Bobby, that's a response after my own heart.

02:37:30.140 --> 02:37:32.140
That's the Jamie defense right there.

02:37:32.140 --> 02:37:36.140
Okay, Bobby, it's just a game, Bobby.

02:37:36.140 --> 02:37:39.140
Here, I got something to help you out, okay?

02:37:39.140 --> 02:37:42.140
Let's go back to a time when your team was winning things,

02:37:42.140 --> 02:37:45.140
which I don't know if that actually exists,

02:37:45.140 --> 02:37:49.140
but we'll make believe that there was a time your team was winning things.

02:37:49.140 --> 02:37:54.140
No, seriously, you posted on Twitter this week some classic G4 material,

02:37:54.140 --> 02:37:58.140
which is appropriately timed with the whole G4 officially dead,

02:37:58.140 --> 02:38:01.140
even though many of us say it had the life sucked out of it years ago.

02:38:01.140 --> 02:38:08.140
You were posting some classic stuff from G4's little 2020-style show Pulse, right?

02:38:08.140 --> 02:38:09.140
Right.

02:38:09.140 --> 02:38:12.140
It wasn't 2020 as much as it was just the news.

02:38:12.140 --> 02:38:15.140
It kind of had a 2020 vibe to me, but yeah.

02:38:15.140 --> 02:38:19.140
How many legit gamer news shows do you see on TV now?

02:38:19.140 --> 02:38:20.140
Not a lot.

02:38:20.140 --> 02:38:22.140
Yeah, exactly.

02:38:22.140 --> 02:38:27.140
But it was a clip from the Philly Classic Game Expo, right?

02:38:27.140 --> 02:38:33.140
Right. It was from 2004, in I think March of 2004,

02:38:33.140 --> 02:38:35.140
and it was the Philly Classic Gaming Expo,

02:38:35.140 --> 02:38:39.140
and I was actually a co-organizer of it along with a couple other people,

02:38:39.140 --> 02:38:43.140
one of which was another moderator on the forums over at G4.

02:38:43.140 --> 02:38:49.140
We had all converged on Philly Classic 4 the year before,

02:38:49.140 --> 02:38:52.140
and we kind of had a table, and it was kind of a G4 forum meetup and stuff,

02:38:52.140 --> 02:38:54.140
and we had about 15 people.

02:38:54.140 --> 02:38:57.140
And for Philly Classic 5, it was like 50 people.

02:38:57.140 --> 02:39:00.140
It was kind of like our PAX08 experience.

02:39:00.140 --> 02:39:02.140
Yeah, oh man, I love PAX08.

02:39:02.140 --> 02:39:04.140
But it was basically the G4 version of it.

02:39:04.140 --> 02:39:05.140
Right.

02:39:05.140 --> 02:39:09.140
And what a lot of people in the OR audience latched onto

02:39:09.140 --> 02:39:12.140
was the fact that when I was on it, Beardless,

02:39:12.140 --> 02:39:14.140
because this was before the beard,

02:39:14.140 --> 02:39:17.140
there was a little bit of Bimani behind me,

02:39:17.140 --> 02:39:21.140
and that was actually my setup at the show.

02:39:21.140 --> 02:39:25.140
So as much as I rag on Bimani now, it wasn't dead then.

02:39:25.140 --> 02:39:28.140
I think 7th Style had just come out maybe,

02:39:28.140 --> 02:39:30.140
or it was right around that time.

02:39:30.140 --> 02:39:32.140
I'm not dead yet.

02:39:32.140 --> 02:39:35.140
And this was before Guitar Hero, so I'm like,

02:39:35.140 --> 02:39:38.140
these are classics, instant classics, that's what I'll call it.

02:39:38.140 --> 02:39:43.140
And he wanted some Ruddy Gore, Mark Wolf, who's in the video.

02:39:43.140 --> 02:39:46.140
He kind of wanted some other different type of stuff,

02:39:46.140 --> 02:39:48.140
so I'm like, fine, I'll bring my stuff,

02:39:48.140 --> 02:39:50.140
all my import consoles and everything,

02:39:50.140 --> 02:39:53.140
and I brought my stereo system and they provided the TV,

02:39:53.140 --> 02:39:58.140
and I would run that weekend, I think I ran Beatmania 2DX,

02:39:58.140 --> 02:40:01.140
I had Para Para Paradise, which we played once,

02:40:01.140 --> 02:40:05.140
because of just the spacing.

02:40:05.140 --> 02:40:09.140
I had Taiko no Tetsujin, and I had Donkey Konga,

02:40:09.140 --> 02:40:11.140
I had both versions.

02:40:11.140 --> 02:40:15.140
And Tommy Tallarico was the first time he had ever played it.

02:40:15.140 --> 02:40:16.140
Oh wow.

02:40:16.140 --> 02:40:18.140
And so one of the pictures I posted up on Twitter

02:40:18.140 --> 02:40:21.140
was actually Tommy Tallarico playing Taiko no Tetsujin for the first time.

02:40:21.140 --> 02:40:23.140
Oh, funny.

02:40:23.140 --> 02:40:25.140
Because he was there, he was one of the guests there,

02:40:25.140 --> 02:40:30.140
they actually had, I think it was Philly Classic 4,

02:40:30.140 --> 02:40:32.140
they actually had, and I can't remember her name,

02:40:32.140 --> 02:40:35.140
but the woman from Tron?

02:40:35.140 --> 02:40:37.140
Olivia Wilde?

02:40:37.140 --> 02:40:39.140
No, the original Tron.

02:40:39.140 --> 02:40:42.140
Oh, Wendy, they did the music, right?

02:40:42.140 --> 02:40:46.140
No, the woman who played the love interest.

02:40:46.140 --> 02:40:48.140
Oh!

02:40:48.140 --> 02:40:51.140
I think it's the only thing she's ever done that anybody remembers.

02:40:51.140 --> 02:40:53.140
Because there was a movement to bring her back for the new movie,

02:40:53.140 --> 02:40:55.140
it didn't work.

02:40:55.140 --> 02:40:59.140
Yeah, but that's where I met Sid Meier,

02:40:59.140 --> 02:41:01.140
showed up there, and in Philly Classic 5,

02:41:01.140 --> 02:41:04.140
they had Howard Scott Warshaw, who made E.T. and all that stuff.

02:41:04.140 --> 02:41:07.140
But it was a lot of fun, and I exposed a lot of people to that.

02:41:07.140 --> 02:41:11.140
And then I also would run Guitar Man and Rez, as well.

02:41:11.140 --> 02:41:14.140
So it was a whole music game, my area was like the music game area.

02:41:14.140 --> 02:41:18.140
It looked like a lot of fun, even though music games that you were bringing

02:41:18.140 --> 02:41:21.140
maybe weren't quote-unquote classic games,

02:41:21.140 --> 02:41:25.140
still, I like the instant classic touch on it, it was still a convention.

02:41:25.140 --> 02:41:28.140
Music games show up at every convention, deal with it.

02:41:28.140 --> 02:41:31.140
Other people had the DDR stuff, I'm like,

02:41:31.140 --> 02:41:33.140
I don't do the DDR, I'm doing all the other stuff.

02:41:33.140 --> 02:41:35.140
There you go, trying to bring the other stuff to life.

02:41:35.140 --> 02:41:38.140
If you like DDR, then you might like...

02:41:39.140 --> 02:41:42.140
Why, I mean, it's not running anymore, though, right?

02:41:42.140 --> 02:41:45.140
It folded, I'm sure business reasons or whatever.

02:41:45.140 --> 02:41:48.140
They wanted to, we had big plans for Philly Classic 6,

02:41:48.140 --> 02:41:52.140
but unfortunately, the people that were up in Philadelphia that ran it,

02:41:52.140 --> 02:41:54.140
there was a little bit of drama.

02:41:54.140 --> 02:41:57.140
Essentially, the short version that I kind of remember

02:41:57.140 --> 02:42:00.140
is that they had kind of passed the keys on to another guy

02:42:00.140 --> 02:42:03.140
who completely changed the show,

02:42:03.140 --> 02:42:07.140
and he changed it to something else, and it folded after two or three years.

02:42:07.140 --> 02:42:09.140
So they had trusted somebody else with it,

02:42:09.140 --> 02:42:12.140
and he's like, yeah, the classic games are kind of cool and stuff,

02:42:12.140 --> 02:42:15.140
but we're going to expand.

02:42:15.140 --> 02:42:20.140
And he thought, really, really big, and then it petered out.

02:42:22.140 --> 02:42:26.140
That sucks. You should definitely check out some day.

02:42:26.140 --> 02:42:28.140
I know it involves traveling to California,

02:42:28.140 --> 02:42:31.140
but California Extreme is an awesome classic game show

02:42:31.140 --> 02:42:33.140
with all the old-school arcade machines and stuff.

02:42:33.140 --> 02:42:35.140
That's the kind of thing I think of.

02:42:35.140 --> 02:42:37.140
It's really, really lots of fun.

02:42:39.140 --> 02:42:42.140
There was one of the local arcade distributors

02:42:42.140 --> 02:42:46.140
that still worked in arcades with a lot of the classic systems.

02:42:46.140 --> 02:42:48.140
They were on the East Coast somewhere,

02:42:48.140 --> 02:42:53.140
but they brought 50 arcade machines all set to free play to this show.

02:42:53.140 --> 02:42:57.140
Basically, what we did is, leading up to my little rhythm game thing,

02:42:57.140 --> 02:43:00.140
they had the gaming experience through time.

02:43:00.140 --> 02:43:02.140
You could go up and go to these consoles,

02:43:02.140 --> 02:43:07.140
and they started at the Magnavox Odyssey and then an Atari 2600,

02:43:07.140 --> 02:43:10.140
all going up to Xbox, PlayStation 2 and stuff.

02:43:10.140 --> 02:43:16.140
So you could actually go down the line and see the next console in time.

02:43:16.140 --> 02:43:18.140
It's like an interactive timeline.

02:43:18.140 --> 02:43:19.140
Yeah.

02:43:19.140 --> 02:43:20.140
Awesome.

02:43:20.140 --> 02:43:22.140
We did stuff like that, and it was a lot of fun.

02:43:22.140 --> 02:43:26.140
Many folks in chat saying, we should have a vogcon.

02:43:26.140 --> 02:43:28.140
We could have a vogcon some day.

02:43:28.140 --> 02:43:30.140
It's not outside the realm of possibility.

02:43:30.140 --> 02:43:32.140
And then Brad from Pod Culture,

02:43:32.140 --> 02:43:35.140
why don't you have vogcon in Atlanta the day before Dragon Con?

02:43:35.140 --> 02:43:38.140
Yeah, because why don't we just have it at Dragon Con?

02:43:38.140 --> 02:43:40.140
Probably the smartest idea.

02:43:40.140 --> 02:43:44.140
I think certainly there should be, whether it's official or unofficial,

02:43:44.140 --> 02:43:48.140
a vog event at Dragon Con is certainly within the realm of possibility for this year.

02:43:48.140 --> 02:43:51.140
Well, I've said we're going to have an official event.

02:43:51.140 --> 02:43:54.140
That's pretty much been confirmed to me.

02:43:54.140 --> 02:43:57.140
Obviously, I won't know for certain until next month.

02:43:57.140 --> 02:43:58.140
Right.

02:43:58.140 --> 02:44:04.140
No, we've already got an official panel, which means we'll be in the program and all that stuff.

02:44:04.140 --> 02:44:10.140
But then other events, there's a huge gaming area, tabletop gaming area downstairs,

02:44:10.140 --> 02:44:14.140
and we could easily commandeer a corner of that one night.

02:44:14.140 --> 02:44:15.140
Awesome.

02:44:15.140 --> 02:44:16.140
For just us.

02:44:16.140 --> 02:44:19.140
So it sounds like if you want to meet as many vog people as possible,

02:44:19.140 --> 02:44:21.140
Atlanta's going to be the place to be Labor Day weekend.

02:44:21.140 --> 02:44:22.140
That's right.

02:44:22.140 --> 02:44:23.140
There you go.

02:44:23.140 --> 02:44:24.140
You should do it.

02:44:24.140 --> 02:44:26.140
I won't be as depressed about sportsball.

02:44:26.140 --> 02:44:27.140
What's that?

02:44:27.140 --> 02:44:29.140
I won't be as depressed about sportsball.

02:44:29.140 --> 02:44:30.140
Yes, it'll all be over by then.

02:44:30.140 --> 02:44:33.140
If the Niners lose in a couple weeks, we'll make you feel better?

02:44:33.140 --> 02:44:37.140
No, see, I want them to win now because that means we lost to the champions.

02:44:37.140 --> 02:44:39.140
Ah, that's a good way of thinking about it.

02:44:39.140 --> 02:44:42.140
And here's the thing that made it worse, the sportsball thing worse,

02:44:42.140 --> 02:44:46.140
is because of the whole video game industry tie-in on my Twitter.

02:44:46.140 --> 02:44:51.140
The majority of the video game industry, especially the PR contacts, guess where they live?

02:44:51.140 --> 02:44:54.140
Of course, the Bay Area. I know that, yes.

02:44:54.140 --> 02:44:58.140
So I did not check my personal Twitter all day. I just could not take it.

02:44:58.140 --> 02:44:59.140
Couldn't handle it.

02:44:59.140 --> 02:45:03.140
Actually, I think the saddest picture you posted was the confetti cannon behind you guys,

02:45:03.140 --> 02:45:05.140
and you just put unused.

02:45:05.140 --> 02:45:07.140
Yes, it was right there.

02:45:07.140 --> 02:45:11.140
I actually took another picture of just my drum next to it and everybody else had left.

02:45:11.140 --> 02:45:14.140
It was just my drum next to the confetti cannon, but yeah.

02:45:17.140 --> 02:45:20.140
I'm sorry. Hey, there's always next year.

02:45:20.140 --> 02:45:21.140
There is.

02:45:21.140 --> 02:45:27.140
Well, Bobby, focus on the positive. Lots of good things coming with VOG and all that in the future.

02:45:27.140 --> 02:45:31.140
You did not have a show this week, sadly, but tell the folks where they can catch you next week.

02:45:31.140 --> 02:45:38.140
Right here on VOG. I'm the opening act, and I will be live next week.

02:45:38.140 --> 02:45:41.140
I will not be live the following week because of sportsball.

02:45:41.140 --> 02:45:46.140
And that was the other bad, because I go to a party because it's time I see a lot of my friends,

02:45:46.140 --> 02:45:49.140
and so I never do a show on the big super sportsball day.

02:45:49.140 --> 02:45:50.140
Right.

02:45:50.140 --> 02:45:54.140
The first couple messages I got from my friends, instead of saying,

02:45:54.140 --> 02:45:59.140
oh man, sorry, and all that stuff, and yeah, it was a closed game, blah, blah, blah.

02:45:59.140 --> 02:46:04.140
No, they were like, yes, this means you're coming to our Super Bowl party and bringing your pizza dip.

02:46:04.140 --> 02:46:05.140
And I was like, guys.

02:46:05.140 --> 02:46:09.140
Would you have actually had to fly to wherever they were having the Super Bowl this year?

02:46:09.140 --> 02:46:12.140
The plan was we were going to go to New Orleans.

02:46:12.140 --> 02:46:17.140
Even if we couldn't get into the game, we were going to do events, corporate events around New Orleans,

02:46:17.140 --> 02:46:19.140
maybe playing some of the bars.

02:46:19.140 --> 02:46:24.140
We'd march the tailgates outside of the Superdome, and then we'd go to a bar and watch the game at a bar.

02:46:24.140 --> 02:46:28.140
Tell me more about this pizza dip.

02:46:28.140 --> 02:46:31.140
It's a trade secret.

02:46:31.140 --> 02:46:36.140
Maybe Loki will have a reason to come to Atlanta if the wife will let him.

02:46:36.140 --> 02:46:42.140
All right, so visit our co-headliner, Bobby Blackwell, Sunday nights at the Voice of the Geeks Network, 5 o'clock.

02:46:42.140 --> 02:46:47.140
We may actually end up being off on that Sunday too, the Super Sunday as well.

02:46:47.140 --> 02:46:50.140
It's our lowest rated night of the year for obvious reasons.

02:46:50.140 --> 02:46:56.140
And I also was given a tip that it is the best day to go to a theme park near here.

02:46:56.140 --> 02:46:59.140
Not Disneyland, but one of the other ones, Magic Mountain.

02:46:59.140 --> 02:47:01.140
So I may go to Magic Mountain.

02:47:01.140 --> 02:47:02.140
All right.

02:47:02.140 --> 02:47:03.140
We'll see.

02:47:03.140 --> 02:47:04.140
So, yep.

02:47:04.140 --> 02:47:05.140
And so thank you.

02:47:05.140 --> 02:47:06.140
You guys cheered me up.

02:47:06.140 --> 02:47:07.140
Thank you, guys.

02:47:07.140 --> 02:47:08.140
Oh, thank you.

02:47:08.140 --> 02:47:09.140
I'm glad we could.

02:47:09.140 --> 02:47:13.140
And I'm glad we get to have you at the end of our show because you're always kind enough to have us on every week.

02:47:13.140 --> 02:47:16.140
I also cheered you up by beating all your scores on For the Horizon.

02:47:16.140 --> 02:47:17.140
Stop it.

02:47:17.140 --> 02:47:18.140
All right.

02:47:18.140 --> 02:47:19.140
Go kick his ass.

02:47:19.140 --> 02:47:21.140
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

02:47:21.140 --> 02:47:23.140
Making hearts in your direction.

02:47:23.140 --> 02:47:24.140
Oh, thank you.

02:47:24.140 --> 02:47:28.140
Because I feel bad for your team.

02:47:28.140 --> 02:47:29.140
Oh, my God.

02:47:29.140 --> 02:47:32.140
You got dark Sakura kind of to care about football.

02:47:32.140 --> 02:47:34.140
That should make you feel better than anything else.

02:47:34.140 --> 02:47:37.140
And see, I would have gotten a ring.

02:47:37.140 --> 02:47:41.140
If we had gone in two weeks and one, I would have gotten a ring.

02:47:41.140 --> 02:47:43.140
Well, you know what?

02:47:43.140 --> 02:47:45.140
There's always next year?

02:47:45.140 --> 02:47:48.140
At Dragon Con, I'll get you some onion rings.

02:47:48.140 --> 02:47:49.140
How's that sound?

02:47:49.140 --> 02:47:51.140
From the varsity.

02:47:51.140 --> 02:47:56.140
They should understand that they should launch the puppy out of the cannon for a puppy bowl.

02:47:56.140 --> 02:47:57.140
No.

02:47:57.140 --> 02:47:58.140
Half time.

02:47:58.140 --> 02:47:59.140
I'm letting you go, Bobby.

02:47:59.140 --> 02:48:00.140
Take care.

02:48:00.140 --> 02:48:01.140
All right.

02:48:01.140 --> 02:48:02.140
Maybe a ferret instead.

02:48:02.140 --> 02:48:05.140
One eight seven seven game.

02:48:05.140 --> 02:48:07.140
All our user name on Skype is orange launch radio.

02:48:07.140 --> 02:48:10.140
Bobby was a little bit longer than we usually have the calls, but he's Bobby.

02:48:10.140 --> 02:48:12.140
He can do that.

02:48:12.140 --> 02:48:13.140
Anyhow.

02:48:13.140 --> 02:48:15.140
Also, we got Twitter topics coming in.

02:48:15.140 --> 02:48:17.140
Twitter dot com slash O L R.

02:48:17.140 --> 02:48:20.140
And we can read some of those topics here.

02:48:23.140 --> 02:48:24.140
Let's see.

02:48:24.140 --> 02:48:25.140
Oh, no.

02:48:25.140 --> 02:48:26.140
We got more calls coming in.

02:48:26.140 --> 02:48:27.140
Never mind.

02:48:27.140 --> 02:48:28.140
Let's take the calls instead.

02:48:28.140 --> 02:48:29.140
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:48:29.140 --> 02:48:30.140
Who's this?

02:48:32.140 --> 02:48:33.140
Hello.

02:48:33.140 --> 02:48:34.140
It's Code Man.

02:48:34.140 --> 02:48:36.140
Down for maintenance podcast.

02:48:36.140 --> 02:48:37.140
How you doing?

02:48:37.140 --> 02:48:38.140
Code Man from Down for maintenance podcast.

02:48:38.140 --> 02:48:40.140
How you guys doing?

02:48:40.140 --> 02:48:41.140
You know.

02:48:41.140 --> 02:48:42.140
All right.

02:48:42.140 --> 02:48:43.140
Great football news today.

02:48:43.140 --> 02:48:45.140
But, you know, I like your picture.

02:48:45.140 --> 02:48:46.140
It's very army.

02:48:46.140 --> 02:48:48.140
Yeah, that's my tattoo.

02:48:48.140 --> 02:48:50.140
What does your tattoo say?

02:48:50.140 --> 02:48:54.140
I know you didn't call in to talk about that, but I'm asking anyway.

02:48:54.140 --> 02:48:56.140
Whatever our souls are made of.

02:48:56.140 --> 02:48:57.140
Hers and mine are the same.

02:48:57.140 --> 02:49:00.140
It's for me and my wife.

02:49:00.140 --> 02:49:01.140
Adorable.

02:49:01.140 --> 02:49:02.140
Oh, wow.

02:49:02.140 --> 02:49:03.140
Jeez.

02:49:03.140 --> 02:49:07.140
Well, after the Bobby call and then now this little aw, I kind of feel down.

02:49:07.140 --> 02:49:08.140
But that was good.

02:49:08.140 --> 02:49:09.140
Thank you.

02:49:09.140 --> 02:49:10.140
I appreciate that.

02:49:10.140 --> 02:49:11.140
Well, we cheered Bobby up.

02:49:11.140 --> 02:49:13.140
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:49:13.140 --> 02:49:18.140
Well, you know, that call, it kind of made me think of, you know, I live in Oklahoma.

02:49:18.140 --> 02:49:26.140
Our team, our sports ball team, our college team didn't do very well this year either.

02:49:26.140 --> 02:49:30.140
But we usually do, you know, pretty well.

02:49:30.140 --> 02:49:35.140
We just didn't show up to any of the games mentally, I guess you would say.

02:49:35.140 --> 02:49:36.140
Look on the bright side.

02:49:36.140 --> 02:49:39.140
Your college team, at least their girlfriends are real.

02:49:39.140 --> 02:49:40.140
True.

02:49:40.140 --> 02:49:41.140
There you go.

02:49:41.140 --> 02:49:42.140
Right.

02:49:42.140 --> 02:49:43.140
Yeah.

02:49:43.140 --> 02:49:46.140
No, I just wanted to call and say hi to you guys.

02:49:46.140 --> 02:49:51.140
And, you know, I this is actually I'm actually getting a chance to call you guys.

02:49:51.140 --> 02:49:55.140
The baby is asleep and I'm actually getting a chance to call in.

02:49:55.140 --> 02:49:57.140
So I'm excited about that.

02:49:57.140 --> 02:50:01.140
Well, I'll bring this up because I'm looking through the Twitter topics for tonight.

02:50:01.140 --> 02:50:03.140
And I noticed you sent us a tweet.

02:50:03.140 --> 02:50:07.140
And after show this to people in studio, you tweeted me with a power glove.

02:50:07.140 --> 02:50:09.140
Ah, it's so bad.

02:50:09.140 --> 02:50:11.140
You actually tweeted us a picture of yourself.

02:50:11.140 --> 02:50:15.140
I'm showing the others in studio there a picture of you holding the power glove.

02:50:15.140 --> 02:50:17.140
And I like this little artsy pose you're doing with it, too.

02:50:17.140 --> 02:50:21.140
It's very like I really like your scarf.

02:50:21.140 --> 02:50:22.140
Yeah.

02:50:22.140 --> 02:50:23.140
Thank you.

02:50:23.140 --> 02:50:24.140
You got a scarf.

02:50:24.140 --> 02:50:27.140
It's very hipster, but not in a douchebag way.

02:50:27.140 --> 02:50:28.140
I like it.

02:50:28.140 --> 02:50:32.140
Well, that was actually that was a very that was a very drunken night.

02:50:32.140 --> 02:50:36.140
I don't like to talk about it, but oh, I see.

02:50:36.140 --> 02:50:38.140
No, I was over at a friend's house and he had a power glove.

02:50:38.140 --> 02:50:42.140
He just had it up on display because I think that's pretty much all you can really do with it.

02:50:42.140 --> 02:50:46.140
And we took it down and started taking a whole bunch of pictures.

02:50:46.140 --> 02:50:50.140
And I actually took a picture punching him in the face with it, too.

02:50:50.140 --> 02:50:52.140
So that was that was pretty funny.

02:50:52.140 --> 02:50:54.140
Well, they call it a power glove for a reason.

02:50:54.140 --> 02:50:56.140
So obviously, yeah.

02:50:56.140 --> 02:50:58.140
No, I I listen to you guys show.

02:50:58.140 --> 02:51:07.140
And I I just oh, just, you know, like like John on on our podcast, he's from he's from California as well.

02:51:07.140 --> 02:51:14.140
And it just makes me just so sad at all the stuff that you guys can do in California and I can't do here in Oklahoma.

02:51:14.140 --> 02:51:16.140
And it makes me it just makes me sad.

02:51:16.140 --> 02:51:18.140
Well, however, you have Waffle House, right?

02:51:18.140 --> 02:51:25.140
We do have Waffle House, although you don't really want to go in there most of the time because some of the plates are a little a little dirty.

02:51:25.140 --> 02:51:29.140
But you have Waffle House and you should be glad for that fact because we don't have Waffle House and we never will.

02:51:29.140 --> 02:51:36.140
And I was going to say Oklahoma at least has Dunkin Donuts and we're not getting those until apparently 2015 is announced this week.

02:51:36.140 --> 02:51:38.140
But at least we're finally going to get them in SoCal.

02:51:38.140 --> 02:51:40.140
I miss Waffle House, Rob.

02:51:40.140 --> 02:51:41.140
Wow.

02:51:41.140 --> 02:51:42.140
Good.

02:51:42.140 --> 02:51:43.140
I want no. Yes, it is.

02:51:43.140 --> 02:51:45.140
I want my chocolate chip pancakes extra crispy.

02:51:45.140 --> 02:51:46.140
Thank you.

02:51:46.140 --> 02:51:48.140
Those are good. Those are very good.

02:51:48.140 --> 02:51:50.140
What are you allowing the fact that we don't have Dunkin Donuts here?

02:51:50.140 --> 02:51:51.140
Yeah.

02:51:51.140 --> 02:51:53.140
I figured you probably would.

02:51:53.140 --> 02:51:54.140
No, no.

02:51:54.140 --> 02:52:00.140
It's the it is like the number one thing when I tell people on the East Coast, like, you know, because I'll go out to visit.

02:52:00.140 --> 02:52:02.140
I'll go to New York or even when I was at PAX.

02:52:02.140 --> 02:52:03.140
I'm like, fuck, yes.

02:52:03.140 --> 02:52:04.140
We've got to go to Dunkin Donuts.

02:52:04.140 --> 02:52:06.140
Oh, my God. I haven't had Dunkin Donuts in forever. We got to go.

02:52:06.140 --> 02:52:08.140
And like my friends are like, the fuck?

02:52:08.140 --> 02:52:10.140
Like, really? I'm like, no, you don't understand.

02:52:10.140 --> 02:52:11.140
I live in California.

02:52:11.140 --> 02:52:12.140
I don't have Dunkin Donuts.

02:52:12.140 --> 02:52:14.140
And they're like, where the fuck do you get donuts?

02:52:14.140 --> 02:52:17.140
I made tiara drive me to Dunkin Donuts in Las Vegas.

02:52:17.140 --> 02:52:18.140
Yeah. I mean, they don't.

02:52:18.140 --> 02:52:22.140
It's it's Mon Pop stores or if you can find a Krispy Kreme that didn't go under.

02:52:22.140 --> 02:52:23.140
That's it.

02:52:23.140 --> 02:52:24.140
Wow.

02:52:24.140 --> 02:52:25.140
Krispy Kreme.

02:52:25.140 --> 02:52:26.140
Krispy Kreme.

02:52:26.140 --> 02:52:29.140
Yeah. Krispy Kreme is few and far between in Oklahoma.

02:52:29.140 --> 02:52:32.140
There's a couple of them around where I live.

02:52:32.140 --> 02:52:35.140
But yeah, they're they're pretty hard to find.

02:52:35.140 --> 02:52:38.140
Krispy Kreme in Alabama is like Starbucks.

02:52:38.140 --> 02:52:43.140
Yeah, that's what we have here. Starbucks everywhere.

02:52:43.140 --> 02:52:44.140
Krispy Kreme.

02:52:44.140 --> 02:52:46.140
Well, trying to bring it back to video games a little bit.

02:52:46.140 --> 02:52:50.140
I know you have been playing a little more Forza Horizon lately as well.

02:52:50.140 --> 02:52:52.140
I know that's something you were talking about on Down for Maintenance.

02:52:52.140 --> 02:52:54.140
So what are your thoughts on Forza?

02:52:54.140 --> 02:52:55.140
I love it.

02:52:55.140 --> 02:52:58.140
And I'll tell you the reason why I love it.

02:52:58.140 --> 02:53:00.140
And I've mentioned this on my podcast.

02:53:00.140 --> 02:53:04.140
I said, you know, I I think the last.

02:53:04.140 --> 02:53:06.140
Oh, my dryer just went off.

02:53:06.140 --> 02:53:15.140
The last the last racing game I played was like Cruising USA and like Bowling Alley arcade.

02:53:15.140 --> 02:53:20.140
And so and so it brings I don't know, it kind of brings me back to that kind of racing.

02:53:20.140 --> 02:53:22.140
It's very arcadey. And I like that about it.

02:53:22.140 --> 02:53:31.140
And and the fact that you can you can race against people in your car club and then and then you can have your car club race against other people.

02:53:31.140 --> 02:53:33.140
And I think that's a really, really neat concept.

02:53:33.140 --> 02:53:35.140
Of course, they could have had that before.

02:53:35.140 --> 02:53:40.140
And I just never discovered racing games on, you know, these kinds of consoles.

02:53:40.140 --> 02:53:42.140
But I don't know. It's a really fun game.

02:53:42.140 --> 02:53:48.140
Although I really, really want to race somebody in the car club and I haven't raced them yet.

02:53:48.140 --> 02:53:51.140
Well, we're going to try to set a date and time for either this week or next.

02:53:51.140 --> 02:53:55.140
We'll we'll tweet about it. We need everybody possible to come join in on the fun.

02:53:55.140 --> 02:53:59.140
So look out for that, including Loki. Yes.

02:53:59.140 --> 02:54:03.140
Well, Loki, he's all over it. He's been on that thing like white on rice, man.

02:54:03.140 --> 02:54:06.140
It's crazy. Absolutely. Absolutely.

02:54:06.140 --> 02:54:08.140
I kind of took a break to make more details.

02:54:08.140 --> 02:54:12.140
In fact, I'm making a spoiler, a sticker for the back of my car.

02:54:12.140 --> 02:54:16.140
The back of my car is this. How are you? How am I driving? One eight seven seven game.

02:54:18.140 --> 02:54:21.140
It's advertisement. Yeah, it's all over the car.

02:54:21.140 --> 02:54:24.140
You are so dumb, but I love it. All right.

02:54:24.140 --> 02:54:30.140
Code man, tell the folks how they can tune into your podcast, which you you do Google Hangouts and stuff now, too.

02:54:30.140 --> 02:54:32.140
Right. You guys. Yeah. You're playing with your format.

02:54:32.140 --> 02:54:35.140
Are you going to you're going to switch to video or what?

02:54:35.140 --> 02:54:38.140
We kind of do it back and forth every once in a while.

02:54:38.140 --> 02:54:41.140
We just kind of dabble in audio and video.

02:54:41.140 --> 02:54:47.140
But yeah, you can find us on YouTube at YouTube dot com backslash the DFM podcast.

02:54:47.140 --> 02:54:50.140
And you can follow us on Twitter at the DFM podcast.

02:54:50.140 --> 02:54:55.140
Then, of course, you can find us on iTunes at the DFM.

02:54:55.140 --> 02:55:00.140
Just look search for the DFM or the down for maintenance podcast.

02:55:00.140 --> 02:55:02.140
And yeah, we should be on there.

02:55:02.140 --> 02:55:08.140
We're we're on our eighth episode, actually, the next episode, which you dark soccer are going to guest on.

02:55:08.140 --> 02:55:12.140
Yes. If you if you remember, I haven't sent you a reminder.

02:55:12.140 --> 02:55:17.140
So I don't know. I put it on my phone. So I've got everything.

02:55:17.140 --> 02:55:20.140
I have an alarm going off. That's what you've got to be is in the phone.

02:55:20.140 --> 02:55:26.140
I've made new plans that kind of stat because, you know, I wanted to get all three of you guys on all at once.

02:55:26.140 --> 02:55:33.140
But I you know, I knew that, you know, with with all kinds of different, you know, time schedules and stuff like that, I probably couldn't manage that.

02:55:33.140 --> 02:55:37.140
So, you know, we will have all three of you on now. So that's awesome.

02:55:37.140 --> 02:55:42.140
Well, thank you very much for having us on and expertly plugged. Appreciate it. Best of luck with your show.

02:55:42.140 --> 02:55:48.140
Thank you very much, Rob. Tell the guys over there. I said hi at your next show. We will. All right. Take care, buddy.

02:55:48.140 --> 02:55:50.140
See ya. See ya.

02:55:50.140 --> 02:55:53.140
Whoa. We can squeeze in one more call. One eight seven seven game.

02:55:53.140 --> 02:55:56.140
O.L.R. or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio. All one word.

02:55:56.140 --> 02:56:00.140
Going to some more Twitter topics. SGA 100 Max sending us a couple tweets.

02:56:00.140 --> 02:56:05.140
A pinball arcade museum in L.A. that is run by just one woman.

02:56:05.140 --> 02:56:10.140
How have I not heard of this place? It's in L.A. I could go there on my way to Disneyland someday.

02:56:10.140 --> 02:56:15.140
I'm trying to bring up the link right now. It is on a place called Arcade Heroes.

02:56:15.140 --> 02:56:19.140
Let's see. It is in the L.A. area. It's called Pins and Needles.

02:56:19.140 --> 02:56:24.140
I love it. This place looks awesome. I'm going to do more research on that.

02:56:24.140 --> 02:56:29.140
You can check that out at arcadeheroes.com. That's the link that SSJ100 Matt just sent us.

02:56:29.140 --> 02:56:33.140
That would be a great name for a store that sells jukeboxes and pinball machines.

02:56:33.140 --> 02:56:37.140
Yeah. Let's see. Something he saw at Magfest.

02:56:37.140 --> 02:56:42.140
An original Atari 2600 game with the classic cartridge box and manual.

02:56:42.140 --> 02:56:48.140
CGE Adventures. It is amazing how people are still making stuff for the Atari 2600 even today.

02:56:48.140 --> 02:56:55.140
You can get all kinds of repros of stuff that were prototypes. Repro prototypes.

02:56:55.140 --> 02:56:57.140
That's how we have a millipede for 5200.

02:56:57.140 --> 02:57:06.140
Even some of those flashback consoles had some of the design challenge winners.

02:57:07.140 --> 02:57:14.140
Funny enough, I remember Bobby earlier was talking about Howard Scott Warshaw at the Expo in Philly.

02:57:14.140 --> 02:57:19.140
Saboteur, his last game, I think, was one of those games that showed up in a flashback console at some point.

02:57:19.140 --> 02:57:24.140
It's kind of interesting. You do still see those show up in one place or another.

02:57:24.140 --> 02:57:28.140
Again, 1877 Game O.L.R. or a username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.

02:57:28.140 --> 02:57:35.140
Tiger Koa sending us some tweets. More League of Legends players banned for toxic behavior.

02:57:35.140 --> 02:57:40.140
Apparently League of Legends is not going to put up with that shit anymore where people are harassing other people.

02:57:40.140 --> 02:57:46.140
Banned two prominent esports players for their toxic behavior in game.

02:57:46.140 --> 02:57:54.140
The peak harassment score placed the account among the worst .06 of all European accounts this month.

02:57:54.140 --> 02:57:57.140
That was InVision's account. He was banned.

02:57:57.140 --> 02:58:00.140
You know what? Good for them.

02:58:00.140 --> 02:58:03.140
Be accountable for your attitude in games.

02:58:03.140 --> 02:58:07.140
People want to be so anonymous. I've been doing a lot of PVP and WoW this week.

02:58:07.140 --> 02:58:10.140
I'll talk about this on Hoard House. Plug plug later.

02:58:10.140 --> 02:58:14.140
Just some toxic fucking attitudes in these games that ruin it for everybody.

02:58:14.140 --> 02:58:20.140
I'm really glad to hear that League of Legends has taken some drastic moves to eliminate that shit.

02:58:22.140 --> 02:58:25.140
Also a tweet from Tiger Koa saying,

02:58:25.140 --> 02:58:29.140
Games destigmatize violence, says a Connecticut governor.

02:58:29.140 --> 02:58:31.140
Well, that's probably all that needs to be said about that.

02:58:31.140 --> 02:58:34.140
Another politician putting their big ass foot in the conversation.

02:58:36.140 --> 02:58:39.140
Lastly here, Raw Steel UT.

02:58:39.140 --> 02:58:44.140
In light of how the media readily brought Manti Teo's dead girlfriend story,

02:58:44.140 --> 02:58:47.140
have any of you been fooled by fake stories?

02:58:47.140 --> 02:58:49.140
Oh, I'm sure we have here on OLR.

02:58:49.140 --> 02:58:53.140
I mean, it happens. There'll be an article that spreads like wildfire.

02:58:53.140 --> 02:58:56.140
We don't like to think we're breaking the news.

02:58:56.140 --> 02:59:00.140
Once in a while we get a little tip, but we try not to make a big deal out of it.

02:59:00.140 --> 02:59:03.140
Sometimes we talk about a game called Disney Infinity.

02:59:03.140 --> 02:59:07.140
It's a hidden secret for our listeners, and that's the way we want it to be.

02:59:07.140 --> 02:59:13.140
We learned the hard way many years ago that sometimes you don't necessarily want things to blow up out of proportion.

02:59:13.140 --> 02:59:16.140
You don't have to be the guy that gets credited for breaking the news.

02:59:16.140 --> 02:59:18.140
No one remembers it anyway.

02:59:18.140 --> 02:59:20.140
Exactly. No one remembers it in this day and age anyway.

02:59:20.140 --> 02:59:24.140
But yes, I'm sure in the history of this show we've been fooled by fake stories.

02:59:24.140 --> 02:59:26.140
Unfortunately, none are coming to mind.

02:59:28.140 --> 02:59:35.140
Hey, I'm sure back in the day when we were all younger, I'm sure some of us fell for the old EGM magazine pranks

02:59:35.140 --> 02:59:38.140
like that Shang Long was actually a character in Street Fighter.

02:59:38.140 --> 02:59:39.140
Nope.

02:59:39.140 --> 02:59:40.140
Or Ermac was actually in Mortal Kombat.

02:59:40.140 --> 02:59:41.140
No.

02:59:41.140 --> 02:59:42.140
Oh, sure. Say that now.

02:59:42.140 --> 02:59:47.140
Well, I also worked in an arcade for a while too and could actually check some of these machines myself.

02:59:47.140 --> 02:59:52.140
So you knew at that age how to go into the chips and actually look in the programming?

02:59:52.140 --> 02:59:53.140
Yep, I totally knew that.

02:59:53.140 --> 02:59:58.140
No, Rob, what I knew is that usually on April 1st there are going to be pranks done.

02:59:58.140 --> 03:00:00.140
I don't believe a damn thing on April 1st.

03:00:00.140 --> 03:00:01.140
But they were in magazines.

03:00:01.140 --> 03:00:02.140
Or in April Editions.

03:00:02.140 --> 03:00:03.140
And we were younger.

03:00:03.140 --> 03:00:05.140
But they were the April Editions.

03:00:05.140 --> 03:00:07.140
Yeah, but Rob, I'm special.

03:00:07.140 --> 03:00:08.140
You guys are no fun at all.

03:00:08.140 --> 03:00:09.140
I'm special.

03:00:10.140 --> 03:00:14.140
No fun zone, everybody. That's why nobody's calling in. They know it's a no fun zone.

03:00:14.140 --> 03:00:18.140
All right. Last minute stories, Loki. Anything?

03:00:18.140 --> 03:00:25.140
Blockposter UK has closed 160 of its stores because they're in administration right now.

03:00:25.140 --> 03:00:31.140
Kind of a repeat of what they did over here in US.

03:00:31.140 --> 03:00:35.140
There's a pretty cool THQ sale going on right now on Amazon.

03:00:35.140 --> 03:00:39.140
You can get a bunch of games for 25 bucks. 19 games.

03:00:39.140 --> 03:00:45.140
Most of which you probably have by now through the Humble Bundle or all the other Amazon sales that they've done.

03:00:46.140 --> 03:00:47.140
I know I have a lot of these games.

03:00:47.140 --> 03:00:49.140
Actually, I think I have all these games right now.

03:00:49.140 --> 03:00:53.140
Except for Nexuiz. I don't have Nexuiz.

03:00:53.140 --> 03:00:55.140
But I'm not buying this for that.

03:00:55.140 --> 03:00:58.140
MX vs ATV reflex. I don't have that either.

03:01:05.140 --> 03:01:06.140
What else?

03:01:06.140 --> 03:01:09.140
Oh, Starbreeze. I guess they have a new game coming out called Storm.

03:01:09.140 --> 03:01:12.140
I haven't released anything other than that.

03:01:12.140 --> 03:01:15.140
But apparently they have an image teasing it.

03:01:15.140 --> 03:01:17.140
I guess we'll hear more about that during E3.

03:01:17.140 --> 03:01:19.140
Hopefully it's better than Syndicate.

03:01:19.140 --> 03:01:20.140
If not sooner.

03:01:24.140 --> 03:01:25.140
That is it.

03:01:25.140 --> 03:01:26.140
That's it.

03:01:26.140 --> 03:01:32.140
Well, I guess that's going to do it for OLR tonight.

03:01:32.140 --> 03:01:33.140
No more calls coming in.

03:01:33.140 --> 03:01:34.140
That's all right.

03:01:34.140 --> 03:01:38.140
Everybody's too depressed about football. I get it. It's cool.

03:01:38.140 --> 03:01:40.140
Oh, and the killer is dead is pretty awesome looking.

03:01:41.140 --> 03:01:44.140
Which I mentioned about a year ago.

03:01:44.140 --> 03:01:48.140
But it's the new Suda51 game.

03:01:48.140 --> 03:01:52.140
And it kind of has that whole Killer7 vibe to it.

03:01:52.140 --> 03:01:54.140
Where it's all kind of salty and stuff.

03:01:54.140 --> 03:01:55.140
But very bloody.

03:01:55.140 --> 03:01:59.140
I remember with some of the games that they did after Killer7.

03:01:59.140 --> 03:02:00.140
It was kind of toned down.

03:02:00.140 --> 03:02:05.140
They had the whole No More Heroes had money spewing out of them instead of blood.

03:02:05.140 --> 03:02:06.140
Well, this is definitely blood.

03:02:06.140 --> 03:02:09.140
Lots of blood and a guy with a big drill on his arm.

03:02:10.140 --> 03:02:12.140
That sounds like my kind of game.

03:02:12.140 --> 03:02:13.140
He's Mr. Driller now.

03:02:13.140 --> 03:02:15.140
Mr. Driller.

03:02:15.140 --> 03:02:16.140
All right.

03:02:16.140 --> 03:02:18.140
Well, that brings us to a close.

03:02:18.140 --> 03:02:19.140
Another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:02:19.140 --> 03:02:23.140
But not until we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

03:02:23.140 --> 03:02:27.140
First off, of course, we always like to say thank you for downloading and checking out our show.

03:02:27.140 --> 03:02:29.140
It is a free show.

03:02:29.140 --> 03:02:32.140
We haven't played a commercial for the same game 20 weeks in a row.

03:02:32.140 --> 03:02:36.140
We pay a little bit out of pocket because it's our hobby.

03:02:36.140 --> 03:02:37.140
Whatever.

03:02:37.140 --> 03:02:40.140
And actually, I've got to say, I do want to tip my hat.

03:02:40.140 --> 03:02:43.140
People have been very kind in a pay it forward kind of way.

03:02:43.140 --> 03:02:46.140
We're like, you know, we've just had some nice things donated like Brad from Pod Culture.

03:02:46.140 --> 03:02:49.140
All these mics you see are we're donated.

03:02:49.140 --> 03:02:54.140
And we do get, you know, like Grandpa from Hoard House gave a lot of money to Vogue on our anniversary.

03:02:54.140 --> 03:02:56.140
Helped Kristen years ago.

03:02:56.140 --> 03:02:57.140
It helped out a big way.

03:02:57.140 --> 03:02:58.140
The soundboard.

03:02:58.140 --> 03:03:00.140
That's how we got to PAX.

03:03:00.140 --> 03:03:04.140
So, you know, pay it forward is kind of the motto here.

03:03:04.140 --> 03:03:07.140
Not to, you know, bring up a cheesy movie from years ago.

03:03:07.140 --> 03:03:10.140
But if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, just spread the word.

03:03:10.140 --> 03:03:13.140
Tell a friend or two about the show and help us spread the word about the show.

03:03:13.140 --> 03:03:14.140
And that's all we ask.

03:03:14.140 --> 03:03:16.140
Thank you to everyone who bought me games.

03:03:16.140 --> 03:03:18.140
And thank you to everybody who listened tonight.

03:03:18.140 --> 03:03:20.140
Whether it be live or on the podcast.

03:03:20.140 --> 03:03:22.140
You guys rock.

03:03:22.140 --> 03:03:24.140
Thank you, Greg Proops.

03:03:24.140 --> 03:03:27.140
And I still have steam games to give away at some point.

03:03:27.140 --> 03:03:30.140
Haven't figured out how to do that yet.

03:03:30.140 --> 03:03:32.140
And also, somewhere buried over there.

03:03:32.140 --> 03:03:33.140
I think I see it.

03:03:33.140 --> 03:03:36.140
We still have the Megaran album to give away for something.

03:03:36.140 --> 03:03:38.140
Yeah, we need to just do like a big closeout around here.

03:03:38.140 --> 03:03:41.140
Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

03:03:41.140 --> 03:03:43.140
Jamie, you shut off the iPad.

03:03:43.140 --> 03:03:44.140
You're good to go.

03:03:44.140 --> 03:03:45.140
What's your final thought tonight?

03:03:45.140 --> 03:03:48.140
It's hard to do a show on the iPad.

03:03:48.140 --> 03:03:50.140
Loki, your final thought tonight?

03:03:50.140 --> 03:03:53.140
I have a new CD of music to listen to.

03:03:53.140 --> 03:03:56.140
Thanks for, was it, all the inspiration.

03:03:56.140 --> 03:04:03.140
I guess Dubstep Arena channel on Forza Horizon.

03:04:03.140 --> 03:04:05.140
Although, it's not really, most of it's not really Dubstep.

03:04:05.140 --> 03:04:08.140
It's like just electronica.

03:04:08.140 --> 03:04:12.140
My final thought for the night is why can Horde never win Isle of Conquest?

03:04:12.140 --> 03:04:13.140
Stop being terrible, Horde.

03:04:13.140 --> 03:04:14.140
I hate you.

03:04:14.140 --> 03:04:17.140
Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

03:04:17.140 --> 03:04:19.140
Thank you guys very much for tuning in and supporting the show.

03:04:19.140 --> 03:04:22.140
We'll be back to do it all again next week.

03:04:22.140 --> 03:04:25.140
So, have a wonderful night and a wonderful week.

03:04:25.140 --> 03:04:26.140
Stay safe.

03:04:56.140 --> 03:04:57.140
All still true.

03:04:57.140 --> 03:04:58.140
See you next week.

03:05:25.140 --> 03:05:26.140
Bye.
