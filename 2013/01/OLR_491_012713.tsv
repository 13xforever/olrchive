13991	24581	Tonight, January 27, 2013, Ruber next Xbox and PlayStation specs leak, Nintendo unveils new games, and the classic gaming company goes bankrupt.
31854	37218	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37318	47526	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this January the 27th, 2013, episode number 491 of our program on this lovely Sunday evening.
47827	58215	My name is Rob Roberts with you all at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOG at Network.com where we do tape our show every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
58795	68601	Video games, gaming culture, and gaming lols are my co-hosts, first off, the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
84731	89577	But I'm not going to go into any detail about it because she's crazy.
90418	90639	Yeah.
91420	93242	So, but yeah, free.
93916	94556	There you go, freedom.
94576	95637	Happy, happy.
96137	98618	And that same night I had gnocchi, so it was awesome.
99178	103319	I'm reminded of that scene from Braveheart, even though I can't stand Val Gibson, but you know, freedom!
103439	104359	You know, forget it.
105000	109501	Anyhow, I'll also say hello to the free tech master, Loki.
109801	110141	Hello.
110301	111302	Terrible transition, I know.
111322	111882	How are you, Loki?
112522	113122	I'm doing fine.
113302	114983	And what won the dinner lottery for tonight?
115623	118084	Ultimate cheeseburger from Jack in the Box.
118644	120245	Healthy as always, huh?
120465	120906	I was hungry.
120966	122727	I didn't eat anything all day, so, you know.
123407	127510	Alright, our chatroom is open and welcoming your live comments.
127690	137536	Live.VogNetwork.com Where Breakman, in our chatroom, starts off tonight saying, Quitting a job is one of the greatest experiences anyone can have.
138097	140198	Was it like that scene from, what movie was that?
140218	141479	Was that Half Baked or something?
141499	147683	Where the guy's working at a fast food restaurant and he goes, Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool, I'm out.
147703	147803	Yeah.
148789	150530	I haven't seen Half Baked and I need to.
151871	157894	You need to make like a list, you know, for your, because is Monday going to be your first full day off?
157934	158915	Did you quit Friday or Thursday?
158935	159635	I quit Thursday.
159735	160616	She's paying me for Friday.
160976	161216	Okay.
161476	166439	And which I got, I saved, I actually saved a photo of the text message.
167079	168700	So if she doesn't, I can nail her.
168760	175784	Well, I was going to say, on Monday, you should have a like unemployment marathon and you can watch like, you know, Falling Down with Michael Douglas.
176184	177385	You can watch, you know.
177745	178325	You know what?
178345	179046	Half-baked?
179086	179907	Was that waiting?
180247	181968	On Monday... Waiting, that would be a good one, too.
182268	186831	On Monday, though, I have an appointment in the morning and a job interview.
187231	187351	Oh.
188332	200740	So, it was sort of like... And it's funny, okay, I'll talk about this later, but I got a cat, and I thought I could go pick her up a little bit early, and then I ended up forgetting the paperwork at home, so I had to turn back around.
201160	205743	The moment I started unlocking my door, I got a call about the other job, so...
206644	207525	Well, let's talk about that.
207565	210946	I did want to start off, you know, before we get into how was our gaming week.
211346	213588	We have some personal life updates we wanted to get out there.
214028	218630	And so, yes, let's talk about DarkSakura, mommy once again for a new kitty, right?
218890	220011	Yes, I have a new cat.
220451	221191	Her name is Midna.
222072	225654	I almost named her Eri, but Midna seems to fit her better.
225694	226434	She's very impish.
226734	228495	And there's people that might not catch the reference.
228815	231357	It's from Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess.
231497	231817	There you go.
232105	239471	It's funny, the other day I was like, so our little princess is perched on the couch and Dan's like, yeah, Twilight Princess.
240853	241473	It was pretty funny.
242494	246758	She's about eight months old, maybe a little older, I don't know, but she's tiny.
246818	251502	She's still tiny and very lithe and has lime green eyes and she's all black.
251982	257847	Actually, I thought she was all completely black, but she has like a few little white hairs scattered across her chest.
258107	259028	Oh, that sounds like Maruko.
259328	259689	Yeah.
259969	261090	But she's really short for it.
261190	261811	She's short for it.
262211	263932	But she does walk with her tail in the air like he did.
265394	266555	Okay.
266795	271880	She's not really, I'd say, she doesn't press about, you know, but she does jump around a lot.
272380	274702	And she adopted one of Shermie's toys as hers.
275683	278806	So I was like, well, Shermie loved it, so I'm glad the new kitty loves it.
278966	279126	Mm-hmm.
279887	281888	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
302233	303233	Like, hear mother play.
304354	305014	So I was like, okay.
305134	306034	She does this all the time.
306654	310195	And then like when I'm done playing, she'll just pick it up and carry it off in the corner and start licking it.
311076	314777	And she hasn't had any accidents.
314817	319618	Normally, in my experience with a kitten, they have like a couple little poopy or pee-pee accidents.
320058	320678	Not a single one.
321398	322799	She knows where her box is.
323639	324220	Good kitty.
324420	325341	Yeah, she's a good baby.
325922	328245	And she's just smart and she's cuddly.
328946	332590	But because she's still kind of a kitten, she loses attention really quickly.
333091	334393	She's like, okay, I'm done cuddling play.
335226	343089	Tiger Claw, our resident internet research expert at live.vognetwork.com found the picture that you'd posted on Twitter this week apparently.
343129	344550	Yeah, the one picture I did on Twitter.
344630	346430	All the chatters are now going, duh.
346790	348731	But I think I got it uploaded.
348771	358655	If you go to my Tumblr, which is Kuro Tsubasa, K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A, whatever Tsubasa is spelled like.
359515	361116	You don't even know how to spell your own damn name?
361136	368140	T-S-U-B-A-S-A Maybe you need a less complicated name like JaneShepard2.tumblr.com or something.
368260	374965	It's K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A.tumblr.com Maybe that's too much.
375345	375485	No.
377385	383189	Um, but, uh, she's, uh, I have a picture of a video of her playing on my Tumblr.
383549	387812	I just, I tried to upload it from my phone and Brad, I don't care if you don't like cats, you don't have to live with her.
387872	388832	She's my cat, not yours.
390919	391900	But she's adorable.
392040	392760	She's sweet.
392880	393880	Dogs can be cute, too.
394340	394720	Not really.
394821	395581	Especially corgis.
395641	396121	They stink.
396521	398422	Especially corgis.
398542	402203	I met a corgi at PetSmart when I was buying stuff for Midna.
402363	403023	Were you tempted?
403843	404044	No.
404084	404624	Were you tempted almost?
404744	408925	Because I found out firsthand now that I'm actually the same type of allergic to corgis I am to other dogs.
409105	410106	Oh, tragedy.
410486	410726	Yeah.
411646	414567	I keep telling Alan, when we get a house someday, it's going to be Corgi Village.
414847	415788	Yes, Breakman.
416129	420754	My cat is all black, but she's got just like a few scattering white furs on her chest.
421134	422235	Like DarkSakura's heart.
423136	423437	Yeah.
424758	426119	My heart is black with white fur.
427241	427501	All right.
427541	429023	Anyhow, anything else before we move on to...
430698	432179	She's just funny to watch explore.
432219	432960	She's really cute.
434020	435141	I love my new kitty.
435641	437622	But I still get a little nostalgic for Shermie.
438022	444826	I almost picked up Shermie's mousy to give to the new kitten and I was like, I can't do it.
445166	449087	Well, AkumaJP in our chat room has a theory saying, you know, cats do come back.
449327	450007	Cats do come back.
450787	451207	You never know.
451487	453307	But this cat was alive before Shermie died.
453588	455668	Because I've got her shot records from September.
456228	456728	You never know.
457408	460049	Well, she just doesn't act at all like Shermie did.
460649	462409	She's completely different than Shermie.
462469	464689	I mean, she's cuddly and sweet and everything.
465310	468870	But even, but Shermie was still stupidly neurotic when she was that old.
468970	470370	You don't want to replace it.
470591	471471	Like, you're not trying to replace Shermie.
471491	472571	No, I'm not trying to replace Shermie.
472591	473011	Yeah.
473311	474392	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
499834	505719	Um, but, um, Dan ended up finding her under the liner underneath the couch.
506940	509242	Now, Brad would like to clarify what he said earlier.
509282	512305	He says being deathly allergic might have a bit to do with the hatred.
512405	513626	Well, yeah, I could, I could see that.
513666	516889	Well, I'm like that with dogs, but I love dogs, but I'm stupidly allergic to them.
517089	517830	Yeah.
517890	524115	I mean, it probably the only dog I think I could get away with having would be a pit, a pit or a boxer.
524155	524556	No, thank you.
525336	526377	I'm going to tell you something, Rob.
526738	526938	Hmm.
527378	533341	Pitbulls are actually among the most loyal and sweetest dogs, but they do require a good trainer.
533381	534942	Your sentence didn't contain the word corgi.
535082	537343	Stop caring.
537443	540985	I could have a Yorkie, but Dan was like, they're not real dogs.
542346	544967	Can we move on from kitty puppy chat?
545387	549790	I'm sure people who downloaded a video game podcast probably wouldn't mind kitty puppy chat.
549810	551210	We do have to talk video games at some point.
551230	552531	I know, but my cat's awesome.
552691	554152	But I have another personal story real quick.
554212	556933	Okay, so OLR today, like seriously, almost didn't happen.
558133	559974	And it's because we went to Reno this weekend.
560414	561635	Just, it was a random thing.
562075	563855	I've been having cabin fever lately.
564156	568277	You know, the last big trip we took was when, oh, I didn't even go there with Alan.
568297	572959	I went with Victoria, but Disneyland in September was like the last like trip I went outside of the Bay Area.
572979	575120	I don't count Bay Area trips because that's like my second home.
575180	575300	So...
575840	579702	Like, you know, it had been a few months since we'd really gone anywhere, so I was like, let's go somewhere.
579762	584945	Let's go to Chico, my old hometown, or let's go to Reno or something.
584965	587527	So we decided to go to Reno because we looked at the forecast and it was sunny.
587607	589288	Sunny, sunny, sunny, partially cloudy.
589308	591749	We're like, okay, we won't run into any issues.
591910	593150	Sure, it's winter, but it'll be fine.
593170	595512	We'll be able to see some of the snow that's up there and we can go gamble.
596312	599033	So we drove up there, no problem, and had some fun.
599293	602375	And I do want to talk about casinos in a minute, because yes, it does relate to video games.
603135	607237	But then, this morning, oh crap, it snowed overnight.
607297	612720	And apparently, yeah, like at least an inch of snow fell over the mountains, and that means the chain controls were on.
613220	614481	Well, I don't have an SUV.
615001	615881	I don't carry chains.
616221	617302	I don't know how to put on chains.
617762	619282	I don't even think I'm supposed to use chains in my car.
619302	620503	I think I have to use these vinyl things.
620783	623764	Regardless, I don't really want to have to deal with all that fuckery.
623804	624764	So I'm like, great.
625224	626305	I like the word fuckery.
626525	628706	Yeah, you'll hear that word a lot on tonight's show, by the way.
629526	631327	The word of the day is fuckery.
633768	634648	Where fucks are made.
636349	637669	That's where the fuck comes from.
637829	638609	That's a fuckerary.
641019	644543	Anyhow, speaking of fuckerary, we're leaving Reno.
647266	651570	Finally, the snow, I guess, melted around noon because the sun finally came up and the clouds parted.
652131	654774	I was very happy because I did not want to have to miss tonight's show.
654894	660820	More importantly, I did not want to have to miss work tomorrow because stupid me doesn't know how to put chains on a freaking car.
661761	662961	Anyhow, crisis averted.
663222	666482	But the cool thing about being in Reno is that you get to see all the new toys.
666523	670004	And I'll tell you what, they dump a lot of money into casino games.
670084	676746	I don't know how often you guys go into casinos and stuff, but there's a lot of neat technology to try and bring in your money.
678346	689411	You may or may not know this, but a company that we've talked about on this show for a long time, Konami, has a huge game-making business in slot machines.
689771	690912	That's a huge part of their business.
690952	692913	They make a lot of various slot machines.
694373	698675	If you're old enough and you're at the casino, look in the corner of some of the slot machine games.
698695	700216	You'll sometimes see that they're made by Konami.
700516	703557	But what really struck me as interesting is that a lot of the...
705919	709702	Okay, wait, I have to clarify this because the folks in chat are like, really?
710122	710983	An inch of snow?
711163	712784	You were freaking out over an inch of snow?
713124	713545	Hold on.
713605	716367	All right, in my defense, we're in California.
716887	718448	We don't get like snow ever.
718588	719429	Unless you live in Tahoe.
719569	720129	Unless you, yeah.
720270	722852	California does have its very beautiful snowy parts.
724012	725233	I don't live there.
725413	731318	I live in the sacraments where it gets up to 105, or no, my favorite term I heard this week.
735240	740282	I live in Sacra Ghetto, California, and it gets up to like 105 here in the summer.
740362	743504	So yes, the littlest snow will freak me out in our cars.
743644	745564	We don't we don't antifreeze.
745625	747265	What kind of fuckery is antifreeze?
747305	748526	We don't use that shit here.
748886	750527	Like this is just not something we're used to.
750627	752688	So yes, an inch of snow is a big deal.
754029	755270	Thank you, Bobby Blackwolf.
755790	758071	It's not a phrase I say very often on this show.
758311	758951	Oh, no, no, no, no.
758991	759311	Just kidding.
759551	762192	But he says, I understand freaking out over an inch of snow.
762392	763032	I live in Georgia.
763253	764033	I'm from Alabama.
764493	769995	We actually did get snow in Mobile, which is technically a subtropical climate, but everything shuts down and you can't find bread.
770875	773236	SSJ100Matt says, you don't need chains for an inch of snow.
773276	774577	You will be safe in lower gear.
774817	777558	Ah, ah, but is that true going up and down a 5,000-foot mountain?
778018	779018	That's probably the difference.
779719	780719	You're actually fine.
781760	782060	Whatever.
782180	782460	Anyway.
783001	784882	Well, tell the CHP that, okay?
784923	785543	So, anyway.
786744	787785	Back to the casino games.
787805	788826	Just drift, man.
789066	789487	Come on.
789507	791869	The part about gaming.
794080	795361	The part about gaming.
796142	798363	There's some interesting technology in some of these games.
798463	802686	Okay, so don't laugh, but Alan and I were looking at a Sex and the City slot machine.
803146	803967	It was huge.
804027	805428	Shut up.
805488	807349	I saw the picture and I didn't get the reference.
807369	810091	This thing looked like it was like a $100,000 machine.
810131	812352	I mean, it was like super fancy, right?
812753	813453	And we didn't play it.
813493	814334	We didn't give it any money.
814414	820638	But we were looking at it because we're like, this screen is like twice the size of what you see on a Derby's owner club.
821298	825863	and you look at the little... How ironic that you would use that reference to a horse game.
827626	828367	I see what you did there.
828667	828867	All right.
829207	833551	So we're looking at the screen and we look carefully at the little rolls of the slot machine.
833851	834752	It's in 3D.
835312	837133	Like the screens are in 3D.
837694	840416	And I'm like, they're using the same technology in the 3D.
840456	841657	Like no glasses or anything, right?
841717	843938	They're using that glasses-free technology.
843958	844819	Dan's old phone had it.
844959	846921	That you see in the 3DS and all that stuff.
847221	847421	Yeah.
847981	849242	On slot machines now.
850083	851864	Man, her face is really long.
851884	852165	Yeah.
854805	859347	I have to say I'm like the least girly girl ever because I didn't understand the maker of those shoes or whatever.
860007	860847	It's alright, it's alright.
861667	865349	So yeah, there was a 3D game I played later.
865469	870410	It was called, don't laugh, it was called Ladybug Wedding 2.
873331	875392	And I won more money on that machine than I did anything.
875632	876913	Okay, look, Alan and I have a thing.
877093	878553	Alan, Alan, come here.
879494	880594	I need to put you on the spot.
881909	882329	Hi, Alan.
882349	882649	How are you?
882750	883030	What up?
883070	883350	I'm good.
883710	884470	Did you enjoy Reno?
884711	884931	I did.
885191	887852	So I'm talking about some of the technology we saw in the casinos.
887892	890574	Did you find the technology that they use in slot machines fascinating?
891050	917030	Yeah once we passed the big monolith Sex and the City thing to make fun of it I then started noticing those 3D screens on a lot of the other newer machines and it was kind of like how the 3DS is where it's not so much that it pops out but especially like it looks like recessed like you can see like you know an inch like it looks like you're looking inside the screen.
917669	943306	Codeman in our chatroom says I work in the casino business and Konami has a whole separate business for casinos they work closely with Bally they make some amazing pinball machines and Codeman continues those machines are made up have four separate screens on top of each other it was interesting to see them broken down the Ladybug game I was playing had that thing going on but the Sex and the City was like a true 3D but yeah the four screen 3D trick was really cool like it was a neat effect
943906	950651	But, okay, so to justify why I was playing Ladybug Wedding 2, tell the listeners about your strategy when it comes to slot machines.
951051	962299	My friend, Ira, who I've known for several years, he made a comment on the picture post I made on Facebook of the Sex and the City machine, and he's like, I'm dead serious.
962720	971446	Play the gayest, most flamboyant slots you can find, because I played some unicorn magic bullshit in Las Vegas and won $1,100.
971486	971566	Yeah.
973167	974088	I was like, all right.
974488	982313	So I found a unicorn slot and I found two, guess how gay this is, village people themed slot machines.
982533	984134	I was down about 25 bucks.
984254	987016	I made all my money back and ended the night ahead $12.
987076	991299	This motherfucker hit the super jackpot on the village people slot machine.
991319	993581	Yeah, I put in a five and it cashed out like $37.
993701	997023	I was like, I just made all my money back and I'm ahead 12.
997063	999605	Because I thought I just blew 20 bucks.
1000365	1005347	I don't even want to know what kind of fanfare you get with hitting the super jackpot on a Village People machine.
1005367	1008028	Did this like a stage show occur?
1008528	1010809	Ironically, you're trying to avoid the pooper.
1011810	1016492	And yes, on the little bonus stage, you hit these little things.
1016532	1019353	It's a party pooper, but yeah, like a nerd pops up.
1019493	1024215	Because they're doing the disco, and then if you click the wrong record, this nerd's like, what are you guys doing?
1024275	1025295	This music's too loud.
1025315	1026856	And then you end the bonus stage.
1026896	1027496	And he's the pooper.
1027516	1028556	You're trying to avoid the pooper.
1028576	1029577	Did I tell a lie?
1029597	1029737	Yeah.
1031818	1053782	Some of the slot machine themes are like Jungle Prince, Lion King, Fluffy Poodle Deluxe I played Kitty Glitter The amount of times my peripheral vision misread hot slots as hot slots I had to look and go, what?
1053943	1056063	Oh, slots That happened like a dozen times
1057577	1059058	So what was your favorite machine that you played?
1059118	1060339	I'm sorry.
1061500	1063341	Well, the village people, because I won all the money on it.
1063901	1066863	I was actually going to say, I also like seeing the loosest sluts ever.
1068784	1074548	Quickly, the other 3D one I saw you playing, something like Miss Red, which was slutty red riding hood.
1074568	1084734	They have all of these princess sort of things, but they're all like sexed up, like Scarlet Hood, and she's got like a bikini on, and the wolf's all drooly and pervy.
1084754	1085455	Yeah.
1085795	1092377	I played one Red Riding Hood game that I didn't like, and then I played another one that I actually did really well on.
1092497	1099440	I could have, I made like five bucks, and then I was like, all right, I made five, I may as well spin it back down, and I ended up losing it.
1099760	1104162	But that one I really liked, and that had a great 3D screen with a lot of little neat animations on it.
1104342	1105062	I can't believe it.
1105122	1106282	Leave it to the internets.
1106322	1107603	Tiger Claw found a video.
1107663	1110944	Here's Little Ladybug 2, penny slot bonus mode.
1110984	1113365	You don't really see the 3D effect in this thing.
1114145	1116246	That was the game I was playing.
1116326	1117906	I wouldn't know how to do that.
1117986	1120767	Just so you guys know, I'm not making it up.
1120827	1121388	Thank you, Tiger.
1121428	1122808	Okay, I'm giving the mic back to Jamie.
1123148	1123708	Thank you, Alan.
1123808	1125749	I think it's kind of wrong that someone just scored with KKK.
1126929	1128190	King, king, king.
1129523	1129823	Shut up.
1129903	1130484	I'm from Alabama.
1131104	1131524	All right.
1131645	1132125	Wow.
1133546	1134246	No, thank you.
1134426	1134747	All right.
1135807	1136087	Let's see.
1136107	1139450	What else do I want to say about casinos and all that stuff?
1139570	1139890	I don't know.
1140010	1147415	I just think it's interesting that a lot of the stuff we see in like console gaming and all that we see for adult gaming as well.
1148416	1150237	And that a lot of the same companies are involved.
1150397	1151217	I thought it was interesting.
1151638	1152218	Technology.
1152318	1152578	Yay.
1154419	1154700	Really?
1154760	1157441	Loco Poco links to crazy taxi slots.
1158502	1161764	They have slot machines for all sorts of weird things, like the Hangover.
1162064	1163525	The movie has a slot machine.
1164005	1165426	Of course, it was in Vegas.
1166366	1168087	Yeah, I guess, but we were in Reno.
1169068	1175551	Oh, okay, well then they can't have any sort of Nevada gambling-themed slot machines in other parts of Nevada.
1175891	1178012	Oh, this is just the bonus feature in the Dreamcast.
1178032	1182895	I thought this was an actual crazy taxi slot machine, but no, this is just the little bonus feature in the home version.
1183315	1184436	You sneaky little bastard.
1185016	1185136	Anyhow,
1188194	1188735	Let's move on.
1188775	1191439	I guess we can get into some... I love how the chat room's looking for all these slot machines now.
1191599	1191860	I know.
1191900	1193162	Look, I got y'all thinking about gambling.
1193182	1193863	I need pachinko.
1193883	1198049	All right, let's talk about video games and console games and the things we've been playing this week.
1198069	1200312	And then I have some housekeeping for tonight as well that's important.
1200713	1202856	So let's get to our gaming weeks first.
1202896	1204058	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1204560	1205661	My gaming week was kitty.
1206603	1211448	No, actually, I played Mass Effect 2 again because I think I finally mastered Flycam.
1212650	1221781	And if anyone wants to go to MassEffecting.tumblr.com, you can see a bunch of really neat screen grabs I was able to do with the Flycam.
1222642	1222962	And then...
1225339	1230647	I played a game that I'm going to be... Well, I didn't play it for very long.
1231148	1234513	But I played a game called Chompman, which we will be talking about later.
1235675	1236756	And that's really about it.
1237177	1238719	I've had kind of an alarming week.
1240709	1241049	All righty.
1241750	1242010	Loki?
1243471	1244672	I didn't play a whole lot this week.
1244912	1247194	I played actually a little bit of Minecraft last night.
1248155	1255400	I was bored and my wife got into the next series of terrible TV shows that I'm going to have to sit through the entire series of.
1256201	1258783	This new series is Grey's Anatomy.
1259223	1261625	I get to sit through the whole series of Grey's Anatomy.
1261645	1261985	I'm sorry.
1262025	1262185	Run.
1262486	1262846	Run.
1265123	1269686	I'm thinking it's starting to go to my head because I don't think it's actually that bad right now.
1270726	1271587	You are so whipped.
1271867	1273268	No, I'm not watching it.
1273288	1275529	I'm playing Skyrim, okay, with headphones on.
1275629	1279711	So occasionally I'll see Katherine Heigl take off her clothes and stuff.
1279731	1281072	So I'm like, okay, this is not so bad.
1283133	1288457	Yeah, so it's just, you know, it's brief bits of Katherine Heigl.
1288837	1303566	But anyways, so yeah, the other thing I've been playing, Skyrim on PC with all the mods and stuff and kind of retracing my steps I did on the console version since I have, I'm probably going to play through the whole game now on PC because, well, I have more expansions on there.
1303586	1307749	I bought the two expansions out right now and probably will buy Dragonborn when that comes out.
1309930	1312372	I actually bought some more games on Steam today.
1313072	1317155	But ironically, most of my game purchases now are not coming from Steam sales.
1317175	1321217	They're coming from Amazon sales, which all the games redeem on Steam.
1321257	1322118	They had one today.
1322818	1323658	Well, they got to compete.
1324479	1325440	They're doing a good job.
1325460	1328541	PlayStation 3 is doing a similar approach.
1328561	1329582	This whole, what is it, 13 for $13?
1331303	1334364	LittleBigPlanet Karting is $10 right now.
1334504	1335885	I ought to be pissed.
1335945	1337806	I bought that game when it was brand new, like $50.
1338906	1342548	Considering doing that, except we have some free goods that we're sitting on.
1342608	1345529	I'm trying to get them sent to me.
1346210	1347750	I'm trying to do that.
1347770	1349271	They actually have a sale going on right now.
1349411	1352312	It's five game arcade packs.
1353173	1355194	I thought first, oh, Xbox Live Arcade.
1355234	1355774	That's not bad.
1356674	1359735	It's actually Steam games, but they were featured on Xbox Live Arcade.
1359796	1359896	It's
1360996	1365978	Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, Deadlight, Iron Brigade, Mark of the Ninja, and Toy Soldiers for $10.
1367099	1371501	Or, if you did purchase one of those packs during December, you get another $5 off.
1371601	1374062	So, I did, and so I got it for $5.
1375262	1377143	Five games for $5, that's not a bad deal.
1377223	1379184	And so, I'm kind of having this huge collection of...
1379884	1381145	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1399664	1402707	It's kind of like the Fallout shelter of the game industry.
1402767	1409093	If everything goes to shit with the new consoles, I at least have this backup library of games to play.
1410114	1411615	So that's going to be fun.
1412015	1414738	Some folks in chat talking about the price of LittleBigPlanet carding.
1414998	1418862	CriticalMyth said carding was $10 with PlayStation Plus, I think.
1418922	1419502	That is correct.
1419522	1421304	The $10 price is when you have PlayStation Plus.
1421764	1423725	Yeah, it's like $14 if you don't.
1424025	1424626	It's cheap.
1424986	1425626	It's still very cheap.
1426006	1428107	I paid $50 for it, so sit down.
1430068	1430569	Basically.
1431109	1432730	But yes, thank you for the clarification.
1432770	1433910	Yeah, it's for PlayStation Plus.
1435551	1437052	And then what else did I play this week?
1437192	1438052	Oh, other things.
1438773	1441254	More Call of Duty, of course, because we're still playing Call of Duty.
1441374	1442715	I'm still trying to get them to play something else.
1443916	1446937	I have been trying to softmod some Xbox systems.
1446977	1450940	You've found five Xbox systems in a closet, literally at my work.
1452961	1455462	But they're broken in different ways, each one.
1455522	1459184	So I'm going to have to piece some together this week to get one that actually works.
1459244	1459985	I've got some that...
1460485	1461005	Thanks for watching!
1485095	1485735	That's pretty much it.
1486216	1488857	I meant to play some more console games, but just didn't get around to it.
1489957	1491037	A little Borderlands 2, actually.
1491057	1491838	We played a little bit of that.
1491958	1492318	A little bit.
1493438	1494959	My week was mostly console games.
1495099	1497880	One console game that was a majority of my gaming time.
1498200	1502962	It's a game I said I wasn't going to buy, and then I had a moment of weakness and I bought it anyway, and I'm actually glad I did.
1503022	1507844	It's Ni No Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch, which came out this week on PlayStation 3.
1509405	1512086	I've sunk, you know, keep in mind, guys, I was gone all weekend.
1512126	1514548	I sunk about eight hours into the game during the week.
1515888	1520351	And for those that have played the game, and I'll keep this as spoiler-free as possible, I'm at the volcano.
1521292	1522552	Ooh, there's a volcano in the game somewhere.
1523353	1524233	That's about where I'm at.
1524253	1531978	But keep in mind, I've done, like, every side quest, and I'm very OC about kind of trying to do everything, and there is a lot of side quests and things you can do.
1531998	1532778	Um...
1534139	1537460	Nino Cooney, first off, the first thing you're going to notice about the game is the graphics.
1537500	1538540	It's a gorgeous game.
1539220	1540121	It's level 5.
1540501	1548143	I knew they'd done Dragon Quest VIII and all that, but it didn't really click for me until I started playing Nino Cooney.
1548183	1552324	I'm like, why does this feel a lot like White Knight Chronicles to me?
1553144	1554645	Oh, because level five did that game.
1554665	1556345	But don't let that comparison scare you off.
1556405	1563388	It's just they have like that, like the fonts are similar and some of the graphics are a little similar, but the art styles very, very different.
1563408	1564528	The gameplay is very different, too.
1564568	1568530	I don't want people like who didn't like White Knight Chronicles to say like, oh, well, fuck that then.
1570131	1573492	Which I do think, though, White Knight Chronicles is underrated, but that's another episode.
1574893	1577935	There's great graphics in the game.
1578256	1593248	And one thing I really like about it is that it goes from, you know, you got this in-game anime style rendering that goes on to actual cut scenes that Studio Ghibli did of anime that's intermixed in with the game.
1593748	1603016	It is very interesting to me how you'll get these full-blown anime sequences and then you get some voiced over sequences and then you get text, like read the text.
1603596	1626605	but I don't know like it doesn't bother me as much as it bothers other people because maybe that's just what I grew up on you know back in my day when I played Final Fantasy 6 or as we were calling it Final Fantasy 3 because you know we didn't have the internet back then I didn't know that there were more games in Japan we would read all the text you know that's just kind of how you did it so it doesn't really bother me as much um
1627745	1628205	Thank you for watching!
1648717	1651038	There's also that whole Pokemon element of the game.
1651338	1653019	And this slowly unfolds.
1653079	1655041	I mean, you don't have it all right in the very beginning.
1655081	1657362	It slowly unfolds over the first few hours of the game.
1657702	1662825	But yes, many of the monsters you run across in-game, you can actually capture and you use them in battle.
1663145	1665847	And the battle system is really interesting.
1665907	1667868	And this is where the demo really failed.
1668248	1672931	And I know a lot of folks, you know, I'm sure a lot of you here at VOG heard Bobby talk about how he hated the demo.
1673291	1677013	And I even said it was really disappointing as well, too, because it didn't really explain...
1677453	1678734	Thanks for watching!
1701116	1727077	so the the battle sequences are actually very intricate they're kind of Final Fantasy 12-ish in that you actually run around a little battlefield and you're you know doing the auto attack and you might cast magic and you actually collect a little health and magic capsules that help you out uh on the uh battlefield and um yeah I it's it's a neat system um
1727877	1738699	Some of the battles can be challenging, but there is an easy mode, or as I call easy modes in games now, thanks to some inside jokes here at the VOG Network, I call it Black Wolf Fun Forever mode, BFF mode.
1739099	1746361	So yes, there is a Black Wolf Fun Forever mode, or easy mode in the game, and I haven't had to use it yet, but I'm not afraid to if I run into a wall.
1747081	1748982	I have really loved the story so far.
1749382	1750302	It's been fantastic.
1750902	1762287	Now, I have read some things online that a lot of critics were starting to razz the game around the 15 hour mark that it starts to get really grindy and that the story loses a lot of steam and so forth.
1762927	1763748	I'm not there yet.
1763888	1765028	I can't comment on that.
1765388	1768970	So when I'm talking about how much I'm into this game, you might want to take that with a grain of salt.
1769070	1769870	I said it right up front.
1769890	1774292	I'm only eight hours into the game, but it's a damn fine eight hours that I've spent so far.
1774312	1777854	And that's more I can say about other games that I've plunked a large sum of money on.
1778694	1780235	So, you know, take it or leave it.
1780635	1782016	I'm having a great time with the game so far.
1782096	1783596	And I do plan to finish it.
1783676	1784937	I don't see why I wouldn't at this point.
1785437	1786537	So, yeah.
1787258	1787938	I recommend it.
1788218	1788998	At least rent it.
1789359	1790599	But don't go off that demo.
1790639	1791419	The demo was terrible.
1791479	1797862	The demo... All they had to do was back up the demo about 20 minutes to really explain.
1798242	1799803	Because the demo...
1801023	1810167	where you're fighting the boss monster takes place about 20 minutes after you get your little Pokemon or your little monster for the first time and it explains how all that works.
1810687	1818891	I don't understand why they didn't just back the demo up 20 minutes and let you play through that little dungeon-y area to the boss and then end the demo there.
1818911	1824833	That was a poor, poor, poor decision and it's causing some people to think twice about the game.
1826334	1826614	Oops.
1827254	1828595	Demos are important, y'all.
1830191	1833114	So, let's see.
1833154	1833995	Going to the chat room.
1834055	1838620	Breakman says, interesting is not a word that most listeners want to hear as a description of a game.
1839201	1841543	Interest equals what the fuck was the dev thinking?
1841623	1843265	Seriously, they could have done a better job.
1844807	1847470	But you're being as vague as apparently I am.
1847670	1850053	Like, why do you think the dev was smoking crack?
1850133	1851895	Or what do you think they could have done a better job?
1853315	1855296	Maybe I'm missing something about that comment.
1855376	1861077	I don't know, but I don't... You know, where's the part that I'm not catching, apparently?
1861497	1869099	Again, those are live comments at our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com Some other comments on the game in our chatroom.
1869159	1874361	DungeonBuster says, Still liking the game right now, even with the issues, though I'm a big fan of Ghibli's stuff.
1875181	1878362	Dungeon Buster also says, Battle system kind of falls apart later.
1878422	1880982	The AI roles for your party members is kind of challenged.
1881422	1897086	You know, I am noticing that a little bit, that the party members are very liberal in their use of magic, which is very unlike the style I play with, and I can see where that gets really frustrating, but I think it's manageable right now.
1897386	1901347	And you always get to fill up on your HP and MP before a boss, so I'm not...
1904008	1908251	I'm not hating it as much as other people do.
1910932	1911213	Let's see.
1911233	1916196	Loco Poco says, I love Studio Ghibli, but honestly, I didn't like the battle system in the demo at all.
1916216	1916816	Well, you couldn't have.
1916836	1917597	They didn't explain it.
1919218	1919498	Let's see.
1919538	1924942	RawSteelUT says, All Breakman is saying is that interesting is what people tend to say when they can't be wholly complimentary.
1925402	1931946	See, I'm scared to be wholly complimentary because of what I'm seeing or what I've heard about the future and so forth.
1933267	1933608	I don't know.
1934208	1934969	I am enjoying it.
1935009	1941834	Yes, if I were to judge this game on the eight hours alone, I would say yes, this is a must-buy if you love JRPGs.
1942174	1943455	But then is that really fair?
1943783	1945044	Would you judge it on white barf?
1946425	1949828	Yes, and there are all these types of little references and jokes that I love.
1949908	1953791	Yes, there is a look for it in the grocery store in the very beginning of the game.
1953811	1956793	There's a little sign in the background that says, what does it say?
1956853	1959955	Like, yay, milk, it's white barf or something like that.
1960015	1960556	Like, what?
1961016	1964639	AkumaJP says, without Ghibli, the game is just another rogue galaxy.
1966680	1967821	No, I don't agree.
1968562	1968822	Sorry.
1968842	1968942	Sorry.
1970672	1982857	I think it's... I mean, the Ghibli stuff lends itself great, but Studio Ghibli wasn't involved with Dragon Quest VIII, and that was a lot of the similar things I like in both games.
1984337	1986478	Anyhow, there you go.
1987219	1987919	That's my thoughts.
1987959	1988539	Take it or leave it.
1988559	1995042	I'll let you know next week after another eight hours of the game if I'm still as enthusiastic about the game as I am now.
1996923	2000225	Let us move on and talk about a little bit of housekeeping tonight.
2026362	2028484	Awesome, unsolicited things.
2028864	2031967	So I want to share with you guys something that was donated to the show this week.
2032027	2034049	It wasn't money, but it's still pretty awesome.
2034069	2034789	You guys want to see it?
2035570	2038192	So we got a gift this week, FedEx, here to the studio.
2038592	2038972	So you ready?
2039953	2040294	All right.
2040694	2041314	No peeking!
2041795	2042215	Okay.
2042235	2044937	I hope it's chocolate, because I want some.
2046478	2046879	No peeking!
2046899	2049181	If you guessed Rabid Weasel, you are correct.
2049621	2050141	I want a weasel.
2054161	2054661	Booze.
2055182	2056683	Someone sent us booze.
2056703	2060546	That was Brad from Pod Culture, who also... Do not open this in front of me.
2060566	2060906	I will throw up.
2060926	2063068	I thought that might have actually been maple syrup for a second there.
2063168	2063688	Oh, why?
2063728	2065129	You're not a fan?
2065570	2068872	Anything that's fake cinnamon, if I remotely smell it, makes me nauseous.
2069573	2070033	Oh, look at that.
2070534	2074136	I can't believe you would talk negatively about a gift so graciously bestowed.
2074196	2074497	No, no, no.
2074637	2075738	I appreciate the gift.
2075778	2076498	It's very nice.
2076698	2080421	But anything that is... For real, I'm the same way with Spearmint.
2081422	2083524	Like anything that's real or fake Spearmint.
2084244	2085064	It makes me nauseous.
2085104	2086645	Well, I'll say this more for me.
2086945	2087425	That's fine by me.
2087445	2088246	You're welcome to it.
2088266	2089286	That's fine by me.
2090047	2091227	Okay, I'll try to smell it.
2091467	2091927	There you go.
2092027	2092528	There you go.
2093308	2094208	Anyhow, no, don't open it.
2094949	2095369	Save it for 500.
2096770	2098210	Brad from Pod Culture sent that.
2098330	2101472	He also donated the mics that we use here on the show.
2101532	2102252	Which we appreciate.
2102532	2109778	Hand-me-downs from Pod Culture, but they work great, obviously, as you can hear, and help the quality of our show immensely.
2110299	2117105	So this is a nice big bottle of Fireball cinnamon whiskey, and he gave me some mixer ideas to use with this as well.
2118185	2119887	And it looks like it burned a hole in the back of the bottle.
2120728	2121068	Hooray.
2122109	2123110	Well, thank you.
2123150	2129175	It was very nice of you to send it to us, and I'll see if it makes me ill.
2130277	2133540	I'll invite Rice Princess over for the 500th episode, she'll drink it.
2135301	2137664	We should probably pick up some Goldschlager for that.
2138945	2140646	Wait a minute, but Goldschlager is cinnamony too.
2141087	2141747	No, it's butterscotch.
2142568	2143869	Isn't Goldschlager butterscotch?
2143950	2145391	I don't know, I always taste the cinnamony.
2145531	2146712	Are you thinking like butternips?
2147032	2148734	Yeah, that's what I'm thinking of.
2148774	2150396	Goldschlager just tastes like burning.
2150896	2151156	All right.
2151837	2155619	Let's talk about something else, too, I want to do in housekeeping.
2155639	2162004	And I want to talk about an article that was on our website that our pal Bobby Blackwolf posted that I thought was really good.
2162404	2168268	And I don't like to talk about this subject a lot on our show because it keeps coming up as news.
2168348	2171691	And I say for about the past four years, nothing this thing has done.
2171711	2173312	It has been gaming news.
2173792	2175634	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2194531	2223819	But what I want to point out is that at vognetwork.com, Bobby, who does the show before us, did a great little article kind of reflecting back on the better days of G4 when it actually was kind of an extension of an online network about video games and things like that and how that all started and kind of being in the community when all that was going on because I never knew that some of their shows had live chat rooms that you could go in and actually like chat during the show and all that and I don't know.
2224079	2225320	So check that out at vognetwork.com
2255658	2259719	Alright, let's move on now, I guess, into some video game news.
2259739	2260879	I think that was all my housekeeping.
2261040	2262380	Booze and G4.
2262580	2263320	Alright, appropriate.
2264020	2264220	Yes.
2264440	2266541	Let's move on to what is going on this week in gaming.
2266581	2266841	Loki.
2267101	2272103	So, one of the big things that happened this week was THQ's assets were finally auctioned off.
2272703	2280485	And, unfortunately, their original plan to have one person buy everything and then kind of get out of debt...
2280885	2281665	Just didn't happen.
2281806	2285988	So, THQ is no more and all of their assets have been split up.
2287288	2290050	So, here's what happened, where everything went.
2290690	2299115	So, first thing, Relic and Company of Heroes, the IP that Relic had, actually went to Sega.
2299375	2304597	So, Sega's going to be doing that, which makes sense because they have some RTS franchises that they work on.
2305258	2307359	So, that should be cool.
2307919	2314725	and then, of course, THQ Montreal, the studio, as well as the two IPs, 1666 and Underdog.
2315686	2317947	Those went to Ubisoft.
2318548	2320129	So they're going to have that now.
2320670	2324112	As well as, let's see, Evolve, which was an unannounced IP.
2324313	2328156	I guess they're also saying it's called Metamorphosis.
2328756	2329857	That went to Take-Two.
2331158	2334160	Volition and Saints Row, as well as...
2336238	2338459	I think it was just those two.
2338719	2342682	So Volition, the studio, and Saintsboro, and I'm assuming Red Faction and all that stuff.
2343082	2347264	That actually went to Koch, which is Deep Silver.
2347484	2348845	That's the studio name you'd recognize.
2350025	2354308	Homefront went to Crytek, which should be interesting if we get a sequel out of that.
2355208	2355648	Metro...
2358390	2370994	2033 and Metro Last Light that went to Deep Silver as well and then South Park The Stick of Truth the license for that went to Ubisoft so they will be publishing that game later this year
2372955	2374576	That game should have been almost done.
2375596	2377917	That was supposed to come out in what, April, right?
2378237	2380278	It was March, but then it got pushed a little bit.
2380318	2381498	It was supposed to be like second quarter.
2382399	2385440	So the other one was the WWE franchise.
2385480	2387100	That went to take two as well.
2387140	2390702	So you're going to be seeing that coming out on their 2K games license.
2391322	2392482	But none for Darksiders.
2393063	2394023	Nothing for Darksiders.
2395103	2398465	A lot of people are very upset about that, which kind of surprised me.
2398505	2401786	Because if you think there would be enough upset people, somebody would have bought it.
2401966	2412160	Well, from what I read, there was, I guess there are other franchises, the same, was it Virgil or Vigil was working out.
2412921	2418328	Apparently, that was also very risky, I guess, as far as an investment goes, but you would think that they would...
2419489	2423611	I would have thrown a dollar down for it, but, you know, I don't know.
2423731	2426573	I mean, some of these, actually, it's kind of funny what they paid for them.
2426593	2428654	Then you have to, like, pay all those employees.
2428834	2432676	A dollar might have bought you a studio, but then how do you pay the employees?
2432756	2433857	That's the problem.
2433937	2434857	Somebody's got to bankroll.
2434877	2435578	Just buy the IP.
2435958	2437879	Make a crappy cell phone game out of it or something.
2437899	2438219	I don't know.
2440211	2440791	Resell it.
2441412	2441772	I don't know.
2443433	2445554	So yeah, no one bought it.
2446395	2450717	Although it may go to someone else.
2451257	2461503	The other thing too is we don't know who's going to end up with all of the back catalog stuff because that didn't necessarily go to the respective publishers that bought the new franchises.
2461583	2464265	That's just the stuff that was coming out.
2465285	2468767	Older games, that's going to go to completely different people.
2469027	2472569	So I'd be interested to see how that turns out.
2473429	2481012	Ross Steel, UT, in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Considering Deep Silver's marketing ideas, I think Saints Row is in the right place.
2481933	2490837	I don't know if that's a very tongue-in-cheek comment, but I just collectively groaned at that because of that horrific story from last week with the quote-unquote sculpture.
2491557	2493818	But that's just a foreign company.
2493858	2495379	I mean, that's just like Australia.
2495660	2499842	I mean, they can get away with, I think... Well, actually, I'm surprised they could kind of get away with that at all.
2499862	2500863	It was Britain, but that's all right.
2501463	2501683	Still.
2501843	2503024	It was Australian Europe.
2503224	2504885	I mean, whatever.
2506626	2507407	I'm kind of glad, though.
2507447	2512970	I mean, they're trying to, I guess, boost, I guess, their presence in the marketplace.
2513350	2515812	And definitely, those are some game franchises that would do that.
2516452	2519073	I'm not surprised to see, of course...
2520074	2548384	take two not buying Saints Row because that would compete too much with Grand Theft Auto and I was surprised actually EA didn't try to pick it up but maybe they thought that you know they've got some of their own stuff and they would just crowd their lineup or something I don't know that's true but they have Homefront I mean that's Crytek and Crytek is published by EA so yay another military shooter game to go along with the other two or three military shooter franchises that they own
2549930	2558013	Um, I have to say somewhere in here, though, I like that the community has been so supportive of what's been going on at THQ.
2558153	2561034	Like, you know, sometimes we see a lot of these layoffs happen.
2561074	2564715	And it's, it's, it's not that the community doesn't, but the community has always been very good.
2564755	2569157	But I'm just saying, like, sometimes it seems like what happens at the employee level is really cold.
2569217	2571697	Like there's a very cold treatment of what happens to people.
2572258	2579100	And I kind of got the sense here that like, you know, the CEO and a lot of people involved really, like, really felt bad.
2579820	2584684	Even though I think a lot of people... You didn't have to be a genius to see that something like this was coming.
2585384	2590167	I got the sense that there was at least compassion for the people that were affected.
2590508	2596712	And certainly the community is like... I've seen other game studios posting, Hey, were you at THQ?
2596792	2598033	No longer.
2598233	2599113	We're hiring right now.
2599193	2600354	Come over here.
2600394	2601895	Just a lot of Twitter buzz.
2602296	2603056	I think that's great.
2603136	2604957	I love that gamers are helping other gamers.
2605318	2607799	You don't see that in a lot of areas...
2609120	2610921	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2638540	2639361	Dead Rising Dead Island
2658045	2659045	Dead Rising is pretty much done.
2659866	2662307	There will be another one, but we know there's going to be another one.
2662447	2666470	The last couple haven't been fantastic.
2666530	2669612	At least we know the next Saints Row game will have a great trailer, if nothing else.
2672194	2673615	It's just a very over-the-top game.
2673915	2678818	I would be interested to see what they're going to do with it.
2679098	2680959	South Beach doesn't have a whole lot going for it right now.
2681000	2682601	They don't have a lot of stuff that they're publishing.
2682621	2686143	That we know about, to be fair.
2687220	2688762	Dead Island Dead Island
2710640	2716286	But it's nice to see them actually have some good franchises now.
2716326	2720330	Well, I mean, expanding their catalog, I guess.
2720831	2723373	So that might be one I'd worry about a little bit.
2723413	2727878	But I was worried about Saints Row IV anyways when they're like,
2728098	2740108	Yeah, we're going to take this standalone game expansion that was really just going to be Saints Row the Third with some other cheesy bullshit on top of it, and we're going to make that its own game.
2740828	2742770	Oh, and now we're going to make that Saints Row the Fourth.
2742930	2753839	It's like... So I'm already kind of worried about the game just because of how they've treated it, especially with the DLC and stuff, so...
2755060	2757222	Hopefully they build it into something good.
2757542	2758823	As long as they keep that humor.
2759363	2760744	As long as they still have all the same writers.
2760764	2763086	Because Saints Row 3 is so fucking funny.
2763266	2766228	I want to say, I was trying to... I should have looked real quick.
2767849	2768830	What they bought it for.
2769891	2771011	Man, if only you had the money.
2771872	2772573	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2791972	2792913	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2812686	2815388	is apparently ending production in Japan.
2815789	2821073	Now, if you forgot what the Neo Geo X was, you know, I think we all remember what the Neo Geo was many years ago.
2821113	2823294	It was that very expensive brick of a system.
2823594	2824675	I got a couple of them in my house.
2825316	2828258	Well, and then they show up in arcade machines, right, and all that.
2829119	2830460	You know what was awesome about them, though?
2830560	2830720	What?
2831000	2834543	Having the memory cards so you could save your game at the arcade and go home and play it.
2834743	2837205	I'm surprised you didn't pick one of these up, these little Neo Geo Xs.
2837225	2837865	There's no point.
2837905	2840087	There's nothing on there that we didn't want that we don't already own.
2840387	2846209	So, well, and you would have lost your chance now anyway, because apparently the production of it has come to a halt in Japan.
2846249	2848389	These things just came out in December, so I don't know what's going on.
2849089	2853451	But anyhow... It's not actually discontinuing.
2853831	2853951	Oh?
2854691	2856772	It's the limited... What have you heard that I'm not hearing?
2856852	2864694	Well, the limited edition is being discontinued, the one that comes with Ninja Master, but they're still producing it, I guess...
2866114	2872600	and Blaze, which is one of the distributors, said it's still being available.
2872620	2876263	It's just that the limited edition that was originally the launch lineup is no more.
2876643	2878324	Was there a follow-up that I missed or something?
2878344	2879045	Because I'm not seeing that.
2879125	2880526	Yeah, they did a follow-up.
2881527	2882848	There was a few places around it.
2882928	2884169	Eurogamer is one that had it.
2884510	2887792	And I want to say, I'm trying to think.
2889253	2891175	And Gadget also had it.
2891395	2894698	They were saying, I guess, I don't know.
2896178	2899821	I know I read it, that they were... It wasn't quite discontinued.
2899921	2904405	Well, I'm interested to see how long this can kind of... Do you think something like this can sustain itself?
2904545	2910349	Probably, it's... Since we all believe the fact that it would have disappeared as quick as it showed up... It really should have.
2910529	2917215	I mean, no offense, it's just... I mean, the handheld device itself, it's very similar to what I have with the Dingu.
2917735	2919717	It's just like this arm...
2920617	2920878	But...
2945373	2946654	No, apparently it is.
2946794	2947674	Yeah, it's still going.
2948294	2961620	And even in the US, they said Tomo Inc., the company behind the Neo Geo X, says the production hasn't ceased on the main Neo Geo standalone handheld, but has ceased on the Neo Geo X Gold Limited Edition.
2962441	2963841	But that was the plan anyways.
2964461	2966242	Well, maybe I wanted the Limited Edition.
2966582	2972405	And they're saying they're going to add more games and peripherals and software updates.
2975652	2982535	GameGuru in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says they should just put out the Neo Geo games on PC like Sega does for Genesis games.
2983375	2986356	A few of them are on Wii Virtual Console.
2987736	2990157	Aren't some of them on PlayStation 3 as well?
2990197	2990938	I believe so.
2990998	2998520	I think PlayStation 3 has a few of those games and they're not PS1 classics, obviously, but like a similar classics library.
2998540	3000041	I think they call it like SNK Collection.
3000401	3003142	You do see those Neo Geo games kind of pop up other places.
3003602	3004543	But, correct.
3004563	3005624	I don't think PC's one of them.
3006145	3008627	Although, you know, you just, like, download MAME.
3009428	3012070	Not that I told you to do that, but we all know.
3012831	3013111	Alright.
3014052	3015033	Let's move on with more news.
3015053	3015514	DarkSakura.
3016807	3023931	Okay, well, now we know that there's been rumors going around about what is going to be the new Xbox.
3024371	3026853	And we know that there was that completely fabricated story.
3027653	3033257	So, this though is actually what I found was looking to be quite a bit different.
3034777	3037619	They're actually talking about specs up for the system itself.
3038099	3040821	Talking about it under the code name Durango.
3041824	3044567	I don't, again, I don't know if it has anything to do with the rumor.
3044747	3047870	We take everything with a huge grain of salt when it comes to these type of rumors, right?
3047890	3049992	Yeah, especially since that other story was fabricated.
3050032	3052274	But, you know, it's quite a bit different.
3052394	3066108	So, they're saying that it's codenamed Durango and that they have a little bit of the tech saying that it's supposed to run on an 8-core CPU, an AMD CPU at 1.6 gigahertz, just like the new PlayStation thing.
3066968	3093706	And, uh, that it's, uh, running on the, um, Jaguar technology And, uh, apparently, uh, it's supposed to be working with a 32, uh, uh, meg of RAM and 8 gigabytes of memory Of, uh, it looks like, I think they're graphic memory So, it's looking pretty, pretty big I mean, again, I don't know if this is actually true But, it seems to make sense and looks pretty impressive
3095598	3098520	To be fair, Microsoft does have a history of stuff leaking out.
3098860	3108685	Now, we do know there was that guy on Tumblr that was all, I'm so sick of people making shit up about Microsoft rumors, I'm going to make shit up about Microsoft and spread it all over the internet to prove a point.
3109325	3110246	Alright, dude, point made.
3111886	3118090	But, you know, so there's all that fake stuff out there, but you also know what they say, where there's smoke, there's fire.
3118110	3121591	And these are the types of things people are talking about and speculating and so forth.
3122052	3122212	So...
3123072	3130153	Aside from saying this is true, because we don't know if it's true or not, what do you think about if it was true?
3130193	3134414	Do you think this could be the direction that Microsoft should be going in?
3134434	3139315	Because I'll tell you this, that crap that was made up on the Tumblr and all that, that sounded awful.
3140255	3148476	I should say it sounded cool, but in reality, the whole tablet being that much integrated, it just didn't sound feasible.
3149077	3150277	It just wasn't going to work.
3150477	3150717	This...
3152477	3157680	This didn't say anything about the tablet at all.
3157840	3159600	It just talked about running power.
3160861	3172306	It also was comparing it with the Orbis graphics for the new PlayStation and saying that still the Orbis is turning out to be probably more powerful in terms of graphic capability than the new Xbox.
3172766	3172886	So...
3175838	3177981	It sounds pretty much what I expected anyway.
3178301	3186149	They're going to go with, I think, more of processing with, I think, more in terms of how the Xbox is now.
3186189	3189853	I mean, focus on the games, how they play, not necessarily exactly how they look.
3190734	3193137	Which, Sony has always been about flash.
3195419	3202685	Well, it'll be interesting to see, but at the end of the day, we won't really know until E3, but more speculation to continue until then.
3203625	3210671	Look around E3 week, though, because didn't Microsoft's entire presentation get blown the morning of their press conference or something this last year?
3211771	3214153	The Halo 4 stuff all leaked out or something?
3215494	3216655	It was either this year or last year.
3216795	3220318	It just all went on the internet the day of or something.
3220338	3221018	It was crazy.
3221459	3223980	Anyhow, more news, Logie.
3225325	3228427	All right, so kind of a similar thing with the PlayStation 3.
3229268	3233590	Kotaku apparently received some documentation.
3234571	3235792	90 PDFs, they say.
3235972	3238053	Wow, that's a lot of PDFs.
3240174	3253443	And this is being released by an individual known as SuperDAE, which you may remember was one of the guys that sold one of the Xbox development kits, the brand new ones for the next system, on eBay, or at least attempted to sell one.
3254243	3257245	and some of the details coming from that.
3257305	3263708	Spec-wise, of course, they're saying that it's going to have 8 gigs of RAM, 2.2 gigabytes of video RAM.
3264109	3271653	They're going to have a CPU that's built out of four dual-core AMD 64 bulldozer processors, so a total of eight cores.
3272133	3276255	A GPU that's AMD R10XX.
3276535	3281238	They haven't really said what kind of GPU yet, but something around that spec.
3283120	3292173	4 USB 3.0 ports, 2 Ethernet ports, a Blu-ray drive, of course, and a 160GB hard drive.
3295126	3301768	As well as they're saying HDMI optical 2.0, 5.1, and 7.1 channel sound.
3301928	3304609	Which is pretty much similar to what they have right now with the PlayStation 3.
3307470	3310471	The controller, they're not really saying too much about it.
3311632	3312332	It could change.
3314153	3320935	They're saying that the difference right now with the controller is it's going to be similar to the Vita controller.
3321515	3324900	They're at least going to add some sort of touch sensor to the Vita.
3325720	3330606	I think Robin mentioned that's probably that stupid back touch panel thing.
3331187	3331888	God, I hope not.
3332048	3333750	It's going to be a waste of time.
3334631	3338155	But right now they're saying that it's got... Stop trying to make back touch happen.
3341378	3342839	Some sort of touchpad on there.
3343320	3348704	Maybe even another... I don't know if they're going to have an actual screen or something on that.
3349504	3357049	They're also doing something with the account management right now where you're going to be able to link local accounts together.
3358350	3360392	I don't really know what that's supposed to do as far as maybe...
3363203	3363563	I don't know.
3363603	3364324	I don't know.
3387199	3390741	Could this be all angsty Tumblr person made up too?
3391461	3398926	I don't think so because the guy has had access to what was supposed to be a kit.
3399206	3404809	This is supposed to be coming from a developer kit for the next PlayStation system.
3405209	3409933	So, a lot of this could change, but it's just getting closer to the specs right now.
3410413	3414796	I don't think you're really going to know until the system comes out, but everyone wants to speculate.
3414816	3418699	And if you compare this to the Durango...
3420420	3440716	Xbox Lube specs, they're both very similar 8 core processors, you're going to have a pretty high end video card in there 8 gigs of RAM, HDMI, USB 3.0 stuff and Blu-ray so they're both pretty similar as far as that goes it's going to be how they use that
3441618	3442199	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3462495	3463296	and DarkSakura.com.
3485056	3494802	Talk to the Times this week and in the business section mentioned kind of in passing that they're waiting to see what Microsoft does before making any announcements regarding PlayStation 4.
3494882	3498945	Harai goes as far to say they're going to let Microsoft make the first move.
3499065	3502627	I don't know how much of that is kind of like, you know, kind of paraphrasing or what.
3502647	3510772	But anyway, the quote from the original article is, why go first when your competitors can look at your specifications and come up with something better?
3512034	3512514	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3532901	3534622	Well, and they do what works for them.
3535283	3542868	A story I don't think is coming up on tonight's show, but I was reading a little bit about beforehand, was what were the top 20 selling games in Japan last year?
3543448	3545029	They're like all Nintendo games.
3545049	3547351	There's no Xbox, of course, because it's Japan.
3547711	3549912	There's a spittering of PlayStation 3.
3550193	3551814	I think Resident Evil 6 was in there.
3552174	3556076	There was a random PSP game that was some robot game.
3556097	3558118	But most of it is Nintendo.
3558158	3559119	But here's my thought.
3559499	3562501	I know Japan's a pretty decent-sized market, but I mean,
3563281	3571426	Aren't they declining as far as their market share in the whole big span of everything worldwide?
3572127	3573788	Console sales and game sales.
3573828	3576789	Pretty soon, that's not going to matter.
3577870	3581012	Here's how the purchasing goes in Australia.
3581072	3584234	It's not going to matter that the consoles don't do well in there.
3585675	3585955	I think.
3588251	3591292	Other interesting comment from chat here, talking about the PlayStation 4.
3591992	3599074	RossDLUT says, especially with Sony, who can ill afford another $599 US dollars fiasco.
3600255	3603656	Piggybacking on that, maybe wait for some of the tech to become cheaper.
3604096	3605317	before they launched their system.
3606478	3607159	Storing it out there.
3607959	3609701	What do you think in hearing what he says?
3609761	3621890	Now, I want to say I saw something else that came out after this that was kind of like, you know, that Sony's, like, this doesn't mean that we're not going to, you know, do something competitive or whatever, because obviously they want to keep investors happy.
3621930	3623492	But what do you think this all means, Loki?
3623532	3628616	Do you think there might be actual reason for there not to show the PlayStation 4 this year?
3628636	3629957	Do you think that might actually come to life?
3630307	3634889	I don't know if they're going to show it or not, but I don't think that they can really wait too long.
3635029	3654255	If you think about it, they can't really make their system spec-wise so much greater than the X. I mean, they're not going to do that for one, because of cost, and two, because when these games are being put out on multi-platforms, which they're probably going to, you're not going to really see that much of a benefit to having additional...
3654955	3663224	I mean, I guess additional power, the game might play a little bit better, but most of the time they're going to be developing it across the board.
3663244	3664285	It's going to be similar.
3664305	3669410	I mean, if you look at the PlayStation 3 versus the Xbox 360, wasn't the PlayStation 3 supposed to be a more powerful system?
3669770	3676317	Yet a lot of the games that come out on the PlayStation 3 chug and just don't even have the frame rate that the Xbox 360 games do.
3677478	3679301	So, I don't know.
3679441	3684027	I think that they should take the safe approach, actually.
3686089	3691977	I'm kind of wondering what they're going to do with extra things or gimmicks with these controllers because...
3693138	3694599	It didn't work with six axis.
3695479	3696519	They tried to make it happen.
3696559	3697480	It just wasn't working.
3697800	3702121	And I don't think touch controls are really going to add anything either.
3702181	3703082	It's just going to be annoying.
3703102	3708184	And move hasn't really taken off either, even though move is actually one of the better motion controls.
3708224	3709784	Yeah, I think it is actually pretty good.
3710084	3710985	It's very accurate.
3711145	3717487	I mean, I was trying to use... In fact, I was trying to play Connect Party today to show my son this stuff, and we have a window behind...
3717967	3729240	you know the team or where the you know in the view of the connect and it wasn't working because there was sun outside and so connect is like saying fuck you i am not working um
3730934	3754667	so yeah i mean it seems like the move stuff works pretty good but like even you know uh nelly was like so this is supposed to be some big you know motion controller thing i'm like yeah well the next one that comes out probably be way better than this is just the first generation of it but then they they never work as good as they say they're going to never that's why i'm gonna wait you know because i've already been fooled three or four times
3755895	3760157	Interesting perspective from AkumaJP in our chatroom, who actually lives in Japan.
3760578	3766261	AkumaJP at live.vognetwork.com saying, Yeah, almost all mobile phone now.
3766721	3770683	Even Tokyo Game Show from last year was all Gris, Mobage, all mobile now.
3771404	3773445	Even we all now almost all mobile.
3774511	3780114	Which, you know, I want to say when I looked at that list, it was a lot of 3DS stuff you even saw there.
3780134	3786118	Again, portable, which, you know, it doesn't surprise me that that's, you know, it's just, it's a different culture in Japan.
3786478	3787118	Very different.
3787939	3792822	A lot more of the, you know, commuters than you might have here and so forth.
3793282	3800366	And just, you know, especially in places like Tokyo, smaller living spaces where you don't have, like Kinect just doesn't fucking work there, right?
3800386	3800486	Right.
3800806	3829383	so you know handhelds are the way to go so just different but the sad thing is we got a lot of mobile stuff here too but I don't think I don't want to see mobile replace gaming there's a lot that mobile can't do although ironically enough we have a an interesting story tonight about a online type of game that's trying to emulate console a little more but there's so much that mobile can't do like it just can't give you that same experience I don't know so
3831051	3856037	He also explains Mobile Gay as a mobile game Oh, I see, it was an abbreviation Well, let's move on, DarkSakura As soon as I can get it I'm on my iPad again Okay, well this is a game I brought up during what I was playing And I just played a little bit of it this week because honestly I wanted a nap It's called Chompston And it's a mix of Pac-Man and Bomberman
3856297	3857718	Wait, so you're saying this game puts you to sleep?
3858299	3860040	No, I was sleepy already.
3862081	3870828	The game is actually, the sound effects work in time with the music, kind of like how, great, now I can't think of the puzzle game.
3872189	3872970	Luminous.
3873150	3874050	Luminous, exactly.
3875071	3880535	Kind of like how Luminous did, so as you get the dots and throw bombs, it works in time with the music.
3881016	3882357	The music in the game is actually pretty neat.
3883669	3885351	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
3901989	3903790	and you get different power-ups for them as well.
3904231	3917240	It's really neat, but you download the game at, and I'm going to have to say out the site, ContraLogic.com slash games slash Chompston, C-H-O-M-P-S-T-O-N.
3917780	3918961	It's definitely worth your time.
3919001	3923304	It's a fun game and it gets tricky, so support them.
3925532	3925852	All right.
3926972	3929453	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
3929673	3934694	If for whatever reason you've already worn out Chompston and you want to check out something else this week.
3935615	3936755	What's coming out to a store near you?
3937135	3938135	It's not a whole lot this week.
3938175	3943437	It's pretty much the Hitman HD Trilogy on PS3 and Xbox 360.
3945257	3955322	Also, if you were looking for a new PlayStation 3 console, they have the new 500GB one, you know, the one that came with the Instant Game Collection, basically the PlayStation Plus for a year.
3955662	3958923	Well, they have that now in white, in case you didn't want a black console.
3959724	3964986	And... That's pretty much it.
3965846	3967647	Also, it was supposed to be this week, Heavy Fire...
3969688	3976456	Shattered Spear but that probably got delayed because massive games never fucking come out on time
3980215	3983677	Let's travel to Japan and check out what's coming out in Japan.
3984497	3987058	If anything, it's been kind of slow lately.
3987118	3989900	Well, there's one thing on the radar on the Xbox 360.
3990360	3993962	Love Toray, bitter version in limited and regular edition.
3993982	3997203	That's your lone Xbox 360 release, but we already talked about Xbox 360.
3997283	3998804	I completely misheard you say that.
3998844	4000545	I thought you said toire, which means toilet.
4001937	4002397	Oh, no, no.
4003638	4011321	On PlayStation 3, Excel World, Kasoku no Choten, also in regular and limited editions from Bandai Namco, comes out this week.
4011941	4013502	FIFA Street gets a price reduction.
4013722	4016663	And in Japan this week, PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.
4016803	4021265	I didn't realize they didn't get the game when we did, but they are now getting their version this week on the PlayStation 3.
4021545	4023946	January the 31st is when you can expect to see that.
4024506	4034253	On the Vita this week, also PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale and Sengoku Hime 3, Tenka Okirisaku Hikari Tokage comes out in regular and limited edition.
4034654	4036575	Because, you know, they love their limited editions over there.
4038248	4041629	and unlike over here, their limited editions actually get filled most of the time.
4041809	4042730	Oh, I'll get into that later.
4042790	4043890	And usually have better stuff.
4044370	4046991	On the Wii U, yes, there is a Wii U release this week.
4047091	4052733	It's Shin Hokuro Musou comes out this week.
4053033	4054094	And I'm trying to see what this is.
4054154	4056075	Is this Fist of the North Star for fuck's sake?
4056115	4057195	Hold on, pull up the thing.
4057955	4058335	Yeah.
4059216	4060916	Yeah, it's Fist of the North Star, Ken's Rage 2.
4061617	4062337	Oh, good lord.
4064895	4066616	Can always count on another Fist of the North Star game.
4066636	4069379	God, how long has Fist of the North Star been out, like, since 1979?
4069779	4070620	No, I'm serious.
4070820	4072601	I know, I know.
4072621	4075163	I think it's been out that, like, Hokuto no Ken's been out that long.
4075183	4078846	Well, it's coming out on Xbox 360 in two weeks.
4079287	4082950	Do you remember Punch Mania, the Hokuto no Ken version of Punch Mania?
4083010	4083450	I do.
4083570	4084191	That was great.
4084231	4084911	It was fun.
4085252	4090816	But it's funny to me that, like, you know, that's all the Wii U's got on it is a franchise from 1979.
4093218	4094019	coming out this week.
4094039	4097284	Alright, but look, those games are still popular in all seriousness.
4097304	4098986	I want one of those at my house.
4099026	4099787	Mildly popular.
4099807	4101489	Alright, let's go to UK.
4102825	4106268	On the 29th, we have Let's Fish hooked on for the Vita.
4107409	4114474	We have on the 30th, Skulls of the Shogun, which is coming out for Xbox 360, PC, and the Windows phone.
4114494	4115475	I just thought that was interesting.
4115995	4119338	On the 31st, Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed for PC.
4120338	4120939	Yay.
4121700	4130006	And then on February 1st, we have Hitman HD Trilogy and Ni No Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch.
4131127	4131467	That's it.
4134229	4138452	Alright, just a few more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
4138812	4140133	But first, Loki.
4140734	4149120	So, yeah, apparently the whole pay-to-win thing with EA is still continuing.
4149640	4155825	And now, Dead Space fans, fans of a very hardcore franchise, are so happy to find out that
4156405	4157086	Hey, guess what?
4157166	4158727	Microtransactions are here.
4158827	4159447	Yay!
4159707	4161168	Free-to-play microtransactions.
4161609	4166072	And apparently they say the reason this is happening is because mobile gamers.
4166592	4167713	Mobile gamers, yes.
4167773	4172697	There are a lot of players out there, especially players coming from mobile games who are accustomed to microtransactions.
4173417	4177259	They're like, I need this now and I want this now.
4177979	4180660	And they'll need instant gratification.
4180701	4183462	So we included an option in order to attract those players.
4183882	4192586	So if they're like, oh, I need 5,000 Tugston because I'm short on this upgrade, they can have it.
4193186	4196008	We need to make sure that we're expanding our audience as well.
4196388	4202931	Yes, so that's the way you expand your audience is you have microtransactions in your fucking game because mobile...
4203348	4205190	It doesn't expand your audience because think about it.
4206231	4208633	People aren't going to buy this game because they have microtransactions in it.
4208693	4216021	All you're doing is saying, hey, people that are used to paying microtransactions for stuff may buy this microtransaction stuff in our game.
4218533	4221034	That is some dumbass logic this guy is using.
4221114	4222175	I'm sorry.
4222195	4227877	The games industry is in trouble if that's the way that people making decisions are really thinking.
4228797	4233279	Just say, we're putting it in the game because people are dumb enough to buy it.
4233419	4234319	That's the reality.
4234959	4236160	We want to make free money.
4237861	4240462	We think because of mobile games, people are dumb enough to buy it.
4240922	4243224	Mobile games coming over to console?
4244624	4246465	What fuck backwards logic is that?
4246906	4249787	Everybody is saying it's supposedly going the other way.
4250328	4252829	Everybody's going to mobile.
4252849	4257492	They're not suddenly going to come over to console because you're designing the game so that they can spend more money.
4258132	4262913	I guarantee that there is nobody on the face of the planet that says, hey, you know what?
4263513	4266214	I like this game because there's microtransactions in it.
4266254	4268814	You know what else mobile games have going for them?
4268954	4270395	They're 99 cents.
4272335	4274715	That's a huge difference.
4275075	4277296	Why don't you middle managers understand this?
4278516	4278916	Volume.
4279696	4280977	That's where you make your money, volume.
4281057	4282417	And people are dumb enough to buy it.
4283797	4286958	Even if one person buys it, it's three bucks they didn't have before.
4288055	4290097	and you see EA doing this in a lot of their games.
4290598	4291699	They were the first to do it.
4291719	4294942	They used to put out, they had cheats in their games and then guess what?
4295163	4296704	They stopped having cheats in their games.
4296764	4298646	The Godfather game had cheats in it.
4299147	4300348	Oh, but guess what?
4300749	4304633	When you buy it on the Xbox 360, you're actually going to have to buy those cheats in-game.
4305473	4324660	Bobby on his show tonight when we were on the phone call at the end was talking about SimCity and how he was playing the beta and was saying how he didn't have enough simoleons or whatever to do some of the things he wanted to do I said, oh I bet you could probably log into the EA store when the game comes out and get 100,000 simoleons for $2.99 and you're right, that's the type of thing that you used to type a cheat code in to get and unlock
4325742	4327083	Of course, because here's the thing.
4327443	4328864	Why wouldn't they do this?
4328984	4336989	I mean, if you think about it, if you're making a game, why wouldn't you give the opportunity or miss out on the opportunity to make a little bit more money?
4337129	4341652	Which also is the real reason that game is all online DRM.
4341712	4342993	Don't fucking kid yourself.
4343413	4346675	All this stuff about, you know, the interaction with other people.
4346695	4347175	Uh-uh.
4347455	4347736	Uh-uh.
4348096	4349277	It's to sell you this shit.
4349637	4354160	So that way the cheat codes can't happen offline.
4354220	4354540	But wait.
4355182	4356311	they will, hackers will get it
4357993	4361555	And sadly, that's the only way these guys are going to learn their lesson.
4361615	4365377	And then, oh, but the hackers are so mean to us.
4365737	4369919	We lost all this money on the game and it was the hackers' fault.
4369959	4371200	The hackers did it, Loki.
4371220	4378984	I'm sure that so many people out there pirated The Sims 3 because that's why they released so many fucking expansions to this game.
4379444	4384707	I mean, if it wasn't doing well, they wouldn't release 90,000 expansions for The Sims 3.
4386558	4413708	you saw how many came out for Sims 2 back in the day I never paid for one but I'm telling you though that they're making people buy this and they're not just like you know for 70s 80s and 90s stuff that just came out it's like 20 bucks and you get crap for your house $20 for not even a really a huge game expansion $40 for a really big expansion like going to a you know university life that's coming out in March and
4414848	4418370	They literally have one or two expansions a month coming out for this stuff.
4419191	4420312	It's ridiculous.
4420572	4421712	And you know why they're doing it?
4421913	4424234	It's because people are buying them.
4424454	4426275	Seriously, you're a company looking to make money.
4426595	4427876	You're looking to stay alive.
4428216	4428857	What are you going to do?
4429197	4433399	If people are buying DLC stuff, you're going to put it in your game.
4433560	4436501	You're going to have these microtransactions in there because people buy them.
4437402	4439363	People may bitch about them online, but you know what?
4439383	4440704	At the end of the day, people are buying them.
4440844	4442485	If they weren't buying them, they wouldn't put it in the game.
4446621	4446941	Atari Inc.
4447402	4449765	filed for Chapter 11 restructuring bankruptcy this week.
4465983	4473088	and it is trying to basically separate itself from Atari SA, which is the French parent company and be its own independent business.
4473488	4476991	But of course, you know, that's not how they really reported on CNN.
4477011	4479352	Everybody else says, Atari went bankrupt this week.
4479412	4480233	Remember Pong?
4480253	4482494	People are dumb.
4482614	4483675	Atari's bankrupt.
4483695	4485897	I'm gonna miss Pong.
4487935	4488536	Combat.
4490157	4491838	I mean, let's be real, guys.
4491898	4495841	A lot of that Atari that we know went away with a game crash in 84.
4496322	4499024	What did Atari recently have going for it?
4499404	4507090	Alone in the Dark, Test Drive Unlimited, Retro Arcade releases.
4507710	4509131	Okay, let me rephrase.
4509572	4512014	What did Atari have going for it that THQ didn't?
4514039	4542121	Alone in the Dark but I'm you're missing my point a lot of this is kind of happening to a lot of these guys you know is that it's not enough they had Dragon Ball Z for a while they also had what oh god I will forever associate this with with modern Atari was the Driver 3 on PlayStation that buggy as hell game wasn't that them
4543130	4544071	Driver 3 was fantastic.
4544111	4545352	It is a pinnacle of buggy-ass games.
4563453	4564593	Let's see, where was it?
4564633	4572355	It was Atari, then it was GT Interactive, and then GT Interactive became Infogrames, and that's when the French side of it came in.
4572755	4581457	And then Infogrames bought Hasbro Interactive, which acquired Atari, and then Infogrames changed their name to Atari, and they used the Atari name in the logo.
4582637	4587498	So, yeah, Atari, as it is now, wasn't even the same company as it was before anyway.
4588238	4592679	It's probably just going to evolve again, and maybe they'll find their next big thing.
4592739	4593099	I don't know.
4595635	4601580	To register for participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on VOGnetwork.com, use the passphrase straw.
4602301	4611468	Well, let's go back to a more classic time when Atari was like, you know, that was like Nintendo or Sony or what it was, Atari.
4612329	4613750	Actually, this game may not be that old.
4613931	4614411	Or maybe it is.
4614491	4616273	Actually, I think you did pick a game that old this week.
4616453	4616793	Close.
4616953	4617454	Really close.
4617674	4619035	Pretty, pretty decently old.
4619338	4619598	DarkSakura.com
4633226	4638491	Well, it's not as old as Hokuto no Ken, which, thanks for, I forget who said it, came out in 83.
4638892	4643096	Rygar is the game of the week.
4643116	4648662	It came out by Tecmo in 1986, and it was an arcade game called Argus no Senshi.
4650463	4656409	Which means, I mean, you pretty much play as the legendary warrior, and you're getting a...
4657330	4665134	Attacked on all sides, and you use this disc armor weapon that's basically a shield with a long chain attached to it.
4666735	4674879	And basically, I always think that it's kind of like they're...
4677216	4678738	What's the word I'm trying to think of?
4678798	4681441	Their derivative of Rastan.
4682081	4683503	It's the same type of platforming game.
4685685	4691832	But it came out basically you play as a guy named...
4693333	4697036	Rhaegar, who is a dead warrior who rose from his grave.
4698336	4705681	To use the disc armor and other weapons to try to stop this guy named Rhaegar, who took over the land of Argon.
4705981	4713846	You just go through and you basically shoot people and you shoot animals.
4714466	4718728	and you shoot spiders and you shoot dragons and you shoot midgets.
4719189	4724871	Now, I want to say real quick, and you'll probably get into this in a minute, but a lot of people in chat are like, oh, I remember this game on the NES.
4725132	4729214	But you're actually talking about the arcade version of Rygar, which was very, very different.
4729234	4729894	Yes, I am.
4730294	4733456	But I don't know if you'll get into the NES one at all and why it was different.
4733636	4734256	Hold your horses!
4734536	4735697	Keep your pants on!
4736337	4737798	I wanted our chatters to pay attention.
4738098	4738779	Don't run away yet.
4739059	4739299	Meh.
4740894	4750901	Well, at any rate, as I was getting to, the game has been ported to the Sharp X68000, the Commodore 64, the Sega Master System, but that was only in Japan.
4750961	4753643	It was called Argus no Jujiken.
4754543	4760727	It came out for the ZX Spectrum 48K, the Amstrad 6128, and the Atari Lynx.
4761568	4769373	And then on the Xbox, it was included in a compilation that was the Tecmo Classic Arcade, and now there is a Wii Virtual Console version as well.
4769693	4770654	That's the arcade version.
4771314	4776599	Now, the Atari Lynx is probably the closest to the arcade version.
4776759	4777399	That's weird.
4781654	4784718	Um, however, it did have some different rounds.
4784798	4788262	There were only 23 rounds, but it was supposed to be pretty close to the arcade version.
4788882	4789904	I think I actually have it.
4789924	4794509	I just don't think of Atari Lynx as, like, the arcade-accurate system ever, you know?
4795109	4795910	You'd be surprised.
4796010	4798433	The one on Xbox was, I actually have that collection you're talking about.
4798453	4800756	It's not bad, but it's also not 360 backwards compatible.
4801356	4801777	Sucks.
4802097	4802317	Yeah.
4803891	4806313	Hachamecha Daishengeki Platform Action RPG
4825050	4827012	and it was quite a bit different.
4828373	4837942	Basically, you go through different settings to try to kill the evil King Ligar, Blah, who is on the planet of Argol, which was Argus in Japan.
4838663	4848011	And then you have to visit the five gods who give you different items, and you go through different realms, and they all have a boss, and all this fun stuff.
4849201	4851203	But yeah, it's a little bit different.
4851763	4869379	With the difference in the versions, the arcade version is more side-scrolling, the NES one is an open-ended action-adventure game, sort of Metroidvania-like, and at the start of the game you have access to some of the worlds and then you get the other worlds opened up as you go.
4871221	4874924	You also had permanent power-ups in the NES version.
4875965	4877786	and different experience points you could use.
4878726	4893031	There was a new, I guess kind of like a sequel that came out, Rygar the Legendary Adventure that came out on PS2 and it was a transition to 3D style gameplay and it was pretty much rated okay.
4893851	4897192	And there is a Wii port that came out in 2007.
4897873	4899193	So there you go, Rygar.
4899973	4901494	The arcade version is the best one.
4903410	4904231	I like the NES one.
4904251	4905673	The NES one had a great soundtrack.
4905693	4907236	That's what I really liked about it.
4907296	4908618	But they're so different.
4908658	4911642	I mean, they really should just be considered two separate games.
4911902	4913725	The arcade one is so different from the NES one.
4913765	4916108	Well, look at Strider in the arcade and on the Genesis.
4917070	4917971	And then the NES one.
4918051	4919814	The NES one was actually based off the Strider manga.
4920014	4925980	Okay, yeah, that is a very good comparison, is that the Rygar games are that different, like the Strider games are.
4926080	4927201	It's a very good comparison.
4927621	4935229	See, I love the NES Strider, but I know you think it's shit, because you have the Genesis... No, I didn't say I think it's shit, it's just a different game.
4936449	4937910	I kind of like them both, myself.
4964481	4965502	DarkSakura, how dare you?
4965522	4966662	Don't you understand?
4966682	4969464	This is the foundation that all internet video game media is based on.
4969504	4970205	You can't have a tie.
4970225	4971605	Yeah, but I have a personality disorder.
4991714	4992615	It's called honoree.
4994197	4995197	Alright, we're going to take a break.
4995278	5001303	On that note, we're going to take a break and when we come back with Orange Launch Radio, we've got more, yet again, more on Disney Infinity tonight.
5001343	5001903	Jeez, Loki.
5001923	5004025	It just doesn't stop with the Disney Infinity news.
5004506	5006528	And Nintendo had an avalanche of news this week.
5006628	5008189	We're going to talk all about that and get into that.
5008249	5016677	When we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio, your phone calls, your emails, and much more when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.
5023208	5033454	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this January the 27th, 2013, episode number 491 in progress.
5034254	5038177	And we're going to start off this part of the show with some rapid fire news.
5038677	5040238	If you're ready, Loki, take it away.
5040718	5040918	Sure.
5041819	5042159	All right.
5042439	5046041	So let's talk a little bit about Disney Infinity.
5046241	5047062	Of course, can't.
5047922	5050403	Can't go another show without talking more Disney Infinity.
5050983	5054524	They're going to actually put out lots of content, which is kind of a duh.
5056085	5064687	I've actually heard some people saying, hey, we might not actually see any more standalone games from Disney Interactive now that they have this Disney Infinity thing.
5064707	5067568	And that kind of seems somewhat true.
5067668	5071049	Didn't they close a lot of that?
5072441	5073122	Yeah, they did.
5073342	5081768	Because the whole, like, there was not jokes, but commentary going around about how there won't be another split second or what that racing game and, you know.
5081828	5084050	Yeah, because BlackRock's, I think, close.
5084090	5085290	Yeah, yeah.
5085310	5087592	So, that's too bad.
5088773	5090814	But yeah, they've got quite a bit coming out.
5090835	5092856	In fact, some of which I'm about to tell you about.
5093136	5095998	And this isn't exactly all out there yet.
5097299	5098200	So, let's see here.
5098280	5098780	Let's talk...
5099881	5102143	Disney Infinity Sully from Monsters Inc.
5102163	5102643	and Monsters U
5123659	5145845	And then, of course, to go with that, they've got a bunch of other side characters, including in the Incredibles universe, Dash, Mrs. Incredible, Violet in Syndrome, Monsters U, they've got Mike and Randall, Pirates of the Caribbean, Captain Barboza, and Davy Jones.
5146565	5148706	They're also going to be doing some additional play sets.
5148946	5155008	Zoro and Cars are going to be the first two play sets that are launched alongside this as well.
5155528	5161731	And with Zoro, you're going to get Zoro and Tonto, and then Cars, Lightning McQueen, and I can't remember who else.
5162411	5162671	I think...
5163631	5165392	Might be Flo, yeah.
5166772	5170614	And then, of course, they're going to have some triple packs in case you want to get a few characters at a time.
5170654	5172615	Sidekicks and villains are going to be the two themes of those.
5174755	5177597	And then I know one of the questions was, hey, when are we going to see Mickey Mouse?
5178897	5205955	and you're not going to wait that long September is when you're going to see Mickey Mouse as a standalone character I'm not sure the garb that they had the picture of was Sorcerer's Apprentice so I'm not sure if it's going to be Sorcerer's Apprentice Mickey or if it may even be its own adventure set by then we'll see I think Phineas and Ferb is somewhere during the summer and then fall you're going to get Frozen the playset for that and Wreck-It Ralph sadly we have to wait so long for Wreck-It Ralph Phineas and Ferb needs to be now
5207445	5211227	but those are all going to be available soon.
5211367	5217690	That is weird that Wreck-It Ralph isn't towards the start because I would have thought that the Blu-ray would be out around April-ish.
5217710	5221511	They're just trying to probably space it out because you've got two play sets coming out.
5221531	5226893	They've got the stuff that ties in with Monsters University and Zorro and then Cars.
5226913	5228234	It might be a little much.
5228354	5230255	I was hoping during the summer...
5230555	5231235	Wait for Disney Infinity Giants.
5260307	5264301	I don't think they're going to come out with anything like Skyliner's Giants because they don't really need to.
5264321	5264883	Fool.
5270202	5273504	They don't need to do it for Skylanders either if you really think about it.
5273524	5276506	Well, they do because it has to expand the games.
5277086	5279267	They didn't need a little Big Planet 2, Loki.
5279828	5280928	They'll find a way.
5281249	5281729	Come on.
5282729	5283590	They'll find a way.
5283950	5284310	All right.
5285231	5286772	All the content's on the disc anyway.
5287612	5292235	They're going to have to have a new edition in another year for the rest of the content.
5293120	5293320	True.
5293960	5299643	And we're going to find out about all the characters anyways for Disney Infinity because the content for this entire year is actually on the disc.
5300744	5304585	That is interesting too because you know people are going to hack the shit out of this game the minute it's out.
5304785	5312269	So anything they're trying to keep under wraps with Frozen, be ready for that to hit the internet the minute this game leaks.
5312529	5316472	It's going to be a little harder, though, because you need RFID stuff to do that.
5316492	5321855	But I don't know what they've done with Skylanders as far as rewriting RFID tags.
5321875	5323816	I'm sure that's possible.
5324036	5325597	I'm not really sure how they would do it.
5325717	5329860	It would be a little bit more complicated than just unlocking everything.
5330407	5331428	Hacker's going to hack.
5331608	5334932	I'm sure that they are, but I'm just saying it's a little bit more complicated.
5335632	5336633	Not everybody's going to be doing it.
5337955	5341038	The Ouya is getting a controller redesign.
5341058	5342319	I actually think it looks kind of cool.
5342700	5344602	Some people are saying the D-pad sucks.
5345282	5352690	Apparently, the grips on the analog sticks were not rubberized enough, so they kind of changed it and added a little rubberized top to it.
5353170	5361412	They also, I guess, are adjusting the touchpad sensitivity and moving the triggers closer to the body.
5361792	5367693	And the D-pad is now, instead of the circular D-pad, it's a cross-shaped D-pad.
5367753	5370174	And people are seeing the pictures and they're like, oh, it's terrible.
5370194	5372754	It looks like the Xbox 360 controller.
5372934	5375455	However, you're not looking at it close enough because actually the...
5376395	5382537	Um, circle part on there, the corners, you know, the little pie shaped stuff are actually attached to the controller.
5382917	5385998	The D-pad itself is the only thing that rocks in there.
5386618	5395200	Um, so it actually is a true D-pad and not like the Xbox 360 controller, which is kind of a, you know, D-pad on top of a circle and the whole thing rocks.
5395780	5397861	So, be interesting to see.
5397941	5399763	I'm still looking forward to my system in a couple months.
5399843	5401123	So, I mean, that'll be cool.
5401684	5403285	Bring it in.
5404586	5409689	And then, of course, the... I don't know if it's a sign of desperation, but...
5410822	5412622	Hey, get your friends to buy a Vita.
5413062	5414483	Because we need people to buy a Vita.
5414743	5422164	And if you do, you get $20 in PlayStation Network credit and 1,000 Sony Rewards points.
5423004	5428605	I don't really know what 1,000 Rewards points buys you, but cool, I guess.
5428985	5430865	I mean, some sort of referral program.
5431245	5436846	Kind of along the lines of that, actually, I'm thinking of selling my Vita because I'm just not playing anything on it.
5437046	5437447	You know what?
5437467	5438107	You may have a buyer.
5438707	5439487	So, I don't know.
5439807	5440207	We'll see.
5440905	5442169	Still waiting for a Grand Theft Auto game?
5442631	5443273	Stop waiting.
5443955	5444557	It's not coming.
5446934	5451975	Speaking of Grand Theft Auto, second half of May, from what I hear, is supposed to be coming out.
5452815	5453536	That makes sense.
5453956	5456056	Right in time for school to be out, so all the kids can go home and play.
5456076	5456976	Yeah, because we were bothering them.
5457016	5460637	We were on a conference call at Take-Two, and they were, hey, so what's it coming out?
5460897	5461998	And they're all, second half of May.
5462738	5465978	At least that's where it's targeted right now.
5467159	5472260	They're looking at a new build of it next week, and assuming that everything's up to snuff, it'll be the second half.
5472900	5475681	At the end of February, they're going to be announcing collector's editions.
5476322	5480483	One for $79.99, one for $134.99 to $149.99.
5480683	5483144	They don't know what's in there yet.
5483565	5484485	But you didn't hear that here.
5484585	5488987	But then again, it doesn't take a rock of scientists to guess, oh, they'll probably be collector's editions.
5489047	5489987	Yeah, of course.
5490047	5491788	Long-awaited games always have collector's editions.
5491868	5492228	Of course.
5492248	5493489	The time frame makes sense.
5494009	5496530	None of this is unreasonable news.
5496610	5497290	I'm still begging.
5497550	5498110	Still begging.
5499711	5503713	My boss will take me, but Destination PlayStation, I'm going to have a playable build of it.
5504514	5505834	I want to play that game!
5506575	5507095	Of course you do.
5507115	5510997	I'm like, listen, you asshole, you're going to bring me to... You're bringing me down there.
5511357	5512198	That'll win you, fans.
5512618	5517861	All right, going to a game that Loki's not playing, but if he had a Wii U, he might be playing this.
5518341	5527986	Zombie U. So news this week, the Zombie U originally had intended to have a co-op mode, but it was shelved pretty early into development, which kind of makes sense.
5528727	5534733	Producer of the game said that we thought we could not deliver it on time.
5535453	5540098	How to bring a cooperative experience and still keep fear and tension is a question we would love to address, though.
5540979	5545324	So, probably in Zombie U2, which I think is inevitable at this point, but we'll see.
5546785	5549408	I always wanted to see that band as a zombie.
5551827	5555630	Shut up.
5555650	5562214	300,000 survivors apparently have died so far in ZombiU, according to the servers at Ubisoft.
5564735	5565176	There you go.
5565616	5567377	Well, they're no longer survivors now, aren't they?
5568143	5584830	Alright, moving on to some interesting news about the Wii U. Apparently, your Wii Shop purchases will not earn you Club Nintendo coins on Wii U. In other words, these two stores are very separate.
5585850	5594494	If you transfer your Wii content to the Wii U and you buy WiiWare Virtual Console games on the Wii U's Wii Mode, you don't get Wii U coins out of that.
5595174	5600017	because, face it, Nintendos, Wii, and Wii U modes don't know how to talk to each other.
5600377	5614445	Loki, you and I were chatting before the show about this, and I don't remember which one of us said it, but we were joking about this whole $1.50 upgrade is probably going to be something, you know, like if you want to get an upgrade to your game and play it on the Wii U. Yeah, exactly.
5614485	5614905	Thanks for watching!
5637834	5640755	And we were joking about that they'll probably be in the Wii mode.
5640795	5645717	There will be the Wii U Virtual Console upgrade channel that will actually transfer it.
5646438	5654741	I was saying you'll probably have to buy the upgrade in the Wii Virtual Console because Nintendo doesn't know how to get the two things to talk to each other.
5654781	5655841	They don't know online.
5656582	5660864	It's not so much that the Wii can't talk to the Wii U part of the device, but it's the online part.
5661124	5665165	Like, Nintendo can't figure out how to hook up your Wii and Wii U accounts.
5665726	5666366	They can't do it.
5667426	5668787	This proves they can't do it.
5670349	5670549	Yeah.
5672110	5676714	And I made the joke that, you know, when you're doing the upgrade, you know how they have the little loading screen stuff?
5676734	5679836	It's going to be a little Pikmin running into your wallet and snatching a dollar out.
5681017	5681417	Kind of funny.
5681938	5683759	And then I said, stop being funny when we're not on air.
5684099	5684339	I know.
5685440	5685880	There you go.
5685980	5686981	I don't make the point to do that.
5687281	5687621	All right.
5688042	5691164	Well, this is a game that's available on virtual console on the 3DS, I know.
5691744	5692244	Xevious.
5692865	5706514	There's a 30th anniversary tribute album paying homage to the original soundtrack of the shooter and lots of different game composers that are contributing to this soundtrack.
5706574	5711057	It is going to be out January 29th on iTunes through Namco Sounds.
5711617	5712118	Very cool.
5712138	5714539	There's some previews up on YouTube if you want to check that out.
5715180	5717481	I didn't realize that game was turning 30 years old.
5717842	5718242	Yeesh.
5718442	5719142	How does it feel to be old?
5720864	5721024	Old.
5722925	5724066	DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
5724744	5725625	I got some stuff.
5727166	5729907	First of all, this is sad news.
5729967	5734970	The composer for Heavy Rain, Norman Corbell, died at 56 years old.
5736431	5743095	He was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer on August 15, 2012.
5743295	5746978	This was posted on the 27th and he died at 2.56pm that day.
5747018	5747618	So that's very sad news.
5754013	5756135	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5772871	5774131	I mean, it is super funny.
5775031	5785354	But this one was actually, the interesting thing about this is that the Minecraft guy, Marcus Person, actually donated $2,000 to this project.
5785434	5788974	So it's got the approval of our Minecraft dude.
5789434	5790735	And it's on Steam, so go get it.
5792515	5798916	And then in other news, someone didn't link me the story.
5801477	5801817	There we go.
5802486	5803747	I was like, I'm looking right at it.
5803787	5804907	I found it, shush.
5806688	5811130	Resident Evil 6 PC is going to come with some bonus stuff.
5811190	5818273	It comes with the Mercenaries No Mercy mode, which is a time attack with waves of enemies.
5819334	5821835	And we'll see how well people do on that one.
5821935	5829379	And also, I believe that after that you'll be able to buy the MIA Siege mode DLC.
5830479	5831680	So there you go.
5831900	5838023	It's going to be, well, at least in Europe, it's going to be €19.99 or €29.99.
5839884	5842365	So who knows what will be here?
5842825	5843285	Expensive.
5844706	5845106	All right.
5845566	5849928	Let's go to a part of the show we call the Fugle Question of the Week.
5850328	5851369	Well, that's a funny word.
5851429	5855411	Well, what we did, we smashed the word Facebook and Google together and we got Fugle.
5856566	5883660	I believe the term is a portmanteau bless you alright Voogle question of the week going to the question we asked this week which is in a follow up to something we talked about earlier in the show with the whole Dead Space 3 and the fact that you will be able to buy some of these guns with real money because of mobile phone gamers are to blame for this
5884700	5894074	So we asked our Facebook and Google community members this week, have you ever bought a microtransaction in a console game of something you could have used in-game currency to unlock?
5894194	5894775	Why or why not?
5895578	5902582	Do you think this sort of mobile, and I put that in quotes, design in games is a good thing or a bad thing?
5903143	5904204	We'll start with Google tonight.
5905024	5910748	Critical Myth says, I've never knowingly done so, but sometimes it's hard to tell with costumes and weapons and so on.
5911068	5913730	But if it's single player, I don't think it matters one way or the other.
5913750	5918813	I do think it's BS when multiplayer items go for sale in that manner for obvious reasons.
5920532	5921273	Thanks for watching!
5937143	5941087	It doesn't... I mean, because it's all co-op, it doesn't necessarily throw the game out of whack.
5941567	5947312	But I kind of... I think the obvious reasons you state there are probably more in the head-to-head multiplayer games.
5947852	5948813	That's my guess anyway.
5949994	5950275	Anyhow.
5951736	5952316	More answers.
5952376	5953778	Red Entertainment on Google Plus says...
5955458	5959339	Yes, I've paid real monies for games and items I could earn in-game.
5959399	5962600	I didn't do this because I'm used to doing so by prior experience.
5962740	5965381	I did this because of the general philosophy I have towards things.
5965841	5969742	I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want to expediently.
5971262	5975383	Flaco Jones says, I've never paid for something that I could earn normally in a console game.
5975443	5982505	I mean, with guides and FAQs freely available on the internet to show you where every last item is hidden and how to get it, it seems like it would be a waste of money.
5984778	5986440	Going to Facebook and some of the answers there.
5986520	5992485	James S. If they incorporate a way for you to obtain the items by collecting in-game currency, then whatever.
5992826	5996729	This is just one of the many evolutions of the gaming industry in today's troublesome economy.
5997130	6001314	We all must take the necessary steps in order to keep our heads above water.
6001674	6005037	Whether or not that means pissing some people off in the process.
6005457	6006178	It's a business.
6006438	6006999	Deal with it.
6008649	6010892	Hmm, I don't know.
6012194	6016819	I think folks will deal with it when they stop buying the games, but regardless.
6016900	6022987	Again, the mobile phone logic is you only paid 99 cents for the game in the first place, not 60.
6023368	6025410	That's the big discrepancy here.
6025691	6025951	Anyway.
6027192	6027813	Joe Videa says,
6055826	6065447	again though if the extra pretties are something that takes away from the core game then it doesn't matter don't want to spend the money on it then don't some people like to collect all the pretties though let them waste their money on what they want
6066903	6070066	AKVG Games replies and says,
6088341	6093605	There's more to that, but I can't read all of these answers, so please check out the full-length responses on Facebook.
6094566	6101691	RedTheHaze replies and says, There was a console game I avoided because of the microtransactions, and that was Gotham City Imposters.
6102112	6106175	The game was $15 and had the option to purchase upgrades which could be unlocked in the game.
6106775	6110358	I would have no problem with it, but it took too much time to unlock the upgrades.
6110738	6112600	It resulted with unbalanced gameplay...
6113300	6114061	Gossip City Impostors
6132654	6133534	I don't remember if it did.
6133734	6134635	Did I not call that?
6135275	6136015	I thought it did.
6136375	6137096	I could be wrong.
6137196	6137656	I could be wrong.
6137676	6139357	I'm just saying, I called it.
6139377	6141638	15 is still pretty cheap, but... Anyhow.
6142158	6145940	Burr replies and says, Most microtransactions feel like paying for cheat codes.
6146080	6147841	Why the hell are we paying for cheat codes?
6148281	6156105	It feels like insult heaped upon injury considering that on today's consoles we can no longer cheat in our games because of achievements, trophies, etc.
6156726	6160147	I think that comment really hits the nail on the head to what I think.
6160227	6161048	And we were talking...
6161548	6190048	earlier in the show about the whole like SimCity and how that's all changed I think this is right up the alley of why that all went down that way Degenerate Johnny said honestly I think it all depends on the player I personally have no partook in microtransactions in games with the exception of wow damn that sparkly horse however I do see that there's a growing market for them as games are becoming progressively longer and more frequent it makes life harder for the completionist to master the game in time for the next game to be released and
6190348	6193169	Even the most skillful players have a rough time keeping up.
6193570	6196331	These microtransactions help save time for these players.
6196411	6197792	And again, this one continues as well.
6198252	6200173	But here's my question.
6200653	6205315	How does the sparkly horse help you save time?
6205335	6209197	I guess technically you don't have to buy a flying mount if you have one.
6209617	6220520	Wait, wasn't it that it used to be that if you bought one of the mounts with faster speed, naturally, that you automatically unlocked Master Flying?
6221500	6222461	Not the Uber.
6222521	6224241	No, you still have to pay for Flying.
6224421	6235304	Well, no, not paying for Flying, but I thought that it was right before they patched it out that if you had... Yes, if you get the in-game achievement for the Violet Drake, you would automatically unlock the 310 Flying.
6235464	6235704	Yeah.
6235804	6237004	Yeah, that's been patched out since.
6237024	6237104	Okay.
6239905	6243047	Andy R said, I've bought plenty of DLC, mostly rock band.
6243147	6251171	See, I appreciate the answers, but the Sparkly Horse and rock band songs aren't necessarily things you can unlock with in-game money.
6251632	6254093	And that's a key difference, too.
6254393	6259256	And the reason why I wanted to draw that distinction, especially with rock band, is that it's so different.
6259716	6270720	Like when you're actually paying for a song that is new and you understand that licensing goes into getting that song in the game and so forth, it's very different for me.
6271780	6276081	While Andy R agrees, I draw the line when it is something unlockable in the game.
6276141	6276842	Alright, there you go.
6277402	6279883	I think it's mostly because I'm stingy about that kind of thing.
6279943	6283644	I have no problems buying add-ons to a game I'm enjoying throughout.
6283664	6285604	I think that's a good way to put it, add-ons.
6286325	6286925	And lastly...
6288010	6292914	Anomalous Underdog says, no, the only DLC I ever bought was more songs for Rocksmith.
6293315	6297759	DLC that adds substantially new content is the only kind of DLC I'm ever willing to buy.
6298119	6303164	Rock Band, Rocksmith, Guitar Hero, it's all, it's, it's all, hell, DDR.
6303524	6304745	They're all the same, honestly.
6305346	6308248	So, except when the DDR songs were on the disc.
6308308	6311831	That was a little more shady, a little bit shady, a little bit.
6313174	6314215	Thank you for all the questions.

6327264	6333849	All right, let's get back into some more news, and we already started to talk about one of these a minute ago, Loki, right?
6334549	6335149	Yes, yes.
6336110	6338912	So lots of Nintendo news.
6339432	6343134	Basically, they had another Nintendo Direct.
6345069	6346170	I don't know what you want to call it.
6346550	6348913	It's not really a press conference, but video that they made.
6350955	6359763	They talked about a few game announcements and releases and then showed you some stuff, I guess.
6360864	6361245	I don't know.
6361345	6367351	I'm a little hesitant on everything that I saw just because we don't know when a lot of this stuff is coming out.
6367891	6384704	but let's just go over what they talked about so first things first um one of the big announcements was that they're gonna do an HD remake of Legends of Zelda Wind Waker and it's gonna have better graphics and gonna be on the Wii U and have all the Wii U stuff it's supposed to be coming out this fall
6387176	6390320	So, neat, although I'm not that excited about it.
6390440	6398972	Even though Wind Waker is a pretty fun game, and I really do like Wind Waker, I actually thought that the new graphics don't look good.
6399993	6400674	It's too much bloom.
6401961	6412888	Um, this was one of those announcements where it wasn't really surprising, and it's funny because I got into a debate with somebody on Facebook about this, about that I didn't really feel a lot of this news that came out of Nintendo was that surprising.
6413468	6415669	And, like, it's like, well, how could you have called Wind Waker?
6415769	6416870	And I'm like, well, there's a difference.
6417290	6420392	It's not that I predicted it or I knew it was coming.
6420452	6421653	Like, that's not what I'm talking about.
6421993	6425095	When I heard the news that Wind Waker was coming out, I did more one of those...
6425655	6426736	Oh yeah, that makes sense.
6427076	6429759	Yeah, actually, yeah, why didn't we see this coming?
6429779	6432861	Because they always do a Zelda remake for consoles these days, it seems.
6433242	6435944	We had the new Zelda on, you know, 3DS.
6436504	6440047	We had a Mario remake launch the original DS.
6440488	6445672	We had Zelda on Game Boy Advance that was, you know, cross-playable.
6445973	6450857	You know, the Zelda that launched the Wii was essentially a GameCube Zelda game, but, you know, with the controls.
6451537	6458324	You know, this whole reimagining of previous Zelda games isn't exactly a new territory for Nintendo.
6458564	6462708	No, and I always thought that they would be doing HD remakes of games.
6462728	6466151	I thought it would be Wii games that they would do HD remakes of.
6466832	6468673	And I guess Mario GameCube games close enough.
6469174	6469835	Here's the thing, though.
6471016	6473158	They also said they're working on another Zelda game.
6474299	6474499	But...
6475949	6477610	Just like, hey, we're working on Smash Bros.
6478550	6481931	Grass is green, Pope is Catholic, bear shit in woods.
6482631	6484452	We don't know when it's coming out.
6485092	6487353	I would say at least next year, not later.
6488634	6489674	Super Smash Bros.
6490914	6493595	for the Wii U and 3DS is supposed to be showcased at E3.
6494636	6495936	Doesn't say coming out this year, though.
6496336	6497837	I like to point that out.
6499498	6511245	They showed a video for the Yoshi game, that alleged Yoshi game that we saw in the debug menus and stuff on the whole Wii U community thing.
6512766	6514928	It's done in the style of Kirby's Epic Yarn.
6517096	6517336	Cool.
6518397	6522041	No mentioning when that's coming out, but they're working on it.
6523503	6531651	Also, very briefly in a video, a new game from Monolith Soft that looks sort of like Xenoblade for the Wii U.
6533300	6537863	Once again, that was OK of all the various announcements made.
6538043	6550890	That one was more one where it's like it was like, yay, because clearly, you know, Xenoblade had kind of a rough transition going from Japan to the US and, you know, all the stuff that went with that.
6551330	6558033	But it came out and that kind of shows that, OK, maybe Nintendo's putting a little more stock in this than they did when it was originally on the Wii.
6558474	6562396	So that piece of news was like got a smile out of me.
6564464	6567987	One that I was kind of, I don't know, it was a little weird.
6568387	6570789	Shimogami Tensei Crossfire Emblem.
6573030	6573451	Interesting.
6573591	6576853	Yeah, that was the one where I was like, now that's a surprise.
6577353	6580155	That's, okay, cool, cool.
6580736	6581316	I'm with you here.
6582017	6582477	That was cool.
6583041	6584903	I'm going to tell you right now, that's not going to sell very well.
6585404	6588066	Just because you've got two very niche franchises.
6588246	6592851	I mean, Fire Emblem, there are rabid fans for it, but let's be honest.
6594153	6596014	Your soccer moms are not going to be buying this game.
6596074	6600539	Well, but maybe the expectations and the budget aren't that high.
6600639	6606225	Because, I mean, by that logic, they would have stopped making Fire Emblem games a long time ago, but they haven't.
6606445	6635969	so I suppose that audience as small as it may be or as niche as it may be is enough to substantiate this happening I hope they're right no the soccer moms won't buy this but that's not who Nintendo needed to talk to with this little press conference thing they did either this wasn't a soccer mom conference if Reggie Fils-Aimé wanted to talk to the soccer moms he'd go on Ellen they announced that the Miiverse is coming to smartphones so you can be able to browse the Miiverse stuff on there
6637846	6640548	Now, that was surprising and not surprising at the same time.
6640768	6644629	Because, you know, you're like, oh, holy shit, a Nintendo app on the iPhone.
6644649	6649852	But then you're like, oh, yeah, the investors have been, like, breathing down their fucking necks to do something on the iPhone.
6650132	6654514	You know, the Pokemon company finally did their thing, you know, for what it's worth on the iPhone.
6656355	6658036	This is to appease investors.
6658176	6660077	This is Nintendo's move to appease investors.
6660377	6660837	That's what this is.
6660857	6665440	I just hope it's good because they sure as hell don't know how to code anything for the internet.
6665540	6665840	Well...
6666974	6673178	Me-verse is one of the more fascinating features of the Wii U. I guess we'll leave it at that.
6675460	6676621	Pleasant surprises.
6676761	6677662	That's a good way to put it.
6677762	6685167	It's a pleasant surprise on the Wii U. This summer, we're going to be getting a sequel to Wii Party, a party game that no one fucking bought.
6688055	6689437	Well, now, wait a minute, Loki.
6689477	6695923	I'm calling you out on this because you just said, here's one that soccer moms won't give a shit about, yet now here's WeParty.
6696264	6697685	You know who did buy that game?
6698566	6699107	No one.
6699267	6700168	No, soccer moms.
6700228	6701089	Nobody bought it.
6701249	6701649	Trust me.
6701850	6702931	I had to sell this game.
6703251	6704773	Nobody fucking bought it.
6705774	6707576	It was just like, is it Mario Party?
6707896	6708096	Nope.
6708276	6708797	Don't care.
6710278	6712540	I don't know why they would make a sequel to a game that didn't sell.
6712620	6713701	Because it's Nintendo.
6713761	6715022	They'll do whatever they want.
6715082	6716923	I mean, it's minimal effort.
6717663	6724328	But one of the big things that they were touting with this is that you'll be able to do two-player gameplay on the gamepad.
6724968	6726530	And you'll be able to basically just...
6727594	6734999	Kind of like how they showed some of the demos and stuff that you could do, like stuff where you can play air hockey or whatever on the gamepad.
6735579	6739841	Although, explain to me how that's going to fucking work since it doesn't have multi-touch.
6740682	6749407	WeParty, VGCharts.com, 1.67 million in North America, 3.27 million in Europe.
6749467	6751268	This is games being made for Europe.
6751629	6753590	North America sold less than Japan, too.
6753990	6757132	But 1.67 is nothing to bat your eyelashes at, so...
6757540	6760401	Yeah, I wonder how many of those were after the game dropped down to nothing.
6762201	6764182	Would you like me to look at the week-by-week detail?
6764242	6764902	Yes, I would.
6765102	6766123	I'd love to.
6766443	6767083	Let's take a peek.
6767503	6768823	I can tell you that no one bought that.
6770004	6773065	Well, again, Europe was the biggest selling region for that game.
6773225	6774165	Which is really odd.
6774405	6776646	Did they not get a Mario Party game over there or something?
6777206	6777546	I don't know.
6777606	6779667	Maybe it's just different strokes for different folks, right?
6779767	6780087	Let's see.
6780127	6781887	I'm trying to bring it up here week-by-week.
6783388	6783888	Nah.
6785639	6786140	Keep going.
6786160	6786960	I'll figure it out.
6787300	6787540	All right.
6788041	6792824	And then, of course, one of the announcements was the whole Virtual Console trial thing.
6794645	6800288	The highest amount of sales were the week of November 27th, but that's the Black Friday week in 2010.
6800328	6800568	It did sell...
6805291	6806232	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6824789	6842394	So, the Virtual Console Trial Program basically kind of gets you guys hooked on buying Virtual Console games for the Wii U. You would be able to purchase, they're going to have 30 cent games and they're going to be available for 30 days, basically a month for each.
6842814	6869007	so the first one of course for January was Balloon Fight and then for February they're going to have F-Zero March is Punch Out featuring Mr. Dream, April Kirby's Adventure, May Super Metroid June Yoshi and July Donkey Kong and 30 cents each and you know if you don't buy them during that time frame then you're going to have to pay the $1 or $1.50 to upgrade them or you know not
6872548	6873589	Why is it so hard?
6897483	6898503	Thanks for watching!
6916010	6917251	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6941563	6947069	and thank fuck, finally, you don't have to put your TV into 4.3 mode.
6947889	6952774	It will finally, like it knows to scrunch down the image of the picture to be appropriate.
6952834	6955837	It's not all stretched like the Wii Virtual Console was.
6955997	6957578	Thank God, finally.
6958119	6963264	But again, are those two things enough to really substantiate a buck fifty upgrade?
6964265	6967727	Remember, and that's not $1.50 for the game, people.
6968248	6971150	That's $1.50 when you already dropped seven or eight on it.
6971430	6972872	That's my big sticking point.
6973192	6974073	People are forgetting.
6974133	6976274	We already paid a decent amount of money.
6976294	6983060	And the reason that they're doing that, they claim, is because there's no... Well, the reason we think is because there's no real way to link them.
6983470	6985952	Yet, at the same time, there's no real way to link it.
6986932	6995638	When they not know that you've already purchased it and wouldn't charge you just the $1.50, so they do know that you bought it, the least they could do is, hey, you know what?
6996639	6997559	You bought these games.
6997780	6998300	I'll tell you what.
6999060	6999741	You import them over.
7001042	7004944	When those downloads become available, you get the Wii U version for free.
7005685	7007006	I mean, really, what are they missing out on?
7007146	7007506	A dollar?
7008046	7008867	I mean, come on.
7009748	7010808	Just do that.
7010908	7013270	It would show some really, you know, hey, you know what?
7014691	7015753	Network Multiplayer
7031169	7032090	How hard is that?
7032810	7034771	I guess too laggy or something.
7035251	7036812	It's hard to build netcode in emulators.
7037072	7040434	Oh, but wait, they already did that shit on PC.
7040854	7047657	Homebrew emulators have netcode where you can play games over the internet.
7048278	7048878	Multiplayer.
7049178	7050859	Oh, go fake.
7050959	7055541	If only the company that fucking made the games could come up with netcode.
7055981	7059223	Oh, but that would be asking them to embrace the internet and they don't fucking understand yet.
7062523	7062843	Is that it?
7063183	7063443	That's it.
7063664	7063984	Oh, okay.
7064244	7064524	I'm done.
7066045	7066905	I wasn't sure if there was more.
7067425	7067705	All right.
7068025	7080171	Well, let's move on with something else about the Wii U. And a very interesting comment that was made this week by Crystal Dynamics, who, of course, as you know, are making the Wii U...
7081431	7110120	or excuse me they're not making the Wii that was the comment Crystal Dynamics is making Tomb Raider and the comment was about a Wii U version of Tomb Raider because you know why not we had you know Batman Arkham City and you know these other games that were Mass Effect 3 were ported to Wii U so where's our Tomb Raider port to the Wii U and you know if creative director Noah Hughes if you try to read between the lines of what he said here it's probably not happening
7111061	7112743	I'm always a fan of Nintendo systems.
7112783	7119030	In particular, they really push interface design, and from a game design perspective, it's fun to play with the new interfaces.
7119251	7122975	So there's the nice little, like, I'm going to say something nice, and then here's the but.
7123195	7129123	But, having said that, it's something that I think we would want to tailor the experience to if we were going to do it.
7129523	7138709	and currently we're offering it on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC and all three of those are really trying to deliver roughly the same experience but delivered best on each platform.
7139050	7148216	I think something like the Wii U often asks you to do something unique based on a unique interface so that's something as a gamer I love but it's something that you don't want to do half-heartedly as a developer.
7149733	7163851	so in other words they don't want to try and at least what I'm hearing in here they don't want to try and put Tomb Raider on the Wii U when it wasn't really designed with the Wii U in mind when there's something extra going on there and I say makes sense to me yeah
7165037	7186023	You know, maybe there's somewhere else where Lara Croft can fit on the Wii U You know, there were those games, the Xbox Live, thank you, the Guardian of Light, the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade games I bet one of those games could be done very well on the Wii U If they wanted to do that, I don't know
7186603	7199170	I just think it's really late for them to, they've been working on Tomb Raider for a while, it's probably late to them to make a port and it might not be that beneficial because they're worried that the numbers aren't there yet to support that.
7199370	7200931	No, makes sense to me, I get it.
7202372	7214378	So, and I honestly, I think the people that want to play Tomb Raider probably already have, are the types of people that already have Xbox, Playstation 3 or a PC, you know, like PC's a pretty big market, you know.
7215507	7217308	Anyhow, let's move on with more news.
7217388	7217908	DarkSakura.
7219029	7225893	Well, this is the news we've been waiting for and it's already been all over the place and I'm sure everyone knows about it, but this is super, super awesome.
7225973	7237499	Basically, we talked last week about how Jonathan Coulton had been kind of shafted, well actually really shafted when it came to Glee's treatment of his cover of Baby Got Back.
7238354	7247770	So now, even though there's still some legal research going on with this what he's done is re-released his original as a cover of a cover of his cover
7249392	7256315	So now it's listed on iTunes, Amazon, and Google Play as Baby Got Back in the style of Glee.
7257636	7258656	And I paid for it.
7258716	7259677	I mean, it's a good cause.
7259777	7262938	But basically what's going to happen with this, he's using the same license he had before.
7263759	7275684	So after basically Sir Mix-a-Lot gets paid, then the proceeds, and iTunes, then any other proceeds are going to be donated to the VH1 Save the Music Foundation and the It Gets Better Project.
7276344	7282990	Which roundaboutly goes back to Glee because they're also sending donations to that.
7283910	7290876	Yeah, a lot of the comments I've been reading is that Glee is supposed to be all anti-bullying and stuff, but what is Fox doing to JoCo in this case?
7290896	7291917	Pretty much, yeah.
7291937	7293038	It's kind of sick.
7293198	7295380	I mean, it comes down to the bottom line, it's all about greed.
7296308	7298590	You know who the real winner is in this scenario, though?
7299030	7299651	Sir Mix-a-Lot.
7299871	7300091	Yeah.
7300111	7301852	I was like, dude, all this money.
7302633	7305916	Who's given Sir Mix-a-Lot any thought recently, you know?
7306156	7306816	Seriously.
7306937	7308338	Like, what's the last thing he's done?
7308458	7310820	That guy's like, thank God I can pay the rent this month.
7311400	7316804	No, he's actually, to tell you the truth, he's actually still been, I think he did, like, a lot of producing.
7317525	7318766	Yeah, I wouldn't doubt it.
7318846	7319687	That's what happens to a lot of those.
7319707	7322949	But honestly, the last Sir Mix-a-Lot song that ever came out that I gave a damn about was Buttermilk Biscuits.
7323270	7323490	Huh.
7324010	7324891	So, just saying.
7325886	7328248	Game Guru in our chatroom says, Coverception.
7330310	7334653	He needs to actually be knighted, and then he can really be Sir Mix-a-Lot.
7336754	7338776	Because that would be awesome.
7340737	7341118	I love it.
7341178	7342299	Why can't we have that happen?
7343119	7343499	I don't know.
7343519	7345181	Write the Queen of England and suggest that.
7345281	7346742	Oh yeah, he's not English, for one.
7346762	7348003	Who cares?
7348043	7348643	Whatever.
7348984	7350084	We'll make an exception.
7350104	7351045	Make an exception.
7351345	7353407	I think that actually non-Englishmen can be knighted.
7354608	7354888	Okay.
7355589	7357131	I'd have to double check it, but I think so.
7357552	7361637	Well, maybe Sir Mix-a-Lot can just be an ambassador, you know, if it's good enough for something.
7361677	7363239	How about we just call him Mr. Mix-a-Lot?
7363960	7364801	Mr. Mix-a-Lot?
7365582	7368065	The ambassador to large posteriors.
7369848	7370489	Bootyvania.
7373644	7375445	Alright, moving on, Loki.
7376565	7381387	Alright, so... This guy, I don't know what to do.
7381847	7384848	Seriously, can these people get voted out of office already?
7385148	7386108	I mean, seriously?
7386548	7388229	Senator Leland Yee.
7388729	7391270	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7406378	7410139	I'm sure he's trying to pass another anti-gaming law or something like that.
7412139	7422942	I think this is in response to all the voices you're hearing in the community about, hey, stop blaming us for that sick stuff that happened at Sandy Hook.
7423122	7427082	I think that's where he's saying gamers need to kind of be quiet.
7427202	7429083	And it's like, no, you be quiet.
7429663	7429863	Yeah.
7430143	7431003	No, you shut up!
7462091	7464615	By the way, I do have an expansion for what I just said.
7465596	7471845	Anybody can be knighted, but they can't accept a peerage unless they renounce their current citizenship.
7472647	7473247	So, just saying.
7473408	7475350	Well, Leland Yee should certainly not be knighted.
7475811	7476793	No, he should be set on fire.
7477967	7478928	I mean, did I say that out loud?
7478968	7479569	I'm sorry.
7479709	7480490	Metaphorically.
7480570	7481951	He needs to be fired.
7482312	7482592	Yes.
7482912	7483273	Fired.
7483373	7483893	Much better.
7484454	7486937	Well, he ran for mayor of San Francisco, if I remember right.
7486957	7487437	He didn't get it.
7487858	7489740	He can be smothered in a bag of dicks.
7490641	7491241	Metaphorically.
7491422	7491962	Metaphorically.
7492983	7493924	I just, I don't know.
7494185	7494425	I mean...
7497100	7502505	There's just a lot of ignorant people out there, and they're only getting older.
7502785	7504226	Can you say that quote from him, too?
7504306	7505027	What was that again?
7505147	7516437	Gamers need to... It wasn't gamers need to shut up, but gamers need to... Gamers have just got to quiet down, and then gamers have no credibility in this argument.
7516757	7516917	What?
7519983	7523525	Yes, let me make your job easier in passing these unconstitutional laws.
7523725	7524746	Let me just quiet down.
7524886	7534051	Why don't I just ignore the First Amendment that gives me the right to call you out on your hate spewing and misjudgment of our community?
7534231	7537413	Hey, you people of color, why don't you just quiet down?
7537853	7540495	We don't need to pass these equality laws or anything.
7540535	7540955	Why don't you just...
7541235	7542956	Stop complaining.
7543136	7544596	Hey, gays, shut up.
7544836	7548217	Yes, seriously, gays, just stop complaining.
7548457	7550338	Let them throw you in trash cans.
7550678	7551859	Bag is just a word.
7551879	7554139	I'm just trying to do my job here, okay?
7554219	7555280	Passing these laws.
7555580	7556260	But you know what?
7556740	7561041	Women get the same thing too because we're told we're not able to decide what goes on with our girl bits.
7562762	7564926	I'm sorry, you don't have a vag, you can't talk about it.
7565447	7566408	That's what I think.
7566629	7568051	And I say the same thing to the non-gamers.
7568432	7569914	You don't game, you're not allowed to talk about it.
7569954	7572058	Are you saying Leland Yee should play a video game?
7572198	7573340	Yes, I think he should.
7573360	7576565	I mean, he can't grow a vag, but at least he can pick up a controller.
7579420	7581702	I mean, I guess we could arrange that in some surgery.
7609440	7610241	Custard's Revenge
7636645	7638326	I love this comment, and I think we'll end with this.
7638406	7641048	Legend of Zaku in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
7641248	7644410	Leland Yee channeling his inner Marie Antoinette.
7644991	7646252	Go eat cake, gamers.
7648413	7649334	Very well spoken.
7649854	7651515	But we all know what happened to Marie Antoinette.
7652236	7652856	Metaphorically.
7653637	7656198	No, she got... It really happened to her.
7656478	7659080	And besides that, though, I think that... I think he...
7660581	7663783	I've got my inner history nerd is totally just screaming.
7663803	7664304	Let it go, girl.
7664344	7664664	Let it go.
7664704	7665344	I'll just tell them to chat.
7665985	7666665	Okay.
7667626	7675852	See what you're missing by not being at live.vognetwork.com Well, if you think it's just Leland Yee, you're wrong.
7676932	7681796	More light gun games and gun games disappearing after more complaints.
7685151	7685331	Wake up!
7704571	7705771	You're getting blamed for this.
7706352	7719737	You, who might not even be into some of these video games, you as a gamer, as somebody who sought out this podcast and downloaded it knowing we talked about video games, you are a gamer one way or the other.
7721057	7722838	I'm 99.9% sure you are.
7723238	7727760	You are being blamed for this tragedy that happened back east.
7728901	7729641	Wake up.
7730041	7732202	Don't forget about the other people who are getting blamed for it too.
7735077	7735377	Are they?
7735457	7736237	Well, yes.
7736758	7739919	But let's... I mean, like, movies and TV and so forth.
7739959	7745581	It seems like a lot of that is getting... No, I'm talking about autism spectrum people who are also getting shafted out of the whole thing, too.
7745701	7746721	Yes, that's very true.
7746821	7747782	You know who's to blame?
7748942	7751163	It's that damn show, Grey's Anatomy.
7751743	7752003	It is.
7752644	7753304	It's to blame.
7753624	7753864	It is.
7754044	7754844	It's Glee's fault.
7754864	7756585	There's so much violence on that show.
7756645	7758046	Blood and guts everywhere.
7758266	7759346	And sex.
7759926	7761947	There's sexing on that show.
7762767	7764228	Glee taught me how to steal.
7766347	7769190	I robbed a 7-Eleven because Glee said it was okay to steal.
7769210	7771812	Hey, I pirated all that music because Glee made it okay.
7772132	7773813	Fox is saying, hey, this is what we do.
7774854	7780098	We copy that floppy until the cows come home.
7780839	7781319	You know what?
7781419	7782700	Hey, what are you going to do about it?
7782720	7784842	You should be happy that I'm listening to your music.
7784862	7789846	Why don't you go make some more music so I can steal that too?
7792896	7793517	Don't have a headache now.
7809279	7813642	Our first email comes from, I mispronounced the name, Ramaditya.
7814122	7815443	Hi guys, this is Ramaditya.
7816544	7820647	This month I tried to give you pictures from my wedding, but unfortunately Facebook blocked your access.
7821047	7824830	Now I would like to share one of the greatest parts of my marriage ceremony, the Star Wars wedding party.
7825690	7829893	It's actually a YouTube video, so we really can't pull it up and watch it right now during the show.
7830734	7833997	This is the first three minutes where actually my greetings and preparation.
7834377	7837819	You may watch the duel in front of the audience when you reach the middle part of the video.
7838220	7842563	I hope this will inspire other fellow gamers to do something unique to their unforgettable events in life.
7843704	7846386	See, Dan and I, when we got married, we just went to the courthouse.
7846686	7849048	And then he made faces at me, and I punched him.
7850529	7852310	I punched him in the arm and told him to knock it off.
7853411	7854112	That was my wedding.
7855228	7856209	Thank you for sharing it with us.
7869944	7870825	Um, next email.
7870885	7871706	Good day, OLR.
7871766	7873868	Thank you so much for reading my email on the show.
7874008	7875670	I can't believe you guys are still on the air.
7876030	7876590	Neither can we.
7876791	7877751	Neither can we.
7878312	7881595	I've started listening from the beginning and it's brought back some outstanding memories.
7881695	7885579	I apologize if this runs a little long, but I first heard the show in a rather unusual way.
7885699	7889843	It was at an old glow-in-the-dark bowling alley double arcade owned by the nicest group of people I've ever met.
7890663	7894907	What I mean by double arcade is... Somebody was playing this show at a bowling alley?
7895528	7895548	I...
7896589	7897029	Let me read it.
7897910	7899031	Let me read the damn email!
7899071	7900212	We say fucking shit.
7900812	7901773	Fuck, fuck, cock.
7902414	7902694	Okay.
7903314	7909600	What I mean by double arcade is that it was split into two adjoining rooms, each with their own genre of cabinets.
7909620	7911901	The first room was row after row of fighting games.
7912322	7913383	The other was the Bimani room.
7913843	7942779	That host near weekly tournaments of each and yearly Bimani Game Festival On the morning of said festival, I remember hearing a clip from your show talking about 2DX And loved hearing the host chat it up I completely forgot to ask about it, I was too excited waiting for Chorus K to arrive And I've been keeping an ear out ever since Just to a few weeks ago, while looking up a new WoW podcast to listen to I somehow ended up downloading an episode of Horde House The whole episode I kept thinking, boy this Rob Roberts guy sure sounds awfully damn familiar And then you eventually mentioned OLR
7944020	7948703	I downloaded the newest episode of that and voila, I've somehow managed to find my show all these years later.
7949184	7952946	So thank you so much for everything you do and have done for the last decade now.
7953326	7958570	You've reminded me of some just simply unbelievable memories of a place that got flooded years and years ago now.
7958670	7959130	Much love.
7959931	7960951	I guess it's Plagius?
7961132	7961512	Plagius?
7962970	7965291	Wow, Horde House did something good.
7966672	7967733	I'm teasing, I'm teasing.
7968153	7970074	That's pretty amazing.
7970174	7972796	Still, the whole bowling alley thing blows me away.
7972916	7976698	I have heard that this show gets played in some very interesting places.
7976958	7979480	I heard there was a GameStop that was playing this show somewhere.
7979540	7981221	And I'm like, can't you get in trouble for that?
7981241	7982802	Because we use naughty language.
7982822	7984503	I don't know if they were doing it after hours or what.
7984523	7985904	Are we talking about the evil G?
7986504	7987505	Yeah, right?
7988245	7989226	So it must have been after hours.
7989246	7989906	Oh, the irony.
7990306	7990907	It must have been.
7990967	7991287	I don't know.
7992327	7994229	That evil G must be Goodfellas.
7994309	7996210	Goodyear Tires, clearly.
7996230	7997070	Goodyear Tires.
7997150	7998511	Damn that Goodyear Tires.
7998551	8002113	Well, also, this was a few years ago before there was so much fuckery.
8002293	8003574	I mean, let's be real.
8003894	8008557	There was a time and place when that was a store we all went to regularly.
8008797	8009657	And my husband worked at.
8009798	8010278	Exactly.
8011038	8011639	It's different now.
8012099	8016863	I've heard of a LAN gaming center that was playing this show at one point, which, you know, that's pretty cool.
8017123	8017823	But yeah, bowling alley.
8018103	8022647	So I want to say to all the bowling alleys, how do you cheer on bowlers?
8023743	8024643	Roll the ball!
8025864	8026924	Knock the pin!
8027304	8028164	Go Turkey!
8028204	8029344	Get that turkey!
8029444	8030645	Clap, clap, clap.
8030705	8031165	I don't know.
8031325	8032845	I need J-Links.
8033265	8034766	J-Links, how do you cheer a bowler?
8034886	8039127	It makes me think of Global at... What the fuck is that?
8039607	8039847	Country Club.
8039867	8040467	Country Club Lanes.
8040627	8040867	Yeah.
8040967	8043128	Yeah, one of our old school DDR spots.
8043308	8046269	The last time I did Global was when Mel and Melody were in town.
8046609	8047229	Didn't you come too?
8047691	8076857	probably we need to go global it was like 2 in the morning and we were like you know what this email wants me to do it makes me want to go bowling because I haven't been bowling in forever let's do it while I'm not working last email hey OLR decided to put some time into getting the Wiimote working on my Windows 7 machine but apparently the new Wiimotes don't like to play with Windows do you have any suggestions you can point me towards or even better a surefire way to get it to work tanks in advance and this comes from Xenocore
8077700	8079182	It should just work.
8080324	8083048	It's Bluetooth, so it'd work like any Bluetooth device.
8083068	8085411	Sometimes they can be a little bit tricky to set up.
8085532	8094004	I remember I had a Bluetooth dongle for my laptop, and I tried getting a Wii remote to work with that with an emulator, and it was just like...
8094244	8095584	Nope, not going to do it.
8096145	8104847	So it may just be you might need to try a different adapter or you may need to try syncing in a different way.
8104887	8106547	I know you can't just push the sync button.
8106567	8110368	I think you have to push the 1 and 2 buttons at the same time, if I remember correctly.
8111909	8117170	I know I got one to sync up to my Android phone to play some games on that.
8118130	8120031	Actually, that was my old Android phone.
8120051	8120931	I should try the new one too.
8121792	8126478	but I've got a Bluetooth controller for that now and I think this laptop has Bluetooth built in.
8127058	8130703	Hell, I know my wife's netbook has Bluetooth built in so I should try that.
8130963	8133606	I have to read this part of his signature too.
8134367	8135068	Power corrupts.
8135249	8136830	Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
8136891	8138593	Trivial power corrupts disproportionately.
8139934	8140295	I love it.
8141055	8141415	That's it.
8142175	8142636	That's it?
8142936	8143416	That's it.
8143496	8144896	We need more bowling alley emails.
8144976	8148257	Mailbag at orangeslimesradio.com And we're spent.
8148757	8152839	So where's the craziest place you kids have listened to this show?
8152959	8155139	That's kind of what I want to know, like for real.
8155159	8156700	I kind of miss strikes now.
8157940	8158941	There still is a strike.
8158981	8160321	I know, but that's when we need to go.
8160381	8161641	Oh, because you haven't been in a while.
8161841	8162782	I haven't been in ages.
8163122	8163402	Alright.
8164702	8165663	You know I was just in Reno.
8165683	8166603	You know what they have in Reno?
8167469	8176112	DDR1 Did you go to where your DDR cherry was popped?
8177032	8195619	No, because that was in Vegas Oh, that's right, you were in Reno I was at the Rocky Horror 25th Anniversary Convention the first time I played DDR We decided to say fuck it and we didn't go to shock treatment night But anyway, the story I really want to say In Reno, it's a huge bowling center I think it's like the National Bowling Did you go to Circus Circus?
8197287	8198907	Yeah, oh yeah, that's where I saw DDR Supernova.
8198947	8199488	But bowling!
8199768	8200668	National, oh, forget it.
8201848	8203308	Did they still have the Daytona machines there?
8203469	8205129	Because they had like a ton of Daytona machines.
8205349	8209830	No, actually, truth be told, Circus Circus, sad.
8210090	8213071	I mean, because it's the same thing that happened to every other arcade.
8213191	8213811	Ticket machines.
8214291	8216372	Ticket machines, ticket machines, ticket machines, ticket machines.
8216732	8217252	And just like...
8218132	8221194	Just like DarkTetsuya said about Country Club Lanes, which we haven't been to in forever.
8221214	8223735	DarkTetsuya said, yeah, no DDR there anymore.
8223915	8226036	This is all in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
8226416	8232240	DarkTetsuya says, now it's all Dave and Buster style games like the Pac-Man Battle Royale and Faster Than Light or whatever that ticket game is.
8232380	8232720	Lame.
8233240	8237383	I mean, I'd hope they'd at least gotten DDR, X2, but X3... Or X2 or X3, but alas.
8237683	8242747	Yeah, Circus Circus, the only thing I caught, there was a driving game, and I don't even remember which one it was.
8242887	8246430	Just one of the flashy... It wasn't like initial D or anything.
8246470	8247511	I think it was like...
8248331	8250113	Have they made a racing game out of Fast and Furious?
8250193	8250453	Yeah.
8250493	8251093	I think it was that.
8251334	8254656	The Fast and Furious games are very similar to Cruisin'.
8254756	8255497	It's the same.
8255557	8256598	Why can't we have Sugar Rush?
8256898	8258599	It was that and DDR.
8259120	8262002	And the rest, ticket games, claw machines.
8262723	8266366	You know, Circus Circus, the casinos have the whole carnival barkers and those games.
8266706	8268948	That's still one of the few places you see that, too.
8269128	8273131	I mean, you know, now so many places have automated games.
8273351	8275072	Horsey Races and all that stuff.
8275092	8281836	They may have buried them back in the arcades because their arcades kind of go in some subterranean caverns and crap back there.
8281956	8282476	We looked.
8282536	8285898	We did a whole little... Now, granted, it was really crowded when we were there, which is weird.
8285918	8286899	Yeah, it was weird.
8286919	8287939	It was Saturday night.
8290043	8292346	Silver Legacy has theirs tucked away in the Child Care Center.
8292886	8298552	You know who had more arcade games was my favorite ghetto as fuck casino in the world.
8298592	8302917	I love this place, Calneva, which is on the strip in Reno.
8304198	8305459	I just said Reno has a strip.
8306780	8308161	It's so pathetic compared to Vegas.
8308241	8311183	But it does have a strip, and the Cal Neva is there.
8311684	8314886	And I love the Cal Neva because it's just so ghetto.
8315146	8322851	And because there's no more Fitzgerald's or Virginian, there's got to be a ghetto casino that holds that down.
8323231	8324892	And so Cal Neva really takes the cake.
8324932	8327454	But on the second floor, they have arcade games.
8327874	8331957	But they don't have really a lot of ticket spitters, probably because they can't pay somebody to run a ticket counter.
8332277	8336060	So they have old-ass recycled arcade games up there on the second floor.
8336540	8339462	So that was pretty, like a Neo Geo machine and that type of stuff.
8339782	8340003	Yeah.
8341724	8341924	No.
8343125	8343445	Anyhow.
8346107	8346847	Let's move on.
8348028	8350470	SSJ100Matt says, was that the arcade in The Wizard?
8350970	8351671	I don't remember.
8352652	8353152	Might have been.
8354073	8355033	Now I want to go look that up.
8355053	8356294	Did they go to Reno in The Wizard?
8356374	8356874	Yes, they did.
8358175	8358696	Holy shit.
8358896	8360397	He touched my breast!
8360477	8360857	That's right.
8361177	8362478	I thought that was Vegas for some reason.
8362498	8363099	No, it was Reno.
8363119	8363159	Oh.
8364158	8366500	The only movie I associate with Reno is Sister Act.
8368682	8370223	It's Reno and Gamora.
8371584	8371925	Oh, yes.
8372005	8375548	Speaking of Reno, it's time for the FUs of the week, everybody.
8377389	8378330	Where's the FU of the week music?
8378350	8378650	Here it is.
8382093	8383474	We need new music.
8383555	8386177	I'll help you get on that.
8386197	8388158	Let's get on that.
8388219	8388659	I tried.
8388719	8389900	It didn't work out very well.
8389920	8390641	FU of the week music.
8393288	8394530	So 500 is going to come up.
8394550	8396672	We're still going to have that same intro from seven years ago.
8396932	8399175	Not that, I mean, Midi Head did a great job.
8399235	8401818	It's great, but you know, seven years.
8401979	8405022	Hey, Midi Head, if you're still listening to us, make us a new one, please.
8405683	8406104	I won't scream.
8408274	8409515	FU's the week time, DarkSakura.
8409855	8410495	I don't know.
8412156	8418700	I guess FU to not having a job now, but at the same time not having my old job is awesome.
8419801	8422342	So I guess that's good.
8424143	8425564	Yeah, I'm done.
8426900	8427240	Loki.
8427940	8431181	Um, F you to drivers making right turns.
8431221	8435003	For some reason, people cannot make a right turn fast enough for my satisfaction.
8435563	8437984	Like, they will slow down to, like, no speed at all.
8438084	8440304	I don't understand why it's so hard to make a right turn.
8441105	8444126	And to this dick, like, I don't know what it was.
8444506	8451088	Some guy coming off the freeway today and, like, went across five lanes, no signaling whatsoever.
8451428	8453949	Oh, but managed to signal during his left turn.
8454129	8457550	Like, actually in the middle of his turn, he flipped on his signal for no apparent reason.
8458030	8462752	Stupid kid driver.
8462812	8466794	My FU of the week goes to Chain Requirements on IAD.
8468014	8468454	Nuff said.
8470635	8472296	So, I'm looking at Wikipedia.
8473601	8479362	They finally arrive in Reno, where it is revealed that Hayley wants her share of the prize money to help her father buy a house.
8479782	8489424	With the help of an acquaintance trucker, they use the money won at craps tables to train Jimmy on several games in the Reno arcades using Nintendo PlayChoice 10 machines.
8491104	8492604	Maybe that was... I need to find that scene.
8494245	8494905	Online somewhere.
8494925	8499906	But which... They don't say on wiki what... It may have been a set, so that's why.
8500046	8501046	It may have been a set.
8501126	8502246	That's actually a very good point.
8504046	8504586	All right, anyhow.
8505447	8505787	All right.
8507148	8510089	So Blockbuster is closing more stores, which is kind of bad.
8510769	8512650	They're closing another 300 stores in the U.S.
8512690	8512810	here.
8512830	8515832	They just closed another 160 in the U.K.
8515892	8518373	where they've recently filed bankruptcy there.
8519213	8524316	And that brings them down to a total of 500 stores in the States and 500 stores in the U.K.
8524976	8530719	What is kind of unique and not something that's actually reported on this article here and something I've got to know a little bit of information on is
8531109	8531650	Game Retail
8545111	8551034	That's why I was on the call I was on to this week.
8551655	8553696	Maybe they'll pick up your copy of MLB.
8554176	8555917	Well, not MLB because it's too late for that.
8555997	8556697	Bioshock, though.
8556717	8557358	Bioshock Infinite.
8557378	8561140	You'll be able to pick up your local blockbuster if you are ever so inclined.
8563501	8565982	Very important research I need to do here live on this show.
8566023	8567683	This is very, very, very important.
8568324	8571626	First off, what is that guy in the background?
8571646	8571726	What?
8573561	8574001	Okay, hold on.
8574041	8575422	No one wears that.
8576182	8577622	Nobody wears Speedos in public.
8577802	8589306	All right, hold on.
8589326	8589606	Hallie!
8589666	8591226	Got you, Jimmy boy.
8592087	8593527	Time to go home, son.
8594007	8597528	We're too late.
8598188	8600229	He touched me!
8604252	8605332	That is not the Calnava.
8605933	8607733	The arcade at the Calnava is on the second floor.
8608394	8609734	That does look like a Hollywood stage.
8610074	8611015	That's probably where that was filmed.
8611475	8612475	They might have just said it was that.
8613456	8616557	Anyhow, very important question we had to answer.
8618618	8619658	I mean, that was crucial.
8620359	8623960	I could not continue the show until I knew if that was the Calnava or not.
8625981	8628062	I wonder if she's used that line before.
8628522	8630923	Like, now that she's grown up a bit.
8635307	8638290	Shane Alinko in our chatroom says, Jimmy grew up to be super hot.
8641994	8642754	All right, moving on.
8643415	8649081	One last story for you guys tonight, and this has to do with an arcade beat-em-up game coming to Facebook.
8649521	8653545	And apparently it's turning some heads because it is a console-quality game.
8653825	8658070	You know, when we think of Facebook games, we don't think of a lot of really great games where it's, you know...
8658550	8661532	Click for and then give me money for more energy pills.
8661572	8663854	Like there's just not a lot of great, great games on Facebook.
8664194	8675482	The only one that I think a lot of console and PC gamers will give any cred to is maybe like You Don't Know Jack, you know, because it's, you know, that kind of gets a little bit of a break.
8675882	8700948	But not a lot of hardcore stuff on Facebook Well, I don't know if you guys knew about this But there's a new developer, N-Way And this is a San Francisco-based company They were founded in 2011 It was founded by game industry veterans And their sole purpose is console-quality multiplayer games To the web and mobile platforms David Jones is with this studio He was the founder of DMA Designs Wasn't he a monkey?
8701308	8704169	Well, it's now Rockstar North He created Lemmings
8705969	8708892	and the original 2D Grand Theft Auto.
8709072	8712756	Stig Hedlund, who was the lead designer in the first two entries for Diablo.
8713457	8722065	Chronoblade is the game that they've put together, which if you actually look at some of the screenshots, I'm like, that does kind of look like Diablo, but more of like a...
8723366	8725449	I don't know, not like that same type of perspective.
8725489	8737342	It looks a little more, I don't want to say hack and slash because that is kind of Diablo, but you see, it looks like there's the red orb and the blue orb and, you know, there is definitely, I mean, I look at this and I go, oh, this is like an Xbox Live Arcade game, right?
8737362	8738043	No.
8738263	8740866	Nope, apparently it is something that is on Facebook.
8741186	8748353	They're calling it an arcade-style brawler, and it apparently is going to be very similar to Diablo.
8749074	8755801	Chrono Blade exists in a series of parallel worlds that will band together to fight against a common foe.
8756342	8761287	So I'm assuming this means maybe the parallel universes is how you interact with your friends?
8761847	8769308	I don't know, but they also say this is a way to have a Viking-themed world and steampunk world and kind of cross all these areas together.
8769769	8770549	So that's pretty cool.
8771229	8776430	And it's going to be completely free to play, and there is a beta sign-up website if you want to check that out.
8776490	8779930	Maybe this will be the Facebook game that it will be okay to like.
8780891	8781271	Who knows?
8783431	8783851	There you go.
8785371	8787392	Would you play a game like that, even though it's on Facebook?
8788277	8788577	Loki?
8789018	8789178	No.
8789558	8789698	No?
8790819	8791320	Alright, fair enough.
8791340	8792281	I just don't Facebook game.
8792741	8794783	Yeah, I hear you.
8794803	8805172	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call and we'll take your calls here on the show for a few minutes here and whatever you want to talk about tonight.
8805633	8808175	If you want us to watch more scenes from The Wizard, we can do that too.
8808335	8808956	Just let us know.
8809476	8810057	I'll queue it up.
8810097	8810757	That sounds fun.
8811038	8811358	Alright.
8811818	8814621	Maybe for each caller tonight I will play a new scene from The Wizard.
8816123	8817024	All right.
8817685	8820267	Loki, do you have any last-minute news stories while we wait for those calls to come in?
8820287	8824870	Again, that's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8826031	8828754	Apparently there is a company, Team Pixel.
8828954	8830455	They're an independent company.
8830575	8835739	They are crowdfunding to buy THQ's Homeworld IP.
8836740	8840423	Apparently they are trying to raise, I guess...
8841984	8848930	$50,000 by February 7th in order to acquire the property to make another Homeworld game.
8849570	8850231	Let's go to the phones.
8850251	8851071	We have a call coming in.
8851492	8852532	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8852572	8852933	Who's this?
8853769	8855629	Oh, it is me, one named Jason.
8855789	8857390	Hey, Jason, long time no see.
8857430	8857850	How are you?
8858450	8859710	Yes, a terribly long time.
8859890	8861371	I know, but you're back in Colorado now.
8862011	8870293	I am back in Colorado after a seven-hour train delay that got me in town at one o'clock in the morning and was kind of garbage by the end of it.
8871333	8875834	And now that you're back in Colorado, how was it to hear me bitch about one inch of snow ruining my day?
8877214	8884779	I chuckled but I also kind of, I know exactly how you feel because when I first went out to California in March, St.
8884799	8900750	Patrick's Day weekend, it was snowing over the Sierra Nevada and the bus that I was on had to throw on chains or some other, you know, whatever a vehicle of that size has to use and go like 25 miles an hour over Donner Pass and that whole bus ride was just garbage.
8901380	8902180	Well, thank you, Jason.
8902200	8904502	You're a true friend, making the listeners understand my pain.
8904582	8906663	So what did you really want to call in to talk about tonight?
8907443	8908604	Just kind of an idle thought.
8908844	8916949	When I was listening to you talk about your trip to Reno, a co-worker mentioned something to me a couple of months ago, something along those lines.
8917449	8924093	And he said that it was a sad day when he realized that audio – musical hardware companies –
8925013	8933579	Produce things predominantly for churches and broadcast and not like musicians and clubs and studios or anything like that.
8934700	8945648	And so he started to get to explaining how as churches crop up and start having recordings and even if you know of churches that broadcast on the local stations over the air in the area...
8946948	8969305	and I had thought about a church that I used to go to when I was really young and I remember being in the production studio and seeing all of those screens, this gigantic mixer, all of the audio coming out of these ridiculously powerful speakers for recording an orchestra, the preacher and whatever else that they have going on.
8969545	8970366	I could see that.
8970426	8974048	You know, there's a lot of television around the church program and so forth.
8974088	8976090	And, you know, I always associate church in my mind.
8976450	8979312	The church I went to when I was younger was a very small place.
8979953	8984776	And, you know, the whole freaking place could probably hold maybe, maybe 80 people.
8985097	8987358	You know, so there was nothing like what you're talking about.
8987398	8993343	But I know there's other churches like, you know, you get these mega churches that are like, you know, that it's like going to a rock concert.
8993463	8997206	You know, they called my church when I lived in Alabama, Six Flags Over Jesus.
8999197	9002219	Seriously, go to Google Maps and look up Dauphin Way Baptist Church.
9002579	9003300	Oh, I know.
9003800	9007843	Texas has some just like some churches buy arenas.
9008323	9008984	They are that big.
9009184	9010144	We built an arena.
9010305	9014747	So, yeah, no, I told like now that you're saying this, I'm like, yeah, that makes sense.
9014787	9016749	And it is kind of an interesting parallel, too.
9016789	9027636	And I'm assuming that's the parallel you're making, too, is that a lot of stuff that maybe we get in gaming might have been developed for, you know, lounge gaming or whatever you want to call it, casino gaming.
9028052	9028652	Yeah, absolutely.
9028712	9042757	And you already laid all of it out when you were talking about it because, sure, the DS is a tiny screen and has two screen depth 3D, but you were just talking about, and I saw the picture too, a four screen, I don't know, how big was that, would you say, 150 inch screen?
9044438	9045839	Oh, that is gigantic.
9045899	9046559	Yeah, probably.
9046959	9051801	I mean, it had enough space so that you had, I think, four... You saw Alan post on his Facebook, right?
9051821	9055622	It had room for at least, I think, six people to sit.
9056043	9056243	Yeah.
9057243	9059704	And that was one edge of the screen to the other.
9059864	9062725	And they're like those fancy chairs that vibrate.
9062745	9065546	You feel the bass in your ass if you hit the jackpot.
9065967	9066247	I mean, it's...
9067347	9069950	That's gotta be one fun share to sit in when you get a jackpot.
9070050	9072732	It's a Sex and the City game, for fuck's sake.
9073293	9074614	And that only makes it even better.
9074634	9075675	That explains everything.
9075695	9077757	That is... Oh my god.
9078398	9079799	That was the part that blew me away.
9080059	9081100	This game is orgasmic.
9081120	9081440	Really?
9081801	9082121	This?
9082562	9083983	Like, deal or no deal?
9084263	9084764	I get that.
9084884	9085684	Wheel of Fortune?
9085985	9086505	I get that.
9087066	9087927	Sex and the City?
9088827	9089068	What?
9092249	9099392	But, you know, there's a lot of little old ladies that love Sex and the City and they love Reno, so I guess it does make sense.
9099832	9111617	And a lot of people, I remember CES both this and last year, I believe, that people, they scoff about the 100-inch TVs and the life-size TVs and everything else like that.
9111657	9114539	It's like, oh yeah, Bill Gates is going to have three of these in his house.
9116059	9138249	I have, the Red Robin closest to me has an 80 inch TV in one of the dining areas and it's mighty impressive to look at but it's there's certainly application for all of this stuff that you wouldn't imagine would be the result after seeing it shown off and the fact that they really do advertise it to everybody and the best and most rich people pick them up rich companies rather
9139429	9145473	Very good point is that we often forget about the many commercial uses of this stuff.
9145513	9153458	You know, there is a very large football game occurring next week that people are going to want to, you know, go to a bar together and watch.
9153518	9158842	And I hope that bar has one of these 100 screen TVs that they want to fit a lot of people in there and they can all get a good view of the game, you know.
9159961	9163022	One very small related note that I figured I would talk about.
9164862	9174505	I read something a while ago about corporate parties and big conventions, notably like, for example, the Democratic and Republican National Conventions.
9174805	9184147	Rentals for these kind of items don't really exist, so they buy up these huge gobs of resources, of digital resources, and I've even heard stories about...
9185682	9211216	and they sell that stuff off to recoup as much cost as possible dirt cheap so if you know anybody that puts together some kind of a party where they have to buy up expensive items keep talking to them after it wraps up because there's probably a good chance you'll get some serious deals on things if you live in a swing state that's likely to host one of these conventions in 2016 check Craigslist the next day that's what you're saying
9212491	9217953	I don't know that they... I'm pretty sure there's a lot of legislation that tries to go in about along Craigslist, but you never know.
9217973	9222054	Maybe a staffer got their hands on something and, oh, sure, I'll buy it and throw it in the till.
9222155	9222975	I mean, it could happen.
9223375	9228417	Trust me, you never know, because you're not... The Democratic and Republican parties aren't technically a part of the government.
9228957	9230397	They're their own independent things.
9230437	9237520	They can kind of... And trust me, as somebody who used to date a politician, it's... I used this word earlier and got yelled at for it, but I'm going to use it here.
9237560	9239921	It's very interesting to see how all that works.
9241281	9242201	Anyhow, that's all I'll say.
9243022	9244922	I got to ask you this before I let you go.
9245002	9246203	What is this I'm seeing in chat?
9246323	9248104	You still to this day have not seen The Wizard?
9248744	9252925	You know, I was wondering who was going to bring it up, but I didn't think it would be during this call.
9253786	9255426	Surprise!
9255546	9257207	The first answer is that me and movies.
9257367	9259608	Oh, that looks interesting, and it's not in theaters anymore.
9259768	9262068	Oh, that looks interesting, and it's not in theaters anymore.
9262469	9265210	I really enjoy movies, and I really don't see very many of them.
9265470	9266250	It's very strange.
9266730	9292539	but I didn't even see um not Captain N oh the the Mario Brothers Super Show I didn't watch that until Ryan made me watch it like two years ago uh somehow I missed that in my youth and plenty of other of these fun little gaming things that everybody knows about except for me well all I have to say is you better set aside 90 minutes next time you're in the Bay Area I don't have a problem with that all right all right buddy I'm gonna let you go try and get another call in all right you have a good one thanks you too all right bye
9294059	9299262	Very interesting, you know, that sometimes there's these uses for things that we don't always think about.
9299322	9302924	That's a very interesting, like the music DJ stuff.
9303365	9305086	Churches are a big business for that.
9305842	9306803	who would have thought of that?
9307644	9333084	I always remembered we actually had a really again this was at the megachurch that I went to god thank god I'm not around that anymore but they had a whole full AV set up with like something I want to say like five different sound panels spotlights you name it and an orchestra pit I'm not joking wow good big stuff alright we got another call coming in so let's go to it hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?
9333869	9336670	It's Jim Sowie.
9336730	9337010	Woo!
9337251	9337811	Hey, buddy.
9337851	9338511	How you doing?
9340272	9340612	Dude.
9341372	9341633	Rob.
9342533	9342713	Me.
9342733	9344674	You got an interest to know when you're going to put chains on your tires?
9345034	9345474	Come on.
9345894	9348616	I... Check the... For an interest to know?
9348836	9351137	Google I-80 chain controls.
9351157	9352377	This is public information.
9352437	9353678	Google it from last night.
9353758	9354378	I swear to God.
9354438	9356119	It's not... I don't make the rules.
9356199	9358540	The Highway Patrol or Caltrans or whoever does.
9359020	9359741	I think it's... Well...
9360541	9361082	Dude Bros!
9376943	9382665	crash their car, airbags deployed and everything, and scary stuff.
9382745	9387347	So an inch of snow or not, it's how it kind of fucks with those roads.
9387407	9391948	And again, I want to remind you guys, you're going downhill for a big part of that.
9392048	9393909	Once you cross Donner Summit, you're going downhill.
9394429	9396670	I barely step on the gas driving home.
9398370	9399671	Listen, Rob.
9401791	9403572	Two days ago, I got seven inches of snow.
9405312	9410734	and it was, I'm not kidding you, it was minus 40 Celsius, which is like, I think minus 45 Fahrenheit.
9410774	9412734	Yeah, the cars wouldn't start, Rob.
9412994	9413934	The cars would not start.
9414375	9416535	The cars wouldn't start.
9416935	9418216	Where in Canada do you live again?
9419936	9423397	I'm Elk Lake, so I am like, do you know where Detroit is?
9423837	9424877	I know where Detroit is.
9425458	9427058	I'm 10 hours north of Buffalo.
9427838	9428758	Oh my God.
9428778	9431019	This is where I live, buddy.
9431039	9432299	10 hours north of Buffalo.
9432319	9434100	10 hours north of Buffalo.
9436377	9438898	Oh yeah, I see this huge lake in Canada.
9438918	9440019	So you live by this big lake?
9441119	9442179	Well, it's the Montreal River.
9442480	9444500	I live, the Montreal River goes right through my backyard.
9445001	9445741	Wow, okay.
9446061	9448882	I'm 100 feet from ice fishing right in Pickerel, buddy.
9449222	9450123	I caught seven this morning.
9451946	9453527	But listen, listen, forget about this.
9453607	9458450	You were talking the other day before too about the craziest place that people have listened to Orange Lounge Radio.
9459151	9462092	Dude, like six years ago, I guess.
9462173	9463233	Like, yeah, about six.
9463653	9466775	I think you guys were on the old place.
9467376	9469657	And I started listening to you guys.
9469697	9471919	And then I worked at the sausage factory called Schneider's.
9472439	9473720	And I was an elevator operator.
9473740	9475721	I just moved the elevator up and down five floors.
9477583	9478423	with meat on it.
9478463	9479224	That was my job all day.
9479664	9484386	And then Sunday nights when I could get away, I'd go to the top of the elevator where the little motor is and stuff.
9484746	9492569	And I actually had an Ethernet cord that I pulled through from the third floor up the fourth floor up the fifth floor into this room in an old, old 386 or Pentium II.
9493069	9494509	It was an old computer.
9494889	9499271	But I could just barely run fucking Winamp on it and I would listen to OLR for the last three hours of my shift.
9499831	9500772	Oh my God.
9501092	9504333	We were in some empty ass elevator in the middle of Canada.
9504353	9504653	Yeah.
9505719	9509348	The top of a sausage factory At least it was the top of a sausage factory, right?
9509508	9510290	Wow
9511474	9521196	and that was it, that was my job every Sunday night because there was nothing to do Sunday night so the other shift would end at 7 but I would get paid to stay there till midnight because someone's got to be on the elevator like you know, fucking union jobs, right?
9521576	9529158	Oh my god, talking about the long Ethernet cable that makes me think of the year do you remember when we did the live DDR tournament in San Francisco?
9529638	9540280	B3 or whatever it was called at Pier 39 we actually broadcast from Pier 39 it's one of our more like if we were to make a resume like the Orange Islands Radio resume that would be on there because you know, Pier 39 is a big touristy spot
9540800	9545225	and we had to run, didn't we have to go to Radio Shack and buy like a 100 foot cable?
9545325	9545906	I think so.
9545926	9546446	To run it?
9546887	9548368	Yeah, that's what I had to do too.
9548428	9549870	I had to steal one from the IT department.
9549930	9550471	God.
9551852	9552973	Crazy.
9553153	9557618	I had to go to maintenance and get like this drill, dude, the drill bit on this drill that the maintenance guy gave me was sick.
9558079	9559220	It was like two and a half feet long.
9560051	9561532	with a big brick bit on it.
9561612	9562953	And I was like, well, where can I drill it?
9563573	9564574	But now how does it feel?
9564614	9565214	Anywhere you want.
9565835	9566615	Don't hit a wire.
9567596	9573079	How do you feel knowing now, like six years later, like no problem, just bring up the iPhone?
9573339	9574380	Oh, I know, right?
9574520	9577982	I don't know what kind of coverage you have up there, but I mean, even if on 3G.
9578042	9578622	Excellent coverage.
9578923	9579983	Oh, then you can.
9580343	9581244	We have DSL.
9581264	9585467	We have the same DSL that I had when I lived down south, but there's 500 people in my town, so it never slows down.
9585687	9586227	Oh, my gosh.
9586767	9587468	There's no tweeners.
9588689	9593893	If you go to the elementary school, there's 12 kids, I think, from the ages of 10 to 16 in the entire town.
9595054	9595935	Oh, boy, oh, boy.
9595975	9597556	It's so right away.
9597916	9598757	It's a different life.
9598777	9602920	Jim, you've thrown the gauntlet, and I love what SSJ100Matt is suggesting in chat.
9603280	9605081	We should have this topic as a foogle question.
9605141	9607063	Strangest place you've listened to OLR.
9607803	9609484	That's a hell of a way to— Good luck, people.
9609705	9611346	Yeah, I'm curious.
9611366	9614188	Who's going to be the top of an elevator at a sausage factory?
9615058	9615438	I don't know.
9615458	9619120	With a 100-foot Ethernet cord going downstairs to a manager's office that I had to break into.
9619420	9625642	I had to break into a manager's office and install a router so that I could take the cord out of the back of his computer and stick it in the little router bridge thing.
9625702	9626803	Loki, you know what I'm talking about.
9627203	9629984	And then you have to stick the other cord in because you can't just stick the two cords together.
9630324	9630885	No, no, no.
9631045	9633065	You've got to have a little router thing in the middle.
9633306	9634066	You're hardcore, Jim.
9634086	9634506	Oh, my God.
9635086	9636847	I was hardcore.
9637067	9637707	Don't take this the wrong way.
9637727	9641389	I was desperate to listen to anything besides Canadian radio.
9641989	9644410	I didn't know any more Canadian radio.
9644870	9646891	And ever since then, Rob, I've been in love with you, man.
9647271	9648572	Was it all Atlantis and Rush?
9648592	9650292	Well, shucks.
9650352	9653854	Every time I think about packing sausage, Rob, I think of you.
9656515	9659636	Well, the only sausage factory I think of is a place in the Castro.
9659656	9660316	And it's not what you think.
9660356	9661757	It's actually an Italian restaurant.
9661777	9665478	But it's funny because when you talk about the sausage factory, I'm like, oh, it's a yummy restaurant in the Castro.
9665778	9667959	The Castro is like the gayest part of San Francisco.
9668259	9668479	Yes.
9669760	9670320	But anyway.
9671060	9672382	Well, Jim, I'm going to let you go.
9672422	9681791	Before I let you go, I'm just going to say, in my defense about the whole one-inch-a-snow thing, come to my neck of the woods sometimes and get through a 105-degree summer.
9683613	9686296	Oh, I'm looking for two plane tickets now.
9686476	9687738	I can use it.
9687758	9688258	You'll melt.
9688538	9688899	You'll melt.
9688919	9689139	All right.
9689559	9691261	Jim, buddy, have a good one, and thanks for the story.
9691281	9691742	That was great.
9692321	9692922	You too, guys.
9692942	9693983	Everyone be safe, okay?
9694164	9694484	All right.
9694524	9694845	Bye.
9694885	9695405	You too.
9695565	9696106	Don't forget.
9696186	9696907	Don't forget, okay?
9696947	9699010	This is winter driving safety tip, okay?
9699250	9699971	Okay.
9700152	9705920	If you're going up a hill and your tires start to spin, you're giving it too much gas or not enough.
9708163	9709004	What a helpful tip.
9710754	9711755	and he hung up on that.
9713236	9713716	You jerk.
9713916	9714776	Where did you find that?
9716117	9717238	Very important Alan question.
9717258	9717898	Where did you find that?
9718359	9722261	It was on the nice leather recliner but under a Snuggie.
9723081	9725363	We couldn't find the fourth microphone for Alan tonight.
9725783	9727804	Apparently it was under a Snuggie.
9728785	9729105	Who knew?
9729886	9730526	Speaking of cold.
9733004	9735288	Yes, how many Snuggies do you have to wear for minus 40?
9735469	9738274	Is that like five layers of Snuggies?
9738394	9738975	I don't know.
9739015	9741600	I think your body just gets used to it at some point, you know?
9742031	9743732	Yes, it gets used to it when you're dead.
9744132	9744612	Stop it.
9744692	9745773	All right, let's go to the phones.
9745813	9746673	We have another call coming in.
9746693	9747614	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9747634	9747994	Who's this?
9748675	9750135	Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma.
9750415	9752276	Hey, hey, hey, what's up, Ranma?
9752937	9753937	Hey, not much.
9755198	9757019	I'm in a bit of a pissy mood.
9757039	9758139	I want to vent.
9758860	9759480	Well, please.
9760301	9763122	When I think of where do I want to vent, I think of Orange Launch Radio.
9763222	9764723	Please, by all means, the stage is yours.
9765868	9769231	Well, every morning, part of my normal routine, I read the paper.
9769291	9772793	Until I get to a certain point in the paper, I put it down and go about my business.
9773274	9776436	So, I'm reading the editorials like I usually do.
9776717	9778798	Did I see something here in the paper?
9779118	9781881	I swear to you, I have never seen before.
9782901	9784663	I have a bad feeling I know where this is going.
9784703	9785203	Go for it.
9785664	9786024	You!
9787185	9790447	Coming off of what we explored on our podcast last week?
9790648	9790728	Oh!
9790748	9790828	Oh!
9793981	9796983	The title goes, Put the Blame on Video Games.
9797523	9802166	Never in an entire moment I wanted to punch a window so badly in my life.
9804728	9806869	There are people out there that think this way.
9806909	9812792	This is a shocking reality, and it is infuriating that people can be so ignorant.
9813993	9816254	What was the gist of the argument, or did you even get that far?
9816895	9819636	It was only two paragraphs from two different people.
9820797	9821658	That's all it was.
9821738	9822098	It's just...
9824501	9825421	Now, what is local?
9825802	9829684	Pretty much just saying the biggest reason for gun violence is the violence associated with video games.
9829944	9831925	They are a breeding ground for future murderers.
9832406	9836428	It is too easy to sit in front of a video game and shoot animated figures on the screen.
9836728	9839530	There is no moral responsibility for the characters you shoot up.
9839910	9842372	There is no pain when your character is killed or wounded.
9842792	9847295	It is all done knowing that the only thing you have to do is reload the game to get a new life.
9847535	9848936	A breeding ground for future murderers.
9848956	9851879	Well, DarkSakura, you know, since you're job hunting again, you could be a murderer.
9851899	9853020	That could be your new career.
9853060	9853721	Contract killer?
9853741	9853821	Yes.
9853841	9854882	I mean, because you play video games.
9872438	9874880	Clearly, what did you say you've been playing this week?
9875000	9877482	Mass Effect and Bomberman mixed with Pac-Man?
9877862	9878603	Well, shit.
9878623	9879343	You're a terrorist.
9879423	9880244	Bomberman.
9880284	9881365	You bomb things.
9882626	9887349	Except if I was actually going to be a contract killer, I'd use blades and poisons, so that doesn't work for me.
9887889	9888790	Not my style, sorry.
9888810	9891452	Well, you're going to have to play more Thief and Assassin's Creed.
9894334	9894614	Nope.
9895155	9897737	The only thing video games taught me how to do is throw balloons at people.
9897917	9900579	Because, you know, we don't know right from wrong.
9902182	9905346	And I can't do magic, so clearly WoW hasn't helped me.
9905546	9911893	Because gamers, gaming, Ranma has some, and you know, obviously I'm not saying this at you, but the person who wrote that.
9912654	9917160	Gamers, obviously, we don't know how to tell the difference between the real world and our digital world.
9918427	9919888	You know, just like movies are real.
9920248	9921388	All movies are documentaries.
9921428	9923289	The Blair Witch Project, totally true.
9924070	9924290	Right?
9928692	9928992	Wow.
9929172	9929452	Yeah.
9930853	9932234	It was a horror film, that's for sure.
9934084	9944188	Rob, the thing that really pissed me off the most about this is that something like this you would expect in the New York Post or as I like to call the Republican News Daily.
9945388	9948850	This came out of the Daily News, the leftist paper that I read.
9949470	9950090	Guess what?
9950390	9952151	Leland Yee is a Democrat.
9952691	9956272	Idiocy does not know Republican and Democrat balance.
9956332	9957873	There are idiots on both sides.
9958553	9960034	That's another harsh reality.
9960094	9961654	Idiocy is nonpartisan.
9961734	9963455	Yeah, idiocy is nonpartisan.
9963495	9966856	And there are people that are way too extreme in their thinking on both sides.
9966916	9967656	That's reality.
9968837	9973619	You know, after the initial shock of it, I realized, you know, this is why I'm in the middle.
9973959	9976380	I hear what both sides have to say before I make my decision.
9976440	9977880	That's the way I look at it.
9977900	9979321	Because this is just, no.
9980061	9980261	Yep.
9983184	9985185	I know we always talk about third party.
9985225	9987466	There needs to be a third party in this country.
9987506	9995510	Well, let's start somewhere with not being so naive when it comes to media.
9996050	9997551	I like what SSJ100Mass said.
9997791	9999471	I was a white mage in Final Fantasy XI.
9999491	10001492	I guess that gives me the credentials to perform surgery.
10001672	10002293	Absolutely.
10003553	10007755	I'm really good at... Crap, what's that surgery game now?
10008615	10009055	Trauma.
10009395	10010175	Trauma Center.
10010396	10014917	You know, I should be a weatherman because I was a black mage in Final Fantasy XI.
10014997	10016257	So, you know, it's gonna rain.
10016497	10017398	Bolt 3, motherfucker.
10018918	10020199	That's exactly what I'm talking about.
10022039	10024100	Well, Ranma, thank you for making us all angry.
10024240	10027741	Thank you for sharing your pain with all of us here and the listeners.
10027761	10028741	We really appreciate it.
10029161	10032542	Anything else you want to... Akuma JP makes a good statement.
10032982	10034823	White mage doesn't perform surgery, they just pray.
10035267	10035787	Heal, please.
10035947	10036468	Prop, please.
10037208	10039949	Alright, Ranma, anything else you want to share with listeners before I let you go tonight?
10040550	10043531	Yes, listen to this week's episode of Anime Jam Session.
10043891	10045672	We go over two hours.
10045932	10052556	We posted, we added a special rant because some dipshit decided to post their rules for cosplay.
10053176	10055097	Oh, I remember reading that, bitch.
10055577	10056157	Oh, no.
10056538	10057178	Yes, yes.
10057298	10064942	Because of me going nuts and a bunch of other people, she took the post down and she deleted her like page.
10065879	10075285	but it's still archived because once it's on the internet it's there forever and people have reposted the archive Ranma, this is for this week's episode of Anime Jam Session I'll let you borrow this, okay?
10080751	10081612	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10103033	10105995	Oh yeah, she was... She opened up the bottom part.
10106015	10107115	She was awesome.
10107135	10108476	That was awesome.
10109636	10111397	How fucking clever is that, right?
10112117	10117040	So there's this screen grab on Tumblr of her and then all these Facebook comments.
10117440	10118220	She's fat.
10118480	10120161	I guess it really is bigger on the inside.
10120201	10122482	All this other just really... Garbage.
10123243	10124683	Yeah, garbage is the only way to say it.
10124743	10125244	And I'm like...
10126324	10128307	I thought she was hot, to be honest.
10128747	10130129	Yes, she was.
10130209	10133352	I'd like to see those assholes cosplay and pull off something that clever.
10136957	10145747	But the thing is, that argument's been going on in the cosplay world for years because there's actual photographers that refuse to take pictures of people that are plus size.
10147410	10149472	TigerClaw in chat says...
10164728	10186682	I was in Reno, that's my excuse I'm waiting for the podcast before I hear but I'm sure they covered it very well so I will tip my hat and mention Understation Live this week hopefully they get the podcast updated soon because I would love to hear those guys rant on the TARDIS thing because that was I thought she was a great looking gal and very clever
10187455	10189397	Yes, it was phenomenal.
10189437	10190117	Simple as that.
10190898	10192739	I want to wear that dress for like a wedding.
10193059	10194140	I would wear that dress.
10194240	10194601	Shit.
10195201	10195481	All right.
10196502	10197543	Ranma, I got to let you go.
10197583	10197863	All right.
10198444	10199064	You got it, bro.
10199144	10199365	All right.
10199405	10199845	Take care, buddy.
10200325	10200565	Later.
10201246	10201506	All right.
10201546	10202667	Thank you guys so much for the calls.
10202827	10203848	I do have to wrap up.
10204208	10205670	I'm going to close up the Skype line for tonight.
10206130	10210113	If you did not get through, though, I always say, please write down your thoughts.
10210273	10210894	Send an email.
10211054	10211794	Make Jamie work.
10212975	10214837	Mailbag at OrangeLondonTrader.com.
10215297	10215818	or Twitter.
10215878	10217299	I gotta get to Twitter topics as well.
10217879	10220220	Loki, did you have last minute stories before I get to the tweets?
10221201	10222082	There's just a couple tonight.
10222122	10224503	There were layoffs over at SuperBot.
10225444	10225664	Thanks.
10226024	10226365	Oh, no.
10226425	10229187	Yeah, Sony confirmed that, so that kind of sucks.
10229507	10230367	They didn't say how many, though.
10232659	10233760	All right, let's see.
10233820	10235720	Just a couple quick tweets here.
10236321	10238001	And actually, let me – I'm sorry, guys.
10238021	10238782	I'm going to pull this up.
10239262	10240402	Live radio, it's a blast.
10240523	10245465	I'm pulling this up on the show computer because I couldn't find my iPad because I think it's still in the luggage.
10246285	10248986	So I'm bringing up the show computer tweets real quick.
10251828	10254869	There were two, and the first one was from – here we go, Tiger Claw.
10255269	10261352	Disney is prepared to look at game violence because, you know, there is that call on the industry –
10262651	10263691	Are games too violent?
10263711	10264472	Well, Disney.
10265852	10271154	You know, when I think who's putting out the most violent video games in existence right now, I go, oh, shit, it's Disney.
10271775	10272335	You know, right?
10273415	10281278	But to be fair, Disney, you know, they stuck their big toe in the water with the more serious gaming with the whole split second.
10281298	10282679	But then again, they closed that studios.
10282759	10283039	I don't know.
10283339	10286120	The only violent game I can think of that they published was Turok.
10287159	10304510	Well, Robert Iger said, quote, at Disney, there's very little violent content, but I still want to make sure we're asking ourselves the right questions in term of that standard and also ensure we're willing to be a part of a dialogue in today's world that I think is pretty necessary in terms of what our role is and what our role should be.
10304891	10307432	You know, I got to be honest, I wouldn't read too much into that.
10307472	10309434	I think he's just saying the right answer.
10310494	10313795	because at the video game industry, you don't really want to poo-poo it.
10315936	10328519	I think it was smart that all those guys went to go meet with Biden when he asked the video game companies to meet with him because it's like if you don't sit there and represent yourself, somebody else will do it for you, and it's probably not the person you want representing yourself.
10328939	10336982	So I think it's nice that Disney said this, but it's kind of the expected answer, I think.
10338182	10343546	One more tweet here from SSJ100Matt who tweeted us, New age of gaming classifieds?
10344086	10349410	A group has started on Facebook for people looking to buy, sell, rent arcade machines.
10350270	10350690	Really?
10351231	10355093	Arcade Exchange, a Facebook community for buying and selling the classics.
10355473	10357355	Maybe you can find one of these for pinball, DarkSakura.
10359256	10380875	it is listed as a page created to help bring together the hundreds of collectors and enthusiasts from around the world into one place it's through Facebook but it allows members to post their for sale or wanted ads just for arcade machines and their related parts that's kind of rad I'm going to look at the Facebook community myself right now facebook.com slash arcade exchange all one word
10382665	10386548	Ooh, a Killer Instinct, PCB, HD, and Marquee.
10386608	10388489	It doesn't boot up, but it's $75.
10390871	10394193	That's literally just the little board, not even the machine or anything.
10394213	10395194	That's still kind of neat, though.
10396975	10399717	A Pump It Up Fiesta 2010 upgrade kit for $400.
10400017	10402198	Oh, look, pinball machines.
10402318	10406801	There's a Terminator 2, Roadshow, Revenge from Mars.
10407542	10408623	That's pretty cool.
10408663	10409283	Revenge from Mars, $1,800. $1,800.
10412572	10413834	Yeah, that one's going to be expensive.
10414855	10415055	Huh.
10415596	10416036	That's neat.
10416116	10417398	Thanks for that link, SSJ100Math.
10417418	10417919	That's a great one.
10418099	10419500	I may get rid of some of my stuff.
10420702	10423365	One more tweet from RossDLUT coming in here at the last minute.
10423385	10423786	I'll read this.
10424046	10426309	Can gaming get outside of the man cave?
10426709	10431495	The reaction of people speaking against the Dead Island statue suggests we're still stuck in.
10433499	10435620	I'm not sure I'm following the logic on that.
10435700	10439102	Wouldn't people speaking out against the Dead Island statue be a good thing?
10439122	10442224	Because that was pretty irresponsible.
10443205	10447247	And it was not, it was just, it was, it's just in bad taste.
10447628	10449749	That whole thing was just in bad taste.
10451890	10455933	But am I, am I thinking that maybe the statue itself suggests that we're still stuck in?
10456373	10457494	You need to send an email, sir.
10457514	10459815	I want to, I would love to hear your thoughts elaborated.
10460115	10461396	Mailbag at orange lingerie dot com.
10463192	10466074	More last minute stories tonight, Loki?
10467155	10467355	No.
10467856	10468016	No?
10468777	10469497	I guess that's it then.
10469757	10470438	That's it, yeah.
10470758	10471659	We're wrapping up the show.
10471719	10472700	It's about that time anyway.
10474342	10477404	We're going to go around and get last minute thoughts in a minute here and final thoughts and all that.
