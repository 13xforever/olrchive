27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	47000	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this January 27th, 2013, episode number 491 of our program on this lovely Sunday evening.
47000	58000	My name is Rob Roberts with you all at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOG at Network.com, where we do tape our show every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
58000	65000	Joining me in studio to talk about video games and gaming culture and gaming lolz, emphasis on lolz, are my co-hosts.
65000	69000	First off, the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
69000	70000	Lol.
70000	71000	How are you?
71000	72000	I'm free.
72000	73000	Free?
73000	74000	Free.
74000	75000	Free as a bird.
75000	77000	I quit my job.
77000	80000	Congratulations! Yay, applause.
80000	82000	Now I need another one, but I have an interview on Monday.
82000	84000	There you go. Just line them right up.
84000	89000	But I'm not going to go into any detail about it because she's crazy.
89000	90000	Yeah.
90000	93000	So, um, but yeah, free.
93000	94000	There you go.
94000	95000	Free.
95000	96000	Happy. Happy.
96000	98000	And that same night I had Noki, so it was awesome.
98000	103000	I'm reminded of that scene from Braveheart, even though I can't stand Belle Gibson, but you know, freedom!
103000	104000	You know, forget it.
104000	109000	Anyhow, I'll also say hello to the free tech master, Loki.
109000	110000	Hello.
110000	112000	Terrible transition, I know. How are you, Loki?
112000	113000	I'm doing fine.
113000	115000	And what won the dinner lottery for tonight?
115000	118000	Ultimate cheeseburger from Jack in the Box.
118000	120000	Healthy as always, huh?
120000	123000	I was hungry. I didn't eat anything all day, so, you know.
123000	127000	Alright, our chat room is open and welcoming your live comments.
127000	133000	Live.vognetwork.com where Breakman in our chat room starts off tonight saying,
133000	137000	Quitting a job is one of the greatest experiences anyone can have.
137000	141000	Was it like that scene from, what movie was that? Was that Half Baked or something?
141000	144000	Where the guys work in a fast food restaurant and he goes,
144000	148000	Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. You're cool. I'm out.
148000	151000	I haven't seen Half Baked. Did I need to?
152000	158000	You need to make like a list, you know, for your, because is Monday going to be your first full day off?
158000	159000	Did you quit Friday or Thursday?
159000	161000	I quit Thursday. She's paying me for Friday.
161000	162000	Okay.
162000	167000	And which I got, I saved, I actually saved a photo of the text message.
167000	169000	So if she doesn't, I can nail her.
169000	173000	Well, I was going to say, on Monday, you should have an unemployment marathon
173000	176000	and you can watch like, you know, Falling Down with Michael Douglas.
176000	178000	You can watch, you know.
178000	179000	You know what?
179000	180000	Half Baked.
180000	181000	On Monday.
181000	182000	Waiting, that would be a good one too.
182000	187000	On Monday, though, I have an appointment in the morning and a job interview.
187000	188000	Oh.
188000	195000	So it was sort of like, and I, it's funny, I, okay, I'll talk about this later, but I got a cat
195000	200000	and I thought I could go pick her up a little bit early and then I ended up forgetting the paperwork at home,
200000	201000	so I had to turn back around.
201000	206000	The moment I started unlocking my door, I called about the other jobs, so.
206000	207000	Well, let's talk about that.
207000	211000	I did want to start off, you know, before we get into how was our gaming week.
211000	213000	We have some personal life updates we wanted to get out there.
213000	216000	And so, yes, let's talk about Dark Sakura.
216000	218000	Mommy once again for a new kitty, right?
218000	220000	Yes, I have a new cat.
220000	221000	Her name is Midna.
221000	225000	I almost named her Aerie, but Midna seems to fit her better.
225000	226000	She's very impish.
226000	228000	And there's people that might not catch the reference.
228000	231000	It's from Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess.
231000	232000	There you go.
232000	236000	Which is funny, the other day I was like, so our little princess is perched on the couch
236000	240000	and Dan's like, yeah, Twilight Princess.
240000	242000	It was pretty funny.
242000	246000	She's about eight months old, maybe a little older, I don't know, but she's tiny.
246000	251000	She's still tiny and very lithe and has lime green eyes and she's all black.
251000	254000	Actually, I thought she was all completely black,
254000	258000	but she has like a few little white hairs scattered across her chest.
258000	259000	Sounds like Maruko.
259000	261000	Yeah, but she's really short-furred.
261000	264000	She's short-furred, but she does walk with her tail in the air like he did.
265000	272000	She's not really, I'd say, she doesn't press about, you know, but she does jump around a lot.
272000	275000	And she adopted one of Shermie's toys as hers.
275000	279000	So I was like, well, Shermie loved it, so I'm glad the new kitty loves it.
279000	281000	But she's so smart.
281000	286000	She comes in the back room, looks at me, and then runs away.
286000	287000	And I'm like, what?
287000	292000	So she runs back in the room and looks at me and makes a squeak, so I follow her.
292000	295000	She picks up this toy in her mouth.
295000	298000	It's like one of these long felt things on a string.
298000	302000	She picks it up in her mouth, carries it over to me, and drops it at my feet.
302000	304000	Like, hear mother play.
304000	305000	So I was like, okay.
305000	306000	She does this all the time.
306000	311000	And then like when I'm done playing, she'll just pick it up and carry it off in the corner and start licking it.
311000	315000	And she hasn't had any accidents.
315000	320000	Normally, in my experience with a kitten, they have like a couple little poopy or pee-pee accidents.
320000	321000	Not a single one.
321000	323000	She knows where her box is.
323000	324000	Good kitty.
324000	325000	Yeah, she's a good baby.
325000	328000	And she's just smart and she's cuddly.
328000	332000	But because she's still kind of a kitten, she loses attention really quickly.
332000	334000	So she's like, okay, I'm done cuddling play.
334000	343000	Tigerclaw, our resident internet research expert at live.vognetwork.com, found the picture that you posted on Twitter this week, apparently.
343000	344000	Yeah, the one picture I did on Twitter.
344000	346000	All the chatters are now going, duh.
346000	348000	But I think I got it uploaded.
348000	352000	If you go to my Tumblr, which is kurotsubasa.
352000	355000	K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A.
355000	359000	Whatever tsubasa is spelled like.
359000	361000	You don't even know how to spell your own damn name.
361000	362000	T-S-U-B-A-S-A.
362000	364000	Maybe you need a less complicated name.
364000	365000	Shut up.
365000	368000	Like janeshepard2.tumblr.com or something.
368000	373000	It's kurotsubasa.tumblr.com.
373000	375000	Maybe that's too much.
375000	376000	No.
376000	383000	But she's, I have a video of her playing on my Tumblr.
383000	385000	I just tried to upload it from my phone.
385000	387000	And Brad, I don't care if you don't like cats.
387000	388000	You don't have to live with her.
388000	389000	She's my cat, not yours.
389000	392000	But she's adorable.
392000	393000	She's sweet.
393000	394000	Dogs can be cute too.
394000	395000	Not really.
395000	396000	Especially corgis.
396000	397000	They stink.
397000	398000	Especially corgis.
398000	402000	I met a corgi at PetSmart when I was buying stuff for Midna.
402000	403000	Were you tempted?
403000	404000	No.
404000	405000	Were you tempted almost?
405000	408000	Because I found out first hand now that I'm actually the same type of allergic to corgis
408000	409000	I am to other dogs.
409000	410000	Oh.
410000	411000	Tragedy.
411000	412000	Yeah.
412000	415000	I keep telling Alan when we get a house someday, it's gonna be Corgi Village.
415000	416000	Yes, break man.
416000	417000	My cat is all black.
417000	421000	But she's got just like a few scattering white furs on her chest.
421000	423000	Like Dark Sakura's heart.
423000	424000	Yeah.
424000	426000	My heart is black with white fur.
426000	427000	Alright.
427000	428000	Anyhow.
428000	430000	Anything else before we move on to other stuff?
430000	432000	She's just funny to watch explore.
432000	433000	She's really cute.
434000	435000	I love my new kitty.
435000	438000	I mean, but I still get a little nostalgic for Shermie, you know?
438000	439000	I can't...
439000	444000	I almost picked up Shermie's mousey to give to the new kitten and I was like, I can't
444000	445000	do it.
445000	449000	Well AkumaJP in our chat room has a theory saying, you know, cats do come back.
449000	450000	Cats do come back.
450000	451000	You never know.
451000	453000	But this cat was alive before Shermie died.
453000	456000	Because I've got her shot records from September.
456000	457000	You never know.
457000	460000	Well, she just doesn't act at all like Shermie did.
460000	462000	She's completely different than Shermie.
462000	465000	I mean, she's cuddly and sweet and everything.
465000	469000	But even, but Shermie was still stupidly neurotic when she was that old.
469000	470000	You don't want to replace it.
470000	471000	Like, you're not trying to replace Shermie.
471000	473000	No, I'm not trying to replace Shermie.
473000	478000	It's not like I'm getting Shermie 2.0, the sequel for MatchingService.com.
478000	481000	You know, I've just got, I've got Midna now.
481000	484000	Although her other nickname, her other name is Ninja.
484000	488000	Because when Dan brought the cousins over and he texted me from home and said, hey,
488000	489000	where's the cat?
489000	490000	Did you take her to the show?
490000	491000	I'm like, no.
491000	494000	First of all, like her carrier is still out in the dining room.
494000	495000	Hello.
495000	499000	And I think that my cat would probably freak out if I tried to bring her.
499000	506000	Um, but, um, Dan ended up finding her under the liner underneath the couch.
506000	509000	Now, Brad would like to clarify what he said earlier.
509000	512000	He says being deathly allergic might have a bit to do with the hatred.
512000	513000	Well, yeah, I could, I could see that.
513000	517000	Well, I'm like that with dogs, but I love dogs, but I'm stupidly allergic to them.
517000	518000	Yeah.
518000	523000	I mean, it probably the only dog I think I could get away with having would be a pit,
523000	524000	a pit or a boxer.
524000	525000	No, thank you.
525000	527000	I'm going to tell you something, Rob.
527000	532000	Pit bulls are actually among the most loyal and sweetest dogs, but they do require a good
532000	533000	trainer.
533000	534000	La, la, la, la, la.
534000	535000	Your sentence didn't contain the word corgi.
535000	536000	Stop caring.
536000	541000	Like I could have like a Yorkie, but Dan is like, they're not real dogs.
541000	542000	All right.
542000	547000	Can we move on from kitty kitty puppy chat as much as I'm sure people, you know, who
547000	549000	did a video game podcast probably wouldn't mind kitty puppy chat.
549000	553000	You know, we do have to talk video games at some point, but my cat's awesome, but I have
553000	554000	another personal story real quick.
554000	555000	Okay.
555000	558000	So oil art today, like seriously almost didn't happen.
558000	560000	And it's because we went to Reno this weekend.
560000	562000	Uh, just, it was a random thing.
562000	564000	I've been having cabin fever lately.
564000	568000	You know, the last big trip we took was when I didn't even go there with Alan.
568000	572000	I went with Victoria, but Disneyland in September was like the last like trip I went outside
572000	573000	of the Bay area.
573000	575000	I don't count Bay area trips cause it's like my second home.
575000	578000	So like, you know, it'd been a few months since we'd really gone anywhere.
578000	579000	So I was like, let's go somewhere.
579000	585000	Let's go to Chico, my old hometown, or let's go to, uh, let's go to Reno or something.
585000	588000	So we decided to go to Reno because we looked at the forecast and it was sunny, sunny, sunny,
588000	589000	sunny, partially cloudy.
589000	591000	We're like, okay, we won't run into any issues.
591000	592000	Sure.
592000	593000	It's winter, but it'll be fine.
593000	596000	We'll be able to see some of the snow that's up there and we can go gamble.
596000	598000	So we drove up there, no problem.
598000	599000	And that's some fun.
599000	602000	And I do want to talk about casinos in a minute because yes, it does relate to video games.
602000	607000	Uh, but then this morning, Oh crap, it snowed overnight.
607000	608000	And apparently, yeah.
608000	612000	Uh, like at least an inch of snow fell over the mountains and that means the chain controls
612000	613000	are on.
613000	614000	Well, I don't have an SUV.
614000	615000	I don't carry chains.
615000	617000	I don't know how to put on chains.
617000	619000	I don't even think I'm supposed to use chains in my car.
619000	621000	I think I have to use these vinyl things regardless.
621000	623000	I don't really want to have to deal with all that fuckery.
623000	624000	So I'm like, great.
624000	626000	Now I'm like the word fuckery.
626000	627000	Yeah.
627000	629000	You'll hear that word a lot on tonight's show, by the way.
629000	632000	Uh, the word of the day is fuckery.
632000	636000	Um, where fucks are made.
636000	638000	That's where the fuck comes from.
638000	641000	That's a fuckery.
641000	648000	Anyhow, speaking of fuckery, uh, we're leaving Reno and uh, yeah, no, finally the snow, I
648000	652000	guess melted around noon cause the sun finally came up and the clouds parted.
652000	655000	I was very happy because I did not want to have to miss tonight's show.
655000	658000	And more importantly, I did not want to have to miss work tomorrow because stupid me doesn't
658000	661000	know how to put chains on a fricking car.
661000	663000	Anyhow, crisis averted.
663000	667000	But the cool thing about being in Reno is that you get to see all the new toys and I'll tell you
667000	670000	what, they dump a lot of money into casino games.
670000	674000	I don't know how often you guys like go into casinos and stuff, but there's a lot of like neat
674000	677000	technology to try and bring in your money.
677000	682000	Um, you may or may not know this, but a company that we've talked about on the show for a long
682000	689000	time, Konami, has a huge, uh, game making business in slot machines.
689000	691000	That's a huge part of their business.
691000	693000	They make a lot of various slot machines.
693000	697000	If you ever, you know, if you're old enough and you're at the casino, look at the corner of some
697000	700000	of the slot machine games, you'll sometimes see that they're made by Konami.
700000	706000	But what really like struck me as interesting is that a lot of the, um, okay, wait, I have to
706000	710000	clarify this cause the folks in chat are like, really?
710000	711000	An inch of snow?
711000	713000	You were freaking out over an inch of snow.
713000	714000	Hold on. All right.
714000	716000	In my defense, we're in California.
716000	718000	We don't get like snow ever.
718000	719000	Unless you live in Tahoe.
719000	720000	Unless you, yeah.
720000	723000	California does have its very beautiful snowy parts.
723000	725000	I don't live, I don't live there.
725000	731000	I live in the sacraments where it gets up to 105 or no, my favorite term I heard this week.
731000	734000	100 and fuck.
734000	735000	Sacra ghetto.
735000	740000	I live in Sacra ghetto, California, and it gets up to like 105 here in the summer.
740000	743000	So yes, the littlest snow will freak me out in our cars.
743000	745000	We don't, we don't antifreeze.
745000	747000	What kind of fuckery is antifreeze?
747000	748000	We don't use that shit here.
748000	750000	Like this is just not something we're used to.
750000	753000	So yes, an inch of snow is a big deal.
753000	755000	Thank you, Bobby Black Wolf.
755000	758000	It's not a phrase I say very often on this show.
758000	759000	Oh no, no, no, no.
759000	760000	Just kidding.
760000	762000	But he says, I understand freaking out over an inch of snow.
762000	763000	I live in Georgia.
763000	764000	I'm from Alabama.
764000	768000	We actually did get snow in Mobile, which is technically a subtropical climate, but
768000	770000	everything shuts down and you can't find bread.
770000	773000	SSJ 100 Matt says, you don't need chains for an inch of snow.
773000	774000	You'll be safe in lower gear.
774000	777000	Ah, but is that true going up and down a 5,000 foot mountain?
777000	779000	That's probably the difference.
779000	781000	That's why you're fine.
781000	782000	Eh, whatever.
782000	784000	Anyway, well tell the CHP that.
784000	785000	Okay.
785000	787000	So anyway, we're back to the casino games.
787000	789000	Just drift, man.
789000	790000	Come on.
790000	793000	The part about gaming.
793000	795000	Uh, the part about gaming.
795000	798000	Uh, there are some interesting technology in some of these games.
798000	799000	Okay, so don't laugh.
799000	802000	But Alan and I were looking at a sex in the city slot machine.
802000	804000	It was huge.
804000	805000	Shut up.
805000	807000	I saw the picture and I didn't get the reference.
807000	810000	This thing looked like it was like $100,000 machine.
810000	812000	I mean, it was like super fancy, right?
812000	813000	And we didn't play it.
813000	816000	We didn't give it any money, but we were looking at it cause we're like, this is like,
816000	820000	this screen is like twice the size of what you see on like a Derby's owner club.
820000	822000	And you look at the little.
822000	826000	How ironic that you would use that reference to a horse game.
826000	828000	I see what you did there.
828000	832000	All right, so we're looking at the screen and we look carefully at the little rolls
832000	833000	of the slot machine.
833000	839000	It's in 3D like the screens are in 3D and I'm like, they're using the same technology
839000	841000	in the three, like no glasses or anything, right?
841000	843000	They're using that glasses free technology.
843000	844000	Dan's old phone had it.
844000	849000	That you see in the 3DS and all that stuff on slot machines now.
849000	851000	Man, her face is really long.
851000	857000	Although I have to say I'm like the least girly girl ever cause I didn't understand
857000	859000	the maker of those shoes or whatever.
859000	860000	It's all right.
860000	861000	It's all right.
861000	865000	Uh, so yeah, there was a 3D game I played later.
865000	868000	It was called, um, don't laugh.
868000	871000	It was called ladybug wedding too.
871000	875000	And I won more money on that machine that did anything.
875000	877000	Okay, look, Alan and I have the Alan.
877000	879000	Alan, come here.
879000	881000	I need to put you on the spot.
881000	882000	Hi Alan.
882000	883000	How are you?
883000	884000	What happened?
884000	885000	Good.
885000	886000	Did you enjoy Reno?
886000	887000	I did.
887000	888000	So I'm talking about like some of the technology we saw in the casinos.
888000	891000	Did you find the technology that they use in slot machines like fascinating?
891000	892000	Yeah.
892000	899000	Um, once we passed the big monolith sex in the city thing to make fun of it.
899000	905000	Um, I then started noticing those 3D screens on a lot of the other newer machines and it
905000	910000	was kind of like how the 3DS is where it's not so much that it pops out, but especially
910000	915000	like it, it looks like recess, like you can see like, you know, an inch, like it looks
915000	917000	like you're looking inside the screen.
917000	921000	Uh, code man in our chat room says I work in the casino business and Konami has a whole
921000	923000	separate business for casinos.
923000	924000	They work closely with Bali.
924000	927000	They, they make some amazing pinball machines and code man continues.
927000	931000	Those machines are made up, have four separate screens on top of each other.
931000	933000	It was interesting to see them broken down.
933000	937000	The ladybug game I was playing had that thing going on, but the sex in the city was like
937000	941000	a true 3D, but yeah, the four screen 3D trick was really cool.
941000	944000	Like it was, it was a neat effect, but okay.
944000	949000	So to justify why I was playing ladybug wedding to tell the listeners about your strategy
949000	954000	when it comes to slot machines, my friend, uh, Ira, who I've known for several years,
954000	960000	um, he made a comment on the picture post I made on Facebook of the sex in the city
960000	962000	city machine and he's like, I'm dead serious.
962000	967000	Play the gayest, most flamboyant slots you can find.
967000	972000	Cause I did, I played some like unicorn magic bullshit in Las Vegas and won $1,100.
972000	975000	And I was like, all right, so I played a unit.
975000	978000	I found a unicorn slot and I found it too.
978000	979000	Guess how gay this is?
979000	982000	Village people themed slot machines.
982000	984000	I was down about 25 bucks.
984000	987000	I made all my money back and ended the night ahead, $12.
988000	991000	This, this motherfucker hit the super jackpot on the village people slot machine.
991000	992000	Yeah.
992000	994000	I put in a five and it cashed out like $37.
994000	997000	I was like, I just made all my money back and I'm ahead 12.
997000	1000000	I cause I thought I just blew 20 bucks.
1000000	1002000	I don't even want, I made it all back.
1002000	1005000	You get with hitting the super jackpot on a village people machine.
1005000	1008000	Well, ironically, like a stage show occurring.
1008000	1011000	Ironically, you're trying to avoid the pooper.
1011000	1016000	And yes, on the, on the little bonus stage, you're trying, you hit these little things.
1016000	1020000	It's a party pooper, but yeah, like a nerd pops up cause they're doing the disco.
1020000	1024000	And then if you click the wrong record, this nerd's like, what are you guys doing?
1024000	1025000	This music's too loud.
1025000	1027000	And then you end the, you end the bonus stage.
1027000	1028000	And he's the pooper.
1028000	1029000	You're trying to avoid the pooper.
1029000	1030000	Did I tell a lie?
1030000	1042000	So yeah, I was looking for, and some of the slot machine themes are like jungle prince, lion king, fluffy poodle deluxe.
1042000	1043000	Like every absurd.
1043000	1044000	I played kitty glitter.
1044000	1045000	Yeah, kitty glitter.
1045000	1052000	And the amount of times my peripheral vision misread hot slots is hot slots.
1052000	1053000	And I had to look and go, what?
1053000	1056000	Oh, slots that happened like a dozen times.
1056000	1059000	So what was your favorite machine that you played?
1059000	1063000	Well, the village people, cause I went all the money on it.
1063000	1067000	I was actually going to say, I also like seeing the loosest sluts ever.
1068000	1074000	Uh, quickly, the other 3d one, I saw you playing something like miss red, which was slutty red riding hood.
1074000	1081000	They have all of these, um, princess sort of thing, but they're all like sexed up like Scarlet hood.
1081000	1085000	And she's got like a bikini on and the Wolf's all drooly and pervy.
1085000	1089000	I played one red riding hood game that I didn't like.
1089000	1092000	And then I played another one that I actually did really well on.
1092000	1096000	I could have, I, I made like five bucks and then I was like, all right, I made five.
1096000	1099000	I may as well spin it back down and I ended up losing it.
1099000	1100000	But that one I really liked.
1100000	1104000	And that had a great 3d screen with a lot of little neat animations on it.
1104000	1105000	I can't believe it.
1105000	1106000	Leave it to the internets.
1106000	1107000	Tiger claw found a video.
1107000	1111000	Here's little ladybug two penny slot bonus mode.
1111000	1114000	You don't really see the 3d effect on this thing.
1114000	1116000	That was the game I was playing.
1116000	1119000	That's, I wouldn't mind.
1119000	1120000	Just so you guys know, I'm not making it up.
1120000	1121000	Thank you.
1121000	1122000	Tiger.
1122000	1123000	Okay.
1123000	1124000	I'm giving the mic back to Jamie.
1124000	1125000	All right.
1125000	1126000	Thank you, Alan.
1126000	1127000	I think it's kind of wrong that someone just scored with KKK.
1127000	1128000	King, King, King.
1128000	1129000	Shut up.
1129000	1130000	I'm from Alabama.
1130000	1131000	All right.
1131000	1132000	Wow.
1132000	1133000	No, thank you.
1133000	1134000	All right.
1134000	1139000	Uh, let's see what else I want to say about, um, casinos and all that stuff.
1139000	1140000	I don't know.
1140000	1144000	I just think it's interesting that a lot of the stuff we see in like console gaming and
1144000	1148000	all that we see for adult gaming as well.
1148000	1150000	And that a lot of the same companies are involved.
1150000	1151000	I thought it was interesting.
1151000	1152000	Technology.
1152000	1153000	Yay.
1153000	1154000	Uh, really?
1154000	1157000	Loco Poco links to crazy taxi slots.
1157000	1160000	They have slot machines for all sorts of weird things.
1160000	1163000	Like the hangover, the movie has a slot machine.
1163000	1164000	Like really?
1164000	1165000	Of course.
1165000	1166000	It was in Vegas.
1166000	1168000	Yeah, I guess, but we were in Reno.
1168000	1169000	Oh, okay.
1169000	1174000	Well then they can't have any sort of, you know, Nevada gambling themed slot machines
1174000	1175000	in other parts of Nevada.
1175000	1178000	Oh, this is just the bonus feature in the Dreamcat.
1178000	1181000	I thought this was an actual crazy taxi slot machine, but no, this is just the little bonus
1181000	1183000	feature in the home version.
1183000	1185000	You sneaky little bastard.
1185000	1186000	All right.
1186000	1188000	Uh, anyhow, let's move on.
1188000	1191000	I guess we can get into chat rooms looking for all these slot machines now.
1191000	1192000	I know.
1192000	1194000	Look, I got y'all thinking about gambling pachinko.
1194000	1195000	All right.
1195000	1198000	Let's talk about video games and console games and the things we've been playing this week.
1198000	1200000	And then I have some housekeeping for tonight as well.
1200000	1201000	That's important.
1201000	1203000	So let's get to our gaming weeks first dark soccer.
1203000	1204000	How was your gaming week?
1204000	1206000	My gaming week was kitty.
1206000	1211000	No, actually, um, I played Mass Effect 2 again cause I'm, I think I finally mastered
1211000	1212000	fly cam.
1212000	1219000	And, uh, if anyone wants to go to mass effecting.tumblr.com, you can see, um, a bunch of, uh, really
1219000	1222000	neat, uh, screen grabs I was able to do with the fly cam.
1222000	1230000	And then, um, I, uh, I played a game that I'm going to be, well, I didn't play it for
1230000	1235000	very long, but, um, I played a game called Chomp Man, which we will be talking about
1235000	1236000	today.
1236000	1237000	And, uh, that's really about it.
1237000	1240000	I've had kind of a alarming week, so.
1240000	1241000	Alrighty.
1241000	1242000	Uh, Loki.
1242000	1245000	Um, I didn't play a whole lot this week.
1245000	1247000	I played actually a little bit of Minecraft last night.
1247000	1254000	Um, I was bored and my wife got into the next series of terrible TV shows that I'm going
1254000	1256000	to have to sit through the entire series of.
1256000	1259000	This new series is Grey's Anatomy.
1259000	1262000	I get to sit through the whole series of Grey's Anatomy.
1262000	1263000	I'm sorry.
1263000	1264000	Run.
1265000	1268000	I'm, I'm thinking it's starting to go in my head because I don't think it's actually that
1268000	1269000	bad right now.
1269000	1270000	It's, it.
1270000	1271000	You are so wet.
1271000	1273000	I'm not, no, I'm not watching it.
1273000	1275000	I'm playing Skyrim, okay, with headphones on.
1275000	1279000	So occasionally I'll see Katherine Heigl, like, take off her clothes and stuff.
1279000	1281000	So I'm like, okay, this is not so bad.
1281000	1288000	But, um, yeah, so it's just, you know, it's brief bits of Katherine Heigl.
1288000	1293000	But anyways, so yeah, the other thing I've been playing, Skyrim, um, on PC with all the
1293000	1298000	mods and stuff and, um, kind of retracing my steps I did on the console version since
1298000	1302000	I have, I'm probably going to play through the whole game now on PC because, um, well,
1302000	1304000	I have more expansions on there.
1304000	1307000	I bought the two expansions out right now and probably will buy Dragonborn when that
1307000	1308000	comes out.
1308000	1315000	Um, I actually bought some more games on Steam today, but ironically most of my game purchases
1315000	1317000	now are not coming from, like, Steam sales.
1317000	1321000	They're coming from Amazon sales, which, you know, all the games redeem on Steam.
1321000	1322000	They had one today.
1322000	1324000	It was, well, they got to compete.
1324000	1325000	They're doing a good job.
1325000	1328000	Uh, they have station three is doing a similar approach.
1328000	1329000	This whole, like, what is it?
1329000	1331000	13 for 13.
1331000	1334000	Like little big planet carding is $10 right now.
1334000	1335000	Like I ought to be pissed.
1335000	1338000	I bought that game when it was brand new, like 50 bucks.
1338000	1342000	Considering doing that, except we, we have some free goods that are, we're sitting on.
1342000	1348000	I'm trying to get in, um, uh, trying to do that, but yeah, they actually have a sale
1348000	1349000	going on right now.
1349000	1350000	It's their weekly.
1350000	1352000	It's five game arcade packs.
1352000	1355000	And now I thought first I'm all Xbox live arcade.
1355000	1356000	That's not bad.
1356000	1359000	Um, but it's actually seen games, but they were featured on Xbox live arcade.
1359000	1365000	It's, uh, um, insanely twisted shadow planet, dead light, iron brigade, mark the ninja
1365000	1367000	and toy soldiers for $10.
1367000	1371000	Or if you did purchase one of those packs during December, you get another $5 off.
1371000	1372000	So I did.
1372000	1376000	And so I got it for five bucks, five games for five bucks.
1376000	1377000	That's not a bad deal.
1377000	1381000	And so I'm kind of having this huge collection of games, mostly indie games that are going
1381000	1385000	to be on this, you know, on my steam account, which eventually I'm hoping this year to build
1385000	1388000	a nice new media PC to hook up to my TV.
1388000	1390000	That'll be kind of my new gaming thing.
1390000	1396000	Cause I've been getting a lot more games through steam for cheap than buying console games.
1396000	1400000	I mean, I do play console games still, but you know, it's kind of think of it like the
1400000	1402000	fallout shelter of the game industry.
1402000	1406000	If everything, everything goes to shit with the new consoles, I at least have this backup,
1406000	1409000	um, you know, library of games to play.
1409000	1411000	So that's going to be fun.
1411000	1415000	Um, some folks in chat talking about the price, a little big planet carding, uh, critical
1415000	1418000	myths said carding was $10 with PlayStation plus.
1418000	1419000	I think that is correct.
1419000	1423000	The $10 price is when you, it's like 14 bucks.
1423000	1424000	If you don't, it's cheap.
1424000	1425000	It's still very cheap.
1425000	1427000	I paid 50 for it.
1427000	1430000	So, so sit down basically.
1430000	1432000	But yes, thank you for the clarification.
1432000	1433000	Yes.
1433000	1434000	For PlayStation plus.
1434000	1437000	Um, and then, uh, what else did I play this week?
1437000	1441000	Oh, um, other things, um, more quality of course, cause we're still playing quality.
1441000	1443000	I'm still trying to get them to play something else.
1443000	1447000	Um, I have been trying to soft mod some Xbox systems.
1447000	1452000	You found five Xbox systems in a closet, literally at my work.
1452000	1455000	Um, but they're broken in different ways, each one.
1455000	1459000	So I'm trying to, I'm going to have to piece some together this week to get one that actually
1459000	1460000	works.
1460000	1461000	Like I've got some that the disk drive doesn't work.
1461000	1463000	One that the audio chip is messed up.
1463000	1465000	One that doesn't power on.
1465000	1469000	You know, but together with five systems, we should have enough to build one or two
1469000	1471000	that are, you know, working correctly.
1471000	1473000	And I have all the stuff now to soft mod them.
1473000	1476000	So, hopefully I'll be able to do that.
1476000	1480000	And put some emulators on there, cause that's what we're going to do with those things.
1480000	1484000	And then, uh, what else did I do this week?
1484000	1486000	Huh, that's pretty much it.
1486000	1489000	I meant to play some more console games, but just didn't get around to it.
1490000	1492000	A little Borderlands 2 actually, we played a little bit of that.
1492000	1493000	A little bit.
1493000	1495000	Uh, my week was mostly console games.
1495000	1498000	One console game that was a majority of my gaming time.
1498000	1502000	It's a game I said I wasn't going to buy, and then I had a moment of weakness and I bought it anyway.
1502000	1503000	And I'm actually glad I did.
1503000	1508000	It's Ni No Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch, which came out this week on PlayStation 3.
1508000	1512000	Um, I've sunk, you know, keep in mind guys, I was gone all weekend.
1512000	1515000	I sunk about eight hours into the game during the week.
1515000	1519000	Uh, and for those that have played the game, I'll keep this as spoiler free as possible.
1519000	1521000	I'm at the volcano.
1521000	1523000	Ooh, there's a volcano in the game somewhere.
1523000	1524000	Uh, that's about where I'm at.
1524000	1529000	But keep in mind, I've done like every side quest, and I'm very O.C. about kind of trying to do everything.
1529000	1532000	And there is a lot of side quests and things you can do.
1532000	1537000	Um, Ni No Kuni, first off, the first thing you're going to notice about the game is the graphics.
1537000	1539000	It's a gorgeous game.
1539000	1540000	You know, it's level five.
1540000	1548000	Who I didn't, you know, I knew they'd done Dragon Quest VIII and all that, but it didn't really click for me until I started playing Ni No Kuni.
1548000	1552000	I'm like, why does this feel a lot like White Knight Chronicles to me?
1552000	1554000	Oh, because level five did that game.
1554000	1556000	But don't let that comparison scare you off.
1556000	1561000	It just, they have, like, the fonts are similar and some of the graphics are a little similar.
1561000	1563000	But the art style is very, very different.
1563000	1564000	The gameplay is very different too.
1564000	1568000	I don't want people who didn't like White Knight Chronicles to say like, oh, well fuck that then.
1569000	1573000	Um, which I do think though, White Knight Chronicles is underrated, but that's another episode.
1573000	1577000	Um, there's, uh, great graphics in the game.
1577000	1585000	And one thing I really like about it is that it goes from, you know, you got this in-game anime style rendering that goes on
1585000	1593000	to actual cutscenes that Studio Ghibli did of anime that's intermixed in with the game.
1593000	1599000	It is very interesting to me how you'll get these full-blown anime sequences, and then you get some voice-over sequences,
1599000	1603000	and then you get text. Like, read the text.
1603000	1610000	But, I don't know, like, it doesn't bother me as much as it bothers other people because maybe that's just what I grew up on.
1610000	1617000	You know, back in my day, when I played Final Fantasy VI, or as we were calling it, Final Fantasy III,
1617000	1621000	because, you know, we didn't have the internet back then, I didn't know that there were more games in Japan,
1621000	1626000	we would read all the text. You know, that's just kind of how you did it. So it doesn't really bother me as much.
1626000	1630000	Um, but the game is gorgeous. Soundtrack's great, too.
1630000	1640000	The soundtrack is by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, who I believe also did the music in Dragon Quest VIII.
1640000	1647000	So, there's actually a lot in common with Dragon Quest VIII. I mean, the art style's very similar, and the music sounds very similar.
1648000	1655000	There's also that whole Pokemon element of the game, and this slowly unfolds. I mean, you don't have it all right in the very beginning,
1655000	1661000	it slowly unfolds over the first few hours of the game, but yes, many of the monsters you run across in-game you can actually capture,
1661000	1668000	and you use them in battle. And the battle system is really interesting, and this is where the demo really failed.
1668000	1673000	And I know a lot of folks, you know, I'm sure a lot of you here at VoG heard Bobby talk about how he hated the demo,
1673000	1678000	and I even said it was really disappointing as well, too, because it didn't really explain things at all.
1678000	1682000	Well, the first five hours of the game do a much better job explaining the battle system,
1682000	1688000	and how you actually are supposed to be switching quite frequently between yourself, your little Pokemon people,
1688000	1695000	and, you know, in later stages of the game, controlling other members of your party, essentially, who are usually controlled by an AI,
1695000	1701000	but you might have to switch to a particular individual to actually catch one of the little monsters.
1701000	1712000	So, the battle sequences are actually very intricate. They're kind of Final Fantasy XII-ish, in that you actually run around a little battlefield,
1712000	1723000	and you're, you know, doing the auto-attack, and you might cast magic, and you actually collect a little health and magic capsules that help you out on the battlefield.
1723000	1733000	Yeah, it's a neat system. Some of the battles can be challenging, but there is an easy mode, or as I call it, easy modes in games now,
1733000	1739000	thanks to some inside jokes here at the VoG network. I call it Black Wolf Fun Forever mode, BFF mode.
1739000	1744000	So, yes, there is a Black Wolf Fun Forever mode, or easy mode in the game, and I haven't had to use it yet,
1744000	1750000	but I'm not afraid to if I run into a wall. I have really loved the story so far. It's been fantastic.
1750000	1758000	Now, I have read some things online that a lot of critics were starting to razz the game around the 15-hour mark,
1758000	1762000	that it starts to get really grindy, and that the story loses a lot of steam and so forth.
1762000	1767000	I'm not there yet. I can't comment on that, so when I'm talking about how much I'm into this game,
1767000	1771000	you might want to take that with a grain of salt. I said it right up front. I'm only eight hours into the game,
1771000	1778000	but it's a damn fine eight hours that I've spent so far, and that's more I can say about other games that I've plunked a large sum of money on.
1778000	1783000	So, take it or leave it. I'm having a great time with the game so far, and I do plan to finish it.
1783000	1790000	I don't see why I wouldn't at this point. So, yeah, I recommend it. At least rent it, but don't go off that demo.
1790000	1798000	The demo was terrible. The demo, all they had to do was back up the demo about 20 minutes to really explain,
1798000	1806000	because the demo where you're fighting the boss monster takes place about 20 minutes after you get your little Pokemon
1806000	1810000	or your little monster for the first time, and it explains how all that works.
1810000	1816000	I don't understand why they didn't just back the demo up 20 minutes and let you play through that little dungeon-y area
1816000	1821000	to the boss and then end the demo there. That was a poor, poor, poor decision.
1821000	1829000	And, you know, it's causing some people to think twice about the game. Oops. Demos are important, y'all.
1830000	1835000	So, let's see, going to the chat room. Breakman says,
1835000	1839000	Interesting is not a word that most listeners want to hear as a description of a game.
1839000	1844000	Interest equals what the fuck was the dev thinking? Seriously, they could have done a better job.
1844000	1850000	But you're being as vague as apparently I am. Like, why do you think the dev was smoking crack?
1850000	1855000	Or why do you think they could have done a better job? Maybe I'm missing something about that comment.
1855000	1861000	I don't know, but I don't, you know, where's the part that I'm not catching, apparently?
1861000	1866000	Again, those are live comments at our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
1866000	1870000	Some other comments on the game in our chat room. Dungeonbuster says,
1870000	1874000	Still liking the game right now, even with the issues, though I'm a big fan of Ghibli's stuff.
1874000	1881000	Dungeonbuster also says, Battle system kind of falls apart later. The AI roles for your party members is kind of challenged.
1881000	1889000	You know, I am noticing that a little bit, that the party members are very liberal in their use of magic,
1889000	1894000	which is very unlike the style I play with, and I can see where that gets really frustrating, but
1894000	1900000	I think it's manageable right now. And you always get to fill up on your HP and MP before a boss.
1900000	1909000	So I'm not, I'm not hating it as much as other people do.
1910000	1916000	Let's see, LocoPoco says, I love Studio Ghibli, but honestly I didn't like the battle system in the demo at all.
1916000	1918000	Well, you couldn't have, they didn't explain it.
1918000	1925000	Let's see, RawSteelUT says, All BreakMan is saying is that interesting is what people tend to say when they can't be wholly complimentary.
1925000	1932000	See, I'm scared to be wholly complimentary because of, you know, what I'm seeing, or what I've heard about the future and so forth.
1932000	1942000	So I don't know, I am enjoying, yes, if I were to judge this game on the eight hours alone, I would say, yes, this is a must buy if you love JRPGs.
1942000	1944000	But then is that really fair?
1944000	1946000	Would you judge it on white barf?
1946000	1950000	Yes, and there are all these types of like little references and jokes that I love.
1950000	1954000	Yes, there is a look for it in the grocery store in the very beginning of the game.
1954000	1960000	There's a little sign in the background that says, what does it say? Like, yay, milk, it's white barf or something like that.
1960000	1961000	Like, what?
1961000	1965000	AkumaJP says, Without Ghibli, the game is just another rogue galaxy.
1965000	1969000	No, I don't agree. Sorry.
1969000	1978000	I think it's, I mean, the Ghibli stuff lends itself great, but Studio Ghibli wasn't involved with Dragon Quest 8.
1978000	1983000	And, you know, that was a lot of the similar things I like in both games.
1984000	1988000	Anyhow, there you go. That's my thoughts. Take it or leave it.
1988000	1995000	I'll let you know in next week, after another eight hours of the game, if I'm still as enthusiastic about the game as I am now.
1995000	2000000	For now, however, let us move on and talk about a little bit of housekeeping tonight.
2000000	2002000	I want to start off with this tonight.
2002000	2008000	Okay, so you know how we don't really ask for money here at Orange Lounge Radio.
2008000	2015000	We do this because, you know, we want to have fun and, you know, we just invite you guys here to spend the show with us.
2015000	2018000	And, you know, it's more about the community and so forth.
2018000	2023000	And we don't actually have these illusions that we're going to profit off the show or anything like that, right?
2023000	2028000	Well, occasionally, once in a while, we get these awesome, unsolicited things.
2028000	2032000	So I want to share with you guys something that was donated to the show this week.
2032000	2035000	It wasn't money, but it's still pretty awesome. You guys want to see it?
2035000	2039000	So we got a gift this week, FedEx, here to the studio. So you ready?
2039000	2040000	All right.
2040000	2041000	No peeking!
2041000	2045000	Okay. I hope it's chocolate, because I want some.
2045000	2046000	No peeking!
2046000	2049000	If you guessed rabid weasel, you are correct.
2049000	2051000	I want a weasel.
2054000	2059000	Booze. Someone sent us booze. That was Brad from Pod Culture, who also-
2059000	2061000	Do not open this in front of me or I will throw up.
2061000	2063000	I thought that might have actually been maple syrup for a second there.
2063000	2065000	Oh, are you not a fan?
2065000	2069000	Anything that's fake cinnamon, if I remotely smell it, makes me nauseous.
2069000	2074000	Oh, look at that. I can't believe you would talk negatively about a gift so graciously.
2074000	2078000	No, no, no. I appreciate the gift. It's very nice. But anything that is-
2078000	2085000	For real, I'm the same way with spearmint. Like, anything that's real or fake spearmint, it makes me nauseous.
2085000	2087000	Well, I'll say this more for me. That's fine by me.
2087000	2088000	You're welcome to it.
2088000	2089000	That's fine by me.
2089000	2091000	Okay, I'll try to smell it.
2091000	2096000	There you go. There you go. Anyhow, no, don't open it. Save it for $500.
2096000	2101000	Brad from Pod Culture sent that. He also donated the mics that we use here on the show.
2101000	2102000	Which we appreciate.
2102000	2110000	They're kind of hand-me-downs from Pod Culture, but they work great, obviously, as you can hear, and help the quality of our show immensely.
2110000	2117000	So, this is a nice big bottle of Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey, and he gave me some mixer ideas to use with this as well.
2117000	2121000	So, and it looks like it burned a hole in the back of the bottle. Hooray.
2121000	2129000	Well, thank you. It was very nice of you to send it to us, and I will, um, I'll see if it makes me ill.
2129000	2133000	I'll invite Rice Princess over for the 500th episode. She'll drink it. All right.
2133000	2138000	Although, we should probably pick up some Goldschlager for that.
2138000	2140000	Wait a minute. The Goldschlager is cinnamony, too.
2140000	2143000	It's butterscotch. Isn't Goldschlager butterscotch?
2143000	2145000	I don't know. I always taste the cinnamon in me.
2145000	2146000	Butterscotch. It's burning.
2146000	2147000	Are you thinking, like, butternips?
2147000	2148000	It tastes like burning.
2148000	2149000	I don't know. I'm thinking of Goldschlager.
2149000	2151000	Goldschlager just tastes like burning.
2151000	2162000	All right. Let's talk about something else, too, I want to do in housekeeping, and I want to talk about an article that was on our website that our pal Bobby Blackwolf posted that I thought was really good.
2162000	2172000	And I don't like to talk about this subject a lot on our show because it keeps coming up as news, and I say for about the past four years, nothing this thing has done.
2172000	2179000	It has been gaming news, but G4 television kind of finally ended of sorts this week.
2179000	2185000	Technically, I think they're still going to run off reruns for a couple months while they do that transition to the Esquire channel.
2185000	2194000	However, they did have a pretty awesome end to Attack of the Show with a little scene that tipped the hat back to tech TV, which I thought that was the way to end it.
2194000	2210000	But what I want to point out is that at vognetwork.com, Bobby, who does the show before us, did a great little article kind of reflecting back on the better days of G4 when it actually was kind of an extension of an online network about video games and things like that.
2210000	2216000	And how that all started and kind of being in the community when all that was going on.
2216000	2223000	Because I never knew that some of their shows had live chat rooms that you could go in and actually chat during the show and all that.
2223000	2236000	But anyway, Bobby and I have talked offline about some of that stuff, so I knew a few of the stories, but even in reading the article, I just kind of see it all in one place, and there was even a few things in there I didn't know about about his involvement early on.
2236000	2250000	So it was a really neat kind of reflection piece. It's not news so much as it is, hey, I was a big supporter of this network up until the day that they basically squashed tech TV, and it was a great read.
2250000	2254000	So check that out at vognetwork.com.
2255000	2263000	Alright, let's move on now I guess into some video game news. I think that was all my housekeeping. Booze and G4. Alright, appropriate.
2263000	2264000	Yes.
2264000	2267000	Let's move on to what is going on this week in gaming. Loki.
2267000	2281000	So one of the big things that happened this week was THQ's assets were finally auctioned off, and unfortunately their original plan to have one person buy everything and them kind of get out of debt just didn't happen.
2281000	2290000	So THQ is no more, and all of their assets have been split up. So here's what happened where everything went.
2290000	2299000	So first thing, Relic and Company of Heroes, the IP that Relic had, actually went to Sega.
2299000	2307000	So Sega is going to be doing that, which makes sense because they have some RTS franchises that they work on. So that should be cool.
2307000	2328000	And then of course THQ Montreal, the studio as well as the two IPs, 1666 and underdog. Those went to Ubisoft. So they're going to have that now, as well as let's see Evolve which was an unannounced IP that I guess they're also saying it's called metamorphosis.
2328000	2342000	That went to Take-Two, Volition and Saints Row, as well as I think it was just those two. So Volition, the studio, and Saints Row, and I'm assuming Red Faction and all that stuff.
2342000	2349000	That actually went to Koch, which is Deep Silver. That's the studio name you'd recognize.
2349000	2354000	Homefront went to Crytek, which should be interesting if we get a sequel out of that.
2354000	2371000	Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light, that went to Deep Silver as well. And then South Park, the Stick of Truth, the license for that went to Ubisoft. So they will be publishing that game later this year.
2372000	2378000	That game should have been almost done. That was slated to come out in what, April, right?
2378000	2391000	It was March, but then it got pushed a little bit. It was supposed to be like second quarter. So the other one was the WWE franchise that went to Take-Two as well. So you're going to be seeing that coming out under the 2K Games license.
2391000	2393000	But none for Darksiders.
2393000	2395000	Nothing for Darksiders.
2395000	2402000	A lot of people are very upset about that, which kind of surprised me, because if you think there would be enough upset people, somebody would have bought it.
2402000	2417000	Well, from what I read, there was, I guess there were other franchises, the same, how was it, Vergil or Vigil was working out. Apparently that was also very risky, I guess, as far as an investment goes.
2417000	2427000	But you would think that they would, I would have thrown a dollar down for it, but you know, I don't know. Some of these actually, it's kind of funny what they paid for.
2427000	2435000	Then you have to pay all those employees. A dollar might have bought you a studio, but then how do you pay the employees? That's the problem. Somebody's got to bankroll.
2435000	2442000	Just buy the IP. Make a crappy cell phone game out of it or something. Resell it. I don't know.
2443000	2451000	So, yeah, no one bought it. Although it may, you know, go to someone else.
2451000	2461000	The other thing, too, is we don't know who's going to end up with all of the back catalog stuff, because that didn't necessarily go to the respective publishers that bought the new franchises.
2461000	2472000	That's just the stuff that was coming out. Older games, that's going to go to completely different people. So, I'd be interested to see how that turns out.
2473000	2481000	Rossdielut in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, considering Deep Silver's marketing ideas, I think Saints Row is in the right place.
2481000	2491000	I don't know if that's a very tongue-in-cheek comment, but I just collectively groan at that because of that horrific story from last week with the quote-unquote sculpture.
2491000	2500000	But that's just a foreign company. I mean, that's just like Australia. I mean, they can get away with it, I think. Well, actually, I'm surprised they could kind of get away with that at all.
2500000	2502000	It was Britain, but that's all right. Still.
2502000	2513000	It was Australia and Europe. I mean, whatever. I'm kind of glad, though. I mean, they're trying to, I guess, boost, I guess, their presence in the marketplace.
2513000	2524000	And definitely, those are some game franchises that would do that. I'm not surprised to see, of course, Take Two not buying Saints Row because that would compete too much with Grand Theft Auto.
2524000	2533000	And I was surprised, actually, EA didn't try to pick it up, but maybe they thought that, you know, they've got some of their own stuff and they would just crowd their lineup or something. I don't know.
2533000	2535000	That's true.
2535000	2549000	But they have Homefront. I mean, that's Crytek, and Crytek is published by EA. So, yay, another military shooter game to go along with the other two or three military shooter franchises that they own.
2550000	2563000	I have to say somewhere in here, though, I like that the community has been so supportive of what's been going on at THQ. Like, you know, sometimes we see a lot of these layoffs happen, and it's not that the community doesn't improve.
2563000	2572000	The community has always been very good, but I'm just saying, like, sometimes it seems like what happens at the employee level is really cold. Like, there's a very cold treatment of what happens to people.
2572000	2590000	And I kind of got the sense here that, like, you know, the CEO and a lot of people involved really, like, really felt bad. You know, even though I think a lot of people, you know, you didn't have to be a genius to see that something like this was coming, I got the sense that there was at least compassion for the people that were affected.
2590000	2613000	And certainly the community is like, you know, I've seen other game studios posting, hey, were you at THQ? No longer. You know, we're hiring right now. Come over here. You know, just a lot of, like, Twitter buzz, and I think that's great. I love that gamers are helping other gamers. You don't see that in a lot of areas of work, really. So I think that's really great that everybody's helping each other out.
2613000	2629000	How do you think about how this all went down? I mean, I guess it's not too surprising, but, Loki, what's kind of your impression of, like, you know, how now that we've seen where all the chips fall, do you think some of these properties are in danger? Do you think most of them found a good home or what?
2629000	2647000	That'd be interesting to see what happens in Saints Row, because South Peak, I mean, they've put out a couple, you know, good franchises, but they don't really have a whole ton. Dead Rising was kind of a gamble they did, and some of the other stuff that they put out, you probably, I mean, hell, I don't even remember what they were. That's how memorable they were.
2647000	2657000	I think Dead Rising's kind of already done, too. Like, you know, they tried to put out another one, and it's, like, you know, like... Well, not Dead Rising, I'm sorry, Dead Island. Yeah, you got me started, too. Dead Island.
2657000	2670000	Yeah, Dead Rising's pretty much done. I mean, there'll be another one, but we know there's gonna be another one. But, you know, the last couple haven't been fantastic. At least we know the next Saints Row game will have a great trailer, if nothing else.
2671000	2684000	I'm, you know, it's just a very over-the-top game. I would be interested to see what they're gonna do with it, but, yeah, I mean, South Peak doesn't have a whole lot going for it right now. They don't have a lot of stuff that they're publishing, so it would be kind of nice.
2684000	2686000	That we know about, to be fair.
2687000	2699000	Normally, they don't have a lot that they're publishing. I mean, let's put it this way. Some of their last big games that they had were Two Worlds. That franchise, Two Worlds and Two Worlds 2, which didn't do very well.
2699000	2710000	And they also had, you know, of course, Dead Island, which did well for them. And a lot of other smaller titles that you'll never hear of. They've published some stuff for that.
2710000	2720000	But it's nice to see them actually have some good franchises now. Well, I mean, expanding their catalog, I guess.
2720000	2728000	So, that might be one I had to worry about a little bit, but I was worried about Saints Row IV anyways, when they're like,
2728000	2740000	Yeah, we're gonna take this standalone game expansion that was really just gonna be Saints Row III with some other cheesy bullshit on top of it, and we're gonna make that its own game.
2740000	2754000	Oh, and now we're gonna make that Saints Row IV. So, I'm already kind of worried about the game, just because of how they've treated it, especially with the DLC and stuff.
2755000	2757000	Hopefully they build it into something good.
2757000	2763000	As long as they keep that humor. As long as they still have all the same writers, because Saints Row III is so fucking funny.
2763000	2771000	I want to say, I was trying to, I should have looked real quick. What they bought it for, it was, man, if only you had the money.
2771000	2773000	Oh yeah, because you got that kind of money lying around.
2773000	2775000	I know, holy man.
2775000	2777000	It was only a couple million.
2777000	2780000	Yeah, it was only 22.3 million.
2781000	2792000	You see something like Instagram sell for 1 billion dollars, then you see Saints Row goes for less than 1% of that. It's crazy.
2792000	2800000	Well, like, let's see, the cheapest one they had was Homefront. They bought it for half a million dollars. The IP. I mean, I don't know.
2800000	2810000	Alright, well, let's move on to a product now that was pretty much, it sounds like it's over after it barely just began, but it was a little piece of renaissance.
2810000	2821000	It's the Neo Geo X. It's apparently ending production in Japan. Now, if you forgot what the Neo Geo X was, you know, I think we all remember what the Neo Geo was many years ago.
2821000	2823000	It was that very expensive brick of a system.
2823000	2825000	I got a couple of them in my house.
2825000	2828000	Well, and then they show up in arcade machines, right, and all that.
2828000	2834000	You know, it was awesome about having the memory card so you could save your game at the arcade and go home and play it.
2834000	2837000	I'm surprised you didn't pick one of these up, these little Neo Geo X's.
2837000	2840000	There's no point. There's nothing on there that we didn't want that we don't already own.
2840000	2848000	So, well, you would have lost your chance now anyway, because apparently the production of it has come to a halt in Japan. These things just came out in December, so I don't know what's going on.
2848000	2853000	But anyhow, it's not actually discontinuing.
2853000	2854000	Oh?
2854000	2855000	It's the limited-
2855000	2856000	What have you heard that I'm not hearing?
2856000	2864000	Well, the limited edition is being discontinued. The one that comes with Ninja Master, but they're still producing it.
2864000	2872000	I guess, you know, Blaze, which is one of the distributors, said that it's still being available.
2872000	2876000	It's just that the limited edition that was originally the launch lineup is no more.
2876000	2879000	Was there a follow-up that I missed or something? Because I'm not seeing the-
2879000	2881000	Yeah, they did a follow-up.
2881000	2891000	There was a few places around it, Eurogamer's one that had it, and I want to say, I'm trying to think, Engadget also had it.
2891000	2900000	They were saying that, I guess, I don't know. I know I read it, that they were- it wasn't quite discontinued.
2900000	2904000	Well, I'm interested to see how long this can kind of- do you think something like this can sustain itself?
2904000	2905000	Probably all-
2905000	2909000	Since we all believe the fact that it would have disappeared as quick as it showed up.
2909000	2917000	It really should have. I mean, no offense, it's just- I mean, the handheld device itself, it's very similar to what I have with the Dingoo.
2917000	2925000	It's just like this ARM emulator thing that runs Neo Geo games. That's what the Dingoo did, and it does it for a lot cheaper.
2925000	2932000	Just because it's SNK branded and it has this little thing that it plugs into so you can hook up to your TV.
2932000	2942000	He did the same thing with the Dingoo, but it wasn't very, I don't know, pretty, I guess, because you had to have a cable going from your device to the TV.
2942000	2961000	But, no, apparently it is- yeah, it's still going, and even in the US, they said Tomo Inc., the company behind the Neo Geo X says the production hasn't seized on the main Neo Geo stand-alone handheld, but has ceased on the Neo Geo X Gold Limited Edition.
2962000	2964000	But that was the plan anyways.
2964000	2966000	Well, maybe I wanted the Limited Edition.
2966000	2973000	And they're saying they're going to add more games and peripherals and software updates.
2975000	2983000	GameGuru in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says they should just put out the Neo Geo games on PC like Sega does for Genesis games.
2983000	2985000	A few of them are on Wii Virtual Console.
2987000	2998000	Aren't some of them on PlayStation 3 as well? I believe so. I think PlayStation 3 has a few of those games and they're not PS1 classics, obviously, but like a similar classics library.
2998000	3000000	I think they call it like SNK Collection.
3000000	3003000	You do see those Neo Geo games kind of pop up other places.
3003000	3006000	But, correct, I don't think PC is one of them.
3006000	3009000	Although, you know, you just like download MAME.
3009000	3012000	Not that I told you to do that, but we all know.
3012000	3015000	Alright. Let's move on with more news. DarkSakura.
3016000	3024000	Okay. Well, now we know that there's been rumors going around about what is going to be the new Xbox.
3024000	3027000	And we know that there was that completely fabricated story.
3027000	3033000	So, this though is actually what I found was looking to be quite a bit different.
3033000	3037000	They're actually talking about specs up for the system itself.
3037000	3041000	Talking about it under the code name Durango.
3041000	3044000	I don't, again, I don't know if it has anything to do with the rumor.
3044000	3047000	We take everything with a huge grain of salt when it comes to these type of rumors.
3047000	3049000	Yeah, especially since that other story was fabricated.
3049000	3052000	But, you know, it's quite a bit different.
3052000	3060000	So, they're saying that it's code named Durango and that they have a little bit of the tech saying that it's supposed to run on an 8 core CPU.
3060000	3064000	An AMD CPU at 1.6 gigahertz.
3064000	3066000	Just like the new PlayStation thing.
3066000	3072000	And that it's running on the Jaguar technology.
3072000	3081000	And apparently it's supposed to be working with a 32 meg of RAM and 8 gigabytes of memory.
3081000	3084000	It looks like, I think, the graphic memory.
3084000	3087000	So, it's looking pretty, pretty big.
3087000	3090000	I mean, again, I don't know if this is actually true.
3090000	3094000	But it seems to make sense and looks pretty impressive.
3095000	3098000	To be fair, Microsoft does have a history of stuff leaking out.
3098000	3102000	Now, we do know there was that guy on Tumblr that was all,
3102000	3105000	I'm so sick of people making shit up about Microsoft rumors.
3105000	3109000	I'm going to make shit up about Microsoft and spread it all over the internet to prove a point.
3109000	3111000	Alright, dude. Point made.
3111000	3115000	But, you know, so there's all that fake stuff out there.
3115000	3117000	But you don't also know what they say.
3117000	3118000	Where there's smoke, there's fire.
3118000	3122000	And these are the types of things people are talking about and speculating and so forth.
3122000	3127000	So, aside from saying this is true, because we don't know if it's true or not,
3127000	3130000	what do you think about if it was true?
3130000	3134000	Do you think this could be the direction that Microsoft should be going in?
3134000	3135000	Because I'll tell you this.
3135000	3139000	That crap that was made up on the Tumblr and all that, that sounded awful.
3139000	3143000	I mean, I should say it sounded cool.
3143000	3147000	But in reality, the whole tablet being that much integrated into the,
3147000	3149000	it just didn't sound feasible.
3149000	3150000	It just wasn't going to work.
3150000	3154000	This doesn't sound outside the realm of possibility, honestly.
3154000	3157000	This didn't say anything about the tablet at all.
3157000	3160000	It just talked about running power.
3160000	3165000	It also was comparing it with the Orbis graphics for the new PlayStation.
3165000	3169000	And saying that still the Orbis is turning out to be probably more powerful
3169000	3172000	in terms of graphic capability than the new Xbox.
3175000	3178000	It sounds almost pretty much what I expected, anyway.
3178000	3183000	They're going to go with, I think, more of processing with,
3183000	3186000	I think, more in terms of how the Xbox is now.
3186000	3190000	I mean, focus on the games, how they play, not necessarily exactly how they look.
3190000	3193000	Which Sony has always been about Flash.
3195000	3196000	Well, it'll be interesting to see.
3196000	3200000	But at the end of the day, we won't really know until E3.
3200000	3203000	But more speculation to continue until then.
3203000	3205000	Look around E3 a week, though,
3205000	3207000	because didn't Microsoft's entire presentation get blown
3207000	3211000	like the morning of their press conference or something this last year?
3211000	3214000	The Halo 4 stuff all leaked out or something?
3214000	3215000	Yeah.
3215000	3217000	It was either this year or last year.
3217000	3220000	It just all went on the internet the day of or something.
3220000	3221000	It was crazy.
3221000	3225000	Anyhow, more news, Logie.
3225000	3229000	All right, so kind of a similar thing with the PlayStation 3.
3229000	3234000	Kotaku apparently received some documentation.
3234000	3236000	90 PDFs, they say.
3236000	3240000	Wow, that's a lot of PDFs.
3240000	3244000	And this is being released by an individual known as SuperDAE,
3244000	3246000	which you may remember was one of the guys that
3246000	3251000	sold one of the Xbox development kits, the brand new ones for the next system,
3251000	3254000	on eBay, or at least attempted to sell one.
3254000	3258000	And some of the details coming from that spec-wise.
3258000	3261000	Of course, they're saying that it's going to have 8 gigs of RAM,
3261000	3264000	or 2.2 gigabytes of video RAM.
3264000	3270000	They're going to have a CPU that's built out of four dual-core AMD 64 bulldozer processors,
3270000	3272000	so a total of eight cores.
3272000	3276000	A GPU that's AMD R10XX.
3276000	3282000	They haven't really said what kind of GPU yet, but something around that spec.
3282000	3290000	Four USB 3.0 ports, two Ethernet ports, a Blu-ray drive, of course.
3290000	3292000	Why not?
3292000	3295000	And a 160 gigabyte hard drive.
3295000	3302000	As well as, they're saying, HDMI optical 2.0, 5.1, and 7.1 channel sound,
3302000	3307000	which is pretty much similar to what they have right now with the PlayStation 3.
3307000	3311000	The controller, they're not really saying too much about it.
3311000	3314000	It could change.
3314000	3318000	They're saying that the difference right now with the controller
3318000	3321000	is it's going to be similar to the Vita.
3321000	3325000	They're at least going to add some sort of touch sensor to the Vita.
3325000	3331000	I think Robin mentioned that's probably that stupid back touch panel thing.
3331000	3334000	God, I hope not. It's going to be a waste of time.
3334000	3336000	But right now, they're saying that it's got...
3336000	3341000	Stop trying to make back touch happen.
3341000	3343000	Some sort of touch pad on there.
3343000	3346000	Maybe even another...
3346000	3349000	I don't know if they're going to have an actual screen or something on that.
3349000	3352000	They're also doing something with the account management right now,
3352000	3358000	where you're going to be able to, I guess, link local accounts together.
3358000	3363000	I don't really know what that's supposed to do as far as maybe...
3363000	3366000	I don't know if you're downloading...
3366000	3369000	Maybe it's just like, okay, X and X people are on this console.
3369000	3372000	You downloaded DLC, both of you get it.
3372000	3375000	I don't know if that really works.
3375000	3377000	I mean, isn't that how it kind of works now?
3377000	3379000	Is that supposed to be non-intentional that,
3379000	3381000	oh, because I downloaded some DLC on this console,
3381000	3385000	it's not supposed to be available to this other person?
3385000	3387000	I don't know.
3387000	3391000	Could this be all angsty Tumblr person made up too?
3391000	3398000	I don't think so because the guy has had access to what at least was supposed to be a kit.
3399000	3405000	This is supposed to be coming from a developer kit for the next PlayStation system.
3405000	3410000	A lot of this could change, but it's just getting closer to the specs right now.
3410000	3413000	I don't think you're really going to know until the system comes out,
3413000	3415000	but everyone wants to speculate.
3415000	3422000	If you compare this to the Durango Xbox lube specs,
3422000	3424000	they're both very similar.
3424000	3428000	Eight core processors, you're going to have a pretty high-end video card in there,
3428000	3436000	eight gigs of RAM, HDMI, USB 3.0 stuff, and Blu-ray.
3436000	3439000	So they're both pretty similar as far as that goes.
3439000	3442000	It's going to be, I guess, how they use that.
3442000	3445000	It's really going to determine which system is better.
3445000	3448000	Or they're both going to be about the same as they are now.
3448000	3452000	Well, following up with this a little bit and kind of piggybacking on some things
3452000	3454000	we were talking about at the end of 2012.
3454000	3457000	We did a list list right at the end of the year where we were saying,
3457000	3460000	what do you guys think is the biggest prediction in gaming for 2013?
3460000	3463000	And one of the things I put out there that was kind of like half funny
3463000	3467000	but half serious thing is I thought there would be no PlayStation 4 this year,
3467000	3470000	even though everybody's kind of expecting it with the new Xbox.
3470000	3474000	And it was actually voted as the top answer by the listeners.
3474000	3479000	Well, an interesting story this week makes that sound like it may not have been
3479000	3481000	that far off of a prediction.
3481000	3484000	Read into this what you will, but Kazurai, Sony's CEO,
3484000	3487000	talked to the Times this week.
3487000	3490000	And in the business section mentioned kind of in passing
3490000	3493000	that they're waiting to see what Microsoft does before making any announcements
3493000	3495000	regarding PlayStation 4.
3495000	3499000	Harai goes as far as to say they're going to let Microsoft make the first move.
3499000	3502000	I don't know how much of that is kind of like paraphrasing or what.
3502000	3506000	But anyway, the quote from the original article is,
3506000	3509000	why go first when your competitors can look at your specifications
3509000	3511000	and come up with something better?
3511000	3516000	Now, you might remember last time, Sony did go after Microsoft.
3516000	3518000	Microsoft had the jump last time.
3518000	3520000	They were a year ahead of the other guys.
3520000	3525000	This time around, Nintendo went first, but Nintendo's kind of
3525000	3527000	marching to their own little beat now.
3527000	3529000	Yeah, you can't really compare that because spec-wise
3529000	3531000	they're just a little ahead of the presentation.
3531000	3533000	We pat them on the head and go, oh, Nintendo.
3533000	3535000	Well, and they do what works for them.
3535000	3537000	A story I don't think is coming up on tonight's show,
3537000	3540000	but I was reading a little bit about beforehand was,
3540000	3543000	what were the top 20 selling games in Japan last year?
3543000	3545000	They're like all Nintendo games.
3545000	3547000	There's no Xbox, of course, because it's Japan.
3547000	3550000	There's a spittering of PlayStation 3.
3550000	3552000	I think Resident Evil 6 was in there.
3552000	3556000	There was a random PSP game that was some robot game.
3556000	3558000	But most of it is Nintendo.
3558000	3559000	Here's my thought.
3559000	3562000	I know Japan's a pretty decent-sized market,
3562000	3566000	but aren't they kind of declining as far as their market share
3566000	3569000	in the whole big span of everything worldwide,
3569000	3573000	console sales and game sales.
3573000	3575000	Pretty soon that's not going to matter.
3575000	3580000	It's like, okay, here's how the purchasing goes in Australia.
3580000	3586000	It's not going to matter that the consoles don't do well in there, I think.
3586000	3589000	Other interesting comment from chat here,
3589000	3592000	talking about the PlayStation 4.
3593000	3595000	Rasteel UT says, especially with Sony,
3595000	3600000	who can ill afford another $599 US dollar fiasco.
3600000	3604000	Piggybacking on that, maybe wait for some of the tech to become cheaper
3604000	3606000	before they launch their system.
3606000	3608000	Starting it out there.
3608000	3610000	What do you think in hearing what he says?
3610000	3612000	Now, I want to say I saw something else that came out after this
3612000	3616000	that was kind of like that Sony's,
3616000	3620000	this doesn't mean that we're not going to do something competitive or whatever,
3620000	3622000	because obviously they want to keep investors happy,
3622000	3624000	but what do you think this all means, Loki?
3624000	3628000	Do you think there might be actual reason for there not to show the PlayStation 4 this year?
3628000	3630000	Do you think that might actually come to light?
3630000	3632000	I don't know if they're going to show it or not,
3632000	3635000	but I don't think that they can really wait too long.
3635000	3639000	If you think about it, they can't really make their system spec-wise
3639000	3641000	so much greater than the X.
3641000	3643000	I mean, they're not going to do that, for one, because of cost,
3643000	3648000	and two, because when these games are being put out on multi-platforms,
3648000	3650000	which they're probably going to,
3650000	3654000	you're not going to really see that much of a benefit to having additional,
3654000	3659000	I mean, I guess additional power, the game might play a little bit better,
3659000	3663000	but most of the time they're going to be developing it across the board.
3663000	3664000	It's going to be similar.
3664000	3667000	I mean, if you look at the PlayStation 3 versus the Xbox 360,
3667000	3669000	wasn't the PlayStation 3 supposed to be a more powerful system,
3669000	3672000	yet a lot of the games that come out on the PlayStation 3 chug
3672000	3677000	and just don't even have the frame rate that the Xbox 360 games do?
3677000	3679000	So I don't know.
3679000	3683000	I think that they should take the safe approach, actually,
3683000	3690000	and I'm kind of wondering what they're going to do with extra things
3690000	3695000	or gimmicks with these controllers because it didn't work with 6-axis.
3695000	3697000	They tried to make it happen. It just wasn't working,
3697000	3702000	and I don't think touch controls are really going to add anything either.
3702000	3703000	It's just going to be annoying.
3703000	3705000	And Move hasn't really taken off either,
3705000	3708000	even though Move is actually one of the better motion controls.
3708000	3710000	Yeah, I think it is actually pretty good.
3710000	3711000	It's very accurate.
3711000	3716000	In fact, I was trying to play a Kinect party today to show my son this stuff,
3716000	3722000	and we have a window behind in the view of the Kinect,
3722000	3725000	and it wasn't working because there was sun outside.
3725000	3731000	And so Kinect was saying, fuck you, I am not working.
3731000	3735000	So yeah, it seems like the Move stuff works pretty good.
3735000	3740000	But even Nelly was like, so is this supposed to be some big motion controller thing?
3740000	3743000	I'm like, yeah, the next one that comes out will probably be way better.
3743000	3745000	This is just the first generation of it.
3745000	3750000	But then they never work as good as they say they're going to. Never.
3750000	3755000	That's why I'm going to wait because I've already been fooled three or four times.
3755000	3760000	Interesting perspective from Akuma JP in our chat room who actually lives in Japan.
3760000	3766000	AkumaJP at live.vognetwork.com saying, yeah, almost all mobile phone now.
3766000	3771000	Even Tokyo Game Show from last year was all gree, mobage, all mobile now.
3771000	3777000	Even we all now almost all mobile, which I want to say when I looked at that list,
3777000	3780000	it was a lot of 3DS stuff you even saw there.
3780000	3783000	Yeah, and portable, which it doesn't surprise me.
3783000	3788000	It's a different culture in Japan, very different.
3788000	3793000	A lot more of the commuters than you might have here and so forth.
3793000	3798000	And just especially in places like Tokyo, smaller living spaces.
3798000	3800000	Connect just doesn't fucking work there.
3800000	3804000	So handhelds are the way to go.
3804000	3806000	So just different.
3806000	3809000	But the sad thing is we got a lot of mobile stuff here, too.
3809000	3812000	But I don't want to see mobile replace gaming.
3812000	3815000	There's a lot that mobile can't do.
3815000	3818000	Although, ironically enough, we have an interesting story tonight
3818000	3823000	about an online type of game that's trying to emulate console a little more.
3823000	3826000	But there's so much that mobile can't do.
3826000	3828000	It just can't give you that same experience.
3828000	3831000	I don't know.
3831000	3835000	He also explains mobage as a mobile game.
3835000	3839000	Oh, I see. It was an abbreviation.
3839000	3841000	Well, let's move on. Dark Sakura.
3841000	3843000	As soon as I can get it.
3843000	3845000	I'm on my iPad again.
3845000	3848000	Okay, well, this is a game I brought up during what I was playing.
3848000	3852000	And I just played a little bit of it this week because, honestly, I wanted a nap.
3852000	3856000	It's called Chompston, and it's a mix of Pac-Man and Bomberman.
3856000	3858000	Wait, so you're saying this game put you to sleep?
3858000	3862000	No, I was sleepy already.
3862000	3867000	The game is actually the sound effects work in time with the music.
3867000	3872000	Kind of like how great now I can't think of the puzzle game.
3873000	3874000	Luminous.
3874000	3875000	Exactly.
3875000	3876000	Kind of like how Luminous did.
3876000	3881000	So as you get the dots and throw bombs, it works in time with the music.
3881000	3884000	The music of the game is actually pretty neat.
3884000	3887000	But you get different kinds of enemies.
3887000	3891000	Like you have these purple ghosts that can walk through bombs
3891000	3895000	and red enemies that shoot fireballs at you and green ones that are really fast.
3895000	3900000	But as you go trying to collect your little rainbow dots, you can drop bombs
3900000	3902000	and explode exactly like they do in Bomberman.
3902000	3904000	And you get different power-ups for them as well.
3904000	3908000	It's really neat, but you download the game at,
3908000	3910000	and I'm going to have to say out the site,
3910000	3915000	contralogic.com slash games slash Chompston.
3915000	3917000	C-H-O-M-P-S-T-O-N.
3917000	3919000	It's definitely worth your time.
3919000	3924000	It's a fun game, and it gets tricky, so support them.
3925000	3926000	All right.
3926000	3929000	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates
3929000	3932000	if for whatever reason you've already worn out Chompston
3932000	3935000	and you want to check out something else this week.
3935000	3937000	What's coming out to a store near you?
3937000	3938000	It's not a whole lot this week.
3938000	3944000	It's pretty much the Hitman HD trilogy on PS3 and Xbox 360.
3944000	3948000	Also, if you were looking for a new PlayStation 3 console,
3948000	3950000	they have the new 500-gigabyte one,
3950000	3952000	the one that came with the instant game collection,
3952000	3955000	basically the PlayStation Plus for a year.
3955000	3959000	Well, they have that now in white in case you didn't want a black console,
3959000	3965000	and that's pretty much it.
3965000	3970000	Also, it was supposed to be this week a heavy fire shattered spear,
3970000	3972000	but that probably got delayed
3972000	3977000	because massive games never fucking come out on time.
3980000	3984000	Let's travel to Japan and check out what's coming out in Japan.
3984000	3987000	If anything, it's been kind of slow lately.
3987000	3990000	Well, there's one thing on the radar on the Xbox 360.
3990000	3994000	Love, Tori, bitter version in limited and regular edition.
3994000	3997000	That's your lone Xbox 360 release, but we already talked about Xbox.
3997000	3999000	I completely misheard you say that.
3999000	4001000	I thought you said toire, which means toilet.
4001000	4003000	Oh, no, no.
4003000	4008000	On PlayStation 3, Excel World, Kasoku no Choten,
4008000	4012000	also in regular and limited editions from Bandai Namco comes out this week.
4012000	4017000	FIFA Street gets a price reduction, and in Japan this week, PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.
4017000	4019000	I didn't realize they didn't get the game when we did,
4019000	4022000	but they are now getting their version this week on the PlayStation 3.
4022000	4025000	January 31st is when you can expect to see that.
4025000	4028000	On the Vita this week, also PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale,
4028000	4035000	and Sengoku Hime 3, Tenka o Kirisaku Hikari Tokage comes out in regular and limited edition
4035000	4038000	because, you know, they love their limited editions over there.
4038000	4041000	And unlike over here, their limited editions actually get filled most of the time.
4041000	4043000	Oh, I'll get into that later.
4043000	4044000	And usually have better stuff.
4044000	4047000	On the Wii U, yes, there is a Wii U release this week.
4047000	4054000	It's Shen Hokuro Musou comes out this week, and we're trying to see what this is.
4054000	4056000	Is this Fist of the North Star, for fuck's sake?
4056000	4059000	Hold on, pull up the thing. Yeah.
4059000	4061000	Yeah, it's Fist of the North Star, Ken's Rage 2.
4061000	4063000	Oh, good lord.
4065000	4067000	You can always count on another Fist of the North Star game.
4067000	4071000	How long has Fist of the North Star been out, like, since 1979?
4071000	4073000	No, I'm serious. I know, I know.
4073000	4075000	I think it's been out that, like, Hokuto no Ken's been out that long.
4075000	4079000	Well, it's coming out on Xbox 360 in two weeks.
4079000	4082000	Do you remember Punch Mania, the Hokuto no Ken version of Punch Mania?
4082000	4083000	I do. I do.
4083000	4084000	That was great.
4084000	4085000	I guess it was fun.
4085000	4090000	But it's just, it's funny to me that, like, you know, that's all the Wii U's got on it,
4090000	4094000	is a franchise from 1979 coming out this week.
4094000	4097000	Alright, but look, those games are still popular in all seriousness.
4097000	4098000	I want one of those at my house.
4098000	4099000	They sell for a reason.
4099000	4100000	Mildly popular.
4100000	4102000	Alright, let's go to UK.
4102000	4106000	On the 29th, we have Let's Fish Hooked On for the Vita.
4106000	4114000	We have on the 30th, Skulls of the Shogun, which is coming out for Xbox 360, PC, and the Windows Phone.
4114000	4115000	I just thought that was interesting.
4115000	4119000	On the 31st, Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed for PC.
4119000	4121000	Yay.
4121000	4128000	And then on February 1st, we have Hitman trilogy, Hitman HD trilogy, sorry,
4128000	4130000	and Ni No Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch.
4130000	4132000	That's it.
4134000	4138000	Alright, just a few more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
4138000	4140000	But first, Loki.
4140000	4149000	So, um, yeah, apparently the whole pay-to-win thing with EA is still continuing.
4149000	4156000	And now, Dead Space fans, you know, fans of a very hardcore franchise are so happy to find out that,
4156000	4157000	hey, guess what?
4157000	4159000	Microtransactions are here. Yay.
4159000	4161000	Free-to-play microtransactions.
4161000	4167000	And apparently they say the reason this is happening is because mobile gamers, mobile gamers, yes,
4167000	4173000	there are a lot of players out there, especially players coming from mobile games who are accustomed to microtransactions.
4173000	4177000	They're like, I need this now, and I want this now.
4177000	4183000	And they'll need instant gratification, so we included an option in order to attract those players.
4183000	4192000	So if they're like, oh, I need 5,000 Tugston, because I'm short on this upgrade, they can have it.
4192000	4196000	We need to make sure that we're expanding our audience as well.
4196000	4203000	Yes, so that's the way you expand your audience, is you have microtransactions in your fucking game, because mobile.
4203000	4205000	It doesn't expand your audience, because think about it.
4205000	4208000	People aren't going to buy this game because they have microtransactions in it.
4208000	4216000	All you're doing is saying, hey, people that are used to paying microtransactions for stuff may buy this microtransaction stuff in our game.
4216000	4221000	That is some dumbass logic this guy is using. I'm sorry.
4221000	4227000	The games industry is in trouble if that's the way that people making decisions are really thinking.
4227000	4232000	Just say, we're putting it in the game because people are dumb enough to buy it.
4232000	4234000	That's the reality.
4234000	4240000	We want to make free money, and we think because of mobile games, people are dumb enough to buy it.
4240000	4246000	Mobile games coming over to console, what the fuck backwards logic is that?
4246000	4249000	Everybody is saying it's supposedly going the other way.
4249000	4252000	Everybody's going to mobile.
4252000	4257000	They're not suddenly going to come over to console because you're designing the game so that they can spend more money.
4258000	4263000	I guarantee that there is nobody on the face of the planet that says, hey, you know what?
4263000	4266000	I like this game because there's microtransactions in it.
4266000	4269000	You know what else mobile games have going for them?
4269000	4272000	They're 99 cents.
4272000	4274000	That's a huge difference.
4274000	4278000	Why don't you middle managers understand this?
4278000	4281000	Volume. That's where you make your money. Volume.
4281000	4283000	And people are dumb enough to buy it.
4283000	4287000	Even if one person buys it, it's three bucks they didn't have before.
4287000	4290000	And you see EA doing this in a lot of their games.
4290000	4292000	They were the first to do it.
4292000	4295000	They used to put out, they had cheats in their games, and then guess what?
4295000	4297000	They stopped having cheats in their games.
4297000	4299000	The Godfather game had cheats in it.
4299000	4301000	Oh, but guess what?
4301000	4305000	When you buy it on the Xbox 360, you're actually going to have to buy those cheats in game.
4305000	4308000	Bobby on his show tonight, when we were on the phone call at the end,
4308000	4310000	was talking about SimCity and how he was playing the beta,
4310000	4313000	and was saying how he didn't have enough simoleons or whatever
4313000	4315000	to do some of the things he wanted to do.
4315000	4318000	I said, oh, I bet you could probably log into the EA store when the game comes out
4318000	4321000	and get 100,000 simoleons for $2.99.
4321000	4325000	And you're right. That's the type of thing that you used to type a cheat code in to get and unlock.
4325000	4327000	Of course, because here's the thing.
4327000	4329000	Why wouldn't they do this?
4329000	4331000	If you think about it, if you're making a game,
4331000	4337000	why wouldn't you miss out on the opportunity to make a little bit more money?
4337000	4341000	Which also is the real reason that game is all online DRM.
4341000	4343000	Don't fucking kid yourself.
4343000	4346000	All this stuff about, you know, the interaction with other people.
4346000	4348000	Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
4348000	4350000	It's to sell you this shit.
4350000	4354000	So that way, the cheat codes can't happen offline.
4354000	4357000	But wait, hackers will get it.
4357000	4361000	And sadly, that's the only way these guys are going to learn their lesson.
4361000	4365000	And then they'll, oh, but the hackers are so mean to us.
4366000	4369000	We lost all this money on the game and it was the hackers' fault.
4369000	4375000	Please, please, yeah, I'm sure that so many people out there pirated The Sims 3
4375000	4379000	because that's why they released so many fucking expansions to this game.
4379000	4385000	I mean, if it wasn't doing well, they wouldn't release 90,000 expansions for The Sims 3.
4385000	4389000	Well, you saw how many came out for Sims 2 back in the day.
4389000	4391000	I never paid for one.
4391000	4394000	But I'm telling you, though, that people buy this
4394000	4400000	and they're not just like, you know, for 70s, 80s, and 90s stuff that just came out.
4400000	4404000	It's like 20 bucks and you get crap for your house.
4404000	4407000	Twenty dollars for not even really a huge game expansion.
4407000	4414000	Forty dollars for a really big expansion like going to a university life that's coming out in March.
4414000	4419000	I mean, they literally have one or two expansions a month coming out for this stuff.
4419000	4421000	It's just, it's ridiculous.
4421000	4422000	And you know why they're doing it?
4422000	4424000	It's because people are buying them.
4424000	4426000	I mean, seriously, you're a company looking to make money.
4426000	4428000	You're looking to stay alive.
4428000	4429000	What are you going to do?
4429000	4433000	If people are buying DLC stuff, you're going to put it in your game.
4433000	4437000	You're going to have these microtransactions in there because people buy them.
4437000	4439000	People may bitch about them online, but you know what?
4439000	4441000	At the end of the day, people are buying them.
4441000	4443000	If they weren't buying them, they wouldn't put it in the game.
4443000	4455000	Alright, well, this may be the way some other game companies go if they don't learn to evolve to what people really want.
4455000	4459000	You know, because this company apparently couldn't do it and it's very unfortunate.
4459000	4465000	Atari Inc. filed for Chapter 11, Restructuring Bankruptcy, this week.
4465000	4473000	And it is trying to basically separate itself from Atari S.A., which is the French parent company, and be its own independent business.
4473000	4477000	But of course, you know, that's not how they really reported on CNN.
4477000	4481000	Everybody else says, Atari went bankrupt this week. Remember Pong?
4481000	4482000	People are dumb.
4482000	4487000	Atari's bankrupt. I'm going to miss Pong.
4487000	4489000	Combat?
4490000	4496000	I mean, let's be real, guys. A lot of that Atari that we know went away with the game crash in 84.
4496000	4499000	What did Atari recently have going for it, you know?
4499000	4501000	Alone in the Dark.
4501000	4503000	Test Drive Unlimited.
4505000	4507000	Retro Arcade Releases.
4507000	4509000	Okay, let me rephrase.
4509000	4512000	What did Atari have going for it that THQ didn't?
4514000	4516000	Alone in the Dark.
4517000	4519000	You're missing my point.
4519000	4522000	This is kind of happening to a lot of these guys, you know?
4524000	4526000	It's not enough?
4527000	4529000	They had Dragon Ball Z for a while.
4529000	4534000	They also had what? Oh god, I will forever associate this with modern Atari.
4534000	4540000	It was the Driver 3 on PlayStation, that buggy as hell game.
4541000	4543000	Wasn't that them?
4543000	4545000	Was it them or Midway? I can't remember.
4545000	4547000	I think it was them. It was Atari.
4547000	4549000	So, anyhow.
4549000	4553000	But Driver 3 was fantastic. It is a pinnacle of buggy-ass games.
4553000	4559000	I wouldn't really think this means that Atari is like totally going away in all this.
4559000	4563000	Although, okay, if you want to really follow things...
4563000	4565000	Let's see, where was it?
4565000	4570000	It was Atari, then it was GT Interactive, and then GT Interactive became Infogrames.
4570000	4572000	And that's when the French side of it came in.
4572000	4576000	And then Infogrames bought Hasbro Interactive, which acquired Atari.
4576000	4581000	And then Infogrames changed their name to Atari, and they used the Atari name in the logo.
4582000	4587000	So, yeah. Atari, as it is now, wasn't even the same company as it was before anyway.
4587000	4593000	It's probably just going to evolve again, and maybe they'll find their next big thing. I don't know.
4593000	4601000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on VogueNetwork.com, use the passphrase STRAW.
4601000	4606000	Well, let's go back to a more classic time when Atari was like, you know...
4606000	4611000	That was like Nintendo, or Sony, or when it was Atari.
4611000	4617000	Actually, this game may not be that old. Or maybe it is. Actually, I think you did pick a game that old this week. Close. Really close.
4617000	4619000	Pretty decently old.
4619000	4624000	Alright. Well, there was no Infogrames or GT involved with Atari when this game came out.
4624000	4626000	It's a classic game of the week.
4626000	4632000	Dark Soccer is going to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you kids should be playing this game.
4632000	4639000	Well, it's not as old as Hokuto no Ken, which, thanks for, I forget who said it, came out in 83.
4640000	4648000	Rygar is the game of the week. It came out by Tecmo in 1986, and it was an arcade game called Arcus no Senshi.
4648000	4658000	Which means, I mean, you pretty much play as the legendary warrior, and you're getting attacked on all sides.
4658000	4665000	And you use this disc armor weapon that's basically a shield with a long chain attached to it.
4666000	4681000	And, basically, I always think that it's kind of like their, what's the word I'm trying to think of, their derivative of Rastan.
4681000	4684000	It's the same type of platforming game.
4685000	4697000	But it came out, basically, you play as a guy named Rygar, who is a dead warrior who rose from his grave.
4697000	4698000	Aha!
4698000	4706000	You use the disc armor and other weapons to try to stop this guy named Rygar, who took over the land of Arghor.
4706000	4719000	So, you just go through and you basically shoot people, and you shoot animals, and you shoot spiders, and you shoot dragons, and you shoot midgets.
4719000	4725000	Now, I want to say real quick, and you'll probably get into this in a minute, but a lot of people in chat are like, oh, I remember this game on the NES.
4725000	4729000	But you're actually talking about the arcade version of Rygar, which was very, very different.
4729000	4730000	Yes, I am.
4730000	4734000	But I don't know if you'll get into the NES one at all, and why it was different, but yeah.
4734000	4735000	Hold your horses!
4735000	4736000	Keep your pants on!
4736000	4739000	I wanted our chatters to pay attention. Don't run away yet.
4739000	4740000	Meh.
4740000	4751000	Well, at any rate, as I was getting to, the game was imported to the Sharp X68000, the Commodore 64, the Sega Master System, but that was only in Japan.
4751000	4754000	It was called Argus no Jujiken.
4754000	4761000	It came out for the ZX Spectrum, 48K, the Amstrad 6128, and the Atari Lynx.
4761000	4769000	And then, on the Xbox, it was included in a compilation that was the type of classic arcade, and now there is a Wii Virtual Console version as well.
4769000	4771000	That's the arcade version.
4771000	4776000	Now, the Atari Lynx is probably the closest to the arcade version.
4776000	4778000	That's weird.
4778000	4781000	Let me finish.
4781000	4784000	However, it did have some different rounds.
4784000	4788000	There were only 23 rounds, but it was supposed to be pretty close to the arcade version.
4788000	4789000	I think I actually have it.
4789000	4794000	I just don't think of Atari Lynx as like the arcade accurate system ever, you know.
4794000	4795000	You'd be surprised.
4795000	4798000	The one on Xbox was, I actually have that collection you're talking about.
4798000	4800000	It's not bad, but it's also not 360 hours compatible.
4800000	4801000	Sucks.
4801000	4802000	Yeah.
4802000	4815000	At any rate, it also came out on the NES, and it was released as Argus no Senshi Hachamecha Daishengeki.
4816000	4819000	That's kind of a tongue twister.
4819000	4827000	Anyway, it was basically a platform action RPG, and it was quite a bit different.
4827000	4838000	Basically, you go through different settings to try to kill the evil king Lygar Blaw, who was on the planet of Argul, which was Argus in Japan.
4838000	4848000	And then you have to visit the five gods who give you different items, and you go through different realms, and they all have a boss, and all this fun stuff.
4848000	4851000	But yeah, it's a little bit different.
4851000	4857000	With the difference in the versions, the arcade version is more side-scrolling.
4857000	4863000	The NES one is an open-ended action-adventure game, sort of Metroidvania-like.
4863000	4870000	And at the start of the game, you have access to some of the worlds, and then you get the other worlds opened up as you go.
4870000	4878000	You also had permanent power-ups in the NES version, and different experience points you could use.
4878000	4886000	There was a new sequel that came out, Rygar the Legendary Adventure, that came out on PS2.
4886000	4893000	And it was a transition to 3D-style gameplay, and it was pretty much rated okay.
4893000	4897000	And there is a Wii port that came out in 2007.
4897000	4902000	So there you go. Rygar. The arcade version is the best one.
4902000	4907000	I like the NES one. The NES one had a great soundtrack. That's what I really liked about it.
4907000	4911000	But they're so different. I mean, they really should just be considered two separate games.
4911000	4913000	The arcade one is so different from the NES one.
4914000	4917000	Well, look at Strider in the arcade and on the Genesis.
4917000	4920000	And then the NES one. The NES one was actually based off the Strider manga.
4920000	4922000	Okay, yeah. That is a very good comparison.
4922000	4926000	The Rygar games are that different, like the Strider games are.
4926000	4928000	That's a very good comparison.
4928000	4932000	See, I love the NES Strider, but I know you think it's shit because you have that Genesis...
4932000	4936000	No, I didn't say I think it's shit. It's just a different game.
4936000	4940000	There's like this one jump in that game that's super stupid to make.
4940000	4941000	Oh, the triangle jump?
4941000	4944000	Yeah. But I liked it because it was based off the...
4944000	4947000	I like the story in it because it's based off the Strider manga.
4947000	4950000	You know, it's basically telling that whole story.
4950000	4956000	But I tend to think that the platformer is more fun, in my opinion.
4956000	4958000	And the same way with Rygar.
4958000	4961000	I like, you know, the hack and slash.
4961000	4964000	I kind of like them both, myself.
4964000	4966000	I kind of like them both. They're two different games.
4966000	4969000	You know, it's like me saying that I like playing Donkey Kong and Tetris.
4969000	4972000	No, you must pick one. This is gaming culture. There's no room for ties.
4972000	4974000	Bite my ass.
4975000	4976000	If you please.
4976000	4979000	One must be better, DarkSakura. How dare you?
4979000	4985000	Don't you understand? This is the foundation that all internet video game media is based on.
4985000	4986000	You can't have a tie.
4986000	4989000	Yeah, but I have a personality disorder.
4991000	4992000	Alright.
4992000	4994000	It's called honoree.
4994000	4997000	Alright, we're going to take a break. On that note, we're going to take a break.
4997000	5001000	And when we come back with Orange Lounge Radio, we've got more, yet again, more on Disney Infinity tonight.
5001000	5004000	Geez, Loki. It just doesn't stop with the Disney Infinity news.
5004000	5008000	And Nintendo had an avalanche of news this week. We're going to talk all about that and get into that.
5008000	5017000	When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, your phone calls, your emails, and much more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5017000	5033000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live on this January the 27th, 2013, episode number 491 in progress.
5033000	5040000	And we're going to start off this part of the show with some rapid fire news. If you're ready, Loki, take it away.
5040000	5041000	Sure.
5041000	5050000	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about Disney Infinity. Of course, can't go another show without talking more Disney Infinity.
5050000	5055000	They're going to actually put out lots of content, which is kind of a duh.
5055000	5064000	And I've actually heard some people saying, you know, hey, we might not actually see any more standalone games from Disney Interactive now that they have this Disney Infinity thing.
5064000	5067000	And that kind of seems somewhat true.
5067000	5071000	Didn't they close a lot of that?
5071000	5073000	Yeah, they did.
5073000	5081000	Because the whole like, there was not jokes, but commentary going around about how there won't be another split second or what that racing game and you know.
5081000	5083000	Yeah, because Black Rocks, I think.
5083000	5084000	Yeah, yeah.
5084000	5088000	So that's too bad.
5088000	5093000	But yeah, they've got quite a bit coming out. In fact, so much I'm about to tell you about.
5093000	5096000	And this isn't exactly all out there yet.
5096000	5101000	So let's see here. Let's talk, let's see, Disney Infinity.
5101000	5113000	And we've got, I know at launch, you've got the starter packs, which have, you know, of course, the three main characters of each of the adventure packs that are in there.
5113000	5123000	So you've got Mr. Incredible and Captain Jack Sparrow and Sully from Monsters Inc and Monsters U.
5123000	5139000	And then, of course, to go with that, they've got a bunch of other side characters, including, you know, in the Incredibles universe, Dash, Mrs. Incredible, Violet and Syndrome, Monsters U.
5139000	5146000	They've got Mike and Randall, Pirates of the Caribbean, Captain Barboza and Davy Jones.
5146000	5155000	They're also going to be doing some additional playsets. Zorro and Kars are going to be the first two playsets that are launched alongside this as well.
5155000	5162000	And with Zorro, you're going to get Zorro and Tonto and then Kars, Lightning McQueen and I can't remember who else.
5162000	5165000	It might be Flo, yeah.
5165000	5170000	And then, of course, they're going to have some triple packs in case you want to get a few characters at a time.
5170000	5173000	Sidekicks and Villains are going to be the two themes of those.
5174000	5178000	And then I know one of the questions was, hey, when are we going to see Mickey Mouse?
5178000	5183000	And you're not going to wait that long. September is when you're going to see Mickey Mouse as a standalone character.
5183000	5188000	I'm not sure. The garb that they had the picture of was Sorcerer's Apprentice.
5188000	5194000	So I'm not sure if it's going to be Sorcerer's Apprentice, Mickey, or if it may even be its own adventure set by then.
5194000	5197000	We'll see. I think Phineas and Ferb is somewhere during the summer.
5197000	5202000	And then fall, you're going to get Frozen, the play set for that, and Wreck-It Ralph.
5202000	5204000	Sadly, we have to wait so long for Wreck-It Ralph.
5204000	5206000	Phineas and Ferb needs to be now.
5206000	5211000	But those are all going to be available soon.
5211000	5217000	That is weird that Wreck-It Ralph isn't towards the start because I would have thought that the Blu-ray would be out around April.
5217000	5221000	But they may, they're just trying to probably space it out because I mean, you've got two play sets coming out.
5221000	5226000	They've got the stuff that ties in with Monsters University and Zorro and then Kars.
5226000	5230000	I mean, it might be a little much. I was hoping during the summer.
5230000	5234000	That could change if, you know, it's rolling.
5234000	5240000	And also along this time, too, you're going to be able to get the token packs, which tokens unlock stuff in the game.
5240000	5248000	So like, you know, the bus from the Muppets or Abu as an elephant or something like that.
5248000	5252000	Tigerclaw asks, how long until we see Star Wars characters in Disney Infinity?
5252000	5254000	I don't know.
5254000	5256000	Probably not that long.
5256000	5260000	Wait for Disney Infinity Giants.
5260000	5266000	I don't think they're going to come out with anything like, you know, like Skylanders Giants because they don't really need to.
5266000	5270000	Fool.
5270000	5274000	They don't need to do it for Skylanders either, if you really think about it.
5274000	5277000	Well, they do because it has to expand the game.
5277000	5280000	They didn't need a little big planet, too, Loki.
5280000	5284000	They'll find a way. Come on. They'll find a way.
5284000	5286000	All right.
5286000	5288000	The content's on the disk anyway.
5288000	5292000	They're going to have to have a new edition in another year for the rest of the content.
5292000	5294000	True.
5294000	5300000	And we're going to find out about all the characters anyways for Disney Infinity because the content for this entire year is actually on the disk.
5300000	5305000	That is interesting, too, because you know people are going to hack the shit out of this game the minute it's out.
5305000	5312000	So anything that they're trying to keep under wraps with Frozen, be ready for that to hit the internet the minute this game leaks.
5312000	5316000	It's going to be a little harder, though, because you need RFID stuff to do that.
5316000	5322000	But I don't know what they've done with Skylanders, you know, as far as rewriting RFID tags.
5322000	5326000	I'm sure that's possible. I'm not really sure how they would do it.
5326000	5330000	It would be a little bit more complicated than just unlocking everything.
5330000	5332000	Hackers going to hack.
5332000	5335000	I'm not sure that they are, but I'm just saying it's a little bit more complicated.
5335000	5337000	Not everybody's going to be doing it.
5337000	5341000	The Ouya is getting a controller redesign.
5341000	5343000	I actually think it looks kind of cool.
5343000	5345000	There's some people are saying the D-pad sucks.
5345000	5353000	Apparently the grips on the analog sticks were not rubberized enough, so they kind of changed it and added a little rubberized top to it.
5353000	5361000	They also, I guess we're adjusting the touchpad sensitivity and moving the triggers closer to the body.
5361000	5367000	And the D-pad is now, instead of the circular D-pad, it's a cross-shaped D-pad.
5367000	5370000	And people are seeing the pictures and they're like, oh, it's terrible.
5370000	5372000	Looks like the Xbox 360 controller.
5372000	5382000	However, you're not looking at it close enough, because actually the circle part on there, the corners, the little pie-shaped stuff, are actually attached to the controller.
5382000	5386000	The D-pad itself is the only thing that rocks in there.
5386000	5395000	So it actually is a true D-pad and not like the Xbox 360 controller, which is kind of a D-pad on top of a circle and the whole thing rocks.
5395000	5397000	So it'll be interesting to see.
5397000	5401000	I'm still looking forward to my system in a couple months, so that'll be cool.
5401000	5402000	Bring it in.
5403000	5414000	And then, of course, the, I don't know if it's a sign of desperation, but hey, get your friends to buy a Vita, because we need people to buy a Vita.
5414000	5422000	And if you do, you get $20 in PlayStation Network credit and 1,000 Sony Rewards points.
5422000	5428000	I don't really know what 1,000 Rewards points buys you, but cool, I guess.
5428000	5431000	I mean, some sort of referral program.
5431000	5437000	Kind of along the lines of that, actually, I'm thinking of selling my Vita, because I'm just not playing anything on it.
5437000	5438000	You know what? You may have a buyer.
5438000	5440000	So, I don't know. We'll see.
5440000	5442000	Still waiting for a Grand Theft Auto game.
5442000	5445000	Still waiting. It's not coming.
5445000	5452000	Speaking of Grand Theft Auto, second half of May, from what I hear, is supposed to be coming out.
5452000	5453000	Do you collect your-
5453000	5456000	That makes sense. Right in time for school to be out, so all the kids can go home and play.
5456000	5459000	Yeah, because we were bothering them. We were on a conference call at Take-Two, and they're like,
5459000	5461000	Hey, so when's it coming out?
5461000	5462000	And they're all, second half of May.
5462000	5466000	Lisa's word, it's targeted right now.
5466000	5469000	Of course, that all depends on, they're looking at a new build of it next week,
5469000	5472000	and assuming that everything's up to something, it'll be the second half.
5472000	5475000	At the end of February, they're going to be announcing collector's editions.
5475000	5481000	They're going to have one for $79.99, one for $134.99 to $149.99.
5481000	5484000	They don't know what's in there yet, but you didn't hear that here.
5484000	5487000	But then again, it doesn't take a rockish scientist to guess,
5487000	5489000	Oh, they'll probably be collector's editions, you know?
5489000	5490000	Yeah, of course.
5490000	5491000	Long-awaited games always have collector's editions.
5491000	5492000	Of course, and-
5492000	5493000	The time frame makes sense.
5493000	5494000	And-
5494000	5496000	None of this is unreasonable news.
5496000	5500000	I'm still begging, still begging my boss to take me,
5500000	5504000	but Destination PlayStation, I'm going to have a playable build of it now.
5504000	5506000	I want to play that game!
5506000	5507000	Of course you do.
5507000	5509000	I'm like, listen you asshole, you're going to bring me to-
5509000	5511000	You're bringing me down there.
5511000	5512000	That'll win you fans.
5512000	5515000	Alright, going to a game that Loki's not playing,
5515000	5518000	but if he had a Wii U, he might be playing this.
5518000	5519000	Zombie U.
5519000	5524000	So news this week, the Zombie U originally had intended to have a co-op mode,
5524000	5526000	but it was shelved pretty early into development,
5526000	5528000	which, you know, kind of makes sense.
5528000	5535000	The producer of the game said that we thought we could not deliver it on time.
5535000	5538000	How to bring a cooperative experience and still keep fear and tension
5538000	5540000	is a question we would love to address, though.
5540000	5544000	So, probably in Zombie U, too, which I think is inevitable at this point,
5544000	5545000	but we'll see.
5545000	5547000	But yeah, that was-
5547000	5549000	I always wanted to see that banned as a zombie.
5551000	5552000	Shut up.
5554000	5559000	300,000 survivors apparently have died so far in Zombie U,
5559000	5562000	according to the servers at Ubisoft.
5564000	5565000	There you go.
5565000	5567000	Well, they're no longer survivors now, aren't they?
5568000	5574000	Alright, moving on to some interesting news about the Wii U.
5574000	5581000	Apparently, your Wii Shop purchases will not earn you Club Nintendo coins on Wii U.
5581000	5585000	In other words, these two stores are very separate.
5585000	5588000	If you transfer your Wii content to the Wii U,
5588000	5592000	and you buy WiiWare virtual console games on the Wii U's Wii mode,
5592000	5595000	you don't get Wii U coins out of that.
5595000	5600000	Because, face it, Nintendo's Wii and Wii U modes don't know how to talk to each other.
5600000	5602000	Loki, you and I were chatting before the show about this,
5602000	5604000	and I don't remember which one of us said it,
5604000	5608000	but we were joking about this whole $1.50 upgrade
5608000	5610000	is probably going to be something, you know,
5610000	5614000	like if you want to get an upgrade to your game and play it on the Wii U.
5614000	5618000	Yeah, in case you haven't heard about it, the Wii U is going to have virtual console, finally.
5618000	5620000	You're going to be able to play on your gamepad,
5620000	5623000	and you're also going to reassign your controls and stuff like that,
5623000	5625000	and save states and all that fun stuff.
5625000	5629000	But, it's going to cost you, you're going to have to buy your games again.
5629000	5632000	However, if you have the original game and you ported it over to your Wii U,
5632000	5637000	you can buy it for $1.50 for Super Nintendo and $1 for Nintendo games.
5637000	5640000	And we were joking about that they'll probably be in the Wii mode,
5640000	5644000	they'll be the Wii U virtual console upgrade channel.
5644000	5646000	They'll actually transfer, I was saying,
5646000	5650000	you'll probably have to buy the upgrade in the Wii virtual console,
5650000	5654000	because Nintendo doesn't know how to get the two things to talk to each other.
5654000	5656000	They don't know online.
5656000	5659000	It's not so much that the Wii can't talk to the Wii U part of the device,
5659000	5661000	but it's the online part.
5661000	5665000	Like, Nintendo can't figure out how to hook up your Wii and Wii U accounts.
5665000	5667000	They can't do it.
5667000	5670000	This proves they can't do it.
5670000	5672000	Yeah.
5672000	5675000	And I made the joke that, you know, when you're doing the upgrade,
5675000	5677000	you know how they have the little loading screen stuff,
5677000	5680000	it's gonna be a little Pikmin running into your wallet and snatching a dollar out.
5680000	5682000	So, kind of funny.
5682000	5684000	And then I said, stop being funny when we're not on air.
5684000	5685000	I know.
5685000	5686000	There you go.
5686000	5687000	I don't make it a point to do that.
5687000	5691000	All right, well, this is a game that's available on virtual console on the 3DS, I know.
5691000	5696000	Xevious, there's a 30th anniversary tribute album,
5696000	5702000	paying homage to the original soundtrack of the shooter,
5702000	5706000	and lots of different game composers that are contributing to this soundtrack.
5706000	5711000	It is gonna be out January 29th on iTunes through Namco Sounds.
5711000	5712000	Very cool.
5712000	5715000	There's some previews up on YouTube if you want to check that out.
5715000	5718000	I didn't realize that game was turning 30 years old.
5718000	5720000	How does it feel to be old?
5720000	5722000	Old.
5722000	5724000	Dark Sakura, what do you got for us?
5724000	5727000	I got some stuff.
5727000	5730000	First of all, this is sad news.
5730000	5735000	The composer for Heavy Rain, Norman Corbell, died at 56 years old.
5735000	5738000	Passed away on,
5738000	5744000	he was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer on August 15th, 2012.
5744000	5750000	And, let's see, this was posted on the 27th, and he died at 2.56 PM that day.
5750000	5753000	So that's very sadness.
5753000	5761000	And then, in happier news, there is a Greenlight game that is actually out now,
5761000	5764000	that I really came close to buying today, it looks super fun.
5764000	5767000	Except I have a lot of stuff to pay for and just quit my job.
5767000	5769000	But it's called No Time to Explain.
5769000	5772000	The trailer for this is absolutely hilarious.
5772000	5774000	I mean, it is super funny.
5774000	5782000	But this one was actually, the interesting thing about this is that the Minecraft guy, Marcus Person,
5782000	5785000	actually donated $2,000 to this project.
5785000	5789000	So it's got the approval of our Minecraft dude.
5789000	5792000	And it's on Steam, so go get it.
5792000	5801000	And then, in other news, someone didn't link me the story.
5801000	5802000	There we go.
5802000	5804000	I was like, I'm looking right at it.
5804000	5806000	I found it, shush.
5806000	5811000	Resident Evil 6 PC is going to come with some bonus stuff.
5811000	5819000	It comes with the Mercenaries No Mercy mode, which is a time attack with waves of enemies.
5819000	5822000	And we'll see how well people do on that one.
5822000	5830000	And also, I believe that after that, you'll be able to buy the MIA Siege mode DLC.
5830000	5832000	So there you go.
5832000	5840000	It's going to be, well, at least in Europe, it's going to be $19.99 or $29.99 euro.
5840000	5843000	So who knows what will be here.
5843000	5844000	Expensive.
5844000	5845000	All right.
5845000	5850000	Let's go to a part of the show we call the FUGL Question of the Week.
5850000	5851000	Well, that's a funny word.
5851000	5856000	Well, what we did, we smashed the word Facebook and Google together, and we got FUGL.
5856000	5861000	I believe the term is a portmanteau.
5861000	5862000	Bless you.
5862000	5863000	All right.
5863000	5868000	FUGL Question of the Week, going to the question we asked this week,
5868000	5872000	which is in a follow-up to something we talked about earlier in the show
5872000	5879000	with the whole Dead Space 3 and the fact that you will be able to buy some of these guns with real money.
5879000	5884000	And because of mobile, phone gamers are to blame for this.
5884000	5887000	So we asked our Facebook and Google community members this week,
5887000	5894000	have you ever bought a microtransaction in a console game of something you could have used in-game currency to unlock?
5894000	5895000	Why or why not?
5895000	5899000	Do you think this sort of mobile, and I put that in quotes,
5899000	5903000	design in games is a good thing or a bad thing?
5903000	5905000	We'll start with Google tonight.
5905000	5911000	Critical Myth says, I've never knowingly done so, but sometimes it's hard to tell with costumes and weapons and so on.
5911000	5914000	But if it's single player, I don't think it matters one way or the other.
5914000	5920000	I do think it's BS when multiplayer items go for sale in that manner for obvious reasons.
5920000	5926000	Actually, I wouldn't have minded hearing a little elaboration on that because Mass Effect does that whole thing.
5926000	5928000	It's not the most bullshit thing I've ever seen.
5928000	5930000	I don't really care for it.
5930000	5935000	And I think it's a horrible value too compared to how long it takes to get the in-game currency to do it.
5935000	5941000	But because it's all co-op, it doesn't necessarily throw the game out of whack.
5941000	5947000	But I think the obvious reasons you state there are probably more in the head-to-head multiplayer games.
5947000	5949000	That's my guess anyway.
5949000	5952000	Anyhow, more answers.
5952000	5959000	Redertainment on Google Plus says, yes, I've paid real monies for games and items I could earn in-game.
5959000	5962000	I didn't do this because I'm used to doing so by prior experience.
5962000	5965000	I did this because of the general philosophy I have towards things.
5965000	5970000	I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want to expediently.
5970000	5975000	Flaco Jones says, I've never paid for something that I could earn normally in a console game.
5975000	5981000	I meet with guides and FAQs freely available on the internet to show you where every last item is hidden and how to get it.
5981000	5984000	It seems like it would be a waste of money.
5984000	5987000	Going to Facebook and some of the answers there, James S.
5987000	5992000	If they incorporate a way for you to obtain the items by collecting in-game currency, then whatever.
5992000	5997000	This is just one of the many evolutions of the gaming industry in today's troublesome economy.
5997000	6001000	We all must take the necessary steps in order to keep our heads above water.
6001000	6005000	Whether or not that means pissing some people off in the process.
6005000	6008000	It's a business, deal with it.
6008000	6016000	Hmm, I don't know. I think folks will deal with it when they stop buying the games.
6016000	6023000	But regardless, again, the mobile phone logic is you only paid 99 cents for the game in the first place, not 60.
6023000	6026000	That's the big discrepancy here, anyway.
6026000	6031000	Jovadea says, I could really care less about microtransactions for items I can still pick up with in-game money.
6031000	6035000	There are some in-game unlockables that are just a huge pain in the ass.
6035000	6039000	So it might be worth it for something like that if I'm too putsy to unlock it myself.
6039000	6043000	But I can just ignore it and enjoy the game normally if I don't want to put out the cash.
6043000	6047000	It only becomes annoying when the microtransaction is for something I can't get myself in-game,
6047000	6052000	or so difficult to unlock it could take years to save up in-game due to just how you get the game money.
6052000	6056000	That's just the company pushing you to spend more money for more pretties.
6056000	6060000	Again, though, if the extra pretties are something that takes away from the core game, then it doesn't matter.
6060000	6062000	Don't want to spend the money on it, then don't.
6062000	6066000	Some people like to collect all the pretties, though. Let them waste their money on what they want.
6066000	6073000	AKVG Games replies and says, I have never bought anything that was microtransaction related.
6073000	6077000	The closest thing to it was DLC for either character skin or expansion of a story.
6077000	6081000	I don't believe I'll ever pay money for anything in a game that you could earn or unlock.
6081000	6084000	I understand why people pay to get something ahead of time.
6084000	6087000	But in my personal opinion, you lose a couple things from doing so.
6087000	6093000	There's more to that, but I can't read all of these answers, so please check out the full-length responses on Facebook.
6093000	6099000	Redthehaze replies and says, there was a console game I avoided because of the microtransactions,
6099000	6101000	and that was Gotham City Impostors.
6101000	6106000	The game was $15 and had the option to purchase upgrades, which could be unlocked in the game.
6106000	6110000	I would have no problem with it, but it took too much time to unlock the upgrades.
6110000	6116000	It resulted with unbalanced gameplay, giving the advantage to those who spent a lot of time and or those who paid money.
6116000	6125000	That being said, I will pick up Dead Space 3 and goes on to say that the Dead Space 3 upgrades are co-op multiplayer and single player and so on.
6125000	6128000	Uh, Gotham City Impostors, that game kind of flopped a rude though, didn't it?
6128000	6129000	I think so.
6129000	6131000	And did it go free to play at some point?
6131000	6133000	Uh, I don't remember if it did.
6133000	6134000	Did I not call that?
6134000	6137000	I thought it did. I could be wrong. I could be wrong.
6137000	6138000	I'm just saying, I called it.
6138000	6141000	$15 is still pretty cheap, but anyhow.
6141000	6146000	Burr replies and says, most microtransactions feel like paying for cheat codes.
6146000	6148000	Why the hell are we paying for cheat codes?
6148000	6156000	It feels like insult heaped upon injury considering that on today's consoles we can no longer cheat in our games because of achievements, trophies, etc.
6156000	6160000	I think that comment really hits the nail on the head to what I think.
6160000	6165000	And we were talking earlier in the show about the whole, like, SimCity and how that's all changed.
6165000	6168000	I think this is right up the alley of why that all went down that way.
6169000	6172000	Degenerate Johnny said, honestly, I think it all depends on the player.
6172000	6178000	I personally have no partook in microtransactions in games with the exception of wow.
6178000	6180000	Damn that sparkly horse.
6180000	6182000	However, I do see that there's a growing market for them.
6182000	6190000	As games are becoming progressively longer and more frequent, it makes life harder for the completionist to master the game in time for the next game to be released.
6190000	6193000	Even the most skillful players have a rough time keeping up.
6193000	6196000	These microtransactions help save time for these players.
6196000	6198000	And again, this one continues as well.
6198000	6200000	But here's my question.
6200000	6205000	How does the sparkly horse help you save time?
6205000	6209000	I guess technically you don't have to buy a flying mount if you have one.
6209000	6220000	Wait, wasn't it that it used to be that if you bought one of the mounts with faster speed naturally that you automatically unlocked Master Flying?
6220000	6224000	Not the Uber. No, you still have to pay for flying.
6224000	6230000	Not paying for flying, but I thought that it was right before they patched it out that if you had...
6230000	6235000	If you get the in-game achievement for the Violet Drake, you would automatically unlock the 310 flying.
6235000	6237000	Yeah, that's been patched out since.
6239000	6243000	Andy R said, I've bought plenty of DLC, mostly rock bands.
6243000	6251000	See, I appreciate the answers, but the sparkly horse and rock band songs aren't necessarily things you can unlock with in-game money.
6251000	6254000	And that's a key difference too. Especially with rock band.
6254000	6259000	And the reason why I wanted to draw that distinction, especially with rock band, is that it's so different.
6259000	6269000	Like when you're actually paying for a song that is new and you understand that licensing goes into getting that song in the game and so forth.
6269000	6271000	It's very different for me.
6271000	6276000	While Andy R agrees, I draw the line when it is something unlockable in the game.
6276000	6277000	Alright, there you go.
6277000	6284000	I think it's mostly because I'm stingy about that kind of thing. I have no problems buying add-ons to a game I'm enjoying throughout.
6284000	6286000	I think that's a good way to put it, add-ons.
6286000	6293000	And lastly, Annamalous Underdog says, no, the only DLC I ever bought was more songs for Rocksmith.
6293000	6298000	DLC that adds substantially new content is the only kind of DLC I'm ever willing to buy.
6298000	6302000	Rock band, Rocksmith, Guitar Hero, it's all...
6302000	6305000	Hell, DDR. They're all the same, honestly.
6305000	6311000	Except when the DDR songs were on the disc. That was a little more shady. Little bit shady.
6311000	6313000	Little bit.

6327000	6330000	Alright, let's get back into some more news.
6330000	6334000	And we already started to talk about one of these a minute ago, Loki, right?
6334000	6344000	Yes, yes. So, lots of Nintendo news. Basically, they had another Nintendo Direct...
6344000	6349000	I don't know what you want to call it. It's not really a press conference, but video that they made.
6349000	6358000	And they talked about a few game announcements and releases and then showed you some stuff, I guess.
6358000	6363000	So, I don't know. I'm a little hesitant on everything that I saw.
6363000	6367000	Just because we don't know when a lot of this stuff is coming out.
6367000	6369000	But let's just go over what they talked about.
6369000	6378000	So, first things first. One of the big announcements was that they're gonna do an HD remake of Legends of the Wind Waker.
6378000	6383000	And it's gonna have better graphics and gonna be on the Wii U and have all the Wii U stuff.
6383000	6385000	It's supposed to be coming out this fall.
6386000	6395000	So, neat. Although I'm not that excited about it. Even though Wind Waker is a pretty fun game and I really do like Wind Waker.
6395000	6401000	I actually thought that the new graphics don't look good. It's too much bloom.
6401000	6405000	This was one of those announcements where it wasn't really surprising.
6405000	6409000	And it's funny because I got into a debate with somebody on Facebook about this.
6409000	6413000	I didn't really feel a lot of this news that came out of Nintendo was that surprising.
6413000	6417000	And it's like, well, how could you have called Wind Waker? And I'm like, well, there's a difference.
6417000	6422000	It's not that I predicted it or I knew it was coming. That's not what I'm talking about.
6422000	6427000	When I heard the news that Wind Waker was coming out, I did more one of those, oh yeah, that makes sense.
6427000	6433000	Yeah, actually, why didn't we see this coming? Because they always do a Zelda remake for consoles these days, it seems.
6433000	6440000	We had the new Zelda on 3DS. We had a Mario remake launch the original DS.
6440000	6446000	We had Zelda on Game Boy Advance that was cross playable.
6446000	6452000	The Zelda that launched the Wii was essentially a GameCube Zelda game, but with the controls.
6452000	6458000	This whole reimagining of previous Zelda games isn't exactly a new territory for Nintendo.
6458000	6464000	No, and I always thought that they would be doing HD remakes of games. I thought it would be Wii games.
6464000	6469000	So they would do HD remakes of. And I guess, I mean, are GameCube games close enough?
6469000	6473000	Here's the thing, though. They also said they're working on another Zelda game.
6473000	6478000	But, you know, just like, hey, we're working on Smash Brothers.
6478000	6482000	Grass is green. Pope is Catholic. Bear shit in woods.
6482000	6488000	We don't know when it's coming out. And, you know, I would say at least next year, not later.
6488000	6494000	Super Smash Brothers for the Wii U and 3DS is supposed to be showcased at E3.
6494000	6498000	Doesn't say coming out this year, though. I'd like to point that out.
6499000	6508000	They showed a video for the Yoshi game. That alleged Yoshi game that we saw in the debug menus and stuff on.
6508000	6515000	The whole Wii U community thing. And it's done in the style of Kirby's Epic Yarn.
6517000	6522000	Cool. No mentioning when that's coming out, but they're working on it.
6523000	6532000	Also, a new, very briefly in a video, a new game from Monolith Soft that looks sort of like Xenoblade for the Wii U.
6532000	6534000	Once again.
6534000	6542000	That was, okay, of all the various announcements made, that one was more one where it's like, it was like, yay.
6542000	6549000	Because clearly, you know, Xenoblade had kind of a rough transition going from Japan to the U.S.
6549000	6551000	And, you know, all the stuff that went with that.
6551000	6558000	But it came out, and that kind of shows that, okay, maybe Nintendo's putting a little more stock in this than they did when it was originally on the Wii.
6558000	6563000	So that piece of news was like, got a smile out of me.
6564000	6571000	One that I was kind of, I don't know, it was a little weird, Shin Megami Tensei Crossfire Emblem.
6572000	6573000	Interesting.
6573000	6577000	Yeah, that was the one where I was like, now that's a surprise.
6577000	6580000	That's, that's, that's, okay, cool, cool.
6580000	6582000	I'm with you here.
6582000	6583000	That was cool.
6583000	6585000	I'm gonna tell you right now, that's not gonna sell very well.
6585000	6593000	And just because you got two very niche franchises, I mean, Fire Emblem, there are rabbit fans for it, but let's be honest.
6593000	6596000	Your soccer moms are not gonna be buying this game.
6596000	6600000	Well, but maybe the expectations and the budget aren't that high.
6600000	6606000	Because, I mean, by that logic, they would have stopped making Fire Emblem games a long time ago, but they haven't.
6606000	6613000	So, that audience, as small as it may be, or as niche as it may be, is enough to substantiate this happening.
6613000	6615000	I hope they're right.
6615000	6622000	No, the soccer moms won't buy this, but that's not who Nintendo needed to talk to with this little press conference thingy they did, either.
6622000	6624000	This wasn't a soccer mom conference.
6624000	6628000	If Reggie Fils-Aime wanted to talk to the soccer moms, he'd go on Ellen.
6629000	6636000	They announced that the Miiverse is coming to smartphones, so you're gonna be able to browse the Miiverse stuff on there.
6636000	6640000	Now, that was, it was surprising and not surprising at the same time.
6640000	6649000	Because, you know, you're like, oh, holy shit, a Nintendo app on the iPhone, but then you're like, oh yeah, the investors have been, like, breathing down their fucking necks to do something on the iPhone.
6649000	6654000	You know, the Pokemon company finally did their thing, you know, for what it's worth on the iPhone.
6655000	6660000	This is to appease investors. This is Nintendo's move to appease investors.
6660000	6665000	I just hope it's good, because they sure as hell don't know how to code anything for the internet.
6665000	6673000	Well, Miiverse is one of the more fascinating features of the Wii U. I guess we'll leave it at that.
6675000	6679000	Pleasant surprises. That's a good way to put it. It's a pleasant surprise on the Wii U.
6679000	6685000	This summer, um, we're gonna be getting a sequel to Wii Party, a party game that no one fucking bought.
6688000	6698000	Well now, wait a minute, Loki. I'm calling you out on this, because you just said, here's one that Soccer Moms won't give a shit about, yet now here's Wii Party. You know who did buy that game?
6698000	6700000	No one! No, Soccer Moms.
6700000	6705000	Nobody bought it. Trust me, I had to sell this game. Nobody fucking bought it.
6705000	6710000	It was just like, is it Mario Party? Nope. Don't care. Don't need it.
6710000	6713000	I don't know why they would make a sequel to a game that didn't sell, but...
6713000	6717000	Because it's Nintendo. They'll do whatever they want. I mean, it's minimal effort.
6717000	6724000	But, one of the big things that they were, you know, touting with this is that you'll be able to do two-player gameplay on the gamepad.
6724000	6735000	And you'll be able to basically just, kind of like how they showed some of the demos and stuff that you could do, like stuff, you know, where you can play, you know, air hockey or whatever on the gamepad.
6735000	6740000	Although, explain to me how that's gonna fucking work, since it doesn't have multi-touch?
6740000	6751000	Wii Party, VGCharts.com, 1.67 million in North America, 3.27 million in Europe. This is games being made for Europe.
6751000	6757000	North America sold less than Japan, too. But 1.67 is nothing to bat your eyelashes at, so...
6757000	6760000	Yeah, I wonder how many of those were after the game dropped down to nothing.
6760000	6764000	Would you like me to look at the week-by-week detail?
6764000	6766000	Yes, I would. I'd love to.
6766000	6767000	Let's take a peek.
6767000	6769000	I can tell you that no one bought that.
6769000	6773000	Well, again, Europe was the biggest selling region for that game, so...
6773000	6776000	Which is really odd. Did they not get like a Mario Party game over there or something?
6776000	6779000	I don't know. Maybe it's just, you know, different strokes for different folks, right?
6779000	6782000	Let's see, I'm trying to bring it up here week-by-week.
6785000	6787000	Keep going, I'll figure it out.
6787000	6793000	Alright. And then, of course, one of the announcements was the whole Virtual Console trial thing.
6794000	6801000	The highest amount of sales were the week of November 27th, but that's the Black Friday week in 2010.
6802000	6808000	It did sell, like, it sold almost a million the first year it was out, in 2010.
6808000	6814000	But it sold 300,000 more in 2011, which I imagine is when that price drop was.
6814000	6818000	It was before that. It was like a few months after it came out.
6818000	6824000	Okay, so, yeah, that's why there was so many offered up for Black Friday, clearing out inventory.
6824000	6834000	So, the Virtual Console trial program basically kind of gets you guys hooked on buying Virtual Console games for the Wii U.
6834000	6842000	You would be able to purchase, they're going to have 30 set games, and they're going to be available for 30 days, basically a month for each.
6842000	6848000	So first one, of course, for January was Balloon Fight, and then for February they're going to have F-Zero.
6848000	6858000	March is Punch Out featuring Mr. Dream, April Kirby's Adventure, May Super Metroid, June Yoshi, and July Donkey Kong.
6858000	6871000	And 30 cents each, and, you know, if you don't buy them during that time frame, then you're going to have to pay the $1 or $1.50 to upgrade them, or, you know, not.
6872000	6879000	I'm not a big fan of the upgrade fees, because I just don't get it, because I feel like the, you know, and they're talking about,
6879000	6884000	oh, well, they're new emulators, you can play them on the gamepad, I'm like, big fucking deal, you know, it's not-
6884000	6885000	Why is it a good-
6885000	6896000	Why can't I- where are the goddamn leaderboards, or even online play, or, you know, like, something else to really push this Virtual Console thing forward?
6896000	6903000	Why is it so hard for them to code an emulator for that stuff? I can tell you this much, there's people that had emul- when that homebrew channel came out,
6903000	6911000	there's people that had emulators running for all games, you know, all games of a certain- or, you know, all games that are compatible with an emulator.
6911000	6915000	Relatively easy, I don't understand why this is such a problem.
6915000	6922000	But I will say this, I did spend the 30 cents to get Balloon Fight, I didn't have it before, and I thought, you know, what the heck, let me just kind of take a-
6922000	6929000	30 cents, for god's sake, I'll take a look at it, and I will say the sound is actually really good, I don't- and it's weird because-
6929000	6930000	I noticed that too.
6930000	6941000	Yeah, the NES had that mono sound, so I don't know if they did something to maybe fake a stereo emulation, but like, having the TV sound and the gamepad sound actually sounds kind of nice.
6941000	6951000	And, thank fuck, finally, you don't have to put your TV into 4-3 mode, it will finally- like it knows to scrunch down the image of the picture.
6951000	6958000	To be appropriate, it's not all stretched like the Wii Virtual Console was. Thank god, finally.
6958000	6963000	But again, are those two things enough to really substantiate a buck fifty upgrade?
6964000	6971000	Remember, and that's not a buck fifty for the game, people, that's a buck fifty when you already dropped seven or eight on it.
6971000	6976000	That's my big sticking point. People are forgetting, we already paid a decent amount of money for these games.
6976000	6983000	And the reason that they're doing that, they claim, is because there's no- or, well, the reason we think is because there's no real way to link them.
6983000	6992000	Yet, at the same time, there's no real way to link it when they not know that you've already purchased it and wouldn't charge you just the dollar, dollar fifty.
6992000	6998000	So, they do know that you bought it. The least they could do is, hey, you know what? You bought these games, I'll tell you what.
6998000	7005000	You import them over, when those downloads become available, you get the Wii, you know, Wii U version for free.
7005000	7010000	I mean, really, what are they missing out on? A dollar? I mean, come on. Just do that.
7010000	7016000	I would show some really, you know, hey, you know what? We put this emulator out.
7017000	7028000	Or just give it slightly enhanced value. You know, like, how hard would it be to have, you know, certificates, achievements, trophies, whatever, for you beat the virtual-
7028000	7029000	Network multiplayer.
7029000	7035000	Network- for real! How hard is that? I guess, too laggy or something.
7035000	7040000	It's hard to build netcode in emulators. Oh, but wait, they already did that shit on PC.
7040000	7041000	Exactly.
7041000	7051000	Homebrew emulators have netcode where you can play games over the internet. Multiplayer. Oh, go fake.
7051000	7059000	Oh, Foliath. You know, the company that fucking made the games could come up with netcode. Oh, but that would be asking them to embrace the internet and they don't fucking understand yet.
7062000	7063000	Is that it?
7063000	7064000	That's it. Oh, okay. I'm dead.
7066000	7067000	I wasn't sure if there was more.
7067000	7070000	Alright, well, let's move on with something else about the Wii U.
7070000	7080000	And a very interesting comment that was made this week by Crystal Dynamics, who, of course, as you know, are making the Wii U-
7080000	7083000	Or, excuse me, they're not making the Wii- That was the comment.
7083000	7089000	Crystal Dynamics is making Tomb Raider, and the comment was about a Wii U version of Tomb Raider.
7089000	7098000	Because, you know, why not? We had, you know, Batman, Arkham City, and, you know, these other games that were- Mass Effect 3 were ported to Wii U.
7098000	7101000	So, where's our Tomb Raider port to the Wii U?
7101000	7110000	And, you know, if creative director Noah Hughes, if you try to read between the lines of what he said here, it's probably not happening.
7111000	7119000	Quote, I'm always a fan of Nintendo systems. In particular, they really push interface design, and from a game design perspective, it's fun to play with the new interfaces.
7119000	7123000	So, there's the nice little, like, I'm gonna say something nice, and then here's the but.
7123000	7129000	But, having said that, it's something that I think we would want to tailor the experience to if we were gonna do it.
7129000	7133000	And currently, we're offering it on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
7133000	7139000	And all three of those are really trying to deliver roughly the same experience, but delivered best on each platform.
7139000	7145000	I think something like the Wii U often asks you to do something unique based on a unique interface, so that's something as a gamer I love.
7145000	7149000	But it's something that you don't want to do half-heartedly as a developer.
7149000	7160000	So, in other words, they don't want to try and, at least what I'm hearing in here, they don't want to try and put Tomb Raider on the Wii U when it wasn't really designed with the Wii U in mind, when there's something extra going on there.
7160000	7163000	And I say, makes sense to me.
7163000	7164000	Yeah.
7165000	7170000	You know, maybe there's somewhere else where Lara Croft can fit on the Wii U.
7170000	7180000	You know, there were those games, the Xbox Live, thank you, the Guardian of Light, the PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live Arcade games.
7180000	7186000	I bet one of those games could be done very well on the Wii U, if they wanted to do that, I don't know.
7186000	7193000	I just think it's really late for them to, they've been working on Tomb Raider for a while, it's probably late for them to make a port.
7193000	7199000	And it might not be that beneficial because they're worried that the numbers aren't there yet to support that.
7199000	7201000	No, makes sense to me. I get it.
7203000	7212000	And honestly, I think the people that want to play Tomb Raider probably already have, are the types of people that already have Xbox, PlayStation 3, or a PC.
7212000	7215000	You know, like PC's a pretty big market, you know.
7215000	7218000	Anyhow, let's move on with more news. Dark Sakura.
7219000	7225000	Well, this is the news we've been waiting for, and it's already been all over the place and I'm sure everyone knows about it, but this is super, super awesome.
7225000	7238000	Basically, we talked last week about how Jonathan Coulton had been kind of shafted, well actually really shafted when it came to Glee's treatment of his cover of Baby Got Back.
7238000	7248000	So now, even though there's still some legal research going on with this, what he's done is re-released his original as a cover of a cover of his cover.
7248000	7257000	So now it's listed on iTunes, Amazon, and Google Play as Baby Got Back in the style of Glee.
7257000	7263000	And I paid for it, I mean it's a good cause, but basically what's going to happen with this, he's using the same license he had before.
7263000	7276000	So after basically Sir Mix-A-Lot gets paid, then the proceeds, well and iTunes, then any other proceeds are going to be donated to the VH1 Save the Music Foundation and the It Gets Better project.
7276000	7283000	Which roundaboutly goes back to Glee because they're also sending donations to that, so.
7283000	7291000	Yeah, a lot of what I, the comments I've been reading is that, you know, Glee is supposed to be all anti-bullying and stuff, but what is Fox doing to JoCo in this case?
7291000	7292000	Pretty much, yeah.
7292000	7293000	It's kind of sick.
7293000	7296000	I mean, it comes down to the bottom line, it's all about greed.
7296000	7300000	You know who the real winner is in this scenario though? Sir Mix-A-Lot.
7300000	7302000	Yeah, he's like, dude, all this money.
7302000	7306000	Who's given Sir Mix-A-Lot any thought recently, you know?
7306000	7308000	Seriously, like what's the last thing he's done?
7308000	7311000	That guy's like, thank god I can pay the rent this month.
7311000	7317000	No, he's actually, to tell you the truth, he's actually still been, I think he did like a lot of producing.
7317000	7319000	Yeah, I wouldn't doubt it.
7319000	7323000	But honestly, the last Sir Mix-A-Lot song that ever came out that I gave a damn about was Buttermilk Biscuits.
7323000	7324000	Huh.
7324000	7325000	So, just saying.
7325000	7329000	Game guru in our chat room says, Coversception.
7329000	7336000	He needs to actually be knighted, and then he can really be Sir Mix-A-Lot.
7336000	7340000	Because that would be awesome.
7340000	7341000	I love it.
7341000	7342000	Why can't we have that happen?
7342000	7347000	I don't know, write the Queen of England and suggest that, oh yeah, he's not English for one.
7347000	7350000	Who cares, whatever, we'll make an exception.
7350000	7351000	Make an exception.
7351000	7354000	I think that actually non-Englishmen can be knighted.
7354000	7355000	Okay.
7355000	7357000	I'd have to double check it, but I think so.
7357000	7361000	Well, maybe Sir Mix-A-Lot can just be an ambassador, you know, if it's good enough for something.
7361000	7363000	How about we just call him Mr. Mix-A-Lot?
7363000	7365000	Mr. Mix-A-Lot?
7365000	7369000	The ambassador to large posteriors.
7369000	7373000	Bootyvania.
7373000	7376000	Alright, moving on, Loki.
7376000	7381000	Alright, so, this guy, I don't know what to do.
7381000	7385000	Seriously, can these people get voted out of office already?
7385000	7388000	I mean, seriously, Senator Leland Yee.
7388000	7394000	You know, you hear that name, you know it's got to be something anti-gaming, and of course that's what it is.
7394000	7400000	Apparently, he made a comment to the San Francisco Chronicle saying, hey, gamers just have to quiet down.
7400000	7405000	Because gamers have no credibility in this argument, saying about the violent video games thing.
7405000	7410000	I'm sure he's trying to pass another anti-gaming law or something like that.
7410000	7423000	I think this is in response to all the, you know, voices you're hearing in the community about, hey, stop blaming us for that sick stuff that happened at Sandy Hook.
7423000	7427000	I think that's where he's saying, you know, gamers need to kind of be quiet.
7427000	7429000	And it's like, no, you be quiet.
7429000	7431000	No, you shut up.
7431000	7433000	I know, right? Such a mature argument, right?
7433000	7436000	But, like, in some ways I'm completely serious.
7436000	7444000	Like, I find that little comment by him to be very dismissive that, like, gamers are just a bunch of, like, angry kids.
7444000	7451000	And it's like, you know, most of us are, or I should say there's a big part of us that really grew up on video games as a part of our culture.
7451000	7459000	And we're in our mid-30s and even 40s now, and it's like, by the way, we vote, and you're not the mayor of San Francisco for that reason.
7459000	7461000	Partially.
7462000	7465000	By the way, I do have an expansion for what I just said.
7465000	7466000	Yeah.
7466000	7472000	Anybody can be knighted, but they can't accept a peerage unless they renounce their current citizenship.
7472000	7474000	So, just saying.
7474000	7476000	Well, Leland Yee should certainly not be knighted.
7476000	7478000	No, he should be set on fire.
7478000	7479000	I mean, did I say that a lot?
7479000	7480000	Metaphorically.
7480000	7482000	Metaphorically. He needs to be fired.
7482000	7483000	Yes.
7483000	7484000	Fired.
7484000	7485000	Much better. Much better.
7485000	7488000	Well, he ran for mayor of San Francisco, if I remember right. He didn't get it.
7488000	7490000	He can be smothered in the back of dicks.
7490000	7491000	Metaphorically.
7491000	7492000	Metaphorically.
7492000	7502000	I just, I don't know. I mean, there's just a lot of ignorant people out there, and they're only getting older.
7502000	7509000	Can you say that quote from him too? What was that again? Gamers need to, it wasn't gamers need to shut up, but gamers need to...
7509000	7516000	Gamers have just got to quiet down, and then gamers have no credibility in this argument.
7516000	7517000	What?
7518000	7524000	Yes, let me make your job easier in passing these unconstitutional laws. Let me just quiet down.
7524000	7533000	Why don't I just ignore the first amendment that gives me the right to call you out on your state spewing and misjudgment of our community?
7533000	7540000	Hey, you people of color, why don't you just quiet down, okay? We don't need to pass these equality laws or anything.
7540000	7542000	Why don't you just stop complaining?
7542000	7544000	Yeah, hey gays, shut up.
7544000	7547000	Yes, seriously, gays, just stop complaining.
7547000	7551000	Let them throw you in trash cans. Fag is just a word.
7551000	7555000	I'm just trying to do my job here, okay? Passing these laws.
7555000	7562000	But you know what? Women get the same thing too, because we're told we're not able to decide what goes on with our, you know, girl bits.
7562000	7568000	I'm sorry, you don't have a vag, you can't talk about it. That's what I think, and I say the same thing to the non-gamers.
7568000	7570000	You don't game, you're not allowed to talk about it.
7570000	7572000	Are you saying Leland Yee should play a video game?
7572000	7577000	Yes, I think he should. I mean, he can't grow a vag, but at least he can pick up a controller.
7579000	7582000	I mean, I guess we could arrange that in a, you know, some surgery.
7582000	7587000	But maybe Leland Yee, okay, in all seriousness, maybe Leland Yee needs to play Journey.
7587000	7589000	I'm not talking about the one from 84.
7589000	7600000	Leland Yee maybe needs to stop focusing so much on the Grand Theft Autos and the, you know, what the hell, Manhunt, which is like a 10-year-old game anyway.
7600000	7604000	And maybe he needs to start focusing on, like, some of the, you know, other things that makes our community great.
7604000	7607000	You know, again, Journey was voted Game of the Year.
7607000	7614000	No one's playing Manhunt anymore. I mean, seriously, my school just bring up, you know, Custard's Revenge.
7614000	7616000	All those kids are getting their-
7616000	7618000	Pixel dick.
7618000	7625000	They're just getting exposed to porn, you know, because of these games like Custard's Revenge that no one plays.
7625000	7631000	Or, like, you know, Manhunt that probably most kids nowadays don't even- they don't know that game.
7631000	7634000	They don't even know what it is because it's so fucking old.
7636000	7638000	Legend- I love this comment and I think we'll end with this.
7638000	7641000	Legend of Zaku in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
7641000	7646000	Leland Yee channeling his inner Marie Antoinette. Go eat cake, gamers.
7648000	7651000	Very well spoken. But we all know what happened to Marie Antoinette.
7651000	7652000	Well, yeah, but-
7652000	7653000	Metaphorically.
7653000	7660000	No, she got- she really happened to her. And besides that, though, I think that, uh, I think he-
7660000	7663000	God, my inner history nerd is totally just screaming.
7663000	7664000	Let it go, girl. Let it go.
7664000	7665000	I'll just tell him in chat.
7665000	7670000	Okay. See what you're missing by not being at live.vognetwork.com.
7670000	7676000	Well, uh, if you think it's just Leland Yee, you're wrong.
7676000	7682000	More light gun games and gun games disappearing after more complaints.
7683000	7687000	I'm sick of reporting on this stuff. Can we just go to the mailbag?
7687000	7690000	Let's just not report on it. Out of that, I-
7690000	7699000	Well, no, because- because the reality is there's too many people that are sitting by and watching this happen.
7699000	7705000	So I do feel a responsibility to say, wake up. You're getting blamed for this.
7705000	7719000	You, who might not even be into some of these video games, that you as a gamer, as somebody who sought out this podcast and downloaded it, knowing we talked about video games, you are a gamer one way or the other.
7719000	7728000	I'm- I'm- I'm 99.9% sure you are. You are being blamed for this tragedy that happened back East.
7728000	7729000	Wake up.
7729000	7732000	Don't forget about the other people who are getting blamed for it, too.
7735000	7741000	Are they? Well, yes, but let's- I mean, like, movies and TV and so forth, it seems like a lot of that-
7741000	7746000	Now I'm talking about autism spectrum people who are also getting shafted out of the whole thing, too.
7746000	7747000	Yes, that's very true.
7747000	7751000	You know who's to blame? It's that damn show, Grey's Anatomy.
7751000	7752000	It is-
7752000	7753000	It's the blame.
7753000	7755000	It is- it's Glee's fault.
7755000	7762000	There's so much violence on that show, blood and guts everywhere, and sex. There's sexing on that show.
7762000	7764000	Glee taught me how to steal.
7766000	7769000	I robbed a 7-Eleven because Glee said it was okay to steal.
7769000	7774000	Hey, I pirated all that music because Glee made it okay. Fox is saying, hey, this is what we do.
7774000	7776000	We copy- we copy that floppy until-
7776000	7778000	You got exposure?
7778000	7782000	Until the cows come home and says, you know what, hey, what are you gonna do?
7782000	7785000	But you should be happy then listening to your music.
7787000	7790000	Why don't you go make some more music so I can steal that, too?
7792000	7794000	I guess we should go to the mailbag.
7794000	7799000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place where you can send your emails every week.
7799000	7802000	And Dark Soccer will dive in the email bag head first to read them.
7802000	7803000	Yay!
7803000	7806000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. Dark Soccer.
7806000	7808000	I'm gonna have a headache now.
7809000	7814000	Our first email comes from, I'm gonna mispronounce the name, Ramaditya.
7814000	7816000	Hi guys, this is Ramaditya.
7816000	7821000	This month I tried to give you pictures from my wedding, but unfortunately Facebook blocked your access.
7821000	7825000	Now I would like to share one of the greatest parts of my marriage ceremony, the Star Wars wedding party.
7825000	7830000	And it's actually a YouTube video, so we really can't pull it up and watch it right now during the show.
7830000	7834000	This is the first three minutes where actually my greetings and preparation.
7834000	7838000	You may watch the duel in front of the audience when you reach the middle part of the video.
7838000	7843000	I hope this will inspire other fellow gamers to do something unique to their unforgettable events in life.
7843000	7846000	See, Dan and I, when we got married, we just went to the courthouse.
7846000	7849000	And then he, like, made faces at me and I punched him.
7849000	7852000	I punched him in the arm and told him to knock it off.
7852000	7854000	That was my wedding.
7854000	7856000	You punched your husband on your wedding day.
7856000	7857000	Yeah.
7857000	7860000	But that's what worked for you guys, and that's what's most important.
7860000	7862000	At the end of the day, you guys are the ones getting married.
7862000	7866000	We will watch your awesome duel when we are not live during the show.
7866000	7868000	But thank you for sharing it with us.
7869000	7870000	Next email.
7870000	7873000	Good day, OLR. Thank you so much for reading my email on the show.
7873000	7875000	I can't believe you guys are still on the air.
7875000	7876000	Neither can we.
7876000	7877000	Neither can we.
7878000	7881000	I've started listening from the beginning and it's brought back some outstanding memories.
7881000	7885000	I apologize if this runs a little long, but I first heard the show in a rather unusual way.
7885000	7890000	It was at an old glow-in-the-dark bowling alley double arcade owned by the nicest group of people I've ever met.
7890000	7893000	What I mean by double arcade is-
7893000	7895000	Somebody was playing this show at a bowling alley?
7895000	7897000	I don't know. Let me read it.
7897000	7898000	Awesome.
7898000	7899000	Let me read the damn email!
7899000	7900000	We say fucking shit.
7900000	7902000	Fuck, fuck, cock.
7902000	7903000	Okay.
7903000	7909000	What I mean by double arcade is that it was split into two adjoining rooms, each with their own genre of cabinets.
7909000	7912000	The first room was row after row of fighting games.
7912000	7918000	The other was the bimani room that hosts near-weekly tournaments of each and yearly bimani game festival.
7918000	7922000	On the morning of said festival, I remember hearing a clip from your show talking about 2DX.
7922000	7924000	I loved hearing the host chat it up.
7924000	7928000	I completely forgot to ask about it. I was too excited waiting for Chorus K to arrive.
7928000	7930000	And I've been keeping an ear out ever since.
7930000	7937000	Just to a few weeks ago, while looking up a new WoW podcast to listen to, I somehow ended up downloading an episode of Hoard House.
7937000	7941000	The whole episode, I kept thinking, boy, this Rob Roberts cost sure sounds awfully damn familiar.
7941000	7943000	And then you eventually mentioned OLR.
7943000	7949000	I downloaded the newest episode of that, and voila, I've somehow managed to find my show all these years later.
7949000	7953000	So thank you so much for everything you do and have done for the last decade now.
7953000	7958000	You've reminded me of some just simply unbelievable memories of a place that got flooded years and years ago now.
7958000	7961000	Much love. I guess it's Plagius? Plagius?
7961000	7968000	Wow. Hoard House did something good. Who knew that? I'm teasing, I'm teasing. That's pretty amazing.
7968000	7970000	Those are grandpa's jokes.
7970000	7972000	Still, the whole bowling alley thing blows me away.
7972000	7976000	I guess I have heard that this show gets played in some very interesting places.
7976000	7979000	I heard there was a GameStop that was playing this show somewhere.
7979000	7982000	And I'm like, can't you get in trouble for that? Because we use naughty language.
7982000	7984000	I don't know if they were doing it after hours or what.
7984000	7986000	Are we talking about the Evil G?
7986000	7989000	Yeah, right? So it must have been after hours.
7989000	7990000	Oh, the irony.
7990000	7992000	It must have been. I don't know.
7992000	7996000	That Evil G must be Goodfellas, or Goodyear Tires.
7996000	7998000	Goodyear Tires. Damn that Goodyear Tires.
7998000	8002000	Well, also, this was a few years ago before there was so much fuckery.
8002000	8008000	I mean, let's be real. There was a time and place when that was a store we all went to regularly.
8008000	8010000	And my husband worked at?
8010000	8012000	Exactly. It's different now.
8012000	8017000	I've heard of a LAN gaming center that was playing this show at one point, which, you know, that's pretty cool.
8017000	8023000	But yeah, bowling alley. So I want to say to all the bowling alleys, how do you cheer on bowlers?
8023000	8025000	Roll the ball.
8025000	8027000	Knock the pin.
8027000	8028000	Go turkey.
8028000	8030000	Get that turkey. Clap, clap, clap.
8030000	8033000	I don't know. I need Jay Links.
8033000	8035000	Jay Links, how do you cheer a bowler?
8035000	8037000	It makes me think of Global at...
8037000	8039000	What the fuck is that?
8039000	8041000	Country Club Lanes.
8041000	8043000	Yeah, one of our old school DDR spots.
8043000	8047000	The last time I did Global was when Mel and Melody were in town, and I think... Didn't you come too?
8047000	8049000	Probably. We need to go Global now.
8049000	8051000	It was like two in the morning, and we were like...
8051000	8055000	You know what this email wants me to do? It makes me want to go bowling, because I haven't been bowling in forever.
8055000	8057000	Let's do it while I'm not working.
8059000	8061000	Last email.
8061000	8065000	Hey, OLR. Decided to put some time into getting the Wiimote working on my Windows 7 machine.
8065000	8068000	But apparently the new Wiimotes don't like to play with Windows.
8068000	8072000	Do you have any suggestions you can point me towards, or even better, a sure-far way to get it to work?
8072000	8074000	Tanks in advance.
8074000	8077000	And this comes from Xenocore.
8077000	8083000	It should just work. I mean, it's Bluetooth, so it'd work like any Bluetooth device.
8083000	8085000	Sometimes they can be a little bit tricky to set up.
8085000	8093000	Like, I remember I had a Bluetooth dongle for my laptop, and I tried getting the Wiimote to work with that with an emulator.
8093000	8095000	And it was just like, nope, not gonna do it.
8096000	8105000	So it may just be you might need to try a different adapter, or you may need to try, like, you know, syncing in a different way.
8105000	8111000	I know you can't just push the sync button. I think you have to push the 1 and 2 buttons at the same time, if I remember correctly.
8111000	8117000	I know I got one to sync up to my Android phone to play some games on that.
8117000	8121000	Actually, that was my old Android phone. I should try the new one, too.
8121000	8126000	But I've got a Bluetooth controller for that now, and I think this laptop has Bluetooth built in.
8126000	8130000	Hell, I know my wife's netbook has Bluetooth built in, so I should try that.
8130000	8133000	I have to read this part of his signature, too.
8133000	8138000	Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely, trivial power corrupts disproportionately.
8138000	8141000	I love it. That's it.
8141000	8142000	That's it?
8142000	8143000	That's it.
8143000	8147000	We need more bowling alley emails. Mailbag at orangesontradio.com.
8147000	8148000	And we're spent.
8148000	8152000	So where's the craziest place you kids have listened to this show?
8152000	8155000	That's kind of what I want to know, like, for real.
8155000	8157000	I kind of miss strikes now.
8157000	8159000	There still is a strike.
8159000	8161000	I know, but that's why we need to go.
8161000	8162000	Oh, because you haven't been in a while.
8162000	8163000	I haven't been in ages.
8163000	8164000	All right.
8164000	8167000	You know I was just in Reno. You know what they have in Reno?
8167000	8168000	DDR1.
8168000	8173000	No, no, no, not even. I did see a DDR supernova machine this way. I should have said that. I did see DDR supernovas.
8173000	8176000	Did you go to where your DDR cherry was popped?
8176000	8177000	No, because that was in Vegas.
8177000	8179000	Oh, that's right. You went to Reno.
8179000	8182000	I was at the Rocky Horror 25th Anniversary Convention the first time I played DDR.
8182000	8185000	We decided to say, fuck it. We didn't go to Shock Treatment Night.
8185000	8194000	But anyway, the story I really want to say, in Reno, they have, like, it's a huge bowling center that's, like, I think it's like the national bowling.
8194000	8196000	Did you go to Circus Circus?
8196000	8198000	Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's where I saw DDR supernova.
8198000	8201000	But bowling! National. Oh, forget it.
8201000	8205000	Did they sell the Daytona machines there? Because they had, like, a ton of Daytona machines.
8205000	8213000	No, actually, truth be told, Circus Circus, sad. I mean, because it's the same thing that happened to every other arcade.
8213000	8216000	Ticket machines. Ticket machines, ticket machines, ticket machines, ticket machines.
8216000	8221000	And just like, um, just like Dark Tetsuya said about Country Club Lanes, which we haven't been to in forever,
8221000	8226000	Dark Tetsuya said, yeah, no DDR there anymore. This is all in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
8226000	8232000	Dark Tetsuya says, now it's all Dave and Buster style games like the Pac-Man Battle Royale and Faster Than Light or whatever that ticket game is.
8232000	8233000	Lame.
8233000	8237000	I mean, I'd hope they at least gotten DDR X2, but X3 or X2 or X3 were the last.
8237000	8242000	Yeah, Circus Circus, the only thing I caught, there was a driving game and I don't even remember which one it was.
8242000	8246000	Uh, just one of the flashy, it wasn't even, it wasn't like Initial D or anything.
8246000	8250000	It was, I think it was like, have they made a racing game out of Fast and Furious?
8250000	8251000	Yeah. I think it was that.
8251000	8255000	The Fast and Furious games are very similar to, uh, Cruisin'. It's the same.
8255000	8257000	Why can't we have Sugar Rush?
8257000	8261000	It was that and DDR. And the rest, ticket games.
8261000	8267000	Uh, claw machines, the, you know, Circus Circus, the casinos have the whole carnival barkers and those games.
8267000	8273000	That's still one of the few places you see that too. I mean, you know, now so many places have automated.
8273000	8274000	Yeah.
8274000	8275000	Horsey races and all that stuff.
8275000	8282000	They may have had, they may have buried them back in the arcades cause their arcades kind of go in like some subterranean caverns and crap back there.
8282000	8285000	We looked, we did a whole little, now granted, it was really crowded when we were there.
8285000	8286000	Wow.
8286000	8287000	Which is weird.
8287000	8288000	Yeah, it was weird.
8288000	8290000	Well, Saturday night.
8290000	8292000	Silver Legacy has theirs tucked away in the childcare center.
8292000	8300000	You know who had more arcade games was my favorite ghetto as fuck casino in the world. I love this place. Calneva.
8300000	8308000	Which is on the, it's on the strip in Reno. I just said Reno has a strip. It's so pathetic compared to Vegas.
8308000	8315000	But it does have a strip and the Calneva is there and, uh, I love the Calneva cause it's just, it's just so ghetto.
8315000	8323000	And you know, because there's no more Fitzgerald's or Virginia and you know, there's got, there's got to be a ghetto casino that holds that down.
8323000	8332000	And so Calneva really tastes the cake, but on the second floor they have arcade games, but they don't have really a lot of ticket spitters probably cause they can't pay somebody to run a ticket counter.
8332000	8339000	So they have like old ass recycled arcade games up there on the second floor. So that was pretty like a Neo Geo machine and that type of stuff.
8339000	8341000	Yeah.
8341000	8343000	No.
8343000	8346000	Anyhow.
8346000	8348000	Let's move on.
8348000	8354000	SSG 100 Matt says, was that the arcade in the wizard? I don't remember. Might've been.
8354000	8358000	Now I want to go look that up. Did they go to Reno in the wizard? Yes, they did.
8358000	8364000	Holy shit. It probably touched my breast. Right. I thought that was Vegas for some reason. It was Reno.
8364000	8368000	The only movie I associate with Reno is Sister Act.
8368000	8371000	It's Reno and Gamora.
8371000	8376000	Uh, Oh yes. Speaking of, uh, Reno, it's time for the FUs of the week, everybody.
8376000	8379000	Uh, where's the FU of the week music. Here it is.
8393000	8397000	So 500 is going to come up. We're still going to have that same intro from seven years ago.
8398000	8402000	I mean, Midi Head did a great job. It's great, but you know, seven years.
8402000	8406000	Hey Midi Head, if you're still listening to us, make us a new one, please.
8406000	8407000	All right. Inhale.
8407000	8408000	I won't scream.
8408000	8410000	FU is the week time. Varsagra.
8410000	8419000	I don't know. I guess FU did not having a job now, but at the same time, not having my old job is awesome.
8419000	8423000	So I guess that's good.
8423000	8426000	Yeah. I'm done.
8426000	8431000	Loki, um, FU to drivers making right turns.
8431000	8435000	For some reason, people cannot make right turn fast enough for my satisfaction.
8435000	8438000	Like they will slow down to like no speed at all.
8438000	8442000	I don't understand why it's so hard to make a right turn and to this dick.
8442000	8444000	Like, I don't know what it was.
8444000	8451000	Some guy coming off the freeway today and like went across five lanes, no signaling whatsoever.
8451000	8454000	Oh, but managed to signal during his left turn.
8454000	8458000	Like actually in the middle of the turn, he flipped on a signal for no apparent reason.
8458000	8462000	Stupid kid driver.
8462000	8467000	My FU of the week goes to chain requirements on IAD.
8467000	8470000	Enough said.
8470000	8473000	So I'm looking at Wikipedia.
8473000	8481000	They finally arrive in Reno, where it is revealed that Haley wants her share of the prize money to help her father buy a house with the help of an acquaintance trucker.
8481000	8490000	They use the money when it craps tables to train Jimmy on several games in the Reno arcades using Nintendo play choice, 10 machines.
8490000	8494000	Maybe that was, I need to find that scene online.
8494000	8499000	So which, which, uh, they don't say on, on Wiki, what, what may have been set.
8499000	8501000	So that's why it may have been a set.
8501000	8503000	That's actually a very good point.
8503000	8505000	All right. Anyhow.
8505000	8506000	All right.
8506000	8510000	Um, so blockbusters closing more stores, which is kind of bad.
8510000	8512000	Um, they're closing up 300 stores in the U S here.
8512000	8518000	They just closed another 160 in the UK where they've recently filed bankruptcy there.
8518000	8524000	And, uh, that brings them down to a total of 500 stores in the States and 500 stores in the UK.
8524000	8533000	What is kind of unique and not something that's actually reported on this article here in something I've got to know a little bit of information on is they're actually going to start doing game retail.
8535000	8536000	Oh, really?
8536000	8537000	Yeah. Not just rental.
8537000	8539000	You will be able to preorder your games there.
8539000	8540000	Hmm.
8540000	8541000	Soon.
8541000	8544000	Actually starting with, uh, March.
8544000	8546000	That's why I was on the call.
8546000	8548000	I was on to this week.
8548000	8556000	Uh, yeah, so maybe they'll pick up your copy of a MLB or why I will be cause it's too late for that Bioshock though.
8556000	8557000	Bioshock infinite.
8557000	8561000	You'll be able to pick up your local blockbuster if you are ever so inclined.
8563000	8565000	Very important research I need to do here.
8565000	8566000	Live on this show.
8566000	8568000	This is very, very, very important.
8568000	8571000	First off, what is that guy in the background?
8573000	8574000	Okay, hold on.
8574000	8575000	No one wears that.
8575000	8577000	No one, no, nobody wears Speedos in public.
8577000	8578000	All right, hold on.
8589000	8591000	Got you, Jimmy boy.
8591000	8593000	Time to go home, son.
8594000	8595000	We're too late.
8596000	8598000	He touched my breast!
8601000	8602000	That is not the Calneva.
8602000	8605000	The arcade at the Calneva is on the second floor.
8605000	8607000	That does look like a Hollywood stage.
8607000	8608000	It's probably where that was filmed.
8608000	8609000	Yeah.
8609000	8610000	They might've just said it was that.
8610000	8614000	Anyhow, very important, very important question we had to answer.
8615000	8617000	I mean, that was crucial.
8617000	8620000	I could not continue the show until I knew if that was the case.
8620000	8624000	I could not continue the show until I knew if that was the Calneva or not.
8625000	8628000	I wonder if she's used that line before.
8628000	8631000	Like, now that she's grown up a bit.
8634000	8638000	Shane Alingo in our chat room says, Jimmy grew up to be super hot.
8641000	8642000	All right, moving on.
8642000	8644000	One last story for you guys tonight.
8644000	8649000	And this has to do with an arcade beat-em-up game coming to Facebook.
8649000	8653000	And apparently it's turning some heads because it is a console-quality game.
8653000	8657000	You know, when we think of Facebook games, we don't think of a lot of really great games.
8657000	8661000	Or it's, you know, click and then give me money for more energy pills.
8661000	8664000	Like, there's just not a lot of great, great games on Facebook.
8664000	8671000	The only one that I think a lot of console and PC gamers will give any cred to is maybe, like, You Don't Know Jack.
8671000	8675000	You know, because it's, you know, that kind of gets a little bit of a break.
8675000	8678000	But not a lot of hardcore stuff on Facebook.
8678000	8682000	Well, I don't know if you guys knew about this, but there's a new developer, N-Way.
8682000	8686000	And this is a San Francisco-based company. They were founded in 2011.
8686000	8688000	It was founded by game industry veterans.
8688000	8694000	And their sole purpose is console-quality multiplayer games to the web and mobile platforms.
8696000	8700000	David Jones is with this studio. He was the founder of DMA Designs.
8700000	8701000	Wasn't he a monkey?
8701000	8703000	Well, it's now Rockstar North.
8703000	8708000	He created Lemmings and the original 2D Grand Theft Auto.
8708000	8713000	Stieg Hedlund, who was the lead designer in the first two entries for Diablo.
8713000	8716000	Chronoblade is the game that they've put together.
8716000	8721000	Which, if you actually look at some of the screenshots, I'm like, that does kind of look like Diablo.
8721000	8725000	But more of like a, I don't know, not like that same type of perspective.
8725000	8729000	It looks a little more, I don't want to say hack and slash, because that is kind of Diablo.
8729000	8731000	But you see, it looks like there's the red orb and the blue orb.
8731000	8737000	And, you know, there is definitely, I mean, I look at this and I go, oh, this is like an Xbox Live arcade game, right?
8737000	8741000	Nope. Apparently it is something that is on Facebook.
8741000	8743000	They're calling it an arcade-style brawler.
8743000	8748000	And it apparently is going to be very similar to Diablo.
8748000	8756000	Chronoblade exists in a series of parallel worlds that will band together to fight against a common foe.
8756000	8761000	So, I'm assuming this means maybe the parallel universes is how you interact with your friends?
8761000	8769000	I don't know, but they also say this is a way to have like a Viking-themed world and steampunk world and kind of cross all these areas together.
8769000	8771000	So that's pretty cool.
8771000	8775000	And it's going to be completely free to play and there is a beta sign-up website if you want to check that out.
8775000	8780000	If, you know, maybe this will be the Facebook game that it will be okay to like.
8780000	8782000	Who knows?
8782000	8784000	There you go.
8785000	8788000	Would you play a game like that even though it's on Facebook?
8788000	8789000	Loki?
8789000	8790000	No.
8790000	8792000	No? Alright, fair enough.
8792000	8793000	I just know a Facebook game.
8793000	8795000	Yeah, I hear you.
8795000	8800000	1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.
8800000	8804000	And we'll take your calls here on the show for a few minutes here.
8804000	8806000	And whatever you want to talk about tonight.
8806000	8808000	If you want us to watch more scenes from the wizard, we can do that too.
8808000	8810000	Just let us know. I'll queue it up.
8810000	8811000	That sounds so fun.
8811000	8812000	Alright.
8812000	8815000	I'm ready for each caller tonight. I will play a new scene from the wizard.
8817000	8818000	Alright.
8818000	8820000	Loki, do you have any last minute news stories while we wait for those calls to come in?
8820000	8825000	Again, that's OrangeLoungeRadio all one word on Skype or 1877 Game OLR.
8825000	8829000	Apparently there is a company, Team Pixel.
8829000	8831000	They're an independent company.
8831000	8836000	They are crowdfunding to buy THQ's Homeworld IP.
8836000	8849000	Apparently they are trying to raise, I guess, $50,000 by February 7th in order to acquire the property to make another Homeworld game.
8849000	8851000	Let's go to the phones. We have a call coming in.
8851000	8853000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8853000	8855000	Oh, it is me. One named Jason.
8855000	8858000	Hey, Jason. Long time no see. How are you?
8858000	8860000	Yes, a terribly long time.
8860000	8862000	I know, but you're back in Colorado now.
8862000	8870000	I am back in Colorado after a seven hour train delay that got me in town at one o'clock in the morning and was kind of garbage by the end of it.
8870000	8872000	But, you know, train problems.
8872000	8876000	And now that you're back in Colorado, how was it to hear me bitch about one inch of snow ruining my day?
8876000	8886000	I chuckled, but I also kind of, I know exactly how you feel because when I first went out to California in March, St. Patrick's Day weekend,
8886000	8895000	it was snowing over the Sierra Nevada and the bus that I was on had to throw on chains or some other, you know, whatever vehicle that size has to use
8895000	8901000	and go like 25 miles an hour over Donner Pass and that whole bus ride was just garbage.
8901000	8907000	Well, thank you, Jason. You're a true friend, making the listeners understand my pain. So what did you really want to call in to talk about tonight?
8907000	8912000	Just kind of an idle thought when I was listening to you talk about your trip to Reno.
8912000	8917000	A coworker mentioned something to me a couple of months ago, something along those lines.
8917000	8929000	And he said that it was a sad day when he realized that audio, musical hardware companies produce things predominantly for churches and broadcast
8929000	8934000	and not like musicians and clubs and studios or anything like that.
8934000	8940000	And so he started to get to explaining how as churches crop up and start having recordings
8940000	8946000	and even if you know of churches that broadcast on the local stations over the air in the area.
8946000	8951000	And I had thought about a church that I used to go to when I was really young
8951000	8957000	and I remember being in the production studio and seeing all of those screens, this gigantic mixer,
8957000	8969000	all of the audio coming out of these ridiculously powerful speakers for recording an orchestra, the preacher and whatever else that they have going on.
8969000	8976000	I could see that. There's a lot of television around the church program and so forth and I always associate church in my mind.
8976000	8985000	The church I went to when I was younger was a very small place and the whole freaking place could probably hold maybe 80 people.
8985000	8993000	So there was nothing like what you're talking about. But I know there's other churches like you get these mega churches that are like, you know, that it's like going to a rock concert.
8993000	8998000	You know what they call my church? When I lived in Alabama, six flags over Jesus.
8998000	9002000	Seriously, go to Google Maps and look up Dauphinway Baptist Church.
9002000	9009000	Oh, I know. Texas has some just like some churches buy arenas. They are that big.
9009000	9010000	We built an arena.
9010000	9014000	So, yeah, no, I told like now that you're saying this, I'm like, yeah, that makes sense.
9014000	9027000	And it is kind of an interesting parallel to and I'm assuming that's the parallel you were making, too, is that a lot of stuff that maybe we get in gaming might have been developed for, you know, lounge gaming or whatever you want to call it, casino gaming.
9027000	9036000	Yeah, absolutely. And you already you already laid all of it out when you were talking about it, because, sure, the DS is a tiny screen and has two screen depth 3D.
9036000	9044000	But you were just talking about and I saw the picture to a four screen. I don't know how big was that? Would you say one hundred fifty inch screen?
9044000	9051000	Oh, that is gigantic. Yeah. I mean, it had enough space so that you had, I think, for you saw Alan posted on Facebook.
9051000	9056000	Right. It had like room for at least, I think, six people to sit. Yeah.
9056000	9064000	And, you know, that was one edge of the screen to the other. And they're like those fancy chairs that, you know, vibrate like you feel the bass in your ass.
9064000	9070000	If you hit the jackpot. I mean, that's got to be one fun chair to sit in when you get a jackpot.
9070000	9074000	It's a Sex and the City game, for fuck's sake. And that only makes it even better.
9074000	9076000	That explains everything.
9076000	9080000	That is. Oh, my God. That was the part that blew me away. I'm like.
9080000	9081000	This game is orgasmic.
9081000	9089000	Really? This? Like, Deal or No Deal? I get that. Wheel of Fortune? I get that. Sex and the City? What?
9090000	9099000	But, you know, there's a lot of little old ladies that love Sex and the City and they love Reno. So, I guess it does make sense.
9099000	9111000	And a lot of people, I remember CES both this and last year, I believe, that people, they scoff about the 100-inch TVs and the, you know, the life-size TVs and everything else like that.
9111000	9120000	It's like, oh, yeah, Bill Gates is going to have three of these in his house. I have, the Red Robin closest to me has an 80-inch TV in one of the dining areas.
9120000	9133000	And it's mighty impressive to look at. But it's, there's certainly application for all of this stuff that you wouldn't imagine would be the result after seeing it shown off and the fact that they really do advertise it to everybody.
9133000	9137000	And the best and most rich people pick them up.
9137000	9139000	Like, essentially, rich companies, rather.
9139000	9153000	Very good point is that we often forget about the many commercial uses of this stuff. You know, there is a very large football game occurring next week that people are going to want to, you know, go to a bar together and watch.
9153000	9159000	And I hope that bar has one of these 100-screen TVs if they want to fit a lot of people in there and they can all get a good view of the game, you know?
9159000	9163000	One very small related note that I figured I would talk about.
9163000	9164000	Sure.
9164000	9174000	I read something a while ago about, like, corporate parties and big conventions, notably, like, for example, oh, I don't know, the Democratic and Republican national conventions.
9174000	9182000	The rentals for these kind of items don't really exist, so they buy up these huge gobs of resources, of digital resources.
9182000	9187000	And I've even heard stories about, oh, crap, what were they called? Segways. There we go.
9187000	9192000	And they sell that stuff off to recoup as much cost as possible dirt cheap.
9192000	9204000	So if you know anybody that puts together some kind of a party where they have to buy up expensive items, keep talking to them after it wraps up because there's probably a good chance you'll get some serious deals on things.
9204000	9211000	If you live in a swing state that's likely to host one of these conventions in 2016, check Craigslist the next day. That's what you're saying?
9211000	9223000	I don't know. I'm pretty sure there's a lot of legislation that tries to go along Craigslist, but you never know. Maybe a staffer got their hands on something and, oh, sure, I'll buy it and throw it in the till. I mean, it could happen.
9223000	9230000	Trust me, you never know. The Democratic and Republican parties aren't technically a part of the government. They're their own independent things.
9230000	9240000	And trust me, as somebody who used to date a politician, I used this word earlier and got yelled at for it, but I'm going to use it here. It's very interesting to see how all that works.
9240000	9248000	Anyhow, that's all I'll say. I gotta ask you this before I let you go. What is this I'm seeing in chat? You still to this day have not seen The Wizard?
9248000	9253000	You know, I was wondering who was going to bring it up, but I didn't think it would be during this call.
9253000	9254000	Surprise!
9254000	9262000	The first answer is that me and movies, oh, that looks interesting and it's not in theaters anymore. Oh, that looks interesting and it's not in theaters anymore.
9262000	9274000	I really enjoy movies and I really don't see very many of them. It's very strange. But I didn't even see, not Captain N, oh, the Mario Brothers Super Show. I didn't watch that until Ryan made me watch it like two years ago.
9274000	9281000	Somehow I missed that in my youth and plenty of other of these fun little gaming things that everybody knows about, except for me.
9281000	9285000	Well, all I have to say is you better set aside 90 minutes next time you're in the Bay Area.
9285000	9287000	I don't have a problem with that.
9287000	9291000	All right. All right, buddy, I'm going to let you go try and get another call in, all right? Have a good one.
9291000	9292000	Thanks, YouTube.
9292000	9293000	All right, bye.
9293000	9305000	Very interesting, you know, that sometimes there's these uses for things that we don't always think about. That's a very interesting, like the music, DJ stuff, churches are a big business for that.
9305000	9307000	Who would have thought of that?
9307000	9314000	I always remembered we actually had a really, again, this was at the mega church that I went to. God, thank God I'm not around that anymore.
9314000	9326000	But they had a whole full AV set up with like something, I want to say, like five different sound panels, spotlights, you name it, and an orchestra pit. I'm not joking.
9326000	9331000	Wow. Good. Big stuff. All right, we got another call coming in, so let's go to it.
9331000	9333000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9333000	9337000	It's Jim Sully. Woo!
9337000	9338000	Hey, buddy, how you doing?
9338000	9341000	Dude, Rob.
9341000	9342000	Me?
9342000	9345000	You got an inch of snow and you're going to put chains on your tires? Come on.
9345000	9347000	I checked the-
9347000	9348000	For an inch of snow?
9348000	9358000	Google I-80 chain controls. This is public information. Google it from last night. I swear to God. I don't make the rules, the Highway Patrol or Caltrans or whoever does.
9358000	9366000	I think it's, well, I would say I think it's silly, but at the same time, driving home, we saw two accidents.
9366000	9371000	And there wasn't even really snow on the road, but there was still a little bit of ice and the residue snow.
9371000	9382000	And we saw about like six dude bros in a Suzuki crash their car, airbags deployed and everything and scary stuff.
9382000	9387000	An inch of snow or not, it's how it kind of fucks with those roads.
9387000	9394000	And again, I want to remind you guys, you're going downhill for a big part of that. Once you cross Donner Summit, you're going downhill.
9394000	9397000	I don't, I barely step on the gas driving home.
9397000	9404000	Listen, Rob, two days ago I got seven inches of snow.
9404000	9411000	And it was, I'm not kidding you, it was minus 40 Celsius, which is like, I think minus 45 Fahrenheit. Yeah.
9411000	9414000	The cars wouldn't start, Rob. The cars would not start.
9414000	9419000	Wait, where in Canada do you live again?
9419000	9427000	I'm Elk Lake, so I am like, do you know where Detroit is? I know where Detroit is. I'm 10 hours north of Buffalo.
9427000	9433000	Oh my God. Wow. This is where I live, buddy. 10 hours north of Buffalo.
9433000	9436000	10 hours north of Buffalo.
9436000	9441000	Wow. Oh yeah, I see this huge, huge lake in Canada. So you live by this big lake?
9441000	9445000	Well, it's the Montreal River. I live, the Montreal River goes right through my backyard.
9445000	9451000	I'm 100 feet from ice fishing right now, pickerel, buddy. I got seven this morning.
9451000	9459000	But listen, listen, forget about this. You were talking before, too, about the craziest place that people have listened to Orange Lounge Radio.
9459000	9467000	Dude, like six years ago, I guess. Like, yeah, about six. I think you guys were on, you guys were on the old place.
9467000	9472000	And I started listening to you guys. And then I worked at this sausage factory called Schneider's.
9472000	9479000	And I was an elevator operator. I just moved the elevator up and down five floors with meat on it. That was my job all day.
9479000	9484000	And then Sunday nights when I could get away, I'd go to the top of the elevator where the little motor is and stuff.
9484000	9493000	And I actually had an ethernet cord that I pulled through from the third floor, up the fourth floor, up the fifth floor into this room in an old, old 386 or Pentium II.
9493000	9499000	It was an old computer, but I could just barely run fucking Winamp on it. And I would listen to OLR for the last three hours of my shift.
9499000	9506000	Oh my god. We were in some empty-ass elevator in the middle of Canada. That with an ethernet...
9506000	9509000	At the top of a sausage factory. At least it was the top of a sausage factory, right?
9509000	9511000	Wow.
9511000	9516000	And that was it. That was my job every Sunday night. Because there was nothing to do Sunday nights. The other shift would end at seven.
9516000	9521000	But I would get paid to stay there till midnight because someone's gonna be on the elevator. Like, do the fucking union jobs, right?
9521000	9526000	Oh my god. Talking about the long ethernet cable that makes me think of the year.
9526000	9532000	Do you remember when we did the live DDR tournament in San Francisco? B3 or whatever it was called? At Pier 39.
9532000	9538000	We actually broadcast from Pier 39. It's one of our more, like, if we were to make a resume, like the Orange Mountains Radio & Resume, that would be on there.
9538000	9545000	Because, you know, Pier 39 is a big touristy spot. And we had to run. Do we have to go to Radio Shack and buy, like, a 100-foot cable?
9545000	9546000	I think so.
9546000	9547000	To run it? To where?
9547000	9550000	Yeah, that's what I had to do too. I had to steal one from the IT department.
9550000	9551000	Oh my god.
9551000	9558000	One for a cable or a spool. I had to go to maintenance and get, like, this drill. Dude, the drill bit on this drill that the maintenance guy gave me was sick.
9558000	9563000	It was, like, two and a half feet long with a big brick bit on it. And I was like, well, where can I drill it?
9563000	9564000	But now how does it feel?
9564000	9567000	Anywhere you want. Don't hit a wire.
9567000	9574000	How do you feel knowing now, like, six years later? Like, no problem. Just bring up the iPhone and, well, then I don't know.
9574000	9575000	Oh, I know, right?
9575000	9578000	I don't know what kind of coverage you have up there, but, I mean, even if on three...
9578000	9579000	Well, excellent coverage.
9579000	9580000	Oh, then you can...
9580000	9585000	We have DSL. We have the same DSL that I had when I lived down south, but there's 500 people in my town, so it never slows down.
9585000	9586000	Oh my gosh.
9586000	9594000	Like, there's no tweeners. There's... If you go to the elementary school, there's 12 kids, I think, from the ages of 10 to 16 in the entire town.
9594000	9596000	Oh, boy oh boy.
9596000	9598000	It's so... I know, eh? It's a different life.
9598000	9605000	Jim, you've thrown the gauntlet, and I love what SSJ100 Matt is suggesting in chat. We should have this topic as a FUGL question.
9605000	9607000	Strangest place you've listened to OLR.
9607000	9608000	That's a hell of a way to...
9608000	9609000	Good luck, people.
9609000	9611000	Yeah, it's... I'm curious to know this.
9611000	9614000	Who's gonna be the top of an elevator at a sausage factory?
9614000	9615000	I don't know.
9615000	9619000	With a hundred foot of Ethernet cord going downstairs to a manager's office that I had to break into.
9619000	9625000	I had to break into a manager's office and install a router so that I could take the cord out of the back of his computer and stick it in the little router bridge thing.
9625000	9627000	Look, you know what I'm talking about.
9627000	9630000	And then you have to stick the other cord in because you can't just stick the two cords together.
9630000	9631000	No, no, no.
9631000	9633000	Could have a little router thing in the middle.
9633000	9634000	You're hardcore, Jim.
9634000	9635000	Oh my god.
9635000	9641000	I was hardcore. Don't take this the wrong way. I was desperate to listen to anything besides, like, Canadian radio.
9641000	9644000	I didn't want to listen to anywhere Canadian radio.
9644000	9647000	And ever since then, Rob, I've been in love with you, man.
9647000	9648000	Was it all Alanis and Rush?
9648000	9649000	Well, shucks.
9649000	9656000	Every time I think about packing sausage, Rob, I think of you.
9656000	9659000	Well, the only sausage factory I think of is a place in the Castro.
9659000	9661000	And it's not what you think. It's actually an Italian restaurant.
9661000	9665000	But it's funny because when you talk about the sausage factory, I'm like, oh, it's a yummy restaurant in the Castro.
9665000	9668000	The Castro is, like, the gayest part of San Francisco.
9668000	9670000	Yes. But anyway.
9670000	9676000	Well, Jim, I'm going to let you go. Before I let you go, I'm just going to say, in my defense about the whole, like, one inch of snow thing,
9676000	9682000	come to my neck of the woods sometimes and get through 105 degrees summer.
9682000	9687000	Oh, I'm looking for two plane tickets now. I can use it.
9687000	9692000	You'll melt. All right. Jim, buddy, have a good one. And thanks for the story. That was great.
9692000	9694000	You too, guys. Everyone be safe, okay?
9694000	9695000	All right. Bye.
9695000	9699000	Don't forget. Don't forget, okay? This is winter driving safety tip, okay?
9699000	9700000	Okay.
9700000	9708000	If you're going up a hill and your tires start to spin, you're giving it too much gas or not enough.
9708000	9710000	What a helpful tip.
9710000	9713000	And he hung up on that. You jerk.
9713000	9715000	Where did you find that?
9715000	9718000	No, very important Allen question. Where did you find that?
9718000	9722000	It was on the nice leather recliner, but under a Snuggie.
9722000	9723000	Snuggie was hiding it.
9723000	9728000	We couldn't find the fourth microphone for Allen tonight. Apparently, it was under a Snuggie.
9728000	9732000	Who knew? Speaking of cold.
9732000	9736000	Yes, how many Snuggies do you have to wear for minus 40?
9736000	9738000	Is that, like, five layers of Snuggie?
9738000	9742000	I don't know. I think your body just gets used to it at some point, you know?
9742000	9744000	Yes, it gets used to it when you're dead.
9744000	9748000	Stop it. All right, let's go to the phones. We have another call coming in. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio. Who's this?
9748000	9750000	Hey, hey, hey. It's Ronma.
9750000	9752000	Hey, hey, hey. What's up, Ronma?
9752000	9758000	Hey, not much. I'm in a bit of a pissy mood. I want to vent.
9758000	9765000	Well, please. When I think of where do I want to vent, I think of Orange Lawn's Radio. Please, by all means, the stage is yours.
9765000	9773000	Well, every morning, part of my normal routine, I read the paper. I get to a certain point in the paper. I put it down and go about my business.
9773000	9782000	So, I'm reading the editorials like I usually do. Did I see something here in the paper? I swear to you, I have never seen before.
9782000	9785000	I have a bad feeling I know where this is going. Go for it.
9785000	9792000	Oh, you! Coming off of what we explored on our podcast last week. Oh.
9792000	9802000	Yeah, the title goes, Put the Blame on Video Games. Never in the entire moment I wanted to punch a window so badly in my life.
9803000	9812000	There are people out there that think this way. This is a shocking reality, and it is infuriating that people could be so ignorant.
9812000	9816000	What was the gist of the argument, or did you even get that far?
9816000	9823000	It was only two paragraphs from two different people. That's all it was. It's just one person.
9823000	9829000	Now, what is local? They're pretty much just saying the biggest reason for gun violence is the violence associated with video games.
9829000	9836000	They are a breeding ground for future murderers. It is too easy to sit in front of a video game and shoot animated figures on the screen.
9836000	9842000	There is no moral responsibility for the characters you shoot up. There is no pain when your character is killed or wounded.
9842000	9847000	It is all done knowing that the only thing you have to do is reload the game to get a new life.
9847000	9857000	Okay, now, if all the violence I've done through video games, and that means when I see someone trying to shoot my ass, I should see them sitting there with an Xbox 360 controller trying to target and auto-aim.
9858000	9868000	A breeding ground for future murderers. Well, Dark Sakura, you know, since you're job hunting again, you could be a murderer. That could be your new career.
9868000	9869000	Contract killer?
9869000	9878000	Yes. I mean, because you play video games, clearly. What did you say you've been playing this week? Mass Effect and Bomberman mixed with Pac-Man? Well, shit.
9878000	9880000	You're a terrorist. Bomberman.
9880000	9882000	Oh boy, yeah, you bomb things.
9882000	9889000	Except if I was actually gonna be a contract killer, I'd use, like, blades and poisons, so that doesn't work for me. Not my style, sorry.
9889000	9892000	Well, you're gonna have to play more Thief and Assassin's Creed.
9894000	9898000	Nope. The only thing video games taught me how to do is throw balloons at people.
9898000	9901000	Because, you know, we don't know right from wrong.
9902000	9905000	And I can't do magic, so clearly, you know, WoW hasn't helped me.
9905000	9912000	Because gamers, gaming, Rama has some, you know, obviously I'm not saying this at you, but the person who wrote that.
9912000	9917000	Gamers, obviously, we don't know how to tell the difference between the real world and our digital world.
9918000	9924000	You know, just like movies are real. All movies are documentaries. The Blair Witch Project, totally true. Right?
9928000	9929000	Wow. Yeah.
9930000	9932000	It was a horror film, that's for sure.
9932000	9943000	But, Rob, the thing that really pissed me off the most about this is that something like this you would expect in the New York Post, or as I like to call it, the Republican News Daily.
9944000	9948000	This came out of the Daily News, the leftist paper that I read.
9949000	9959000	Guess what? Leland Yee is a Democrat. Idiocy does not know Republican and Democrat balance. There are idiots on both sides. That's another harsh reality.
9960000	9961000	Idiocy is non-partisan.
9962000	9967000	Yeah, idiocy is non-partisan. And there are people that are way too extreme in their thinking on both sides. That's reality.
9968000	9976000	You know, after the initial shock event, I realized, you know, this is why I'm in the middle. I hear what both sides have to say before I make my decision.
9977000	9979000	That's the way I look at it. Because this is just, no.
9980000	9981000	Yep.
9982000	9987000	Maybe there should be, like, I know we always talk about third party. There needs to be a third party in this country.
9988000	9995000	Well, let's start somewhere with, like, you know, just, like, not being so naive when it comes to media.
9996000	10001000	I like what SSJ100Mass said. I was a white mage in Final Fantasy XI. I guess that gives me the credentials to perform surgery.
10002000	10003000	Absolutely. Curata.
10004000	10007000	I'm really good at, um, crap, what's that surgery game now?
10008000	10009000	Trauma.
10009000	10010000	Trauma Center.
10011000	10017000	You know, I should be a weatherman because I was a black mage in Final Fantasy XI, so, you know, it's gonna rain. Bolt 3, motherfucker.
10018000	10020000	That's exactly what I'm talking about.
10021000	10030000	Well, Rama, thank you for making us all angry. Thank you for sharing in your pain with all of us here and the listeners. We really appreciate it. Anything else you want to, uh...
10031000	10034000	IkumaJP makes a good statement. White mage doesn't perform surgery, they just pray.
10035000	10036000	Heal, please. Prop, please.
10036000	10039000	Alright, uh, Rama, anything else you want to share with the listeners before I let you go tonight?
10040000	10052000	Yes, listen to this week's episode of Anime Jam Session. We go over two hours. We post, we added a special rant because some dipshit decided to post their rules for cosplay.
10053000	10054000	Oh, I remember reading that, bitch.
10055000	10056000	Oh, no.
10057000	10064000	Yes, yes, because of me going nuts and a bunch of other people, she took the post down and locked, and she deleted her like page.
10064000	10070000	But it's still archived, because once it's on the internet, it's there forever, and people have reposted the archive.
10071000	10075000	Rama, this is for this week's episode of Anime Jam Session. I'll let you borrow this, okay?
10080000	10089000	You know what else pissed me off in the cosplay world this week? And this was all over Tumblr. But there was this girl at a convention, and I don't remember which one, sorry.
10089000	10094000	Oh, I remember reading about that. There are people that I associate with that are friends with her.
10095000	10096000	No, wait, what happened? What happened?
10097000	10102000	I didn't even say who it was. It's like you read my mind. Okay, it was the girl in the TARDIS dress.
10103000	10104000	Oh, yeah, she was...
10105000	10106000	And she opened up the bottom part.
10107000	10108000	She was awesome!
10109000	10111000	It was awesome! Like, how fucking clever is that, right?
10111000	10121000	And then, so there's this screen grab on Tumblr of her, and then all these Facebook comments. She's fat. I guess it really is bigger on the inside. All this other, like, just really...
10122000	10122000	
10123000	10128000	Yeah, garbage is the only way to say it. And I'm like, I thought she was hot, to be honest.
10129000	10129000	
10130000	10133000	I'd like to see those assholes cosplay and pull off something that clever.
10134000	10134000	
10134000	10135000	And I bet...
10136000	10145000	I'm not sure what the thing is. That argument's been going on in the cosplay world for years, because there are actual photographers that refuse to take pictures of people that are plus size.
10146000	10147000	Oh, my God.
10148000	10149000	And when, like, they don't exist, drama.
10150000	10159000	I show them my photos. I'm like, you see these plus-sized cosplayers? They're doing some remarkable, a remarkable job in what they do. I'd like to see someone skinny pull that off. Just saying.
10159000	10173000	Tigerclaw in chat says, Travis talked about this last night on Understation Live. I was in Reno. That's my excuse. I'm waiting for the podcast before I hear, but I will, I'm sure they covered it very well, so I will tip my hat and mention Understation Live this week.
10174000	10186000	Hopefully they get the podcast updated soon, because I would like to, I would love to hear those guys rant on the TARDIS thing, because that was, I, she was, I thought she was a great looking gal and very clever.
10186000	10189000	Yes. Yes, it was. It was phenomenal. Simple as that.
10190000	10192000	I want to wear that dress for, like, a wedding.
10193000	10197000	I would wear that dress. Shit. All right. Rama, I gotta let you go, all right?
10198000	10199000	Oh, you got it, bro.
10200000	10201000	All right. Take care, buddy. Later.
10202000	10211000	All right. Thank you guys so much for the calls. I do have to wrap up. I'm going to close up the Skypline for tonight. If you did not get through, though, I always say please write down your thoughts, send an email, make Jamie work.
10212000	10220000	Mailbag at orangeontrader.com. Or Twitter. I gotta get to Twitter topics as well. Loki, did you have last minute stories before I get to the tweets?
10221000	10222000	There's just a couple tonight.
10223000	10225000	There were layoffs over at Superbot. Thanks.
10226000	10226000	
10227000	10230000	Yeah, Sony confirmed that, so that kind of sucks. They didn't say how many, though.
10230000	10245000	All right. Let's see. Just a couple quick tweets here. And actually, let me, I'm sorry, guys. I'm going to pull this up. Live radio. It's a blast. I'm pulling this up on the show computer because I couldn't find my iPad because I think it's still in the luggage.
10246000	10248000	So, I'm bringing up the show computer tweets real quick.
10248000	10264000	There were two, and the first one was from, here we go, Tigerclaw. Disney is prepared to look at game violence because, you know, there is that call on the industry. Are games to violence? Well, Disney.
10265000	10272000	You know, when I think who's putting out the most violent video games in existence right now, I go, oh, shit, it's Disney. You know, right?
10272000	10282000	But to be fair, Disney, you know, they stuck their big toe in the water with the more serious gaming with the whole split second, but then again, they closed that studios. I don't know.
10283000	10286000	The only violent game I can think of that they published was Turok.
10287000	10304000	Well, Robert Iger said, quote, at Disney, there's very little violent content, but I still want to make sure we're asking ourselves the right questions in term of that standard and also ensure we're willing to be a part of a dialogue in today's world that I think is pretty necessary in terms of what our role is and what our role should be.
10305000	10309000	You know, I got to be honest. I wouldn't read too much into that. I think he's just saying the right answer.
10310000	10328000	You know, because at the video game industry, you don't really want to poo poo it. I think it was smart that all those guys went to go meet with Biden when he asked the video game companies to meet with him because it's like, if you don't sit there and represent yourself, somebody else will do it for you and it's probably not the person you want representing yourself.
10329000	10337000	So, I think it's nice that Disney said this, but it's kind of the expected answer, I think.
10337000	10349000	One more tweet here from SSJ100Matt who tweeted us, new age of gaming classifieds. A group has started on Facebook for people looking to buy, sell, rent arcade machines.
10350000	10357000	Really? Arcade Exchange, a Facebook community for buying and selling the classics. Maybe you can find one of these for Pinball Dark Sakura.
10358000	10364000	It is listed as a page created to help bring together the hundreds of collectors and enthusiasts from around the world into one place.
10365000	10371000	It's through Facebook, but it allows members to post their for sale or wanted ads just for arcade machines and their related parts.
10372000	10377000	That's kind of rad. I'm going to look at the Facebook community myself right now.
10377000	10389000	Facebook.com slash Arcade Exchange, all one word. Oh yeah. Ooh, a Killer Instinct PCB, HD and Marquee. It doesn't boot up, but it's 75 bucks.
10390000	10395000	That's just, that's like literally just the little board, not even the machine or anything. That's still kind of neat though.
10396000	10406000	A Pump It Up Fiesta 2010 upgrade kit for $400. Oh look, pinball machines. There's a Terminator 2, Roadshow, Revenge from Mars.
10407000	10414000	That's pretty cool. I wouldn't mind the Revenge from Mars. Revenge from Mars, 1800 bucks. Yeah, that one's going to be expensive.
10415000	10419000	Huh. That's neat. Thanks for that link. That's a great one. Maybe get rid of my stuff.
10420000	10426000	Uh, one more tweet from Ross Steel UT coming in here at the last minute. I'll read this. Can gaming get outside of the man cave?
10427000	10432000	The reaction to people speaking against the Dead Island statue suggests we're still stuck in.
10433000	10439000	I'm not sure I'm following the logic on that. Wouldn't people speaking out against the Dead Island statue be a good thing?
10440000	10450000	Because that was pretty irresponsible. And it was not, it was just, it was, it's just in bad taste. That whole thing was just in bad taste.
10451000	10460000	But am I, am I thinking that maybe the statue itself suggests that we're still stuck in? You need to send an email, Sarah. I want to, I would love to hear your thoughts. Elaborated.
10460000	10470000	Nailbag at orange lounge radio.com. Um, more, uh, last minute stories tonight. Loki. No, no, I guess that's it then. That's it. Yeah.
10471000	10477000	We're wrapping up the show. It's about that time anyway. Uh, we're going to go around and get last minute thoughts in a minute here and final thoughts and all that.
10478000	10484000	But, uh, first I want to say thank you very much for downloading our show tonight. Thank you for tuning into orange lounge radio and supporting independent podcasting.
10484000	10496000	Um, you know, if you like the show, please tell a friend or two, uh, about the show, help spread the word. That's all we ask. Leave a nice review on a website somewhere like five star review on iTunes always helps all that good stuff.
10497000	10505000	Um, just help spread the word. That's all we ask. So, all right, let's, uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night and we'll start with Loki. Your final thoughts tonight.
10505000	10515000	I almost bought another game for steam. Um, it's addicting. Well, it has max pain, max pain threes down the 14 bucks and I mean that's a $60 game right there. So there you go.
10516000	10526000	Um, I may do that cause I wanted to see how the multiplayer combat games for rockstar have gotten since, uh, granted thought of, uh, dark soccer. Your final thought tonight.
10526000	10549000	And my final thought tonight is it's time for more Nino Cooney. Thank you everybody very much for listening to the show tonight. We'll be back to do it again next week. I think, uh, stay tuned to our Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R, but one way or another, for those of you that celebrate it, enjoy the football game on Sunday.
10549000	10557000	And for those of you that don't enjoy the empty shopping malls and all the other things that there will be to do next Sunday. Have a great week or museums as the case may be. Right?
10558000	10561000	Yes, that's right. I'm going to the Crocker Museum to see a Norman Rockwell exhibit.
10562000	10565000	Sounds like fun. All right. Have a great night everybody. We'll see you next time. And next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
