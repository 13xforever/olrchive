10566	12228	Sky, and Loki!
13909	20074	Tonight, July 14th, 2013, there will be no sequel to Zombie U and we get inside as to why.
20435	25639	Exhibitors are announced for the Tokyo Game Show, and is League of Legends the next great American sport?
31894	36736	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36836	41697	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode 512, July the 14th of 2013.
42157	44538	How you guys doing out there?
44858	46959	Live at live.vognetwork.com.
46999	52641	We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network right after the Bobby Blackwell Show, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
52961	56222	And we always love it when you can come out and participate live with the show.
56242	61504	But if you're listening on the podcast feed, be it through iTunes, through Stitcher, through whatever it is you use to listen to podcasts,
61824	62525	DarkSakura.com
80444	81885	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
109984	111105	Yeah.
113305	118387	Also say hello to, and I don't know how firm his butt is, but let's say hi to Tech Master Loki.
118727	118988	Hi.
119748	120388	How are you doing?
120748	121529	Doing fine.
121689	126090	Probably not that firm when you get two cheeseburgers at McDonald's, but today you have Subway.
126250	128691	You going the Jared diet or what's up with this?
129032	129452	No diet.
129472	130912	I just got sick of eating cheeseburgers.
130932	131693	That's fair.
132993	134494	I've actually been trying to eat better.
134974	136856	I've been doing more salads at work.
136936	138977	I don't go out and get fast food.
139017	140258	How do you like in the candy bar?
140838	141219	Shut up.
141239	141859	I was going to get to that.
142359	144141	I do have Friday as a cheat day.
144681	148784	And I was like, chicken McNuggets don't even sound good.
148844	150125	So I think that's a good thing, right?
150145	151846	When the really bad food starts to sound bad.
151866	153647	After a while, it stops tasting good to you.
153867	160431	But then Dark Sakura, this bitch, shows up and brings candy bars to the show.
160672	162653	And they're not just any candy bars.
163514	168361	They're crunch bars with Girl Scout cookie mix or something in them because basically she brought me Samoas.
168621	169682	Basically candy bar form.
169903	174228	But if you read the label, they are less bad for you than a serving of Samoas.
174589	174889	Oh, cool.
174909	176952	The entire package is 190 calories.
176992	177893	Cool, can I have two?
178013	178835	Yes, you can have two.
179375	181776	Well, bitch, if you want to eat it, then sure.
181996	185878	I will just do some butt-firming Just Dance 4 after the show, too.
185938	187979	Oh my god, I had the worst Mongolian barbecue last night.
188099	192221	Never go to Sue's Mongolian barbecue in Santa Clara.
192821	193481	Oh, okay.
193921	195242	Girl, girl, first mistake.
195382	197163	You went to Mongolian barbecue in the Bay Area.
197183	197383	No.
197943	199444	Yet to find a good place over there.
199464	201845	No, Dan said that they had a really good place that they went to last year.
202025	202305	Okay.
202625	206507	And so we thought we were going there, but they went to a different place, and it was nasty butt.
207267	208228	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
223524	234094	Look, I want to introduce a guest that doesn't drive us to drink out of anger, but we might have a drink with him because he's a good friend of the show and he's been here on and off for really the past 12 years.
234454	237017	Hopefully you recognize this name, even though he hasn't been here in a while.
237057	237497	Say hello.
237577	238078	Welcome back.
238358	239539	Bradley is here.
239759	240220	Hello.
240300	241000	How's it going?
241180	243062	Arcadian42, if you rather.
243282	243543	Yes.
243983	245424	Is that still your screen name all these years later?
245444	245885	Yes, it is.
246145	246445	Awesome.
246605	247206	Still going that way.
247526	247887	Howdy.
247927	248447	How you doing?
248647	249268	I'm doing okay.
249528	250248	What's new with you?
250348	252630	Catch us up on the past year, since you've been on the show.
252650	253870	Well, it was about six months ago.
253890	254590	Okay, six months ago.
254610	255611	I haven't done too much different.
255651	259213	I went to California Extreme, and I saw Dan, but I didn't see Jamie at all.
260813	265916	I was actually hanging out in the Bimani Corner for quite a while, and then I hung up playing Metallica for quite a while.
266816	267496	Yeah, I played that one.
267517	268137	Did you get to play it?
268277	269117	Yeah, I played it a few times.
269137	270038	Did you get to play Wizard of Oz?
270438	271638	No, I saw it, but I didn't have time.
271658	273739	Did you see the horde around Wizard of Oz?
274220	274880	I got to touch it.
275489	275829	California Xtreme
303877	330493	California Extreme is basically a bunch of pinball tables and a bunch of classic arcade games and a couple of new ones here and there like I said there was a 2DX and a couple of DDRs and a Beatmania 3 and also it's where a lot of pinball vendors which the number is kind of dwindling now but parts vendors will come you know people sell like I almost bought a Bionic Woman lunchbox like from when I was an infant I was so close
331634	335375	So anyway, it's just a big... Man, lunchbox.
335695	337816	No, no, I ended up not.
338336	340577	And people, there's documentaries they do there.
340597	341297	They do panels.
341337	350320	Like we went to this one that was called Galaxy Game where they were talking about the old Space Fight game and how they programmed it and how much a computer cost in 1971.
350440	350320	$13,000.
350721	352141	Yeah.
352161	354862	Yeah, it was expensive.
355242	357883	It talks about having 8K of RAM and how wonderful it was.
359533	362102	It was just a really neat event.
362604	365394	And I ran into tons of people I know that I never see.
366107	369830	So it's like a celebration of classic gaming with like a splash of modern gaming.
369930	370170	Yeah.
370630	375094	It's basically if Bobby Blackwolf's show were an expo, right?
375914	378897	Well, it's also, you know, all these games are on free play on top of it.
379557	384621	And Stern comes out every year and brings like their top new tables.
385562	387783	And so there was like an Avengers there.
387863	389064	There was an X-Men.
389144	391506	There was ACDC.
391586	395349	There was the new Metallica table with all the three different types of back glass on it.
396503	396665	and
399019	401519	It was just really a lot of fun.
401639	415342	And of course, man, I feel so bad because the guy who owns this Big Bang Bar, actually no, he I think sold it to the convention finally, a Big Bang Bar prototype, which was like one of Capcom's last tables they produced.
417082	418242	It's really beat.
418282	419042	It's in rotten shape.
419082	419923	It needs to be shopped.
420583	428304	But the thing now is that you can get repro parts for it because they've actually, there's a person reproducing the Big Bang Bar table in Kingpin.
428564	429484	They had a kingpin there too.
430284	436086	And then there were like the Gottlieb tables that were all like Miami Heat instead of Miami Vice and Raven instead of Rambo.
436646	439506	You know, all these little knockoff titles because they couldn't get licensing.
440327	444228	And, you know, Data East tables that are always kind of between cheeseball and awesome.
444568	446748	There's a Super Mario Mushroom world there, you know.
446788	447368	I love that one.
447708	449569	Yeah, and it was broken when I tried to play it.
449589	451929	And then all these other people who were taller than me were trying to play it.
451949	453109	It's like, dude, I'm actually the right size.
453610	454950	And then there was this game that had like
456334	460299	It's like called Alley Cat or something that had trash cans and they lift up.
460359	461300	It's a little kid's ball game.
461640	462581	Oh, I've seen that.
463062	467647	Melody and I were there, got on our knees and we're just throwing balls and balls and balls and balls at it.
467848	469710	So you got on your knees and we're playing with balls.
470090	470511	And cats.
470971	471552	Balls and pussy.
471652	473354	Okay, just making sure we're clear.
473374	473795	Balls and pussy.
474015	474275	Alright.
475356	475837	Good times.
476838	478959	Bradley, were you on your knees playing with balls at some point?
479980	481040	Oh, not really your thing?
482381	488924	I didn't get on my knees, but I did play that little, the Super Mario one, the small table.
489525	489905	Oh, yeah, yeah.
489925	492766	Because Mario had a kid's table and an adult table, right?
492786	494867	Yeah, because they were right next to each other.
494907	497769	They did have one that was on adult-sized legs.
498329	498589	Yeah.
498669	500170	But it was just to display the LEDs.
501264	505446	That might have been something different, but there was two next to it, the little one and the other one.
505486	512990	I don't know the complete name of it, but there was an arcade near my high school that had it.
513050	517052	Actually, Ice Rink had it, and I went there and played it every so often.
517433	518253	It was a good, fun one.
522720	533899	I was just gonna say about California Extreme it's not really just the games either you because you run into a lot of people right which is what ticks me off why I couldn't go because you ran into like tons of people blast from the past from the DDR days right
534588	537970	Yeah, I ran into Richard.
538310	541692	I saw Chris Tang, which you see Chris Tang at every event that has the money.
543813	546014	I ran into Ali.
546094	548175	I ran into Wendell, of course.
548916	552438	And Chris from DDR Freak back in the day, he actually arrived late at night.
552578	555159	I'm in the middle of playing the song, and then I end the song.
555179	557160	Next thing I know, I'm in this bear hug.
557961	558601	It was awesome.
558701	559041	That's cool.
560882	561582	It was pretty cool.
561602	563343	Kind of like a little mini con of sorts.
563363	563963	Yeah, pretty much.
564084	577190	And then it's a lot of, you know, because a lot of us who, you know, started off back in the day, we're all grown up, so we were going out, you know, drinking in the, because there's like a little bar in the front of the Hyatt, and, you know, $15 lemon drop, but I also did want Grey Goose.
577910	582492	So we're all actually out there having our adult frou-frou drinks and talking about games.
582632	584253	Is it more of an adult convention?
584413	586694	Like, I'm not talking about... There were some kids there, but a lot of people...
587094	589035	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
605399	610182	We actually ended up hanging out at a table just chatting about collections versus buying a house.
611022	612663	Because that's what Dan and I were trying to do.
612703	614925	Did you get more listeners for VOG while you were there?
615185	616005	I did pimp us out.
616085	616465	Okay, good.
616946	624190	And there's some people, I'm sorry I've forgotten to put you on my Facebook, but hi, it was great to meet you.
624470	626051	And I met a friend of Kyle Snyder.
627216	628577	DarkTetsuya put together had his premiere in it.
655467	657228	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
685464	688705	I just thought it was pretty interesting.
689205	691205	Running into people who knew people that I knew.
691525	699627	And I spent all day on my DS checking where I tagged people from.
700368	702768	And running into people whose screen names I recognize.
703908	705949	And going, I want to send them a message!
706489	707389	Find me shit!
707549	710710	You should be able to add friends from that.
712318	715499	or at least send a message.
715539	721600	I actually did tag him twice and I could have sent him a message but it was toward the end of the night and he wouldn't have gotten my message.
721720	723801	So, whatever.
724081	724861	You're having fun with your 3DS.
724881	726541	This is only the second week you've had it, right?
726861	730502	I swear everybody... Oh yeah, I've already got... Let's see.
730942	732062	I've expanded my house.
732282	733703	I bought my house, expanded it twice.
734183	736663	Bought my upstairs, expanded it once and I have my basement now.
736803	737863	I'm paying for my dream suites.
738264	739664	I'm getting Club LOL and...
740544	743928	Blathers wants to expand my museum.
744008	745550	You're on it in Animal Crossing.
745670	746211	Fuck yeah.
746531	746892	Awesome.
746952	754201	It's because I go to the island and pick fruit instead of doing the little games and then go sell my fruit and then I do it like five times in a day.
754901	755642	That's how to do it.
755722	756343	That's how to do it.
756784	757505	I'm making money.
757685	758005	That's 80s style.
758866	760768	All right, let me go back to Bradley, our guest.
761829	763812	Bradley, you had fun at California Extreme.
763852	765834	Were you there Friday and Saturday or just Saturday?
766114	766755	No, just Saturday.
766815	768477	There's a Saturday-Sunday convention.
768997	769898	Why did I think it was three days?
770018	770339	I thought it was.
770359	771320	No, just two.
771580	773482	Gotcha.
773642	776806	What kinds of games have you been playing the past year or six months?
776846	778367	Have you beaten anything lately?
779248	780008	and DarkSakura.
798616	807039	As you get more money, once you die after a while, because the enemies are kind of hard and it's easy to fall into spikes and all that kind of stuff.
807499	809560	So once you die, you basically build up your castle.
809960	819863	Basically, as you upgrade, you get different options, and you get new options for what children can be, and runes and things like that to basically expand your gameplay.
820923	845503	Help you along, get you more HP, more MP, and other options like that And then you keep trying over and over again for hundreds of times Yeah, I saw this game on Steam and I wanted to get it But it is not part of the, and we'll obviously have to talk about this The Steam sale going on right now, which has many people's attentions But it's still worth it outside the lack of sale price, right?
845802	849025	Yeah, actually I did see it on sale for like $2 off or something like that.
849125	850906	Not too big of a deal, but... Well, it's something.
851306	854549	Yeah, but I bought it at $15 and that's well worth the price.
854629	860013	That's no like Tomb Raider for $12 or Borderlands 2 for $10, but that's still a pretty good deal.
860193	862135	Yeah, and you can play this for hours and hours.
862695	863836	Some people can beat it pretty fast.
863856	869380	That took me like 22 hours just because I took a lot of time exploring the castle each time and didn't try to kill the bosses really early.
869620	869781	Mm-hmm.
870641	871641	So... Okay.
872122	875643	And then there's Nuclear Plus and you can just keep going and going as much as you want.
876063	876323	Nice.
877023	877903	That sounds like a fun time.
878383	881484	Another big game was playing Animal Crossing.
881504	883225	I've been playing that shitloads.
883765	886066	Obviously, I'm already up to 85 hours in the game.
886246	886386	Like...
887606	887926	DarkSakura.com
906674	909877	and part of it too is that it's a slow process.
909897	912941	Like if I could just open up my 3DS and be in my town, yay, I'd be there.
913241	920048	But it's like you gotta open it up, load the game, wait for the game, wait for the thing to load your town, then you gotta make sure you save and quit.
920068	921129	Are you gonna get Mr. Resetti?
921409	923691	It's just kinda like it takes too fucking long to get in there.
923991	924232	True.
924252	925453	No, I don't think so.
925673	925993	I do.
926014	929497	Yeah, but it is a lot of time investment to do a bunch of things.
931280	940442	Yeah, and basically the masterboards I go at basically have loads of people that are messing with each other and getting swapping items and all that stuff.
940782	941082	Okay.
941142	942903	So basically I've gotten a lot of stuff.
943663	944543	Almost done with the house.
945123	951765	Well, you will get my small pitiful house in your plaza now since I see the green light on my 3DS.
952325	952525	Yeah.
952625	953405	There you go.
953425	956326	And other games, FTL was a big game that I played a lot of.
956946	960087	And I played that this week for the Trading Garden thing.
960107	960347	Yeah.
961449	963331	And you got sucked into that trading card thing too.
963672	964053	I don't know.
964133	965354	I don't know about the trading yet.
965555	970122	Actually doing the trading because that seems like a ton of annoyingness.
970622	972826	But I did play that and a bit of Meat Boy.
973527	976191	Super Meat Boy and haven't played too many other games that were...
976784	981245	in that thing that's trading cards so far.
982365	983466	Well, they're adding new ones every day.
983946	984586	Yeah.
984766	996449	Because I probably go play... I want to play Portal and Portal 2 again because I haven't played them on Steam yet so I could see them other than 720p and watch them in 1080 or however good they are for the Steam version.
997529	998650	So I might do that pretty soon.
999310	999590	Awesome.
1001370	1006112	And another big thing right now is the new Meat Plaza games.
1006872	1009393	Basically, they just released those last week.
1010133	1012333	You can basically get the bundle for $15 of all four of them.
1012934	1020876	And basically, I think near the beginning of California Extreme yesterday,
1021676	1028866	I almost spent an hour standing off right near the entrance doing the updates for those, or doing those games.
1030529	1037298	Basically, for each new game, you can take all the 10 tags that you have and take them through each game, so that takes a lot.
1037718	1040500	Yeah, that's not for convention play.
1040700	1041340	You know what I mean?
1041360	1042361	That's just too many people.
1043521	1047183	For when you occasionally street pass with people, I think that's a good thing to do.
1047343	1049725	They need to let you hold more than 10 people in the buffer, though.
1049925	1050625	That would be nice.
1050705	1052426	That would be nice for conventions.
1052446	1054807	That was annoying because then I think I'd be done.
1055588	1057569	And then like, nope, more people.
1058249	1060230	Imagine when I was at E3.
1060370	1062651	I'm just waiting until my next Disneyland trip.
1062972	1063232	Oh, yeah.
1063692	1065113	Disneyland's not as bad.
1065153	1068835	I mean, you will fill it up partway through the day, so you want to check a couple times a day.
1069175	1074978	And it's going to be harder with these four new games because now it's like, now I've got to play the Fantasy Zone game.
1075018	1078280	Now I've got to play the Kingdom game and whatever.
1078881	1079381	It's a lot.
1079701	1085825	So I think I kind of have to pick my battles and which game do I really want to progress on the most?
1085945	1089226	And for me, that's the puzzle trading to get the little 3D pictures.
1089246	1090027	I did finish two puzzles.
1090187	1090467	Did you?
1090547	1090947	Congrats.
1091128	1091268	Yeah.
1092268	1094230	Yeah, they just opened up two new ones.
1094550	1099173	Right when I was like, I was within like 40 pieces of having everything and now two new puzzles.
1099433	1100334	She's four new puzzles.
1100394	1100854	Bastard.
1100954	1101254	Really?
1101454	1101695	Yes.
1102015	1102715	Oh my God.
1105197	1105557	Jerks.
1106878	1107519	All right, fair enough.
1109580	1113802	Well, I guess I've been blurring the line here a little bit between trying to interview Bradley and getting to our gaming weeks.
1114182	1116304	But one thing I wanted to bring up was Steam Sale.
1116564	1119665	I'm sure you guys listening to this show can't avoid it.
1119765	1123367	What is it about the Steam Sale that gets everybody in the gaming community talking?
1123407	1123868	I guess it's...
1124648	1126370	Probably them prices, right?
1126450	1128972	The fact that, you know, what is it today, right now?
1129053	1131135	Tomb Raider, as of the taping of the show, $12.
1131175	1135219	Actually, that was yesterday's deal, but they last for 48 hours, right?
1136800	1137801	Borderlands 2 for $10.
1137942	1140264	In the season pass, another $10.
1140764	1141605	Really cheap stuff.
1141885	1142446	And then, of course...
1143967	1144568	or by spending money.
1164483	1165504	or by crafting badges.
1165945	1166786	Thank you, Loki.
1167287	1172594	He gave me the two cards I was missing in the Super Meat Boy set and I crafted my first badge before the show.
1173054	1177500	And I got a summer sale card for crafting it now.
1177860	1182166	And I got my little emoticon that's deal with it with the Super Meat Boy shades.
1182887	1187072	And I got the Dr. Fetus background with the big middle finger from my profile.
1187092	1187832	So that's kind of awesome.
1188453	1191737	So if you visit my profile, well, I haven't changed it yet, but I will.
1191837	1194120	But I will be flipping you off on my Steam profile.
1194861	1202049	But I wanted to say, if you are getting into the trading card whoring thing for no explainable reason like myself, visit vognetwork.com.
1203150	1203891	Check out the forums.
1204371	1207673	I have posted an official Steam trading card forum there.
1207713	1211055	Not only did I trade with Loki, I traded with Rababa the other day.
1211535	1215337	I'm starting to trade with other people, but I would like to help out VOG listeners.
1216298	1221361	I'll go to the general Steam trade community if I must, but I'd rather help the VOG people get the cards they need first.
1221861	1225123	I only have a couple extras right now, but if I have something you want, let's talk.
1226143	1227064	Because now, what do I need?
1227084	1229085	I'm two cards short on Really Big Sky.
1229105	1233067	So if you have the cards for that, help me out.
1234327	1241431	Alan Alchemy in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, The trading cards are neat, but I'm annoyed at their integration into the sale.
1241471	1247854	They already had a great metagame for sales that worked and did more to enrich and create content for the community, in my opinion.
1248254	1252756	Like, write a recommendation for a game you own, post screenshots, and so on.
1253497	1253557	Um...
1254657	1259080	Yeah, you know, Steam did kind of generalize that into a community badge.
1259320	1260141	So it's there.
1260261	1267506	But yeah, I liked, I did like how you'd kind of get the perks every few months when they did these big sales, the summer sale and the winter sale.
1267966	1276472	Like I do kind of miss that a little bit because the kind of homogenizing it all into just the general community badge is going to make the sales lose that little special end of it.
1276552	1279113	But the trading cards is something.
1279314	1280955	But I draw the line at spending real money.
1281855	1282195	I won't.
1282296	1282656	I won't.
1282876	1283336	I promise.
1283516	1283837	I won't.
1285357	1289099	But I will probably end up with Borderlands 2 because Bobby got Borderlands 2.
1289279	1289699	I'll play.
1289819	1290760	And you've got Borderlands 2.
1291060	1292000	I do and I haven't played it yet.
1292020	1293021	Loki has Borderlands 2.
1293081	1297022	That's four people to all play some co-op on live streaming.
1297262	1297783	What do you think?
1298463	1299423	What do you think, DarkSakura?
1299443	1299963	What do you think?
1300644	1301024	All right.
1301104	1302745	I get the thumbs up in the other room.
1303205	1303465	All right.
1304205	1308407	Let's get into our other gaming weeks and the other types of games that you've been playing this week.
1308720	1309020	DarkSakura.com
1320700	1321120	DarkSakura.com
1347506	1347747	Okay.
1348429	1348850	That's alright.
1349673	1351959	I figured you probably got out what you were currently playing in there.
1351979	1354106	Well, Jamie's back, so let me ask DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1354537	1354757	Fuck.
1355558	1355838	Busy.
1356859	1359201	I played a lot of Beatmania 2DX.
1359301	1361843	I got to try a lot of new songs, some of which I passed the first time through.
1362324	1364746	I was playing on standard, so, you know, easy mode.
1367328	1368409	I passed Starmine.
1368529	1369490	Ain't no shame in that.
1369530	1370731	You're in your mid-30s now.
1370771	1371812	You get to tone it down a bit.
1371832	1373914	I haven't touched it since we last had one.
1373934	1374895	And what did we have last?
1374915	1375375	A red?
1376276	1380320	So, and this is a, it actually had the DJ Troopers banner on it, but it was a Tricoro.
1381790	1384551	So I got to play a lot of fun stuff.
1385432	1391814	I played some Beatmania 3, which going from 2DX to Beatmania 3, the timing is just freaking bizarre.
1392655	1399057	So anyway, I played Quartet, which I was super disappointed that I couldn't hear the music.
1399118	1404220	So our fortune cookie reflects the music because I want to freaking hear that song.
1405320	1411485	Um, I also played, um, I didn't play Journey, but because there was someone on it every time.
1412806	1414487	Um, I played a lot of Metallica pinball.
1414747	1415608	It's super good.
1415668	1420972	And it's like funny with me and three other people behind me singing Master of Puppets while I'm playing the game.
1421462	1421942	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1443550	1461219	and he got it signed by uh the uh I think the artist's name was Dirty Donny I think he got it he just ran into him and got him to sign it so that was cool um I uh I know I played a bunch of other stuff well I you know I did play some uh
1463114	1465496	Little Inferno, as far as not classic stuff.
1466036	1468457	I pretty much played a ton of different games.
1468497	1470358	I played Timber with Melody.
1470498	1470939	That was fun.
1471239	1473360	And then we threw our balls at some pussies.
1474201	1474981	And it was pretty fun too.
1475001	1478883	I also played ACDC Pinball.
1479003	1479504	I played...
1482702	1483362	Big Bang Bar.
1483482	1492325	I played the Wizard of Oz pinball and I've got some, like I said, some footage of it that I'm going to be putting on my Tumblr and reposting to the Orange Lounge Tumblr later tonight.
1493205	1494286	Including the rainbow mode.
1494366	1495286	Rob, it's so cool.
1496026	1508350	It's like they've got multicolored LEDs underneath the in the playfield so that they'll cycle through different colors over each area instead of just having the standard incandescence of the older tables.
1508770	1509331	It's pretty neat.
1510411	1510491	Um
1512063	1518266	So yeah, I won't go too much into the classic stuff because, like I said, there's a bunch of it there and I played a bunch of it.
1520147	1522048	I played a lot of Animal Crossing, like I said.
1522589	1526411	Little Inferno, I finally put down the two bucks to get Little Inferno on Steam.
1526871	1527812	It's freaking fun.
1527992	1528352	It's like...
1528872	1529973	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1551341	1569131	and you just burn stuff and you can like earn money the more that you burn things and buy different things out of catalogs and as you get different combos of stuff you unlock more catalog and you have to use up your catalog before you can get a new catalog and just you have to make 99 different combos of stuff
1569551	1570132	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1590809	1594552	Put in Pluto and then put in the sun and then the moon and then it'll do everything.
1594572	1596012	You get like ice cubes.
1596093	1600715	There's one that's called the well-medicated combo that's like wine and happy pills and stuff.
1601356	1602136	That one's pretty funny.
1602256	1604618	And the wine is called the Midlife Crisis Mitigator.
1606609	1607270	What game is this still?
1607310	1607710	Little Inferno?
1634063	1637284	And I actually have not played any Mass Effect for an entire week.
1638404	1639884	Oh my god!
1641605	1642245	What is the date?
1642265	1643765	July 14th, episode 512.
1644265	1648186	The one where she didn't play Mass Effect all week long.
1649046	1650447	Holy shit.
1650567	1656728	Rob, in my defense, I've been looking for houses and I didn't play live on Thursday because of the stupid cough.
1658044	1658845	So you know what?
1659746	1661528	I'm allowed to take a vacation.
1663310	1665332	Commander Shepard is shedding a single tear.
1665973	1671418	Sometimes people in relationships need to take some time off from each other.
1672099	1673921	Allowed to take a vacation.
1673981	1675803	That is something a pod person would say.
1678203	1684208	Anyway, I did buy a few more games on Steam, but I forgot what they were because I'm probably going to buy more tonight.
1684929	1689393	But I was going to get FTL, but it just doesn't seem like my kind of game.
1690393	1693996	Oh, I did get Hotline Miami and the download pack.
1695057	1707387	And I haven't tried it yet, but it just looks like it's so much fun because I like going around in a virtual environment, a safe virtual environment where there's no risk that I'm actually going to do anything like this in real life and kill a bunch of people.
1708387	1711030	And big bloody massacres with a neat soundtrack.
1712030	1717735	It's not like I'm going to go plug in my iPhone and listen to some Deadmau5 and shoot up a mall.
1718395	1718876	Not going to happen.
1720058	1721699	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1746596	1752543	Um, so I figured I needed a little bit more than just the really cheap blower fans that they had on there.
1752603	1761434	So I crafted a thing using, uh, basically the parts I had from my, my PC and my laptop cooling tray.
1761854	1764678	So after, you know, cutting some of the plastic around and stuff.
1765018	1784494	I screwed in two 120mm fans in there that are from my Antec case so they have the three speed settings and of course you need a dedicated 12V power supply so I have a separate plug in the wall now and I had to manufacture a super long Molex cable to connect to it
1785234	1787957	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1805313	1806134	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1827709	1831372	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1848866	1849066	Yeah.
1850207	1853068	So I'm not picking that up yet.
1854249	1856630	Although tomorrow, that's another thing.
1856690	1858951	That gameplay trailer, which I haven't seen yet.
1859491	1860112	So amazing.
1860152	1861092	How'd you feel about that?
1861312	1862073	Oh, it was great.
1862193	1862413	Yeah?
1863033	1864194	It was fantastic.
1864474	1865775	We talked about it on Horde House this week.
1865795	1868396	I guess there's a teaser at the end about a Grand Theft Auto Online?
1868816	1871898	Well, it's just what they're calling their online portion of the game.
1871918	1875940	Because there's an online portion to Grand Theft Auto 4, but now they're calling it Grand Theft Auto Online.
1877220	1877841	and it looks great.
1878041	1879381	I mean, it looks really good.
1879802	1897209	Obviously, the screenshots that they've been putting out aren't as the same quality as the gameplay trailer, but that just leads to the rumors that, yeah, they're producing a higher quality asset version of the game so that it can be ported to the PC or next-gen consoles when the time comes.
1897550	1902452	Just so y'all know, Loki told me before the show tonight, you will get Grand Theft Auto V and you will play it.
1902792	1904613	Like, it was not you need to, it was that you will.
1905553	1908195	Well, because you have Grand Theft Auto 4 and you still haven't played it.
1908875	1910557	Alan played it on PC.
1910577	1911637	That's Alan playing it.
1911757	1912978	I'm not talking about Alan.
1912998	1914459	I'm talking about you playing it.
1914679	1922745	Honestly, though, you probably should just skip 4 at this point and just go straight into 5 because it's going to be way better anyways.
1924486	1926208	I don't know, everything looks great about it.
1926648	1933254	The gameplay looks tighter, the combat looks better, the level of detail in the game is just ridiculous.
1934795	1936477	It just looks fun.
1936597	1939199	It looks like a game that I can sink hundreds of hours into.
1940240	1941842	And let's not kid ourselves, you will.
1942502	1942963	I will.
1943683	1946706	That game will cause disagreements between you and the wife.
1947026	1950289	No, no, it won't because it's good because I will.
1950409	1954293	Well, the only problem is going to be getting this scream to play that on.
1955214	1961801	I guess I could play it in the other room, but yeah, I can because, you know, my Xbox 360 has Wi-Fi, so that'll be just fine.
1961841	1962301	There you go.
1962521	1963522	I can play in the other room.
1963602	1964343	Problem solved.
1964603	1965224	Exactly.
1965804	1966125	All right.
1966245	1967206	Anything else for your gaming week?
1968314	1968855	No, not really.
1968875	1969675	I'm just getting ready.
1971096	1974197	I was installing Arma 2 in the expansion, Daisy.
1974597	1983281	Actually, because Gally had sent me a message on Twitter saying that he has a Daisy Breakpoint server.
1984301	1988863	So maybe we could do that in a future VOG game night.
1988943	1992725	Although, for now, I'm just suspending VOG game night because it's hard to get everybody together.
1993505	1996947	It's just to think of games to play.
1997347	1998368	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2018464	2025927	By some miracle, they fixed our Minecraft server long enough for me to download the backup of it.
2026047	2028927	So I made a backup and downloaded the world.
2029007	2030908	So we still have the world intact now.
2031368	2035529	So my plan is when I do eventually get around to actually...
2037990	2039992	Aw, that's just fantastic.
2040032	2041232	Brad, you're awesome.
2042113	2047136	So, Brad from PodCulture sent me a copy of Fallout New Vegas Ultimate Edition.
2047316	2048036	Oh, shut up.
2048357	2048717	Right now?
2048737	2048857	Yeah.
2049017	2050698	That's awesome.
2050818	2051278	Thank you.
2051318	2052439	Brad, you are too good to us.
2052499	2053760	That man sends us booze.
2054260	2055261	He sends us games.
2055741	2056481	Brad, you're the man.
2056862	2057382	He's awesome.
2057422	2059083	And he sends me episodes of Doctor Who.
2060504	2063966	What else does a nerd need besides games, Doctor Who, and booze?
2066586	2067046	Coffee!
2068347	2068788	Coffee.
2069568	2070149	Brad, you rock.
2070209	2071530	Everybody listen to PodCulture.
2072331	2074792	6 o'clock Pacific, Monday nights here at VOG.
2074973	2092586	So anyway, the plan is, what I'm going to do with it once I get around to actually setting up that Minecraft server with mods and stuff, is I'm going to do a multi-world server where you can travel between the server that Gally has set up right now, which I think is a survival server, so I'm going to just leave that alone, and then ours, which is a...
2093647	2097751	Creative servers, so you'll be able to go back and forth between that stuff, and I think it'll be the best of both worlds there.
2098491	2101274	I don't want to ruin the mood, but don't download that while the show's going.
2102255	2103255	No, of course not.
2103976	2104476	Come on, man.
2105177	2105477	Let's see.
2105617	2109541	Oh, going to the chat room, it's almost like it's a list list going on here.
2109641	2114165	What else does a nerd need besides Doctor Who, liquor, and games?
2114705	2116167	SSJ100Matt says, boobs.
2118609	2120673	I'm a gay male and I'm not going to disagree with that.
2121094	2121975	I need boobs too.
2122316	2122736	You know what?
2122777	2123898	Sometimes boobs get in the way.
2126383	2127585	I will co-sign that to the list.
2127845	2129308	Fifth dream says masturbation.
2130888	2154271	No comment Misty says Mountain Dew I don't know Nasty shit Maybe beverage of some type Coffee So a caffeinated beverage of some sort I will let caffeinated beverages go Except Mountain Dew is nasty shit Which by the way Rob I have to say something Speaking of nerd drinks Do you remember a soda called Josta?
2155653	2157234	God, yes, it sounds familiar for some reason.
2173559	2175361	And somebody brought a 15-year-old can of it.
2175461	2176161	Oh, I do remember this.
2176342	2179224	Somebody brought a 15-year-old can of it to California Extreme and you drank it.
2179524	2184508	I found a soda at the Russian market that tastes almost exactly like it.
2184548	2186210	It's a Brazilian Guarana soda.
2187631	2190934	That is the most random thing you've ever said on this show.
2191334	2192415	But Josta was made out of Guarana.
2192435	2193816	Hey, y'all, remember Josta?
2194097	2196519	Well, you can get it at the Russian grocery store.
2196539	2201102	Keep in mind, I used to drink this stuff and watch Sailor Moon marathons.
2202023	2223244	Josta is the official drink of my Sailor Moon marathons so you can stop laughing at me alright so let me just add that to the list Doctor Who, boobs, game, liquor apparently Josta and Sailor Moon are on the list too well I'm glad that the Josta clone or whatever was more important than playing Mass Effect this week
2224335	2230378	Now looking for houses is more... Which, by the way, the other... And by the way, it wasn't Russian, it was Brazilian, but it was a Brazilian soda at a Russian market.
2230538	2243864	By the way, the other comment we got in chat, this is a little bit delayed here, but that the Gaben.tv song, the G-A-B-E-N.tv song, is appropriate for when Dark Sakura announces that she hasn't played Mass Effect for an entire week.
2244624	2246085	Now this is supposed to be for the Steam sale.
2248786	2250187	This is also for you not playing it.
2255336	2256417	Are you ready for a miracle?
2256437	2257698	Are you ready for a miracle?
2276843	2278504	You know, that song is going to play.
2278544	2282365	That's what's going to happen when they play that song on Steam.
2282525	2284165	It's when Half-Life 3 gets announced.
2284426	2288147	That's just going to all of a sudden be like, hey, wait a second, this is from the Steam sale.
2288807	2290388	Oh, whoa, now hold on a second.
2290948	2291688	Something's different.
2292008	2292668	He's not dressed.
2293469	2297070	He's dressed up like a... I want that song played at my 40th birthday.
2299691	2300371	All right, anyhow.
2301405	2302405	I don't know who you people are.
2302505	2302905	I'm leaving.
2302945	2303265	Bye.
2324910	2327473	and listen to VOG on the TuneIn app, which you can do.
2327513	2334641	So if you own an OUYA, I urge you, go get the TuneIn app and check out VOG because we are on TuneIn and you can listen to us through your OUYA.
2336043	2340368	I also played that parking valet simulator, the No Brakes Valet, whatever that's called.
2340448	2341369	That game cracked me up.
2341389	2341830	That was fun.
2343591	2352020	I was playing around with the Twitch TV app, which runs, I gotta say, it runs, no surprise, it's the exact same setup as the mobile Twitch TV, but it runs very well.
2352180	2356604	I wasn't getting any screens that were entirely black, which I get a lot on mobile.
2356624	2360808	I was getting a lot of good-looking feeds on Twitch TV, so that was pretty awesome.
2361369	2361749	I like that.
2363110	2365412	Also, as far as other games go, thank you Steam Sale.
2365753	2370858	I bought Scribblenauts Unlimited for $5 and I've been having fun with that.
2372920	2380869	Scribblenauts, of course, is a puzzle game of sorts where you can type whatever object that comes to mind to help you solve the puzzle.
2381729	2396381	for example I was in a museum level and I had to put things on the paintings that the people looking at them would appreciate so for example there might be a caveman so one thing that he might appreciate a campfire so you put in campfire and you put it in there
2396741	2403228	Scribblenauts Unlimited allows you to use the descriptive text so like you get an adjective, right?
2403548	2418603	Like a red balloon or a red whatever or like I think I had a mission where the guy was going to go pick a girl up on a date and needed a cool ride so I said pink SUV and I got credit for it.
2418623	2419865	You should have done DeLorean.
2420385	2421546	Now here's, yeah, that's true.
2421886	2431332	Here's the only, like, the only negative I can think of for Scribblenauts Unlimited is it's basically like a, it's more of a word puzzle than it is platformer puzzle, at least in the early levels.
2431432	2444740	Now granted, I'm still early on, I probably have like 16 stars total, so I'm not like super far into the game, but I've played it for an hour or two, and I imagine the puzzles get more complicated later on, and maybe there's not so much maybe platforming
2445060	2446641	DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2472018	2472999	That's what Cthulhu does.
2473039	2473720	He's an Elder God.
2473980	2474301	Alright.
2474841	2475722	So, yeah.
2476043	2476743	It's a cute game.
2477825	2480588	You know, it's kind of an elaborate word puzzler.
2480988	2485954	The first few levels you're going to be like kind of tapping your fingers on the desk like, okay, this is pretty easy.
2486875	2488778	I know what I'm going to do when I get to that level.
2488998	2489198	What?
2489659	2490399	Little Red Corvette.
2491821	2511509	and if it's driven by Prince it'll be even better I haven't really seen a sandbox stage I mean I guess you can always go back to the farm level and do whatever you want there but I was kind of surprised that like there isn't like well the first Scribblenauts game it was just a mode that you just go in the sandbox yeah I didn't I haven't really seen that in this so but anyway it was five bucks amazing
2512749	2539662	Actdeft in chat says I summoned Cthulhu for a monster party you do see some funny stuff like in I think it was in the diner level in the basement there's some monsters that are dancing around and they want another person to dance with them so I summoned scary unicorn and it was a unicorn with a mask on that was scary it is really cool how the game really can translate like whatever you type into items and you can even build your own items which is pretty cool and edit stuff so yeah I was uh
2540442	2566984	I was I there's there's still a lot of fun to be had in it even if the game itself is is pretty simple um otherwise other games I've been playing not a lot of new stuff uh still the Final Fantasy 14 beta which beta 3 finally ends this weekend okay here's how much I've played the Final Fantasy 14 beta you guys I actually got to the point where it said well that's all the story we have in the beta you have completed everything in the beta
2568613	2569233	Go home!
2569353	2573095	I got to that point in the story where it's like, look forward to the release of the game.
2573335	2574056	You beat the beta.
2574996	2577697	And even then, Shane's like, well, you could still go get your Chocobo.
2577717	2578618	You're not really done yet.
2578638	2579398	Go get your Chocobo.
2579418	2580859	We got more instances to run.
2582740	2584100	I didn't play it all this weekend, Rob.
2584200	2584440	Yeah?
2584521	2588182	Because I was... I think a lot of people are just kind of waiting for the release now.
2588302	2591084	I had to save up the money so I can buy it.
2591284	2596246	And also, they're going to nuke everybody pretty soon anyway, so it's like, eh, why am I going to waste that time?
2596486	2597807	But beta 4 should be in about...
2598827	2607754	3 weeks or so and that supposedly is going to have the voice acting in the story quests and some other stuff too, it'll have more of the game oh there's voice acting in the game?
2607774	2617821	for the main story quests there's going to be voice acting yeah I didn't know that until I read it I think on Reddit and it was out of a producer interview or something like that so I don't question its legitimacy
2619596	2621637	I'm loving Realm Reborn.
2622257	2624818	It's such good fan service.
2624878	2626800	It's just so well done.
2627440	2630201	The first game, we don't acknowledge that anymore.
2630221	2631662	This is really what it should have been the whole time.
2631702	2634044	This is what people want out of a Final Fantasy MMO, I think.
2634584	2641808	Some XI purists would probably argue with me on that, but I really think there's a lot of people that are going to be very happy with what Realm Reborn is doing.
2641828	2644630	I want, out of an MMO, Final Fantasy XI to go free-to-play.
2644650	2645290	Yeah.
2646608	2650837	WhatUpG in chat asks, how many hours did you put in, Sky?
2651378	2652360	I lost count.
2652420	2653422	Is there a slash played?
2653442	2654564	Easily 20.
2654785	2655145	Easily.
2658106	2658786	Probably more.
2659727	2663888	And I'm not just talking this weekend, I'm talking kind of comprehensive across the beta, but it's probably more.
2664729	2671312	SSJ100Matt says, Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn on max graphics settings is amazing.
2671412	2672672	Soundtrack is great too.
2672792	2675693	Oh yeah, the soundtrack is phenomenal.
2676294	2681636	I mean, to be fair, the soundtrack was actually pretty good in 1.0, but a good soundtrack won't save a shitty game.
2681996	2686498	So it's great that now there's this nice game that the soundtrack complements very well.
2687669	2688450	Thanks for watching!
2706171	2707472	That was really it for my gaming week.
2707552	2708552	Oh, the Mii Plaza games.
2709253	2710153	I played those quickly.
2710193	2712134	I'll just say a couple of those I checked out.
2712794	2723459	There is a space shooter type game where your Miis that you collect by street passing, the color of their shirts determines the weapons that you can place on your ship.
2723800	2730263	So you can have a red shirt as a flamethrower, a blue shirt as a homing missile, and then it's a little space shooter game.
2730283	2732644	So it's an awesome little addition to Mii Plaza.
2733284	2738669	Bummer that they cost money, but they're decent games for, you know, what is it, $15 for the bundle?
2739390	2740231	For four games?
2740491	2741452	It's a nice little expansion.
2742233	2743774	So, great.

2753925	2755526	All right, that's it for our gaming weeks.
2755686	2758749	So we can get into gaming news, but quickly I'm just going to say housekeeping.
2759069	2763752	Don't forget to add us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and follow us on Facebook as well.
2763833	2766675	Be our friend, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2767035	2768216	We're also on Google+.
2769016	2773500	All the places you can connect with us are located at our website, orangeloungeradio.com.
2773840	2773920	Nope.
2796812	2801978	The only way that I would get into that is if it was conveniently timed with a game that I'm playing.
2801998	2805602	Because I'm not going to really play a game, although I did for Super Meat Boy.
2805642	2806323	I did play the game.
2806503	2809867	And you gave me your cards, so I'm more than happy with the way it turned out.
2809907	2810808	And you know what, though?
2810928	2814412	I'm glad that I did, because Super Meat Boy was an excellent game, and I do like it.
2815073	2815734	It's, you know...
2815894	2817515	It's a great way to revisit games.
2818235	2828759	I didn't talk about it during my gaming week, but not only did I play Scribblenauts, I played Really Big Sky, I played Super Meat Boy, I played Magicka, I played... What else did I play to get cards out of?
2828799	2829579	There's something else, too.
2829619	2833941	I mean, there's all these games I'm collecting cards in, and it forces me to go back and play the games again.
2834341	2834541	Yeah.
2835282	2836322	So, anyways.
2837442	2837543	Um...
2838963	2842126	Alright, so how popular are these next-gen systems going to be?
2842206	2844128	I mean, I think they're going to be very popular.
2844228	2851615	And if anything, we should learn from these pre-orders that they are so popular that they're selling out of their allotments.
2851715	2856239	So yes, like any other console launch, they're going to be hard to find at launch.
2857360	2858281	So, for example...
2858701	2870917	GameStop, they've stopped taking pre-orders for the PlayStation 4 and they are also running short, I guess, on Xbox One systems, the Day 1 edition.
2872318	2872458	Um...
2873780	2883426	I guess, well, right now they are still selling some of the Xbox One bundles, but a lot of them are gone.
2883626	2885107	So they are almost out of those.
2885667	2886908	Also, Amazon.
2887208	2893072	They have stopped taking pre-orders for the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 launch bundles as well.
2893872	2894212	So...
2895413	2902780	Yeah, probably the demand's been just very high for these things, so that's gotta be a good sign, unlike the Wii U.
2906144	2906464	I don't know.
2906644	2907265	We'll have to see.
2907325	2916489	I remember there's still that rumor that they were having some problems making the problems with the yields from the chips for the Xbox One.
2916549	2920231	So that could possibly lead to some shortages there.
2920611	2921972	We'll see if there's anything to that.
2922472	2927594	But either way, it should be a very successful launch as far as console numbers go.
2928515	2931016	SSJ100 Matt says, of course there's going to be shortage.
2931036	2932957	Going to drive up demand as much as possible.
2934948	2939150	Um, yes, but I mean, honestly, I don't think they try to do it on purpose.
2939611	2943613	I mean, granted, that's a wonderful side effect of, you know, the console being popular.
2944593	2951397	Unlike, you know, I seriously think with the Wii and the Wii U or whatever, that they were shortening that stuff on purpose.
2952438	2960502	At least the Wii U, because I remember they were saying, oh, it's so impossible to find, and yet it was just sitting on shelves, like all these different places.
2961743	2963924	So I just kind of wonder about that stuff, but...
2964500	2964840	I don't know.
2965301	2980050	Once again, they're going to have to sell a lot of units to get the third-party support because if it's just not there, if they're not selling any units, then they're not going to sell games and they're going to lose support.
2980070	2983553	They're going to develop for systems that have the numbers.
2983833	2984974	What systems would be left?
2985134	2986014	The 360 and PS3?
2986235	2987315	You'd be surprised, yeah.
2987475	2989277	They would just develop for current-gen stuff.
2990537	2991397	Let's see in our chat room.
2991437	2995119	WhatUpG says, I think they are putting out more PlayStation 4 than Xbox One.
2995819	3001280	Dungeon Buster says, in Microsoft's case, it could also be a continuing problem with silicon yields for their new CPU.
3002001	3004581	Alan Alchemy says, it's only on purpose when Nintendo does it.
3005762	3006942	Live.VogNetwork.com.
3007924	3008924	Well, okay.
3009304	3014745	Here's why, and this is kind of going back to, how long were there shortages on the Wii?
3015166	3016326	Like, over a year.
3016586	3017766	That's ridiculous.
3017986	3029268	I mean, even with the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3, there were shortages for maybe six months when they were catching up on the demand and stuff, but then they were able to keep up with it.
3029429	3033469	But the Wii, it was hard to find just forever.
3033769	3035310	It was ridiculous.
3036110	3036270	And...
3037901	3041471	You know, seeing the day to day operation of how Nintendo works.
3043140	3050806	They do allocate a lot of stuff where they kind of hold back things that they could possibly sell and place them in certain places.
3050886	3061234	For example, there may be shortages for some retailers, but other retailers are getting product because they're filling the demand there first and shorting everybody else.
3061294	3067999	Or they're holding back because they don't want any extra units sitting on the shelves to make it seem like the system is selling out.
3068519	3069440	Thank you for watching!
3090275	3093159	Uh, way too early to still call a victor this year though, right?
3093239	3094200	Anything can still happen.
3094681	3106435	Yeah, I'm, all I'm gonna say is Nintendo has got their work cut out for them to really sell those consoles because they're, you know, betting that these first party titles are gonna sell consoles and, and,
3107015	3107516	Don't get me wrong.
3107536	3109518	I mean, Nintendo Mario games are great.
3109718	3112000	They do remain the cheapest option on the table.
3112040	3113261	They are the cheapest option.
3113281	3120569	Oh, speaking of cheap options, actually, I was going to say there is a PlayStation 3 SKU coming out next month for $199.
3122170	3122410	What?
3122731	3123872	Yeah.
3124092	3125653	Oh, PlayStation 3, wow.
3125813	3126234	PlayStation 3.
3126274	3127795	That's still, wow, that's great.
3128576	3130177	However, the hard drive is really small.
3130217	3131198	It's a 12-gig hard drive.
3131218	3132679	They had it in Europe right now.
3132779	3133400	They were selling it.
3133740	3138404	But a 12-gig hard drive for $199, that's still pretty cheap.
3138684	3147572	And, I mean, granted, those hard drives are replaceable, and you can get a cheap hard drive, so it might be an easy way to get in if you want a PlayStation 3 system.
3149013	3150015	So, there's that.
3150295	3152218	I mean, that might go through the holidays as well.
3152238	3152858	That'll help out.
3153219	3157444	But yeah, I mean, seriously, I hope that that Mario game does really well for them.
3157504	3160468	I hope that Mario game and Zelda and stuff really does sell systems for them.
3160488	3165034	Because if it doesn't, I don't know what more they can do.
3165074	3166336	I mean, Mario Kart will be good, but...
3167938	3171660	They may be in the shitter for another year.
3172981	3174522	Well, I don't think they're just going to stop.
3174622	3178464	Nintendo themselves will not stop supporting Wii U. No, I understand.
3178504	3182226	You'll still see games that people are going to want on that for the next couple years.
3182506	3193372	It's just, you know, it may not be the powerhouse that the Wii was without all the other third-party support, but, I mean, Nintendo will still make games for their own system while they work on the successor.
3194233	3196274	And a lot of games are, you know, Nintendo...
3196914	3200196	People that buy Nintendo systems a lot of times buy it for Nintendo games.
3200556	3208661	It's not a huge loss, but it does affect if you want to buy a system or if you're contemplating buying another system.
3209302	3210522	Let's consider it next-gen.
3210562	3214325	I still don't consider the Wii U next-gen because of the hardware and stuff.
3215525	3223250	If you're considering a next-gen system and you're looking at all the games that are coming out that I want to play and the Wii U is missing a lot of them,
3225041	3240126	you just might not buy the system and by the way just because I say Nintendo working on a successor I don't mean like they're hurrying a successor but it's very common that the research and development of these systems is years in advance PlayStation 5 is probably already being worked on
3240646	3243849	very, very, very slowly in its early planning stages.
3244049	3255498	If the roadmaps are to be believed, the one that leaked out for the Xbox system and the Kinect and the VR stuff, Microsoft's working on some VR stuff.
3256519	3256899	We'll see.
3257079	3259001	Next year is apparently when that's supposed to come out.
3259121	3259501	We'll see.
3260522	3261703	Alright, moving on.
3262223	3270968	Speaking of Microsoft, apparently, as Bobby likes to call them, the Microsoft space bucks, the Microsoft points, they're being phased out.
3271028	3273889	Now, we kind of knew that that was going to be happening at some point.
3273909	3280273	I believe that came up during E3, but it is actually now kind of dated when that's all going to go down.
3281213	3285435	The Xbox Live rewards will be doing away with these bonuses as of August 1st.
3287877	3289357	XBOX Live Rewards Program
3308789	3315734	Apparently some problems right now in the new dashboard build that's being previewed that's going to roll out in the fall.
3316274	3322939	And I guess some problems there about some negative exchange rates and some that are too favorable.
3323739	3327262	Incorrect game title pricing in wrong regions and so forth.
3327582	3332185	But, you know, it is a beta, so you can't exactly sit there and go, Microsoft, you suck.
3332225	3335087	I mean, that's what you get when you sign up for a beta is that things are going to...
3335327	3336731	We can still say they suck.
3337533	3339618	We just can't say that that sucks.
3339959	3341663	I don't understand how they can't, like,
3343772	3347393	Are you telling me that Microsoft is confused on how their space bucks work?
3347693	3354054	I mean, granted, I know it's easy for the North American stuff where it's like 80 points equals a dollar.
3354394	3358175	But in other regions, I'm sure it's X amount of points equals whatever.
3358535	3362516	With so much crap in the marketplace, though, I'm sure it's a database conversion issue.
3363076	3366716	Like it's one wrong little line of code that fucks everything up.
3366796	3368237	I'm sure it's something that simple.
3368297	3368837	It's got to be.
3369597	3377482	So, uh, don't know yet exactly when the points will move into dollars, but it's gonna be before, probably this same September timeframe.
3377502	3378263	And the 20 points thing?
3378283	3379123	Uh-huh.
3379143	3380024	Before on your birthday?
3380044	3382045	I don't even think I got that.
3382125	3383907	Who, who, who even cares?
3383967	3386048	That is just so ridiculously stupid.
3386108	3387149	What can you buy with 20 points?
3387169	3392572	There was, uh, someone, I think it was... I think it was, um, uh...
3393773	3397317	and Flaco Jones who said, you know, hey, I got 20 points on my birthday.
3397397	3399179	And I'm like, don't spend it all in one place.
3400380	3403703	How can you not spend it all in one place?
3403723	3404764	There's only 20 points.
3405745	3406286	Jeez.
3407267	3407527	All right.
3407908	3408408	Let's move on.
3408448	3408909	DarkSakura.
3410146	3410927	Let's see.
3411808	3421516	Well, you know how we've talked about the poor sales of the Wii U are probably going to start affecting third-party markets as far as what gets developed for them?
3422317	3427902	Well, it looks like Ubisoft has come out and said that they're not doing a sequel to Zombie U just for that reason.
3428422	3436265	That basically the Wii U hasn't sold enough and the game itself, Zombie U, hasn't sold enough.
3436865	3442187	So even though they have a prototype of a sequel, they are not going to pursue development.
3442668	3444628	There will be no Zombie U 2.
3446389	3448890	No Zombie The Edge, no Zombie Bono.
3450189	3454794	It's probably going to be called something else, be my guess.
3454934	3459178	And it's going to be multi-platform because that's why they can't, they know.
3459418	3464544	And that's sad too because Zombie U is probably one of the most successful third-party games they had at launch.
3465404	3467066	I was really surprised by this news.
3467987	3468868	It was that bad.
3468988	3469268	Zombi-me.
3469288	3469808	Zombi-us.
3497802	3498663	Zombie1!
3501084	3507408	I was surprised to hear that it was that bad, but it also kind of shed some light on why they pulled the plug on the Rayman thing so fast.
3507428	3508409	It's exactly the same reason.
3508669	3508929	Yeah.
3509650	3513272	I mean, because we didn't know this then, and we were kind of like, Ubisoft's just being dicks.
3513673	3517375	You know, but I guess financially, that's what it is.
3517795	3521037	Oh, yeah, well.
3521057	3525981	It's the one time that Mr. Negative over there, Norman Negative, is right.
3526001	3526181	Yeah.
3527904	3528565	Alright, anyhow.
3529406	3529966	What else we got?
3530467	3530827	Next up.
3530967	3532589	Ha ha ha ha, Beatrageinator.
3533149	3533389	Huh?
3533469	3535311	To my really awful U2 joke.
3535491	3536232	Beat him with your shoe?
3538414	3539035	Zombie Bono.
3539856	3548924	So, you know, one of the things that PlayStation 4 was going to allow developers to do is self-publish on the PlayStation Network.
3549565	3552047	And, you know, basically their thought is, you know,
3553208	3559269	We're going to treat every single individual developer as a publisher as far as we're concerned.
3559629	3563810	And we don't separate, we don't segregate indies from traditional publishers.
3564490	3566551	Which I think is a fantastic thing.
3566591	3572792	I think it's awesome that you see these indie games next to big budget games and stuff.
3574772	3580534	Honestly, it's kind of refreshing compared to the stuff that was happening with the Xbox indie games.
3581154	3581934	Where it's just like...
3582634	3583535	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3601226	3604508	I'm hoping that that also carries on over to the Vita as well because the Vita could always use more games.
3619235	3620875	XBOX ONE XBOX ONE
3640060	3646882	I think Microsoft's strategy with the Xbox One, or not even really with the Xbox because now they're kind of treating all their platforms as one platform.
3647502	3659385	I think the problem is they know that people want to develop games for the Xbox One, but they also know they have a lack of application support on Windows 8.
3660325	3666268	So, their end is going to be basically, hey, develop games for the Windows 8 platform, and guess what?
3666308	3673071	Because we have that kernel running on, you know, or that version of the firmware, whatever, however you're going to split it up.
3673312	3675052	We have that running on the Xbox One.
3675093	3678574	Your games will be able to be ported over to the Xbox One very easily.
3679014	3681116	That's how they're going to win on both platforms, because...
3682196	3686600	They want to sell those operating systems because that's where they're probably going to make a lot of money.
3686940	3692285	At the same time, they also want to have stuff on their console.
3692325	3695908	I just think that's what they're going to try to do is try to get people almost like...
3697714	3703899	Trick them into making games for the Microsoft platform, I guess.
3706502	3716150	ShadowNextGen in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, You have to worry about whether PlayStation Network on PS4 will turn into the App Store, though.
3716770	3717631	That's a good point.
3717751	3720854	I mean, the App Store has a lot of crap on it, like a lot of crap.
3722215	3724297	Like, how many fart apps do we need, right?
3725083	3726764	Flashlight apps, really.
3727225	3727945	Yeah, exactly.
3728906	3730587	I don't think it's going to happen that way, though.
3730767	3742316	Because even right now with the way PlayStation Network's indie games are, it's easier for them to get on, but I don't think it's like they can just throw games up there like you can on the indie store and stuff.
3743477	3743817	I don't know.
3744217	3745298	It'll be interesting to see how they do it.
3763344	3768368	All it was was pictures of Pokemon, but people legit thought it was like Nintendo's Pokemon on the App Store.
3768828	3771410	And people were downloading it like crazy and losing money on it.
3772010	3775373	I think that they'll probably have some sort of review process in there.
3775573	3775793	Yeah.
3775813	3777534	You know...
3779095	3781456	They'll probably just, they have just a fun and happy medium.
3781576	3785277	I mean, you can't just make it super duper easy to put stuff on there.
3785397	3787298	I mean, look at, like, for example, the Ouya.
3787398	3793380	There's a perfect example of how you can self-publish on there, but there's not a ton of stuff on there.
3793460	3795381	That store's a mess, too, I gotta say.
3795421	3798202	Okay, well, that store has been a mess since launch, especially with their...
3798542	3801524	Like fucked up like menus and stuff.
3801544	3804146	The way to navigate that is it's not very well.
3804226	3810330	And like, you know, you look at like all the different bars that feature things like every single one of them has got the same games in it, just in a different order.
3811010	3814973	It's like the Wii U store when it first launched or not too much different now.
3815782	3830877	Yeah, so it's just kind of weird, but they do have it where you can easily publish stuff on there, but I think it's just some sort of quality sorting and stuff and just better ways to search for what you're actually looking for.
3832665	3840708	All right, well, you know, THQ had some problems last year and they went bankrupt and, you know, a lot of their properties went to all these different places.
3840808	3844930	Hence why, you know, we have Deep Silver doing Saints Row now and so forth.
3845330	3854894	But Sega, apparently not happy with the way things went down because they filed a claim against THQ and bankruptcy court, of course, because THQ is bankrupt.
3855694	3879090	for almost a million dollars just shy of that about $941,000 that apparently is the amount that THQ received in pre-orders after Valve's cut for Company of Heroes 2 apparently Eurogamer had also reported that about a half million was made after THQ filed for bankruptcy so Sega wants to get that money back that came in from pre-orders for Company of Heroes 2
3880570	3903043	Double Fine, Codemasters, and other former THQ executives also looking for the money that they're supposed to be getting this doesn't mean any of them will get anything I imagine this is part of the process filing the claim so you can ultimately later on claim it as a loss when it comes to tax season later on but it's interesting that this THQ drama still goes on
3904003	3910128	By the way, the reason why Sega wants the money is because they got Relic, the developer, and the Company of Heroes property.
3910529	3914692	They bought that for $26.6 million at the THQ asset auction.
3916734	3917655	That's what's going down.
3917715	3918736	Sega wants their money.
3919937	3921738	They want to buy their building back from Zynga.
3923240	3923520	I wish.
3924926	3929248	You know, they say, if we had a million dollars, we could make Dreamcast 2.
3930269	3935231	If I had a million dollars, maybe Sonic 4 wouldn't suck.
3937012	3941314	You know, it's funny the difference between what a million dollars is to you 10 years ago versus now.
3941374	3941614	Right.
3942695	3942975	Anyhow.
3943055	3944116	Now I'm like, house!
3944656	3945416	I can buy a house!
3947157	3947778	League of Legends
3962695	3979679	It is now been considered, and this is a quote coming from Riot Games esports manager Nick Allen, said the United States government recognizes League of Legends pro players as professional athletes and awards visas to essentially work in the United States under that title.
3980939	3989421	So yeah, it is officially an esports and the pro players are ethletes, as I'm calling them.
3989441	3991802	That's my new word and you have to give credit to me, ethlete.
3992543	3993104	Do you suck at croquet?
4019651	4020592	Yes, actually I do.
4020712	4025653	You know, I cannot play croquet without singing Que Sera Sera to myself because of Heathers.
4026673	4028114	I'm pretty good at miniature golf.
4029114	4031415	So am I. My husband's really good at it.
4031435	4031935	Is that a sport?
4031975	4032875	Is mini golf a sport?
4032895	4034136	It is officially in my universe.
4034336	4035196	Okay, well that's all I need.
4035216	4040738	Well, I've been talking about forming the Island of Awesome, and I think the national sport of the Island of Awesome should be mini golf.
4041204	4051068	I honestly think that they should make mini golf courses the size of actual golf courses and televise that shit because I want to see someone doing a drive off of a giant loop-de-loop and all sorts of crazy stuff.
4051108	4054790	It could be right there with Dodgeball and League of Legends on the Ocho.
4056753	4057674	It's been 8, the 8th
4080054	4084216	We're going to have Blizzard, All Stars, Valve has Dota 2.
4084276	4085116	Isn't there another one?
4085136	4086357	There's another one I'm not thinking of.
4086397	4087397	There's another smaller one.
4087778	4094581	Because, you know, all those guys that contributed to the original Defense of the Ancients mod in Warcraft 3 all went their own separate ways.
4094641	4096802	So you got all these games because of it.
4097722	4099123	Is Dota 2 going to be a sport?
4099743	4100663	Or what happens next?
4101504	4103085	How do you guys feel about... I still think we want Pro DDR.
4104261	4106342	How do you guys feel about... But DDR's dead, yo.
4106362	4107082	Haven't you got the memo?
4107182	4109684	No, it's not.
4109764	4112125	DDR... It's like the disco boys in Mystery Men.
4112165	4112645	Eddie Izzard.
4113306	4114086	DDR's life.
4115447	4116027	No, it's death.
4116587	4118208	Yeah, after we're done playing.
4120489	4121970	You can sweat playing chess.
4145263	4145804	In a hot room.
4146224	4147505	I mean, I don't know.
4148686	4149107	Whatever.
4149127	4149847	I mean, fine.
4151469	4154992	But those people are... You're not going to see it in the fucking Olympics, okay?
4155513	4156453	It's just not going to happen.
4157174	4158956	And don't even try to petition that shit.
4159196	4161158	TigerClaw says it's called eSports.
4161758	4162719	It's like new sports.
4162959	4164641	Will we have the Olympics?
4165702	4166743	That would be actually kind of cool.
4167607	4177957	Actdeft in chat says, how about stuff like Evo?
4177997	4179198	Well, that's all going on right now.
4179298	4181360	Like, that's a huge Olympics type of thing.
4181400	4182421	That's only for fighting games.
4183001	4187125	But still, I mean, getting quite a bit of viewership and controversy of its own online.
4187445	4188626	So we'll get into later in the show.
4189307	4189467	So...
4190333	4191955	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4213722	4217787	Infinal in our chatroom says, Next, Mario and Sonic at the Olympics will be an eSport.
4218047	4218909	That's very meta.
4218949	4219690	I like that idea.
4220130	4220531	We'll see.
4221332	4221652	All right.
4222353	4224215	Moving on to release dates.
4224255	4228861	We're going to travel around the world and check out what games are coming out that could be a sport in a few years.
4228901	4229442	We'll see, Loki.
4229827	4238774	Well, I don't know about any of the games you're going to support this week, but... Because, like, for example, there's Turbo Super Stunt Squad, which is a game based on the... Is it TurboTastic?
4240335	4240816	Probably not.
4241236	4249322	It's based on that DreamWorks movie about the snail that somehow ingests NOS and so becomes, like, a super fast snail.
4250003	4251464	Because, you know, that's science right there.
4252865	4255407	So they have that coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360...
4256848	4259531	Wii, Wii U, 3DS, and DS.
4259812	4269823	Also this week, your ever-yearly multi-release version of you versus a bunch of other feudal Japan warriors.
4270163	4275730	Dynasty Warriors 8 coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.
4278072	4281796	Also this week, Time and Eternity on PlayStation 3.
4284778	4288041	Let's see, the Serious Sam Collection being released on Xbox 360.
4288081	4290904	There's a bunch of Xbox Live Arcade games that were on there.
4292065	4295128	I want to say, I think that might be it.
4296029	4296930	Am I missing something?
4300312	4300813	And that's it.
4300993	4302214	Let me move to Japan then.
4303075	4303796	Bye, Rob.
4304697	4304997	Bye.
4305037	4305798	Bye, I'm moving.
4306238	4308380	Alright, moving to the Japanese release dates.

4403587	4406049	DJ Ranma S doesn't try and import one of these.
4433563	4433883	We'll see.
4434903	4435384	Maybe he will.
4436364	4445950	Also on the 3DS this week, Shin Sekaiju no Mikyu Design Skins.
4446290	4447070	Those aren't even games.
4447110	4448591	Those are just little skins for the 3DS.
4449592	4454855	Osahari Hamster 2 Korosau Isho ni Orokake comes out this week.
4456295	4457215	Do something together.
4458756	4460196	Play with adorable hamsters.
4460476	4461457	Oh my gosh, it's hamster sim.
4461477	4462497	Maybe it's let's play together.
4462777	4463997	Oh my god, the box.
4464337	4465177	This is adorable.
4465237	4466378	Why do we get games like this here?
4466898	4468478	They're on a sunflower.
4468498	4470619	The hamsters are sitting on a sunflower.
4470639	4471399	Wearing bows.
4471659	4472919	One is wearing a tiara.
4472999	4474460	And then you look at the game shots.
4475180	4489967	and like they're playing in this like cherry blossom field with a little hamster wheel and then there's one underwater here and then here's one with the hamsters they're just chilling at the beach this little chief hamster there sitting in a lounge chair just chilling at the beach
4490327	4491348	That's not realistic at all.
4491428	4496791	First off, if they were in that field of flowers... Well, they're not going to have Richard Gere's asshole as a level, Loki.
4496811	4497532	No, I understand that.
4497552	4499133	I'm not saying that they do that.
4499153	4500974	They'd be like running from owls level.
4501014	4506538	I'm just saying that they would just need to be there, and they would just shove in their face full of food, because that's all hamsters do, is shove in their face full of food.
4507238	4511741	They throw their poop, actually, because they like to keep their cage clean, so they huck it like footballs.
4511921	4513142	And they pee on you when they're nervous.
4514548	4514788	Yes.
4517891	4521914	Ranma is pointing out that he's not interested in this 3DS XL because it's region locked.
4522314	4523375	Well, you know what?
4523455	4532662	We need to find a way to un-region lock Osahara Hamster to Koraso Isho ni Odakake because, again, here's the game.
4532882	4535104	I think it says, like, let's play together.
4536235	4538497	Here's a game that we need in America.
4538657	4540099	Why don't we have this game in America?
4540539	4547105	And Nintendo's fascist state 3DS will not allow me to import this game.
4547125	4548926	This is a challenge to all our listeners now.
4549046	4552650	If you have a hamster, I want you to put a bow on it and send me a picture.
4552670	4554451	But keep the hamster's... Oh my God, don't harm the hamster.
4554471	4557194	Don't glue it to the hamster's head, you know, like... Or what do they do?
4557254	4559496	Staple it to the hamster's... Safety first.
4559576	4560276	In Scrooged?
4560296	4561958	That would be this great.
4562478	4566720	But, like, I want to see... Or you can Photoshop a tiara onto your hamster.
4567420	4569261	I want to see your glammed-up hamsters.
4570142	4571642	Photoshop DarkSakura's face.
4571863	4572843	Photoshop DarkSakura's face.
4572883	4574024	Glamsters, yes.
4574104	4574544	That's it.
4574944	4576285	That's the game that we need, Rob.
4576325	4576665	Oh, my God.
4576705	4577525	Is that a dream game?
4577585	4578586	OLR dream game.
4579166	4579646	Glamsters.
4579666	4580407	Glamsters.
4581947	4582588	Hold on.
4582768	4583268	Hold on.
4583308	4583788	Okay, yes.
4583888	4585229	There have been games...
4585689	4586609	by Activision.
4586870	4590931	There's actually, I believe, like a Pets Hamsters with a Z in there.
4591151	4594752	And they have had games where it's Pets fashion where you actually do dress up.
4594933	4596413	It is not that cute.
4596473	4597554	I beg to differ, Loki.
4597574	4598974	There's also a Hamtaro game.
4600074	4606577	But not like little CG actual looking hamsters that are adorable that wear bows and tiaras and go to the beach.
4607688	4612934	I want Photoshop of a hamster with a crown on a beach chair.
4613795	4614495	That's my challenge.
4614516	4616097	I mean, I could do it myself, but I'm lazy.
4616277	4623005	We're just going to... No, this is a whole President Cat thing going on here because who made this?
4623245	4623886	Who made this?
4623906	4624807	We need to start harassing them.
4624827	4625828	Nipong Columbia, yes.
4625928	4627470	I want their Twitter harassed.
4627990	4630792	and we're going to call this game Glamsters is the U.S.
4630812	4632133	localization title.
4632813	4634074	And I want Glamsters.
4634455	4635816	I don't even know what it translates to.
4635876	4636356	Who cares?
4636416	4637176	It's Glamsters.
4637997	4640199	And I want Glamsters in the U.S.
4640339	4644081	Rob, the name is essentially playing with hamsters or playing together with hamsters.
4647083	4647764	Glamsters.
4650306	4650746	Who made this?
4650826	4651787	Nippon Columbia.
4652447	4653108	What's their Twitter?
4654188	4655309	Oil Army, get to work.
4655689	4656470	Bring me a Twitter.
4656490	4656630	Twitter.
4659540	4661821	On the 14th, which is what today?
4690515	4690995	Isn't it now?
4691095	4691316	Yeah.
4691956	4693677	Mega Man Unlimited for PC.
4694257	4698200	On the 16th, Momotokun Curse on PlayStation 3.
4698960	4700721	On the 18th, Plants vs. Zombies 2.
4700781	4701682	It's about time.
4703143	4704063	And that wasn't me saying that.
4704083	4704924	That's actually the title.
4706044	4706605	And guess what?
4707865	4708326	I'm spent.
4709607	4711648	I'm surprised Mega Man Unlimited was listed on there.
4711668	4712688	I think that's a fan game.
4712748	4713529	I think it's a fan game.
4713589	4714630	I'm kind of surprised that's on there.
4716030	4717871	Well, it's on there, so good for them.
4718472	4718632	Yeah.
4719264	4721366	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4744948	4757740	As a precautionary measure, they basically said that credit card information was not stored on the server, and they weren't sure what was taken during the breach, or if anything.
4758501	4764326	But basically, all the stored passwords were encrypted, and they're saying it's very unlikely anything can be done with the passwords.
4764446	4768510	But they've reset them, so you've got to make a new one anyways.
4768630	4768950	There you go.
4770232	4774435	And Konami has also been hacked as well.
4774475	4783943	Konami's ID portal website had a large batch of unauthorized logins, I guess, during the month of June.
4784843	4791509	And basically saying that it's exposed some customer information and they recommend changing your passports.
4792529	4792810	So...
4794531	4804784	Yeah, and apparently also the information that may have been exposed, customer names, addresses, dates of birth, telephone numbers, email addresses, and that's it.
4805965	4806586	Change your passwords.
4809449	4810230	Hackers gonna hack.
4811532	4811672	Yep.
4813152	4820457	I hope your password that you used on these websites was not the same that you used on your bank website because that would have been a really bad idea.
4821378	4825040	That's why these things get hacked for people that use the same password everywhere.
4827422	4831744	Well, maybe you'll see Glamsters on the show floor at Tokyo Game Show.
4831785	4836127	Actually, you won't because it's already out in Japan, but we can still dream it will still show up at Tokyo Game Show.
4836728	4840510	Tokyo Game Show had its list of exhibitors announced this week.
4840871	4842251	When is Tokyo Game Show?
4842312	4842872	October-ish?
4843453	4844937	It's usually September.
4845077	4845819	Yeah, it is September.
4847142	4851734	The Exhibitor list is out and Microsoft's on it, which is a bit of a surprise because the Xbox One...
4852810	4853950	Why are you laughing over there?
4853970	4861072	Hey, we got all these cool things to show you that we're not releasing this year because the Xbox One's not coming to your region because you're second tier.
4861313	4864794	Xbox One coming to the second tier country of Japan.
4866334	4875157	Sorry, I don't say that to be offensive, but the reality is that since Japan didn't support the first Xbox... Do they have cosplay at Tokyo Game Show?
4875657	4875917	Yes.
4876037	4876337	Oh, yeah.
4876457	4879318	Good, someone can cosplay at Tumbleweed and maybe roll through the booth.
4880816	4881757	You're such an ass.
4885219	4888401	Microsoft also going to be going to Gamescom if anyone's keeping track of that.
4888761	4889962	But yeah, it'll be interesting.
4890102	4898387	Also, folks at Tokyo Game Show, Sony, Capcom, EA, Sega, Squeenix, Konami, Namco Bandai, Tecmo Koei, Bethesda.
4899087	4900688	All those folks are going to be at Tokyo Game Show.
4900728	4901489	Guess who's not there?
4902049	4902910	Because they're never there.
4903630	4904050	Nintendo.
4904070	4904971	Nintendo will not be there.
4905551	4906891	But they never do Tokyo Game Show.
4907412	4909212	They usually do their own thing that same week.
4910033	4911573	Because they're Nintendo and that's what they do.
4914134	4920557	Brad from PodCulture in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com with a comment on the hacking article saying it is Konami's own fault they were hacked.
4920877	4923938	Their code was up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.
4925739	4929300	Shouldn't use the same code in every game that you make.
4930280	4931481	Actually, it's different in Proteus.
4932789	4934270	It was backwards.
4957475	4959796	Respect this game or get out of my planet.
4960337	4960677	Yeah.
4960777	4961498	Off my planet.
4961758	4963539	Get off my patalandia.
4964479	4966000	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4966481	4966921	Pinbot.
4967701	4968302	Ooh, good choice.
4968482	4968682	Yes.
4969142	4970343	And it's actually not the table.
4970443	4972424	It's the NES game that Rare developed.
4972524	4973305	Excellent choice.
4974646	4976787	The game came out in... Crap, I didn't link the YouTube.
4976987	4977688	Yeah, Rob.
4977808	4979149	Sorry, it'll take me a minute to get the audio.
4979289	4981090	Everybody, I'm sorry for Rob.
4981786	4982206	Shut up.
4982647	4983567	I'm sorry for you.
4983847	4985128	I'm sorry for your face.
4985569	4986189	There we go.
4986830	4988711	Aw, epic rare soundtrack.
4988731	4990532	God, I didn't know I didn't have such good music.
4990552	4991933	Can we just listen to this for a minute?
4991953	4992133	Sure.
4992194	4993474	I don't want to hear you talk.
4993534	4994675	I just want to hear this.
4994695	4994935	You what?
4994976	4995296	Head face.
5002766	5005269	Ah, sexy lady pinball.
5005469	5008171	I like her electro moves.
5008972	5010413	Alright, I suppose you can talk now.
5011214	5016919	Anyway, the game came out in North America in 1990, and it was a version of the same pinball machine that Williams did in 1986.
5017119	5026447	The NES version actually has most of the stuff from the machine, and graphically is pretty darn accurate, I think.
5028710	5034878	I like how they even have the Williams logo at the bottom and how they did the scores where the normal price things are.
5036219	5038642	So the point really is just to get points.
5039724	5041646	You start off with your marker set on Pluto.
5042087	5044370	You have to go through the solar system by hitting different targets.
5045110	5050052	and different checkpoint planets give you specials so you get extra balls that way.
5050532	5053373	And when you reach the sun you get a super special so you get another extra ball.
5054994	5061396	You have the visor too which basically works exactly like it does in the arcade machine.
5061476	5067659	And I'm sure, I really hope most of you have played the legit for reals pinball, I mean pinbot before.
5068659	5077067	But you have a 5x5 grid that has drop targets, and once you've hit them, the grid lights, the visor opens, and you can lock the balls there to start your multiball.
5077147	5078948	And in this game, it is a double multiball.
5080149	5085334	So you can also re-lock balls while they're in multiball and get extra points.
5086074	5100508	So with this, basically, to get such a long playfield, it actually crops it where your flippers are and the top screen moves until it reconnects to wherever it would be once they're joined.
5102110	5103171	It has the ramps.
5103351	5104392	It has everything.
5104512	5106694	It really is about the best.
5107535	5116663	I mean, other than now, like on pin name or something, it really is probably... It was the only good version of this game you could get at home, apart from owning the table.
5117684	5120626	And, um, I mean, I'll sit and play this sometimes, too.
5121207	5129052	And one good thing about this, too, is that, um, it actually has, um, some of the synthesized speech from the game.
5130133	5133536	Um, although it pauses the game to play the speech.
5134356	5137278	It has most of the music, the sound effects.
5137338	5138518	You can turn them on and off.
5140179	5142060	Your pause is on your second controller.
5142100	5145842	The first can't because you use start and select as your nudge.
5146642	5147903	You know, make sure you don't tilt.
5150874	5160645	A lot of people really, really liked it because it is a faithful rendition, but there are people who did not like the enemies and hazards on the playfield as they were not in the original.
5161105	5172258	They did rare reuse the game engine to do high speed, which was also based off of Steve Ritchie's High Speed, but it was published by Tradewest.
5173699	5193713	by the way, Steve Ritchie is a really cool guy he did the voices for Black Knight for No Fear and he's just a really cool dude I want to do voices on a pinball game be fun stop shaking the table
5196286	5197608	Rob's game would be called Girl Please.
5198528	5199349	Bitch, please!
5201111	5209020	But anyway, as far as other pinball games that came out on the NES, there was Pinball, Rollerball, Rock'n'Ball, and Pinball Quest.
5211142	5214646	I really think that Pinbot is the brightest on the list.
5215489	5219751	Pinball Quest is one of those games you kind of remember through rose-colored glasses.
5219871	5221772	Like, oh man, Pinball Quest was awesome.
5221792	5226935	And then you go back and play it and you're like, god, it was... It had so many bugs and issues, though.
5227055	5227816	It was not good.
5227856	5229396	Pinbot is just solid.
5229797	5232958	It's a testament, I think, to early Rare games.
5233058	5233979	Rollerball wasn't bad.
5234199	5235160	Rollerball wasn't bad at all.
5235700	5238681	You forgot the actual game called Pinball from Nintendo.
5238701	5239922	Yeah, there was Pinball.
5240122	5242323	But I still think that Pinbot's the best of the batch.
5242383	5242944	Oh yeah, I agree.
5243904	5246806	Rollerball was also... I thought there was one other I'm not thinking of.
5247286	5248047	I'll tell you what's funny.
5248247	5253950	The actual table for Rollerball was the first game I played when I got to the expo.
5254951	5256052	I didn't know it was a real table.
5257232	5261195	Yeah, it's like... Was it like four screens tall or something?
5261655	5261855	No.
5263536	5264577	Maybe I'm thinking of a different game.
5265618	5266559	Or maybe it was Roller Games.
5266639	5267499	Roller Games is one of them.
5267559	5268800	Yeah, I think you're blending those.
5268900	5272022	Because I think Roller Ball on NES was like a four screen tall table.
5272062	5272382	Yeah, it was.
5272442	5273543	I was thinking of Roller Games.
5273763	5274023	Sorry.
5275224	5278466	You know which one I always wish I would have had a release like that?
5278546	5279247	It was Hyper Ball.
5280247	5286311	The one where you have the major multiballs and all you do is shoot pinballs all day and all night until you hit these little side targets.
5288212	5289653	Hyper Ball would have been fun, I think.
5289793	5289913	But...
5290994	5291434	Digress.
5291934	5292415	Pinbot.
5292735	5293235	Classic.
5294755	5295856	You can't go wrong with Pinbot.
5297216	5297516	Alright.
5297856	5304018	And if anyone ever thinks to get a classic table, Pinbot makes a great start and it makes really good for trading up later.
5305219	5305719	Alright, there it is.
5305739	5306619	Your classic game of the week.
5306719	5308720	Pinbot for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
5308760	5309400	One of my favorites.
5310341	5311381	A non-Sega game.
5311401	5312681	You know what?
5312741	5314522	I do non-Sega games all the time.
5314582	5315602	I've done Compile.
5315742	5317963	Non-Sega slash non-Termographics game.
5318003	5318623	I've done Irem.
5319104	5319564	Alright, no.
5319584	5320204	This is good times.
5320724	5324067	Some folks in chat reminiscing about some of the portable pinball games that were really good.
5324508	5326550	Fifth Dream says Pokemon pinball owned.
5327391	5330013	Black Wolf says I enjoyed Metroid Prime pinball in the DS.
5330113	5333216	What was the game that was on the original Game Boy?
5333276	5334537	Was it Revenge of the Gator?
5335138	5337180	That one was fun.
5337380	5338581	Revenge of the Gator was great.
5338641	5340363	I would stay up all night playing that damn game.
5340403	5341624	I remember playing that in 7th grade.
5341644	5343506	Were you a Revenge of the Gator fan, Bradley?
5346221	5347423	Oh, your mic cut out.
5347463	5348063	I don't know why.
5348084	5350627	Oh yeah, it came off the end there.
5351228	5353230	I was saying something even earlier than these games.
5353290	5362342	I don't know if it was based on any real pinball table, but there was a pinball on the Atari 2600, like Midnight Magic or something like that.
5362822	5363122	Yeah.
5363483	5365604	Atari had one of their own too.
5365784	5367926	Yeah, it was like a really basic sort of thing.
5368246	5374751	One of my favorite Commodore 64 games ever was Pinball Construction Set by ECA.
5375052	5376513	That's what EA used to be back in the day.
5376533	5377093	It was ECA.
5377434	5379455	Pinball Construction Set was awesome.
5379735	5391725	It was literally build your own damn pinball table, but people would, you know, there was no internet really back then, but you would disc trade with people and get their pinball tables and you could find some pretty epic stuff out there.
5392365	5392805	Amazing.
5394506	5396747	Lots of props for Revenge of the Gator in our chatroom.
5396768	5397908	BlackWolf says, I loved it.
5398448	5400730	Ranma says, Revenge of the Gator was godly.
5401350	5403831	I knew BlackWolf would remember Pinball Construction set.
5403851	5404432	I knew he would.
5404712	5405192	I knew he would.
5406053	5406513	There you go.
5406733	5407253	Good times.
5409051	5416974	You know, I was actually just thinking that it would be cool if, you know, because you know, like, there's actually a pinball table for Rollercoaster Tycoon.
5418274	5421095	It would be cool if they did, like, SimPin now.
5421955	5425957	You know, where it's, you build your pinball tables and then put them out on, um...
5427737	5435199	and on something like Steam, you have the creator and you put your tables up for other people to download and compare and rate.
5435439	5439500	Or how about just freaking pinball construction set, but like, you know.
5440180	5445201	And I think that the game you were thinking of was called David's Midnight Magic, wasn't it?
5446921	5450642	No, there was a Midnight Magic for Atari 2600, but there was also a David's Midnight Magic.
5451713	5453094	See, here's the pinball construction set.
5453114	5456855	Let me see if there's actual music or if there's somebody talking in this clip here on YouTube.
5456875	5463859	But yeah, you can see that they're putting together their little pinball table, and they put up little ramps, and all the stuff you use to build it's over there on the side.
5463899	5466400	And then let's see if we actually see a finished table here.
5466540	5467801	It was David's Midnight Magic.
5467821	5469822	There was also a Commodore 64 version, Rob.
5470722	5470962	Nice.
5471122	5472803	And it was on the Atari computers.
5473403	5475164	And the Atari 2600 version was just called Midnight Magic.
5475184	5475264	Okay.
5479656	5480036	Very cool.
5480497	5483999	Alright, that's going to do it for this Part A of Orange Launch Radio, but don't go anywhere.
5484019	5486341	We've got more of Orange Launch Radio to come after the break.
5486461	5487562	Oh my god, Crewball.
5487962	5489023	That was awful.
5489423	5490184	Crewball, apparently.
5490764	5501852	The Mailbag, the Fugle Question of the Week, your phone calls, and some more stories, including, yes, we're going to talk about that little controversy that went down between Nintendo and Evo, and speaking of Nintendo, a possible new franchise for them next year.
5501872	5506316	We'll talk all about that when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.
5513117	5519161	Hi there, this is Elliot B, and you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
5519802	5526246	And I want to use my voice to tell you that Donkey Kong Country 2 is the best game ever released on the Super Nintendo.
5526567	5529669	It has musical apes fighting reptilian pirates.
5530109	5531270	What more could you ask for?
5533407	5533827	Boobs.
5534968	5541070	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, live with episode number 512, July the 14th of 2013.
5541250	5550093	Big thanks to Elliot there for the bumper, even though that's the second time y'all have heard it, because I don't have any new bumpers to play, so I think you guys need to fix that.
5550413	5557175	For more information about sending a bumper to Orange Lounge Radio, check out vognetwork.com, and the forums has all the information there in Orange Lounge Radio.
5557635	5559736	Everything you need to know there.
5561016	5569380	I'm playing the new Find Me games during the break because I street passed with Bradley, who's sitting here in studio tonight, and I also street passed with DarkSakura.
5569740	5582005	Now, one thing I noticed about this Warriors Way, which I'm still trying to figure this game out, it's basically like you have troops, and the troops number is based on the number of people you've had ever in your plaza.
5582626	5589489	Now, I street passed with a friend of mine that does some of the shadow casting for movies here locally, and he's like, dude, Robb,
5590109	5594375	Like, you gave me 700 people for my army in Warrior's Way.
5594415	5597179	And I'm like, yeah, yeah, you know, I've been to E3 and all this stuff.
5597620	5599843	You know, I've picked up quite a few people.
5599883	5601064	He's like, you helped me beat a level.
5601084	5601565	I'm like, cool.
5601986	5602947	So I'm like, all right, I'm awesome.
5602987	5603688	I have a big army.
5604089	5606953	Well, I just street passed you with Brad who came into Warrior's Way.
5609253	5609974	25,000 people?
5610554	5612374	You've Street Passed with 25,000 people?
5612534	5612934	Yeah.
5613114	5616375	Wait, wait, you're not... Okay, sorry, we're not hearing you for some reason.
5616395	5617335	That's my fault, I didn't mute you.
5617355	5617775	Sorry, Bradley.
5617815	5620336	Okay, so that's not exactly how many I've Street Passed.
5620356	5620856	I actually have 1,000...
5632318	5633999	A little over a thousand street passes.
5634259	5634899	Still, that's a lot.
5635059	5642502	But the army is 25,000 because as you play the game, you get more people into your army and they'll show you the actual force.
5642602	5650645	I think it's you come in as a monarch if you've actually been playing the game and then that's when you'll see something more than a few hundred to a thousand.
5652166	5652846	That's why it was 25,000.
5652926	5654947	It's showing what my actual armory is right now.
5654987	5658729	But your people weren't like, oh, I'm going to join up.
5659129	5659989	You tried to attack
5660029	5660629	DarkSakura.com
5685140	5685360	Crazy Taxi
5701107	5701627	Possibly.
5702268	5707993	Crazy Taxi has come to Android, and yeah, it's out for $5.
5709153	5711836	It's basically like the iOS port.
5711876	5718241	They've got the two modes, original and arcade, and I think some of the music's back too, so that's good.
5718561	5720763	I'm sure they don't have Pizza Hut and all that stuff in there, but...
5722364	5722764	Still fun.
5723385	5725526	And I think it does support some controllers.
5725606	5729929	So the first thing I'm going to do with this game is I'm going to sideload it onto the Ouya to see if it works.
5730029	5733071	So that's going to be mission number one, I guess.
5734512	5738675	New Ratchet & Clank game was revealed this week into the Nexus.
5739436	5748361	That's going to be coming out at some undetermined point, I guess holiday, for $30 on PlayStation 3.
5749722	5750423	So look for it then.
5751833	5759178	And last but not least, we have some more details about the PlayStation Plus version of DriveClub.
5759738	5762480	Obviously, it will be missing a few things.
5762780	5772486	It's basically the exact same version as the full version, except it's missing a few assets, such as some of the cars or tracks that will be found in the full version.
5772846	5779450	I guess the PlayStation Plus edition will feature online multiplayer and the single-player campaign.
5780070	5783853	as well as some of the challenges, you will be able to purchase missing content.
5783953	5787875	But press the R2 button to upgrade to the full version of DriveClub now.
5788095	5798221	I think it's not going to be as expensive as buying the full version of DriveClub, but still, I mean, if you want to check it out, it's kind of a cool thing, and you don't have to buy the full version of it.
5798301	5805326	I mean, like, for example, if someone like me just wants to play it on a VOG gaming night or something like that, I don't need to buy the full version.
5805786	5808748	I can just play it as is, so it'll be cool to check out.
5809161	5817486	Yeah, I mean, I wasn't expecting... To get a release game on the system's release for free... I mean, usually the PS Plus games aren't new stuff.
5817706	5818806	It's usually a year old.
5819227	5822969	So I'm not totally surprised by this, that it's basically a glorified demo.
5822989	5825490	But it sounds like it'll at least have some multiplayer.
5826111	5827351	So it'll give you a little something.
5828092	5830913	I mean, this is what we get now instead of a pack-in game, right?
5831994	5833335	A free download coupon.
5833435	5836937	Technically, you get a pack-in thing, but it's only if you have the camera.
5837777	5838158	Oh yeah?
5838598	5839959	Oh yeah, the camera, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5840419	5842061	I don't have the camera, so I guess I'm screwed.
5843762	5847465	Because I was lucky enough to order a PlayStation 4 early, and I don't plan on changing that.
5848146	5850468	Anyway, moving on to other news.
5850568	5852409	Capcom had some layoffs this week.
5852469	5853670	That's always a bit disappointing.
5854291	5858995	One of the people affected, Christian Svensson, which is the senior VP, excuse me,
5859355	5860997	of Planning and Business Development.
5861537	5863259	He apparently is departing the company.
5863960	5871487	Capcom said in a statement, Capcom today laid off several employees from the US office as part of an overall organizational restructure of the company.
5871848	5878374	The transition to new generation of hardware and changing industry landscape have required us to adapt our business to best meet our new goals.
5878814	5882118	We sincerely thank each individual for their contributions and wish them well.
5882578	5884760	Well, this is never fun news to report.
5884820	5887021	Trying to kind of figure out the why behind this, though.
5887081	5892305	Is this because maybe expectations of Lost Planet 3 and so forth are kind of low?
5892325	5893386	Is this because there's no more Mega Man?
5894126	5894947	It's all Mega Man's fault.
5894967	5895487	All Mega Man.
5895507	5896388	It's all Mega Man's fault.
5896408	5898570	If you did Mega Man Legends 3, they wouldn't have this problem.
5899944	5902005	Now, now, no need to kick them while they're down.
5903065	5903345	All right.
5904406	5912869	Reggie Fils-Aimé in a video on YouTube mentioned that Nintendo fans can pick up Pikmin 3 early at certain video game retailers.
5913430	5920233	July 20th and 21st, you can actually do like a hands-on demo at over 250 GameStop and EB Games locations.
5920533	5922974	They still have EB Games up and running different places?
5923454	5924374	Foreign company.
5924714	5925555	Oh, in Canada.
5925575	5926035	Yeah.
5926495	5927656	So the US and Canada will have...
5928576	5946329	Pikmin 3 experiences or whatever if you pre-order the downloadable version of the game at any GameStop store on either of those two days so you have to go get a download code at GameStop on one of those two days you will be able to get the full game one whole day early on August 3rd
5947202	5968147	or you can go to Kmart who breaks street dates or Toys R Us or apparently Walmart is the new street date breaker because you know you can get them Twinkies at Walmart yeah it's rogue Twinkies in the Walmart aisles or just wait a day it's Pikmin it's not fucking Grand Theft Auto 5 or something right I mean that's what she got you know that
5969427	5972829	I mean, think of the deal with the devil that you're making here.
5972849	5980833	I mean, you're like buying a digital download code at retail to play it one day early.
5980893	5985555	And they will make you sign a pact at GameStop that you will have to sign with blood.
5985575	5986916	Hey, let's give us your email.
5987256	5992279	Hey, why don't you sign up for the card, you know, so that we can... Hey, you want to get our magazine?
5992299	5994520	Why don't you come... You got Pikmin 2 to trade in?
5994540	5996361	Truth be told, their magazine's actually pretty decent.
5998152	5999373	Nothing is ever as good as Sonic R.
6021852	6023993	SuperStreetFighter4, Alina, Poison, Rolento, Hugo
6044137	6066310	which are all based off of the fact that they were in Street Fighter X Tekken so I'm guessing that they'll be easy enough to bring over so those are the only four confirmed characters at the moment no word about the mystery fifth character although not it doesn't sound like it's Alex I guess there was a rumor going around that it was Alex but it doesn't appear to be Alex so interesting
6067830	6068690	What is this all about here?
6068711	6071331	$15 for the download.
6071491	6077093	Don't know what the date will be, but there will also be a disc-based version, which I'm assuming is everything, for $40.
6077774	6079474	Early 2014 is the tentative release.
6079494	6084756	You know, I'd like to see some of the EX characters make it into the new Street Fighter 4 stuff.
6085376	6087698	It's pretty cool that this game is still going.
6088058	6090600	I mean, thanks to updates and DLC and all that.
6090620	6091500	You're shaking your head over there.
6091520	6092221	You're a hater, Loki.
6092241	6094262	How many times have they re-released this game?
6094342	6096904	I mean, seriously, they've had... How many times have they re-released Street Fighter 2?
6097504	6106010	I understand that, but they had Street Fighter 4, then they had Super Street Fighter 4, Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition.
6106070	6108151	I'm talking all disc-based releases.
6108552	6111554	And now they're going to have Hyper Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition?
6111574	6111814	Mm-hmm.
6113328	6114629	No.
6114689	6115450	You draw the lines?
6116350	6118252	Stop buying that game.
6118912	6119513	Seriously.
6120473	6120994	It's done.
6121374	6122675	Just make a new Street Fighter game.
6122875	6124877	Or give me Capcom vs. SNK.
6124937	6126558	No, Capcom vs. SNK 3.
6127399	6134264	I don't care what evil, satanic packs have to be formed between those companies to get this to happen, but I want that game.
6136285	6136686	Give it to me.
6138787	6140008	Alright, moving on.
6140068	6141049	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
6143464	6144325	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6166902	6170285	They're just porting the... They're not even porting the game over.
6170305	6172868	I mean, it works with controller support already.
6173068	6174590	You can sideload that thing in there.
6175651	6176772	Because I have Sonic CD.
6176792	6178253	I got it with my MOGA controller.
6179034	6182277	And I think it's sideloaded on my Ouya, actually.
6182558	6184520	I don't remember if I did that or not.
6184580	6185681	But it works.
6186335	6189357	Saga of America saying that it's going to be soon.
6190237	6192299	That same soon that we always refer to.
6193199	6198582	Also, fans of Skullgirls can be happy that it's coming on PC on August 22nd.
6199423	6201384	Being put out by Lab Zero Games.
6201404	6203905	And I know a lot of people are totally into Skullgirls.
6205046	6214332	and they're also working on five new characters as DLC which is coming directly from their Indiegogo campaign they've actually exceeded their $150,000 goal they've made $828,768 so yay more Skullgirls
6223328	6226551	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6242427	6266621	and I'm really looking forward to this there's also a link on here to the documentaries which talks about the game itself and the development so I'm going to go ahead and actually relink this one in the chat room and if any people who are listening to the podcast want to look for it just go to Capcom Unity and look through their blog yeah they're actually going to do a physical retail release with pins in it
6267681	6268002	Nice.
6268843	6270887	Yeah, I heard about that.
6271067	6272749	It's a week later, though, which sucks.
6273891	6275614	But it might still be worth it.
6276495	6278579	Rob, life is like a hurricane.
6280922	6281363	It blows?
6281764	6281944	No.
6282325	6282525	What?
6283936	6284396	The song?
6284476	6285577	The theme song?
6285717	6287318	Rock You Like a Hurricane.
6287378	6288738	DuckTales Rob theme song.
6288758	6289359	I get it.
6289399	6289799	I get it.
6289859	6290219	I get it.
6290279	6290579	I get it.
6290639	6290980	God.
6291060	6291680	It's a little slow.
6292000	6292941	Jeez, Rab.
6294121	6297603	By the way, though, I listened to the Japanese theme song for DuckTales.
6298143	6300024	It's kind of interesting.
6300404	6301325	It's a song by a lady.
6305493	6307195	Oh, time for the foogle question of the week, right?
6307335	6308397	I didn't realize that was our last story.
6309258	6311260	You know, you got on me for being quiet.
6311280	6312261	I was pulling up everything.
6313002	6314103	Now you're doing it too.
6314363	6316125	I was playing me plaza games.
6316145	6316946	Pot kettle.
6317166	6317967	Pot, pot, kettle.
6317987	6319088	Very, very important.
6319169	6319849	My butt.
6323169	6343552	uh let's see uh looking at chat room at live.vognetwork.com apparently BlackWolf made a vine of me playing Pimbot Ness me meaning him while listening to OLR but vine decides not to accept the upload I guess this is why everybody ran away to Instagram sad have you guys played with the Instagram video at all no no
6344765	6348347	Rob, Instagram is like so three months ago, I swear.
6348367	6349228	Oh, Hipstagram.
6350108	6351349	All right, here, I had to hear this.
6351409	6356552	I need to use a top-level digital camera out of irony.
6381355	6381735	Amazing.
6382376	6382956	Still catchy.
6384097	6388261	Some things transcend language barriers, and a catchy melody is one of those things.
6388642	6390443	All right, let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week.
6390484	6394107	Maybe this little theme song here is a catchy melody for some of you out there.
6401716	6403017	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6426633	6426974	DarkSakura.com
6441973	6447937	Redertainment says, There's what I call a classic arcade game that I've played that I'd like to play again, The Act.
6448578	6455562	This is an extremely rare arcade game that, according to Wikipedia, only one arcade has a working stand-up arcade copy of it.
6455943	6460666	It just so happens the one arcade with a stand-up copy of The Act is located near me.
6460746	6462487	Looks like I have something to do on Monday.
6462907	6463548	What is The Act?
6463628	6464448	I don't even know that one.
6464929	6466209	The Act is a game.
6466690	6468411	It's all hand-drawn animation.
6471993	6472674	DarkSakura, Loki,
6491271	6498215	Uh, let's see, Robaba responds on Google Plus and says, I've always wanted to try Hyperball, the ball-bearing gun rapid-fire pinball.
6498595	6501717	Jamie probably has, and I'm curious as to the general object of that game.
6501797	6502477	Spell things?
6502637	6503938	Shoot them faster than they drain?
6504418	6505339	I talked about it earlier.
6505359	6505839	Yeah?
6506259	6509541	I just like shooting them really fast, and just because it's fun.
6510362	6513703	And there's so many, it's like you can play with so many balls.
6514264	6514644	Ha ha ha!
6515024	6516886	You can paddle balls all day.
6516946	6519528	You just took all those balls all at once, didn't you, DarkSakura?
6519568	6520409	And I beat them.
6520969	6523551	I beat those balls with flippers.
6525133	6525893	With your flipper?
6526314	6526834	My flippers.
6531131	6532551	That game is fucking loud, by the way.
6532731	6534012	Going to Facebook.
6535032	6543614	By the way, I just want to point out over on Facebook right now, we have 572 people that like us on Facebook, which is a nice admirable number, but we're 572.
6544794	6548575	We need one more like, and then there'll be a huge Bomani in joke there.
6548655	6549255	Come on, people.
6549895	6551876	One more like on Facebook.
6552736	6553296	Somebody give it to us.
6553316	6553496	All right.
6553836	6556837	Kurti K replied and said, Simpsons pinball.
6557617	6559299	There were actually two Simpsons pinball machines.
6559319	6561220	Was it Simpsons Pinball Party, are you thinking?
6561240	6562742	There's an old one and a newer one, isn't there?
6562902	6564563	Simpsons Pinball Party we used to have at my house.
6564743	6564944	Yeah.
6565424	6566205	It was a pretty fun table.
6566954	6580982	Andy R said, I was a bit young during the arcade boom, so I don't remember, but if I can expand to non-classic arcade games, I really want to play Jubit or Reflect Beat in an arcade.
6581383	6586926	I love rhythm games like Technica, and I feel these games would be a lot more fun in the arcade than their iPad equivalents.
6587266	6587807	You'd be right.
6588487	6592850	Sadly, I no longer live near Round 1 or Sunnyvale Golf Land, so I guess I'll have to settle for the iPad.
6593670	6594971	Actually, that reminds me of something, Rob.
6595011	6597412	You know what game they also have there speaking of side-scrolling?
6597432	6597652	Willow.
6612938	6613859	and Willow Arcade.
6613919	6614559	Amazing.
6614879	6616400	Sorry for the Facebook noises.
6616440	6620681	They're not disabled on this computer and freaking people are setting it off on purpose.
6621322	6622002	All right.
6622182	6626103	Thomas B replies and says, have you ever heard of the pinball machine Hercules?
6626504	6626584	Yes.
6626624	6628544	I believe they used four inch balls.
6629205	6630605	The machine was very large.
6630705	6633026	I only played it a few times, but it was always fun to play.
6633066	6634327	Do you like big balls, DarkSakura?
6634367	6634987	And I cannot lie.
6635587	6636407	It used a cue ball.
6637248	6637868	Oh, like in pool?
6638345	6643447	Yeah, and they had one at the last Classic Gaming Expo I went to.
6643507	6646808	It was at California Extreme two years ago.
6646848	6649309	They also had that dressed-up Captain Fantastic, too.
6650210	6654231	The big Elton John platform boots from Tommy.
6655332	6657893	But Hercules is actually... I'm short.
6657953	6660674	I have a hard time playing that game because I can't really...
6661554	6662776	You can't reach the balls?
6662856	6666542	No, I have to... It's like as wide out as my arms go.
6667343	6668424	It's like my wingspan.
6668925	6670407	And hitting the flippers is difficult.
6671128	6672010	And it moves slowly.
6673138	6678221	Dark Tetsuya says, there was one I played years ago in Santa Cruz that I'd love to chance to play again, Namco's Galaxian 3.
6679141	6686925	Imagine a gigantic booth with six seats, two 50-inch monitors with a separate laser displayer for each one, and six Star Wars-style flight controllers.
6687225	6693388	You fly along in your gunship, shooting at aliens as they fly in formation, while occasionally dealing with a gigantic alien boss.
6693428	6697450	And it's up to you and your teammates to take them down before they deplete your ship's life meter to zero.
6697830	6699371	Suffice to say, it's pretty epic.
6699551	6700672	Do you want to know something depressing?
6701732	6712717	At our Roseville Dave & Busters, right by the Redemption area, there is this booth that, for a different game, but that booth was once a Galaxian 3 booth.
6714158	6717099	It even has some of the decorating elements on it.
6717579	6719260	That used to be a Galaxian 3 booth.
6720627	6735594	uh let's see um Will M replied and said an arcade game I've never played and would love to difficult to answer as I've played a massive amount due to traveling around but I can name one I'd love to play again the Ninja Warriors that widescreen was oh so damn awesome
6736855	6739799	Chiggers says, I remember playing the kiss table when I was a kid.
6739839	6740280	I loved it.
6741121	6745688	Ragenator said, I never had the opportunity to play the arcade version of Killer Instinct, which I regret.
6746108	6750755	In terms of stuff I want to play again, it's Samurai Shodown 4, Amakusa's Revenge.
6751676	6752456	Hitstun says,
6781301	6782302	Sounds a lot like Proteus.
6782322	6785764	The game's only console release is a Japanese PlayStation 2 exclusive.
6786084	6788145	He could have made that up and I'd never know the difference.
6789326	6795250	Codeman replied and said, I know this sounds like a generic answer, but I've always wanted to play the Tron arcade game.
6795650	6796090	Which one?
6796831	6797071	That's true.
6797111	6798432	There was Tron and Discs of Tron.
6798712	6801314	They had actually Tron and Discs of Tron next to each other.
6802454	6804496	Codeman, more reason for you to go to Disneyland.
6804616	6805036	Just saying.
6805868	6809892	And I know you have a little girl who soon will be old enough to appreciate Disneyland.
6809912	6810272	Just saying.
6810492	6813095	If you take a child to Disneyland before they're five years old, they get in free.
6813795	6814917	There you go.
6815097	6816718	And a game called Time Pilot.
6817039	6817899	Time Pilot's fun.
6818620	6820942	That is, for what it's worth, that's on Xbox Live Arcade.
6821222	6823925	And it plays pretty decently with a 360 analog stick.
6824105	6824886	Just for what it's worth.
6825787	6826527	And it was in Game Room.
6827597	6835121	and lastly Kane I Am says not that I ever played it but I really want the Elvira Mistress of the Darkness table for my house because boobies.
6835761	6836522	Excellent answer.
6836562	6837982	That is a great table too.
6838042	6838302	Okay.
6839123	6839403	Which one?
6839423	6841124	The Elvira Mistress or the Scared Steff?
6841984	6843045	Elvira Mistress of the Dark.
6843527	6844787	Scaredstiff, I think, is a better table.
6844927	6856391	Okay, so I know you saw this, DarkSakura, because Alan and I went out to a bar in San Francisco after the Frank Music concert on the 4th of July, or the night before the 4th of July.
6856451	6857672	We went out in San Francisco.
6857712	6861853	We went to this bar in the Castro called Moby Dick, and they have pinball machines there.
6862513	6870356	And, like, literally, it was like DarkSakura and Alan Alchemy pinball paradise because they had a World Cup Sakura 94.
6870396	6870476	Yeah.
6871756	6889251	And they had Elvira Scared Stiff Okay, I need to go there Yeah First of all And gays and booze and a pool table Like five of my favorite things together That actually is like college for me Well, keep in mind, I worked in a pool hall Uh-huh
6890601	6896622	I'm very certain that my boss, even though he was a major dick, he did set off the gator a bit.
6897902	6901343	And of course, there were also the three other guys that I used to hang out with.
6901363	6904263	But anyway, I've been a hag all my life, Rob.
6904283	6904963	What are you talking about?
6905143	6905864	It's fine.
6906424	6908024	And then we had the World Cup soccer there.
6908644	6913445	Across the street at Solomon's, they had the Mistress of the Dark.
6914145	6918166	But did your pool hall let people play free if they weren't wearing pants?
6918586	6919566	Because this place did.
6920499	6923300	No, usually if they weren't wearing pants.
6923660	6924240	Well, I don't know.
6924280	6926241	I could wear a skirt, then I wouldn't be wearing pants.
6927642	6929602	What if a guy comes in in a Utila kilt?
6929783	6930663	Does that count?
6931303	6935285	I didn't question the system because nobody wants to see me up there playing it.
6935465	6935865	You know what?
6935905	6937966	You should just have sequined boxers.
6938726	6941507	How do you know I don't?
6943984	6945825	Alan, does Rob have sequin boxers?
6946045	6948766	The 1970s basketball shorts.
6950827	6952447	Like the ones that are up to here.
6952467	6953647	They have the teeny slit.
6954328	6956028	Like your ass literally hangs out of them.
6956568	6957709	You need to go in Columbia shorts.
6957749	6958549	That's not sexy at all.
6958689	6959550	None of this is sexy.
6960490	6961310	None of this is sexy.
6961330	6962030	Columbia shorts.
6962891	6963191	All right.
6964331	6965592	That was all our answers.
6965992	6969013	Thank you guys at Facebook and Google Plus for answering the question.
6969053	6969914	Really appreciate it.
6970254	6974696	If you didn't get your question or your answer read this week, sorry, but try sending an email.
6975176	6978897	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Let me quickly open that up to folks here in studio.
6978977	6984160	Is there an elusive game you haven't been able to play or maybe something you played once long ago you're dying to play again?
6984420	6984740	Bradley?
6985020	7001741	I was thinking of when I played it a long time ago, Galaxy Force 2, the actual arcade game that actually had a full rotating seat or sit down cabinet where you basically Sumo Yeah, but full rotating.
7002121	7003523	Could you actually go upside down and stuff?
7003763	7004183	Loki?
7021468	7024230	Well, I would have said the Galaxian 3, but someone already said that.
7024910	7032294	I would be willing to try the Silent Hill arcade game, because I still haven't played that, and I know that was something that they made a while ago.
7033075	7034816	So the Silent Hill arcade game would be fun.
7035336	7041200	And although it's not really an arcade game, I'd love to go back and play Battletech again as part of Virtual World.
7042781	7043841	Did Alan just text you?
7044041	7045242	Yes, he did, and he said no.
7046663	7046923	Alan!
7048564	7049985	Jamie, is there something that's been eluding you?
7051423	7058707	I would like to play Radiant Silvergun again because I've played an arcade version of that and I loved Gun Survivor 2, Byhazard Gun Survivor 2.
7060427	7066490	I think what I would actually like to play again as far as tables that I haven't seen in a little while is a Black Rose.
7067590	7068971	And I've been trying to get Dan to get us one.
7069351	7070512	I would love to have a Black Rose.
7071092	7071592	Thanks for watching!
7089006	7094669	I guess my answer would be I would really like to play F-Zero AX again in one of the sit-down cabinets.
7095129	7097830	That shit was pretty amazing and I missed that an awful lot.
7098290	7099291	So I'd like to be able to play that again.
7099311	7101032	And we're not talking just the regular sit-down cabinets.
7101052	7102572	No, we're talking the ones that rotate.
7102592	7105534	The ones that will almost flip you upside down, like just shy of that.
7105934	7106614	I missed that.
7106674	7107594	That was epic.
7108375	7109935	So I would say maybe, yeah, I guess that's my answer.
7110035	7110696	F-Zero AX.
7110936	7111636	I'd like to play that again.
7111656	7115698	And there was like a table, a pinball table that I hadn't played in a long time that I actually got to see it
7116258	7117159	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7140736	7141978	Coupa Kid Jeremy Coupa Kid Jeremy
7160976	7186609	like that's what old arcades smelled like and Chuck E. Cheese well Chuck E. Cheese didn't smell like cigarettes like they did ban smoking in there I think because you know kids but cheap pizza for sure at Chuck E. Cheese anyhow uh let's see Codeman says tell me about it I don't even want to know what an arcade is anymore well god I think there's somebody legit said in their answer you know I think I was kind of born after arcades were really a thing and that just made me like
7187129	7188850	I had a sad for a minute.
7188911	7189411	You know what?
7189711	7191232	I'm going to offer up a description.
7191813	7194835	This was the Aladdin's Castle in Mobile, Alabama.
7195495	7198778	The day I went after my little brother had gotten hit by a car.
7199378	7199678	Oh my.
7199899	7200459	He was six.
7200659	7201340	He's 30 now.
7201600	7204622	No, 27 right now.
7204782	7206584	So that, you know, dates it.
7207484	7211227	The walls were half-carpeted, the same way they had been since the 70s.
7211468	7216272	Yeah, this has to be like 1992, something like that.
7216292	7216272	91.
7218133	7221176	The walls had brown carpet up to the side, like a roller rink does.
7222257	7222897	Old wallpaper.
7224138	7226160	Posters of games from the 80s.
7228222	7232446	The first thing that you saw when you walked in was a Samurai Shodown 2 on the 44-inch screen.
7233086	7233787	Big-ass thing.
7234207	7235708	To the left would have been a hockey table.
7235748	7236529	I remember it perfectly.
7236609	7238250	To the left would have been an air hockey table.
7239051	7241112	As you go back, you see Nark.
7241973	7244254	You see a four-player Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
7244755	7248377	You see a Street Fighter 2 Hyper Fighting Edition.
7249038	7249598	You see...
7251039	7252441	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7268638	7269799	Chuck E. Cheese smells like pee
7289392	7312004	I don't remember they do now that's for sure I don't remember from when I was a kid but maybe you know everything I remember I have this really early memory you know I don't remember a lot from when I was like before like you know you don't remember a lot from before you're like five years old I don't know about you guys but one thing I do remember is being I think I was three years old at my sister's wedding because my sister would have been 19 or 20 at the time because there's a big age difference between us
7312844	7313545	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7337982	7350684	and I remember a room at Chuck E. Cheese that was nothing but a strobe light and you would dance in front of the strobe light or whatever and like it's like 80s technology like strobe lights or like this new technology.
7350724	7352485	Now you can have a strobe light on your fucking phone.
7352545	7354105	Did yours have the day glow room?
7355045	7355485	I don't remember.
7355505	7366007	It was black lights with drawings on the wall that would glow under the black light and at my Chuck E. Cheese and this is like the old old ass one that like I think burned down.
7367427	7376151	Yeah, but there were the hands and feet on the wall right above the door and you go through the door and you're in this little room that's day glow and then on the other side is the bathroom.
7376591	7376851	Wow.
7377572	7378512	But we had that too.
7378552	7380953	We had the strobe room too and then we had the room with the hippo lady.
7381713	7382994	Yes, I remember the hippo lady.
7383014	7384374	The party room with hippo lady.
7384474	7385275	Henrietta Hippo.
7385355	7386996	They still have all the animatronics.
7387036	7388816	They get scarier as you get older.
7389437	7389837	But anyway.
7390237	7392618	Yeah, we had the showbiz pizza at my place.
7394064	7394824	One of them bought the other.
7394864	7396525	Chuck E. Cheese bought Showbiz at one point.
7397505	7398406	Pizza Time Theater.
7398666	7400767	Were you from this area?
7400827	7402388	No, I'm from South Carolina.
7402908	7404369	You know who owned Pizza Time Theater, right?
7404509	7406030	Nolan Bushnell.
7407290	7409411	And then there was Bullwinkles that had the water show.
7410712	7411413	Water Sports.
7411613	7412473	They had a water show.
7412513	7414074	They had a fountain.
7414214	7416795	It would just do this fountain show thing.
7416875	7419437	A miniature version of what you would see at the Bellagio.
7419497	7421538	Is that like the climax of The Great Muppet Caper?
7421658	7423119	Did Miss Piggy come out on the fountain?
7423159	7423879	Sort of, I guess.
7424019	7425280	It's Bullwinkles.
7426240	7427281	All the Bullwinkles characters.
7427609	7429050	I want to go to an arcade, arcade, arcade
7453513	7460636	So we went to some mall and, you know, because my mom liked to shop anyway, so we went to the mall and they had an arcade and I got my way.
7461036	7463637	I fucking miss malls having arcades.
7463857	7464257	Yeah, I know.
7464657	7465057	Seriously.
7466438	7475021	I miss, and actually I'd have to say that even though I hated doing parties and stuff, that was probably the most fun job I've had was working at the arcade.
7475521	7476502	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7496978	7502664	When Tekken 3 just came out, and we had just been purchased by Namco as well, so we had shirts with Pac-Man on it, it was really cool.
7503044	7507889	And went over to the cyber station that was all Pac-Man branded themed and everything, and that was really cool.
7507929	7513194	But working at the Aladdin's Castle was just a touch like working in an old 80s style arcade.
7513674	7515095	And I had a good time there.
7515536	7519920	I mean, I would come home with a migraine every night, but other than that, I had a great time working there.
7524635	7526297	Yeah, good memories about arcades.
7526617	7527277	Good times.
7528759	7533343	And also that was figuring out the right place to knee the Street Fighter Alpha 2 where I could play for free.
7534364	7537386	You know, was that like your first minimum wage job type of thing?
7538307	7538447	No.
7538908	7544893	My first minimum wage job was working for a grocery store, which I probably quit a week later because they scheduled me during my classes.
7545333	7546294	Dope.
7546434	7549016	I don't actually count that as a for reals job because it was hell.
7549377	7550838	My first minimum wage job was not that bad.
7551966	7561681	My second one was working in the game room at school and then after that it was working at a cookie store where I lived on cookies for a year and then it was the arcade.
7562925	7564867	I worked at a place called... They don't exist anymore.
7564887	7568329	It was Placer TV Video, which was a video rental store they used to rent.
7568349	7568830	I know of them.
7569010	7573473	Yeah, well, they were still around in the mid-90s when everything was starting to shift to DVD.
7573934	7581520	And at that time, they were still renting NES games and videotapes, but they didn't really get on the DVD bandwagon fast enough, and that's kind of what killed them.
7581980	7582981	But we rented porn.
7583962	7584162	Like...
7584562	7585203	Did you have the red door?
7601139	7602340	No, it was just on the top shelf.
7603120	7603320	Yeah.
7603820	7605661	There was no laws prohibiting that stuff.
7605922	7613105	People weren't so freaking... I remember... Like, trying to be politically correct and protect everybody back then.
7613125	7614826	I just remember... Kids can't reach that high.
7615026	7618708	My granny taking me to rent videos when I was in Dothan for a summer.
7619228	7621069	And by the way, the arcade we had in Dothan was Tilt.
7621449	7622910	Yeah, I remember Tilt.
7623290	7623491	But...
7624691	7627432	She just said, okay, pick whatever movie, make sure it's a good movie.
7628172	7632333	I'd rent Star Wars like 57,000 times and just actually return to the Jedi because that was my favorite movie.
7633053	7640255	And then I once rented this movie that I think the name was in another language, but it was pretty much Tiger Shark.
7640755	7643515	And it was one of those Jaws-like movies except with naked people.
7644156	7645016	And I watched it.
7645136	7647576	I watched the whole movie.
7648057	7652938	And I'm like, my sister's with me and she's like, this movie's dirty.
7652958	7653518	And I'm like...
7654448	7655649	There's so much blood.
7657289	7658210	Blood RG, yeah.
7658610	7663012	But I loved being taken to go rent movies with people who wouldn't read labels.
7663272	7663672	All right.
7663772	7667534	Memory lane, memory lane, and we're not even back into gaming news.
7667614	7668194	Sorry.
7668874	7670535	Let's get back into some gaming news, Loki.
7671195	7677517	Alright, so there was a little bit of a controversy with the new DSX game, The Fall, that came out on iOS platforms.
7677857	7682499	Apparently, the game had a lockout for jailbroken devices.
7683059	7688761	Now, I guess the general thought is, well, your device is jailbroken, you're probably stealing the game.
7689421	7690282	That's not always true.
7690362	7696146	People jailbreak devices to put their phone on a different carrier or something like that.
7696546	7697206	So there's that.
7697286	7704952	So people that were legitimately buying the game, allegedly, were unable to fire the gun in the game.
7705492	7706152	Couldn't fire it.
7706713	7706993	Nothing.
7707697	7718426	That's kind of a... I mean, it's like one of the... You hear about the clever anti-piracy things like, you know, in what, Batman Arkham Asylum, like you couldn't jump far enough to get past certain parts of the game.
7718806	7724611	You know, and I can applaud for a clever anti-piracy thing, but jailbreaking your device isn't piracy.
7724631	7725572	It's legal, actually.
7726352	7728713	I thought didn't they come down and say that was illegal?
7728793	7730534	I think it's gone back and forth a few times.
7730954	7731435	It's a mess.
7731675	7736317	But anyway, I mean, people, exactly like you said, just because you jailbreak your device doesn't make you a pirate.
7736677	7736817	Yeah.
7737498	7751665	And on top of that, though, there is an app that you can get from the homebrew store or whatever that basically you can patch it so that you can play the game.
7751825	7755207	It basically makes your device look like it's not jailbroken, even though it is.
7755498	7762660	Well, what they should have done is they should have put this out there on the piracy sites like the hours before they put it out on the official app store.
7763080	7771382	That's how you get the pirates is you got to put like the version of the game up on the piracy sites and then kind of like flood the market, so to speak.
7772002	7774223	I mean, it'll get ratted out as a fake soon enough.
7774283	7776603	But by that point, it's already kind of saturated.
7776703	7780344	Well, if you know, apparently, you know, people didn't like that.
7780364	7781565	That was the case.
7781645	7783085	So they're going to patch it out later on.
7783345	7784446	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7802896	7814569	We did not clearly state that the game would not support jailbroken devices, and we'll be switching this off via an update so that all support iOS devices will be able to play the game in the near future.
7815441	7815721	DarkSakura.com
7834282	7836584	I think some people are watching it while they're listening to the show.
7836644	7838425	It's finishing up right now, I believe.
7839065	7840947	And, of course, big controversy this week.
7840987	7841947	Super Smash Bros.
7842047	7846050	Melee was pulled from the live streaming schedule at one point.
7847151	7847871	Super Smash Bros.
7847911	7849613	Melee was pulled from the weekend event.
7850013	7851574	In an update on Shoryuken.com...
7852754	7879399	EVO co-founder Inkblot said regrettably we've just been informed by Nintendo of America that we do not have permission to broadcast Super Smash Brothers Melee for EVO 2013 well now this whole thing was a bit of a mess because in order to get the game featured in EVO in the first place they had to do a charity fundraiser to raise the money not for the tournament but I think to get like like the whole thing was like which fan communities can raise the most money for a good cause will feature those games in EVO that's the sense I get from this whole thing
7879919	7904424	and sure enough the fans of Smash Brothers Melee raised $90,000 well in comes Big Bad Nintendo to pull the plug on this you know to not have this happen but thanks to the immense vocalness of the internet and trending topics on Twitter, Reddit certainly a bit of a PR nightmare and within hours Melee returned to be broadcast over the EVO 2013 tournament
7908085	7911146	What's interesting, though, is that it did came out after that.
7911546	7912526	So it got reinstated.
7912546	7912946	It was pulled.
7912986	7913666	It was reinstated.
7913686	7924549	But then it came out after that, that co-founder Joey Quellar, I'm sorry if I'm saying that wrong, said about the he's a co-founder of the EVO thing and an organizer.
7924609	7930090	He said they were not only trying to shut down the stream, they were trying to shut down the event, the smash portion of the event.
7930610	7931370	It's their IP.
7931430	7932310	They can do what they want.
7932330	7934711	They didn't present us with any options to keep it open.
7935651	7938173	Um, but of course that obviously didn't happen.
7938213	7939414	They ended up streaming it after all.
7939454	7948699	This does seem like a real bad case of communication and kind of the PR department saying one thing and the legal department coming through and saying another.
7949139	7952642	Nintendo is incredibly protective of their IPs and so forth.
7952982	7956444	It sounds like it wasn't really understood what was going on.
7956924	7957325	EVO Evolution
7975501	7977843	Oh, sorry, I thought I said, sorry, yeah, Evo.
7978644	7980685	I thought, anyway, I thought of this.
7980786	7983067	I was reminded of a couple years ago.
7983087	7989233	Do you remember when Weird Al did that parody of Lady Gaga's Born This Way that was performed this way?
7990053	7993897	And he said that he couldn't put it out.
7993957	7995998	He was going to do it as like a single or whatever.
7996319	7998861	He couldn't put it out because Lady Gaga said no.
7999261	8025672	Lady Gaga he always gets permission from the artist or at least always tries you know but if the artist says no he won't put it out and Lady Gaga said no and all these people started tweeting Lady Gaga like you know bitch it's weird out let him do the song well turns out Lady Gaga comes out and says I never heard the song one of my people to or like you know one of her legal people said no to it even though that legal person in the response said Lady Gaga said no but she had never heard it
8026621	8028342	and it wasn't until the whole thing blew up on the internet.
8028722	8034425	I couldn't help but be reminded of that because unfortunately, yes, I'm comparing Nintendo to Lady Gaga.
8034465	8035426	Hear me out here.
8036106	8044670	But it's this whole big mess of he said, she said, right hand isn't talking to left hand and this is the stuff that happens and it did make Nintendo look stupid.
8045231	8051374	Like, you know, this is all for... Well, it was done by charity for a good cause to bring...
8051974	8052814	and DarkSakura.
8073359	8074380	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8093716	8099139	Or you can say, fuck you, you're not going to get to watch this because we're just going to be dicks about it.
8100159	8106903	And then, you know, now you just pissed off a community and you're like, we're not buying your system or your game, so forget it.
8107543	8109144	But then they'll buy the game because, you know, they have to have it.
8109720	8116923	Tiger Claw said that he heard that Super Smash Brothers Melee had over 130,000 people watching the live stream during the game's finals earlier today.
8116963	8121384	It was the most watched fighting game in history, according to the co-founder of EVO.
8122265	8124645	Interesting, because the whole thing did kind of work out in the game.
8124685	8128027	I mean, I think more people watched it because of this controversy.
8128107	8130648	I think a lot of people wouldn't have had an idea this was happening.
8130908	8131588	I'm going to be honest.
8132088	8133069	That's what happened.
8133409	8137674	And then, of course, we have our smarties in chat saying Actdeft says play this way.
8138154	8139736	Ranma says stream this way.
8141858	8143239	Ooh, baby, there is no way.
8143559	8145061	We will let you stream that game.
8145241	8147043	You cannot stream that game, no.
8148539	8148739	No.
8150680	8151160	I tried.
8152721	8153462	All right, anyway.
8153562	8161586	Well, glad they worked it out, but legal department and big companies need to figure, you know, realize that this is the world we live in.
8162667	8165828	It's yet another example of Nintendo does not understand the internet.
8166589	8167729	This does not help their case.
8167749	8170411	What is it, a series of tubes?
8170491	8171892	Yes, right, DarkSakura.
8172272	8176154	It's these wires, and there's things on them, and they do stuff.
8176610	8182276	How about a new franchise coming from Nintendo?
8182296	8185078	This was actually voiced by Miyamoto.
8188882	8195689	Basically, he let it slip that there is going to be a new franchise, and he said this on the Japanese publication.
8196229	8196569	Thank you.
8196589	8196829	Thank you.
8216812	8219413	I'm glad that they're coming up with new IP.
8219994	8221995	Like the new IP that they launched the Wii system with.
8222075	8224556	Excite Truck needs a sequel.
8224796	8225496	A good sequel.
8225757	8228198	And I'm not talking about Excite Bots because that was crap.
8228258	8230659	You don't put minigames in the middle of a fucking race.
8231740	8231980	Yeah.
8232600	8235902	I shouldn't have to throw pie at a clown while I'm racing a car.
8237282	8238103	I do that all the time.
8238143	8239403	It's called going to Disneyland with Dan.
8240324	8242425	Or make a sandwich.
8243081	8248363	Literally, there was make a sandwich during Burger Time Racers.
8248403	8250804	Don't get me wrong, it's a funny idea.
8251004	8253846	I mean, in playing the game, you're just like, what the fuck?
8253866	8259468	You know, this is silly, but it's just... We need Warriors Wacky Races.
8260088	8260949	Wouldn't that be crazy?
8261249	8266011	Instead of a Mario Kart, do like a Wario Kart and have it be like just completely fucked up.
8266616	8269158	Well, this new Mario Kart 8, you're going upside down.
8269498	8273382	Mario Kart 8 basically looks like F-Zero, which, like, it makes me happy.
8273402	8274342	Why can't we just have F-Zero?
8274583	8277905	It makes me really happy and really fucking irritated at the same time.
8278306	8281769	Like, Nintendo, you're fucking teasing me now.
8282009	8282409	Stop it.
8282449	8283630	Nintendo, wrong.
8284891	8286212	I'm all for new IPs, though.
8286373	8286993	You know, new IPs are fine.
8287013	8291537	We built this wonderful engine for F-Zero, and then we're like, eh, no one wants F-Zero.
8291637	8292558	Nobody wants F-Zero.
8292578	8293759	Nobody wants that.
8294386	8294906	Alright, moving on.
8294946	8295206	Loki.
8296167	8296467	Alright.
8297027	8303431	So, uh, Desura has actually been purchased up by, um... What was it?
8303651	8308093	The Second Life company, Linden Labs.
8308413	8310995	And so... What's that mean?
8312496	8313476	I have no fucking clue.
8314557	8316378	Other than, you know, it's changed ownership.
8316418	8321540	I don't think it's really going to change anything as far as, you know, the distribution service goes.
8322521	8322641	Um...
8324201	8324882	So yeah, it's interesting.
8324902	8330407	Maybe Second Life will become like PlayStation Home and you can launch games within Second Life.
8331048	8335032	Except with a lot more furry... No, actually it is exactly like PlayStation Home.
8335072	8336213	Exactly like PlayStation Home.
8336233	8339777	It would be very meta because like PlayStation Home was kind of inspired by Second Life.
8339937	8343460	But there are flying dicks in Second Life and not in PlayStation Home.
8343520	8345863	Well, there are dicks in PlayStation Home.
8346323	8347364	They're not flying though.
8348825	8349866	Do they have rocket packs?
8352728	8361214	Alright, you can file this in, you know, I don't know if this is rule 37 or what, but this is just the gaming community at work here.
8361834	8374103	There is a petition going around telling Microsoft, or I should say asking, demanding that Microsoft bring back the restrictive DRM policies that they had already rescinded due to outrage.
8374143	8377245	Yes, there are fans petitioning Microsoft to bring it back.
8378325	8384468	It's actually a petition posted on Change.org I hate that site Why do you hate Change.org?
8384588	8397393	Because you sign any petition on there and you get 50,000 spam emails from them And yeah, I'm all good for signing petitions, but not on that site I will not sign a single one on that site
8397938	8399560	Okay, so here's the petition.
8423962	8428307	to whoever, give us back the Xbox One we were promised at E3.
8428387	8429788	Sincerely, your name.
8430289	8434052	They have hit 24,476 signatures.
8434233	8438817	Yeah, and a lot of those are just troll signatures too, by the way, because they're like, yeah, we want them to do this.
8439218	8445704	But I'm sorry, once again, comparing the digital marketplace that Xbox One would have to Steam is just stupid.
8446826	8451931	There's a perfect example of the difference right now with the Steam sale.
8451991	8456035	First off, you see a lot of discounts on Steam.
8457657	8460680	Steam is not the only place you can get Steam games.
8460841	8468349	You can get Steam games or Steam DRM-enabled games on Amazon, Greenman Gaming...
8468889	8470190	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8489830	8491631	and we still don't know what the fucking details were on that.
8491651	8493153	That's what pisses me off about this too.
8493253	8495694	You don't know what the fuck you're complaining about.
8496875	8501959	All 24,000 of you, you literally do not know what the fuck you're complaining about.
8503740	8506983	They never said what the rules were.
8509004	8518011	Because if it was that one hour demo thing... I know this is a show where every gamer has a voice and I welcome every opinion but I can literally say this petition is ignorant.
8520450	8526034	Speaking of ignorant and change.org, I have been informed that they no longer send out the emails.
8526695	8526975	Oh, okay.
8526995	8527435	Well, that's good.
8529116	8529356	Wow.
8529397	8531358	You just fessed up to your own ignorance here on the show.
8531498	8531958	It happens.
8532078	8533560	Well, it's because I ignored them for a while.
8533620	8534060	I didn't care.
8534540	8535581	Ignore ignorant.
8536261	8537222	You know, same word.
8537242	8538523	Same combination.
8540086	8540566	Humblebundle.
8540586	8543847	There's another perfect example of places you can get Steam games for dirt cheap.
8544368	8547028	I'm just saying that's the problem.
8548029	8559573	Even comparing the PlayStation Network store or Xbox Live Marketplace to Steam is just ridiculous because it's not an open platform as far as you're not going to have competing marketplaces out there.
8559593	8562514	It's not like the retail marketplace where everyone's competing with each other.
8562794	8564394	You have one central marketplace.
8565215	8567335	You buy it their way or you don't buy it at all.
8567516	8567876	Origin.
8570065	8575608	ShadowNextGen in our chat says, Sky, couldn't it be said that people originally didn't really know what they were complaining about?
8576008	8578569	By the way, no, I haven't signed the petition, nor do I plan to.
8578749	8580850	I appreciate the devil's advocate perspective.
8580890	8582271	I know you're an Xbox fan.
8582831	8585512	And unlike some of these people, I do think you do know what you're talking about.
8585552	8586793	So let me humor this opinion here.
8587653	8590254	about didn't we not originally know what we were complaining about.
8590394	8591194	No, we did.
8591514	8595876	Xbox made it very clear about the restrictions that they were putting into place.
8596316	8598016	They had three pages of it.
8598056	8600337	Yeah, it was that whole official letter they put out there.
8600357	8601157	It was very clear.
8601197	8602498	There was no misinterpreting that.
8602898	8605279	You will have to check in once every 24 hours.
8605699	8609860	You will only be able to trade and use games through authorized vendors and all this stuff.
8609880	8611501	I mean, that was in writing.
8612721	8620828	and you can read between the lines and see that that meant that you would not be able to sell games yourself on eBay and so on and so on.
8621208	8626572	The problem is what they didn't communicate was the positive to offset that negative.
8627213	8629334	Family sharing was this big cloud out there.
8629595	8632817	Ten people in your house can play the games but how?
8633318	8634238	What are the terms?
8634579	8638221	Because there's literally people out there and I bet you the people signing this petition think
8639076	8654862	that it was share with people across the internet the full unhinged complete game 10 people playing it all at once now we can all pool in on our game sales I don't think any of you think that listening to this but I think there were people out there that really think that
8655402	8657423	Yeah, they thought that they could share games.
8657663	8665208	Oh, hey, I'm only going to have to pay $6 for this Xbox One game, and all my nine other friends are going to chip in as well, and we can all play this game.
8665268	8666489	No, I'm sorry, that's not the way it works.
8666549	8670211	When in reality, it was probably like the GIMP to Drive Club thing, honestly.
8670251	8677135	Seriously, people, do you really think that Microsoft would legitimately put out a service like that, that they would stand to lose money on?
8678758	8692836	and they got beat by Sony Sony took advantage of this yes they did take advantage of this situation that is business and it's the it's to be fair it's the exact flip of seven years ago when PlayStation embarrassed themselves at E3
8694357	8698099	Anyhow, I wanted to read this comment to... Where was it?
8698179	8698479	Oh, yes.
8698519	8702680	This is very important from Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com.
8703040	8706922	Official quote from anti-consumer Blackwolf with his quotey fingers.
8707462	8708502	Fuck those fans.
8710443	8711003	Thank you, Bobby.
8712724	8714365	We'll end on that note.
8715145	8717726	All right, moving on to the mailbag.
8719174	8721155	It is the show where every gamer has a voice.
8721295	8725476	And if you are one of those people that signed that petition, I invite you to come at me, bro.
8725976	8733879	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com In all seriousness, I can be respectful if you want to have a respectful discussion.
8735679	8738060	But you have to admit that the petition is a little silly at this point.
8738080	8738560	Just let it be.
8738860	8740161	It's an online petition.
8740221	8740881	I mean, come on.
8741381	8741821	You know what?
8741941	8742141	Wait.
8742321	8742962	Before the mailbag.
8743042	8743582	This is important.
8744362	8746743	I would fully support, fully support
8747503	8754906	and I think this is what those people would want so before you write your angry email I'm going to meet you halfway here I would be totally okay with this
8755663	8759446	with a physical disc license and a digital download license.
8760166	8770794	And if you want to buy your game on physical disc, then game sharing and all that stuff works the way you know it today, and everything is just like that shady PlayStation video and all that, everything you know and love about games.
8771414	8775237	But a digital download license would give you something different.
8775638	8781242	I think that's kind of the place gaming ought to go, is that if you download a game... But you have the freedom to choose.
8781442	8782322	You get these perks.
8783343	8805432	your perk for buying the game digitally is you get it day one you can buy the game without pants you won't have to leave your house and you can give that game to a friend in New York or something cross country it would have these different licenses I am totally okay with that and I would be behind Xbox One 100% with that I just don't think it's going to happen
8806590	8807711	And they can always come back.
8807791	8810933	They said that later on they may implement some of the stuff that they got rid of.
8811153	8814615	Hopefully none of the bad things, but you know.
8814635	8818077	They could just be there trying to find a way to integrate something that won't scare people off.
8818157	8822520	But I can't support a petition that is like, switch it back to the way it was because everyone's stupid.
8822840	8823701	We don't like it.
8823761	8824682	We want it this way.
8825822	8828344	Daddy, I want the goose that lays the golden eggs.
8829099	8830941	I want the world I want the whole world
8845765	8850408	Dear OLR, I just wanted to say, as always, that you have an awesome show.
8851269	8854111	I wanted to share with you a game I recently acquired on Steam.
8854151	8857573	It's called Akaniero Demon Hunters.
8858513	8862056	It plays a lot like Okami in the sense that you get shards for each demon you kill.
8862096	8864377	This is the storyline... Learn to spell.
8865738	8866759	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
8867179	8867619	Straight.
8867819	8869961	Not with an E, with an A. From Steam.
8870961	8874523	I'm not very good at descriptions, so I took this one from the official game site.
8875244	8884109	Akaneiro Demon Hunters transports you to a world realized in a striking visual style inspired by Japanese ink, water, and woodblock illustration.
8885089	8889793	We've dug deep into the history and folklore of Japan when designing our scenarios and characters.
8892054	8899580	Mixing this foundation with an original mythology inspired by Red Riding Hood has yielded a fantastic and inspiring setting for players to explore.
8900260	8906325	It was produced, I think, by Spicy Horse, who was in charge of American McGee's Alice Madness Returns, which is another awesome game, by the way.
8906745	8908006	Maybe you guys can check it out.
8908066	8909587	It's on Steam for $10 now.
8909968	8911069	The graphics are stunning.
8911109	8914171	It reminded me a lot of Okami, as it looks like drawings on the screen.
8914631	8916793	I hope you guys get to check it out sometime.
8916893	8919475	And as always, happy gaming and thanks for letting every gamer have a voice.
8919515	8920356	Sincerely, Gigi.
8921136	8921717	You're welcome.
8922017	8922437	Thank you.
8922757	8924739	I might have to give it a try if I have money.
8925700	8929122	I like hearing about game reviews about games I haven't really heard a lot of.
8929222	8929963	So, thank you.
8930403	8932285	Okay.
8932505	8932985	This comes from...
8935675	8938956	Like Rob, I got caught up in the same trading cards thingy.
8939356	8941237	It seems to be never-ending.
8941297	8946099	Just for fun, I bought my missing binding of Isaac's cards.
8946499	8947720	Then I converted them to a badge.
8947780	8953322	Not only did that eat all the cards, I got a booster pack soon with more binding of Isaac cards.
8953482	8956403	One of the cards was a foil, and so now I have a foil badge to collect.
8957123	8963046	The regular trading cards can power up my existing badge, so there's no reason for selling or trading cards unless they're duplicates.
8964146	8967770	I was using $5 of my own money plus selling my duplicates to obtain a full set.
8968271	8970193	I still have almost $3 left over.
8970253	8974237	Pro tip, don't try buying the cards at the top of the queue on the marketplace.
8974297	8976940	It will most likely be gone before you can complete your transaction.
8977761	8980664	I don't think the trading card system was running...
8985073	8989237	2 to 5 July, and maybe the 2nd through the 5th July because I paid for hours and got no drops.
8990518	8991839	I played for hours and got no drops.
8992139	8994001	Lastly, the cards are worth zooming in on.
8994021	8996683	The Fairy Solitaire cards are actually panoramas from the game.
8997143	9001527	The artwork will probably look way better zoomed in, and that's from Addictra-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
9001707	9003088	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9030485	9032786	But anyhow, yeah, the trading card thing is fun.
9033006	9037867	And thank you, Ranma, for doing trading cards with me last week or this last week.
9038328	9039688	Ranma sent an email that just said 573.
9040988	9044149	So maybe we hit.
9044250	9044810	Did we hit it?
9044930	9045530	Oh, maybe we did.
9046650	9047270	Thank you, Ranma.
9048171	9048711	I'm looking now.
9050185	9054889	We have another email that I'm just going to go ahead and read it but I'm not going to say the guy's full name.
9055430	9055790	Okay.
9056050	9062096	So my name is Jeff G and I've worked at an ESPN affiliate radio station for three years.
9062516	9063977	I've played video games since I can remember.
9064057	9068161	I am interested in video games radio and would love to send in my resume and some clips of me on air.
9068461	9070463	Sorry, we're not hiring because we don't pay anything.
9072204	9073706	I didn't see this email, really.
9074987	9079310	If nothing comes of this email, I would still like to commend you for living the dream of talking about video games.
9079711	9082132	Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing back from you.
9082373	9083734	Well, bless your heart, sir.
9085735	9087637	If we could afford to pay, we would be paid.
9087897	9093241	Yeah, unfortunately, this is an all-volunteer organization, but I will throw this out there.
9094162	9096263	VOG is looking for more shows.
9096504	9103448	Now we're looking for established shows because we want to make sure that the people we recruit aren't going to throw in the towel after you.
9103488	9106890	I mean, look to the site's credit at Voice of Geeks Network.
9107030	9108871	We've had the same lineup for like a year.
9109471	9109892	DarkSakura.com
9125590	9131933	If you do have a show that's interested in being on the network, get in touch with me directly, rob at vognetwork.com.
9148983	9154228	I would love a board game, card game, like non-video game type show.
9154268	9162295	So if you think about, I would love, love, love a show that is like LARPing live or like playing a game live, one of those types of shows.
9162976	9164618	It would make a great serial.
9165519	9166520	So just throwing that out there.
9166760	9171044	If you have an established show along those lines, get in touch with me, rob at vognetwork.com.
9171965	9173086	And we'll see what we can do.
9177045	9181126	Otherwise, I invite this guy to just call our show some night.
9182107	9184407	If you're around on a Sunday night, give our show a call.
9184647	9185248	Yeah.
9185408	9186808	We'll be happy to talk video games with you.
9187188	9187748	And who knows?
9187768	9189309	For free.
9189569	9194770	And who knows, you know, you might find your niche in the geekdom market, too.
9195510	9196811	You know, we might...
9197932	9199295	There's sports geeks out there.
9199315	9202001	You said you worked for ESPN affiliates, so who knows?
9202522	9206131	We got sports geek talk, as long as there's no wrestling, because that would drive Bobby crazy.
9209557	9210778	Unless it's like 80s wrestling.
9210818	9212019	How could that drive anybody crazy?
9212279	9212919	80s wrestling was the best.
9212939	9217602	And your theme song has to be Hulk Hogan's I am a real American.
9217622	9219183	Because, you know, anyway.
9219823	9221825	All right, let's get to the FUs of the week.
9222545	9229489	Every week here on the show we... Oh, by the way, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com If you would like to send in your mail, please, no resumes.
9230950	9234893	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Here's the FUs of the week time.
9250246	9251907	FU to Bitchface.
9253707	9254868	She doesn't listen to the show.
9255428	9256808	Some people know who Bitchface is.
9257809	9258089	FU.
9259149	9259869	And also my hip.
9261950	9264591	And the stupid cough that I am now going on to week five.
9266392	9266712	Fuck.
9268352	9268633	Done.
9269513	9269913	Uh, Loki.
9270753	9271674	FU to Tension and Headaches.
9271994	9273334	I always get them.
9274415	9275355	And I have one now.
9276539	9279161	I'm gonna follow that up with my own F.U.
9279201	9283965	to headaches, because I had a really bad one yesterday that pretty much ruined my day.
9284165	9286427	I will say that, but I guess shit happens.
9286987	9288929	Bradley, do you have any F.U.s you want to get off your chest?
9289289	9289429	F.U.
9289449	9292792	to my back for hurting after a California stream yesterday.
9292812	9298436	And then seriously, fuck you to this douchebag Wingstopper's boy.
9298456	9302979	He said they wouldn't take my order because it's getting late at 10.30 when I ordered after 11, like, several times.
9306642	9307762	There it is.
9307802	9309363	FUs of the Week.
9334441	9338164	Let's move on with a couple more news stories and then you guys can give us a call in a moment here.
9339324	9339585	Loki.
9340545	9345288	You remember a time when Sony's online network was hacked?
9346109	9347050	Pepperidge Farm remembers.
9348190	9350112	And Sony, they...
9352381	9354543	They basically got fined in the UK.
9355364	9363091	They had to pay a £250,000 fine and they were originally appealing it.
9363452	9366114	Now they decided they're going to withdraw that.
9366414	9369858	So after careful consideration, we are withdrawing our appeal.
9370178	9375343	This decision reflects our commitment to protecting the confidentiality of our network security from disclosures.
9375964	9383015	We continue to disagree with the decision on the merits.
9385720	9388845	They disagree, but they're going to pay for it.
9390427	9393268	We don't like this, but we'll do it anyway.
9393809	9407535	I'm wondering if they did appeal it that they would go, maybe there would be some sort of trial where information would come out about how shoddy their protection was and they didn't want that, so they decided to go ahead and pay the original settlement or something.
9407595	9408236	I don't know, whatever.
9409176	9409416	Cool.
9409876	9410477	Water in the bridge.
9411437	9411757	All right.
9413099	9416421	Although the entire gaming community had probably already forgotten about the hack.
9416501	9417182	Never forget.
9418343	9420825	I shouldn't say the entire community, but a big chunk of them.
9421425	9425268	Ragenator said, how about a show that combines wrestling, bronies, and furries?
9425909	9427891	And I said that sounds like really bad porn.
9427911	9430213	Would that be Dogpile?
9430453	9432274	It will air at 3 a.m.
9432394	9433375	on Tuesday morning.
9436218	9445246	All joking aside, as much as I say we're kind of full up on video game shows right now, I would love to see a Mega Man show.
9445306	9446687	I don't know, but anyway...
9455134	9465537	Mega Man is a diehard community, and the community makes a lot of great fan projects, and one of them is on its way out, Mega Man Revolution.
9465877	9466937	It's been in development since 2002.
9468598	9471378	It tries to recreate the magic of the NES games.
9471398	9473979	You can also, I guess, enable slowdown and so forth.
9474919	9476180	A lot of early reaction.
9476420	9477340	This game is too hard.
9478160	9478861	Thank you for watching!
9495663	9495783	Yay!
9519566	9520147	Appreciate it.
9520427	9524870	That doesn't mean to stop liking us on Facebook because the next goal would be, what would it be?
9524970	9525551	Probably like 5,730?
9526612	9529474	No, it would be 1,337.
9529774	9530535	Oh, okay.
9530575	9533377	That's an admirable goal.
9533397	9540222	And of course, Mega Man Revolution, I would mention that there is also Mega Man Unlimited, which was released today.
9541163	9543524	And you can download that at megafillx.com.
9545792	9548842	Is that Phil like a dude named Phil or Phil like F-I-L-L?
9549023	9550207	Phil like a dude named Phil.
9550368	9551291	Okay, cool.
9552853	9564318	Alrighty, I guess that is about it for the show, but we do want to take an opportunity to open up our Skype line for you guys to have your say on anything we've talked about tonight or maybe something we missed.
9564338	9573302	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word if you'd like to give us a call and we'll talk about whatever you'd like, within reason.
9574502	9578284	Let's get to some Twitter topics and last minute stories while we wait for those to come in.
9580014	9580635	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9599051	9606838	For example, there's one character that's a fish, a fish man, and all he can do is flop around.
9607739	9611863	Zombie Bride, Giant Preen Mantis, Average Run-of-the-Mill Old Man.
9613044	9614585	Yes, he's an old man who can't fight.
9614605	9615766	What about Middle-Aged Man?
9615866	9616987	And Female Paul.
9617207	9620190	Let me get to the phones, because the phones are ringing here.
9620811	9621691	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9621711	9622072	Who's this?
9623007	9623467	It's Jason.
9623688	9624268	Hey, Jason.
9624288	9624809	How you doing?
9624889	9625389	Hi, Jason.
9625429	9627271	Can we go back to Nostalgia Land?
9627571	9628632	Of course we can.
9629372	9630593	I love Nostalgia Land.
9630714	9637219	I was driving back from a friend's concert and you guys were talking and we're going to the mailbag and I was just driving along the highway just going, ah.
9639521	9640322	Yeah, right.
9640422	9640702	I know.
9640782	9644385	I want to build a house out of pixels in Nostalgia Land and live there.
9644425	9644865	A fort.
9645066	9647067	I will have my pixel fort in Nostalgia Land.
9647668	9649229	What do you want to talk about in Nostalgia Land?
9649249	9650050	What makes you nostalgic?
9650070	9650150	Ah.
9651089	9651810	Prop Cycle.
9652890	9653431	They had one!
9653711	9655252	Yes, Prop Cycle's awesome.
9655552	9656613	They had one.
9656693	9658755	Not in the Prop Cycle Addams Family, but they had a Prop Cycle.
9659395	9662638	Believe it or not, some of our listeners don't know what Prop Cycle is, so please explain it.
9664147	9666388	Prop Cycle was an exercise game.
9666528	9675909	Essentially, you sat on an exercise bike that had a two-handed flight stick, and you could tilt it forward, pull it back, obviously turn right and left.
9676989	9691432	You couldn't just crank the pedals continuously because the game... I think it was basically like exertion prevention built into the game, but you just pedaled persistently and flew around popping balloons and not crashing into things.
9692620	9693061	There you go.
9693281	9694402	And it was just a lot of fun to play.
9694462	9695523	It was so silly looking too.
9695563	9696384	It was so fun.
9696864	9702630	Rio Rancho, my hometown, doesn't actually have a mall still to this day.
9704091	9708435	The mall that got closest to us, Cottonwood Mall, is just on the other side of the city limit border.
9709737	9715142	But when that was first built up, the movie theater downstairs had a very tiny little arcade.
9715182	9715682	It had a...
9716343	9721606	Metal Slug, I want to say a Neo Geo Multicab, and a couple of other typical things.
9722107	9728591	But upstairs, for the first couple of years of that mall's existence, there was a divided laser tag?
9730207	9752610	a divided laser tag meaning that you can't cross into the other person's territory and it had Sega City and that was like with the exception of the roller rink that we used to go to when I was younger way the hell out in Albuquerque Sega City was like my personal arcade back in the day and that's where I played Prop Cycle and it was one of those things where whenever we would go I would play that and it
9753251	9753812	and DarkSakura.com.
9772928	9773068	Ugh.
9774409	9775430	But it was a great game.
9775510	9779593	I've literally never seen that in any other arcade to my mind, to my memory.
9779813	9783875	Don't they have, like, these weird hacks for Prop Cycle where they hook up Prop Cycle to other games?
9783996	9786797	Like, wouldn't there, like, even, like, a pinball game that ran off Prop Cycle?
9787538	9799786	As a matter of fact, my friends out here in Colorado, before I moved out here, hooked up a poppin' music of some sort to the proppin', uh, proppin', the Prop Cycle TV.
9799886	9801988	And it was called, they called, they dubbed it proppin' music.
9802028	9802608	That's awesome.
9803349	9807936	I never, I unfortunately wasn't up here for the occasion but I saw pictures and it was definitely amazing.
9808077	9808557	Good times.
9809499	9812664	There's one game, so I've never known the name of this game.
9812764	9812924	My...
9814318	9819743	My brain does really weird things when specific details of things go away.
9820023	9822425	And I wonder if you guys know this arcade game.
9823225	9826308	I seem to remember it in the roller skating rink that I used to go to as a kid.
9827969	9834515	Basically, what it boils down to is you play on... You're a character that runs around a...
9836276	9840178	Rollercoaster collecting cherries and you have to dodge the rollercoaster.
9840458	9843499	I've never been able to find the actual cars on the rollercoaster.
9843639	9845420	I've never been able to find this game.
9845480	9846621	Is that Mr. Dew's Wild Ride?
9847321	9849782	Mr. Dew's Wild Ride.
9849862	9850482	It sounds like it.
9850522	9852163	If you're collecting cherries, it's Mr. Dew.
9854212	9857835	Come on, Wikipedia, give me a screenshot and not just the box art.
9857875	9858755	No, the box art doesn't.
9859456	9865640	So, yeah, this is the thing that I kind of run into is that the image is ridiculously small.
9865740	9874587	I seem to remember it being very, very circular with ladders that connect you to the different portions where this looks like.
9874647	9875648	I'm almost positive.
9875668	9876008	Go to Google.
9876748	9877949	Check it out on Google.
9878529	9881571	Do a Google search.
9882251	9893676	It's so weird because my brain... Filling in the gaps now that I actually have game screenshots, this kind of seems to make sense.
9894477	9896858	But my brain remembers this game looking...
9898038	9899119	A little bit better, I guess?
9899960	9902242	A little bit newer than this actually is?
9902502	9905125	The resolution on old games is going to be itty-bitty.
9905725	9906346	Oh, of course.
9906406	9907827	Yeah, so I think that's part of it.
9907847	9908888	It's all about the raster.
9910210	9914894	The detail of this thing just seems... What I remember and what this looks like is entirely different.
9915034	9915274	Oh, wow.
9931233	9933314	I'm looking at Rob's image search.
9933334	9937155	It's like all these screen captures and then there's a really badly drawn cock.
9937715	9939216	It says you mad on it.
9940116	9941756	What does that have to do with Mr. Dew's wild ride?
9941796	9942177	I don't know.
9942497	9943497	Thank you, Google Images.
9943557	9944517	Thank you, Google Images.
9945117	9947078	That's what I get for turning safe search off.
9948458	9950059	No one wants to search safe.
9950219	9950639	Come on.
9950659	9953060	You can't have your search for cock interfered.
9955478	9956038	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9974833	9975913	I really want to play that again.
9996761	9997941	It was like a choose-your-game.
9998222	10005164	Yes, it was a choose-your-game, and you could play either Pac-Man or Dig Dug, and I want to say... I want to say they have one at the Roseville Dave & Buster's.
10005404	10005784	Really?
10006664	10007605	I want to say.
10008385	10009425	I know I've seen one.
10009465	10011086	I just want to know where I can get the name wrong.
10012146	10012786	Let's be real.
10013307	10014207	Anywhere, probably.
10014387	10016628	Well, I want to know what it's called, so I can get it.
10017388	10019369	I think it is like one of the anniversary editions.
10019409	10022150	I don't remember the name, but I know I've seen one, and I know I've played one.
10022990	10026291	Okay, I'll have to do some Google Foo on that, because I was thinking of that game earlier.
10028644	10032006	Anyhow, it was a nice trip down nostalgia lane, Jason.
10032026	10032286	It was.
10032766	10034267	It was a great 20 minutes.
10034467	10035728	A good way to kill my drive.
10035848	10036648	No problem.
10037289	10038630	That's what I appreciate about this show.
10038670	10040431	It's a great way to kill a long commuter drive.
10041191	10043992	I'm going to get to see you in a couple weeks, yes?
10045753	10048875	Perhaps not in Sacramento, I don't think.
10049075	10052017	I'm surprisingly busy considering how long I'm going to be out in the Bay Area.
10052057	10055819	But yes, I am definitely there for the upcoming con at the start of next month.
10056027	10073378	Yes, I know you'll be, even if you're not going to GamerX, you'll be in the area, and I'll be able to meet up with you there, which gives me another opportunity to promote the little panel deal-y going on Saturday at GamerX in San Francisco, August 3rd, I think it is the date.
10073838	10074559	It's that Saturday.
10075279	10084424	And I am doing a panel with my buddies from Koopa Club and Game Bar and Game Buoy.
10084945	10086525	And I know I'm leaving somebody else out.
10086565	10087786	So I apologize in advance.
10087866	10092229	But all us guys are getting together doing a podcast cross zone panel.
10092969	10095851	And we're just going to be talking about podcasting.
10096331	10100674	Our show is kind of how we got into it and trying to enable more people to get their voices heard.
10100774	10101254	So it'll be fun.
10103082	10103883	We'll have a gay old time.
10103903	10104923	It'll be a good time.
10104984	10105584	Gay meaning happy.
10106204	10111188	You need to take me to that place in Castro you were talking about earlier too.
10111308	10111648	Which place?
10111688	10112108	Hot Cookie?
10113829	10115170	No, the bar.
10116551	10117792	The pinball bar.
10118272	10123016	It's literally going to become that song that's you, I'm going to take you to a gay bar.
10125945	10127226	and I'm choking so have a good night guys.
10127366	10128086	Alright, bye Jason.
10128106	10130888	Thank you for mentioning hot cookie because now I want to go there.
10131088	10131389	Alright.
10132169	10133530	Let's go to another call on the line.
10133570	10134551	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10134571	10134931	Who's this?
10136452	10137653	Hi, this is Azurame.
10138313	10138933	Azurame.
10138993	10139774	Hey, what's on your mind, buddy?
10141155	10153723	I was just talking to one of my friends about the show and he actually came up and brought up the whole looking for a new show and we kind of do a show but it's kind of based off of like
10154096	10154836	Well, pimp your show.
10154957	10156317	I'm all about supporting indie shows.
10156337	10158178	Tell us where we can find it.
10180006	10184248	Okay, well, the name of the actual show is like Learning Japanese Through Music.
10185188	10194431	And we kind of, you can look on Facebook at facebook.com slash groups, Japanese Through Anime.
10194692	10197212	And you can probably see the page there you can actually add.
10197693	10200974	We have like Thursday nights, we have like a three hour show.
10202518	10205900	I don't know if anybody follows the new anime Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan.
10221260	10222661	That show is crazy.
10223162	10227405	Yeah, well, we broke down the show and, like, not the show, I'm sorry.
10227425	10233810	We broke down the song into, like, different parts and translated it, and then at the end of the show, we kind of, like, all sing, like, on Adobe Connect.
10234711	10242558	And, you know, we also have a meet-up that we also, some of the local people kind of speak, you know, we meet up in person and kind of sing at, like, karaoke bars, but...
10244383	10248785	I don't know why, but I love the idea that your show ends with karaoke.
10249005	10253488	I don't know a lot of shows that do that.
10253908	10255809	Maybe we need to do that here at OLR.
10255849	10261772	We end every night with a rousing rendition of So long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, good night.
10264534	10265454	Second the no.
10266515	10266915	Damn it.
10267715	10269937	I'm branching out and doing my own show.
10269957	10271898	The lag kind of throws people off.
10271938	10272198	Yeah.
10272659	10279801	It does give you a chance to learn a little bit more about the anime or the Japanese pop band that you're probably interested in.
10280101	10281781	And maybe a little few words of Japanese too.
10282461	10285942	Well, we do have a show about anime on the network called Anime Jam Session, which is a good time.
10285962	10288923	But it sounds like you have a different approach to the way you do it.
10288943	10289783	It sounds like a lot of fun.
10289883	10291083	I will have to check that out.
10292423	10293224	That sounds fun.
10293964	10298565	Shoot me an email, rob at vognetwork.com and we'll chat a little more.
10299265	10299425	Cool.
10299992	10301274	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10315092	10330815	and then I'm sitting there and I'm leveling I think I got to level 25 and I was doing the Totema dungeon this morning which is like I mean there's only one other dungeon in the beta after that and I just I I'm not gonna be able to have enough time to get to that but I yeah I've been playing the shit out of that beta it's a lot of fun
10332717	10333277	That's cool.
10333417	10334298	Okay, great.
10334678	10341501	I was wondering if you guys had a little group on here that might be doing some sort of free company LOR.
10341781	10343221	We don't have a link shell yet.
10343722	10345702	I actually made one.
10346103	10347923	Link shells are really just chat channels.
10348443	10352305	The free companies are really the guilds a la WoW or whatever.
10352865	10354806	There will absolutely be something like that.
10354926	10357127	At least Horde House is going to lead one somewhere.
10358308	10361709	I will have more information on that when we know the full server list.
10362009	10367414	Right now we're on Behemoth, but that could change for Phase 4, but we're going to commit to something soonish here.
10367735	10370638	We just want to figure out where our frenzies are going to be and try to pick the best server.
10371616	10372577	Cool, cool, okay.
10372657	10376659	All right, so I'll just continue to just chime in on the network and find out more.
10376799	10380101	We will whore the shit out of it here on OLR once the game's out.
10380882	10381182	Awesome.
10381482	10381642	Awesome.
10381662	10382183	All right, guys.
10382403	10382683	All right.
10382983	10383684	Well, you take care, buddy.
10383724	10384444	Good luck with your show.
10384604	10385225	Adobe Connect.
10385665	10394871	I have not heard... You know, Adobe Connect, I know because during my day job, I'm a corporate trainer, so I've used Adobe Connect in meetings of that sort, but I've never heard of doing...
10395271	10424715	a podcast through Adobe Connect but I'm thinking about it going well it makes sense it would work why not right it's kind of it's very similar to Google Hangout in many ways so yeah besides the payments I mean unfortunately it's kind of expensive like $80 a month and you get a chance to utilize like some of the tools like talking through a chat menu controlling the desktop and even like passing the microphone or the camera to someone else in the chat you know it's just it's a little bit more interactive I think that maybe uh
10426112	10428494	If we moved to something like this, we'd probably be dying.
10429775	10430315	Good times.
10430696	10431196	All right, buddy.
10431216	10432257	Well, thanks for the call.
10432337	10433038	Good luck with your show.
10433198	10435039	And we'll talk to you again here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10435680	10435900	Thanks.
10436180	10437942	All right, later.
10437962	10441524	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10441644	10442625	I just got a tweet.
10443206	10445628	I love the interactiveness of the show.
10445648	10446548	I just got a tweet from...
10447489	10457471	Gaming Nerd who goes by GNVersion2 on Twitter that says Namco Classic Collection Volume 2 is a collection featuring Pac-Man, Dig Dug, and Rally-X.
10457591	10459051	I think that was, yes, the other game.
10459452	10461972	In both original and arrangement versions.
10462012	10464233	Hold on, I'm Googling this right now to see if it's what I remember.
10464733	10467053	Somebody help me fill time while I ask for more calls.
10467213	10468513	I probably have that at home, you know.
10469034	10470134	That Namco Collection.
10473114	10475775	Well, I mean the ones that they released at home, but...
10476535	10480137	Yeah, I think I do remember that one because that was it.
10480197	10481478	Yes, this is it.
10481578	10483119	This is totally what I was thinking of.
10483539	10484319	You win a cookie.
10485580	10489502	I don't know how to... I'm going to shove a cookie through Twitter and I hope it made it in one piece.
10489562	10490582	That is exactly the game I was thinking of.
10490622	10492543	That person probably already has lots of cookies on their computer.
10493304	10493904	Probably.
10495085	10496606	Yes, that is exactly the game I was thinking of.
10496646	10497766	I'm looking at these screenshots.
10497786	10501188	I remember this whole little one with Pac-Man in the temple and with the little jumps.
10501728	10501988	Yep.
10503129	10504189	You, sir, are a win.
10504229	10504590	Thank you.
10505650	10508453	And next, hook me up with a link for a ROM.
10510355	10510635	All right.
10512176	10514298	Love the interactiveness here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10514338	10515519	Let's go to the tweets.
10515539	10517481	That was on my personal Twitter, but you know what?
10518562	10521685	Sometimes I'm going to bring up personal stuff on the show because I had to know what game that was.
10522545	10527249	Let's go to tweets that went to the OLR account and then Loki, I'll go over to you for some more last minute stories.
10527609	10532013	Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio if you want to get in on the show.
10532874	10538718	SSJ100Matt sent us a tweet that says there's a Kickstarter to help open the largest pinball museum in Southern California too.
10539078	10541701	You know I got a text message on this.
10541741	10545484	Melody sent me a text on this and I think...
10546348	10546988	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10570965	10580332	in fact I've been to the one in Las Vegas before they moved to their newer location and the one in Las Vegas has a pinball circus and all kinds of machines you just don't see anywhere
10585009	10590733	DJ Ranma sent us a link about Xbox One gets booed out of Evo while demoing Killer Instinct.
10591614	10591834	Ouch.
10592975	10594036	This doesn't sound good.
10594076	10595457	I'm trying to bring up the story right now.
10596178	10599180	I don't know if the booing is just sensationalism or what.
10599801	10600762	But let's see.
10600822	10601402	Apparently...
10603362	10603943	Fucking ads.
10604163	10605544	I'm having a hard time bringing this up on my phone.
10607606	10608106	Let's see.
10608206	10616913	The Double Helix and Mad Catz guys were at Evo to pimp fight stick accessories and Killer Instinct, which of course was originally shown at E3.
10616933	10616993	And...
10621661	10627584	A lot of hostility, I guess, shown at the event, even though the gameplay for Killer Instinct looked pretty good, and there's a video on there.
10629205	10641010	But then it says the crowd was moderately accepting of Killer Instinct, but the fact that they were booing the Xbox One at such a core event like Evo 2013 speaks volumes about what gamers actually feel about the console.
10641871	10642951	These weren't casuals.
10643011	10645753	These weren't grandpas and grandmas buying consoles for little Timmy.
10646033	10647133	These are the big Timmy's.
10647654	10647894	Hmm.
10648254	10650275	This story from cinemablend.com.
10650735	10653297	So it just sounds like a few angry mobsters.
10654197	10657219	I don't know how much... I don't know.
10658980	10664763	It sounds like there were just a few angry gaming nerds there and they unfortunately got picked up by the media.
10666252	10667133	Ooh, I heard about this.
10667253	10669276	SJ100Matt is also sending us this tweet.
10669756	10672059	Even I'm excited about this, and this says a lot.
10672760	10680469	NHL 14, you know, hockey, is going to have an NHL 94 mode, which is like one of the best games ever, right?
10680750	10683593	Complete with original sound effects, controls, and visuals.
10685154	10685975	You know what's sad?
10686015	10688656	That's totally going to sell tons of copies in that game.
10688996	10691598	Because NHL 94 is one of the best sports games ever.
10692018	10696960	Now, before I give you all those concessions, I'm going to say this.
10697120	10699021	NHL 94 is no Blades of Steel.
10700322	10701122	But it's still pretty cool.
10702563	10704064	I know a lot of people disagree with me there.
10704964	10709586	AJ Twist wanted to alert us to the Ultra Street Fighter 4 game as well.
10710627	10710707	Um...
10712936	10720379	Actdeft is tweeting us about Main6 who created Fighting is Magic is posting progress on their new game.
10720699	10725221	Didn't they have to do something where they took the license out of it and now it's like a different type of game?
10726501	10728782	So I'm trying to scan through the update here real quick.
10731103	10733404	What, did they just change the horses basically?
10733424	10733504	Yeah.
10736361	10737622	Magical Horse Fighting Game
10760797	10764642	I'm sure if Actdeft had something else he wants me to mention on that, he'll yell it in chat real quick.
10765003	10773614	But while I'm waiting for that, I will mention Tigerclaw's tweet here that says, Valve introduces Pipeline, a program for teens seeking careers in the game industry.
10774275	10774836	That's pretty cool.
10777329	10778730	I'm trying to read more about this here.
10779190	10779590	I get it.
10779690	10780751	Valve, Pipeline.
10780931	10781291	Get it?
10781371	10781651	Get it?
10783932	10793016	Pipeline is an experiment to see if we can take a group of high school students with minimal work experience and train them in the skills and methods necessary to be successful at a company like Valve.
10793717	10800780	There's nothing there yet besides a video and an FAQ, but hopefully that's going to change in the near future, especially as we get into the new school year, right?
10800800	10800880	Yeah.
10801420	10812134	Here we will teach them to make two highly critical games and then delay the third one forever, thus building infinite anticipation for said sequel.
10812334	10814177	Yes, these high schoolers will be working on Half-Life 3.
10817024	10818265	The next Half-Life 3.
10818485	10824130	Ranma in chat helping to clear up some about the Fighting is Magic new game.
10825031	10830955	Lauren Faust is creating new characters for the game on the Skullgirls engine that they got for free after the Kickstarter.
10831396	10832396	Now I remember that.
10832436	10832957	That's right.
10833337	10841183	Even though they couldn't use those characters, the creator was going to make new characters, and then the folks behind Skullgirls were really into it.
10841303	10845527	They're apparently bronies over there at Skullgirls, so...
10846147	10846747	That's pretty cool.
10849248	10852028	Congrats to all you fans who are going to be in that game.
10852088	10854029	I'm sure you guys will be excited about that.
10854609	10855669	One last call for calls.
10855689	10859510	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10860310	10863431	I'll check in with Loki one more time and see if there's any other last minute stories or what have you.
10863671	10864191	I have nothing.
10864631	10864952	Nothing?
10864992	10865992	Yeah, that's it for tweets too.
10866972	10867812	We running out of show?
10867992	10869693	Must be time to stick a nail in it.
10869853	10871374	Alright, I guess we're done.
10871394	10872954	The skyline's not ringing.
10873154	10874174	It's over!
10874615	10876255	Sorry to those that didn't get through.
10876575	10880317	But, well, I guess maybe I missed you when I was on another call.
10880357	10880657	I don't know.
10880997	10882157	But you can always email us.
10882217	10884178	Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio.
10884198	10885798	Or Skype could just be working.
10885878	10886539	Yeah, that's true.
10886559	10886999	Like Skype.
10888860	10895505	Mailbag at Orangelongerator.com Jason in our chatroom is piping up saying, Pipeline isn't going to teach them to make games.
10895986	10899048	It's going to teach them to make hats, cards, and other trinkets.
10899628	10903752	You know, this is becoming a more and more popular thing in high schools to take a more trade school approach.
10904112	10909696	And I honestly, you know, from somebody who just, I've been open about this on the show before.
10910237	10911158	I didn't finish college.
10912359	10916482	The reason why is because the industry I was studying at the time was radio and television.
10917043	10931435	After interning at a TV station and doing all this stuff in the past, I just felt like I wasn't really going to be happy doing that stuff.
10933097	10937441	This show is kind of a byproduct of what I did get out of college, which I'm very thankful for.
10938541	10941842	But otherwise, I went into the working world and just worked my way up.
10941922	10947624	And I think being able to expose high schoolers to those really entry-level job skills, I think is a great thing for some people.
10947864	10949025	And I'm not knocking college.
10949085	10951105	College is a great thing for some people.
10951506	10952466	It just wasn't for me.
10952726	10959668	I honestly wish that for a lot of fields, especially the one that I'm in, that it didn't go so much from paying the $50,000 for college
10962029	10966452	and went more into, you know, an apprenticeship type environment.
10966952	10972375	You know, not an unpaid internship because to me that just seems like some form of required slavery.
10973255	10978678	But, you know, I think that it should work on, I mean, yeah, you need to go to college.
10978818	10983901	Like for me, yeah, going to take art history, going to take anatomy, going to take things are all helpful.
10984521	10990206	But I think when it comes to actually the industry type of job, it should be one-on-one working with somebody.
10990966	10997211	You know, some type of, you know, you work as an apprentice, you become a journeyman, you know, like back in the day.
10998973	11002396	Anyhow, so I don't want people to misunderstand what we're trying to like say here.
11002816	11003977	OLR is anti-college.
11003997	11004717	No, that's not it.
11004778	11005318	It's just, you know.
11005538	11006619	I'm having fun at college.
11006819	11007119	Yeah.
11007159	11008521	But I'm not going to a four-year yet.
11009982	11011783	So there's many different ways to learn.
11013684	11017125	Anyhow, that about does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
11017665	11023267	I really want to thank you guys for tuning in tonight and supporting the show and supporting independent podcasting.
11023287	11026987	If you like what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or five about the show.
11027067	11029948	Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio and help grow our family.
11029988	11031408	We really appreciate it.
11031909	11033749	Bradley, thank you very much for being here tonight.
11033949	11036710	We didn't get to hear a whole lot from you tonight, but I hope you had fun here on the show.
11036850	11037490	Sure, it was good.
11037850	11039730	And feel free to pop back in any time.
11039770	11040911	It's always a pleasure to have you on.
11041491	11041851	Yep, yep.
11042151	11046473	Next time we'll play a game or something you can actually have a little bit more of a say in or something.
11046873	11050474	But see you hopefully in less than six months.
11050674	11051294	Don't be a stranger.
11051955	11053495	Any final thoughts you want to get out for the listeners?
11056436	11060318	Well, after this show I'm going to probably go see Pacific Rim because that looks pretty cool.
11061158	11066980	And it is a goddamn travesty that that fucking Adam Sandler movie outpaced Pacific Rim.
11067020	11067961	I'm so angry.
11068221	11069841	There's so much wrong with America.
11070642	11070742	Ugh.
11071983	11074464	Unfortunately, they did not cancel the apocalypse.
11075264	11075404	Ugh.
11076544	11076984	Horrible.
11077685	11078005	Anyway.
11078025	11080265	Yeah, because there are a lot of dumb people.
11080786	11082766	So, more people need to go see Pacific Rim.
11083586	11086507	Do you have anything you want to... You don't really have, like, a Twitter or anything.
11086547	11088888	Do you have any websites you want to pimp or promote while you're here?
11088908	11090148	You don't really have any of that stuff, do you?
11090168	11094290	The only thing I really have that's game-related is, like, I have a backloggery thing.
11095310	11095470	Okay.
11095530	11099131	I don't really have loads of people on that other than someplace, but...
11100936	11104199	That's a pretty cool place if you want to list your games, but it takes forever to put them in there.
11104219	11106981	Because if they don't have any drop-down, you have to put it in yourself.
11107161	11110463	It tells me to keep up with the million things I'm playing.
11110824	11113145	I have like 400 plus, let me wear it.
11113726	11114126	400 plus?
11115387	11116248	483 unfinished games.
11117008	11117689	Oh my god.
11117769	11118690	And I bought more already.
11119971	11124774	You can really see how far behind you and how much crap you have on Steam and everything.
11124834	11127997	Does it make a competition out of who can catch up on their backlog more?
11128617	11129518	Does it give you trading cards?
11129978	11130579	No, no.
11130699	11136504	They do have little icons that show up depending on what you've finished.
11137966	11141349	I'm confused because I have played 10 plus games at once.
11143951	11144692	That sounds like me.
11145593	11147514	Alright, well thanks again for being here and we'll see you soon.
11148595	11150057	I guess we'll go to DarkSakura.
11150377	11151258	What's your final thought tonight?
11152279	11155582	My final thought is I wish I had ice cream.
11157510	11161833	My final thought tonight is, well, maybe we can give you a Greek yogurt bar.
11161873	11162794	I mean, it's not ice cream.
11162914	11163695	That's okay.
11164055	11164515	Thank you, though.
11164595	11165276	Thought we'd offer.
11166336	11173802	My other final thought is, Shane is trying to course me into doing a Let's Play tonight on one of the streaming sites, so be looking for that.
11174122	11177084	He wants me to play a game called Slender Man, which is a scary game.
11177104	11179245	I want to play that.
11179606	11180726	Why are you laughing over there?
11180827	11181447	That would be funny.
11181927	11186253	So apparently that's going to happen later on, but I do have to work tomorrow, so we can't go too late.
11186533	11187394	But stay tuned.
11187995	11190558	Once I get the show up, if I have some time, I'll maybe go to that.
11190578	11191819	You should just play Surgeon Simulator.
11191839	11193501	I mean, it's just as funny.
11193701	11193901	Is it?
11193961	11199007	And everybody should buy Surgeon Simulator if you haven't yet, 2013, because it's just...
11199588	11200089	and DarkSakura.
11214847	11231366	DarkSakura has her own channel and I want to be able to do things that don't necessarily have the OLR name attached to it just because you know I don't want to be OLRs for all of us so we'll have like maybe hopefully I'm hoping we can bring the webcam back streaming the shows in the future and so forth but there you go
11232006	11248489	uh Codeman says can you record it please uh I I'm gonna try I don't want to promise tonight I feel like I should do a test run of something else tonight and then do Slender Man but I am I am very interested in getting into the YouTube scene of Let's Play I'll leave it at that
11248777	11253781	I know that the program that you were using before and the one that I'm using still automatically records.
11253921	11254282	Oh, nice.
11254302	11258285	I just have to make sure I don't have performance suffering because of it, but I should.
11258305	11258585	We'll see.
11259666	11262689	Okay, Loki, your last, your final thought tonight.
11264030	11265451	I wish I had no headache.
11266492	11267413	Aw, you want some Ibuprofen?
11267673	11269014	No, I'm gonna go home and take some.
11269034	11269795	Alright, feel better.
11270526	11272369	Alright, that does it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
11272409	11274453	Thank you guys for tuning in and supporting the show.
