27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	43000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this, episode 512, July the 14th of 2013.
43000	53000	How you guys doing out there? Live at live.vognetwork.com. We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
53000	63000	And we always love it when you can come out and participate live with the show, but if you're listening on the podcast feed, be it through iTunes, through Stitcher, through whatever it is you use to listen to podcasts, a big thank you to you guys as well.
63000	70000	Always appreciate your support of indie podcasting. So let's talk about games. My name is Rob Roberts and we'll talk games tonight with DarkSakura.
70000	79000	Me. How are you? Me. Me? Oh, you're MII because you have your 3DS open right now. Yeah, I actually feel like I've been to the gym.
79000	89000	Yeah? Because like I walked around all day yesterday, which I'm sure we'll get to, but like my butt hurts like I've been on the elliptical. That's hot.
89000	101000	Everyone knows the elliptical butt hurt, I'm hoping. And if not, then imagine walking uphill for a long time. And that's the elliptical butt hurt as well. I am literally butt hurt.
101000	109000	The show hasn't even started. Is your butt nice and firm DarkSakura? And speak slowly when you respond.
109000	120000	Yeah. Also say hello to, and I don't know how firm his butt is, but let's say hi to tech master Loki. Hi. How are you doing?
120000	128000	Doing fine. Probably not that firm when you get two cheeseburgers at McDonald's, but today you have Subway. You go in the Jared diet or what's up with this?
128000	139000	No, no diet. I just got sick of eating cheeseburgers. It's fair. I've actually been trying to eat better. I've been doing like more salads at work. Like I don't like go out and get fast food.
139000	152000	How are you liking the candy bar? Shut up. I was going to get to that. I do have Friday as a cheat day and I was like, ah, I can't even like like chicken McNuggets don't even sound good. So I think that's a good thing. Right? Like when the really bad food starts to like so bad.
153000	169000	But then DarkSakura, this bitch shows up and brings candy bars to the show and not, they're not just any candy bars. They're crunch bars with girl scout cookie mix or something in them. Cause basically she brought me Samoas. Basically candy bar form.
169000	178000	But if you read the label, they are less bad for you than a serving of Samoas. Oh cool. The entire package is 190 calories. Cool. Can I have two? Yes, you can have two.
179000	192000	Bitch, if you want to eat it, then sure. I will just do some butt firming. Just dance for after the show too. Oh my God. I had the worst Mongolian barbecue last night. Never go to Sue's Mongolian barbecue in Santa Clara.
192000	206000	Oh, okay. Girl, first mistake. You went to Mongolian barbecue in the Bay area. No. Yet to find a good place. No. Dance said that they had a really good place that they went to last year. Okay. And so we thought we were going there, but they went to a different place and it was nasty.
206000	216000	But I mean they had some really good orange chicken that wasn't hot. It was more like sweet and sour orangey chicken and it was pretty good, but I got so sick and then I had to go drink to forget about it.
216000	223000	It was so bad that I had to, I had to drink and then I played drunk 2DX, which was great.
223000	234000	Look, I want to introduce a guest that doesn't drive us to drink out of anger, but we might have a drink with him because he's a good friend of the show and he's, he's been here on and off for really the past 12 years.
234000	247000	Hopefully you recognize this name, even though he hasn't been here in a while. Say hello. Welcome back. Bradley is here. Hello. How's it going? Arkadian42, if you rather. Yes. Is that still your screen name all these years later? Yes, it is. Awesome. Still going that way.
247000	259000	Howdy. How you doing? I'm doing okay. What's new with you? Catch us up on the past year since you've been on the show. Well, it was about six months ago. Okay, six months ago. I haven't done too much different. I went to California Extreme and I saw Dan, but I didn't see Jamie at all.
259000	275000	So I was actually hanging out in the Bamani Corner for quite a while and then I hung up playing Metallica for quite a while. Yeah, I played that one. Did you get to play it? Yeah, I played it a few times. Did you get to play Wizard of Oz? No, I saw it, but I didn't have time. Did you see like the horde around Wizard of Oz? I got to touch it.
275000	287000	Yeah, there was a fair number of people and I kind of looked at it and watched someone playing it right before I left. I have a video of the gameplay and I was planning on posting it tonight and reposting it to the Orange Lounge Tumblr.
287000	299000	Alright, we got to back up a minute here because I wanted to talk about this at the start of the show anyway. You guys, both you guys, I didn't get to go, Logie didn't go. You guys are both at this thing that they do in the Bay Area every year called California Extreme, right? It was quite extreme.
299000	317000	So what, for those that don't know, because they do have an international audience, what is California Extreme? California Extreme is basically a bunch of pinball tables and a bunch of classic arcade games and a couple of new ones here and there. Like I said, there was a 2DX and a couple of DDRs and a BeatMania 3.
317000	334000	And also it's where a lot of pinball vendors, which the number is kind of dwindling now, but parts vendors will come. You know, people sell like, I almost bought a Bionic Woman lunchbox like from when I was an infant. I was so close. So anyway, it's just a big...
334000	335000	And lunchbox.
335000	353000	No, no I didn't. I ended up not. And people, there's documentaries they do there. They do panels. Like we went to this one that was called Galaxy Game where they were talking about the old space fight game and how they programmed it and how much a computer cost in 1971. $13,000.
353000	354000	Yeah.
354000	355000	Yeah, it was expensive.
355000	358000	It talks about having 8K of RAM and how wonderful it was.
359000	366000	It was just a really neat event, you know, and I ran into like tons of people I know that I never see.
366000	370000	So it's like a celebration of classic gaming with like a splash of modern gaming.
370000	371000	Yeah.
371000	375000	It's basically if Bobby Black Wolf Show were an expo, right?
375000	395000	Well, it's also, you know, all these games are on free play on top of it. And it's, Stern comes out every year and brings like their top new tables. And so there was like an Avengers there. There was an X-Men. There was ACDC. There was the new Metallica table with all the three different types of back glass on it.
396000	415000	And it was just really a lot of fun. And of course, man, I feel so bad because the guy who owns this Big Bang bar, actually no, he I think sold it to the convention finally, a Big Bang bar prototype, which was like one of Capcom's last tables they produced.
416000	429000	It's really beat. It's in rotten shape. It needs to be shopped. But the thing now is that you can get repro parts for it because they've actually there's a person reproducing the Big Bang bar table and kingpin. They had a kingpin there, too.
429000	439000	And then there were like the Gottlieb tables that were all like Miami Heat instead of Miami Vice and Raven instead of Rambo. You know, all these little knockoff titles because they couldn't get licensing.
440000	453000	And, you know, Data East tables that are always kind of between cheeseball and awesome. There's the Super Mario mushroom world there. You know, I love that one. Yeah. And it was broken when I tried to play it. And then all these other people who are taller than me were trying to play like, dude, I'm actually the right size.
453000	467000	And then there was this game that had like it's like called Alley Cat or something that had trash cans and they lift up. It's a little kid's ball game. Oh, yeah. Melody and I were there, got on our knees and we're just throwing balls and balls and balls and balls at it.
467000	481000	So you got on your knees and we're playing with balls and cats, balls and pussy. Okay. Just just make it sure we're all busy. All right. Good times. Bradley, were you on your knees playing with balls at some point? Oh, not really your thing.
482000	500000	I didn't go on these, but I did play that little the Super Mario one, the small title. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Because like Mario had like a kid's table and an adult table. Right. Yeah. Because they were right next to each other. They did have one that was on adult size legs. Yeah. But it was just to display the LEDs.
501000	512000	Okay. That might have been something different, but there was two next to the little one and the other one. I know because one of them does the I don't know the complete name of it, but it's one that I had like there was an arcade near my high school that had it.
512000	518000	We're not an arcade. Actually, Ice Rink had it and I went there and played it every so often. Oh, it's a good fun one.
518000	534000	Um, I was just gonna say about California extreme. It's not really just the games either. You because you run into a lot of people. Right. Which is what ticks me off. Why I couldn't go because you ran into like tons of people blast from the past from the DDR days. Right. Yeah.
534000	548000	Yeah. Like, uh, ran into, uh, Richard ran into, uh, sell Chris Tang, which you see Chris Tang at every event that has the money. Um, uh, ran into, uh, Ali, I ran into, um, Wendell, of course.
548000	559000	And, uh, Chris from DDR freak back in the day, he actually arrived late at night. Like I'm in the middle of playing the song and then I end the song. Next thing I know, I'm like in this bear hug. It was awesome. That's cool.
559000	576000	So it was kind of like a little mini con. Yeah, pretty much. And then it's a lot of, you know, because a lot of us who, you know, started off back in the day, we're all grown up. So we were going out, you know, drinking in the, cause there's like a little bar in the front of the Hyatt and you know, $15 lemon drop.
577000	592000	So we're actually out there having our adult fruit, fruit drinks and talking about games. Is it more of an adult convention? Like I'm not talking, there was some kids there, but a lot of people, you know, there was, there was some teenagers, there were some little kids there, but a lot of people really were just older gamers.
593000	604000	I bet a lot of those were like people bringing their kids too, or like they were bringing themselves and brought their kids. There were a few. Yeah. Like I actually met a guy from Folsom who has like a pretty sizable private collection and he brought his daughter.
604000	616000	Nice. We actually ended up hanging out at a table just chatting about collections versus buying a house. Cause that's what Dan and I were trying to do. Did you get more listeners for VOG while you were there? I did pimp us out.
616000	626000	Okay, good. And there's some people I'm sorry, I've forgotten to put you, uh, uh, on my Facebook, but hi, it was great to meet you. And I met a friend of Kyle Snyder.
626000	631000	What the hell has he been doing? I'm sorry. No idea, but I said I'd give him a shout out. So hi.
631000	646000	I know like we have like more listeners now than we did back in the DDR day. And like none of you people know who Kyle Snyder was, but for those that do epic freestyle and he actually what didn't he debut a single here on this show like years ago.
646000	655000	And I've always wondered what happened to that kid. I'm not even kidding. Like, Oh God, no, it was one of the best of the dark Tetsuya put together, had his premiere in it.
655000	665000	And I was listening to like, yes, I was listening to my own show while I was driving to Disneyland cause I'm such a narcissist. Well, no, I, I, I wanted to hear the best of the dark Tetsuya put together.
665000	680000	And I heard the Kyle Snyder segment and I was like, what happened to that kid? What happened? I mean, he's gotta be like 30 now, right? Maybe if I'm 35, that guy's gotta be 30 last I heard, you know, he went on his Mormon mission and that's, you know, that's a two year commitment.
681000	702000	So people sometimes disappear after that. So amazing. I just thought it was, you know, pretty, uh, pretty interesting, you know, running into people who knew people that I knew and, you know, especially, and I spent all day on my, uh, my, uh, DS checking where I tagged people from and running into people who screen names.
702000	714000	I recognize and like going, I want to send them a message, find me shit, you know, but yeah, you should be able to like add friends from that or at least, or at least like send a message.
714000	726000	You know, I wanted to, I actually did tag him twice and I could have sent him a message, but it was toward the end of the night and he wouldn't have gotten my message. So whatever you're having fun with your three DS. This is only the second week you've had it.
726000	744000	I swear everybody. Oh yeah, I have, I'm already, I've already got, let's see, I've expanded my house. I bought my house, expanded it twice, bought my upstairs, expanded it once and I have my basement now. I'm paying for my dream suites. I'm getting club lol and Blathers wants to expand my, uh, my museum.
744000	759000	You're, you're on it and animal crossing. Fuck yeah. Awesome. It's cause I go to the island and pick fruit instead of doing the little, uh, games and then go sell my fruit and then I do it like five times in a day. That's how to do it. That's how to do it. I'm making money. It's 80 style.
759000	772000	All right, let me go back to Bradley, our guest Bradley. You had fun at California stream. Were you there Friday and Saturday or just Saturday or no, just Saturday. There's a Saturday Sunday convention. So why don't I think it was three days? I thought it was just to gotcha.
772000	785000	Um, what, what, what kinds of games you've been playing the past year or six months you beaten anything lately or, uh, rogue, rogue Alexi was the last thing I beat. That was a pretty cool game. Bobby was just talking about that on his show.
785000	797000	That's the one where like it's the Metroid Castlevania game where you play descendants of the hero. Yeah. So basically you go through the castle and you're collecting, basically you're collecting money as you go through it and then trying to beat the bosses and stuff.
797000	809000	And, uh, as you get more money and once you, you die after a while, cause it's, the enemies are kind of hard and it's easy to, to all the spikes and all that kind of stuff. So once you die, you basically build up your castle.
809000	826000	Basically, uh, as you upgrade, you get different options and, uh, you get new options for what children can be and like runes and things like that to basically expand your gameplay and help you along, get you more HP, more MP and, and other, other options like that.
826000	837000	And then then you keep trying over and over again for hundreds of times. Um, yeah, I saw this game on steam and I wanted to get it, but it is not part of the, and we'll obviously have to talk about this.
837000	845000	The steam sale going on right now, which has many people's attentions, but it's still worth it outside the, the lack of sale price, right?
845000	850000	Yeah. Actually I did see it on sale for like $2 off or something like that. Not, not too big of a deal, but.
850000	851000	Well that's something.
851000	854000	Yeah. So I bought it at $15 and that's well worth the price.
854000	860000	That's no like Tomb Raider for 12 bucks or Borderlands 2 for 10, but that's, that's still a pretty good deal.
860000	869000	Yeah. And you can play this for hours and hours. Some people can beat it pretty fast. That took me like 22 hours just cause I took a lot of time exploring the castle each time and didn't try to kill the bosses really early.
869000	875000	So, and then there's new fame plus and you can just keep going and going as much as you want.
875000	878000	Nice. That sounds like a fun time.
878000	893000	Another big game was playing Animal Crossing. I've been playing that shit loads. Basically I'm already up to 85 hours in the game. Like man, it just takes so much time. There's so many different things to do. Like it takes like two hours a day to, to when you're starting out.
893000	894000	That's all?
894000	899000	Yeah. Well, I've spent more than that. Like on the Island days, if you go to Island.
899000	906000	I fell off the wagon y'all. I stopped playing Animal Crossing. I just couldn't take that investment anymore. I'm just like, it's too much. I have to do it every day.
906000	918000	And part of it too is that it's a slow process. Like if I could just open up my 3DS and be in my town, yay, I'd be there. But it's like, you got to open it up, load the game, wait for the game, wait for the thing to load your town.
918000	923000	Then you got to make sure you save and quit. Are you going to get Mr. Aceti? It's just kind of like, it takes too fucking long to get in there.
923000	924000	True.
924000	925000	No, I don't think so.
925000	926000	I do.
926000	940000	Yeah. But it is a lot of time investment to do a bunch of things. Yeah. And basically the, the message boards I go at, we're basically have loads of front people that are messing each other and getting, swapping items and all that stuff.
940000	941000	Okay.
941000	943000	So basically I've gotten a lot of stuff.
943000	944000	Well, nice.
944000	945000	Almost done with the house.
945000	953000	Well, you will get my small pitiful house in your, in Plaza now since we, I see the green light on my 3DS. So there you go.
953000	961000	And other games, FTL was a big game that I played a lot of, and I played that this week, uh, to, for the trading card thing.
961000	963000	And you got sucked into that trading card thing too?
963000	982000	I don't know. I don't know about the trading yet, actually doing the trading cause that seems like a ton of annoyingness, but I did play that and a bit of Meat Boy, Super Meat Boy, and haven't played too many other games that were in that thing that this trading card so far.
982000	984000	Well, they're adding new ones every day.
984000	997000	Yeah. Cause I probably go play, I want to pay Portal and Portal 2 again to, cause I haven't played them on Steam yet, so I could see them in other than 720p and watch them in 1080 or however good they are on, for the Steam version.
997000	999000	So I might do that pretty soon.
999000	1000000	Awesome.
1001000	1012000	And another big thing right now is those new, the new Meat Plaza games. Basically they just released those last week, and you can basically get the bundle for 15 bucks of all four of them.
1012000	1029000	And basically, I think at the right, at the beginning, near the beginning of, of, of Extreme, the California Extreme yesterday, I almost spent an hour standing off right near the entrance doing the updates for those, or doing the, doing those games.
1029000	1037000	Doing, cause basically you can, for each new game you can take all the 10 tags that you have and take them through each game. So that takes a lot.
1037000	1047000	Yeah, that's not for convention play. You know what I mean? Like that's just too many people. Like, but that's, for, for when you occasionally street pass on people, I think that's a good, good thing to do.
1047000	1049000	They need to let you hold more than 10 people in the buffer though.
1049000	1050000	That would be nice.
1050000	1052000	That would be nice. For conventions.
1052000	1057000	Yeah, that was annoying cause then I think I'd be done and then like, nope, more people.
1057000	1059000	Imagine when I was at E3.
1059000	1062000	Oh yeah. I'm just waiting until my next Disneyland trip.
1062000	1075000	Disneyland's not as bad. I mean, you will fill it up partway through the day. So you want to check a couple of times a day and it's going to be harder with these four new games because now it's like, now I got to play this, the fantasy zone game.
1075000	1089000	Now I got to play the kingdom game and whatever. It's, it's a lot. So I think, I think I kind of have to pick my battles and which, which game do I really want to progress on the most? And for me, that's the puzzle trading to get the little 3d pictures.
1089000	1090000	I did finish two puzzles.
1090000	1091000	Did you? Congrats.
1091000	1092000	Good.
1092000	1099000	Yeah. They just opened up two new ones right when I was like, I was within like 40 pieces of having everything and now two new puzzles.
1099000	1100000	Just these four new puzzles.
1100000	1101000	Bastard. Really?
1101000	1102000	Yes.
1102000	1103000	Oh my God.
1105000	1106000	Jerks.
1106000	1107000	All right. Fair enough.
1108000	1116000	Um, well, I guess I've been blurring the line here a little bit between trying to interview Bradley and getting to our gaming weeks, but one thing I wanted to bring up was steam sale.
1116000	1119000	I'm sure you guys listening to this show can't avoid it.
1119000	1123000	What is it about the steam sale that gets everybody in the gaming community talking?
1123000	1126000	I guess it's probably them prices, right?
1126000	1129000	The fact that, uh, you know, what is it today right now?
1129000	1132000	Tomb Raider as of the taping of the show, 12 bucks.
1132000	1135000	Actually, that was yesterday's deal, but they, they last for 48 hours, right?
1135000	1141000	Uh, borderlands two for $10 and the season pass another $10 a really cheap stuff.
1141000	1148000	And then of course, valve trying to sweeten the pot a little bit by this whole new thing with the trading cards.
1148000	1155000	And now they've incorporated that into the sale where you get trading cards for voting, which Ooh, it's after six o'clock.
1155000	1158000	I got to go vote on what game is next. Get my, I'll do my later.
1158000	1165000	But, uh, yeah, they get the cards through that or by spending money or by crafting badges.
1165000	1170000	Thank you, Loki. He gave me the two cards I was missing in the super meat boy set.
1170000	1172000	And I crafted my first badge before the show.
1172000	1177000	And I got, uh, I got a summer sale card for crafting it now.
1177000	1182000	And I got my little emoticon that's deal with it with the super meat boy shades.
1182000	1187000	And I got the doctor fetus background with the big middle finger for my profile.
1187000	1194000	So that's kind of awesome. So if you visit my profile, well, I haven't changed it yet, but I will, but, uh, I will be flipping you off on my steam profile.
1194000	1204000	But I wanted to say, if you are getting into the trading card whoring thing for no explainable reason, like myself, uh, visit vognetwork.com and check out the forums.
1204000	1211000	I have posted an official steam trading card for him there because not only did I trade with Loki, I think I traded with Rababa the other day.
1211000	1215000	You know, I'm starting to trade with other people, but I would like to help out vog listeners.
1215000	1221000	I'll go to the general steam trade community if I must, but I'd rather help the vog people get the cards they need first.
1221000	1225000	So I only have a couple extras right now, but if I have something you want, let's talk.
1225000	1229000	Uh, cause now what do I need? I'm two cards short on really big skies.
1229000	1233000	So if you have, if you have the cards for that, help me out.
1233000	1241000	Uh, Alan Alchemy in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says the trading cards are neat, but I'm annoyed at their integration into the sale.
1241000	1248000	They already had a great meta game for sales that worked and did more to enrich and create content for the community in my opinion.
1248000	1253000	Like write, write a recommendation for a game you own, post screenshots and so on.
1253000	1259000	Um, yeah, you know, steam did kind of generalize that into a community badge.
1259000	1267000	So it's there, but yeah, I liked, I did like how you'd kind of get the perks every few months when they did these big sales, the summer sale and the winter sale.
1267000	1276000	Like I, I do kind of miss that a little bit because the kind of homogenizing it all into just the general community badge is going to make the sales lose that little special end of it.
1276000	1281000	But the trading cards is something, but I draw the line at spending real money.
1281000	1289000	I won't, I won't, I promise I won't, but I will probably end up with Borderlands 2 cause Bobby got Borderlands 2.
1289000	1290000	I'll play.
1290000	1291000	And you've got Borderlands 2.
1291000	1292000	I do and I haven't played it yet.
1292000	1300000	Loki has Borderlands 2. That's four people to all play some co-op on live streaming. What do you think? What do you think Dark Soccer? What do you think?
1300000	1303000	Alright, I get the thumbs up in the other room.
1303000	1308000	Alright, let's get into our other gaming weeks and the other types of games that you've been playing this week.
1308000	1310000	I do not leave trash all over your table, hello.
1310000	1311000	Oh, I appreciate that.
1311000	1314000	I was throwing it away like a responsible adult.
1314000	1316000	You gotta do something responsible.
1316000	1320000	You could have just put it in the bowl with this trash cause I gotta go throw that out anyway.
1320000	1322000	You know what? My trash is separate.
1322000	1325000	You have to separate our trash? I understand.
1325000	1327000	I don't want my trash to get gay.
1327000	1329000	I'm kidding. Shame on you.
1329000	1330000	Alright.
1330000	1331000	I will throw away your trash.
1331000	1332000	Oh, you don't have to do that.
1332000	1333000	I'm up.
1333000	1334000	Aw, shucks. Thanks.
1334000	1337000	Well then, since Dark Soccer's walking away, let me check in with Bradley.
1337000	1342000	I know you kinda already gave us the rundown on what you've been playing lately, but is there any other games you wanna talk about during your gaming week?
1342000	1347000	Oh, let's see. I don't know if there was anything else that I didn't mention.
1347000	1352000	Okay. That's alright. I figured you probably got out what you were currently playing in there.
1352000	1354000	Well, Jamie's back, so let me ask Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
1354000	1356000	Fuck. Busy.
1356000	1362000	I played a lot of BeatMania 2DX. I got to try a lot of new songs, some of which I passed the first time through.
1362000	1365000	I was playing on standard, so, you know, easy mode.
1367000	1368000	I passed Star Mine.
1368000	1372000	Ain't no shame in that. You're in your mid-thirties now. You get to tone it down a bit.
1372000	1376000	I haven't touched it since we last had one, and what did we have last? A red?
1377000	1380000	It actually had the DJ Troopers banner on it, but it was a trichoro.
1382000	1386000	I got to play a lot of fun stuff. I played some BeatMania 3.
1388000	1392000	Going from 2DX to BeatMania 3, the timing is just freakin' bizarre, you know?
1392000	1399000	So anyway, I played Quartet, which I was super disappointed that I couldn't hear the music.
1399000	1404000	Our fortune cookie reflects the music because I wanna freakin' hear that song.
1406000	1411000	I also played... I didn't play Journey because there was someone on it every time.
1412000	1415000	I played a lot of Metallica Pinball. It's super good.
1415000	1421000	It's funny with me and three other people behind me singing Master of Puppets while I'm playing the game.
1421000	1423000	Because I can't help it, you know?
1424000	1430000	Master of Puppets is just one of those songs that you have to sing along with certain parts of it if you know the song.
1431000	1433000	And I love old Metallica.
1433000	1441000	Also, one of our friends that drove us down there, he has a limited edition Metallica.
1441000	1443000	He buys everything that Stern puts out new.
1443000	1450000	And he got it signed by... I think the artist's name was Dirty Donny, I think.
1450000	1454000	He just ran into him and got him to sign it. So that was cool.
1457000	1459000	I know I played a bunch of other stuff.
1459000	1465000	I did play some Little Inferno as far as not classic stuff.
1466000	1468000	I pretty much played a ton of different games.
1468000	1471000	I played Timber with Melody. That was fun.
1471000	1475000	And then we threw our balls at some pussies. And it was pretty fun too.
1477000	1483000	I also played ACDC Pinball. I played Big Bang Bar.
1483000	1485000	I played The Wizard of Oz Pinball.
1485000	1492000	I got some footage of it that I'm going to be putting on my Tumblr and reposting to the Orange Lounge Tumblr later tonight.
1493000	1495000	Including the rainbow mode. Rob, it's so cool.
1496000	1500000	It's like they've got multicolored LEDs in the play field.
1501000	1508000	So that they'll cycle through different colors over each area instead of just having the standard incandescence of the older tables.
1509000	1510000	It's pretty neat.
1511000	1518000	So yeah, I won't go too much into the classic stuff because, like I said, there's a bunch of it there and I played a bunch of it.
1519000	1522000	I played a lot of Animal Crossing, like I said.
1522000	1526000	Little Inferno, I finally put down the two bucks to get Little Inferno on Steam.
1526000	1528000	It's freaking fun.
1529000	1541000	And the art style is like Edward Gorey and Joan M. Vasquez and Tim Burton all got put into a blender and their art style came out into this.
1542000	1543000	It was pretty neat.
1545000	1550000	And it's kind of just a creepy game, but basically what happens in that game is that you get a fireplace.
1551000	1557000	And you just burn stuff. And you can earn money the more that you burn things and buy different things out of catalogs.
1557000	1565000	And as you get different combos of stuff, you unlock more catalog and you have to use up your catalog before you can get a new catalog.
1566000	1569000	And you have to make 99 different combos of stuff.
1569000	1579000	And some of them are kind of hard because for one that's one of the last ones in there, you have to combine the sun and Pluto and the moon.
1579000	1581000	And it's called the solar system combo.
1582000	1586000	But when you put Pluto in there, it freezes everything. But when you put the sun in there, it burns everything.
1586000	1590000	And it lasts for a long time, so you actually have to wait until your fireplace is completely empty.
1590000	1594000	Put in Pluto and then put in the sun and then the moon. And then it'll do everything.
1594000	1600000	You get like ice cubes. There's one that's called the well-medicated combo that's like wine and happy pills and stuff.
1600000	1604000	That one's pretty funny. And the wine is called the midlife crisis mitigator.
1606000	1608000	What game is this still? Little Inferno?
1608000	1613000	Little Inferno. And then when you get past that, and to anyone who hasn't played it before that's going to,
1613000	1616000	remember what items that you send to your neighbor.
1617000	1619000	Because those are the items for the final combo.
1620000	1623000	Which I had to go back and look them all up again because I forgot what I sent.
1624000	1628000	After that, though, you have like a little adventure part of the game. You know, kind of a point-and-clicky sort of thing.
1628000	1632000	And I just started that, so I'm going to probably be playing more of that one tomorrow.
1633000	1637000	And I actually have not played any Mass Effect for an entire week.
1637000	1650000	Oh my god! What is the date? July 14th, episode 512. The one where she didn't play Mass Effect all week long. Holy shit.
1650000	1656000	Rob, in my defense, I've been looking for houses and I didn't play live on Thursday because of the stupid cough.
1657000	1661000	So you know what? I'm allowed to take a vacation.
1661000	1665000	I just, Commander Shepard is shedding a single tear.
1666000	1671000	Sometimes people in relationships need to take some time off from each other.
1672000	1676000	Allowed to take a vacation. That is something a pod person would say.
1678000	1684000	Anyway, I did buy a few more games on Steam, but I forgot what they were because I'm probably going to buy more tonight.
1685000	1689000	But I was going to get FTL, but it just doesn't seem like my kind of game.
1689000	1693000	Oh, I did get Hotline Miami and the Download Pack.
1694000	1700000	And I haven't tried it yet, but it just looks like it's so much fun because I like going around in a virtual environment.
1700000	1707000	A safe virtual environment where there's no risk that I'm actually going to do anything like this in real life and kill a bunch of people.
1707000	1710000	And big bloody massacres with a neat soundtrack.
1711000	1718000	It's not like I'm going to plug in my iPhone and listen to some dead mouse and shoot up a mall. Not going to happen.
1719000	1720000	Not going to happen.
1720000	1721000	Only in game.
1721000	1722000	Only in a game.
1723000	1724000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1725000	1729000	I didn't really play a whole ton of this stuff because I was doing all sorts of weird things.
1729000	1737000	Like I was modding my laptop cooling tray because I was trying to play Super Meat Boy on Sunday and my laptop got really hot.
1737000	1745000	My laptops with dedicated graphics cards, they tend to get warm because graphics cards aren't meant to be shoved into a laptop.
1747000	1752000	So I figured I needed a little bit more than just the really cheap blower fans that they had on there.
1752000	1761000	So I crafted a thing using basically the parts I had from my PC and my laptop cooling tray.
1761000	1771000	So after cutting some of the plastic around and stuff, I screwed in two 120mm fans in there that are from my Antec case.
1771000	1773000	So they have the three speed settings.
1773000	1778000	And of course you need a dedicated 12 volt power supply so I have a separate plug in the wall now.
1778000	1784000	And I had to manufacture a super long molex cable to connect to it.
1785000	1786000	So I have that now.
1787000	1800000	It works okay except I need new fan grills on it because the ones I made out of some office mesh stuff, office supply trays and stuff, they kind of bend too much.
1800000	1805000	And so occasionally if it's sitting weird in my lap you'll hear it scrape against the fan blades.
1805000	1807000	But it keeps it cool, that's for sure.
1808000	1814000	So let's see, aside from that I played Super Meat Boy. I actually played through quite a bit of it.
1814000	1827000	And then I have been staring at a lot of the Steam sales stuff but so far I'm showing much restraint and not picking up Fallout New Vegas Ultimate Edition for $5.
1827000	1834000	Because I know that a game like that, like Skyrim, is going to take hundreds of hours to sink in there.
1834000	1847000	And it'll be a fun hundred hours or so but with Saints Row 4 around the corner and Grand Theft Auto 5 in a couple months I really have to plan my gaming because Grand Theft Auto 5 is going to encompass my entire life after Grand Theft Auto 5 comes out.
1847000	1853000	So yeah, so I'm not picking that up yet.
1853000	1855000	Although tomorrow that's another thing.
1856000	1859000	That gameplay trailer which I haven't seen yet.
1859000	1860000	So amazing.
1860000	1861000	How'd you feel about that?
1861000	1862000	Oh it was great.
1862000	1863000	Yeah?
1863000	1864000	It was fantastic.
1864000	1865000	What'd you think of it?
1865000	1866000	We talked about it on Hoard House this week.
1866000	1869000	I guess there's a teaser at the end about a Grand Theft Auto Online?
1869000	1872000	Well it's just what they're calling their online portion of the game.
1872000	1877000	Because there's an online portion to Grand Theft Auto 4 but now they're calling it Grand Theft Auto Online.
1877000	1878000	And it looks great.
1878000	1880000	I mean it looks really good.
1880000	1886000	Obviously the screenshots that they've been putting out aren't the same quality as the gameplay trailer.
1887000	1897000	But that just leads to the rumors that yeah they're producing a higher quality asset version of the game so they can be ported to the PC or next gen consoles when the time comes.
1897000	1902000	Just so y'all know, Loki told me before the show tonight, you will get Grand Theft Auto 5 and you will play it.
1902000	1905000	Like it was not unique to us. You will.
1905000	1908000	Well because you have Grand Theft Auto 4 and you still haven't played it.
1908000	1910000	Alan played it on PC.
1910000	1914000	That's Alan playing it. I'm not talking about Alan. I'm talking about you playing it.
1914000	1923000	Honestly though, you probably should just skip 4 at this point and just go straight into 5 because it's going to be way better anyways.
1923000	1926000	I don't know. Just everything looks great about it.
1926000	1929000	Like the gameplay looks tighter. The combat looks better.
1929000	1933000	The level of detail in the game is just ridiculous.
1933000	1939000	And it just looks fun. It looks like a game that I can sink hundreds of hours into.
1939000	1942000	And let's not kid ourselves. You will.
1942000	1943000	I will.
1943000	1947000	That game will cause disagreements between you and the wife.
1947000	1951000	No, no it won't because I will.
1951000	1955000	The only problem is going to be getting this scream to play that on.
1955000	1962000	I guess I could play it in the other room but I can because my Xbox 360 has WiFi so that will be just fine.
1962000	1963000	There you go.
1963000	1964000	I can play in the other room.
1964000	1965000	Problem solved.
1965000	1966000	Exactly.
1966000	1968000	Alright, anything else for your gaming week?
1968000	1971000	No, not really. I'm just getting ready.
1971000	1974000	I was installing Arma 2 and the expansion DayZ.
1974000	1983000	Actually, because Gali had sent me a message on Twitter saying that he has a DayZ breakpoint server.
1983000	1987000	So maybe we can do that in the future.
1987000	1993000	VOG game night. Although for now I'm just suspending VOG game night because it's hard to get everybody together.
1993000	1997000	It's just to think of games to play.
1997000	2003000	It's really difficult, especially since on Fridays, usually Josh is going to bed later.
2003000	2007000	So I'm getting on at 9 and it's not a whole ton of time to play.
2007000	2011000	Focus on building our online communities for now and then we can look into doing something like that again.
2011000	2018000	The good thing though, there is one good gaming thing that did happen this week.
2018000	2026000	By some miracle, they fixed our Minecraft server long enough for me to download the backup of it.
2026000	2031000	So I made a backup and downloaded the world. So we still have the world intact now.
2031000	2036000	So my plan is when I do eventually get around to actually...
2036000	2041000	Aww, that's just fantastic. Brad, you're awesome.
2041000	2047000	So Brad from Pod Culture sent me a copy of Fallout New Vegas Ultimate Edition.
2047000	2049000	Oh, shut up. Right now?
2049000	2051000	Yeah, it's awesome. Thank you.
2051000	2055000	Brad, you are too good to us. That man sends us booze. He sends us games.
2055000	2057000	Brad, you're the man. He's awesome.
2057000	2059000	And he sends me episodes of Doctor Who.
2059000	2064000	What else does a nerd need besides games, Doctor Who, and booze?
2066000	2067000	Coffee!
2067000	2069000	Coffee.
2069000	2074000	Brad, you're right. Everybody listen to Pod Culture. 6 o'clock Pacific, Monday nights here at VOG.
2074000	2081000	So anyways, the plan is what I'm going to do with it once I get around to actually setting up that Minecraft server with mods and stuff.
2081000	2090000	I'm going to do a multi-world server where you can travel between the server that Gali has set up right now, which I think is a survival server.
2090000	2094000	So I'm just going to leave that alone. And then ours, which is a creative server.
2094000	2098000	So you'll be able to go back and forth between that stuff and I think it'll be the best of both worlds there.
2098000	2102000	I don't want to ruin the mood, but don't download that while the show's going.
2102000	2105000	No, of course not. Come on, man.
2105000	2109000	Let's see. Oh, going to the chat room. It's almost like it's a list list going on here.
2109000	2114000	What else does a nerd need besides Doctor Who, liquor, and games?
2114000	2122000	SSJ100Matt says boobs. You know, I'm a gay male and I'm not going to disagree with that. I need boobs too.
2122000	2124000	You know what? Sometimes boobs get in the way.
2124000	2131000	I will cosign that to the list. Fifth Dream says masturbation. No comment.
2131000	2134000	Misty says Mountain Dew. I don't know.
2134000	2136000	No. Nasty shit.
2136000	2138000	Maybe beverage of some type.
2138000	2139000	Coffee.
2139000	2140000	Okay. Coffee.
2140000	2141000	Coffee.
2141000	2143000	So a caffeinated beverage of some sort.
2143000	2147000	I will let caffeinated beverages go, except Mountain Dew is nasty shit.
2147000	2152000	Which, by the way, Rob, I have to say something, speaking of nerd drinks.
2152000	2154000	Do you remember a soda called Josta?
2154000	2157000	Oh God, yes. It sounds familiar for some reason.
2157000	2163000	It was like this golden colored drink and it had a red and black label with a panther on it.
2163000	2168000	It was put out by Pepsi, but Pepsi never put their logo on the label.
2168000	2173000	And it went off the market fairly quickly. Josta was really good.
2173000	2176000	And somebody brought a 15 year old can of it. Oh, I do remember this.
2176000	2179000	Somebody brought a 15 year old can of it to a California extreme and you drank it.
2179000	2186000	No. I found a soda at the Russian market that tastes almost exactly like it. It's a Brazilian guarana soda.
2186000	2190000	That is the most random thing you've ever said on this show.
2190000	2192000	But Josta was made out of guarana.
2192000	2196000	Hey y'all, remember Josta? Well you can get it at the Russian grocery store.
2196000	2201000	Keep in mind, keep in mind, I used to drink this stuff and watch Sailor Moon marathons.
2201000	2206000	Josta is the official drink of my Sailor Moon marathons, so you can stop laughing at me.
2206000	2209000	Alright, so let me just add that to the list.
2209000	2216000	Doctor Who, boobs, game, liquor. Apparently Josta and Sailor Moon are on the list too.
2217000	2223000	Well I'm glad that the Josta clone or whatever was more important than playing Mass Effect this week.
2223000	2225000	No, looking for houses was more...
2225000	2226000	Which by the way, the other...
2226000	2230000	And by the way, it wasn't Russian, it was Brazilian, but it was a Brazilian soda at a Russian market.
2230000	2233000	By the way, the other comment we got in chat, this is a little bit delayed here,
2233000	2238000	but that the Gaben.tv song, the G-A-B-E-N dot TV song,
2238000	2244000	is appropriate for when Dark Sakura announces that she hasn't played Mass Effect for an entire week.
2244000	2246000	Now this is supposed to be for the Steam sale.
2255000	2257000	This website is brilliant.
2257000	2263000	I really think this should be the official thing that they launch with when you open Steam during the sale.
2263000	2267000	It really should be that, but it just launches with that.
2268000	2273000	Or whenever Jamie launches Mass Effect, it's a picture of Garrus that comes up.
2273000	2275000	Are you ready for a miracle?
2276000	2278000	You know, that song is gonna pull...
2278000	2282000	That's what's... You know what's gonna happen when they play that song on Steam?
2282000	2284000	It's when Half-Life 3 gets announced.
2284000	2288000	That's just gonna all of a sudden be like, hey, wait a second, this is from the Steam sale.
2288000	2292000	Oh, whoa, now hold on a second. Something's different.
2292000	2295000	He's not dressed... He's dressed up like a...
2295000	2297000	I want that song played at my 40th birthday.
2299000	2301000	Alright, anyhow.
2301000	2303000	I don't know who you people are. I'm leaving.
2305000	2307000	You love us. Okay, My Gaming Week.
2307000	2308000	For dinner.
2308000	2310000	We haven't even done My Gaming Week yet.
2310000	2314000	My Gaming Week consisted of Loki's Ouya.
2314000	2316000	He let me borrow it.
2316000	2318000	Now I was playing with some apps on it. I didn't get to play a lot of games, to be honest,
2318000	2321000	but one of the first things I had to do, because again, I'm a narcissist.
2321000	2322000	We talked about this earlier in the show.
2322000	2327000	I had to download the TuneIn app and listen to VOG on the TuneIn app, which you can do.
2327000	2331000	So if you own an Ouya, I urge you, go get the TuneIn app and check out VOG,
2331000	2335000	because we are on TuneIn and you can listen to us through your Ouya.
2335000	2340000	I also played that parking valet simulator, the No Brakes Valet, whatever that's called.
2340000	2342000	That game cracked me up. That was fun.
2342000	2345000	And I was playing around with the Twitch TV app, which runs...
2345000	2350000	I gotta say, it runs... No surprise, it's the exact same setup as the mobile Twitch TV,
2350000	2355000	but it runs very well. I wasn't getting any screens that were entirely black,
2355000	2359000	which I get a lot on mobile. I was getting a lot of good-looking feeds on Twitch TV.
2359000	2362000	So that was pretty awesome. I like that.
2362000	2365000	Also, as far as other games go, thank you Steam sale.
2365000	2371000	I bought Scribblenauts Unlimited for $5, and I've been having fun with that.
2371000	2378000	Scribblenauts, of course, is a puzzle game of sorts where you can type whatever object
2378000	2381000	that comes to mind to help you solve the puzzle.
2381000	2387000	For example, I was in a museum level and I had to put things on the paintings
2387000	2389000	that the people looking at them would appreciate.
2389000	2392000	So, for example, there might be a caveman.
2392000	2394000	So one thing that he might appreciate, a campfire.
2394000	2396000	So you put in campfire and you put it in there.
2396000	2401000	Scribblenauts Unlimited allows you to use the descriptive text,
2401000	2403000	so like you get an adjective, right?
2403000	2406000	When you have a red balloon or a red whatever.
2406000	2413000	Or I think I had a mission where the guy was going to go pick a girl up on a date
2413000	2417000	and needed a cool ride, so I said, pink SUV.
2417000	2418000	And I got credit for it.
2418000	2420000	Should have done DeLorean.
2420000	2422000	Yeah, that's true.
2422000	2428000	The only negative I can think of for Scribblenauts Unlimited is it's more of a word puzzle
2428000	2431000	than it is platformer puzzle, at least in the early levels.
2431000	2433000	Now, granted, I'm still early on.
2433000	2436000	I probably have like 16 stars total, so I'm not like super far into the game.
2436000	2438000	But I've played it for an hour or two.
2438000	2442000	And I imagine the puzzles get more complicated later on
2442000	2445000	and maybe there's not so much maybe platforming,
2445000	2448000	but certainly the way that items would interact with other items
2448000	2451000	because I've seen a little bit of that so far.
2451000	2456000	Like, I think at one point I called out an axe murderer
2456000	2459000	because somebody wanted to be scared.
2459000	2462000	But the axe murderer actually ended up killing somebody,
2462000	2464000	and that was like a permanent thing.
2464000	2465000	So you've got to be careful.
2465000	2467000	Just watch out when you summon axe murderers.
2467000	2469000	Maybe you should just do Creepy Stalker.
2469000	2472000	Never summon Cthulhu. He will kill everything.
2472000	2474000	That's what Cthulhu does. He's an older god.
2474000	2476000	All right. So, yeah.
2476000	2478000	It's a cute game.
2478000	2481000	It's kind of an elaborate word puzzler.
2481000	2484000	The first few levels you're going to be kind of tapping your fingers on the desk
2484000	2487000	like, okay, this is pretty easy.
2487000	2489000	I know what I'm going to do when I get to that level.
2489000	2490000	What?
2490000	2492000	Little red Corvette.
2492000	2494000	And if it's driven by prints, it'll be even better.
2494000	2496000	I haven't really seen a sandbox stage.
2496000	2498000	I mean, I guess you can always go back to the farm level
2498000	2500000	and do whatever you want there,
2500000	2503000	but I was kind of surprised that, like, there isn't, like...
2503000	2507000	Well, the first Scribblenauts game, it was just a mode that you just go in the sandbox.
2507000	2509000	Yeah, I haven't really seen that in this, so...
2509000	2512000	But anyway, it was five bucks. Amazing.
2512000	2516000	Actdeft in chat says, I summon Cthulhu for a monster party.
2516000	2518000	You do see some funny stuff, like in...
2518000	2520000	I think it was in the diner level in the basement.
2520000	2522000	There's some monsters that are dancing around
2522000	2524000	and they want another person to dance with them.
2524000	2526000	So I summon Scary Unicorn,
2526000	2529000	and it was a unicorn with a mask on that was scary.
2529000	2532000	It is really cool how the game really can translate,
2532000	2534000	like, whatever you type into items.
2534000	2536000	And you can even build your own items,
2536000	2538000	which is pretty cool and edit stuff, so...
2538000	2540000	Yeah, I was...
2540000	2543000	There's still a lot of fun to be had in it,
2543000	2547000	even if the game itself is pretty simple.
2547000	2551000	Otherwise, other games I've been playing, not a lot of new stuff.
2551000	2553000	Still the Final Fantasy XIV beta,
2553000	2555000	which Beta 3 finally ends this weekend.
2555000	2559000	Okay, here's how much I've played the Final Fantasy XIV beta, you guys.
2559000	2561000	I actually got to the point where it said,
2561000	2565000	Well, that's all the story we have in the beta.
2565000	2567000	You have completed everything in the beta.
2567000	2569000	Go home!
2569000	2571000	I got to that point in the story where it's like,
2571000	2573000	Look forward to the release of the game.
2573000	2575000	You beat the beta.
2575000	2576000	And even then, Shane's like,
2576000	2577000	Well, you can still go get your chocobo.
2577000	2578000	You're not really done yet.
2578000	2579000	Go get your chocobo.
2579000	2581000	We got more instances to run.
2581000	2584000	I didn't play it all this weekend, Rob.
2584000	2585000	Yeah?
2585000	2586000	Because I was...
2586000	2588000	I think a lot of people are just kind of waiting for the release now.
2588000	2591000	I have to save up the money so I can buy it.
2591000	2594000	And also, they're going to nuke everybody pretty soon anyway,
2594000	2596000	so it's like, eh, why am I going to waste that time?
2596000	2600000	But Beta 4 should be in about three weeks or so,
2600000	2603000	and that supposedly is going to have the voice acting in the story quests
2603000	2605000	and some other stuff too.
2605000	2606000	It'll have more of the game.
2606000	2607000	Oh, there's voice acting in the game?
2607000	2608000	Yeah.
2608000	2610000	For the main story quests, there's going to be voice acting.
2610000	2614000	Yeah, I didn't know that until I read it, I think on Reddit.
2614000	2616000	And it was out of a producer interview or something like that,
2616000	2619000	so I don't question its legitimacy.
2619000	2623000	But yeah, I'm loving Realm Reborn.
2623000	2625000	It's such good fan service.
2625000	2628000	It's just so well done, especially the first game.
2628000	2630000	We don't acknowledge that anymore.
2630000	2632000	This is really what it should have been the whole time,
2632000	2634000	and this is what people want out of a Final Fantasy MMO, I think.
2634000	2636000	So, I don't know.
2636000	2638000	Some Eleven purists would probably argue with me on that,
2638000	2641000	but I really think there's a lot of people that are going to be very happy with it.
2641000	2643000	You know what I want out of an MMO?
2643000	2645000	Final Fantasy XI, then go free to play.
2645000	2647000	That would be nice, wouldn't it?
2647000	2649000	WhatupG in chat asks,
2649000	2651000	How many hours did you put in Sky?
2651000	2654000	I lost count. Is there a slash played?
2654000	2657000	Easily 20. Easily.
2657000	2659000	Probably more.
2659000	2661000	And I'm not just talking this weekend.
2661000	2663000	I'm talking kind of comprehensive across the beta,
2663000	2665000	but it's probably more.
2665000	2667000	Sg100Matt says,
2667000	2671000	Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn on max graphics settings is amazing.
2671000	2673000	Soundtrack is great, too.
2673000	2676000	Oh yeah, the soundtrack is phenomenal.
2676000	2679000	I mean, to be fair, the soundtrack was actually pretty good in 1.0,
2679000	2682000	but a good soundtrack won't save a shitty game.
2682000	2684000	So it's great that now there's this nice game
2684000	2687000	that the soundtrack compliments very well.
2687000	2690000	I do need to turn down the crowd noise,
2690000	2693000	because there's some weird voices in the crowd noise
2693000	2695000	when you're in a crowded area.
2695000	2697000	Like the one girl who goes, ha ha!
2697000	2699000	It is neat, though, that when you go into crowded areas,
2699000	2701000	you get the crowd noises.
2701000	2703000	There's little things like that that really add to it.
2703000	2705000	It's really cool.
2705000	2707000	That was really it for my gaming week.
2707000	2709000	Oh, the Mii Plaza games.
2709000	2711000	I played those quickly.
2711000	2713000	A couple of those I checked out.
2713000	2715000	There is a space shooter-type game
2715000	2719000	where your Miis that you collect by street passing,
2719000	2722000	the color of their shirts determines the weapons
2722000	2724000	that you can place on your ship.
2724000	2726000	So you can have a red shirt as a flamethrower,
2726000	2728000	a blue shirt as a homing missile,
2728000	2730000	and then it's a little space shooter game,
2730000	2733000	so it's an awesome little addition to Mii Plaza.
2733000	2735000	Bummer that they cost money,
2735000	2739000	but they're decent games for, what is it, $15 for the bundle?
2739000	2741000	For the four games?
2742000	2744000	Great.
2746000	2748000	To register participation for this week's episode
2748000	2751000	of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
2751000	2753000	use the passphrase, color.
2753000	2755000	All right, that's it for our gaming weeks,
2755000	2757000	so we can get into gaming news,
2757000	2759000	but quickly I'm just going to say housekeeping.
2759000	2762000	Don't forget to add us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R,
2762000	2764000	and follow us on Facebook as well.
2764000	2767000	Be our friend, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio,
2767000	2769000	or also on Google+.
2769000	2771000	All the places you can connect with us
2771000	2774000	are located at our website, orangeloungeradio.com.
2774000	2776000	There's a place in the upper right-hand corner
2776000	2778000	that has all these little logos
2778000	2780000	to the different places that we're at.
2780000	2782000	I encourage you to follow us on Steam as well.
2782000	2784000	I mentioned before we have our little Steam community
2784000	2786000	at the Voice of Geeks Network,
2786000	2788000	which you can see in the forums,
2788000	2791000	that if you're getting into the trading card whoring
2791000	2795000	like I am and like Loki inevitably will get into later,
2795000	2797000	check it out.
2797000	2799000	The only way that I would get into that
2799000	2802000	is if it was conveniently timed with a game that I'm playing,
2802000	2804000	because I'm not going to really play a game,
2804000	2806000	although I did for Super Meat Boy, I did play the game.
2806000	2808000	And you gave me your cards,
2808000	2810000	so I'm more than happy with the way that turned out.
2810000	2812000	And you know what though? I'm glad that I did,
2812000	2814000	because Super Meat Boy was an excellent game,
2814000	2816000	and I do like it.
2816000	2818000	It's a great way to revisit games.
2818000	2820000	I didn't talk about it during my gaming week,
2820000	2822000	but not only did I play Scribblenauts,
2822000	2824000	I played Really Big Sky, I played Super Meat Boy,
2824000	2826000	I played Magica, I played...
2826000	2828000	What else did I play to get cards out of?
2828000	2829000	There's something else, too.
2829000	2831000	I mean, there's all these games I'm collecting cards in,
2831000	2833000	and it forces me to go back and play the games again.
2833000	2836000	Yeah. So, anyways.
2836000	2841000	Alright, so how popular are these next-gen systems going to be?
2841000	2843000	I mean, I think they're going to be very popular,
2843000	2847000	and if anything, we should learn from these pre-orders
2847000	2850000	that they are so popular that they're selling out
2850000	2851000	of their allotments.
2851000	2853000	So yes, like any other console launch,
2853000	2856000	they're going to be hard to find at launch.
2856000	2859000	So, for example, GameStop,
2859000	2862000	they've stopped taking pre-orders for the PlayStation 4,
2862000	2867000	and they are also running shorts, I guess,
2867000	2871000	on Xbox One systems, the day one edition.
2871000	2875000	I guess, well, right now,
2875000	2880000	they are still selling some of the Xbox One bundles,
2881000	2885000	but a lot of them are gone, so they are almost out of those.
2885000	2887000	Also, Amazon.
2887000	2890000	They have stopped taking pre-orders for the Xbox One
2890000	2893000	and the PlayStation 4 launch bundles as well.
2893000	2896000	So, yeah.
2896000	2900000	Probably the demand's been just very high for these things,
2900000	2903000	so that's got to be a good sign, unlike the Wii U.
2906000	2907000	I don't know. We'll have to see.
2907000	2908000	I remember there's still that rumor
2908000	2913000	that they're having some problems with the yields
2913000	2916000	from the chips for the Xbox One,
2916000	2920000	so that could possibly lead to some shortages there.
2920000	2922000	We'll see if there's anything to that.
2922000	2925000	But either way, it should be a very successful launch
2925000	2928000	as far as console numbers go.
2928000	2929000	SSG100Matt says,
2929000	2931000	Of course there's going to be shortage.
2931000	2933000	Gonna drive up demand as much as possible.
2934000	2937000	Yes, but I mean, honestly,
2937000	2939000	I don't think they try to do it on purpose.
2939000	2941000	I mean, granted, that's a wonderful side effect
2941000	2944000	of the console being popular.
2944000	2947000	Unlike, you know, I seriously think with the Wii
2947000	2949000	and the Wii U or whatever,
2949000	2952000	that they were shortening that stuff on purpose.
2952000	2954000	At least the Wii U, because I remember they were saying,
2954000	2956000	Oh, it's so impossible to find,
2956000	2959000	and yet it was just sitting on shelves
2959000	2961000	like all these different places.
2961000	2963000	So I just kind of wonder about that stuff,
2963000	2965000	but I don't know.
2965000	2966000	Once again, it's going to end up,
2966000	2968000	they're going to have to sell a lot of units
2968000	2972000	to get the third-party support,
2972000	2974000	because if it's just not there,
2974000	2976000	if they're not selling any units,
2976000	2978000	then they're not going to sell games,
2978000	2980000	and they're going to lose support.
2980000	2983000	They're going to develop for systems that have the numbers.
2983000	2986000	What systems would be left, the 360 and PS3?
2986000	2987000	You'd be surprised, yeah.
2987000	2990000	They would just develop for current gen stuff.
2990000	2991000	Let's see, in our chat room,
2991000	2992000	WhatUpG says,
2992000	2995000	I think they are putting out more PlayStation 4 than Xbox One.
2995000	2996000	Dungeon Buster says,
2996000	2997000	In Microsoft's case,
2997000	2999000	it could also be a continuing problem
2999000	3001000	with silicon yields for their new CPU.
3001000	3002000	Alan Alchemy says,
3002000	3005000	It's only on purpose when Nintendo does it.
3005000	3007000	Live.vognetwork.com.
3007000	3009000	Well, okay.
3009000	3012000	Here's why, and this is kind of going back to,
3012000	3015000	how long were there shortages on the Wii?
3015000	3016000	Like, over a year.
3016000	3017000	That's ridiculous.
3018000	3021000	I mean, even with the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3,
3021000	3024000	there were shortages for maybe six months
3024000	3026000	when they were catching up on the demand stuff,
3026000	3029000	but then they were able to keep up with it.
3029000	3033000	But the Wii, it was hard to find just forever.
3033000	3035000	It was ridiculous.
3038000	3042000	Seeing the day-to-day operation of how Nintendo works,
3042000	3045000	they do allocate a lot of stuff
3045000	3047000	where they kind of hold back things
3047000	3048000	that they could possibly sell
3048000	3050000	and place them in certain places.
3050000	3054000	For example, there may be shortages for some retailers,
3054000	3056000	but other retailers are getting product
3056000	3059000	because they're filling the demand there first
3059000	3061000	and shorting everybody else,
3061000	3062000	or they're holding back
3062000	3064000	because they don't want any extra units
3064000	3065000	sitting on the shelves
3065000	3068000	to make it seem like that the system is selling out.
3068000	3071000	Like the Wii U, they didn't hold back systems,
3071000	3073000	and there were some sitting on the shelves,
3073000	3076000	and that definitely let people know
3076000	3077000	that it isn't selling out,
3077000	3081000	and so I guess maybe that could have possibly affected
3081000	3083000	demand on it or something.
3083000	3084000	I don't really know.
3084000	3085000	I don't think it would,
3085000	3088000	but I guess that could be their train of thought.
3090000	3093000	Way too early to still call a victor this year, though, right?
3093000	3094000	Anything still happen?
3094000	3095000	Oh, yeah.
3095000	3096000	All I'm going to say is
3096000	3098000	Nintendo has got their work cut out for them
3098000	3100000	to really sell those consoles
3100000	3105000	because they're betting that these first-party tiles
3105000	3106000	are going to sell consoles in.
3106000	3107000	Don't get me wrong.
3107000	3109000	I mean, Nintendo, Mario games are great.
3109000	3111000	They do remain the cheapest option on the table.
3111000	3113000	They are the cheapest option.
3113000	3116000	Oh, speaking of cheap options, actually,
3116000	3119000	I was going to say there is a PlayStation 3 SKU
3119000	3121000	coming out next month for $199.
3121000	3122000	What?
3122000	3123000	Yeah.
3123000	3124000	Oh.
3124000	3125000	PlayStation 3, wow.
3125000	3126000	PlayStation 3.
3126000	3128000	That's still, wow, that's great.
3128000	3130000	However, the hard drive is really small.
3130000	3131000	It's a 12-gig hard drive.
3131000	3132000	They had it in Europe right now.
3132000	3133000	They were selling it.
3133000	3136000	But 12-gig hard drive for $199,
3136000	3138000	that's still pretty cheap.
3138000	3141000	And, I mean, granted, those hard drives are replaceable,
3141000	3143000	and you can get a cheap hard drive,
3143000	3145000	so it might be an easy way to get in
3145000	3148000	if you want a PlayStation 3 system.
3148000	3150000	So there's that.
3150000	3152000	I mean, that might go through the holidays.
3152000	3153000	Well, that'll help out.
3153000	3155000	But, yeah, I mean, seriously,
3155000	3157000	I hope that that Mario game does really well for them.
3157000	3159000	I hope that Mario game and Zelda and stuff
3159000	3160000	really does sell systems for them,
3160000	3162000	because if it doesn't,
3162000	3165000	I don't know much more of what they can do.
3165000	3166000	I mean, Mario Kart will be good,
3166000	3171000	but they may be in the shitter for another year.
3171000	3172000	Yeah.
3172000	3174000	Well, I don't think they're just going to stop.
3174000	3177000	Nintendo themselves will not stop supporting Wii U.
3177000	3178000	No, I understand that.
3178000	3179000	You'll still see games
3179000	3181000	that people are going to want on that
3181000	3182000	for the next couple of years.
3182000	3185000	It's just, you know, it may not be the powerhouse
3185000	3187000	that the Wii was without all the other third-party support,
3187000	3191000	but, I mean, Nintendo will still make games for their own system
3191000	3193000	while they work on the successor.
3193000	3195000	And a lot of games are, you know,
3195000	3198000	Nintendo, people that buy Nintendo systems,
3198000	3200000	a lot of times buy it for Nintendo games.
3200000	3201000	So it's not a huge loss,
3201000	3204000	but it does affect, you know,
3204000	3206000	if you want to buy a system
3206000	3208000	or if you're contemplating buying another system,
3208000	3210000	like, let's consider it next-gen.
3210000	3212000	I still don't consider the Wii U next-gen
3212000	3214000	because of the, you know, hardware and stuff,
3214000	3217000	but let's, if you're considering a next-gen system
3217000	3218000	and you're looking at, okay,
3218000	3220000	all the games that are coming out that I want to play
3220000	3224000	and the, you know, Wii U is missing a lot of them,
3224000	3226000	you know, you just might not buy the system.
3226000	3227000	Yeah.
3227000	3228000	And by the way,
3228000	3230000	just because I say Nintendo working on a successor,
3230000	3232000	I don't mean like they're hurrying a successor,
3232000	3235000	but it's very common that the research and development
3235000	3237000	of these systems is years in advance.
3237000	3240000	PlayStation 5 is probably already being worked on
3240000	3243000	very, very, very slowly in its early planning stages,
3243000	3244000	but, you know.
3244000	3247000	If the roadmaps are meant, are to be believed,
3247000	3250000	you know, the one that leaked out for the, you know,
3250000	3253000	the Xbox system and the Kinect and the VR stuff,
3253000	3255000	Microsoft's working on some VR stuff, so.
3255000	3256000	Yeah, yeah.
3256000	3257000	We'll see.
3257000	3259000	Next year is apparently when that's supposed to come out.
3259000	3260000	We'll see.
3260000	3263000	All right, moving on, speaking of Microsoft,
3263000	3266000	apparently the, as Bobby likes to call them,
3266000	3269000	the Microsoft SpaceBucks, or the Microsoft points,
3269000	3270000	they're being phased out.
3270000	3272000	Now, we kind of knew that that was going to be happening
3272000	3273000	at some point.
3273000	3275000	I believe that came up during E3,
3275000	3278000	but it is actually now kind of dated
3278000	3280000	when that's all going to go down.
3280000	3284000	The Xbox Live Rewards will be doing away with these bonuses
3284000	3286000	as of August 1st, okay,
3286000	3290000	but the Xbox Live Rewards program will still be there in place.
3290000	3294000	Apparently, September 1st is when we'll have more information
3294000	3297000	on whatever the Xbox Live Rewards program turns into.
3297000	3299000	I think this is the program that gives you, like,
3299000	3301000	20 points on your birthday.
3301000	3303000	Like, ooh, Microsoft gave me a quarter.
3303000	3305000	Woo-hoo!
3305000	3310000	But in the Xbox Live beta, apparently some problems right now
3310000	3314000	in the new, you know, the new dashboard build is being previewed
3314000	3316000	that's going to roll out in the fall,
3316000	3321000	and I guess some problems there about some negative exchange rates
3321000	3323000	and some that are too favorable,
3323000	3327000	incorrect game title pricing in wrong regions and so forth,
3327000	3329000	but, you know, it is a beta,
3329000	3331000	so you can't exactly sit there and go,
3331000	3332000	Microsoft, you suck.
3332000	3334000	I mean, that's what you get when you sign up for a beta
3334000	3335000	is that things are going to screw up.
3335000	3337000	We can still say they suck,
3337000	3339000	but we just can't say that that sucks.
3339000	3343000	Yeah, I don't understand how they can't, like,
3343000	3345000	are you telling me that Microsoft is confused
3345000	3347000	on how their space bucks work?
3347000	3350000	I mean, granted, I know it's easy for the, you know,
3350000	3352000	North America and stuff where it's, like,
3352000	3354000	you know, 80 points equals a dollar,
3354000	3355000	but, like, you know, in other regions,
3355000	3358000	I'm sure it's X amount of points equals, you know, whatever.
3358000	3360000	With so much crap in the marketplace, though,
3360000	3362000	I'm sure it's a database conversion issue.
3362000	3366000	Like, it's one wrong little line of code that fucks everything up.
3366000	3368000	I'm sure it's something that simple.
3368000	3369000	It's got to be.
3369000	3374000	So, I don't know yet exactly when the points will move into dollars,
3374000	3377000	but it's going to be before probably this same September timeframe.
3377000	3380000	And the 20 points thing on your birthday.
3380000	3382000	I don't even think I got that.
3382000	3384000	Who even cares?
3384000	3386000	That is just so ridiculously stupid.
3386000	3387000	What can you buy with 20 points?
3387000	3395000	There was someone at, I think it was Flaco Jones who said,
3395000	3397000	you know, hey, I got 20 points on my birthday.
3397000	3400000	And I'm like, don't spend it all in one place.
3400000	3403000	How can you not spend it all in one place?
3403000	3405000	There's only 20 points.
3405000	3407000	Geez.
3407000	3408000	All right. Let's move on.
3408000	3410000	Dark Sakura.
3410000	3411000	Let's see.
3411000	3416000	Well, you know how we've talked about the poor sales of the Wii U
3416000	3419000	are probably going to start affecting third party markets
3419000	3422000	as far as what gets developed for them.
3422000	3424000	Well, it looks like Ubisoft has come out and said
3424000	3428000	that they're not doing a sequel to Zombie U just for that reason.
3428000	3433000	That basically the Wii U hasn't sold enough
3433000	3436000	and the game itself, Zombie U, hasn't sold enough.
3436000	3440000	So even though they have a prototype of a sequel,
3440000	3442000	they are not going to pursue development.
3442000	3445000	There will be no Zombie U 2.
3446000	3450000	No Zombie The Edge, no Zombie Bono.
3450000	3455000	It's probably going to be called something else, be my guess.
3455000	3459000	And it's going to be Multiplatform because that's why they can't, they know.
3459000	3463000	And that's sad too because Zombie U is probably one of the most successful
3463000	3465000	third party games they had at launch.
3465000	3468000	I was really surprised by this news.
3468000	3469000	It was that bad.
3469000	3471000	Well, they've delayed Rayman Legends
3471000	3473000	for the reason of putting it on Multiplatform.
3473000	3475000	I think that's exactly what's going to happen with it.
3475000	3478000	Especially now that you have the next-gen consoles or whatever
3478000	3480000	going to have all the second screen support anyway,
3480000	3483000	you can still do all that stuff that they have in Zombie U.
3483000	3485000	Just do it with the second screen.
3485000	3487000	Or you can make a lot of that stuff optional.
3487000	3489000	So I think that they're going to have another zombie game,
3489000	3491000	but it just probably won't be called Zombie U.
3491000	3494000	Instead of calling it Zombie U, call it Zombie Them.
3494000	3495000	Zombie Me.
3495000	3496000	Zombie Us.
3497000	3499000	Zombie One.
3500000	3503000	I was surprised to hear that it was that bad,
3503000	3506000	but it also kind of shed some light on why they pulled the plug
3506000	3507000	on the Rayman thing so fast.
3507000	3508000	It's exactly the same reason.
3508000	3509000	Yeah.
3509000	3511000	I mean, because we didn't know this then,
3511000	3513000	and we were kind of like, Ubisoft's just being dicks.
3513000	3517000	You know, but I guess financially that's what it is.
3517000	3518000	I didn't say that.
3518000	3519000	Yeah, well.
3520000	3524000	Well, it's the one time that Mr. Negative over there,
3524000	3526000	Norman Negative, is right.
3527000	3529000	All right, anyhow.
3529000	3530000	What else we got?
3530000	3531000	Next up.
3531000	3532000	Ha, ha, ha, ha.
3532000	3533000	I beat Raginator.
3533000	3534000	Huh?
3534000	3535000	To my really awful U2 joke.
3535000	3537000	You beat him with your shoe?
3538000	3539000	Zombie Bono.
3539000	3542000	So, you know, one of the things that PlayStation 4
3542000	3546000	was going to allow developers to do
3546000	3549000	is self-publish on the PlayStation Network.
3549000	3552000	And, you know, basically their thought is, you know,
3553000	3557000	we're going to treat every single individual developer
3557000	3559000	as a publisher as far as we're concerned.
3559000	3562000	And we don't separate, we don't segregate indies
3562000	3564000	from traditional publishers,
3564000	3566000	which I think is a fantastic thing.
3566000	3569000	I think it's awesome that you see these indie games
3569000	3573000	next to, you know, big budget games and stuff.
3573000	3576000	And I, honestly, it's kind of refreshing
3576000	3579000	compared to, like, the stuff that was happening
3579000	3581000	with the Xbox indie games,
3581000	3584000	where it's just like, yeah, we got the indie games,
3584000	3586000	but they're tucked away in a corner in a closet
3586000	3588000	underneath some clothes and stuff.
3588000	3591000	And you might be able to find them, you know, if you dig.
3591000	3594000	So I'm glad to see that they're actually doing that,
3594000	3596000	and hopefully it is a little bit easier
3596000	3598000	to publish on the PlayStation Network.
3598000	3601000	So, I mean, and so far, I know,
3601000	3603000	at least with the PlayStation 3,
3603000	3605000	I think it's been pretty easy for them,
3605000	3608000	and even PlayStation Vita, so that's just only good things.
3608000	3614000	And that kind of also carries on over to the Vita as well,
3614000	3617000	because, you know, the Vita could always use more games.
3620000	3623000	This indie thing has really been great for Sony, too.
3623000	3625000	I mean, that was one thing people were very excited about at E3,
3625000	3627000	was all their indie developers on the stage,
3627000	3631000	and kind of one of the places where PlayStation
3631000	3633000	kind of gave Microsoft a little kick in the butt, too,
3633000	3635000	because there's been a lot of negative about Microsoft.
3635000	3638000	Do you think that Microsoft might change some of their strategy
3638000	3640000	when it comes to Xbox One?
3640000	3642000	I think Microsoft's strategy with the Xbox One,
3642000	3644000	or not even really with the Xbox,
3644000	3647000	because now they're kind of treating all their platforms as one platform.
3647000	3652000	I think the problem is they know that people want to develop games
3652000	3655000	for the Xbox One, but they also know
3655000	3660000	they have a lack of application support on Windows 8.
3660000	3662000	So therein is going to be basically,
3662000	3666000	hey, develop games for the Windows 8 platform, and guess what?
3666000	3668000	Because we have that kernel running on,
3668000	3671000	or that version of the firmware or whatever,
3671000	3673000	however you're going to split it up,
3673000	3675000	we have that running on the Xbox One,
3675000	3678000	your games will be able to be ported over to the Xbox One very easily.
3678000	3681000	That's how they're going to win on both platforms,
3681000	3684000	because they want to sell those operating systems,
3684000	3686000	because that's where they're probably going to make a lot of money.
3686000	3691000	And at the same time, they also want to have stuff on their console,
3691000	3693000	I just think that that's what they're going to try to do,
3693000	3696000	is try to get people, almost like,
3696000	3704000	trick them into making games for the Microsoft platform, I guess.
3704000	3709000	Shadownextgen in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,
3709000	3713000	you have to worry about whether PlayStation Network on PS4
3713000	3716000	will turn into the App Store, though.
3716000	3717000	That's a good point.
3717000	3719000	I mean, the App Store has a lot of crap on it,
3719000	3721000	like a lot of crap.
3721000	3724000	Like, how many fart apps do we need, right?
3724000	3726000	Flashlight apps, really?
3726000	3728000	Yeah, exactly.
3728000	3730000	I don't think it's going to happen that way, though,
3730000	3734000	because even right now with the way PlayStation Network's indie games are,
3734000	3736000	it's easier for them to get on,
3736000	3738000	but I don't think it's like, you know,
3738000	3742000	they can just throw games up there like you can on the indie store.
3742000	3745000	I don't know, it'll be interesting to see how they do it.
3745000	3748000	Do you think there will be some type of quality review process?
3748000	3749000	I think so.
3749000	3750000	Because the problem is you open it up too much,
3750000	3752000	and that's where you start getting all the IP theft stuff, too.
3752000	3754000	Like, we've heard about the stuff in the App Store
3754000	3760000	that was like literal ripoffs of games that existed other places.
3760000	3763000	I remember there was one, like a Pokémon app.
3763000	3765000	All it was was pictures of Pokémon,
3765000	3768000	but people legit thought it was like Nintendo's Pokémon on the App Store,
3768000	3772000	and people were downloading it like crazy and losing money on it.
3772000	3775000	I think that they'll probably have some sort of review process in there,
3775000	3781000	and, you know, they'll probably just, they have just a fun and happy medium.
3781000	3785000	I mean, you can't just make it super duper easy to put stuff on there.
3785000	3787000	I mean, look at, like, for example, the Ouya.
3787000	3790000	There's a perfect example of how you can self-publish on there,
3790000	3793000	but there's not a ton of stuff on there.
3793000	3795000	That store is a mess, too, I gotta say.
3795000	3797000	Okay, well, that store has been a mess since launch,
3797000	3801000	especially with their, like, fucked up, like, menus and stuff.
3801000	3804000	The way to navigate that is, it's not very well,
3804000	3807000	and, like, you know, you look at, like, all the different bars that feature things,
3807000	3809000	and, like, every single one of them has got the same games in it,
3809000	3811000	just in a different order.
3811000	3813000	It's like the Wii U store when it first launched,
3813000	3815000	or not too much different now.
3815000	3817000	Yeah, so it's just kind of weird,
3817000	3821000	but they do have it where you can easily publish stuff on there,
3821000	3826000	but I think it's just some sort of, you know, quality sorting and stuff,
3826000	3832000	and just, you know, better ways to search for what you're actually looking for.
3832000	3836000	Alright, well, you know, THQ had some problems last year,
3836000	3840000	and they went bankrupt, and, you know, a lot of their properties went to all these different places,
3840000	3845000	hence why, you know, we have Deep Silver doing Saints Row now, and so forth,
3845000	3849000	but Sega, apparently not happy with the way things went down,
3849000	3853000	because they filed a claim against THQ, and bankruptcy court, of course,
3853000	3857000	because THQ is bankrupt, for almost a million dollars,
3857000	3860000	just shy of that, about $941,000.
3860000	3864000	That apparently is the amount that THQ received in pre-orders,
3864000	3868000	after Valve's cut, for Company of Heroes 2.
3868000	3872000	Apparently, Eurogamer had also reported that about a half million was made
3872000	3874000	after THQ filed for bankruptcy,
3874000	3880000	so Sega wants to get that money back that came in from pre-orders for Company of Heroes 2.
3880000	3885000	Double Fine, Codemasters, and other former THQ executives
3885000	3888000	also looking for the money that they're supposed to be getting.
3888000	3890000	This doesn't mean any of them will get anything.
3890000	3893000	I imagine this is part of the process, filing the claim,
3893000	3898000	so you can ultimately later on claim it as a loss when it comes to tax season later on,
3898000	3903000	but it's interesting that this THQ drama still goes on.
3903000	3908000	By the way, the reason why Sega wants the money is because they got Relic, the developer,
3908000	3910000	and the Company of Heroes property,
3910000	3914000	they bought that for $26.6 million at the THQ asset auction.
3914000	3918000	So, that's what's going down. Sega wants their money.
3918000	3921000	They want to buy their building back from Zynga.
3921000	3923000	I wish.
3923000	3929000	You know, they say, if we had a million dollars, we could make Dreamcast 2.
3929000	3935000	If I had a million dollars, maybe Sonic 4 wouldn't suck.
3935000	3940000	You know, it's funny the difference between what a million dollars is to you ten years ago versus now.
3940000	3942000	Right. Anyhow.
3942000	3946000	Now I'm like, house! I can buy a house!
3946000	3951000	Well, did you know that video games can become professional sports, according to the US government?
3951000	3954000	I remember when we used to talk about when is DDR going to become a sport.
3954000	3956000	I know, right? Well, you know what made it?
3956000	3958000	It was in Finland or something, wasn't it?
3958000	3962000	I think. But you know what made it officially? League of Legends.
3962000	3968000	It has now been considered, and this is a quote coming from Riot Games,
3968000	3976000	esports manager Nick Allen, said the United States government recognizes League of Legends pro players as professional athletes
3976000	3980000	and awards visas to essentially work in the United States under that title.
3980000	3989000	So, yeah. It is officially an esports, and the pro players are e-thletes, as I'm calling them.
3989000	3992000	That's my new word, and you have to give credit to me. E-thlete.
3992000	3994000	I don't know if you're the first person I've heard that term from.
3994000	3996000	Well, you know what? I'm saying it, so whatever.
3997000	4004000	But this means that, yeah, you can actually apply for a visa if you're a professional e-thlete.
4004000	4008000	You know what this also means? We can just add this to the list of sports that I'm terrible at,
4008000	4013000	which is right up there with baseball and basketball and football, League of Legends.
4013000	4017000	There you go. That's why this is a sport because I'm terrible at it.
4017000	4018000	Do you suck at croquet?
4018000	4020000	Yes, actually I do.
4020000	4025000	You know, I cannot play croquet without singing Que Sera Sera to myself because of Heathers.
4026000	4028000	I'm pretty good at miniature golf.
4028000	4031000	So am I. My husband's really good at it.
4031000	4033000	Is that a sport? Is mini golf a sport?
4033000	4034000	It is officially in my universe.
4034000	4035000	Okay, well that's all I need.
4035000	4041000	Well, I've been talking about forming the island of awesome, and I think the national sport of the island of awesome should be mini golf.
4041000	4046000	I honestly think that they should make mini golf courses the size of actual golf courses and televise that shit,
4046000	4051000	because I want to see someone doing a drive off of a giant loop-de-loop and all sorts of crazy stuff.
4051000	4055000	It could be right there with dodgeball and League of Legends on the Ocho.
4056000	4058000	It's been eight. The Ocho.
4060000	4063000	Gamergirl in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,
4063000	4066000	Then I guess this means Dota 2 is next?
4066000	4069000	You know, that's a good comment because, you know,
4069000	4076000	it brings this interesting area where you've got a game that's essentially owned by a company as a sport.
4076000	4080000	I mean, what about all the competitors that make similar games?
4080000	4085000	We're going to have Blizzard, All-Stars, Valve has Dota 2. Isn't there another one?
4085000	4088000	There's another one I'm not thinking of. There's another smaller one.
4088000	4093000	Because, you know, all those guys that contributed to the original Defense of the Ancients mod in Warcraft 3
4093000	4097000	all went their own separate ways, so you got all these games because of it.
4097000	4101000	Is Dota 2 going to be a sport? Or what happens next?
4101000	4102000	How do you guys feel about-
4102000	4104000	I still think we want pro DDR.
4104000	4107000	How do you guys feel about- but DDR's dead, yo. Haven't you got the memo?
4107000	4108000	No, it's not.
4109000	4114000	It's like the disco boys in Mystery Men. Eddie Izzard. DDR is life.
4115000	4116000	No, it's death.
4116000	4118000	After we're done playing.
4121000	4123000	Loki, what do you think about video games becoming sports?
4123000	4126000	It's kind of ridiculous to call it a sport.
4126000	4130000	I mean, just call it something else, but it's not like a sport.
4130000	4131000	Isn't that what gamers want?
4131000	4136000	I guess if you want to call chess a sport, then I guess we can call video games a sport.
4136000	4140000	But, I mean, I don't know. I always think of sports as something, like, active.
4140000	4143000	I mean, even chess is kind of like, ehhh.
4143000	4145000	You can sweat playing chess.
4145000	4146000	In a hot room.
4146000	4148000	I mean, I don't know.
4148000	4150000	Whatever. I mean, fine.
4150000	4155000	But, those people are- you're not going to see it in the fucking Olympics, okay?
4155000	4157000	It's just not going to happen.
4157000	4159000	And don't even try to, like, petition that shit.
4159000	4161000	Tiger Claw says it's called eSports.
4161000	4163000	It's like new sports.
4163000	4165000	Will we have the Olympics?
4165000	4167000	That'll be actually kind of cool.
4167000	4168000	For our eathletes.
4168000	4172000	Shouldn't it be Sports 2.0? Because, you know, the whole, like, Web 2.0 shit.
4172000	4173000	ActDeft.
4173000	4174000	I want Robot Jocks.
4174000	4175000	ActDeft in chat.
4175000	4176000	For reals.
4176000	4178000	ActDeft in chat says, how about stuff like EVO?
4178000	4181000	Well, that's all going on right now. Like, that's a huge Olympics type of thing.
4181000	4183000	That's only for fighting games.
4183000	4187000	But still, I mean, getting quite a bit of viewership and controversy of its own online.
4187000	4189000	So, we'll get into it later in the show.
4189000	4190000	So.
4190000	4194000	Man, I like EVO when there's, like, people that no one's ever heard of who just come in and kick ass.
4194000	4195000	Yeah.
4195000	4196000	Well, that's like any sport.
4196000	4201000	Yeah, but I really like it in Street Fighter because I've played a bunch of, you know, people who are really good.
4201000	4203000	And sometimes they can be dicks.
4203000	4205000	It's like Wimbledon. It always makes headlines.
4205000	4209000	I liked watching the video from, I think it was EVO last year, where they had I Wanna Be the Guy Guy Den.
4209000	4210000	Mm-hmm.
4210000	4211000	That's a good name.
4211000	4212000	That was awesome.
4212000	4217000	Infinel in our chatroom says, next, Mario and Sonic at the Olympics will be in eSports.
4217000	4219000	That's very meta. I like that idea.
4219000	4220000	We'll see.
4220000	4221000	We'll see.
4221000	4224000	All right, moving on to release dates.
4224000	4228000	We're going to travel around the world and check out what games are coming out that could be a sport in a few years.
4228000	4229000	We'll see. Loki?
4229000	4232000	Well, I don't know about any of the games you're going to support this week.
4232000	4238000	But, because, like, for example, there's Turbo Super Stunt Squad, which is a game based on the-
4238000	4239000	Is it turbo-tastic?
4239000	4240000	Probably not.
4240000	4249000	It's based on that Dreamworks movie about the snail that somehow ingests NOS and so becomes, like, a super fast snail.
4249000	4251000	Because, you know, that's science right there.
4251000	4252000	Mm-hmm.
4252000	4259000	So, they have that coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Wii U, 3DS, and DS.
4259000	4269000	Also, this week, your ever yearly multi-release version of you versus a bunch of other feudal Japan warriors.
4269000	4276000	Dynasty Warriors 8 coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.
4277000	4282000	Also, this week, Time of Eternity on PlayStation 3.
4284000	4288000	Let's see, the Serious Sam collection being released on Xbox 360.
4288000	4291000	There's a bunch of Xbox Live arcade games that were on there.
4293000	4295000	I want to see. I think that might be it.
4295000	4297000	Am I missing something?
4300000	4301000	And that's it.
4301000	4303000	Let me move to Japan then and if Loki thinks-
4303000	4304000	Bye, Rob.
4304000	4305000	Bye.
4305000	4306000	Bye, I'm moving.
4306000	4308000	Alright, moving to the Japanese release dates.
4308000	4313000	Final Fantasy XIII-2 gets a price reduction on the PlayStation 3 on July 18th.
4313000	4320000	Shin Sangokumusou Online Z in regular edition and Treasure Box edition comes out on the 18th as well.
4320000	4322000	This is Dynasty Warriors Online, right?
4322000	4323000	That's what that is.
4323000	4325000	That's on the PlayStation 3.
4325000	4328000	Going to the Xbox 360.
4328000	4331000	Final Fantasy XIII-2 gets its reduction there too.
4332000	4335000	There's like a digital contents version and platinum collection.
4335000	4338000	Oh, I bet digital contents is just all the DLC.
4338000	4341000	Like the Saw's side story and all the stuff that came out for XIII-2.
4341000	4343000	There was a lot of DLC for XIII-2.
4343000	4344000	Okay.
4344000	4346000	So, yeah. You don't care about XIII-2?
4346000	4347000	I'm just like-
4347000	4348000	Pass.
4348000	4349000	I'm agreeing with you. I'm like, okay.
4349000	4350000	Okay.
4350000	4353000	Well, there's nothing to debate here, Darus Sakura.
4353000	4354000	These are the release dates.
4354000	4356000	And I'm just accepting them.
4356000	4358000	I've accepted them into my version of reality.
4358000	4359000	Alright, fine.
4359000	4362000	You will import them into Planet Sakura.
4362000	4366000	I am incorporating them into my own virtual consciousness.
4366000	4367000	Fair enough.
4367000	4368000	On the Wii U.
4368000	4373000	Yes, Sniper Elite V2 is out this week from Ubisoft in Japan.
4373000	4375000	Sniper Elite, that's a game that's out here?
4375000	4377000	Is that like one of the small Clancy games?
4377000	4380000	No, it's a World War II sniper game.
4381000	4384000	Nintendo 3DS sees a little bit this week.
4384000	4388000	Mario & Luigi RPG 4 Dream Adventure comes out this week from Nintendo.
4388000	4393000	Damball Senkai W. Cho Custom comes out this week from level 5.
4393000	4397000	There is a special Luigi Nintendo 3DS XL this week.
4397000	4399000	I don't know if it's like green or what the-
4399000	4400000	I gotta see what this is.
4400000	4401000	Is it a green?
4401000	4402000	I mean, it has to be, right?
4402000	4403000	Oh, it's like-
4403000	4404000	No, it's white.
4404000	4407000	But it has like little green silhouettes of Luigi all over it.
4407000	4409000	Green and teal and light green.
4409000	4411000	And barfy yellow.
4411000	4412000	Easter egg.
4412000	4414000	There is one of those that's actually a Mario.
4414000	4415000	Oh, really?
4415000	4416000	Yeah, you said it looked great.
4416000	4418000	That like snuck on there? Like a red one?
4418000	4421000	No, it's not red. It's green, but it's a Mario.
4421000	4422000	Look for the squat, Mario.
4422000	4423000	It must be on the-
4423000	4424000	I think it's on the back.
4424000	4426000	Yeah, it must be on the back because I don't see it in the little box art here.
4426000	4431000	I am surprised that DJ Rama S doesn't try and import one of these.
4431000	4433000	So, we'll see.
4433000	4435000	Maybe he will.
4435000	4437000	Also on the 3DS this week,
4437000	4445000	Shin Sekaiju no Miku Design Skins
4446000	4449000	Oh, those aren't even games. Those are just little skins for the 3DS.
4449000	4455000	Osahare Hamster 2 Korosau Ishoni Orakake comes out this week.
4456000	4457000	Do something together?
4457000	4460000	Play with adorable hamsters.
4460000	4461000	Oh my gosh, it's Hamster Sam.
4461000	4462000	Maybe it's just play together.
4462000	4465000	Oh my god, the box. This is adorable.
4465000	4466000	Why do we get games like this here?
4466000	4468000	They're on a sunflower.
4468000	4470000	The hamsters are sitting on a sunflower.
4470000	4471000	Wearing bows.
4471000	4473000	One is wearing a tiara.
4473000	4475000	And then you look at the game shots.
4475000	4479000	And they're playing in this cherry blossom field.
4479000	4481000	With a little hamster wheel.
4481000	4483000	And then there's one underwater here.
4483000	4486000	And then here's one with the hamsters. They're just chilling at the beach.
4486000	4489000	This little chief hamster there sitting in a lounge chair.
4489000	4490000	Just chilling at the beach.
4490000	4491000	That's not realistic at all.
4491000	4494000	First off, they were in the field of flowers.
4494000	4497000	They're not going to have Richard Gere's asshole as a level.
4497000	4499000	No, I understand that. I'm not saying that they do that.
4499000	4501000	They'd be running from owls level.
4501000	4504000	I'm just saying that they would just shove in their face full of food.
4504000	4506000	Because that's all hamsters do. Shove their face full of food.
4506000	4507000	And poop.
4507000	4509000	They throw their poop, actually.
4509000	4510000	Because they like to keep their cage clean.
4510000	4512000	So they huck it like footballs.
4512000	4514000	And they pee on you when they're nervous.
4514000	4515000	Yes.
4517000	4522000	Rama is pointing out that he's not interested in this 3DSXL because it's region locked.
4522000	4526000	Well, you know what? We need to find a way to un-region lock
4526000	4530000	Osahare hamster to Kuraso Isho ni Oda Kake.
4530000	4532000	Because, again, here's the game.
4532000	4535000	Yeah, I think it says let's play together.
4535000	4538000	Here's a game that we need in America.
4538000	4540000	Why don't we have this game in America?
4540000	4547000	And Nintendo's fascist state 3DS will not allow me to import this game.
4547000	4549000	This is a challenge to OLR listeners now.
4549000	4552000	If you have a hamster, I want you to put a bow on it and send me a picture.
4552000	4554000	But keep the hamster. Oh my god, don't harm the hamster.
4554000	4557000	Don't glue it to the hamsters head, you know, like, or what do they do?
4557000	4558000	Staple it to the hamsters.
4558000	4559000	Safety first.
4559000	4561000	And Scrooged. That movie is great.
4561000	4566000	But, like, I want to see, or you can Photoshop a tiara onto your hamster.
4566000	4569000	I want to see your glammed up hamsters.
4569000	4571000	Photoshop dark soccer's face.
4571000	4574000	Glampsters. Yes, that's it.
4574000	4576000	That's the game that we need, Rob.
4576000	4577000	Oh my god, is that a dream game?
4577000	4579000	OLR dream game, glampsters.
4579000	4580000	Glampsters.
4580000	4582000	Hold on, hold on.
4582000	4583000	Okay, yes.
4583000	4586000	There have been games by Activision.
4587000	4591000	There's actually, I believe, like a pet's hamsters with a Z in there.
4591000	4594000	And they have had games where it's pet's fashion where you actually do dress up.
4594000	4596000	It is not that cute.
4596000	4599000	But there's also a hamtaro game.
4599000	4601000	I don't, you know.
4601000	4607000	But not like little CG actual looking hamsters that are adorable, that wear bows and tiaras and go to the beach.
4607000	4613000	I want Photoshop of a hamster with a crown on a beach chair.
4613000	4616000	That's my challenge. I mean, I could do it myself, but I'm lazy.
4616000	4621000	We're just gonna, no. This is a whole president cat thing going on here.
4621000	4623000	Because who made this?
4623000	4625000	We need to start harassing them.
4625000	4627000	Nippon Columbia, yes. I want their Twitter harassed.
4627000	4632000	And we're gonna call this game Glamsters, is the US localization title.
4632000	4635000	And I want Glamsters in the, I don't even know what it translates to.
4635000	4637000	Who cares? It's Glamsters.
4637000	4640000	And I want Glamsters in the US.
4640000	4644000	Rob, the name is essentially playing with hamsters, or playing together with hamsters.
4644000	4648000	Glamsters.
4648000	4652000	Who made this? Nippon Columbia.
4652000	4654000	Can we, what's their Twitter?
4654000	4657000	O.L. Army, get to work. Bring me a Twitter.
4657000	4660000	Alright.
4660000	4663000	Where is Ikuma JP when we need him?
4663000	4668000	I know. I mean, I appreciate Ikuma JP every week he listens, but I really need him tonight.
4668000	4670000	Where is he?
4670000	4672000	Ikuma-san, find us this Twitter.
4672000	4674000	Alright. We need you.
4674000	4676000	Anyhow, let's move on to the UK.
4676000	4678000	Captain Planet.
4678000	4680000	While we plan our wishes to get Glamsters localized.
4680000	4682000	I wish I could move to the UK, then I could avoid the bullshit here.
4682000	4684000	Alright.
4684000	4686000	Sorry.
4686000	4690000	On the 14th, which is, what, today?
4690000	4692000	Isn't it now?
4692000	4694000	Mega Man Unlimited for PC.
4694000	4698000	On the 16th, Mamoru-kun Curse on PlayStation 3.
4698000	4702000	On the 18th, Plants vs. Zombies 2. It's about time.
4702000	4706000	And that wasn't me saying that. That's actually the title.
4706000	4709000	And guess what? I'm spent.
4709000	4713000	I'm surprised Mega Man Unlimited was listed on there. I think that's a fan game.
4713000	4716000	Yeah, I think it's a fan game. We're kind of surprised that's on there.
4716000	4718000	Well, it's on there so good for them.
4718000	4720000	Yeah. Got good reviews.
4721000	4724000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.
4724000	4731000	Alright, so, yeah. Apparently, websites be getting hacked again.
4731000	4736000	So, Bohemia Interactive had their website hacked.
4736000	4739000	And you may remember them for the ARMA series.
4739000	4744000	And also, basically, they've had to reset all of the user's passwords.
4744000	4746000	As a precautionary measure.
4746000	4749000	They basically said that credit card information was not stored on the server.
4749000	4757000	And they weren't sure what was taken during the breach.
4757000	4758000	Or if anything.
4758000	4761000	But basically, all the stored passwords were encrypted.
4761000	4764000	And they're saying it's very unlikely anything can be done with the passwords.
4764000	4767000	But, you know, they reset them.
4767000	4769000	So, you got to make a new one anyways. There you go.
4769000	4774000	And Konami has also been hacked as well.
4774000	4781000	Konami's ID portal website had a large batch of unauthorized logins.
4781000	4784000	I guess during the month of June.
4784000	4788000	And basically saying that it's exposed some customer information.
4788000	4792000	And they recommend changing your passwords.
4792000	4795000	So, yeah.
4795000	4798000	And apparently also the information that may have been exposed.
4798000	4802000	Customer names, addresses, dates of birth, telephone numbers, email addresses.
4802000	4804000	And that's it.
4804000	4807000	So, change of passwords.
4807000	4809000	Yeah.
4809000	4811000	Hackers gonna hack.
4811000	4813000	Yep.
4813000	4818000	I hope your password that you used on these websites was not the same that you used on your bank website.
4818000	4821000	Because that would have been a really bad idea.
4821000	4823000	That's why these things get hacked.
4823000	4826000	For people that use the same password everywhere.
4827000	4831000	Well, maybe you'll see Glamsters on the show floor at Tokyo Game Show.
4831000	4833000	Actually you won't because it's already out in Japan.
4833000	4836000	But we can still dream it will still show up at Tokyo Game Show.
4836000	4840000	Tokyo Game Show had its list of exhibitors announced this week.
4840000	4843000	When is Tokyo Game Show? October-ish?
4843000	4844000	Usually September.
4844000	4846000	September? Yeah, it is September.
4846000	4849000	The exhibitor list is out and Microsoft's on it.
4849000	4852000	Which is a bit of a surprise because the Xbox One.
4852000	4854000	Why are you laughing over there?
4854000	4861000	We got all these cool things to show you that we're not releasing this year because the Xbox One's not coming to your region because you're second tier.
4861000	4865000	Xbox One coming to the second tier country of Japan.
4866000	4872000	Sorry, I don't say that to be offensive but the reality is that since Japan didn't support the first Xbox.
4872000	4875000	Do they have cosplay at Tokyo Game Show?
4875000	4876000	Yes.
4876000	4877000	Oh yeah.
4877000	4880000	Good, someone can cosplay at Tumbleweed and maybe roll through the booth.
4880000	4882000	You're such an ass.
4884000	4888000	Microsoft's also going to be going to Gamescom if anyone's keeping track of that.
4888000	4890000	But yeah, it'll be interesting.
4890000	4892000	Also, folks at Tokyo Game Show.
4892000	4898000	Sony, Capcom, EA, Sega, Squeenix, Konami, Namco Bandai, Tecmo Koei, Bethesda.
4898000	4900000	All those folks are going to be at Tokyo Game Show.
4900000	4902000	Guess who's not there?
4902000	4903000	Because they're never there.
4903000	4905000	Nintendo. Nintendo will not be there.
4905000	4907000	But they never do Tokyo Game Show.
4907000	4909000	They usually do their own thing that same week.
4909000	4912000	Because they're Nintendo and that's what they do.
4913000	4920000	Alright, Brad from Pod Culture in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com with a comment on the hacking article saying it is Konami's own fault they were hacked.
4920000	4924000	Their code was up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.
4925000	4927000	Womp, womp, womp, womp.
4927000	4929000	You shouldn't use the same code in every game that you make.
4929000	4930000	There you go.
4930000	4932000	Actually it's different in Proteus.
4932000	4934000	Wasn't it like literally backwards?
4934000	4935000	It was backwards.
4935000	4936000	Silly.
4936000	4942000	Alright, well, speaking of games that the Konami code might work on, we're going to take a trip down memory lane.
4943000	4944000	It won't work on this game.
4944000	4946000	That code really did work in a lot of games.
4946000	4948000	Yeah, not this game because this week is not a Konami game.
4948000	4949000	But it is the classic game of the week.
4949000	4960000	DarkSakura is going to jump into her gaming vault or maybe she'll go to an expo and see a lot of classic games and find one that she thinks, hey, respect this game or get out of my planet.
4960000	4961000	Yeah.
4961000	4962000	Off my planet.
4962000	4964000	Get off my patch of land here.
4964000	4966000	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4966000	4967000	Pinbot.
4967000	4968000	Ooh, good choice.
4968000	4969000	Yes.
4969000	4970000	And it's actually not the table.
4970000	4972000	It's the NES game that Rare developed.
4972000	4973000	Excellent choice.
4973000	4975000	Um, the game came out.
4975000	4976000	Crap, I didn't link the YouTube.
4976000	4977000	Yeah, Rob.
4977000	4979000	Sorry, it'll take me a minute to get the audio.
4979000	4980000	Got everybody.
4980000	4981000	I'm sorry for Rob.
4981000	4982000	Shut up.
4982000	4983000	I'm sorry for you.
4983000	4985000	I'm sorry for your face.
4985000	4986000	There we go.
4986000	4988000	Aw, epic Rare soundtrack.
4988000	4989000	Got it now.
4989000	4990000	Didn't have such good music.
4990000	4991000	Can we just listen to this for a minute?
4991000	4992000	Sure.
4992000	4993000	I don't want to hear you talk.
4993000	4994000	I just want to hear this.
4994000	4995000	You what?
5002000	5005000	Ah, sexy lady Pinbot.
5005000	5008000	I like her, uh, electro boots.
5008000	5011000	Alright, I suppose you can talk now.
5011000	5016000	Anyway, the game came out in North America in 1990 and it was a version of the same pinball
5016000	5018000	machine that Williams did in 1986.
5018000	5025000	The NES version actually has most of the stuff from the machine and graphically is pretty
5025000	5027000	darn accurate, I think.
5027000	5032000	Um, even down, I like how they even have like the Williams logo at the bottom and how they
5032000	5035000	did the scores where the normal price things are.
5035000	5039000	Um, so the point really is just to get points.
5039000	5043000	You start off with your marker set on Pluto and you have to go through the solar system
5043000	5049000	by hitting different targets and different checkpoint planets give you a special so you
5049000	5052000	get extra balls that way and when you reach the sun you get a super special so you get
5052000	5054000	another extra ball.
5054000	5061000	Um, you have the visor too which basically works exactly like it does in the arcade machine
5061000	5066000	and I'm sure, I really hope most of you have played the legit for reals pinball, I mean,
5066000	5068000	Pinbot before.
5068000	5073000	Um, but you have a 5x5 grid that has drop targets and once you've hit them the grid
5073000	5077000	lights, the visor opens and you can lock the balls there to start your multiball and in
5077000	5079000	this game it is a double multiball.
5079000	5085000	So, you can also relock balls while they're in multiball and get extra points.
5085000	5092000	So with this, um, basically the, to get such a long play field it actually crops it where
5092000	5099000	your flippers are and the top screen moves until it reconnects to wherever it would be
5099000	5101000	once they're joined.
5101000	5104000	Um, it has the ramps, it has everything.
5104000	5107000	It really is about the best.
5107000	5112000	I mean, other than now like on Pinmame or something it really is probably, uh, it was
5112000	5117000	the only good version of this game you could get at home apart from owning the table.
5117000	5121000	And, um, I mean I'll sit and play this sometimes too.
5121000	5128000	And one good thing about this too is that, um, it actually has, um, some of the synthesized
5128000	5130000	speech from the game.
5130000	5134000	Um, although it pauses the game to play the speech.
5134000	5137000	It has most of the music, the sound effects.
5137000	5139000	You can turn them on and off.
5139000	5142000	Um, your pause is on your second controller.
5142000	5146000	The first, um, can't because you use start and select as your nudge.
5146000	5149000	You know, make sure you don't tilt.
5149000	5154000	Um, a lot of people really, really liked it because it is a faithful rendition.
5154000	5158000	But there are people who did not like the enemies and hazards on the play field as they
5158000	5161000	were not in the original.
5161000	5166000	They did, um, Rare reused the game engine to do high speed which was also based off
5166000	5170000	of, uh, Steve Ritchie's High Speed.
5170000	5172000	Um, but it was published by, uh, Trade West.
5172000	5174000	But it used Rare's engine.
5174000	5176000	By the way, Steve Ritchie is a really cool guy.
5176000	5179000	He did the voices for Black Knight.
5179000	5184000	For, um, for, uh, No Fear.
5184000	5187000	And, uh, he's just a really cool dude.
5187000	5191000	I want to do voices on a pinball game.
5191000	5192000	Be fun.
5192000	5193000	Yeah.
5193000	5196000	Stop shaking the table.
5196000	5198000	Rob's game would be called Girl, Please.
5198000	5200000	Bitch, please.
5200000	5201000	Yeah.
5201000	5206000	But anyway, as far as other, um, pinball games that came out on the, uh, NES, there
5206000	5210000	was pinball, rollerball, rock and ball, and pinball quest.
5210000	5215000	Uh, I really think that pinbot is the brightest on the list.
5215000	5220000	Pinball quest is one of those games you kind of remember through rose colored glasses.
5220000	5222000	Like, oh man, pinball quest was awesome.
5222000	5226000	And then you go back and play it and you're like, God, it was, it had so many bugs and
5226000	5227000	issues though.
5227000	5228000	It was not good.
5228000	5230000	Pinbot is just solid.
5230000	5233000	It was a testament, I think, to, to rares, you know, early rare games.
5233000	5234000	Rollerball wasn't bad.
5234000	5235000	Rollerball wasn't bad at all.
5235000	5239000	Uh, you forgot the, the actual game called pinball from, uh, Nintendo.
5239000	5240000	Yeah, there was pinball.
5240000	5242000	But I still think that pinbot is the best of the bunch.
5242000	5243000	Yeah.
5243000	5244000	Oh yeah, I agree.
5244000	5247000	You know, rollerball was also, uh, I thought there was one other I'm not thinking of.
5247000	5248000	I'll tell you what's funny.
5248000	5253000	The actual table for rollerball was the one that I, the first game I played when I got
5253000	5254000	to the expo.
5254000	5255000	Oh.
5255000	5256000	Yeah.
5256000	5257000	I didn't know it was a real table.
5257000	5258000	Yeah.
5258000	5259000	It's like, um.
5259000	5261000	Was it like four screens tall or something?
5261000	5262000	No.
5262000	5265000	Oh, maybe I'm thinking of a different game.
5265000	5266000	Or maybe it was roller games.
5266000	5267000	Roller games is one of them.
5267000	5269000	Yeah, I think you're, I think you're blending those.
5269000	5272000	Because I think rollerball on NES was like a four screen tall table.
5272000	5273000	Yeah, it was.
5273000	5274000	I was thinking of roller games.
5274000	5275000	Sorry.
5275000	5278000	Um, you know which one I always wish would get, uh, would have had a release like that?
5278000	5280000	It was hyperball.
5280000	5283000	The one where you have, like, the major multi balls and that's all you do is shoot, like,
5283000	5286000	pinballs all day and all night until you hit these little side targets.
5286000	5288000	Rollerball would have, uh, uh, hyperball would have been fun.
5288000	5289000	I think.
5289000	5290000	But digress.
5290000	5291000	Pinbot.
5291000	5292000	Classic.
5292000	5296000	It's, you can't go wrong with Pinbot.
5296000	5297000	Alright.
5297000	5301000	And if you have, anyone ever thinks to get a classic table, Pinbot makes a great start
5301000	5304000	and it makes really good for trading up later.
5304000	5305000	Alright, there it is.
5305000	5306000	Your classic game of the week.
5306000	5308000	Pinbot for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
5308000	5309000	One of my favorites.
5309000	5311000	A non-Sega game.
5311000	5312000	Oh, my stars and daughters.
5312000	5313000	You know what?
5313000	5314000	I do non-Sega games all the time.
5314000	5315000	I've done compile.
5315000	5317000	Non-Sega slash non-tomographic.
5317000	5318000	Non-tomographic game.
5318000	5319000	I've done Irem.
5319000	5320000	Alright, no, it was good times.
5320000	5324000	Uh, some folks in chat reminiscing about some of the portable pinball games that were really
5324000	5325000	good.
5325000	5327000	Uh, Fifth Dream says Pokemon Pinball owned.
5327000	5330000	Uh, Black Wolf says I enjoyed Metroid Prime Pinball in the DS.
5330000	5331000	Yeah, both were really good.
5331000	5333000	What was the game that was on the old, the original Game Boy?
5333000	5334000	Was it Revenge of the Gator?
5334000	5335000	Revenge of the Gator.
5335000	5336000	That one was fun.
5336000	5337000	Yeah, that was great.
5337000	5338000	Revenge of the Gator was great.
5338000	5340000	I would stay up all night playing that damn game.
5340000	5341000	I remember playing that in seventh grade.
5341000	5343000	Were you a Revenge of the Gator fan, Bradley?
5343000	5346000	No, I was thinking about something even earlier.
5346000	5347000	Oh, your mic cut out.
5347000	5348000	I don't know why.
5348000	5349000	Let me, yeah, just uh.
5349000	5350000	Oh yeah, it came off the end there.
5350000	5353000	Okay, I was thinking something even earlier than these games.
5353000	5357000	It was a, I don't know if it was based on any real pinball table, but there was a pinball
5357000	5362000	on, uh, on the Atari 2600, uh, like Midnight Magic or something like that.
5362000	5363000	Yeah.
5363000	5364000	I don't remember.
5364000	5365000	Atari had one of their own too.
5365000	5368000	Yeah, it was like a really basic sort of thing.
5368000	5375000	One of my favorite Commodore 64 games ever was Pinball Construction Set by ECA.
5375000	5377000	That's what EA used to be back in the day was ECA.
5377000	5379000	Pinball Construction Set was awesome.
5379000	5383000	Like you, it was literally build your own damn pinball table, but people would, you
5383000	5387000	know, uh, there was no internet really back then, but you could find, you would disc trade
5387000	5391000	with people and get their pinball tables and yeah, you could find some pretty epic stuff
5391000	5392000	out there.
5392000	5393000	Amazing.
5393000	5396000	So, uh, lots of props for Revenge of the Gator in our chat room.
5396000	5398000	Black Wolf says I loved it.
5398000	5401000	Rama says Revenge of the Gator was godly.
5401000	5403000	I knew Black Wolf would remember Pinball Construction Set.
5403000	5404000	I knew he would.
5404000	5405000	I knew he would.
5405000	5406000	There you go.
5406000	5407000	Good times.
5407000	5408000	Hmm.
5408000	5414000	You know, I was actually just thinking that it would be cool if, you know, cause you know,
5414000	5417000	like, uh, there's actually a pinball table for Rollercoaster Tycoon.
5417000	5423000	Um, it would be cool if they did like sim pin now, you know, where it's, you build your
5423000	5429000	pinball tables and then put them out on, um, on, uh, like, uh, some, you know, something
5429000	5433000	like steam, you know, you put your, you have the crater and you put your tables up for
5433000	5435000	other people to download and compare and rate.
5435000	5439000	Or how about just freaking pinball construction set, but like, you know.
5439000	5444000	And I think that the game you were thinking of was called, uh, David's Midnight Magic,
5444000	5445000	wasn't it?
5445000	5451000	No, there was a midnight magic for Atari 2600, but there was also a David's Midnight Magic.
5451000	5453000	See, here's the pinball construction set.
5453000	5456000	Let me see if there's actually music or if somebody talking in this clip here on YouTube,
5456000	5459000	but yeah, you can see that they're putting together their little pinball table and they
5459000	5462000	put a little ramps and all the stuff you use to build it.
5462000	5467000	So they're on the side and then if we actually see like a finished table here, it was David's
5467000	5468000	Midnight Magic.
5468000	5470000	There's also a Commodore 64 version, Rob.
5470000	5471000	Nice.
5471000	5474000	And, uh, it was on the Atari computers and the Atari 800.
5474000	5475000	I'm sorry.
5475000	5478000	The Atari 2600 version was just called Midnight Magic.
5478000	5479000	Hmm.
5479000	5480000	Very cool.
5480000	5481000	All right.
5481000	5484000	Uh, that's going to do it for this part a of Orange Lawn Tradio, but don't go anywhere.
5484000	5486000	We've got more of Orange Lawn Tradio to come after the break.
5486000	5487000	Oh my God.
5487000	5488000	Crewball.
5488000	5489000	That was awful.
5489000	5490000	Crewball, apparently.
5490000	5494000	Uh, the mailbag, the Fugu Question of the Week, your phone calls, and some more stories,
5494000	5497000	including, yes, we're going to talk about that little controversy that went down between
5497000	5501000	Nintendo and Evo and, uh, speaking of Nintendo, a possible new franchise for them next year.
5501000	5506000	We'll talk all about that when we come back with more of Orange Lawn Tradio right after this.
5513000	5514000	Hi there.
5514000	5518000	My name is Elliot B, and you're participating with Orange Lawn Tradio, the show where every
5518000	5523000	gamer has a voice, and I want to use my voice to tell you that Donkey Kong Country 2 is
5523000	5526000	the best game ever released on the Super Nintendo.
5526000	5530000	It has musical apes fighting reptilian pirates.
5530000	5532000	What more could you ask for?
5533000	5535000	Boobs.
5535000	5542000	Welcome back to Orange Lawn Tradio, live with episode number 512, July the 14th of 2013.
5542000	5545000	Big thanks to Elliot there for the bumper, even though that's the second time you all
5545000	5549000	have heard it, because I don't have any new bumpers to play, so I think you guys need
5549000	5550000	to fix that.
5550000	5554000	For more information about sending a bumper to Orange Lawn Tradio, check out vognetwork.com
5554000	5557000	and the forums has all the information there in Orange Lawn Tradio.
5557000	5560000	Everything you need to know there.
5560000	5565000	Uh, I'm playing the, um, new Find Me games during the break because I streetpassed with
5565000	5569000	Bradley, who's sitting here in studio tonight, and I also streetpassed with Dark Sakura.
5569000	5573000	Now, one thing I noticed about this Warriors Way, which I'm still trying to figure this
5573000	5579000	game out, it's basically like you have troops, and the troops number is based on the number
5579000	5582000	of people you've had ever in your plaza.
5582000	5587000	Now, I streetpassed with a friend of mine that does some of the shadowcasting for movies
5587000	5594000	here locally, and he's like, dude, Rob, like, you gave me 700 people for my army in Warriors
5594000	5597000	Way, and I'm like, yeah, yeah, I've been to E3 and all this stuff.
5597000	5601000	You know, I've picked up quite a few people, and he's like, you helped me beat a level,
5601000	5602000	and I'm like, cool.
5602000	5604000	So I'm like, alright, I'm awesome, I have a big army.
5604000	5607000	Well, I just streetpassed here with Brad, who came into Warriors Way.
5607000	5610000	25,000 people?!
5610000	5614000	You've streetpassed with 25,000 people?!
5614000	5618000	That isn't, actually, that isn't the right, that's because, that's like the monarch,
5618000	5621000	that's what the person who's actually played the game,
5621000	5622000	Yeah.
5622000	5623000	come as a monarch.
5623000	5625000	Oh, wait, wait, you're not, okay, sorry, we're not hearing you for some reason.
5625000	5627000	No, it's my fault, I didn't mute you.
5627000	5628000	Sorry, Bradley.
5628000	5630000	Okay, so that's not exactly how many I've streetpassed.
5630000	5634000	I actually have a thousand, like, a little over a thousand streetpasses.
5634000	5635000	Still, that's a lot.
5635000	5640000	But the army is 25,000 because, as you play the game, you get more people into your army,
5640000	5642000	and then, and it'll show you the actual force.
5642000	5646000	I think it's, you come in as a monarch if you've actually been playing the game,
5646000	5647000	Yeah.
5647000	5651000	and then that's when you'll see something more than, like, a few hundred to a thousand.
5651000	5652000	Uh-huh.
5652000	5653000	Okay.
5653000	5655000	25,000, showing what my actual armory is right now.
5655000	5661000	But, your people weren't like, oh, I'm gonna join up, you tried to attack me or something,
5661000	5662000	I'm like, rude!
5662000	5666000	Yeah, so that's what happens if a monarch comes in, you have to,
5666000	5667000	Ugh.
5667000	5669000	you have to either let them go in peacefully or attack them.
5669000	5670000	Assert them.
5670000	5671000	Well,
5671000	5672000	Basically, crush your army.
5672000	5677000	I did not get 25,000 troops from Bradley, but I did get, like, 50 from Dark Sakura,
5677000	5678000	so that helped me.
5678000	5680000	That'll, that'll help a little bit.
5680000	5681000	What?
5681000	5682000	There we go.
5682000	5689000	Alright, um, moving on, we're going to get back into some gaming news here, starting
5689000	5691000	off with Loki.
5691000	5692000	Yes.
5692000	5698000	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about, um, Crazy Taxi.
5698000	5699000	That's right.
5699000	5700000	Crazy Taxi.
5700000	5701000	Are we gonna make some crazy money?
5701000	5702000	Possibly.
5702000	5709000	And, Crazy Taxi has come to Android, and, um, yeah, it's out for, uh, five bucks.
5709000	5712000	It's basically like the, uh, IOS port.
5712000	5715000	They've got, uh, the two modes, original and arcade.
5715000	5718000	And I think some of the music's back, too, so, um, that's good.
5718000	5722000	I mean, I'm sure they don't have Pizza Hut and all that stuff in there, but, um, still
5722000	5723000	fun.
5723000	5727000	And I think it does support some controllers, so the first thing I'm gonna do with this
5727000	5732000	game is I'm gonna sideload it onto the Ouya to see if it works, so that's gonna be, uh,
5732000	5734000	mission number one, I guess.
5734000	5739000	Um, new Ratchet and Clank game was, uh, revealed this week into the Nexus.
5739000	5746000	That's gonna be, um, coming out at some undetermined point, I guess, holiday, uh, for thirty bucks,
5746000	5749000	and, um, on PlayStation 3.
5749000	5751000	So, look for it then.
5751000	5758000	And, uh, last but not least, uh, we have some more details about the PlayStation Plus version
5758000	5759000	of Drive Club.
5759000	5762000	Obviously, it will be missing a few things.
5762000	5766000	It's basically the exact same version as the full version, except it's missing a few
5766000	5772000	assets, such as, um, some of the cars or tracks that will be found in the full version.
5772000	5778000	Um, I guess the PlayStation Plus edition, I guess, will feature online multiplayer and
5778000	5781000	the single-player campaign, as well as some of the challenges.
5781000	5784000	Uh, you will be able to purchase missing content.
5784000	5788000	But press the R2 button to upgrade to the full version of Drive Club now.
5788000	5792000	I think it's not gonna be as expensive as buying the full version of Drive Club, but
5792000	5795000	still, I mean, if you wanna check it out, that's kind of a cool thing.
5795000	5798000	And you don't have to buy the full version of it.
5798000	5802000	I mean, like, for example, if someone like me just wants to play it, like, on a VoG gaming
5802000	5805000	night or something like that, I don't need to buy the full version.
5805000	5807000	You know, I can just play it as is.
5807000	5809000	So, it'll be cool to check out.
5809000	5810000	Yeah, I mean, I wasn't expecting...
5810000	5816000	To get a release game on the system's release for free, I mean, usually the PS Plus games
5816000	5817000	aren't, like, new stuff.
5817000	5819000	Like, it's usually a year old.
5819000	5823000	So, I'm not totally surprised by this, that it's basically a glorified demo.
5823000	5826000	But it sounds like it'll at least have, like, some multiplayer.
5826000	5828000	So, it'll give you a little something.
5828000	5831000	I mean, this is what we get now instead of a pack-in game, right?
5831000	5833000	A free download coupon.
5833000	5837000	Technically, you get a pack-in thing, but it's, you know, only if you have the camera.
5837000	5839000	Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah, the cam...
5839000	5840000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5840000	5843000	I don't have the camera, so I guess I'm screwed.
5843000	5847000	Because I was lucky enough to order a PlayStation 4 early, and I don't plan on changing that.
5847000	5850000	Anyway, moving on to other news.
5850000	5852000	Capcom had some layoffs this week.
5852000	5854000	That's always a bit disappointing.
5854000	5859000	One of the people affected, Christian Svensson, which is the Senior VP, excuse me,
5859000	5861000	of Planning and Business Development.
5861000	5863000	He apparently is departing the company.
5863000	5865000	Capcom said in a statement,
5865000	5871000	Capcom today laid off several employees from the US office as part of an overall organizational restructure of the company.
5871000	5878000	The transition to new generation of hardware and changing industry landscape have required us to adapt our business to best meet our new goals.
5878000	5882000	We sincerely thank each individual for their contributions and wish them well.
5882000	5884000	Well, this is never fun news to report.
5884000	5887000	Trying to kind of figure out the why behind this, though.
5887000	5892000	Is this because maybe expectations of Lost Planet 3 and so forth are kind of low?
5892000	5893000	It's because there's no more Mega Man?
5893000	5894000	It's all Mega Man's fault.
5894000	5895000	It's all Mega Man's fault.
5895000	5896000	All Mega Man.
5896000	5897000	It's all Mega Man's fault.
5897000	5899000	If they did Mega Man Legends 3, they wouldn't have this problem.
5899000	5902000	Now, now, no need to kick them while they're down.
5902000	5913000	Alright, Reggie Fils-Aime in a video on YouTube mentioned that Nintendo fans can pick up Pikmin 3 early at certain video game retailers.
5913000	5920000	July 20th and 21st, you can actually do like a hands-on demo at over 250 GameStop and EB Games locations.
5920000	5923000	They still have EB Games up and running different places?
5923000	5924000	A foreign company.
5924000	5925000	Oh, in Canada.
5925000	5926000	Yeah.
5926000	5930000	So the US and Canada will have Pikmin 3 experiences or whatever.
5930000	5938000	If you pre-order the downloadable version of the game at any GameStop store on either of those two days.
5938000	5942000	So you have to go get a download code at GameStop on one of those two days.
5942000	5946000	You will be able to get the full game one whole day early on August 3rd.
5946000	5948000	Or you can go to Kmart.
5948000	5950000	Who breaks street dates.
5950000	5952000	Or Toys R Us.
5952000	5957000	Or apparently Walmart is the new street date breaker because you know you can get them Twinkies at Walmart.
5957000	5958000	Yeah.
5958000	5961000	It's rogue Twinkies in the Walmart aisles.
5961000	5965000	Or just wait a day. It's Pikmin. It's not fucking Grand Theft Auto 5 or something.
5965000	5966000	Right?
5966000	5969000	I mean, that's what you got, you know, that...
5969000	5973000	I mean, think of the deal with the devil that you're making here.
5973000	5981000	I mean, you're like buying a digital download code at retail to play it one day early.
5981000	5986000	And they will make you sign a pact at GameStop that you will have to sign with blood.
5986000	5991000	Hey, let's give us your email. Hey, why don't you send it for the card, you know, so that we can...
5991000	5993000	Hey, you want to get our magazine?
5993000	5995000	You got Pikmin 2 to trade in?
5995000	5998000	Tristan told their magazine is actually pretty decent.
5998000	6001000	You got any other Wii U games you want to trade in?
6001000	6004000	Oh yeah, there aren't any Wii U games out there to trade in.
6004000	6007000	There are. They're just not worth anything.
6007000	6010000	Well, remember Nintendo's philosophy is make games that people want to keep.
6010000	6013000	To be fair, like the games I own, I don't want to trade in.
6013000	6017000	Maybe the Sonic Racing game. I guess that wasn't that great.
6017000	6019000	But I still like it enough.
6019000	6021000	Nothing is ever as good as Sonic R.
6021000	6022000	Alright.
6022000	6026000	Also, one more story about Super Street Fighter IV.
6026000	6029000	Apparently still going with updates.
6029000	6037000	There was a panel at Evo announcing Hyper Street Fighter IV with five new characters.
6037000	6039000	Four of them have been named.
6039000	6043000	Alina, Poison, Rolento, and Hugo.
6043000	6044000	Rolento!
6044000	6047000	Which are all based off of the fact that they were in Street Fighter X Tekken.
6047000	6050000	So I'm guessing that they'll be easy enough to bring over.
6050000	6052000	So those are the only four confirmed characters at the moment.
6052000	6055000	No word about the mystery fifth character.
6055000	6058000	Although not... It doesn't sound like it's Alex.
6058000	6059000	Alina's a fun one.
6059000	6064000	I guess there was a rumor going around that it was Alex, but it doesn't appear to be Alex.
6064000	6067000	So, um, interesting.
6067000	6071000	What is this all about here? $15 for the download.
6071000	6077000	Don't know what the date will be, but there will also be a disc-based version, which I'm assuming is everything, for $40.
6077000	6079000	Early 2014 is the tentative release.
6079000	6085000	You know, I'd like to see some of the EX characters make it into the new Street Fighter IV stuff.
6085000	6087000	It's pretty cool that this game is still going.
6087000	6090000	I mean, thanks to updates and DLC and all that.
6090000	6092000	You're shaking your head over there. You're a hater, Loki.
6092000	6094000	How many times have they re-released this game?
6094000	6095000	I mean, seriously, they've had...
6095000	6097000	How many times have they re-released Street Fighter II?
6097000	6102000	I understand that, but they had Street Fighter, Super Street, or they had Street Fighter IV.
6102000	6104000	Then they had Super Street Fighter IV.
6104000	6106000	Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition.
6106000	6108000	I'm talking all disc-based releases.
6108000	6112000	And now they're gonna have hyper Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition?
6113000	6114000	No.
6114000	6116000	You draw the lines.
6116000	6119000	Stop buying that game. Seriously.
6119000	6123000	It's done. Just make a new Street Fighter game.
6123000	6127000	Give me Capcom vs. SNK III.
6127000	6133000	I don't care what evil, satanic pacts have to be formed between those companies to get this to happen,
6133000	6135000	but I want that game.
6136000	6138000	Give it to me.
6138000	6141000	Alright, moving on. Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
6143000	6145000	Anything? Dark Soccer? Hello?
6145000	6147000	I'm waiting for...
6147000	6150000	Sonic 4 is going to have its episodes on Ouya.
6150000	6158000	So I guess if you like crappy Sonic games and crappy systems, then you can play Sonic 4 on Ouya.
6158000	6163000	Also though, and this is good news, Sonic CD is going to be out on Ouya,
6163000	6166000	and it better freaking have the Japanese soundtrack.
6166000	6170000	They're just porting the... They're not even porting the game over.
6170000	6173000	I mean, it works with controller support already.
6173000	6175000	You can sideload that thing in there.
6175000	6178000	Because I have a Sonic CD, I got it with my Moga controller,
6178000	6182000	and I think it's siloed on my Ouya, actually.
6182000	6186000	I don't remember if I did that or not, but it works.
6186000	6190000	Osega of America saying that it's going to be soon.
6190000	6193000	That same soon that we always refer to.
6193000	6199000	Also, fans of Skullgirls can be happy that it's coming on PC on August 22nd.
6199000	6204000	Being put out by Lab Zero Games, and I know a lot of people are totally into Skullgirls.
6205000	6208000	They're also working on five new characters as DLC,
6208000	6212000	which is coming directly from their Indiegogo campaign.
6212000	6215000	They've actually exceeded their $150,000 goal.
6215000	6219000	They've made $828,768.
6219000	6222000	So, yay more Skullgirls.
6223000	6230000	And then, this one, I'm actually going to relink this one because it's on Capcom Unity.
6230000	6232000	But I wanted to talk about it.
6232000	6239000	The PS3 art for DuckTales Remastered, the box art, has been released,
6239000	6242000	and it's looking pretty darn good.
6242000	6245000	And I'm really looking forward to this.
6245000	6248000	There's also a link on here to the documentaries,
6248000	6253000	which talks about the game itself and the development.
6253000	6256000	So, I'm going to go ahead and actually relink this one in the chat room.
6256000	6260000	And if any people who are listening to the podcast want to look forward,
6260000	6263000	just go to Capcom Unity and look through their blog.
6263000	6267000	Yeah, they're actually going to do a physical retail release with pins in it.
6267000	6269000	Nice.
6269000	6273000	Yeah, I heard about that. It's a week later, though, which sucks.
6273000	6276000	But, it might still be worth it.
6276000	6279000	Rob, life is like a hurricane.
6280000	6281000	It blows?
6281000	6282000	No.
6282000	6283000	What?
6283000	6285000	The song? The theme song?
6285000	6287000	Rock you like a hurricane.
6287000	6289000	DuckTales, Rob, theme song.
6289000	6291000	I get it, I get it, I get it.
6291000	6292000	Just a little slow.
6292000	6294000	Geez, Rob.
6294000	6298000	By the way, though, I listened to the Japanese theme song for DuckTales.
6298000	6300000	It's kind of interesting.
6300000	6302000	It's a song by a lady.
6305000	6307000	Oh, time for the Fugu Question of the Week, right?
6307000	6309000	I didn't realize that was our last story.
6309000	6312000	G-Rob, you know, you got on me for being quiet, always pulling up everything.
6312000	6314000	And now you're doing it, too.
6314000	6316000	I was playing Mii Plaza games, it was very important.
6316000	6318000	Hot kettle, pot pot kettle.
6318000	6319000	Very, very important.
6319000	6320000	My butt.
6323000	6324000	Let's see.
6324000	6326000	Looking at chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
6326000	6330000	Apparently, BlackWolf made a Vine of me playing Pimbot Ness, me meaning him,
6330000	6333000	while listening to OLR, but Vine decides not to accept the upload.
6333000	6336000	I guess this is why everybody ran away to Instagram.
6338000	6339000	Sad.
6340000	6342000	Have you guys played with the Instagram video at all?
6342000	6343000	No.
6343000	6344000	No.
6344000	6348000	Rob, Instagram is like, so three months ago, I swear.
6348000	6349000	Oh, Hipstagram.
6349000	6351000	Alright, here, I had to hear this.
6351000	6356000	I need to use a top-level digital camera out of irony.
6373000	6382000	Amazing.
6382000	6383000	Still catchy.
6383000	6388000	Some things transcend language barriers, and a catchy melody is one of those things.
6388000	6390000	Alright, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.
6390000	6394000	Maybe this little theme song here is a catchy melody for some of you out there.
6394000	6396000	It's my vehicle.
6401000	6406000	Every week, we go to our Facebook and Google Plus fan communities and ask a question,
6406000	6409000	and we read some of our favorite answers here live on air.
6409000	6413000	Or if we have enough time, which I guess we probably do tonight with the answers we were given,
6413000	6415000	we will read all the answers.
6415000	6421000	So this weekend, Dark Sakura and Bradley attended California Extreme,
6421000	6426000	which is a classic arcade game show in the Bay Area that is a celebration of pinball machines and classic game machines.
6426000	6433000	Is there a classic arcade or pinball machine that you've never played that you've always wanted to try?
6433000	6438000	If you can't think of one, is there one you remember from a long time ago that you really want to play again?
6438000	6442000	So we wanted to show some love to classic games in this week's FUGL question.
6442000	6448000	Retertainment says, there's what I call a classic arcade game that I've played that I'd like to play again, The Act.
6448000	6455000	This is an extremely rare arcade game that, according to Wikipedia, only one arcade has a working stand-up arcade copy of it.
6455000	6460000	It just so happens the one arcade with a stand-up copy of The Act is located near me.
6460000	6462000	It looks like I have something to do on Monday.
6462000	6464000	What is The Act? I don't even know that one.
6464000	6468000	The Act is a game. It's all hand-drawn animation.
6468000	6472000	It's basically about this guy who's in love with some girl.
6472000	6479000	It kind of, like, think of it as almost like a Dragon's Lair type game, but it's not really like that.
6479000	6485000	They built it for, like, iOS and Android and stuff, and it has a lot of contextual sensitive stuff in there.
6485000	6490000	But it looks pretty cool. It's all, you know, gorgeous and looks like it has a good story.
6490000	6498000	Let's see, Rababa responds on Google Plus and says, I've always wanted to try Hyperball, the ball-bearing gun rapid-fire pinball.
6498000	6504000	Jamie probably has, and I'm curious as to the general object of that game. Spell things? Shoot them faster than they drain?
6504000	6509000	I talked about it earlier. I just like shooting them really fast, just because it's fun.
6509000	6517000	And there's so many, it's like you can play with so many balls. You can paddle balls all day.
6517000	6519000	You just took all those balls all at once, didn't you guys?
6519000	6524000	And I beat them. I beat those balls with flippers.
6524000	6526000	With your flipper?
6526000	6528000	With my flippers.
6531000	6533000	That game is fucking loud, by the way.
6533000	6538000	Going to Facebook, which, by the way, I just want to point out over on Facebook right now,
6538000	6545000	we have 572 people that like us on Facebook, which is a nice, admirable number, but we're 572.
6545000	6549000	We need one more like, and then there'll be a huge Bamani and joke there.
6549000	6554000	Come on, people. One more like on Facebook. Somebody give it to us.
6554000	6559000	30K replied and said, Simpsons Pinball. There were actually two Simpsons Pinball machines with her.
6559000	6561000	Was it Simpsons Pinball Party, are you thinking?
6561000	6563000	There's an old one and a newer one, isn't there?
6563000	6565000	Simpsons Pinball Party we used to have at my house.
6565000	6566000	Yeah.
6566000	6567000	It's a pretty fun table.
6567000	6570000	Andy R. said, I was a bit young during the arcade boom, so I don't remember,
6570000	6577000	but if I can expand to non-classic arcade games, I really want to play ju-beat or, u-beat,
6577000	6581000	I always say that wrong, excuse me, u-beat or reflect-beat in an arcade.
6581000	6587000	I love rhythm games like Technica and I feel these games would be a lot more fun in the arcade than their iPad equivalents.
6587000	6588000	You'd be right.
6588000	6593000	Sadly, I no longer live near Round 1 or Sunnyvale Golf Land, so I guess I'll have to settle for the iPad.
6593000	6598000	Xtafer replied and said, Growing up, I loved plating side-scrolling games, I think he meant playing,
6598000	6601000	side-scrolling games in the arcade like Shinobi or Strider.
6601000	6605000	I also have fond memories of Golden Axe and Super Mario Brothers.
6605000	6607000	Which, actually that reminds me of something, Rob.
6607000	6610000	You know what game they also had there, speaking of side-scrolling?
6610000	6611000	Willow.
6611000	6612000	Oh.
6612000	6613000	That Willow arcade.
6613000	6614000	Amazing.
6614000	6620000	Sorry for the Facebook noises, they're not disabled on this computer and frickin' people are setting it off on purpose.
6620000	6626000	Alright, Thomas B. replies and says, Have you ever heard of the pinball machine Hercules?
6626000	6627000	Yes.
6627000	6628000	I believe it used 4-inch balls.
6628000	6633000	The machine was very large, I only played it a few times, but it was always fun to play.
6633000	6634000	Do you like big balls, Dark Soccer?
6634000	6635000	And I cannot lie.
6635000	6636000	It used a cue ball.
6636000	6638000	Oh, like in pool?
6638000	6639000	Yeah.
6639000	6646000	And they had one at the last classic gaming expo I went to, it was at California Extreme
6646000	6650000	two years ago, they also had that dressed up Captain Fantastic 2.
6650000	6655000	The big Elden John platform boots from Tommy.
6655000	6660000	But Hercules is actually, I'm short, I have a hard time playing that game because I can't
6660000	6661000	really...
6661000	6663000	You can't reach the balls?
6663000	6667000	No, I have to, it's like as wide out as my arms go.
6667000	6670000	It's like my wingspan, and hitting the flippers is difficult.
6670000	6673000	And it moves slowly.
6673000	6676000	Dark Tetsuya says, There was one I played years ago in Santa Cruz that I'd love to chance
6676000	6679000	to play again, Namco's Galaxian III.
6679000	6683000	Imagine a gigantic booth with six seats, two 50-inch monitors with a separate laser displayer
6683000	6687000	for each one, and six Star Wars-style flight controllers.
6687000	6691000	You fly along in your gunship, shooting at aliens as they fly in formation, while occasionally
6691000	6693000	dealing with a gigantic alien boss.
6693000	6696000	And it's up to you and your teammates to take them down before they deplete your ship's
6696000	6697000	life meter to zero.
6697000	6699000	Suffice to say, it's pretty epic.
6699000	6701000	Do you want to know something depressing?
6701000	6708000	At our Roseville Dave and Busters, right by the redemption area, there is this booth
6708000	6713000	for a different game, but that booth was once a Galaxian III booth.
6713000	6717000	It even has some of the decorating elements on it.
6717000	6720000	That used to be a Galaxian III.
6720000	6723000	Let's see.
6723000	6727000	Will M. replied and said, An arcade game I've never played and would love to.
6727000	6730000	Difficult to answer as I've played a massive amount due to traveling around, but I can
6730000	6732000	name one I'd love to play again.
6732000	6733000	The Ninja Warriors.
6733000	6736000	That widescreen was oh so damn awesome.
6736000	6739000	Chiggers says, I remember playing The Kiss Table when I was a kid.
6739000	6741000	I loved it.
6741000	6745000	Ragenator said, I never had the opportunity to play the arcade version of Killer Instinct,
6745000	6746000	which I regret.
6746000	6751000	In terms of stuff I want to play again, it's Samurai Shodown IV, Amakusa's Revenge.
6751000	6756000	Hitstun says, I want to play Data East's 1990 side-scrolling beat-em-up masterpiece,
6756000	6758000	Trio the Punch, Never Forget Me.
6758000	6762000	What it lacks in graphical power, responsive controls, or music changes, it makes up for
6762000	6764000	in being batshit insane.
6764000	6769000	Enemies include a giant bronze foot that stomps you, enemies that plant bombs that self-destruct
6769000	6774000	in fear of those same bombs, a giant statue of Karnov carried by four smaller Karnovs,
6774000	6779000	and Colonel Sanders with a head that explodes to reveal a purple bird that froze fried chicken
6779000	6780000	at you.
6780000	6781000	What?
6781000	6782000	Sounds a lot like Proteus.
6782000	6786000	The game's only console release is a Japanese PlayStation 2 exclusive.
6786000	6789000	He could have made that up and I'd never know the difference.
6789000	6793000	Codeman replied and said, I know this sounds like a generic answer, but I've always wanted
6793000	6795000	to play the Tron arcade game.
6795000	6796000	Which one?
6796000	6798000	That's true, there was Tron and Discs of Tron.
6798000	6802000	They had actually Tron and Discs of Tron next to each other.
6802000	6806000	Codeman, more reason for you to go to Disneyland, just saying.
6806000	6810000	And I know you have a little girl who soon will be old enough to appreciate Disneyland,
6810000	6811000	just saying.
6811000	6814000	If you take a child to Disneyland before they're five years old, they get him free.
6814000	6815000	There you go.
6815000	6817000	And a game called Time Pilot.
6817000	6818000	Time Pilot's fun.
6818000	6822000	That is, for what it's worth, that's on Xbox Live Arcade, and it plays pretty decently
6822000	6825000	with a 360 analog stick, just for what it's worth.
6825000	6827000	And it was in Game Room.
6827000	6832000	And lastly, Kane I Am says, not that I ever played it, but I really want the Elvira Mistress
6832000	6835000	of the Darkness table for my house, because boobies.
6835000	6836000	Excellent answer.
6836000	6838000	That is a great table too.
6838000	6841000	Which one, the Elvira Mistress or the Scared Stiff?
6841000	6843000	Elvira Mistress of the Dark.
6843000	6845000	Scared Stiff I think is a better table.
6845000	6851000	Okay, so I know you saw this, Dark Sakura, because Alan and I went out to a bar in San
6851000	6856000	Francisco after the Frank music concert on the 4th of July, or the night before the 4th
6856000	6857000	of July.
6857000	6860000	We went out in San Francisco, we went to this bar in the Castro called Moby Dick, and they
6860000	6862000	had pinball machines there.
6862000	6869000	And, like, literally, it was like Dark Sakura and Alan Alchemy, Pinball Paradise, because
6869000	6873000	they had a World Cup Soccer 94, and they had Elvira Scared Stiff.
6873000	6875000	Okay, I need to go there.
6875000	6876000	Yeah.
6876000	6877000	First of all-
6877000	6879000	And gays, and booze, and a pool table.
6879000	6883000	Like, five of my favorite things together.
6883000	6886000	That actually is like college for me.
6886000	6890000	Well, keep in mind, I worked in a pool hall.
6890000	6896000	I'm very certain that my boss, even though he was a major dick, was also, he did set
6896000	6898000	off the Gator a bit.
6898000	6902000	And, of course, there were also the three other guys that I used to hang out with.
6902000	6905000	Anyway, anyway, I've been a hag all my life, Rob, what are you talking about?
6905000	6906000	It's fine.
6906000	6908000	So, and then we had the World Cup Soccer there.
6908000	6914000	Across the street, at Solomon's, they had the Mistress of the Dark.
6914000	6918000	But did your pool hall let people play free if they weren't wearing pants?
6918000	6920000	Because this place did.
6920000	6925000	No, usually, if they weren't wearing pants, well, I don't know, I could wear a skirt,
6925000	6927000	then I wouldn't be wearing pants.
6927000	6929000	What if a guy comes in in a Utila kilt?
6929000	6930000	Does that count?
6930000	6935000	I didn't question the system, because nobody wants to see me up there playing it, so.
6935000	6938000	You know what, you should just have, like, sequined boxers.
6938000	6940000	And wear those.
6940000	6942000	How do you know I don't?
6942000	6945000	Alan, does Rob have sequined boxers?
6945000	6949000	The 1970s, you know, basketball shorts.
6949000	6952000	Like the ones that are, like, up to here.
6952000	6954000	They have, like, the teeny slit on the side.
6954000	6956000	Like your ass literally hangs out of them, yeah.
6956000	6957000	You need to go in Columbia shorts.
6957000	6958000	That's not sexy at all.
6958000	6959000	None of this is sexy.
6959000	6960000	Columbia shorts.
6960000	6961000	None of this is sexy.
6961000	6962000	Columbia shorts.
6963000	6964000	Alright.
6964000	6966000	That was all our answers.
6966000	6969000	Thank you guys at Facebook and Google Plus for answering the question.
6969000	6970000	Really appreciate it.
6970000	6973000	If you didn't get your question, or your answer read this week, sorry.
6973000	6975000	But try sending an email.
6975000	6977000	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
6977000	6979000	Let me quickly open that up to folks here in studio.
6979000	6984000	Is there an elusive game you haven't been able to play, or maybe something you played once long ago you're dying to play again?
6984000	6985000	Bradley?
6985000	6988000	I was thinking of, it was, when I played it a long time ago,
6988000	6998000	Galaxy Force 2, the actual arcade game that actually had a full rotating seat, or sit-down cabinet where you basically...
6998000	6999000	Sumo.
6999000	7001000	Yeah, but full rotating.
7001000	7003000	Like, could you actually go upside down and stuff?
7003000	7005000	Well, full rotating, 103.
7005000	7006000	Oh, yeah, 360.
7006000	7007000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7007000	7008000	I get it.
7008000	7009000	You're not rotating upside down.
7009000	7010000	You're just going left and right.
7010000	7011000	But that was pretty cool.
7011000	7015000	And then, like, the home version that was on the Saturn didn't really do it justice, I think.
7016000	7019000	Or maybe it was just a really janky game I didn't know until later.
7019000	7021000	Loki?
7021000	7024000	Well, I would have said the Galaxian 3, but someone already said that.
7024000	7032000	I would be willing to try the Silent Hill arcade game, because I still haven't played that, and I know that was something that they made a while ago.
7032000	7035000	So the Silent Hill arcade game would be fun.
7035000	7041000	And although it's not really an arcade game, I'd love to go back and play Battletech again as part of Virtual World.
7041000	7043000	Did Alan just text you?
7043000	7045000	Yes, he did, and he said no.
7045000	7047000	Alan!
7047000	7049000	Jamie, is there something that's been eluding you?
7049000	7056000	I would like to play a radiant silver gun again, because I've played an arcade version of that, and I loved Gun Survivor 2.
7056000	7066000	I think what I would actually like to play again as far as tables that I haven't seen in a little while is a black rose.
7066000	7068000	And I've been trying to get Dan to get us one.
7068000	7070000	I would love to have a black rose.
7071000	7074000	Because you shoot a cannon, and you're a pirate wench.
7074000	7076000	That's the best.
7076000	7082000	I honestly can't think of any games that I've never been able to play that I legit haven't played.
7082000	7088000	I just miss old arcades. That's what I want more than anything. I want an old school arcade again.
7088000	7095000	I guess my answer would be, I would really like to play F-Zero AX again in one of the sit-down cabinets.
7095000	7098000	That shit was pretty amazing, and I missed that an awful lot.
7098000	7102000	And we're not talking just the regular sit-down cabinets, we're talking the ones that rotate.
7102000	7107000	The ones that will almost flip you upside down, just shy of that. I missed that. That was epic.
7107000	7111000	So I would say maybe, yeah, I guess that's my answer. F-Zero AX. I'd like to play that again.
7111000	7118000	There was a pinball table that I hadn't played in a long time that I actually got to see at California Extreme the last two years.
7118000	7123000	A pinball table called Genie, which actually my dad had when I was young.
7123000	7125000	I think I know that one.
7125000	7131000	And sadly this year, one of the flippers or something was weak or broken. It worked, but not very well.
7131000	7138000	It was working a lot better last year. It was kind of a blast from the past because he sold it 20 years ago.
7140000	7145000	Let's see, Koopa Kid Jeremy is in our chat room saying about old arcades, I'm assuming.
7145000	7152000	I miss the smell. Not really. This was probably before. When I was a kid, California hadn't banned smoking pretty much everywhere yet.
7152000	7156000	So I seem to remember Sam's Town up Highway 50. Remember that place? It was so awesome.
7156000	7163000	I remember that place smelling like cheap pizza and cigarettes. That's what old arcades smelled like.
7163000	7169000	And Chuck E. Cheese. Well, Chuck E. Cheese didn't smell like cigarettes. They did ban smoking in there, I think, because kids.
7169000	7175000	But cheap pizza for sure at Chuck E. Cheese. Anyhow, let's see.
7175000	7179000	Code Man says, tell me about it. I don't even want to know what an arcade is anymore.
7179000	7185000	Well, God, I think there's somebody legit said in their answer, you know, I think I was kind of born after arcades were really a thing.
7185000	7191000	And that just made me like I had a sad for a minute. You know what? I'm going to offer up a description.
7191000	7199000	This was the Aladdin's castle in Mobile, Alabama. The day I went after my little brother had gotten hit by a car.
7199000	7204000	Oh, my. He was six. He's 30 now. No. Twenty seven right now.
7204000	7212000	So that, you know, dates it. The walls were half carpeted the same way they had been since the 70s.
7212000	7217000	This is yeah, this has to be like 1992, something like that. Ninety one.
7217000	7224000	The walls had brown carpet up to the side like a roller rink does. Old wallpaper.
7224000	7233000	Posters of games from the 80s. And the first thing that you saw when you walked in was a samurai showdown to on the 44 inch screen.
7233000	7239000	Big ass thing to the left would have been a hockey. I remember perfectly to the left would have been in your hockey table.
7239000	7244000	As you go back, you see narc. You see a four player Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
7244000	7249000	You see a street fighter to a hyper fighting edition.
7249000	7256000	You see, you know, in the far, far back or your pinballs, your Galaga, your Q.
7256000	7261000	Bert, we had a Q. Bert kicks. So you go in.
7261000	7268000	And the first thing that you hear is, first of all, you sort of smell the same type of smell that comes from Confunk.
7268000	7274000	You know, sweaty boys playing games, but you hear loud noises and you see bright neon.
7274000	7279000	And when you leave, if you don't have a headache and your ears aren't ringing a little bit, you haven't been there long enough.
7279000	7286000	You're doing it wrong. Yeah. Koopa Kid Jeremy, our buddy from the Koopa Club podcast in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,
7286000	7291000	Chuck E. Cheese smells like pee. I don't remember. They do now. That's for sure.
7291000	7295000	I don't remember from when I was a kid, but maybe, you know, everything I remember.
7295000	7299000	I have this really early memory. You know, I don't remember a lot from when I was like before.
7299000	7303000	Like, you know, you don't remember a lot from before you're like five years old. I don't know about you guys.
7303000	7308000	But one thing I do remember is being, I think I was three years old at my sister's wedding,
7308000	7312000	because my sister would have been 19 or 20 at the time because there's a big age difference between us.
7312000	7317000	And we went to Chuck E. Cheese after one of the rehearsals, I think it was. Not after the wedding.
7317000	7321000	She didn't have the reception there. We went after Chuck E. Cheese after one of the rehearsals.
7321000	7327000	And I remember there was a room. Well, I remember two things. I remember playing Crystal Castles.
7327000	7332000	And in order to play the game, I had to stand up on one of those little, like, box things that they had for kids.
7332000	7337000	So I could sit up there and peer over the edge and move that little trackball around so I could move the little bear.
7337000	7342000	And I remember a room at Chuck E. Cheese that was nothing but a strobe light.
7342000	7346000	And you would, you would dance in front of the strobe light or whatever.
7346000	7350000	And like, it's like 80s technology, like strobe lights, like this new technology.
7350000	7352000	Now you can have a strobe light on your fucking phone.
7352000	7354000	Did yours have the Dayglo room?
7354000	7360000	It was black, black lights with drawings on the wall that would glow under the black light.
7360000	7366000	And at my Chuck E. Cheese, and this is like the old, old ass one that, like, I think burned down.
7366000	7371000	Yeah. But there were the hands and feet on the wall right above the door.
7371000	7376000	And you go through the door and you're in this little room that's Dayglo and then on the other side is the bathroom.
7376000	7377000	Wow.
7377000	7381000	But we had that too. We had the strobe room too. And then we had the room with the hippo lady.
7381000	7383000	Yes. I remember the hippo lady.
7383000	7384000	The party room with hippo lady.
7384000	7385000	All those.
7385000	7386000	Henrietta Hippo.
7386000	7389000	They still have all the animatronics. They just, they get scarier as you get older.
7389000	7390000	But anyway.
7390000	7393000	Yeah. We had the showbiz pizza at my place.
7393000	7396000	Yeah. One of them bought the other. Chuck E. Cheese bought showbiz at one point, right?
7396000	7397000	Yeah.
7397000	7398000	Yeah.
7398000	7399000	Pizza Time Theater.
7399000	7401000	Were you from this area? Were you from the Bay Area?
7401000	7402000	No. I'm from South Carolina.
7402000	7403000	Oh, that's right. Okay.
7403000	7404000	You know who owned Pizza Time Theater, right?
7404000	7405000	Oh, at Nolan Bushnell.
7405000	7406000	Yeah.
7406000	7407000	Yeah.
7407000	7410000	And then there was Bullwinkles. They had the water show.
7410000	7411000	Water sports?
7411000	7416000	They had a water show. They had a fountain, like, interactive. Like, it would just do this fountain show thing.
7416000	7419000	Like, a mid-tier version of what you would see, like, at the Bellagio or something like that.
7419000	7423000	Was that, like, the climax of the Great Muppet Caper? Did Miss Piggy come out on the fountain?
7423000	7424000	Sort of, I guess.
7424000	7427000	So it's Bullwinkles, you know? All the Bullwinkles characters.
7427000	7431000	Yeah. I remember the time when I always wanted to go to the mall because that's when they had the arcades there.
7431000	7434000	They had Aladdin's Castle and both of the malls that we had at the time.
7434000	7435000	Mm-hmm.
7435000	7436000	I was going there all the time.
7436000	7438000	No, no. I don't really want to go to malls at all.
7438000	7445000	God. When I was a kid, I was so obnoxious because whenever my parents were going on vacation, like, we literally, I was like, I was 10 or something.
7445000	7450000	We went to Hawaii. We went to Maui. We went to Hawaii. And I'm like, I want to go to an arcade.
7450000	7453000	I want to go to an arcade. I want to go to an arcade. Arcade.
7453000	7458000	So we went to some mall and, you know, because my mom liked to shop anyway.
7458000	7460000	So we went to the mall and they had an arcade and I got my way.
7460000	7463000	I fucking miss malls having arcades.
7463000	7464000	Yeah, I know.
7464000	7465000	True. Seriously.
7465000	7471000	Well, I miss, and actually, I'd have to say that even though I hated doing parties and stuff,
7471000	7475000	that was probably the most fun job I've had was working at the arcade.
7475000	7481000	Because, like, I could just hang around all day, you know, yeah, I had to, you know, do that, what, dust mop thing that you,
7481000	7488000	the mop with the motor, the vacuum motor thing that you just push around and go instead of actually a vacuum.
7488000	7492000	And, you know, and walk around and just get to chat games with people.
7492000	7500000	I worked at Aladdin's Castle when we had, when Tekken 3 just came out and we had just been purchased by Namco as well.
7500000	7502000	So we had shirts with Pac-Man on it. It was really cool.
7502000	7507000	And whatever the cyber station that was all Pac-Man branded themed and everything, that was really cool.
7507000	7513000	But working at the Aladdin's Castle was just a touch like working in an old 80s style arcade.
7513000	7515000	And I had a good time there.
7515000	7520000	I mean, I would come home with a migraine every night, but other than that, I had a great time working there.
7523000	7527000	Yeah, good memories about arcades. Good times.
7528000	7533000	And also that was figuring out the right place to knee the Street Fighter Alpha 2 where I could play for free.
7534000	7537000	You know, as far, was that like your first minimum wage job type of thing? Because like my first...
7537000	7538000	No.
7538000	7539000	No?
7539000	7545000	My first minimum wage job was working for a grocery store, which I probably quit a week later because they scheduled me during my classes.
7545000	7546000	Dope.
7546000	7549000	I don't actually count that as a for reals job because it was hell.
7549000	7551000	My first minimum wage job was not that bad.
7551000	7555000	But my second one was working in the game room at school.
7555000	7556000	Oh, okay.
7556000	7560000	And then after that, it was working at a cookie store where I lived on cookies for a year.
7560000	7562000	And then it was the arcade.
7562000	7568000	I worked at a place called, they don't exist anymore, it was Placer TV Video, which was a video rental store they used to rent.
7568000	7569000	I know of them.
7569000	7573000	Yeah, well, they were still around like in the mid 90s, like when everything was starting to shift to DVD.
7573000	7580000	And at that time, they were still renting NES games and like videotapes, but they didn't really get on the DVD bandwagon fast enough.
7580000	7582000	And that's kind of what killed them.
7582000	7591000	But we rented porn, like, because like that's and that's seriously why people would come to Placer TV because there was, you know, Hollywood Video didn't rent that stuff.
7591000	7594000	Blockbuster didn't rent that stuff. We had porn.
7594000	7599000	So that was kind of fun. Like my first minimum wage job, I get to like check out porn to people.
7599000	7601000	Did you have the red door?
7601000	7603000	No, it was just on the top shelf.
7603000	7613000	There was there was no laws prohibiting that stuff. People weren't so freaking like trying to be politically correct and protect everybody back then.
7613000	7615000	It was just kids can't reach that high.
7615000	7619000	My granny taking me to rent videos when I was in Dothan for a summer.
7619000	7621000	And by the way, the arcade we had in Dothan was Tilt.
7621000	7623000	Yeah, I remember Tilt.
7623000	7627000	But she just said, OK, pick whatever movie, make sure it's a good movie.
7627000	7632000	You know, I'd read Star Wars like fifty seven thousand times and actually return to the Jedi because that was my favorite movie.
7632000	7640000	And then I once rented this movie that I think the name was in another language, but it was pretty much Tiger Shark.
7640000	7644000	And it was one of those Jaws like movies, except with naked people.
7644000	7646000	And I watched it. I watched the whole movie.
7647000	7653000	And I'm like, my sister's my sister's with me and she's like, this movie's dirty.
7653000	7658000	I'm like, there's so much blood, blood orgy.
7658000	7663000	I loved being taken to go rent movies with people who hadn't who wouldn't read labels.
7663000	7668000	All right. Memory lane, memory lane. And we're not even back into gaming news. Sorry.
7668000	7671000	Let's get back into some gaming news, Loki.
7671000	7678000	All right. So there is a little bit of a controversy with the new Deus Ex game, The Fall, that came out on iOS platforms.
7678000	7683000	Apparently the game had a lockout for jailbroken devices.
7683000	7689000	Now, I guess the general thought is, well, your device is jailbroken, you're probably stealing the game.
7689000	7696000	That's not always true. People jailbreak devices to, you know, put their phone on a different carrier or something like that.
7696000	7705000	So there's that. So people that were legitimately buying the game allegedly were unable to fire the gun in the game.
7705000	7707000	Couldn't fire it. Nothing.
7707000	7713000	That's kind of a I mean, it's like one of the you hear about the clever anti piracy things like, you know, in what?
7713000	7718000	Batman, Arkham Asylum, like you couldn't jump far enough to get past certain parts of the game.
7718000	7722000	You know, I and I can applaud for a clever anti piracy thing.
7722000	7724000	But jailbreaking your device isn't piracy.
7724000	7726000	It's legal, actually.
7726000	7728000	I thought I thought then they come down and say that was illegal.
7728000	7730000	And I think it's gone back and forth a few times.
7730000	7736000	It's a mess. But I mean, people jailbreak exactly like you said, just because you jailbreak your device doesn't make you a pirate.
7736000	7746000	Yeah. And on top of that, though, you know, there is an app that you can get from the, you know, the homebrew store or whatever.
7747000	7751000	That basically you can patch it so that you can play the game.
7751000	7755000	It basically makes your device look like it's not jailbroken, even though it is.
7755000	7762000	Well, what they should have done is they should have put this out there on the piracy sites like the hours before they put it out on the official app store.
7762000	7771000	That's how you get the pirates is you got to put like the version of the game up on the piracy sites and then kind of like flood the the market, so to speak.
7771000	7776000	I mean, it'll get ratted out as a fake soon enough. But by that point, it's already kind of saturated.
7776000	7781000	Well, if you know, apparently, you know, people didn't like that. That was the case.
7781000	7786000	So they're going to patch it out later on. It says we we have not been clear in our communication because they didn't mention anything either.
7786000	7790000	That says that this work. They were trying to be discreet about being dicks.
7790000	7795000	But, you know, they made a huge mistake in that jailbreaking. Your phone doesn't make you a pirate.
7795000	7802000	Thanks, Square Enix. So we have not been clear in our communication earlier this week when we launched Deus Ex the fall.
7802000	7807000	We did not clearly say that the game world would not support or the game would not support jailbroken devices.
7807000	7814000	And we'll be switching this off via an update so that all support IS devices will be able to play the game in the near future.
7814000	7819000	So although at that point, nobody will want to anymore. Well, maybe the people that bought it.
7819000	7830000	All right. There was quite a bit of controversy this week and finally came to a head this weekend with the Evo tournament that's going on right now.
7830000	7834000	And where was this? Las Vegas, I think. And it's being streamed all around the Internet.
7834000	7838000	I think some people are watching it while they're listening to the show. It's finishing up right now, I believe.
7838000	7846000	And, of course, big controversy this week. Super Smash Brothers Melee was pulled from the live streaming schedule at one point.
7846000	7851000	Super Smash Brothers Melee was pulled from the weekend event in an update on shoryuken.com.
7851000	7861000	Evo co-founder Inkblot said, regrettably, we've just been informed by Nintendo of America that we do not have permission to broadcast Super Smash Brothers Melee for Evo 2013.
7861000	7869000	Well, now, this whole thing was a bit of a mess because in order to get the game featured in Evo in the first place, they had to do a charity fundraiser to raise the money.
7869000	7878000	Not for the tournament, but I think to get, like, the whole thing was, like, which fan communities can raise the most money for a good cause will feature those games in Evo.
7878000	7884000	That's the sense I get from this whole thing. And sure enough, the fans of Smash Brothers Melee raised $90,000.
7884000	7889000	Well, in comes big bad Nintendo to pull the plug on this, you know, to not have this happen.
7889000	7906000	But, thanks to the immense vocalness of the internet and trending topics on Twitter, Reddit, certainly a bit of a PR nightmare, and within hours Melee returned to be broadcast over the Evo 2013 tournament.
7906000	7921000	What's interesting, though, is that it did came out after that. So, it got reinstated. It was pulled, it was reinstated, but then it came out after that that co-founder Joey Quellar, I'm sorry if I'm saying that wrong, said about the Evo.
7921000	7930000	He's a co-founder of the Evo thing and an organizer. He said they were not only trying to shut down the stream, they were trying to shut down the event, the Smash portion of the event.
7930000	7935000	It's their IP. They can do what they want. They didn't present us with any options to keep it open.
7935000	7943000	But, of course, that obviously didn't happen. They ended up streaming it after all. This does seem like a real bad case of communication.
7943000	7949000	And kind of the PR department saying one thing and the legal department coming through and saying another.
7949000	7957000	Nintendo is incredibly protective of their IPs and so forth. It sounds like it wasn't really understood what was going on.
7957000	7966000	We already know there's some weird cloudiness with Nintendo's, you know, because of everything that happened with the Let's Play stuff not that long ago or anything like that either.
7966000	7972000	You know what? I couldn't be helped but reminded of this. And you guys are gonna think I'm crazy, but deal with it. You already do.
7972000	7975000	By the way, Evo, not E-V-O. It's evolution.
7975000	7989000	Oh, sorry. I thought I said E-V-O. Anyway, I thought of this. I was reminded of a couple years ago. Do you remember when Weird Al did that parody of Lady Gaga's Born This Way that was performed this way?
7989000	7999000	And he said that he couldn't put it out. He was gonna do it as like a single or whatever. He couldn't put it out because Lady Gaga said no.
7999000	8006000	Lady Gaga, he always gets permission from the artist, or at least always tries. But if the artist says no, he won't put it out and Lady Gaga said no.
8006000	8011000	And all these people started tweeting Lady Gaga like, you know, bitch, it's Weird Al. Let him do the song.
8011000	8019000	Well, turns out Lady Gaga comes out and says, I never heard the song. One of my people, like one of her legal people said no to it.
8019000	8026000	Even though that legal person in the response said Lady Gaga said no. But she had never heard it.
8026000	8036000	And it wasn't until the whole thing blew up on the internet. I couldn't help but be reminded of that because unfortunately, yes, I'm comparing Nintendo to Lady Gaga. Hear me out here.
8036000	8045000	But it's this whole big mess of he said, she said, right hand isn't talking to left hand. And this is the stuff that happens. And it did make Nintendo look stupid.
8045000	8055000	Like, you know, this is all for, well, it was done by charity for a good cause to bring positivity to an old Nintendo franchise.
8055000	8062000	It's a game tournament. Who gives a crap? I don't understand why they would have such an objection to it. The only thing I can think of is because it's being broadcast.
8063000	8073000	But I don't know. It's like, come on, you guys are trying this point. I think you want to salvage any sort of good faith you have with the community.
8073000	8079000	Since you kind of need them right now to buy your damn system, especially when the new Smash Brothers game comes out.
8079000	8086000	Maybe, I don't know, people see Smash Brothers that haven't really played the game while watching the EVO tournaments.
8086000	8093000	And they're like, hey, you know, that looks kind of fun. Maybe I should buy the new Wii U and buy the new Smash Brothers game when it comes out.
8093000	8099000	Or you could say, fuck you, you ain't going to watch it. You're not going to get to watch this because we're just going to be dicks about it.
8099000	8107000	And then, you know, now you're just pissed off a community and you're like, we're not buying your system or your game, so forget it.
8107000	8109000	But then they'll buy the game because, you know, they have to have it.
8110000	8117000	Tigerclaw said that he heard that Super Smash Brothers Melee had over 130,000 people watching the livestream during the game's finals earlier today.
8117000	8121000	It was the most watched fighting game in history, according to the co-founder of EVO.
8121000	8128000	Interesting, because the whole thing did kind of work out in the game. I mean, I think more people watched it because of this controversy.
8128000	8133000	I think a lot of people wouldn't have had an idea this was happening. I'm going to be honest. That's what happened.
8133000	8140000	And then, of course, we have our Smarties in chat saying Act F says, play this way. Rama says, stream this way.
8140000	8147000	Ooh, baby, there is no way. We will let you stream that game. You cannot stream that game, no.
8147000	8149000	No.
8149000	8151000	I tried.
8151000	8161000	All right. Anyway, well, glad they worked it out, but legal department and big companies need to figure, you know, realize that this is the world we live in.
8162000	8168000	It's yet another example of Nintendo does not understand the internet. This does not help their case.
8168000	8170000	What is it, a series of tubes?
8170000	8172000	Yes, right? Dark Sakura.
8172000	8176000	It's these wires and there's things on them and they do stuff.
8176000	8185000	How about a new IP, a new franchise coming from Nintendo. This was actually voiced by Miyamoto.
8185000	8195000	And God, I hate how this looks on my iPad. Basically, he let it slip that there is going to be a new franchise and he said this on the Japanese publication.
8195000	8209000	He didn't release any details, but he said that they were trying to get away from relying on their longstanding franchises, wanting to innovate and go a bit further with what was out there.
8209000	8212000	Thank you.
8213000	8216000	So maybe they finally understand how innovation works.
8216000	8222000	I'm glad that they're coming up with new IP, like the new IP that they launched the Wii system with.
8222000	8228000	Excite Truck needs a sequel, a good sequel. And I'm not talking about Excite Bots because that was crap.
8228000	8231000	You don't put mini games in the middle of a fucking race.
8231000	8232000	Yeah.
8232000	8237000	I shouldn't have to throw a pie at a clown while I'm racing a car.
8237000	8240000	I do that all the time. It's called going to Disneyland with Dan.
8240000	8248000	Or make a sandwich. Literally, there was make a sandwich during Burger Time Racers.
8248000	8257000	Don't get me wrong. It's a funny idea. I mean, in playing the game, you're just like, what the fuck? You know, this is silly, but it's just...
8257000	8266000	We need Wario's Wacky Races. Wouldn't that be crazy? Instead of a Mario Kart, do like a Wario Kart and have it be like just completely fucked up.
8266000	8273000	Well, this new Mario Kart 8, you're going upside down. Mario Kart 8 basically looks like F-Zero, which, like, it makes me happy.
8273000	8274000	Why can't we just have F-Zero?
8274000	8282000	It makes me really happy and really fucking irritated at the same time. Like, Nintendo, you're just like, you're fucking teasing me now. Stop it.
8282000	8284000	Nintendo, wrong.
8284000	8287000	I'm all for new IPs, though. You know, new IPs are fucking...
8287000	8290000	Build this wonderful engine for F-Zero and then we're like, eh, no one wants F-Zero.
8290000	8294000	Nobody wants F-Zero. Nobody wants that.
8294000	8296000	Alright, moving on. Loki.
8296000	8308000	Alright. So, Desura has actually been purchased up by, what was it, the Second Life company, Linden Labs.
8308000	8316000	And so, what's that mean? I have no fucking clue. Other than, you know, it's changed ownership.
8316000	8322000	I don't think it's really going to change anything as far as, you know, the distribution service goes.
8323000	8325000	So, yeah, it's interesting.
8325000	8330000	Maybe Second Life will become like PlayStation Home and you can launch games within Second Life.
8330000	8335000	Except with a lot more furry... No, actually, it is exactly like PlayStation Home.
8335000	8340000	It would be exactly like PlayStation Home. It would be very meta because, like, PlayStation Home was kind of inspired by Second Life.
8340000	8343000	But there are flying dicks in Second Life and not in PlayStation Home.
8343000	8346000	Well, there are dicks in PlayStation Home.
8346000	8348000	They're not flying, though.
8348000	8350000	Do they have rocket packs?
8352000	8361000	Alright. You can file this in, you know, I don't know if this is Rule 37 or what, but this is just the gaming community at work here.
8361000	8374000	There is a petition going around telling Microsoft, or I should say asking, demanding that Microsoft bring back the restrictive DRM policies that they had already rescinded due to outrage.
8374000	8377000	Yes, there are fans petitioning Microsoft to bring it back.
8377000	8381000	It's actually a petition posted on change.org.
8381000	8383000	I hate that site.
8383000	8384000	Why do you hate change.org?
8384000	8391000	Because you sign any petition on there and you get 50,000 spam emails from them.
8391000	8395000	And, yeah, I'm all good for signing petitions, but not on that site.
8395000	8397000	I will not sign a single one on that site.
8397000	8399000	Okay, so here's the petition.
8400000	8408000	This was to be the future of entertainment, a new wave of gaming where you could buy games digitally, then trade, share, or sell those digital licenses.
8408000	8419000	Essentially, it was Steam for Xbox, but consumers were uninformed and railed against it, rallied against it, I think they meant to say, and it was taken away because Sony took advantage of consumers' uncertainty.
8419000	8423000	We want this back. It can't be all or nothing. There must be a compromise.
8423000	8428000	Two, whoever, give us back the Xbox One we were promised at E3.
8428000	8434000	Sincerely, your name. They have hit 24,476 signatures.
8434000	8439000	Yeah, and a lot of those are just troll signatures, too, by the way, because they're like, yeah, we want them to do this.
8439000	8446000	But I'm sorry, once again, comparing the digital marketplace that Xbox One would have to Steam is just stupid.
8446000	8452000	And there's a perfect example of the difference right now with the Steam sale.
8452000	8461000	First off, you see a lot of discounts on Steam, and Steam is not the only place that you can get Steam games.
8461000	8476000	You can get Steam games or Steam DRM-enabled games on Amazon, on Green Man Gaming, a bunch of different websites out there have these games at different prices all the time, so there's competing marketplaces.
8476000	8480000	There are not competing marketplaces when Microsoft owns the marketplace.
8480000	8485000	That is the only marketplace. The price that they have it on there is the price that you're going to pay for it.
8485000	8492000	And on top of that, I think the whole reason was the whole game sharing thing, and we still don't know what the fucking details were on that.
8492000	8495000	This is what pisses me off about this, too. You don't know what the fuck you're complaining about.
8495000	8503000	You literally, and I say to all 24,000 of you, you literally do not know what the fuck you're complaining about.
8503000	8509000	They never said what the rules were.
8509000	8518000	I know this is a show where every gamer has a voice, and I welcome every opinion, but I can literally say this petition is ignorant.
8518000	8526000	Speaking of ignorant, and change.org, I have been informed that they no longer send out the emails.
8526000	8532000	Oh, okay, well that's good. Wow, you just fessed up to your own ignorance here on the show. It happens.
8532000	8540000	Well, it's because I ignored them for a while. I didn't care. Ignore ignorant. You know, same word. Same combination.
8540000	8544000	Humble Bundle, there's another perfect example of places you can get Steam games for dirt cheap.
8544000	8554000	I'm just saying that's the problem. Even comparing the PlayStation Network store or Xbox Live marketplace to Steam is just ridiculous,
8554000	8559000	because it's not an open platform as far as you're not going to have competing marketplaces out there.
8559000	8564000	It's not like the retail marketplace where everyone's competing with each other. You have one central marketplace.
8564000	8568000	You buy it their way, or you don't buy it at all. Origin.
8568000	8575000	Shadownextgen in our chat says, Skye, couldn't it be said that people originally didn't really know what they were complaining about?
8575000	8580000	By the way, no I haven't signed the petition, nor do I plan to. I appreciate the devil's advocate perspective.
8580000	8585000	I know you're an Xbox fan, and unlike some of these people, I do think you do know what you're talking about.
8585000	8590000	So let me humor this opinion here about, didn't we not originally know what we were complaining about?
8590000	8596000	No, we did. Xbox made it very clear about the restrictions that they were putting into place.
8596000	8598000	They have three pages in it.
8598000	8602000	Yeah, it was that whole official letter they put out there. It was very clear. There was no misinterpreting that.
8602000	8610000	You will have to check in once every 24 hours. You will only be able to trade and use games through authorized vendors and all this stuff.
8611000	8621000	That was in writing. And you can read between the lines and see that that meant that you would not be able to sell games yourself on eBay and so on and so on.
8621000	8626000	The problem is, what they didn't communicate was the positive to offset that negative.
8626000	8634000	Family sharing was this big cloud out there. Ten people in your house can play the games, but how? What are the terms?
8634000	8645000	Because there's literally people out there, and I bet you the people signing this petition think that it was share with people across the internet the full, unhinged, complete game.
8645000	8655000	Ten people playing it all at once. Now we can all pool in on our game sales. I don't think any of you think that listening to this, but I think there were people out there that really think that.
8655000	8661000	They thought that they could share games. Oh hey, I'm only going to have to pay $6 for this Xbox One game.
8661000	8666000	And nine of my other friends are going to chip in as well and we can all play this game. No, I'm sorry. That's not the way it works.
8666000	8670000	When in reality, it was probably like the GIMP to Drive Club thing, honestly.
8670000	8677000	And seriously, do you really think that Microsoft would legitimately put out a service like that? That they would stand to lose money on?
8678000	8683000	And they got beat by Sony. Sony took advantage of this. Yes, they did take advantage of this situation.
8683000	8684000	That's what business is.
8684000	8693000	That is business. And it's, to be fair, it's the exact flip of seven years ago when PlayStation embarrassed themselves at E3.
8693000	8699000	Anyhow, I wanted to read this comment to, where was it? Oh yes, this is very important.
8699000	8707000	From Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com. Official quote from anti-consumer Blackwolf, with his quotey fingers.
8707000	8714000	Fuck those fans. Thank you Bobby. We'll end on that note.
8714000	8721000	Alright, moving on to the Mailbag. It is the show where every gamer has a voice.
8721000	8725000	And if you were one of those people that signed that petition, I invite you to come at me bro.
8725000	8734000	Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com. In all seriousness, I could be respectful if you want to have a respectful discussion.
8734000	8738000	But you have to admit that the petition is a little silly at this point. Just let it be.
8738000	8741000	It's an online petition. I mean, come on.
8741000	8747000	You know what? Before the Mailbag, this is important. I would fully support. Fully support.
8747000	8753000	And I think this is what those people would want. So before you write your angry email, I'm gonna meet you halfway here.
8753000	8760000	I would be totally okay with this. With a physical disc license and a digital download license.
8760000	8766000	And if you want to buy your game on physical disc, then game sharing and all that stuff works the way you know it today.
8766000	8771000	And everything is just like, you know, like that shady PlayStation video and all that. Everything you know and love about games.
8771000	8778000	But a digital download license would give you something different. I think that's kind of the place gaming ought to go.
8778000	8782000	Is that if you download a game, you have the freedom to choose. You get these perks.
8782000	8788000	Your perk for buying the game digitally is you get it day one without having to leave your...
8788000	8791000	You could buy the game without pants. You won't have to leave your house.
8791000	8796000	And you can give that game to a friend in New York or something cross-country.
8796000	8800000	You know, it would have these different licenses. I am totally okay with that.
8800000	8805000	And I would be behind Xbox One 100% with that. I just don't think it's gonna happen.
8806000	8811000	And they can always come back. They said that later on they may implement some of the stuff that they got rid of.
8811000	8814000	Hopefully not all the bad things, but you know.
8814000	8818000	They could just be there trying to find a way to integrate something that won't scare people off.
8818000	8822000	But I can't support a petition that is like, switch it back to the way it was because everyone's stupid.
8822000	8828000	We don't like it. We want it this way. But Daddy, I want the kiss that lays the golden eggs.
8828000	8831000	Alright, let's see what our emailers want this week.
8832000	8838000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. Dark Soccer's gonna dive in head first and find the email she's gonna read now.
8841000	8842000	Dear OLR.
8842000	8844000	Looks like this is a bad nut.
8846000	8851000	Dear OLR, I just wanted to say, as always, that you have an awesome show.
8851000	8858000	I wanted to share with you a game I recently acquired on Steam. It's called Akaneiro Demon Hunters.
8858000	8862000	It plays a lot like Okami in the sense that you get shards for each demon you killed.
8862000	8865000	This is a storyline... learn to spell.
8865000	8867000	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
8867000	8870000	Straight. Not with an E, with an A. From Steam.
8870000	8875000	I'm not very good at descriptions, so I took this one from the official game site.
8875000	8884000	Akaneiro Demon Hunters transports you to a world realized in a striking visual style inspired by Japanese ink, water, and woodblock illustration.
8885000	8890000	We've dug deep into the history and folklore of Japan when designing our scenarios and characters.
8890000	8900000	Mixing this foundation with an original mythology inspired by Red Riding Hood has yielded a fantastic and inspiring setting for players to explore.
8900000	8906000	It was produced, I think, by Spicy Horse who was in charge of American movies Alice Madness Returns, which is another awesome game by the way.
8906000	8909000	Hope you guys can check it out. It's on Steam for $10 now.
8909000	8914000	The graphics are stunning and remind me a lot of Okami as it looks like drawings on the screen.
8914000	8920000	Hope you guys get to check it out sometime and as always happy gaming and thanks for letting every gamer have a voice. Sincerely, GG.
8920000	8922000	You're welcome.
8922000	8925000	Thank you. I might have to give it a try if I have money.
8925000	8930000	I like hearing about game reviews about games I haven't really heard a lot of, so thank you.
8931000	8935000	This comes from Rob-a-b-b-b-b.
8935000	8941000	Like Rob, I got caught up in the Steam Trading Cards thingy. It seems to be never ending.
8941000	8953000	Just for fun, I bought my missing Binding of Isaac cards. Then I converted them to a badge. Not only did that eat all the cards, I got a booster pack soon after with more Binding of Isaac cards.
8953000	8956000	One of the cards was a foil and so now I have a foil badge to collect.
8956000	8963000	The regular trading cards can power up my existing badge, so there's no reason for selling or trading cards unless they're duplicates.
8963000	8970000	I was using $5 of my own money plus selling my duplicates to obtain a full set. I still have almost $3 left over, pro tip.
8970000	8977000	Don't try buying the cards at the top of the queue on the marketplace. It will most likely be gone before you can complete your transaction.
8977000	8992000	I don't think the trading card system was running 2-5 July because I paid for hours and got no drops.
8992000	9001000	Lastly, the cards are worth zooming in on. The Fairy Solitaire cards are actually panoramas from the game. The artwork will probably look way better zoomed in.
9002000	9009000	That is very true. If you are getting those cards, take a minute to actually look at them because there is some really good artwork. Especially if it's a game you really do appreciate.
9009000	9014000	I know we probably don't have a lot of hardcore Fairy Solitaire fans out there. Well, except Dark Sakura.
9014000	9018000	I'm not really hardcore. I just play it when I get incredibly bored.
9018000	9025000	It is a good game, to be fair. What's the difference between Fairy Solitaire and old school Windows 3.1 Solitaire?
9025000	9029000	Well, because it's not exactly Solitaire. It's arranged out a little bit differently.
9029000	9038000	Yeah, it's a little special. But, anyhow. Yeah, the trading card thing is fun. And, thank you RaBaba for doing trading cards with me last week.
9038000	9044000	Bronnman sent an email that just said 573. So, maybe we hit our lives.
9044000	9049000	Did we hit it? Oh, maybe we did. Thank you, Rama. I'm looking now.
9049000	9055000	We have another email that I'm just going to go ahead and read it, but I'm not going to say the guy's full name.
9056000	9062000	So, my name is Jeff Gee, and I've worked at an ESPN affiliate radio station for three years.
9062000	9068000	I've played video games since I can remember. I'm interested in video games radio and would love to send in my resume and some clips of me on air.
9068000	9071000	Sorry, we're not hiring because we don't pay anything.
9071000	9074000	I didn't see this email, really.
9074000	9079000	If nothing comes of this email, I would still like to commend you for living the dream of talking about video games.
9079000	9082000	Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing back from you.
9082000	9084000	Well, bless your heart, sir.
9084000	9087000	If we could afford to pay, we would be paid.
9087000	9093000	Yeah, unfortunately, this is an all-volunteer organization, but I will throw this out there.
9093000	9103000	VOG is looking for more shows. Now, we're looking for established shows because we want to make sure that the people we recruit aren't going to throw in the towel after you.
9103000	9109000	I mean, look to the site's credit at Voice of Gee's network. We've had the same lineup for like a year.
9109000	9112000	The shows haven't left, which is a great testament.
9112000	9117000	Inevitably, some shows are going to throw in the towel eventually. That's just the way things go.
9117000	9125000	But we want to make sure that the shows we get are established shows that will go for a year or two if we're going to invest the promo and so forth in the shows.
9125000	9132000	If you do have a show that's interested in being on the network, get in touch with me directly, robatvognetwork.com.
9132000	9134000	I will say this, unfortunately, to this guy.
9134000	9140000	We're not really looking for video game shows right now because we have a bunch between Girls Gone Wow, Horde House, us, Bobby.
9140000	9144000	We're looking for some more general geekdom shows to diversify the palette a little bit.
9144000	9148000	But I could tell you comic book shows are right at the top of the list.
9148000	9154000	I would love a board game, card game, non-video game type show.
9154000	9162000	I would love, love, love a show that is larping live or playing a game live, one of those types of shows.
9162000	9166000	I would make a great cereal. So just throwing that out there.
9166000	9173000	If you have an established show along those lines, get in touch with me, robatvognetwork.com, and we'll see what we can do.
9173000	9181000	Otherwise, I invite this guy to just join, call our show some night.
9181000	9184000	If you're around on a Sunday night, give our show a call.
9184000	9185000	Yeah.
9185000	9187000	Let's talk, we'll be happy to talk video games with you.
9187000	9188000	And who knows?
9188000	9189000	For free.
9189000	9195000	And who knows, you know, you might find your niche in the geekdom market too.
9195000	9199000	You know, we might, there's sports geeks out there.
9199000	9202000	You said you worked for ESPN affiliates, so who knows?
9202000	9206000	We got sports geek talk as long as there's no wrestling because that would drive Bobby crazy.
9209000	9212000	Unless it's like 80s wrestling, how could that drive anybody crazy?
9212000	9213000	80s wrestling was the best.
9213000	9217000	Your theme song has to be Hulk Hogan's, I am a real American.
9217000	9219000	Cause you know, anyway.
9219000	9222000	Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.
9222000	9226000	Every week here on the show, oh by the way, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com
9226000	9230000	If you would like to send in your mail, please, no resumes.
9230000	9233000	Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com
9233000	9235000	Here's the FUs of the week time.
9243000	9252000	FU to Bitchface.
9252000	9255000	She doesn't listen to the show.
9255000	9257000	Some people know who Bitchface is.
9257000	9259000	FU.
9259000	9261000	And also my hip.
9261000	9265000	And the stupid cough that I am now going on to week five.
9265000	9267000	Fuck.
9267000	9269000	Done.
9269000	9270000	Uh, Logie.
9270000	9272000	FU detention headaches.
9272000	9274000	I always get them.
9274000	9276000	And I have one now.
9276000	9280000	I'm going to follow that up with my own FU to headaches.
9280000	9284000	Cause I had a really bad one yesterday that pretty much ruined my day.
9284000	9287000	I will say that, but I guess shit happens.
9287000	9289000	Bradley, do you have any FUs you want to get off your chest?
9289000	9293000	FU to my back for hurting after California Extreme yesterday.
9293000	9296000	And then seriously fuck you to this uh,
9297000	9302000	Wingstomp employee said they wouldn't take my order cause it's getting late at 1030
9302000	9306000	when I ordered after 11, 11 like several times.
9306000	9309000	He said, we're really late.
9309000	9312000	And it basically went and just said fuck you to him right there.
9312000	9314000	Never saying that.
9314000	9317000	Cause I don't know if it was tone or just he set me off for some reason.
9317000	9319000	But that was kind of the stupid answer.
9319000	9322000	I don't know if there was something going on or they're closing earlier or something.
9322000	9324000	Don't you dare get between me and my wings.
9325000	9327000	It's like a crime.
9327000	9328000	Yeah.
9328000	9330000	All right.
9330000	9332000	Uh, there it is.
9332000	9334000	Uh, FUs of the week.
9334000	9338000	Let's move on with a couple more news stories and then you guys can give us a call in a moment here.
9338000	9340000	Uh, Loki.
9340000	9345000	You may remember a time when Sony's uh, online network was hacked.
9345000	9347000	Pepperidge Farm remembers.
9347000	9350000	And uh, Sony they uh,
9351000	9354000	they basically got fined in the UK.
9354000	9359000	Uh, they had to pay a 250,000 pound fine.
9359000	9362000	And they were originally appealing it.
9362000	9365000	Now they decided they're going to withdraw that.
9365000	9369000	So after careful consideration we are withdrawing our appeal.
9369000	9377000	This decision reflects our commitment to protecting the confidentiality of our network security from disclosures in the course of proceedings.
9378000	9383000	And we continue to disagree with the decision on the merits.
9385000	9389000	So they're gonna, they disagree but they're gonna pay for it.
9389000	9393000	We don't like this but we'll do it anyway.
9393000	9402000	I'm wondering if they did appeal it that they would go, maybe there would be some sort of trial where like information would come out about how shoddy their protection was.
9402000	9408000	And they didn't want that so they decided to go ahead and pay the original settlement or something. I don't know, whatever.
9408000	9411000	Cool. Water in the bridge.
9411000	9417000	Alright. Although the entire gaming community have probably already forgotten about the hack. Never forget.
9417000	9421000	I shouldn't say the entire community but a big chunk of them.
9421000	9425000	Rageinator said how about a show that combines wrestling, bronies, and furries.
9425000	9428000	And I said that sounds like really bad porn.
9428000	9430000	Would that be Dogpile?
9430000	9434000	It will air at 3am on Tuesday morning.
9436000	9438000	Yes, we can have the wrestling, bronies, furries show.
9438000	9444000	It will air at 4am on No Day. Ever. In the never.
9446000	9453000	All joking aside, you know, as much as I say we're kind of full up on video game shows right now, I would love to see a Mega Man show. I don't know.
9453000	9461000	But anyway, Mega Man is a die hard community and the community makes a lot of great fan projects.
9461000	9465000	And one of them is on its way out, Mega Man Revolution.
9465000	9471000	It's been in development since 2002. It tries to recreate the magic of the NES games.
9471000	9474000	You can also, I guess, enable slow down and so forth.
9474000	9477000	A lot of early reaction. This game is too hard.
9477000	9480000	But also that it's a solid fan game.
9480000	9484000	So you can check that out. MegaManRevolution.com slash download.
9484000	9487000	It is a free download since this is a fan project.
9487000	9489000	I haven't seen Capcom trying to shut it down.
9489000	9492000	I guess that's good news. But it's on the internet now so you'll never shut it down.
9492000	9495000	So go enjoy that.
9495000	9498000	I suppose nothing wrong with keeping up the awareness of Mega Man.
9498000	9502000	Especially with he will be in the next Smash Brothers of course.
9502000	9506000	Inevitably, Capcom will dust him off and bring him out in another game.
9506000	9509000	It's gotta happen, right? Someday. Someday.
9509000	9512000	By the way, I did get sent a picture here.
9512000	9516000	We did get our 573rd like on Facebook.
9516000	9519000	Thank you.
9519000	9522000	I appreciate it. That doesn't mean to stop liking us on Facebook.
9522000	9527000	Because the next goal would be, what would it be? Probably like 5730?
9527000	9531000	No, it would be 1337.
9531000	9534000	Oh, okay. That's an admirable goal.
9534000	9540000	And of course, Mega Man Revolution, I would mention that there is also Mega Man Unlimited which was released today.
9540000	9544000	And you can download that at MegaPhilX.com.
9544000	9549000	Is that Phil like a dude named Phil or Phil like F-I-L-L?
9549000	9552000	Phil like a dude named Phil.
9552000	9557000	Alrighty. I guess that is about it for the show.
9557000	9562000	But we do want to take an opportunity to open up our skype line for you guys to have your say on anything we've talked about tonight.
9562000	9568000	Or maybe something we missed. 1877 Game O-L-R or a username on skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9568000	9570000	All one word if you'd like to give us a call.
9570000	9573000	And we'll talk about whatever you'd like, within reason.
9573000	9578000	Let's get to some Twitter topics and last minute stories while we wait for those to come in.
9578000	9585000	Alright, so there's the Tekken Revolution. Remember the free to play Tekken game that's going to be coming out?
9585000	9593000	Well, they have a poll up right now for some new candidates, I guess, that are going to be added to the game.
9593000	9598000	Some of these were kind of B-roll characters that didn't even make it into certain games.
9598000	9606000	For example, there's one character that's a fish. A fish man. And all he can do is flop around.
9606000	9611000	Zombie bride, giant preen mantis, average run of the mill old man.
9612000	9614000	Yes, he's an old man who can't fight.
9614000	9615000	What about middle aged man?
9615000	9617000	And female Paul.
9617000	9620000	Let me get to the phones because the phones are ringing here.
9620000	9622000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9622000	9623000	It's Jason.
9623000	9624000	Hey, Jason. How you doing?
9624000	9625000	Hi, Jason.
9625000	9627000	Can we go back to Nostalgia Land?
9627000	9630000	Of course we can. I love Nostalgia Land.
9630000	9637000	I was driving back from a friend's concert and you guys were going to the mailbag and I was just driving along the highway just going,
9638000	9644000	Yeah, right. I know. I want to build a house out of pixels in Nostalgia Land and live there.
9644000	9647000	A fort. I will have my pixel fort in Nostalgia Land.
9647000	9650000	What do you want to talk about in Nostalgia Land? What makes you nostalgic?
9650000	9652000	Prop cycle.
9652000	9653000	They have one.
9653000	9655000	Yes. Prop cycle is awesome.
9655000	9659000	They have one. Not in the prop cycle, Addams Family, but they had a prop cycle.
9659000	9663000	Believe it or not, some of our listeners don't know what prop cycle is, so please explain it.
9663000	9676000	Prop cycle was an exercise game. Essentially you sat on an exercise bike that had a two-handed flight stick and you could tilt it forward, pull it back, obviously turn right and left.
9676000	9685000	You couldn't just crank the pedals continuously because the game, I think it was basically like exertion prevention built into the game,
9685000	9692000	but you just pedaled persistently and flew around popping balloons and not crashing into things.
9692000	9695000	There you go. And it was just a lot of fun to play. It was so silly looking too.
9695000	9703000	It was so fun. Rio Rancho, my hometown, doesn't actually have a mall still to this day.
9703000	9709000	The mall that got closest to us, Cottonwood Mall, is just on the other side of the city limit border.
9709000	9715000	But when that was first built up, the movie theater downstairs had a very tiny little arcade.
9715000	9721000	It had a metal slug, I want to say, a Neo Geo multi-cab, and a couple of other typical things.
9721000	9728000	But upstairs, for the first couple of years of that mall's existence, there was a divided laser tag.
9728000	9735000	Excuse me. A divided laser tag, meaning that you can't cross any of the other person's territory, and it had Sega City.
9735000	9743000	And that was like, with the exception of the roller rink that we used to go to when I was younger, way the hell out in Albuquerque,
9743000	9748000	Sega City was like my personal arcade back in the day, and that's where I played Prop Cycle.
9748000	9752000	And it was one of those things where whenever we would go, I would play that.
9752000	9758000	And it was such a great game, and I always had such a fun time, but as that place declined,
9758000	9766000	the screen CRT and the general death of that kind of thing just kind of slowly but surely started to whitewash
9766000	9772000	and fall off and burn in before the entire place just got taken out to pasture.
9772000	9779000	But it was a great game. I've literally never seen that in any other arcade to my mind, to my memory.
9779000	9783000	Don't they have these weird hacks for Prop Cycle, where they hook up Prop Cycle to other games?
9783000	9786000	Like, wouldn't there even be a pinball game that ran off Prop Cycle?
9786000	9795000	As a matter of fact, my friends out here in Colorado, before I moved out here, hooked up a Poppin' Music of some sort
9795000	9802000	to the Prop Cycle TV, and they dubbed it Propin' Music.
9802000	9803000	That's awesome.
9803000	9808000	I unfortunately wasn't up here for the occasion, but I saw pictures and it was definitely amazing.
9808000	9809000	Good times.
9809000	9813000	There's one game, so I've never known the name of this game.
9813000	9823000	My brain does really weird things when specific details of things go away, and I wonder if you guys know this arcade game.
9823000	9827000	I seem to remember it in the roller skating rink that I used to go to as a kid.
9827000	9838000	Basically, what it boils down to is you're a character that runs around a roller coaster collecting cherries,
9838000	9840000	and you have to dodge the roller coaster.
9840000	9843000	I've never been able to find the actual cars on the roller coaster.
9843000	9845000	I've never been able to find this game.
9845000	9847000	Is that Mr. Do's Wild Ride?
9847000	9850000	Mr. Do's Wild Ride.
9850000	9854000	Sounds like it. If you're collecting cherries, it's Mr. Do.
9854000	9859000	Come on, Wikipedia. Give me a screenshot and not just the box art.
9859000	9866000	This is the thing that I kind of run into is that the image is ridiculously small.
9866000	9873000	I seem to remember it being very, very circular with ladders that connect you to the different portions.
9873000	9875000	Yep, that's Mr. Do's Wild Ride.
9875000	9876000	I'm almost positive.
9876000	9877000	Go to Google.
9877000	9879000	Check it out on Google. Do a Google search.
9879000	9882000	Wow, okay, okay. Yeah, this starts a scene.
9882000	9891000	It's so weird because my brain, filling in the gaps now that I actually have game screenshots,
9891000	9899000	this kind of seems to make sense, but my brain remembers this game looking a little bit better, I guess.
9899000	9902000	A little bit newer than this actually is.
9902000	9905000	The resolution on old games is going to be itty bitty.
9905000	9906000	Oh, of course.
9906000	9908000	Yeah, so I think that's part of it.
9908000	9909000	It's all about raster.
9909000	9910000	Yeah.
9910000	9912000	The detail of this thing just seems...
9912000	9915000	What I remember and what this looks like is entirely different.
9915000	9919000	I want a classic arcade Smash Brothers game, like with Mr. Do in there.
9919000	9922000	That also might be the platform you're looking at.
9922000	9925000	I don't know if that screen is an actual arcade shot that you're looking at,
9925000	9929000	but there was also a Commodore 64 version, so you might be seeing a different version of it.
9929000	9931000	Oh, wow.
9931000	9933000	I'm looking at Rob's image search.
9933000	9937000	There's all these screen captures, and then there's a really badly drawn cock.
9937000	9939000	It says you mad on it.
9939000	9942000	What does that have to do with Mr. Do's wild ride? I don't know.
9942000	9943000	Thank you, Google Images.
9943000	9945000	Thank you, Google Images.
9945000	9948000	That's what I get for turning safe search off.
9948000	9950000	No one wants to search safe. Come on.
9950000	9955000	You can't have your search for a cock in a fair game.
9955000	9958000	Well, I'm glad we got to play Identify the Classic Arcade Game.
9959000	9963000	I've been meaning to ask somebody about this for literally years.
9963000	9968000	Dropping back into Nostalgia Land actually reminded me of it.
9968000	9971000	Maybe Jamie can help me with this one, because she's a big Namco girl.
9971000	9977000	They did a re-release of Pac-Man in some type of anniversary set that not only had Pac-Man,
9977000	9981000	but it had Dig Dug 2, and it might have had one other game.
9981000	9984000	I don't know if it was a tenth anniversary or a fifteenth anniversary.
9984000	9987000	There was some type of anniversary collection that had these games in it,
9987000	9990000	and they were like up-rezzed. Not like Pac-Mania or anything like that.
9990000	9994000	It was Pac-Man with some subtle differences, but it had Dig Dug in it too,
9994000	9996000	and I really want to play that again.
9996000	9998000	It was like a choose-your-game.
9998000	10001000	Yes, it was a choose-your-game, and you could play either Pac-Man or Dig Dug.
10001000	10005000	I want to say they have one at the Roseville Dave and Busters.
10005000	10006000	Really?
10006000	10009000	I want to say. I know I've seen one.
10009000	10013000	I just want to know where I can get the meme wrong. Let's be real.
10013000	10014000	Anywhere, probably.
10014000	10017000	Well, I want to know what it's called so I can get it.
10017000	10019000	I think it is one of the anniversary editions.
10019000	10022000	I don't remember the name, but I know I've seen one, and I know I've played one.
10022000	10026000	Okay, I'll have to do some Google-Fu on that because I was thinking of that game earlier.
10028000	10032000	Anyhow, it was a nice trip down nostalgia lane, Jason.
10032000	10036000	It was. It was a great 20 minutes. A good way to kill my drive.
10036000	10038000	No problem. That's what I appreciate about this show.
10038000	10041000	It's a great way to kill a long commuter drive.
10042000	10045000	I'm going to get to see you in a couple weeks, yes?
10045000	10049000	Perhaps. Not in Sacramento, I don't think.
10049000	10052000	I'm surprisingly busy considering how long I'm going to be out in the Bay Area,
10052000	10056000	but yes, I am definitely there for the upcoming con at the start of next month.
10056000	10061000	Yes, I know you'll be, even if you're not going to GamerX, you'll be in the area,
10061000	10065000	and I'll be able to meet up with you there, which gives me another opportunity to promote
10065000	10072000	the little panel dealy going on Saturday at GamerX in San Francisco, August 3rd?
10072000	10075000	I think it is the date. It's that Saturday.
10075000	10085000	And I am doing a panel with my buddies from Koopa Club and Game Bar and Game Buoy,
10085000	10088000	and I know I'm leaving somebody else out, so I apologize in advance,
10088000	10093000	but all us guys are getting together doing a podcast cross zone panel,
10093000	10098000	and we're just going to be talking about podcasting, our show is kind of how we got into it,
10098000	10102000	and trying to enable more people to get their voices heard, so it'll be fun.
10102000	10103000	Yes.
10103000	10104000	We'll have a gay old time.
10104000	10105000	It'll be a good time.
10105000	10106000	Yeah, gay meaning happy.
10106000	10107000	You left.
10107000	10108000	All right.
10108000	10109000	Oh, excuse me. Wow.
10109000	10111000	You need to take me to that place in Castro you were talking about earlier, too.
10111000	10113000	Which place? Hot Cookie?
10113000	10114000	Um, no.
10114000	10115000	Oh, Moby Dick.
10115000	10117000	The bar with the pinball bar.
10117000	10120000	So it's literally going to become that song that's,
10120000	10125000	you, I'm going to take you to a gay bar.
10125000	10127000	And I'm choking, so have a good night, guys.
10127000	10128000	All right. Bye, Jason.
10128000	10131000	Thank you for mentioning Hot Cookie, because now I want to go there.
10131000	10133000	All right. Let's go to another call on the line.
10133000	10136000	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?
10136000	10138000	Hi, this is Azurmay.
10138000	10140000	Azurmay. Hey, what's on your mind, buddy?
10141000	10144000	I was just talking to one of my friends about the show,
10144000	10149000	and he actually came up and brought up the whole looking for a new show,
10149000	10151000	and we kind of do a show.
10151000	10155000	But it's kind of based off of, like, Japanese culture
10155000	10159000	and, like, how Japanese culture affects American culture
10159000	10162000	with a little bit of, like, learning a little bits of Japanese.
10162000	10165000	We do things through Facebook and Adobe Connect.
10165000	10166000	Interesting.
10166000	10168000	But I was just throwing that, like, out there.
10168000	10170000	Maybe, like, the chat would be able to see, like,
10170000	10173000	if that's something they were interested in listening to.
10173000	10177000	Well, Pimp, your show, I'm all about support and indie shows.
10177000	10179000	Tell us where we can find it.
10179000	10182000	Okay, well, the name of the actual show is, like,
10182000	10184000	Learning Japanese Through Music.
10184000	10187000	And we kind of try to...
10187000	10191000	You can look on Facebook at facebook.com slash groups,
10191000	10194000	Japanese Through Anime,
10194000	10196000	and you can probably see the page there.
10196000	10197000	You can actually add.
10197000	10199000	We have, like, Thursday nights.
10199000	10202000	We have, like, a three-hour...
10202000	10206000	Like, it basically starts out with two hours of, like, a song,
10206000	10208000	and then after, like, the last hour is like a karaoke
10208000	10210000	where we get a chance to sing the song,
10210000	10214000	but we break down the song and kind of, like, practice Japanese.
10214000	10216000	Like, last week, the...
10216000	10218000	I don't know if anybody follows the new anime
10218000	10221000	Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan.
10221000	10223000	That show is crazy.
10223000	10225000	Yeah, well, we broke down the show,
10225000	10227000	and, like, in... Not the show, I'm sorry.
10227000	10229000	We broke down the song into, like, different parts
10229000	10231000	and translated it, and then at the end of the show,
10231000	10234000	we kind of, like, all sing, like, on Adobe Connect.
10234000	10237000	And, you know, we also have a meetup that we also...
10237000	10239000	Some of the local people kind of speak, you know,
10239000	10243000	we meet up in person and kind of sing at, like, karaoke bars, but...
10243000	10246000	I don't know why, but I love the idea
10246000	10248000	that your show ends with karaoke.
10248000	10253000	Like, I don't know a lot of shows that do that.
10253000	10255000	Like, maybe we need to do that here at OLR.
10255000	10257000	We end every night with a rousing rendition of
10257000	10262000	So Long, Farewell, Avita's Ain't Good Night.
10264000	10266000	I second the no.
10266000	10267000	Damn it.
10267000	10269000	I'm branching out and doing my own show.
10269000	10272000	You know, the lag kind of, like, throws people off.
10272000	10274000	It does give you a chance to learn a little bit more
10274000	10278000	about the anime or the Japanese pop band
10278000	10280000	that you're probably interested in,
10280000	10282000	and maybe a little few words of Japanese, too, but...
10282000	10284000	Well, we do have a show about anime on the network
10284000	10286000	called Anime Jam Session, which is a good time,
10286000	10288000	but it sounds like you have a different approach
10288000	10289000	to the way you do it.
10289000	10290000	It sounds like a lot of fun.
10290000	10292000	I will have to check that out.
10292000	10294000	That sounds fun.
10294000	10297000	Shoot me an email, robatvognetwork.com,
10297000	10299000	and we'll chat a little more.
10299000	10300000	Cool.
10300000	10302000	Well, other than that, that's pretty much it.
10302000	10304000	You guys still playing Final Fantasy XIV, right?
10304000	10305000	Ready for phase four?
10305000	10307000	I have been playing the shit out of that beta.
10307000	10309000	I don't know a better way to put it.
10309000	10311000	I literally, I told myself this weekend,
10311000	10312000	I'm not going to play it.
10312000	10313000	I'm done.
10313000	10314000	I'm just, I'm going to wait for the,
10314000	10315000	I don't want my character to get erased,
10315000	10317000	and then I'm sitting there and I'm leveling.
10317000	10319000	I think I got to level 25,
10319000	10322000	and I was doing the Totama dungeon this morning,
10322000	10324000	which is like, I mean, there's only one other dungeon
10324000	10326000	in the beta after that, and I just,
10326000	10328000	I'm not going to be able to have enough time to get to that,
10328000	10330000	but I, yeah, I've been playing the shit out of that beta.
10330000	10332000	It's a lot of fun.
10332000	10333000	That's cool.
10333000	10335000	Okay, great, because, like, I was wondering
10335000	10337000	if you guys had, like, a little group on here
10337000	10339000	that might be doing some sort of, like,
10339000	10341000	free company LOR.
10341000	10342000	We will.
10342000	10343000	We don't have a link shell yet.
10343000	10344000	I actually made one for,
10344000	10345000	I did?
10345000	10348000	Yes, but link shells are really just chat channels.
10348000	10351000	The free companies are really the, like, guilds,
10351000	10352000	a la WoW or whatever.
10352000	10354000	There will absolutely be something like that.
10354000	10357000	At least Horde House is going to lead one somewhere.
10357000	10360000	I will have more information on that
10360000	10361000	when we know the full server list.
10361000	10363000	Right now we're on Behemoth,
10363000	10365000	but that could change for phase four,
10365000	10367000	but we're going to commit to something soonish here.
10367000	10369000	We just want to figure out where our frenzies are going to be
10369000	10371000	and try to pick the best server.
10371000	10372000	Cool, cool, okay.
10372000	10374000	All right, so I'll just continue to just chime in
10374000	10376000	on the network and find out more.
10376000	10379000	We will whore the shit out of it here on OLR
10379000	10380000	once the game's out.
10380000	10381000	Awesome.
10381000	10382000	All right, guys.
10382000	10383000	All right.
10383000	10384000	Well, you take care, buddy.
10384000	10385000	Good luck with your show.
10385000	10386000	Adobe Connect.
10386000	10387000	I have not heard, you know, Adobe Connect,
10387000	10389000	I know because during my day job,
10389000	10390000	I'm a corporate trainer,
10390000	10393000	so I've used Adobe Connect in meetings of that sort,
10393000	10396000	but I've never heard of doing a podcast through Adobe Connect,
10396000	10397000	but I'm thinking about it going,
10397000	10398000	well, it makes sense.
10398000	10399000	It would work.
10399000	10400000	Why not, right?
10400000	10403000	It's very similar to Google Hangout in many ways.
10403000	10405000	Yeah, besides the payments,
10405000	10407000	unfortunately it's kind of expensive,
10407000	10409000	like $80 a month,
10409000	10412000	and you get a chance to utilize some of the tools
10412000	10415000	like talking through a chat menu,
10415000	10417000	controlling the desktop,
10417000	10419000	and even passing the microphone or the camera
10419000	10421000	to someone else in the chat.
10421000	10423000	It's a little bit more interactive.
10423000	10427000	I think that maybe if we moved to something like this
10427000	10429000	we'd probably be dying, you know, so.
10429000	10430000	Good times.
10430000	10431000	All right, buddy.
10431000	10432000	Well, thanks for the call.
10432000	10433000	Good luck with your show,
10433000	10435000	and we'll talk to you again here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10435000	10436000	Thanks.
10436000	10437000	All right, later.
10437000	10440000	1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype,
10440000	10441000	Orange Lounge Radio.
10441000	10443000	I just got a tweet.
10443000	10445000	I love the interactiveness of the show.
10445000	10448000	I just got a tweet from Gaming Nerd
10448000	10450000	who goes by GNVersion2 on Twitter
10450000	10453000	that says Namco Classic Collection Volume 2
10453000	10457000	is a collection featuring Pac-Man, Dig Dug, and Rally X,
10457000	10459000	I think that was, yes, the other game,
10459000	10462000	in both original and arrangement versions.
10462000	10463000	Hold on, I'm Googling this right now
10463000	10464000	to see if it's what I remember.
10464000	10467000	Somebody help me fill time while I ask for more calls.
10467000	10469000	I probably have that at home, you know,
10469000	10471000	that Namco collection.
10471000	10475000	Well, I mean, the ones that they released at home,
10475000	10478000	but yeah, I think I do remember that one
10478000	10480000	because that was it, that was it.
10480000	10481000	Yes, this is it.
10481000	10483000	This is totally what I was thinking of.
10483000	10485000	You win a cookie.
10485000	10486000	I don't know how to,
10486000	10487000	I'm gonna shove a cookie through Twitter,
10487000	10489000	and I hope it made it in one piece.
10489000	10490000	That is exactly the game I was thinking of.
10490000	10491000	That person probably already has
10491000	10493000	lots of cookies on their computer.
10493000	10494000	Probably.
10494000	10496000	Yes, that is exactly the game I was thinking of.
10496000	10497000	I'm looking at these screenshots.
10497000	10498000	I remember this whole little one
10498000	10500000	with like Pac-Man and the temple
10500000	10501000	and with the little jumps.
10501000	10504000	Yep, you, sir, are win.
10504000	10505000	Thank you.
10505000	10510000	And next, hook me up with a link for a ROM.
10510000	10512000	All right.
10512000	10514000	Love the interactiveness here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10514000	10515000	Let's go to the tweets.
10515000	10516000	That was on my personal Twitter,
10516000	10518000	but you know what?
10518000	10520000	Sometimes I'm gonna bring up personal stuff on the show
10520000	10522000	because I had to know what game that was.
10522000	10524000	Let's go to tweets that went to the OLR account,
10524000	10526000	and then, Loki, I'll go over to you
10526000	10527000	for some more last-minute stories.
10527000	10530000	Again, 1877 game OLR or username on Skype,
10530000	10532000	Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to get in on the show.
10532000	10534000	Sj100matt sent us a tweet that says,
10534000	10537000	there's a Kickstarter to help open the largest pinball museum
10537000	10538000	in Southern California, too.
10538000	10540000	You know I got a text message on this.
10540000	10541000	They were at Cosigami Expo.
10541000	10543000	Melody sent me a text on this,
10543000	10547000	and I think we might have an interview with them
10547000	10548000	in the coming weeks.
10548000	10550000	I don't want to promise, but that might actually happen.
10550000	10551000	But you can check that out.
10551000	10554000	They're called Museum of Pinball on Twitter.
10554000	10557000	They've only raised 15,000 out of 150,000,
10557000	10559000	but they've got 24 days to go, so they might make it.
10559000	10562000	But that's pretty awesome.
10562000	10563000	I hope they do it.
10563000	10566000	They're going to build a huge museum of pinball.
10566000	10568000	Isn't there already a museum in the Bay Area?
10568000	10569000	There's also one in Las Vegas.
10569000	10570000	Yeah?
10570000	10572000	In fact, I've been to the one in Las Vegas
10572000	10574000	before they moved to their newer location,
10574000	10576000	and the one in Las Vegas has a pinball circus
10576000	10580000	and all kinds of machines you just don't see anywhere.
10582000	10584000	All right, some other tweets here.
10584000	10586000	DJ Rama sent us a link about,
10586000	10591000	Xbox One gets booed out of Evo while demoing Killer Instinct.
10591000	10592000	Ouch.
10592000	10593000	This doesn't sound good.
10593000	10595000	I'm trying to bring up the story right now.
10595000	10599000	I don't know if the booing is just sensationalism or what,
10599000	10600000	but let's see.
10600000	10604000	Apparently, fucking ads.
10604000	10607000	I'm having a hard time bringing this up on my phone.
10607000	10608000	Let's see.
10608000	10610000	The Double Helix and Mad Catz guys were at Evo
10610000	10614000	to pimp fight stick accessories and Killer Instinct,
10614000	10617000	which, of course, was originally shown at E3,
10617000	10623000	and a lot of hostility, I guess, shown at the event,
10623000	10626000	even though the gameplay for Killer Instinct looked pretty good,
10626000	10628000	and there's a video on there.
10628000	10632000	But then it says the crowd was moderately accepting of Killer Instinct,
10632000	10635000	but the fact that they were booing the Xbox One at such a core event
10635000	10641000	like Evo 2013 speaks volumes about what gamers actually feel about the console.
10641000	10642000	These weren't casuals.
10642000	10645000	These weren't grandpas and grandmas buying consoles for Little Timmy.
10645000	10647000	These are the Big Timmies.
10647000	10648000	Hmm.
10648000	10650000	The story from Cinnamablend.com.
10650000	10653000	So it just sounds like a few angry mobsters.
10653000	10656000	I don't know how much I...
10656000	10657000	I don't know.
10657000	10661000	It sounds like there were just a few angry gaming nerds there,
10661000	10665000	and, you know, they unfortunately got picked up by the media.
10665000	10667000	Ooh, I heard about this.
10667000	10669000	Sj100mad is also sending us this tweet.
10669000	10671000	Even I'm excited about this, and this says a lot.
10671000	10676000	NHL 14, you know, hockey, is going to have an NHL 94 mode,
10676000	10679000	which is like one of the best games ever, right?
10679000	10683000	Complete with original sound effects, controls, and visuals.
10683000	10684000	Amazing.
10684000	10687000	You know what's sad is that's totally going to sell tons of copies of that game,
10687000	10690000	because NHL 94 is like one of the best sports games ever.
10690000	10694000	Now, before I give you all those concessions, Sj100mad,
10694000	10695000	I'm going to say this.
10695000	10700000	NHL 94 is no Blades of Steel, but it's still pretty cool.
10701000	10703000	I know a lot of people disagree with me there.
10703000	10708000	AJ Twist wanted to alert us to the Ultra Street Fighter IV game as well.
10711000	10716000	ActDeft is tweeting us about Mane6, who created Fighting is Magic,
10716000	10719000	is posting progress on their new game.
10719000	10722000	Didn't they have to do something where they took the license out of it,
10722000	10724000	and now it's like a different type of game?
10724000	10727000	So I'm trying to scan through the update here real quick.
10728000	10731000	Did they just change the horses, basically?
10731000	10733000	Maybe.
10733000	10736000	Magical horse fighting game or something now?
10736000	10740000	Well, it's some behind-the-scenes look at Mane6.com.
10740000	10741000	You can check that out there.
10741000	10743000	It's a little bit technical.
10743000	10746000	I was hoping we could see a little more in-game or whatever,
10746000	10750000	but you can at least see the work that goes into drawing these things.
10750000	10754000	I guess why it is such a big deal when you have to go back and change the characters.
10755000	10758000	I'm sure ActDeft had something else he wants me to mention on that.
10758000	10760000	He'll yell it in chat real quick.
10760000	10763000	But while I'm waiting for that, I will mention TigerClaw's tweet here
10763000	10765000	that says Valve introduces Pipeline,
10765000	10768000	a program for teens seeking careers in the game industry.
10768000	10770000	That's pretty cool.
10770000	10773000	I'm trying to read more about this here.
10773000	10776000	I get it. Valve, Pipeline. Get it? Get it?
10778000	10781000	Pipeline is a program for teens seeking careers in the game industry.
10781000	10783000	I get it. Get it?
10784000	10787000	Pipeline is an experiment to see if we can take a group of high school students
10787000	10790000	with minimal work experience and train them in the skills and methods
10790000	10793000	necessary to be successful at a company like Valve.
10793000	10797000	There's nothing there yet besides a video and an FAQ,
10797000	10799000	but hopefully that's going to change in the near future,
10799000	10801000	especially as we get into the new school year, right?
10801000	10805000	Here we will teach them to make two highly critical games
10805000	10808000	and then delay the third one forever,
10808000	10812000	thus building infinite anticipation for said sequel.
10812000	10815000	Yes, these high schoolers will be working on Half-Life 3.
10817000	10819000	The next Half-Life 3.
10819000	10824000	Rama in chat helping to clear up about the Fighting is Magic new game.
10824000	10827000	Lauren Faust is creating new characters for the game
10827000	10831000	on the Skullgirls engine that they got for free after the Kickstarter.
10831000	10833000	Now I remember that. That's right.
10833000	10835000	Even though they couldn't use those characters,
10835000	10837000	the creator was going to make new characters,
10837000	10840000	and then the folks behind Skullgirls were really into it.
10840000	10845000	They're apparently bronies over there at Skullgirls.
10845000	10847000	So that's pretty cool.
10849000	10852000	Congrats to all you fans who are going to be in that game.
10852000	10854000	I'm sure you guys will be excited about that.
10854000	10855000	One last call for calls.
10855000	10859000	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
10859000	10861000	I'll check in with Loki one more time
10861000	10863000	and see if there's any other last minute stories or what have you.
10863000	10864000	I have nothing.
10864000	10866000	Nothing? Yeah, that's it for tweets too.
10866000	10867000	We running out of show?
10867000	10869000	Must be time to stick a nail in it.
10869000	10871000	All right. I guess we're done.
10871000	10873000	The Skype line's not ringing.
10873000	10874000	It's over.
10874000	10876000	Sorry to those that didn't get through.
10876000	10880000	But, well, I guess maybe I missed you when I was on another call.
10880000	10881000	I don't know.
10881000	10882000	But you can always email us.
10882000	10884000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.
10884000	10886000	Or Skype could just be working like Skype.
10886000	10888000	Yeah, that's true.
10888000	10890000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
10890000	10892000	Jason in our chat room is piping up saying,
10892000	10895000	Pipeline isn't going to teach them to make games.
10895000	10899000	It's going to teach them to make hats, cards, and other trinkets.
10899000	10902000	You know, this is becoming a more and more popular thing in high schools
10902000	10904000	to take a more trade school approach.
10904000	10907000	And I honestly, you know, from somebody who just,
10907000	10909000	I've been open about this on the show before.
10909000	10911000	I didn't finish college.
10911000	10915000	And the reason why is because the industry I was studying at the time
10915000	10916000	was radio and television.
10916000	10920000	And after interning at, I almost said what network it was
10920000	10921000	and I really shouldn't.
10921000	10924000	But interning at a TV station and doing all this, you know,
10924000	10929000	stuff in the past, I just felt like I wasn't really going to be happy
10929000	10931000	in that, doing that stuff.
10931000	10936000	So, this show is kind of a byproduct of what I did get out of college,
10936000	10937000	which I'm very thankful for.
10937000	10941000	But otherwise, I went into the working world and just worked my way up,
10941000	10942000	you know.
10942000	10944000	And I think being able to expose high schoolers to like those like really
10944000	10947000	entry level job skills, I think is a great thing for some people.
10947000	10949000	And I'm not knocking college.
10949000	10951000	College is a great thing for some people.
10951000	10952000	It just wasn't for me.
10952000	10956000	I honestly wish that for a lot of fields, especially the one that I'm in,
10956000	10961000	that it didn't go so much from paying, you know, the $50,000 for college
10961000	10966000	and went more into, you know, an apprenticeship type environment.
10966000	10969000	You know, not an unpaid internship because to me that just seems like
10969000	10972000	some form of required slavery.
10972000	10977000	But, you know, I think that it should work on, I mean, yeah,
10977000	10981000	you need to go to college, like for me, yeah, going to take art history,
10981000	10984000	going to take anatomy, going to take things are all helpful.
10984000	10987000	But I think when it comes to actually the industry type of job,
10987000	10990000	it should be one-on-one working with somebody.
10990000	10994000	You know, some type of, you know, you work as an apprentice,
10994000	10997000	you become a journeyman, you know, like back in the day.
10997000	11002000	Anyhow, I don't want people to misunderstand what we're trying to like say here.
11002000	11005000	OLR is anti-college. No, that's not it. It's just, you know.
11005000	11006000	I'm having fun at college.
11006000	11007000	Yeah.
11007000	11008000	I'm not going to a four-year yet.
11008000	11011000	So, there's many different ways to learn.
11011000	11017000	Anyhow, that about does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
11017000	11020000	I really want to thank you guys for tuning in tonight and supporting the show
11020000	11022000	and supporting independent podcasting.
11022000	11025000	You know, if you like what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio,
11025000	11027000	please tell a friend or five about the show.
11027000	11030000	Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio and help grow our family.
11030000	11031000	We really appreciate it.
11031000	11033000	Bradley, thank you very much for being here tonight.
11033000	11035000	We didn't get to hear a whole lot from you tonight,
11035000	11036000	but I hope you had fun here on the show.
11036000	11037000	Sure. It was good.
11037000	11039000	And feel free to pop back in any time.
11039000	11041000	It's always a pleasure to have you on.
11041000	11042000	Yep, yep.
11042000	11043000	Next time, we'll play a game or something.
11043000	11046000	You can actually have a little bit more of a say in or something.
11046000	11050000	But see you hopefully in less than six months.
11050000	11051000	Don't be a stranger.
11051000	11054000	Any final thoughts you want to get out for the listeners?
11054000	11059000	Well, after this show, I'm going to probably go see Pacific Rim
11059000	11060000	because that looks pretty cool.
11060000	11065000	And it is a goddamn travesty that that fucking Adam Sandler movie
11065000	11068000	outpaced Pacific Rim. I'm so angry.
11068000	11070000	There's so much wrong with America.
11070000	11074000	Unfortunately, they did not cancel the apocalypse.
11074000	11078000	Ugh. Horrible. Anyway.
11078000	11080000	Yeah, because there are a lot of dumb people.
11080000	11082000	So, more people need to go see Pacific Rim.
11082000	11084000	Do you have anything you want to...
11084000	11086000	You don't really have like a Twitter or anything.
11086000	11088000	Do you have any websites you want to pimp or promote while you're here?
11088000	11090000	You don't really have any of that stuff, do you?
11090000	11092000	No. The only thing I really have that's game related
11092000	11094000	is like I have a backloggery thing.
11094000	11096000	Oh, okay.
11096000	11099000	I don't really have loads of people on that other than some place.
11099000	11102000	That's a pretty cool place if you want to list your games,
11102000	11104000	but it takes forever to put them in there
11104000	11107000	because if they don't have any drop down, you have to put it in yourself.
11107000	11110000	It tells me to keep up with the million things I'm playing.
11110000	11112000	I have like 400 plus. Let me wear it.
11112000	11114000	Oh, my. 400 plus?
11114000	11116000	483 unfinished games.
11116000	11117000	Oh, my God.
11117000	11119000	And I bought more already.
11119000	11121000	You can really see how far behind you
11121000	11124000	and how much crap you have on Steam and everything.
11124000	11128000	Does it make a competition out of like who can catch up on their backlog more?
11128000	11129000	Does it give you trading cards?
11129000	11130000	No.
11130000	11131000	Oh, bummer.
11131000	11137000	They do have like little icons that show up depending on what you've finished.
11137000	11141000	Like I have Confused because I have playing 10 plus games at once.
11141000	11145000	That sounds like me.
11145000	11147000	All right. Well, thanks again for being here.
11147000	11148000	We'll see you soon.
11148000	11150000	I guess we'll go to Dark Sakura.
11150000	11152000	What's your final thought tonight?
11152000	11157000	My final thought is I wish I had ice cream.
11157000	11162000	My final thought tonight is, well, maybe we can give you a Greek yogurt bar.
11162000	11163000	I mean, it's not ice cream, but.
11163000	11165000	That's okay. Thank you, though.
11165000	11166000	Thought we'd offer.
11166000	11170000	My other final thought is Shane is trying to course me into doing a Let's Play tonight
11170000	11174000	on one of the streaming sites, so be looking for that.
11174000	11179000	He wants me to play a game called Slender Man, which is a scary game.
11179000	11181000	Why are you laughing over there?
11181000	11182000	That'll be funny.
11182000	11184000	So apparently that's going to happen later on.
11184000	11186000	But I do have to work tomorrow, so we can't go too late.
11186000	11189000	So but stay tuned once I get the show up.
11189000	11191000	If I have some time, I'll maybe go to that.
11191000	11192000	You should just play Surgeon Simulator.
11192000	11193000	I mean, that's just as funny.
11193000	11194000	Is it?
11194000	11197000	And everybody should buy Surgeon Simulator if you haven't yet.
11197000	11200000	2013 because it's just stupid.
11200000	11202000	Is it still three bucks or was that the first four bucks?
11202000	11203000	It's really cheap.
11203000	11206000	It's like I have it.
11206000	11207000	I have it in front of me, I think.
11207000	11213000	Which, by the way, speaking of Let's Play channels, I may be creating my own channel independent of the OLR channel
11213000	11216000	just because Dar Sakura has her own channel.
11216000	11219000	And I want to be able to do things that don't necessarily have the OLR name attached to it,
11219000	11223000	just because, you know, I don't want to be OLRs for all of us.
11223000	11227000	So we'll have like maybe hopefully I'm hoping we can bring the webcam back.
11227000	11230000	Streaming the show is in the future and so forth.
11230000	11231000	But there you go.
11231000	11234000	Code Man says, can you record it, please?
11234000	11236000	I'm going to try.
11236000	11238000	I don't want to promise tonight.
11238000	11241000	I feel like I should do a test run of something else tonight and then do Slender Man,
11241000	11247000	but I am very interested in getting into the YouTube scene of Let's Play.
11247000	11248000	I'll leave it at that.
11248000	11253000	I know that the program that you were using before and the one that I'm using still automatically records.
11253000	11254000	Oh, nice.
11254000	11258000	I said to make sure I don't have performance suffering because of it, but I shouldn't.
11258000	11259000	We'll see.
11259000	11260000	Okay.
11260000	11263000	Loki, your last, your final thought tonight.
11263000	11266000	I wish I had no headache.
11266000	11267000	Oh, you want some ibuprofen?
11267000	11268000	No, I got it.
11268000	11269000	I'm going to go home and take them.
11269000	11270000	All right. I feel better.
11270000	11272000	All right. That does it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
