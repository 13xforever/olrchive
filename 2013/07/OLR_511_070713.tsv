13883	26998	Tonight, July 7th, 2013, two gaming companies find themselves hacked this week, Xbox One reputation system matching hopes to group trolls with trolls, and we find out why the Wii Vitality Sensor disappeared.
32355	36757	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36817	43780	It's Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 511 for July the 7th, 2013.
43980	56866	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here to join you over the next couple hours to talk about video games and gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, all things gaming with you guys in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and as well as my co-host...
57666	59307	One, just one right now in studio.
59347	61288	Say hello to Loki, Techmaster Loki here tonight.
61369	61709	Hello.
61909	62589	How are you doing, Loki?
62849	63470	I'm doing fine.
63490	63950	Yeah?
65591	69474	My decision to not get fries was, it paid off, I think.
69894	74357	Yes, you made a little fast food decision tonight, right?
74377	83663	Well, yeah, because I normally go to fast food and stuff, and a lot of times, especially in the evenings, and even sometimes during the lunch hours and stuff, you go to McDonald's or something like that, and
84543	85644	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
109702	118657	and no fries and just a large drink and then that ended up being like three bucks and I'm just as full from it so I think that's the way to go
119909	121149	There you go, saving money, right?
121209	121630	Exactly.
121670	123790	And then you don't have crappy, soggy french fries.
123810	125011	But I'll tell you what's even worse.
125411	127551	Yes, we do talk about fast food occasionally on the show.
127571	127992	You know what?
128692	129192	It is what it is.
129492	131393	It is part of the gamer lifestyle.
131433	136094	Well, if you want to believe... I mean, Mountain Dew and Doritos isn't exactly fast food, but you get the idea.
137555	140556	Okay, so just the other day, I go to Carl's Jr.,
141596	142076	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
160183	171346	so I get the fries and I can like smell them in the bag I'm like mmm smells like french fries right mmm smells so good I get all the way home open the bag they gave me regular fries instead of criss-cross fries like the one reason I go to Carl's Jr.
172186	183749	denied so mad it's like you want to just drive back to the building and scream at somebody some poor guy who made a mistake but I'm just too lazy and I ate the fries anyway what can you do what can you do
185089	198817	Alright, go to our chat room, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern Right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, live.vognetwork.com Queen Simeon chat says, is that what Carl's Jr.
198937	199057	is?
199117	210904	Yes, it's pretty much Hardee's Some people that have had both tell me they're different I think they serve different things, their menu is slightly different They were selling like Hardee's biscuits here at one point, I don't know
211204	214265	It's interesting how all that stuff... Just put the same menu on there.
214285	219347	It's not like people on the East Coast eat so much different things than the people on the West Coast.
219948	220668	It's not all that.
221048	222989	It's interesting how fast food really varies.
223109	228591	It's not like we're in Hawaii where beef is not plentiful and there is a lot of spam.
229212	234974	I don't understand why it has to be that different when you have a chain that's on both sides of
235214	238616	Well, and I don't understand why they just won't put In-N-Outs on the East Coast.
238636	242638	Because anytime I have a friend from about... What's the furthest In-N-Out goes out?
242678	243539	I think Texas now.
243959	248742	So anything further east than Texas, if they come out here to visit or whatever, it's like, we got to go to In-N-Out.
249002	249722	We got to go have In-N-Out.
251003	253484	It's a good fast food burger, don't get me wrong.
253564	256606	But I'm like, God, why don't they open one up in New York already?
256746	259548	It's just wanting to get the franchise there.
259568	262129	It's just like, why do we have Dunkin' Donuts over here?
262349	263130	Amen to that.
265391	265711	I don't know.
267091	268172	There's a lot of reasons, I guess.
268232	273214	It's just whether people want to franchise something like that far away.
273414	273674	I don't know.
273714	274714	I thought it'd be kind of cool.
274875	277195	People are always shocked when I tell them we don't have Dunkin' Donuts here.
277335	281657	We do not have Dunkin' Donuts here, people, which sucks because I love their coffee.
282017	287059	I would go there as opposed to Starbucks if I could, even though it's so terrible for you.
287179	288720	It's so good, I can't help it.
288780	289320	DarkSakura.com
310555	317541	The only bummer is that she was going to kick off the show with her talk about Atari Party, which is a local event here in Davis.
333393	334113	Thanks for watching!
352839	353399	Thanks for watching!
370451	371832	Did you play Atari 2600 growing up?
372592	375313	No, I didn't have a 2600.
376013	380975	Well, my friends did, but I had a ColecoVision with an Atari adapter.
380995	386076	So I had Atari games, but it wasn't necessarily playing through the Atari system.
386137	389538	It was that weird adapter that they had.
389558	391298	I didn't even know they had an adapter.
391438	398501	Yeah, it was that really awkward, like, hey, that's kind of infringing on our copyrights type thing, but...
399341	399942	Who cares?
400202	401623	I don't have anything to do with copyrights.
401704	402564	I just play the games.
420863	446441	and I'll play it for like literally like 15 seconds then it says oh on to a new game oh on to a new game it's like I'm gonna try everything at the buffet but there's something different about doing that versus going to sit and play at the TV and like force yourself to sit there at the TV even if it's and I know this is really weird even if it's emulated on the TV like Xbox Game Room perfect example right loads of Atari 2600 games on Xbox Game Room but that shit can hold my attention for a lot longer but
446861	451962	Like, playing something like Stampede, which is a grossly simple game, right?
452002	456343	It's just like, wrangle up the cows and don't let them get past the left side of the screen.
456684	459624	Like, I could sit there and play that shit forever and keep trying to beat my high score and stuff.
459644	462765	But when I'm playing it in emulators, it's like, board now, switch.
462785	463145	Board now, switch.
463165	471027	I remember we played the ColecoVision version of Smurfs and we cycled through the whole game like about 20 times one time.
471287	472888	It just keeps going.
473088	473508	It's funny.
475628	481470	Just this week on, or no, it wasn't this week, but a couple weeks ago on Virtual Console for Wii U, Mario Brothers came out.
481510	482870	And I'm not talking Super Mario Brothers.
482890	487751	I mean the original Mario Brothers, which was that one static screen with the pipes and the turtles and the crabs.
488731	489952	That was on Atari 2600.
490032	492712	And we used to play the shit out of that.
493332	496193	My best friend in second grade and I would play that all the time.
496313	498834	Thanks to the DS, I'm so burnt out on that game.
498854	500594	I remember when Mario Brothers was just like...
501038	502400	Hey, it comes with Mario Brothers.
502441	504845	Every single Mario game that's on the DS comes with Mario Brothers.
504905	508351	You can play with your friends, you know, with the game share thing because it comes with Mario Brothers.
508411	511456	It's like, dude, I don't need to play this game anymore.
511496	513480	You put it on every single cartridge.
514968	543073	going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwolf, our pal from his show that's on right before us here at VOG Network says oink, I loved oink I love that game too but it's really only good to me as a two player game because if I remember right, I don't remember if it was a really advertised feature but you could plug in a second joystick and the second person could be the big bad wolf and it wasn't in all the Activision collections, like it wasn't in some of the ones I remember picking up but that was a great game
543893	544053	on the 2600.
544654	548436	Remember when Activision was like the best games on the system?
549237	550738	Back in the 2600 days?
551598	554280	Dungeon Buster says, H-E-R-O was also fun.
554300	556001	That's one of my all-time favorite 2600 games.
556861	560824	I grew up on that with Commodore 64 first, which has really improved graphics.
561224	562245	That game was kind of awesome.
563065	591725	SSJ100Matt says see I have gamer ADD but I have a hard time with MMOs because of it I wonder how Rob is able to play MMOs with it the social element of MMOs makes it a lot like you want to improve your character so you can go on adventures with friends like you the motivation of having friends to play with is huge like I can sit there on MMO and be chatting on Skype and it's a much kind of different experience than just kind of like a single player with emulators if that makes sense
593366	606896	I have found lately a lot of my friends are leaving World of Warcraft almost all of my co-hosts on Horde House have left Warcraft the one that still plays, Grandpa, plays with his cousins or his family or something now so he doesn't really play with me anymore
607616	633858	I had a couple friends that were playing for a week not a lot of people I know are playing it anymore and it's you know it's sad because it really kills my motivation to play and there's still a couple people that play and I really like I have some friends in Canada that play and I really like them and I like talking to them but they're the only ones anymore that are playing and it makes it really hard to motivate myself to kind of get on and you don't want to do anything because I'm like what am I doing I'm doing a daily dungeon pew pew alliance is dead man move on to something else
634919	637862	I'm falling behind on all these single player games because of the MMOs.
638082	639102	Yeah, that's the thing.
639122	647709	It's like there's all these other games and those MMOs take so much of your time that it's just hard to justify wanting to play them.
649070	652493	TigerClaw in chat says, I bet they left WoW to play Marvel Heroes.
653073	660015	Um, not my co-host on Horde House so much, but Captain Spike, I don't think would mind me outing him from Game Buoy.
660815	665497	We were playing WoW, and he's been playing Marvel Heroes a lot lately, which we all played one night.
665537	666237	It was a lot of fun.
667137	669618	And now Alan got Marvel Heroes too, so I don't know.
669998	672819	That is kind of a thing that's happening right now is Marvel Heroes, but...
673459	674700	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
696383	701806	I'm going to go play some single player games I need to catch up on because I have extensively beta tested this game.
702126	703206	I've given my feedback.
703567	704227	What am I doing?
704447	709990	I'm getting frustrated over this quest where my character is just going to get wiped in a couple days anyway when the next beta phase begins.
710370	715713	So I'm going to wait at this point for the non-erased character beta which is the next open beta.
716013	718554	The characters you create in open beta will carry over to the live game.
718994	722996	So I'm just waiting for that at this point.
723997	724877	That game, man.
725218	725778	I don't know...
727443	744533	I was playing it yesterday and it's just one of those things like, you know, I leveled up to 11 and I've been basically soloing everything because I don't know how to party and everybody that, you know, we kind of talk to, they're never on or I don't see them or I don't have them friended or something.
746471	772337	and so it's like well this is kind of okay I guess and then at the same time like I don't know if I want to keep playing this because I know I'm not gonna play this in the future then at the same time like well I kind of want to play it but I don't at the same time I don't want to play it because there are all these good games that I want to come at you know Grand Theft Auto for sure I mean like I want to play that more online than I want to play Final Fantasy but you know I like Final Fantasy it's just
773932	774412	I'm torn.
776052	780093	A lot of people talk about 1 million people registered for Final Fantasy XIV Beta.
780733	783934	It's going to be very interesting to see how that goes over once the sub fees kick in.
783954	786374	Because I think a lot of people are just playing it as a demo right now.
786414	790395	But sub fees means, you know, you got to pay up if you want to keep going.
790415	790735	We'll see.
790775	791415	It's going to be interesting.
792315	794456	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
794496	800337	Ragenator in chat says, Rob Roberts, I'm probably in the minority here, but I always thought the game room was underappreciated.
800477	800937	I love it.
801857	802298	GameRoom.com
820962	824105	Game Room did what Virtual Console needs to do.
824665	830410	I realized when it came to setting up your little rooms and so forth that that feature was a little bit gimped.
830670	834933	But whatever, when it came to the game playing itself, the live leaderboards was great.
835193	836794	The replays was great.
837515	839637	Being able to send challenges to your friends was great.
840117	846102	That's all stuff that Nintendo's Virtual Console would greatly benefit from and would have a great enhanced value from.
846882	874120	and it's a great way to modernize classic games and I realize there's purists out there that are like you know what nothing matches the old school get my Atari 2600 with its coaxial cable to a TV that won't even get channels anymore because of the digital switch and I totally respect that and that's totally part of the point of a thing like Atari Party is for like-minded people to get together and play that stuff I'm sure or at least Jamie can give us insight to that later so
874540	884209	But, um, I liked Game Room as a modern experience of classic games, and I'm really pissed that Microsoft didn't try to invest a little more into it.
884349	887673	I can't imagine it was this horrific expense.
888754	890235	Like, they weren't writing new games.
890715	896060	Now, granted, they were probably having to go back and tweak an awful lot to get them to work and so forth, but really...
897626	914009	were they just not selling anything then I don't know maybe there's other questions you need to ask yourself but yeah I was a huge proponent of game room and I'm pissed it didn't work and I'm pissed we probably won't get anything like it on Xbox One or anything you know it sucks
914249	918334	I'm surprised we haven't seen PlayStation Home on the PlayStation 4.
918594	923160	I would have thought that would have been kind of cool to step up everything.
923220	927946	Or maybe they just didn't really work out, I guess.
927986	929768	They didn't do what they wanted to do with it.
929888	930389	Or it's like...
930729	938118	Well, PlayStation Home definitely has its cult... I'm not saying that in a negative context, like a cult movie.
939420	944526	PlayStation Home has its cult following, and we've had some of that on this show.
944626	946388	We participated with one of the home events.
946488	947069	It was a lot of fun.
947449	948350	to see that community.
949350	949811	You're right.
949891	952713	It is weird that they didn't mention that going to the PlayStation 4.
953093	957196	I don't know if... I would have thought it was profitable enough with the microtransactions and everything.
957216	960898	It was basically second life on a console and it seemed to be doing well enough in itself.
961458	966642	But do you think that maybe they could... Well, I guess not because of the chipset.
966662	971205	I was thinking in my mind, could they just carry PlayStation Home over to PlayStation 4?
971245	973386	But I guess not for the same reason it's not backwards compatible.
973406	975648	They changed the core chipset.
975888	976649	Yeah, maybe streaming.
976669	976969	Who knows?
978590	988661	Alright, well anyhow, that was a very random potpourri sort of kickoff topic, but let's talk about the video games that we have actually been playing this week, besides just Final Fantasy XIV apparently.
989361	990562	Loki, how was your gaming week?
990582	991243	What have you been playing?
991884	992865	Final Fantasy XIV.
993606	995568	Unfortunately, that's all that I played this week.
996929	997249	Just...
999131	1025729	I only played like a few hours of it actually just the other day just leveling my Thaumaturge and I kept trying to solo stuff it's still really weird how you can like party but not party like people can help you and like can like if you're fighting something someone else can join in and fight the same monster and you still get the experience from it even though you're not partying yeah which is odd I don't know why they have that but it's neat um
1027530	1041058	It is a little frustrating, you know, like there was a monster chasing somebody and I was trying to pull it off of them and the monster was invulnerable and it got in this weird loop where he would run towards me and then run away.
1041498	1043699	And then he'd run back towards me and then run away.
1044240	1047742	And kind of kept going that way back and forth just...
1048562	1049482	I guess that was a bug.
1049522	1050323	Yeah, it's a beta.
1050343	1051103	It might have been a bug.
1051163	1053144	But I've seen the invulnerable thing happen.
1053204	1055405	It's to prevent training of mobs on other people.
1055905	1061467	Like when the person who pulled it loses all the threat, like they run out of range or whatever, the mob retreats.
1061587	1063128	And during that time, it's invincible.
1063188	1064448	Same thing happens in WoW, actually.
1065609	1066789	It'll evade in WoW.
1066969	1067510	It's kind of nice.
1068090	1077118	The only thing I don't like about that, though, is I'll try to pull a mob and then try to use the landscape at my advantage, and it wasn't even that far away.
1077158	1090330	I was on a bridge, and I was trying to attack fish, and the fish couldn't figure out how to turn the corner to the bridge or something, and so it kept going invulnerable, and I couldn't do any damage to it, even though I was well within range.
1091411	1093152	It's just stupid, I guess, so...
1094733	1097614	Did you play around any of the crafting professions?
1097714	1098975	I did a little bit of that this week.
1099055	1100295	It's interesting.
1100375	1101316	It's different.
1101356	1104237	It's not just put the pieces together and craft.
1104837	1109059	There's a little bit of strategy that comes into play on will you get a high quality item or not.
1109679	1111039	How does that work?
1111980	1114600	Your item, as you craft it, has durability.
1115621	1117701	Let's say you'll get four attempts.
1117741	1118962	You can do four moves on it.
1119362	1136627	You can either craft, and it might take two of your attempts to craft it, but as you level in a profession, you'll get things that are like, you get a 70% chance to enhance the percentage of possibility it'll be a high-quality item, or you get a move that will restore all of the durability, but at great cost.
1137067	1137127	You
1137567	1138148	It's just interesting.
1138208	1144093	All your abilities become part of the balancing game of trying to craft the item without breaking it and losing all your stuff.
1144173	1147256	It's not just throw them all together and click craft.
1147616	1149017	I like that they changed it up a little.
1149678	1154302	Yeah, I just was basically doing just the regular quests in the game and then...
1156221	1157863	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1176239	1200214	you know if they really want me to pay attention to something they'll have a cutscene yeah ends up happening usually I still know what the story is and I don't really care but um I just want to get to a point where because I guess it I don't know if it's just in the beta I guess if you get to a certain point where you're level 20 you can actually level all your other subs to 15 that'll only be in the beta but yes and probably not carrying over to open beta so oh well
1200894	1201094	Yeah.
1201894	1205356	But once you get to level 15, they did finally implement the Duty Finder.
1205556	1209837	Not Doody Finder, but Dooty Finder, which basically they're looking for group tool.
1210037	1214879	So you can do dungeons and that fun stuff, which wasn't really a thing in Final Fantasy XI.
1214939	1216740	But that's a huge wow thing, obviously.
1216840	1218660	I haven't really explored too far either.
1218700	1221861	I've just been around the town, so I don't know how to get anywhere.
1222321	1222702	Oh, yeah.
1222742	1224702	You got to get out there and explore.
1224862	1226183	Well, everything's trying to kill me.
1226203	1226503	I haven't...
1226923	1255800	keep doing story quests and around level 15 you get an airship pass and you go to the other towns as part of a quest it's pretty cool alright well if that's it for your gaming week I'll talk about my gaming week a little bit besides Final Fantasy 14 I kind of just needed a break from MMOs this week you know I did I played Final Fantasy 14 extensively on like Friday, Saturday but then I needed a break so I played some other stuff on Wii U virtual console I played Mario Brothers as I talked about before I also played Pilotwings because that came out on virtual console on July 4th
1256520	1276213	and who did not love the game that was made basically to show off mode 7 and it was a great game like I love who doesn't love Rocket Belt that was a rocket what it called Rocket Pack Rocket Belt whatever it was called that's a lot of fun to play as skydiving and all that stuff and making the characters really angry or upset when you do really bad but yeah the mode 7 is fun
1277334	1293344	one thing that at least the Wii U Virtual Console does that the Wii Virtual Console didn't do is that you can take the screenshots and post them to Miiverse and now as of like the end of June you can post those Miiverse posts to Twitter and stuff so I've been doing that a little bit at my Twitter twitter.com
1294484	1323964	Twitter.com slash S-K-I-E is my Twitter sky, S-K-I-E and I've been posting some random things like I posted a funny picture of one of the pilot wings people getting mad at me and like this funny thing I did in Mario Brothers where I had two of the turtles facing each other so it looked like they were talking to each other I like being able to post the screenshots to Miiverse so if you want to follow me on Nintendo Network I'm Rob Roberts on Nintendo Network I will post more hilarity when I can, when I'm feeling funny
1325925	1327186	So I've been doing that on Nintendo.
1327786	1334229	Otherwise, on PC, I suddenly got unexplainably addicted to Steam trading cards.
1336190	1336951	I don't know why.
1337231	1338571	I don't have a good reason for it.
1339952	1341513	I just said this is something I want.
1341913	1352959	You mean I can get silly loot like new backgrounds and experience that means nothing and possibly coupons, I guess that's something, from doing this trading card game, metagame in Steam?
1352979	1353019	No.
1353419	1354959	Yes, I must do this.
1355939	1357300	So here's the thing though.
1357340	1359780	The game kind of makes no sense when you hear it at first.
1360080	1361200	So let me explain it for you.
1362361	1363021	Best I can.
1363061	1363981	Best I know about it.
1365181	1366541	First off, first things first.
1366562	1367762	You have to get this out of your head.
1368142	1370842	Trading cards are not tied to achievements.
1371182	1372983	Achievements have nothing to do with trading cards.
1373023	1373643	They are separate.
1373723	1374723	So get that out of your head.
1374803	1375463	Break that link.
1375943	1376963	First mistake people make.
1377003	1378044	They think the two are tied together.
1378064	1378404	They're not.
1378484	1379124	Completely separate.
1380004	1382306	So certain games have trading cards.
1382886	1384468	And there might be five in a set.
1384508	1385749	There might be nine in a set.
1385789	1386770	There might be seven.
1386810	1389892	You know, there's anywhere from five to nine, it looks like, from the games I've played.
1390633	1392174	Now, there's two different systems.
1392935	1409108	In a game that you paid for, like Super Meat Boy, Magicka, Binding of Isaac, in a game that you paid for, every time you start the game and play it for about 20, 30 minutes and log out, you get a trading card.
1409648	1413390	up to half the number that are in the deck.
1413891	1419214	In other words, Super Meat Boy is probably one of the smallest decks that has five cards in it.
1419494	1421636	You can get three of them by playing Super Meat Boy.
1422336	1425218	Once you've gotten all the cards, you can get repeats though, which sucks.
1425258	1428420	In Fairy Solitaire, I've gotten three of the same card, which is really irritating.
1428860	1457482	but and you don't like if you are only eligible I think I'm eligible for five out of nine in fairy solitaire except three of my five are all the same so I'm gonna have to do some big time trading so what happens once you get half you become eligible for booster packs which are handed out it's this is the part I don't quite have figured out yet maybe somebody in chat can help it seems to be arbitrary like you might get them in a day you might get them in a week but you have to log into steam every week in order to be eligible for the booster packs and
1458002	1475538	and um my understanding is that booster packs spawn as people complete their sets and you have a greater chance to get a booster pack if your steam experience is higher like your steam level 10 your steam level 20 which you can get from the games you own the previous sales and all this other stuff um
1475778	1490475	Um, so once you get the booster packs, then you open them up, and maybe you'll finish your set through a booster pack, which then you can combine your set, and ta-da, you get your badge, and you get like a new profile background, a new emote icon, just a bunch of really, um, um...
1492396	1493217	Cosmetic stuff.
1493917	1496958	But still, kind of, you know, a little more than what achievements get you, right?
1497418	1498639	And possibly a coupon.
1498679	1504881	Like, I saw one YouTube where a guy opened it up and he got, like, a 50% off Company Heroes or something, one of those games, coupon.
1504901	1507402	Which I thought, oh, that's cool, because that's more trading fodder later.
1507702	1509442	Like, I could use that to trade for a card.
1509722	1510823	Like, I'm never going to buy this game.
1511043	1516005	Why don't you give me your Super Meat Boy card and I'll give you my 50% off coupon for this game.
1516525	1516685	So...
1517145	1519727	Steam's created this very interesting thing about it.
1519807	1524411	I kind of wish there was a little more to it than just the play the game.
1525172	1526853	Oh, I missed free to play.
1527887	1534251	For games like Dota, Team Fortress, you don't get the cards for playing, you get the cards for spending money in the online shop.
1534632	1538454	Like for every, I think it's $9 or $10 you spend in the shop, you get a card.
1538674	1543177	So I'm not so focused on those because I don't really play any of those.
1543377	1547420	The only free-to-play game I play through Steam regularly right now is Marvel Heroes and they don't have cards.
1547800	1554185	But I've been going back, like, you know, I've got over 100 Steam games thanks to these bundles and bundles I accumulated in Steam sales.
1554725	1556506	Oh my God, Steam sale coming.
1556786	1557767	Yeah, a lot of that old stuff.
1558367	1562209	Actdeft correcting me in chat saying you can only get them once per week.
1562949	1563529	I did not know that.
1563569	1568651	And Actdeft says you can also buy cards and boosters from the Steam Community Marketplace.
1568951	1569651	Oh boy, see?
1569991	1574133	They've created this whole game where you're spending money to get that one card.
1574353	1575733	I'm going to try not to go that route.
1575753	1577494	I'm going to really try to do this the old-fashioned way.
1577514	1580255	I haven't gotten any booster packs yet because I just got into it this weekend.
1580555	1581436	But I've collected like...
1582916	1592199	I have three Super Meat Boy cards, three really big Sky cards, three Fairy Solitaire cards, one Magicka card, and that'll tell you what else I've been playing with my gaming week.
1592959	1594739	So let me quickly run down some of these other games.
1595760	1596500	Super Meat Boy.
1597460	1602402	Plug in a controller and use it on the PC, it's just as fun as the Xbox 360 version and it's still fun to play.
1602702	1604442	That's a great game to play for a few minutes.
1604782	1610644	You play a few minutes, beat a few rounds, you feel accomplished, get frustrated on a level, whatever, close it, come back later.
1611664	1616248	Really Big Sky is a twin-stick shooter that came out, I think, at the end of last year.
1617929	1620371	I like it, but it's not my favorite twin-stick shooter.
1620431	1627696	And part of the reason I don't like it is that, well, for one, I get really bad performance issues when there's too much stuff on screen on my PC.
1628336	1630318	I probably need to play with the graphics settings and so forth.
1630618	1633200	But I think it starts to become too much.
1633420	1638844	Like, the graphics are just too much, and I can't tell things apart, and it just looks like explosion mania.
1638864	1639064	Yeah.
1639424	1640205	The Binding of Isaac
1662188	1663468	Which is kind of rogue.
1664149	1668370	A lot of people say it's Legend of Zelda, but it doesn't play like Zelda.
1668390	1669650	It plays like a twin-stick shooter.
1670771	1673331	But it's always randomly generated, which is interesting.
1674812	1677493	It's a little bit out there as far as the story goes.
1677573	1681954	And it's one of those things you play it and you're like, you know, not all games are art.
1682874	1685255	Because this one's a little weird.
1685455	1688456	You got monsters that leave poop everywhere that's part of a mechanic.
1688776	1690977	And you find these really odd things that you're...
1691957	1692557	Magica Magica Magica Magica
1721116	1721696	Thanks for watching!
1742663	1743143	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1762154	1764815	and, uh, same thing with Magicka and, and Fairy Solitaire and some of that.
1764835	1772179	You know, I, I played enough Fairy Solitaire to get the game, but now I've really gotten to parts where it starts to just really get irritatingly difficult.
1772579	1773440	So, there you go.
1773760	1775181	That's been my time with Steam this week.
1776601	1783625	Uh, AlphaCanadagram in chat, uh, in reference to The Binding of Isaac says, I only heard it is just like it is Zelda due to the dungeon format.
1784065	1795169	Yeah, and the bombs and the keys, but honestly, the way it plays as a game is a little more similar to Rogue and a twin-stick shooter, even though you can only shoot in the four directions.
1795530	1796730	But weird things happen.
1796870	1801332	You'll find these pills, and you won't know what the pills do until you try using them once.
1801372	1804233	I'm almost positive that was a mechanic in Rogue.
1804333	1806634	You didn't know what stuff did until you used it for once.
1807034	1812358	and some of the pills will give you just derpy face and it goes, I found a pill and I ate it.
1812698	1814599	Some will teleport you to a random room.
1814659	1815580	Some will enhance your health.
1815880	1818222	One of them is a suicide pill.
1818562	1819443	You take it, you die.
1819663	1820163	Game over.
1820443	1820824	One life.
1821304	1821644	That's it.
1821724	1822165	Game over.
1822205	1823205	You start again from the beginning.
1824466	1826828	That's like some Dark Souls level difficulty.
1828123	1830024	Alright, let's move on.
1830844	1831585	Housekeeping.
1831645	1832825	Don't forget to visit us on Twitter.
1832845	1839249	Twitter.com slash OLR and we are also on Facebook, of course, at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1839789	1841370	Just got a text from DarkSakura.
1841430	1845812	She's on her way, so we'll hopefully be seeing her in about 20 more minutes.
1845892	1850915	But in the meantime, we're going to keep on moving with the show and get into gaming news tonight.
1851215	1853116	Loki started us off with one I'm sure you've all heard.
1853836	1856939	Don Matrick has left Xbox.
1856999	1864726	He was originally the president of the, I believe, their entertainment business division.
1865667	1869751	And now he is going to become the president of Zynga.
1870411	1873714	So that's interesting, I guess.
1874475	1876036	I'm not really sure why he did that.
1876997	1890631	I can think of a few reasons why he might have done that, but the kind of general consensus out there is that he's jumping from a sinking ship to a ship that's on fire and in the water somehow.
1891512	1893874	I think I saw that exact comic strip you're referencing.
1894895	1899420	Yeah, it was a ship on fire and a ship being eaten by a shark or something.
1899716	1908140	I don't want to sound like a no at all, but I can't resist in bringing up the fact that just two weeks ago on this show, after the big E3 thing, what did I say about Don Matrick?
1908460	1909280	What did I say, Loki?
1909300	1909780	You remember?
1910221	1913662	You said that he was going to be on the chopping block, I guess.
1913742	1917204	I said he would take the fall and he'd be gone within 365 days.
1917804	1923846	And just like the Xbox reversal thing, which happened in like three days, the Don Matrick thing happened a lot faster than anticipated.
1924146	1924967	But here's the kicker.
1925507	1927348	I actually don't think he was forced out the door.
1927468	1928009	No, I don't think so.
1928029	1934093	But I think Don Matrick, I mean, he's the executive of a... He's now the CEO of a large company, whether you like it or not.
1934153	1936975	At one time, it was a profitable company.
1937656	1940898	I think he saw what happened at E3.
1941338	1942999	He saw what everybody was talking about.
1943500	1945961	He saw this opportunity, and he took it.
1946642	1948443	And I think it was one of those things where it's like...
1950224	1954647	If the Xbox One doesn't do well this holiday season, do I want to be left with no job?
1955128	1958970	Or do I take this job where maybe I can actually turn things around?
1959250	1963813	It is a heck of an opportunity, and it could be a great way for him anyway to repair his image.
1963833	1966635	I mean, let's imagine he does turn Zynga around.
1967296	1971238	And I know a lot of people are ready to pile poop on this.
1971298	1974481	They're like, yay, poopy executive meets poopy company.
1974761	1978063	Go live in your poopy world together making poopville poop.
1978183	1986090	but I don't know if I really see it that way because these are two... You've got a company in a pretty bad situation.
1986390	1989452	You've got an executive that was in a pretty bad situation.
1989813	1995497	Maybe they can help each other more than they can hurt each other and maybe this actually won't end up being the end of the world.
1995737	1997439	I mean, why do we hate on Zynga?
1997959	1999601	Why have we hated on Zynga in the past?
1999921	2001242	What are people's complaints with Zynga?
2001542	2014827	They seem to skirt around IP rights by mimicking as much as they can of a game without outright... I mean, they sometimes outright copy, but they change enough to where they can't get sued, I guess.
2015127	2017048	Or they can't get sued and lose.
2018549	2020630	They'll change things around slightly, but they'll keep...
2021570	2022751	Now, let me ask you this question.
2022771	2026433	What does it take to change a company that's heading in that direction?
2026473	2027654	What does that take?
2042571	2043732	Well, it's not just that.
2044372	2050075	They've had problems where they were buying up other companies and they're spending a lot of money doing that and they weren't making their money back.
2050095	2052217	Okay, what will it take to change that?
2053597	2055158	Someone with good business sense.
2055418	2058960	A new executive, new blood, a big change.
2059401	2060381	A big change.
2060762	2062923	And that's what Zynga's got, is they've got a big change.
2063423	2067305	So now I think Don Matrick and Zynga are really in a position to help each other.
2067605	2070067	We can speculate till the cows come home what that's going to mean.
2070347	2073069	and I know a lot of people joke, Herb Herb, it's always online.
2073089	2074469	Herb Herb, one meets another.
2074770	2079112	Don Mattrick did not come up with always online all by his lonesome self, y'all.
2081353	2083194	But maybe there's some interesting stuff that could come of this.
2083354	2083695	I don't know.
2085123	2088565	Maybe Zynga will separate itself from Facebook a little bit.
2088626	2090347	That's the part that's exciting to me.
2090767	2092648	At least Don Matrick wasn't from Facebook.
2093249	2101575	Maybe Zynga will start to appear on consoles with games that aren't rip-offs of other stuff, like some casually interesting things.
2101595	2114604	I think one of the things you're going to see with the Xbox One, and that's the whole reason why they have that Windows 8 section of the OS, is that you're going to see all these apps that are being developed to run on Windows 8 are going to be able to run on the Xbox One.
2115464	2132555	If they have a Farmville app that runs on Windows 8, I'm not sure if it's going to be just necessarily the RT or if it's just the actual x86 Windows 8, that these will probably be easily ported if not able to run natively on the Xbox One.
2132615	2141020	So you could see these casual games coming to a game console, that and any other sort of app that people make.
2141560	2170660	and that very well that may be why they're not really pushing the whole self-publishing thing because they're like well you publish on Windows 8 you know on that marketplace and then you can publish on the Xbox One as well and that's how they'll try to get people that's how they'll get people to make more apps for Windows 8 because they need apps on that marketplace in order to make Windows 8 seem appealing because kind of like what they have with the App Store on Mac you know they need to have the content there in order to drive it.
2172661	2175143	Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
2175263	2177145	After all, it is the show where every gamer has a voice.
2177805	2179347	Ranma says, I don't hate Zynga.
2179687	2181809	All they're doing is playing the business game like a boss.
2183050	2188374	ShadowNextGen says, Rob, Mattrick's image isn't tarnished except for the internet vocal minority.
2188775	2192378	When it was announced that Mattrick was joining Zynga, Zynga's stock jumped up.
2193158	2196943	I think you're minimalizing the negativity that came out of E3 a little bit.
2197023	2202369	Now, how much of that is tied to metric versus not, that could be argued a little bit.
2202589	2205913	I don't think you can blame one person for the whole Xbox stuff anyway.
2205933	2209297	I don't, but again, like I said two weeks ago, someone's going to take the fall for it.
2210709	2213391	I don't know if anyone's taken the fall yet for it.
2213431	2214531	He may have just jumped ship.
2215252	2220095	I was going to mention, though, that they're going to have... Well, I want to say the second half of this comment here.
2220415	2224598	When it was announced that Mattrick was joining Zynga, Zynga's stock jumped up.
2225158	2225998	Well, exactly.
2226078	2227639	How can things get worse at Zynga?
2227659	2231882	And let's not belittle that Mattrick did have a lot of success at Microsoft.
2232262	2233863	Xbox 360's done very well.
2234283	2238206	So, I think a lot of people see it as, you know, this can only help things.
2238626	2240367	Sure, maybe he had a bad week, but...
2240427	2250579	but at the end of the day Zynga's in the shitter and maybe Don Matrick can help bring them out of that at least and that would be a great thing and sure sure I think a lot of investors saw that too
2252595	2263909	Hey, if Zynga's looking to get some games on the Xbox One or something, it might help to have somebody that used to be working for Microsoft to build those bridges.
2266192	2270317	One other thing, I guess Steve Ballmer, the CEO of Microsoft, he's
2270817	2282948	Considering, I guess, Julie Larson-Green, who is, I guess, the current Windows, you know, CEO or whatever to take over the Xbox division.
2283088	2296059	So, when she's, you know, quite experienced, I guess, she did, like, product launches for Windows 7 and helped design, like, some of the user interface stuff for, like, the Office products.
2296380	2296840	Yeah.
2297941	2304507	Not the newer ones, but like, you know, 2003, 2007, which I thought were sane, you know, and then 2010 came around.
2304747	2306709	It's like, what the fuck is this?
2308310	2311833	So, yeah, it'll be interesting to see how that affects anything.
2311953	2317458	I don't think, a lot of these people in these positions I don't think have a lot, because it seems like it doesn't change too much.
2317518	2320360	Like, you get a new CEO, all of a sudden it's not radically different.
2320560	2322862	It's just, I don't know, we'll see.
2323263	2324504	I mean, they have a game plan.
2324524	2325585	They're sticking to it, so...
2326098	2330784	DungeonBuster in chat says, Larson Green headed up the Windows 8 group after the last head left.
2330944	2332786	Well, when did the last head leave?
2332806	2334588	See, I haven't been following the Windows 8 drums.
2334708	2345101	I just know that the launch of Windows 8, not so great, but they really seem to be making things right with this 8.1 patch, and it seems a lot more exciting this time than the original launch of Windows 8.
2345421	2346141	Thanks for watching!
2364666	2370749	And TigerClaw in our chat says, who do you think should replace Don Matrick when going up on stage at next year's E3 press conference?
2371109	2383336	Well, I mean, if this rumbling is true, it would be Julie Larson-Green, which, you know, I don't know much about this particular executive, I have to say, but however, you know, silly this might sound...
2384276	2386697	Well, it could be Steve Ballmer, but I... He yells a lot.
2387538	2391019	I like the girl power that Microsoft's showing a little bit here.
2391379	2401904	I think it would be a great thing for a female to be taking the lead on this, especially after there were some very shameful things that came out of Microsoft's press conference, whether it was intended or not.
2401944	2403665	It was shameful.
2404706	2433303	I think that would be I mean Microsoft's got this executive possibly coming in the one that used to work for CBS that's now the head of the Microsoft Entertainment Group the head of 343 Studios is female I think that's great I'm all for that type of diversity so you know at least there's that is it will bring a little more diversity but I don't know this gal's credentials or what else she brings to the table outside of that
2433803	2446316	but I think we'll be learning a lot more about her if it's true that she is going to be taking over Microsoft's entertainment division we'll see so alright anyhow I guess we'll move on with news yes
2447051	2447431	Yes.
2447751	2456813	Moving on to a story about Xbox One, and since we've been talking a lot about Windows 8, and I guess if they're bringing in the Windows 8 executive, this might make a lot of sense here.
2458074	2467356	Microsoft Builds Developers Conference last week talked about what could be Xbox One compatibility for Windows 8 apps, and I think you were mentioning this a little bit too, Loki.
2468576	2470197	Yeah, I completely didn't realize.
2470977	2473177	I actually listened to part of the Build thing, too.
2473657	2475958	There was some news out of it that was kind of exciting, but...
2476278	2478300	Well, let me read at least some of the quotes here.
2478360	2479721	We can further talk about this here.
2479801	2484404	Steve Guggenheimer, who is the VP of Developer and Platform Evangelism.
2484744	2486286	I don't know if that's a word this website used.
2486626	2498215	I can't imagine that's a title, but he talked about how folks that would like to start on Xbox One development should start on Windows 8 applications because, quote, Xbox One has two engines.
2498615	2502358	It's got a gaming engine, and it essentially has a Windows 8 engine.
2502718	2505360	And then he showed a web application that was running on Xbox One.
2505740	2515225	Nothing to announce today, but when I talk about that common core, you're seeing that common core in action being able to target other devices over time that run the Windows 8 engine.
2516006	2516346	Hmm.
2517567	2528393	Yeah, I mean, and I already kind of, like, they sort of alluded to that anyways when they're talking about how their OS is set up, how it's three OSs basically on top of each other.
2528413	2533736	You have the Windows 8 OS, the Xbox One OS, and then the one that kind of makes them talk to each other, I guess.
2535508	2537089	The Arbitrator OS.
2537310	2540912	Blackwolf corrects me in chat saying, yes, it is an actual Microsoft title.
2542273	2543834	Strange, but okay.
2543954	2545355	I mean, it makes sense.
2545435	2546216	I get it.
2546416	2550079	When I think of evangelist, I think of the guys on PTL on television.
2552123	2555685	One of the things that was kind of exciting, because now you know how they don't have really X and A anymore.
2555925	2557306	It's kind of gone by the wayside.
2558046	2568671	They did announce a partnership with Unity, where they're going to be allowing porting, or you can make Xbox One games with Unity.
2568951	2572252	That's going to have that built-in support as well, so that's kind of cool.
2572513	2575394	And I think they're going to have PlayStation 4 support as well, so that's...
2576034	2583043	I don't know if it's necessarily replacing X and A, but that may be the new route to go, I guess.
2583704	2589732	Yeah, I was going to say, how useful is it for Windows 8 apps to be on Xbox One when you can't self-publish?
2591158	2613484	But that's the thing, is they may have that where it's going to have access to the app store that's on PC, but they're going to say, well, you can't publish a game on Xbox One, but you can publish an app on the app store and have access to Xbox One, or the Xbox One users will have access to it.
2613545	2615025	Maybe that's how they're going to get around it.
2615685	2618666	I'm thinking to myself, what types of apps could we be talking about here?
2618686	2622768	Are we talking about things like calendar management apps on Xbox One?
2622868	2629631	Because when I think of apps on 360, outside of games, they have a lot of web video players.
2629671	2631652	It seems like everything is some type of video player.
2632552	2638575	I can't think of a whole lot of stuff on 360 that's not some type of video player for some network or some website.
2640107	2641048	Mame got on the Apple Store
2660329	2662911	They loaded it as one of the freeware ROMs.
2663071	2665713	I think it was called Gridly or something was the game.
2665733	2667415	It's an arcade game that went freeware.
2668035	2669336	People released the rights a long time ago.
2669396	2670638	So they put that app on the marketplace.
2670878	2673760	Well, hidden underneath, it was a MAME emulator.
2674401	2682368	And as long as you could get it from the Apple Store in the window before they caught it, all you have to do is use one of those programs that let you browse the file structure on your phone.
2682388	2683709	You just throw ROMs in the directory.
2684069	2686031	You got MAME on your iPad and iPhone.
2687012	2687212	Hmm.
2687352	2690475	Which works great with that little arcade I have sitting over there, just for the record.
2692658	2696402	TigerClaw in chat says, like, how about a VOG app for Xbox One?
2697042	2701166	I'm sure Bobby is wincing, kind of thinking about all the work it would take to make something like that, but...
2701827	2702327	No reason.
2702568	2703848	Loki's learning how to program.
2703868	2705109	Maybe he can take that project up.
2705129	2705750	Well, here's the thing.
2706170	2715856	I don't think that's necessary anymore because nowadays every... Let's hope that their Internet Explorer has HTML5 support.
2715996	2720599	It should be able just to support the website natively and you'd be able to just use the website.
2721099	2743202	so it's not necessary to create a dedicated app for that stuff anymore because browsers are smart enough now to where they can run all that content whereas before they couldn't so you had to build some GameGuru in chat says Unity is going to be the indie platform we shall see I've been hearing a lot of good things about it though
2745444	2750270	to register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com.
2750530	2752233	Use the passphrase, golf.
2753614	2754395	Let's move on.
2754936	2755997	I guess I'll do this story here.
2756158	2761264	Jamie was going to talk about this, but since she's still a few minutes away, it sounds like, I will cover this here.
2762025	2763707	It's a game called...
2764608	2765888	It'll... Is it It'll Do?
2765908	2766869	I think it's It'll Do.
2767189	2768889	Like, It'll... That'll Do, kid.
2769089	2769750	It'll Do.
2770230	2770630	It'll Do.
2770810	2771830	I-T-T-L-E Do.
2772010	2775031	It'll Do is now out on the PC.
2775852	2779953	It'll Do, they say, is a kind of Zelda-esque adventure title.
2780013	2781093	It's very cartoony.
2781413	2783734	It's by Swedish studio Ludosity.
2784134	2789696	It sells for 9.40 euros, or about... That's $13.99.
2789736	2789776	Um...
2794077	2799520	It's kind of like Zelda, but it has its own cartoon aesthetic and it has a lot of self-referential humor.
2799820	2801461	Oh, I like the games that break down the fourth wall.
2801501	2802302	That's always a lot of fun.
2804143	2815389	It pokes fun at itself as your little shipwrecked character and her flying fox, Tipsy, go around terrorizing the island's inhabitants and stealing their wealth and eating their hearts.
2815849	2818651	That doesn't sound very good unless we're talking flashy hearts like Zelda.
2819031	2825719	Well, It'll Do will also be on Mac and Steam and Wii U, Linux, iPad, and Android later this year.
2825939	2830664	If you get it now, you'll get the Steam, Mac, and Linux ports on their release.
2830885	2831185	And OUYA.
2832122	2832602	Oh, and OUYA.
2833643	2835845	I wasn't hearing the story, but... Oh, I see.
2836045	2837846	It's on Twitter, and it's in review right now.
2838867	2839307	Very cool.
2839768	2841669	They review games that go on the OUYA?
2843250	2843951	That's news.
2843971	2845152	I don't know what it says.
2845772	2847914	Probably before it goes on the official marketplace, I would think so.
2847934	2848974	Yep, that's good enough.
2850275	2855597	If you want to see some of the game, there are some Let's Plays available on YouTube if you want to see the game in action.
2856037	2856697	Sounds cute.
2857297	2859258	I would like to check it out, especially if there's a little demo.
2859278	2862179	I can get a sample of it, but I guess there's always a Let's Play if nothing else.
2862539	2864599	You can kind of check out a little bit about what that game's about.
2865039	2869621	Jamie must have earmarked that because that's something she's taken interest in, so we'll ask her when she gets here.
2870021	2870861	But for now, let's move on.
2872341	2874362	So Ubisoft got hacked.
2875602	2876163	Uh-oh.
2876223	2876423	Yeah.
2877024	2887612	So, you know, apparently an unnamed Ubisoft website, they were hacked, and the usernames, email addresses, and password information have all been compromised.
2888253	2893537	Thankfully, there's no sort of payment data in there, but still, you know, you share passwords with...
2895078	2896179	Uplay or something like that.
2896239	2897221	You may want to change them.
2898402	2904428	So they didn't say that they... It says the tag did not originate via any Uplay services.
2904508	2908132	The intrusion targets some of our internal online systems.
2909273	2912497	And I don't know what that's supposed to mean, but whatever.
2912797	2916621	All the more reason why I don't like signing up for these different services.
2916801	2921723	Although, I guess now I'm going to have to sign up for Origin if I want to play Battlefield 3 now, aren't I?
2922563	2924884	I mean, well, on PS3, I think, right?
2924904	2927025	Because you have to do that for Mass Effect, right?
2927065	2928586	Yeah, I have to do it for Mass Effect, yeah.
2928626	2929186	God damn it.
2929226	2929766	Well, whatever.
2929806	2934368	It's not... I think I still have an old EA account that's probably out there anyways.
2934993	2937054	It just sucks that you have to have all these different passwords.
2937074	2946299	And I know there's app solutions and password wallets and things, but I'm going to be honest, and maybe I shouldn't be saying this in my public radio show, but whatever.
2946759	2949921	I kind of have a pool of different passwords I pick from.
2950501	2953823	My bank account has one password that is very hard.
2953923	2956764	It's the most secure type of password.
2957285	2959406	You can't figure it out, and I don't use it for anything else.
2960046	2970938	But sites like Uplay or signing up for random web forum here or there, especially if there's no finances tied to it, I use one password for pretty much all that stuff.
2971098	2971979	It's like whatever.
2972981	2974362	No big deal if you lose it.
2974402	2981150	Oh no, someone's going to take over my account on Minecraft forum or something.
2981570	2987053	Pretty much anything that could potentially have my credit card information on it, I have to basically do a unique password for.
2987073	2988714	But I have my own little system.
2988754	2991475	I don't want to say much more than that, but I have a system doing unique passwords.
2992435	2997438	And then, while it may not affect most of our listeners, Club Nintendo Japan also was hacked.
2998439	3003521	I guess they realized that there is a bunch of unauthorized...
3007483	3009404	Failed login attempts or something like that.
3009605	3020012	And then they said that just under 24,000 illegitimate logins between June 9th and July 4th from over 15 million attempts.
3020672	3031080	So basically said that some of the information compromised in the attack included full names, phone numbers, home and email addresses.
3031860	3035143	And since they don't hold any credit card information, none of that was leaked.
3035643	3036263	Thanks for watching!
3056852	3067220	All right, well, moving on, since you talked about Nintendo of Japan, you know, one item that's been getting a lot of passion lately is the region locking that's on Nintendo's console.
3067260	3078289	And, you know, it's not something that apparently is going to exist on Xbox One or PlayStation 4, which leaves the Wii U kind of the sole holdout when it comes to region locking.
3078569	3086435	And I think we talked last week or the week before about there was a petition going around to try and get Nintendo to reverse course on that and open up their system.
3086955	3095962	Well, I don't want to say that Nintendo necessarily responded to it this week, but there has been more context that's come out about region locking that's making the rounds on the sites this week.
3096502	3107350	And it was an interview with Satoru Iwata, and I believe this was run in IGN, saying that, quote, "...from some people's perspectives, the region lock might seem like a kind of restriction."
3108010	3113612	but each region has its own cultural acceptance and legal restrictions as well as different age ratings.
3113993	3121956	There are always things that we're required to do in each different region which may go counter to the idea that players around the world want the freedom to play whatever they want.
3122516	3128859	Continuing the quote here I hope the game fans can understand that the industry isn't doing this solely out of business ego.
3129459	3131140	There are some reasons behind it.
3132952	3141956	Yeah, but I don't think your average mom isn't going to accidentally import a Japanese copy of some game or something like that.
3142356	3147318	Oh my god, content that's not appropriate for over here is on that game.
3147879	3148599	Oh no.
3148899	3149619	That's not going to happen.
3149679	3156082	It's going to be dedicated fans that know what they want to play are going to pay the fees to import a game to get it over here.
3156182	3157723	I don't know.
3157763	3158483	I don't see the problem.
3158503	3161825	Considering it's not a problem for the other consoles, why should it be a problem for this console?
3163005	3172699	Um, I think the hard thing about this too is that, you know, I get the whole business ego thing and you have your reasons for doing it, but you look really silly when your peers aren't doing it.
3172779	3173560	That's the problem.
3174020	3179528	If Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft were all banded together doing the same thing, this probably wouldn't be an issue in the first place.
3179988	3197266	also I think that they're trying to keep the purity of their marketplace kind of the way it is because they're kind of known for being more of a wholesome console versus the other systems that have a lot of violent games on there so maybe that's the reason is that they want to make sure that
3197907	3206071	Hey, you know, we may have some stuff that comes out in Japan that has maybe a little bit more nudity in it than, say, you know, a version that comes out over here.
3206631	3211013	You know, maybe that's why we don't want to have these games come out over here for some reason.
3211053	3216495	But at the same time, it's not like it's going to accidentally fall into the hands of, like, how they think does that work?
3216535	3220797	I mean, that someone's going to go into the store and somehow get a copy from Japan?
3220857	3221598	I mean, it's just not...
3222378	3223679	They don't do that very often.
3224079	3231163	Whenever we talk about licensing in regions, I can't help but go back 10 years to when we used to talk a lot about Dance Dance Revolution.
3231743	3240068	And part of the interesting stuff about that game is that that became a huge thing over here, but all those machines were being imported from Japan.
3240548	3243309	And a lot of the games people were playing were imported from Japan.
3243750	3250013	There was a lot of... And they couldn't bring it over here because a lot of it came down to music licensing.
3250553	3260578	A lot of the catchy stuff from Dance Dance Revolution, like Butterfly, everybody remembers that from the first time they ever saw DDR years ago, the Butterfly song.
3260958	3271502	Well, that was from a Japanese series of dance albums, and they had a license with the Toshiba EMI, which is the record company in Japan, to do that whole thing.
3271562	3272463	They couldn't just...
3273323	3275104	Do it as is over here.
3295504	3321193	they made a game out of nothing but Konami Originals because you don't have to license that stuff and finally once those games started proving themselves thanks to the fandom and the fact that the peripheral actually sold then they started making more quality games like DDR Max 2, Ultramix 2 which had a lot of US specific licenses that were pretty good in it but even at the end of the day the arcade machines were almost still always coming from Japan until what finally happened
3321533	3324614	Well, they had USA Mix, that was like one of the old ones.
3324694	3329135	Yeah, but that was freaking pity being thrown at us in the US, right?
3329175	3329715	I'll take pity.
3331056	3333476	But it was nothing like Max 2 and Extreme Arcades.
3333796	3345660	I think finally once Supernova hit, it seemed like they were getting songs licensed worldwide, but there was a huge gap between Extreme and Supernova, and there was probably some thought... I kind of miss when they were like, you know, the X...
3346440	3360226	Not necessarily extreme, but like Max around there in Euromix and stuff like that, where each, you know, there was kind of like, you know, you had the European games had their own songs, and the US games kind of had their own songs, and the Japanese games had their own songs.
3360266	3364828	I liked the differentiation there, but now it's just like so much stuff.
3364848	3366388	I don't even know what the fuck's on there anymore.
3366428	3369410	It's just, it is a lot of Konami originals now, but...
3370789	3379372	So when it comes to licensing third-party stuff and so forth, I hate it, but I can understand the point of region locking, why they have to do that.
3379832	3385073	I think we need to understand we're in a more world market now with the internet and kind of find ways around that.
3385493	3386514	Here's where it comes down to.
3386974	3390475	It's the fault of, I think, the way the U.S.
3391015	3394936	music industry works, and I'm not sure it's just limited to the U.S., but
3395356	3396177	Thank you for watching!
3411605	3439205	and what that means is you can license the music you pay for the license or whatever for your game or whatever you want to do you have it for your game but because it's on your game you're still not licensed for public performance so if you have your game in an arcade or something like that you still have to pay for the performance rights for those tracks that are in the game because it's being publicly displayed
3440565	3450268	So, that was probably one of the problems where they wouldn't necessarily want to have to pay additional fees to license, you know, first off, to license all the music over here.
3451208	3453829	Again, although, I mean, I understand that you can import everything.
3454349	3460011	But at the same time, though, you know, to go back to the whole region, importing, how many people really import games?
3460371	3460951	Not a whole ton.
3461011	3464252	I mean, granted, I really do want to import Earth Defense Force, and I probably will.
3464712	3464872	But...
3465812	3468873	Honestly, back in the day in PlayStation, it was so easy.
3469033	3470634	And I've openly admitted this on the show.
3470894	3471935	I didn't import things.
3472015	3472735	I pirated them.
3473555	3474316	I had no problem.
3474416	3476136	I bought DDR USA Mix.
3476176	3477817	I bought DDR Konomics.
3477837	3479978	And I bought all the US stuff they ever put out.
3480378	3481058	But you know what?
3481539	3482759	I pirated the Japanese games.
3482839	3484680	If you're not going to put it out here for me to buy...
3486618	3487499	I'm gonna get what I want.
3488160	3490424	I would have happily bought those games if they had released them in the US.
3490464	3492787	And I did buy a lot of those games that came out in Japan.
3492807	3494390	I bought soundtracks and stuff.
3494470	3494831	A lot.
3495151	3496213	Not necessarily all of them.
3496693	3497054	A lot.
3497975	3501561	I'm not saying what I did was right, but I'm just saying this is what drives people to do it.
3504649	3511816	I bought a lot of games at anime conventions.
3512336	3514478	I had R4 and stuff like that.
3514638	3515399	Fantastic game.
3515920	3517641	And Dance Dance Revolution.
3517661	3520464	What the hell was that?
3520564	3521145	Extra Mix.
3521905	3522346	Remember that one?
3522506	3527191	That was like fourth plus songs and the solo mix songs, I think.
3527211	3527351	Yeah.
3528743	3538545	Alright, going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com SSJ100Matt says, Seriously, what's wrong with having multiple windows saying before you purchase, Hey, this is an import title.
3538605	3539866	It won't be in your native language.
3539886	3541766	If you're going to complain about it, then you shouldn't buy this.
3542046	3543907	I think that does happen on PlayStation.
3545207	3550829	Like the Mega Man games that are all up were all the Japanese Mega Man redos that are all in the PlayStation marketplace.
3551549	3554169	And I think their warning is like in tiny text.
3554209	3555310	You could probably easily miss it.
3555390	3555750	I think.
3556330	3556550	I think.
3556854	3570062	Well, here's the other thing, too, is why can't they have, like... Well, they could easily build this in, but I know they don't want to because they want to make money from, you know, I guess just impulse purchases.
3570142	3575746	But why couldn't they just, you know, have like Android does where, say, you need to return the game.
3575786	3579308	You can do it within, like, you know, say seven days or something like that and get your money back.
3579788	3589755	and at the very least, you know, if it's, oh, I can't understand this game because it's all in Japanese or something, you know, maybe I thought I could get through, but it's too text intensive to actually be able to play it.
3590255	3591196	You know, this isn't for me.
3591216	3593437	I'm going to return it and get my money back or something like that.
3593497	3597800	I don't see why they couldn't do that now, but I don't know.
3597880	3601342	It doesn't seem like a big deal, but they could easily do that.
3601483	3606266	I think that I am surprised that they don't open the marketplaces up because there's a lot of games I do want to purchase that...
3607086	3607986	Like Earth Defense Force.
3608326	3613347	If I could buy Earth Defense Force 4 without having to import that thing, hell yeah, I'd buy it digitally.
3613647	3614387	I would totally buy it.
3614948	3619648	I would have already bought it digitally, but I'm going to have to pay $70 to import that thing.
3619748	3626130	A lot of people in... Not necessarily a lot of people in chat, but a lot of people I know talking about this game from our chat room.
3626170	3630810	Brad from PodCulture says, This region deal just reminded me of something else I played this week.
3630910	3632271	Phantasy Star Online 2.
3633111	3633371	And yeah...
3634732	3637273	Just irritating that Sega will not put that game out here.
3637393	3640895	But maybe it has something to do with the free-to-play model and the Japan thing.
3641295	3643476	That's a whole other monkey wrench in the system.
3643496	3647859	What happens when you have the store built in or what have you?
3647879	3654743	Or maybe it's a game that they don't think they're going to make their money back on as fast over here and so they don't want to invest in local servers.
3655182	3655943	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
3677045	3679087	It's a big house, and it has perfect studio room.
3695980	3723666	you walked in on a story about Nintendo defending region locking so and now we're talking about the whole you know the fact that Xbox One and Sony won't do it but Nintendo is saying you know we're not doing this out of business ego we have to do it there's reasons behind it but I'm kind of like but your peers don't do it so I don't know anyway I think that Nintendo tries to do things their own way and by the way thank you thank you for congratulations I
3726423	3730529	There's, I know, reasons for doing it for controlling markets, at least.
3730609	3737138	And I know Nintendo tends, for as much as they like to innovate with the system, they like to stay traditional with the business model.
3737818	3740122	So it's sort of that same interesting...
3741463	3752358	It's actually something I've noticed with a lot of Japanese businesses, that they'll tend to innovate with the tech or with the product that's going out, but keep their business model and their business practices very conservative.
3752919	3756423	And if this has been business as usual for them, I don't see them straying from it.
3757864	3772262	I'm surprised that they kind of went back on the whole region-free stuff, because I remember the portable consoles from them used to be region-free up until the 3DS, and it's kind of weird that they went back on it.
3772282	3776587	I mean, I guess there was a lot of piracy in the DS, so maybe that was the reason they were trying to limit...
3777308	3777868	That, maybe?
3778049	3778489	I don't know.
3778529	3783212	Maybe it has to... You know, I'm thinking the whole, like, DLC and that stuff.
3783252	3785833	Like, I kind of think there's something there with that, too.
3785853	3789756	They're not... See, I would agree with you if they were full into DLC and, like, online.
3789776	3791597	Well, they're starting to move that way, though.
3791637	3794679	I mean, Super Luigi U is... How long has it taken them?
3794739	3795579	I mean, seriously.
3795599	3796240	But they're there.
3796820	3798501	The plans are being set in motion.
3798521	3799421	I wouldn't say they're there yet.
3799502	3800482	Well, they're coming.
3800842	3801423	All right, anyhow.
3802003	3804164	Give me downloadable tracks and Mario Kart 8 will talk.
3804845	3806206	Be careful what you wish for, young man.
3807066	3811229	I'm seriously, like, Mario Kart always sells me a console for Nintendo.
3811409	3818673	It's sad, but, like, I do like the idea of playing on a separate screen because, you know, my wife does hog the TV a lot.
3819454	3820474	I have my laptop, I guess.
3820694	3826578	Well, DarkSakura, I'm dying to talk to you about Atari Party and your gaming week, but we'll make the listeners wait a little bit.
3826598	3828559	We'll do that at the top of Part B tonight.
3828619	3829820	So we'll do that after the break tonight.
3830400	3832942	I can say, though, tons of fun.
3833182	3838246	We did do some reminiscing at the top of the show, even though I didn't go to Atari Party.
3838646	3840268	Well, you know what next week is, yes?
3840868	3846512	Yes, and I want to go so bad, but I can't because I've got Clue rehearsals and other stuff.
3846552	3847113	You know what?
3847213	3847433	What?
3847453	3848734	California Extreme is only once a year.
3849014	3850195	You can watch Clue anytime.
3850676	3853278	No, but the Clue performance is only once a year, ma'am.
3853618	3854899	My costume's sitting over there.
3855456	3856397	Okay, Colonel Mustard.
3857919	3858179	Anyhow.
3858299	3862843	Just don't let me find a wrench in your, you know... July 27th, Colonial Theater in Sacramento.
3862883	3863324	Yours truly.
3864125	3865266	On stage, on screen, Clue.
3865346	3867228	All right, let's move on with video game news.
3867888	3871512	DarkSakura was bringing a lot of indie game news tonight since she's still getting...
3872312	3873273	I'm totally getting this game.
3890166	3900451	used to coexist peacefully, but as the two races tore apart because of war, the monsters went underground and a child tumbles through a great hole and falls into a monster-filled domain.
3900711	3902172	Wasn't that the plot of Monsters, Inc. ?
3903346	3905728	Sort of, but I like the twist on this.
3905948	3907088	I like the twist on this one.
3907128	3907449	Kitty!
3909290	3911791	So yeah, Undertale is a game where no one gets hurt.
3913192	3919296	You could, it says the ability to take out enemies with a click still exists, but so do alternate options.
3919596	3922558	You can befriend a boss that you've encountered by talking to them.
3923318	3926040	Why not show your foes mercy and spare them?
3926060	3927641	I think that's kind of neat.
3927861	3928561	Something a little different.
3928802	3932624	Yeah, it gives you the opportunity to talk to them out of kicking your ass.
3934768	3941334	Let's see, the game is funding right now on Kickstarter, because you know a lot of these indie games are, and the funding ends on July 24th.
3941374	3943736	Windows PC and Mac, and it will be released in summer 2014.
3944673	3947476	This may take my Kickstarter virginity.
3947716	3948016	Oh, yeah?
3948517	3948737	Yeah.
3948957	3949778	You got into it, huh?
3950599	3959307	Yeah, it's such a neat concept, and I've really been getting more and more into the indie game scene, so I'm excited.
3959487	3960608	You missed my gaming week.
3960648	3964772	I've played a shit ton of indie stuff thanks to that fucking Steam trading card thing.
3964913	3965593	It's addicting.
3965633	3967395	Well, I played a shit ton of old stuff.
3967795	3969137	Have you played Binding of Isaac?
3969157	3969197	No.
3969697	3970077	I haven't.
3970097	3971098	That game is disturbing.
3971118	3977642	I started it and it was really like, the controls bizarre on it, so I was like, this looks like Zelda but bloody.
3978162	3980723	Yeah, well, it looks like Zelda but it doesn't play anything like it.
3980743	3981064	No, it doesn't.
3981124	3982625	It plays more like Rogue.
3982765	3983765	It really is Rogue.
3984706	3986347	It was alright, I started it.
3987427	3992810	I think I need to do like Operation Play My Steam games or something like that because I seriously have like 150 games that
3995672	3996173	and DarkSakura.com.
4011618	4013980	Yeah, not a whole lot this week, but there are some actual games.
4014280	4019184	Dark on Xbox 360, kind of a stealth vampire game that's okay, I guess.
4020805	4023687	That's coming from Calypso NCAA Football.
4024928	4029511	14 coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.
4030492	4038838	The Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection, which is pretty much all your Metal Gear games that you could possibly want.
4039778	4050202	on the PlayStation 3, including the original Metal Gear games in there as well.
4050242	4050802	So that's kind of cool.
4054263	4061066	And I want to say also this week, I think, was the expansion for Civilization V.
4062389	4063569	Woot, it is this week.
4064570	4067351	So yeah, so that'll be coming out as well.
4068231	4070832	I'm trying to think, did I forget anything else here?
4071112	4072792	Let's see.
4075713	4076993	Yeah, Brave New World was this week.
4077214	4077894	Okay, cool.
4079174	4083235	And I thought there was one other game.
4083275	4084276	I'm forgetting here.
4084496	4085056	What is it?
4087233	4087393	Nope.
4087874	4088334	Nope, that was it.
4088634	4088934	All right.
4089295	4093178	Then let's travel over to Japan and check out some of the releases over there on the PlayStation 3 this week.
4093958	4101364	On kind of an off-cycle day, July 10th, Nobunaga no Yabu Online, Tenka Mugen no Shu comes out in Treasure and regular editions.
4101444	4102765	I'm thinking that's an expansion.
4102805	4104947	I think Nobunaga no Yabu is already out there.
4105788	4108270	So I think this is an expansion version that's coming out from Koei.
4108970	4113474	Of course, the Nobunaga games have been huge in Japan for years, but they never really seem to catch on here the same way.
4114354	4142891	but coming out on July 11th Battlefield 3 gets a price reduction Dead Island Riptide gets its Japanese release Metal Gear Solid the Legacy Collection will be there as well and something called a PlayStation 3 HDD recorder pack in 250 gig I think that's oh yeah they have the whole like TVO thing built into the PS3s in some places over there so we don't really have that so much here so you have that to look forward to if you need a 250 gig drive for all your TV recording in Japan
4143611	4161842	otherwise on the Xbox 360 this week Dead Island Riptide also gets its release there and Battlefield 3 a price reduction Monster Hunter Frontier G2 also gets a premium package that again is on the Xbox 360 on the PlayStation Vita this week not a lot unless you need some new headphones because that's a peripheral that's out this week
4162762	4191682	on the Wii U July 13th we'll see the release of New Super Luigi U as well as Pikmin 3 kind of bam bam getting hit with two games there there's a new Wii U premium set 32 gig in white also to look forward to on that day so kind of another little I'm sure there'll be a lot of promotion almost like a soft relaunch of the Wii U with some of those games behind it on the 3DS not a lot but there is Yukai Watch
4193003	4195064	Which is, I'm trying to see what this game is.
4195284	4196766	Is it Yookai or Yolkai?
4196866	4197706	I think it's Yolkai.
4198147	4200448	Yolkai, that means monster or demon watch.
4200508	4203711	It definitely is some type of little kitty demon thing.
4205299	4206300	I wonder if that's based on anime.
4207320	4208001	It's an RPG.
4208201	4208962	Yeah, yokai.
4210142	4210403	All right.
4211904	4215246	And let me look at the PSP because there's still games that come out there occasionally.
4217107	4218929	Yes, actually, there are quite a few things this week.
4219429	4221490	Samurai Do Portable gets a price reduction.
4222411	4232378	As far as new games go, there is Hanayakakana Warega Ichizoku Saogare Polar Star in regular and limited edition.
4232478	4234960	And there's even a whole little set you can get with this
4235120	4238184	Star Wars Pinball, Wii U, Tiny Thief, Dynasty Warriors 8
4256104	4256444	That's all.
4256724	4256944	All right.
4256964	4258445	Just a few more stories for you guys.
4258505	4261546	And yes, she got here in time to do the classic game of the week.
4261866	4267448	I sped past a CHP guy and he didn't even bat an eye.
4268409	4269809	He's like, go on, girl.
4270089	4270550	You go.
4270750	4273651	We would have rolled it over till she got here if we had to.
4273751	4275992	But we do have a couple more stories now that we're back on track.
4276052	4276292	Loki.
4277032	4283219	Sorry, we'll just put Saints Row in there as a classic movie.
4283479	4285741	I did play a lot of Commodore 64 games this week, too.
4286702	4290546	Rob, they had all kinds of Atari computers, and I played R-Type.
4290847	4291147	Did you?
4291347	4291547	Yeah.
4291567	4292628	I didn't even know that was on Atari.
4292688	4294691	And it sucks on the joystick, just saying.
4294751	4296593	Save it for the next half of the show, Loki.
4297693	4301454	So now there's another new feature coming to Steam, and that is Twitch integration.
4301514	4305835	You can actually link your Twitch account with your Steam account.
4306116	4308616	And, of course, what's the first thing that's going to make use of it?
4309236	4309576	Dota 2!
4310777	4311677	Yay!
4312037	4320700	You'll be able to, I guess, watch Dota tournaments in-game or via, I guess, Twitch.
4320720	4324481	I don't know if they're going to have a specific app or something as part of the Steam store.
4324501	4325721	I don't know.
4326041	4326281	Moba Moga
4342881	4366336	so uh yeah i uh i haven't really gotten into those hardcore but uh it doesn't sound like you can stream through this twitch integration like origin supposedly lets you do although it never worked for me uh yeah you can't stream but you can actually um i guess watch it and they said also that you can um or was it you can get like a
4368087	4371909	Oh, actually, they're launching this August 7th, so it's not something you can do yet.
4372609	4376270	But I don't know if they're going to have... That's why I haven't seen ads for it.
4376290	4376951	That makes sense now.
4377251	4386795	Yes, I guess now... I guess you can receive special items if you watch certain tournaments or something like that.
4386875	4390436	So they're going to have... How much do you want to bet on Steam training cards?
4391897	4392757	How much do you want to bet?
4393637	4394478	Twitch, Twitch, Twitch.
4394558	4395678	And I'm not talking about the website.
4395698	4397139	That is actually my head twitching.
4401336	4403480	Hey Bobby, you know what VOG needs?
4404542	4407687	Trading cards Oh god, don't give them ideas
4410692	4411732	VOG Trading Cards.
4411812	4412472	You could trade the loot.
4412492	4414053	That would be fun to make.
4414173	4415913	You could maybe trade the loot or something.
4416073	4417593	I could totally make trading cards.
4417754	4418774	Oh boy, here we go.
4419254	4420254	If you pay me for it.
4420874	4423235	You know who does some pretty interesting cards?
4423255	4424195	I'll pay you in Pinkberry.
4425115	4426395	Ooh, I could deal with that.
4426435	4427295	Wrestle, you know.
4428136	4429096	Oh yeah, he does his little magic.
4429136	4434117	You know, I've got like four magic cards from him and one of them was from when Shermie was alive and it was Geek Cat.
4434857	4436137	So Shermie is a magic card.
4436597	4436717	Aw.
4437078	4437958	Yeah, she's a legend.
4438638	4438958	That's fun.
4439418	4443479	All right, one more story for you guys, and it's about the Double Fine Project Broken Age.
4443539	4447160	This is probably the first Kickstarter project most of us heard about it.
4447900	4451441	And yeah, Broken Age apparently needs a little more money.
4451661	4452441	Well, here's the thing.
4452481	4454082	I've heard two sides to this story.
4454762	4455802	So I'm going to read this.
4455982	4462504	As it was reported on Joystick here, it says, they need more capital than the $3.3 million that it crowdfunded in March of 2012.
4463646	4464626	through Kickstarter.
4464886	4475330	And there's a backers only update that says, quote, even though we received much more money from our Kickstarter than we or anybody anticipated, that didn't stop me from getting excited and designing a game so big that it would need even more money.
4475791	4486895	So Double Fine will release the, I guess, a refined version of the first half of the game in January of 2014 when the income through early access should give production for the rest of the game.
4487555	4502545	Now, I saw this somewhere, I don't know if it was Twitter or Tumblr or both, that people might be misconstruing this a bit, and that they're not trying to raise the money for this project, but they're putting it out there early so they can raise the capital to do other projects.
4503126	4505067	So the media might be jumping...
4506428	4514573	like crossing lines a little bit here saying, oh, Kickstarter screwed up and nobody knows what the fuck they're doing on that site.
4514593	4523938	I think they're just a little suspicious because, you know, first they did this and they raised so much money and, you know, it should be enough.
4523958	4528480	But of course, you know, you adjust your budget for your game when you get a ton of extra revenue and stuff.
4528801	4531242	And that's why they have those stretch goals and stuff like that.
4531902	4543629	and then of course there's the Massive Chalice game that's also being done by them that also just got kickstarted that they're getting funding for already for a game that they haven't even finished the first one.
4544289	4546530	I mean, I understand they have multiple teams working over there.
4547311	4556896	And now they're trying to raise more funding for what originally seemed like this original game but it may be for a future project.
4556916	4557657	So it's kind of like...
4558497	4564244	You guys are asking for a lot of money from us for different things and yet you still haven't been able to deliver on anything yet.
4564384	4565966	And I think that's kind of where the suspicion is.
4566246	4566807	But you know what?
4566867	4569570	That's unlike a lot of the Kickstarter projects.
4569630	4570451	Even with the Ouya and stuff.
4570471	4572553	If you raise all this money, why couldn't you deliver them on time?
4572573	4573634	Well, it's because you use DHL.
4573734	4576457	All the money in the world is not going to make DHL good.
4576477	4577699	I mean, seriously.
4579981	4583265	Well, all the money in the world could maybe get FedEx to buy them.
4583285	4585228	At least it didn't ship them Old Dominion.
4585548	4586749	It wouldn't be here yet.
4586810	4590314	It'd be on a freaking turtle in the middle of the ocean, okay?
4591435	4597723	All right, let's travel back to a time that was a lot more simpler than this.
4598123	4598523	DarkSakura.com
4620885	4621165	DarkSakura
4636522	4637143	Millipede!
4638044	4639745	Not Centipede, Millipede.
4641026	4650295	And it was also known as Millipede Revenge of the Giant Instinct, uh, Insects, why do I say Instincts?
4651656	4653778	And that was its Famicom release.
4654159	4656021	It came out in 1982 by Atari!
4656461	4657982	It is the sequel to Centipede.
4658903	4663844	and basically you have to score as many points as possible by destroying all the segments of a millipede as it moves down on the screen.
4664444	4666925	When you destroy a section, it becomes a mushroom.
4667825	4672346	And, um... You use a trackball to play it, so you don't even need a joystick.
4672366	4673927	This is old school, and guess what?
4674447	4678188	The reason why I brought this up is because we actually had a prototype cartridge of it for the Atari 5200.
4679148	4684349	So, when I bring up lists, I will tell you, if you have an Atari 5200, I will tell you how to get it.
4684669	4685210	Atari age.
4685410	4685990	They're great people.
4686230	4686450	Anyway...
4687310	4700657	So basically, the big differences between millipede and centipede, and keep in mind, I like millipede better than centipede, is that the earwig is the same as the scorpion and centipede, so it makes poisonous mushrooms, and it makes the millipede charge right towards the bottom.
4701358	4708121	The bee basically does the same thing as the centipede, it drops mushrooms on a vertical line, and takes two shots to kill.
4708161	4712444	The spider bounces all over the screen, but you can get multiple spiders, you have an inchworm,
4713425	4717168	and when it hits it slows all the enemies on the screen for a short period of time.
4718009	4725476	You have the beetle that crawls around the player area and then goes into the leaves and it turns any mushroom it touches into indestructible flowers.
4726457	4728999	And when it hits everything on the screen scrolls down one row.
4729539	4732943	The dragonfly drops mushrooms while zigzagging and it can be destroyed with one shot.
4733403	4738568	The mosquito bounces off the sides and when you hit it it scrolls the screen up one row.
4739108	4740289	DDT Bomb DDT Bomb
4770389	4794004	and you have new mushrooms growing on the field when others go and it's just really awesome it's basically just scrolling and shooting as fast as possible and to me this was harder than Centipede and a lot more challenging it just moved a lot faster it was so much fun and it has Centipede and Millipede both have like this the best one-up sound which I can't do because I have no voice
4794904	4801408	As far as releases, it came out on the Atari 8-bit and ST computer line and the Atari 2600.
4802288	4806071	There was a NES version published in 1985.
4806291	4809353	It came out with Centipede on the Game Boy as Arcade Classics No.
4809373	4810213	2, Centipede Millipede.
4810954	4814756	It was released with Centipede on Xbox 360 on Xbox Live Arcade.
4815836	4825100	and it was going to be... The Atari 2600 port was going to be a launch title for the Xbox 360 and the Games for Windows Live game room thing.
4825861	4828422	It was on the game room on May 26, 2010.
4829102	4833744	Now, like I was saying, there are various prototype carts out there.
4833864	4840507	We have a version for Atari 5200 and I believe it might have been a re...
4843229	4845631	You know, I was not a fan of this on the Xbox 360 arcade.
4845691	4847372	And you know why?
4847412	4847792	No trackball.
4847852	4848773	No trackball.
4848893	4849073	Yeah.
4849093	4850594	You cannot play this game without a trackball.
4850614	4851255	Trackball or get out.
4864878	4865858	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4886468	4887788	Tempest worked well with trackball.
4887808	4891130	And if a mouse is on the right settings, that's like the closest you get.
4891150	4892750	But it just doesn't work.
4893530	4895631	But then again, Tempest 2000 was pretty kickass.
4895931	4902653	Well, I'm going to go ahead and say, as I said earlier, that for anybody who happens to have an Atari 5200, go to Atari Age.
4902713	4903974	You can buy the copy.
4904014	4905014	I think that we paid like...
4905394	4930142	We also did get a copy of Tempest for the Atari 5200, and I'll tell you, they're great people, they make really quality products, they come in, I believe it's refurbished cartridges, repurposed cartridges, and it's just, they're great people, so if you've got the 5200, definitely get their release of Millipede.
4931322	4942227	as far as high scores by the way there was a high score set by Donald Hayes in New Hampshire of 10,627,331 points that was in 1994 and then the highest score in tournament play was also set by him at almost 7 million points
4950670	4955534	The default high scores in the arcade are actually FXL and ED.
4956235	4963401	ED is for Ed Log, who was the designer and programmer, and Franz Lasinger was also a designer and tester.
4964322	4971087	And it was the only way that they could get their credits in the game, because at the time Atari didn't allow them to put their credits in.
4972468	4973289	And that is your trivia.
4974310	4975731	That is Classic Game as Millipede.
4976258	4978740	Alright, Millipede is the classic game of the week.
4979400	4983062	A very fitting choice considering some of the shenanigans you've been up to this week.
4983423	4986164	And I'm sure we'll get something out of California Extreme next week.
4986504	4987865	Have you ever done the Journey video game?
4987905	4988486	It might be time.
4989186	4989586	I have.
4989766	4994389	Well, no, not the Journey video game, but I mean, I've played it a bunch of times and then I screamed and cried a little bit and felt sick.
4994850	4995850	Alright.
4996050	5002294	And SSJ100, Matt, just hold on because the Atari 800 is there's mentions of it coming up next part.
5002834	5003195	Alright.
5003895	5007397	As far as what systems I don't have, I do not have a Fairchild Channel left, just saying.
5008277	5010659	If somebody's looking to buy DarkSakura systems.
5010919	5013240	Or the first Magnavox Odyssey, but I do have an Odyssey 2.
5013280	5014621	Do you have a Virtual Boy?
5015103	5015663	Yes, I do.
5015783	5016443	Wow, I didn't know that.
5016463	5022285	I have a Virtual Boy that came in the foam case because Dan bought it from Blockbuster.
5022305	5023525	I want to come over and get a headache.
5024105	5024485	Sure.
5025706	5027146	Maybe we'll have a great big headache party.
5027166	5031467	I'll play my 3DS on 3D, and you can play the Virtual Boy, and then we'll both be in pain.
5031807	5033528	And then we'll spin around until we barf.
5033808	5034248	Yay!
5035208	5039809	Don't they have an Oculus Rift emulator or something like that that has Virtual Boy?
5040029	5041910	That wouldn't surprise me at all, actually.
5041930	5042010	Yeah.
5042170	5045432	This Oculus Rift thing is going to be interesting when it's at a consumer level, you know?
5045572	5046732	Rob, coffee.
5048833	5050014	What do I look like, Dan?
5050974	5052295	Alright, anyhow.
5052315	5053155	Um, no.
5055253	5057575	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5080246	5083991	and we like your emails and we like to do some FUs of the week and we like to take your phone calls.
5084151	5088437	All that when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5096158	5096798	Hi there!
5097559	5104423	This is Redertainment, and you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
5105224	5111068	And I want to use my voice to tell you that Garrus ain't got nothing on Samantha Trainor.
5112935	5120120	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, July the 7th of 2013.
5120801	5126545	And we are back, episode 511 of our show with all of you, live.vognetwork.com.
5126785	5128327	And DarkSakura, she's here now.
5128627	5129347	And I have coffee.
5130228	5132690	After running a variety of errands and so forth.
5133991	5135252	I'm giddy still, I'm giddy.
5135812	5138134	I'm showing off the pictures of the house like it's a cat.
5138334	5140556	Well, just be careful.
5140656	5141476	Get the keys first.
5141716	5142337	I know, I know.
5143057	5146140	I don't need depressed Sakura should anything go wrong next week.
5146360	5148601	I am just saying that we're in a good position.
5148742	5148922	Yeah.
5149122	5154486	We're in a good position, and it would take us about 30 to 45 days to get in the house, assuming everything goes fluidly.
5154766	5155686	Well, good luck.
5156367	5159990	We're all crossing our fingers and toes, but I don't want to see you pissed off.
5160590	5161871	But I have to fix the air conditioner first.
5162931	5168474	I gotta say though that a new house doesn't exactly make for as exciting swap note pictures as a cat.
5169715	5170155	That's true.
5170175	5178919	I can put little doki doki symbols on the house and make it blush or I can make it demonic like the house from Poltergeist or something.
5179179	5181821	Alright, well let's talk about Atari Party.
5181961	5187904	Since I've been telling the listeners you went to this and I'm sure our retro gaming fans can appreciate the fun of Atari Party.
5187944	5190845	So tell us a little bit about what it is and what you experienced when you went to it.
5191607	5197534	Atari Party, and basically this has happened, I think, every year for the last, I want to say six years or so.
5198034	5199636	And also you can look on Facebook.
5199656	5201619	The Atari Party folks have a page.
5202960	5206304	But it's, this guy put everything together.
5206464	5208146	He brings a lot of his own stuff together.
5208686	5237537	and volunteers can bring their own systems we had just all kinds of things across the board like we were the only ones there with a 5200 but we brought two of them and then someone had an Atari flashback set up there was a Jaguar set up on the big screen so there was some Tempest and some Dragon's Lair going on we were going to set up Alien vs. Predator in the little conference room to the side but people ended up bringing their food in there
5239217	5242318	There were definitely Atari 800s.
5242518	5243598	That was the computer.
5244138	5245939	There were STs.
5246059	5248360	There was a couple of Linksys set up.
5249380	5253461	In fact, I believe that every Atari computer had a representation there.
5254741	5258502	And let me look through my photos because I took pictures of a lot of the systems.
5259042	5261923	In fact, one thing that really impressed me is that someone brought in an Atari touchpad.
5262803	5263083	There were 7200s.
5263103	5263343	There were...
5266665	5267833	Just all kinds of stuff.
5268095	5268659	So why?
5270982	5272063	Why Atari Party?
5272943	5274244	Because people love Atari.
5274384	5274824	Why not?
5275164	5275665	It's fun.
5276705	5278146	People need to remember their roots.
5278286	5279607	I was kind of hoping the answer would be that.
5279647	5280327	Why the hell not?
5281087	5282448	When's Commodore Party?
5282508	5283929	Am I invited to Commodore Party?
5283949	5285670	You can start Commodore Party.
5285950	5298236	It was funny because this was at one of the Davis Public Libraries over by the library over by this park that Atari Party used to be at.
5298547	5310519	The People's Republic of Davis, Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Exactly Abandon Hope of having your car not pooped on Tiger Claw on chat says Do they have some Atari arcade games too?
5312189	5337329	Um, there was a guy there who I think he came from, he came from out of state, I know that, but he hooked up an emulator that had different emulated games, like he even had like any game that had been on an Atari system, he had the arcade versions of plus the regular Atari, various Atari versions.
5337645	5340066	I didn't realize that people came out of state for this.
5340126	5341426	I thought it was kind of a locals thing.
5341466	5349970	A lot of people were more like just from out of, uh, like our friends, uh, Tim and his girlfriend, uh, came from, uh, the Bay Area.
5350950	5351330	Oh, okay.
5351370	5354031	Like Reno is, you know, out of state, but it's not that far.
5354251	5354492	Yeah.
5354532	5356512	No, this guy I think came from a couple of states over.
5356712	5357933	So I didn't ask him.
5358173	5358213	Um,
5359972	5362073	To be honest, my sign language isn't that great.
5362173	5363054	I didn't mention he's deaf.
5364074	5367316	But he was using his iPad as a communication tool.
5367856	5372138	And I am way out of practice with my ASL, so yeah.
5373699	5378121	But we, funny, Ragenator asked, do two Atari 5200s equal an Atari 10400?
5378201	5379321	No, because they don't do that.
5384222	5391466	One of the pictures I got of a really good version of Pac-Man was played on an Atari 1200XL.
5392567	5394688	There were several different Atari computers there.
5394708	5397449	Like I said earlier, there was one that was running R-Type.
5398089	5399470	Another one running Ghost and Gollum.
5399490	5404212	Just the thing is that while they make the games look pretty, they don't sound too fantastic.
5404592	5405713	And the control was shit.
5406113	5407314	It's just really hard to play...
5407954	5414182	either of those games on a keyboard or with an analog joystick that just keeps wanting to recenter itself.
5416464	5418767	I'm looking at the chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
5418907	5426456	SSJ100Matt says, I saw Dan's pictures on Facebook and I thought it was really cool to see kids playing systems that were twice their age.
5426636	5428297	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5448183	5454008	You know, I just chatted with a lot of folks and we all had the same love of old, stinky systems.
5454988	5459232	And there were a lot of people like, oh my god, you have a 5200, rah, rah, rah.
5459352	5463216	And I was like, dude, you have a working 7800 with the worst joysticks ever.
5467239	5467579	Oh my god.
5467659	5471321	Now, the Atari 5200, the joysticks were notorious for breaking.
5471741	5476303	We had some good replacements and Dan made a dedicated button pad to work with it.
5476984	5482006	But because we had that trackball, a lot of people... You should see people trying to play Dig Dug with trackball.
5482066	5482686	It's hilarious.
5484107	5488709	But Dan was saying that he noticed a lot of girls were sitting down and wanting to play Q-Bert.
5489509	5490710	He was saying it was like...
5495297	5496318	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5515153	5516915	Oh yeah, Kix was a fun game.
5516955	5518837	I sat and played like a crap ton of Kix.
5518877	5520799	I got like three split Kix's in a row.
5520879	5523682	Kix was basically the inspiration for Miss Nude World 96.
5523782	5525584	Yes it was, but it was better.
5526826	5528327	No it didn't, it didn't have techno music.
5529068	5529849	Or boobies.
5530069	5535095	Ragenator in chat says, I gotta ask, did anyone bring the 2600 version of Pac-Man or even E.T. ?
5535931	5537172	Yes, several people did.
5537292	5539134	And I played 2600 Pac-Man.
5539154	5541196	I actually made it pretty far on 2600 Pac-Man.
5541897	5543358	We did have people bringing E.T.
5543819	5550665	And I actually sat next to some guy and I was like, you do realize that this is like a prime example of gamer masochism, right?
5551046	5552067	He's like, yeah.
5552167	5553748	I was like, so you're just into that kind of thing.
5553788	5554029	He's like,
5554449	5554870	Yeah.
5555331	5560378	And then we started... Remember that story we brought up, though, where the town in Arizona was willing to let the dump be excavated?
5560538	5560799	Mm-hmm.
5561239	5568771	Well, a couple people hadn't heard that, so we were talking about it, and they're like, well, we get to find out if it's... Ugh, fuck.
5570854	5572315	Rob, that hurts my soul.
5572675	5573716	I love that game.
5575077	5577038	This is some iconic noise, though.
5577178	5578419	Like, it's funny.
5578979	5582701	But keep in mind, this is the best they did with what they had.
5582921	5583302	Oh, yeah.
5583402	5589946	No, if you read the stories about how these games had to be programmed, like, with such a short turnaround, and the coding in these games is so tight.
5590306	5594008	Like, you actually... You have no room for bonuses.
5594068	5595409	It's kind of impressive.
5596002	5615698	I think the guy that programmed Jungle Hunt has some weird easter egg in that where if you get a certain score at a certain time and do a silly dance and then interpretive music then maybe a prayer to Satan or something then you can see his initials pop up for five seconds.
5616932	5617573	Now the E.T.
5617593	5619454	game, do you know the history of why the E.T.
5619474	5620054	game is this bad?
5642851	5650118	and then people realized how bad it was and that's where that urban legend of there being just that dump full of E.T.
5650158	5654903	cartridges I want to see a 48 hour game jam to make new E.T.
5654943	5659867	games you know I remember a story we covered on the show not that long ago where somebody actually like fixed E.T.
5659947	5666654	I'm using my quotey fingers yeah where like they went back and made the collision detection not so crazy and just made the game better basically
5667028	5672692	Well, I mean, the equivalent of doing this in three weeks was like me doing my final exam in one day for my web design class.
5673093	5674734	Yeah, my site looks pretty good, but could have been better.
5674914	5675214	Yeah.
5676475	5677576	It could have actually worked, too.
5679157	5679638	But, um...
5681597	5682638	Well, actually, I did three days.
5682878	5684099	Got my web design stuff done.
5684340	5690044	But anyway, going back to what was there, there was a really good representation.
5690164	5692266	And not just Atari systems, too.
5692727	5695229	There were people who brought in Atari collections.
5695269	5698712	Like I said, there was an Atari flashback.
5699152	5704316	But someone also brought in Nintendo with the Atari games that were released for Nintendo.
5705357	5706018	and NES.
5706358	5711841	And there was a PlayStation with one of the, sorry, a PS2 with one of the collections on it.
5712442	5720847	Someone had two Game Boy SPs with various Atari collection packs on it.
5720867	5722228	And like I said, we had Lynxes.
5722848	5725010	We had various computer setups.
5725030	5728312	There were actually a lot more computer setups than console setups, I noticed.
5728972	5732855	And then there was a raffle and some jerk face ran off with one of the books for the raffle.
5732875	5733315	Yeah.
5733695	5735436	So someone had to go without a prize.
5735596	5739337	Oh no, like legit, oh I thought you were saying that like, oh he won what I wanted.
5739357	5741097	It was like a book about Atari stuff.
5741157	5742798	No, some guy legit stole it.
5743118	5743618	Asshole.
5744278	5750120	Yeah, the guy who ran it, Bill, and Bill is just, he's so great for, he had the best shirt too.
5750180	5755801	He had one of the ghost monsters being chased by the Ecto-1, all in pixels, you know, from Ghostbusters.
5756061	5756601	It was really cute.
5757202	5758182	And his kids were there and...
5758962	5764367	There were lots of, I would probably say, pre-teen and up-aged kids.
5764967	5766849	Just going around and having a good time.
5768310	5769131	Getting to see these things.
5769251	5772975	Oh, and I've actually heard flat out, I've never seen this game before.
5773035	5773815	This is fun.
5774776	5781006	Just goes to show that you don't have to have the shiniest graphics to make a really good game.
5781727	5789599	Dan, we had to stay relatively near his stuff because we had so many 5200 games that we brought with us in the protos.
5791641	5796024	But we had a few rounds of Super Pac-Man going on.
5796685	5802109	And if anyone wants to look a few days back, well, actually just yesterday's stuff on my Tumblr.
5802169	5804891	My Tumblr is Kuro Tsubasa.
5805271	5808154	It's K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A.
5808614	5810435	I have some of my photos from Atari Party.
5810475	5819602	And if you're on Facebook and have friended me, I did put up a thing, but I will go to my fan page and share the photos there so that people can see the photos from Atari Party.
5819822	5820023	Cool.
5820923	5822045	I had a really good time.
5822225	5822846	It was just fun.
5822906	5827151	And the guys bought us sodas and I didn't drink any because they're regular Coke.
5827671	5830675	So more classic gaming next week with California Extreme.
5830975	5834580	Yeah, I didn't know that California Extreme was next week and Dan's like, so you're going to California Extreme with me?
5835260	5835981	I guess so.
5836181	5837143	Are you going to be back for the show?
5837943	5838324	Saturday.
5838948	5840648	Oh, yeah, well, it runs all weekend long.
5840688	5842609	But we're not going through the whole thing because money.
5842909	5843249	Sure, sure.
5843909	5844129	Okay.
5845189	5850770	Well, I want to move on with the show, get into rapid-fire news, but I did want to ask about your gaming week outside of Atari Party.
5850790	5852991	Have you played anything this week besides Atari?
5853011	5853991	Besides Atari games?
5854551	5859032	Well, I wanted to play Final Fantasy XIV this weekend because I wanted to start my Scholar.
5860152	5860872	You can't.
5861172	5862293	Arcana still isn't in the beta.
5862773	5863133	Ah, fuck!
5863153	5864593	You wouldn't have been able to anyway.
5865103	5866244	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5893061	5895726	I have fruit everywhere.
5895746	5896928	Beatles, nothing but Beatles.
5897208	5898610	And I have a cross-dressing dog.
5899732	5899973	Awesome.
5900153	5900654	Named Butch.
5901696	5902237	That's awesome.
5902537	5903779	Yes, I want Dina back though.
5903799	5904641	Dina was my lady.
5905161	5906524	Actually, no, I want the gay unicorn.
5907513	5912817	There's a gay unicorn named Julian and I said, Becky, that's not named after your son.
5913117	5914878	He's just a gay unicorn.
5914938	5916499	We know your little boy likes girls.
5918040	5919841	But if he didn't, we'd still love him anyway.
5920201	5922523	Which makes me want him in my village so I can be his hag.
5924264	5927166	I would totally be his hag and I would put up pride signs outside of his house.
5928227	5929467	We'd have a parade just for him.
5930248	5930848	You and Dina.
5931589	5932469	Julian and Dina.
5933350	5933750	You go.
5934571	5936592	Do you think there's fanfic out there that ships those two?
5937609	5939591	Rob, this is the internet.
5940652	5943795	There's fanfics that ship everybody and everything.
5944095	5947859	There are fanfics that would take two blades of grass in a Star Trek movie and ship them.
5948880	5953885	I want to find some really dirty Animal Crossing fanfic and have some read on the show.
5955186	5958409	Tumblr has created its own phenomenon and that is shipping fandoms.
5959611	5961893	Creating avatars for fandoms and shipping them.
5963898	5964938	Welcome to the internet.
5965139	5966179	Everything is shippable.
5967839	5969160	Rob's looking it up too.
5969560	5970961	You're so disgusting, Rob.
5972821	5975062	Maybe I'll have something for you guys after Rapid Fire News.
5975262	5980364	And Chickers, I was going to be playing Ragnarok Online 2, but I gave it up for Final Fantasy XIV.
5981864	5987626	I did get a little bit of time on Drunken Robot Pornography, which is a great game.
5988106	5989107	I'd recommend everyone get it.
5989547	5992368	And I have to thank Gamer Girl, because she got me Jet Set Radio.
5994662	6011231	I love that game, but I have to do some rewiring with my various USB cables so that my hub will work again and I can plug in my Xbox controller to use on... Trigger's just shipped his pants.
6013777	6015659	I ship my pants with my shirt.
6017040	6018822	But the shirt has to be on top.
6019202	6020563	Alright, we gotta move on with the show.
6022125	6026949	Thank you for the classic gaming take back though and you'll bring us more of it next week.
6027350	6029552	Meanwhile, rapid fire news about new games.
6029712	6030713	Loki, starting us off.
6031980	6042283	So Grand Theft Auto V is going to require an install on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, which is not surprising on Xbox 360 because it's such a large game.
6042323	6043164	It is on two discs.
6043184	6050286	The first disc will allow you to install the game, and then the second disc will be the one that you actually play with.
6050326	6059009	So it creates an install partition for the game, and then you just play it from there on, which makes sense because the world is so fucking huge.
6059609	6063252	The PS3, of course, is one disc because it's Blu-ray.
6063272	6064313	You can store more shit on there.
6065134	6075183	So you're going to need 8GB of free space in order to install the first disc section or the section of the game on PlayStation 3.
6075743	6077244	I'm excited, still can't wait to play it.
6078624	6079365	And I'm not surprised.
6081206	6093011	And now, of course, you know, kind of the way they've gotten around things in Australia, being unrated or not, you know, I guess being barred because they can't get it rated.
6093111	6096293	Even though they have an R18 plus rating, makes no sense.
6096673	6105556	There is a low violence version that's being made for Australia for Saints Row 4 and that's been spotted on Steam.
6105736	6108657	So I guess that's how they're going to get around it.
6109437	6111418	And remember, it's not the end of the world.
6111438	6112258	There's always mods.
6112338	6117700	You better believe that somebody in Australia is going to find a way around that shit to patch the game back to the way it should be.
6118320	6120963	So, just, you know, not a big deal.
6121083	6125767	And speaking about patching, Fez is getting patched on Xbox Live Arcade.
6126167	6141201	Phil Fish said, basically, that, you know, now that the updates don't cost anything, he's going to spend a few months, I guess, to put an update together to fix the problems that were, I guess, affecting about 1% of the players before.
6141341	6141542	So...
6144441	6147586	or fix the problems that were in the first patch that they had to recall.
6147686	6149789	So that's good news, I guess.
6150590	6156740	And of course, as a reminder, Fest 2 is not in development for the Xbox One or Xbox 360 because he's still pissed.
6159696	6163318	Sorry, I'm laughing over here because I'm finding some Animal Crossing fanfic to read.
6163998	6168620	And this one isn't dirty, but it's about a relationship between Monique and Rosie.
6170000	6176343	And my favorite is that they actually incorporated how Monique always says into the story.
6178924	6183526	And they're fighting over a letter and Monique shrugged her shoulders then shook her head once more.
6183906	6185527	Then you won't mind if I read this then.
6185587	6185947	Pfft.
6191484	6192604	I know what I'm doing after the show.
6192724	6197946	Alright, moving on to some other rapid fire news.
6198146	6201927	Xbox Ones Connect will be able to read QR codes.
6202107	6206269	This will be handy because that way you don't have to input those long download codes.
6206709	6210650	This was confirmed by Xbox Chief Product Officer Mark Whitman on Twitter.
6211410	6214812	So yeah, that's kind of neat that you won't have to input those long download codes.
6215032	6221134	Hopefully you don't have to scratch off all that crap, though, because if some of that gets left behind, then it's going to screw up the QR code.
6221174	6222555	So they'll find a way around that, I guess.
6223615	6224836	A little bit of Final Fantasy news.
6225696	6232058	Lightning Returns, of course, is coming out early next year and invoking a little bit of the Final Fantasy VII wank.
6232159	6232879	I know.
6233479	6236700	Cloud-based pre-order bonuses, and I'm not talking about in the cloud.
6236780	6237941	There's already wank going on.
6238001	6240722	You can actually dress her up as cloud, which is kind of neat.
6240882	6244248	There's the wink going on about the outfit being over-sexualized.
6244368	6244829	No, it's not.
6244889	6246292	It looks exactly like on Cloud.
6246312	6246933	She just has boobs.
6247616	6249217	You can pre-order this.
6249278	6250378	It's a pre-order bonus.
6250418	6251259	That's what this is for.
6252120	6253981	This is currently listed at Amazon.
6254621	6260666	Don't know if it's exclusive to Amazon or what yet, but we'll find out a little closer to February 11th when the game is set to come out.
6261406	6275737	By the way, I should state, it wasn't in this particular story, but there was also news coming out of Final Fantasy XIV that there's going to be, for the lady characters, you will be able to dress your character similar to Lightning, and guy characters can dress their characters similar to Snow, which I think is kind of interesting.
6276577	6278998	and a lot of people are like, but are they going to be a hero?
6279298	6280819	Get your 13 out of my 14.
6280919	6282720	Are they going to be a hero?
6283901	6285582	Everybody on the internet sounds like Monique.
6285682	6286702	Get your 13 out of my 14.
6288503	6291504	But there's a lot of Final Fantasy throwbacks.
6291544	6295366	Like the quest I was stuck on, I had to kill a Magitek armor, okay?
6296087	6296967	Get your six out of my 14.
6297047	6298388	No, actually you can stay.
6299528	6305834	Uh, anyhow, also, speaking of Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VII, I'm sure a lot of you heard, now available on Steam for $11.99.
6306555	6310998	Now, this game's been out, you know, forever, but now it works on Windows 7.
6311058	6321427	Well, actually, they released the version that works on Windows 7 last year, but it's through Steam, and because it's with Steam, it has cloud saves and Steam achievements.
6322608	6323249	I'm tempted.
6323289	6324150	I'm sorely tempted.
6325171	6328794	Well, you need to create a new save file where you know who does.
6329455	6330736	I know!
6330796	6334339	It's like you can't carry your PlayStation 1 file over, so you need something to kill her again.
6334359	6336662	I can't carry over my last PC save either, huh?
6336682	6338683	I don't know if that'll work.
6339724	6358797	Uh, if, uh, DarkSakura is able to get, uh, Julian and Dina to get married or, or, excuse me, to celebrate their pride in Animal Crossing, um, maybe she can convince Microsoft to loan a Halo Warthog decorated in rainbow colors because this was featured in the Seattle Pride Parade on Sunday, June 30th.
6360157	6386590	The Halo vehicle Of course, Microsoft's up there in the Seattle area A decorated warthog in rainbow colors Escorted by a Spartan soldier And supporters of LGBT equality Were there at the Pride Parade in Seattle Pretty cool I like to see game companies get involved in that I know EA usually does the one here in San Francisco Very, very cool DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
6387931	6388691	I have some stuff
6390147	6394012	Well, Natural Selection 2 is going to add female marines.
6394313	6399159	And the thing that really makes me happy about this is that they're actually in a legit uniform.
6399519	6404666	I mean, they're not made to have boob-shaped armor or anything like that.
6405667	6425966	uh basically they had to take the time to do research concept art doing the textures and models animation and then making sure that the game would sell before they could actually incorporate the female marine so they have that coming out and let me see if I've got a date on it uh it just says in late summer
6427398	6439244	In other news, Battlefield 3 Free is going to be free on PlayStation Plus this week.
6439924	6441305	Go get it!
6442025	6448188	Other free games include Jet Set Radio, Metal Slug XX, Dokoro, and Oddworld Munch's Odyssey HD.
6449088	6455380	Sadly, I actually checked to see, I don't know if they stagger when they upload those different games, but I only saw Battlefield 3.
6455700	6458044	I didn't see any, because I wanted Jet Set Radio.
6459387	6460088	Jet Set Radio?
6460902	6490011	but I guess I'll have to check it again but I did yeah I managed to grab Battlefield 3 and I recommend anybody that has PlayStation Plus that listens to the show to go grab it as well because I think it'd be fun for like a game night or something like that because we I have no idea what I'm doing Battlefield 3 and plus you know makes it even more fun that you can fly jets and that and you want to kick everyone's ass right I just want to fly a jet and the people and do all sorts of crazy shit you know I think that'd be fun is that your goal in life to fly a jet into a person
6491076	6491456	No.
6491997	6492217	Okay.
6492858	6493638	So other news.
6494499	6497041	There is a Mega Man board game.
6498062	6513997	Well, there is going to be, let's see, it looks like they're trying to tie it in with 25th anniversary, but it will let you be Mega Man on the board field and beat Dr. Wily the usual way, except, you know, with rolling dice, I guess.
6516218	6520743	There's also going to be other memorabilia coming out including a Mega Man statue and 3DS case covers.
6521284	6522986	But no game, so whatever.
6524287	6525008	Well, a board game.
6527156	6528477	A board game.
6529398	6531020	Hey, don't diss board games.
6531640	6532381	I like board games.
6532581	6532902	Me too.
6534303	6536305	I played a really fun one and I can't remember the name of it.
6536325	6537486	Although it was more of a card game.
6537566	6538507	I played it on the 4th of July.
6538547	6539228	It was really fun.
6539628	6541370	It was everybody got dealt an identity.
6541590	6546114	It was kind of like Mafia or Wolf Game or one of those types of things where everybody got dealt an identity.
6546134	6547155	Somebody in chat is going to know this.
6547215	6549638	Like Degenerate Johnny or somebody who knows their card games is going to know this.
6550158	6576677	uh like you get dealt these cards and like three people would be the spies and everybody else is like the good guys and you go on missions but if the spies go on missions they can flunk the missions and if too many missions get flunked then the spies win if missions pass then the good guys win and then you also have like these cards that can reveal people's identities well it gets in this really good like you start like arguing with all your friends about who's a spy and who's not a spy you know a la mafia I think it was called the resistance I want to say that was the name of it might have been the name of it
6578021	6582745	That made me just think of sort of that old werewolf game that people used to play on DDR Freak.
6582805	6586027	Oh yeah, that's a thing that happens at conventions and stuff.
6586208	6588970	That's all based off of LARP, basically.
6589590	6589951	LARP!
6590251	6591192	You know, OL LARP.
6591732	6594354	Big, big positive reception to the OL LARP idea.
6594654	6595155	Just saying.
6597133	6598154	You know what?
6598554	6601636	I do kind of want to do OLARP.
6602057	6603238	I definitely want to do OLARP.
6603258	6604639	But I have to play myself.
6604739	6607821	Maybe in our nod to DDR Freak, we could start with the wolf game.
6608381	6611143	That would be cool.
6612424	6612785	You know what?
6612845	6615647	It's going to sound a little bit sad, but I do miss my LARP days.
6617196	6621417	Where I would wear this... And keep in mind, it was Vampire LARP.
6621738	6623458	So it was even more sad.
6623698	6625659	BlackWolfInChat says, Used to play.
6625879	6628100	Werewolf is all I do at DragonCon.
6628220	6631601	I can't fucking wait for DragonCon and actually play some authentic LARPing.
6631621	6632701	I'm so excited.
6632941	6636522	In Mobile, where I'm from, the big convention there is MobyCon.
6637183	6638623	And it's gotten a lot bigger, too.
6638663	6644285	It was GoldDragon's thing, and GoldDragon's since gone out of business, but MobyCon has stayed a fixture for...
6645026	6656606	and it was my first actual LARP experience was playing a vampire there and now I think that they're doing like a couple of other ones and I've actually when I went to
6660802	6661783	What's the convention?
6661843	6664124	CoastCon, I think it was, in Biloxi.
6664504	6667846	They did a live-action anime game.
6668066	6669307	They just decided to make one up.
6669747	6674790	And keep in mind, this is like in 1996, so if anyone wants to keep in mind what was out then.
6675511	6679493	And I did Dragon Ball Z stuff.
6681030	6681830	I think this is it.
6681890	6692236	Fifth Dream linked me to something that's on Geek & Sundry where it has like a bunch of the nerd celebs like Will Wheaton and Felicia Day are all playing the Resistance and it's like this big reality show set up here.
6692356	6693656	So I think this is the game.
6693696	6694056	Yeah, yeah.
6694357	6694877	This is fun.
6695597	6696398	This is a lot of fun.
6696438	6699399	This would be a good game for OLARP even though it's not really LARPing.
6699539	6703001	I think people would enjoy watching us yell at each other and playing this game.
6703461	6703941	It's a lot of fun.
6704742	6704902	Yes.
6705422	6707707	Oh yeah, this is definitely it, now that I can see the board here.
6708148	6708629	Very cool.
6709130	6709611	Alright, anyway.
6711394	6714260	Sorry for the sidetrack, but since we're talking about board games...
6721988	6723429	Let's go to the Foogle question of the week.
6723529	6726510	Take Facebook and Google+, slam them together, and you get Foogle.
6726851	6728331	And this week, it's about board games.
6728411	6736856	Since we did just talk about this story anyhow, about Mega Man being a board game, we decided to ask our listeners, what video game do you think would make a fun board game?
6737076	6740978	Or, if you rather, what board game that isn't already one would make a fun video game?
6741339	6746121	That one's hard because I find a lot of people don't know what video games have been turned into board games.
6746641	6747442	So, you know...
6749088	6749869	JV Mon JV Mon JV Mon
6772907	6779411	says, I definitely think that a board game can be made out of Metal Gear Solid as some sort of tactical game, maybe Mass Effect as well.
6779831	6785134	Also, although this is a card game, I definitely think Cards Against Humanity would make a fun Xbox Live Arcade game.
6785714	6791197	They do have Apples to Apples, which does have the Helen Keller card, which kind of led to Cards Against Humanity, just saying.
6792658	6800084	Robert Gauss on Google Plus says XCOM would be a good one being turn-based already.
6800285	6805369	Animal Crossing also, but it would be a resource-gathering trading game like Catan.
6806933	6817797	Dr. Noir says, I've actually enjoyed the Dragon Age tabletop RPGs and am very much amazed no one has put out a clean pen and paper RPG based on any Final Fantasy franchise.
6818677	6823098	Also, the D&D crossover, computer to tabletop and vice versa games are really enjoyable.
6824019	6825499	Thank you to the folks over on Google+.
6825559	6828840	Let's check out Facebook and some of the answers we have here on Facebook.
6829601	6830161	Ooh, we have a lot.
6831541	6854141	Jeremy J from Koopa Club says Metroid also I think The Legend of Zelda would lend itself well to the format I've never played the Milton Bradley game but I don't think they've done one since then ClericalError404 says Castlevania could potentially make an entertaining board game especially the entries that are primarily about exploration and backtracking it's kind of interesting Metroid and Castlevania and I think of Metroidvania games
6854748	6861072	If I may make a suggestion, by the way, keep in mind that for some of these things there are games out overseas.
6861752	6867196	In fact, there's even RPGs in Japan that have spawned anime and various video games.
6867216	6868657	For example, Lodoss War.
6869337	6870578	It started off as a tabletop game.
6872412	6878094	Clerical Error also follows up saying, I would really like to see a video game version or completely new take on Arkham Asylum.
6878655	6881776	Now Stan H followed up later saying there already is one, a board game.
6881816	6885818	But you know, it's kind of hard to keep track of a lot of the board games that are out there.
6885898	6890679	So, you know, I didn't know until Stan said that either that there was an Arkham Asylum board game.
6891040	6893761	But thanks to the boys from Koopa Club for jumping in there first on that question.
6893781	6894261	I appreciate it.
6895281	6900304	Moving on, Katsuhiko J says, Katamari Damacy would make a fun board game.
6900685	6905267	Roll up all the pieces and weigh the ball to win, although keeping all the pieces would be a nightmare.
6905668	6907829	That's actually kind of like silly awesome.
6907849	6911111	Think about what you could do with Velcro, like rolling over other Velcro things.
6911151	6914293	Remember the actual Katamari that they had at E3?
6914413	6914813	Yeah, yeah.
6915133	6922518	I'm just thinking just a big ball made of Velcro and you could roll over Velcro chips that would keep like you could add to the Velcro, but then taking that thing apart would be a bitch.
6923018	6923939	Remote-controlled electromagnet
6941777	6942818	Magnets, yes.
6943039	6945120	Magnets, how do they work?
6945320	6950164	When you're done, you just click the button to turn the magnet off and boop, everything comes free.
6951225	6952847	I'm sure that'll be cheap.
6952887	6955209	Get your credit cards far away from that.
6955229	6957571	It's like wire wrapped around metal, come on.
6957671	6963836	Actually, it would not be at all expensive and keep in mind that if you have all your pieces as metal, magnetic current will carry through metal.
6964963	6965263	All right.
6966164	6966524	Let's see.
6966604	6971648	Clover Nikon says, Well, Bioshock Infinite is a board game already, so it'd have to be Grand Theft Auto.
6972588	6973729	That's a good idea for a board game.
6975671	6976851	You got hot coffee.
6976951	6977492	Lose a turn.
6978553	6989781	Stan H says, The Last of Us would make a good board game similar to Last Night on Earth, a board game where one player takes control of the infected and all other players control one of the survivors looking around for weapons and tools.
6990941	6992362	I always mispronounce this name.
6992402	6992962	I apologize.
6993542	6996844	Cial says a Mario board game might be interesting.
6997684	7000465	Gamer Girl says Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep.
7000866	7005287	I think they should totally make a board game based on the DLC content of that game at Borderlands 2, of course.
7005688	7008169	It's so fun and just reminds me of the old pen and paper board games.
7008809	7015030	Degenerate Johnny says my first choice would be Mass Effect, but we all know that Mass Effect Risk, ahem, Galaxy at War will be released this fall.
7015490	7018011	Therefore, I would go with a board game version of Deus Ex.
7018591	7023672	With that being said, I cannot think of any better company to create the Deus Ex board game than Fantasy Flight.
7024212	7031074	Fantasy Flight has specialized in making board games based on video game titles such as Gears of War, Age of Conan, and pay attention, Rob and Bobby.
7031514	7032375	Civilization.
7032695	7034756	Yes, I'm aware of the Civilization board game, believe it or not.
7035376	7040319	Expensive as hell and about 11 billion pieces and nobody to play it with me.
7042345	7068951	Andy R says how about a real life triple triad that would be cool hey I'm all for the Final Fantasy card games becoming like real card games as far as board games to video games I'd love to see more board games get a video game adaptation as in just the board game but able to play over the internet all my college friends live in different cities now and I'd love to be able to play with them over the internet with voice chat or such I'd really be interested to see what a video game company can make out of galaxy truckers though I'm sure it'd be hard as balls
7070532	7077001	Ragenator says, I want to say that Half-Life 3 would make a good board game, assuming that the board game ever gets released.
7077361	7081787	Of course, Duke Nukem Forever, the board game, will take forever to be released due to development hell.
7082588	7083069	Oh, you.
7084211	7086754	Steve Chiller says, Super Mario RPG.
7088208	7109407	William Murderface says Disgaea might make an interesting game it could sort of be like it could be sort of like Munchkin but the combat would work a bit differently and the leveling system would be more detailed also Seaman might make an interesting game maybe make it like Cards Against Humanity I'll friend your butt it's a reference to an old YouTube joke on the show
7111142	7127930	Tyler M says there needs to be a Munchkin Xbox Live or PlayStation Network adaptation Shane, our good friend Shane Alinko from Horde House says clearly the correct answer is anticipation it needs to have the limp ice cream cone and floppy horn
7128610	7130030	Good answer, good answer.
7130671	7132191	A real answer would be Pokemon.
7132511	7139554	I don't think it would work so much as I'd really just want to see if they packaged in 649 pieces for every Pokemon in the series, excluding form changes.
7139574	7140494	It's the card game already.
7140514	7142274	Maybe a card game, yeah.
7142354	7146916	Chiggers, last but not least, says Final Fantasy Tactics, a combo board and card game.
7147636	7150177	For the record, you know there is a Mario Monopoly, right?
7150197	7151337	That's right, yeah.
7151697	7153018	I think there's a Pokemon one, too.
7153038	7154138	There's an everything Monopoly.
7154478	7156099	Mario Monopoly is just Monopoly.
7156587	7158728	For the record, Rob, I've decided to do something.
7158928	7160228	And I've given myself this idea.
7160869	7163310	You know how you can make custom cards for Cards Against Humanity?
7163750	7164950	I'm going to do the OLR theme.
7166591	7167871	With the print template and everything.
7167891	7168311	That'd be fun.
7168952	7169372	I should do that.
7169392	7169932	That'd be a lot of fun.
7170472	7170712	Alright.
7171153	7170712	$50!
7171193	7172413	No, I'm kidding.
7173133	7175314	Alright, that does it for the Fugle Question of the Week.
7175374	7179696	Friend us on Facebook at facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio or add us on Google+.
7179796	7182377	Just search OrangeLoungeRadio on Google and we come right up.
7182917	7183937	And there you go.
7184498	7185318	You can answer next week.
7185798	7186679	Meanwhile, more news.
7187019	7187239	Loki.
7207871	7218358	They have a similar system that was in Max Payne 3 where it's kind of if people get caught cheating, they get put in a cheaters pool where all they encounter are people that hack the game and, you know, are cheaters.
7218918	7220999	So, similar sense to that.
7221379	7225802	Although, I don't know if it's going to work exactly the same on the reputation system because...
7227783	7235867	Your rating goes back up if no one really reports you, like if they don't report you much.
7235947	7250793	So what's going to happen is you're going to have this yo-yo process where you get a low rep, and then you get put in the low rep pool, and then all the people with low rep aren't probably going to report each other, so your rep's going to go back up, and then you go back in the normal pool, and so on and so forth.
7251913	7255135	But, hey, I guess it's better than nothing.
7257335	7265560	Here's my thing, though, is that I thought this already was supposed to be there to some extent in the current Xbox.
7265700	7273324	They do have a reputation system in Xbox, and you can block people and stuff that you don't want to play with that are cheaters and stuff.
7273344	7282169	But then again, I also have 80% rating for unsportsmanlike conduct, but that's just because I kick the crap out of them.
7282329	7284551	It's not because I talk trash, because I don't have a headset.
7285211	7287055	It's just because I kicked the crap out of them.
7287796	7289179	Mercifully.
7291042	7292064	Mercilessly, I guess.
7294534	7298496	They... So you get false reports all the time.
7300236	7304958	I mean, my star rating's still high, but it's just... Yeah, you gotta be careful.
7304978	7308080	Especially if you're playing a lot, you get a lot of false ratings.
7308180	7315843	Somebody who uses this system a lot should have their vote weighed less than somebody who uses it sparingly, because you know they mean it when they use it sparingly, you know?
7316303	7318104	But somebody who kind of overuses it?
7319244	7320445	I guess.
7320465	7322165	There's a fine system to it.
7322506	7323486	I don't know what the answer is.
7324588	7353048	I don't know, it would be, or like if they're like, you know, rating you for like I don't know, language or something like that you don't have a headset connected or something you know, maybe it flags something going, hey, wait a second how did they say anything to you without any sort of communication tool, I don't know whatever, I mean, I guess it's not a big deal unless, you know, a bunch of people gang up on something, but it's the same flaw in any system I guess
7354951	7357372	Well, remember the Wii Vitality Sensor?
7357412	7359833	This was something that was shown at E3 a few years ago.
7360134	7362875	And, you know, Nintendo kind of made a big hoop to do about it.
7363175	7364476	And then it kind of disappeared.
7364516	7366957	And that was a really poor showing.
7366977	7369458	That whole year in general for Nintendo was not good news.
7370058	7371439	and this thing kind of disappeared.
7371499	7375540	Well, news coming out this week about why the Wii Vitality Sensor disappeared.
7375560	7379081	And this was in a conversation that Satoru Iwata had with investors.
7379841	7386384	Basically, what it comes down to is that after doing a large test of the prototype, the peripheral apparently only worked on certain people.
7386724	7389825	The success rate was 9 out of 10 people could use it.
7390705	7391205	So, quote,
7406132	7411496	The Wii Vitality Sensor is an interesting device and we did various experiments to see what is possible when it's combined with a video game.
7411856	7420302	But as a result, we have not been able to launch it as a commercial product because we could not get it to work as we expected and it was of narrower application than we originally thought.
7420822	7426666	We would like to launch it into the market if technology advancements enable 999 out of 1000 people to use it without any problems, not only 90 out of 100 people.
7430709	7435272	So, it makes me wonder, though, that if, um, you know, this doesn't work as well.
7435292	7438253	I wonder if, you know, the new Kinect is actually gonna work as well as they said.
7438273	7441995	That's what I was thinking, because I thought the Kinect was supposed to have something like this in there.
7442395	7447038	Um, yeah, I don't know, because... Well, it doesn't, it's not like a monitor, but it's supposed to kind of see that.
7447058	7451100	It's supposed to, like, see the pulse of your skin, I guess, but... Come on.
7451240	7452661	And really, we know why this isn't working.
7452801	7454722	Mirka, your fingers are too fucking fat.
7457223	7458404	Can't get your stump in there.
7458424	7458764	Yeah.
7462938	7466601	I'm not exactly sure what exciting games could have come of it anyway.
7466901	7467802	Zero.
7467982	7469283	Zero games would have been exciting.
7469303	7471464	I could give myself an EKG at home.
7471524	7474207	That's what it sounds like the Wii Vitality Sensor would be good for.
7474527	7475067	What's next?
7475127	7476548	The Wii Blood Pressure Monitor?
7476769	7478590	I don't know.
7478650	7482013	I wasn't feeling it, and I don't think many of us were.
7482033	7486416	This is kind of one of those, you know, sometimes... You know what would get my vitality up?
7486576	7486756	Huh.
7487957	7491140	If they re-release the Rez trance, no.
7491641	7493102	You know what would get my vitality up?
7493603	7493983	Sex.
7494824	7495344	Pinkberry.
7495885	7496685	Oh yeah, and Pinkberry.
7498847	7500469	Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us next?
7500697	7504458	I was actually trying to ask IkumaJP, what is the nasty tea you happen to have?
7505719	7507880	But let's go to other news, speaking of nasty things.
7508440	7509260	Violent games.
7510041	7516603	Well, there's a study that came out that says they do not adversely affect pro-social behavior.
7517243	7517984	Meaning that...
7519744	7525707	They don't take regular, everyday social people and suddenly make them antisocial.
7525727	7540614	This was a research that was conducted by University of Queensland, Australia that concluded that playing violent video games really doesn't have an adverse effect on people and I guess...
7543379	7553292	I want to say neurotypical mental states, but basically they're not going to make an extroverted person suddenly introverted, and they're not going to make an introverted person suddenly want to go on a murderous rampage.
7553772	7558739	But they may make some lazy people not want to bathe if they're playing for a long time.
7559620	7560221	How do you know this?
7561226	7561826	I'm just saying.
7562907	7575275	Anyway, the way that it goes is that each participant played one of four video games for 20 minutes and at the end of the test they had to drop some pens to see how many would pick them up.
7575776	7582260	So no matter how many games they got these people to play, about 40-60% of them helped pick the pens back up at the end of the study.
7583021	7589465	And then they found that participants were more likely to help when pens were dropped halfway through the experiment.
7592107	7616666	it doesn't really affect your willingness to help other people it doesn't affect your ability to interact with other people pretty much I think that the it's like we've been saying all along that has to already be there to already have to have the adverse effect and this was um you can find out from from going to PLOS1 um I think that you can uh find the uh
7618496	7620258	The study, if you search for it online.
7621139	7625685	And I found this information out actually through GamePolitik, so there's links following through that website as well.
7628848	7629229	Alright.
7630170	7631952	Let's see here.
7633253	7634615	Let's talk a little bit about...
7637398	7638158	Advertisements.
7639038	7645540	And, you know, one of the big criticisms that Microsoft gets with the Xbox 360 is, Hey, you know what?
7645660	7647340	I pay for Xbox Live Gold.
7647380	7650041	Why the fuck do I have advertisements on my console?
7651281	7653942	Why do I see this when I'm paying for my online already?
7654542	7657203	Well, it's not gonna get any better.
7658543	7664784	In fact, they are working on integrating Kinect functionality with ads.
7665265	7666445	Hooray!
7667145	7671327	That's right, and one of the examples that they have in this wonderful picture here is for Ben Gay.
7671667	7677050	That's right, you can use the Ben Gay campaign, or they had a campaign, I guess it ran on 360.
7679852	7686255	And they're saying that new ads, I guess, will support the Kinect somehow.
7686696	7688577	Voice recognition, I guess, maybe.
7688597	7689297	Yeah.
7691148	7703522	I'm wondering if they're going to have some sort of... Because I know some of these videos I've seen before will have a way, instead of just hitting a button to skip it, it's like, type this word to skip this.
7703622	7707866	Or they may say, say this phrase to skip this thing.
7709047	7710828	And then sometimes it's like the commercial slogan.
7710868	7715729	I saw that on a captcha the other day where it was like you had to type the little slogan of the company that was advertising.
7715749	7717810	That was the captcha, was to type the slogan.
7718150	7719730	That's just stupid.
7720011	7721791	But I mean, it's less irritating.
7721871	7722691	It's clever as hell, actually.
7722711	7729373	It's basically just to say that you saw the ad and that you saw it instead of just ignoring it.
7730774	7732794	So, I don't know.
7732954	7734615	I'm not too excited about that, but...
7736324	7740268	Obviously, they're going to try to support the peripherals that are on there for that stuff.
7740288	7743491	And I think they did some of that stuff with the Xbox 360.
7745133	7748136	Hell, they've crafted whole games based on advertisement.
7748256	7750218	Yars.
7750418	7750999	And Doritos.
7751039	7752240	I guess they have the Doritos stuff.
7752260	7755363	Yeah, the Dash of Destruction or whatever it is.
7755383	7757305	That's Princess Irene's favorite game.
7757445	7758025	One of those is good.
7758085	7758666	One of them's not.
7760968	7768099	Alright, well, speaking of things that are good and not so good, depending on what side of the fence you're on, the controversial SimCity.
7768760	7771384	Oh, I did want to add this quote at the very end there.
7771424	7776772	It says, while advertising was more of an afterthought in the 360, the Xbox One is going to have advertising in mind.
7778726	7779487	Advertising in mind.
7779667	7780968	Not consumers in mind.
7781328	7782189	Advertising in mind.
7782789	7784551	So the Xbox One is anti-consumer.
7785051	7785251	Yes.
7785452	7787353	Which is why Bobby Blackwolf pre-ordered one.
7787934	7793859	So a lot of the limitations that we have now, hopefully the release of the boundaries will be widened so the opportunities will be elaborated.
7793899	7794719	Whatever the fuck that means.
7794759	7795060	I don't know.
7796740	7802403	Anyhow, SimCity, which one might argue is also anti-consumer, at least a lot of people really felt that way.
7803383	7809826	SimCity, they said this game was not designed to be played as a single-player experience, not designed to be offline.
7809846	7814188	What are they talking about?
7814228	7815289	It's part of the experience.
7815309	7816750	It's what people want with SimCity.
7816810	7817070	Well...
7817990	7827675	Now, take this with a grain of salt, because it comes from a Reddit post of a customer survey that was being sent to SimCity players, but EA is thinking about an offline mode for the game.
7828816	7841903	The survey lists several features, including a classic mode, which would allow you to, quote, in offline or online mode, play a single, fully functioning city using cheats and unlocks that allow you to create your perfect city.
7842523	7846646	So, in other words, the game that most of us believe is actually SimCity.
7847926	7858032	The poll also talks about expansions, DLC, something that would add super scrapers into the game, clean energy cities, green economies, and so forth.
7858112	7862414	You can get screen caps of the survey on Imgur, which were posted via Reddit.
7862734	7863114	Again...
7864415	7869179	I'm just saying this kind of stuff that isn't really sourced except through screen caps.
7869359	7871221	You have to take with a grain of salt.
7872242	7878967	But I think some of us certainly saw this coming where SimCity might kind of back end an offline mode into it, but charge for it.
7880468	7891693	Um, I mean, let's just... It could be fake, it could be real, but we know for a fact that you can play it offline because people have hacked it to be able to play it offline.
7891753	7897095	And so a lot of the computations that they're offloading onto a server is just ridiculous.
7897356	7899537	I mean, your computer can't handle that stuff.
7899597	7899917	It's just...
7901297	7903319	They still want an excuse to tie it to you.
7903599	7908883	So just keep that in mind when you have these next-gen games, and I'm not saying it's just an Xbox One thing.
7908943	7922893	It's going to be PlayStation 4 as well, that require cloud computing for this shit to work because it probably could handle it on the system, but for whatever reason, they wanted that extra layer of connectivity or DRM.
7923213	7924874	What happens when the servers go down?
7924914	7925915	Because they will go down.
7927256	7929377	You get delisted from Steam like Darkspore.
7930438	7930538	Yeah.
7932820	7939166	SSJ100Matt in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Question, did they ask any questions about SimCity action news?
7939887	7940647	No, but I wish they would.
7940988	7942729	That feature would be like InstaBuy.
7942869	7948274	If they could get that back in SimCity, the full motion video clips from the classic CD-ROM game, I'd be there in a heartbeat.
7949696	7952098	SSJ100Matt asked the hard-hitting questions here at OLR.
7952398	7953119	I appreciate that.
7954921	7956703	Alright, let's go to the mailbag.
7956803	7960246	Every week you ask some hard-hitting questions in our mailbag.
7960306	7967054	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com DarkSakura will dive in the mailbag headfirst and read an email or two that she deems worthy.
7967334	7967935	Only got two.
7968595	7971639	Or you only get two emails the entire week and so it makes her job easy.
7972159	7972659	Yes, it does.
7973019	7973679	I'll read the first one.
7973699	7974800	I don't know.
7995649	7997891	It's a little harder now that they can patch the system.
7997911	8000853	With the DS, they couldn't really patch it too easily.
8001053	8003315	Or at all, I think.
8003615	8006197	It's going to be a lot harder.
8006617	8008278	It's always going to get harder with each generation.
8009139	8012401	I don't think they're going to have any sort of permanent solution.
8013101	8014903	Keep the DS you've got for that stuff.
8016164	8016544	If you can.
8017375	8025341	Alright, next part, and a comment for Rob Yay It finally happened, Super Metroid for SNES has been bumped to my second favorite game of all time What?
8025781	8031285	Stop reading this email, I don't want to hear the rest It's not official yet, but I think that Far Cry 3 might have replaced it
8032857	8034138	Thank you for watching!
8048292	8073017	but the island is so beautiful and immersive and I've been doing everything there is to do I haven't even tried the multiplayer yet so if you have a good graphics card $20 I highly recommend it and please ask chat to comment if they like the multiplayer or not thanks your loyal turtle in Philly serious turtles you don't even need a really good graphics card for that game for some reason like I have Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon and it runs fine on my laptop
8073502	8075065	So much wrong with this email.
8075145	8077428	First, you say Super Metroid gets bumped to number two.
8077889	8079972	Then you use the phrase, Loki was right.
8079992	8083517	There's so much wrong with this email, I don't even know where to begin.
8083737	8086841	Hey, I agree Super Metroid is a better game than Far Cry 3.
8087062	8087382	All right.
8087582	8088444	You're a smart man, Loki.
8088464	8089225	That's why we keep you around.
8089765	8092566	But no, in all seriousness, I haven't played Far Cry 3.
8092706	8093566	I can't hate on it.
8093646	8094567	Loki sure seems to enjoy it.
8094587	8096207	I got bored of it pretty fast, actually.
8096467	8097308	Oh, I thought you really liked it.
8097328	8106711	Blood Dragon was cool, but Blood Dragon was even kind of... It's just... It's very... You know, they have an open world, but it's kind of like, okay, take over Outpost.
8106951	8108131	Okay, hunt some animals.
8108371	8111912	Okay, you know, kill this dude.
8111932	8113013	I don't know, it's...
8113573	8133768	it just got really boring for me and I never finished it so I probably should although they have a really cool multiplayer mode like see Far Cry was kind of cool on the consoles and PCs you can make your own maps but in 3 they got rid of the multiplayer where you can make your own maps they have just like this single player like sandbox thing that you can make some shit so I don't know
8134028	8136551	Well, and here's the other thing.
8136691	8140835	It's looking very likely we might have a Steam sale next week.
8141355	8142376	It's about that time of year.
8142877	8145639	It should have started already, but it might be next Thursday.
8145759	8147101	I thought they announced a date.
8147121	8148262	I think it's next weekend.
8148702	8149823	So there'll be that.
8150023	8156489	And I know you said the good deals come from Amazon, but at this point, Far Cry 3 on a Steam summer sale.
8156509	8159112	If they put trading cards in it, it's over.
8160313	8161954	They have some really good bundles.
8162514	8163715	It's just like they had one.
8163795	8164636	It was for $40.
8164916	8167578	You get Bioshock Infinite, Bioshock 2, and Bioshock 1.
8168099	8171722	I already have one and two from previous Amazon sales, so I didn't get that.
8171782	8173883	But that was a pretty good deal.
8174023	8175144	And they've got some other games.
8175204	8182570	But the problem is I'm pretty limited now with what I'm buying on PC because I have a ton of shit that I just don't play.
8182690	8182870	So...
8184011	8187894	You know, unless it's like... I don't even really know what else I really need.
8188214	8190016	I mean, there's a lot of stuff I have.
8190256	8192618	It's just... I don't know.
8192778	8193798	Saints Row 4?
8194059	8196240	I mean, you know, I'll get that eventually.
8196340	8198322	But I don't really know what else I need.
8198362	8201324	Like, I have all of... I mean, Far Cry... Or not Far Cry, yeah.
8201384	8202245	I mean, I have Far Cry 3.
8202285	8203806	I don't have Far Cry 3 on PC yet.
8204346	8204647	But like...
8207270	8220449	Fallout, maybe Fallout I don't know the Fallout games yet but I don't know if I'd have time to play that I'm assuming it's going to be hundreds of hours just like Skyrim and shit so I don't have time for that ain't nobody got time for that alright next email
8222677	8225200	Hey everyone, I just wanted to make this quick, short, and sweet.
8226121	8230746	Last week's episode of OLR reminded me of how much we are more of a family than anything else.
8231667	8234710	You three were there for that listener as he was dealing with the loss of his wife.
8234810	8241218	You three were also there for me when I had to deal with my passing of my mother along with everyone else that has been a long time listener.
8242018	8249784	I'm inclined to say that Orange Dawn's radio is that chill big brother slash sister that we can come to for advice on dealing with anything and will not pass judgment on us.
8249924	8251225	Except me because I judge everybody.
8251605	8251885	Kidding.
8253086	8261072	And speaking of passing judgment, two weeks ago with that unprofessional email that came in, as you recall, the entire chat room banded together and we were ready to lynch someone for it because we are family.
8261112	8261992	We look out for each other.
8262953	8269577	Tell you what though, I am ever grateful for Rob who helped me set up for my show right after my ex dumping me 15 minutes prior.
8269997	8272898	And that's why I keep listening, supporting, and telling others to check out OLR.
8273198	8274159	Much love, Ranchan.
8275079	8277241	I had no idea about that until after the fact though.
8278221	8280402	But I still would have helped you all the same.
8280722	8281603	But thank you.
8283353	8285555	Big hearts to Ranchan because my Ranchan.
8286676	8287357	And there's PS.
8287937	8289659	Hey Rob, what's the new OLR hashtag?
8289739	8289999	Wink.
8291881	8294083	OLR Lovefest is the new hashtag.
8294143	8294983	OLR Lovefest.
8297205	8298206	Not going to lie to you guys.
8298607	8300668	That was a very difficult call at the end of last week's show.
8300769	8305593	Probably one of the toughest, if not the toughest, I've taken in the 11, 12 years we've been here.
8307154	8317219	Um, but he needed a friend and I was so happy to see that there's like 70 of them in the chat room and countless more on the podcast feed.
8317319	8319560	So, um, yeah, that really is what it's all about.
8319620	8322201	And you guys, you know, it's not just us for you guys.
8322862	8326823	We've shared some pretty personal stories over the past few years of this show as well.
8326863	8332306	We've had, you know, not every, not every day is sunshine and roses at Studio OLR, but, uh, we get through it.
8333891	8335432	PPS, Two Tacos for Uchan I want a taco
8351311	8352052	I want tacos too.
8352092	8352672	Did I tell you?
8352993	8353673	I told you, Rob.
8354073	8359919	The real estate lady who took us around to all these houses and got us this good deal on this house bought us pizza.
8361420	8363041	Because she wanted to sell you that house.
8363582	8364623	She was a nice lady.
8364703	8365804	She was legit nice.
8365884	8367765	She knew the way to get your attention.
8367785	8368826	And she brought us drinks.
8369967	8374091	P-I-Z-Z-A But champagne would have definitely sold more houses.
8376333	8378595	I'm going to have a mimosa party if we get this house, by the way.
8379417	8380399	Bottomless Mimosas?
8380619	8381240	Heck yeah!
8381440	8381801	I'm there.
8382061	8382722	Bring you the champagne?
8383143	8391255	Alright, after the hashtag OLR Lovefest is a very appropriate time to bring us back down to Earth with some FUs of the Week!
8407680	8411142	F you to this damn cough that will not go the fuck away.
8411322	8415485	Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
8416746	8417366	It sucks.
8418807	8424250	And, um... No, that ends with the cough.
8425291	8427792	And my toes for hurting and, um...
8430959	8432080	Yeah, and Girl Problems.
8434161	8434461	Loki.
8436062	8438843	It's just, fuck you, the long weekend's gone.
8439423	8439843	That's it.
8440304	8440924	Amen to that.
8441544	8442365	Fuck you to the heat.
8443365	8448307	Fuck you to Grandpa for living in San Francisco where the weather was beautiful the whole time we stayed.
8449288	8451289	We went over there for a concert on a Wednesday.
8451909	8454410	And Frank Music, who puts on a great show, by the way.
8454430	8455371	He's a very talented young man.
8455991	8456832	Thanks for watching!
8476027	8477288	Now he just brought the heat with him.
8477549	8478069	That's right.
8478349	8479430	Girl, you need to leave that heat at home.
8479450	8480972	Because he's just a hot mess.
8482133	8482814	I hope he's listening.
8483434	8485597	Gameboy.org Yes, artichokes are good on pizza.
8485637	8485957	Shut up.
8486077	8486798	Artichoke hearts.
8488600	8488900	All right.
8489921	8492423	Let us move on with a couple more news stories for you guys.
8492563	8495506	And then Twitter topics and the Skype line.
8495907	8496688	But first, Loki.
8497288	8514694	Alright, so Sony, during their press conference actually, and during E3, they were showing off this kind of augmented reality tech demo to show off the PlayStation 4 and the new iCamera.
8515294	8522277	Well, what's kind of cool, this tech demo called Playroom is actually going to be included with
8523137	8525179	and the PlayStation 4 system.
8539052	8550899	I, personally, if it were me, I would just throw that tech demo in with the camera and not necessarily the system so that, you know, you have something with the camera to play games with.
8551960	8552260	I don't know.
8552900	8558864	Maybe some of the tech, or maybe some of the demos in there don't necessarily use the camera.
8559744	8560064	I don't know.
8560685	8561365	It looks neat, though.
8561685	8562926	Kind of makes me want to get a camera, too.
8565567	8582780	That's enough to sell you on the whole That looks neat, I mean, I don't know I don't know, I need to see more games that really make good use of it Although the move is kind of underrated As far as the motion stuff goes, the move works very well And it just, I don't know Have you used the move?
8583020	8592888	Yeah, I have All the way back at E3 once even I played the Toy Story, it was one of the first games I played I think the first game I played on the move And somebody else I knew had one
8593388	8593568	Hmm.
8594469	8594629	So.
8595490	8595730	All right.
8597332	8601495	One more news story for you guys, and it's about Nintendo on the losing end of a lawsuit.
8602416	8610543	They actually filed a domain dispute with the World Intellectual Property Organization over the WiiU.com domain name.
8610963	8613225	Now, Nintendo does own Wii-U.com and Wii-U.net, but
8615407	8623616	But an unknown, or at least they're unnamed, registrant snapped up WiiU.com in 2004, long before even the first Wii.
8624377	8628081	Nintendo filed a cyber-squatting complaint.
8628802	8630924	The WIPO denied that complaint.
8631244	8637030	Nintendo will have to contact WiiU.com's owner directly to negotiate a purchase.
8637851	8644878	Microsoft, by the way, in a similar domain dispute with XboxOne.com and XboxOne.net's domains.
8645098	8650384	So it gets harder to get these domains that people just snap up and they sit on them.
8651024	8653167	So Nintendo tried with the cyber squatting.
8653427	8656450	I'd like to hear more about why it was denied.
8656910	8658051	I mean, what's on that site?
8658232	8658452	Should I...
8658712	8660133	So what was denied?
8660193	8665774	Well, Wii U stood for, it was like, we invest in you, is what it was.
8665834	8669436	And it was, it's from a long time ago that the guy registered the site.
8669676	8672237	Yeah, but now it's just a bunch of, it's ads.
8672477	8673417	I'm looking at the site now.
8673437	8675838	This is totally just like a squat ad thing.
8677242	8678603	I don't get, like, why is this here?
8678623	8682724	Well, they tried, I understand that, but it's still his site.
8683024	8688486	And the thing was, they were trying to take it saying basically that he's just squatting on the name and stuff like that.
8688506	8694208	But it's legitimately, he registered it a long time ago before it wasn't to try to, you know, make a quick buck and stuff.
8694288	8702311	But, so now they can't necessarily get it just by saying, oh, well, it should be turned over to us because it's, you know, infringing on our copyrights or anything like that.
8703092	8707957	Now they have to basically go the second route, which is offer big sum of cash to buy it.
8708517	8710179	I get what you're saying, but this shit's shady.
8710519	8712962	He's not using it now for that purpose.
8713542	8719929	So give it up, because this is profiting off of Nintendo's... Nintendo has built the name recognition.
8719989	8722832	This guy, with this page here, this is profiting off it.
8723092	8724794	If I went to WiiU.com and saw...
8725374	8728795	Wee, Financial Investment, and this guy's thing.
8729095	8730336	Things not tied to video games.
8730396	8734097	I'd be like, okay, sucks for Nintendo, but this guy had it first.
8734877	8737538	It's just like OLR.
8737899	8739639	We probably don't own OLR.com.
8739699	8741100	Who does own OLR.com?
8741120	8742020	What is there if I go there?
8742860	8746922	Remember when we had the Sacramentals back in the day as our DDR group?
8747882	8755203	Okay, OLR.com belongs to this online residential and it's something to do with New York and getting places in New York.
8755743	8757384	It's hard for me to complain about this.
8757744	8765525	Somebody's not sitting on this profiting off of, you know, here's every annoying rant Rob's ever made with ads attached to it or something.
8765585	8767125	Like they're not profiting off something we did.
8767445	8771446	You know, it just happens to be that OLR is a pretty common acronym that means a few different things.
8771486	8772946	So this online residential has it.
8773326	8775407	So can't really complain about that.
8775647	8776347	Well, you know.
8777027	8783053	My point was with the sacramental thing is that when I tried to register it, it belonged to some Catholic group in Sacramento.
8783093	8783653	Oh, that's right.
8783713	8784154	That's right.
8784354	8784494	Yeah.
8784514	8785094	I remember that.
8787697	8787977	All right.
8788718	8793422	Also, word of warning, Animal Crossing will not let you say fart face or ass face or arse face.
8793722	8794022	Really?
8794262	8795303	As anybody's catchphrase.
8795684	8795804	Oh.
8795984	8800688	But you can get biatch, merd, and zoot.
8800928	8801449	How about bish?
8801469	8801609	Bish.
8802717	8803358	I haven't tried it.
8803558	8808201	I did get, I got one of my characters, Bree, or one of my characters to say LOL butts.
8809201	8809862	I had to try that one.
8809922	8810883	Yeah, LOL butts.
8811483	8811863	Pretty good.
8812283	8815326	Surely you saw on Tumblr the person that named their town My Butt?
8815986	8816266	Yeah.
8816506	8817127	Hilarious.
8817567	8819688	This would be the best renovation in my butt.
8822676	8823857	He lives in my butt.
8825758	8826198	All right.
8826638	8827138	We're five.
8827298	8827538	Okay.
8828079	8829059	Let's get to the Skype line.
8829099	8830079	Let's open it up.
8830099	8833901	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8833921	8840404	If you'd like to give us a call and talk about whatever we've talked about tonight or maybe something different, we are open now for your calls.
8840804	8845166	We'll get to Twitter topics here in a minute if there's no calls coming in right away.
8846067	8849230	But first, Loki, I don't know if you have any last-minute stories you want to share with our listeners?
8850612	8852554	Just some stuff I saw online.
8853015	8861124	They've got a villager mod now for Skyrim, so you can play as the villager from Animal Crossing and murder people.
8861144	8862766	That's kind of awesome, actually.
8862786	8863567	In a creepy way.
8866029	8884955	so I'm going to point it out in chat there's going to be a 2D Mega Man game based off of Mega Man Legends 3 I know they've had quite a few Mega Man Legends based games they're a part of that you know that 100,000 for bringing back Mega Man thing I don't know um
8892998	8896161	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8913856	8915177	Meanwhile, I will move on.
8915297	8920018	Maybe Skype's having problems, though, because I know when Bobby tried to call us earlier, we didn't even show up on Skype.
8920318	8921739	I assure you we are on Skype.
8922699	8923659	Just call the name.
8924980	8935123	If it's not working, I guess you could send us a message, although please don't make 20 bazillion messages show up on my screen at once, because that really annoys me when people send me messages when I'm trying to do a show.
8935203	8936644	No offense.
8937524	8938004	Let's see.
8938865	8941906	I was going to get to Twitter topics, but I got sidetracked with a personal tweet.
8943707	8944367	Where am I here?
8944407	8944868	Rab.
8945308	8946869	I can't help it if I love Twitter.
8948051	8948431	Oh, yes.
8948571	8949031	Oh, God.
8949111	8950212	TigerClaw sent us one.
8950353	8952154	I know this is going to come up on Horde House this week.
8952535	8953716	TigerClaw sent us this tweet.
8953996	8957639	Blizzard exploring microtransactions for World of Warcraft.
8957919	8960382	He links us to an article on GameSpot, but I can summarize this.
8960722	8967108	They data mined an item in the latest patch of Warcraft that increases your experience gain by
8968809	8969670	and DarkSakura.com.
8985720	8991663	But I really hope Blizzard is either going to just say fuck it and go free-to-play, and they're not going to double-dip.
8991944	8993565	Because that is going to piss me off.
8994385	8997127	Like, if they try to double-dip, I'm done with WoW.
8997147	8998487	They got free-to-play to be interesting.
8998587	9007913	They are already walking a fine line, because you can't tell me they don't make some good money off of mounts, server transfers, faction changes, blah-de-blah-de-blah.
9008173	9011195	Like, they make a heck of a lot of good money off of that stuff, and...
9012075	9013497	They're already walking a fine line.
9013757	9021224	But the minute they start putting stuff in that enhances gameplay and gives people an edge as opposed to cosmetic stuff, I'm kind of over it.
9021324	9029051	And I know some WoW fans are looking forward to this, but I'm not willing to pay a sub fee and money for advantage gaining things on top of that.
9029091	9029672	That's too much.
9030132	9031093	Choose one model.
9031754	9032334	Go for it.
9032635	9035598	You don't get to do both, especially when your game is aging.
9038536	9066398	by the way I did get into the beta test of the new Battle.net launcher that was pretty cool I will say the new Battle.net launcher that has all the games in there and you can just like it actually I'm going to spoil something that's going to come up on this week's Horde House but oh well don't tell so we talked about it a little bit in last week's show I guess after last week's show Grandpa like side loaded Starcraft because you can get the free version of Starcraft right there in the launcher he ended up buying it and the expansion he enjoyed the little free version of it so much he bought the whole thing wow
9068259	9072120	Battle.net Launcher Justified Final Fantasy XIV No Grinding Rep No Grinding Rep
9093348	9094888	Alright, let's see what else I have here.
9095268	9099269	Oh, Actdeft tweeted us and says, After the Atari talk, I went and found my 2600.
9099950	9102110	Don't know if it works, though.
9102150	9106371	Actually, that joystick you have, though, looks like my old Commodore 64 joystick.
9106591	9120855	Also, if I may say, because he messaged me on Twitter, I won't give any more information than this, but Micah is who I spoke to at Atari Party, who had the Japanese 3DS, and very, very cool.
9122178	9124371	Very lucky kids having a cool dad like that, so...
9125550	9131395	Spazernator PSN tweets us saying we need VOG Magic 2013 or 2014 game night on Steam.
9131735	9133757	He's been trying to whore that game left and right.
9133797	9135018	He must really love that game.
9135318	9136339	What is the next game night?
9136379	9137340	Have you picked something yet, Loki?
9137560	9137980	Oh, God.
9138020	9140622	I keep... What is that?
9141303	9145346	Last or this Friday, it was a little big plant card game.
9145366	9146367	There was nobody on.
9146527	9148208	And last week, I mean, honestly, I forgot.
9148248	9149950	But I don't even know.
9150210	9152152	I don't know what we're going to do for next week.
9152272	9154834	And I don't even know if we're going to continue doing it because I'm just...
9155354	9158216	I'm... Participation's not at a level you need to be at.
9158236	9164639	Well, it's participation, and on top of that... Well, it's because Bobby's PS3 broke, so we at least have two.
9165320	9173104	But no, honestly, it was like we got home late, and by the time I got Josh in bed, it was like 9 o'clock, and so it's just... Friday's a rough night.
9173164	9173664	It's tough.
9173845	9176826	It's just... I wouldn't mind if you did VOG game night during Horde House.
9176966	9179848	If you wanted to do Wednesday, I wouldn't mind that, actually.
9179868	9181629	Because we could hop in as soon as we're done.
9182069	9183790	I do still stream Mass Effect 3 on Thursdays.
9183871	9185332	I just didn't because it was the 4th.
9185812	9186833	I don't know.
9186953	9191556	It's hard to pick a game that everybody has and something we can consistently play.
9192357	9193878	I'll have to think about it a little bit more.
9195980	9197741	It's too bad Minecraft wasn't free to play.
9197801	9199903	I was going to say, we need to do a Minecraft night.
9199943	9200503	I'm kind of surprised.
9200523	9201904	I have the server access stuff.
9201944	9209270	I just haven't gone around to updating the server and getting what mods we want in there.
9209790	9237258	but they have horses now and you can put horse armor on them so hey, horses I want guinea pig armor I will point out we have a VOG community in the Steam group and to be fair we have an OLR community on Steam too but I'm saying VOG because I'm trying to grow that one for all the shows because I need people to trade cards with so if you want to trade some cards you want to throw down and trade some cards get in that VOG community and let's trade some cards for what games do you need cards?
9237518	9240219	I need two more for Super Meat Boy, but I have nothing to trade yet.
9240239	9244840	Well, I have Fairy Solitaire, like one Fairy Solitaire card I have dupes of that I'm willing to trade at this point.
9245060	9246521	Because I don't want to trade it if I don't have dupes.
9246981	9248641	Ask me again when I start getting booster packs.
9250222	9251662	I guess I'll have to start playing.
9251682	9252302	There you go.
9252322	9253363	Where's the list for this stuff?
9253423	9253903	Atta boy.
9254203	9254663	Atta boy.
9254683	9255923	I guess I'll have to start playing.
9255943	9258464	Because I haven't played Super Meat Boy yet, and I have it, but I just haven't.
9258544	9258764	All right.
9258784	9259185	All right.
9288287	9290689	I'll tell you some more stuff about that off air that I think you'll enjoy.
9293491	9294232	Nobody's calling in?
9294252	9294752	That's really weird.
9294792	9296994	I wonder if Skype is screwing up something.
9297094	9298575	It's probably Skype.
9298776	9301698	Yeah, because Bobby was having those problems earlier where he didn't even see us.
9302178	9308523	I'm going to call the nice British lady on Skype just to make sure it's working.
9309404	9309924	Just testing.
9309944	9312206	Hello, welcome to Skype core testing service.
9312286	9313707	Alright, yeah, we got it, we got it, we're good.
9314744	9324320	Hello It is the 4th of July weekend Our chat's got 61 people in it right now Are any of them trying to call?
9324758	9325018	I don't know.
9325038	9326679	Yeah, is anyone... No, nobody's complaining.
9327199	9328500	Maybe there's just nothing to say tonight.
9328580	9328900	I don't know.
9329880	9331821	Or every gamer has a voice, but not tonight.
9332021	9332501	That's cool.
9332521	9333342	We can go home early.
9333422	9333982	That's fine.
9334862	9336643	I can start playing that Super Meat Boy.
9336843	9337964	There you go.
9338024	9338704	Alright, fine.
9338964	9339264	Fine.
9339584	9342886	Since you guys don't want to call in, we will go off and earn our trading cards.
9345727	9347468	I'll make the grudge noise until someone calls.
9347528	9348208	No, God no.
9348268	9348968	I'll end the show.
9350089	9350549	End the show.
9350729	9351249	Turn off your mic.
9354295	9355976	Oh, look, look, look, it's finally lighting up.
9356256	9358558	Somebody's taking pity on this program.
9358998	9360018	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
9360038	9360479	Who's this?
9361119	9362340	It is Brad from PodCulture.
9362500	9363821	Hey, Brad, how you doing?
9364441	9365302	Oh, peach again.
9365422	9374427	Oh, and of course, now that you called, like the minute DarkSakura started making noises, as soon as DarkSakura started making noises, my screen is full of calls.
9374987	9376268	Please stop, please stop.
9376888	9377209	What?
9377229	9378209	Somebody had to call.
9378569	9379470	Somebody had to call.
9381570	9381930	Well, good.
9382150	9382710	You know what?
9382770	9394173	We don't promote the fine show that is pod culture here on the show enough, and you do so much for our program, and you've done a lot for Horde House that I'm always happy to sit down and talk with you for a minute about.
9394233	9396074	What's going on in pod culture?
9396714	9399275	Well, outside of Cat the Game this week.
9399735	9399975	Yeah?
9402136	9405016	Been playing a lot of the 3DS this week.
9405416	9405957	Oh, yes.
9406377	9408437	You got sucked into the animal cracking, didn't you?
9408737	9409278	Yes, I did.
9409798	9410098	Damn it.
9410278	9410798	Congrats.
9412262	9414663	playing that, and LEGO City Undercover.
9415543	9416183	Oh, how's that?
9416823	9417723	It's a lot of fun.
9417783	9419624	It's Grand Theft Auto with LEGOs.
9419864	9420224	It's great.
9422084	9423044	That sounds kind of fun.
9423184	9424745	All the LEGO games are pretty much the same.
9425245	9428265	I'm surprised Loki is not all over that game if it's Grand Theft Auto.
9428285	9429626	You could teach Josh on that.
9429746	9435847	It was going to be a game that was going to sell me the console, but I looked at it and I'm like, no, no.
9435927	9436567	It's a lot of fun.
9438778	9439719	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9463655	9465076	Well, I am going to let you guys go.
9465136	9467479	I just wanted to see if I could actually get in.
9468560	9468860	No problem.
9468880	9474966	Hey, before you go, before you hang up and go, tell us a little bit about PodCulture, your show that's on Mondays at 6 o'clock on the network.
9477168	9479149	Just four geeks sitting around shooting the shit.
9480190	9480791	Good times.
9481151	9485836	You guys also do once a month lately, or at least for this year, you're doing Doctor Who-based specials, right?
9486376	9489079	Yeah, it's kind of a sideshow for us.
9489379	9499950	I have another couple of friends that come in, and we just talk Doctor Who on our Tartars Interruptus episodes, and we thought for, hey, 2013, it's the 50th anniversary of Doctor Who.
9500110	9504254	We do a show for every Doctor each month, and that's kind of what we've been doing.
9504978	9505298	All right.
9505418	9506538	Love it and love your show.
9506558	9509719	And thanks so much for the support and for calling in when nobody else would, Brad.
9509819	9510359	Appreciate it.
9510559	9511019	Later, guys.
9511039	9511499	Take care, buddy.
9512640	9515040	You could tell he just wanted to call in because he felt bad.
9515520	9516480	I appreciate that, Brad.
9517361	9520361	Black Wolf giving us a little last-minute late-breaking story in the chat room.
9520741	9523422	Infinity Blade 2 free in the App Store right now.
9523922	9528583	If you want to go just tag that on your iPhone or iPad or whatever iDevice you're using.
9530646	9533588	I don't know if you touched this story today or tonight.
9533608	9533988	Iwata...
9557850	9560412	Telling people why he doesn't lay off people?
9562073	9564876	No, we didn't touch on that, but I read about that.
9564976	9566697	Please go ahead and share that with the listeners.
9568699	9584672	Basically, Iwata said to some reporters, I don't remember who exactly, but they asked him because, well, you know, Nintendo is in the best financial position right now, that why they don't lay off people.
9585432	9587534	So he basically says that
9587864	9598230	Laying off people would lower the morale of the rest and would produce not-quality games, basically.
9598570	9611618	And I admire that because even despite the financial problems Nintendo has right now, not laying off people just because they want to produce quality stuff
9613463	9618244	I don't know if it's fair to say Nintendo has quote financial problems either.
9618344	9622945	I know that's what a lot of people out on the internet are saying, but Nintendo's got a shit ton of cash in the bank.
9622965	9624846	They made a lot of money on the Wii.
9624906	9627026	The 3DS is still crazy good for them.
9627366	9629327	Is the Wii U living up to expectations?
9629667	9629907	No.
9630227	9634388	But is it, you know, an epic loss of biblical proportions?
9634408	9634468	No.
9634788	9635309	Not yet.
9635389	9636970	Let's see where they're at after this holiday.
9637250	9642955	But I love that Iwata gets that, you know, I could lay people off, but that's only going to help the short-term numbers, not the long-term numbers.
9643235	9645477	If I lay people off, where are the people to make games?
9647518	9647899	Indeed.
9648199	9648659	I love it.
9648899	9662030	And especially because I think it was last year that he cut his salary by half.
9664319	9668900	and other people in Nintendo at the higher staff.
9670740	9690264	That was pretty cool of him and the rest of the Nintendo staff too because despite what happens in Senga or other gaming companies, it's cool that people at Nintendo, at least in Japan, know if the same happens here in America.
9691243	9697370	that they have at least a secure job there.
9698791	9700253	They don't have to worry about
9700983	9705944	Just because they are not making any money or just because.
9722569	9750431	layoffs are inevitable as part of the ebb and flow of the industry but it's nice to know that Nintendo is not like that's not the first option on the top of their list and unfortunately for some executives that's usually the first thing considered yeah it's really the executives that should be taking the pay cut because they're the ones that are making the decisions that are leading to the bad but again Nintendo did so hate on Nintendo all you want but it's pretty hard to get mad at this I just wish other people would follow that example you know
9752162	9753847	Actdeft, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?
9755111	9755793	No, that's all.
9755873	9757458	Basically, goodbye, Iwata.
9758401	9758742	What's that?
9759773	9788346	Good guy, Iwata Oh yeah, good, oh yes Good on you, a thumbs up for you, Iwata Alright, and a thumbs up for you too, Actdeft I appreciate the phone call, you take care, buddy You too, thanks Bye, and have fun with that Atari 2600 Hope it works I will, I try Hope it works, bye I don't know how easy it is to find Atari 2600 games in Mexico, Actdeft But if you go to flea markets here in the US They're all over the place I probably have spares I could send you
9789319	9791381	You can't find a copy of Combat somewhere?
9792161	9793762	You're saying you can't find a copy of Combat?
9794122	9794383	All right.
9795183	9797265	Sadly, we are going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.
9797305	9799166	I'm sorry to those that didn't get through, but you know what?
9799186	9801728	You should have called when you had the chance.
9802088	9802908	Appreciate it, though.
9803269	9809193	You can always send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you'd like to send us an email for consideration for next week.
9809853	9811814	But in the meantime, I think we're going to go ahead and wrap up the show.
9812975	9817318	Dark Sakura, sorry you couldn't be here for the whole show tonight, but I'm glad you had fun at Atari Party.
9817478	9827089	I really rushed it and we finally actually ended up cutting out six houses so that we could go look at this one because I'd had my eye on it the whole time and it turns out to be the one.
9827289	9827530	Nice.
9827970	9829772	Have a mountain of fun at California Extreme.
9830413	9831274	I wish you could come.
9831414	9832836	Get us some more listeners for the show.
9833316	9834438	I've been spreading the news.
9834598	9835198	Appreciate it.
9836140	9838262	And do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
9839249	9841431	I hate my lungs and I want this house.
9842732	9843072	Good luck.
9843953	9845014	Loki, your final thought tonight.
9846775	9848817	I don't know.
9850298	9854321	I learned a lot about the Renswick A2 pin setter this week.
9856463	9859365	And my final thought tonight is trading cards.
9860206	9861927	Give me all your trading cards.

9927495	9928015	A few hundred.

9934057	9937978	DarkSakura will have a report from California Extreme if I find a way to sneak over there.
9938678	9941259	And hopefully Dan will join us for that one.
9941339	9942740	Yeah, he was going to be here tonight.
9942760	9948421	He was, but he actually got called in to do inventory at work and we've been crunching his numbers actually.
9948441	9952503	I would have been here slightly bit earlier if it wasn't that I was checking on what the taxes are on that house.
9952683	9953003	Gotcha.
9953385	9958087	Well, I look forward to hopefully having him here next week because we've had a lot of fun guests lately.
