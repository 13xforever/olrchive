7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	19000	Tonight, July 7th, 2013, two gaming companies find themselves hacked this week.
19000	24000	Xbox One reputation system matching hopes to group trolls with trolls.
24000	28000	And we find out why the Wii Vitality sensor disappeared.
28000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	44000	It's Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 511 for July the 7th, 2013.
44000	51000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here to join you over the next couple hours to talk about video games and gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, all things gaming
51000	59000	with you guys in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and as well as my co-host, one just one right now in studio.
59000	61000	Say hello to Loki, Techmaster Loki here tonight.
61000	62000	Hello.
62000	63000	How are you doing, Loki?
63000	64000	I'm doing fine.
64000	65000	Yeah?
65000	70000	I, I, my decision to not get fries was, it paid off, I think.
70000	74000	Yes, you made a, you made a little fast food decision tonight, right?
74000	80000	Well, yeah, cause I normally go to like fast food and stuff and a lot of times, especially in the evenings and even sometimes during, you know, the lunch hours and stuff,
80000	86000	like you go to like McDonald's or something like that and their fries are good when, when they're good.
86000	93000	But there's such a small margin of when they are able to make them good versus just being crap.
93000	96000	And a lot of times, especially at dinner time, it's just, it's garbage.
96000	99000	It's just not good at all.
99000	106000	So I decided, hey, you know, instead of getting like a double quarter pounder meal large and that kind of stuff and paying like eight bucks,
106000	111000	I just got two double cheeseburgers and no fries and just a large drink.
111000	116000	And then that ended up being like three bucks and I'm just as full from it.
116000	119000	So I think that's the way to go.
119000	121000	There you go. Saving money, right?
121000	122000	Exactly.
122000	125000	And then you don't have crappy, soggy french fries, but I'll tell you what's even worse.
125000	127000	Yes, we do talk about fast food occasionally on the show.
127000	128000	You know what?
128000	129000	It is what it is.
129000	131000	It is part of the gamer lifestyle.
131000	136000	Well, if you want to believe, I mean, Mountain Dew and Doritos isn't exactly fast food, but, you know, you get the idea.
136000	142000	But, okay, so the other, just the other day I go to Carl's Jr., which I don't think they have on the East Coast.
142000	145000	I think they call it Hardee's. It's really all the same thing, right?
145000	151000	So I go there and I get my meal and I get Alan's thing. He gets a combo with fries.
151000	154000	I always get Chris cut fries with my sandwich because I love their Chris cut fries.
154000	155000	They're the bomb.
155000	159000	They're like, you know, they're even better than like the waffle fries and other chains and so forth.
159000	160000	Like, I love them.
160000	163000	So I get the fries and I can, like, smell them in the bag.
163000	165000	I'm like, mmm, smells like french fries, right?
165000	166000	Smells so good.
166000	167000	I get all the way home, open the bag.
167000	169000	They gave me regular fries instead of Chris cut fries.
169000	173000	Like, the one reason I go to Carl's Jr., denied.
173000	174000	So mad.
174000	176000	It's like you want to just drive back to the building and scream at somebody.
176000	178000	Some poor guy who made a mistake.
178000	181000	But I'm just too lazy and I ate the fries anyway.
181000	182000	What can you do?
182000	184000	What can you do?
184000	186000	All right.
186000	187000	Go to our chat room.
187000	191000	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
191000	193000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
193000	194000	The Voice of the Geeks Network.
194000	196000	Live.vognetwork.com.
196000	199000	Queen Simeon chat says, is that what Carl's Jr. is?
199000	201000	Yes, it's pretty much Hardee's.
201000	203000	Some people that have had both tell me they're different, but they're...
203000	205000	I think they serve different things.
205000	206000	Like, their menu's slightly different.
206000	208000	But it's pretty much the same.
208000	210000	They were selling, like, Hardee's biscuits here at one point.
210000	211000	I don't know.
211000	212000	It's interesting how all that stuff...
212000	214000	Just put the same menu on there.
214000	219000	It's not like people, like, on the East Coast eat so much different things than the people on the West Coast.
219000	221000	It's not all that...
221000	223000	It's interesting how fast food really varies.
223000	228000	It's not like, you know, we're in Hawaii where, you know, beef is not plentiful and there is a lot of spam.
228000	230000	But, you know, it's just...
230000	235000	I don't understand why it has to be that different when you have a chain that's on both sides of...
235000	238000	Well, and I don't understand why they just won't put In-N-Outs on the East Coast.
238000	241000	Because anytime I have a friend from about...
241000	242000	What's the furthest In-N-Out goes out?
242000	243000	I think Texas now.
243000	248000	So anything further east than Texas, if they come out here to visit or whatever, it's like, we gotta go to In-N-Out.
248000	249000	We gotta go have In-N-Out.
249000	253000	It's a good fast food burger, don't get me wrong.
253000	256000	But, you know, I'm like, God, why don't they open one up in New York already?
256000	259000	It's just wanting to get the franchise.
259000	262000	They're just like, why do we have Dunkin' Donuts over here?
262000	263000	Amen to that.
263000	265000	But, I mean, I don't know.
265000	268000	There's a lot of reasons, I guess.
268000	273000	It's just whether people want to franchise something like that far away.
273000	275000	I don't know. I thought it'd be kind of cool.
275000	277000	People are always shocked when I tell them we don't have Dunkin' Donuts here.
277000	279000	We do not have Dunkin' Donuts here, people.
279000	282000	Which sucks because I love their coffee.
282000	287000	I would go there as opposed to Starbucks if I could, even though it's so terrible for you.
287000	289000	It's so good. I can't help it.
289000	292000	Every time I travel, I have to get a Dunkin' Coffee. It's so good.
292000	295000	And then I can't resist and have one of those coconut donuts, too.
295000	299000	Alright, it is a show about video games, and I'm sure you're all wondering,
299000	302000	where is the lovely Dark Sakura? Why didn't you introduce her?
302000	306000	Dark Sakura is running a little late tonight, so she will be here during the show
306000	308000	because it is about a three-hour show.
308000	310000	We're anticipating her arrival in about an hour.
310000	315000	The only bummer is that she was going to kick off the show with her talk about Atari Party,
315000	317000	which is a local event here in Davis.
317000	322000	And, bummer, I really wanted to go, but it conflicted with something else I have for
322000	325000	rehearsals for something coming up, so I couldn't go to Atari Party.
325000	329000	But she went, Dan went, I think Dan is coming here with her.
329000	333000	So they're going to talk about Atari and all the classic things that they saw this week,
333000	339000	which I love that stuff because Atari 2600 really was my first gaming system.
339000	343000	Even though I show Commodore 64 a lot of love on this show, and rightly so,
343000	345000	Atari 2600 really was my first gaming system.
345000	348000	Like, you know, I have very fond memories being five years old
348000	352000	and playing the Spider-Man Atari 2600 video game on my mom's TV,
352000	357000	which was just like this little dude that had a red top and blue tights to look like Spider-Man.
357000	361000	You could shoot a web up and you climbed up a building, basically.
361000	363000	I remember there was something with the windows.
363000	365000	There was either bad guys in windows or people you rescued in windows.
365000	367000	I don't remember. It's been so long since I played.
367000	369000	But, yeah, I used to play that Spider-Man game.
369000	372000	Did you play Atari 2600 growing up?
372000	376000	No, I didn't have a 2600.
376000	381000	Well, my friends did, but I had a ColecoVision with an Atari adapter.
381000	386000	So I had Atari games, but it wasn't necessarily playing through the Atari system.
386000	390000	It was that weird adapter that they had.
390000	391000	I didn't even know they had an adapter.
391000	394000	Yeah, it was in that really awkward like,
394000	400000	hey, that's kind of infringing on our copyrights type thing, but who cares?
400000	401000	I don't have anything to do with copyrights.
401000	402000	I just play the game.
402000	407000	You ever go back and play the old stuff now, like emulators and so forth?
407000	408000	See, here's the weird thing for me.
408000	411000	The weird thing about when I play this stuff on emulators is that
411000	416000	my gaming attention deficit disorder, which is totally a legit thing I have,
416000	418000	gets even worse.
418000	423000	You'll load up an emulated game and I'll play it for literally 15 seconds.
423000	425000	Then it says, oh, onto a new game, oh, onto a new game.
425000	427000	It's like, I'm going to try everything at the buffet.
427000	429000	But there's something different about doing that
429000	434000	versus going to sit and play at the TV and force yourself to sit there at the TV,
434000	437000	even if it's, and I know this is really weird,
437000	440000	even if it's emulated on the TV like Xbox Game Room.
440000	441000	Perfect example, right?
441000	444000	Loads of Atari 200 games on Xbox Game Room.
444000	446000	But that shit can hold my attention for a lot longer.
446000	452000	Like playing something like Stampede, which is a grossly simple game, right?
452000	456000	It's just like wrangle up the cows and don't let them get past the left side of the screen.
456000	459000	Like I could sit there and play that shit forever and keep trying to beat my high score and stuff,
459000	463000	but when I'm playing it in emulators, it's like, board now, switch, board now, switch.
463000	467000	I remember we played the ColecoVision version of Smurfs
467000	471000	and we cycled through the whole game like about 20 times one time.
471000	474000	It's just like, it just keeps going. It's funny.
474000	480000	Just this week on, or no, it wasn't this week, but a couple weeks ago on Virtual Console for Wii U,
480000	483000	Mario Brothers came out, and I'm not talking Super Mario Brothers.
483000	488000	I mean, the original Mario Brothers, which was that one static screen with the pipes and the turtles and the crabs,
488000	493000	that was on Atari 2600, and we used to play the shit out of that.
493000	496000	My best friend in like second grade and I would play that all the time.
496000	499000	Thanks to the DS, I'm so burnt out on that game.
499000	501000	I remember when Mario Brothers was just like,
501000	505000	Hey, it comes with Mario Brothers, every single Mario game that's on the DS comes with Mario Brothers.
505000	508000	You can play with your friends, you know, with the Game Share thing because it comes with Mario Brothers.
508000	511000	It's like, dude, I don't need to play this game anymore.
511000	514000	You put it on every single cartridge.
514000	517000	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com,
517000	521000	Bobby Blackwolf, our pal from his show that's on right before us here at VOG Network says,
521000	528000	Oink, I loved Oink. I loved that game too, but it's really only good to me as a two player game
528000	532000	because if I remember right, I don't remember if it was a really advertised feature,
532000	536000	but you could plug in a second joystick and the second person could be the big bad wolf.
536000	539000	And it wasn't in all the Activision collections.
539000	545000	Like it wasn't in some of the ones I remember picking up, but that was a great game on the 2600.
545000	551000	Remember when Activision was like the best games on the system back in the 2600 days?
551000	556000	Dungeon Buster says, H-E-R-O was also fun. That's one of my all time favorite 2600 games.
556000	561000	I grew up on that with the Commodore 64 first, which has like really improved graphics.
561000	563000	That game was kind of awesome.
563000	568000	S-H-A-100 Matt says, See, I have gamer ADD, but I have a hard time with MMOs because of it.
568000	571000	I wonder how Rob is able to play MMOs with it.
571000	577000	The social element of MMOs makes it a lot like you want to improve your character
577000	581000	so you can go on adventures with friends like you.
581000	584000	The motivation of having friends to play with is huge.
584000	588000	Like I can sit there on MMO and be chatting on Skype and it's a much kind of different experience
588000	591000	than just kind of like a single player with emulators.
591000	593000	Does that make sense?
593000	597000	I have found lately a lot of my friends are leaving World of Warcraft.
597000	601000	Almost all of my co-hosts on Horde House have left Warcraft.
601000	605000	The one that still plays, Grandpa, plays with his cousins or his family or something now
605000	607000	so he doesn't really play with me anymore.
607000	609000	I had a couple friends that were playing for a week.
609000	615000	Not a lot of people I know are playing it anymore and it's sad because it really kills my motivation to play.
615000	619000	And there's still a couple people that play and I have some friends in Canada that play
619000	623000	and I really like them and I like talking to them but they're the only ones anymore that are playing
623000	628000	and it makes it really hard to motivate myself to kind of get on and you don't want to do anything
628000	630000	because I'm like, eh, what am I doing?
630000	634000	I'm doing a daily dungeon, pew pew, alliance is dead, wah, moving on to something else.
634000	638000	I'm falling behind on all these single player games because of the MMOs.
638000	644000	Yeah, that's the thing. It's like there's all these other games and those MMOs take so much of your time
644000	648000	that it's just hard to justify wanting to play them.
648000	652000	Tigerclaw in chat says, I bet they left WoW to play Marvel Heroes.
652000	660000	Not my co-host on Horde House so much but Captain Spike I don't think would mind me outing him from Game Buoy.
660000	665000	We were playing WoW and he's been playing Marvel Heroes a lot lately which we all played one night.
665000	669000	It was a lot of fun and now Alan got Marvel Heroes too so I don't know.
669000	674000	That is kind of a thing that's happening right now is Marvel Heroes but for how long?
674000	678000	Until Final Fantasy XIV comes out in its full form I'm sure.
678000	681000	Because every beta weekend for Final Fantasy XIV has been kind of that.
681000	685000	But even Final Fantasy XIV I kind of hit a wall with this week.
685000	689000	I hit one of those single player, I know I'm getting into my gaming week a little bit but oh well.
689000	693000	I hit one of those single player missions you have to do in Final Fantasy XIV and it was kind of like,
693000	696000	I just kind of got frustrated with it and I was like, you know what?
696000	702000	I'm going to go play some single player games I need to catch up on because I have extensively beta tested this game.
702000	704000	I've given my feedback. What am I doing?
704000	710000	I'm getting frustrated over this quest where my character is just going to get wiped in a couple days anyway when the next beta phase begins.
710000	716000	So I'm going to wait at this point for the non-erased character beta which is the next open beta.
716000	719000	The characters you create in open beta will carry over to the live game.
719000	722000	So I'm just waiting for that at this point.
722000	727000	I, uh, that game man, I don't know.
727000	734000	I was playing it yesterday and it's just one of those things like, you know, I leveled up to 11.
734000	741000	And I've been basically soloing everything because I don't know how to party and everybody that we kind of talk to,
741000	746000	they're never on or I don't see them or I don't have them friended or something.
746000	751000	And so it's like, well this is kind of okay I guess.
751000	756000	And then at the same time I'm like, I don't know if I want to keep playing this because I know I'm not going to play this in the future.
756000	761000	Then at the same time I'm like, well I kind of want to play it, but at the same time I don't want to play it.
761000	765000	Because there are all these good games that I want to come out, you know, Grand Theft Auto for sure.
765000	769000	I mean, I want to play that more online than I want to play Final Fantasy.
769000	775000	But, you know, I like Final Fantasy, it's just, I don't know, I'm torn.
775000	780000	A lot of people talking, about one million people registered for Final Fantasy XIV beta.
780000	784000	It's going to be very interesting to see how that goes over once the sub-fee is kicking.
784000	790000	Because I think a lot of people are just playing it as a demo right now, but sub-fees means, you know, you got to pay up if you want to keep going.
790000	792000	We'll see, it's going to be interesting.
792000	800000	Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Raginator in chat says, Rob Roberts, I'm probably in the minority here, but I always thought that Game Room was underappreciated.
800000	801000	I love it.
801000	805000	Raginator, have you heard the show? I was a huge proponent of Game Room. I loved it.
805000	811000	I was, I'm actually like legit pissed off that Microsoft really dropped the ball with it.
811000	814000	And, you know, they let everybody go at Chrome and all that stuff.
814000	819000	Like, it actually pissed me off that they were out there promising thousands of games and nothing ever came of that.
819000	824000	Because Game Room, Game Room did what Virtual Console needs to do.
824000	830000	I realized when it came to setting up your little rooms and so forth, that that feature was a little bit gimped.
830000	835000	But whatever, when it came to the game playing itself, the live leaderboards was great.
835000	837000	The replays was great.
837000	840000	Being able to send challenges to your friends was great.
840000	846000	Like, that's all stuff that Nintendo's Virtual Console would greatly benefit from and would have a great enhanced value from.
846000	850000	And it's a great way to modernize classic games.
850000	856000	And I realized there's purists out there that are like, you know what, nothing matches the old school.
856000	863000	Get my Atari 2600 with its coaxial cable to a TV that won't even get channels anymore because of the digital switch.
863000	865000	And I totally respect that.
865000	871000	And that's totally part of the point of a thing like Atari Party is for like-minded people to get together and play that stuff, I'm sure.
871000	874000	Or at least Jamie can give us insight to that later.
874000	879000	But I liked Game Room as a modern experience of classic games.
879000	884000	And I'm really pissed that Microsoft didn't try to invest a little more into it.
884000	888000	I can't imagine it was this horrific expense.
888000	890000	Like, they weren't writing new games.
890000	895000	Now, granted, they were probably having to go back and tweak an awful lot to get them to work and so forth.
895000	899000	But really, were they just not selling anything?
899000	902000	Then, I don't know, maybe there's other questions you need to ask yourself.
902000	905000	But yeah, I was a huge proponent of Game Room.
905000	907000	And I'm pissed it didn't work.
907000	910000	And I'm pissed we probably won't get anything like it on Xbox One.
910000	914000	Or anything. You know? It sucks.
914000	918000	I'm surprised we haven't seen PlayStation Home on the PlayStation 4.
918000	923000	Like, I would have thought that would have been kind of cool to step up everything.
923000	928000	Or maybe they just didn't really work out, I guess.
928000	930000	They didn't do what they wanted to do with it.
930000	935000	Well, PlayStation Home definitely has its cult...
935000	938000	I'm not saying that in a negative context. Like a cult movie.
938000	942000	PlayStation Home has its cult following.
942000	944000	And we've had some of that on this show.
944000	946000	We participated with one of the home events.
946000	948000	It was a lot of fun to see that community.
948000	953000	You're right. It is weird that they didn't mention that going to the PlayStation 4.
953000	957000	I don't know if... I would have thought it was profitable enough with the microtransactions and everything.
957000	961000	It was basically Second Life on a console and it seemed to be doing well enough in itself.
961000	964000	But do you think that maybe they could...
964000	966000	Well, I guess not because of the chipset.
966000	971000	I was thinking in my mind, could they just carry PlayStation Home over to PlayStation 4?
971000	973000	But I guess not for the same reason it's not backwards compatible.
973000	975000	They changed the core chipset.
975000	977000	Yeah, maybe streaming. Who knows?
977000	979000	Alright, well anyhow.
979000	983000	That was a very random potpourri sort of kickoff topic.
983000	986000	But let's talk about the video games that we've actually been playing this week.
986000	988000	Besides just Final Fantasy XIV, apparently.
988000	991000	Loki, how was your gaming week? What have you been playing?
991000	995000	Final Fantasy XIV. Unfortunately, that's all that I played this week.
995000	1001000	Just... I only played a few hours of it, actually.
1001000	1004000	Just the other day, just leveling my Thaumaturge.
1004000	1007000	And I kept trying to solo stuff.
1007000	1011000	It's so really weird how you can party but not party.
1011000	1013000	People can help you.
1013000	1017000	If you're fighting something, someone else can join in and fight the same monster.
1017000	1019000	And you still get the experience from it.
1019000	1021000	Even though you're not partying.
1021000	1024000	Which is odd. I don't know why they have that.
1024000	1026000	But it's neat.
1027000	1029000	It is a little frustrating.
1029000	1033000	There was a monster chasing somebody and I was trying to pull it off of them.
1033000	1036000	And the monster was invulnerable.
1036000	1041000	And it got in this weird loop where he would run towards me and then run away.
1041000	1044000	And then he'd run back towards me and then run away.
1044000	1048000	And kind of kept going that way back and forth.
1048000	1050000	I guess that was a bug or something.
1050000	1052000	Yeah, it's a beta. It might have been a bug.
1052000	1054000	But I've seen the invulnerable thing happen.
1055000	1058000	Like when the person who pulled it loses all the threat.
1058000	1060000	Like they run out of range or whatever.
1060000	1063000	The mob retreats and during that time it's invincible.
1063000	1065000	Same thing happens in WoW actually.
1065000	1067000	It'll evade in WoW.
1067000	1068000	It's kind of nice.
1068000	1071000	The only thing I don't like about that though is I'll try to pull a mob.
1071000	1075000	And then try to use the landscape at my advantage.
1075000	1077000	And it wasn't even that far away.
1077000	1080000	I was on a bridge and I was trying to attack fish.
1080000	1084000	And the fish couldn't figure out how to turn the corner to the bridge or something.
1084000	1086000	And so it kept going invulnerable.
1086000	1090000	And I couldn't do any damage to it even though I was well within range.
1090000	1093000	It's just stupid I guess.
1093000	1095000	I don't know. It was kind of annoying.
1095000	1097000	Did you play around with any of the crafting professions?
1097000	1098000	No.
1098000	1099000	I did a little bit of that this week.
1099000	1100000	That's interesting.
1100000	1101000	It's different.
1101000	1104000	It's not just put the pieces together and craft.
1104000	1109000	There's a little bit of strategy that comes into play on will you get a high quality item or not.
1109000	1110000	How does that work?
1110000	1114000	Your item as you craft it has durability.
1114000	1117000	And so let's say you'll get four attempts.
1117000	1119000	You can do four moves on it.
1119000	1122000	And you can either craft and it might take two of your attempts to craft it.
1122000	1131000	But as you level in a profession you'll get things that are like you get a 70% chance to enhance the percentage of possibility it will be a high quality item.
1131000	1136000	Or you get a move that will restore all of the durability but at great cost.
1136000	1144000	It's just interesting. All your abilities become part of the balancing game of trying to craft the item without breaking it and losing all your stuff.
1144000	1147000	It's not just throw them all together and click craft.
1147000	1149000	I like that they changed it up a little.
1149000	1159000	Yeah I was just basically doing the regular quests in the game and then just grinding I guess.
1159000	1161000	I mean that's really all I could do.
1162000	1167000	I went back into town to get some more quests because the storyline doesn't seem to be progressing.
1167000	1170000	Because I'm not sure maybe I'm just not doing something right.
1170000	1173000	Let's be honest I'm not really reading any of the story either.
1173000	1179000	I'm just skipping through all of it because if they really want me to pay attention to something they'll have a cutscene.
1179000	1181000	It ends up happening usually.
1181000	1184000	I still know what the story is and I don't really care.
1185000	1188000	I just want to get to a point where...
1188000	1190000	I don't know if it's just in the beta.
1190000	1194000	I guess if you get to a certain point where you're level 20 you can actually level all your other subs to 15.
1194000	1196000	That'll only be in the beta but yes.
1196000	1199000	And probably not carrying over to open beta.
1199000	1201000	Oh well.
1201000	1205000	But once you get to level 15 they did finally implement the duty finder.
1205000	1208000	Not duty finder but duty finder.
1208000	1210000	Which basically they're looking for group tool.
1210000	1212000	So you can do dungeons and that fun stuff.
1212000	1215000	Which wasn't really a thing in Final Fantasy XI.
1215000	1217000	But that's a huge wow thing obviously.
1217000	1219000	I haven't really explored too far either.
1219000	1222000	I've just been around the town so I don't know how to get anywhere.
1222000	1225000	Oh yeah you gotta get out there and explore.
1225000	1227000	Well everything's trying to kill me.
1227000	1230000	Keep doing story quests and around level 15 you get an airship pass.
1230000	1232000	And you go to the other towns as part of a quest.
1232000	1234000	It's pretty cool.
1234000	1236000	Alright well if that's it for your gaming week.
1236000	1239000	I'll talk about my gaming week a little bit besides Final Fantasy XIV.
1239000	1242000	I kind of just needed a break from MMOs this week.
1242000	1245000	I played Final Fantasy XIV extensively on Friday and Saturday.
1245000	1247000	But then I needed a break.
1247000	1249000	So I played some other stuff.
1249000	1252000	On Wii U Virtual Console I played Mario Brothers as I talked about before.
1252000	1256000	I also played Pilot Wings because that came out on Virtual Console on July 4th.
1256000	1261000	And who did not love the game that was made basically to show off Mode 7.
1261000	1263000	And it was a great game.
1263000	1265000	Who doesn't love Rocket Bell?
1265000	1267000	What is it called? Rocket Pack? Rocket Bell?
1267000	1271000	That's a lot of fun to play as skydiving and all that stuff.
1271000	1274000	And making the characters really angry or upset when you do really bad.
1274000	1277000	But yeah the Mode 7 is fun.
1277000	1283000	One thing that at least the Wii U Virtual Console does that the Wii Virtual Console didn't do.
1283000	1286000	Is that you can take the screenshots and post them to Miiverse.
1286000	1291000	And now as of like the end of June you can post those Miiverse posts to Twitter and stuff.
1291000	1293000	So I've been doing that a little bit at my Twitter.
1294000	1299000	If I can talk. Twitter.com slash S-K-I-E is my Twitter. Sky. S-K-I-E.
1299000	1301000	And I've been posting some random things.
1301000	1305000	Like I posted a funny picture of one of the Pilot Wings people getting mad at me.
1305000	1310000	And like this funny thing I did in Mario Brothers where I had two of the turtles facing each other.
1310000	1312000	So it looked like they were talking to each other.
1312000	1314000	I like being able to post the screenshots to Miiverse.
1314000	1318000	So if you want to follow me on Nintendo Network.
1318000	1320000	I'm Rob Roberts on Nintendo Network.
1320000	1324000	I will post more hilarity when I can. When I'm feeling funny.
1324000	1327000	So I've been doing that on Nintendo.
1327000	1334000	Otherwise on PC I suddenly got unexplainably addicted to Steam trading cards.
1334000	1338000	I don't know why. I don't have a good reason for it.
1338000	1341000	I just said this is something I want.
1341000	1347000	You mean I can get silly loot like new backgrounds and experience that means nothing.
1347000	1350000	And possibly coupons. I guess that's something.
1350000	1353000	From doing this trading card game. Metagame in Steam.
1353000	1355000	Yes I must do this.
1355000	1357000	So here's the thing though.
1357000	1360000	The game kind of makes no sense when you hear it at first.
1360000	1362000	So let me explain it for you.
1362000	1364000	Best I can. Best I know about it.
1364000	1368000	First off. First things first. You have to get this out of your head.
1368000	1371000	Trading cards are not tied to achievements.
1371000	1374000	Achievements have nothing to do with trading cards. They are separate.
1374000	1376000	So get that out of your head. Break that link.
1376000	1380000	First mistake people make. They think the two are tied together. They're not. Completely separate.
1380000	1383000	So certain games have trading cards.
1383000	1387000	And there might be five in a set. There might be nine in a set. There might be seven.
1387000	1390000	There's anywhere from five to nine it looks like from the games I've played.
1390000	1395000	Now there's two different systems in a game that you paid for.
1395000	1397000	Like Super Meat Boy.
1397000	1398000	Magica.
1398000	1399000	Binding of Isaac.
1399000	1403000	In a game that you paid for. Every time you start the game.
1403000	1406000	And play it for about twenty, thirty minutes.
1406000	1409000	And log out. You get a trading card.
1409000	1413000	Up to half the number that are in the deck.
1413000	1415000	In other words.
1415000	1419000	Super Meat Boy is probably one of the smallest decks that has five cards in it.
1419000	1422000	You can get three of them by playing Super Meat Boy.
1422000	1425000	Once you've gotten all the cards. You can get repeats though which sucks.
1425000	1428000	In Faerie Solitaire I've gotten three of the same card which is really irritating.
1428000	1434000	But. And you don't. Like if you are only eligible. I think I'm eligible for five out of nine in Faerie Solitaire.
1434000	1438000	Except three of my five are all the same. So I'm going to have to do some big time trading.
1438000	1440000	So what happens once you get half?
1440000	1442000	You become eligible for booster packs.
1442000	1447000	Which are handed out. This is the part I don't quite have figured out yet. Maybe somebody in chat can help.
1447000	1449000	It seems to be arbitrary.
1449000	1453000	Like you might get them in a day. You might get them in a week.
1453000	1457000	But you have to log into Steam every week in order to be eligible for the booster packs.
1457000	1463000	And my understanding is that booster packs spawn as people complete their sets.
1463000	1468000	And you have a greater chance to get a booster pack if your Steam experience is higher.
1468000	1472000	Like your Steam level 10. Your Steam level 20. Which you can get from the games you own.
1472000	1475000	The previous sales. And all this other stuff.
1475000	1481000	So once you get the booster packs then you open them up and maybe you'll finish your set through a booster pack.
1481000	1487000	Which then you can combine your set and tada! You get your badge and you get a new profile background.
1487000	1493000	A new emote icon. Just a bunch of really cosmetic stuff.
1493000	1497000	But still kind of a little more than what achievements get you, right?
1497000	1503000	And possibly a coupon. Like I saw one YouTube where a guy opened it up and he got a 50% off Company Heroes or something.
1503000	1507000	One of those games coupon. Which I thought, oh that's cool because that's more trading fodder later.
1507000	1510000	Like I could use that to trade for a card. Like I'm never going to buy this game.
1510000	1516000	Why don't you give me your Super Meat Boy card and I'll give you my 50% off coupon for this game.
1516000	1524000	So Steam's created this very interesting thing about it. I kind of wish there was a little more to it than just the play the game.
1524000	1531000	Oh! I missed free to play. For games like Dota, Team Fortress, you don't get the cards for playing.
1531000	1534000	You get the cards for spending money in the online shop.
1534000	1538000	Like for every, I think it's $9 or $10 you spend in the shop, you get a card.
1538000	1543000	So I'm not so focused on those because I don't really play any of those.
1543000	1547000	The only free to play game I play through Steam regularly right now is Marvel Heroes and they don't have cards.
1547000	1554000	But I've been going back, you know, I've got over 100 Steam games thanks to these bundles and bundles I accumulated in Steam sales.
1554000	1556000	Oh my god! Steam sale coming!
1556000	1558000	Yeah, a lot of the old stuff.
1558000	1562000	ActDeft correcting me in chat saying you can only get them once per week.
1562000	1563000	I did not know that.
1563000	1568000	And ActDeft says you can also buy cards and boosters from the Steam Community Marketplace.
1568000	1574000	Oh boy, see? They've created this whole game where you're spending money to get that one card.
1574000	1577000	I'm going to try not to go that route. I'm going to really try to do this the old-fashioned way.
1577000	1580000	I haven't gotten any booster packs yet because I just got into it this weekend.
1580000	1589000	But I've collected like, I have three Super Meat Boy cards, three Really Big Sky cards, three Faerie Solitaire cards, one Magica card.
1589000	1592000	And that'll tell you what else I've been playing with my gaming week.
1592000	1595000	So let me quickly run down some of these other games.
1595000	1602000	Super Meat Boy. Plug in a controller and use it on the PC. It's just as fun as the Xbox 360 version and it's still fun to play.
1602000	1604000	That's a great game to play for a few minutes.
1604000	1611000	You play a few minutes, beat a few rounds, you feel accomplished, get frustrated on a level, whatever, close it, come back later.
1611000	1616000	Really Big Sky is a twin-stick shooter that came out I think at the end of last year.
1617000	1620000	I like it but it's not my favorite twin-stick shooter.
1620000	1627000	And part of the reason I don't like it is that, well for one, I get really bad performance issues when there's too much stuff on screen on my PC.
1627000	1630000	I probably need to play with the graphics settings and so forth.
1630000	1633000	But I think it starts to become too much.
1633000	1639000	Like the graphics are just too much and I can't tell things apart and it just looks like explosion mania.
1639000	1645000	And I really didn't like how retro mode was just this really silly filter and a chiptune song.
1645000	1648000	Like it was not retro mode at all. I did not like that.
1648000	1654000	But those are really the only, I know I'm sounding very negative about this game but it is a fun game especially if you like shooters.
1654000	1657000	And the soundtrack is phenomenal. I really like that.
1657000	1663000	Also been playing The Binding of Isaac which is kind of rogue.
1663000	1668000	A lot of people say it's Legend of Zelda but it doesn't play like Zelda.
1668000	1670000	It plays like a twin-stick shooter.
1670000	1673000	But it's always randomly generated which is interesting.
1673000	1677000	It's a little bit out there as far as the story goes.
1677000	1682000	And it's one of those things you're like, you play it and you're like, you know, not all games are art.
1682000	1685000	Cause this one's a little weird.
1685000	1688000	You got like monsters that leave poop everywhere that's part of a mechanic.
1688000	1695000	And you find these really odd things that you're, cause you know the plot of the story is that your mom is trying to kill you.
1695000	1696000	That's the plot of The Binding of Isaac.
1696000	1698000	And you find all this really weird stuff.
1698000	1703000	It's kind of a creepy game. I'm only playing that as much as I have to to get cards.
1703000	1709000	I like the idea of a roguelike that does the randomly generated stuff. There's a ton of those games out there.
1709000	1713000	And then Magica. I like that.
1713000	1717000	That's kind of like a puzzle-y type game where you can combine different magics together to get to.
1717000	1720000	It reminds me of an old school PC game from like the late 90's.
1720000	1726000	Where you, you know, you put things together to get to pass this part of a level.
1726000	1731000	Like you might mix fire and stone magic together to throw a fire boulder.
1731000	1733000	Or you use ice magic to freeze a lake.
1733000	1735000	And make all these clever spells.
1735000	1737000	And it's got a co-op mode that's supposedly a lot of fun.
1737000	1740000	But I haven't really played a lot of the co-op mode.
1740000	1742000	So, anyhow.
1742000	1744000	I've been talking to your ear off about Steam and all that.
1744000	1753000	But the trading card thing is, I like that it gives me reason to go back and play these games that I probably didn't sink enough time into.
1753000	1755000	Like I played Binding of Isaac before.
1755000	1759000	But I didn't play it enough to understand just how fucking disturbed it is, you know?
1759000	1761000	Now I understand a little better.
1761000	1764000	And same thing with Magica and Fairy Solitaire and some of that.
1764000	1767000	You know, I played enough Fairy Solitaire to get the game.
1767000	1772000	But now I've really gotten to parts where it starts to just really get irritatingly difficult.
1772000	1775000	So, there you go. That's been my time with Steam this week.
1776000	1779000	AlphaCananagram in chat in reference to the Binding of Isaac says,
1779000	1783000	I only heard it is just like it is Zelda due to the dungeon format.
1783000	1785000	Yeah, and the bombs and the keys.
1785000	1793000	But honestly, the way it plays as a game is a little more similar to Rogue and like a twin-stick shooter.
1793000	1795000	Even though you can only shoot in the four directions.
1795000	1798000	But weird things happen. Like you'll find these pills.
1798000	1801000	And you won't know what the pills do until you try using them once.
1801000	1804000	I'm almost positive that was a mechanic in Rogue.
1804000	1806000	You didn't know what stuff did until you used it for once.
1806000	1810000	And some of the pills will give you just derpy face.
1810000	1812000	And it goes, I found a pill and I ate it.
1812000	1815000	Some will teleport you to a random room. Some will enhance your health.
1815000	1818000	One of them is a suicide pill.
1818000	1821000	You take it, you die. Game over. One life. That's it.
1821000	1823000	Game over, you start again from the beginning.
1823000	1827000	That's like some Dark Souls level difficulty.
1827000	1830000	Alright, let's move on.
1830000	1832000	Housekeeping. Don't forget to visit us on Twitter.
1832000	1836000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R. And we are also on Facebook, of course.
1836000	1839000	At Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1839000	1842000	Just got a text from DarkSakura. She's on her way.
1842000	1845000	So we'll hopefully be seeing her in about 20 more minutes.
1845000	1848000	But in the meantime, we're going to keep on moving with the show.
1848000	1851000	And get into gaming news tonight.
1851000	1853000	Loki, start us off with one I'm sure you've all heard.
1854000	1857000	Don Mattrick has left Xbox.
1857000	1861000	He was originally the president of the...
1861000	1865000	I believe their entertainment business division.
1865000	1870000	And now he is going to become the president of Zynga.
1870000	1874000	So that's interesting, I guess.
1874000	1876000	I'm not really sure why he did...
1876000	1879000	I mean, I can think of a few reasons why he might have done that.
1879000	1891000	But the kind of general consensus out there is that he's jumping from a sinking ship to a ship that's on fire and in the water somehow.
1891000	1894000	I think I saw that exact comic strip you're referencing.
1894000	1899000	Yeah, it was a ship on fire and a ship being eaten by a shark or something.
1899000	1908000	I don't want to sound like a know-it-all, but I can't resist in bringing up the fact that just two weeks ago on this show, after the big E3 thing, what did I say about Don Mattrick?
1908000	1910000	What did I say, Loki? You remember?
1910000	1913000	You said that he was going to be on the chopping block, I guess.
1913000	1917000	I said he would take the fall and he'd be gone within 365 days.
1917000	1924000	And just like the Xbox reversal thing, which happened in like three days, the Don Mattrick thing happened a lot faster than anticipated.
1924000	1927000	But here's the kicker. I actually don't think he was forced out the door.
1927000	1928000	No, I don't think so.
1928000	1930000	But I think Don Mattrick, I mean, he's the executive of a...
1930000	1934000	Oh, he's now the CEO of a large company, whether you like it or not.
1934000	1937000	It at one time was a profitable company.
1937000	1946000	I think he saw what happened at E3, he saw what everybody was talking about, he saw this opportunity, and he took it.
1946000	1955000	And I think it was one of those things where it's like, you know, if the Xbox One doesn't do well this holiday season, do I want to be left with no job?
1955000	1959000	Or do I take this job where maybe I can actually turn things around?
1959000	1964000	It is a heck of an opportunity and it could be a great way for him anyway to repair his image.
1964000	1967000	I mean, let's imagine he does turn Zynga around.
1967000	1971000	And I know a lot of people are ready to pile poop on this.
1971000	1975000	They're like, yay, poopy executive meets poopy company.
1975000	1978000	Go live in your poopy world together making poopville.
1978000	1984000	But I don't know if I really see it that way because these are two...
1984000	1990000	You've got a company in a pretty bad situation, you've got an executive that was in a pretty bad situation.
1990000	1993000	Maybe they can help each other more than they can hurt each other.
1993000	1996000	And maybe this actually won't end up being the end of the world.
1996000	1998000	I mean, why do we hate on Zynga?
1998000	2000000	Why have we hated on Zynga in the past?
2000000	2002000	What are people's complaints with Zynga?
2002000	2010000	They seem to skirt around IP rights by mimicking as much as they can of a game without outright copy.
2010000	2015000	I mean, they need sometimes outright copy, but they change enough to where they can't get sued, I guess.
2015000	2018000	Or they can't get sued and lose.
2018000	2021000	They'll change things around slightly, but they'll keep...
2021000	2029000	Because you can't copyright those core mechanics, so let's just rip them all out and take a popular game and make a clone of it.
2029000	2034000	And then people will play because it's got Zynga on it.
2034000	2036000	Now, let me ask you this question.
2036000	2041000	What does it take to change a company that's heading in that direction?
2041000	2042000	What does that take?
2042000	2050000	Well, it's not just that. They've had problems where they were buying up other companies and they're spending a lot of money doing that and they weren't making their money back.
2050000	2052000	Okay. What will it take to change that?
2052000	2055000	Someone with good business sense.
2055000	2060000	A new executive. New blood. A big change. A big change.
2060000	2063000	And that's what Zynga's got, is they've got a big change.
2063000	2067000	So now I think Don Mattrick and Zynga are really in a position to help each other.
2067000	2070000	We can speculate to the cows come home what that's going to mean.
2070000	2074000	And I know a lot of people joke, her perp is always online. Her perp one meets another.
2074000	2079000	Don Mattrick did not come up with always online all by his lonesome self, y'all.
2081000	2083000	But maybe there's some interesting stuff that could come of this. I don't know.
2083000	2088000	Like, maybe Zynga will separate itself from Facebook a little bit.
2088000	2092000	That's the part that's exciting to me. At least Don Mattrick wasn't from Facebook.
2092000	2098000	Maybe Zynga will start to appear on consoles with games that aren't ripoffs of other stuff.
2098000	2101000	Like some casually interesting things.
2101000	2107000	I think one of the things you're going to see with the Xbox One, and that's the whole reason why they have that Windows 8 section of the OS,
2107000	2114000	is that you're going to see all these apps that are being developed to run on Windows 8 are going to be able to run on the Xbox One.
2114000	2124000	So if they have, say, a Farmville app that runs on Windows 8, I'm not sure if it's going to be just necessarily the RT or if it's just the actual x86 Windows 8,
2125000	2132000	that these will probably be easily ported if not able to run natively on the Xbox One.
2132000	2141000	So you could see these casual games coming to a game console, that and any other sort of app that people make.
2141000	2147000	And that, very well, that may be why they're not really pushing the whole self-publishing thing because they're like,
2147000	2154000	well, you published on Windows 8 on that marketplace and then you can publish on the Xbox One as well.
2154000	2164000	And that's how they'll try to get people to make more apps for Windows 8 because they need apps on that marketplace in order to make Windows 8 seem appealing.
2164000	2171000	Because kind of like what they have with the App Store on Mac, they need to have the content there in order to drive it.
2172000	2177000	I'm going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. After all, it is the show where every gamer has a voice.
2177000	2182000	Rama says, I don't hate Zynga. All they're doing is playing the business game like a boss.
2182000	2188000	ShadowNextGen says, Rob, Matric's image isn't tarnished except for the internet vocal minority.
2188000	2192000	When it was announced that Matric was joining Zynga, Zynga's stock jumped up.
2192000	2197000	I think you're minimalizing the negativity that came out of E3 a little bit.
2197000	2202000	Now, how much of that is tied to Matric versus not? That could be argued a little bit.
2202000	2206000	I don't think you can blame one person for the whole Xbox stuff anyway.
2206000	2210000	I don't, but again, like I said two weeks ago, someone's going to take the fall for it.
2210000	2215000	I don't know if anyone's taken the fall yet for it. He may have just jumped ship.
2215000	2218000	I was going to mention, though, that they're going to have...
2218000	2220000	Well, I want to say the second half of this comment here.
2220000	2225000	When it was announced that Matric was joining Zynga, Zynga's stock jumped up.
2225000	2228000	Well, exactly. How can things get worse at Zynga?
2228000	2232000	And let's not belittle that Don Matric did have a lot of success at Microsoft.
2232000	2234000	Xbox 360's done very well.
2234000	2238000	So, I think a lot of people see it as, you know, this can only help things.
2238000	2244000	Sure, maybe he had a bad week, but at the end of the day, Zynga's in the shitter.
2244000	2247000	And maybe Don Matric can help bring them out of that at least.
2247000	2251000	And that would be a great thing. And sure, sure, I think a lot of investors saw that too.
2252000	2257000	Hey, you know, if Zynga's looking to get some games on the Xbox One or something,
2257000	2264000	it might help to have somebody that used to be working for Microsoft to kind of build those bridges.
2264000	2270000	There were gonna... One other thing, I guess, Steve Ballmer, the CEO of Microsoft,
2270000	2279000	he's considering, I guess, Julie Larson-Green, who is, I guess, the current Windows CEO or whatever
2279000	2283000	to take over the Xbox division.
2283000	2290000	So, when she's quite experienced, I guess, she did product launches for Windows 7
2290000	2297000	and helped design some of the user interface stuff for the Office products.
2297000	2302000	Not the newer ones, but 2003, 2007, which I thought were sane.
2302000	2306000	And then 2010 came around, it's like, what the fuck is this?
2307000	2312000	So, yeah, I'll be interested in seeing how that affects anything.
2312000	2315000	I don't think... A lot of these people in these positions, I don't think have a lot...
2315000	2317000	Because it seems like it doesn't change too much.
2317000	2320000	Like, you get a new CEO, all of a sudden it's not radically different.
2320000	2323000	It's just... I don't know, we'll see.
2323000	2326000	They have a game plan, they're sticking to it, so...
2326000	2327000	Dungeon Buster in chat says,
2327000	2331000	Larson-Green headed up the Windows 8 group after the last head left.
2331000	2332000	Well, when did the last head leave?
2332000	2334000	See, I haven't been following the Windows 8 drums.
2334000	2337000	I just know that the launch of Windows 8, not so great,
2337000	2341000	but they really seem to be making things right with this 8.1 patch,
2341000	2345000	and it seems a lot more exciting this time than the original launch of Windows 8.
2345000	2347000	It seems like they've got, like...
2347000	2351000	It's like they get this market research or something about what people want,
2351000	2353000	and then they make it that way, but they don't...
2353000	2356000	It's like they don't quite get it 100%.
2356000	2358000	It's like, people want tablets.
2358000	2362000	Let's make an OS for tablets and put it on a PC.
2362000	2364000	It's like, uh-huh?
2364000	2366000	Tigerclaw in our chat says,
2366000	2369000	Who do you think should replace Don Mattrick when going up on stage
2369000	2371000	at next year's E3 press conference?
2371000	2375000	Well, I mean, if this rumbling is true, it would be Julie Larson-Green,
2375000	2378000	which, you know, I don't know much about this particular executive,
2378000	2383000	I have to say, but however, you know, silly this might sound...
2383000	2384000	Steve Ballmer.
2384000	2386000	Well, it could be Steve Ballmer, but I...
2386000	2387000	He yells a lot.
2387000	2391000	I like the girl power that Microsoft's showing a little bit here, you know?
2391000	2395000	I think it would be a great thing for a female to be taking the lead on this,
2395000	2399000	especially, you know, after there were some very shameful things
2399000	2401000	that came out of Microsoft's press conference,
2401000	2404000	whether it was intended or not, it was shameful.
2404000	2405000	I think that would be...
2405000	2410000	I mean, Microsoft's got this executive possibly coming in.
2410000	2412000	The one that used to work for CBS
2412000	2415000	is now the head of the Microsoft Entertainment Group.
2415000	2418000	The head of 343 Studios is female.
2418000	2420000	I think that's great.
2420000	2422000	I'm all for that type of diversity.
2422000	2426000	So, you know, at least there's that,
2426000	2428000	is it will bring a little more diversity,
2428000	2431000	but I don't know this gal's credentials
2431000	2433000	or what else she brings to the table outside of that.
2433000	2435000	But I think we'll be learning a lot more about her
2435000	2439000	if it's true that she is going to be taking over Microsoft's entertainment division.
2439000	2441000	We'll see.
2441000	2444000	So, all right.
2444000	2446000	Anyhow, I guess we'll move on with news, yes?
2446000	2447000	Yes.
2447000	2449000	Moving on to a story about Xbox One,
2449000	2452000	and since we've been talking a lot about Windows 8,
2452000	2455000	and I guess if they're bringing in the Windows 8 executive,
2455000	2457000	this might make a lot of sense here.
2457000	2460000	Microsoft Builds Developers Conference last week
2460000	2465000	talked about what could be Xbox One compatibility for Windows 8 apps,
2465000	2467000	and I think you were mentioning this a little bit too, Loki.
2467000	2470000	Yeah, I completely didn't realize.
2470000	2473000	I actually listened to part of the Build thing, too.
2473000	2476000	There was some news out of it that was kind of exciting, but...
2476000	2478000	Well, let me read at least some of the quotes here
2478000	2480000	when we can further talk about this here.
2480000	2484000	Steve Guggenheimer, who is the VP of Developer and Platform Evangelism,
2484000	2486000	I don't know if that's a word this website used.
2486000	2488000	I can't imagine that's a title,
2488000	2493000	but he talked about how folks that would like to start on Xbox One development
2493000	2496000	should start on Windows 8 applications because, quote,
2496000	2498000	Xbox One has two engines.
2498000	2502000	It's got a gaming engine, and it essentially has a Windows 8 engine.
2502000	2505000	And then he showed a web application that was running on Xbox One.
2505000	2507000	Nothing to announce today,
2507000	2509000	but when I talk about that common core,
2509000	2513000	you're seeing that common core in action being able to target other devices
2513000	2515000	over time that run the Windows 8 engine.
2515000	2517000	Hmm.
2517000	2519000	Yeah, and I already kind of...
2519000	2522000	They sort of alluded to that anyways
2522000	2525000	when they were talking about how their OS is set up,
2525000	2528000	how it's three OSes basically on top of each other.
2528000	2531000	You have the Windows 8 OS, the Xbox One OS,
2531000	2534000	and then the one that kind of makes them talk to each other, I guess.
2535000	2537000	The arbitrator OS.
2537000	2539000	Black Wolf corrects me in chat saying,
2539000	2542000	yes, it is an actual Microsoft title.
2542000	2544000	Strange, but okay.
2544000	2546000	I mean, it makes sense. I get it.
2546000	2548000	I just, you know, when I think of evangelists,
2548000	2551000	I think of the guys on, you know, PTL on television.
2551000	2553000	One of the things that was kind of exciting,
2553000	2556000	because now you know how they don't have really X and A anymore.
2556000	2558000	It's kind of gone by the wayside.
2558000	2560000	They did announce a partnership with Unity
2560000	2563000	where they're going to be allowing porting
2563000	2569000	where you can make Xbox One games with Unity.
2569000	2571000	That's going to have that built-in support as well,
2571000	2573000	so that's kind of cool.
2573000	2575000	And I think they're going to have PlayStation 4 support as well,
2575000	2577000	so that's kind of...
2577000	2579000	I don't know if it's necessarily replacing X and A,
2579000	2583000	but that may be the new route to go, I guess.
2583000	2586000	Yeah, I was going to say, how useful is it
2586000	2590000	for Windows 8 apps to be on Xbox One when you can't self-publish?
2591000	2594000	But that's the thing, is they may have that,
2594000	2598000	where it's going to have access to the App Store that's on PC,
2598000	2600000	but they're going to say,
2600000	2605000	well, you can't publish a game on Xbox One,
2605000	2609000	but you can publish an app on the App Store
2609000	2611000	and have access to Xbox One,
2611000	2613000	or the Xbox One users will have access to it.
2613000	2615000	Maybe that's how they're going to get around it.
2615000	2616000	You know, when I'm thinking to myself,
2616000	2618000	I'm like, what types of apps could we be talking about here?
2618000	2621000	Are we talking about things like calendar management apps on Xbox One?
2621000	2622000	Like anything.
2622000	2625000	Because when I think of apps, like on 360,
2625000	2629000	outside of games, they have a lot of web video players.
2629000	2631000	It seems like everything is some type of video player.
2631000	2634000	I can't think of a whole lot of stuff on 360
2634000	2638000	that's not some type of video player for some network or some website.
2638000	2643000	I have this weird feeling that that's somehow going to be
2643000	2646000	some sort of entry point for hacking right there,
2646000	2651000	allowing these applications that can be run on the App Store.
2651000	2653000	Because I can think of someone
2653000	2655000	that could somehow sneak something in there.
2655000	2657000	Oh, yeah, something that gets stealthily loaded,
2657000	2659000	like how MAME got on the Apple Store.
2659000	2662000	They loaded it as one of the freeware ROMs.
2662000	2665000	I think it was called Gridly or something was the game.
2665000	2667000	It's an arcade game that went freeware.
2667000	2669000	People released it a long time ago.
2669000	2671000	So they put that app on the marketplace.
2671000	2674000	Well, hidden underneath it was a MAME emulator.
2674000	2676000	And as long as you could get it from the Apple Store
2676000	2678000	in the window before they caught it,
2678000	2680000	all you have to do is use one of those programs
2680000	2682000	that let you browse the file structure on your phone.
2682000	2684000	You just throw ROMs in the directory.
2684000	2687000	You got MAME on your iPad and iPhone,
2687000	2690000	which works great with that little iCade I have sitting over there,
2690000	2692000	just for the record.
2692000	2694000	Tigerclaw in chat says,
2694000	2697000	like, how about a VOG app for Xbox One?
2697000	2700000	I'm sure Bobby is wincing, kind of thinking about all the work
2700000	2702000	it would take to make something like that.
2702000	2704000	Loki is learning how to program.
2704000	2706000	Maybe he can take that project.
2706000	2708000	Well, here's the thing. I don't think that's necessary anymore
2708000	2713000	because nowadays, let's hope that their Internet Explorer
2713000	2716000	has HTML5 support.
2716000	2718000	It should be able to support the website natively.
2718000	2721000	You'd be able to just use the website.
2721000	2725000	So it's not necessary to create a dedicated app for that stuff anymore
2725000	2728000	because browsers are smart enough now
2728000	2730000	to where they can run all that content.
2730000	2733000	You know, before, they couldn't, so you had to build some.
2733000	2735000	Gameguru in chat says,
2735000	2737000	Unity is going to be the indie platform.
2739000	2741000	We shall see.
2741000	2743000	I've been hearing a lot of good things about it, though.
2745000	2748000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
2748000	2752000	at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, golf.
2752000	2754000	Let's move on.
2754000	2756000	I guess I'll do this story here.
2756000	2758000	Jamie was going to talk about this,
2758000	2760000	but she's still a few minutes away, it sounds like.
2760000	2762000	I will cover this here.
2762000	2764000	It's a game called...
2764000	2766000	Is it Ittle-Doo?
2766000	2768000	It's Ittle-Doo.
2768000	2770000	That'll do, kid.
2770000	2772000	Ittle-Doo. I-T-T-L-E-Doo.
2772000	2775000	Ittle-Doo is now out on the PC.
2775000	2780000	Ittle-Doo, they say, is a kind of Zelda-esque adventure title.
2780000	2782000	It's very cartoony.
2782000	2784000	It's by Swedish studio Ludosity.
2784000	2788000	It sells for 9.40 euros.
2788000	2792000	That's $13.99.
2794000	2797000	It's kind of like Zelda, but it has its own cartoon aesthetic,
2797000	2799000	and it has a lot of self-referential humor.
2799000	2801000	Oh, I like the games that break down the fourth wall.
2801000	2803000	That's always a lot of fun.
2803000	2807000	It pokes fun at itself as your little shipwrecked character
2807000	2809000	and her flying fox, Tipsy,
2809000	2813000	go around terrorizing the island's inhabitants
2813000	2816000	and stealing their wealth and eating their hearts.
2816000	2819000	That doesn't sound very good unless we're talking, like, flashy hearts like Zelda.
2819000	2823000	Well, Ittle-Doo will also be on Mac and Steam and Wii U,
2823000	2826000	Linux, iPad, and Android later this year.
2826000	2831000	If you get it now, you'll get the Steam, Mac, and Linux ports on their release.
2831000	2832000	And Ouya.
2832000	2834000	Oh, and Ouya.
2834000	2836000	I wasn't hearing the story, but...
2836000	2839000	Oh, I see. It's on Twitter and it's in review right now.
2839000	2840000	Very cool.
2840000	2842000	They review games that go on the Ouya?
2843000	2844000	That's news.
2844000	2845000	I don't know what it says.
2845000	2848000	Probably before it goes on the official marketplace, I would think so.
2848000	2850000	Yeah, that's good enough.
2850000	2852000	If you want to see some of the games,
2852000	2854000	there are some Let's Plays available on YouTube
2854000	2856000	if you want to see the game in action.
2856000	2857000	Sounds cute.
2857000	2859000	I would like to check it out, especially if there's a little demo,
2859000	2860000	I can get a sample of it,
2860000	2862000	but I guess there's always a Let's Play if nothing else.
2862000	2865000	You can kind of check out a little bit about what that game's about.
2865000	2866000	Jamie must have earmarked that
2866000	2868000	because that's something she's taken interest in,
2868000	2870000	so we'll ask her when she gets here.
2870000	2871000	But for now, let's move on.
2872000	2875000	So, Ubisoft got hacked.
2875000	2876000	Uh oh.
2876000	2877000	Yeah.
2877000	2882000	So, you know, apparently an unnamed Ubisoft website,
2882000	2883000	they were hacked,
2883000	2886000	and the usernames, email addresses, and password information
2886000	2888000	have all been compromised.
2888000	2891000	Thankfully, there's no sort of payment data in there,
2891000	2896000	but still, you know, you share passwords with Uplay or something like that,
2896000	2898000	you may want to change them.
2898000	2901000	So, they didn't say that they...
2901000	2904000	It says the tag did not originate via any Uplay services.
2904000	2908000	The intrusion targets some of our internal online systems,
2908000	2912000	and I don't know what that's supposed to mean, but whatever.
2912000	2915000	All the more reason why I don't like, you know,
2915000	2916000	signing up for these different services.
2916000	2919000	Although, I guess now I'm going to have to sign up for Origin
2919000	2921000	if I want to play Battlefield 3 now, aren't I?
2921000	2922000	Ugh.
2922000	2924000	I mean, well, on PS3, I think, right?
2924000	2927000	Because you have to do that for Mass Effect, right?
2927000	2928000	Yeah, you have to do it for Mass Effect.
2928000	2929000	God damn it.
2929000	2930000	Well, whatever.
2930000	2934000	I think I still have an old EA account that's probably out there anyways.
2934000	2937000	It just sucks that you have to have all these different passwords,
2937000	2941000	and I know there's app solutions and password wallets and things,
2941000	2943000	but I'm going to be honest,
2943000	2946000	and maybe I shouldn't be saying this in my public radio show, but whatever.
2946000	2950000	I kind of have a pool of different passwords I pick from.
2950000	2954000	My bank account has one password that is very hard.
2954000	2957000	It's just the most secure type of password.
2957000	2959000	You can't figure it out, and I don't use it for anything else.
2959000	2965000	But sites like Uplay or signing up for random web forum here or there,
2965000	2967000	especially if there's no finances tied to it,
2967000	2970000	I use one password for pretty much all that stuff.
2970000	2972000	It's like whatever.
2972000	2974000	No big deal if you lose it.
2974000	2981000	Oh no, someone's going to take over my account on Minecraft forum or something.
2981000	2985000	Pretty much anything that could potentially have my credit card information on it,
2985000	2987000	I have to basically do a unique password for.
2987000	2989000	But I have my own little system.
2989000	2992000	I don't want to say much more than that, but I have a system doing unique passwords.
2992000	2995000	Well, it may not affect most of our listeners.
2995000	2998000	Club Nintendo Japan also was hacked.
2998000	3009000	I guess they realized that there was a bunch of failed login attempts or something like that,
3009000	3017000	and then they said that just under 24,000 illegitimate logins between June 9th and July 4th
3017000	3020000	from over 15 million attempts.
3020000	3026000	So basically said that some of the information compromised in the attack
3026000	3031000	included full names, phone numbers, home email addresses,
3031000	3035000	and since they don't hold any credit card information, none of that was leaked.
3035000	3038000	But still, it sucks.
3038000	3041000	Still, names and addresses always kind of sucks.
3041000	3042000	You never know what's going to happen.
3042000	3043000	I mean, I have my credit card around there.
3043000	3049000	They get enough stuff to mine enough information, they can create their own credit cards.
3049000	3051000	Usually they have to get your social for that.
3051000	3053000	Well, at least here in the States, they have to get your social for that.
3053000	3056000	But still, scary.
3056000	3061000	All right, well, moving on, since you talked about Nintendo Japan,
3061000	3067000	one item that's been getting a lot of passion lately is the region locking that's on Nintendo's console.
3067000	3072000	And you know, it's not something that apparently is going to exist on Xbox One or PlayStation 4,
3072000	3078000	which leaves the Wii U kind of the sole holdout when it comes to region locking.
3078000	3083000	And I think we talked last week or the week before about there was a petition going around
3083000	3087000	to try and get Nintendo to reverse course on that and open up their system.
3087000	3090000	Well, I don't want to say that Nintendo necessarily responded to it this week,
3090000	3094000	but there has been more context that's come out about region locking
3094000	3096000	that's making the rounds on the sites this week.
3096000	3101000	And it was an interview with Satoru Iwata, and I believe this was run in IGN,
3101000	3108000	saying that, quote, from some people's perspectives, the region lock might seem like a kind of restriction.
3108000	3114000	But each region has its own cultural acceptance and legal restrictions, as well as different age ratings.
3114000	3117000	There are always things that we're required to do in each different region,
3117000	3122000	which may go counter to the idea that players around the world want the freedom to play whatever they want.
3122000	3129000	Continuing the quote here, I hope the game fans can understand that the industry isn't doing this solely out of business ego.
3129000	3132000	There are some reasons behind it.
3132000	3142000	Yeah, but I don't think your average mom is going to accidentally import a Japanese copy of some game or something like that.
3142000	3147000	Oh my God, content that's not appropriate for over here is on that game.
3147000	3149000	Oh no, that's not going to happen.
3149000	3156000	It's going to be dedicated fans that know what they want to play are going to pay the fees to import a game to get it over here.
3156000	3158000	I don't know, I don't see the problem.
3158000	3162000	Considering it's not a problem for the other consoles, why should it be a problem for this console?
3162000	3169000	I think the hard thing about this too is that I get the whole business ego thing and you have your reasons for doing it,
3169000	3172000	but you look really silly when your peers aren't doing it.
3172000	3173000	That's the problem.
3173000	3179000	If Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft were all banded together doing the same thing, this probably wouldn't be an issue in the first place.
3179000	3185000	Also, I think that they're trying to keep the purity of their marketplace the way it is,
3185000	3193000	because they're known for being more of a wholesome console versus the other systems that have a lot of violent games on there.
3194000	3201000	So maybe that's the reason is that they want to make sure that, hey, we may have some stuff that comes out in Japan
3201000	3206000	that has maybe a little bit more nudity in it than, say, a version that comes out over here.
3206000	3211000	Maybe that's why we don't want to have these games come out over here for some reason.
3211000	3215000	But at the same time, it's not like it's going to accidentally fall into the hands of...
3215000	3217000	How do they think does that work?
3217000	3221000	That someone's going to go into the store and somehow get a copy from Japan?
3222000	3224000	They don't do that very often.
3224000	3231000	Whenever we talk about licensing in regions, I can't help but go back ten years to when we used to talk a lot about Dance Dance Revolution.
3231000	3237000	Part of the interesting stuff about that game is that that became a huge thing over here,
3237000	3240000	but all those machines were being imported from Japan.
3240000	3243000	A lot of the games people were playing were imported from Japan.
3243000	3245000	There was a lot of...
3245000	3250000	They couldn't bring it over here because a lot of it came down to music licensing.
3250000	3254000	A lot of the catchy stuff from Dance Dance Revolution, like Butterfly.
3254000	3260000	Everybody remembers that for the first time they ever saw DDR years ago, the Butterfly song.
3260000	3265000	Well, that was from a Japanese series of dance albums.
3265000	3271000	They had a license with the Toshiba EMI, which is the record company in Japan, to do that whole thing.
3271000	3275000	They couldn't just do it as is over here.
3275000	3279000	They would have to re-license it, make that agreement work for the US,
3279000	3285000	and Konami, in a lot of their hard-headedness, which in some ways I think did come down to business ego, didn't do it.
3285000	3287000	Wouldn't do it.
3287000	3291000	And a lot of the stuff we got here in America, especially at first, was just like Konami Originals.
3291000	3294000	Remember Dance Dance Revolution, Konamiics?
3294000	3299000	They made a game out of nothing but Konami Originals because you don't have to license that stuff.
3299000	3305000	And finally, once those games started proving themselves, thanks to the fandom and the fact that the peripheral actually sold,
3305000	3313000	then they started making more quality games like DDR Max 2, UltraMix 2, which had a lot of US-specific licenses that were pretty good in it.
3313000	3321000	But even at the end of the day, the arcade machines were almost still always coming from Japan, until what finally...
3321000	3324000	Well, they had USA Mix. That was one of the old ones.
3324000	3329000	Yeah, but that was freaking pity being thrown at us in the US, right?
3329000	3331000	I'll take pity.
3331000	3333000	But it was nothing like Max 2 in extreme arcades.
3333000	3339000	I think finally, once Supernova hit, it seemed like they were getting songs licensed worldwide.
3339000	3344000	But there was a huge gap between extreme and supernova, and there was probably some thought...
3344000	3351000	I kind of missed when they were like, you know, not necessarily extreme, but like Max around there and EuroMix and stuff like that,
3351000	3356000	where each, you know, there was kind of like, you know, you had the European games had their own songs,
3356000	3360000	and the US games kind of had their own songs, and the Japanese games had their own songs.
3360000	3364000	I liked the differentiation there, but now it's just like so much stuff.
3364000	3367000	I don't even know what the fuck's on there anymore. It's just...
3367000	3371000	It is a lot of Konami originals now, but it's not bad.
3371000	3375000	When it comes to like licensing third-party stuff and so forth, I can understand...
3375000	3379000	I hate it, although, but I can understand the point of region locking, why they have to do that.
3379000	3385000	I think we need to understand we're in a more world market now with the internet and kind of find ways around that.
3385000	3392000	Here's where it comes down to. It's really the fault of, I think, the way the US music industry works,
3392000	3398000	and I'm not sure it's just limited to the US, but ironically enough, I was looking at this stuff today.
3398000	3406000	There is a bunch of different licensing. When you get licensing for music, they call them pro and non-pro artists.
3406000	3411000	Pro basically means they're part of a performance rights organization,
3411000	3420000	and what that means is you can license the music, you pay for the license or whatever for your game or whatever you want to do.
3420000	3427000	You have it for your game, but because it's on your game, you're still not licensed for public performance.
3427000	3437000	If you have your game in an arcade or something like that, you still have to pay for the performance rights for those tracks that are in the game
3437000	3443000	because it's being publicly displayed. That was probably one of the problems,
3443000	3450000	where they wouldn't necessarily want to have to pay additional fees to license all the music over here.
3450000	3454000	Again, although I understand that you can import everything.
3454000	3460000	At the same time, though, to go back to the whole region and import anything, how many people really import games?
3460000	3465000	Not a whole ton. Granted, I really do want to import Earth Defense Force, and I probably will.
3465000	3473000	Honestly, back in the day, in PlayStation, it was so easy, and I've openly admitted this on the show, I didn't import things, I pirated them.
3473000	3480000	I had no problem. I bought DDR USA Mix, I bought DDR Canomics, and I bought all the US stuff they ever put out.
3480000	3488000	But you know what? I pirated the Japanese games. If you're not going to put it out here for me to buy, I'm going to get what I want.
3488000	3491000	I would have happily bought those games if they'd released them in the US.
3491000	3493000	And I did buy a lot of those games that came out in Japan.
3493000	3497000	Soundtracks and stuff. A lot. Not necessarily all of them. A lot.
3497000	3502000	I'm not saying what I did was right, but I'm just saying this is what drives people to do it.
3502000	3507000	Because then you're talking about paying, what, $80 for a PlayStation 1 game? And it's like, fuck that.
3507000	3515000	I bought a lot of games at anime conventions. I had R4 and stuff like that. Fantastic game.
3515000	3522000	And like Dance Dance Revolution, what the hell was that? Extra Mix. Remember that one?
3522000	3527000	That was like fourth plus songs and the solo mix songs, I think.
3527000	3531000	Alright, go into our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
3531000	3538000	SSG100Matt says, seriously, what's wrong with having multiple windows saying before you purchase, hey, this is an import title.
3538000	3542000	It won't be in your native language. If you're going to complain about it, then you shouldn't buy this.
3542000	3551000	I think that does happen on PlayStation. Like the Mega Man games that are all up were all the Japanese Mega Man redos that are all in the PlayStation Marketplace.
3551000	3556000	And I think their warning is like in tiny text. You could probably easily miss it. I think.
3556000	3560000	Well, here's the other thing, too, is why can't they have like...
3560000	3570000	Well, they could easily build this in, but I know they don't want it because they want to make money from, you know, I guess just impulse purchases.
3570000	3579000	But why couldn't they just, you know, have like Android does where say you need to return the game, you can do it within like, you know, say seven days or something like that and get your money back.
3579000	3590000	And at the very least, you know, if it's, oh, I can't understand this game because it's all in Japanese or something, you know, maybe I thought I could get through, but it's too text intensive to actually be able to play it.
3590000	3593000	You know, this isn't for me. I'm going to return it and get my money back or something like that.
3593000	3601000	I don't see why they couldn't do that now, but I don't know. It doesn't seem like a big deal, but they could easily do that.
3601000	3608000	I think that I am surprised that they don't open the marketplaces up because there's a lot of games that do want to purchase that like Earth Defense Force.
3608000	3613000	If I could buy Earth Defense Force 4 without having to import that thing. Hell yeah, I'd buy digitally.
3613000	3619000	I would totally buy it. I would have already bought it digitally, you know, but I'm going to have to pay seventy dollars to import that.
3619000	3626000	A lot of people, not necessarily a lot of people in chat, but a lot of people I know talking about this game from our chat room.
3626000	3632000	Brad from Pod Culture says, this region deal just reminded me of something else I played this week, Phantasy Star Online 2.
3632000	3641000	And yeah, just irritating that Sega will not put that game out here, but maybe it has something to do with the free to play model and the Japan thing.
3641000	3643000	And you know, that's a whole other monkey wrench in the system.
3643000	3644000	Servers, I think it's server cost.
3644000	3648000	When you have the store built in or what have you.
3648000	3655000	Maybe it's a game that they don't think they're going to make their money back on as fast over here and so they don't want to invest in local servers.
3655000	3660000	Alright, well let me welcome to the show, she's here ladies and gentlemen, Dark Soccer, or Jamie Summers.
3660000	3661000	Hi.
3661000	3662000	Hi, welcome. You made it.
3662000	3664000	Yeah, this has been a harrowing day.
3664000	3665000	Yeah?
3665000	3666000	Trying to get in the chat.
3666000	3667000	Productive day though, right?
3667000	3671000	Yeah, we found a house that if all goes well, we're buying it.
3671000	3672000	Amazing.
3672000	3674000	And it's actually relatively close to here.
3674000	3675000	Wow, really?
3675000	3676000	It's over by ARC.
3676000	3677000	Okay.
3677000	3678000	It's a big house.
3678000	3680000	Yeah, I saw it from the picture you sent, yeah.
3680000	3683000	And it has perfect studio room.
3683000	3684000	Wow.
3684000	3686000	Moving on up.
3686000	3687000	Well, we'll keep our fingers crossed.
3687000	3688000	We don't want to get ahead of ourselves.
3688000	3689000	We'll keep our fingers crossed for you.
3689000	3692000	We do not, but it is, it's adorbs.
3692000	3693000	Nice.
3693000	3695000	And it has almost no yard, so it's awesome.
3695000	3696000	Well, good luck.
3696000	3700000	You walked in on a story about Nintendo defending region locking.
3700000	3705000	So, and now you were talking about the whole, you know, the fact that Xbox One and Sony
3705000	3709000	won't do it, but Nintendo is saying, you know, we're not doing this out of business ego.
3709000	3711000	We have to do it.
3711000	3715000	There's reasons behind it, but I'm kind of like, but your peers don't do it.
3715000	3716000	So, I don't know.
3716000	3721000	Anyway, I think that Nintendo tries to do things their own way.
3721000	3722000	And by the way, thank you.
3722000	3723000	Thank you for congratulations.
3723000	3730000	I, there's, I know reasons for doing it for controlling markets, at least.
3730000	3734000	And I know Nintendo tends, for as much as they like to innovate with the system, they
3734000	3737000	like to stay traditional with the business model.
3737000	3742000	So, it's sort of that same interesting, it's actually something I've noticed with a lot
3742000	3747000	of Japanese businesses, that they'll tend to innovate with the tech or with the product
3747000	3752000	that's going out, but keep their business model and their business practices very conservative.
3752000	3756000	And if this has been business as usual for them, I don't see them straying from it.
3756000	3757000	Okay.
3757000	3762000	So, I'm surprised that they kind of went back on the whole, you know, region free stuff
3762000	3768000	because I remember the portable consoles from them used to be region free up until the 3DS.
3768000	3772000	And it's kind of weird that they went back on.
3772000	3774000	I mean, I guess there was a lot of piracy in the DS.
3774000	3777000	Maybe that was the reason they were trying to limit that.
3777000	3778000	Maybe, I don't know.
3778000	3783000	Maybe it has to, you know, I'm thinking the whole, like, the DLC and that stuff, like,
3783000	3786000	I kind of think there's something there with that too.
3786000	3789000	See, I would agree with you if they were full into DLC and like online.
3789000	3791000	Well, they're starting to move that way though.
3791000	3793000	I mean, Super Luigi U.
3793000	3794000	How long has it taken them?
3794000	3795000	I mean, seriously.
3795000	3796000	But they're there.
3796000	3798000	The plans are being set in motion.
3798000	3799000	I don't think they're there yet.
3799000	3800000	Well, they're coming.
3800000	3801000	All right, anyhow.
3801000	3804000	Give me downloadable tracks and Mario Kart 8 and we'll talk.
3804000	3806000	Be careful what you wish for, young man.
3806000	3811000	I'm seriously, like, Mario Kart always sells me a console for Nintendo.
3811000	3816000	It's sad, but, like, I do like the idea of playing on a separate screen because, you know,
3816000	3818000	my wife does hog the TV a lot.
3818000	3819000	All right.
3819000	3820000	Or I have a laptop, I guess.
3820000	3824000	Well, Dark Sakura, I'm dying to talk to you about Atari Party and your gaming week,
3824000	3826000	but we'll make the listeners wait a little bit.
3826000	3827000	We'll do that at the top of Part B.
3827000	3828000	Yes.
3828000	3829000	Tonight.
3829000	3830000	So, we'll do that after the break tonight.
3830000	3831000	I can say though.
3831000	3832000	We did do some reminiscing.
3832000	3833000	Tons of fun.
3833000	3838000	We did do some reminiscing at the top of the show even though I didn't go to Atari Party
3838000	3839000	because, you know, rehearsals.
3839000	3840000	Well, you know what next week is, yes?
3840000	3846000	Yes, and I want to go so bad, but I can because I got Clue, rehearsals, and other stuff.
3846000	3847000	You know what?
3847000	3848000	What?
3848000	3849000	California Shrews only once a year.
3849000	3850000	You can watch Clue anytime.
3850000	3853000	No, but the Clue performance is only once a year, man.
3853000	3855000	My costume's sitting over there.
3855000	3857000	Okay, Colonel Mustard.
3857000	3858000	Anyhow.
3858000	3860000	Just don't let me find a wrench in your, you know.
3861000	3862000	July 27th.
3862000	3863000	Colonial Theater in Sacramento.
3863000	3864000	Yours truly.
3864000	3865000	On stage.
3865000	3866000	On screen.
3866000	3867000	Clue.
3867000	3868000	All right.
3868000	3869000	Let's move on with video game news.
3869000	3872000	Dark Soccer was bringing a lot of indie game news tonight since she's still getting powered
3872000	3873000	on here.
3873000	3874000	I'm totally getting this game.
3874000	3875000	Undertale.
3875000	3881000	I don't know much about this, but Undertale is a traditional role-playing game, but it's
3881000	3883000	trying to avoid violence.
3883000	3886000	So, it's like a pacifist role-playing game.
3886000	3892000	So, Undertale is a place where humans and monsters used to coexist peacefully, but as
3892000	3897000	the two races tore apart because of war, the monsters went underground, and a child tumbles
3897000	3900000	through a great hole and falls into a monster-filled domain.
3900000	3902000	Wasn't that the plot of Monsters, Inc.?
3902000	3905000	Sort of, but I like the twist on this.
3905000	3906000	Kitty.
3906000	3907000	I like the twist on this one.
3907000	3908000	Kitty.
3908000	3912000	So, yeah, Undertale is a game where no one gets hurt.
3913000	3918000	It says the ability to take out enemies with a click still exists, but so do alternate
3918000	3919000	options.
3919000	3923000	You can befriend a boss that you've encountered by talking to them.
3923000	3926000	Why not show your foes mercy and spare them?
3926000	3927000	I think that's kind of neat.
3927000	3928000	Something a little different.
3928000	3933000	Yeah, it gives you the opportunity to talk to them out of kicking your ass.
3934000	3938000	Let's see, the game is funding right now on Kickstarter, because you know a lot of these
3938000	3941000	indie games are, and the funding ends on July 24th.
3941000	3944000	Windows, PC, and Mac, and it will be released in summer 2014.
3944000	3947000	This may take my Kickstarter virginity.
3947000	3948000	Oh, yeah?
3948000	3949000	Yeah.
3949000	3950000	You got into it, huh?
3950000	3956000	Yeah, it's such a neat concept, and I've really been getting more and more into the indie
3956000	3959000	game scene, so I'm excited.
3959000	3960000	You missed my gaming week.
3960000	3964000	I've played a shit ton of indie stuff thanks to that fucking Steam trading card thing.
3964000	3965000	It's addicting.
3965000	3967000	Well, I played a shit ton of old stuff.
3967000	3969000	Have you played Binding of Isaac?
3969000	3970000	I haven't.
3970000	3971000	That game is disturbing.
3971000	3972000	I've started it.
3972000	3977000	It was really like, the controls bizarre on it, so I was like, this looks like Zelda,
3977000	3978000	but bloody.
3978000	3981000	Yeah, well, it looks like Zelda, but it doesn't play anything like it.
3981000	3982000	It plays more like Rogue.
3982000	3983000	No, it doesn't.
3983000	3985000	It really is Rogue.
3985000	3987000	It was alright, I started it.
3987000	3992000	I think I need to do like Operation Play My Steam games or something like that, because
3992000	3997000	I seriously have like 150 games that I know I haven't touched a lot of them.
3997000	3999000	A lot of them are like, dude, I gotta get that, especially like Arma 2.
3999000	4002000	I need to get that to play DayZ.
4002000	4004000	Not touched it once.
4004000	4005000	Not even a single time.
4005000	4008000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and games that
4008000	4011000	are coming a whole lot sooner than summer 2014, like this week.
4011000	4014000	Yeah, not a whole lot this week, but there are some actual games.
4014000	4020000	Dark on Xbox 360, kind of a stealth vampire game that's okay, I guess.
4021000	4028000	That's coming from Calypso NCAA Football, 2014, coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox
4028000	4030000	360 this week.
4030000	4038000	The Metal Gear Solid Collection, Legacy Collection, which is pretty much all your Metal Gear games
4038000	4049000	that you could possibly want on the PlayStation 3, including, they even have like the original
4049000	4054000	Metal Gear games in there as well, so that's kind of cool.
4054000	4062000	And I want to say also this week, I think was the expansion for Civilization V?
4062000	4063000	Woot!
4063000	4064000	It is this week.
4064000	4068000	So, yeah, so that'll be coming out as well.
4068000	4071000	I'm trying to think, did I forget anything else here?
4071000	4075000	Let's see here.
4075000	4077000	Yeah, Brave New World was this week.
4077000	4078000	Okay, cool.
4078000	4083000	And I thought there was one other game.
4083000	4084000	I'm forgetting here.
4084000	4087000	What is it?
4087000	4088000	Nope.
4088000	4089000	Nope, that was it.
4089000	4090000	All right.
4090000	4092000	Then let's travel over to Japan and check out some of the releases over there on the
4092000	4094000	PlayStation 3 this week.
4094000	4099000	On kind of an off cycle day, July 10th, Nobunaga no Yabu Online, Tenka Mugen no Shu comes out
4099000	4101000	in Treasure and regular editions.
4101000	4103000	I'm thinking that's an expansion.
4103000	4107000	I think Nobunaga no Yabu is already out there, so I think this is an expansion version that's
4107000	4108000	coming out from Koe.
4108000	4112000	Of course, the Nobunaga games have been huge in Japan for years, but they never really
4112000	4114000	seem to catch on here the same way.
4114000	4117000	But coming out on July 11th, Battlefield 3 gets a price reduction.
4117000	4120000	Dead Island Riptide gets its Japanese release.
4120000	4123000	Metal Gear Solid, the Legacy Collection will be there as well.
4123000	4128000	And something called a PlayStation 3 HDD Recorder Pack in 250 gig.
4128000	4133000	I think that's, oh, yeah, they have the whole, like, TiVo thing built into the PS3s in some
4133000	4134000	places over there.
4134000	4137000	So we don't really have that so much here.
4137000	4142000	So you have that to look forward to if you need a 250 gig drive for all your TV recording
4142000	4143000	in Japan.
4143000	4147000	Otherwise, on the Xbox 360 this week, Dead Island Riptide also gets its release there
4147000	4150000	and Battlefield 3 a price reduction.
4150000	4153000	Monster Hunter Frontier G2 also gets a premium package.
4153000	4156000	That, again, is on the Xbox 360.
4156000	4160000	On the PlayStation Vita this week, not a lot unless you need some new headphones because
4160000	4162000	that's a peripheral that's out this week.
4162000	4169000	On the Wii U, July 13th, we'll see the release of New Super Luigi U as well as Pikmin 3.
4169000	4172000	Kind of bam, bam, getting hit with two games there.
4172000	4179000	There's a new Wii U Premium Set 32 gig in white also to look forward to on that day.
4179000	4183000	So kind of another little, I'm sure there will be a lot of promotion, almost like a
4183000	4186000	soft relaunch of the Wii U with some of those games behind it.
4187000	4195000	On the 3DS, not a lot, but there is Yuukai Watch, which is, I'm trying to see what this game is.
4195000	4197000	Is it Yuukai or Yo-kai?
4197000	4198000	I think it's Yo-kai.
4198000	4200000	That means monster or demon watch.
4200000	4204000	It definitely is some type of little kitty demon thing.
4205000	4207000	I wonder if that's based on an anime.
4207000	4208000	It's an RPG.
4208000	4209000	Yeah, Yo-kai.
4210000	4215000	Alright, and let me look at the PSP because there's still games that come out there occasionally.
4217000	4219000	Yes, actually there are quite a few things this week.
4219000	4222000	Samurai Do Portable gets a price reduction.
4222000	4232000	As far as new games go, there is Hanayakakana Waraga Ichizoku Saugare Polar Star in regular and limited edition.
4232000	4236000	And there's even a whole little set you can get with this as well.
4237000	4239000	Alright, that's it for Japanese releases.
4239000	4240000	How about the UK?
4240000	4242000	Some stuff.
4242000	4246000	On July 8th, we have Kavinsky for mobile Android iPad iPhone.
4246000	4251000	On the 11th, we have Star Wars Pinball for Wii U and Tiny Thief for iPhone.
4251000	4254000	On the 12th, we have a Dynasty Warriors 8.
4256000	4257000	That's all.
4257000	4258000	Alright, just a few more stories for you guys.
4258000	4261000	And yes, she got here in time to do the classic game of the week.
4261000	4267000	I sped past a CHP guy and he didn't even bat an eye.
4268000	4270000	He's like, go on girl, you go.
4270000	4273000	We would have rolled it over until she got here if we had to.
4273000	4276000	But we do have a couple more stories now that we're back on track. Loki.
4276000	4281000	Sorry, you put Saints Row in there as a classic game of the week.
4282000	4285000	I did play a lot of Commodore 64 games this week too.
4286000	4290000	Rob, they had all kinds of Atari computers and I played R-Type.
4290000	4291000	Did you?
4291000	4292000	Yeah.
4292000	4294000	And it sucks on the joystick, just saying.
4294000	4296000	Save it for the next half of the show, Loki.
4297000	4301000	So now there's another new feature coming to Steam and that is Twitch integration.
4301000	4305000	You can actually link your Twitch account with your Steam account.
4305000	4308000	And of course, what's the first thing that's going to make use of it?
4308000	4311000	Dota 2. Yay.
4311000	4320000	You'll be able to, I guess, watch Dota tournaments in-game or via, I guess, Twitch.
4320000	4324000	I don't know if they're going to have a specific app or something as part of the Steam store.
4325000	4326000	I don't know.
4326000	4329000	I didn't really poke around for that because I'm not really a big Dota 2 player.
4329000	4334000	I've tried it and, you know, it's just, that's a genre I haven't been able to crack yet.
4334000	4337000	So the whole, what do they call those? Mobas?
4337000	4339000	Yeah, Massive Online Battle Arena.
4339000	4340000	Yeah.
4340000	4341000	MobaMoga?
4341000	4342000	MobaMoga?
4342000	4346000	So, yeah, I haven't really gotten into those hardcore.
4346000	4350000	But it doesn't sound like you can stream through this Twitch integration.
4350000	4353000	Like, Origin supposedly let you do, although it never worked for me.
4354000	4360000	Yeah, you can't stream, but you can actually, I guess, watch it.
4360000	4365000	And they said also that you can, what was it?
4365000	4370000	You can get, like, oh, actually, they're launching this August 7th.
4370000	4372000	So it's not something you can do yet.
4372000	4375000	But I don't know if they're going to have-
4375000	4377000	That's why I haven't seen ads for it. That makes sense now.
4377000	4387000	Yes, I guess now, I guess you can receive special items if you watch certain tournaments or something like that.
4387000	4391000	So they're going to have, how much do you want to bet? Steam trading cards?
4391000	4393000	How much do you want to bet?
4393000	4397000	Twitch, Twitch, Twitch. And I'm not talking about the website. That is actually my head twitching.
4399000	4400000	Alright.
4401000	4403000	Hey, Bobby, you know what VoG needs?
4403000	4404000	Uh oh.
4404000	4405000	Trading cards.
4406000	4408000	Oh god, don't give him ideas.
4411000	4412000	VoG trading cards.
4412000	4413000	You could trade the loot.
4413000	4414000	That would be fun to make.
4414000	4416000	You could maybe trade the loot or something.
4416000	4418000	I could totally make trading cards.
4418000	4419000	Oh boy, here we go.
4419000	4420000	If you pay me for it.
4420000	4423000	You know who does, you know who does some pretty interesting cards?
4423000	4424000	I'll pay you in Pinkberry.
4424000	4426000	Ooh, I could deal with that.
4426000	4427000	Bresl, you know.
4428000	4429000	Oh yeah, he does his little-
4429000	4434000	You know, I've got like four magic cards from him, and one of them was from when Shermy was alive, and it was Geek Cat.
4434000	4436000	So Shermy is a magic card.
4436000	4437000	Aww.
4437000	4438000	Yeah, she's a legend.
4438000	4439000	That's fun.
4439000	4443000	Alright, one more story for you guys, and it's about the Double Fine Project Broken Age.
4443000	4447000	This is probably the first Kickstarter project most of us heard about it.
4447000	4448000	Oh god.
4448000	4451000	And yeah, Broken Age apparently needs a little more money.
4451000	4454000	Well, here's the thing. I've heard two sides to this story.
4454000	4456000	I've heard, so I'm going to read this.
4456000	4458000	As it was reported on Joystiq here, it says,
4458000	4464000	they need more capital than the 3.3 million that it crowdfunded in March of 2012 through Kickstarter.
4464000	4466000	And there's a backers only update that says,
4466000	4470000	quote, even though we received much more money from our Kickstarter than we or anybody anticipated,
4470000	4475000	that didn't stop me from getting excited and designing a game so big that it would need even more money.
4475000	4482000	So Double Fine will release the, I guess a refined version of the first half of the game in January of 2014,
4482000	4487000	when the income through early access should give production for the rest of the game.
4487000	4491000	Now, I saw this somewhere, I don't know if it was Twitter or Tumblr or both,
4491000	4495000	that people might be misconstruing this a bit and that they're actually trying,
4495000	4498000	they're not trying to raise the money for this project,
4498000	4503000	but they're putting it out there early so they can raise the capital to do other projects.
4503000	4508000	So the media might be jumping, like crossing lines a little bit here saying,
4508000	4514000	oh, Kickstarter screwed up and nobody knows what the fuck they're doing on that site.
4514000	4519000	I think they're just a little suspicious because, you know,
4519000	4524000	first they did this and they raised so much money and, you know, it should be enough.
4524000	4528000	Of course, you know, you adjust your budget for your game when you get a ton of extra revenue and stuff.
4528000	4531000	And that's why they have those stretch goals and stuff like that.
4531000	4537000	And then, of course, there's the massive Chalice game that's also being done by them
4537000	4543000	that also just got Kickstarted that they're getting funding for already for a game that they haven't even finished the first one.
4543000	4546000	Yeah, I mean, I understand they have multiple teams working over there.
4546000	4551000	And now they're really, you know, they're trying to raise more funding for, you know,
4551000	4556000	what originally seemed like this original game, but it may be for a future project.
4556000	4561000	So it's like kind of like you guys are asking for a lot of money from us for different things.
4561000	4564000	And yet you still haven't been able to deliver on anything yet.
4564000	4566000	And I think that's kind of where the suspicion is.
4566000	4569000	But you know what? That's unlike a lot of the Kickstarter projects.
4569000	4572000	And, you know, even with the Ouya and stuff, you raise all this money, why couldn't you deliver them on time?
4572000	4576000	Well, it's because you can use DHL. I mean, all the money in the world is not going to make DHL good.
4576000	4579000	I mean, seriously.
4579000	4583000	Well, all the money in the world could maybe get FedExed to buy them.
4583000	4586000	At least it didn't ship them Old Dominion. It wouldn't be here yet.
4586000	4590000	It would be on a freaking turtle in the middle of the ocean, OK?
4590000	4597000	All right, let's travel back to a time that was a lot more simpler than this.
4597000	4599000	A lot more simpler?
4599000	4601000	A lot more simpler with its grammar.
4601000	4605000	You know what? You didn't have to wait for DHL to ship your game from Hong Kong.
4605000	4608000	You walked into Best and you bought it.
4608000	4611000	Oh, no, no. You got it from Montgomery Ward, who's the mail order.
4611000	4615000	That's right. It's the classic game of the week.
4615000	4620000	And then you'd get out your little magazine and order something from Funkoland.
4620000	4623000	You check the price of it on their little newspaper.
4623000	4626000	You know that was Dan started at Funkoland before the game came out?
4626000	4628000	No, I know, I know, yeah.
4628000	4632000	I remember when they were an ad on the back of the magazine offering to buy your games.
4632000	4636000	But anyway, the classic game of the week.
4636000	4640000	Millipede. Not centipede. Millipede.
4640000	4644000	And it was also known as Millipede Revenge of the Giant Instinct.
4644000	4646000	Insects. Why do I say instincts?
4646000	4651000	Miripido Kyodai Konchuu no Gyakushuu.
4651000	4654000	And that was its Famicom release.
4654000	4656000	It came out in 1982 by Atari.
4656000	4658000	It is the sequel to Centipede.
4658000	4664000	And basically you have to score as many points as possible by destroying all the segments of the millipede as it moves down on the screen.
4664000	4667000	When you destroy a section, it becomes a mushroom.
4667000	4671000	And you use a trackball to play it.
4671000	4673000	So you don't even need a joystick. This is old school.
4673000	4674000	And guess what?
4674000	4679000	The reason why I brought this up is because we actually had a prototype cartridge of it for the Atari 5200.
4679000	4684000	So when I bring up lists, I will tell you if you have an Atari 5200, I will tell you how to get it.
4684000	4686000	Atari age. They're great people. Anyway.
4686000	4690000	So basically, the big differences between Millipede and Centipede.
4690000	4692000	And keep in mind, I like Millipede better than Centipede.
4692000	4696000	Is that the earwig is the same as the scorpion and centipede.
4696000	4698000	So it makes poisonous mushrooms.
4698000	4701000	And it makes the millipede charge right towards the bottom.
4701000	4705000	The bee basically does the same thing as the centipede.
4705000	4707000	It drops mushrooms on a vertical line.
4707000	4708000	And takes two shots to kill.
4708000	4710000	The spider bounces all over the screen.
4710000	4713000	But you can get multiple spiders. You have an inchworm.
4713000	4717000	And when it hits, it slows all the enemies on the screen for a short period of time.
4717000	4720000	You have the beetle that crawls around the player area.
4720000	4722000	And then goes into the leaves.
4722000	4725000	And it turns any mushroom it touches into indestructible flowers.
4725000	4729000	And when it hits, everything on the screen scrolls down one row.
4729000	4731000	The dragonfly drops mushrooms while zigzagging.
4731000	4733000	And it can be destroyed with one shot.
4733000	4735000	The mosquito bounces off the sides.
4735000	4738000	And when you hit it, it scrolls the screen up one row.
4738000	4742000	And then there's a DDT bomb that you can blow up with one shot.
4742000	4746000	And it destroys all the enemies and mushrooms within its blast radius.
4746000	4750000	But when the mushrooms scroll down, a new bomb is added at the top of the screen.
4750000	4753000	So you can have up to four bombs in play at a time.
4753000	4760000	Basically, when you get rid of all of the poisoned mushrooms, they all revert to normal.
4760000	4765000	And they all turn into normal when you lose a life.
4765000	4769000	So they don't have to worry about that if you happen to suck and die.
4770000	4774000	And you have new mushrooms growing on the field when others go.
4774000	4776000	And it's just really awesome.
4776000	4778000	It's basically just scrolling and shooting as fast as possible.
4778000	4781000	And to me this was harder than centipede.
4781000	4783000	And a lot more challenging.
4783000	4785000	It just moved a lot faster.
4785000	4786000	It was so much fun.
4786000	4790000	And it has... centipede and millipede both have the best 1-up sound.
4790000	4792000	The...
4792000	4794000	Which I can't do because I have no voice...
4795000	4797000	As far as releases that came out.
4797000	4802000	It came out on the Atari 8-bit and ST computer line and the Atari 2600.
4802000	4806000	There was a NES version published in 1985.
4806000	4811000	It came out with centipede on the Game Boy as Arcade Classics number 2 centipede millipede.
4811000	4815000	It was released with centipede on Xbox 360 on Xbox Live Arcade.
4815000	4818000	And it was going to be...
4818000	4822000	The Atari 2600 port was going to be a launch title for the Xbox 360
4822000	4825000	and the Games For Windows Live Game Room thing.
4825000	4829000	It was on the Game Room on May 26, 2010.
4829000	4831000	Now like I was saying...
4831000	4834000	There are various prototype carts out there.
4834000	4837000	We have a version for Atari 5200.
4837000	4841000	And I believe it might have been a...
4843000	4847000	A conversion from one of the PC versions.
4847000	4849000	But it's really good.
4849000	4852000	We've got Atari Trackball, which is almost as big as an Atari 5200.
4852000	4855000	And if you've ever seen an Atari 5200, that sucker's huge.
4855000	4859000	You know, I was not a fan of this on the Xbox 360 Arcade.
4859000	4861000	And you know why? No Trackball.
4861000	4863000	You cannot play this game without a Trackball.
4863000	4865000	Trackball or get out.
4865000	4868000	If you play it on an Atari 2600 joystick, it's not the same.
4868000	4870000	It's not the same.
4870000	4872000	It's like playing Tempest without a Trackball.
4872000	4874000	Well, you know what?
4874000	4876000	You need the twist dial for Tempest.
4876000	4878000	That's what I meant.
4878000	4880000	We were actually going to try to make a...
4880000	4883000	Because we actually have Tempest 5200.
4883000	4886000	Actually, Tempest with a Trackball, though, is okay.
4886000	4888000	Tempest worked well with a Trackball.
4888000	4891000	And if a mouse is on the right settings, that's like the closest you get.
4891000	4893000	But it just doesn't work.
4893000	4896000	But then again, Tempest 2000 was pretty kickass.
4896000	4898000	Well, I'm going to go ahead and say, as I said earlier,
4898000	4901000	that for anybody who happens to have an Atari 5200,
4901000	4904000	go to Atari Age, you can buy the copy.
4904000	4907000	I think that we paid like 25 for ours.
4907000	4910000	We also did get a copy of Tempest for the Atari 5200.
4910000	4913000	And I'll tell you, they're great people.
4913000	4915000	They make really quality products.
4915000	4921000	They come in, I believe it's refurbished cartridges, repurposed cartridges.
4921000	4924000	And it's just, they're great people.
4924000	4931000	So if you've got the 5200, definitely get their release of Millipede.
4931000	4933000	As far as high scores, by the way,
4933000	4937000	there was a high score set by Donald Hayes in New Hampshire
4937000	4941000	of 10,627,331 points.
4941000	4943000	That was in 1994.
4943000	4948000	And then the highest score in tournament play was also set by him
4948000	4950000	at almost 7,000,000 points.
4950000	4956000	The default high scores in the arcade are actually FXL and ED.
4956000	4959000	ED is for Ed Log, who was the design and programmer.
4959000	4964000	And Franz Lasinger was also a designer and tester.
4964000	4968000	And it was the only way that they could get their credits in the game
4968000	4972000	because at the time Atari didn't allow them to put their credits in.
4972000	4974000	And that is your trivia.
4974000	4976000	That is a classic game. It is Millipede.
4976000	4979000	All right. Millipede is the classic game of the week.
4979000	4982000	A very fitting choice considering some of the shenanigans
4982000	4983000	you've been up to this week.
4983000	4986000	And I'm sure we'll get something out of California Xtreme next week.
4986000	4988000	Have you ever done the Journey video game? It might be time.
4988000	4989000	It might be time.
4989000	4991000	I have. Well, not the Journey video game.
4991000	4993000	But I've played it a bunch of times.
4993000	4995000	And then I screamed and cried a little bit and felt sick.
4995000	4996000	All right.
4996000	4998000	And as I say, just hold on.
4998000	5002000	Because the Atari 800, there's mentions of it coming up next part.
5002000	5004000	All right.
5004000	5007000	As far as what systems I don't have, I do not have the Fairchild Channel-F.
5007000	5008000	Just saying.
5008000	5010000	If somebody's looking to buy a Darksider system.
5010000	5013000	Or the first Magnavox Odyssey. But I do have an Odyssey, too.
5013000	5015000	Do you have a Virtual Boy?
5015000	5016000	Yes, I do.
5016000	5017000	Wow. I didn't know that.
5017000	5019000	There's a Virtual Boy that came in the phone case.
5019000	5022000	Because Dan bought it from Blockbuster.
5022000	5024000	I want to come over and get a headache.
5024000	5025000	Sure.
5025000	5027000	Maybe we'll have a great big headache party.
5027000	5029000	I'll play my 3DS on 3D.
5029000	5030000	And you can play the Virtual Boy.
5030000	5032000	And then we'll both be in pain.
5032000	5034000	And then we'll spin around until we barf.
5034000	5035000	Yay.
5035000	5038000	Don't they have an Oculus Rift emulator or something like that
5038000	5040000	that has Virtual Boy?
5040000	5042000	That wouldn't surprise me at all, actually.
5042000	5044000	This Oculus Rift thing is going to be interesting
5044000	5046000	when it's at a consumer level, you know?
5046000	5048000	Coffee.
5048000	5050000	What do I look like, Dan?
5050000	5052000	Anyhow.
5052000	5054000	No.
5054000	5056000	Alright.
5056000	5058000	Let us take a break here.
5058000	5059000	We're going to take a quick break.
5059000	5061000	And when we come back with more of Orange Lawn Radio,
5061000	5064000	Darksider's going to talk to us about Atari Party.
5064000	5066000	You're going to talk to us through our full question of the week
5066000	5068000	about board games and video games colliding.
5068000	5069000	I am.
5069000	5071000	I met you, the audience.
5071000	5073000	But you can talk to us about it, too, if you want, Darksider.
5073000	5074000	No, I don't want to.
5074000	5075000	What, you don't like board games?
5075000	5076000	I like card games.
5076000	5077000	Alright.
5077000	5080000	Because I've been, I've had my mind blown with Cards Against Humanity.
5080000	5083000	And we like your emails, and we like to do some FUs of the Week,
5083000	5084000	and we like to take your phone calls.
5084000	5089000	All that when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5089000	5097000	Hi there.
5097000	5099000	This is Redertainment.
5099000	5102000	And you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio,
5102000	5105000	the show where every gamer has a voice.
5105000	5108000	And I want to use my voice to tell you that
5108000	5113000	Garris ain't got nothing on Samantha Trainer.
5113000	5117000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live.
5117000	5122000	Tonight, July the 7th of 2013, and we are back,
5122000	5127000	Episode 511 of our show with all of you, live.vognetwork.com.
5127000	5129000	And DarkSakura, she's here now.
5129000	5130000	And I have coffee.
5130000	5134000	After running a variety of errands and so forth.
5134000	5135000	I'm giddy still.
5135000	5136000	I'm giddy.
5136000	5137000	Yeah?
5137000	5139000	I'm showing off the pictures of the house like it's a cat.
5139000	5141000	Well, just be careful.
5141000	5142000	Get the keys first.
5142000	5143000	I know, I know.
5143000	5144000	Well, we're-
5144000	5146000	I don't need to press Sakura should anything go wrong next week.
5146000	5148000	I am just saying that we're in a good position.
5148000	5149000	Yeah.
5149000	5150000	We're in a good position.
5150000	5153000	And it would take us about 30 to 45 days to get in the house,
5153000	5154000	assuming everything goes fluidly.
5154000	5155000	Swell.
5155000	5156000	Well, good luck.
5156000	5158000	We're all crossing our fingers and toes,
5158000	5160000	but I don't want to see you pissed off.
5160000	5162000	But they have to see our conditioner first.
5162000	5163000	All right.
5163000	5164000	And I got to say, though,
5164000	5166000	that a new house doesn't exactly make for
5166000	5169000	as exciting swap note pictures as a cat.
5169000	5170000	That's true.
5170000	5173000	I could put little doki-doki symbols on the house
5173000	5174000	and make it blush.
5174000	5176000	Or I could make it, you know,
5176000	5178000	demonic like the house from Poltergeist or something.
5178000	5179000	Nice.
5179000	5180000	All right.
5180000	5182000	Well, let's talk about Atari Party.
5182000	5184000	Since I've been telling the listeners you went to this,
5184000	5186000	and I'm sure our retro gaming fans can appreciate
5186000	5188000	the fun of Atari Parties.
5188000	5189000	Tell us a little bit about what it is
5189000	5191000	and what you experienced when you went.
5191000	5192000	Atari Party.
5192000	5194000	And basically this has happened, I think,
5194000	5197000	every year for the last, I want to say six years or so.
5197000	5199000	And also you can look on Facebook.
5199000	5201000	The Atari Party folks have a page.
5202000	5206000	But this guy put everything together.
5206000	5208000	He brings a lot of his own stuff.
5208000	5211000	And volunteers can bring their own systems.
5211000	5216000	We had just all kinds of things across the board.
5216000	5220000	Like, we were the only ones there with a 5200,
5220000	5222000	but we brought two of them.
5222000	5224000	And then someone had an Atari flashback set up.
5224000	5228000	There was a Jaguar set up on the big screen.
5228000	5232000	So there was some Tempest and some Dragon's Lair going on.
5232000	5234000	We were going to set up Alien vs. Predator
5234000	5236000	in the little conference room to the side,
5236000	5239000	but people ended up bringing their food in there.
5239000	5241000	There were definitely Atari 800s.
5241000	5244000	There were Atari, that was the computer.
5244000	5246000	There were STs.
5246000	5249000	There was a couple links set up.
5249000	5252000	In fact, I believe that every Atari computer
5252000	5254000	had a representation there.
5254000	5256000	And let me look through my photos
5256000	5258000	because I took pictures of a lot of the systems.
5258000	5260000	In fact, one thing that really impressed me
5260000	5262000	is that someone brought in an Atari touchpad.
5262000	5264000	There were 7200s.
5264000	5267000	There were just all kinds of stuff.
5267000	5269000	So why?
5269000	5272000	Why Atari Party?
5272000	5276000	Because people love Atari. Why not? It's fun.
5276000	5278000	People need to remember their roots.
5278000	5279000	I was kind of hoping the answer would be that.
5279000	5280000	Why the hell not?
5280000	5282000	When's Commodore Party?
5282000	5283000	Am I invited to Commodore Party?
5283000	5285000	You can start Commodore Party.
5285000	5288000	But see, it was funny because this was at
5288000	5291000	one of the Davis Public Libraries
5291000	5294000	over by the, sorry, Library,
5294000	5298000	over by this park that Atari Party used to be at.
5298000	5300000	The People's Republic of Davis.
5300000	5301000	Abandon all hope ye who enter.
5301000	5302000	Exactly.
5302000	5305000	Abandon hope of having your car not pooped on.
5305000	5308000	Tiger Claw on Chat says,
5308000	5311000	did they have some Atari arcade games too?
5312000	5316000	There was a guy there who,
5316000	5319000	I think he came from,
5319000	5321000	he came from out of state. I know that.
5321000	5325000	But he hooked up an emulator that had different
5325000	5327000	emulated games.
5327000	5331000	He even had any game that had been on an Atari system.
5331000	5335000	He had the arcade versions of plus the
5335000	5337000	regular Atari, various Atari versions.
5337000	5340000	I didn't realize that people came out of state for this.
5340000	5341000	I thought it was kind of a locals thing.
5341000	5344000	A lot of people were more like just from out of,
5344000	5347000	like our friends Tim and his girlfriend
5347000	5350000	came from the Bay Area.
5350000	5353000	Oh, okay. Like Reno is, you know, out of state,
5353000	5354000	but it's not that far.
5354000	5356000	Yeah, no, this guy I think came from a couple states over.
5356000	5359000	So I didn't ask him.
5359000	5362000	To be honest, my sign language isn't that great.
5362000	5363000	I didn't mention he's deaf.
5363000	5367000	But he was using his iPad as a communication tool.
5367000	5370000	And like I am way out of practice with my ASL.
5370000	5373000	So, yeah.
5373000	5376000	But we, funny, Rage Nator asks,
5376000	5380000	would two Atari 5200s equal an Atari 10400?
5380000	5383000	No, because they don't do that.
5383000	5386000	One of the pictures I got of a really good version
5386000	5391000	of Pac-Man was played on an Atari 1200 XL.
5391000	5394000	There were several different Atari computers there.
5394000	5395000	Like I said earlier,
5395000	5397000	there was one that was running R-Type.
5397000	5399000	Another one running Ghost and Gallows.
5399000	5402000	Just the thing is that while they make the games look pretty,
5402000	5404000	they don't sound too fantastic.
5404000	5406000	And the control was shit.
5406000	5409000	It's just really hard to play either of those games on a keyboard
5409000	5411000	or with the joystick, with an analog joystick
5411000	5414000	that just keeps wanting to recenter itself.
5416000	5418000	I'm looking at the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
5418000	5421000	SSJ100Matt says, I saw Dan's pictures on Facebook
5421000	5423000	and I thought it was really cool
5423000	5426000	to see kids playing systems that were twice their age.
5426000	5429000	You know what, that was something that we were discussing
5429000	5431000	during the event.
5431000	5433000	I mean, there were a lot of kids that,
5433000	5435000	I mean, some of them came with their parents
5435000	5436000	that remembered everything.
5436000	5440000	I met a really nice guy who actually had a Japanese 3DS,
5440000	5443000	so I now have a Japanese tag on my 3DS.
5443000	5445000	Well, right here, I should say.
5445000	5450000	And, you know, I just chatted with a lot of folks
5450000	5454000	and we all had the same love of old, stinky systems.
5454000	5457000	And there were, though, a lot of people like,
5457000	5459000	oh my god, you have a 5200, rah, rah, rah.
5459000	5462000	And I was like, dude, you have a working 7200,
5462000	5467000	or 7800, yeah, with the worst joysticks ever.
5467000	5469000	Oh my god, now the Atari 5200,
5469000	5471000	the joysticks were notorious for breaking.
5471000	5473000	We had some good replacements
5473000	5476000	and Dan made a dedicated button pad to work with it.
5476000	5479000	But because we had that trackball,
5479000	5481000	a lot of people, you should see people
5481000	5483000	trying to play Dig Dug with trackball, it's hilarious.
5483000	5486000	But Dan was saying that he noticed a lot of girls
5486000	5489000	were sitting down and wanting to play Qbert.
5489000	5492000	Like, he had the most, he was saying,
5492000	5496000	it was like, I think that he noticed
5496000	5498000	that enough women were sitting down
5498000	5500000	and actually just playing Qbert above all else.
5500000	5502000	So, and then he's like, is it a girl thing?
5502000	5503000	Is Qbert a girl thing?
5503000	5505000	I was like, well, maybe it's the nose, huh?
5505000	5508000	Wow, is Qbert a girl thing?
5508000	5510000	I like Qbert, what the hell does that mean?
5510000	5512000	I like Qbert, but you know what my game is
5512000	5514000	on the Atari 5200 is Kix.
5514000	5516000	Oh yeah, Kix is a fun game.
5516000	5518000	I sat and played like a crap ton of Kix.
5518000	5520000	I got like three split Kixes in a row.
5520000	5524000	Kix was basically the inspiration for Miss Nude World 96.
5524000	5526000	Yes it was, but it was better.
5526000	5528000	No it didn't, it didn't have techno music.
5528000	5529000	Or boobies.
5529000	5531000	Raginator in chat says, I gotta ask,
5531000	5534000	did anyone bring the 2600 version of Pac-Man
5534000	5535000	or even E.T.?
5535000	5537000	Yes, several people did.
5537000	5539000	And I played 2600 Pac-Man.
5539000	5541000	I actually made it pretty far on 2600 Pac-Man.
5541000	5543000	We did have people bringing E.T.
5543000	5545000	And I actually sat next to some guy
5545000	5547000	and I was like, you do realize
5547000	5549000	that this is like a prime example
5549000	5551000	of gamer masochism, right?
5551000	5552000	He's like, yeah.
5552000	5554000	I was like, so you're just into that kind of thing?
5554000	5555000	He's like, yeah.
5555000	5556000	And then we started, remember that story
5556000	5558000	we brought up though where the town in Arizona
5558000	5560000	was willing to let the dump be excavated?
5560000	5562000	Well, a couple of people hadn't heard that
5562000	5564000	so we were talking about it and they're like,
5564000	5567000	well, we get to find out if it's, uh...
5567000	5569000	Ugh, fuck.
5569000	5572000	Rob, that hurts my soul.
5572000	5574000	I love that game.
5574000	5576000	This is some iconic noise though.
5576000	5578000	Like, it's funny.
5578000	5581000	But keep in mind, this is the best they did
5581000	5582000	with what they had.
5582000	5584000	Oh yeah, no, if you read the stories
5584000	5586000	about how these games had to be programmed
5586000	5587000	like with such a short turnaround
5587000	5589000	and the coding in these games is so tight,
5589000	5591000	like you actually...
5591000	5594000	You have no room for bonuses.
5594000	5596000	It's kind of impressive.
5596000	5598000	I think the guy that programmed Jungle Hunt
5598000	5601000	has some weird Easter egg in that
5601000	5604000	where if you get a certain score at a certain time
5604000	5609000	and do a silly dance and then interpretive music,
5609000	5612000	then maybe a prayer to Satan or something,
5612000	5616000	then you can see his initials pop up for five seconds.
5616000	5618000	Now the ET game, do you know the history
5618000	5620000	of why the ET game is this bad?
5620000	5623000	Yes. Howard Scott Warshaw, who did some great games,
5623000	5626000	he did Yars Revenge, he only had like...
5626000	5627000	Three weeks.
5627000	5628000	Yeah, oh yeah.
5628000	5629000	Three weeks to put out.
5629000	5632000	And the reason why there were so many copies of it
5632000	5635000	is they were expecting that because of the movie tie-in,
5635000	5637000	because the movies sold so much,
5637000	5639000	that they were expecting the game to equally sell as much
5639000	5642000	and basically it had high sales during its first week
5642000	5644000	and then people realized how bad it was
5644000	5648000	and that's where that urban legend of there being
5648000	5651000	just that dump full of ET cartridges.
5651000	5655000	I want to see a 48-hour game jam to make new ET games.
5655000	5657000	You know, I remember a story we covered on the show
5657000	5660000	not that long ago where somebody actually fixed ET.
5660000	5661000	I'm using my quarter fingers.
5661000	5663000	Yeah, where they went back and made the collision detection
5663000	5667000	not so crazy and just made the game better, basically.
5667000	5669000	Well, I mean, the equivalent of doing this in three weeks
5669000	5671000	was me doing my final exam in one day
5671000	5673000	for my web design class.
5673000	5675000	Yeah, my site looks pretty good, but could have been better.
5675000	5679000	Yeah, it could have actually worked, too.
5679000	5683000	But, well, actually I did three days,
5683000	5685000	got my web design stuff done.
5685000	5688000	But anyway, going back to what was there,
5688000	5690000	there was a really good representation
5690000	5693000	and not just Atari systems, too.
5693000	5695000	There were people who brought in Atari collections.
5695000	5699000	Like I said, there was an Atari flashback,
5699000	5703000	but someone also brought a Nintendo with the Atari games
5703000	5706000	that were released for Nintendo, an NES.
5706000	5709000	And there was a PlayStation with one of the, sorry,
5709000	5712000	a PS2 with one of the collections on it.
5712000	5715000	Someone had a Game Boy, two Game Boy SPs
5715000	5720000	with various Atari collection packs on it.
5720000	5722000	And like I said, we had Linksys.
5722000	5725000	We had various computer setups.
5725000	5726000	There were actually a lot more computer setups
5726000	5728000	than console setups, I noticed.
5728000	5731000	And then there was a raffle, and some jerk face
5731000	5732000	ran off with one of the books for the raffle.
5733000	5735000	So someone had to go without a prize.
5735000	5737000	Oh, no, like legit, oh, I thought you were saying
5737000	5739000	that like, oh, he won what I wanted.
5739000	5741000	It was like a book about Atari stuff.
5741000	5743000	No, some guy legit stole it.
5743000	5744000	Asshole.
5744000	5747000	Yeah, the guy who ran it, Bill,
5747000	5749000	and Bill is just, he's so great for,
5749000	5750000	he had the best shirt, too.
5750000	5752000	He had one of the ghost monsters being chased
5752000	5756000	by the Act01 all in pixels, you know, from Ghostbusters.
5756000	5757000	It was really cute.
5757000	5758000	And his kids were there.
5758000	5760000	And there were like lots of,
5760000	5764000	I would probably say preteen and up aged kids,
5764000	5766000	and just going around and having a good time,
5766000	5769000	and getting to see these things.
5769000	5771000	Oh, and I've actually heard flat out,
5771000	5774000	I've never seen this game before, this is fun.
5774000	5776000	Just goes to show that you don't have to have
5776000	5780000	the shiniest graphics to make a really good game.
5780000	5785000	And like, Dan, we had to stay relatively near his stuff
5785000	5788000	because we had so many 5200 games
5788000	5791000	that we brought with us in the protos.
5791000	5796000	But we had a few rounds of Super Pac-Man going on,
5796000	5799000	and if anyone wants to look, a few days back,
5799000	5802000	well, actually just yesterday's stuff on my Tumblr,
5802000	5808000	my Tumblr is Kurotsubasa, it's K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A.
5808000	5810000	I have some of my photos from Atari Party,
5810000	5813000	and if you're on Facebook and a friend of me,
5813000	5816000	I did put up a thing, but I will go to my fan page
5816000	5818000	and share the photos there so that people can see
5818000	5820000	the photos from Atari Party.
5820000	5821000	Cool.
5821000	5823000	I had a really good time, it was just fun,
5823000	5825000	and the guys bought us sodas, and I didn't drink any
5825000	5827000	because they're regular Coke.
5827000	5831000	So more classic gaming next week with California Extreme.
5831000	5833000	Yeah, I didn't know that California Extreme was next week,
5833000	5835000	and Dan's like, so you're going to California Extreme with me?
5835000	5836000	I guess so.
5836000	5838000	Are you going to be back for the show?
5838000	5839000	Saturday.
5839000	5841000	Oh yeah, well it runs all weekend long.
5841000	5843000	But we're not going for the whole thing, because money.
5843000	5844000	Sure, sure.
5844000	5845000	Okay.
5845000	5847000	Well, I want to move on with the show,
5847000	5849000	get into rapid fire news, but I did want to ask about
5849000	5851000	your gaming week outside of Atari Party.
5851000	5853000	Have you played anything this week besides Atari?
5853000	5854000	Besides Atari games?
5854000	5857000	Well, I wanted to play Final Fantasy XIV this weekend
5857000	5860000	because I wanted to start my scholar.
5860000	5861000	You can't.
5861000	5863000	Arcana still isn't in the beta.
5863000	5864000	Ah, fuck!
5864000	5865000	You wouldn't have been able to anyway.
5865000	5866000	Well, poop.
5866000	5871000	Well, then I wanted to get at least past level 15.
5872000	5874000	I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing because,
5874000	5876000	you know, I got my 3DS last weekend.
5876000	5879000	Thank you, thank you, thank you, slidekick.
5879000	5885000	I have paid off my mortgage, two room expansions,
5885000	5888000	my upstairs, and I'm paying off my upstairs room expansion.
5888000	5891000	I've been to the island, it doesn't really get me,
5891000	5893000	it kind of gets me some good money.
5893000	5895000	I have fruit everywhere.
5895000	5897000	Beetles, nothing but beetles.
5897000	5899000	And I have a cross-dressing dog.
5899000	5900000	Awesome.
5900000	5901000	Named Butch.
5901000	5902000	That's awesome.
5902000	5904000	Yes, I want Dina back there.
5904000	5905000	Dina was my lady.
5905000	5907000	Actually, no, I want the gay unicorn.
5907000	5908000	Yes, I've heard there's a gay unicorn.
5908000	5910000	There's a gay unicorn named Julian, and I said,
5910000	5913000	Becky, don't, you know, that's not named after your son.
5913000	5915000	He's just a gay unicorn.
5915000	5918000	We know your little boy likes girls.
5918000	5920000	But if he didn't, we'd still love him anyway.
5920000	5924000	Which makes me want him in my village so I can be his hag.
5924000	5926000	I would totally be his hag, and I would put up
5926000	5928000	pride signs outside of his house.
5928000	5930000	We'd have a parade just for him.
5930000	5931000	You and Dina.
5931000	5933000	Julian and Dina.
5933000	5934000	You go.
5934000	5937000	Do you think there's fanfic out there that ships those two?
5937000	5938000	Rob.
5938000	5939000	As friends.
5939000	5940000	This is the internet.
5940000	5944000	There's fanfics that ship everybody and everything.
5944000	5946000	There are fanfics that would take two blades of grass
5946000	5948000	in a Star Trek movie and ship them.
5948000	5949000	And no, people actually-
5949000	5952000	I want to find some really dirty Animal Crossing fanfic
5952000	5954000	and have some red on the show.
5954000	5955000	Oh, no.
5955000	5957000	Tumblr has created its own phenomenon,
5957000	5959000	and that is shipping fandoms.
5959000	5963000	Creating avatars for fandoms and shipping them.
5963000	5965000	Welcome to the internet.
5965000	5967000	Everything is shippable.
5967000	5969000	Rob's looking it up too.
5969000	5971000	You're so disgusting, Rob.
5971000	5974000	Alright, maybe I'll have something for you guys
5974000	5975000	after rapid-fire news.
5975000	5976000	And Shakers.
5976000	5978000	I was going to be playing Ragnarok Online 2,
5978000	5981000	but I gave it up for Final Fantasy XIV.
5982000	5987000	I did get a little bit of time on Drunken Robot Pornography,
5987000	5988000	which is a great game.
5988000	5989000	I'd recommend everyone get it.
5989000	5991000	And I have to thank Gamer Girl,
5991000	5994000	because she got me JetSight Radio.
5994000	5996000	And I love that game,
5996000	6001000	but I have to do some rewiring with my various USB cables
6001000	6003000	so that my hub will work again
6003000	6010000	and I can plug in my Xbox controller to use on-
6010000	6014000	Shakers just shipped his pants.
6014000	6017000	I ship my pants with my shirt.
6017000	6019000	But the shirt has to be on top.
6019000	6022000	Alright, we've got to move on with the show.
6022000	6025000	Thank you for the classic gaming take-back, though,
6025000	6027000	and you'll bring us more of it next week.
6027000	6030000	Meanwhile, rapid-fire news about new games.
6030000	6032000	Loki, starting us off.
6032000	6035000	So Grand Theft Auto 5 is going to require an install
6035000	6037000	on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360,
6037000	6040000	which is not surprising, on Xbox 360,
6040000	6042000	because it's such a large game.
6042000	6043000	It is on two disks.
6043000	6046000	The first disk will allow you to install the game,
6046000	6049000	and then the second disk is going to be the one
6049000	6050000	that you actually play with.
6050000	6053000	So it creates an install partition for the game,
6053000	6056000	and then you just play it from there on,
6056000	6059000	which makes sense because the world's so fucking huge.
6059000	6063000	The PS3, of course, is one disk because it's Blu-ray.
6063000	6065000	You can store more shit on there.
6065000	6067000	So you're going to need eight gigabytes of free space
6067000	6072000	in order to install the first disk section
6072000	6075000	or the section of the game on PlayStation 3.
6075000	6076000	I'm excited.
6076000	6080000	Still can't wait to play it, and I'm not surprised.
6080000	6085000	And now, of course, the way they've gotten around things
6085000	6091000	in Australia being unrated or not being barred
6091000	6093000	because they can't get it rated,
6093000	6096000	even though they have an R18 Plus rating, makes no sense,
6096000	6100000	there is a low violence version that's being made
6100000	6102000	for Australia for Saints Row IV,
6102000	6105000	and that's been spotted on Steam.
6105000	6109000	So I guess that's how they're going to get around it.
6109000	6111000	And remember, it's not the end of the world.
6111000	6112000	There's always mods.
6112000	6114000	You better believe that somebody in Australia
6114000	6115000	is going to find a way around that shit
6115000	6118000	to patch the game back to the way it should be.
6118000	6121000	So just, you know, not a big deal.
6121000	6124000	And speaking about patching, Fez is getting patched
6124000	6126000	on Xbox Live Arcade.
6126000	6128000	Phil Fish said basically that, you know,
6128000	6131000	now that the updates don't cost anything,
6131000	6133000	he's going to spend a few months, I guess,
6133000	6137000	to put an update together to fix the problems that were,
6137000	6141000	I guess, affecting about 1% of the players before.
6141000	6146000	So fix the problems that were in the first patch
6146000	6147000	that they had to recall.
6147000	6150000	So that's good news, I guess.
6150000	6153000	And of course, as a reminder, Fez 2 is not in development
6153000	6157000	for the Xbox One or Xbox 360 because he's still pissed.
6159000	6161000	Sorry, I'm laughing over here because I'm finding
6161000	6163000	some Animal Crossing fanfic to read.
6163000	6167000	And this one isn't dirty, but it's about a relationship
6167000	6169000	between Monique and Rosie.
6169000	6172000	And my favorite is that they actually incorporated
6172000	6176000	how Monique always says, pfft, into the story.
6177000	6180000	And they're fighting over a letter.
6180000	6182000	And Monique shrugged her shoulders
6182000	6184000	then shook her head once more.
6184000	6186000	Then you won't mind if I read this then.
6191000	6193000	I know what I'm doing after the show.
6193000	6197000	All right, moving on to some other rapid-fire news.
6197000	6202000	Xbox One's Kinect will be able to read QR codes.
6202000	6204000	This will be handy because that way you don't have to input
6204000	6206000	those long download codes.
6206000	6209000	This was confirmed by Xbox Chief Product Officer
6209000	6211000	Mark Whitman on Twitter.
6211000	6213000	So yeah, that's kind of neat that you won't have to input
6213000	6215000	those long download codes.
6215000	6217000	Hopefully you don't have to scratch off all that crap,
6217000	6219000	though, because if some of that gets left behind,
6219000	6221000	then it's going to screw up the QR codes.
6221000	6223000	So they'll find a way around that, I guess.
6223000	6225000	A little bit of Final Fantasy news.
6225000	6228000	Lightning Returns, of course, is coming out early next year
6228000	6232000	and invoking a little bit of the Final Fantasy VII wank.
6232000	6233000	I know.
6233000	6235000	Cloud-based pre-order bonuses,
6235000	6237000	and I'm not talking about in the cloud.
6237000	6238000	There's already wank going on.
6238000	6240000	You can actually dress her up as Cloud,
6240000	6241000	which is kind of neat.
6241000	6243000	There's the wank going on about the outfit being
6243000	6245000	over-sexualized. No, it's not.
6245000	6247000	It looks exactly like on Cloud. She just has boobs.
6247000	6249000	And you can pre-order this.
6249000	6252000	It's a pre-order bonus. That's what this is for.
6252000	6254000	This is currently listed at Amazon.
6254000	6257000	Don't know if it's exclusive to Amazon or what yet,
6257000	6259000	but we'll find out a little closer to February 11th
6259000	6261000	when the game is set to come out.
6261000	6264000	By the way, I should state, it wasn't in this particular story,
6264000	6266000	but there was also news coming out of Final Fantasy XIV
6266000	6269000	that there's going to be, for the lady characters,
6269000	6271000	you will be able to dress your character similar to Lightning,
6271000	6274000	and guy characters can dress their character similar to Snow,
6274000	6276000	which I think is kind of interesting.
6276000	6277000	And a lot of people are like,
6277000	6279000	But are they going to be a hero?
6279000	6281000	Get your 13 out of my 14.
6281000	6283000	Are they going to be a hero?
6283000	6285000	Everybody on the internet sounds like Monique.
6285000	6287000	Get your 13 out of my 14.
6288000	6291000	But there's a lot of Final Fantasy throwbacks.
6291000	6293000	Like, the quest I was stuck on,
6293000	6295000	I had to kill a Magitek armor, okay?
6295000	6297000	Get your six out of my 14.
6297000	6299000	No, actually, you can stay.
6299000	6302000	Anyhow, also, speaking of Final Fantasy VII,
6302000	6304000	Final Fantasy VII, I'm sure a lot of you heard,
6304000	6306000	now available on Steam for $11.99.
6306000	6309000	Now, this game's been out, you know, forever,
6309000	6311000	but now it works on Windows 7.
6311000	6314000	Actually, they released the version that works on Windows 7 last year,
6314000	6316000	but it's through Steam,
6316000	6319000	and because it's with Steam, it has cloud saves,
6319000	6322000	and Steam achievements.
6322000	6324000	I'm tempted. I'm sorely tempted.
6324000	6325000	Character booster.
6325000	6327000	Well, you need to create a new save file,
6327000	6329000	where you know who dies.
6329000	6331000	I know!
6331000	6333000	It's like you can't carry your PlayStation 1 file over,
6333000	6335000	so you need something to kill her again.
6335000	6337000	I can't carry over my last PC save either, huh?
6337000	6339000	I know. I don't know if that'll work.
6339000	6345000	If Dark Sakura's able to get Julian and Dina to get married,
6345000	6350000	or, excuse me, to celebrate their pride in Animal Crossing,
6350000	6354000	maybe she can convince Microsoft to loan a Halo Warthog
6354000	6356000	decorated in rainbow colors,
6356000	6360000	because this was featured in the Seattle Pride Parade on Sunday, June 30th.
6360000	6362000	The Halo vehicle, of course,
6362000	6365000	Microsoft's up there in the Seattle area.
6365000	6369000	A decorated Warthog in rainbow colors,
6369000	6373000	escorted by a Spartan soldier and supporters of LGBT equality
6373000	6377000	were there at the Pride Parade in Seattle.
6377000	6379000	Pretty cool.
6379000	6381000	I like to see game companies get involved in that.
6381000	6383000	I know EA usually does the one here in San Francisco,
6383000	6385000	so very, very cool.
6385000	6387000	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
6387000	6389000	I have some stuff.
6389000	6394000	Well, Natural Selection 2 is going to add female marines,
6394000	6396000	and the thing that really makes me happy about this
6396000	6399000	is that they're actually in a legit uniform.
6399000	6405000	I mean, they're not made to have boob-shaped armor or anything like that.
6405000	6410000	Basically, they had to take the time to do research, concept art,
6410000	6412000	doing the textures and models, animation,
6412000	6415000	and then making sure that the game would sell
6415000	6418000	before they could actually incorporate the female marine.
6418000	6420000	So they have that coming out,
6420000	6424000	and let me see if I've got a date on it.
6424000	6427000	It just says in late summer.
6427000	6440000	In other news, Battlefield 3 Free is going to be free on PlayStation Plus this week.
6440000	6442000	Go get it.
6442000	6445000	Other free games include Jet Set Radio, Metal Slug XX,
6445000	6449000	Docoro, and Oddworld Munches Odyssey HD.
6449000	6451000	Sadly, I actually checked to see.
6451000	6454000	I don't know if they stagger when they upload those different games,
6454000	6456000	but I only saw Battlefield 3.
6456000	6459000	I wanted Jet Set Radio.
6459000	6461000	Jet Set Radio.
6461000	6463000	I'll have to check it again.
6463000	6465000	But I did manage to grab Battlefield 3.
6465000	6468000	I recommend anybody that has PlayStation Plus
6468000	6470000	that listens to the show to go grab it as well
6470000	6473000	because I think it would be fun for a game night or something like that
6473000	6476000	because I have no idea what I'm doing with Battlefield 3.
6476000	6479000	Plus, it makes it even more fun that you can fly jets.
6479000	6483000	You want to kick everyone's ass, right?
6483000	6487000	I just want to fly a jet and the people and do all sorts of crazy shit.
6487000	6489000	I think that would be fun.
6489000	6491000	Is that your goal in life? To fly a jet and do a person?
6491000	6493000	No.
6493000	6495000	So, other news.
6495000	6498000	There is a Mega Man board game.
6498000	6503000	Well, there is going to be, let's see,
6503000	6506000	it looks like they're trying to tie it in with 25th Anniversary,
6506000	6510000	but it will let you be Mega Man on the board field
6510000	6514000	and beat Dr. Wily the usual way, except with rolling dice, I guess.
6514000	6518000	There's also going to be other memorabilia coming out
6518000	6521000	including a Mega Man statue and 3DS case covers.
6521000	6524000	But no game, so whatever.
6524000	6526000	Well, a board game.
6526000	6529000	A board game?
6529000	6531000	Hey, don't diss board games.
6531000	6533000	I like board games.
6533000	6535000	Me too.
6535000	6537000	I played a really fun one and I can't remember the name of it,
6537000	6539000	although it was more of a card game.
6539000	6542000	It was fun. Everybody got dealt an identity.
6542000	6545000	It was kind of like Mafia or Wolf Game or one of those types of things
6545000	6547000	where everybody got dealt an identity.
6547000	6549000	Somebody in chat is going to know this.
6549000	6551000	Degenerate Johnny or somebody who knows their card games are going to know this.
6551000	6553000	You get dealt these cards and three people would be the spies
6553000	6555000	and everybody else is the good guys.
6555000	6558000	And you go on missions, but if the spies go on missions,
6558000	6560000	they can flunk the missions.
6560000	6562000	And if too many missions get flunked, then the spies win.
6562000	6564000	If missions pass, then the good guys win.
6564000	6567000	And then you also have these cards that can reveal people's identities.
6567000	6569000	Well, it gets in this really good...
6569000	6571000	You start arguing with all your friends about who's a spy and who's not a spy.
6571000	6573000	You know, a la Mafia.
6573000	6575000	I think it was called The Resistance.
6575000	6577000	I want to say that was the name of it.
6577000	6579000	Might have been the name of it.
6579000	6581000	That made me just think of that old werewolf game
6581000	6583000	that people used to play on DDR4.
6583000	6586000	Oh yeah, that's a thing that happens at conventions and stuff.
6586000	6589000	That's all based off of LARP, basically.
6589000	6591000	Which, you know, OL LARP.
6591000	6594000	Big, big, positive reception to the OL LARP idea.
6594000	6596000	Just saying.
6597000	6601000	You know what? I do kind of want to do OL LARP.
6601000	6603000	I definitely want to do OL LARP.
6603000	6605000	But I have to play myself.
6605000	6608000	Maybe in our nod to DDR Freak, we could start with the wolf game.
6608000	6610000	That would be cool.
6610000	6614000	You know, it's going to sound a little bit sad,
6614000	6616000	but I do miss my LARP days.
6616000	6619000	Where I would wear this...
6619000	6621000	And keep in mind, it was vampire LARP.
6621000	6623000	So it was even more sad.
6623000	6625000	Black Wolf in Chat says,
6625000	6628000	Used to play. Werewolf is all I do at Dragon Con.
6628000	6630000	I can't fucking wait for Dragon Con
6630000	6632000	and actually play some authentic LARPing.
6632000	6633000	I'm so excited.
6633000	6635000	In Mobile, where I'm from,
6635000	6637000	the big convention there is Mobicon.
6637000	6639000	And it's gotten a lot bigger, too.
6639000	6641000	It was Gold Dragon's thing,
6641000	6643000	and Gold Dragon's since gone out of business,
6643000	6645000	but Mobicon has stayed a fixture.
6645000	6648000	And it was my first actual LARP experience,
6648000	6650000	was playing a vampire there.
6650000	6653000	And now I think that they're doing a couple of other ones.
6653000	6656000	And actually, when I went to...
6660000	6662000	What's the convention?
6662000	6664000	Coast Con, I think it was, in Biloxi.
6664000	6667000	They did a live action anime game.
6667000	6669000	They just decided to make one up.
6669000	6672000	And keep in mind, this is like in 1996.
6672000	6675000	So if anyone wants to keep in mind what was out then.
6677000	6679000	I did Dragon Ball Z stuff.
6681000	6682000	I think this is it.
6682000	6684000	Fifth Dream linked me to something that's on Geek and Sundry,
6684000	6686000	where it has a bunch of the nerd celebs,
6686000	6688000	like Wil Wheaton and Felicia Day,
6688000	6690000	are all playing The Resistance.
6690000	6692000	And it's like this big reality show set up here.
6692000	6694000	So I think this is the game. Yeah, yeah.
6694000	6695000	This is fun.
6695000	6696000	This is a lot of fun.
6696000	6698000	This would be a good game for OLARP,
6698000	6700000	even though it's not really LARPing.
6700000	6702000	I think people would enjoy watching us yell at each other
6702000	6703000	and playing this game.
6703000	6704000	It was a lot of fun.
6704000	6705000	Yes.
6705000	6706000	Oh yeah, this is definitely it,
6706000	6708000	now that I can see the board here.
6708000	6709000	Very cool.
6709000	6710000	Alright, anyway.
6711000	6712000	Sorry for the sidetrack,
6712000	6714000	but since we're talking about board games.
6722000	6723000	Let's go to the FUBU Question of the Week.
6723000	6725000	Take Facebook and Google+, slam them together,
6725000	6726000	and you get FUBU.
6726000	6728000	And this week, it's about board games.
6728000	6730000	Since we didn't just talk about this story anyhow,
6730000	6732000	about Mega Man being a board game,
6732000	6734000	we decided to ask our listeners,
6734000	6736000	what video game do you think would make a fun board game?
6736000	6739000	Or, if you rather, what board game that isn't already one
6739000	6740000	would make a fun video game?
6740000	6743000	That one's hard, because I find a lot of people
6743000	6746000	don't know what video games have been turned into board games.
6746000	6751000	So, you know, if you named one that happens to already be out there,
6751000	6753000	oh well, you know, they need to promote it better.
6753000	6756000	But like, you know, I know Civilization is a board game,
6756000	6758000	there's gonna be the Mass Effect Risk game.
6758000	6760000	I won, I won, I won, I won, I won.
6760000	6763000	And there's certainly a lot of board games that are video games.
6763000	6765000	But maybe some of our listeners picked up on stuff
6765000	6766000	that fell through the cracks.
6766000	6768000	And that's what we're trying to find out
6768000	6770000	in our FUGL Question of the Week this week.
6770000	6771000	We'll start on Google+.
6771000	6773000	JB Mon says,
6773000	6776000	I definitely think that a board game can be made out of Metal Gear Solid
6776000	6779000	as some sort of tactical game, maybe Mass Effect as well.
6779000	6781000	Also, although this is a card game,
6781000	6783000	I definitely think Cards Against Humanity
6783000	6785000	would make a fun Xbox Live arcade game.
6785000	6787000	They do have Apples to Apples,
6787000	6789000	which does have the Helen Keller card,
6789000	6791000	which kind of led to Cards Against Humanity, just saying.
6792000	6797000	Robert Gauss on Google+, says,
6797000	6800000	XCOM would be a good one, being turn-based already.
6800000	6802000	Animal Crossing also,
6802000	6806000	but it would be a resource gathering trading game like Catan.
6806000	6808000	Dr. Noir says,
6808000	6812000	I've already, I've actually enjoyed the Dragon Age table chop RPGs
6812000	6815000	and am very much amazed no one has put out a clean pen and paper RPG
6815000	6818000	based on any Final Fantasy franchise.
6818000	6822000	Also, the D&D crossover, computer to tabletop and vice versa games
6822000	6824000	are really enjoyable.
6824000	6826000	Thank you to the folks over on Google+.
6826000	6829000	Let's check out Facebook and some of the answers we have here on Facebook.
6829000	6831000	Ooh, we have a lot.
6831000	6834000	Jeremy Jay from Koopa Club says,
6834000	6836000	Metroid!
6836000	6838000	Also, I think The Legend of Zelda would lend itself well to the format.
6838000	6840000	I've never played the Milton Bradley game,
6840000	6842000	but I don't think they've done one since then.
6842000	6844000	Clerical Error 404 says,
6844000	6846000	Castlevania could potentially make an entertaining board game,
6846000	6850000	especially the entries that are primarily about exploration and backtracking.
6850000	6852000	It's kind of interesting, Metroid and Castlevania,
6852000	6854000	and I think of Metroidvania games.
6854000	6856000	If I may make a suggestion, by the way,
6856000	6858000	keep in mind that for some of these things,
6858000	6861000	there are games out overseas.
6861000	6864000	In fact, there's even RPGs in Japan
6864000	6867000	that have spawned anime and various video games.
6867000	6869000	For example, Lodoss War.
6869000	6871000	It started off as a tabletop game.
6871000	6873000	Clerical Error also follows up,
6873000	6875000	saying, I would really like to see a video game version
6875000	6877000	or a completely new take on Arkham Asylum.
6877000	6879000	Now, Stan H. followed up later,
6879000	6881000	saying there already is one, a board game.
6881000	6883000	But, you know, it's kind of hard to keep track
6883000	6885000	of a lot of the board games that are out there.
6885000	6888000	So, you know, I didn't know until Stan said that either
6888000	6890000	that there was an Arkham Asylum board game.
6890000	6892000	But thanks to the boys from Koopa Club
6892000	6894000	for jumping in there first on that question. I appreciate it.
6894000	6897000	Moving on, Katsuhiko J. says,
6897000	6900000	Katamari Damacy would make a fun board game.
6900000	6902000	Roll up all the pieces and weigh the ball to win.
6902000	6905000	Although keeping all the pieces would be a nightmare.
6905000	6907000	That's actually kind of like silly awesome.
6907000	6909000	Think about what you could do with Velcro.
6909000	6911000	Like rolling over other Velcro things.
6911000	6914000	You remember the actual Katamari that they had at E3?
6914000	6917000	Yeah, yeah. Well, I'm just thinking of just a big ball made of Velcro
6917000	6919000	and you could roll over Velcro chips
6919000	6921000	that would keep, like, you could add to the Velcro.
6921000	6923000	But then taking that thing apart would be a bitch.
6923000	6924000	Yeah. But it would be fun.
6924000	6928000	You did see the thing about the people that made the full-size ball
6928000	6931000	as a controller for Katamari Damacy.
6931000	6934000	So that, like, little kids could push it around and play the game.
6934000	6936000	Rob, I've got an easy solution for you.
6936000	6937000	Alright.
6937000	6939000	And it makes cleanup even easier.
6939000	6941000	Remote-controlled electromagnet.
6941000	6942000	Magnets? Yes.
6942000	6943000	Because then there you go.
6943000	6945000	Magnets? How do they work?
6945000	6948000	When you're done, you just click the button to turn the magnet off
6948000	6950000	and, boop, everything comes free.
6950000	6952000	I'm sure that'll be cheap.
6952000	6954000	And get your credit cards far away from that.
6954000	6957000	It's like wire wrapped around metal. Come on.
6957000	6959000	Actually, it would not be at all expensive.
6959000	6962000	And keep in mind that if you have all your pieces as metal,
6962000	6964000	magnetic current will carry through metal.
6964000	6966000	Alright. Let's see.
6966000	6968000	Clover Nikon says,
6968000	6970000	Well, Bioshock Infinite is a board game already,
6970000	6972000	so it'd have to be Grand Theft Auto.
6972000	6974000	That's a good idea for a board game.
6974000	6977000	You got hot coffee. Lose a turn.
6977000	6979000	Stan H says,
6979000	6983000	The Last of Us would make a good board game similar to Last Night on Earth,
6983000	6985000	a board game where one player takes control of the infected
6985000	6988000	and all other players control one of the survivors
6988000	6991000	while looking around for weapons and tools.
6991000	6993000	I always mispronounce this name. I apologize.
6993000	6995000	Ciao says,
6995000	6997000	A Mario board game might be interesting.
6997000	6999000	Gamer Girl says,
6999000	7001000	Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep.
7001000	7004000	I think they should totally make a board game based on the DLC content of that game
7004000	7006000	at Borderlands 2, of course.
7006000	7009000	It's so fun and just reminds me of the old pen and paper board games.
7009000	7010000	Degenerajani says,
7010000	7013000	My first choice would be Mass Effect, but we all know that Mass Effect Risk,
7013000	7015000	ahem, Galaxy at War, will be released this fall.
7015000	7018000	Therefore, I would go with a board game version of Deus Ex.
7018000	7021000	With that being said, I cannot think of any better company
7021000	7024000	to create the Deus Ex board game than Fantasy Flight.
7024000	7026000	Fantasy Flight has specialized in making board games
7026000	7029000	based on video game titles such as Gears of War, Age of Conan,
7029000	7032000	and pay attention, Robin Bobby, Civilization.
7032000	7035000	Yes, I'm aware of the Civilization board game, believe it or not.
7035000	7038000	Expensive as hell and about 11 billion pieces
7038000	7041000	and nobody to play it with me.
7041000	7043000	Andy R says,
7043000	7046000	How about a real-life triple triad? That would be cool.
7046000	7049000	Hey, I'm all for the Final Fantasy card games becoming like real card games.
7049000	7051000	As far as board games to video games,
7051000	7054000	I'd love to see more board games get a video game adaptation,
7054000	7057000	as in just the board game but able to play over the internet.
7057000	7059000	All my college friends live in different cities now
7059000	7062000	and I'd love to be able to play with them over the internet with voice chat or such.
7062000	7065000	I'd really be interested to see what a video game company
7065000	7067000	can make out of Galaxy truckers, though.
7067000	7070000	I'm sure to be hard as balls.
7070000	7074000	Ragenator says, I want to say that Half-Life 3 would make a good board game,
7074000	7077000	assuming that the board game ever gets released.
7077000	7080000	Of course, Duke Nukem Forever, the board game will take forever to be released
7080000	7082000	due to development hell.
7082000	7084000	Oh, you.
7084000	7088000	Steve Chiller says, Super Mario RPG.
7088000	7091000	William Murderface says, Disgaea might make an interesting game.
7091000	7094000	It could be sort of like Munchkin,
7094000	7096000	but the combat would work a bit differently
7096000	7098000	and the leveling system would be more detailed.
7098000	7101000	Also, C-Man might make an interesting game.
7101000	7105000	Maybe make it like Cards Against Humanity.
7105000	7107000	I'll friend your butt.
7107000	7111000	It's a reference to an old YouTube joke on the show.
7111000	7114000	Tyler M says, There needs to be a Munchkin, Xbox Live,
7114000	7117000	or PlayStation Network adaptation.
7117000	7121000	Shane, our good friend Shane Olinko from Horde House says,
7121000	7125000	Clearly, the correct answer is anticipation.
7125000	7128000	It needs to have the limp ice cream cone and floppy horn.
7128000	7130000	Good answer. Good answer.
7130000	7132000	A real answer would be Pokemon.
7132000	7134000	I don't think it would work so much
7134000	7137000	as I'd really just want to see if they packaged in 649 pieces
7137000	7140000	for every Pokemon in the series, excluding form changes.
7140000	7142000	It's a card game already.
7142000	7145000	Chiggers, last but not least, says, Final Fantasy Tactics,
7145000	7147000	a combo board and card game.
7147000	7150000	For the record, you know there is a Mario monopoly, right?
7150000	7152000	That's right.
7152000	7154000	There's a Pokemon one, too. There's an everything monopoly.
7154000	7156000	Mario monopoly is just a monopoly.
7156000	7159000	For the record, Rob, I've decided to do something,
7159000	7161000	and I've given myself this idea.
7161000	7164000	You know how you can make custom cards for Cards Against Humanity?
7164000	7166000	I'm going to do the OLR theme.
7166000	7168000	With the print template and everything.
7168000	7169000	That'll be fun.
7169000	7170000	I should do that.
7170000	7171000	That'll be a lot of fun.
7171000	7173000	$50! No, I'm kidding.
7173000	7175000	Alright, that does it for the FOOGLE Question of the Week.

7183000	7186000	And there you go. You can answer next week.
7186000	7188000	Meanwhile, more news. Loki.
7188000	7190000	Yes, let's get into news.
7190000	7193000	So, the Xbox One.
7193000	7196000	They've got this reputation system that's going to be on the new system,
7196000	7199000	and it's not entirely a new concept.
7199000	7201000	Basically, what they're going to be doing is
7201000	7204000	they're going to be matching people with low reputation
7204000	7208000	with other people of similar reputation.
7208000	7211000	They have a similar system that was in Max Payne 3
7211000	7213000	where it's kind of if people get caught cheating,
7213000	7215000	they get put in a cheater's pool
7215000	7217000	where all they encounter are people that hack the game
7217000	7219000	and, you know, are cheaters.
7219000	7221000	So, similar sense to that.
7221000	7224000	Although, I don't know if it's going to work exactly the same
7224000	7227000	on the reputation system because
7227000	7231000	your rating goes back up if you get...
7231000	7233000	if no one really reports you.
7233000	7236000	Like, if they don't report you much.
7236000	7239000	So, what's going to happen is you're going to have this yo-yo process
7239000	7241000	where you get a low rep,
7241000	7243000	and then you get put in the low rep pool,
7243000	7246000	and then all the people with low rep aren't probably going to report each other,
7246000	7248000	so your rep's going to go back up,
7248000	7251000	and then you go back in their pool, and so on and so forth.
7251000	7255000	But, hey, I guess it's better than nothing.
7257000	7259000	Here's my thing, though, is that
7259000	7262000	I thought this already was supposed to be there to some extent
7262000	7264000	in the current Xbox.
7264000	7266000	I thought you were supposed to get massive assholes.
7266000	7268000	They do have a reputation system in Xbox,
7268000	7271000	so you can block people and stuff that you don't want to play with
7271000	7273000	that are cheaters and stuff.
7273000	7275000	But then again, I also have
7275000	7279000	an 80% rating for unsportsmanlike conduct,
7279000	7282000	but that's just because I kick the crap out of them.
7282000	7285000	It's not because I talk trash, because I don't have a headset.
7285000	7288000	It's just because I kick the crap out of them.
7288000	7291000	Mercifully.
7291000	7293000	Mercilessly, I guess.
7294000	7296000	They...
7296000	7299000	So you get false reports all the time.
7299000	7302000	I mean, my star rating's still high,
7302000	7303000	but it's just...
7303000	7304000	Yeah, you gotta be careful.
7304000	7306000	You get, especially if you're playing a lot,
7306000	7308000	you get a lot of false ratings.
7308000	7310000	Somebody who uses this system a lot
7310000	7312000	should have their vote weighed less
7312000	7314000	than somebody who uses it sparingly,
7314000	7316000	because you know they mean it when they use it sparingly, you know?
7316000	7319000	But somebody who kind of overuses it?
7319000	7320000	I guess.
7320000	7322000	There's gotta be, there's a fine system to it.
7322000	7324000	I don't know what the answer is.
7324000	7325000	I don't know.
7325000	7327000	It would be, or like if they're like,
7327000	7330000	you know, rating you for like,
7330000	7332000	I don't know, language or something like that.
7332000	7334000	You don't have a headset connected or something.
7334000	7336000	You know, maybe flag something going,
7336000	7340000	hey, wait a second, how did they say anything to you
7340000	7343000	without any sort of communication tool?
7343000	7344000	I don't know.
7344000	7345000	Whatever.
7345000	7349000	I mean, I guess it's not a big deal
7349000	7351000	unless, you know, a bunch of people gang up on something,
7351000	7353000	but it's the same flaw in any system, I guess.
7353000	7357000	Well, remember the Wii Vitality Sensor?
7357000	7360000	This was something that was shown at E3 a few years ago,
7360000	7363000	and you know, Nintendo kind of made a big hoop to do about it.
7363000	7364000	And it kind of disappeared.
7364000	7367000	And that was a really poor showing.
7367000	7369000	That whole year in general for Nintendo was not good news.
7369000	7371000	And this thing kind of disappeared.
7371000	7373000	Well, news coming out this week
7373000	7375000	about why the Wii Vitality Sensor disappeared.
7375000	7377000	And this was in a conversation
7377000	7379000	that Satoru Iwata had with investors.
7379000	7381000	Basically what it comes down to is that
7381000	7383000	after doing a large test of the prototype,
7383000	7386000	the peripheral apparently only worked on certain people.
7386000	7390000	The success rate was 9 out of 10 people could use it.
7390000	7392000	So, quote, we've pushed forward its development
7392000	7395000	on the academic assumption that by observing the wave patterns
7395000	7397000	of the human pulse, we could quantify
7397000	7400000	how tense or relaxed a person is.
7400000	7402000	Or to be more specific, how much the sympathetic
7402000	7404000	and parasympathetic nerves work as functions
7404000	7406000	of the autonomic nerve.
7406000	7408000	The Wii Vitality Sensor is an interesting device,
7408000	7410000	and we did various experiments to see what is possible
7410000	7412000	when it's combined with a video game.
7412000	7414000	But as a result, we have not been able to launch it
7414000	7416000	as a commercial product because we could not get it to work
7416000	7419000	as we expected, and it was of narrower application
7419000	7421000	than we originally thought.
7421000	7423000	We would like to launch it into the market
7423000	7426000	if technology advancements enable 999 out of 1,000 people
7426000	7428000	to use it without any problems,
7428000	7431000	not only 90 out of 100 people.
7431000	7433000	So it makes me wonder, though, that if,
7433000	7435000	you know, this doesn't work as well.
7435000	7437000	I wonder if, you know, the new Kinect
7437000	7439000	is actually gonna work as well as they said.
7439000	7441000	That's what I was thinking, because I thought the Kinect
7441000	7443000	was supposed to have something like this in there.
7443000	7445000	Um, you know, I don't know, because...
7445000	7447000	Well, it's not like a monitor, but it's supposed to kind of see that.
7447000	7450000	It's supposed to, like, see the pulse of your skin, I guess, but...
7450000	7452000	Mmm. Come on.
7452000	7454000	And really, we know why this isn't working.
7454000	7456000	Merka, your fingers are too fucking fat.
7456000	7459000	Can't get your stump in there.
7459000	7465000	Uh, I'm not exactly sure what exciting games
7465000	7467000	could have come of it anyway, except I could...
7467000	7469000	Zero. Zero games would have been exciting with that.
7469000	7471000	I could give myself an EKG at home.
7471000	7474000	That's what it sounds like the Wii Vitality Sensor would be good for.
7474000	7476000	What's next, the Wii Blood Pressure Monitor?
7476000	7479000	Like, just, I don't know, it was...
7479000	7481000	Wasn't feeling it, and I don't think many of us were.
7481000	7484000	This is kind of one of those, you know, sometimes...
7484000	7486000	You know what would get my vitality up?
7486000	7487000	Huh?
7487000	7490000	If they re-released the Rez Trance?
7490000	7491000	No.
7491000	7493000	You know what would get my vitality up?
7493000	7494000	Sex.
7494000	7495000	Pinkberry.
7495000	7498000	Oh yeah, and Pinkberry.
7498000	7500000	Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us next?
7500000	7502000	I was actually trying to ask IkumaJP,
7502000	7505000	what is the nasty tea you happen to have?
7505000	7508000	But let's go to other news, speaking of nasty things.
7508000	7509000	Violent games.
7509000	7512000	Well, there's a study that came out that says
7512000	7516000	they do not adversely affect pro-social behavior,
7516000	7522000	meaning that they don't take regular, everyday social people
7522000	7524000	and suddenly make them anti-social.
7524000	7529000	This was a research that was conducted by
7529000	7531000	University of Queensland, Australia,
7531000	7536000	that concluded that playing violent video games
7536000	7538000	really doesn't have an adverse effect on people,
7538000	7542000	and I guess...
7542000	7545000	I wouldn't say neurotypical mental states,
7545000	7547000	but you know, basically, they're not gonna make
7547000	7549000	an extroverted person suddenly introverted,
7549000	7551000	and they're not gonna make an introverted person
7551000	7553000	suddenly want to go on a murderous rampage.
7553000	7557000	But they may make some lazy people not want to bathe
7557000	7559000	if they're playing for a long time.
7559000	7561000	How do you know this?
7561000	7562000	I'm just saying.
7562000	7566000	Anyway, the way that it goes is that each participant
7566000	7568000	played one of four video games for 20 minutes,
7568000	7573000	and at the end of the test, they had to drop some pens
7573000	7575000	to see how many would pick them up.
7575000	7578000	So no matter how many games they got these people to play,
7578000	7581000	about 40 to 60% of them helped pick the pens back up
7581000	7583000	at the end of the study.
7583000	7586000	And then they found that participants were more likely
7586000	7589000	to help when pens were dropped halfway through the experiment.
7589000	7593000	So they basically said that it doesn't really affect
7593000	7595000	your willingness to help other people.
7595000	7599000	It doesn't affect your ability to interact with other people.
7599000	7602000	Pretty much, I think, it's like we've been saying all along,
7602000	7607000	that has to already be there to have the adverse effect.
7607000	7612000	And this was, you can find out from going to PLOS One.
7612000	7620000	I think that you can find the study if you search for it online.
7620000	7624000	And I found this information out actually through Game Politics,
7624000	7626000	so there's links following through that website as well.
7629000	7631000	All right.
7631000	7633000	Let's see here.
7633000	7638000	Let's talk a little bit about advertisements.
7638000	7644000	And one of the big criticisms that Microsoft gets with the Xbox 360 is,
7644000	7647000	hey, you know what? I pay for Xbox Live Gold.
7647000	7650000	Why the fuck do I have advertisements on my console?
7650000	7654000	Why do I see this when I'm paying for my online already?
7654000	7657000	Well, it's not going to get any better.
7657000	7664000	In fact, they are working on integrating Kinect functionality with ads.
7664000	7666000	Hooray!
7666000	7667000	That's right.
7667000	7671000	And one of the examples that they have in this wonderful picture here is for Ben Gay.
7671000	7672000	That's right.
7672000	7677000	You can use the Ben Gay campaign, or they had a campaign, I guess, that ran on 360.
7677000	7686000	And they're saying that new ads, I guess, will support the Kinect somehow.
7686000	7689000	Voice recognition, I guess, maybe.
7689000	7693000	I'm wondering if they're going to have some sort of,
7693000	7699000	because I know some of these videos I've seen before will have a way,
7699000	7701000	instead of just hitting a button to skip it,
7701000	7703000	it's like, type this word to skip this.
7703000	7708000	Or they may say this phrase to skip this thing.
7708000	7711000	And then sometimes it's like the commercial slogan.
7711000	7714000	I saw that on a cap show the other day where it was like you had to type the little slogan
7714000	7718000	of the company that was advertising, that was the cap show, was to type the slogan.
7718000	7720000	That's so stupid.
7720000	7722000	It's less irritating.
7722000	7723000	It's clever as hell, actually.
7723000	7730000	It's basically just to say that you saw the ad and that you saw it instead of just ignoring it.
7730000	7734000	So, I don't know, I'm not too excited about that,
7734000	7740000	but obviously they're going to try to support the peripherals that are on there for that stuff.
7740000	7744000	And I think they did some of that stuff with the Xbox 360.
7744000	7748000	Hell, they've crafted whole games based on advertisement.
7748000	7749000	Yars.
7749000	7752000	And Doritos, I guess they have the Doritos stuff.
7752000	7754000	Yeah, the dash of destruction or whatever.
7754000	7756000	But yeah, but one of those is good.
7756000	7757000	Princess Irene's favorite game.
7757000	7760000	One of those is good, one of them's not, so yeah.
7760000	7764000	Alright, well, speaking of things that are good and not so good,
7764000	7766000	depending on what side of the fence you're on,
7766000	7768000	the controversial SimCity.
7769000	7771000	I did want to add this quote at the very end there.
7771000	7774000	It says, while advertising was more of an afterthought on the 360,
7774000	7777000	the Xbox One is going to have advertising in mind.
7778000	7779000	Advertising in mind.
7779000	7782000	Not consumers in mind, advertising in mind.
7782000	7784000	So the Xbox One is anti-consumer.
7784000	7785000	Yes.
7785000	7787000	Which is why Bobby Blackwolf pre-ordered one.
7787000	7789000	So a lot of the limitations that we have now,
7789000	7792000	hopefully the release of the boundaries will be widened
7792000	7794000	so the opportunities will be elaborated, whatever the fuck that means.
7794000	7796000	I don't know, but yeah.
7796000	7797000	Alright, anyhow.
7797000	7800000	SimCity, which one might argue is also anti-consumer,
7800000	7802000	at least a lot of people really felt that way.
7802000	7806000	SimCity, you know, they said this game was not designed
7806000	7808000	to be played as a single-player experience,
7808000	7809000	not designed to be offline.
7809000	7812000	This is a, it's a, what did they talk about,
7812000	7815000	the new experience, it's part of the experience,
7815000	7816000	it's what people want with SimCity.
7816000	7819000	Well, now take this with a grain of salt
7819000	7822000	because it comes from a Reddit post of a customer survey
7822000	7824000	that was being sent to SimCity players,
7824000	7828000	but EA is thinking about an offline mode for the game.
7828000	7832000	The survey lists several features, including a classic mode,
7832000	7834000	which would allow you to, quote,
7834000	7837000	in offline or online mode play a single,
7837000	7840000	fully functioning city using cheats and unlocks
7840000	7842000	that allow you to create your perfect city.
7842000	7847000	So in other words, the game that most of us believe is actually SimCity.
7847000	7851000	The poll also talks about expansions, DLC,
7851000	7853000	something that would add super scrapers into the game,
7853000	7857000	clean energy cities, green economies, and so forth.
7857000	7860000	You can get screen caps of the survey on Imgur,
7860000	7862000	which were posted via Reddit.
7862000	7866000	Again, I'm just saying this kind of stuff that doesn't,
7866000	7869000	isn't really sourced except through screen caps, you know,
7869000	7871000	you have to take with a grain of salt.
7871000	7874000	But I think some of us certainly saw this coming
7874000	7878000	where SimCity might kind of back end an offline mode into it,
7878000	7879000	but charge for it.
7880000	7885000	I mean, let's just, it could be fake, it could be real,
7885000	7888000	but we know for a fact that you can play it offline
7888000	7892000	because people have hacked it to be able to play it offline.
7892000	7896000	So a lot of the computations that they're offloading onto a server
7896000	7897000	is just ridiculous.
7897000	7899000	I mean, your computer can handle that stuff.
7899000	7903000	It's just, they still want an excuse to tie it to you.
7903000	7907000	So just keep that in mind when you have these next gen games,
7907000	7909000	and I'm not saying it's just an Xbox One thing,
7909000	7911000	it's going to be PlayStation 4 as well,
7911000	7915000	that require cloud computing for this shit to work
7915000	7918000	because it probably could handle it on the system,
7918000	7919000	but for whatever reason,
7919000	7923000	they wanted that extra layer of connectivity or DRM.
7923000	7925000	What happens when the servers go down?
7925000	7927000	Because they will go down.
7927000	7930000	Oh, you get delisted from Steam like Darkspore.
7932000	7936000	SSG100Matt in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,
7937000	7940000	Did they ask any questions about SimCity Action News?
7940000	7941000	No, but I wish they would.
7941000	7943000	That feature would be like Instabuy.
7943000	7944000	If they could get that back in SimCity,
7944000	7947000	the full motion video clips from the classic CD-ROM game,
7947000	7949000	I'd be there in a heartbeat.
7949000	7952000	SSG100Matt asked the hard-hitting questions here at OLR.
7952000	7954000	I appreciate that.
7954000	7957000	All right, let's go to the mailbag.
7957000	7960000	Every week you ask some hard-hitting questions in our mailbag.
7960000	7962000	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
7962000	7964000	Darkspore will dive in the mailbag head first
7964000	7967000	and read an email or two that she deems worthy.
7967000	7968000	Only got two.
7968000	7970000	Or you only get two emails the entire week
7970000	7972000	and so it makes your job easy.
7972000	7973000	Yes, it does.
7973000	7974000	I'll read the first one.
7974000	7975000	Greetings, OLR.
7975000	7977000	It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
7977000	7979000	Loki, I'm thinking about getting a 3DS soon,
7979000	7981000	but the only thing holding me back
7981000	7984000	is the lack of an R4 card that hasn't been patched out.
7984000	7987000	The biggest thing I used my DS Lite for
7987000	7988000	was homebrew and multimedia.
7988000	7989000	So what do you think,
7989000	7991000	someone will create a perma-hack for the 3DS
7991000	7993000	and allow me to play my homebrew games?
7993000	7994000	I don't know.
7994000	7997000	It's a little harder now that they can patch the system.
7997000	7998000	You know, with the DS,
7998000	8003000	they couldn't really patch it too easily at all, I think.
8003000	8006000	So yeah, it's gonna be a lot harder.
8006000	8008000	It's always gonna get harder with each generation.
8008000	8009000	You said harder.
8009000	8010000	No, I don't think they're gonna have
8010000	8012000	any sort of permanent solution.
8012000	8016000	Keep the DS you've got for that stuff, if you can.
8016000	8019000	All right, next part and a comment for Rob.
8019000	8020000	Yay.
8020000	8021000	It finally happened.
8021000	8023000	Super Metroid for SNES has been bumped
8023000	8025000	to my second favorite game of all time.
8025000	8026000	What?
8026000	8027000	Stop reading this email.
8027000	8028000	I don't want to hear the rest.
8028000	8029000	It's not official yet,
8029000	8032000	but I think that Far Cry 3 might have replaced it.
8032000	8034000	I thought about breaking down
8034000	8036000	and paying full price on Steam 50 bucks for the game
8036000	8038000	when I remembered Loki saying that
8038000	8040000	Amazon usually has better sales on certain games.
8040000	8041000	He was right.
8041000	8044000	$20 for a hard copy and I am in business.
8044000	8045000	Usually in sandbox games,
8045000	8048000	I get a little bored with all the side missions,
8048000	8050000	but the island is so beautiful and immersive
8050000	8052000	and I've been doing everything there is to do.
8052000	8054000	I haven't even tried the multiplayer yet.
8054000	8057000	So if you have a good graphics card, $20,
8057000	8058000	I highly recommend it.
8058000	8060000	And please ask chat to comment
8060000	8061000	if they like the multiplayer or not.
8061000	8064000	Thanks, your loyal turtle in Philly, Serious Turtles.
8064000	8066000	You don't even need a really good graphics card
8066000	8067000	for that game for some reason.
8067000	8070000	Like I have Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon
8070000	8073000	and it runs fine on my laptop.
8073000	8075000	So much wrong with this email.
8075000	8077000	First you say Super Metroid gets bumped to number two.
8077000	8079000	Then you use the phrase Loki was right.
8079000	8081000	There's so much wrong with this email.
8081000	8083000	I don't even know where to begin.
8083000	8085000	Hey, I agree Super Metroid is a better game
8085000	8086000	than Far Cry 3.
8086000	8088000	Alright, you're a smart man, Loki.
8088000	8089000	That's why we keep you around.
8089000	8090000	But no, in all seriousness,
8090000	8092000	I haven't played Far Cry 3.
8092000	8093000	I can't hate on it.
8093000	8094000	Loki sure seems to enjoy it.
8094000	8096000	I got bored of it pretty fast, actually.
8096000	8097000	Oh, I thought you really liked it.
8097000	8098000	Blood Dragon was cool,
8098000	8100000	but Blood Dragon was even kind of...
8100000	8101000	It's just...
8101000	8102000	It's very...
8102000	8104000	You know, they have an open world,
8104000	8105000	but it's kind of like,
8105000	8106000	okay, takeover outpost.
8106000	8108000	Okay, hunt some animals.
8108000	8112000	Okay, you know, kill this dude.
8112000	8113000	I don't know.
8113000	8115000	It just got really boring for me,
8115000	8116000	and I never finished it,
8116000	8117000	so I probably should.
8117000	8119000	Although they have a really cool multiplayer mode.
8119000	8121000	Like, see, Far Cry was kind of cool
8121000	8122000	on the consoles and PCs.
8122000	8124000	You can make your own maps.
8124000	8126000	But in 3, they got rid of the multiplayer
8126000	8127000	where you can make your own maps.
8127000	8129000	They have just like this single player,
8129000	8131000	like sandbox thing that you can make some shit.
8131000	8134000	So, I don't know.
8134000	8136000	Well, and here's the other thing,
8136000	8137000	is that, you know,
8137000	8138000	it's looking very likely
8138000	8140000	we might have a Steam sale next week.
8140000	8142000	You know, it's about that time of year.
8142000	8144000	It should have started already,
8144000	8145000	but it might be next Thursday.
8145000	8146000	It doesn't show up by next Thursday.
8146000	8147000	I thought they announced the date.
8147000	8148000	I think it's next weekend.
8148000	8149000	Yeah.
8149000	8150000	So, there'll be that.
8150000	8151000	And, you know, I know you said
8151000	8152000	the good deals come from Amazon,
8152000	8153000	but at this point,
8153000	8156000	Far Cry 3 on a Steam summer sale,
8156000	8158000	if they put trading cards in it,
8158000	8159000	it's over.
8159000	8162000	They have like some really good bundles.
8162000	8163000	You know, it's just like they had one.
8163000	8165000	It was for 40 bucks.
8165000	8166000	You get Bioshock Infinite,
8166000	8168000	Bioshock 2, and Bioshock 1.
8168000	8169000	I already have one and two
8169000	8171000	from previous Amazon sales,
8171000	8172000	so I didn't get that,
8172000	8174000	but, you know, that was a pretty good deal.
8174000	8175000	And they've got some other games,
8175000	8176000	but the problem is like,
8176000	8177000	like I'm pretty limited now
8177000	8179000	with what I'm buying on PC,
8179000	8181000	because I have a ton of shit
8181000	8182000	that I just don't play.
8182000	8185000	So, you know, unless it's like,
8185000	8186000	I don't even really know
8186000	8188000	what else I really need.
8188000	8190000	I mean, there's a lot of stuff I have.
8190000	8192000	It's just, I don't know,
8192000	8194000	Saints Row 4?
8194000	8195000	I mean, you know,
8195000	8196000	I'll get that eventually,
8196000	8198000	but I don't really know what else I need.
8198000	8199000	Like I have all of,
8199000	8200000	I mean, Far Cry,
8200000	8201000	or not Far Cry yet.
8201000	8202000	I mean, I have Far Cry 3.
8202000	8204000	I don't have Far Cry 3 on PC yet,
8204000	8208000	but like Fallout, maybe Fallout.
8208000	8210000	I don't have the Fallout games yet,
8210000	8212000	but I don't know if I'd have time to play that.
8212000	8213000	I mean, I'm assuming it's gonna be
8213000	8215000	hundreds of hours just like Skyrim and shit,
8215000	8217000	so I don't have time for that.
8217000	8219000	Ain't nobody got time for that.
8219000	8222000	All right, next email.
8222000	8223000	Hey everyone.
8223000	8224000	I just wanted to make this quick,
8224000	8225000	short, and sweet.
8225000	8227000	Last week's episode of OLR reminded me
8227000	8229000	of how much we are more of a family
8229000	8231000	than anything else.
8231000	8232000	You three were there for that listener
8232000	8234000	as he was dealing with the loss of his wife.
8234000	8236000	You three were also there for me
8236000	8238000	when I had to deal with my passing of my mother
8238000	8239000	along with everyone else
8239000	8241000	that has been a long time listener.
8241000	8243000	I'm inclined to say that Orange Lounge Radio
8243000	8245000	is that chill big brother slash sister
8245000	8248000	that we can come to for advice on dealing with anything
8248000	8249000	and will not pass judgment on us,
8249000	8251000	except me because I judge everybody.
8251000	8252000	Kidding.
8253000	8254000	And speaking of passing judgment,
8254000	8256000	two weeks ago with that unprofessional email
8256000	8257000	that came in, as you recall,
8257000	8259000	the entire chat room banded together
8259000	8260000	and we were ready to lynch someone for it
8260000	8261000	because we are family.
8261000	8263000	We look out for each other.
8263000	8265000	Tell you what, though, I am ever grateful for Rob
8265000	8267000	who helped me set up for my show
8267000	8270000	right after my ex dumping me 15 minutes prior.
8270000	8271000	And that's why I keep listening, supporting,
8271000	8273000	and telling others to check out OLR.
8273000	8275000	Much love, Ron Chan.
8275000	8278000	I had no idea about that until after the fact, though.
8278000	8281000	But I still would have helped you all the same.
8281000	8282000	Thank you.
8282000	8286000	And big hearts to Ron Chan because my Ron Chan.
8286000	8287000	And there's P.S.
8287000	8290000	Hey, Rob, what's the new OLR hashtag, wink?
8290000	8295000	OLR love fest is the new hashtag, OLR love fest.
8295000	8298000	Not gonna lie to you guys,
8298000	8300000	that was a very difficult call at the end of last week's show.
8300000	8303000	Probably one of the toughest, if not the toughest,
8303000	8307000	I've taken in the, what, 11, 12 years we've been here.
8307000	8309000	But he needed a friend
8309000	8314000	and I was so happy to see that there's like 70 of them
8314000	8317000	in the chat room and countless more on the podcast feed.
8317000	8319000	So, yeah, that really is what it's all about.
8319000	8322000	And you guys, you know, it's not just us for you guys.
8322000	8324000	We've shared some pretty personal stories
8324000	8326000	over the past few years of this show as well.
8326000	8329000	We've had, you know, not every day of Sunshine and Roses
8329000	8331000	at Studio OLR.
8331000	8333000	But we get through it.
8333000	8334000	Here we are.
8334000	8335000	Yep.
8335000	8336000	All these years later.
8336000	8338000	Still going.
8338000	8342000	And just think, I get to pay 400,000 real bells for a house.
8342000	8343000	No, I'm kidding.
8343000	8345000	No, not that much actually.
8345000	8348000	PPS, two tacos for Uchan.
8348000	8349000	Heart.
8349000	8350000	I want a taco.
8350000	8352000	I want tacos too.
8352000	8354000	Did I tell you, I told you Rob,
8354000	8357000	the real estate lady who took us around to all these houses
8357000	8360000	and got us this good deal on this house, bought us pizza.
8360000	8363000	Cause she wanted to sell you that house.
8363000	8364000	She was a nice lady.
8364000	8365000	She was legit nice.
8365000	8367000	She knew the way to get your attention.
8367000	8369000	And she brought us drinks.
8369000	8371000	P-I-Z-Z-A.
8371000	8374000	But champagne would have definitely sold more houses.
8374000	8375000	I'm just saying.
8375000	8376000	All right.
8376000	8378000	I'm going to have a mimosa party if we get this house by the way.
8378000	8380000	Bottomless mimosas?
8380000	8381000	Heck yeah.
8381000	8382000	I'm there.
8382000	8383000	Bring us champagne.
8383000	8384000	All right.
8384000	8388000	After the hashtag OLR love fest is a very appropriate time
8388000	8391000	to bring us back down to earth with some FUs of the week.
8391000	8411000	F-U to this damn cough that will not go the fuck away.
8411000	8412000	Fuck you.
8412000	8413000	Fuck you.
8413000	8414000	Fuck you.
8414000	8415000	Fuck you.
8415000	8416000	Fuck you.
8416000	8417000	Fuck you.
8417000	8418000	Fuck you.
8418000	8419000	Fuck you.
8419000	8420000	Fuck you.
8421000	8422000	I like that.
8422000	8423000	And my toes are hurting.
8423000	8424000	And um, yeah.
8424000	8426000	And girl problems.
8426000	8428000	Loki.
8428000	8442000	Fuck you, the long weekend is gone.
8442000	8443000	Amen to that.
8443000	8444000	Fuck you to the heat.
8444000	8446000	Fuck you to Grandpa for living in San Francisco where the weather
8446000	8448000	was beautiful the whole time we stayed.
8448000	8451000	We went over there for a concert on Wednesday.
8451000	8453000	And um, Frank music.
8453000	8454000	He puts on a great show by the way.
8454000	8455000	He's a very talented young man.
8455000	8459000	Um, we stayed over at his place and the weather was just great.
8459000	8461000	Back here it's hotter than balls.
8461000	8462000	So F you to the heat.
8462000	8463000	Other locals say?
8463000	8464000	Hmm.
8464000	8466000	Thank God the heat wave is over.
8466000	8468000	Because what hasn't it been nice the last couple of nights?
8468000	8469000	Yeah, it's much better.
8469000	8472000	Yeah, this week's OLR much more tolerable than last week.
8472000	8473000	I don't think Slidekick will ever come back.
8473000	8475000	It was so hot here.
8475000	8477000	Now you just brought the heat with him?
8477000	8478000	That's right.
8478000	8479000	Girl, you need to leave that heat at home.
8479000	8481000	Because he's just a hot mess.
8481000	8483000	I hope he's listening.
8483000	8484000	Gameboy.org.
8484000	8485000	Yes, artichokes are good on pizza.
8485000	8486000	Shut up.
8486000	8488000	Artichoke hearts.
8488000	8492000	Alright, let us move on with a couple more news stories for you guys.
8492000	8495000	And then Twitter topics and the Skype line.
8495000	8497000	But first, Loki.
8497000	8502000	Alright, so Sony during their press conference actually,
8502000	8509000	and during E3, they were showing off this kind of augmented reality tech demo
8509000	8514000	to show off the PlayStation 4 and the new iCamera.
8514000	8519000	Well, what's kind of cool, this tech demo called Playroom
8519000	8525000	is actually going to be included with the PlayStation 4 system.
8526000	8532000	And the only weird thing though is that the iCamera is not included with the system.
8532000	8535000	So I don't really know how you're going to deal with augmented reality stuff.
8535000	8537000	I guess it's an excuse to buy the camera.
8537000	8544000	I personally, if it were me, I would just throw that tech demo in with the camera
8544000	8549000	and not necessarily the system so that, you know, you have something with the camera
8549000	8551000	that you play games with.
8551000	8553000	I don't know.
8553000	8559000	Maybe some of the demos in there don't necessarily use the camera.
8559000	8561000	I don't know.
8561000	8564000	It looks neat though. It kind of makes me want to get a camera too.
8564000	8567000	That's enough to sell you on the whole?
8567000	8570000	That looks neat. I mean, I don't know.
8572000	8575000	I don't know. I need to see more games that really make good use of it.
8575000	8577000	Although, the move is kind of underrated.
8577000	8580000	As far as the motion stuff goes, the move works very well.
8581000	8583000	Have you used the move?
8583000	8585000	Yeah, I have.
8585000	8587000	All the way back at E3 once even.
8587000	8590000	Toy Story was one of the first games I played.
8590000	8592000	I think the first game I played on the move.
8592000	8594000	And somebody else I knew had one.
8597000	8599000	One more news story for you guys.
8599000	8602000	It's about Nintendo on the losing end of a lawsuit.
8602000	8607000	They actually filed a domain dispute with the World Intellectual Property Organization
8607000	8610000	over the WiiU.com domain name.
8610000	8615000	Now Nintendo does own Wii-U.com and Wii-U.net.
8615000	8621000	But an unknown, or at least they're unnamed, registrant snapped up WiiU.com in 2004.
8621000	8624000	Long before even the first Wii.
8624000	8628000	Nintendo filed a cyber squatting camp complaint.
8628000	8631000	The WIPO denied that complaint.
8631000	8637000	Nintendo will have to contact WiiU.com's owner directly to negotiate a purchase.
8637000	8645000	Microsoft, by the way, in a similar domain dispute with Xbox One.com and Xbox One.net's domains.
8645000	8648000	So, it gets harder to get these domains.
8648000	8651000	The people just snap up and they sit on them.
8651000	8653000	So, Nintendo tried with the cyber squatting.
8653000	8657000	I'd like to hear more about why it was denied.
8657000	8659000	I mean, what's on that site?
8659000	8660000	What was denied?
8660000	8665000	Well, WiiU stood for, was like, we invest in you, is what it was.
8665000	8669000	And it was, it's from a long time ago that the guy registered the site.
8669000	8672000	Yeah, but now it's just a bunch of, it's ads.
8672000	8673000	I'm looking at the site now.
8673000	8676000	This is totally, this is like a squat ad thing.
8676000	8678000	I don't get, like, why is this here?
8678000	8682000	Well, they tried, I understand that, but it's still his site.
8682000	8688000	And the thing was, they were trying to take it, saying basically that he's just squatting on the name and stuff like that.
8688000	8694000	But it's legitimately, he registered it a long time ago, it wasn't to try to make a quick buck and stuff.
8694000	8702000	But, so now they can't necessarily get it just by saying, oh well, it should be turned over to us because it's infringing on our copyrights or anything like that.
8702000	8707000	Now they have to basically go the second route, which is offer big sum of cash to buy it.
8707000	8710000	Yeah, but this, I get what you're saying, but this shit's shady.
8710000	8713000	He's not using it now for that purpose.
8713000	8717000	So give it up, because this is profiting off of Nintendo's.
8717000	8720000	Nintendo has built the name recognition.
8720000	8723000	This guy, with this page here, this is profiting off it.
8723000	8730000	If I went to WiiU.com and saw, you know, Wii financial investment, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, and this guy's thing, you know, things not tied to video games,
8730000	8734000	I'd be like, okay, you know, sucks for Nintendo, but this guy, this guy had it first, you know?
8734000	8737000	And it's just like, it's just like, you know, OLR.
8737000	8739000	We probably don't own OLR.com.
8739000	8741000	I don't know, who does own OLR.com?
8741000	8742000	What is there if I go there?
8742000	8747000	Remember when we had the sacramentals back in the day as our DDR group?
8747000	8755000	Okay, OLR.com belongs to this online residential and it's something to do with New York and getting places in New York.
8755000	8757000	It's hard for me to complain about this.
8757000	8765000	Somebody's not sitting on this profiting off of, you know, here's every annoying rant Rob's ever made with ads attached to it or something.
8765000	8771000	Like they're not profiting off of something we did, you know, it just happens to be that OLR is a pretty common acronym that means a few different things.
8771000	8776000	So this online residential has it. So can't really complain about that, you know?
8776000	8783000	My point was with the sacramental thing is that when I tried to register it, it belonged to some Catholic group in Sacramento.
8783000	8784000	Oh, that's right. That's right.
8784000	8785000	Yeah.
8785000	8786000	Remember that.
8786000	8788000	All right.
8788000	8793000	Also word of warning, Animal Crossing will not let you say fart face or ass face or arse face.
8793000	8794000	Really?
8794000	8795000	As anybody's catchphrase.
8795000	8796000	Oh.
8796000	8801000	But you can't get biatch, mared, and zoot.
8801000	8802000	How about bish?
8802000	8803000	I haven't tried it.
8803000	8809000	I did get, I got one of my, Brie or one of my characters to say LOL butts.
8809000	8810000	I have to try that one.
8810000	8811000	Yeah. LOL butts.
8811000	8812000	Pretty good.
8812000	8815000	Surely you saw on Tumblr the person that named their town My Butt.
8815000	8816000	Yeah.
8816000	8817000	Hilarious.
8817000	8822000	This will be the best renovation in my butt.
8822000	8825000	He lives in my butt.
8825000	8826000	All right.
8826000	8827000	We're five.
8827000	8828000	Okay.
8828000	8829000	Let's get to the Skype line.
8829000	8830000	Let's open it up.
8830000	8834000	One eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8834000	8838000	If you'd like to give us a call and talk about whatever we've talked about tonight or maybe something different.
8838000	8840000	We are open now for your calls.
8840000	8845000	We'll get to Twitter topics here in a minute if there's no calls coming in right away.
8845000	8849000	But first, Loki, I don't know if you have any last minute stories you want to share with listeners.
8849000	8852000	Just some stuff I saw online.
8852000	8856000	They've got a villager mod now for Skyrim.
8856000	8860000	So you can play as the villager from Animal Crossing.
8860000	8861000	Murder people and that.
8861000	8863000	That's kind of awesome actually.
8863000	8865000	In a creepy way.
8865000	8867000	So I'm going to point it out in chat.
8867000	8875000	There's going to be a 2D Mega Man game based off of Mega Man Legends 3.
8875000	8880000	I know they've had quite a few Mega Man Legends based games.
8880000	8889000	They're a part of that 100,000 for bringing back Mega Man thing.
8889000	8891000	I don't know.
8893000	8894000	What else?
8894000	8895000	I don't know.
8895000	8896000	It's pretty much it.
8896000	8898000	I mean, like I said, slow news week.
8898000	8900000	Very slow.
8900000	8904000	So not a whole lot to report out there.
8904000	8906000	It's too bad.
8906000	8907000	All right.
8907000	8909000	Again, it's 1877 Game O-L-R.
8909000	8914000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.
8914000	8915000	Meanwhile, I will move on.
8915000	8917000	Maybe Skype's having problems though.
8917000	8920000	Because I know when Bobby tried to call us earlier, we didn't even show up on Skype.
8920000	8923000	I assure you we are on Skype.
8923000	8925000	Just call the name.
8925000	8927000	If it's not working, I guess you could send us a message.
8927000	8932000	Although please don't make 20 bazillion messages show up on my screen at once.
8932000	8935000	That really annoys me when people send me messages when I'm trying to do a show.
8935000	8936000	No offense.
8936000	8938000	Let's see.
8938000	8942000	I was going to get to Twitter topics, but I got sidetracked with a personal tweet.
8942000	8944000	Where am I here?
8944000	8945000	Rab.
8945000	8947000	I can't help it if I love Twitter.
8947000	8948000	Oh, yes.
8948000	8949000	Oh, God.
8949000	8950000	Tigerclaw sent us one.
8950000	8952000	I know this is going to come up on Horde House this week.
8952000	8954000	Tigerclaw sent us this tweet.
8954000	8957000	Blizzard exploring microtransactions for World of Warcraft.
8957000	8960000	He links this to an article on GameSpot, but I can summarize this.
8960000	8972000	They datamined an item in the latest patch of Warcraft that increases your experience gain by 300% for a short amount of time.
8972000	8975000	And it says, from the Blizzard net cash shop.
8975000	8977000	But here's the thing.
8977000	8980000	It came out, I think just today or yesterday, it's for Asia.
8980000	8982000	Asia is the region that this is for.
8982000	8985000	It's not for America, at least not yet.
8986000	8992000	But I really hope Blizzard is either going to just say, fuck it, and go free to play, and they're not going to double dip.
8992000	8994000	Because that is going to piss me off.
8994000	8997000	Like, if they try to double dip, I'm done with WoW.
8997000	8999000	They got free to play would be interesting.
8999000	9008000	They are already walking a fine line, because you can't tell me they don't make some good money off of mounts, server transfers, faction changes, blah-di-blah-di-blah.
9008000	9014000	Like, they make a heck of a lot of good money off of that stuff, and they're already walking a fine line.
9014000	9021000	The minute they start putting stuff in that enhances gameplay and gives people an edge, as opposed to cosmetic stuff, I'm kind of over it.
9021000	9029000	And I know some WoW fans are looking forward to this, but I'm not willing to pay a sub-fee and money for advantage gaining things on top of that.
9029000	9030000	That's too much.
9030000	9032000	Choose one model and go for it.
9032000	9036000	You don't get to do both, especially when your game is aging.
9038000	9041000	By the way, I did get into the beta test of the new battle.net launcher.
9041000	9042000	That was pretty cool.
9042000	9051000	I will say, the new battle.net launcher that has all the games in there, and you can just, like, it actually, I'm going to spoil something that's going to come up on this week's Horde House, but oh well, don't tell.
9051000	9054000	So we talked about it a little bit on last week's show.
9054000	9060000	I guess after last week's show, Grandpa side-loaded Starcraft, because you can get the free version of Starcraft right there in the launcher.
9060000	9062000	He ended up buying it, and the expansion.
9062000	9066000	He enjoyed the little free version of it so much, he bought the whole thing.
9066000	9067000	Wow.
9067000	9073000	So I'm like, wow, battle.net launcher justified, just wait until they add the free-to-play Hearthstone into the mix.
9073000	9075000	It's going to just download right on your computer.
9075000	9078000	I'm still not probably going back to WoW, not for a while.
9078000	9081000	Well, there's a lot of people that aren't playing WoW right now, which is sad.
9081000	9086000	But we have pretty games, like Final Fantasy XIV, that actually have a balanced system.
9086000	9088000	And no grinding rep.
9088000	9092000	I'm enjoying some single-player action right now, so whatever.
9092000	9093000	No grinding rep.
9093000	9095000	Alright, let's see what else I have here.
9095000	9100000	Oh, ActDeaf tweeted us and says, after the Atari talk, I went and found my 2600.
9100000	9102000	Don't know if it works though.
9102000	9106000	Actually, that joystick you have, though, looks like my old Commodore 64 joystick.
9106000	9116000	Also, if I may say, because he messaged me on Twitter, I won't give any more information than this, but Micah is who I spoke with.
9116000	9121000	Spoke to at Atari Party, who had the Japanese 3DS, and very, very cool.
9121000	9124000	Very lucky kids, having a cool dad like that.
9125000	9131000	Spazzernator PSN tweets us, saying, we need VOG Magic 2013 or 2014 game night on Steam.
9131000	9135000	He's been trying to whore that game left and right. He must really love that game.
9135000	9137000	What is the next game night? Have you picked something yet, Loki?
9137000	9145000	Oh God, I keep, I keep, what is that, last, last, or this Friday, it was a little big playing card game.
9145000	9146000	There was nobody on.
9146000	9150000	And last week, I mean, honestly, I forgot, but I don't even know.
9150000	9156000	I don't know what we're going to do for next week, and I don't even know if we're going to continue doing it, because I'm just, I'm...
9156000	9158000	Participation's not at a level you need to be at.
9158000	9165000	Well, it's participation, and on top of that, well, it's because Bobby's PS3 broke, so we at least have two, you know.
9165000	9172000	But no, honestly, it was like, we got home late, and you know, by the time I got Josh in bed, it was like 9 o'clock, and so it's just...
9172000	9174000	Friday's a rough night, it's tough.
9174000	9179000	I wouldn't mind if you did VOG game night during Hoard House. If you wanted to do Wednesday, I wouldn't mind that, actually.
9179000	9181000	We could hop in as soon as we're done.
9181000	9185000	I do still stream Mass Effect 3 on Thursdays, I just didn't because it was the fourth.
9185000	9191000	I just, I don't know, it's hard to pick like a game that everybody has, and it's something we can consistently play, so...
9191000	9194000	I don't know, I'll have to think about it a little bit more.
9194000	9197000	It's too bad Minecraft wasn't free to play.
9197000	9200000	I was going to say, we need to do a Minecraft night, I'm kind of surprised.
9200000	9209000	I have the server access stuff, I just haven't gone around to updating the server and getting what mods we want in there.
9209000	9213000	But they have horses now, and you can put horse armor on them.
9213000	9215000	So, hey, horses.
9215000	9216000	I want guinea pig armor.
9216000	9228000	I will point out, we have a VOG community in the Steam group, and to be fair, we have an OLR community on Steam too, but I'm saying VOG because I'm trying to grow that one for all the shows.
9228000	9230000	Because I need people to trade cards with.
9230000	9236000	So if you want to trade some cards, you want to throw down and trade some cards, get in that VOG community and let's trade some cards.
9236000	9237000	For what games do you need cards?
9237000	9240000	I need two more for Super Meat Boy, but I have nothing to trade yet.
9240000	9245000	Well, I have Faerie Solitaire, like one Faerie Solitaire card I have dupes of that I'm willing to trade at this point.
9245000	9246000	Because I don't want to trade it if I don't have dupes.
9246000	9249000	Ask me again when I start getting booster packs.
9249000	9251000	Alright, I guess I'll just have to start playing.
9251000	9252000	There you go.
9252000	9253000	Where's the list for this stuff?
9253000	9254000	Attaboy, attaboy.
9254000	9258000	I guess I'll have to start playing because I haven't played Super Meat Boy yet, and I haven't, but I just haven't played it.
9258000	9261000	Who posted the link earlier in chat? Post that again.
9261000	9263000	There's actually a sort in the marketplace.
9263000	9270000	You sort advanced search, games, and then there's a one in the bottom right where it says like Steam achievements.
9270000	9271000	There's also trading cards.
9271000	9273000	It'll show you what games use it, but it's in the store.
9273000	9275000	It doesn't show you what games you own that use it.
9275000	9282000	But I think if you go to your profile and look at badges, I think any games that you have will show up there with the empty cards.
9282000	9283000	Like you have Super Meat Boy, right?
9283000	9284000	Yeah.
9284000	9286000	So you should see Super Meat Boy with the blank cards there.
9286000	9287000	So.
9287000	9288000	Alright.
9288000	9291000	Alright, I'll tell you some more stuff about that off air that I think you'll enjoy.
9291000	9292000	So.
9292000	9293000	Alright.
9293000	9295000	Nobody's calling in? That's really weird.
9295000	9297000	I wonder if Skype is screwing up something because...
9297000	9299000	It's probably Skype.
9299000	9302000	Yeah, because Bobby was having those problems earlier where he didn't even see us.
9302000	9309000	I'm gonna call the nice British lady on Skype just to make sure it's working.
9309000	9310000	Just testing.
9310000	9312000	Hello, welcome to Skype Core Testing Service.
9312000	9313000	Alright.
9313000	9314000	Yeah, we got it.
9314000	9315000	We got it.
9315000	9316000	We're good.
9316000	9317000	Hello.
9317000	9319000	It is the 4th of July weekend.
9319000	9323000	Our chat's got 61 people in it right now.
9323000	9325000	Are any of them trying to call?
9325000	9326000	Yeah, is anyone trying?
9326000	9327000	No, nobody's complaining.
9327000	9329000	Maybe there's just nothing to say tonight.
9329000	9330000	I don't know.
9330000	9332000	Where every gamer has a voice, but not tonight.
9332000	9333000	That's cool.
9333000	9334000	We can go home early.
9334000	9335000	That's fine.
9335000	9337000	I can start playing that Super Meat Boy later in those cards.
9337000	9338000	There you go.
9338000	9339000	Alright, fine.
9339000	9340000	Fine.
9340000	9346000	If you guys don't want to call in, we will go off and earn our trading cards.
9346000	9348000	I'll make the grudge noise until someone calls.
9348000	9349000	Oh, God no.
9349000	9350000	I'll end the show.
9350000	9351000	End the show.
9351000	9352000	Turn it off for Mike.
9352000	9355000	Oh, look, look, look.
9355000	9356000	It's finally lighting up.
9356000	9359000	Somebody's taking pity on this program.
9359000	9360000	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.
9360000	9361000	Who's this?
9361000	9362000	It is Brad from Bot Culture.
9362000	9363000	Hey, Brad.
9363000	9364000	How you doing?
9364000	9365000	Oh, peachy game.
9365000	9369000	Oh, and of course, now that you call, like the minute Dark Soccer started making noises.
9370000	9374000	As soon as Dark Soccer started making noises, my screen is full of calls.
9374000	9375000	Please stop.
9375000	9376000	Please stop.
9376000	9377000	What?
9377000	9378000	Somebody had to call.
9378000	9379000	Somebody had to call.
9379000	9381000	I love your kitty.
9381000	9382000	Well, good.
9382000	9383000	You know what?
9383000	9387000	We don't promote the fine show that is Pod Culture here on the show enough, and you do
9387000	9392000	so much for our program, and you've done a lot for Horde House that I'm always happy
9392000	9396000	to sit down and talk with you for a minute about what's going on in Pod Culture.
9396000	9399000	Well, outside of cat the game this week.
9399000	9400000	Yeah?
9400000	9405000	Been playing a lot of the 3DS this week.
9405000	9406000	Oh, yes.
9406000	9408000	You got sucked into the animal cracking, didn't you?
9408000	9409000	Yes, I did.
9409000	9410000	Dammit.
9410000	9411000	Congrats.
9411000	9415000	We've been playing that, and Lego City Undercover.
9415000	9416000	Oh, how's that?
9416000	9417000	It's a lot of fun.
9417000	9419000	It's Grand Theft Auto with Legos.
9419000	9421000	It's great.
9421000	9422000	That sounds kind of fun.
9422000	9425000	All the Lego games are pretty much the same.
9425000	9428000	I'm surprised Loki is not all over that game if it's Grand Theft Auto.
9428000	9429000	You could teach Josh on that.
9429000	9433000	It was going to be a game that was going to sell me the console, but I just looked at
9433000	9434000	him like, no.
9434000	9435000	No.
9435000	9438000	It's a lot of fun.
9438000	9442000	I don't know if it would be a system seller, but it's one picking it up.
9442000	9443000	That's a nice little addition then.
9443000	9445000	What else have you been playing in the gaming?
9445000	9447000	You doing any consoles these days?
9447000	9448000	No.
9448000	9449000	Nope.
9449000	9450000	That's all right.
9450000	9453000	I am fun employed at the moment.
9453000	9454000	That'll do it.
9454000	9456000	It's been your day when it comes to consoles.
9456000	9457000	Well, good luck on that front.
9457000	9460000	We're all hoping for you and Dark Sakura.
9460000	9463000	We're the gamelessly fun employed.
9463000	9465000	Well, I am going to let you guys go.
9465000	9468000	I just wanted to see if I could actually get in.
9468000	9472000	Hey, before you go, before you hang up and go, tell us a little bit about Pod Culture,
9472000	9477000	your show that's on Mondays at six o'clock on the network.
9477000	9480000	Just four geeks sitting around shooting the shit.
9480000	9481000	Good times.
9481000	9484000	You guys also do once a month lately, or at least for this year,
9484000	9486000	you're doing Doctor Who based specials, right?
9486000	9487000	Yeah.
9487000	9489000	It's kind of a sideshow for us.
9489000	9491000	Have another couple of friends that come in,
9491000	9495000	and we just talk Doctor Who on our Tartar's Interruptus episodes.
9495000	9500000	We thought for, hey, 2013, it's the 50th anniversary of Doctor Who.
9500000	9504000	We do a show for every doctor each month, and that's kind of what we've been doing.
9504000	9505000	All right.
9505000	9507000	Love it and love your show, and thanks so much for the support
9507000	9509000	and for calling in when nobody else would, Brad.
9509000	9510000	Appreciate it.
9510000	9511000	Later, guys.
9511000	9512000	Take care, buddy.
9512000	9515000	You could tell he just wanted to call in because he felt bad.
9515000	9517000	I appreciate that, Brad.
9517000	9520000	Black Wolf giving us a little last-minute leg-breaking story in the chat room.
9520000	9523000	Infinity Blade 2 free in the App Store right now.
9523000	9528000	If you want to go just tag that on your iPhone or iPad or whatever iDevice you're using.
9528000	9530000	I like free. It's the best price ever.
9530000	9532000	Oh, do I still have your mic off? I do.
9532000	9534000	God, Rob, you suck.
9534000	9535000	Fired.
9535000	9536000	That was funny.
9536000	9537000	That was not funny.
9537000	9538000	That was totally funny.
9538000	9539000	That was not funny.
9539000	9540000	All right.
9540000	9543000	Anyhow, let's go to the phones and try to take another call.
9543000	9544000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9544000	9545000	Who's this?
9545000	9547000	Hey, this is Agdef.
9547000	9548000	Hey, Agdef.
9548000	9549000	What's up?
9549000	9555000	Well, I don't know if you touched this story today or tonight.
9555000	9560000	Iwata telling people why he doesn't lay off people.
9560000	9564000	No, we didn't touch on that, but I read about that.
9564000	9566000	Please go ahead and share that with the listeners.
9567000	9573000	Basically, Iwata said to some reporters, I don't remember who exactly,
9573000	9581000	but they asked him because Nintendo is in the best financial position right now,
9581000	9584000	that why they don't lay off people.
9584000	9591000	So he basically says that laying off people would lower the morale of the rest
9592000	9598000	and would produce not quality games, basically.
9598000	9605000	And I admire that because even despite the financial problems
9605000	9611000	Nintendo has right now, not laying off people just because they want to produce quality stuff,
9611000	9613000	it's pretty good.
9613000	9618000	I don't know if it's fair to say Nintendo has, quote, financial problems either.
9618000	9621000	I know that's what a lot of people out on the internet are saying,
9621000	9623000	but Nintendo's got a shit ton of cash in the bank.
9623000	9625000	They made a lot of money on the Wii.
9625000	9627000	The 3DS is still crazy good for them.
9627000	9629000	Is the Wii U living up to expectations?
9629000	9630000	No.
9630000	9634000	But is it an epic loss of biblical proportions?
9634000	9635000	Not yet.
9635000	9637000	Let's see where they're at after this holiday.
9637000	9640000	But I love that Iwata gets that, you know, I could lay people off,
9640000	9643000	but that's only going to help the short-term numbers, not the long-term numbers.
9643000	9647000	If I lay people off, where are the people to make games?
9647000	9648000	Indeed.
9648000	9649000	I love it.
9649000	9665000	And especially because I think it was last year that he caught his salary by half of what he was making.
9665000	9666000	I remember that a lot.
9666000	9671000	And other people in Nintendo at the higher staff.
9671000	9675000	That was pretty cool of him and the rest of the Nintendo staff, too,
9675000	9683000	because despite what happens in Senga or other gaming companies,
9683000	9687000	it's cool that people at Nintendo, at least in Japan,
9687000	9691000	we know if the same happens here in America,
9691000	9698000	that they have at least a secure job there.
9698000	9706000	They don't have to worry about getting laid off just because they are not making any money, or just because.
9706000	9707000	Right.
9707000	9711000	Doomplague in chat says, I think Kazurai laid it off a ton of people last year.
9711000	9712000	Just saying.
9712000	9715000	Yeah, I remember some of the publicists, especially in Santa Monica.
9715000	9717000	There was some pretty big layoffs at Sony.
9717000	9719000	And of course, Microsoft.
9719000	9722000	We talked about Game Room earlier in the show and so forth.
9722000	9725000	Layoffs are inevitable as part of the ebb and flow of the industry,
9725000	9731000	but it's nice to know that Nintendo is not the first option on the top of their list.
9731000	9734000	And unfortunately for some executives, that's usually the first thing considered.
9734000	9737000	Yeah, it's really the executives that should be taking the pay cut,
9737000	9741000	because they're the ones that are making the decisions that are leading to the bad.
9741000	9743000	But again, Nintendo did.
9743000	9748000	So hate on Nintendo all you want, but it's pretty hard to get mad at this.
9748000	9751000	I just wish other people would follow that example.
9751000	9754000	Alright, well, Act Deft, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?
9754000	9758000	No, that's all. Basically, good guy eat water.
9758000	9759000	What's that?
9759000	9761000	Good guy eat water.
9761000	9764000	Oh yeah, good on you. A thumbs up for you, Iwata.
9764000	9766000	Alright, and a thumbs up for you too, Act Deft.
9766000	9768000	I appreciate the phone call. You take care, buddy.
9768000	9769000	You too. Thanks.
9769000	9772000	Bye. And have fun with that Atari 2600.
9772000	9773000	Hope it works.
9773000	9774000	I will. I try.
9774000	9776000	Hope it works. Bye.
9777000	9781000	I don't know how easy it is to find Atari 2600 games in Mexico, Act Deft,
9781000	9786000	but if you go to flea markets here in the US, oh, they're all over the place.
9786000	9789000	I probably have spares I could send you.
9789000	9792000	You can't find a copy of Combat somewhere?
9792000	9794000	You saying you can't find a copy of Combat?
9794000	9797000	Alright, sadly we are going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.
9797000	9799000	I'm sorry to those that didn't get through, but you know what?
9799000	9802000	You should have called when you had the chance.
9802000	9803000	Appreciate it though.
9803000	9804000	You can always send us an email.
9804000	9806000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
9806000	9809000	if you'd like to send us an email for consideration for next week.
9809000	9812000	But in the meantime, I think we're going to go ahead and wrap up the show.
9812000	9816000	Dark Sakura, sorry you couldn't be here for the whole show tonight,
9816000	9817000	but I'm glad you had fun at Atari Party.
9817000	9818000	I really rushed it.
9818000	9823000	We finally actually ended up cutting out six houses so that we could go look at this one
9823000	9827000	because I'd had my eye on it the whole time, and it turns out to be the one.
9827000	9830000	Nice. Have a mountain of fun at California Extreme.
9830000	9831000	I wish you could come.
9831000	9833000	Get us some more listeners for the show.
9833000	9834000	I've been spreading the news.
9834000	9835000	Appreciate it.
9835000	9838000	And do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
9838000	9841000	I hate my lungs and I want this house.
9841000	9843000	Good luck.
9843000	9845000	Loki, your final thought tonight?
9845000	9849000	I don't know.
9849000	9854000	I learned a lot about the Runswick A2 Pin Setter this week.
9854000	9859000	And my final thought tonight is trading cards.
9859000	9862000	Give me all your trading cards.
9862000	9865000	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
9865000	9867000	Thank you guys so much for checking out the show.
9867000	9869000	You know what we say. We do the show for free.
9869000	9870000	We're not asking for your money.
9870000	9874000	If you enjoy the show, all we ask, help spread the word about the show.
9874000	9876000	Help spread the word about independent podcasting.
9876000	9881000	Support folks like us who do this for nothing but the pure love of community
9881000	9886000	and spreading the word out there and having mature discussions about gaming.
9887000	9889000	Support the Voice of Geeks Network.
9889000	9891000	All our friends at vognetwork.com.
9891000	9895000	But even beyond that, all the great independent hardworking podcasters out there.
9895000	9897000	And there's an awful lot of them that are, especially in the gaming world,
9897000	9901000	that are getting to 8, 9, 10 years old that are all doing amazing things out there.
9901000	9904000	And yeah, support. Don't cut people down.
9904000	9906000	Support. If you don't like our show, that's fine.
9906000	9908000	You got this far.
9908000	9910000	So we appreciate you trying.
9910000	9913000	Go support a different independent broadcaster who works hard like we do
9913000	9915000	because there might be another show that's a little more up your alley.
9915000	9918000	That's the great thing about diversity all over the internet.
9918000	9922000	You can buy my momentary silence, though, with a copy of Magical Chase.
9922000	9925000	Just saying for the TurboGrafx. Just saying.
9925000	9927000	How much does that run?
9927000	9928000	A few hundred.
9928000	9930000	Yeah. That's what I thought.
9930000	9934000	All right. We'll be back to do it all again next week on Orange Lawn Radio.
9934000	9936000	Dark Soccer will have a report from California Extreme.
9936000	9939000	If I find a way to sneak over there, I'll have to do it.
9939000	9941000	And hopefully Dan will join us for that one.
9941000	9943000	Yeah. He was going to be here tonight.
9943000	9946000	It was, but he actually got called in to do inventory at work.
9946000	9948000	And we've been crunching his numbers, actually.
9948000	9952000	I would have been here slightly a bit earlier if it wasn't that I was checking on what the taxes are on that house.
9952000	9953000	Gotcha.
9953000	9956000	Well, I look forward to hopefully having him here next week
