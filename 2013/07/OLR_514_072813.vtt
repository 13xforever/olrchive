Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, July 28th, 2013, self-publishing will soon be a reality on the Xbox.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
A report is in on Gluya Game Tales, which might surprise you.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
And we get more insight as to why one fan-anticipated game was canceled.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this July the 28th of 2013, episode number 514 of our show.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
We're here to talk to you guys about the latest and greatest in video gaming.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
It is the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Hi.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
How are you doing?

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Well, I don't know. My voice decided to die just before the show.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
That's not good.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
So I'm going to have some more of your delicious coffee.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Mine's hurting a little bit today too, which we'll talk about in a minute.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
So did you do it with the wrench in the Billard's room?

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
I'll talk all about that in a moment.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
But say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Hello.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
How you doing Techmaster Loki?

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
I'm getting full though. I still have another burger.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Another burger to down.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Oh yeah, that's right. You've ditched your fries in favor of two burgers.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Well, not today. I actually wanted to get fries today just because I was a little hungry.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
You're being a little bit of a piggy today.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
But they're good fries. Usually they're not good fries.

01:36.000 --> 01:44.000
It's kind of the Russian roulette of drive-thru fast food, I guess. McDonald's fries.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
Alright, and of course we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
And when you do listen to our show live, you can check in and show that you're participating with the show.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
I did just turn those on. Sorry, I'm lagging a little bit tonight.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
You guys might have to carry the show a little bit tonight. I am pooped.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
I had a super long weekend this weekend.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
We don't want to know about your poop.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
I may not have gone poop all weekend. I've been that busy.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Are you that uptight?

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Sounds like a personal problem, Rob.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
Well, here's the thing. As Jamie referenced a minute ago, last night was the big clue show.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
And I'm sure those of you that do listen to Understation Live here at the Voice of Geeks Network,

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
you've probably heard Jessica talking about it, and I've referenced it too.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
That was the big show last night, which not only was the show, but all day leading up to that show.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
And then all week leading up to the show and the Saturdays before that.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
But the show went really well, and there was a really large turnout.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
A little larger than I honestly would have expected, just because a clue doesn't have...

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
I mean, a lot of people love that movie, but it doesn't have that same Rocky Horror Picture Show thing going on,

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
or even Repo, the genetic opera, and some of the other cult movies.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
It doesn't really have that base built around it, but I think last night kind of showed there's more of a desire for that.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
So that was very exciting.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
So there was that, and then this morning, my buddies Captain Spike and First Mate Slidekick,

03:14.000 --> 03:21.000
and Tim from Crystal D were all here, and they graciously let me guest on Game Buoy podcast.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
We used the studio here to do that.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
So I've already done one three-hour podcast today, so now there's this.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
There was Clue yesterday, there was...

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
It's like I had Friday off of work and it still wasn't enough, because I kind of want to call in tomorrow.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Yeah, me too.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Aren't you starting your job tomorrow?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Yes. No.

03:41.000 --> 03:49.000
So yeah, I took a Tylenol PM last night, which I don't usually do, and so I'm feeling really groggy today.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
It's like I can't kick this grog thing I've got going on.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
So I've just decided during tonight's show, you know what? Fuck it.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
I said, Alan! Alan! Do we have any wine?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
He's like, yes, we have like four bottles. What do you want?

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
I'm like, I don't care. I want wine.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
I don't know what it is, but serve it to me in a Coke bottle.

04:09.000 --> 04:19.000
Exactly. So the wonderful Alan is over there right now cracking open a bottle of wine for me so I can have a little bit of a celebratory drink.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
Because it was a really kick-ass weekend, I will say that. I got to see a lot of people last night.

04:24.000 --> 04:32.000
Honestly, I host the thing too, so usually I'm up there on the stage kind of greeting the audience, getting everybody going.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
And I felt like, and I don't usually, I'm usually the first to be self-deprecating about myself and joke about my thing,

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
but I actually think I did a really good job of my improv last night.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
And so it actually kind of made me go like, wow, why don't I do this more often?

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
And I'm like, oh yeah, I have a three-hour radio show every week where I get to kind of practice the speaking skills a little bit.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
So there you go. Oh, Alan, you rule. Thank you so much. You want to say hi to listeners?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Hi, listeners.

04:57.000 --> 05:05.000
Thank you. Mmm. This first sip of wine is for all you guys. Delicious.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Is it sweet and fruity?

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
It is extremely sweet and extremely fruity. You want a sip?

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Sure.

05:09.000 --> 05:17.000
Okay. All right. Let's see. I was going to, oh yes, entire, entire, what?

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
That's actually really good. It tastes like candy.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Isn't it?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
It actually tastes like sweet tarts.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
It's great.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Doesn't it?

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
It's from a local winery. We actually drive out there to the winery. It's only about a 30-minute drive.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Next time you go grab me a bottle. I'm serious. I'll pay you for it.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
Get you addicted. Tiger Claw on our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
We do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

05:38.000 --> 05:45.000
And Tiger Claw says, Rob did something he hasn't done in ages. He shaved. That's right. I am a beardless.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
His legs are smooth.

05:46.000 --> 05:55.000
No. I'm beardless for the first time in a couple of years, I think at this point. So, I mean, I used to, like for most of my twenties, I didn't have a beard.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
The last time you did it was for Rocky, wasn't it? Or for Repo.

05:57.000 --> 06:04.000
Yeah. Rocky or Repo. One of those. But again, last night, Colonel Mustard, who I was playing in the movie, only has a mustache.

06:04.000 --> 06:11.000
So I took it down to my porn stash yesterday, which the minute I walk out of the bathroom, Alan goes, Oh, Freddie Mercury, I love your work.

06:11.000 --> 06:18.000
I'm like, fuck off. So I shaved off the mustache last night. So now I'm clean shaven again.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
The show must go on.

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
Yes. I want to break free. Anyway.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
Was your makeup flaking, but still.

06:28.000 --> 06:36.000
But anyway, so I'm trying to grow back at least some scruff for GamerX because I'm going from one busy weekend to another.

06:36.000 --> 06:42.000
GamerX is next weekend in San Francisco. We will not be here live because of it. I'm sorry. Sorry about it.

06:42.000 --> 06:48.000
But I won't be back on Sunday night for the show. So unfortunately, Studio OLR will be closed on Sunday.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
So look, you get a week off to do whatever and, Dr. Soccer, you can come feed Sanrio.

06:53.000 --> 07:01.000
You know what? GamerX would probably just be like the ultimate dream of any convention because I don't know.

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
Well, just would be fun. You love gay men and women. You love video games.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
I'm expecting that there will also be more bathed people.

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
Yes, I'm hoping for that, too. So it's going to be a good time. I can't wait.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
So, fabulous people, fabulous games, and no con-funk.

07:19.000 --> 07:25.000
You know what they need to do, and this goes for pretty much any con, and I know it might annoy some people and stuff,

07:25.000 --> 07:32.000
but they need to have, what was it? Oh, what the fuck is that place now?

07:32.000 --> 07:39.000
The place with all the stinky fucking shit. I keep wanting to say Bed Bath and Beyond, but it's not Bed Bath and Beyond.

07:39.000 --> 07:46.000
It's Perfumania. God damn, I don't remember the place now. Bath and Body Works, there you go.

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
You need to have a booth there because their stores fucking reek, but they reek of flowery stuff, not con-funk.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
So you get them, you put them in the middle of the con, and then it just kind of averages itself out.

07:58.000 --> 08:06.000
I was there at the AX that people were passing out hygiene bags. It was the last AX I went to, by the way.

08:06.000 --> 08:12.000
Anyhow, this is important to say. GamerX is not just for gay people. It's for everybody.

08:12.000 --> 08:19.000
It's just, you know, it's an all-inclusive event. It's for everybody, and I think it's going to be a good time.

08:19.000 --> 08:27.000
I am co-hosting, co-being on a panel on Saturday. I think it's six, it's five or six. I can't even remember at this point.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
You're co-paneling.

08:29.000 --> 08:39.000
I'm co-paneling Podcast Cross Zone with two guys from Game Buoy, two guys from Koopa Club, and one guy from Game Bar.

08:39.000 --> 08:45.000
And we're going to just be talking about podcasting, and it'll be great. Tigerclaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

08:45.000 --> 08:52.000
I wonder, is there going to be any live stream happening at GamerX? Probably, but not by us. We have no plans to do any live streaming.

08:53.000 --> 09:01.000
I don't like to live stream from cons because hotel Wi-Fi is really unreliable when there's so many people on it.

09:01.000 --> 09:08.000
I believe either the Koopa Club guys or the Game Buoy guys are going to be putting some of that panel in their show.

09:08.000 --> 09:15.000
I know it's being recorded. I don't think we'll use it on OLR, but I will certainly point you in the direction of those recordings when they're posted.

09:15.000 --> 09:22.000
And whatever else comes from it. Stay tuned on Twitter. You can follow me on Twitter. Twitter.com slash S-K-I-E Sky.

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
And I'll be posting lots of tweets from the weekend. So I'm looking forward to it.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
And hopefully no time on all PMs next weekend, so that'll be good.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
All right. I don't know what else to talk about here at the top of the show. Does anybody else have a kickoff topic?

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
According to Loki, I'm crocheting a rainbow penis cozy.

09:40.000 --> 09:47.000
She showed me something that looked like, you know, a little, almost like a mitt for a finger or something like that. I'm like, oh.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Middle finger cozy.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
There's a picture on my Tumblr.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Oh, there you are. All right. Where's your Tumblr again for those who don't know?

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
Kurotsubasa. K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
All right.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
What's recognized by FemShep?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
No, that's mass affecting.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Oh. Eh, whatever. It's okay.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
Hey, my blogs are cool.

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
All right. I guess we will get into how was your gaming week and the types of video games that you have been playing this week.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
I haven't touched Mass Effect again for a week. I know. I know.

10:18.000 --> 10:26.000
I'm playing Animal Crossing. I'm playing a lot of Animal Crossing because I'm trying, since I'm starting work next week, I'm actually trying to save up a lot of money.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
You have substituted one crack for another.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
No, I'm gonna be-

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
You've taken crack from Peru and substituted it for crack from Bolivia.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
You just won crack for another.

10:36.000 --> 10:47.000
No, but I'm gonna be going back to- I'm gonna be changing my livestream night once I'm out of training because I will be working on Thursdays.

10:47.000 --> 10:58.000
So, my streaming will probably be earlier in the day. Probably, I have to make sure it's pre some show or something like that.

10:59.000 --> 11:07.000
Speaking of livestreaming, Bobby wanted me to throw a plug out here and this will be fun. He will be livestreaming Saints Row 4 on August 14th is the day he's gonna do that.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
That'll be exciting.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
I believe it's a Wednesday.

11:09.000 --> 11:17.000
So, yeah. Well, I'm probably gonna finish my Mass Effect 3 stream just because I've beaten that game 27,000 times.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
Actually, no, I think I'm on my 20th playthrough. So, anyway.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
So, yeah. I will be finishing up with that if I can keep it from lagging from the high res graphics that I plugged in.

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
I don't know why it's doing it. My computer is more than capable of handling it, so.

11:31.000 --> 11:39.000
And then I'll be announcing that when that starts back up on masseffecting.tumblr.com. Plug plug.

11:39.000 --> 11:44.000
And in the interim, I am actually making stuff for video games.

11:44.000 --> 11:52.000
I am going to be making little slip pockets for a 3DS. I will be making them in XL size.

11:52.000 --> 11:59.000
And as soon as I have everything set up, I will be doing, I think my first batch is gonna be in Tetris fabric.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
So, if anyone's interested, talk to me.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Fun.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
Yep. But, yeah. Animal Crossing. And pinball.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
What kind of pinball? What games?

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
The stuff in my house.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
You need some pinball games for your 3DS.

12:12.000 --> 12:18.000
I need some other games for my 3DS. Well, we borrowed Fire Emblem from George.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
But Dan wanted to play the previous Fire Emblem first, so he went and bought that.

12:22.000 --> 12:30.000
There is another game going on in my house, and that is Phantasy Star Generation 1. The Sega Ages 1.

12:30.000 --> 12:38.000
So, basically I have been replacing all of the music in Animal Crossing for the updated Phantasy Star.

12:38.000 --> 12:47.000
So, everything sounds like combat from Phantasy Star in Animal Crossing. It's been very, very weird.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
Alright. Let's move on then. Loki, how was your gaming week?

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
Didn't play a whole ton this week. Just a little bit of Borderlands 2.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
It was a few hours. I got all my cards in one sitting.

13:00.000 --> 13:09.000
So, I played up through level 9, and I just got the Sanctuary.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
So, that's my fourth time playing through this game, I swear.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
Because I played through it on console. I played through it on the Xbox three times.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
So, it's like, ooh, I've already done this before.

13:21.000 --> 13:27.000
But, yeah, I'll do that. Yeah, I totally hacked the crap out of the game.

13:27.000 --> 13:33.000
It's what I do. It's my easy mode.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
Your hacking your games is like me modifying my Mass Effect.

13:37.000 --> 13:47.000
I do it all the time. What else? I think I did play Super Meat Boy a little bit this week as well.

13:48.000 --> 13:55.000
I think that's it, though. I have Shadowrun Returns, because they finally sent me the code from Kickstarting that.

13:55.000 --> 14:01.000
So, I did get to download that. I haven't played it yet, although it looks fun.

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
In Video Game High School, Season 2, Episode 1 came out this week.

14:06.000 --> 14:12.000
It was fantastic and long, because now they're all 30 minute long episodes instead of 5 minute episodes.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
It was between 6 and 15 minute episodes last season.

14:17.000 --> 14:24.000
It looks interesting. It's cool. I didn't get a chance to download their high frame rate version yet.

14:24.000 --> 14:31.000
But, the trailer was kind of neat, how they have 48 frames per second for the video game stuff and then 24 for everything else.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
But, it's entertaining. And they've had a lot of cameos in there.

14:35.000 --> 14:42.000
There's already been a Stan Lee cameo and a Cliffy B cameo already in there.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
Oh, so that's what that guy's been up to.

14:45.000 --> 14:52.000
Yeah, he was a judge for something. It was cool.

14:52.000 --> 14:59.000
Alright, well my gaming week. Quite a bit of it's been documented on my livestream channel at twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts.

14:59.000 --> 15:06.000
Right after the show last week, I checked out Rogue Legacy because I said I was going to do that because it was the last thing I wanted to pick up on the Steam sale.

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
So, I did pick that up and I was really impressed with that game.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
I played it for about an hour, an hour and a half on the thing.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
And then I played it again later in the week and it's a lot of fun.

15:18.000 --> 15:25.000
It's kind of like one of those Metroidvania type of games, but the castle each time you play is randomly generated.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
And when I say each time you play, I mean each time you die and you come back as somebody else.

15:29.000 --> 15:39.000
Because that's the whole trick in Rogue Legacy is that you revive as the descendant of the last hero that you played as who will have some very different and unique traits.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
Such as they might be more of a paladin who has a shield.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Or they might be somebody who's a giant.

15:46.000 --> 15:53.000
Or they might be somebody who has turrets so they just randomly have a little cupid's swear cloud that comes up.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
Or somebody who has, they start to do some interesting and a little bit controversial ones.

15:57.000 --> 16:03.000
They have one with dyslexia where all the letters when people talk will get switched around like randomly.

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
And the vertigo one was a pain in the ass. That's where the entire thing is flipped.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
So like you're walking on the ceiling and all that. Oh my gosh, that thing ticked me off.

16:12.000 --> 16:18.000
But yeah, a lot of fun because you collect as much gold as you can when you go to the castle.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
And you can buy power-ups that all the future people will get to use.

16:22.000 --> 16:27.000
But in order to go back in the castle, you have to give up all your gold on hand.

16:27.000 --> 16:33.000
So it really is about get as much gold as you can, make the next hero a little stronger so he can get further, he or she.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
Get as much as you can, make the next hero stronger and so on and so on.

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
And each time it's random. Although at one point you can hire somebody, like I think it's an architect they call it.

16:43.000 --> 16:50.000
And the architect will allow you to keep the same castle as the last generation but you'll only get 40% of the gold.

16:50.000 --> 16:58.000
So it's really a brilliant little trick in the game. I really liked it a lot.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
I was going to say, you'd be a lot better at the vertigo levels if you played more Strider.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
Or if I turned my monitor upside down when those came up.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
Or played a lot more VVVVVV.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
Yeah, right. Or just don't pick those guys moving forward, which is my plan.

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
Because you get to pick from which one of three descendants do you want to play as.

17:19.000 --> 17:24.000
And so no more. I did the vertigo one for the LOL on the feed when I was broadcasting.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
But no more of those. It's kind of one of those. You do it once for the laughs and then that's it.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
So that was Rogue Legacy.

17:30.000 --> 17:36.000
Bobby and I finally had our much advertised and talked about Borderlands Noob Night on Tuesday.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
Yeah, I missed that. Like I didn't read my tweets.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
Yeah, we tagged you in it just to see if you were going to drop in.

17:42.000 --> 17:48.000
And we actually played from the start of the game to about level 7-ish.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
So I think we were in like chapter 3 or something by the time we stopped.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
I mean, you know, we played a pretty good chunk of the game.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
So did you finish Captain Flint or did you...

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Yes, I think that was the last guy we killed.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
And then we got on a boat and we were taken somewhere else.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Okay, so you're chapter 4 then.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Oh, was it really? Wow.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
The first few chapters are fast.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
Yeah, but I mean the only downside to it is because we were both playing,

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
I think the tutorials were ping-ponging between us.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Because Bobby would be like, oh, just hit this key to do this.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Didn't the game tell you that? It'd be like, no.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
And then there'd be something he didn't know because the game showed me.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
So it was kind of a little weird.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
So I would really recommend if you're going to play Borderlands 2,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
don't do co-op right out the gate.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
But it was fun. I mean, we had a good time.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
And I think we entertained the folks that were watching us broadcasting on Twitch.

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
But, you know, I'm really bad at first-person shooters.

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
But the cool thing about Borderlands 2 is that the character I was playing had a little,

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
once you got to level 5, you got a little gun turret that you can place on the ground

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
and it'll automatically shoot people. So that was cool.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
And Bobby was playing the Meckromancer, who is the, that was the controversial,

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
I'm using my quote-e-fingers, girlfriend mode.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
But in reality it's supposed to be best friends forever mode.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
I think we were calling it here at VoG Black Wolf Fun Forever mode.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
Because that's the one where the bullets that miss will bounce off walls

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
and hit anyway for part of the damage or something like that.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
So I wanted to play as the Meckromancer because I'm terrible at first-person shooters, right?

19:13.000 --> 19:20.000
Now, when Borderlands 2 was on sale on Steam, I was gifted a copy of Borderlands 2

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
by a great listener, and I picked up the season pass myself.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
Because I'm like, alright, well, I know I'm going to want to do all the DLC

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
and all the other stuff that's out right now, so I'm just going to pick up the season pass

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
and then that way I'll have it when I want to play.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
Well, when I go in to play the game again, the second time, later in the week,

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
I went back in the game, I'm like, I'm going to try this again,

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
but this time I'm going to do the Meckromancer.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
It's locked. And I'm like, wait a minute, I should have this because I bought the season pass.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
And I do some research, and I'm like, wait a minute, the season pass is showing on my account, what's going on?

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
The characters aren't included in the season pass.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
She was a pre-order bonus.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
See, and that's the line I've been getting from a lot of people.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
Yes, okay, she was a pre-order bonus, but they're still selling her.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
Here's the thing, and not everybody's going to agree with me, and that's fine,

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
but we all get opinions, so take it or leave it.

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
I kind of think when they're selling this as a season pass, and they're leaving parts out,

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
that's a little bit disingenuous to me.

20:15.000 --> 20:20.000
And you may argue with me on that, and that's fine, but to me, it's like picking up, like,

20:20.000 --> 20:26.000
you know, when you get a season pass, like when I pick up Lost Season 7 on DVD,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Episode 4 is suddenly missing.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
Oh, well, Episode 4 was a pre-order bonus only.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Not how it works, yo.

20:35.000 --> 20:40.000
So I think it's more appropriately titled as a, it's a bundle.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
That's what you're selling. You're selling a DLC bundle.

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
Well, yeah, like, we haven't gotten into it yet, but for Saints Pro 4, it's like,

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
come on, the amount of content that you include in your season pass,

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
I mean, granted, the price is really low on it, it's not a season pass.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
It's just a bundle.

20:56.000 --> 21:02.000
It was like for Mass Effect 2, the Cerberus pass thing, or the whole, it was a big Cerberus network pass.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
It gave you a bunch of stuff, but it didn't give you all the DLC.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
Right, but they didn't market it as something that, like, you know,

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
a season pass, I think, implies a particular thing.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
And maybe this is just a terminology thing in our industry,

21:12.000 --> 21:18.000
and we've been here before with the whole download content that's actually on a disc,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
and I think we were all sitting here on the show saying,

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
that is not DLC, that is Pay to Unlock content, that is what it is.

21:24.000 --> 21:29.000
And what I'm saying is that the Borderlands 2 season pass is not a season pass,

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
it is a DLC bundle, that is what it is.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
You can disagree with me if you want, that's fine, that's my opinion.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
It's not a season pass, it's missing some episodes.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Sensible.

21:39.000 --> 21:46.000
So, anyhow, overall, that doesn't reflect on my opinion of the game,

21:46.000 --> 21:51.000
I still think it's a fine game, and I think even if you don't like first person shooters,

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
I think it's just got a really, you know, it's got a neat story,

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
and it's got some cool mechanics that are reminiscent of like an MMO and so forth.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
It's very diabolous.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
And co-op mode is a lot of fun, I will say that.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
But, you know, that was just my one little thing that did irk me a little bit.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
Did you find yourself comparing guns a lot?

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
You know, like going, ooh, ooh.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Do you have the passive aggressive gun?

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
No, not yet, I don't think.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
You know, if you had been a better shot, you wouldn't have been wasting bullets.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Those cost money, you know.

22:19.000 --> 22:25.000
It was tough in co-op because what I'm used to in Diablo is that everybody gets their own loot.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
That doesn't happen in Borderlands, so if Bobby picks up all the ammo, I'm stuck.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
Uh, not exactly. It will pool ammo, I think.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
Oh, will it? I knew it pooled money.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
Yeah, it will pool ammo, yeah.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Oh, okay, my bad.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Here's the question I have to ask about this.

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
I've got Borderlands 2 now, I actually have the first one because I got it for free back in the day.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
Do I have any benefit to finishing the first one before starting the second?

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
No benefit from finishing, well, a story, I guess.

22:52.000 --> 22:58.000
You get to learn a little bit more of the backstory of different characters because they do end up in the game as NPCs,

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
so you know who this person is when you go and see him.

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
Aside from that, the only other bonus you get is you get some unlockable skins when you play the first game.

23:06.000 --> 23:12.000
But you have to have a save file for the first game, so just play for five minutes to get a save file going and then play Borderlands 2.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
Because, I mean, I watched Dan play the first one, you know, and I got so motion sick.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
But I'm planning on playing through Borderlands 2 and calling it a bar fest when I stream it.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Good times.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
I plan on streaming it.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
They have a third person mode that you can unlock via a hack.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
That's okay.

23:28.000 --> 23:33.000
Games that are intended to be first person don't usually play as well third person.

23:33.000 --> 23:38.000
So, I'm looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

23:38.000 --> 23:44.000
Dungeon Buster says, it would have been nice if the season pass weren't limited to only for the four DLC campaigns,

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
but would allow you to pick which four DLC you would want for the entire season.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
I kind of like that.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
I mean, again, I don't think season pass is the name for that, but I really like the idea of pick them and choose them.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
And here's the thing.

23:56.000 --> 24:02.000
I would have bought the Mechromancer separately in addition to the season pass if I'd known.

24:02.000 --> 24:09.000
And I will take some accountability for not reading thoroughly as I should have, but it's just kind of like a certain thing is sort of implied by that.

24:09.000 --> 24:14.000
No, I was with you because I was looking at the Mechromancer thing and I saw that it was separate too.

24:14.000 --> 24:21.000
It wasn't actually that that I noticed. I was going through some skins because I modded it to unlock all the skins.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
And so I was going through the skins and like, oh, I want to wear that one.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
And it like popped me to the Steam store.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
I'm like, why does it show me stuff that's in there that I don't have?

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Oh, you want me to buy it?

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
No, I'm not going to buy it.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Dangling the carrot in front of you.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
But again, all that other.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
That's what SDO does, by the way.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
All that other junk.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
Well, SDO is a free to play game too, so you cut it some different.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
But for paid outfits, it gives you the option of setting up that outfit.

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
And then when you load the outfit on your character, when you're making them, it says this is pay XX amount.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Gotcha.

24:51.000 --> 24:57.000
Well, speaking of free to play, the other game I've been playing this week, and I really can't explain how this happened,

24:57.000 --> 25:04.000
but I've sunk in about five, six hours in Dota 2, Defense of the Ancients 2, which is a free game.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
I know there's probably like some people out there going, what?

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
But it's a free game on Steam.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
It was in beta for the longest time, and it just officially launched a couple weeks ago.

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
And it is very similar to another game called League of Legends, which I'm sure many of you have heard about.

25:18.000 --> 25:25.000
And the reason why these two games are so similar is because both of them have influence from the original mod

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
called Defense of the Ancients that was in Warcraft 3.

25:28.000 --> 25:34.000
It was an insanely popular mod to the game, just like Team Fortress was a popular mod to Quake, and so on.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
You know, sometimes mods become their own little thing.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
So Defense of the Ancients became its own game, essentially.

25:40.000 --> 25:46.000
So Valve has the Dota 2, there's League of Legends, and there's all these other games that are inspired by it too.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Blizzard's going to have their own thing.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
All Stars, I think is what it's called.

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
There's Heroes of New Earth, and there's more and more of these showing up.

25:54.000 --> 26:02.000
I really can't tell you why I chose to play Dota 2, especially because of Hoard House, my other show.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
There's been a lot of talk about League of Legends.

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
But I feel like, or I felt like for the longest time, I'm like, I don't get League of Legends.

26:09.000 --> 26:15.000
It has a tutorial mode, but it doesn't help me understand how to get good at this game or whatever.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
Here's the thing with Dota 2.

26:18.000 --> 26:23.000
So I think what happened is I was looking around the community marketplace, and I was looking at the trading cards,

26:23.000 --> 26:28.000
the value of cards, and I was looking at some of the stuff that was in Dota 2, that was up there on the marketplace.

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
And I decided to just launch the game, because apparently I had some stuff from Dota 2

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
for just being in the beta, so I just wanted to launch the game and see what it was all about.

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
And I noticed right away, when I launched the game, the launcher looked different than it did before.

26:41.000 --> 26:46.000
I was like, oh, this is laid out all differently, and it threw me right into this tutorial mode.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Do you want to learn how to start playing the game?

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
So I said, alright, whatever, I'm going to sit here.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
I didn't get it when I played League of Legends, but maybe I'll get it this time.

26:53.000 --> 26:59.000
So I started to play, I played the first tutorial, I played the second tutorial, and I kept playing.

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
And here I was, I was actually learning how to play Dota 2.

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
And all these things that I'm sure if you're a League of Legends player sitting out there listening,

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
you're probably going, duh Rob.

27:09.000 --> 27:15.000
I didn't really get like, oh, so the point is not to just go out there and attack as fast as you can.

27:15.000 --> 27:21.000
You actually have to time your hits, you have to be kind of walking with your little NPCs,

27:21.000 --> 27:26.000
they're kind of your meat shields, you hang back, and there's always this game of chicken going on.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
You don't necessarily engage other heroes directly, you have to wait for the opportunity moment to strike.

27:30.000 --> 27:36.000
Like, all of this is finally hitting me the way the Dota 2's thing was built.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Like, it's tutorial mode is great.

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
And then it takes you from that to, okay, now you're going to play a map,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
and all you're going to do, you're going to take out one tower.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
And then it says, okay, now this time you're going to do a middle lane fight.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
The only lane that's available is the middle lane, and it's a 1v1 map.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
And you just kind of learn and learn and learn that way.

27:54.000 --> 28:02.000
And right now I'm on the part of it where I'm playing an entire match against bots, but with limited heroes selection.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
So I've been learning how to play the game, and it's fun.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
But it's still an RTS, right?

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
It's what they call a MOBA. It's kind of a new genre of game.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
It's a multiplayer online battle arena.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Eh.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
It's different. I can't really say it's like an RTS.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Because RTS games just make me hurt.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
Well, imagine an RTS mixed with World of Warcraft.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
It's, I mean, that's really a crude way of putting it, but it's the best I can do.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
Yeah, I don't know that, I still don't know that I would like it.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Because, I mean, I've been thinking about it, and I've seen people play it.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
But I hate real-time strategies, and it's not because I'm not good at them.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
I'm really good at them. I just think that they're very boring.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Well, I would honestly recommend Dota 2.

28:43.000 --> 28:49.000
Just get in there and play the tutorial mode, because you don't really play against other people until towards the end of it, if you want.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
And the nice thing about Dota 2 is if you want to play an all-bot match, you can.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
But here's the interesting thing. Now that I've done this, now I want to go back and play League of Legends again.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Because I feel like, okay, now I get it.

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
And everybody tells me League of Legends is kind of easier to wrap your head around than Dota.

29:02.000 --> 29:07.000
Because I guess there is still a lot of stuff beyond the tutorials and Dota that I haven't really experienced yet.

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
But I want to go back and play League of Legends, and, you know, you can do bot matches there and everything.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
So, the only negatives I ever hear about these games is the community.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
That the communities in these games are really awful.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
But, you know, the makers of the games, to their credits, are taking strides to try and combat that.

29:22.000 --> 29:29.000
There's a big old blog post on the Dota 2 forums, and League of Legends, I know, has their whole community tribal councils.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
I think we were calling it on Horde House, and so forth.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
So, you know, they're trying.

29:33.000 --> 29:39.000
But, yeah, so this week I want to go back and play League of Legends and see if I get it this time.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
I'll give it a, okay, how about this?

29:42.000 --> 29:49.000
How about at some point this week, if I'm not completely fried with my new job, I will give it a try.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
And I will report on it by the next show.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Sounds good.

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
Alright, technus in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
If you really get into Dota 2 League of Legends, you would actually find that they do play differently.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Yeah, I don't doubt that technus.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
I read some of the comparison articles online.

30:05.000 --> 30:10.000
I've heard a lot about the timing and, you know, things that they do play differently in that regard.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
And, you know, just the way they're laid out and so forth.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
So, you know, we'll see.

30:16.000 --> 30:22.000
Technus says, I felt that League of Legends had a better hand-holding tutorial, but I haven't touched Dota 2 past beta.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
I think that tutorial went in when it launched.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
So that's the thing.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
And, yeah, Kossin in our chat room, I hope I said that right, says,

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
Dota has tutorials now? Yes, it does.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
So, you know, if you're curious about it, why not? Check it out.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
So, yeah, I guess that was really my gaming week in a nutshell.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
So, some quick housekeeping.

30:42.000 --> 30:47.000
Don't forget to visit our website, orangelaunchradio.com, and our Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
And Facebook, facebook.com slash orangelaunchradio.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
I apologize.

30:51.000 --> 30:56.000
There was no foogle question of the week this week, so we won't be able to do that segment in part B.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
That is my bad and just the insanity, crazy weekend I had.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
I literally threw this show together about an hour before we went live tonight.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
So, yeah, we cut some corners.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
I just thought of a question.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
Did you? Yeah.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
Well, we can ask it in two weeks when we come back.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Well, it won't be relevant then, but it's okay.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Don't. What were you gonna ask?

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Well, I'll bring it up with my story. How about that?

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Okay, there you go. I was gonna say, ask the chatters.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
You know, you can get some immediate feedback there.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
Yeah, I'll ask the chatters and then we'll, yeah.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
All right, there you go. Maybe some emails. Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
All right, let's get into the news tonight. Loki.

31:27.000 --> 31:32.000
All right, as the next continuing chapter of the 180 saga,

31:33.000 --> 31:37.000
Microsoft has now confirmed that despite what they said earlier,

31:37.000 --> 31:44.000
they made it a small error and, yes, there will actually be self-publishing now for the Xbox One.

31:44.000 --> 31:51.000
And it's kind of funny. It was supposed to be an announcement at Gamescom

31:51.000 --> 31:58.000
and then somehow got leaked out by Game Informer and here we are.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
So basically, their quote is,

32:00.000 --> 32:06.000
Our vision is that every person can be a creator, that every Xbox One can be used for development,

32:06.000 --> 32:12.000
that every game and experience can take advantage of all the features of the Xbox One and Xbox Live.

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
This means self-publishing. This means Kinect, the cloud, achievements.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
This means great discoverability on Xbox Live.

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
We'll have more details in the program and a timeline at Gamescom in August.

32:24.000 --> 32:33.000
I'm confused. First off, it's good news, but once again, anything that has to do with Microsoft

32:33.000 --> 32:37.000
or even just anything that has to do with a lot of these console launches

32:37.000 --> 32:42.000
where you're going to see a lot of those asterisks and a lot of fine print and stuff,

32:42.000 --> 32:48.000
we don't know all the details yet of what the self-publishing is going to require, what you can do.

32:48.000 --> 32:54.000
It sounds cool that we can use any of the retail consoles as a dev unit.

32:54.000 --> 33:00.000
I mean, that's kind of cool, but we don't know yet what the requirements are going to be

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
as far as submitting something in there.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
Are you going to have to go through a review process? Is it going to be like XNA was?

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
Don't really know, but it sounds interesting.

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
They're trying to, I think, cover some ground to get some of those indies back

33:14.000 --> 33:20.000
after they've had such a bad reputation with how they treat indie developers and stuff,

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
especially on the Xbox 360 and continuing that to the Xbox One.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
Do you mean by cover ground, cover their ass?

33:27.000 --> 33:32.000
Yeah, to help make up ground that they lost.

33:32.000 --> 33:37.000
Also, there's a rumor that this might not just pertain to the Xbox One,

33:37.000 --> 33:47.000
that apparently the developer Farsight Studios, who's done some work on the Pinball Arcade,

33:47.000 --> 33:52.000
said that Microsoft has just announced that indie developers like them

33:52.000 --> 33:58.000
can now publish on Xbox Live Arcade instead of being required to find a publisher for their games.

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
This means we can bring the Pinball Arcade back to the 360 ourselves

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
and open the door to the Xbox One version of the Pinball Arcade in the future.

34:06.000 --> 34:11.000
So, it sounds like this may also apply to the Xbox 360 as well.

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
Yeah, technically you have to file that in the rumor bin, but when it's coming out like this,

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
it's kind of like one of those things where it's like, oh, they probably got told something.

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
Because that game was a pretty big deal, and it sucks that it disappeared.

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
So, it's no wonder. I bet Microsoft themselves kind of wants to get that game back.

34:26.000 --> 34:32.000
So, this is interesting with how they're going to do this, but at the same time,

34:32.000 --> 34:39.000
I mean, I don't know, this is almost like, well, now that this isn't really exclusive to the Xbox One,

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
you're kind of competing with yourself again, you know?

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
It's just like, all these great games are coming out on the Xbox 360.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
Why do I need to spend $500 to get an Xbox One that has pretty much the same games?

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
They look slightly better. I don't know.

34:53.000 --> 34:57.000
Well, Microsoft doesn't exactly lose by selling more 360s.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
That's true. No, I don't think that they lose.

35:00.000 --> 35:06.000
But their strategy, and this is from the horse's mouth actually, is that they're going to have so many SKUs,

35:06.000 --> 35:11.000
and it's a four or five SKUs strategy is basically what it is.

35:11.000 --> 35:17.000
They have a four gig system. They have a four gig system with Kinect, a 250 gig system.

35:17.000 --> 35:22.000
They got rid of the 250 gig system with Kinect because that was competing with the Xbox One.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
They figured that the people that are going to be buying that are going to be buying the Xbox One.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
So then you have the Xbox One, and then whatever holiday bundle it is.

35:28.000 --> 35:32.000
That's their strategy going in, and I think that's going to be going forward is how they're going to do it.

35:32.000 --> 35:38.000
They're going to have four or five SKUs, depending on whether there's a holiday bundle available, or a bundle of some sort.

35:38.000 --> 35:42.000
SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

35:42.000 --> 35:46.000
Just seems very vague. I expect this won't be ready day one.

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
I think a lot of this they're just trying to save because they're talking at Gamescom.

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
They don't want to just like, yeah, you guys already heard all this information. Let's just repeat it again.

35:54.000 --> 36:00.000
But I think it's kind of lame that they're doing that because people want to know.

36:00.000 --> 36:05.000
Developers want to know what the details are so they can consider making their games for your platform,

36:05.000 --> 36:11.000
and yet you're just like, but we really want to talk about it at Gamescom, so we're just going to wait.

36:11.000 --> 36:15.000
You're going to just have to wait and see. I mean, that's kind of dumb.

36:15.000 --> 36:21.000
Tell the developers. Yeah, the developers will leak it out. Put them under NDA or something. I don't know.

36:21.000 --> 36:26.000
Akuma JP in our chatroom says, Sounds like Microsoft is suffering from multiple personality disorder.

36:26.000 --> 36:34.000
Well, they did. To be fair, they did take a beating at E3, and they went through a major management change just in the past month.

36:34.000 --> 36:39.000
So the fact that some of these things are starting to come out isn't that surprising.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
It's just like, how fast can it really happen? I think it's all good news.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
It'll be interesting. It's good news at the end of the day. Yeah.

36:46.000 --> 36:51.000
It'll be interesting to see how it's going to work as far as like, are we going to see, you know,

36:51.000 --> 36:57.000
are we going to see the Xbox Live Arcade Marketplace turned into kind of like what Xbox Indie Games is?

36:57.000 --> 37:03.000
I hope not, because that's going to be really difficult to find stuff with everybody publishing titles.

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
Well, especially since, you know, one of the big words they used was deliverability.

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
I mean, they have to make it easy to access to make it deliverable.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
I think a lot of it, too, is it would really help them out.

37:14.000 --> 37:20.000
I would think it's going to look more like iTunes, because iTunes, you know, is this self-publishing central.

37:20.000 --> 37:24.000
I'll tell you what this really is. It's not about, you know, publishing on the Xbox One stuff,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
although that's good and everything.

37:26.000 --> 37:31.000
What it is is it's, the way they have it, the way you develop games on the,

37:31.000 --> 37:35.000
it's not even really the, you know, Xbox Marketplace or whatever.

37:35.000 --> 37:39.000
It's the Windows Store is basically what it is.

37:39.000 --> 37:46.000
When you publish a game, it's available on, you know, for PC or Windows 8, Windows Phone,

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
and now the Microsoft, you know, Xbox One.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
That's what it's going to be, is publishing on all three platforms.

37:52.000 --> 37:58.000
And they're getting, they're trying to get to a point where you buy like Angry Birds on Windows 8,

37:58.000 --> 38:02.000
now you have Angry Birds on your Xbox One and on your Windows Phone.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
I think that's exactly where my mind's going.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
That is key, because that's how iTunes works, if you think about it.

38:07.000 --> 38:12.000
You can buy from your mobile device or your iPad, or you can buy on your desktop.

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
And then through the cloud, it all shows up on all your devices automatically.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
And I really think that's how the game systems ought to work, Sony included.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
Nintendo too, if they could ever get there.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
Unless you buy the better version for your iPad that takes advantage of the iPad's resolution.

38:26.000 --> 38:30.000
But from what I heard from them, they're a long way away from that.

38:30.000 --> 38:36.000
Like, they may be promising something like that right now, but 2015 at the earliest, this is going to happen.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
So it's a long way off.

38:39.000 --> 38:44.000
We had discussions with Microsoft, the Microsoft reps about this kind of stuff, because that was my thought,

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
and they were like, yeah, you're right.

38:46.000 --> 38:53.000
It's interesting, but I think it's just, and I'm kind of hesitant at the same time as like,

38:53.000 --> 38:58.000
okay, you can develop games for Xbox One, are they really going to be Xbox One games,

38:58.000 --> 39:05.000
or are they going to be these Windows games running on that Windows OS portion of the Xbox 360

39:05.000 --> 39:11.000
that just happened to be, or I'm sorry, Xbox One, that just happened to be part of the Xbox One.

39:11.000 --> 39:17.000
It's not actually a true native Xbox One game, you know what I mean?

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
All right, well, it's going to be interesting to see what develops,

39:20.000 --> 39:25.000
and also kind of how the Microsoft Sony dance continues with this.

39:25.000 --> 39:29.000
So, I mean, obviously Microsoft's doing this in some way to catch up to Sony,

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
and their reaction they got at E3,

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
so it'll be interesting to see what Sony might do to kind of one-up that.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
But anyway, let's talk about a big budget game,

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
and a game that a lot of folks are excited about over on Nintendo's platform,

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
Smash Brothers, Super Smash Brothers.

39:47.000 --> 39:52.000
Now, a new story came out this week that Masahiro Sakurai said that in the story mode,

39:52.000 --> 39:57.000
there will not be a subspace emissary storyline that was in Brawl.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
There will be a single-player campaign, however.

39:59.000 --> 40:04.000
But in Famitsu Magazine, he actually said that the story mode won't happen,

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
because cutscenes get uploaded on the internet.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
Really weird excuse, but here's the quote for us to ponder.

40:10.000 --> 40:15.000
Quote, unfortunately, the movie scenes we worked hard to create were uploaded onto the internet.

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
You can only truly wow a player the first time he sees a cutscene.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
I felt if players saw the cutscenes outside of the game,

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
they would no longer service rewards for playing the game,

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
so I've decided against having them.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
That's a very strange quote. Let's chew on that for a minute.

40:31.000 --> 40:35.000
That's a quote from somebody who doesn't understand how the internet works.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
Right.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
You know, it's basically, I understand his point of view where,

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
you know, woo, that's a really cool video and stuff,

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
but, you know, that's like saying, once you've seen a movie,

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
like, if you see a movie trailer, you're not gonna want to see the movie,

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
because you saw scenes from the movie in the movie trailer.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Yeah, but with all the let's play and all of that,

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
you can see a heck of a lot more than a trailer of a game that's, you know, out there.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
I understand that, but not...

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
And Nintendo's also taken a stance against let's play in the past,

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
even though they might have went back on it.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
But people that are watching let's play videos

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
aren't necessarily gonna be the people that are gonna be spoiled by,

41:09.000 --> 41:13.000
oh, I can't play this game anymore because I watched it being played through already.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
It's not gonna be like that.

41:14.000 --> 41:18.000
If anything, it's gonna get people excited because they see these awesome cutscenes.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
They're like, whoa, I want to see, you know, more of this game.

41:21.000 --> 41:25.000
But just instead of making excuses about YouTube

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
and, you know, saying that's why you did it, just be honest.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
We want to get this game out right away.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
This is a feature that not a lot of people utilize,

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
so we're gonna focus on the multiplayer

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
and make that the best part of the game

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
because that's what people want to play when they play Smash.

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
Just come out and say that instead of being a dick about it and saying,

41:42.000 --> 41:47.000
hey, yeah, it's because those people upload our videos on YouTube.

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
Come on, it's just ridiculous.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
I'm with you there a little bit. I'm really with you there a little bit.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
This does seem like a convenient excuse to get the game moving right along,

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
which is fine, but yeah, exactly the way you said it.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
I think if he came out and said it that way, a lot of people would be like, yay.

42:01.000 --> 42:06.000
Yeah, if something we tried, if Brawl, it was, you know, some people liked it.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Not a lot of people really, you know, played it.

42:08.000 --> 42:12.000
So instead of focusing a lot of, instead of splitting our team, you know, down the middle

42:12.000 --> 42:17.000
and, you know, focusing it all on, or half on the single player and half on the multiplayer,

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
we're just gonna focus on the multiplayer.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Hell, that's what they did for Titanfall.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
And I still don't buy that excuse, by the way, for Titanfall either,

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
because honestly I do care about a single player campaign for, you know,

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
a first person shooter versus a single player campaign for a fighting game.

42:31.000 --> 42:36.000
Right, right. So, there you go.

42:36.000 --> 42:45.000
I hope that the game really kicks butt, but if the fighting element of the game is really, really good,

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
then I think people will forget about this in six months.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
But there could have been a better way to deliver this news.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
So, all right.

42:53.000 --> 42:57.000
Speaking of other bad news, or don't care about this news, who knows.

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
Because I've heard from people that there's various minds going on about this.

43:01.000 --> 43:07.000
But PolyTron put out an announcement that Fez 2 was cancelled, and Phil Fish says, yep, I'm done.

43:07.000 --> 43:17.000
And this is going after some internet dramas of various bitch levels.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
I'm just gonna go out and say it.

43:19.000 --> 43:23.000
It's people being bitchy on the internet and people outbitching the other and outtrolling the other.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
And actually, listen to Bobby's show.

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
Because he went off on it in a way that I 100% agree with.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
It was ridiculous.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
It's not a big surprise.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
It's not a big surprise. It's something that he would do.

43:36.000 --> 43:40.000
Because, you know, one of the things he was arguing about with the Annoyed Gamer thing was,

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
it's like, what kind of art have you put out?

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
It's almost like your stupid show or whatever is nothing.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
I've created art with Fez.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
It's like, dude, you've put out one indie game.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
You're not fucking God, okay?

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
It's just, it's a game.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Yeah, it was great. People liked it. Cool.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
But you're not like, just get off your high horse.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
One damn game, man.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
One game.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
This, to me, looks like an internet meltdown.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
Yeah. That's kind of one of those things that Twitter does.

44:10.000 --> 44:14.000
I mean, look at, one of my favorite comparisons I've heard out there on the internet is that Phil Fe,

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
and to be fair, I really don't know this guy.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
I played Fez a couple times. It's fine.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
But I really just don't care.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
I haven't seen that indie game movie. I'll sit down and watch it at one of these points.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
You know, but I just, it's a movie.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
And, you know, reality shows distort people all the time.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
You always take that stuff with a grain of salt.

44:30.000 --> 44:36.000
But this really just seems like a big pomp and circumstance about something that doesn't,

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
like, it's just, this whole thing's like a waste of time.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
You know?

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
And in the end?

44:40.000 --> 44:45.000
Oh, sorry. My favorite comparison I heard out there on the internet was that Phil Fish is the Amanda Bynes of gaming.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Okay.

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
My whole thing with it is, is that, um,

44:50.000 --> 44:57.000
if you find yourself close to a meltdown, and this is, what you need to do is take a step back,

44:57.000 --> 45:01.000
go someplace safe where you have nothing to trigger you,

45:01.000 --> 45:07.000
you know, watch some cartoons, you know, sit back and watch some Adventure Time,

45:07.000 --> 45:13.000
open a couple beers, and play on Tumblr for a while, because Tumblr's sort of safe too.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
You know, it happens to the best of us.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
I had a diva fit here on OLR one night.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
It was, it was an infamous moment that happened.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
It was like five years ago at this point.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
You scared the shit out of Shermie.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
No, no, no. That wasn't at your place. That was at the studio.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
You had one at my house.

45:27.000 --> 45:32.000
I might've had a little one, but I had a big one when something like the wrong thing was said in the chat room.

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
And remember I left and I'm like, you know what?

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
If you don't like, I left, I just quit mid show.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
I didn't quit the show, but I just said, you know what?

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
I'm going to go do something more fun than this right now.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
Cause I'm not taking this right now.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
No way.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
I'm not making Fez 2.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
You kind of, I kind of did have that diva moment.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
So I can understand in that regard.

45:51.000 --> 45:55.000
And I was just frustrated by a lot of things that were going on that night.

45:55.000 --> 45:59.000
And then a chat room chat listener just really said something that got under my skin.

45:59.000 --> 46:04.000
So in that regard, I can kind of sympathize, but at the same time, from what I do hear about this guy,

46:04.000 --> 46:08.000
he does kind of make these very trolley generous or generalized comments.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
Sometimes he kind of brings a little bit of it on himself.

46:11.000 --> 46:16.000
So it's hard to feel a whole lot of pity for the guy, you know, but I kind of sit here and go,

46:16.000 --> 46:23.000
you're going to take what this guy who calls himself, himself annoyed gamer says to get under your skin.

46:23.000 --> 46:27.000
I mean, and again, I don't know this other guy either, this annoyed gamer or whatever,

46:27.000 --> 46:32.000
but I kind of look at that name going, wow, you sound like everything that I hate about the games industry,

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
all in two little words right there.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
Besides, I am the annoyed gamer.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Why don't you just call yourself cynical fuck?

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
You know, I'm just kind of like.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
Besides that, the angry video game nerd did it better.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
And that was parody.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Yeah. And he's actually hilarious.

46:45.000 --> 46:49.000
So I and I think this other guy is kind of trying to be legit, but it does seem weird to me.

46:49.000 --> 46:55.000
Again, if the whole thing boils down to that, you know, Phil Fish did not want to comment on this,

46:55.000 --> 47:01.000
you know, Xbox thing that's going on, he should have just said no comment or no thank you,

47:01.000 --> 47:06.000
as opposed to fuck you, you fucking fuck, which is, you know, not a direct quote,

47:06.000 --> 47:11.000
but the sense of what I get happened in that paraphrase, paraphrasing a little bit.

47:11.000 --> 47:17.000
You know, like I said, he needs to take a step back, go to a safe place,

47:17.000 --> 47:25.000
maybe put on some old school Duran Duran, bop out a little bit to Hungry Like the Wolf,

47:25.000 --> 47:30.000
and then maybe come back with a cooler head.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
All right. And I'm checking the chat room ZZZ in our chat room says,

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
was the episode where Rob Ragequitted the show ever uploaded?

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
I only listened to the podcast at the time. I didn't get to hear it.

47:40.000 --> 47:46.000
I think the whole thing happened over a video card error that happened,

47:46.000 --> 47:49.000
because that's why the listeners pulled together and bought this new computer

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
that we broadcast the show from, and that happened after the diva moment.

47:52.000 --> 47:59.000
So I think the video card like went out mid-show, and I actually lost the show up to that point,

47:59.000 --> 48:03.000
and then when we recorded again, that comment was said, and I think the show got thrown out.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
I don't think it was ever a podcast, to be honest.

48:06.000 --> 48:11.000
I think it was captured because at the time we were streaming on Justin TV.

48:11.000 --> 48:15.000
This was before Twitch existed. I think some of it lived on there,

48:15.000 --> 48:19.000
but I think it's long gone. It's too old at this point.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Unless we had our bootlegger.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
You really don't need to see it.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
It wasn't pretty.

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
Don't try to capture one of my worst moments in radio.

48:28.000 --> 48:32.000
That's the downside to it. I like to think I've done about...

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Promise says it was on the feed, and actually it isn't.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
Was it?

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
Yeah.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
Oh, I don't remember.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
They just don't remember which episode.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
I don't either. It's for the bad. You know what?

48:41.000 --> 48:48.000
One bad moment out of like 514 episodes, you know, why do you want to fixate on that one bad moment?

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
That's all I'm saying, is like, can't we...

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Because that's what people do.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
Yeah, I know.

48:53.000 --> 49:00.000
I mean, maybe Lindsay Lohan was once a great actress, but people remember all the bad shit she's done.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
What about all the good things Lindsay did?

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
It's just people are focusing...

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Like going to rehab.

49:05.000 --> 49:10.000
People are just focusing on everything because it's just a slow news week, honestly.

49:10.000 --> 49:15.000
Like, I couldn't believe how many people were running, how many different outlets were running that story.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
I was just like, are you kidding me? Come on.

49:17.000 --> 49:21.000
Didn't the whole thing that Phil Fish blew up at...

49:21.000 --> 49:27.000
Didn't the whole thing boil down to the fact that this media guy felt like he deserved a comment on the situation,

49:27.000 --> 49:32.000
was calling out him and Jonathan Blow because they wouldn't comment on the Xbox situation?

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
I don't know.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
Isn't that what it boiled down to?

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
Yeah.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
I was like...

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
I was trying to provoke a reaction. Well, they got one.

49:38.000 --> 49:42.000
I was at a three-year-old's birthday party and I look on the internet and all of a sudden...

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Yeah, because I check Twitter just every now and then.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
I mean, Lindsay...

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
You know what? Maybe I should make him a rainbow penis cozy.

49:47.000 --> 49:55.000
You know what, annoyed gamer or whatever, you know, welcome to my world where we just get ignored.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
How would you prefer that?

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
I know. I mean, I ignored by all the different media outlets.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Exactly. I'm like...

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Except occasionally Namco.

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
You should be lucky you get any comments at all. Anyway.

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
Who are you? Who? Who are you?

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
Hey, I'm the annoyed gamer, okay?

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
I'm annoyed and I'm the gamer.

50:17.000 --> 50:21.000
You are kind of the OG annoyed gamer guy.

50:21.000 --> 50:29.000
But when we talk about Saints Row 4 or Grand Theft Auto, you suddenly become the hehehe gamer.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
You know, therefore the tickled gamer when it comes to those games.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
How about the bipolar gamer?

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
Well, I am a little annoyed that I'm not playing Saints Row 4 right now, so...

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
That is a little annoying, isn't it?

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
So what does that make me, the crafty gamer?

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
Hmm... I don't know.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
Penis cozy?

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Yeah, you're the rainbow penis cozy gamer.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
Alright.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Maybe we should send him one. Maybe that would make him feel better.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
Perhaps. I don't know.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Alright, oh yeah, real quick. There was a cotton...

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
It's 100% cotton. Feel it.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
That's too hot. I can already tell.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
I don't know.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Alright, let's move on with more news.

51:02.000 --> 51:16.000
Alright, so, you know, to kind of keep along the theme of Microsoft fixing some of their hiccups in their, I don't know, game development process.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
They're working on World of Tanks.

51:18.000 --> 51:24.000
The developer is basically saying, you know, they're working with Microsoft to help streamline the process of certification.

51:24.000 --> 51:29.000
Because certification takes quite a long time with Microsoft.

51:29.000 --> 51:38.000
And because games like, you know, free-to-play World of Tanks needs some frequent updates to be able to push that through Microsoft,

51:38.000 --> 51:46.000
it's very difficult to kind of get one of those games to work on the Xbox 360.

51:46.000 --> 51:58.000
So right now they're working out, I guess, what they need to fix on Microsoft's end to kind of help alleviate some of that problem with the certification process.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
So hopefully it'll get better.

52:00.000 --> 52:10.000
Hopefully, you know, this, by the time we get to November, I'm assuming it's November when this console is going to launch, you know, that all this stuff will be ironed out.

52:10.000 --> 52:18.000
You know, and everything with, you know, self-publishing and all that stuff, it'll be a lot easier to get your game on there and keep it updated.

52:19.000 --> 52:30.000
It sounds like a lot of this crap that Microsoft's had to go through is really going to make them a better, you know, company when it comes to gaming with all these things that they've had to kind of change, one of them being the certification process.

52:30.000 --> 52:44.000
Yeah, I wonder, like, I mean, I don't know if it's just a coincidence in timing or whatever, but, you know, the departure, you know, Don Mattrick there, if he was holding all this stuff back, I mean, it's like, hey, we're fixing a lot of problems, but I think it's just coincidence, you know.

52:44.000 --> 53:02.000
You know the next thing they need to fix, and maybe this is a little bit pie-in-the-sky dreaming, but the whole, like, no cross-platform play issue, you know, because they let it go by with Final Fantasy XI, but they won't do it with Final Fantasy XIV, and I'm sure there's a host of other games that would like to, maybe Defiance or, you know, things that would like to be cross-platform.

53:02.000 --> 53:07.000
Honestly, I would like the ability to be able to play my game system without Kinect being attached.

53:07.000 --> 53:20.000
Not to say that, you know, you can't have Kinect features in your game, because obviously you can still program your game with, you know, Kinect features being in there, because you know every system is going to have a Kinect.

53:20.000 --> 53:32.000
But say I don't want to play with the Kinect on there, it just disables those features instead of not working, you know, and if it is a Kinect-required game, sorry, this game requires Kinect, please plug in Kinect to play this game.

53:33.000 --> 53:42.000
Why is that so hard? I don't understand, why is it so hard? Is it because the NSA doesn't want you not having that microphone and camera on there all the time?

53:42.000 --> 53:52.000
Speaking of which, I just thought this was kind of funny, and ironic and totally off-topic, but my wife is watching the series Scandal, and they actually had an episode-

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
Yay, I told her she should watch that, she like it?

53:55.000 --> 54:02.000
Yeah, she likes it, but here's the thing, on season two they actually had an episode where it was all of the same stuff that's going on right now.

54:02.000 --> 54:08.000
They had like, this NSA had this device, you know, to be able to spy on everybody using webcams and stuff like that.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Dude, this is like way before all this stuff happened.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
That's the whole arc of the second season, yeah I know, it's funny.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
This is like so hilarious.

54:14.000 --> 54:20.000
Scandal's a hella good show, huh? It's total trash, but it's like one of those shows where it's like,

54:20.000 --> 54:28.000
sometimes you want to watch like a good show, you know like a good drama show, that's why people watch Game of Thrones or Orange is the New Black or something right?

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
I used to watch Matlock for that.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
But sometimes you want to just watch like crap.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
And like Scandal's a great show.

54:34.000 --> 54:40.000
I don't think it's that bad, I mean it's not a terrible show, but yeah it's a little ridiculous in their plot.

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
Okay, okay.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
I can't watch a show I have to turn off my brain for.

54:43.000 --> 54:53.000
It's about like Loki, she's banging the President of the United States on the side, like that's a little bit like trashy romance novel, you know?

54:53.000 --> 55:03.000
But it's not as, okay, coming from the fact that this show is created by the people that did, you know, Grey's Anatomy, they've toned it way down.

55:03.000 --> 55:09.000
I mean, they've toned it way, way down, so you know, I'll give them props for that.

55:09.000 --> 55:16.000
That actress is so good though, she just commands the screen, Kerry Washington, she just commands the screen, she's so fun to watch.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
Games.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
Sorry.

55:18.000 --> 55:23.000
Well now they want to talk TV in chat, because act-def says Orange is the New Black is awesome.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
I'm about three episodes in, it's pretty good.

55:25.000 --> 55:32.000
No, I'm disappointed they got rid of it, because all these shows I'm catching on Netflix and stuff.

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
Better off Ted was actually great, I just don't understand why that show got cancelled.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
No, we watched it.

55:37.000 --> 55:41.000
It's too bad, it was great. I just, that's sad.

55:41.000 --> 55:46.000
Shadow Next Chat in our chat says, everyone at OLR should check out the show Suits on USA Network.

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
The show is really well written and the cast plays off each other really well.

55:49.000 --> 55:55.000
I have not seen that, but the show on USA that everybody tells me I need to watch is Psych.

55:55.000 --> 56:01.000
Because that's the one that does all the tribute shows, like they did the Twin Peaks episode and the Clue episode, and they do all, yeah, that's the one I need to see.

56:01.000 --> 56:06.000
There's only one show going to be coming out that I care about, I don't even know the name of it, but Seth Green's in it.

56:06.000 --> 56:09.000
I am going to bring back, bring this back to games real quick here.

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
Alright, probably a good idea.

56:10.000 --> 56:15.000
I did see an advertisement today on Nickelodeon, my son was watching Spongebob.

56:15.000 --> 56:22.000
Next Saturday they're going to be launching the show for the Rabbids, the animated series, so that'll be coming next Saturday.

56:22.000 --> 56:23.000
Somebody would be interested to check out it.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
You let your son watch Spongebob?

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Only at my, only at my mom's house.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
Okay.

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
Alright, well let's move on. Speaking of kids, let's talk Nintendo.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Ah, bad transition, bad transition.

56:35.000 --> 56:41.000
Alright, look, this is, I honestly file this a little more in fan wank and people dreaming of what could happen.

56:41.000 --> 56:48.000
This is a huge leap of faith, but I will bring it up anyway since we're about discussing the news, not necessarily reporting it.

56:48.000 --> 56:53.000
But apparently we heard about the problems that Atlus' parent company was having, right?

56:54.000 --> 57:01.000
So there's this rumor out there that because there's going to be some subsidiary auctions going on on July 28th,

57:01.000 --> 57:12.000
Atlus is one of those subsidiaries up for sale and Nintendo could be a key player in that because apparently there's already some financial liability in that whole situation.

57:13.000 --> 57:24.000
So could Nintendo end up buying Atlus, which would mean that's a development company for them that could end up meaning Persona ends up being a Wii U exclusive,

57:24.000 --> 57:29.000
Shin Megami Tensei ends up being a Wii and 3DS, Wii U exclusive and 3DS and so on.

57:29.000 --> 57:33.000
Here's the quote from the International Digital Times, take it or leave it.

57:43.000 --> 57:49.000
That's because Nintendo has been working unusually closely with Atlus lately, treating them practically like an in-house studio.

57:49.000 --> 57:54.000
That may be because Atlus is about to become one. Again, that's from the International Digital Times.

57:54.000 --> 57:59.000
No, and here's why. Because they've worked with other studios before on different things.

57:59.000 --> 58:08.000
Like for example, and I think this is all coming from, first off there's the crossover game, the Shin Megami Tensei Fire Emblem game that's coming out on 3DS.

58:09.000 --> 58:19.000
Now remember, they did something very similar back last year with Koei where they had the, I can't remember which game, it was a Koei game.

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
Was it the Romance of the Three Kingdoms?

58:20.000 --> 58:24.000
The Romance of the Three Kingdoms cross Pokemon game or something like that. I think that's what it was.

58:24.000 --> 58:33.000
And so they have that come out last year. So because they're working with them on that, I don't think that's necessarily a reason.

58:33.000 --> 58:42.000
And just because they publish a lot of those games on 3DS and stuff, I don't think that's necessarily a reason that they're going to purchase that company.

58:42.000 --> 58:49.000
Honestly, I think it's just going to get purchased by somebody else and it'll just continue kind of the way Atlus is going.

58:49.000 --> 58:58.000
Maybe Marvelous USA or something like that will purchase Index Media, because that's kind of all the wheelhouse there.

58:58.000 --> 59:07.000
Here's the weird thing though, today is July 28th, so it should be July 29th over in Japan. We haven't really heard what's come of this yet.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
So it's a little...

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
It's also morning.

59:09.000 --> 59:17.000
I guess that's true. But still, it was supposed to happen on July 28th, so I'm not sure why we haven't seen a fondant looking at news.

59:17.000 --> 59:25.000
I just don't see Nintendo purchasing anybody because they already have enough, it wouldn't really change anything.

59:25.000 --> 59:34.000
All they would be doing is kind of... I guess you would be able to get their games out a little wider audience, but they're already developing games on their platforms pretty much exclusively.

59:34.000 --> 59:47.000
If Nintendo is really pushing more indie, as we're going to talk about later in the show, I think a company that makes a lot of really niche but very cultish type of games like Atlus does,

59:47.000 --> 59:54.000
I think would be a really good partner for Nintendo to have. And Atlus still puts stuff out on Playstation platforms all the time, like Disgaea and all that.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
What are you talking about? They don't just do Nintendo stuff.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000
But the vast majority is on the 3DS.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Still, for it to be exclusive, especially Persona, that's a huge one right there. If that series takes a leap over to Nintendo exclusive, that's a big thing.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:18.000
I am kind of the mindset that I think most people that play Persona, and again, I am totally generalizing here and might be wrong, fine.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:25.000
I think most people that play Persona are the type that probably collect a lot of video game systems anyway and already have a Wii U.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.000
But I am kind of making a big assumption.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Well how about the reverse? We collect a lot of systems and I haven't played a single Persona game.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Maybe now you'll have a reason to, who knows?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
No, because I don't have a Wii U.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Not yet.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Probably won't get one.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Not ever? Mario Kart 8 won't sway you?

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I was never a big Mario Kart fan.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
The Mario game at the end of the year won't sway you? There'll be something.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:57.000
But I would not be surprised, Shin Megami Tensei characters in the next Smash Bros. game would not be surprised.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:03.000
We just haven't been really excited. I mean, if something, like, I didn't get a 3DS until Animal Crossing came out.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
And what if I've been playing a crap load of Animal Crossing?

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
There'll be that one game that gets you over it.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
There might be.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Animal Crossing Wii U, it'll happen eventually.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
I'm having more fun playing it portable. But I mean,

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Wait.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:21.000
But I mean, I'm honestly, I'm not really too excited about anything Nintendo's doing yet.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
So.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Alright. ZZZ in our chatroom at live.voguenetwork.com says,

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
If Nintendo bought Atlus, I would put an Evoker to my head IRL.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Now, now, now. No need for that.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
No need for that.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Let's not go to extremes here.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at voguenetwork.com,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
use the passphrase, city.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us before we get to release dates?

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Well, a whole crap load of indie developers are coming together to be a supergroup.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
No, I'm kidding.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
They're making a game.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000
It's called Experiment 12.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
And so these are 12 different developers.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Included, there's Terry Cavanaugh, who did VVVVVVV in Super Hexagon.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Ian Snyder, Jack King Spooner, Zarathustra, Richard Perrin, Michael Brau.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Yeah, just a bunch of people on the list.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:23.000
It's supposed to be kind of an interesting game associated with mental illness.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
But who knows what's going to happen.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
We've only got a few screen caps out so far.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000
It's so far only on PC, but they're considering a Mac version.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000
So, interesting.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000
But I think it's a supergroup along the lines of Damn Yankees.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000
You know, they're going to get Ted Nugent to come out and play guitar.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.000
That is the weirdest comparison you've ever made on this program.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Congratulations.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Well, I look forward to seeing what these guys come up with.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Ted Nugent, man? No.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Talk about crazy.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
and games that will be coming a little bit sooner than this experiment.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
There's not a whole ton of stuff coming out this week.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Pretty much, you know, we've got the collector's edition of Terraria

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000
coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
That's kind of a big deal.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Yeah, it's just the game with, like, they have a pick-shaped USB drive

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
and there's some Vellum stickers and stuff.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
The actual PlayStation 3 version is on, it's a card to download the game.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
The 360 one, though, they put it on disk like Minecraft, so that's kind of cool.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Rise of the Triad this week on PC.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I'm actually looking forward to that.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Is that like the remake?

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
That's the remake, yeah.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
That's going to be coming out, so that'll be pretty sweet.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:48.000
On PlayStation 3, a game which I noticed you still haven't reviewed

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
or probably played yet, Arkania The Complete Tale is coming out this week.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Yeah, I got to get my review done this week.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
So that's coming out.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000
And then, um, I think honestly that's it.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
And I will have you know I have opened that case.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
All right, I was just saying, yeah.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
All right, no, I look forward to that on vognetwork.com soon.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Meanwhile, let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases over there.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000
August 1st on the PlayStation 3, we'll see the release of Killer Is Dead,

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
the premium edition.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Metro Last Like, it's a Japanese release this week as well on August 1st.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:34.000
And Sengoku Hime 2, Okihaku Kakusei Mishidaiga in Limited and Regular editions comes out this week.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
And I was just checking out what kind of game that is.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000
It looks like it's a strategy game featuring cute little anime girls.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:47.000
And moving on to the Xbox 360 to see if we have anything there in Japan this week.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000
We have Killer Is Dead and Metro Last Like both over there as well.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Checking out some of the other consoles like PlayStation Vita.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000
PlayStation Vita has Mind Zero out this week on the Vita.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:12.000
And on the 3DS this week we have Doki Doki Precure, Nari Kiri Life, and Osahare Na Koinu 3D come out this week.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Puppies!

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:18.000
And lastly on the Wii U, nothing till the 8th.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
I think that was a game about puppies.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Actually, I gotta say the Wii U list looks really bare for August.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:30.000
I hate to say it, maybe some games aren't dated yet, but the only other game for August is Wonderful 101.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Okay. Alright, that does it for Japanese releases. Let's check out the UK.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Only a bare few.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
On, what's today again?

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
28th.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Yeah, on the 20th, actually only on the 31st, we have Pixel Junk Monsters Ultimate HD and I didn't see anything for the beginning of August, so...

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Nada.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:59.000
I forgot to mention, since it is kind of next Sunday, on the 4th, I believe Pikmin 3 is coming out, so that will be something.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Yes.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
There's that whole early release, though.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Yeah.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Yeah.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Keep in mind, Shadow Next Gen, those were Japanese releases and I didn't see that on the list.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Maybe that was the game that was the 8th of August, so...

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000
And those of you in chat that are saying Pikmin 3 is in August, again, those were Japanese releases I was reading.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Alright, let's go to a couple more stories and the classic game of the week, Loki.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Alright, so, I mean, even we've kind of seen this a little bit, or this isn't shocking news, but even with just like our small group of gamers here,

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:44.000
a lot of people have moved away from World of Warcraft to other things, and Activision Blizzard has obviously seen something very similar.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Their subscriber base has shrunk to 7.7 million users, which is still not a bad number, and that's down from 8.3 million users,

01:06:53.000 --> 01:07:00.000
so they lost 600,000 people over the second quarter of this year.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:07.000
And what are they doing to, I don't know, combat that?

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
No one likes pandas.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Nothing. Basically, so far they're not really saying anything. Their comment is, despite the shrinking subscriber base, you know, Activision Blizzard notes that World of Warcraft remains the number one subscription-based MMORPG.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Well, your competition in that field is very limited because the reason why they're losing players, it's free-to-play games.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Those people are going, like, I did not touch WoW this week. Not once.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:45.000
And it's because I was, you know, playing other games like Dota 2, and these free-to-play games, I think, are really where WoW is hurting.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Warcraft is backed into a corner, I think they're going to need to go free-to-play.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:54.000
I don't know how long Final Fantasy XIV is going to be able to get away with a subscription model, to be honest.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
If World of Warcraft goes free-to-play, Final Fantasy XIV will...

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Final Fantasy XIV is going to be backed into at least the buy-to-play, like Guild Wars model, it's going to have to.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000
That's acceptable. I'd probably play it if that was the case.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I don't know, though, they really talk about a lot, a lot of content for Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn, I mean, we'll see, but the problem with...

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Warcraft is really just in this stagnant place right now, and, you know, I don't know what to say.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000
It's like they do keep trying to put out these new patches and things.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Do you think they're going to do, like, a new, like, a graphical overhaul of the whole game?

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:36.000
I think one of the two big things is coming with the next expansion at BlizzCon, and it's either going to be giant graphical overhaul to modernize the game.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Although, I don't know if they would want to cut out all these, you know, part of WoW's allure is that it runs on old systems.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
But they do bump up the specs little by little each time.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Well, they could just have that as an option, you know, not necessarily...

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Perhaps, perhaps. So, I believe that will either come out, or it's going to be free-to-play, but Warcraft's kind of backed into a corner at this point.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000
It's going to be one or the other.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:04.000
I've already quit ages ago, because, I mean, I played through the panda stuff, and then it wasn't fun.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.000
It just was more, it was the same reason I was quitting before, because I just kept getting bored.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:20.000
I also shouldn't say it's going to go, necessarily, because, like, you know, if World of Warcraft had 100,000 subscribers, it's still making some pretty good money.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000
I mean, it wouldn't be a very pleasant place, but they'd still be making money.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
But, you know, Blizzard is going to get people in in other ways.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Hearthstone, you know, is a free-to-play game. That's going to bring in some cash for them.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000
The Blizzard All-Stars thing they're working on, that's going to be a free-to-play game.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
That's going to bring in some cash for them.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.000
We don't know what the hell Titan's all about, but then again, that's not really going to be out at least until 2016 at this point.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.000
SSG100Matt speculates that the graphic overhaul will be Titan.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:53.000
You know, there is some buzz that Titan is World of Warcraft 2, but I don't know how much stock I put into that.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
It's so far away that it probably doesn't even matter that way.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:01.000
I sort of think EverQuest 2 and EverQuest kind of showed you really shouldn't do that to your MMO.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
But yet, we have Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIV.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Yeah, Final Fantasy XI is pretty much... meh.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Well, it has its fans that have stuck with it this long that'll keep with it. Who knows?

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Well, hey, now that I'm working, I'm going to be playing XIV, so I've pretty much decided on that.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Good times.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
And XI needs to go free-to-play.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
We'll see.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Alright, anyhow, one more story for you guys before the Classic Game of the Week.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Excuse me, and it's about the cancellation of Mega Man Legends 3.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Aww.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000
It was about two years ago that Mega Man Legends 3 was cancelled.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
We never really got the reasons why this game was cancelled,

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:45.000
but there was an interesting kind of report that came out this week about Gregaman, who's with Capcom Unity,

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.000
talking about a recap of things we've already expressed in one form or another.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.000
So sort of a, I don't know, maybe like a post-mortem now all this time later about why the game was cancelled.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Remember that Legends 3 was essentially a ten-year late sequel to a sequel to a spin-off

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:09.000
that had middling success even back when it was one of the only games of its kind,

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:14.000
before 3D action-adventure was an established genre, if you can even remember that far back.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
And consider its place within the greater Mega Man brand.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000
If you thought DMC was a deviation from the Devil May Cry brand,

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000
remember that MML changed virtually everything you could possibly change about Mega Man.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Even I remember scoffing at the sight of it until I got my hands on it and realized it stood on its own.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Merits.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Then consider that the game was designed for a platform that didn't even exist yet in the wild.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.000
All that isn't to say that MML 3 was a bad project, it was just weird.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.000
But MML has always been a passion project, not a cash cow, hence the Dev Room angle.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000
And there is a little YouTube that showed a little bit of play from the game that's out there,

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:57.000
but they go on to talk about involvement in the community and so forth.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:04.000
At the same time though, they're putting out risks for different things.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.000
They're rebooting Strider, they made the Bionic Commando game, stuff like that.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:14.000
And in saying that it's completely different than the other Mega Man games,

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
well, every Mega Man series is different than the other Mega Man games.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Okay, so it wasn't a 2D platformer game.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
So what, Zelda?

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000
The 3D Zeldas weren't 2D platformer games anymore?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Are you saying that wasn't worth the risk?

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Or Wind Waker is completely different than all the other games?

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Yet we're getting the re-release of that because apparently it just sucked so bad that we're just going to re-release it again, right?

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
It's not because people liked it or anything.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.000
I don't understand. Wasn't this whole trial version of Mega Man Legends 3 that they were going to put on the eShop for five bucks?

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Wasn't this practically done before they pulled the rug on it?

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Pretty much, and I thought the whole thing was just to gauge interest in that stuff.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
So release it. It doesn't make sense. I don't know.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Make a download. Just make a download only.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
That was the plan for the prototype thing they were going to do.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000
They were basically going to do a paid demo to see if people were interested in the game.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Give it to some fanboys and let them finish the last steps.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
That's what they do now for everything on their stuff. Remember all the, what was it?

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Dead Rising Zero stuff where it's a prequel but it's really just a demo.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000
It's disappointing.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Alright, let's travel back to a time when things were a little simpler.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Maybe because we didn't have the internet or anything like that, we didn't get disappointed when games suddenly got cancelled.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Although they might show up in a Nintendo Power and then suddenly disappear.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Or in this case, a Genesis Power. Or who knows. Or a Sega Master System Power.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Fantasy Star! Weee, which I can't believe I haven't done this one yet.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
And I can't believe you haven't done it either. You kind of brought this up earlier in the show, didn't you?

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:58.000
I did because Dan's playing the Sega Ages Generation 1, which is Fantasy Star.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:06.000
We bought these back when the Sega Ages ones came out, except it was all in Japanese and our friend was trying to translate while we were playing.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:12.000
And she's like, oh well this part isn't important, you don't need to know what they said. So we're like okay, we'll stop playing it.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Dan actually, someone has done an English patch. And I linked from the Generations one because the music in it was so good.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:32.000
But the first Fantasy Star came out on the Master System and it came out in Japan on December 20th, 1987 and then in North America and Europe in 1988.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:44.000
It is one of the, I'd say, granddaddies of the RPG genre and it's also one of the first games that had a female protagonist.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:51.000
There have been other versions of it. Fantasy Star Collection came out for Sega Saturn and PS2.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:59.000
And then there's a Game Boy Advance version in North America and a Virtual Console re-release for the Weee in 2009.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:09.000
So basically it's pretty traditional for RPG format. You go over your overworld maps, you talk to people.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Your dungeons though are done sort of a pseudo 3D where you're walking through kind of first person perspective like it's Doom or something.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:27.000
And then it flashes into an over the shoulder view when you're fighting critters and stuff.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:35.000
And they even have little animations which is a lot more than Final Fantasy had at that time.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:41.000
And you get different weapons and magic and you have really memorable characters.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:46.000
You had Alice, you had Meow, who's like this kind of cat thing.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.000
And Odin and Noah, basically those are your main characters through the whole thing.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
You've got your antagonists.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Basically this is one of the, and especially for the Sega fans, this is the game to have.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Thankfully we've got all the Fantasy Star games complete in their boxes.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.000
And trust me, it's something that's just really fun to have.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Now like I said, it did get a re-release through the Sega Ages branding.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:22.000
And I think that the Generation 1 is really good.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:33.000
It's basically just touched up. It maybe looks like an early PS1 RPG, a little bit cleaner maybe.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:39.000
I mean you're taking a game from the Master System and updating everything in it.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:44.000
So it's a very, very good translation. The music's great, the graphics great, really fun to play.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000
And there is an English patch out right now if you've got a PS2 emulator.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Although I can't say go do it, go do it, go do it, because that would be wrong.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:05.000
The game right now, as far as the Master System version, it can go for a lot.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:11.000
When the game first came out, it retailed for $70 and some places sold it for $80.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:17.000
And keep in mind, this was an 8-bit game. So that was a lot of money for an early game.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.000
And other ones that sold more than that were like Time Zone.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000
But Phantasy Star was the most expensive console game ever sold at its time.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:31.000
And it did get a price drop when the Master System 2 hardware came out.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:36.000
It had sequels of course. We had Phantasy Star 2, 3, and 4.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:41.000
If I'm right, I think 3 is the one that's really hard to find.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Of course the other ones came out on the Genesis slash Master System.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:51.000
With the Japanese release, one really neat thing about the first one is that it did take advantage of the FM chip.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:57.000
The Yamaha YM2413 chip. So it had some really good sound.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:02.000
But since the North American and PAL systems didn't have that chip, it doesn't sound quite as good.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000
But on Virtual Console, you get an option of playing it with the FM soundtrack.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:16.000
So this is probably one of the greatest video games of all time. Especially in the RPG genre.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:25.000
And it's actually, as far as its popularity when it came out, it actually went sort of outside video game publications.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
And was even mentioned in like Boy's Life.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:34.000
So, I don't even know if that magazine is out anymore, but wasn't it like one of old camping...

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Wasn't that the Boy Scouts magazine or something?

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000
I thought so.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Yeah, I think it was. I think I used to get it when I was in Cub Scouts.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:49.000
But I mean, seriously, if none of you have... I'll be honest, I didn't play it when it came out.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:56.000
I played it as an adult. But even me coming into it as an adult, I still enjoyed it.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
So it's one that anyone can pick up if you love RPGs.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:13.000
And I also, being a fan of Phantasy Star Online, it's sort of neat seeing how some of the graphics in the updated version actually correspond to some of the updates in the Phantasy Star Online series.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000
So it's pretty neat.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Kind of seeing where it all came from.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Yeah, it's like they pulled the original concepts and then with what they're doing for Phantasy Star Online, they're sort of merging the two.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Sort of bringing one up to date. A little bit slightly different, but they have lots in common stylistically.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
So, that's it, Phantasy Star.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Alright, there it is, your Classic Game of the Week Phantasy Star for the Sega Master System.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Although, certainly the Sega Ages series on PlayStation 2 is a big part of that as well.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Yeah, and like I said, it has been translated however you want to play it.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Alright, or watch people play it on YouTube like we've been doing here in the studio.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Alright.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
How much Mercedes do you have on you, Rob?

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Umm, 50 bucks maybe?

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000
I had to laugh because Dan actually called me when I was in the back room last night saying,

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:04.000
I finally got to the Rappies! Come look at them!

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000
I was like, I'm watching Dan kill Rappies because I hate Rappies.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Good times.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Yeah, it's interesting how much of that, you know, playing Phantasy Star Online as much as I did,

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
it's interesting kind of going back to the Phantasy Star games and seeing like,

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000
where the Monomates and the Telepipes and all that come from.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
And yes, the Rappies too, you know?

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000
I have to tell you a story about Julie.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Okay.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000
You know which Julie I'm talking about.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Of course, yeah.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Julie paid $120 to order a Rappy plushie.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Oh wow.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
That's as big as my upper torso.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
That's dedication.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Probably almost as wide as your table.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
I have a gigantic Pikachu.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Okay, take your Pikachu and make the Rappy a little bit bigger than that.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Yeah.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000
And fully stuffed in, you know, with the bits and everything.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
That's because she was that much into PSO at the time.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
That sounds adorable.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
That sounds like a waste of money.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Judge, judge, judge.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000
We all do silly things.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Alright.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000
I would have just made one.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
We're going to take a break, guys, when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
some rapid fire news.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Of course, the mailbag, what little may be in there.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
And we'll talk a little bit of Ouya.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.000
And take your calls as well if we have some folks who want to call tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:17.000
But all that when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening,

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:33.000
July the 28th, 2013, with the 514th episode of our show.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
We're going to get back into some news here in a moment.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
I just want to make sure I got a clear plug out here.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
I mentioned this in the beginning of the show,

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:44.000
but I just want to make sure I got a plug out here to my buddies over at Game Buoy Podcast.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
That's gamebuoy.org.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Just think Game Boy, but B-U-O-Y.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Gamebuoy.org.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.000
I'm going to be on episode 33, part B of their show.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000
The episode was so long, they split it up into two parts.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.000
But I'll be on the part B, which was like almost three hours in itself.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000
We talked all about music games tonight was the topic.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
So, or I should say today, music games was the topic.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000
So, you know, just having done the early days of OLR,

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
we were nothing but music game chat.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000
I had a lot to talk about, hence why the show was so damn long.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000
But it was a really good time. We had a lot of fun taping it.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
So be sure to check that out over at gamebuoy.org.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Episode 33B I will be on.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
First Mate Slidekick should have that posted on Monday.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000
It's not up there yet, although it is a fantabulous show.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
You can go check out their old episodes.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Alright, let's get back into some rapid fire news.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Loki.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Alright, so let's talk a little bit about old games.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000
For example, Star Control.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Star Control was one of the franchises that was being auctioned off

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:52.000
as part of this whole Atari catalog auction thing.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000
And Star Control is actually one of my favorite PC games.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:01.000
It was an old strategy game that you play like a bunch of different spaceships.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000
And there is a really good one-on-one space combat portion of the game.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.000
And now it's hopefully coming back.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:14.000
And this is partly due to Stardock buying the franchise rights.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.000
And so now they're planning on hopefully rebooting that franchise.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
So that's pretty sweet.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Some of the other franchises that were sold off and that were purchased.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Or I should say, yeah, bidding.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
So we had Rebellion.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000
They've picked up the Battlezone franchise.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Wargaming has picked up Total Annihilation, which is not too surprising.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
They also picked up Master of Orion.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And Rebellion also picking up Moonbase Commander.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Epic geared the Backyard Sports franchise, which was terrible.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
And then Tomo picked up a bunch of random stuff,

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000
because they produced a lot of weird DS titles.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Like Humongous franchise.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Fatty Bear's Birthday Surprise and Math Grand Prix.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Wait, Fatty Bear's Birthday Surprise?

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Fatty Bear's Birthday Surprise.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I'm assuming these are all educational PC titles at some time.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.000
What exactly would Fatty Bear get as a birthday surprise?

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Of course, a fatty.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Some honey.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
A rice cake.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Fatty Bear. He gets cholesterol.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Oh, Loki, you could appreciate this.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Tangent time. Choo choo, tangent time.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Okay, so, Alan and I went to the State Fair on Friday.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000
And you know they've got deep fried food like crazy.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Yeah.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Act surprised, act surprised.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Alright.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
So there's a booth there.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Oh my god!

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
That has all these deep fried foods, right?

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Now what I really want to try is the deep fried coke.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
They don't have that here at this booth.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
How do you deep fry a coke? Is it like a can that's breaded?

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000
No, it's like syrup and they make little syrup balls out of it.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000
But anyway, so we're trying to decide. What do we get?

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Do we get a deep fried peanut butter cup?

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Do we get a deep fried Twinkie?

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Uh oh, Alan's here.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:07.000
So we narrow it down to, we either get deep fried cheesecake,

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
deep fried red velvet,

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.000
but we settled on deep fried Oreos.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000
And Alan, do you want to talk about how they tasted?

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.000
They were really good, but at the same time it's almost too much.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000
I'm at that age where I'm like, okay, it's not disgusting,

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
but like I only just wanted one or two.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
And you made me, you made me three of them out of the four.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Because I only wanted one because I'm like, my stomach already feels gross.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
I don't want, if I eat more than one,

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000
then we're not going to be leaving here for an hour while I'm in the porta potti.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000
But there's so much batter that they're actually kind of plum sized

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
because there's so much dough around the cookie and then you bite into it

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000
and the cookie actually isn't crunchy. It's all warm and gooey inside.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Yeah. So it was delicious. Have you had deep fried Oreos, Loki?

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:59.000
No, but I'm very disappointed that you didn't talk about the booth dedicated to bacon.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
They had a whole bacon booth.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
We didn't find the bacon dedicated booth.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
We saw like the chocolate covered bacon

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.000
and we saw the bacon maple something, something.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
No, they had a whole booth that was dedicated to bacon there.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Oh, we missed that.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000
I didn't go.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000
I don't see how you could have missed that.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000
I mean, there should have been mile, you know, mile long lines going to that booth.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.000
No, it was empty. We went Friday morning, like first day off work.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Yeah, no one's the same for anymore.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000
We went like first thing. But anyway, so, uh,

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000
I guess Fatty Bear would want some deep fried Oreos. I don't know.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000
They had deep fried bacon there.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.000
So fried Coke is when they take a funnel cake batter

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.000
and they put Coke syrup in it until it turns brown inside of Coke flavored.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.000
They drizzle it into the hot grease so that it looks like a funnel cake.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
It's all just, you know, the little ropes of dough.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000
And then they put that in a cup and they sprinkle powdered sugar on it.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000
And then they put more pure Coke syrup on top of that.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000
And that's fried Coke. And then fried Kool-Aid is pretty much the same thing.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000
They put Kool-Aid in the dough or in the batter,

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.000
and then they put Torani strawberry syrup on it.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.000
I remember when we did fried Twinkies at, um,

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000
I do. That was like, that was like our sideshow at, um, it w it wasn't,

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.000
it was a shaft Sacramento hosts another fabulous tournament.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Yeah. We had fried Twinkies for no reason.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.000
I made it through half of one.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000
I know they're so right. Anyway. Um, let's see.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000
I just want to go to our chat room at live.vogniteware.com

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.000
because we have a ionotropic says Loki wants deep fried gummy bears,

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
three pound bag version.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Why would you want that? By the way, I saw a tweet from you.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:36.000
That was like my stomach so full. I was like, why do I keep eating these things?

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000
They're still eating them as I'm posting it. Delicious. Uh, yeah.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000
So basically, um, yeah, it took me two days to get through that three pound bag.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Um, yeah, actually I wouldn't want deep fried.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000
It would just dissolve into mush because it would, you know,

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
would liquefy some weird stuff.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Like this one booth had like 20 different things.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.000
There were deep fried pop tarts and I was like, that's already bready.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Like why would you just want to put more dough on that deep fried?

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Did they have deep fried fruity pebbles, deep fried fruity pebbles?

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000
And then I think deep fried cocoa puffs and captain crunch. Yeah.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Like different cereal. Yeah. Fruity pebbles might've been all right.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000
See that's something more of your bread it with that, you know? All right.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Anyway, I'm just going to tell you right now that all of that sounds really disgusting.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000
What gave me the fatty bear? Here's the one that was discussing.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000
I remember what they called it,

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
but it was as a deep fried Twinkie with some sort of cheese on it.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I think it was either cheese whiz or like some sort of nacho cheese wrapped in bacon.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Or, you know, it was as a Twinkie wrapped in bacon with cheese and then deep fried.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000
I'm having a heart attack listening to you. Stop.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Spray cheese is always automatically disgusting. I'm sorry.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000
True lifestyle. It's easy. Cheese is gross.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000
When it says cheese food on the label, you know, that's what cheese eats.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
All right. Anyhow, back to video game news.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Thank you, Alan, for bringing a little fatty bear to our show.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.000
I didn't mean that in a negative way. Where are you going?

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.000
All right. Moving on. Sorry, Logie.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000
All right. OK, so beyond those.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.000
So Nintendo getting actually a little bit of love.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Activision has been back and forth. Is Call of Duty Ghost coming to the Wii or not?

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:20.000
And it is. So it will be coming out November 5th along the other platforms.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:25.000
And, yeah. And Treyarch will be doing the port on that.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.000
So not a big surprise there because they do all the Wii ports and Wii U ports now, I guess.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:36.000
And last but not least, they're already talking about the DLC plan for Saints Row IV,

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.000
which doesn't sound like much as far as like content stuff.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.000
The first piece of DLC is going to be the Enter the Dominatrix.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Now you may be thinking, hey, wait a second. Didn't Enter the Dominatrix become Saints Row IV?

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
I mean, they kind of expanded upon it.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Well, it's not necessarily going to be...

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.000
That's kind of all the stuff they cut out of the game.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Stuff that they couldn't really work in there.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Now there's going to be some sort of mockumentary take on like all the things that they couldn't do for the game,

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000
but they're going to put in there anyways.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.000
I did watch some interesting interviews.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.000
They were talking about how they kind of pulled a Bethesda a little bit, you know, where they gave the...

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:21.000
You remember the Skyrim team had, you know, a week to develop whatever they wanted for the game.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.000
And so Saints Row, they did the same thing in Volition.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000
They had all sorts of things like a dragon that breathed fire that you would have been able to ride

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.000
was one of the things that, you know, they were going to try to do.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.000
But it just didn't work in the game, you know, some of the limitations and stuff.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.000
So I hope some of that stuff becomes DLC. That would be pretty cool.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:45.000
But they do have a season pass that they announced that's only two pieces of DLC and it's $10.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000
That once again, as we were talking about before in part A, that's a bundle.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.000
That's not a season pass as a bundle of DLC because it's two.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
The season pass is not two things.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
So I guess I'll have to buy it because it's only two.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:04.000
A season pass would be they give you these two things and then you've paid for the other stuff that comes out that season.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Well, I have a feeling there's going to be a ton of customization DLC like they've had before.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
It's all paid unlock stuff.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.000
But I'm sure they're going to have that available.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.000
That's how they did Saints Row the Third.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Alright. Well, moving on to some other stories in gaming real quick here.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Connect Sports Rivals, that was one of those games that was announced for Xbox One at E3.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000
It has been confirmed that it will miss the launch window.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Originally this game was going to come out in November.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:43.000
However, Microsoft told Polygon that there is a delay and it is necessary in order to give Rare enough time to polish it up before launch.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
So it just wasn't ready to go.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Spring of next year, the new time frame that's being given for that.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000
These things happen all of the time. Launch games get pushed back.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Wasn't Pikmin 3 supposed to be a launch game for the Wii U?

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:57.000
And now it's just now coming out? These things happen.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
You know what? Take the time to get it right.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Even though this game doesn't really sound like one I'm really interested in anyway.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000
And so it might be interesting for other people. It's one of those family games.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Yeah, it's a family game, kiddie game.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Families aren't going to be picking up Dead Rising 3 for their little kids.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000
True, very true.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Are you kidding? I would totally play that when I was a kid.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Hopefully this delay won't cause people to go over to the Wii U.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Or, well, depending on how you look at it.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Maybe this delay will, yay, make people go over to the Wii U.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000
However you're looking at it.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:30.000
But the Wii U is looking at possibly a Legend of Zelda Wind Waker HD bundle.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000
I can see it.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.000
This is a report from an inventory system at a major US retailer.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
We don't know which one so take this with a big grain of salt.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.000
And these stories are often a little eh.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Unless Loki of course is the one reporting on it because I trust him.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.000
But Nintendo is looking at a Wii U bundle for Legend of Zelda Wind Waker HD.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Supposedly a 3DS handheld that comes with Pokemon X and Pokemon Y as well.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Although aren't there those limited edition 3DSs with Pokemon with the art on them?

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000
I know those are coming out in Japan.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:59.000
So it would seem very logical those come out here too.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Those might come out over here.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.000
We're supposed to be getting that 3DS, the black 3DS XL next month.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000
The one that was rumored to be coming out over here is actually coming over here next month.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:13.000
And surprisingly enough, actually, Zelda is coming out a lot earlier than I thought it would be.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Because I pegged that as like a November title.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.000
But they said it was October and it's actually the first week of October.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Well yeah, I was going to say October is when these games are launching.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
So you could bet that this bundle will come out at the same time.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.000
First week of October for that and third or fourth for Wii Party U.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Which no one gives a shit about.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Hey, you never know.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.000
There might be that one fan.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:37.000
And then there's probably, I'm assuming November is going to be the 3DS XL then.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Or Super Mario World 3D.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Now this is really interesting.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Disney is looking into a new technology called Aireal.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
It's A-I-R-E-A-L.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Not to be confused with like a trick or a Disney princess that lives under the sea.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Aireal is a new invention that blows air that's supposed to simulate a tactile experience.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000
So in other words, you're supposed to be able to feel objects.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Where there might not necessarily be one because of the way the air goes.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:16.000
It was created by PhD student Rajinidhar Sadi and a Disney researcher Ivan Popryev.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000
It can be placed on a TV or even on an iPad.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:26.000
And it can actually simulate buttons to touching in mid-air to making you feel like water, stone, sand.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
This could actually be something really cool.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.000
You know, my mind always goes to Disney theme parks and how could that make rides feel.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
That might be really cool.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
I just don't understand how that would work.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:42.000
The tech is in a very early phase, so no word on where this is going.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.000
But they have a YouTube app if you want to see more about it.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000
So, there you go.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000
So, can you write over there?

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.000
I hate Destructoid for iPad.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Oh yeah.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Hate. It brings up an ad and then it shuts down my safari.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Oh.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.000
So, I'm on spite. Don't want to read that story.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Which one was it?

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
The Zelda mod.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
I can mention it real quick here.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:15.000
So, Jamie out of spite will not be telling you about this Legend of Zelda mod.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
It's got a great trailer, by the way.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Does it?

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Yeah, it's a fantastic trailer.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Lissy, apparently it's this mod for Zelda. I'm trying to figure out what Zelda game it is.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.000
It's not for Zelda. It's all the different Zelda.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.000
It's almost like all the different Zelda worlds put together.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.000
And it's the medieval Total War.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Oh, so it's the other way around. It's the Zelda hack for medieval Total War.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:48.000
It's really crazy. The trailer they've got giant characters and stuff.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Of course there's an ad on there.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
All I read was carrying around Link's dead corpse.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.000
And I do give the ad credit because I did see the same ad earlier today

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.000
and I did not know Cigarose had a new album coming out.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Yes, it's out now actually.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
They're going on tour again. Ooh, I really need to see them.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
They're a great band.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.000
But anyways, they've got some really crazy stuff as you get into it.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Let me get a little further if it's into it.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
I didn't know who some of the characters were.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
I mean, obviously I know who that is.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:27.000
But they had some of the guy from Majora's Mask or whatever in there.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000
This looks neat.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.000
It looks very, very epic.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Some of it looks a little bad.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
A little derpy, yeah.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Her crying looks a little bad.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Well, I think it's supposed to be like some sort of...

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
But yeah, that thing looks cool. I don't know what that is.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
But I didn't play any of the threes.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000
It kind of makes you want to check out Medieval 2 Total War, doesn't it?

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Yeah, but let's see if this is the one.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Towards the end there, they've got some really cool stuff.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Neat.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Yeah.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Okay, Jamie, there you go.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Thank you, because their page has never worked right on my iPad.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Stop crashing people's iPads, fools.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Your developers seriously need to have their hands slapped.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Just saying.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Destructoid, hire better designers.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Oh, snap. Gauntlet throne.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Anyway, there is a report that a Gran Turismo movie is in development.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:28.000
It's supposed to be produced by, let's see, Michael DeLuca and Dana Brunetti.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:32.000
And they're also the people that are working on Fifty Shades of Shit.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I mean, Grey.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.000
So I don't know how I would think about that.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Whatever.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:46.000
And then, in other news, this is...

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Well, you know, we rag on dating games every so often,

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
but this one is just hilarious.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:59.000
There is an appearance in a dating game by Keiji Inafune.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
It's basically, the game is called Sweet Fuse.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
It's a dating game for the PSP.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.000
And you can seduce one of seven steamy bachelors.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Ooh.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.000
But Inafune is in the game and you can court him.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000
I was right, they have that coming out on PSP over here in the August.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Yeah.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Now that I know what that is, that's even creepier.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:24.000
His portrait here looks creepy.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000
And he's listed as Legendary Creator.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000
So that's it.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Alright, unfortunately there's no FUGL question of the week this week.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.000
I talked about that earlier.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Just thank my busy, hectic schedule.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:41.000
I didn't even get around to thinking about OLR until an hour before we started the show tonight.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:44.000
So that segment will be back in two weeks when we return,

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.000
as we will not be having a show live here next week.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Let's move on though to some more news in the meantime.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Alright, so sales haven't been that great.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
There was an article that was on Gamasutra.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:00.000
And they were talking, or I should say polling some of the developers that have games on there.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:05.000
And they were talking about some of the attach rates and stuff and how not good they are.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:10.000
For example, one of the games, I guess Hidden in Plain Sight,

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:15.000
it's brought in $4,381 on 1,900 purchases.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:18.000
And that was basically sold at a pay-what-you-want price.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:21.000
So, you know, minimum of a dollar.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Also, there was another game, Get on Top.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:32.000
It's earned $728 off of 9,700 downloads and 520 purchases off that.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:39.000
They were saying some of them, like Bomb Squad, which is one of the more popular games,

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.000
he's peaked, I guess, 200 sales per day.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:47.000
And now it's sort of around 70 per day, which is a $5 game.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:57.000
There's a really indie guy who created a game called Bomb Ball who's made a little over $30 a day.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
That's not terrible.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
I mean, for an indie, you know, maybe that's not terrible.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:10.000
And then Tower Fall, which is probably one of the most notable games on the Ouya right now,

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:14.000
he said they've reached about 2,000 sales so far at $15 each.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:18.000
So, you know, $30,000?

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:30.000
But basically, overall, the stats have shown that I want to say that only about 27% of people that have an Ouya

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:35.000
have actually bought games for it, whereas everyone else is just playing kind of free stuff.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:39.000
I want to say it was 27%. It was some ridiculously high number.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Now, are we talking, like, actual free stuff?

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Like, I don't know, the Amazing Frog and the parking valet or No Brakes valet

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.000
and the stuff that's actually free on there, or do you think emulators?

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000
I think it's just that they're playing a lot of the free stuff.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
I don't think that it's necessarily...

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.000
I think that a lot of the developers on there are...

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Yeah, 73% of owners haven't bought a thing.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
So I don't think right now that...

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:11.000
I think that some of the developers that are on there probably have never published a game before.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:17.000
It may not know how much of the game to give away for free.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:22.000
You know, like, there was something... I don't remember which game it was, but they were saying, like,

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:30.000
they had certain difficulty levels that were available, and the higher difficulties were behind a paywall.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Well, it ended up that a lot of people were just comfortable playing at the easy difficulties of that game,

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.000
and so not a lot of people were paying for that.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.000
And so it comes to the point where, well, they could change it.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:47.000
They could put out a new version of the game and change all that, or they just leave it alone and drop the price or something.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:53.000
So I think a lot of it's just experiment and a lot of new people putting stuff on there that, you know,

01:41:53.000 --> 01:42:00.000
they may not be... they may not know all the tricks to being able to bring in revenue on that kind of pay model.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:06.000
You know, it leads us to this interesting comment in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com from our pal Bobby Blackwolf,

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.000
who says, why buy games when you can pirate them so easily?

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Yeah, that's the thing, though, is you can't really pirate Ouya games too easily on there, at least as far as I'm aware.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:24.000
You can pirate all other Android games on there quite easily, but you can't pirate Ouya games themselves very easily, that I've seen.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:30.000
But yeah, because they don't have the Google Play Marketplace tied to this console,

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:36.000
there's nothing to check for the authenticity of, you know, those purchases.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:43.000
So anything that you side load on there, if you happen to download a random API for anything, it will just run it.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Full version or whatever, and it'll just run it without having to purchase it.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:55.000
So yeah, in that sense, it is really easy to pirate games on there, but for the actual Ouya games, it's not, because of the way they have it.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Now, that could very well change if, you know, I don't know what they would have to do to do that,

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:04.000
or if they can even put the Google Play Store on there. I know you can side load that.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.000
But yeah, it's just... it's just tricky.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:14.000
And once again, you know, with other consoles coming out, especially like the Mad Catz one, you know, the Mojo thing,

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:21.000
where it just is Google Play Store, and you just put your games on there, and it works on the TV,

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:26.000
and games that don't support controllers, you can map stuff to it. It just works, and there's plenty of content out there.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
You don't need a specialized marketplace for it.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:35.000
So, why spend the money on an Ouya when you can just spend your money on something else that works a lot better?

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.000
And it's just like a lot of people have taken the Ouya concept and made it better.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:45.000
And that's... unfortunately, there's not really anything. They can't just put out another Ouya right now, you know.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:50.000
It's going to be very interesting to see where the Ouya ends up in about six months, right?

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Yeah.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.000
So, we'll see.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Alright, anyhow, moving on to another news story about a game you're not going to be able to get on the Ouya,

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:00.000
but probably about everywhere else. Disney Infinity.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:04.000
And, you know, Disney Infinity, of course, has Toy Box, which is like the creation mode,

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.000
which, you know, makes me kind of think at first about, like, LittleBigPlanet.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000
I didn't realize, really, how powerful this is until I saw this video.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:17.000
And in this video, somebody basically recreated Super Mario Brothers 1-1.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:23.000
And what's weird to me about this video is that, like, isn't this, like, an official type of, like, trailer or whatever?

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Yeah.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Yeah, well, what's interesting about this is that they actually show, like, there's the little staircase with Buzz Lightyear going to a flagpole,

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:33.000
and it's like, wait a minute! Wait a minute!

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Isn't level 1-1 kind of...

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
It's not similar with LittleBigPlanet 2.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Yeah, I guess that's true. And to be fair, it's just one small component that you see in the video here.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
But still, wow, it looks very powerful.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.000
And are you going to be able to share these across the internet and all that good stuff?

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.000
I'm sure you will be able to.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:50.000
Yes. Yes, you will be able to.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
This is going to be an interesting game. Interesting player.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
I've already seen some of the next characters come out, too.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Oh, yeah? Like what?

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Like, they've got, uh...

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Like, well, they've, I mean, it's not stuff that's new because they've shown them in the trailers already.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.000
But, like, well, perfect example right here.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.000
You know, they're going to have the stuff from Wreck-It Ralph.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:14.000
They're not going to have a Wreck-It Ralph playset, but they're going to have a Wreck-It Ralph.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:20.000
They're going to introduce a new thing. It's like, instead of the playsets, it's a toy box set.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Basically, it's the characters and you get pieces for the toy box instead of, you know, an actual playset.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:31.000
They're going to have a Toy Story 1 coming out, Jack Skellington around the same time.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:39.000
And then, uh, I think in the Toy Story 1, it's Buzz Lightyear and...

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Because I haven't watched Toy Story 2, it's the female cowboy.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Or, I can't remember.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Jessie.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Jessie. So, it's going to be Buzz and Jessie and then Woody sold separately.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:53.000
So, um, it looks fun.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Buzz has Jessie and no Woody.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Yeah, well, it's just, they had to, they always put a female character in there because they want the appeal.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Well, except for the starter pack. It's all males.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:09.000
But, like, for, like, cars and stuff, they have, like, they try to put a female character in there so that girls will buy it, too.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:12.000
You know, so they can play as the girl characters and stuff like that.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Yeah.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:18.000
But, yeah, it looks fun. I mean, it's expensive. I just don't...

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Yeah, it's going to be an expensive hobby.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
I don't want to buy all those characters.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Any word about, like, exclusive figures only at parks or things like that?

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:30.000
I haven't heard of anything yet. I mean, they haven't really said that they're going to do stuff like that.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:34.000
It might come later on, like, next year. I mean, assuming this all takes off.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Um, I know Skylanders does that. They have exclusive characters for Toys R Us and stuff.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:42.000
But, usually, they're just recolored characters and stuff.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Alright.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Dark Sakura.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Sorry, I got tangled.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
And not in a fun way, either. You know.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:58.000
So, anyway, um, we've talked a little bit about the Oculus Rift thing, about how kind of creepy it can be, and kind of weird.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Creepy awesome.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Yeah.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Well, there is a Japanese sex game that will be, uh, bringing out Oculus Rift support.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Nice.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:17.000
The game is called Custom Made 3D, and it basically lets you create a maid that you can play with.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:22.000
And it comes with a controller called the Juicy Air Support.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.000
It's like a move controller, but it, um, isn't, uh...

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.000
It's a flashlight controller.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Yes, it is. So, thank you.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Um, so now, even though the game's been out for a little bit, it's, uh, got Oculus Rift support.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:41.000
So, you can, uh, get your action a little bit more up close and personal.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Yeah.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Right.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Hey. Cut an edge.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Alright, whatever you're into, have fun with that.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Whatever sinks your battleship.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.000
It's just that whole thing. Look, we've talked about this on the show before, right?

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Which is for time to penis, which is usually, which usually is about peripherals.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:08.000
And that is, how long will it take when they release this peripheral for someone to stick their dick in it?

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Or, how long will it...

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.000
They already had that.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Or use their custom creation stuff. Like, for example, Disney and Fendi.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.000
How long will it take for someone to create a giant phallus in their toy box?

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Ten seconds. You know? Like, that's, that's...

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Here's another, you know, further proof of that.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
So, this great new technology comes out.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.000
How long before somebody figures out how to work in wieners and boobs?

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:35.000
I'm sure this isn't necessarily the first attempt either, as those development kits have been out for a bit.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Anyhow, just a few more stories for you guys, and then the mailbag. Low-key.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Alright. So, Nintendo is now working to draw some, um, indie support as well to the Wii U.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Alrighty, it's pretty easy to publish indie titles on the Wii U.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.000
And you do see a lot of indie games coming to the Wii U, especially a lot of Kickstarter-backed stuff.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.000
You'll see, like, hey, we're making a Wii U version of it as well.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Um, but, you know, there are some comments done by, um, some of these indie developers,

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:07.000
including, um, I guess Dacko Dacko is one of the studios.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:11.000
They have a game called Scram Kitty and His Buddy on the Rails.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Or Buddy on Rails.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
And, uh, that'll be coming to the Wii U.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:22.000
They said, basically, they don't shout very loud about it, but they are working hard behind the scenes to make their platform as welcoming as possible.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
I gotta see what the hell this game is.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Wow, that's kind of neat.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.000
It's got a cat. It looks kind of evil.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
It's a...

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
puzzle platformer?

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Oh, neat.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Um, and then, of course, they were saying that, uh,

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:46.000
uh, former, uh, I can't even pronounce this guy.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Uh, this company, uh, Nam-Nam?

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Where?

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Nam-Nam. I think that's Nam-Nam.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Nam-Nam.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Nam-Nam. I'm gonna say Nam-Nam.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Nam-Nam.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Um, they're saying, you know, they focus quality over quantity.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Um, they're actively seeking indies, but they're looking for quality experience developers that can make,

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.000
maybe form a longer-term relationship.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Um, I guess they're bringing, uh, Tengami is the game they're bringing there.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:23.000
And then, um, also they're talking about Dreamfall Chapters, the longest journey.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Um, that, uh, basically saying, you know, they approached them last autumn,

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:36.000
and immediately after Dreamfall Chapters was announced, they were, in fact, the first console manufacturer to do so.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Um, yeah. So, that's cool that they're supporting indies.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:48.000
I mean, it's getting very interesting for indies, because now you have all these indie developers out there,

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:53.000
and, like, these, the console manufacturers are actively kind of seeking these guys out.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:58.000
And that's gotta be exciting for a lot of people to get into development.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:02.000
You know, it costs a lot to develop a triple-A game, and indie games,

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
not that they don't cost a lot to develop, because they do too,

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
but they're such a smaller scale.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.000
And also there's a high potential for return on their investment.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.000
This is exactly what happens in movies, right?

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:16.000
We've heard about these big-budget movies that have kind of flopsied, right?

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Like, we had the, um, uh, God, there was the, um, the Turbo, the animated film that just came out.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
The Lone Ranger.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Yeah, the Lone Ranger. The Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges movie, really tanked too, that just came out, like, last week.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000
R.I.P.D.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000
And, you know, some of these companies are having to take big losses on these,

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.000
and that's why a lot of movie companies really prefer to find these low-budget movies

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:46.000
that don't cost a lot of money, that, that make hundreds of times back their budget sometimes.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Like, remember there's something about Mary? That movie?

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:54.000
That was a huge profit for that company that put that out there, because that movie probably cost-

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.000
The Blair-Wench? Or, the Blair-Wench project?

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
That was a porno, you sick fuck!

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
But that had a high return on investment as well.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:05.000
You know, if they want Ryan Reynolds to do a movie that's gonna make money, just hurry up and do Deadpool.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Right?

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:09.000
The Blair-Wench project, though, that was, um, huge.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.000
That's another good example.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Not so much for the sequel, but, you know, it was huge for the first one.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:16.000
And I've been hearing a lot of buzz around this indie movie, the, uh, Fruitvale Station,

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.000
which, you know, maybe that's because I'm in Northern California, but it's based on some very unfortunate events

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:24.000
that happened in Northern California, but that apparently is getting a lot of buzz,

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000
that it's, you know, a great movie, and it's probably gonna make a ton of money at the box office,

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:32.000
and was made relatively on the cheap, too, so, I mean, you know, it's-

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Here's a good example. Clerks.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Oh, yeah. Oh, absolutely. Pretty much any movie that guy makes, although not all of them-

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Except for Jersey Girl.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
And, uh, Mallrats. Yeah, not all of them-

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Mallrats was great!

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:45.000
But, it was a good movie, but it didn't profit, really.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Not all of his movies profit, unfortunately. So, anyhow.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:52.000
I don't know how we got on that tangent, I guess because about, like, indie games, you know,

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:55.000
there's a potential for better return on investment there, so-

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.000
I know exactly how it happened.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Mm.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Because the same thing also happens in the movie industry. For example-

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Oh, I totally forgot this movie came out this weekend. Tiger Class said he saw The Wolverine.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:12.000
The Wolverine came out this week and did really well at the box office. It literally made back its budget.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Wanna see it.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.000
I do, but-

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
It looks so terrible, too, and that's kinda-

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:21.000
Hey, as an 80s Wolverine reader, we're forgiving.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:25.000
The weird thing to me is that I thought they already made a Wolverine movie.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.000
They did.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.000
I mean, I guess this is, like, a sequel or whatever, or a different direction.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.000
This is taking on the whole Wolverine in Japan arc.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
But it's the same guy. It's so weird to me.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
He's- I don't care. He's pretty.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Hugh Jackman is a good actor, you know? Just on the general.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:40.000
I want to pet him.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
I don't know that his wife would like that, but I care.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Of course you do. Of course you do.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Alright, moving on. I'm sure some of you guys saw this crazy video that was out there on the internet this week,

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:53.000
where some folks were driving a car with a Nintendo controller.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Now, obviously, there are limits to this, but cables that connect the controller to the electronic unit inside the car,

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.000
a 2010 Ford Escape, and a Toyota Prius.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:12.000
This is a project funded by DARPA, and it's to raise awareness about over-reliance on computer systems and vehicles.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:16.000
One of the researchers, who goes by Charlie Miller, said,

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:23.000
We would love for everyone to start having a discussion about this, and for manufacturers to listen and improve the security of cars.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:26.000
I don't know if that's how most people are taking this. I think most people are looking at it going,

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Cool! It's Mario Kart for real!

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Meanwhile, we have operator-less cars.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Yeah, that's true.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Oh god, I saw one of those Google cars on the freeway once. Did I tell you about that?

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.000
But somebody was at the wheel.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:41.000
I kind of always thought, though, that maybe even though the cars are driving themselves,

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:45.000
somebody's probably right there, ready to take over the car, just in case.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Like driver school or something.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:53.000
There was a neat one where, basically, they had a blind girl sitting in the driver's seat.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:57.000
So, you know, with her hands on the wheel and everything, even though the car was doing the work,

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:02.000
for her, it was like a giddy moment, being blind all of her life and being behind the wheel of a car.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:07.000
But it sounds like, to me, it's like cruise control, just cruise control with GPS navigation.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Well, they also have directional sensors and, what's the word I'm thinking of,

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:18.000
locator to check for items around them, echolocation sensors, I think.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Alright, well that brings us to the mailbag.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:28.000
And every week you guys can email us at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Dark Soccer will dive in the mailbag head first and hopefully she won't find me anthrax.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:39.000
But she will find, I was talking about an 80's metal band, but she will find some excellent emails.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:43.000
If it's anthrax and a public enemy, sign me up.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Alright, she will find some of your emails to read here live on air.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Again, that's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com. Please feel free to email us.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Unless you are a spammer, in which case you can fuck right off.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.000
You can fuck off and die.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:56.000
That's right.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:02.000
We actually have had a last minute, looks like an email that came after the show last week.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:08.000
It said, I emailed earlier but forgot to ask, is it possible that for the FUs of the week

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:11.000
you could play the old Final Fantasy Advent Children's Saffiroth theme?

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.000
I miss it so bad.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:15.000
That should be badly, by the way, that's an adverb.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Thanks again, Ricimo.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
What do you say? Should I try to dig that up and give this guy his wish?

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Sure.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Why not? Alright, I'll dig that up while you read the email.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Only if you use adverbs correctly in the future.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:28.000
It's not so bad, it's so badly.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:31.000
This is a conditional granted request.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
We're having some faith in you.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Don't say, I want that so bad.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.000
We believe in you.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.000
I want that so badly.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
We believe in you, but don't you dare let us down.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Alright.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Awful.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Please call me Serger.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Okay, Serger.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.000
Hi, O.L.R.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:52.000
I know Dark Soccer has been having house buying drama.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
God knows shit, especially today.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
So I thought I'd encourage her with my own success story.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Or make me jealous, I don't know.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
I'm a long-term mentor and have been saving for a home,

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.000
but I needed that final push to start the arduous home buying process.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.000
This spring I was playing Animal Crossing Wild World on my 3DS XL,

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.000
and paying my loan to Nook, and it hit me.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
I should be paying off a mortgage for reals.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Long story short, I'm closing on house on August 19th.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Next I plan on getting married after playing Harvest Moon.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
You gonna get a cow?

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Wait, is this for real or is this kind of troll?

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Like, I don't know.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Like, I kind of...

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Like, you seriously...

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Well, sometimes people have aha moments.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:27.000
I guess that's true.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
I'm sorry if I called you a troll,

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
but it's just kind of amusing to me

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
that, like, you know, you played Animal Crossing

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:36.000
and you realized, wow, I should go get a house for real.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:39.000
But then the whole, I should go get a girlfriend for real.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.000
That's where I'm starting to go.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Is this a troll?

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.000
You know what? It's funny.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:47.000
I was actually visiting Queen Simia's town a couple weeks ago,

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:50.000
and we were talking about paying off the mortgages,

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:51.000
and I was like...

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.000
And she made some comment, like, wouldn't it be a lot better

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
if the real estate market was like this for real?

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:59.000
I was like, I wouldn't have this problem right now if it did.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:03.000
If this was a troll, though, this was a great troll, so I, uh...

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000
A plus.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.000
A searcher.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Yeah.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Who we have seen in chat.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Yes, I do recognize the name. I do.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
This says, hey, y'all.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Hey.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Hi.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
This is from Ospher.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Oh, God, this is long.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Stop it. Stop.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
In the weeks following this year's E3 showing,

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.000
I sought out other video game podcasts to listen to,

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:23.000
in addition to yours, of course.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Good.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
While I did enjoy some of the other shows I heard,

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
I came to the realization that the host of OLR

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:31.000
is what truly gives it a solid advantage over the rest of the competition.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Yes, we do.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Aw, sucks.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:36.000
You have three hosts, each with very different backgrounds,

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:40.000
and each of which cover a different social aspect and identity.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
I love what each personality brings to the table as well,

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
and I love your grammar.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Loki, while often funny, yet ranty voice of the show

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
plays an important role of speaking openly his thoughts

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
on what a lot of gamers might have on their minds,

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
but might not have the balls to speak it.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:56.000
His rants are welcome, at least by myself.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
He's got an amazing head on his shoulders,

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:04.000
and shows that he's very knowledgeable about the industry as a whole.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:07.000
These rants only happen because he's a guy that truly cares

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
about the games and the gamers who play them.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
You know, DarkSakura, logging mails are okay when they exist

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
to inflate our egos a little bit.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Yes, thank you.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Keep going, sir. Keep going.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
Hey, it's the part about me next.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
DarkSakura is a bitch.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
No.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
No.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:27.000
DarkSakura is a very admirable host due to her ways

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
in which she approaches deep gaming discussions,

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
or discussions on any topic for that matter.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
Are you saying I get off topic?

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:37.000
While sometimes she may be quiet for the initial talk between Robin and Loki,

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:40.000
you can tell she has been gathering her thoughts to make some great points.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:43.000
No, she hasn't. She's been catching bugs.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:46.000
I turned off Animal Crossing in the middle of Bobby's show

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
just because I had a visitor at 5 o'clock.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
I've been crocheting the whole time, but I've been listening.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Her penis cozy is now like a boa constrictor cozy.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
That's how long she's been doing.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:58.000
You're really going to have a limited target demographic with that one.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:01.000
You know what? I'm going to say this.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:04.000
It helps me concentrate to have something to do with my hands.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:07.000
And as a corporate trainer during the day,

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
I can actually say that as like some people,

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
when they are actually like moving their hands,

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
it's very like they actually learn more.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:14.000
That's why they encourage...

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
It's called kinesthetic learning.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Oh, I know.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:20.000
I like it. One meeting when I was working for the student loan place

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:23.000
and they put out Legos to see if we retained more by playing with Legos.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:26.000
I built a little tower, but I remembered more.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Anyway, where was I? More stuff about me.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Okay.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
She's just been gathering her thoughts to make some great points

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:39.000
and also quick to point out something the other hosts may have missed.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:42.000
She's an awesome listener and I really admire her desire to understand

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
what others may have trouble communicating,

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:47.000
such as the incident of an angry email the show received

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.000
that Basch and other hosts close to the OLR family.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Even through that, she calmly read through and restated the point

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
the email was trying to get across gaming-wise

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:58.000
and that was pretty freaking awesome that she even gave it the chance.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Well, thank you.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:03.000
You were a saint for giving that email a chance, but yes.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Okay.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
And then there's Rob.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
No, then there's that guy.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Some may say he's the glue that holds the show together.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
Others may poke fun at him for making flappy hands

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:16.000
while taking a single shot of some sort of alcohol.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
I'm on my second glass of wine and I'm holding up just fine.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Yeah, but it's not burning your face off like the fireball.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
No, the fireball was really...

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:24.000
I can smell that.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:27.000
That and the, um, what was the other stuff we had that one night?

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Oh, God.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Yeah, anyway.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Sorry, let's not turn this into a liquor discussion.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Okay.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:36.000
Rob never has a one-way mentality towards any gaming issue

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:40.000
and he will always play devil's advocate to try and see things from both sides.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:44.000
He's never too serious, but he's serious when it is warranted

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
and he's always there to listen to a gamer's plea for help

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
or just help others in general.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Tonight, I'm going to come to him for some advice.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.000
Uh-oh.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Rob.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:54.000
Yes?

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:57.000
As a gay gamer, you've certainly felt what it's like to be pressured by your family

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
before coming out to them.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
You must know what it's like to have them wondering

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:04.000
why you aren't trying to find a girlfriend or to feel that pressure

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:07.000
that you have to please them by giving them grandchildren one day.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:10.000
At least you might have felt that until you came out to them.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:11.000
How did you do it?

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:14.000
I asked because very recently I was on a walk with my dad.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:17.000
He's very conservative, often scoffing at any gay issue

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.000
when he sees it comes up in the news.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Yet when I showed him concerns about my uncle telling us that you choose to be gay

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.000
and if you are gay you're going to hell, obviously this isn't true

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:29.000
and when I told him that I had sour feelings toward him because of it,

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
he said you shouldn't hate someone because of something they said.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
They might just be uninformed.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:37.000
After this he followed up with you can be whoever you can be with whoever you want with

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
as long as it makes you happy.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:42.000
I don't care what you want to do with your life as long as it satisfies that.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Should I just tell my parents that I'm gay?

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:49.000
I know this is a tough question but I don't know anyone better to come out to

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
about this except for yourself.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:55.000
I'll make my decision based on what you tell me following this email.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Sincerely, Oscar.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:00.000
P.S. Really sorry this email is a bit long.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.000
I just need some thoughts out there.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Can I say one thing?

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Please.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Usually your parents know.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Actually this is what I was going to get to as well.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:12.000
This is a very heavy email and not about games but I'm all about

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:17.000
there's more to gaming than the games themselves if that makes sense.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
You can't have the games without the players, right?

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Right. So let me, yes I will tackle this issue here and help this guy out

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:27.000
because he's clearly asking for it.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:30.000
What Dark Soccer just said to some extent is true.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
There's a good chance they already know.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:35.000
And that's a good indication based off what your dad said.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:39.000
And you know when I came out to my parents I was very fortunate

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:42.000
that I had a fairly positive-ish reaction.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:48.000
You know my mom was upset for about a day but never at me.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
She blamed herself because she felt it was her fault.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:54.000
She felt she, and I think she had the whole thought about grandchildren

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
and so forth but she wised up to it.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
I mean the year is 2013.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:03:59.000
It's a different world we live in now.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Even though you're gay that doesn't mean you can't have kids.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:07.000
It's just you don't have kids the same way other people have kids.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:11.000
You adopt or you have the surrogate mother or whatever.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
There's tons of options out there.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
So just because you're gay doesn't mean you can't have kids.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
So get that out of your mind first off.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:24.000
Second off, my parent, my mom actually asked me when around the time I was 20

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
she would ask me almost every day.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Like it really got bad during one summer.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
Like, are you gay? Are you gay? Are you gay?

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:33.000
And suddenly one day I finally just kind of like, I just had my fill of it.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:36.000
I was like, yes, dammit, leave me alone type of thing.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
And we kind of had like that blow up discussion.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
But you know things were fine.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:43.000
I know the first thing she did was she called my grandma

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:44.000
who has since passed away.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
May she rest in peace.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:50.000
Because the first thing my grandma said when my mom said Rob's gay

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:54.000
is my grandma said, so what?

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Which is a great thing.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:59.000
I realize though that I'm very fortunate in that regard

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:02.000
where I have a very cool supportive environment

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
and not everybody is so lucky.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Like your uncle sounds like a bit of a knob.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:09.000
You know, unfortunately you may not get that same level of support from him.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:13.000
The point I wanted to get at though is that the reason why my mom escalated

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:17.000
in asking me the question is that apparently unbeknownst to me

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:21.000
I had a female friend stay the night at my place once while I was in college.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:25.000
And she called her parents to ask if it was okay to stay over.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:28.000
And she said, even though she was kind of whispering on the phone,

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:31.000
she said, no it's fine. He's gay. Nothing's going to happen.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
My mom overheard that conversation.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:39.000
So she already knew and she was waiting for me to tell her.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:42.000
And she said later on, she's like, you know, I've always suspected

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
since you were younger.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:49.000
I'm not a big fan of that because I don't think that certain behaviors

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:53.000
are indicative of certain sexuality.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Speaking in this whole larger discussion about gender norms

02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:01.000
and, you know, being effeminate and gay is not necessarily the same thing.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
There's plenty of effeminate guys who are very straight.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:06.000
There's plenty of, you know, I don't know what you would call it.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:09.000
But don't use the fucking term straight acting with me

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
because I hate that shit.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
There's no such thing as straight acting.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Everybody little bit gay.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Here's a good example of someone who you look at

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:21.000
and you might not see the gaydar set off with who's John Barriman.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:24.000
Okay, true. So here's the thing.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Is it possible your parents have come across something

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
that maybe they already have this indication

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
and they're waiting for you to tell them?

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Now, I think as far as you telling them, that is really up to you.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:38.000
You know best when the right time to tell them is.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:41.000
I think sometimes there's a lot of pressure in the gay community

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
to be like, come out, come out wherever you are.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:46.000
Come out. Get out of the closet.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.000
I'm a little bit more of the mindset of that is a little bit more

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
of a utopian view of where we should be.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:55.000
But it is quite frankly dangerous in some areas to do that.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:59.000
So my advice to you is if you are out on your own

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
and living on your own and doing your own thing

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
and making your own choices, then guess what?

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
You get to live your own life.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
And I think yeah, I think it might be a good time

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
for you to tell your parents about this.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:12.000
Especially if you get this indication that they already know.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
But if you're still living at home

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:18.000
and there's the chance there could be an ugly backlash,

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
you need to have a backup plan if you're going to tell them.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Just in case.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:25.000
And I pray to you that you don't have to use it.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:28.000
And I really hope that you don't have to use that plan B.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
But it is the smart thing to do.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Just in case.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.000
But if they did already know, it might have already been ugly.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:41.000
So, you know, I really have to say like I can't sit here,

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Oscar, and say yes do it or no don't do it.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Because guess what? I don't know your parents.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:47.000
I don't know your life.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:50.000
I don't know the way you conduct yourself on a day-to-day basis.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
You really know the answer to this question.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:56.000
But if you're in a place where your life where you can be your own person,

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
then I say you know what?

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
Go ahead and tell them.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:04.000
But, you know, remember your friends,

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:09.000
your real friends will always support you through this no matter what.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
That's the most important thing.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
So, and I will say this.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:16.000
I don't want to get into this too much on a video game podcast.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:21.000
I did, in my mind, I did lose a brother to this issue.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
He's still alive and all that stuff.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:24.000
We don't speak.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
I haven't spoken to him for a very long time.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:29.000
And it is partially because of this issue.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:33.000
And there will be some tough decisions you have to make along those lines.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:34.000
But you know what?

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:37.000
I may have lost a brother there,

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:42.000
but I have made so many other close male friends

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:45.000
that like honestly I would consider brothers.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:49.000
That are more brothers to me than my, my,

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:50.000
it's complicated.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:51.000
He's actually adopted.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.000
But my biological.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:53.000
The one you grew up with.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Well, not even that because he was 14 when I was born.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:00.000
So, but my, my mother brother will say that.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:05.000
I feel closely to these guys than I do my mother brother.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.000
So anyway, that's my very long winded answer.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Sorry for the folks that were here to listen to the games,

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
but maybe you were curious.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.000
I don't know.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Well, you know, and it's.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:19.000
He might be the only person out there having that same sort of thought too.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:23.000
So if it benefits somebody, then by all means, ask the difficult questions.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:24.000
Yeah.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
So, um, and you know what, if you're,

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:29.000
if you're straight out there listening to this and you know,

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:30.000
maybe you don't, you know,

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:34.000
take this little feedback I'm giving to us for here as maybe like a little bit

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
of perspective.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Like maybe this is why we need an event like gamer X,

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:43.000
because a lot of people respond to something like gamer X going, well,

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:47.000
when's the straight gaming convention. Okay.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Well when your parents kick you out of your house for being straight and you

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
get persecuted by society for that,

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:57.000
and you are treated as a second class citizen and people pass laws

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
against the way you are.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Look at Russia right now.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
You can get your fucking con.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:03.000
Yeah.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:06.000
These are the same people ask when we have white pride month.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:10.000
But yeah, some people need a safe place.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Thank your white privilege that you have a safe place.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Yeah.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
That's all I'm going to say. And I'll get off my soap box.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
I swear to God that shit pisses me off though.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Where do I get my straight pride parade?

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
You get it every single fucking day.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:27.000
So next email.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:29.000
Yes please.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:30.000
Okay.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Um, this is a rageinator.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
Hi, Loki, dark soccer, and Rob. It's your friendly neighborhood.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Rageinator provided that there is enough time in tonight's show.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:41.000
I'd like to propose that you do something akin to combining listless

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.000
and classic game of the week.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Why not come up with a definitive top 10 list of classic games that

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:45.000
people should play?

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:47.000
You know, it's funny.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:50.000
I don't think we've ever done like listless on the very obvious topics

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.000
such as this one.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:55.000
Uh, listless is always kind of for the silly stuff, but, um,

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:56.000
why not?

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Why not?

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Not tonight.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Maybe like as an OLR special sometime we'll run down like 30 classic

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:04.000
games, 10 each or something that you ought to be playing.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Although we do, we do have the classic game of the week built in every

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:07.000
week.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
We also do kind of have March Madness, which is, yeah.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:10.000
Oh yeah.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:13.000
Um, uh, I always want to say DMM, but it was Bresl's thing.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Right.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:18.000
So, um, but I liked your idea maybe for other topics.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Like we need to do more like special shows and one off things.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:22.000
So it'd be fun.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Yeah.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Well, um,

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.000
I think that's, let me check and see if there's any more emails.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Um,

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:31.000
in Korean.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
No, it's in Mandarin, but what's this one?

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:34.000
Oh, there's a thank you mail.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:35.000
Yay.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:36.000
Oh, wow.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:37.000
This is okay.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:38.000
We got one more.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Good thing I checked, isn't it?

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Yay.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Dear OLR, I wanted to send you a quick email to thank you for putting on a

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:43.000
great show for so many years.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:47.000
We don't always agree, but I always enjoy listening to OLR and I look

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:50.000
forward to the next gen discussions that will take place once we get the

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
PlayStation 4 and Xbox one in hand.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:55.000
I look forward to the day when we can separate facts from fiction and

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:59.000
conversations will be steered toward how fun NAC is or how I lapped Black

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Wolf in fours of five.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:04.000
I also look forward to adding everyone to my friends list on Xbox Live and

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:07.000
PSN once the friends cap is raised with these new systems.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:10.000
I know everyone likes to think I'm an Xbox fan boy,

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:13.000
but I am truly looking forward to experiencing what Sony and Microsoft

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:17.000
have to offer us over the next five years or so,

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:20.000
as well as what Nintendo will be bringing to the table as well.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Hopefully I can accept Rob's invitation to visit OLR in person at some point

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
since I only live a few hours away in Fresno.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:27.000
Yes.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:28.000
So sorry.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
Keep up the great work, Shadow Next Gen.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:33.000
When I ran into him at E3, I was like, you live in Fresno.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Why don't you drive up sometime?

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:38.000
We had a dude from Bakersfield come up and do the MS walk with us.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
If he can do that, you can do this.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
So yes, open invite, Shadow Next Gen.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Come on over sometimes and thank you for the email.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:45.000
And I'm sorry for Fresno.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
It's halfway to Disneyland. Think of it that way.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
No, it's near the Bravo Cheese Farms.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
What about the good things that Fresno did?

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
I went to a Weird Al concert.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:56.000
That was cool.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:00.000
Alright, thank you very much for the emails.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Haha, Bobby.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:02.000
What?

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Shadow Next Gen, you shut up about your fours a-lapping.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:07.000
Alright.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:08.000
Well, thank you very much.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
There were some really kind emails tonight.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:11.000
You guys rule.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Even though we got a little heavy with one of those emails,

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:14.000
it was a good discussion.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:15.000
So you guys rule.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Alright, so speaking of emailers,

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:20.000
we shall grant the wish of one of our emailers tonight

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
and bring on the FUs of the Week

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:25.000
with an old-school song from Orange Lounge Radio,

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:26.000
what we used to use for the FUs of the Week.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:27.000
It has my stabby part in it.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:28.000
Here we go.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:29.000
With murder.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Yes.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Here we go.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:32.000
It's the FUs of the Week time.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:45.000
My FU goes towards losing that house.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:48.000
We had been told we lost the house,

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
but it turns out that it had actually been an old message,

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:53.000
so we thought we got it, and it turns out we didn't.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:57.000
So there's a very selfish, spiteful part of me

02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:00.000
that still hopes that there's one way we can get it,

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
but it's back to looking.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:05.000
We may talk to a house flipper.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:08.000
So back to the hunt.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Just ready to be done.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:14.000
I'm ready to be in any place.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
And an FU to my nerves,

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
because I'm pretty sure that my job is going to be awesome.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Everybody there was awesome.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
All the stuff that goes with it is awesome.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:27.000
I'm just a little nervous because I don't want to fuck this up.

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Loki.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:34.000
That's just FU death.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:38.000
FU the fact that all my coworkers are gone.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:41.000
All the coworkers that used to play for me,

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:42.000
those are gone.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
That's my boss.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:47.000
I kick his ass every day.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:48.000
Call of Duty.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:51.000
And it's just like...

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
And half the time he doesn't even want to play

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:56.000
because he's got errands to run.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:59.000
Or the coworker has errands to run.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:03.000
I don't even take breaks anymore.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Because why bother walking over there with a flake

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:07.000
and buy myself a bottle of coffee?

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Because it's a law.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:09.000
You have to take a break.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Are you hourly or salary?

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:11.000
I'm hourly.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:12.000
You're supposed to take a break.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:13.000
I'm supposed to.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
You're breaking the law.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:16.000
I take...

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:20.000
To quote the argument sketch from Money Python,

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:24.000
I could be choosing to argue in my spare time.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:25.000
Whatever.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
So yeah.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
There's no point in me walking over to the game room

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:32.000
to try to play an Xbox Live game

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:36.000
because our live connection is absolute shit

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
and we get disconnected all the time.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:46.000
It's because we're on 20 gigs down to the whole company.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.000
It's like my internet running a hundred computers.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
It's not going to happen.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
So yeah.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
That's it.

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:57.000
Alright.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:58.000
Let's see.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:15:59.000
My FU of the week.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:02.000
One goes to stress.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:05.000
Because stress will just drive people insane.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
Stress will fuck up your body.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
Stress sucks.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
So I'm going to give an FU to stress.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:14.000
And it's not necessarily me just going through stress

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
but I just see the impact it has on other people

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
and it's never any fun.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
So I want to also say that FU did the fact

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
that Video Games Live was in San Francisco

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
on Thursday and Friday.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
And I didn't go because I was so busy

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:27.000
with so much other stuff going on this weekend.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
I didn't go.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
So I'm kind of irritated at that.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:32.000
I really wanted to go

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:36.000
and it just wasn't going to work out for me this year.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
But I do want to give a thank you.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:39.000
I want to give a thank you.

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
Should I give some thank you music here?

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Let's see.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:45.000
Go back to the hippy dippy classic game of the week music here.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:48.000
I want to give a thank you to Brad from Pod Culture.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Well not only is he pretty much just an awesome guy.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
He's helped out Horde House and so forth

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
and you all should be listening to Pod Culture.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:56.000
But he said here in chat,

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
you never have to apologize for the tangents,

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
serious or funny.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:03.000
They are a part of you guys and thus a part of gaming

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
and why we tune in.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
So.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:08.000
Shucks.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
I just had a big smile.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:11.000
Thank you guys.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Many hearts.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:13.000
To all of you.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Thank you to all of you.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:15.000
Not just Brad,

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
but Brad needs to share his thanks with all you guys

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:18.000
that tune in every week,

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:21.000
be it live or podcast form.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:22.000
Aw shucks.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:23.000
You made it this far in the show.

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
You're awesome.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
Gold star for you.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:28.000
All right.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
Let us move on, shall we?

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:31.000
Loki.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:34.000
All right.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
So this is kind of interesting.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
It's kind of a culmination of a lawsuit

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:39.000
that's been in the works for a while.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:44.000
You may remember the original creator of Madden

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:47.000
was filing a lawsuit against E.A.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:50.000
for some royalties that were unpaid

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:57.000
between, you know, 1990 and, you know, 1996.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Didn't they find out there were more monies due too?

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:03.000
I don't know if this is the same situation,

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
but apparently he got $11 million.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:06.000
So.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:07.000
So, yeah.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:11.000
And great for him, I guess.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:14.000
Finally, the Madden games are good for something.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:17.000
So basically, the jury found that the games released

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:20.000
during that time were virtually identical to the original.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:21.000
Ha ha ha.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:24.000
This is like the Wii version of the game now.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:27.000
See, and, you know,

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:30.000
the original version of Madden NFL Football

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
developed by Antonyc

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:36.000
and basically saying that they,

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:39.000
you know, I guess the Antonyc and his attorneys

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
will seek to appeal previous rulings

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:44.000
that exclude the Super Nintendo games

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:48.000
and fraud claims from the jury deliberations.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:52.000
So I think they are still gonna try to seek some more money,

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:57.000
but right now $11 million isn't nothing to shy away from.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:00.000
So that's pretty cool.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:01.000
All righty.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Maybe he can buy himself a new game studio

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
for that amount of money.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
Hey, Atlas is on the table.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:08.000
There you go.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:15.000
You might be able to pick up an Atari IP while you're at it.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
Moving on.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
This is really sad news, actually.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
It kind of sucks.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Do you remember that Darkstalkers

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
was set to make this big return

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
and we had Darkstalkers Resurrections

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:28.000
came out recently, right?

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:29.000
Yeah.

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Well, here's a quote from Capcom product manager Matt Dahlgren.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Darkstalkers Resurrection did not perform as well

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
as we would have liked to perform.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:43.000
There is nothing Darkstalkers on the immediate horizon for sure,

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:46.000
meaning if you were looking forward to Darkstalkers 4,

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:49.000
you'll be waiting a little bit longer,

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:52.000
and it's all because you didn't support Darkstalkers Resurrection.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
This is basically all your fault.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:55.000
It's because we hate you

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:58.000
as much as we hate the people like Mega Man.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
So, but enjoy Dead Rising 3.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:01.000
Please look forward to it.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
And look forward to Strider.

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
Now, actually, you know what?

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:06.000
You know what?

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:11.000
If I had to send Darkstalkers off for a Viking funeral

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
and never see it again,

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
to trade it for another Strider game...

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:16.000
Hell yeah!

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
I'm okay with that, to be honest.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Yeah, but okay, let's look at all the games

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
that they've decided to put out again

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:25.000
or make new versions of or something,

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
versus Mega Man.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:32.000
We've had the Dungeons & Dragons arcade games.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Final Fight.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Final Fight's good, but...

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
DuckTales.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:41.000
Strider.

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:42.000
And the problem is?

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:43.000
The problem is,

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
I mean, DuckTales, while good and everything,

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
it's not Mega Man.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
Why can't we get a new Mega Man?

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
I mean, I guess we got Mega Man 9 and 10,

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
but we need more Mega Man.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
You're still making Dead Rising games,

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:56.000
and those aren't that great.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:59.000
I think Strider trumps it.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
I have no interest in the Strider game.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:07.000
All right, well, going to the chatroom

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
at live.vognetwork.com,

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:10.000
ActDef says,

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:11.000
No, no, fuck Strider.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:12.000
I want new Darkstalkers.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:13.000
And BlackWolf says,

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
I want new games not based on old IP.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
Ugh, haters.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:18.000
Let's see.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
Also, ShadowNextGen says,

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
and before I open up the phones at 1877 Game OLR

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
or a username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio,

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:25.000
all one word,

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:26.000
ShadowNextGen says,

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
There was some fairly big Activision news that is happening.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:29.000
I'm surprised no one has mentioned it,

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:30.000
at least not yet.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:33.000
You know it did mysteriously not make the show roll.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
I guess nobody posted it,

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:38.000
and I forgot about it amongst all the other craziness going on.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:39.000
Oh, about them buying themselves back.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Yeah, about the whole buying themselves back.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:43.000
And I remember we saw the signs kind of leading up to it

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
with the whole Vivendi's looking to unload.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
So, yeah, quickly, let's bring that up.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:48.000
They basically bought themselves.

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Yeah, they bought themselves back.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Well, what does that really mean, though, Loki?

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:53.000
It means that...

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Eight billion.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
They paid eight billion for themselves.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:00.000
They bought out the shares that Vivendi owned.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
Now, Vivendi still owns part of it.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:05.000
It's 12% of the company versus, I guess,

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
a controlling share or something, but...

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:08.000
Over 50%.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Yeah, so they basically bought that stuff back.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
There's also another...

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:15.000
Some Asian company also put some money down.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:18.000
I think they have, like, the Call of Duty online game

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:21.000
in China or something.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
They put some money down, too, as well.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:24.000
That's part of that.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:28.000
But, yeah, so basically they bought out that person's,

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:32.000
or that company's shares of their company,

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
and now they have the controlling shares again.

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:35.000
Some folks in the chat room are saying,

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Activision is now an independent company.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
I don't know if I'd go that far.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:43.000
Would you consider Activision games indie games at this point?

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:44.000
I'm not sure.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
I mean, what is an indie game, I guess?

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:47.000
I always think of an indie game

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
as like something dudes in a basement wrote.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:50.000
It's usually low budget.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:51.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:52.000
So I don't know if I'd go that far.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
I want that as a game, dudes in a basement.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:59.000
But it's more interesting to see what's gonna develop from this.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:02.000
I mean, from a financial investing stock side,

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
it's fascinating, but I'm waiting to see, like,

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:07.000
does change in policy come from this?

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
Because the management's not gonna change.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:10.000
The CEO doesn't change.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
Just means they make more money at the end of the day

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:13.000
because more of that...

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:14.000
Maybe they don't have to answer

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
to a greater board of directors.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:17.000
That's the one thing that gets cut out.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:20.000
We can raise the prices of the games again.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
The prices of the games again, yes!

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
Or maybe make some big decisions

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
to take World of Warcraft free to play

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:27.000
or whatever they gotta do.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:30.000
So it'd be interesting.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:31.000
All right.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Well, if you want to call in and talk about this,

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:33.000
the Activision split,

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
or anything else we've talked about this week on the...

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
or this week, yeah, this week tonight on the show,

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
1877 Game OLR,

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:42.000
or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:45.000
We're gonna open those phones right now for you to call in.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:48.000
If you have anything you want to talk about at all,

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
you can do that right now.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:53.000
Meanwhile, I will look for some last-minute stories.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:54.000
I'm gonna go to Twitter as well,

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:55.000
see if there's anything on there.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
But, Loki, DarkSakura,

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:58.000
either of you have some last-minute stories

02:23:58.000 --> 02:23:59.000
you want to share?

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:00.000
No.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:01.000
I mean, no.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
My voice decided to die.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:04.000
Fair enough. Loki?

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:08.000
No, I don't really have anything right now.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:09.000
Holy moly!

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
It's a slow news week.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
It was a little bit of a slow news week

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:16.000
when all that drama about the indie game

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
and all that kind of takes center stage.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
I think that kind of tells you what kind of week it was.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:21.000
But, okay, there's a few things

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
that the Twitter folks are sending us,

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
so let me read some of these tweets real quick,

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
and maybe some of you guys heard about these stories.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:30.000
SSG100Matt says there was some punch-out-related news.

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:33.000
Apparently, Mike Tyson was caught by TMZ.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:36.000
You know TMZ is that really trashy tabloid site

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
that, like, stalks celebrities at airports

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
and asks them really stupid questions?

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
Well, Mike, apparently one of those guys at TMZ

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:43.000
asked Mike Tyson,

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:46.000
Hey, how far can you get in Mike Tyson's punch-out?

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
Have you been able to beat yourself?

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:49.000
And he said that he sucks at it,

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
like he can't even get past the first guy.

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
Oh my god, that is so stupid.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:57.000
Hey, Mike Tyson, what's your favorite brand of chips?

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:58.000
Hey, what kind of...

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
It's like, what kind of ice cream you like?

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:03.000
Is that really what they're approaching?

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
Well, you know, Loki, I think I like the Ruffles chips

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:06.000
because I don't have ears.

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Is that like what they really like?

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
That was the worst impression by that.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
Is that like what they're really doing

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
to celebrities nowadays, like stalking them,

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
to ask them really fucking stupid questions?

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:18.000
Have you looked at TMZ?

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
No, I have not.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:21.000
Never, never.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
It is the cesspool of the internet.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Like, if the Big Brother house is the cesspool of society,

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:29.000
then TMZ is the pooper in that house.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
Yo, Mike, what do you think about the royal baby?

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Who cares? Alright, look.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:33.000
It's a baby.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
Alright, look, we got a call.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:38.000
I just want you to know,

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:41.000
I had to bite my tongue during that whole segment

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
so I wouldn't bust out in full laughter.

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
Did you like my impression?

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
Oh, God. You're just terrible, man.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:48.000
Just terrible.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:51.000
Alright, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
Not much. First, I want to say

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:56.000
the advice that you gave earlier in the podcast...

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:01.000
It means a lot.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:04.000
It does, because I'm dealing with some similar issues.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
I have to talk to you about that another time,

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:09.000
but I truly understand somewhat where you're coming from

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
with this and that, so...

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
But I actually called in to let you know

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:17.000
that I'm actually getting my replacement headset

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:18.000
from Astro Gaming.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
Oh, that's right.

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
You're having all this drama with Astro Gaming.

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
For the new listeners, recap real quick.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:27.000
Long story short, I was having issues

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:28.000
with the mixer and the headset,

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:31.000
and it took them maybe about several months

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:34.000
through various emails to try to get it fixed.

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:37.000
The mixer got replaced, the mic got replaced,

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:38.000
but not the headset.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
That problem still persisted.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:43.000
It's like the clouds in the sky parted

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:44.000
and the sun shone through,

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
and all these customer service issues

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:47.000
are getting fixed this week,

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
because Loki's finally getting his damn controller, too,

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:50.000
for the Ouya.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Well, allegedly, until that thing shows up.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
Except it's coming from DHL,

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
so it'll be probably fired out of a cannon

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:59.000
across the Pacific Ocean and hopefully land.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:00.000
I gotta get my Ouya back for me this week.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
They're delivering by carrier pigeon.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:06.000
That's because DHL packed it up and left.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
They couldn't compete with FedEx and UPS.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:12.000
They closed up several years ago.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
It was just whatever's left.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
Well, congratulations on getting

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
what you needed from the company.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:24.000
It's a good, happy end to the story, we hope.

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
It took two phone calls.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:27.000
The guy called me back.

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
I explained everything,

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
so they sent me a brand new 2013 kit.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:35.000
And the appropriate cables for the new mixer.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
Dark Tetsuya in our chat room,

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.000
sorry to go on a tangent here real quick,

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
but says about the whole Mike Tyson impression

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:41.000
I did earlier.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
Rob should really get into VA work

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
after this OLR thing ends.

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
Dude, why do I have to wait for OLR to end?

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:48.000
You want OLR to end?

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:49.000
Fine.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:50.000
Last show, everybody.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:51.000
Bye.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:52.000
No.

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:53.000
Not really.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
That means Uchon gets started on OLR,

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:56.000
the Flash animated series.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:59.000
Why does that have to be something we wait on?

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:00.000
You know what?

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
I did used to want to be a voice actor.

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:03.000
Yeah, the VA thing?

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
I would be so down with that.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
Throw me a script, people.

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:10.000
I'm not very good at pursuing that stuff on my own

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
because I do have a day job and all that,

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:15.000
but it would be a dream to be a cartoon character

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:16.000
or something, you know?

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
So, absolutely.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Throw an idea my way and I'd be happy to do it.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Even if it's just a little cameo.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
Even if I have to play derpy hooves or whatever,

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
I'll do it.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:31.000
Anyhow, what else is going on with you, Rama?

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:32.000
What else in gaming?

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
What have you been playing lately?

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
You might get mad if I tell you the game

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
I've been playing for the last week,

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:39.000
the last several weeks.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Try me.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:41.000
Sailor Moon S Fighting Game.

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
No.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
I've been playing Candy Crush Saga.

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Oh, God.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
Judgingyou.com.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
I'm judging you times two.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Actually, is that a site?

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:52.000
I don't know.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:55.000
This is coming from people who play Warcraft and FF11.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:58.000
This is coming from people who play Warcraft and FF11.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
For shame, good people.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:01.000
For shame.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Okay, look.

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
Bobby told us to hang up on you.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:08.000
We're not gonna because we have some tolerance, but still.

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Judging.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:13.000
Wow, somebody has Judgingyou.com

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
and it says it's currently under construction.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
It looks like a web page from 2005.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.000
And now we're judging you, Judgingyou.com.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
Yeah, I'm totally judging you, Judgingyou.com.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
All right, anyhow.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:28.000
Candy Crush Saga, what stage are you on in Candy Crush?

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
315.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
Holy shit!

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
How much have you spent?

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:35.000
None.

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:36.000
Wow, okay.

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:37.000
I am kind of impressed.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:38.000
You know, I blocked that today.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Some of those levels are pretty fucking impossible without buying power-ups,

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:45.000
so applause to you, my friend.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:46.000
No, no applause,

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:50.000
because I'll be the first one to admit that I cheated on half those levels,

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:51.000
and you know what?

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:56.000
Even with all the extra power-ups, the game is still kicking my ass.

02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:01.000
Even with power-ups, I was stuck on the same level for a solid week.

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
How do you...

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
How do you...

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
Sorry, I got confused with a little tweet here.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
How do you...

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
You said you cheat.

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
Yeah, how do you cheat in Candy Crush when it's an online game?

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
I play on my tablet.

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
And believe it or not, even though it's an online game,

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:22.000
there are ways to access the Facebook app through third-party applications.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:23.000
Oh, okay.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
All right, gotcha, gotcha.

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
All right, well, thanks for the call, Rama.

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
I'm going to let you go and try to get some more calls, okay?

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
No problem, and stay fabulous, darling.

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
I will, always.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:34.000
You got it.

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:35.000
Stay black.

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Black.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:37.000
You got it!

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
All right, bye.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:43.000
And for anyone, that's been a long-running inside joke on the show,

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:44.000
just to be clear.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:45.000
It was from Dan.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
It's something that Dan started, which was hilarious.

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
Because my husband's a dooper.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
Well, he didn't know what else to say in that moment,

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
so it was just really funny when he said that.

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
All right, anyhow,

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
BlackWolf in our chatroom says,

02:30:57.000 --> 02:31:01.000
I'm sad to report that Candy Crush Jam Session has been cancelled.

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
Oh, I didn't let poor Rama plug Anime Jam Session.

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
Well, you should listen on Tuesday nights.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:08.000
All right, let's go back to the phones.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype,

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:13.000
Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
Otherwise, I still have some more tweets for you guys.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:18.000
SGA100Matt did have a second Punch Out tweet for us,

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:19.000
and that is,

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
A Gaming Did You Know?

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
The title theme to Punch Out came from Gillette's

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:27.000
Cavalcade of Sports 1950 intro.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
And Bobby Blackwell followed that up with,

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
it actually was one of Gillette's theme songs,

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:32.000
very famous back then.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
Here's Boston Pop's version,

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
and a whole bunch of YouTubes were linked.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:40.000
So, you know, a lot of gaming songs kind of end up getting inspired by

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
stuff that's out there in popular culture.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:43.000
Jairus.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
I was just talking about one of my favorite

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
Commodore 64 games today on Game Buoy,

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
and I won't tell you what game it is.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
You'll have to listen to their show to find out.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:55.000
But it has a whole stage named after a popular song from the 80s,

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:59.000
and actually the little music in the stage was kind of inspired by that song.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
It's all based on Whitney Houston.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:04.000
All right.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
I watched a video today of Left 4 Dead 2 mods

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:09.000
that had Whitney Houston as a playable character.

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
Oh my, that's terrible.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:13.000
That's terrible.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
Again, she's putting a shout out there for some phone calls,

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:17.000
Orange Launch Radio,

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:18.000
all one word on Skype,

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:19.000
or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:22.000
Rob, remember when we used to make the RIP names in WoW?

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
Yeah, I still have RIP Betty White,

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:26.000
just for the day.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
And I, you know, again, guys.

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:29.000
I had RIP Whitney.

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:32.000
I love that woman, and I don't want that to happen,

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:35.000
but when it does, I'll be ready.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:36.000
You know what I still had?

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:37.000
Rebecca Black.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
She was like max level at one point, wasn't she?

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:41.000
She's 85 right now.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Actually, no, she's 86.

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
Hey, you can always start Final Fantasy XIV

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:47.000
and have Rebecca Black Mage.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:50.000
I actually like that.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:51.000
That's really funny.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:52.000
You know what, maybe I'll do that.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:53.000
Rebecca Black Mage.

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
I'll make like a human character in XIV

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
and do Rebecca Black Mage.

02:32:58.000 --> 02:32:59.000
I love that.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
I was going to name my Final Fantasy XIV character,

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:04.000
because originally my little Tarot Tarot

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
was named Lil Poundcake,

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
which if you watch RuPaul's Drag Race,

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:09.000
you'll understand why,

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:10.000
which was great,

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:14.000
but now I think I'm going to have a character, a human,

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
because Shane's convinced me I need to play a human.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
I think I'm going to name her Lisa Turtle

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
after one of my favorite Saved by the Bell characters,

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
because Lark Vuharis is a hot mess now.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
You want to know what's funny?

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
I've managed to get Homestuck names.

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:27.000
Oh, yeah?

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:28.000
On the busiest server.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:29.000
Nice.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:30.000
And no one else had them.

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:31.000
So I was like, heck yeah.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:32.000
Heck yeah.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:33.000
So is Skype working, y'all?

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:34.000
Poke, poke.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:35.000
I'll give it a few more minutes,

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:36.000
but if nobody else calls in,

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
I guess we'll call it a show.

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
We do have a few tweets from Tigerclaw, however.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:44.000
Disney registers some Star Wars Attack Squadron domains.

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
Hmm.

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
Possible announcement for later.

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:52.000
And PlayStation 4 devs can only use 4.5 gigabytes

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:55.000
of the system's 8 gigabyte RAM.

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
Isn't that kind of common, though,

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:00.000
that a big chunk of RAM is eaten up by the system itself?

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:01.000
But think about it.

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
The PlayStation's going to be recording,

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:04.000
and I bet the Xbox One has a similar story.

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:05.000
It's the same thing.

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:06.000
It's recording while you play.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:09.000
Once again, though, I think it was this week.

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:10.000
It could have been last week,

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:13.000
because all these goddamn weeks merged together.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:16.000
But seriously, what does that mean?

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:17.000
It means nothing.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
That's just a headline to get some hits.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:20.000
It's just like on IGN.

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:21.000
They had a headline.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:25.000
Hey, the FCC report came out from PlayStation 4.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
I think even the Xbox One.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:30.000
We now know what the operating temperature is going to be.

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:34.000
Who the fuck cares what the goddamn operating temperature

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:35.000
of a console is going to be?

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
It makes, it's nothing.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:41.000
It's just another article they can get some fucking hits

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:42.000
on their website for.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:46.000
It's ridiculous.

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:49.000
But yeah, I mean, we don't know what the hell that means.

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
I don't think it means anything.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:52.000
So what?

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
Because I bet you anything with three fucking

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:57.000
operating systems on the goddamn Xbox One,

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:58.000
there's going to be a good chunk of that

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:01.000
that's going to be dedicated to those.

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
However, there was a rumor I saw

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:06.000
that they're going to allow some of that for indie developers.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
But I think all that stuff is just being pulled out

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:09.000
of someone's ass.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
I mean, no one knows what the hell is going to happen.

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
And it doesn't matter in the end of the day

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
because there wasn't that much RAM on the Xbox 360

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:16.000
or PlayStation 3.

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:21.000
So there's some pretty good games on those consoles.

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
I don't think it's a big deal.

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
We'll just play the games.

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:26.000
Who gives a shit about the specs?

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:27.000
Just play the games.

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:28.000
They're good.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:29.000
Cool.

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
How the magic's done, no one cares.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:32.000
All right.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:33.000
We do have another call coming in.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:34.000
So let's go to it.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:35.000
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Day.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:36.000
Who's this?

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:37.000
Hi.

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:38.000
This is Raging Aider.

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:39.000
Hey, Raging Aider.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:40.000
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:41.000
Not much.

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:42.000
Yeah.

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:47.000
I just thought I'd call in with two very quick topics

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:50.000
just in case someone else wants to call in.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:51.000
Sure.

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:52.000
Yeah.

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:55.000
Although the first topic is probably more appropriate

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:59.000
for an anime jam session because obviously they talk about anime.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:04.000
But we have a series called Gunslinger Girl.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:05.000
Mm-hmm.

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:11.000
Well, for those that haven't heard of it,

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:12.000
it's an anime series.

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:16.000
It's two seasons long plus it has two OVAs.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:21.000
It basically centers around an agency in Italy.

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:25.000
It has a social welfare front.

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:31.000
It's really like a spy CIA type of agency in reality.

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
It involves cyborgs.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:39.000
I'm probably not doing the series justice by describing it,

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:43.000
but needless to say, it's a very excellent series.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:50.000
So for those that haven't seen it or haven't seen it in a while

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:54.000
and you like the anime or are at least somewhat interested in the anime,

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
I suggest watching it.

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:57.000
Wait.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
Was there a question in there somewhere?

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:06.000
Well, it's not so much a question but a recommendation.

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:07.000
No.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:08.000
Okay.

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:09.000
It's all good.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:10.000
I thought you said it was a question.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:11.000
I think I'll just watch Dollhouse.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:12.000
Yeah, no.

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:13.000
Sorry.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:14.000
It sounds interesting.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:15.000
It was more crazy in my part.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:16.000
No, that's all right.

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
I just don't watch a lot of anime, but not that it's bad.

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:19.000
I don't dislike it.

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:23.000
I just hardly watch any TV at all because I'm always playing video games.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:26.000
But it sounds cool.

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:30.000
I'll add that to my ever-growing list of shit to catch up on.

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:38.000
Well, it's probably one of those series that is probably really great

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:41.000
for those that don't watch a whole lot of anime.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:46.000
It's like an entry-level anime.

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:51.000
It's one of the first series I watched and I still love it.

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:54.000
That makes me so incredibly sad to hear that.

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:55.000
Really, it does.

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
Why is that?

02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:02.000
Because I remember my introductions to anime were classics like

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:08.000
Ranma and Devil Hunter Yoko and then watching

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:12.000
RoboTek when I was a little kid and Voltron and all that.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:17.000
Technically, I did see RoboTek a few episodes out there when I was a kid,

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:20.000
but I really don't remember too much of it.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:24.000
And I wasn't even sure if Voltron qualified as anime or not.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
As far as I know, there was American Made.

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:27.000
Well, it was Matt Cross.

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
It definitely qualifies.

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:30.000
Oh.

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:33.000
Well, then I stand corrected.

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:34.000
All right.

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:38.000
Well, anyway, just to switch gears so I can hurry this call up to keep

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
someone who calls in.

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:46.000
But as you may or may not be aware, in case you haven't seen me on

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:54.000
Scheme, I finally got into the Civ games, both 4 and 5,

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:57.000
and basic Black Wolf.

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
And I'm loving them.

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:05.000
And I was thinking, you know, although I kind of brought it up briefly,

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:09.000
Dollar Day when you were doing the Noob Nights on Borderlands 2,

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:15.000
one of these days we all should have like a VOD MIDI night on Civ 5,

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:18.000
maybe get like a pretty decent game going.

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:23.000
I don't know what the maximum number of players are for Civ 5.

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:24.000
I think it's 8.

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:25.000
I think.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Don't quote me on that.

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:27.000
All right.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:28.000
Yeah.

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:32.000
You know, since I guess that's one of the game's play on Steam is,

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
from what I can tell, pretty proper,

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:38.000
we should probably get like a community night going on there.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:41.000
I would be totally down with that because Civ 5, I agree with you.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:42.000
It's so awesome.

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:47.000
That can't be kind of pulled out of our butt the day of,

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
like we did Borderlands night,

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:52.000
the night we finally figured out we were both available.

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:56.000
Civ 5 night has to be planned in advance because Civ 5 night will go for 12 hours,

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
especially with eight people playing.

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:03.000
Like even if there's noobs, the problem is one person can really hold up those games.

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:08.000
So everybody has to be well versed enough in Civ to keep the game moving.

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:11.000
It would be one thing for like just Shane and I to play

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:14.000
because like he hasn't played at all so he has to learn.

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
So, you know, that could kind of move at one pace.

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:17.000
But if eight of us are going to play,

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:21.000
we all need to be relatively familiar enough with the game to keep it moving

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:26.000
because otherwise, like we're going to need 120 hours to play that fucking game.

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:27.000
Yeah.

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
I'll be first to admit that, you know,

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:35.000
I'm not on the same expert level as saying like you or, you know,

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
Put the car apart.

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:42.000
Wait, wait. Put the car apart because I am by no means an expert at Civ.

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
I'm actually quite bad at it.

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:47.000
I don't have the strategical mind it takes to play a game like that.

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
But I'm just saying you don't have to necessarily be good,

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:55.000
but you just have to be able to move relatively fast and not get yourself held up.

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Well, I was going to say I'm not as good as some of the other people in the bot community,

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:10.000
but, you know, ever since playing the game for the first time during their free weekend,

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:13.000
I've certainly got a whole lot better.

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:18.000
So, but for those that don't already have the game,

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:24.000
either Civ IV or Civ V on Steam already,

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
I definitely recommend getting those games.

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
They're really, really great.

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
You missed the hell out during the Steam sale, to be honest,

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:33.000
but hopefully it'll be on a flash sale again in the coming weeks.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
Yeah, hopefully.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
Well, I'll let you go.

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:40.000
I'm sure you're probably going to want to give more calls or wrap up the show,

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
but I'm glad I'm talking to you.

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:43.000
All right. Take care, Spaznator.

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:44.000
Good to hear from you.

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:45.000
I'm glad I'm talking to you too.

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:46.000
Bye.

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:47.000
Bye.

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:48.000
All right.

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
I always appreciate an endorsement for Civ.

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:53.000
1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:56.000
We'll give about one more minute, see if any other calls come in.

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:57.000
Did I do all the tweets?

02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:02.000
I think I did the last one there because that was from Tigerclaw about the,

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
oh, yeah, the partial system RAM,

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:07.000
and we were kind of talking about other systems and that whole thing.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:08.000
Oh, excuse me.

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
But that was it for tweets.

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
But if you want to send us a tweet in a future week,

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
twitter.com slash OLR,

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
and if you want to send us an email for a future week,

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:20.000
of course, that address is mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:23.000
I do not see the phone ringing here,

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
and we are out of last-minute news, right?

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:28.000
So I think we got to close up shop.

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:29.000
That's it. I'm going to go ahead and close.

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
We're having a big discussion on the old-school anime now.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:32.000
Oh, are you?

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:33.000
Like what?

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
Like Ronda just brought up Devil Hunter Yoko,

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
which is one of my favorite old series.

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:41.000
Well, actually, it was good through like the first three OAVs.

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:45.000
But like we have talk about, you know,

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
like the most depressing stuff like Dog of Flanders

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:50.000
and watching certain episodes of Galaxy Express 3-9.

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:54.000
And, you know, we're going back to the 70s and the late 60s now

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:57.000
for our references. So it's pretty cool.

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
But I have to say that one of my favorite of all time,

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
80s dirty pair.

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:02.000
Heck yeah.

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:03.000
All right.

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
Well, I guess I'll close up the Skype line

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:06.000
since nobody else was calling in.

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
But thank you to those that did call in.

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
And if you do want to comment on the show,

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com,

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
or of course tweets and Facebook.

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:17.000
As a reminder, we will be off next week

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
since I will be out of town.

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:22.000
So, you know, and plus we just we haven't had a week off in a while.

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Sometimes we want a freaking vacation.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:27.000
So I believe Bobby is still here live though at the Voice Geeks Network.

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
So please still tune in to support him.

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:32.000
And all the other shows that air on the network throughout the week.

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:35.000
We'll be back in two weeks.

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:38.000
Before we wrap it up, I do want to say thank you as always

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
for listening to our show and downloading the show.

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
We do do this for free.

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
We don't ask for your money unless, you know,

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
there's like a charity event going on or something.

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:50.000
But we just say, hey, tell a friend or two about the show.

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:54.000
Help spread the word about our show and just help help the family grow a little bit.

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:57.000
That's all we want. Help the oil army grow.

02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:00.000
Meanwhile, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
since we're closing up shop here.

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
Dark Sakura and your boa constrictor Cozy,

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:05.000
what is your final thought tonight?

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
I'm almost done with this thing.

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
But we also have other good references to other stuff like Zenki,

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
Record of Lodoss War.

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
Record of Lodoss War, by the way,

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
inspired one of my first D&D characters.

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:16.000
Oh, really?

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:17.000
Yes.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:21.000
My final thought tonight is I had this Chex mix today

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:25.000
that's called Honey Nut, sweet and salty, and it's delish.

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
It's like the Honey Nut Cheerios mix they used to sell.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:30.000
It's almost the exact same thing. Cool story, huh?

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
Loki, your last minute thought tonight or final thought.

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
I see Bobby's going back to play Saints Row IV.

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:37.000
You know what? I'm just going to go make my own Saints Row IV

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
with hookers and blackjack.

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
Well, maybe no blackjack.

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
Actually, I'm pretty sure Saints Row IV probably has hookers.

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
Maybe not so much blackjack.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:49.000
Are you still going to do your game programming thing on a smaller scale

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:50.000
where you do a blackjack?

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:54.000
Because you could still make slutty blackjack or slutty breakouts.

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
You know, because there wasn't that much...

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
I would say there was not really very...

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
There was hardly any response.

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:03.000
Not a lot of positive response.

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
I'm just going to table it for now.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
Just do something maybe on my own.

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
I think it's hard, too,

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:12.000
because the people out there have no frame of reference.

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:15.000
They don't really know what...

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
So you've got to kind of put something out there

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
before you're going to get any feedback whatsoever.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
So you do you!

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
You do you on that.

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:26.000
That's fine. I had to play Borderlands the other day anyway.

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
So, you know, to level up.

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
Sometimes there's just more important things like Borderlands.

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
Why is it level up so I can play with you guys?

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
Alright, fair enough.

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
Thank you guys very much for tuning in.

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:41.000
We will be back in two weeks with episode number 515.

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:44.000
I will see some of you next week at GamerX.

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
Please, if you do see me around the convention,

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
just come up and say hi. I don't bite, I promise.

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
I want to meet many of you while I'm there.

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:53.000
And for those that are not going to be in the area,

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
have a great week off.

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
Maybe I'll see you online gaming and so forth.

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
Don't forget we have a Steam community and some other communities as well.

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:02.000
And maybe this epic Civ night will have to happen at some point, too.

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
Have a great two weeks.

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
We'll see you next time here on Orange Launch Radio.

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
Good night.

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:11.000
